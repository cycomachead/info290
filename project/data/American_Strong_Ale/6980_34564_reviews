"Very strong and full-bodied, with a nice color to it."

"Bright amber body, tight foam slathering on all sides. Flavor starts mild with oak but opens up to alcohol infused caramel and mineral hop bitterness. Very easy to drink with the stated ABV."

"12 oz bottle. Pour is mostly copper with red edges and a fairly tight tan head. Nose has a light malt base with hints of oak and a fair bit of green apple sweetness, acetaldehyde as I am to understand. Taste has a bit of oxidation, notes of oak and some boozy characteristics. Malt base is fairly rich and dry, a touch tart and definitely a bit off. Full bodied, dry finish, well carbonated."

"I recommend aging it."

"The body was lighter than a lot of other comparable brews, which made for an interesting change of pace. Drinkability was dangerously good, a bottle (or 3) could get down the throat before you quite realize what's going on. Overall, a great brew, one that compares favorably with one of my all-time favorites, North Coast Old Stock Ale. This would certainly be in regular rotation if it were local. Obviously a must try if you see it."

"Overall it's an interesting beer, nice malt/honey mix with the bitter hops. Worth a try if you find it and its not too much $$."

"Super Kitty has a nice dark looking brown bark colored look with some dark mahagony popping through. Cant really see through the beer, not entirely black. Some faint bubbles pop up and pop down when in the snifter, they had a beige tint to them, no spots on the glass going down. At this point the hops have all but faded. There is a big caramel toffee vibe here with some underlining dark fruit mixture. Brown sugar and toasted malt. Super Kitty Kat tastes like it smells. Rich caramel, drk fruit, chocolate, semi vanilla tones, Toast. The alcohol pops out in just the slightest fashion. Feel is a step down from full bodied with a small amount of car bubbles on the tounge. Swift easy drinking, while not being overly complex, even at 6 years old. A great beer to share though with the size of the bottle and everything."

"Be careful here."

"Drinkability: Goes down fairly easily. A bit more heft to the mouthfeel and I would have given it a 4.5 in both the mouthfeel and the overall categories."

"O - It was very good, I don't know if I would want to drink this a lot. But it was good."
"Yup, pours a very reddish amber color with a one and a half finger off white bubbly head. Sheets of lacing on down the my Allagash chalice. Faint aroma, sweet crystal malts, sticky hops, yes honey, and if a I imagine hard enough oak too. An aggressive malty and hoppy flavor. Kind of a piney resinous hop flavor presents itself. Very sweet, yes I can detect honey, some light notes of vanilla and brown sugar too. As the beer warms some of that oak actually shows up. For such a strong beer the alcohol is super well hidden. Pretty rich and somewhat cloying. I typically like my American Strong Ales pretty brash and oaky/malty and this falls shy."
"The brew pours a mahogany brown and is capped with a fizzy root beer type of head. This beer sort of reminds of Imperial Turbodog. It is a bit sweet and dark-bready with molasses and UK ale yeast fruitiness. There is also a bit of an herbal lemongrass note taking hold, especially on the finish. I am not terribly impressed with this beer, I had never heard of it, and don't know what the big deal was supposed to be in the first place. It's not bad, but it's not particularly good either."
"D - Not sure why they felt the need to put this in 1L bottles - 12oz would be an appropriate bottle size. The 2009 was too heavily oaked and was less enjoyable. I'm averaging the scores of both vintages for the most part here."
"o Overall this is not a bad beer at all, but a little bit of a disappointment. It's a bit bland and boozey, with caramel and bready malts leading the way. Would give it another not, but wouldn't seek it out again."
"Pours an amber-brown color with some dark crimson highlights. There is a thin head, but it fades away quickly. The nose has a bit of caramel sweetness and molasses. Light hop character and maybe some honey. Really quite bland and boring. Nothing stands out and the notes that are there are just singular and don't truly interact. The flavor is equally disappointing. There is malt sweetness and brown sugar plus some caramel and light earthy hops. Maybe a touch of citrus. Medium body with some booze. This was just an average beer, which was quite disappointing after I had sought this one out a few times."
"-Gfunk"
"o - Overall it's a hop heavy IPA aged in nice tasting oak. The booze is there...making the mouth really nice. Once I got over the bittered flavor and the alc warmed me a bit I really got into it. If you dig oak aged brews this is a worthy one to try for sure since the wood really adds a great touch to the flavor, but the price tag is a bit hefty compared to other limited release brews that are out there. One for the tickers for sure...I was really glad to see it on tap so I could get my taste without having to shell out the dough for a bottle."
"Cheers!"
"O - Out standing flavor profile, with a much better balance on tap."
"This was a great brew from Keegan ales, my first from them I believe, but will definitely not be my last after sipping and savoring this intense offering, which I recommend doing, this is not one to pound but really quaff and savor over a period of time. Highly recommended!"
"Drinkability: Not too boozy, but it does hit eventually. 12% can't be hidden for too long. Still, this is a delicious brew that should be sipped and savored and enjoyed at least once (I wish I could get a growler!)"
"D: This is a beer that definitely needs to be sipped given its high alcohol content, although this allows you to savor the complex taste."
"Drinkability-It comes in a big quart-sized bottle and I'm already about half done with it; the whole package comes together very well and the drinkability is high."
"Reviewed on 12/19/2009. Growler from St. James Beverage. Pours a clear deep amber/brown with a small white head. Aroma of caramel, vanilla, sweet malt, toffee, light fruits (apple, pear). Flavor of alcohol upfront with oak, vanilla, and citrus hops in the finish. Sticky and heavy palate, 12% abv is clearly evident. Tough to plow through even a glass."
"ps. American strong ales aren't exactly my favorite style of beer, but this was surely enjoyable!"
"All in all, this is phenomenal! I am so glad I got to try this brew. Standing ovation for cavedave for the hookup, most definitely. Many flavors bounce around in this brew and it seems like it would be a very mass appealing brew. Hop heads and malt monsters will enjoy this alike. Even wine drinkers would appreciate this brew. All around great beer!! A must try."
"D - Definitely in the upper reaches of the Strong Ale category, at least as far as ABV% goes. The label says 12% and you can definitely taste the 12%, which hindered the overall drinkability just a bit. Otherwise, pretty good but not great."
"Pours a coppery orange color, crisp and clear with a decent puff of stiff foamy white head. Big whiffs of piney, floral and citrus hops with a sweet, big malty backbone - reminds me of 90 Minute from DFH. Taste is hoppy and bitter with a very interesting balance of floral, piney and citrus hops and a sweet toffee and carmel like malt backbone. Lighter side of full bodied, borders on syrupy, very dry. A decent beer, reminicent of DFHs aggressive IPAs."
"Medium bodied and slightly hoppier than the aroma suggests. Still a lot of sweetness and heat from the alcohol complimenting the sweet caramel malt. Also hints of Graham cracker and biscuit along with sweet citrus and dry piney hop notes. Long dry finish with more alcohol heat and warmth."
"Overall this was a very interesting beer and I can't think of anywhere else it belongs but in the American Strong Ale category. Well worth a shot."
"The more I drank this beer the more I enjoyed it, and as it warmed it got tastier. There seems to be a lot going on, with apricot and possibly some raisin as well as some more hops and malt in the finish. This beer almost has too much going on to capture all of the tastes, and once the alcohol starts kicking it it's very hard to keep a handle on this cornucopia of flavor. Light to medium carbonation with a smooth creamy feel on the tongue and in the mouth, this beer goes down way too easy for 12% ABV...well done Keegan's, this beer is very enjoyable and will kick your ass at the same time!"
"Poured into a sampling glass at the brewery, it appeared amber with less than a finger of white head, but great lacing. It smelled of super-sweet pineapple, dates, and caramel, and the taste simply confirmed this, and did not reveal any other nuances to me. One feature of the flavor that was positively surprisingly was that the syrupy sweetness did dissipate fairly quickly after the finish, a nice twist given the fact that most Strong Ales and Barleywines usually leave you with a lingering, cloying sweetness. Also, the alcohol seemed surprisingly well-hidden. Smooth and not as thick as I had expected; it certainly helps this intense beer's sessionability..at least until the alcohol knocks you on your rear end. A nice beer overall, but I wasn't as blown away as I had been expecting to be, given all of the stellar reviews I had read."
"D: I love this beer. Got a bottle for Christmas and it will sit in the cellar for a long while. Glad I got to try this off a tap. One of the most overlooked beers that I have ever had. Great work Keegan."
"This beer strikes me as the bastard child of Hopslam and Double Bastard. A great effort from a brewery that really hasn't done much for me."
"D - at 12% watch out, you know the alcohol is there but it goes down way too easy"
"#900!!"
"This stuff pours from my 16oz growler like it came from a hand engine. Light puffy head fading to a light film and ring. Nice lacing for a twelve percenter. Clear ruddy amber. A deep caramel and butterscotch maltiness greets my nose. Notes of oak and vanilla. Light piney hops and a bit of fusel alcohol. A soft sweet caramel on the tongue is countered by a healthy grapefruit and leafy hop bittering. A delicious woodiness flows into light vanilla. Alcohol is there, especially in the finish as it leaves light evaporative vapors. It is so well integrated that it never calls attention to itself. Quite a feat for the abv. Feel is soft and silky with a gentle carbonation. Super drinkable for twelve. This stuff is an impressive feat for the brewer. The overall experience is a cask ale in a growler."
"had a growler of this (64oz) for New Year's 2010... quite fantastic. I cannot say enough good things about this beer. One of my all-time favorites."
"this beer pours pretty brownish red color with a tan head that recedes to a nice rocky lace sticking to the sides of the glass. the aroma is really awesome, the roasted malt character playing nicely with the really pronounced hop presence, the oak is noticeable but not overwhelming, and surprisingly the alcohol isn't even detectable. the flavor follows with the sweet roasted malt up front complimented nicely by the vanilla from the oak, and balanced perfectly by the hops. the heavy body and good co2 make this a dangerously drinkable twelve percent."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderful pale and crystal malt scent along with a kick ass hop aroma. The oak chips provide a nice vanilla character that really compliments the malt/hop profile. The taste is outstanding! It has a very complex array of malts/hops/and oak character. It's got a solid malt base with just enough crystal malt flavor to balance the enormous hop taste. The oak chips really bring it all together. The mouthfeel is perfect. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine beer. It was really pricey $35.00/bottle, but it was worth it."
"D: Vastly exceded my expectations. I would love to have this again and while not the hype machine it deserves it is quite a treat for those who get to try it. Think Burton Baton but better. I think a pint or two would suffice but i could also see this one as being a beer that could get you in trouble"
"Mini growler pour from DeCicco's. Ardsley, NY. Pours murky darker almond amber, with some shimmery highlights. Modest and loose medium khaki head, that leaves a film, collar and moderate bits of fine lace. Bold nose charged with a load of sweet malt (smells like honey). Full flavor ASA, winter sipper deluxe. Smooth, warming and well crafted. It is not easy to craft a 12% brew that is malty but not overly sweet or overly hot. Super kitty is neither. No bargain at $24.99 for the full growler...glad they will fill 16 ouncers with a swing top.."
"D: High octane and hoppy. I'd be careful with too many of these regardless. I think it could sneak up on you because it hides its ABV well. I enjoyed this beer in the past but even more so this year. I have a 3 year vertical of bottles in my basement that I will enjoy reviewing against my notes for this."
"Overall, this is one of those beers that no one talks about, but then you open up the bottle and are simply blown away. What a fantastic beer! It's so good I went through a whole quart of it myself. The only flaw I noticed in this beer is that it could have been a little more viscous. If Keegan could somehow fix this aspect of the beer, Super Kitty would be a top 30 beer on the best of BA...easily."
"Drinkability is off the charts. There is no,nil zero, nada, zilch taste of alcohol to this big beer, which is extremely dangerous."
"Drinkability - It was very good, I don't know if I would want to drink this a lot. But it was good."
"Pours a rich amber with a creamy tan head. Nose has candy malts, dark fruits, peppery alcohol, honey, cloves, subtle hops, vanilla and oak. Taste has more sweet malts, oak, vanilla, honey, plums, figs and floral hops. Big body is nicely carbonated. Tasty American Strong Ale."
"Drinkability: based on the big alcohol in this one, it is truely a slow sipper. Overall the flavor is great, and this one is worth picking up depsite the high cost. Grolsch styled top allows this to keep over a session."
"And it stays true to the scent with the addition of fruit. Quite hoppy, actually. Very strong taste, so it's more of a take it easy kind of beer."
"Drinkability: The punchy (but never glaring considering the ABV%) alcohol keeps this one a slow sipper, but an enjoyable one."
"After a bit of fussing with the swingtop to break the wax, this opens with a hearty fizz. Pours a hazy amber with a thin finger's head that builds and dissipates slowly. The scent is great - honey, toasted oat, charred oak, caramel, a little bourbon. The taste is wow. Spiced apple-pear tart with a nice buttery crust topped w. a drizzle of honey. Oak, vanilla, a little bourbon burn and again honey. Hops have faded slightly but are still present, lending a sweetly floral note to the finish that complements nicely. A lot going on here even at lower temps, not sure I'm conveying it all. As indicated by the top popping, this still has a fair bit of carbonation to it. Medium body but not at all syrupy. Scarily drinkable for the strength and complexity. Top notch and the first ""wow"" beer I've had in quite a while. Actually worth the sticker price. Nice way to send out 08"
"The sweetness and booze strength hampers the drinkability on this one a bit, but by the rare chance that you have to possibility to try this, do. It's a very original brew that is equaled in character by few other beers that I've imbibed thus far."
"I was a little suprised when I got wrung up for a 30 $ bottle of beer but having opened it I am pleasantly suprised. The honey and oak flavoring adds alot to the hurricane kitty. Everything seems to come together nicely. Certainly not an everyday beer but a nice ""occasion beer"". Seems I am lucky to have gotten one of 200 bottles of this Ale, I will pass the word on to a few of my beer loving friends :)"
"Taste: Nice smooth medium bodied beer. Oaky honey and piney hops are most prevalant. Alcohol is evident but not overpowering. Not much flavor on the finish though but I really prefer a beer that hangs around a while. Basically you have to continually drink to really appreciate the flavor but at 12% its a little dangerous. Not entirely sure why the price was so high but would try again if it becomes a regular, more reasonbly priced brew."
