"Deep dark brown.  Smells sweet, with a banana like aroma.  Smells creamy as well if that makes any sense? Tastes sweet and I can't escape this banana like flavor... a chocolatey aftertaste. Only slightly boozey. The carbonation is good here.  Good, easy drinking, medium octane beer!"

"Along with Mac and Jacks African Amber ale and Georgetown's Manny's Pale ale, this is probably one of Washingtons staples of craft-beer. You walk into a joint and ask for an Irish Death and everyone will know exactly what you are talking about. There's a reason for this; It is a fantastic ale. It is a beautiful beer. Inviting, dark appearance, but on the lighter end of medium body, goes in and down super smooth and has an excellent taste of nut, caramel, malts and balanced well with comforting hop flavor. Though maybe not an out-of-this-world, knock-you-off-your-feet beer in the vein of strong ales, nevertheless it is an always reliable, always enjoyable brew."

"Overall â€“ A fairly nice stout overall with a decent sweetness but yet balanced by a good deal of roastednesss.  Overall rather nice."

"I had this tasty brew at the Rusty Moose in Spokane a few months ago. Poured black as pitch with a foamy tan head, but with a sweet aroma and thick, malty taste. Definitely a sipper, but an excellent one."
""

"Hands down the best beer I have ever had. So damn tasty. If the location I am getting beer at has this I wont even consider anything else.  5/5"

"A very nice big beer. It's smooth with just the right touch of thickness and deftly balances the malt sweetness with the hop bitterness and subtle alcohol heat. There is nothing earth shattering here, but it's very tasty and drinks very easily."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown with very little light transmission and a half finger light brown head with good retention and lacing. Nice aroma of toasted malt, chocolate, hints of coffee and vanilla. Flavor starts similar to the aroma, with toasted malt, chocolate and nuts with a lighter fruit element quickly developing to finish with dark malt, light cherry and berry juice, chocolate and a light tartness in the finish. Medium bodied with bright carbonation. A beefed up brown ale with an interesting flavor progression from almost a nut brown into a lighter slightly tart brown. The ABV is well covered, probably explaining the demise of the quilter. Interesting and I'm long overdue reviewing this local classic."

"Overall- Above average to good beer that somewhat defies categorization. Has some stout aspects and a few characteristics of a strong ale. It's worth a try no matter how you classify it."

"This beer is described on the label as ""dark, smooth ale", and I think they hit the target. This is an enjoyable malt bomb that I purchased during St. Paddy's weekend at Hennessey's grocery in Butte, Montana."

"A decent beer, and a very malt-forward example of the style. A bit forgettable, but I still enjoyed my bomber of it."

"Between the rich taste and the consistency of its flavor and aroma, Irish Death is a personal favorite of mine. However, folks who prefer more bitter American ale's may want to put this sweeter Northwestern brew on the bottom of their lists."
""
"Nice looking beer. Had it on tap at a new restaurant in the area, Hop Jacks. Decent head, left phenomenal lace. The aroma was average and the taste was far from complex. Definitely more on the sweet side and very low bitterness. Good mouthfeel but not much of an aftertaste. Overall not a bad stout, won't be my go-to stout but I could ""session"" these on occasion."

"overall a pretty good ale here, id drink another but i would always prefer arrogant bastard to this, so i'm not sure if i'd ever choose it willingly."

"O - This beer really grew on me the more I progressed through the bottle - for maximum flavor, don't drink this straight out of the fridge! Let it warm up just a little. Great beer here at a great price, awesome for those looking to expand their beer horizons or anyone keen to enjoy a rich, intensely flavorful and fun beer."

"O-- Nice, not overly sweet in my opinion, drinkable. Not overly malty for a strong ale. Balanced and not one-note. Wouldn't drink this all the time, but it's a pleasant 22oz attitude adjustment."
""
""
"O- Surprising beer. I liked it. It isn't drop-dead wonderful, but a nice roasty sort of ale."
""
""
""
""
"overall, highly drinkable due to the mouth felel and great balance. If this were readily available, I would have it again."
"Pours a partially transparent ruddy brown with a very thin head that disappears quickly with almost no lacing. The smell is dark chocolate and indistinguishable fruit that was not quite orange citrus which, darn it all, would have been nice. My first sip tasted distinctly like green olives, that put me off a bit. Fortunately the flavor changed and I was able to savor the sweetness of the bready malts balancing the high ABV. Still it's a thin ale with a watery back end. I guess you would classify this as a malty porter, where as porters are normally hopped, but definitely not a stout."

"The body is medium, and this beer is rich on the tongue and velvety smooth. There's just a very light crisp nip, as smoothness seems to be the intent, but smooth it absolutely is and makes for very nice drinking."

"My only complaints with this beer is the sweetness and the carbonation. It goes flat worse than a warm diet Coke - unless you get and drink this from the tap at BevMo and slam down two pints pronto, you're looking at a fizzless beer. The sweetness might be from the yeast getting tired of producing huge amounts of alcohol and dying off from their byproduct, yielding an approachable brew, but I like the bubbles coalescing from my tongue. What happened? Don't buy a 22 bottle and go on a road trip from Portland to Seattle, head and lacing will vanish in seconds. Again,. maybe the yeast couldn't handle it, but more carbonation would definitely make this beer world-class."
"O - This one's great if you're looking for a dark malty ale on the sweeter side."
""

"Pours very dark brown, very little foam. Some tan spots start out but fizzes out. Very malty nose. Some milk chocolate. Opens a sour malty taste. Very light carbonation leads to a creamy malt. If there is a hop in here, its buried in the thick wash of the malt. Ok."
"22 oz bottle poured into Russian River -tion glass. Appearance is a deep chestnut brown with auburn highlights. A thin layer of head sticks around to form a collar. Not much in the way of lacing. The nose features some sweeter notes of vanilla and cherry along with notes of caramel and toffee. Not getting anything in the way of hops. The taste is pretty sweet, just as the nose suggests, with lots of vanilla and caramel paired with dark fruits. The sweetness is strong but never becomes cloying. The mouthfeel features mellow carbonation with a moderate to heavy body. Overall, this is a malty treat that is balanced well and is deceptively strong."
""
"OA: not to bad, good with heavy rich foods."
""
""
"O- meh. Just an average beer. If you like sweeter beers with some roastiness you will enjoy this beer."
"On the edge of being full bodied with a light amount of carbonation, it certainly IS a smooth one. I like it."
""
""
""
"Hazy brown ale with a slight caramel hue. Done sweet Esters or banana and clove. Smells of smooth milk chocolate and hints of molasses malts. Nice brown ale flavor is then upended with some sweet what I think are off flavors in the beer, but this is the flagship beer so must be their intention.medium body and low carb and semi dry finish.I don't really care for this one."

"overall - i really dig what they've done with this...it doesn't really match a set style but that's just fine. it's an interesting beer and worth a try. fatigues after too much but worth a glass!"
"Recommended serving: Around a campfire at sunset with 3 good friends and a faithful dog."
"A very enjoyable beer just slightly off to keep it from being rated higher."
"billed as a ""stout"" incorrectly by the bar i was at, it was instead a strong dark ale. hides its ABV deceptively well, very drinkable, but very forgettable. VERY sweet through a cherry/plum/raisin-y note. where its ABV is hidden by the lack of heat, perhaps it comes out in this sweetness. the sweetness, however, was not accompanied by a thick or syrupy mouthfeel - it was rather thin."
"- This is a great brew. If you are looking for a perfectly drinkable creamy smooth dark ale.. this is it. This would be gold on nitro I am guessing."
"D - Nice; I dig this beer; I would have a another, but not too many"
"O If there was ever a reason for me to want to live in the Northwest, this beer is it. One of the best comfort ales I have run across. Yum!!"
"Overall I say this is a good beer that is quite unique and well worth trying, it is an enjoyable drink and at 7.8% it will put you in a good place. So if you are in Ellensburg it is worth getting a bottle."
"This is the best brown ale I have ever drank. Superb flavor and drinkability. The beer has a wonderful almost chocalately sweet smoothness. I had it out the bottle for the first time last night and it was almost as good as it is on tap. Pricey, but well worth it."
"Full pour, minimal head and significant lacing. Medium brown almost opaque darkness, no visible carbonation. Tan head what there is, significant lacing. Nose is faint milk chocolate and even more faint floral hops. Taste is on the sweet side, chocolate is more prominent than nose, floral hops are well hidden on back end, a bit of roast not coffee, more carafan-ish than roast, hops subsumed by big malt mill. Mouthfeel on the light side of medium, medium effervescence. Drinkability above average, served too damn cold despite room temperature glass. Overall not that great, lacking in hop and roast character."
"A pretty messy beer. I would hardly call it a double stout, more like a big Irish stout. A lot of alcohol is present which really distracts some of the other aromas and flavors. Not a fan."
"Aroma had a little bit of peat to it, as if a red or brown. Taste, very smooth, hid the alcohol well, toffee malt feel for it. I liked it, drank this with over a year of age on it, nice and rich. Advertised as smooth, and I would agree. This one went great with enchiladas, covered up the spiciness well."
"Drinkability is fine; I've enjoyed it. This doesn't at all seem like an imperial stout to me; maybe more of a Scottish ale or some such. Regardless, it's pretty solid. Rating doesn't reflect imperial stout as the style."
"Overall a great beer though it is not an imperial stout. Worth seeking out."
"D - I would rate this sky high given how great it tastes, and the fact that I would have never guessed this to be nearly 8%. Drinks like 5% and I downed it pretty fast. A go-to stout."
"Definitely give this a try if you're in eastern Washington (state)!"
"The mouthfeel is thick, but not particularly exciting. Overall, a pretty good beer. I haven't had enough stout to compare it to, unfortunately."
"D- Very easy to drink, yet won't fill you up like drinking a case of Macro lagers will to get the same buzz."
"I could drink this beer forever. It is excellent."
"D: I'm gonna have to go ahead and disagree with the style on this one...this is more like a double Irish red or something. This is a great beer...was a little bit hesitant to get it cause I don't really like imperial stouts..its very far from that, a very tasty brew."
"This one is very intersting. It is described on the bottle as a dark ale and I would be inclined to agree. I'll not say I'm a big fan of the feel on this one but the taste and drinkability are high. It's so easy drinking it almost seems wrong to be associated with death. If only death would go down this easy!"
"Poured a deep red color with lots of brown gues and a small white head. Nose is dry with rich fruits, candy sugar and chocolate and perhaps some peat. Taste follows nose prewtty close, big malt, syrupy, booze, chocolate, caramel.Very drinkable!"
"D- i wanted to merely sip this one, but it just wouldn't let me"
"I have described this beer as an American Guinness before; it's similar in look and taste, but MORE, especially in the taste area. It's rich and malty, with an herbal tinge and a touch of bright hoppiness. The mouthfeel is pretty average for this style, kinda chewy and sticky. Drinkablility is like tap Guinness, in that you can't really chug it but it leaves you wanting your next sip. This beer works great with a burger at the Palace here in Ellensburg, and I'm sure others as well."
"Drinkability: this beer is not bad but not exactly a session brew."
"Drinkablity: This is not really an Imperial Stout. Not a normal beer actually and a little hard to define. But this beer...is damn good."
"D - I kinda tried to ignore the taste, it was just so darn strong... otherwise pretty enjoyable!"
"A beer worth seeking out. A job well done Jim."
"D: Tempting to have more, once the palate gets used to the malty sweetness. The need to categorize this beer leads me to disagree with the 'Double/Imperial Stout' that the first reviewer settled upon...Strong Ale (a catch-all term if ever there was one...) could work...were there a little more peat/smoke I could be swayed toward 'Wee Heavy' (and what with a name like 'Irish Death' perhaps a sideward glance at the Scots?). Heck, my wife even thought it 'tasted' like a quad', but much thinner. Suffice to say, this beer won't appeal to the hop-lovers, but it's one of the more intriguing and -yes- style-defying beers I've had in a while. I liked it well enough and give it a nod for a try - not quite the ringing endorsement, but so be it."
"The flavor was rich, and had a nice taste. The texture was nice, not too thin, had a richness to it, like you would expect from a good stout. The taste rolled nicely on the tongue."
"Pours black with a large tan head and fair amount of sticky lacings. Aroma is fine just not very robust. Taste is sweet, dark, with a fair hop load. Never would have guessed this was an Impy Stout. Tastes more like a strong ale. Decent drink and the alcohol is well hidden."
"Drinkability not good. Drain pour, for both myself & the wife. Too bad."
"Taste is um... interesting. Very sharp, stabbing sweetness quickly followed by a medicinal tang. No deeper notes in the aftertaste. Mouth feel is quite thin. Not what I'd call a stout, exactly (I expect a heavier mouth feel and more body to the taste)."
"Drinkable for a taste and mouthfeel perspective, but a little high on ABV to be sessionable. Still a couple are nice."
"Again, this is certainly not a stout by any measure, and I don't just mean in termsof quality. I'm not sure where the style label came from."
"I was certain this beer was not a Double Stout as soon as I sipped it, really seems more like a Scotch Ale, or Baltic Porter, no real characteristics that stick out to categorize it as any American Double Stout that I am familiar with. Very roasted, almost burn malt flavors mix with a complex interplay of mildly estery yeasts and alcohol. Finish leaves a slightly grainy taste i the mouth and is not smooth at all, softly carbonated in the start and dry and loose in the finish. Not as bad as I am sort of building this beer up to be, as I like that this beer is not an over-hopped monster and does not rely on gimmicks like coffee and chocolate to present itself. A pretty good malt centric beer that I feel suffers in being considered a Double Stout. Worth a shot for malt fans."
"Poured a dark brown color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of roastiness, earthy, chocolate, and some nuttiness. Tastes of roastiness, earthy, chocolate, caramel, and toasty. This one was roasty all the way around."
"Truly a lousy beer. Grimly drinkable. Seems like this brewery has gone quality skydiving."
"Anyway, the beer is very sweet, with some cherry flavor coming out. Not hoppy at all. Too sweet and sticky in the mouth for me."
"Started out like a porter but finished up a stout. Strong from the alcohol but very drinkable."
"Appearance is dark like coffee with light head and lace. Smell has the aroma of rich dark fruits and molasses. Taste of dark bitter coffee with a light sweetness of molasses. Mouthfeel is thick and silky with a light spike of carbonation. A great find and loving that it's local."
"Enjoyable, I liked this because it was not on the sweet side. Seemed more like a porter than a dark ale."
"Taste is big and rich. Hello? Hops? Where are you? Some rich overripe fruit, and bam, lots of chocolate and sugary goodness. Some alcohol, no roasty coffee, just rich milky sweet chocolate. Like I said, a good beer, but for an outdoor summer brewfest...meh."
"Overall impressions: Very good, with a bonus of being locally brewed! Surprisingly, this is an Imperial Sweet Stout according to Iron Horse...wow just wow...this is a great style if that's the case. It tasted like a nut brown ale to me."
"D: For an 8% ABV brew it was easy to drink. It was refreshing and light-bodied."
"Currently not available in bottles, QuilterÂ’s pours on tap at the brewery where half-gallon growler fills are a mere $6. Highly recommended if you find yourself in the Ellensburg area."
