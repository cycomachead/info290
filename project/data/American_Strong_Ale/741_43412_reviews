"Pours a ruddy mahogany color with a soapy head and plenty of lace. Aroma is fully malty and has just a kiss if smoke. Reminds me of the smell of a mild aged scotch but of course faintly. In the taste, malty with some piney, resinous hops providing expert balance. Toast, caramel, brown sugar and hops. Disguises the alcohol very well. Full bodied with a soft carbonation, wasnt pouring well but drank just fine. Overall this is a smooth American Strong Ale, can hit with the best of them."

"Mellow spice in the hops with much attention devoted to a burnt sugar, caramel, semi-fruity malt. Earthiness builds in the middle with more hop flavor than bitterness, and enough of it to go around. A little bit more of that chocolate is going a long way. More than smacked by a blanket of kilned barley malt and dark fruit nuances. Pleasant with a subtle sweetness that I adore. Booze is not head-rearing, but steady and somber. It's a great drink for almost 9%. Carbonation is on-key, and the body is buttery and filled-out to great effect. Premium mouthfeel for an Imperial Amber. No points docked for style, either. Would order this over most strong ales and barleywines that meet near the middle of the Venn Diagram. Awesome."

"Overall its a shame I paid so much I do have Vintage Estate which would probably charge around 2 bucks for this. I would easily pay 12 dollars a six pack no questions asked."

"Surprisingly really good, not normally a lake front fan. Nice grapefruit aroma with a bit of pine. Deep russet hue. Medium bodied, a little slick, bright back end hop character with enough sweet caramel malt to balance. Almost bitter sweet. Some dried fruit notes A nice little find. Bitterness is clean and refreshing, alcohol is well hidden, flavors are well blended and concise."
"This is a strong strong ale. Booze is certainly forward. By the name and style, though, it's to be expected. If you're in the mood for a strong sipper, this is a solid choice!"
""
""
"This one is smooth with a hop malt balance. Smooth means ""silky"" in the mouthfeel. The flavors are well blended. It poured well and it made a pretty carbonated greeting. it's balanced, but not idiosyncratic. I want to rave, but it's just good."
""
""
""
" Overall, this is a solid beer and it's definitely worth a try if you like smooth, malty brews. I don't know that I'd pick it up again, but i'm not disappointed in it either."

"Overall, not my favorite style but perhaps my favorite beer of this style. Very flavorful and smooth."

"Overall this is a good strong ale, very clean and tasty flavor. Might not be the most complex thing ever, but it's drinkable and delicious."
""
"Overall, I like this. It's got a good level of complexity, but nothing out of control. Great balance of toasted malt, hops, and sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a good sessionable ale (if your're looking to get loopy fast), if not particularly special or memorable"
""
""
"Overall I believe this would be a better beer if the booze was dialed down, surprising at 8.5% the alcohol was so prevalent. As the beer came to room temperature is was much more enjoyable."
""
""
"O/D - Decent strong ale. Tame in the hop department, but tasty enough. Not breaking new ground at all, but tasty enough."
"This is a rich tasting brew but too much taste from the alcohol. I enjoyed the balance of malt and hops. I wished that I had cellared this one to mellow the alcohol and intentsifed the tasted. I think the potential is there."

"Now why would you wanna go and burn your bridges? Anyway, this stuff pours a clear topaz topped by a finger of light khaki foam. The nose comprises mild caramel, mixed greens, and very light maple syrup. The taste brings in more of the same, eliciting a flavor of syrup-covered greens. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a decent brew, though nothing to really get excited over."
"O- an average tasting brew. Seemed more like a strong amber than strong ale. Nothing to write home about."
"Every aspect of this one is just too blunt to me. One harsh note after another, but nothing really hangs together. Sorry, but not to my taste."
""
""

"Drinking Bridge Burner you get the impression that with this offering the brewery really wanted to impress; being able to discern where the hops end and the malts start is a task both Herculean and arcane, like knowing all the constellations or differentiating between sub-species of moths. What does it matter? This has plenty of both and that's all you need know."
"Overall - An enjoyable strong ale by Lakefront. I like the stronger malt backbone with the hops playing the supporting role. Nice to find other American craft offerings in Calgary."
"A bottle into a tulip. The Bridge Burner is dark copper witha thick tan head. The aroma is citrus, a little fresh pine, molasses, sweet dark sugar, and slightly like sweet fruit punch (think about it, it's there). On the palate, a little more roasted barley character is present, with a good hit of lemon and a balanced bitterness. Not a lot of heat - though the alcohol heat is present - and overall a fairly rich, creamy body. Little lingering taste of chocolate, malt, and brown sugar. American Strong Ales are always such a mixed bag, this one comes close to being the American Ale equivalent of a Belgian Dubbel. Very much worth a try."
""
"Bottle: Poured a dark black color ale with a large dark foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma consists of dry roasted malt with some resin and citrus hops. Taste is a mix between some roasted malt notes with dry notes and some pine and citrus hops punch. Body is quite full with somewhat of a creamy texture and good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Well balanced with good hops punch"
"Deep opaque burgundy, khaki head with moderate retention and a good bit of lace. Strong toffee and malt character, hops are there too and have some citrus and spice to them. More malt on the palate, alcohol, toffee, dark fruits and a bit of sweetness. Some roast and hops in the finish, roast and some chocolate bitterness lingers. Some sweetness and alcohol on the back end. Medium full feel, medium carbonation. Interesting, and saw faint comparisons to Arrogant Bastard can be drawn."
""
""
""
"M - Medium body. Creamy with some nice sticky hop oils. Light to moderate carbonation."
""
""
"This is a bit of a mess of a beer. A nice mess, but hard to pick apart. Complex malt backbone duking it out with brash hops. I really like this one. Fun to explore."
""
""
""
"O - A delicious brew, full of flavour and well worth seeking out. Easy drinking and an ABV that is incredibly well hidden. I thoroughly enjoyed this brew and will be grabbing a few extra bottles before they disappear."
"A very flavorful and drinkable strong ale, really liked this one."
"(3.75) D: A solid American Strong Ale with a full and earthy flavour and a gritty texture to match."
"Brownish red body, 2 fingers of off white head, good amount of lace and retention here. Smell is fairly hop forward, some citrus, lots of sharp pine, sweet malts and caramel both present, mostly hops though, grapefruit and orange toward the end along with some bready-toffee notes. Taste is sweet and malty, bit of chocolate flavour, piney-dank weedy hops, moderately bitter throughout, some fruits in the mix most noteably cherry, citrus and caramel mid palate, malty and piney finish. Medium carbonation, lightish body and pretty watery at points also. This was pretty solid, lots going on here in terms of flavour, more body and softer carbonation would have gone a long way here but still a very drinkable beer."
"Overall â€“ Lots of flavours going on here. I don't really like the strawberry/guava type fruitiness in there but the rest of it works well. I picked up a few bottles thinking I could age them, but I'm not sure that will work out well."
"For the price (under 6), it's a solid brew I will come back to while it's here. Nice hoppy ale."
"Have read others describing this as a ""messy"" beer - and I think that's a good description - but it's a messiness I'm really enjoying. May be time to book a trip to Milwaukee..."
"Light to medium body, medium carbonation with a sticky finish."
""
""
"Overall, some nice aspects. but the body does not work and the flavours are a bit out of balance."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A pretty good offering from LFB, but it leaves me wanting more from it. A bit more assertive and not so safe in the hop/malt combination. LFB doesn't seem to take too many risks, which may be a good thing."
""
""
"An easy drinker for an 8% beer, this was nicely done."
""
""
"This is a pretty good beer. I like what Milwaukee put together in this one."
""
""
""
""
"O- This was a nice strong ale. Nothing amazing that really stood out, but an easy to drink enjoyable strong ale that I could easily have again. I'd definitely recommend checking it out if you get the chance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light bodied with a sharp, edgy beginning. This brew agrees with me but my thought here is that is that it doesn't quite have the base to really age well in the cellar. This is evident by the lack of smooth transitions from one flavor to another."
""
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Nice balanced American Strong Ale with a good malty backbone and a nice hop profile."
""
""
"D - Not bad, better than I expected in fact, especially after seeing the copious amounts of floaters that ended up in the glass. The malt character was relatively complex and well balanced with and it is pretty drinkable for the alcoholic strength."
"Overall: nicely complex. certainly better than I was expecting. Definitely worth trying."
"O - While a very broad spectrum, Bridge Burner seems to embody an American Strong Ale well; great caramel malt base with sweetness and strong American hoppiness for bold, assertive flavor and character. The body seems a little weak for how potent the beer ends up being in the long run, but a bomber of this will certainly get your fist in the air to viva la revolucion!"
"O: A balanced drinker for its weight. Nicely done."
""
"Taste is very roasted malt. Notes of chocolate, bitterness and sweetness round out the taste. This is very easy and pleasant to drink. Mouth feel is pretty heavy but acceptable for the type of beer this is. Very worthy."

"Mouthfeel was sweet and a little bit funky. Really enjoyed it."

"22oz bottle, shared with a friend. Pours chestnut brown in color, topped with a frothy tan colored head that leaves good lacing on the glass. Aromas are malty with brown sugar and caramel filling the nose. Tastes are malty up-front as well with caramel, chocolate, brown sugar, and molasses followed by some resiny, piny hop and citric notes; good complexity. Medium bodied with ample carbonation. Goes down nicely. Overall, this is a brewery I have not had much from, but this special reserve ale was a good pickup & worth the try."
""
""
""
"Poured this greedily and a little too cold right out of the fridge with a decent, foamy, frothy, tan head that soon subsided to a light cover and lots of lace. Color is a hazy to cloudy/opaque depending on width of the glass, amber brown. Aroma is an interesting heady mix of malt, yeast, hop, dark ripe fruit, leather, funk, hint of cocoa. Flavor's like nose, very slightly sweet, lots of bitter and good carbonic tang. Body is full, bitterness stands out on back of tongue, carbonation is just right. Finish is like flavor with the bitterness lasting a while along with some boozy warmth. Big beer."
""
""
"Save this one for dessert or when the weather is cooler weather. Strong bodied with lots of fruit, plums in particular. It had been sitting in the beer fridge for about four months, so it may have lost any hop characteristics, as there were very little to be found. A pleasant drink, nonetheless. Think a tawny port, but with less than half the ABV, less sweet, and darker. Fluffy head and an aroma that matches its flavor. Medium high carbonation make this one fun drink."
"If this beer is what an American strong Ale is then I am in. I have to sit and think about what I am drinking since the profile is so varied. Brilliant. What an experience, different. Probably will be a favorite."

"O - Delicious beer that is fairly ambiguous, but regardless it is quite tasty."
""

"Tastes a little similar to a very good Scottish Ale. The more I think about it, the more I realized I liked it - a lot. Would like more of this but haven't seen it around here. Picked it up at John's Market in Portland."
""
""
""
"Salud!"
"D: Not a session brew but excellent."
""
"I love Lakefront brewery, especially their tour, but this one in bomber format and pricing isn't something I see myself returning too. Nice to score something from Milwaukee at Ben's in Reno though."
"Pours a clear, dark amber color. 2/3 inch head of an off-tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, slight caramel malt, slight dark citrus, hint of yeast, and a hint of hop. Fits the style of an American Strong Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, roasted malt, slight hop, slight alcohol, hint of wheat, hint of dark citrus, and a hint of caramel malt. Overall, good appearance, aroma, blend, complexity, and body."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a muddy red-brown with a tiny head that doesn't last for long. Aroma is a nice piney hop over big caramel malts and dark fruits. Taste kinda reminds me of a less alcoholic barleywine, with a bit more hoppiness than is normal for the style. The mouthfeel is full, and the drinkability is good. Overall, a solid strong ale for a solid price."
"O - This could use some time to mellow out. A bit too sweet and boozy."
"If it looks like, smells like, and tastes like a DIPA, then it must be so? No? Two out of three for the win? Ah well, it's got more big-ass hopitude packed into those 45 IBUs than a lot of actual DIPAs I've recently come across. Tasty, American, strong, and ale - got it."
"O - similar to an esb, damn good"
"Mouthfeel: A strong burn out of this strong ale which is a pleasure to drink. The sticky carbonation left my mouth with a light roasted feeling which I enjoyed."
"overall: Not sure if i got a bad bottle or what. i see lots of good reviews from reviewers i respect but this one's not happenin."
"Slainte."
"Great dark color awesome tan head that sticks to the glass... fruity, hoppy nose really makes me think I'm going to enjoy this... fruity, sweet, not as hoppy as promised by the label and the smell still tasty. Very slight alcohol back to let you know it's 8% ... Mouthfeel is thin, smooth could easily drink a couple of these though I think I'd be over the sweetness at some point. Overall enjoyable beer. Got this in a 4 bomber sampler pack. Looking forward to trying the others"
"D= Insanely drinkable. Though I wanted it to be this or that as I drank it, at the end of the day this is a really drinkable beer that hides its alcohol and inspires one to drink it down and then look for more."
"O - amazing nose, a little too hot, a little too thin, still delicious and complex"
"average strong, a bit like a malt liquor with some chocolate flavouring.Not so drinkable. WOuld like some more hops which would be more like the style."
"O- Overall, Bridge Burner is a solid beer that is worth a try."
"Just about full bodied, it shows relatively well balanced notes of malty caramel, grains, but still heavier on the bitter hoppiness, grassy and fruity. Quite nice, better than expected. For whatever reason, coincidence or not, their large bottles/bombers bring better beers than the small ones."
"M: Smooth, deceiving given the high ABV. I could get in trouble with this one. Creamy and friendly with just a hint of the alcohol."
"Cheers!"
"D - A very well crafted beer by lakefront. I'm proud of this Wisconsin brewery, and this is a brew I would recommend to anybody that appreciates good craft beer."
"Drink- This was a beer I saw and hey its probably a rare find out of state and didnt tell anyone then went to my Total Wine in Brea and they had and went F**k!! Oh well still tasty."
"BB is far too light in body to compete objectively with Arrogant Bastard and the rest, but it could easily carve a niche into the drinking repertoire of someone who enjoys a stronger, more assertive brew without sacrificing drinkability. Give this a shot."
"Thanks to Ratman (I think?) for sharing a bottle of this one with us a while back. Poured a hazy, rusty amber color with a smallish tan head. Aromas of caramel, toffee, milk chocolate and toasted malt. On the palate, this one was medium bodied, with flavors of caramel, light hops, toasted malt and chocolate."
"Medium bodied with a balance of bitter, earthy hops, sweet citrus notes and roasted malt. Dry and bitter up front with hints of grass and pine but this is quickly countered by the fruit notes and sweet malt character. Hints of grapefruit and orange peel along with some other light fruit notes followed by some caramel, toffee, chocolate and hazelnut. Slightly roasty but not enough to overshadow the other notes. Complex with a well masked ABV, resulting in a pretty quaffable beer."
"O: I enjoyed this very much. I am wondering whether this is a dark DIPA, with all its hoppy goodness. Whatever it is, I like it and look forward to more. Well done, Lakefront!"
"I can tell this had a decent ABV on it, usually when I can detect it, it tends to ruin it, not in this case. A nice looking tasty brew. I'm certainly going to try this again in the near future."
"getting some more of these for that price."
"Overall a great beer. I liked it quite a bit and would definitely have it again."
"D: Considering the ABV, and that might be coming through a little in the taste, this beer isn't bad, but it's not great."
"D: This is a nice surprise from Lake Front; nice work, guys"
"The mouthfeel has a dense body with a smooth texture. This is filling, in a good way. I want to call this a barleywine. It has all the flavor and body, but the ABV is a little on the low side for a barleywine. I guess you could say it stands in the middle of the bridge between a strong ale and a barleywine."
"Overall an enjoyable beer, probably not one of my first choices when buying, but definitely worth a go every once in awhile."
"this hit the spot -- i would call it a solid beer. tasted fresh and right. i would go for it again if i wanted that IPA/Hop bite on top of a slightly deeper, richer malt base. good stuff."
"Pours a fairly-dark brown color with a thin light tan head with pretty good retention. The nose yields a bit of strong malt sweetness along with some dark fruits. There's a bit of light cherry lingering in the background as well. Mild brown sugar. The flavor is fruity and sweet. Not too much complexity, but a nice combination. Mouthfeel is medium with a bit of booze. Overall, pretty good. I wouldn't mind tried this aged out a bit further."
"Overall, this is an awesome brew. According to the owner, this beer was a seasonal, but it has become so popular they are going to make it year round."
"D: Very nice, probably the best Lakefront beer I have had so far. Couldn't have more than 1 bomber, the alcohol is well hidden. Worth seeking out and trying."
"M & D - starts a bit sweet, finishes dry. Easy to drink. Good overall."
"Drinkability-Smooth and flavorful with some heat of alcohol. Overall quite pleasant."
"Would love to try a fresher bottle just to see what the diff is. I'm guessing more hops, but also a bit hotter booze-wise..."
"Overall, a really good beer but I would probably reach past it on the shelf to grab another beer if I saw it again. It just didn't have the taste to push it over the top for me."
"Another solid limited release form Lakefront."
"Muddled my way through the glass. Not a good beer"
"D: For drinkability we have a fulfilling red that sits high on the side of flavor with an ample bitternessand body with a dry well being. Great downer and very good example per style,(again drinks like a red) no hesitation for repeat and six pack purchase."
"A good strong ale at an excellent price tag. Well done Lakefront!"
"I really couldn't tell from the label what kind of beer this is (unless I missed it!) but after tasting it its definitely a strong ale. Pours deep, dark mahogany, clear with creamy tan head and great retention and massive lacing. Smell was of malt, caramel, and a sweetness, perhaps a slight hops but I didn't notice much. This beer definitely is great if you're a malt lover. The taste was sweet and malty, more of a roasted malt, some sweet ripe fruit and a caramel kick to it as well. I personally hardly noticed the hops. Maybe the first few sips, but eventually the malt took over. Mouthfeel was fuller, but not too thick, very smooth and it leaves a nice slick feeling. Overall a great beer. No complaints really and the ABV is very well hid. I just wish the hops stood out a little more."
"The hops in this are reminiscent of a West-Coast, namely Lagunitas, profile. Fat Tire crossed with Hairy Eyeball, maybe? Maybe leaning toward an Arrogant Bastard. But even more enjoyable than that one has become. Not sure, but for <$5 (I recall?) this was a great buy. And would be a nice staple in the market out here. I liked it."
"D. Drinkable. Overall a pretty good beer. Nice aroma. Interesting flavor. Kind of a beer that falls between a couple different styles. I guess that is why it is placed in the Strong Ale category."
"This beer was a cola colored brown with a cream colored head. The smell was malty, sweet, some brown sugar. The taste was sweet and malty, toffee tones and maybe a spice undertone. The mouthfeel was warming with a medium body. This beer was enjoyable. Nice tasty beer."
"Big, bold and drinkable. This one grew on us real fast; nothing over the top, but loads of flavor packed into this beer. Balanced and a joy to drink, which makes this a little dangerous at 8-percent abv."
"I havent had many Lakefront beer,the ones I have had have been sorta pedestrian.Poured a medium shade of brown with a decent sized white head atop that left broken lace as it settled in my impy nonic.Aromas are great,a mix of big caramel malt and pine/citrus hops,its American strong ale thru and thru in my mind.Flavors start out great,a smack of resiny hop mixed with some caramel and brown sugar,the finish though is abrupt and lacking.The mouthfeel is a bit thin and takes away from the flavors in my opinion.Its pretty good but could be great,glad I tried it."
"Being from Milwaukee and having tasted many of Lakefront's beers I was looking forward to trying the Bridge Burner since I enjoy many of their other styles. Poured into snifter glass. Appearance was a nice Amber Color with generous white head. Appearance however, is where the enjoyment ended for me. Smell was a very sharp earthiness of dry grass, leaves and twigs. Not a memorable scent. I could taste a little bit of caramel, but it was over shadowed by such a sharp hoppy bitterness and overburnt taste that I wasn't able to enjoy it. Maybe its the Strong Ale style that I am just not a fan of, but I just had trouble getting much enjoyment out of it. The mouthfeel had dry citrus/lemon with a hint of pine, but nothing memorable. I tasted way too much alcohol for my liking and not enough balance with the caramel and other fruit/earth flavors. Maybe it was too much carbonation. I don't know, but to me it lacked balance. I wasn't able to finish the 22oz bottle which is rare. I am by no means a American Strong Ale expert, but it was something I will not be trying again. I'm going to try some other ASAs and see if its just the style I'm not a fan of vs this particular beer."
"Sticky and full bodied, a fairly big beer that seems like an imperial amber, a la nugget nectar. Sweet sticky specialty malt, resinous hop bitterness, piney and fruity notes. Not too heavy, but still a sipper. Medium to low carbonation, smooth feel to it. Pretty substantial hop character that's well integrated overall. Will pick this up again..."
"drinkability is good but the might be a little too sweet for me to drink an entire bomber"
"(D)- A solid to great beer with just an overall good taste and feel. Refreshing, yet a tad rich, fitting for the fall time too. An overall good beer for anytime of the year. A far better drinkable beer in a style that I typically find is not. Well done Lakefront!"
"Drinkability: if you are in the mood for a malt heavy beer this is it, but it comes across a bit to sweet for my liking in a strong ale."
"This brew pour brilliantly clear deep mahogany with a deep ruby hue and a thick, sticky tan head. The aroma is moderate-high citrus and piney hop and a medium-low sweet caramel malt aroma in the background. The flavor is quite complex, medium-high hop flavor, pine, citrus, and floral with moderate hop bitterness. Beneath the hops there is a moderate malt backbone -- malty caramel, a bit of burnt sugar and a hint of smoke. Carbonation is medium and body full. Overall a hoppy amber ale that is complex and hides its 8% ABV remarkably well."
"Picked this up by random accident, label caught my eye, and picked up a sampler pack before and was pleased. Deep deep amber pour with a big billowy head. Big malts dominate this beer, didn't get that much hop balance, but not a problem. Boozy undertones remind you of the 8%. Overall very good beer and glad I stumbled on it."
"It's easy to drink and Ill finish the bomber, but I wouldn't recommend picking this one up at this point in the game. It hasn't aged terribly well."
"D - Bridge Burner is a pretty good... um, I guess a Strong Ale. Since there was nothing on the label indicating the style, I assumed ""hoppy amber"". Whatever it is, it's a pretty solid, tasty brew with a nice mouthfeel."
"I enjoyed this well-balanced American Strong Ale from Lakefront. Easily my favorite from the brewery."
"D: With more balance this beer goes down really smooth, as such it takes a little more effort, but i'm certainly not choking it down. Overall its a pretty solid offering."
"Murky looking crimson brown body. Thin and bubbly beige head. Lace etches my glass in nicely spaced rings. Aroma is piney and sprucy and brings out a spiked punch aspect to it as well, which I like in strong and old ales. I'll tell you what. This beer has got some character. Best beer I've had in a while from Lakefront. It's actually pretty subtle but complex. The pine and spruce are subtle and not overbearing in the least and mix nicely with the tropical fruit tones and underlying toffee/nougat malt base. Alcohol is detectable but only in trace amounts, which ain't too bad for an 8% beer. Body is hitting light-medium at best. And the carbonation is quite reserved. Very enjoyable beverage."
"D- A high ABV that is somewhat noticeable when it warms, makes this a one bomber and done beer. A good winter beer and one that I think would age well. Every time I lift my glass to drink the smell says IPA and the taste says something completely different."
"I'm editing as of 05/18/10, the booziness has definitely calmed, and the hops flavor is still here."
"The taste is similar, malty-syrupy up front with caramelised orange peel, candied orange, dark rummy raisin syrup (for Turks out there, a bit like rum mixed with pekmez). It's quite sweet, almost cloying from the start, but the sweetness does not get worse, thankfully, and the character, plus light hoppy bitterness and the warm alcoholic spiciness moderate this a bit. However, it is still almost cloying, it's a bit rough, very thick and oily, and rather one-dimensional, the character strong and bold but lacking depth or complexity. The oiliness gets worse and becomes too slick and thick as it warms and a rough meatiness soon develops. It is somewhat enjoyable, but only in small amounts and it's very heavy."
"Drinkability: As others have pointed out, very similar to Arrogant Bastard, which is not among my favorites; just too sticky for my palate"
"This to me seems like a bit of a Barleywine with the volume turned down. It's still good though, and would be even better fresh. Recommended."
"A rather intriguing offering from the Klisch brothers. After reading the interesting label I pour a generous amount of beer from my bomber into a Lakefront pint glass. Whoa! A slightly aggressive pour results in a solid two inches of thick beige head that would make a rootbeer proud. After it settles the amount of sticky lace on my glass is just as impressive. The aroma is spicy malt and hops. Sort of peppery with a sweet fruit hint. The flavor is rich malt and bitter hop. The flavor is spicy as well. Caramel,sweet fruit,pepper,chocolate even a hint of coffee. The alcohol come through on the finish. Lots goin on here. Very flavorful and robust. Medium to full body. Plenty of carbonation. This is probably the most flamboyant beers I've ever had from Lakefront. This is a good thing. I'm sure I will run into this beer around town. Lucky for me."
"Lakefront is a better brewery than my memory gives them credit for. Holiday Spice Lager, Riverwest Stein Beer, IPA, Cream City Pale Ale and White Beer are all solid. This one is as well. Next time I'll drink it fresh and hoppy. Bottom line: Bridge Burner is a barn burner of an American strong ale."
"Aroma of a stronge pale ale - lots of spicy hop mixed with a good malt presence. Same with the quaff, with bits of doughy wood resin mixed in for good measure. Nothing strong ale about this one - it's a hop bomber, but a darn tasty one. 8% is well hidden, I'd have no problem recommending this one to try. Glad I got the chance to try it here as it's a new brewery reaching the area."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable brew. Definitely one of the better efforts put out by Lakefront."
"D - Smooth-drinking with a very interesting flavor profile. I was pleasantly surprised by this brew and hope I can try some more from Lakefront in the future."
"D) Delicious. I'd definitely have another. Well crafted with a good balance between malts and hops."
"This beer pours a dark amber color. The head is two inches in height, and recede slowly into a sticky ring of lacing. The aroma is a perfect balance of caramel malt and citrus hops. The problem is that it is very faint. The taste is a mirror image of the aroma; nice but faint. Honestly, from what I detect this beer is very simple so even if it were more pronounced I still don't think I'd like it much. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a texture that is a little thin and watery for the style. Overall, this is a beer that is truly lacking. It surely reinforces my previous conclusions that Lakefront brews really good lagers, and really poor ales."
"This was a very nice surprise. I've never had anything from this brewery and was going out on a limb to try something new. I wasn't disappointed. At the risk of sounding blasphemous, this kind of reminded me of Arrogant Bastard. Not as robust, maybe AB light?"
"Definitely one of the better Lakefront beers I've had. Pours dark amber with a very thin head. Smells citrusy and a bit piney with a lot of firm malt and a slight nuttiness. The taste is rich and thick with malt, and quite creamy but not too sweet. Lots of piney hops followed by a touch of malty sweetness on the back end. A bit thick in the mouth but quite smooth. Big, and with lots of hops and a fair bit of alcohol, but it's all well supported by the malt."
"Probably the best Lakefront Brew I've yet had. Here's to more!"
"Overall a nice version of the style. If they do it again, I would hope for more hop aroma and a more ""fresh hop"" flavor instead of this ""old IPA"" thing. Still not bad at all."
"Overall: Good beer, actually like it more then some other ""American Strong Ales"" such as The Hairy Eyeball."
"Pours a dark amber almost brown color with a frothy white head. Strong caramel malt and hop aroma. Medium bodied with a great balance between the big hop and malt flavors both of which last until you take that next sip. This would be an excellent session beer except the high alcohol content will put you on your butt if you drink the whole 22 oz. bottle. Best enjoyed with a friend."
"D: Complex and tasty, Bridge Burner is a special reserve sipper brewed with fierce integrity."
"Murky brown (Dubbel like) appearance was not all that attractive, but the head atop was beige, two finger thick and decent looking. The aroma was a lot hopper than I was expecting, as the smell of resinous hops was unmistakable. The taste matched the smell with drying bitter hop taste evident up front. Backing this up were raisin like malts that was not too sweet. The body was soft and viscous and finish very dry and chalky. A nice strong ale I would love revisiting."
"Nicely done and certainly worth a try if you're a fan of Stone's Arrogant Bastard."
"D: This one goes down very well and executes nicely. I really dig the flavors and aromas. This beer is very much like an Arrogant Bastard type of brew, but I think that is a good thing. The ABV is somewhat high but its well hidden, keeping this from being a chore to get down. I think this beer executes well and was worth the curiousity. I am not mad at this beer."
"Creamy flavor with a small amount of sweetness. This is quickly lost in a hop bomb rush. This continues through the swallow and long into the aftertaste. The body is surprisingly thin, but it does not take away from the powerful flavors. Could be described as a weak-bodied DIPA."
"Aroma is strong and rather hoppy, but not fiercely so, with a subtle fruity undertone. It pours a clear dark coppery amber with a fairly thick, slightly yellow beige head. Flavor is hoppy but not too bitter, and has a firm undertone of orange. Texture is thick, smooth and fizzy, leaving a hop-bitter aftertaste."
"Solid brew, just not quite in my top tier."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" beige head over the clear dark copper brew. Dense head lasts well, with thick frothy lacing. Aroma is heavily sweet with piney hops. Taste follows the nose, with bitterness overpowering late. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth, cutting the bitter some, and drinkability is good as well."
"Nice beer, I would go for it again and it would make a good substitute for a brown."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this beer but after reading the label and then smelling the beer, I thought I would like it more than I actually did. However, overall, I consider it a pretty good beer that is worth drinking for a while."
"Poured a deeper and clear copper color with a large sized off white head. Aromas of citrus, caramel, some floral hoppiness, and just a tad fruity. Tastes of caramel, citrus, some spicy hops, and some fruitiness. The body was a little on the thinner side. Lacing left on the glass."
"The beer goes well with spicy food."
"This is a solid brew from Lakefront. It's nice to see them start bottling some special release type brews and the price tag is nice compared to others within the same alcohol range. I'd pick this up again."
"D- This beer has some interesting depth to the hops but the malt flavors are a bit off and not really that big. I don't think age would help this at all."
"D - Like a subdued barleywine but very nice and extremely drinkable for a strong ale. Different from the regular lineup of Lakefront beers. Nice to see them venture in a different direction."
"Drinkability: Not a bad little ASA. Far and away, it's my favorite thing to come out of Lakefront."
"D-A big, beefy, spicy malt bomb. Lotsa sweet malt but enough spce to keep things from getting carried away with sweetness. A very generous offering while taking the spectacular Lakefront Brewery tour."
"d - Just 'cause I'm not digging it, I wouldn't drink another."
"Very nice, very drinkable. I am glad I have a bomber."
"D-My friend had no problem putting this down, but I was unable."
"Pours a clear darker brown. Nose is alcohol and wood. Flavor is nice. Smooth with cherry, wood, and sweet tones. Not really complex, but it's workin'. Nicer as it warms. Feel is sticky and smooth and a bit silky as well. Nice to drink. This might be interestng on cask."
"overall this brew resembles the anniversary brew, only less meaty and less salty. not a bad brew for a BBQ, but a little too salty for casual drinking."
"D- pretty damn tasty. this is actually on cask at the great taste tomorrow which should be outstanding for this, so just another thing to get more excited about"
"D: Damn drinkable. The best beer I have ever had from Lakefront."
"I bought this 22oz bomber at 3 Cellars in Franklin, WI."
"Some lighter fruits continue to come out as it warms, a touch of pear. But still dominated by the deep caramel. A touch of cough syrup as well, yeah, this guy's ideal serving temperature is a little lower (not a bad thing, just something worth noting. I wouldn't want to drink a Gueuze ice-cold nor would I want to drink a pilsner at room temperature, but the reverse is genius!). Treat it like a lager and it will treat you well."
"While this is certainly no Arrogant Bastard, it's still a very good beer in its own right. Dispite the hop/malt profile being a bit confusing at first take, surely one of Lakefronts better beers."
"22 ouncer, the informative back label tells me this was brewed during the first week of June, 2008. Pours a nice rich shade of dark amber/auburn, under a medium tan head that shows world class retention and then leaves extensive, frothy and well developed lace and sheeting. malty nose, with traces of honey and nuts. Smooth, tasty, bald, complex and thoroughly enjoyable ASA. Lots of nutty malts, some wood/smoke, honey, and dark bread notes. Yum. A very nice, smooth and mellow take on the style. With the 8% well in the rear, this one is well worth trying and enjoying with some chedder, bread and smoky meaty. Nice job here from Lakefront Brewing"
"D-Sort of a beer that seems lost to me. Not Powerful or rich enough for a barleywine but not malty enough for a strong ale. Not a bad hybrid, but there just seems to be a bit missing on the balance. One thing is for sure, this beer greatly improves as it warms to room temp."
"It's no face-melter, just a well-stated, balanced big ale with a lot of drinkability. I'll need to track down another to see what the deal is with the CO2...more for curiositiy's sake than redemption, as this works as it is."
