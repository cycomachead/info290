"O-A good beer, might not be worth the money but worthy trying once."

"must be the sour component.  I just can't wrap my palate around this one.  all 4 of us didn't finish our pour.  Odd, because I liked both components individually..."

"Not a good blend.  Both base beers are outstanding but this one is just not right"

"Amazing blend of two of the Bruery's best beers!"

"This beer blew my mind at the Bruery tap room. Very bummed they weren't serving growlers of it :/ 5 star"

"Thick, viscous hybrid Black Tuesday / Oude Tart Sour? Both beers on their own are delicious and world class. This was all sorts or wrong. A muddled mess whereas no flavors from each beer complimented the other. Horrible mouthfeel for any addition of brett to a beer. Argueably the worst craft offering I've had to date."

"Reddish brown and nearly flat.  Sour notes dominate with very little of the expected malt character of the stout showing through."

"Love it. Tasty and complex, unique, rich for a sour beer. Bruery is my shit!"

"O: Very tasty. The sour flavors from the Oude Tart dominate the Black Tuesday character, but it's a nice blend. Significantly easier to drink than I thought it might be. Recommended."

"This most likely is a variation of an oude tart. This one, however, has a strength that oude tart does not have. It makes it somewhat heady but very enjoyable. At the same time, this could be a regular ale, with a bit of a sour hit. Even though the flavors are different, they complement each other very well."

"This is medium to lighter bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. This is strangely 2 beers I enjoy on their own but sadly no good aspects of either come out in the blend. It is strangely herbal and bitter which I dont remember being present in the base beers. I would not be quick to revisit this one but I can see how some would really dig it."

"2013 Bottle poured cold and letting warm. Brown leather pour with ring of dirty brown head. Smell lacks of some dark fruit, leather and a hint of barrel. Taste is great but leans heavier on the oude tart than tuesday with crazy flavor mix of tart dark fruit, leather, vanilla, toffee, brown sugar leaning into a mild tart finish. Not puckering like Oude Tart. Feel is medium carb with a nice medium body."

"Bottle from my trip to the brewery (Bruery?). Batch #3 (11% abv). Pours a dark and nearly opaque red with lots of cherry red light shining through the edges. Big sour cherry and vinegar aroma, chocolate, brown sugar. Flavor is black cherry skins, a little booze, tart vinegar, some strange flavors in the background I can't put my finger on that I assume comes from the Black Tuesday. Much more body that Oude Tart and not quite as much lactic tartness. Still sour but with an expected big sweetness to go along from the blend. Plenty of carbonation. Really neat blend that works despite sounding totally weird."

"O - Mélagne No. 1 is a barrel-aged blend of Oude Tart and Black Tuesday that, through and through, feels more like Oude Tart with a splash of Black Tuesday than a blended beer. Sharp cherry skin tartness and acidic sourness are at the forefront of every aspect of this brew, chiseling away at the enamel on your teeth and subduing your tongue into #sourpower submission. Expanding on the subtle chocolate and brown sugar-like sweet hints of Black Tuesday by adding a considerable amount more would be a welcome shift in the beer's blend, really opening up it's own uniqueness rather than a feeling like a half-assed cuveé. But, BUT! You won't hear me complaining about drinking this sour-as-hell beer; it's exactly what I live for; it could just be better."

"a blend of two of the most unique and delicious beers from the bruery, thanks to drlovemd87 for busting out some cellar treats for our new years eve party. this takes everything i didnt like about oude tart (its insane acidity, its front of tongue focus, and its intense carbonation) and smooths it out with black tuesday, one of the best big stouts going. the chocolate from the stout balances the acid quite a bit, and its relative heaviness settles the carbonation down enough to make a much more drinkable, let alone interesting, beverage. still rather red in color, i wonder what percentage the blend it, probably not fifty/fifty. i think its a little oude tart heavy, as the cherry notes and burgundy sour properties come through more i think in nose and taste than the bourbon and chocolate notes of the stout, although those are what tempers the intensity of oude tart and makes me like this blend better than it. a lot less body than black tuesday on its own, the balance between sour and sweet is right on the money, and the layers of flavor keep coming long after the swallow. maybe not quite as cohesive as it could be, i still taste both beers as individuals here, but this is downright awesome beer."

"O: Overall its a highly carbonated blend of Oude tart with a stout, but hardly recognizable as Black Tuesday having anything to do with this. Id drink it again, but not a whole bottle to myself."
""
""
""
""
""
"As others have mentioned this is very Oude Tart forward but has a nice Black Tuesday backing. The additional body, roast and sweetness imparted from the stout blend well with the tartness of the Flanders red. Worthy."

"Popped this open for share, thanks Nate, about an 8 oz pour. Pours a dark brown body with a thin tan head. Smell is tart, cherries, lacto, white grapes, some bourbon, vanilla, and sweet malts. Taste is oude-tart forward with apples, grapes, cherries, and other sour fruits. Behind these flavors are the big base of black tuesday which imparts some chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla. Honestly though the black tuesday is subdued. Mouthfeel is medium, moderate carbonation, fairly smooth. Overall I'd be curious to know the proportions of the blends, this tastes like 75/25 oude tart. Regardless, it works well, I really loved this brew."

"O- A very nice beer. The sour and the big imperial stout play off of each other nicely. I would be interested to see this one as more of a 50/50 blend, but it is very nice as is."

"I can smell the fruity tartness as soon as I wrangle the bottle opener through the wax and pop the top. Tart cherries with a roasted coffee, chocolate and caramel background. Light oak and vanilla mixed with spirits. The flavor feels more stout like than the aroma lead me to believe. A solid sweet coffee caramel and chocolate with a hint of molasses and smoke. Up front I get a pleasant dark dried fruity/cherry tartness that at first seems to belong in a stout but the tartness builds towards the end of every sip. Light lactic bite and little to no hops to be found. Medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a sweet tart almost syrupy mouthfeel. This is an interesting beer, it is certainly unique and I enjoyed it. I really like both of the base beers in this blend, but I question whether the sum is greater than the parts here."

"O - I'm not sure how it falls into one category or another though. It is more like an infected stout than anything else. I think that they put too much Oude Tart in here. My issues are that the Black Tuesday does mostly nothing but add a slight amount of aroma/flavor/mouthfeel."
""
""
"Exactly what it is advertised as: a perfect blend of Oude Tart and Black Tuesday. Very tasty and unique."

"A fantastic blend. I sincerely wish I could drink this whenever I chose."
""
"Very dark, with a tinge of red. Subtle sour /sweet smell. Very nice taste - I like Melange 3 better but still pretty nice - I would say I enjoy both melange 1 and 3 better than straight BT. With this beer the sourness dominates a little more that the Black tuesday - cuts some of the sweetness. Warms up nice. In retrospect would have loved to do a side by side with Tarts of darkness. One of my favorite of the nights, the only beer I took any real notes on."
""
""
"Pours a murky dark brown with a tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. No lacing is present on this one. Smell is quite sour, funky, and tart with some vinegar aromas and slight cocoa. Taste is sour, funky, and tart up front from the Oude Tart with a subtle cocoa flavor on the finish from the Black Tuesday. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer but the Oude Tart is the more dominant beer in this blend."
""
""
""
""
""
"As blends go, the flavor of Melange 1 is a little too far toward the sour side of its ingredients. But the Black Tuesday does a nice job of rounding out the sour’s rough edges, and it feels GLORIOUS."
""
"Overall this was a pleasure to enjoy and experience this beer. When this was first released I read that the Black Tuesday was quite dominant, but with over a year of age on this now, the sour aspects are just as strong, maybe even more dominant. I am not totally sold on this beer; while it was very tasty, I think both base beers are better on their own. Definitely worth a go if you are able to acquire or sample on draft but there is no need to jump over hoops to track it down. Recommended, but not one I ever NEED to have again."
""
"Overall: Not crazy about the blend, but I am not a big fan of either base beer."

"Pours a deep ruddy brown, high tan head. The smell is sour, lots of herbal and tannic notes. Taste is very sour to start, with a robust chocolaty character as it warms. It's moderately carbonated, thick in body. All in all a good Flemish ale, though not a great stout."
"Soy sauce…wait no…fish sauce maybe? Sweet malty chocolate, like a Whopper. Grotesquely sour rotten cherries and raspberry jam gone bad (if it can go bad this is what it would taste like). Vinegar. Alcohol well hidden with a quick finish. This was pretty bad. I can't believe the reviews it gets."
"-GFunk"
"Overall: Very drinkable. Good complexity. The 9.5% ABV was well hidden."
"Dark brown with a brown head that hangs around a while, this beer looks decent. The nose is quite dominated by the Oude Tart. In fact, it's like Oude Tart Gone Wild. Seriously sour, acidic, acetic and vinegary, the bugs have gobbled up all the Black Tuesday character there is. The palate is sour, rather exceedingly so with a sharp vinegar sourness, chocolate, mild caramel and some oak. Very sharp, there's also some acetone. Medium-full in body with moderate carbonation, this is too sour for its own good. This is definitely atrocious, and split 7 ways, there was 12+ oz remaining, and at $25 a pop, an awful experience. Not recommended."
"O- I love this beer and I am very thankful to have more of it. This is going to be a beer to celebrate with and drink slowly with my brothers. A beautiful blending of two beers that manages to have an character of its own."
"O: Taste is much better than the aroma, good fruit, unique, completely different than base beers, good but not an improvement on either beer, pleasant and interesting, much better as it warms up"
"Another big thanks to my buddy Chad for opening another great (and rare) bottle. Pours a dark brown color with a reddish hue. It has an off-white head that lingers for some time. Scent is tart cherries with a profound vanilla aroma. Also a nice amount of chocolate cocoa in the nose. Taste is initially sweet chocolate with a lot of oak...sweeter than I was expecting. In the middle of the taste it gets quite sour, but just for a split second before the sour fades to sweet cherries. It finishes with delightful flavors of vanilla and oak. Mouthfeel is full bodied and VERY creamy. Drinkability is very high, as there is no trace of alcohol flavors. Overall, this beer is very unique and extremely delicious. Now I just need to get my hands on some Black Tuesday and Oude Tart."
"O - One of my top 5 beers. Thank you Bruery!"
"This is an interesting mix of dark chocolate, malted grain character, somehow piquant but subdued tartness, and ripe fruitiness. I wasn’t quite to sure what to think of a mix of Imperial Stout and Flander’s type sour and I still don’t; I am enjoying it though, even though the right side of my brain keeps on thinking that these flavors I am getting can’t quite possibly work together, but my left side says that they do. This beer is a fascinating experience; I almost want to describe it as sloppy genius, the individual components certainly don’t work together, but somehow as a whole they do. This could have been a complete train-wreck, but in the end it isn’t remotely."
"O - Definitely a unique beer. Who would've thought blending a Sour and a Stout. I guess thats the direction we are headed in. Definitely a good brew that has some intense and interesting flavor combos."
"if you like these 2 beers definitely seek this one out."
"Overall interesting, lots of great malt flavors blended fairly well, lots of dark malts roast and chocolate with a little sour tart fruit mixed in there."
"Bruery mélange 1 – last pour of the bottle and holding up next to the first pour of the bottle is night and day, totally different colors. Mine is yeasty and thick looking, whereas the first pour is dark and gorgeous. so thick, you can see the sediment floating around. Smell is really nice sweet tart smell, smells really good. Sweet tarts but balanced so that your mouth waters for a taste. Taste is to die for. simple…very solid sour. Been drinking a lot of sours today, but this is a nice highlight. Mouth is smooth as day is long. there is no puckering on this sour which is really nice, but there is still a very strong sour flavor solid tasting brew, it is fantastic."
"This is another confused beer. Surprisingly, the Oude Tart flavors almost completely take over the robust Black Tuesday ones. I'm not a huge fan of sour dark beers and this doesn't chance my mind one bit. Too much sour and not enough stout in this one. I'm glad to have had this but not nearly worth the trouble."
"I would drink this again, but no way would I be able to consume a 750mL bottle."
"Overall -- Very strange, tastes a bit like Oude Tart followed by a Black Tuesday chaser. In the end, this doesn't really do either beer much justice. A noble effort, but Melange 1, as a beer, is less than the sum of its respective parts. Still, it's working with some pretty good parts."
"Overall: This is a nice beer, but I prefer both Black Tuesday and Oude Tart to this. It's a very interesting mix, though, but I find that I'm unable to quaff it like I do Black Tuesday."
"the darkest pour with a huge tan head that just drops all over the sides of the glass and leaves an enormous amount of lacing. the first smell is simply stunning as a rich, dark stout comes forward with loads of chocolate, coffee and roasted malts which gets wrapped around raspberries, cherries and tart cherries that are simlply everywhere. what a wonderfull blend of flavor when you get fruits and deep roasted malts together, just stunning! one of the best beers i have had in a while, whay a weekend!"
"Massive thanks to beeruser for sharing this one at one of our weekly tastings! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a massively dark brown with a red hue while being almost black (if that makes any sense) with a two finger light tan head that subsided slowly to one finger. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, tart, and diacetyl. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, tart, cherries, butterscotch, and brown sugar. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a great brew without a doubt. Just imagine you get a Black Tuesday that is infected (in a good way), that is pretty much this beer. The flavors going on here REALLY compliment each other really well and makes this one very easy on the palate and keeps you coming back for me. It also helps that the aroma is quite excellent as well. Get this on your palate!!!"
"o - Overall I liked this one and thought it was a pretty cool beer. I still prefer the normal OT and BT versions to this one, but I think it's a pretty cool idea that worked well overall. Definitely worth checking out as it's very interesting."
"O - Quite good, interesting combination of flavors that give a nice dessert and candy like flavor profile. Seems like this is a vast majority Oude Tart with a splash of Black Tuesday mixed in. Definitely glad I have another bottle of this one left in the cellar to explore at a later time."
"Kudos to Patrick Rue for his impressive ingenuity and creativity. The marriage of these two beers was once incomprehensible to me, and now I find myself longing for more."
"Cheers!"
"Beer is creamy and wonderful. I really enjoyed this beer. The Black Tuesday comes through nicely and the sourness from the Oude tart comes through to. It shouldn't work together but it does. Chocolate, cherry tartness, sweet malt, bourbon. Nice. I'd have it again if only there were possible."
"Funny, I thought Black Tuesday was so awesome (and still do) and yet, every variation of it, I've loved even more. Just keep cranking 'em out Bruery, love 'em."
"Pours a dark brown color with a small creamy tan head and some spotty lacing on the way down. The nose brings forward a bit of chocolate and molasses. Behind that is brown sugar and a good amount of bourbon plus a strong oak and cherry cherry. Mild dark fruits a good dosing of acidity. The flavor carried a strong cherry presence that actually overwhelmed the Black Tuesday portion by just a bit. Nice thick roasty and chocolate stout paired with a cherry sourness. Description is dead on. Perhaps a bit too acidic in the finish, as it didn't quite gel with the full, creamy body. At least, that's where I stand. Glad I have a bottle of this and looking forward to seeing how it ages out."
"O - One of the more bewildering offerings I've encountered as of late."
"D - Nothing really wrong with this beer, but I think that the component parts are more impressive on their own. Doesn't have the refreshing, crisp body and sourness of Oude Tart, nor the decadence of Black Tuesday."
"O - Not a bad beer, but not one I'm a huge fan of, would rather have the base beers than the blend. Maybe some more BT would have made it more interesting."
"I am loving this. A clever blend, going for that chocolate covered cherry thing. Well done, Bruery folks."
"(750ml bottle shared at Dak's Final Four Tasting). Pours a hazy dark caramel with off-white head. Around is sour with cherries and chocolate. Taste follows suit with sweetness from Black Tuesday and sour from Oude Tart. Medium bodied with a slick texture. This is a super beer!"
"11/21/2013 update of 2013 Vintage. One of the best beers I've had regardless of style. (4.5) overall"
"Overall, I was fairly impressed with this beer. I wasn't really sure how this blend was going to work out, but the Bruery pulled it off nicely. I definitely went back for a second glass. Goes down pretty easy and gets better as it warms. It would be nice to see the BT come through just a bit more, but I'm not really complaining. Worth seeking out."
"D= The label on the bottle says that this is best enjoyed with friends. But I say it's great to have friends around. Just keep drinking your M-Ultra and stay away from my $25 kick-ass ""rare"" bottle of beer. I can drink the whole thing myself."
"Full-bodied with slight acidity and medium-low carbonation. A really enjoyable beer, as strange as it is."
"Overall, I like oude tart and I like BT, but I don't like this mix. The proportion was too much in the oude tart favor. I didn't particularly care for it as I would rather have the base beers by themselves."
"Drink- Who would think that the guys at Bruery would think to put this out, They did and its awesome."
"On tap at the Bruery Reserve Initiation party 2011. Pours a tan murky brown with a slight tan head. Being a mix of Black Tuesday and Oude Tart, it pretty much does look like what I imagine it would if you mixed the two together. The smell if actually kind of funky with a very different blend between roasted malt, chocolate, and oak with a fruity sour quality. Interesting to say the least. Medium mouthfeel with good carbonation. The flavor is good given the odd blend of these 2 beers. Starts with some roasted notes with caramel and chocolate that quickly transition to some fruity tartness. Surprisingly balanced in my opinion. Not sure how they make this work, but it works."
"A very interesting and enjoyable beer, I'm looking forward to bottles of this."
"D: I have mixed feelings about this one. I liked it, but it didn't really wow me. Nonetheless, an interesting blend and experiment."
"Mouthfeel is nicely chewy and bubbly."
"Draught at The Bruery's anniversary. Almost black, dark brown color with a small beige head. Sour fruit and mild chocolate aroma. The flavor starts moderately tart, giving way to a malty chocolate finish. Fizzy carbonation and a medium-full body. The flemish sourness starts things off well, but the transition to the sweeter, more malty stout doesn't seem to flow very well. Not bad at all, but not seamlessly put together either."
"Another tasty surprise from Patrick & Co. One can only wish that the insane sours coming out of this place will be bottled someday. Highly recommended!"
"D: I was very surprised by this beer. It was unique, complex and entertaining. It may not be a long session beer but it is one that belongs in the stash for sharing with good friends."
"I talked to Patrick before leaving and he said that this blend consisted of 2/3 of the base blend for his Flemish Red and 1/3 of their Russian Imperial Stout, neither of the beers are ready according to the brewers by themselves, anyways they are cool guys and you should try these beers as soon as possible being that I have not been disappointed by one yet, if this is bottled I will being some and drinking more, recommended if they still have some around"
"Dark body, black. The coffee tan head on top is the highlight of the appearance and sits on top for a long time. The aroma was cheesy at first, but that cleared up to be fresh-picked strawbeeries. The taste is dominant of fruit. Lots of strawberry in here, bits of pinneapple, a dash of coffee bean. The fruitness isn't intense, nothing too tart, and the flavors are in harmony with one another. I could sip on this for a while, and one I would like to drink again."
"D: The Bruery continues to impress. This is a very tasty blend, the flavours work quite well together. Only available at the Bruery right now, good stuff."
