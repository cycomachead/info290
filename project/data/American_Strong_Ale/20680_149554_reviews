"O- Outstanding beer that displays completely different profiles on the smell versus the taste. Intense in two different ways. Definitely recommend."

"Amazing! All beer should model itself after this beauty!"
""

"O â€“ Not what I had expected, this was almost artificially sweet, with very limited ""spice"" notes, big brown sugar and toasted coconut and chocolate notes here."

"A little heavy on cinnamon. Smells really nice but too earthy on the taste."

"Absolutely delicious. Drinks very easy for such a hefty brew. Excellent dessert beverage."

"This beer was just overly astringent for any of the adjuncts to come through in a flavorful way. Pretty disappointed. Was looking forward to this big time."

"they could've tricked me and said this was a stout. regardless, this was a crazy good beer. a stand out at aardwolf's early bird special bottle release. glad i brought this and shared it with friends!"

"Verdict: A really spectacular beer from Fremont, so explosive and flavorful. The cinnamon really does the trick here, but the coffee isn't to be forgotten, it might not be as prolific on the tongue, but it helps to bind the beer together really well. This was truly a masterful beer one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying, cheers Fremont."
"Overall - This is good, but I'm not buying the hype.  The cinnamon masks a lot of the qualities of the base beer."

"Really loved this beer, super impressive, but then i am a huge sucker for cinnamon/ coffee stouts. Perfect amount of sweetness in this beer, no booze at all, and the cinnamon doesn't overwhelm the rest of the Awesome malt flavors going on. Super impressive beer."

"Opaque black pour from a bomber into a snifter finishes with a small khaki head.  Smells of heavy cinnamon and touch of coffee, notes of brown sugar and oak as it warms.  Taste was quite complex with a burst of cinnamon followed by molasses, vanilla, raisins, chocolate covered cherries, and hint of roast coffee.  Good weight in the mouth, really coating the tongue.   I really enjoyed this beer.  The cinnamon starts off overpowering, but fades and integrates better as it warms.  I think this is an outstanding beer, but I enjoyed the standard B-Bomb a bit more."

"this is one of the best, and most interesting stouts i have ever had. so much bourbon in this, but its different, not the least bit sweet, mature and highly refined. in the glass it looks incredible. big milkshake head on it, dark dark brown color, tons of viscosity, intimidating and luxurious. the nose is awesome too, i get the coffee and the cinnamon both in equal parts right away. not spicy on the cinnamon, more mellow, very appropriately dosed it seems. there is a nice rich roast to the malt, clearly a combination of roasted barley, chocolate malt, and something in the mid crystal range. the flavor is every bit as good as the nose. cinnamon right up front, but again, not hot, and unlike all the beers that add ancho chili or something like that to these, this one doesnt need it, doesnt miss it, and is better off without it. there is a dark chocolate layer to segue into the coffee side of things. the coffee is great, not bitter at all, and really earthy, bringing the sweetness of the bourbon way way down. there is a brown sugar note in there too, and the wood, which is rustic and intense, so different than any other barrel aged stout ive come across, maybe better than all of them. the cinnamon has a little texture to it, helps it stay dry too, very cool. the finish is a combination of all the flavors, the bourbon and vanilla, the cinnamon, the base beer (which owns by the way) and the coffee, which i think lingers the longest. rich and lathery on the feel, smooth as velvet, and palate coating in an amazing way thats not sweet at all. just so incredible, fremont has me hooked with this one, really one of the best beers i have ever consumed."
"Should be ranked much higher, one of the best beers I've ever tasted!"

"The cinnamon is slightly intense, but the base beer does not fail."

"Overall just really a great beer in every way. One of my favorite Fremont beers ever, and perhaps also one of the best beers I've ever had."

"Chocolate, coffee and some sort of nut in the smell. Lots of cinnamon upfront in the taste. Not getting much of the barrel flavor. I prefer the regular B-Bomb but this is still worthy offering."
""

"Bottom line: This is a fantastic beer. One I'm proud to know comes from my city. I haven't had the base B-Bomb in a hot minute, so I can't really offer meaningful insights to compare and contrast it to the cinnamon/coffee variation (no, I'm not cracking into the bottles I've got stored away for a beautiful rainy day some years from now just for comparisons sake. At least not today!). If you've ever got the opportunity to drink this (or any of the variants, or the base bomb, or even the base Abominable, really for that matter) do it. Do not think twice. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200 (wait, no, if you have the opportunity to snag a couple hundo on the way to drinking this, definitely do that. And then use it to buy more of this!)."

"Overall, this is a couple of steps above the original version.  I really enjoy the unique cinnamon flavor.  This is highly recommended."
"Pours a very opaque dark brown. Nearly black. Half a finger of light brown head. Sticks to the glass some. Smell initially was straight used coffee grounds. That subsided to make room for some roasted malt, faint cinnamon/nutmeg, a touch of alcohol. Mild oak tannins and some baker's chocolate, too. Flavor is sweet chocolate, some mild roast/coffee, hint of some sweet fruit (cherry?), and a tinge of alcohol. Really nice beer. Mouthfeel is a nice medium mouthfeel with low carbonation. One of the better ""winter"" beers out there."

"Served alongside Bourbon Abominable. Dark brown body with a small beige cap. Grandiose cinnamon aroma followed by bourbon and vanilla. Spice and booze. Brown sugar and bourbon. Hard to compare this to its counterpart, as they are vastly different. Coffee character is overshadowed. This is a showcase for cinnamon, and while the flavor is tasty, this is definitely best split a few ways. Yum."
""
"Aged beer. The coffee and cinnamon are gentle enough to add flavor but does not take away from the barrel and the base stout which are both delicious. A little boozy, but this is the newest batch. Wow this is delicious, trade for this."

"Overall. Very good, a nice twist on b-bomb. I would probably take this over regular b-bomb but it's only because I'm so hip with the trends."

"This is like BCBCS with less heat, less viscosity and cinnamon added. Fantastic stuff that should be sought out"

"Edit from 12/28/14.  Had this beer on tap at the Red Hot, and immediately realized I need to increase my original score.  On tap at the RH, and with some time to sit and contemplate this great beer, it was apparent just what a great beer this is.  The coffee and cinnamon seemed to blend in seamlessly with the base beer and the bourbon, giving the beer a wonderful coffee caramel, toffee nougat and milk dud flavor profile.  To no great surprise, this beer was incredibly popular at the Red Hot.  Even at $10 for an 11.5 ounce pour, they blew through their keg in less than a day.  This is just delicious stuff."
"Much more balanced coffee and cinnamon out of the bottle (vs. Draft).  Deliciously creamy and lush on the tongue.  One of the smoothest BA coffee beers I have experienced."

"Very tasty, strong cinnamon but well balanced flavors, good barrel influences"
