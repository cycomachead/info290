"Super smooth beer considering alcohol%. Nice sweetness to this. Didn't taste barrel aging , but it didn't matter. Very good."

"2012 bottle on 3/27/15...unbelievably tasty beer"
""
""
"Introduced to to some new craft beer guys. Lots of booze smell but super balanced flavor. Mostly caramel flavor, some chocolate and Boise but so balanced. Great beer."

"They performed well this blend. It is a concentrate of roasted and bourbon flavors. It is sure sweet, which is a characteristic of their brand, but it is one of the few exceptions I applause."
""
"On tap at The Bruery, poured into mini-snifter (which would prove to be plenty). Appearance is dark reddish-brown with a tan head, streaks, and minimal lacing, which is not unexpected for such a high abv beer. Aroma is powerful butterscotch, vanilla, toffee, cocoa, bourbon heat, roasted malt, dark fruit, brown sugar, and oak. Taste is very sweet with toffee, vanilla, and fig up front. Some oaky bitterness, but not balanced whatsoever. And heat, but less than the 15% on the bottle prepared me for. A sipper, certainly, due to both booze and sweetness. Full bodied, thick, slightly oily texture, low carbonation, sweet, warming finish."
""
"Mild bourbon, nice vanilla, some dark fruits.  Little bit of chocolate."
""
""
""
"2011 bottle, definitely showing it's age but still very tasty.  Milkshake brown color, toffee, cinnamon, boozy flavor/aroma.  Tiny amount of vinegar comes through, but it sort of adds to the overall experience."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad but still too much for me. All of the bruery stouts are a bit crazy."

"Just don't expect big notes of Black Tuesday. Of the three base beers, the anniversary ale is the dominant. Drinks closer to Sucre than anything else."
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Really, really good.  Lots of complexity and intensity.  It's a huge beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Brown sugar, caramel, cinnamon, vanilla, boozy sweetness. Almost a jammy quality. People say this is too sweet, but I think the alcohol cuts through and balances it, then again, I don't mind sweetness. For such a big beer it doesn't feel sticky. No alcohol burn. think I preferred Fruet to this, but barely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent small head with a dark leather brown body, aroma is of sweet bourbon. Taste is deep; brown sugar, caramel, strong maple tones. Almost no carbonation which kills the mood a bit but overall very enjoyable nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
"O- Amazingly complex beer! A bit on the boozier side but still a nice sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Pours a transparent rust color and aroma suggests a BA barleywine. The booze is strong, definitely a sipping beer to share with friends. Lots of wine barrel flavors with the sweet bourbon profile is nice but not what I expected. I get a lot of pine/earthy flavors deeper into the pour but the sweetness is intense, almost too intense. Still a beer to be appreciated and shared."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall-  Very good to great beer but I think the booze knocks it down a notch.  Definitely worth a try if you don't mind the hit to the wallet.  But I could see how some one could pass on this deliciousness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A bit sweet. Some bourbon comes through but it's tough to overcome the creamy sweetness here."
"O- Just a huge beer that has a lot of complex flavors. I thought it would be slightly darker and more roasty, but it really does not disappoint."

"Overall, this is a wonderful beer. I know every non-sour barrel-aged beer from The Bruery seems to be a crapshoot these days, and I must admit to some reservations knowing that Melange No. 3 included a portion of White Oak ""sap", but I'm extremely happy that I took the time to procure this beer. It's easily one of the best blended ales I've had the opportunity to sample, and I only wish I had tried to grab another bottle of it."

"Pours a dark beer. A few bubbles form at the top. Smells like fortified old wine. Tastes like wine too, but bitter. It is an ale and it has a lot of strength. A bit heady, sure to knock you out. Mouth feel is a bit syrupy and thick."

"Pours very dark brown, thin, small bubbly head that goes away quickly. Smell is strong. Caramel, dark fruits, bourbon, booze. Booze hits right up front with a strong alcohol burn. Tastes like Licorice, toffee, vanilla, caramel, oak, bourbon, cola. Just so many flavors. Much like the other big bruery beers I've had the mouthfeel is thinner than I expected, but it's good for this being an almost 17 perfect beer. Makes it easyish to drink. Some nice carbonation. The aftertaste lingers for a while, booze and a nice combo of the all the flavors. Very impressive beer."

"O - 4.25 - Not as good as I'd expect with a 98 rating. I'm going to save 2/3's of this bottle and blend it with a nice robust imperial stout. I think that'll give me more of the flavor I'd want in a big beer like this, especially one that leads you on to think it's going to have flavors from the Black Tuesday in there (which it doesn't)."

"The appearance was very dark muddy brown with a centimeter of head. It smells fruity and nutty with the addition of booze on the nose. It tasted great, fig, plum, and a nicely balance hops and booze. Very earthy. Overall, great with bbq as I had it... Ready to have another bottle."

"Picked this up from a great trade with Mike! Dark mahogany pour with a two finger beige head that faded quickly with minimal lacing. Huge oak and dark fruit notes in the nose along with hints of vanilla, toffee, leather, tobacco, and molasses. The taste is really complex and mirrors the nose with tons of wood and dark fruit along with hints of vanilla, maple, coconut, bourbon, tobacco, prunes, figs, raisins, caramel, molasses, and toffee. The mouthfeel is rich and smooth with almost no alcohol burn, which is crazy for a 15% ABV beer. The carbonation was on the low side, but it really suited this beer. Overall, this was a huge, flavorful, and extremely drinkable beer. It leans to the sweet side, but it's far from cloying. This drinks and tastes more like a Barley Wine for me. However you classify it, it's an incredible beer that I'm glad I was able to taste!"

"O - This is one opulent SOB. I've never had Black Tuesday, but this is definitely my favorite of the Bruery beers, a perfect night ender. Reminds me of an old-world barleywine, but the flavor wallop and many different notes make it hard to classify. What it is is frigging delectable."

"In many ways, this beer seemed far ""smaller"" than its 15% ABV would indicate, but its intense and complex flavor profile was outstanding. The blending of three different beers in this ""black & tan"" seemed to lend a number of interesting characteristics to this brew. The folks at The Bruery really do know how to make consistently excellent high ABV beers better than anyone else."

"Ruby-brown pour into a snifter, a half-finger of dense tan head sank to a ringlet, leaving some spots on the glass. A lot of sweetness in the nose, fruit and sugars, notes of burnt caramel, black cherry, with a decent vanilla component, woody, though not overly boozy. Taste of dark sugars--brown sugar, caramel--sweet and artificially fruity, cherry cough syrup, rum raisin, notes of vanilla, slight coconut, pretty thick with booze. Kind of messy, and though while there was some heat, it didn't nearly feel like a 15% beer. Body was medium, mouthfeel was slick. A decent offering."

"pretty wild beer here, their version of a black and tan, what a gas! the color is red and caramel mixed together, very thick like sludge, dense, minimal but lasting light brown head. I smell everything, no joke. rich malts, darker grains than the color shows, aggressive sugars, whiskey barrel, vanilla, clove, rye malt, booze, and molasses. what I don't smell or taste in this, is yeast. it is mysteriously absent from the flavor profile, not that this beer is hurting for complexity, this is a hell of a blend. dried fruit and sugar, as well as the best richest elements of black Tuesday are what I taste here. its oaky and rich, almost too much really, but the booze is not that obvious for something so high. this goes way beyond beer to something else entirely, more of a barleywine than anything, just so much happening, and such a heavy buzz from even small quantities of this. good carbonation for the size, and about all the body you can pack in. this is not my favorite beer from the bruery, but it is yet another example of their expertise in all aspects of beer making. a blend like no other, worth trying for lovers of huge brews and the bruery more generally."

"This is definitely a HOT beer, at this alcohol level that is not unexpected, but I can’t say that I necessarily appreciate that either. The sweetness is also a bit too simplistic in this beer; I would have been more appreciative if the malt character was less simple sugar focused and had more of a dense, almost savory, concentrated malt character. Interestingly enough, given how hot this beer is, I don’t get as much Bourbon character as I was expecting; more of the vanillin, spicy oak, and toasted oak come out individually rather than reminiscent of actual Bourbon. Not a bad beer if you are only having a couple ounces as a nightcap, but anything more for me is just a bit underwhelming (not complex enough in flavor) and overwhelming (in the hot alcohol and sugary sweetness) at the same time. I must say that I really like the oxidized malt character / sherry notes that are on display here (is this the anniversary old ale contribution), it really adds an extra dimension that keeps me much more interested than I otherwise would be. Drinkable and even enjoyable in small amounts if I am not critically evaluating the beer. Before cracking this beer, I had not reallized how strong it was going to be, I wish I had, as I would have planned to use the rest of the beer for cooking of some sort; I could imagine this being used quite well in a “rum” cake recipe, or even a dense fruit cake would likely be a perfect use (just make sure to reduce the level of sugar called out for in the recipe to account). I am planning on this already with the bottle of Black Tuesday that I am opening; in fact I am almost more excited about the Imperial chocolate stout cake that I am going to make than actually drinking the beer :-)."

"750mL maroon wax. Low carbonation, deep red to near ink with no head really. Richer bourbon, sweeter maple nose, flashes of white alcohol, hints of vegetal green coffee. Taste is sticky, hot/boozy, thick licorice, milk chocolate drizzle. Palate is a bit lighter than expected given all the alcohol in lieu of sugar. Not my thing."
""
""
""
""
"T: Again, really, really freaking good. Opens with a lot of molasses, milk chocolate covered raisin, and burnt caramel. Dark fruit, especially black cherry is in there as well. Middle features some chocolate and bourbon before a finish of toasted oak and brown sugar. A hint of warmness on the finish, but otherwise the alcohol proves pretty elusive. Mouthfeel is near perfect. Rich and slick without becoming too syrupy. Get it."
"O: A very complex beer. As it was warming up in my glass, different flavors were presenting themselves. Definitely a beer worth tracking down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, quite good, but too extreme. I am sure this beer would have been more enjoyable at a comparatively moderate 12% or so. Very nice but hard going."

""
""
"This brew is amazing. I have been sitting on it for a long time because I wanted to wait until I tried all the components (Black Tuesday, Anniversary and White Oak sap). Its not as boozey as you’d think and its definitely pretty easy drinking (from an alcohol heat perspective) the flavor is very strong and full and that makes it a sipper. All I can say is I need as many of these as I can get my hands on."
""
"This beer is an absolute treat. Would definitely recommend sharing one bottle with friends, preferably friends you like! Very interesting, complex and big beer. Typical of the Bruery's best offerings."

"Quite simply, this is a stunning beer, and an absolute treat for anyone who can find it. The smell and flavor are a wonderful orchestra of different notes, perfectly complex and works on an amazing level. Oak, vanilla, cherry, some mild citrus all wrapped up in some bourbon. The taste has amazing brown sugar sweetness, bourbon, white oak, cherries, fig, plum, melons. The most amazing thing is there is not a trace of booze anywhere in this beer which is simply stunning considering the staggering 15.5% ABV. It'll feel like hot water in your stomach, but there is not booze to be found. One of the best beers I've ever had."

"this one lives up to the hype and I'm just stoked I got to try it, lots going on and although I might regret it tomorrow I had no problems taking this monster down solo. I'd love to have another bottle to lay down for a decade but I feel lucky because I got to try this bad boy"
""
""
""
"This is clearly one of the best beers I’ve ever had. Up there with the huge amazing bourbon barrel aged stouts. I love this beer."
""
"The beer pours quite still with limited carbonation as you would expect. The color is deep and dark, basically just this side of black. The smell changes with each nose as you get some bourbon, some roast, and some fruit. This beer is basically somewhere in the old ale/barleywine spectrum with hints of the RIS. It would pair incredibly with a cigar and blow right through the smoke. So much flavor. Different with every sip from roast to fruit to toffee all with full richness and dense mouthfeel. A pleasure to drink and worth the price tag for a special occasion."

"O: This is one serious beer. Reminds me a lot of regular black tuesday but with less roasted malt. Huge sweet notes from the bourbon and from the heavy malts of all the blends. One of the biggest, nastiest black and tans I've ever laid eyes on. Given the blend, more like a black and ...dark brown. And dark brown. This one is a sipper, given the sweetness, the heaviness and the ABV. Packaging this in a 750ml seems ludicrous to me, but I will do my best to soldier through it."

"Bottle: Poured a dark cloudy brown color ale with a relatively large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of roasted malt with sweet notes, some bourbon and some vinous notes makes for a unique mix. Taste is a mix between bourbon and vanilla notes with some oak, dark fruit and some vinous notes which feels more or less balanced with the rest of the mix. Body is full with limited filtration and light warming alcohol. I didn’t really dig the mix between rich stout/old ale sweet notes and the dark fruit and also vinous feels of the beer."

"O - I'm glad I've already ordered up four of these bottles through RS; this is a really good and complex blend of what I anticipate to be three amazing Bruery beers...I've only had the White Oak. I'm sitting on a BT and Papier can't be too bad; that said, I wish the sweetness in Melange 3 shone through like it did with Fruet...hopefully that one is blended in to another Melange offering. Great sipping beer with numerous flavors present and a great balance of beer infusions."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an insanely tasty blend of beers that surpasses the individual components. This is incredibly easy to drink for the ABV and really tasty to boot. I would definitely classify this as a hugely sweet, barrel aged strong ale. This was a huge want of mine for a while and it completely surpassed my expectations. I will be seeking this out again in the future."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep burnished brown with faint ruby at the edges and a smallish tightly bubbled khaki head that slowly dissipates to a ring on top. The smell of bourbon and oak hit my nostrils as soon as I pop the cap off the top. Upon closer inspection I am greeted with light and brown sugars with a fair amount of dark pitted fruit and a hint of ethanol. the flavor is sweet up front with brown and syrupy sugar. Dark and light fruit come next along with a bit of vanilla and wood. The alcohol and bourbon come in next with a ferocity that won't quit. Long lingering tannic wood and alcohol burn long after the sweet liquid settles to the bottom floor. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet harsh alcoholic mouthfeel. Nice sipper, but there is no denying the alcohol content of this one. This is tasty but it needs some time to settle down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium to fuller bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. A very nice brew that is so easy drinking I could probably tank a whole bottle myself. Only after the fact did I realize that Fruet is (I believe) a part of this blend and it makes sense as that brew is really felt in this and helps temper some of the more raw booze from black tuesday."
""
""
""
"O: Very good, very heavy. This is a once in a while beer."
""
"What a beer, so thick, sweet, and full of flavor. The bourbon mingles with the sweetness of the beer so nicely, very rounded flavors. A top notch beer."
""
""
"Overall: As I suspected, the sweetness became a little much as I approached the end of the bottle. That said, Melange #3 is still a fantastic beer and would be perfect split with a friend. I have not had White Oak Sap, however I can’t say that I noted much wheatwine character and I would guess that the Anniversary ale and Black Tuesday make up a much higher proportion of this beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: The complexity and flavor here is insane. So much going on. While one should never expect a 15% plus beer to be ""drinkable"" this one is somewhat less drinkable than some other beers I have had in this ABV range (e.g., Bourbon County Variants, BB4D, BB Monster 29, even Black Tuesday). A really nice beer to enjoy over the course of a few hours. Extremely glad to have the opportunity to enjoy this. Would be interested in getting another to lay down for multiple years."

"O: Pretty darn sweet and boozy to the nose, while the palate actually yields a unified flavor profile. Not 3 beers I would pick to blend (and the tangy wheat IS a bit odd) but overall a masterfully crafted beer, though the sweetness really got to me. Nightcap beer for sure."

"This beer is so crazy that it warrants an overused reference to a movie that came out almost 5 years ago. Burnt, roasty, and woody with a stupid amount of bourbon, caramel, and sugar. So much sugar. Why.jpg"
"Take Black Tuesday, add sugar, drop some of the bourbon and stout characteristics, and you get this. So much sugar sweetness and alcohol. So sweet it's distracting and detrimental."

"O- One of the best beers I have ever had. I like big, sweet beers, and this hit the spot. While it is sweet, the barrel character helps balance it out. A true piece of blended beer art."

"Very good. Was surprised at how much I enjoyed this. Not sure if it is greater than the sum of it's parts, but it's pretty close."

"O: Great beer! It's heavy and really sweet, so I'd definitely recommended it as a beer to share with several people."
"M: Full bodied and sweet as hell."
"The beer pours a medium to dark brown color with some red highlights and a tan head. The aroma is extremely sweet. I get a ton of brown sugar and molasses notes, as well as some wood, maple and vanilla. Unfortunately the flavor is just as sweet as the aroma. I get a lot of dark fruit and oak, as well as some brown sugar. I get some maple notes as well. I know Black Tuesday is a part of the blend but I get no roasted malt or chocolate notes. Very boozy. Thick, syrupy mouthfeel and low carbonation. I am very glad I got to try this one, but it was way too sweet and messy for my liking. Still, definitely a unique brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is very good. I'm not quite sure if the blend was too successful in making the beer unique, though - it tastes like a slightly darker, less fruity version of the anniversary beers. I'm still very pleased with how it tastes, more so than with some of the anniversary beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Edit: I can't believe I drank that whole thing myself. Yikes. I'll be enlising some help the next time I crack something like this..."
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is mahogany with just some light lacing to it. This strong ale has a nose of licorice, bourbon, vanilla and roasted malts. A serious beer, which I sip slowly and taste dark fruit, toffee, more bourbon and some coffee. Mouthfeel is kind of heavy, with a good amount of alcohol presence, but a nice amount of carbonation to. This beer drinks nicely, but is certainly meant for smaller portions consumed over time."
""
"Simply fantastic. A unique, style-bending blend."
"O - A huge beer of massive complexity. I've only had Cuir on its own and I do detect a lot of those flavors. I was hoping for some more action from the Back Tuesday or the White Oak Sap. Its still an amazing beer and accomplishment though. The Bruery can work wonders with insanely high gravity thick brews. It lived up to my expectations for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very delicious blend. I'd put this on par with Black Tuesday."
""
"Overall: This one was pretty decent, but it did not blow my mind. A good American strong ale for sure, but one try was good enough for me. The barrel and bourbon is just too big right now. I would sit on this bottle for 2 or 3 years if I had a bottle."
"A masterpiece of a beer."
"This was a fantastic, highly complex beer. I recommend sharing a bottle because the sweetness and high abv would make it hard to finish more than 12oz alone."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I enjoyed the small quantity of his beer that I sampled (around 6 oz) and frankly that is all you need. It is really really sweet and would be a task to consume in large doses. I wish there was more of a Black Tuesday and or White Oak presence to balance the super sweet Papier. It's just really not that complex for the rarity/cost it takes to acquire."
""
"A delicious beer. The combination of caramel and fruit just works. Lots of barrel and spiritous goodness. Nice."
"Tasty but not amazing, and I can't drink more than a couple ounces of this. Still enjoyable!"
"This is easily a top-shelf beer & possibly one of my favorites of all time. Just beautiful. I could drink this every night."
""
""
""
"Overall this is another big and tasty beer from the Bruery, and I enjoy the idea of blending, but it isn't better than the stand-alone components."
""
""
""
""
"O- A damn delicious beer, has a lot of the best aspects of the Bruery's big, rich beers. This stuff is a real treat and is an awesome, complex sipping beer."
""
"O: solid beer, but too sweet. I shared the bottle with one other, but half of that is way too much. Should have shared with 4 people. Still an excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow,!i loved this one. Reminded me a lot of BA Naked Evil only because of the Belgian aspect and the high ABV. Seek out! Thanks egrace84!!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O : I like this, more than I thought I would as I am not the biggest Black Tuesday fan (non-09 anyway!), oak was a bit more forward than I prefer and once it warmed became a touch cloying. Glad I have more, looking forward to it already."
""
""
"O - Overall this was phenominal. I cant believe a blending of beers can come out tasting like this. Wish this delightful beer was readily available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Doesn't live up to two years' worth of hype. I like some of what's here, but unfortunately it's just not that great of a blend. There's way too much White Oak element in here, so I'll blame that because I found that base beer quite loathsome to begin with."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being too way overdone. Overall, it was a decent beer but I didn't think it was better than any of the beers that went into it. The sweetness, alcohol heat and high carbonation were just overdone for me, even for the style."
""
""
""
"O: A much better effort then I was expecting. After the liquid shitshow that is White Oak, I really wasn't expecting much from this one. Yet this is a solid effort, if not a bit unbalanced. In the future, I'd like to see the Bruery do like Firestone-Walker: bring in a winemaker and allow them to help in the blending process. It'd be a shame for all this potential to go to waste."
"O-Simply Brilliant! With age this one will be a straight 5/5! I am truly loving this one. Thanks to darkmoon6, I was able to drink and share this beer with a fellow enthusiast... CHEERS!"

"Huge thanks to jedwards for sharing. This beer has been a long-time want (and thanks to Callmecoon for sending a long a bottle in the Movie Night Part II BIF - definitely plan on cellaring this). Pours a brownish-amber with no head and no residual foam. Nose expresses cocoa, molasses and a suggestion of booze. Taste reveals toffee and cocoa notes - I'm definitely getting the wheat wine and stout characteristics here; however, the old ale qualities aren't really popping. That said, the sugary sweetness of this beer practically makes my teeth hurt. Mouthfeel is medium in body with just a kiss of carbonation. Overall, this beer is fantastically complex and decadent. A small pour definitely goes a long way."
"Drinkability:  The above represent a somewhat jumbled set of notes - I was playing Settlers of Catan while reviewing this one. That being said, this is an intriguing beer, a hot beer, and a testatment to the magic of blending. Who would have thought that a wheatwine, a barrel aged imperial stout, and an old ale could combine to give you this array of flavors? That being said, it's a sipper, and a slow one, lest you inadvertently build yourself in to a corner while playing Catan without realizing it, but, that's neither here nor there."
""
"o - overall, not sad that i took this on by myself at all. loving every sip. in fact, my wife took a sip and really dug it and she grabbed a glass, so not such a solo effort. gotta give the bruery credit...created a huge beer that both my wife and i can dig. my wife normally runs from barrel aged. kudos on a job well done and psyched to have a few more of these."
""
""
"This was certainly a nice treat to open but it was very big, rich and sweet. A little too much in that aspect for me but a good beer as a whole."
""
"O: really nice blend..."
"DOA"
""
""
"Big thanks to hannydawg for sharing this with me. Pours a thick viscous reddish color with nice clarity. There is a small amount of head which dissipates quickly and no lacing. The aroma is intensly sweet with layers of complex flavors. Deep notes of chocolate and vanilla are present first, followed by maple and molasses. The taste features and onslaught of malts up front with an expected sweet presence. A little bit of chocolate and vanilla come through along with molasses and mellow oak. The body is substantial and slightly sticky. Overall, this is incredibly intense and best enjoyed in small servings."
"O: Super beer with an extremely delicious sweet aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
"4.0 D: An intense beer. I got through the whole bottle and it wasn't so bad. Yes, the sweetness is trying, but the flavor profile is pretty good."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle to oversized snifter (thanks for the trade, Bob). Looks solid; deep and complex. Smells tasty too; bourbony and heavy. Tastes great; this beer is probably better than its average review suggests. Mouthfeel is good too. Overall, a damn good beer!"
"O - I have always enjoyed this one. It has all the flavors I enjoy and the blend works very well. This one is still a little too boozy, can't wait to drink the others in the future."
"Overall Impression- Now just to enjoy all three of these individually... Very wild combination and not sure how they were able to hide the huge ABV but made the experience even better. Enjoy if given the opportunity!"
"Melange #3 pours black, but not quite as deep as, say, an imperial stou. About two fingers of light tan foam come together to form the head. Retention is just average, and lacing is basically nonexistent. The nose is heavy on caramel and bourbon, with some nice, subtle vanilla and oak undertones. The taste really steps things up and has more layers of complexity. The bourbon takes a little bit more of a backseat here, as vanilla, caramel, and milk chocolate form the centerpiece of the flavor profile. Bourbon and wood come in and lend supporting roles. The touch that really adds the final touch is the hint of figs and cherries that creep in during the finish. The body is full and creamy, though not nearly as syrupy as I might have anticipated a 15% beer being. The carbonation is barely there, just enough to make itself known. Melange #3 is a delicious beer from The Bruery, and one that shows the possibilities of artfully blending beer."
"Melange is not black, rather deep, deep brown, with dark red auburn highlights. A decent off tan/light tan head sits atop the ale, it actually never fades completely from sight. Smells strongly of alcohol, hot alcohol, but barrel too, caramel, toffee, lots of vanilla and chocolate. Coconut too! Really fine smelling beer as I love bourbon bombs. The taste too is great, toasted marshmellow, caramalized brown sugar, vanilla, chocolate, yes bourbon too. You do get a touch of alcohol in the flavor. Thick and heavy mouthfeel, almost oily and slightly cloying....though what would you expect? Super tasty ale here."
""
""
"O - Not as good as the '11 at this point. Hotter, not quite as smooth. Still a very nice beer."
""
"O: Delicious, complex, and dangerously drinkable. The fruit and complexity moderate the sweetness, but like Black Tuesday the sweetness is a limiting factor."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very hard to come by in my neck of the woods and I was very grateful to be able to obtain a bottle. This beer is wonderful and if it were readily available I'm sure I'd have a few in the cellar...but unfortunately it is not. For my money I'm not sure it's worth the price you pay. For the cost of a couple bottles I could grab a case of Rochefort 10. Don't get me wrong...it's very good but just not on the same level as some of the Firestone Walker blends I've had. I would definitely drink this brew anytime it was put in front of me and I am very glad I had the opportunity to try it. Just wish it wasn't so damn expensive. These guys do a great job no matter what the cost and I'm looking forward to more Bruery offerings in the future..."
""
"O: This beer could have been amazing, if it had only been a tad bit more dry. The flavors are there, the mouthfeel blows."
""
""
""
"D - Nasty ABV but doesn't tire easily!"
""
""
"MF/D: Extremely smooth with relatively little carbonation, but couldn't believe the ABV. Certainly tasted strong, but not 15+%..."
""
"Overall: This beer is fantastic, a blend of 3 great beers that is better together than as parts. Really great...could drink nightly"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Just delicous and I see it being cellar worthy for sure"
""
""
"O: Another beautiful beer from The Bruery. The blend really gets all the best aromas and flavors from the base beers. Mouthfeel suffers a bit but that's a small complaint."
"The beer pours a deep dark brown. Little lacing and no head. Very mild nose, figs, tobacco, raisin and intense sweetness. The taste matches with incrediblly ripe fruits, but the burp is a hoppy molasses. Strange beer, but almost consistent with an old ale description. The booze are consistently hidden, but catch up to you. I honestly don't know how they hid >15% in this beer. Definitely a tasty beer, but I wouldn't charge more than $20 by any means."
"A stunning desert drink, and a little goes a long way. A shame about the sweetness...I feel like the blend could be tweaked just a bit to achieve a more perfect balance."
"Beer is heavy in my hand, I can feel the density and the gravity as I raise my glass to my mouth, although the beer finishes a little thin and dry the forward flavors are sweet bourbon, mild spiciness on the late palate, sweet, dry finish, lingering sense of almost corriander and citrus. Heavy throughout, nice nutty oakiness on the backend as well. About as complex as a beer can get. I love it. And I should know, I'm a certified beer server."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is an unbelievable beer by The Bruery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The Bruery kills it with beers like this. Wish I'd insisted that my friend pick up another. Excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Love triangles usually end in heartbreak, but Black Tuesday, White Oak and Cuir are making it work. The balance is perfect, the flavors enticing, the booze big enough to let your know you’re drinking something big yet not big enough to turn you off. I love it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Shocking. World class. So grateful to try it. My highest recommendation."
"Pours a dark amber with a one finger cocoa head. Great lacing on my snifter. Nose is butterscotch, caramel, toffee, Vanilla, burned toast. Taste is the same profile... Super smooth, with an incredible taste to it. Feel is perfect. Where's the alcohol? Overall, a really amazing brew with a slight alcohol burn. This is a strong beer, and very stealthy alcohol-wise. I literally fell asleep for 30 minutes after enjoying this brew.... Not for the faint of heart. Cheers!"
"Cost: $35 for a 750 ml bottle."
"My bottle shared with Andrew and Nick. Rich and complex. Dark bottled with bubbly head. Above average mouthfeel. The imperial stout, the Black Tuesday is the centerpiece, some chocolate, A sour finish. Somewhat like a good red wine (though with tannins).A sipper and one I would have again."
"This is a blend for the ages. There is nothing about this beer that is overdone. It's a perfect blend. The Bruery just convinced me to buy in to the Reserve Society."
"Worth the money? Close. One of the most well made stouts with this kind of punch I've ever had. Definitely one of the best Bruery standouts."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer, really grateful to try it."
""
""
""
"Unlike Melange 1 which I thought was a disaster, Melange 3 is a beer that seems to be a sum bigger than its parts. The vanilla of White Oak perfectly complements the Black Tuesday and makes it a touch thinner. Good complexity and although its a bit hot, this is a solid beer nonetheless. Worth seeking out."
"A tough one to drink due to its sweetness and alcohol content, this is the beer equivalent of a port wine. Sip and relax and don't make any plans."
"Overall – Honestly the mouthfeel and heat of this beer does it in. The feel is just too heavy and syrup like for this beer to be enjoyable to me. In addition, while this is still a young beer and high ABV, the alcohol het (in both taste and feel) is higher than I remember BT or BA Cuir (or regular Cuir for that matter). Lastly, it is sooo cloyingly sweet. This is a beer I feel has potential to age, however, as of now I find it somewhat of a hot mess. I should not have opened this bottle by myself..."
"O: This is an awesomely complex and tasty adult beverage and I am grateful to have been allowed to try this special beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: This is exceptional, the flavors and aromas are amazingly complex, rich and balanced perfectly. Hats off to Patrick and anyone involved in the mastery of this blend."
""
""
"This beer was delicious, albeit quite warming, and there' no doubt that a little bit goes a long way in this beer."
""
""
"Overall: In my opinion the beer is too young and needs some time to age and come into its own. I found the alcohol to be a bit distracting especially on the nose"
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This is certainly a tasty beer, but the heat is still overwhelming. It took me 5+ hours to work through this bottle. Perhaps some time will mellow out the heat and make this one easier to drink, and if that actually happens, this will become a world class beer. No doubt this one is complex and enjoyable, but the boozy heat does get in the way at times. Definitely worth checking out if you get the chance, but make sure there are at least two other people there to help you out. Thanks again for the trade Pirates. I’ll have to have you here to help me next time I drink one of these."

"Pours a murky dark brown with a 1/2 inch foamy khaki cap that settles to an oily film on the top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly slide back into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of bourbon, wood, malt, brown sugar, toffee, and dark fruits. Taste is of bourbon, wood, malt, brown sugar, toffee, plums, and figs. This beer has a low level of carbonation with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. A definite alcohol warmth in the back of the throat with each sip. Overall, this is a fantastic beer with very complex aromas and flavors. I am really glad I was able to try this one."
""
""
"O: I was disappointed overall on this one with all the great reviews this one got. By no means does it not taste good I guess I just wasn't into the style of this one. For me the oak flavors took center stage and didn't allow any of the other flavors to come through. I didn't feel like I was drinking a beer it was more like a dessert wine in a way. For the price you pay for this one I don't know if I would revisit it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The abv is really high so it may be unavoidable, but even so it was still a bit too sweet for me. I enjoyed sipping on my pour and would probably have it again if I have enough people around to share a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I was a bit skeptical of this beer as I kind off get turned off by overly sweet beers but this was just right. Very sweet but still manageable brew with some awesome Bourbon and butterscotch notes that don't overwhelm but are intense. Awesome brew."
""
""
"O- wow! Amazing beer especially for 15%. Knocked the ratings down for the sweetness and syrupyness, but other than that very good beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hugely complex, huge in general as well, multidimensional, quite a good blend. Really interesting, unique, and tasty."
""
""
""
"Overall: I've been a fan of Melange 3 since I've first had it. BA Cuir and this one make me question if BT is really the Bruery's flagship as most proclaim it to be. The bal-aging is nicely incorporated in Melange 3 and the beers blended all contribute to a fine experience that goes down really easy for the ABV. I'm impressed, very well done Bruery."

"This beer pours a muddied amber in color, thick and syrupy in body with no head or lacing. It smells of sweet and and syrupy malts and has a touch of Black Tuesday. Sugar bomb! It has a lot of sherry and port to it. The flavors are sickly sweet malts with slight vanilla and bourbon. It's too sweet to feature much complexity. It drinks medium in body and is very sticky and leaves a great amount of residual sugar around the glass. Overall its hard to endorse this one. It's too big for its own good, just too much sweet malt. Not worth the money in my opinion."
"Thanks to Chad for sharin this one! Pours a very dark brown color with a small tan head. Scent is very chocolatey. Slightly boozy. Nice raspberry and cherry aromas. Candied sugar and bourbon. Taste is quite boozy throughout the whole experience, yet its flavors remain nicely balanced and smooth. Great cherry and vanilla oak flavors. Lovely chocolate and malt flavors from the Black Tuesday. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and boozy. Drinkability is fairly high for such a huge beer. Overall, a great beer that definitely needs more time to develop in the bottle."
"Overall: The BT is very prevalent, the Papier is easy to taste and I could only detect a hint of the White Oak Sap coming through. Very good beer, but I agree with other BAs that this beer tasted very young and could benefit from some added aging."
"pretty delicious but tasted young, really could use a good few more years to mellow out a bit."
"The body is full and silky with soft carbonation. A little hot but it doesn't bug me too much. Real tasty stuff here, a little sweet but great to share with a few people."
"I like this one as a sipper. I don't think it's anything super special, but I'd gladly drink it again."
"O: Really looks atrocious, Black tuesday is better and less hot, good but strange and too hot, not undelicious but not great."
"Poured dark brown with a moderate frothy brown head that mostly lasted with excellent lacing. Heavy toasted chocolate, wood and coffee malt with a small alcohol aroma. Full body with a creamy texture and flat carbonation. Heavy balanced toasted sweet malt flavor with a heavy bittersweet finish with a warming burn of long duration. This is a standout beer."
"Overall an awesome beer! lots of great flavors, rich and malty, a bit syrupy, chewy, great vanilla, caramel, chocolate, bourbon, etc. And surprsingly drinkable for what it is."
"O: Tastes a lot like a BT with a few thing other nascence’s added in. It’s really complex and amazingly smooth. Thanks again for opening this, Evan."
"The palate opens with not nearly as deft a touch, with a strong, boozy heat immediately noticeable. Immediately after is the remarkable sweetness that this beer has.The Papier/Coton contribution is most noticeable with the big bourbon along with the brown sugar and vanilla making this rather decadent. The BT adds a layer of cocoa and chocolate to the palate. And then, there's the raisin and grape character that lends a definite brandy note to the palate. The toffee character does lend a lightness to the palate, a mild boozy beer. Medium-full in body with soft carbonation, this beer has a boozy finish with a blend of bourbon, brandy and brown sugar. Excellent stuff, though I have to admit that it will take me 3 nights to finish this damn bottle."
"Pours a neutral brown color, some haze but mostly translucent. Whisps of bubbles appear, but this just looks like maple syrup. Smells of caramel and wood, vanilla is present, but just smells sweet. I would put this on my ice cream, but its not something that I enjoy forcing down my gullet. Flavor is very complex, but tastes like someone had a bag of mixed candies, left it in the trunk of their car all summer, and poured it into my glass. Very tough to drink, sickeningly sweet and resinous, It took me 6 hours to drink my half of the bottle."
"4/4/4.5/4.5/4.5"
"Toffee and caramel just all over this one."
"D: All day everyday. Goes with being a a sibling of Black Tuesday. 15% abv is hardly noticed."
"D - If I had a bottle of this I wouldn't open it around any less than three other guys, if not more, much like Adam did. This beer's booze level just begs to cause trouble for those partaking."
"D--One pour into a snifter and I am feeling this sucker after a few ounces, strong as hell, and I am a big beer drinker. I am glad I was able to get a hold of a bottle of this, but would not seek it out again. Guess for the meantime, as close as I will get to the elusive Black Tuesday..."
"(D)- Definitely a strong, sipping beer great on a winters night. The blending definitely made this a bit more complex and possibly smoother."
"D: Just another big boozy beer to check off my list of big boozy beers I never have to drink again."
"The body is medium full and carbonation is high. Overall this is phenomenal, well worth the acclaim."
"Interesting but hard to drink that much of."
"D: Eh... Compared to some of the other -bal aged beers we had that night, this one was lacking. I loved BA Coton straight up as well as Black Tuesday. The blend of those two with White Oak sap just doesn't do it for me though."
"Thanks, ptykozoon, for the opportunity and to sj3324, for the opportunity to revisit"
"Drink- I think at 17% its a bit dangerous in my hands. That whole bottle would stand a chance and I wouldn't be standing anymore."
"On tap at the Bruery Reserve Initiation party 2011. Pours a reddish hued mahagony dark brown murky color with a tan head. Oaky notes in the nose along with some roast, vanilla, with an odd mix of fruit notes. Not sure on the nose or not and if I like it. The taste to me is heavy on the Black Tuesday, either that of those flavors just dominate the whole thing. The blending works though and I am enjoying this. What I would say is that on a day like this, trying so many great beers, this one sort of gets lost in the mix and doesn't stand out for me. I'll have to try it again on its own and re-rate I think. Medium mouthfeel."
"Served from tap into a Bruery sampler imperial pint glass at the Reserve Society Party. Poured a deep dark brown with a minimal tan head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, chocolate, vanilla, and maple syrup. The flavor was of sweet malt, chocolate, vanilla, and cream. It had a heavy feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall impression... Effing wow! This brew was just plain excellent in all aspects. The flavor was more toward the sweet side without being overly sweet. The 17% ABV was NOWHERE to be found... This one is a must try without any doubt and I'm definitely glad I got to try it..."
"D: Idiotic decision to release this in 750mLs. I'm not shy about saying it. That being said, I'd be willing to try finishing a bottle of this on my own."
"D - 17% but I could easily put this down. I really love this beer, its so complex and a perfect cigar beer or a cold day in front of the fireplace type of beer."
"D - Definitely a slow sipper, but this is highly enjoyable. Glad I am sharing the bottle with several BA's. Really enjoying, but too much of this will really hurt in the morning."
"D- Moderately high given the ABV. Once we got to try it solo we started blending it... the consensus was Melange 3 makes everything taste better. Gotta give points for that. I love this beer."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, lightly sticky and heavy with the lightest touch of carbonation, wonderful."
"This is surprisingly drinkable for the ABV. Definitely a sipper, but a quick one. The flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are all great. This is a finely crafted brew and one of the best stong ales I have ever had. A perfect brew to sip on next to the fire on a cold winter's night. I'm really excited to see how the other bottle ages. Nice work Patrick!"
"The mouthfeel on this beer definitely propels it to a word class American Strong Ale; remarkably drinkable given the potent ABV."
"D - exceptionally good for such a huge beer. The clean alcohol and well-balanced flavors make this an easy drinker for being such a big bold beer."
"Drinkability: Not bad considering how massive the flavors and the abv are."
"The bourbon comes through as it warms further. There is a weird sour cherry juice thing. Anyways, it's a pretty good beer, but I'm underwhelmed."
"Most of the scores took a hit as it is really too much booze, a bit too sweet, and a bit too flat. I think it would be better on tap."
"Overall, this is simply an amazing beer. Reminded me of an old ale, but much bigger. Very good and extremely drinkable for being 17%. I was impressed."
"Full body with a smooth mouthfeel. Again, this was very interesting and sounded like a great concept on paper but probably impractical at the same time. BT was great, but this one started to seem like overkill after a while. Again way too sweet. Still, I can't deny how great that aroma was and the first taste was still amazing. I probably killed the experience by drinking too much but that's why I can't call this the most drinkable thing out there."
"D - Drinkability is minimal considering this is 17% but its damn good I mean I would like to drink more I would just get sloppy!"
"The Bruery needs to invest in 25mL bottles for these ridiculous offerings they keep putting out. It's like an overpowering whiskey, it needs to be diluted so you can actually enjoy it. Last night 5 people were at a tasting and there was still 5oz left in the bottle that was poured down the drain. This was a disappointment considering the availability and price. I think I'm done with the ultra huge BA beers."
"D: Only gets better as it warms up. Delicious all around. Great to savor its complexity throughout and keep discovering new flavors."
"Big, huge, disappointment here."
"D - Hard to get down, too sweet, too much alcohol. This is a good, but not great beer. Don't care if I ever have this again."
"A very nice beer overall. Not utterly mind-blowing, but excellent. A sipper for sure."
"D: a very slow sipper that is quite enjoyable but huge. I dont think it would be wise to even have as much as i am enjoying right now but i would love to try this again and think that this would be definitely be better on tap"
"This is a definitely dessert beer, quite a sipper. The massive bourbon presence and sweetness definitely limit the drinkability but it's what I've come to expect with the big Bruery beers."
"Deep, dark reddish brown with a firm cap of khaki head. First whiff is of booze, wow. Right off the bat i was scared and having flashbacks to taking nips of cheap booze straight from the bottle at partys of yore. Lots of carmel, oak and vanilla as my nose adaptas to the scent. With a little push, the first sip is amazingly smooth carmel, raisin, prune, chocolate, roasted grain, nuts, toffee sweetness and backed by the burbon, oak and vanilla. Fuller side of medium bodied with active carbonation. The nose scared me to death and showed the 17%, the taste however was amazingly smooth - very well crafted."
"D: I thoroughly enjoyed this. So much so that I easily put two glasses back in about an hour and a half. I was a big fan of both white oak and black tuesday so I am definitely not surprised to love this offering from Patrick and the gang."
"Slightly chewy medium body that is surprisingly spicy up front followed by sweet alcohol heat and bourbon that lingers throughout into a sweet and very hot finish. This beer becomes more complex as it warms and a ton of complexity begins to show. Lots of sweet caramel and leathery malts along with earhty oak, vanilla, toffee, caramel, hazelnut and slightly tart dark fruit. A very nice balance of spice, sweetness and bourbon/alcohol heat. Hints of tart dark cherry, plum, raisin, fig mixed with silky chocolate malt and caramel. Very well balanced and pretty drinkable considering the ABV. You can taste the heat butni wouldn't have guessed this beer was 17%. I'm actually very surprised that after the initial palate shock is beer is very smooth and flavorful. The bourbon and barrel notes are excellently integrated Making me salivate for another sip. Very well done and actually lives up to the hype. I'm psyched that I got a chance to try this one. Highly recommended!"
"Overall, this drank like an aged 12% beer and went down way too easily. I could put this away many times over. I would expect the heat to calm a little with age and make this beer that much better. Lucky to have tried this."
"Bourbon and caramel hit the tongue first. Chocolate candies, surprisingly a lot of fruitiness too, stonefruit and dates. Molasses-like sweetness, mellow alcohol, a bit of tannic oak. While it tastes quite strong and rich, it's actually very mellow and easy to drink. It finishes semi-sweet with a leathery, bourbon-toffee aftertaste. The sheer viscosity of it is impressive, a few ounces is plenty, but I wouldn't complain if I could drink this regularly. Nice job, Bruery."
"Full body with a splendid mouthfeel... but that 17% destroys any drinkability. Looking forward to the bottle version."
"D - I wish I would have bought the Bruery membership just for this beer, it's that good."
"D: went down to good considering the 15% ABV on this bad boy. Really enjoyed this beer all the way through and hope to get my hands on a bottle."
"Overall an awesome brew. Can't wait to get some bottles"
"A really good beer. Alcohol (I have 15% version) is well hidden."
"D: Way more drinkable than I expected. An amazing beer!"
"D - I enjoyed this beer more then Black Tuesday. It's a sipper, that's for sure. It took me two hours to finish two pours of this. One of the top beers for this style, but Angel's Share Grand Cru is a better beer for me. Recommend!"
"Cheers"
"D- I had 4 glasses at The Bruery for their celebration, just an amazing beer. Not really a session beer but I could sip on a bottle of this for a couple hours and be very content. I will be purchasing 3 bottles once released and cellar them for several years."
"D: This beer is boozy and the flavor keeps you from forgetting it. However, it's still quite easy to drink--dangerously, even. I can't wait for the bottles to come out."
"D: Would be on my short list of beers if I were on death row. This is not just a beer it is a true beer drinking experience, one I wish everyone had the chance to try."
"D - it's delicious. could have kept drinking it all night if they didn't have to close!"
"Highly recommended. Looking forward to this being in bottles next year."
"I was fortunate to be in Irvine visiting the in-laws for Thanksgiving when learning that Melange 3 was on tap yesterday at the Bruery. At $4/5 oz pour, this wasn't cheap. But it's quite good. Pours very dark brown with ample carbonation levels. Smells and tastes extremely sweet - brown sugar, vanilla, bourbon, fruits, and alcohol. As expected, the body is quite thick. There's plenty of carbonation to prevent this from coming off as syrupy. Really good stuff - I had 3 glasses of it - but it was tough to finish that third glass given the high ABV and sugar level. So not the most drinkable of brews in my opinion. But it's really good in small doses."
"I could have drank this all night and not flinched... in fact after my first one disappeared so fast, a fellow BA and i both noticed how remarkable easy this was to drink (a characteristic that i think all of their big beers have). I will admit, I can see where those who are not crazy about big beers or are unwavering hop devouring machines would not get along with melange, but i can assure it did me just right. If its still there tomorrow, I think I'm going back..."
"The mouthfeel is robust, smooth, and sticky. Big bold and boozy. This beer is not for everyone, but it is definitely for me. This is one refreshing craft beverage."
"Overall: An exceptional beer which I can't wait to try again. A must try. Cheers!"
"D-A very interesting mix of brews. Lots of flavour and one of the smoothest packages I have ever had. Really nice....Crazy!"
"Drinkability? Huge alcohol content that is hidden quite well considering, awesome taste and awesome mouthfeel, ths is one of the best malt centric brews that I have ever tasted. In my book, this is World Class! Alan...I can't thank you enough for the opportunity!"
"Overall I can make this real simple. This beer has made me rethink all other big beers I have ever had. The deep and rich flavor of butterscotch and toffee that I so try to find is rediscovered here. This beer is sublime, please, do yourself a favor and go find this."
"Poured into a large tulip. Thanks to my buddy Alex who picked up this 32oz flip top from New Beer for me. Pours black with a gorgeous tan head that sits for awhile until relaxing into a nice caramel lace. Smell is loads of cherries and dark chocolate mixed with some booze. I also pick up a lot caramel and other overly ripe dark fruits. Very interesting. This one is warm going down. Tastes of same smell notes. A little booze sits on the finish. Smooth going down with perfect carbonation on the finish. There is a big sweetness to the taste like fruit compote that you notice right away. Some Graham cracker is mixed in. I do notice a slight bitterness that imperfects the finish. The booziness is getting to me half way through the glass making this tough to polish . The smell on this is intriguing. I'm glad I got to try it, but won't seek this one out again."
"I could not believe that this stuff was 15%, I could drink it all day long."
"Draught at The Bruery's anniversary. Dark brown with a small beige head. Rich wood, bourbony, burnt sugars, creme brulee, caramel, and light alcohol aromas. Flavors of chocolate, molasses, burnt sugar, caramel, light wood, bourbon, smooth alcohol and light berry fruitiness, with a rich boozy and sweet finish. Full bodied and sticky with smooth carbonation. For how big this is, it drinks very smoothly, a trait it shares with most of their big beers. Still a bit too sweet for me to love. While it is intense and complex, it just lacked a certain cohesiveness."
"I wasn't getting a ton of the wheatwine - I suspect pouring some bourbon Papier into a Black Tuesday would come pretty close. Not hating on this beer - it's f*@%ing awesome - but it's a sipper and a night cap."
"What the hell was this made of, and why doesn't the Bruery bottle beers like this?"
"In.Sane."
"D: 15%? Really? The strength rarely pops up, content to hide behind the full profile. A masterfully blended ale, rich and intense. More, please."
"Wow! Just wow! It's been a while since I've awarded three 5's to a beer (only three beers prior to this that I've reviewed) and this one is real close to four for me, with between a 4.5-5 on the mouthfeel as well. This is just a TREMENDOUS blend, one of the best beers that I've ever had, and is hands down my early pick for favorite of 2009. Two weeks later and I can still taste the tang in my mouth. Patrick Rue and this brewery are the real f**king deal folks."
"Notes: Woah. This MAY be the best beer I've ever had. I know it's the highest I've ever ranked a beer. Frankly... I couldn't tell ya if this is the best beer I've ever had.. and that's seriously a tall order to follow... but holy shit if this isn't everything a brew is supposed be."
"One of the best beers I've had for a while. Highly recommended."
"D: Taste is simply amazing and drinkability is equally magnificent. 15% ABV goes down smoother than than many beers with half the ABV, but there is no need to down it quickly with such rich flavors. The worst part about this beer is that it is likely I will never taste this again. The best beer I have tasted yet from The Bruery, and on par with any world class barrel aged blend. Epic."
"Draught, Boulder Strong Ale Festival. This bad boy poured with a brown color that left a thin, creamy light tan foam. Nose of rich caramel-like malt and wood barrel. Flavor is very rich & chewy, with notes of caramel, toffee, apple, vanilla and sweet fruit. Sweet, strong, lots of barrel presence. Keep em' comin'"
"Wow very dark brown with a brown head that fades pretty quickly. So much going on in the smell department, definitely bourbon coming through, but not overpowering, along with almond, vanilla, coco, oak, dried fruit, some alcohol, but not much. (i probably smelt this beer 5 times before even taking a sip). 1st sip, wow so much going on roasted malts, oak and vanilla, dry finish, with a caramel coating. I could definitely feel the alcohol in the 1st sip. After drinking more the alcohol wasn't as strong and you couldn't really tell you were drinking a 15% beer. Really a nice sipping beer, would love to try more from this brewery. Glad i had the chance to try it, SEEK IT OUT"
"Just when you think Pat and the crew can't further diversify their portfolio of beers, they do it again. And once again, quality is not an issue. This might be my new favorite Bruery beer, and instantly one of my all-around favorites. Well, until Melange No. 4 is conceived."
"D: Absolutely impossible to detect 15% abv. Despite the intense flavor I could drink a lot of this. This is my first Bruery offering and I'm very impressed."
"Full body was thick and creamy, light carbonation. Amazingly drinkable for 15+ percent. I had way too much of this at the Boulder Strong Ale Fest, but I am very glad I did."
"Drinkability suffers from the sheer size, but honestly, this is better judged as an after dinner drink than as a beer. Fantastic."
"D: If I thought Partridge in a Pear Tree held its alcohol well this is exceptional. I knew the blend of the beer so I was thinking 10%, but I found out it was 15% and was shocked. Really it drinks like a 5% beer. I hope they have this on cask at a later date, I'd really like to have it again."
"Sampled today at the Bruery on Valentine's Day, reviewed this from notes on my cell phone, this is a blend of three bourbon barrel aged beers: Black Tuesday Imperial Stout, White Oak Wheatwine, and Papier, their 1st anniversary brew, I will start off by saying that this is by far their best beer to date and one of the better ones I have ever had period, color is a very dark brown, not much of a head, maybe a quarter inch and slightly bubbly, went away pretty quickly, this stuff just looked good, do not say that often but it was surely the case, there was a big bourbon nose, lots of roasted almonds and malts, very small amount of booze, oak, vanilla, milk chocolate, molasses, dark fruits, honey, buttered bread, and lots of caramel, flavor is so good, lots of caramel and toffee up front, roasted and bready malts in the middle mixed with vanilla and oak, finish has a nice caramel and bourbon finish, slightly dry in the aftertaste and keeps you wanting more and more, gots sweeter as it warmed after a few minutes and the complexities of the wheat wine component seemed to shine through, cannot barely detect any booze somehow, wow this stuff tastes great, mouthfeel was the only issue with this beer but it was still good, just a little thin at times, sweet, roasty, and tangy mouthfeel, soft carbonation, taste lingered a long time, what really makes this impressive is that is fifteen percent and you barely taste a drop of alcohol, I had to really look for it to even taste any, it was amazingly hidden, could drink a whole lot of this stuff and that would just get me into trouble because of its strength, fantastic drinkability, most amazing part of this brew, the attendees at the Beer Advocate Extreme Beer Fest will be lucky to have some of this stuff, too bad there is only a few kegs in existence, Patrick outdid himself with this one and I made sure I told him before I left, hope to have more as soon as possible, a blending masterpeice, highly recommended"
