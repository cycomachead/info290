"Booze & ABV are well hidden, a nice offering, not mind blowing"

"Served in a tulip at WOB Tempe. Surprised me with its power and then it's flavor. A delicious craft that reflects bourbon barrel aging without overpowering booze taste. A Belgian character without being a Belgian beer. Will order again and again. I feel the 9 percent without tasting it."

"O. This is a solid barley wine, but I don't know why it's not advertised that way?! The 1 pint 6fl. is probably a bit too much. I would prefer this if it were in a 4 pack 12oz, much like old stock ale which I would recommend before this beer."

"a real showcase of bourbon barrels here. tons of vanilla, sweetness, wood, and warming alcohol in this brick red colored brew with extraordinary depth. shortish off white head caps off a dark and intriguing brew. the nose here is heavily oaked, with notes of dried cherries and brown sugar. i smell a little alcohol too, but nothing out of place. sweeter red malt starts the flavor trip, but its mellowed nicely by all the oak, which now gets a bit more nuanced with char, must, and tremendous vanilla character. layers of grain and wood compliment each other well, and all the residual sugar i anticipated from the nose is about gone, or at least not slowing this down at all. a very cool beer, soaked with rich bourbon flavors but still being rather drinkable, i could take down a bomber of this without a worry. decadent mouthfeel with just a tickle of booze and a very long finish like warm bread pudding. one of marbles best beers, i hope they make it back to colorado before long, i think they have all brought something unique to the table."

"O- A good beer and one I enjoyed, but I also would have like more expression on the nose. The taste was great and I only expect more character from the bottles that I age."

"Pours a clear orange-red with a foamy khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, and slight bourbon aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel and bourbon flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I think the barrel aged presence is slightly better in the taste."

"O - Overall, not a bad beer. The appearance was exceptional but everything else was just solid. Bit boozy and sweet. Glad to try it but not blown away like I had thought I would be."
"Pours a dark amber with garnet accents capped by a cream colored two finger head. Huge amount of gobs of splotchy lacing. A bouquet of dark fruit, underlying oakiness, light bourbon accents, and vanilla on the nose. Dates upfront, hints of plum, and currants joined by caramel and toffee notes midpalate. Finishes with a bit of apple peel, a bit of hop bitterness, and bourbon soaked oak. Big full body; syrupy but lightened by some fluffy creaminess. This really is a fantastic brew. If you have the means make sure to acquire a bottle."

"O: Great beer, glad I got to try it. Not available here.... sent on a recommendation in a trade for BBA stouts... Glad I tried it! Would cellar one if I had it."
"Overall, a nice bourbon beer. Still a bit on the sweet and boozy side but had some interesting flavors."
""
""
""
"Overall: Not spectacular, but very good. Marble is getting better at these barrel aged beers. I'd take their barrel aged imperial stout over this, but it's definitely worth trying."

"Wonderful overall beer. very heavy vanilla smell and taste. pours think smells great but if vanilla isnt your thing dont come near this. Good alcohol burn that is masked well with the creamy sweetness. Split it, dont tackle this by yourself i fear that it would be similar to going after a pint of ice cream taste great with regrets later."
"O - overall, I'm really impressed with the value here...$12 for this beer is amazing. It's got great flavor and honestly, that's where this one shines. Mouthfeel and nose are less than impressive, but the Abv and flavor notes are great."
"Could use just a touch more rounding.. Not sure I could drink a ton of this, but very glad I tried it. Iâ€™ll grab another to see what it does in time... Beware: this brew packs a serious punch. Awesome, brew Marble, just awesome!!!"

"Overall this is delicious. It is definitely trying to be Backwoods Bastard, which is fine. It's not as good as the aforementioned favorite, but it's very good, and probably mislabeled here as an American Strong Ale. Must try. Cheers."
"Thanks quirkzoo for another new beer in this great BIF."
"I've been on a good-beer roll that's really going to dent my reputation as a crank; I need to choose something shitty, soon. This isn't. It morphed from good to excellent as it warmed. Very nice. Can't wait to try the stout."
""
""
"D: If it weren't for that unknown bite this would be great. I have a second bottle I'm going to age and I hope in a year or two when I try it again that sting will be eliminated."
"A deep and complex brew; nicely put together and a pleasure to drink. I'll be looking for some more bottles to sip on during the upcoming colder months..."

"22oz bottle purchased on sale for $9.99. Wasn't sure about this one but it was quite solid. Red color, decent ring of bubbles. Aroma is real nice, brown sugar, bourbon barrels, hint of alcohol. Flavor follows the nose closely, oak, vanilla, good stuff. This feels like an old ale or barleywine and it sort of reminds me of Abacus and Bligh's in a way but it falls just a bit short. Still for $10 it was well worth the money."

"Not as tasty as expected. Good, but not great, and absolutely not worth what Boulders charged me for it."
""
"The pour is amber in color with a small off-white head. Has a pretty nice nose on it. Good bourbon and vanilla with plenty of oak and brown sugar. A nice caramel sweetness to go with some hints of dark fruit. The flavor is nice, but not quite as much so as the aroma. A bit thin with brown sugar, toffee, and dark fruit notes. Some bourbon and vanilla, but not the same level of intensity as the nose had."
""
"After the Marble BA imperial stout Josh brought last time, I had high hopes for this brew. It's still nice, though not nearly as impressive. But who can blame a BA for buying a nice-looking, waxed bottle?"
"O- Nice beer that has good barrel aged characteristics."
"Wanted to give this a 4.25 for taste so I made up with it for a 4.5 overall. Great under the radar brew. Barrel aging meld pretty damn well. Thanks egrace84."

"Overall: I really enjoyed the caramel and vanilla bourbon notes. This brewery is two for two as far as I'm concerned. I would definitely have another."
"Overall Drinkability: This was pretty good, but Abbey darkness is better."
"Overall: Another exceptional seasonal release. This is one which ages gracefully, but is also exceptional fresh."
"The beer is transparent and fairly dark brown with a quarter inch or so of tan head that leaves some decent lacing on the snifter. The aroma brings caramels, malt, oak, booze. Nice flavor, with a prominent oak barrel presence throughout. Vanilla and bourbon impart a lasting sweetness that is balanced by a tannic, oaky character. Medium bodied and creamy. Overall, a solid beer and a nice surprise, as this beer wasn't on my radar. Recommended."
"Beer is medium in body and good, hides the alcohol well in a malt backbone that dominates the beer. The finish isn't too bitter or dry, a nice bodied beer with good connectivity, I'd have ti again."
"Pours brown with a nice tan head. Average lacing and a bit of a collar on the way down. The nose carries caramel with some bourbon and oak notes in the background. The flavor focuses on the oak bourbon barrel character, and also presents a touch of vanilla. Average duration of the flavor through the finish with some slight sweetness and a relatively-full, creamy mouthfeel. Well done."

"My bottle neck was dipped in black wax and the date was 12-14-10. I bought it in Santa Fe last summer so it must be a year old."
""
"This is a great beer. I consider myself fortunate to have gotten my hands on it and would happily have another if given the opportunity."
"O: Very much enjoyed this one."
"D. Very drinkable. It seems like time is definitely on this beer's side. I'll sit on my last one for a few more months and then try it all over again. I can't wait!"
"Overall: This was very tasty. I'd never heard of this brewery and I had to put my sunglasses on to mask the tears welling up in my eyes when I beheld my empty glass. My voice betrayed me, cracking a few times as I tried to speak in false hearty tones about all the great sours on the list I was looking forward to trying. I was unable to hide my sorrow so I eventually sat silently and braced myself as grief consumed me."
"Good on you guys, Marble. Still not sure this was quite worth the price tag (I've had beers just as good in the $9-10 range), but it's damned good, and not too sweet (for my tastes) like it seems all of the English old ales I've tried have been. My one tiny complaint would be that the dark fruits from the aroma did not carry into the flavor terribly well, but that seems to be par for the course."
"D: WOW! Best bourbon wood-aged beer I have ever tasted. Hesitated buying b/c I have never even been able to come close to finishing a bourbon beer. This one I could drink all night (or until I pass out). Fantastic beer."
"This was my first time having the highly regarded Marble Reserve and I really couldn't be happier. It's in the same field as Angel's Share or FW14, which are two of my favorite beers, but much liter in color and body, and therefore is really unique to me."
"Drinkability is high, but I'm going at it slow because this is such a complex and intriguing beer. I have had a decent amount of beer that spent time in various barrels (wine, bourbon, etc), but this is unlike any other beer I have tried. It would be damn near perfect if it weren't for the higher alcohols that are still present."
"Drinkability - 4.0/5.0 - Price tag is a big high, which makes this a very delicious, but OCCASIONAL, treat!"
"Age has been kind to this one. It still has a lot of bourbon flavor and significant heat, but the sweetness has diminished and new notes of roasted nuts, dates, and marzipan are emerging. The flavors are meshing together nicely. This beer is more like an old ale than it was 2 years ago. The mouthfeel has lost much of the grainy roughness it had the first time I tried it, and is now almost oily. I wish I had another bottle; this vintage tastes like it could easily go another couple years."
