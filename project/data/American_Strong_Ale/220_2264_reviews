"A small hint of brown sugar, this is a smooth beer that prances all over your tongue."

"Beautiful amber color, deliciously sweet and hoppy...different, but good balance. Slightly boozy nose, sweet on the tongue and finishes with just a hint of bitterness."

"O: [3.75] This beer looks great in a glass. It leaves tremendous lacing as it is enjoyed.  The nose is just weak.  I can't zero in on anything to hold on to.  The flavor is sweet and delicious - not like other beers that I can think of.  This might be a nice dessert beer (typically a role filled by stouts).  I can't imagine drinking more than 1-2 of these at a time.  There is a lot of sweetness happening it might pile up."

"Beautiful reddish amber. Roasted malt, pepper, and fruit on the news. The taste is much the same with lots of sweetness and alcoholic bite. It's great. I'd get it again."
"(Retrospect: maybe it's the slightly sweet-cum-boozy undertone that makes people go nuts for it? I don't know; I couldn't get into it.)"

"One of the best tasting beers I've had"

"This used to be one of my favorite beers. There was the mystery of them stopping production for a few years-- maybe it was just too good. Why anybody stops making a successful beer needs an answer. It's just unfortunate it seems to be lost forever. From the 12 oz bottle in a six pack tha has been tough to get through. But when you need a bedtime beer with the right punch, you can overlook the taste."

"Sweet smell, crisp, bitter taste. This is a real winner!"
"Just a touch of mediciney aftertaste deters from an otherwise pretty nice beer."
"Wonderful beer. Perfect amount of sweetness. I will be buying this again for sure."
""
"Strong and super tasty, excellent brew."
""
""
""
""
"I’m probably giving in to the marketing too much but I swear that I can catch the faint essence of brown sugar.  This beer certainly paired well with baked ham and potatoes for a classic Sunday dinner with the family."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The malt flavor is still there, but the Lagunitas' hops run the show while the malt compliments the hops. Easily drinkable at 9.9 percent and a fantastic beer."
""
""
"Great dessert beer on it's own or pared with something. Beautiful colour and very nice nose. Taste is a little too malty for my taste but it masks the high abv pretty well. Nice sweet caramel flavour. Lagunitas just make great beers no matter style."
""
"Would seek out and purchase again."
""
""
"This is a ****ing great beer! I think it's a little too sweet for a dinner but great after a good meal, skip the desert!"
"Overall: It's fairly difficult to classify this beer - doesn't really come off like a typical American barleywine, but it's very good."
"It has been several years since I have had this beer. It is pretty darn good. I actually pretty much like all Lagunitas beers, but I typically buy Ohio and Michigan beers since I'm a homer."
""
"Hoppier than expected for something called Brown Shugga - guess I expected something sweet and maltier.  Still good."

"O: Very nice balance between tastes and aromatics."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice blend of bitter and sweet. A solid beer from a solid brewery"
""
""
""
""
""
"A very good beer that firing on all cylinders,"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Big, rich, sticky sweet, and delicious. Rarely do I buy a 6ers, but in this case it was a very  wise investment. The more I drink it, the more I love it."
""
"It is a decent beer."
"This one is rich in feel, which is fitting since I've just recently polished off a paczki (a rich, donut-like fruit or cream filled pastry eaten on Fat Tuesday). Sip this one, savor it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours nice dark copper color with thick, long lasting head. Very aromatic smell, decent taste, overall ok beer"
""
""
""
""
"O – This definitely falls between an American Barleywine and a Double IPA, nice malt and hop presence."
""
"At first taste I thought this was a unique and complex beer, but when it was finished I don't really know where to go with this one. The nose and taste starts with carmalized citrus and ends dry and hoppy with an alcohol bite. Its a mix between an IPA and a barley wine, and I don't think it pulls off that balance in the end. I'm glad I was able to try it."
"Poured a solid dark amber with a slight foamy off-white head.  Smell is sweet and hoppy - brown sugar, caramel, honey.  Beautiful.  Taste is also sweet with a relatively mild kick considering it's (!) 9.9 ABV %.  I honestly can't believe it has a 9.9 ABV % -- this is a VERY easy beer to drink.  One of the most impressive beers I've had in a very long time."
""
""
""
""
"Crystal clear, bready, harmonious caramel/brown sugar and hops, with perfect (not-over-the -top) stickiness to compliment its flavor profile. I love savoring this beer and letting the hops build up, sip after sip. May not be for everyone, but the fresher the better in my book!"
"A nice solid ale with flavors of honey, brown sugar, malt, and a beautiful spicy and earthy hop feel. The aroma is that of flowers and sweet caramel candy."
""
""
""
""
"Love this beer fresh, starts getting really interesting with a little age too."
"O - This is one of the better strong ales I've enjoyed, handles the combination of bitterness and sweetness well, making it a pleasure to drink.  With a 10% ABV, this is one that I'm glad comes as a 12 oz. (wish more beers did).  Excellent."
""
"O : I love this beer kinda taste little like stone ipa but 100 times better and it has brown sugar come on who dont love brown shugga"
""
""
""
""
"I don’t know if it’s age, undiagnosed brain damage, or happenstance, but this is the second beer in a row that tastes nothing like the prior incarnation I recall from years prior.  I remember this as a sweet, brown brew (you know, kinda like the name “Brown Shugga” would suggest), not the amber hop bomb I have before me.  As far as a pale ale goes, this isn’t half bad, but it’s not at all what I was expecting."
""
"O: Even after a year is beer is still intense. Tastes like a hoppier and less thick Barleywine. I preferred this over the fresh bottles, and I believe this will hold up for even more years in the cellar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap in tulip glass. Appearance: deep amber color, slight white head leaves some lacing on the glass. Some carbonation evident. Aroma: caramel, rich barley malt syrup, earthy and citrus hops, and a slight yeasty funk. Mouthfeel: medium bodied, silky mouthfeel with some alcohol warming in the throat. Flavor: brown sugar, caramel, cookie dough, bread crust and moderate hop bitterness. Overall: well done for easy sipping on a cold winter night."
""
""
""
"Brew pours a beautiful copper in color with a good 2+-finger foamy off-white head. A decent amount of ring-lacing was seen when sipped that stuck to the glass. The aroma is of burnt brown sugar and yeast for the most part. Lots going on with the taste than the nose would have you think as there is some caramel, pine, hops with a hint of dark fruits. Great taste but has a slight bitter hoppy finish that lasted a bit too long for my liking. You can't taste the alcohol at all, which is strange since it is so close to 10%! Has a great flavor but that bitter/hop finish kind of ruined it for me. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation."
""
"Yummy!! No complaints. This is a great beer: hoppy, malty and just makes you feel good!  :)"
""
"O: Completely solid, tasty beer, very drinkable for 10%, yet very nice as a sipping beer too.  Not super interesting, but it does have some complexity to it for sure.  I would completely recommend this beer."
""
""
""
""
"This is a potent brew that is usually a ""one and done"" for me. Worth trying but not something I will seek out in the future."
""
"It was alright. nice strong ale."
"Tasty, but I couldn't drink more than one at a time.  Just not my style of beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I wouldnt really consider this a brown ale. DFH 90 minute IPA seems to have just as much if not more malt in it as this. This is just a DIPA on the maltier side. With that being said, id consider this and 90 minute the best beers in that regard. And perhaps even Great Divide Herculese. All are great examples of a malty IPA done right. This one has a great balance between bitter hops and sweet malt, and goes down extremely smooth, especially considering the abv. Id rather go for a Lil Sumpin Sumpin, Hop Stoopid,  or Sucks, but as far as a malty IPA goes, this is a winner."
""
""
""
""
"O: I knew nothing about this brew before I tried it, so it was  a bit of a surprise.. But a good surprise.  Dank, hoppy, and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very enjoyable beer with a complex flavor profile that I thoroughly enjoyed."
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  Great beer.  Will have again."
"Perfect balance of sweet, bitter, hoppy citrus, and high ABV."
""
""
"A great brown ale for IPA/Pale ale pallets.  Love the golden brown color, not a true brown but a nice looking beer.  Nose is malty with a hint of pine.  Pours a big bubble head that fades fast but leaves a nice lace.  Probably my favorite brown ale, but I'm not a connoisseur of the style.  I typically avoid sweeter beers."

"A little sweet and boozy for my taste. Interesting enough, but dont care to drink another anytime soon."
""
"With its sparklingly-clean caramel color, Brown Shugga' is really a brew of rare breed: heavy and strong, clean and shiny, balanced and smooth, a bit woody and benevolently saccharine, big but also blithely self-assured.  Indeed: the brewer's belief that ""this Special Ale is Something Unique"" seems anything but misplaced."

""
""
"For hoppy beer fans, you'll love this. The sugar doesn't quite come to the fore like I'd hoped, but the look is beautiful, nice creamy foam after pouring, leaving lacing as it falls and taste is decently complex. With floral and fruity notes, the finish is bitter."
""
"Overall:  Damn, this is a great beer!  I love the balance between hops and sweet!  Lagunitas, you knocked it out of the park with this one!"
""
"One of the best beers I've ever had. End of sentence."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"To me it tastes like a sweet double bastard. Good beer though strong too at 9.99% abv!"
""
""
"O-A fascinating beer with a unique combination of hops, malt, sugar. The malt presence becomes apparent first, the sweetness comes through next, and then it finishes with a hop bitterness."
""
"Love the complexity of flavor along with a little kick, but not a strong alcohol taste. Well made quality beer at a bargain price."
"Awesome beer. With name thought it might lean to sweet but surprised that had decent hops. Great seasonal beer and thankful I bought last 6er today. Really nice look and smooth."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overal this is a fantastic strong ale and so different with that brown sugar."
""
""
"Not to into this one. The taste is strong. Not my drink"
""
"Transparent red color.  Sweet malty smell with some hops. Sweet, booze, hops on the taste. Good medium body.  Yummy."
"On tap at City Taphouse in Philly."
"Strong piney finish. I am not convinced that the ""shugga"" and the hops balance one another."
""
""
""
""
"Reminds me of 120 ipa a lot"
""
""
""
"Dissapointing beer in my opinion."
"Sweeter than I imagined.  Hmmm."
""
"Usually not a fan of sweet but this is an exception to that"
"When I had it the second time ( cause I forgot I tried it) It was a different beer - leading me to believe that Scotty's brew house had a bad keg"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't know if I am drinking the same beer as some people?  I was not sold on this one. Good feel to the beer and nice light carbonation as others have pointed out. However that was about it for me. Didn't smell good, too sweet on the front  and the after taste is as if someone poured cheap vodka in my beer."
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied and has a nice drinkable feel to it. There is a nice smoothness that has a great silky feel"
""
"no, I would not buy again"
""
""
""
"I have to say, if I set out to get drunk off of some good beer, this would be a good starting point."
""

""
"Solid all around.  Warms me up, taste of brown sugar. Better than 'sucks to me."
""
""
""
"Powerful stuff. Strong appealing bitter taste."
"Taste: Strong, and very much a heavily-hopped ale, yet the brown sugar steers this one somewhere different, and away from the usual Imperial IPA territory (where this would be firmly categorized as, if not for this surprising infusion). There’s a bitterness present, but also plenty of toasty, sweet maltiness, and a dry, warming finish as well. A unique, heavy, and thoroughly enjoyable experience!"
""
""
"Poured from bottle.  Big frothy head, definitely sweet.  A little balance from the hops but the added sugar dominates.  A little peppery bite from the alcohol, but went down easy for 9.9%."
"Very good beer from lagunitas"
"strong, taste the name, solid sippin brew"
""
"overall: Essentially, outside of Maryland offerings, my first foray into craft beer, and I'm really pleased with this. This is the first of a sixer and I'm certainly looking forward to the rest!"
"Another good one from Lagunitas"

"I was disappointed with this brew. With all of the talk about brown sugar and such, I thought this beer would be sweeter, and have a richer malty taste. Instead I got practically an IPA. It's not a terrible beer, but overall was not a fan of the flavor."

""

"Was not what i was expecting.  Maybe the smell was so awesome that the taste couldn't compete.  Like smelling a flower and its awesome, yet eating it not so good.  Hope that made sense.  I'm definitely going to have another and review it once again.  Was still very complex with tons of tastes that i loved.  Had this on tap Saturday.  And now im certain the bottles i had before were bad.  Much better this time around."
""
"Overall it was good just had a slightly lighter body and heavier alcohol flavor than I expected."
""
"This beer was not what I expected. It was given to me and I was just going off the name. Without reading any of the label but the name, I thought it was going to be a brown ale. It poured into a pint glass with a beautiful copper color and the fluffy creamy white head immediately came to life, and stayed! It left quite a bit of lacing with each sip. Boy, what a nice looking ale. When I smelled it, the hops drifted up but not too strong, with some nice malts to blend in. The taste was just wonderful. The fact that I was completely caught off guard with the type of beer this was really enhanced the favors for me. No preconceived notions. The hops was right up front but not too strong. Think of a mild IPA. The malts were just right but what knocked it out of the park for me was the sweet flavors. Then I read the label. Brown cane sugar! It really works well with the malty flavors to produce what has become a new favorite of mine. It was not overly carbonated nor to thin. It was just right for me. While the sweetness of the cane sugar may be too much for some, this is one ale you should try. I was also very surprised to see that it had a 9.99% ABV! It completely disappears into what I think is an excellenty crafted ale. Kudos Lagunitas!"
""
""
"wn sugar note.  Mouthfeel is medium and smooth.  Overall, a pretty good winter beer."
""
"Tried this again. Still a little cloying but has excellent hop profile. My first single bottle I tried most have been too old. Cheers!"
""
"Overall:  I enjoyed this beer and would gladly drink it again.  It was an easy to drink beer with a unique flavor, but not something that I would go out of my way for.  I think the hype surrounding this beer might have left me disappointed, though a very nice beer none the less."
""
""
""
"Great hoppy smell and look but tastes pretty sweet with a very noticeable alcohol taste. Lagunitas sucks is a lot better"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"You can taste a faint hint of burnt sugar upfront but it gives way nicely to a medium malt / hop exchange...a little piney on the back at first but mellows as it warms...just sweet enough to add dimension but not sugary..."
"I will give this a higher rating because I can see why people like it. It does have a depth of flavor and is somewhat unique. However, I did not care for it as it was to bitter for me."
"Deep red mahogany color. Pine, alcohol and cooked sugar aroma translates into similar flavors, somehow masking the alcohol somewhat. Syrupy and smooth feel makes this surprisingly drinkable. A bit dangerous."
""
""
""
"- at 10%, goes down way too easy"
"Typical Lagunitas style beer which means well made. This is a sweet beer so be prepared. High ABV noticeable but blends well. Recommend letting it sit to room temp which improves smooth mouth feel. Strong caramel alcohol laced aroma. The sweet alcohol taste takes over the malt and hops, but not too hoppy. Two stage beer. First the overall beer flavors followed by heavy ""brown shugga"" that lingers in the back of the mouth and tongue."
""
""
"Love this beer, a nice hop flavor in a dark brown ale. It was a lil better last year but still very tasty"
""
"It was pretty hard to believe this beer was nearly 10% ABV, as it drinks very easily. Has a very interested balance of malty sweetness and west coast hops. A Must try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Beautiful appearance, sort of a cross between an imperial IPA and an American barley wine. Unique and wroth trying."
""
"Beautiful lacing (tulip), and pleasantly aromatic.  Warm, almost rummy, alcohol finish.  Drinks very well considering the 10% ABV.  I will go back to this time and again.  Well done."

"-Using a Belgian yeast like in Sumpin Wild"
"Overall: Not what I was expecting; but it was a very good an enjoyable beer. Wish it was just a bit stronger on the brown sugar character."
"Overall: I really did like the fresh hop character in the nose and I'm really a fan of more malt forward beers (not a hop head like some craft beer connoisseurs). I also really like that this beer comes in a six pack. It gives me a chance to try it over the next few months to see the hop character fade and the brown sugar maltiness come to the forward. I don't think it was a very expensive 6-pack either. $12-13 I think. That is an excellent value for money when you consider that this is the better part of 10% alcohol. The use of cheap brown sugar instead of the more expensive malted barley. Great job Lagunitas!"
"A beautiful deep orange/amber body with a hefty 2 finger tan head. Nice lacing on the glass as the head dissipates. Smells hoppy like an IPA, but without as much citrus. I'm getting mostly brown sugar and hops. Mouthfeel is bitter and dry. Definite alcohol warmth and a numbing mouthfeel as beer warms. Overall, looks can be deceiving. Expected something more with this one, but certainly worth the $2 from a local Ohio grocer."
""
"served in a goblet from draft. definitely lagunitas with the intense aroma, thick mouthfeel and good lasting roasty taste. not dry or sweet, good new age style interpretation"
""
""
""
""
""
"Going to rate this better than average, but with the caveat that I didn't care for it.  There is a hop bitterness that cuts through the sweetness that I am not able to stand."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful amber.Very thick white head. Hoppy smell, sweet and spicy. Taste is sweet with hops and malt balanced very well. Strong: 9.9%abv. It is a very good beer from a mix n match sampler."

"Pours golden amber with a good lazy head of foam.  Off white.  Bright clarity lots of bubbles floating upwards.  Nose is sweet malt and brown sugar.  Orange.  Taste is brisk sweet and kissed by a rich depth.  Finishes dry and with an alluring bitter.  Medium mouthfeel."
""
"O:  Great beer at a great price with a nice ABV.  This one will keep nicely."
""
""
""
"Good mouth feel. Yeasty bready taste. Tasty brew, but too sweet for session beer in my opinion"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Up yours!"
""
""
""
"Overall- Wonderful balance to this beer, sweet sugary malts and bitter hops. A rather good marriage than a contrast of styles, both aspects blend well together. A very sticky feel, bright and fruity."
"12 oz bottle.  Pours clear amber with tall, long-lasting, foamy white head and nice lacing.  Aroma is citrusy hops, bready malt, caramel and ripe fruit.  Body is medium and slightly crisp.  Bready, caramel malt, sugar candy, ripe fruit, herbal, citrusy hops and alcohol nicely balanced on the palate.  Finish is long and dry.  Delicious, dangerously easy to drink brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a big, full bodied beer with a sweet caramel nose and body with pleenty of bittering hops to balance things out.  Really nice and pretty easy drinking albeit with some hot alcohol notes."
""
""
"Overall this brew is a hard to miss for the winter time. For sure a best ""bang for your buck"" beer when it comes to hoppy strong beers that you can get almost anywhere."
""
"I was looking forward to this one, and afterwards I am kind of ""meh"" about it. I like hop bitterness in my beer, but this has an odd bitter note at the end that I did not like. I tried two and gave the rest of the six pack a good home with a friend who likes this style beer more than me."
""
""
" This is the first American Strong Ale I have rated. I don't know what to make of this style in the sense that it feels like an IPA to me. I would like to rate other examples of this style to compare. Nevertheless, I'm impressed by this one. It is quite intense and the high ABV gives you quite the pleasant buzz!"

"Good beer. Missing a bit more sweetness but overall solid"
""
"Huge head, nice balance between pine and molasses-y malt. Fantastic winter brew."
""
""
""
"Bitter, burnt sugar notes throughout"
""
"O: An enjoyable beer, but I would prefer a little less intensity of the hop flavors in favor of more malt or spice complexity. Overall, enjoyable, but seems more a true IPA our double IPA than a strong ale."
"Bitter but not a big hop guy good for an ale"
""
""
"Very tasty.  Hoppy as most Lagunitas beers are but not overly so.  Nice malt blend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am not a Pale Ale guy, but this one is great because it is well balanced with sweetness, malt and spice. The fact that it is 9.9% abv and tastes this good is impressive to put it mildly."

"Great smooth beer. Carmel, brown sugar. Really well balanced."

"I admit that I'm a Lagunitas fan. That being said, I still think this is a wonderful, full bodied ale. There is an amazing mix of hoppiness and sweet malt that lets neither dominate but allows both to stand forward. The ABV is certainly there so be careful. Even so, you don't really taste it. Another good ale from Lagunitas!"
"Not too bad but ok. Can't drink it all night."
"Nice amber color, transparent with a thin off-white head. Smells of hops. There is another odor I can't quite pin, possibly grapefruit? Tastes like a slightly sweet IPA. I didn't get the brown sugar taste I was expecting until my glass warmed a bit."
""
""
""
""
"bone colored head, small streams of minor carbonation rising to the top. icy hop aroma with some sweetness mixed in. a little metallic aroma in the smell. metallic in the taste. kind of tin-ny. sweet. some underlying hops but bitter nonetheless. getting sweeter. caramel-ly. overall, a decent brew."
""
"I loved this one.  Slightly sweet.  It is about what you would expect for a 10% beer and much less sweet than you would expect due to the name.  The hops balance out this beer quite nicely as it is very hoppy with a nice nose.  A hopped up barleywine is the best way to describe this bargain of a beer."

"12 oz Bottle.Lagunitas rarely ever lets me down and this is no exception. I like it.Give it a try."

"This beer is awesome. It has a taste and an aroma all it's own It doesn't follow a style or try to fit into a niche. It's just good. If you like barleywines and old ales you'll love it. If you like Ipa's and Dipa's you'll love it. Wish it was available year round."

"Great beer. Drank this one from the bottle and i was not disappointed it really does live up to the hype. VERY tropical. A lot of pineapple going on with some mellowed out tropical skittles. Very sweet but what would you expect with a name like brown shugga. It has pretty good bitterness going on in the back too."

"O (4.25) – I’m kinda new to Lagunitas stuff, and had heard a lot about this one.  I thought it was good, but not top shelf, run all over town to buy, type of beer.    Nice beer, and I’d add to my rotation."

"Not too bad in my opinion"
""
""
""
""
"Poured a nice clear reddish Amber color with a great fluffy off-white three finger head. Great head retention and beautiful lacing all the way to the bottom of the glass. The smell is fruity and floral, with citrus and piney notes, and just a bit of malty sweetness. The taste is fantastic, with some sweet malty flavors, some wonderful fruity and grassy flavors- just great! The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with just a light touch of prickly carbonation. Overall, this is one great beer- what I've come to expect from Lagunitas."

"Pretty good, not sure what to make of it.  Tastes like an IPA, but slightly different.  Hard to put my finger on it."

"This is one of my favorite Holiday Seasonal brews.  I've had Sucks now for a long time and this is the first time I've seen Brown Shugga' and I was blown away!"
""

"Solid hoppy beer from start to finish"
""
""
""
"This was a pleasant surprise (and only a 9.99 sixer), and lives up to the rep. Beautiful pour. Nice clean piney aromas and notes, as well as a healthy malt presence. Love the brown sugar addition. Pine keeps it clean. Evolves and changes in the glass. I will buy this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours with a frothy white head that takes a long time to dissipate.  Tons of lace on the sides of the glass.  Color is copper and clear.   Smells of passion fruit and honey.  As it warms, this becomes something of a hop bomb, with citrus and piney notes.  Sweet on the tongue, with a fairly abrupt, bitter finish.  A complex, lovely beer."

"My first one of these. Found a couple at the back of the shelf at my beer store. Pours a nice caramel clear color with a big bad head and really nice lacing. Aroma is of hops and sweetness, kinda nice. The hop bitterness and the brown sugar hit at the same time, providing a very pleasant blend of flavors. They are balanced so well that they are fighting each other to be on top. Sugar leaves a little in the aftertaste, leaving a nice cool hop bitterness with a touch of citrus rind, not bad. Overall, I am happy with this brew, as I am with everything Lagunitas has put out !!!!!"

"Side Note: Those that are familiar with Stone's Lukcy Basartd will find a strong correlation with regards to the flavor and aroma profile of each. Thankfully, Brown Shugga is an seasonal release and the other is way more limited."

"For some reason I've never tried this one. Poured into a snifter. Nice head. Great dark amber color. Smells of sweet candy, grapefruit, and some dank hops as well. Flavor up front is fairly sweet with candy type flavors and then the fruity hops hit on the back end and balance this brew out nicely. Great flavor for a winter DIPA. Can't detect the near 10% ABV. This will definitely get a repeat visit to my fridge this winter."

"I easily get 2 fingers of crackling light tan foam with a easy pour.  Retention is solid and leaves a considerable wall of lace with consistent holes throughout.  Body is a deep red amber in tone.  Nose is an interesting balance of both sweet and hoppy.  You get both grassy hops and sassafras candy in the smell.  Taste is of resin based hops and chewy sassafras candy resembling the nose considerably.  Well balanced between the malt and the hops this is scary easy to drink for nearly 10% alcohol.  I am really in love with Lagunitas this year, they have been so consistent.  I am putting extras of these away in the cellar to see what magic works in a brew that I believe will age spectacularly well."

"This is one mother of a beer! One of the best strong ales I've had and the sad thing is I can only get it this time of year. If you take a breathe of this in, it's like sticking your nose in a bag of brown sugar. Very sweet up front on the nose. Goes down malty, fig, cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, a mildly spiced brew. Overall, I am in love with this beer. I wish they did some variety for this, age it in some whiskey, bourbon, rye barrels. Give it an even better kick."

"Such goodness contained in one 12oz bottle, that I can't take it. It looks like a dark double IPA. Dark amber colored pour with a 2 inch head that lingers for a minute or two. First thing I smell when cracking the bottle is.... you guessed it! BROWN SUGAR! not overly sweet knock you out brown sugar aroma, just a nice deep smell that isn't over powering. Also smells of tropical and piney hops, not much of a malt smell. The taste is just awesome, exactly like the aroma. This is so easy to drink it's dangerous. I'd even go to say that it's easier to drink than a pale ale. It's just so smooth being 9.99% ABV. In conclusion,  this is one of the best beers I've ever tried. Thanks Lagunitas."
"dig this one"

"If you combined a nice American Barleywine, with a nice DIPA, and added a touch of brown sugar sweetness, you might end up with something like this.  And if you also priced it very generously, and only released it during the long dark days of winter--when a nice, sweet, cheap and strong beer is most welcome--you'd probably be pretty close to answering the conundrum, ""How come you taste so good..."""
""
"Its pretty good...and very drinkable....but I was expecting better....I remember this being better then this! I dunno....guess you have to try it! I got a case! half gone so its not that bad!! lol Its better then bad its good?"

"Almost too drinkable for the high ABV."

"I must say I was a bit disappointed with this brew. Reading the reviews I imagined I was in for a unique malt forward, perfectly balanced strong ale. Instead I got something closer to an American barleywine. Overly hopped, out of balanced and one dimensional. One reviewer compared this to hairy eyeball. I disagree, as I feel that hairy eyeball is much more balanced and tastier than brown shugga. But as with everything else; if you've enjoyed this in the past then that's all that matters. Cheers!"

"Mild flavor with a nice sweetness."

"Pours a nice amber brown with a khaki head that leaves trails down the glasses. The smell is full of toasted malt and then citrus from the hops begins to come through. The taste was great with a nice balance. First some sweetness and wonderful grapefruit notes from the bitter hops. Very refreshing."

"Pours dark orange amber with a medium off white slowly fading head with good lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, yeast and some citrus and pine as well. Taste has some good caramel malt, yeast mild orange and bitter hops. Palate is a medium to full body, carbonation is good and a smooth mouth feel. Finishes with a good caramel malt and yeast flavor followed by citrus, orange notes and bitter ending for balance. Considering this is a barley wine it is not as strong, reminds me more of an DIPA, but it is still good. Overall very good, smooth, balanced and flavorful brew."

"Overall, a quality beer, although I'd sooner have the straight up DIPA ""substitute"" for this beer (Sucks) rather than this strong ale that straddles the line between DIPA and Barleywine. That said, it's one of those beers where the whole is certainly better than the sum of it's parts. No individual factor stood out to me, but when taken together, it's quite a tasty brew."

"So Alberta missed out on the Brown Shugga train this last season so I had to wind up in sunny (this time) Victoria BC to snag a 6-pack. How exactly do distributors make these sorts of decisions? In any event, I got to relive the experience and now can write a legit review of this beer on the basis of more than fuzzy memory traces (particularly fuzzy considering the ABV on this heavy hitter). Color is lighter than expected, a clear reddish brown with generous amounts of sturdy light beige head. Smell is intensely sweet and malty, yet with a hop presence that makes one think IPA, fruity with a wisp of pine. Is this beer a barleywine, a double IPA, or a key example of the shades of gray, ill-defined ""Americans strong"" category? Probably a hybrid that features elements of all these styles. The palate is extremely fruity for starters, fruit punch, grilled pineapple, and candied boozy peaches carrying the top note and some faint cherry and plum in the background. There is also a tangerine peel, pepper, and faint pine hop presence that serves to cut the heavy-duty brown sugar sweetness, and to my palate the sugar is not as prominent as the name and initial expectation might suggest. This beer is surprisingly drinkable, on the thin side of moderate, and the well-concealed booze makes things even more dangerous, although I find that the alcohol presence does grow over the course of a bottle or two. Moderate carbonation and finishes sweet yet with some added medicinal bitterness not apparent at the front end. Hoppier, lighter, and perhaps sweeter than its stablemate Hairy Eyeball but certainly a close cousin, with some IPA ancestry apparent as well. I'd drink this on a semi-regular basis if it was more available in my neck of the woods. Maybe my liver is glad it is pretty scarce."

"This beer is ridiculous. My liver hates it but I love it. Everything about this beer is over the top from the ABV to the taste but not so much that it is off putting. I have had beers in the 10 percent ABV range that taste like, well booze. But this one you can hardly notice it at all which is not entirely a great thing. I drank 4 of these before my wife got home and I was hammered, she was not happy, but I was."

"This is a very hoppy and all together sweet (from the malt sweetness and brown sugar) brew. Recommended for the winter and holiday season, or if you forget you have it and drink it in April!"
""
"Great beer with a distinctive taste, I would drink again. It is a nice change on the regular double IPA's. The aroma and taste smell of brown sugar and it goes down 'sweet'. If you can get this, give it a try, it's not something you will dislike."

"this is a great strong ale. if you get it fresh the hops pop through nicely and it isn't as sweet as the name suggests. it's a a very drinkable brew that definetly caught me off guard. the sweetness hits first but then it seems to turn into an american barley wine. great beer for the money. Lagunitas is the best value out of California out here in PA. A case of stone Ipa costs me 43 bucks while this is about the same price as this brew that is more complex and alcoholic. sucks is good but it's a totally different beer and is probably an easier drinking beer but if these two were side by side for the same price there's no question i'd pick the Brown shugga"
"Overall - I really love this beer, and while it is a sweet beer, it is not overly so at all, as the flavors are all very bold, and very balanced. Love the combination of citrus orange, carmel and brown sugar, pine and basil. I will always get at least a case of this every time it comes around. Must try!"
""
"O- This is a fine brew with an amazing amount of flavor coming at you but in a way that you can enjoy. Lagunitas has continued to impress me with their thoughtful brewing. Having tried the ""replacement ale"" I had to try this one as well. Well done."

""

"O: Alcohol sneaks up on you for this for one. Solid brew – lagunitas never disappoints."

"Very interesting beer. It is like an IPA but has that biting bitter hop finish and cloying sweetness of a barleywine. Almost a washed cheese rind flavor like trappist cheese. I can't tell if I really like it or not. Which may be why this beer has captured my attention. Its like stinky cheese; you don't particularly like it but keep coming back because of how different it is. I will be aging some bottles to see what happens. Good stuff but then again I'm not sure."
"I cannot believe that I have struck it lucky twice in a row with this brewery. I have had several from them until recently that have been less than celestial. But the last two have been wonderful, this one even better than the one aforementioned in my reviews. This one had a beautiful burnt sienna color the head was not overly lofty and it settled to a nice, yet carbonated tipple. The taste was sweet yet not overly saccharine. It had a nice malty component but not overly so and the hops, what little that I could detect hit with just the right amount of bite. Overall I would say this is one high quality brew and one I would definitely look for again when it arrives next year."
""
""

"This ale pours a deep mahogany amber hue with a small cream colored head that is short lived and gives way to a gentle off white lacing and thick alcohol legs. The mouthfeel is somewhat thick and sticky definitely coats every inch of your palate for a long time. The nose is very sweet with some nice hop notes and a definite alcohol vibe. This is not subtle, which is one of my favorite things about Lagunitas beers. The flavor is almost reminiscent of a barley wine. It is deep and malty with a hearty dose of west coast hops and a very strong alcohol bite on the finish. Im a huge fan if lagunitas but this beer is not quite my taste. It is very good just not my style."

"A reddish brown, golden amber color - very nice; cream head that has good retention and lacing. Aroma of sweet apple cider, or could be apple pie with a hint of cinnamon. Malty, with just a bit of hops bitterness. No standout indications that it is a high ABV brew. Just a little alcohol burn in the throat, but not until after a few sips... very smooth. Medium bodied with some nice sugar stickiness. This ale could be dangerous, but in a very good way! So good I had to force myself to sip and enjoy rather than gulp it down."

"Pours an opaque, dark ruby/copper with a half finger of frothy white head that dissipates quickly. A lot of sticky lacing. Nose is very hop forward with a mix of floral and pine hops. There are a lot of sweet, dark fruits mainly plum and cherry. A smooth balance of caramel and roasted malts. Mouth is very bitter and hoppy up front. A surprising amount of citrus is present with a strong grapefruit presence. That blends perfectly with the dark fruits. Very roasty with some booze, but it’s very well hidden."

"Amber hued with a slight reddish tint. Minimal thin layer of minuscule white foam on top. Nice Brussels lacing. Oddly I sniff and sniff but I don't get a ton of aroma. I know there's some brown sugar and maybe that's what has eliminated most of the smell? Taste is initially sweet,but generous hopping gives it a nice bitterness and then a sweetness returns in the fade. Mouthfeel seems a bit carbonated and that bitterness pricks the tongue."

"Overall (4/5): Brown Shugga is Lagunitas doing what Lagunitas does–sweet, hop-forward beer that's unique and affordable. While it's not perfect–it lacks a bit in the smell and mouthfeel categories–Brown Shugga' is still a quality beer. I would say Lagunitas should dial down the alcohol just a tad and try for a better carbonation level. That would help cut the booziness and give the mouthfeel a boost. Overall, definitely worth checking out; it's tasty!"

"Pours a clear goldish amber with dense white head and tons of lacing. The nose starts with some aromatic hops which is quickly joined by candy like malt notes. Notes of caramel, brown sugar (imagine that), and floral hops are all present. The taste starts with heavy sugar sweetness which is followed by a swift hop bitterness. The hops don't seem to cut the sweetness too much, rather it adds an earthy and floral component to the sweet malts and makes for some similarities to wildflower honey. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and has a somewhat sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a bit sweet for me and the hop character just isn't my favorite pairing."

"pretty good late night winter warmer! this thick. sweet semi syrupy brew is very original in its flavor profile. the booze keeps things warm and sippable throughout the sweet, hoppy experience . i thought this one was way better as it warmed. things were very smooth at slightly cooler than room temp, this is more like sipping brandy or cognac rather than drinking a beer. i am definitely warmed all over after one...it packs a punch."

"O - Despite a lower scoring, very enjoyable and very easy to drink, in fact too easy to drink considering the high ABV."
"O - I really enjoyed this beer. It's a sweet and bitter holiday-flavored treat that sits well on my palate. Certainly not as malty as an English Barleywine.  I understand why Lagunitas made fun of themselves for not releasing this and instead, substituted Lagunitas Sucks. It's a good beer at a really good price point for 10% ABV."
"O- a great big flavor IPA-style beer. Not sure the brown sugar/cane sugar made a huge difference flavor-wise when compared to the regular Lagunitas IPA, but it is a good beer all the same. Would be interested to try the two head-to-head for a comparison."

"O - An excellect strong ale. Another excellent brew from Lagunitas. Extremely drinkable for such high ABV at 9.9%. My new template for what an american strong ale should be. Well balanced, strong, smooth and drinkable."
""
"In the glass this was a very nice looking brew. A dark amber color with a nice full head the color of dirty straw. The lacing on the glass was very solid. A very strong smell of Carmel and malt hints of pine and herbs. The mouth feel was very creamy and sweet with a nice bitter on the back. The flavors are of carmel pine and dark fruits, the brown sugar is by far the most noticeable of the flavors but very well balanced. Even with an ABV of 9 this is a very easy drinkable brew. Went well with my lamb stew."
"I can't believe I missed out on this last year, but my year of waiting has paid off well. This is fantastic stuff - it is destined to fail in so many respects, but the malt profile, as well as the herbal backbone, meld so well with the addition of brown sugar that it really reveals that the gents over at Lagunitas seem to pretty much know what they're doing when they approach any beer recipe. I feel this would get too sweet if aged, as the hops provide a much needed bitterness to round things out. Recommended for sure."
"I tried to session this last year; bad idea. However, something to be slow-sipped and enjoyed during the frigid San Diego winter weather."

"A very enjoyable strong/festive/winter ale. Nothing too fancy, just a very tasty hop profile matched well with a solid malt backbone."
""
"Notes: A bit of a tweener. Big malt backbone and overall it's fairly sweet, but there is enough hops and alcohol to give it a zing. Pretty balanced between flavors, but bold flavors at the same time. Solid beer, especially at the price, but nothing outstanding. If you want a solid, high ABV at a pretty low price, then go for it."

"Overall this beer doesn't do it for me. I've still got that shitty bitter hop taste in my mouth. Gotta go and brush up. I suppose I was mislead by the label. I expected something more of sweet malts and less hops. But of course I should have known better. West coast beers= HOPS. I guess I slipped up."
""
""
""
""
"Nice beer. Will grab one again soon."
""
"Medium to full bodied mouthfeel with a slight boozy burn. After taste lingers for quite awhile making it a great sipper. One of the best parts of buying a lagunitas beer is not having to break the bank. 10 bucks for a sixer of nearly 10% ABV beer equals one heck of a deal. I'll grab at least one sixer every year."
""
"!2 oz. bottle in a snifter. Pours a clear amber with a moderate off-white head. Aroma is mango, grapefruit, orange, pine, and a bit of sugary sweetness. I don’t think any brewery creates such beautiful smelling beers as Lagunitas. Taste mostly follows the nose, with a slight malty taste at the back of the throat. That aftertaste is about the only thing reminding me that this is a barley wine. As usual, Lagunitas has created a superb brew."
""
""
""
"Strong? Check. Warming? Check. Sweet? Check. This beer had all of those attributes while never feeling sticky, sugary, or chewy. There was a lot to like here, even if it felt like an Ale that wanted to be a dessert beer. There wasn't anything else I could have picked up from the store that was quite like this and because the hop profile was so pronounced here, it kept this from feeling like an Imperial Brown Ale or a Barleywine that was brewed in America. Take this for what it's worth - a Strong Ale with lots of taste and body, even if it doesn't quite know what it wants to be. This one's worth savoring to over a good Rolling Stones anthology, as I'm certain that this will endure just as well as the song it's named after. Highly recommended as an alternative to the seasonal offerings currently on the shelf."
""
""

"Full round mouth with a sweet start and a bitter dry finish. Brown sugar and mango followed by bitter citrus and herbal notes. Beautifully balanced, crisp, sweet, bitter, and damn delicious. You can hardly notice the alcohol in this one."

"Everything else they brew i seem to love, but this, this is just not for me. I am trying to not be too hard on it. Well, first off, i used to have a cat years ago that would piss on the front door if i was sleeping and couldnt let him out, and this beer smells like what that cat was pissing. So right off, i am not too happy, but it could get better...Mouthfeel is ok, but damned if it doesnt taste like it smells, cat piss. I mustve had a funky assed cat cause at 16 when his bladder was iffy and he couldnt wait, he was pissing Brown Shugga. I just cant get over it. Not even sure i can give this a fair review because of it."
""
""
""
"O: As this warms up it gets sweeter but there isn't much there besides the sweetness and the alcohol taste. You can definitely smell the hops but they're hardly present in the flavor. I've had much better from Lagunitas. At $10.99 for a 6 pack, this is probably the last time I'll buy a pack."

"Pours a hazy amber color with a half-finger of white head that retains well. The nose has earthy hops, sweet dark malt, honey, and alcohol. The taste is sweet with a strong boozy quality, but it finishes bitter and dry like an IPA. Mouthfeel is a little bit creamy with medium carbonation. It's a unique beer. The definition of a sipper because the alcohol is overwhelming and it seems even higher than its 9.9% ABV."
""

"O- wow, really really good."
""
""
""
""

"Pours a clear medium amber with a full frothy head that laces very well. Full nose of pine and citrus hops against a sweet dark malt background. Medium carbonation and a medium heavy mouthfeel. An excellent taste is achieved with a balance towards the hops against a strong malt bill sweetness. Hop flavor is balanced but tilted slightly to the piney side but finishes with a grapefruit citrus note. Bitterness is noticeable on the clean finish and lingers with that 9.9% alcohol pleasant burn. An outstanding beer that shows what flavor is all about. All are there, but none predominates, making this a complex work of brewer art."

"When I first tried Brown Shugga last year, it was a borderline drain pour for me despite the fact that I've enjoyed similar beers (Double Bastard comes to mind). Something about the particular hop/grain bill didn't work for me. With some age, palate adjustment, probably both, it's clear that this is a great beer. Only hopheads need apply, though."
"Have had a few of beers from these guys and liked all of them but never blown away by any of them. This one almost gets there for me but not quite. It was a great small change of pace from the DIPA kick ive been on lately and still gets me my hop fix. Certainly the best lagunitas I've had. Looking fwd to the other 5 I have and will seek out more soon."
""
"O. This is a Lagunitas brew for s sure. Big backbone and hoppy. This one gets a little too sweet and not quite enough hop punch for me though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Unique beer. Wasn't expecting the amount of hops that came with it. Poured dark copper with a couple inches of head that stayed with me pretty much the entire time. Can't quite pinpoint the smell... Not please to but not repugnant either. Don't taste brown sugar though maybe cause of the amount if hops in it though it does have a sweetness mixed with the hops that makes it quite enjoyable. Alcohol will sneak up on you as it is barely noticeable. Gonna age a few of these and see how they develop."

"Overall this was an awesome beer. Great balance and lots of complexity."

"Overall - just what I'd hoped for: bold hoppy flavors softened by a light, sweet touch. A rich beer but not cloying. I'm trying this on a cold November night and this is just what I wanted in my beer today."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is definitely an interesting beer, although I'm really not sure what to make of it. I feel like they could have definitely gotten away with calling this a DIPA, although I guess they did a little better not attributing it to a style at all. I tend to like hoppy beers better when they're a little bit lower-ABV, and the brown sugar mixed with the booziness can make it seem a little sickly sweet occasionally, so I do have some problems with it. But the hop flavors are really nice, and the brown sugar is a nice addition, and it's definitely unusual and interesting, so I did really enjoy it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Brown Shugga is one beer that don’t fuck around. It packs a wallop in both flavor and alcohol. It is a little unbalanced but in a good way like one would expect from a Strong Ale. The malts dominate over a modest hop kick and the brown sugar comes through nicely in both flavor and aroma. Both tasty and robust. I would say one could cellar this but why wait. A great seasonal classic."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad stuff. Some more aggressive flavors at work in this beer than are found in any other Lagunitas offering. At 9.9% abv this beer means business, and it tastes like it means business too. It's the brawler of the Lagunitas portfolio. Still fun and fairly easy to drink despite its size."

""
""
"Overall: I'm highly pleased with this and looking forward to breaking out the next bottle. Another solid brew from Lagunitas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Brown Shugga' is exactly what the style implies. The hop character of an imperial IPA with the malt presence of a barleywine. At $9.99 a sixer it's pretty hard to pass up. Would I drink it again? Yes."
""
""
"Overall sweet and sticky, but not cloying, but still has a very large hop presence. Very well done and drinkable."

""
"O - Really well rounded beer. I like it much better than the fresh version. It seems to be a much smoother and easier drinking version."
""
"Tasty. Sweet. Strong and powerful. Odd after taste. A little like a good dip. Definitely taste and smell the brown sugar. Very mellow in your mouth. Sweet release is a good name as you have a hint of brown sugar in the after taste. Don't have any? Get some!"
""
""
""
""
"O- This is my first time having it. It's different than my typical IPA's and stouts. At 9.9% ABV, it's really drinkable. I think this is a great fall/winter offering. You can't beat the price of this 6-pack for the amount of alcohol in the beer. Even though I did enjoy this beer, I'm not sure if I'd pick up another 6 pack. But, it's well crafted and something I'd expect from Lagunitas."
""
""
""
""
""
"A great beer, Lagunitas is one of those breweries that I can buy anything from and know I am going to at the very least like it.... Not many breweries out there I can say that about, I like this one fresh, it is also great aged. At its price you are almost required to pick up a 6 if not more!"
"Tried this one and while I like it I am not sure I can recommend. At 9.9% it is definitely a strong ale and I could not imagine drinking more than one of these at a sitting The brown sugar is quite pronounced from smell through taste. Along with the the hops and the strong malt backbone it is an interesting contrast. Ok, I will recommend!"
""

""
""
""
""

""
"O - I'm glad I tried this one as it was a really good beer. It was much better than I expected. Will probably have a couple more and cellar a couple."
"The beer dances that beautiful line between sweetness and bitterness. It really attacks hard on both sides. A really exceptional example of an American Barleywine."
""

"Served it in a (red) wine glass. Handsome appearance. A slow motion beer. Not one for the quaffer. One to linger over while things get into the off ramp of life."
""
"UPDATE 12/19/13: Can't believe I waited this long to have another from the sixpack, but unfortunately this one is similar to the first, except the vinegar/dirty feet smell and taste are subdued enough that it is not as close to being a drain pour. Still, far from the promised ""Sweet release."" Funny how one bottle can be ok and yet another from the very same sixpack can be so much worse."

"Overall: huge battle of bitter and sweet. bitter wins out for now. its good but i want to revisit this one when it is not so fresh"

"Poured into a Sierra Nevada IPA glass, because that's all I had available at the time. Good creamy head, with decent lacing. Smells like brown sugar and molassesy with a hint of hops. Taste is sweet, a little hoppy bitterness, can pick up the alcohol, but is not overpowering, especially for a high ABV. Mouthfeel is about right for a strong ale. Descent carbonation. Not too bad."
""
""
""
""
"O: big and hoppy. If you're into that, which I am, this is a great beer!"
""
""
"Pours honey gold with a decent sized head. I'm drinking this out of a Bulleit bourbon glass so we're talking about two inches of ale and an inch and a half of head. Looks pretty stellar. The nose is tangy, barely funky, with pine and candied fruit; while the flavor is sweet up front, with apricot and peach on the tongue, and then bitter in the throat. There's also a spice element to it, and I also get like Pez or Smarties candy in the nose mid-sip. For 9.99% abv, you sure wouldn't know it - I've had 7's and 8's that tasted boozier than this does. Bottle says that it's brewed with brown cane sugar, which, you know, from the name and all I was picturing a molasses-derived brown sugar, but the raw sugar makes more sense. I remember having this at a beer festival a few years ago and being duly corrected after asking for the ""brown."" "It's not a brown, it's an American strong ale."" Indeed. Thumbs up."

"Taste- Very crisp, malty flavors with notes of caramelized sugar, burnt caramel, toffee and thin molasses. Finish is smooth with herby hops. Overall, this is interesting. Its dark and malty flavors but its actually really easy drinking and thin. I don't get any alcohol at all which makes this one really dangerously easy drinking. Not a bad beer at all."

"O - Good beer for sure, the aroma is knock out good, but the taste is just too malt intense and the alcohol gets to you after a few sips of it warming up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"From my tasting notes: The brew poured a deep amber with ample head that billowed quickly and lasted throughout. The aroma is sweet hops, that is a good hop scent with sweet toffee and malt all rolled into one. The first taste was a wow moment. The full on signature Lagunitas hop profile with loads of the sweet malt and toasted sugary goodness to make for a perfect beer. It is definitely unique to say the least and dangerously easy to drink.. Not quite an IPA and not quite a barley wine, but a great brew nonetheless. I love all of Lagunitas’ beers and this may be my favorite."

""

""
"Poured into a pint glass."

"Warming even at refrigerator temperature. Medium bodied, light effervescence all up front. Long lingering malt, herbal and nut aftertaste. Somewhat cloying finish. Not a bad beer, in fact, pretty good since it isn't all ""west coast style"" overly choppy. Glad I have more than 1."

"It has an good copper color, but seemed to have some haziness about it. There is a large amount of hops, but has an aftertaste of brown sugar. It is a good mix, but not a beer you would want to drink a whole six pack of. This was my first Lagunitas, so I am sure that I will have more."
"Overall, as the statistics prove, this is an absolutely incredible beer, taking no prisoners, while at the same time, allowing for...ne...encouraging transcendence beyond space and time.

"O: A cool beer. It is labeled as a strong ale, but it kicks a bit like an IPA with it's fair share of hop bite and earthy flavor. I'm really digging the complexity of this one."

"O: Lagunitas, you do suck for not making this last year! It's amazing! Although, I'm glad Lagunitas Sucks was the result. I'm torn there, but not on whether or not I like this beer. True winner, yet again. 4.5"

"O- Quite different than anything i can remember. I am not a huge barley wine guy, but this was enjoyable. I wouldn't have 2 in a row or drink it often simply because the sweetness level of this beer was just too much for me to take. I don't have a ton of barleywine experience at this point, but this one seems to match the profile. Maybe even a cross between a barleywine and a DIPA. The flavor profile doesn't fit my palate all that well, but i respect the effort here by Lagunitas. Good job"

"Growler fill at GBX. Poured into snifter and it's a nice copper/amber pour with a huge 3+ finger pillow head. Smell is unique and a bit unexpected. Getting the hop bomb of citrus and pine mixed with some sweet malts. Not getting much shugga, but it smell quite good. Taste is just as interesting. Part barleywine, part IPA, part SA. Not sure, but it's sweeter that I thought it would be. The hops are actually a great finish and don't overpower it. A quite complex brew that was tough to sit down. Lots of carbonation, perhaps too much as this was quite dry and a bit metalic. Overall- A pretty good effort and a nice blend of sweet malts and american hops. Weird to explain and put into a category, but a must try and one I will hit out of the bottle to see what may be different. Enjoy-"
"Copper appearance. Full body. Aftertaste lingers. Sweet. Sure do smell the brown sugar. Frothy till the end. Smell also has a hint of smoked chipolte. Great beer overall. Had the Holiday Sucks last year, which wasn't as sweet, but still good. A must have."

"O – This is a nice beer and one that’s pretty tough to categorize. It smells like a strong ale but tastes almost like an imperial amber ale. I guess I can see it tasting like a strong ale, too, though. Not that any of this matters – I just like categorizing things. Useless rambling aside, this is a tasty and extremely drinkable beer given the ABV and my initial expectations after the aroma. I would have never guessed this clocked in at a tick below 10%. Part of me wishes that it tasted more like the aroma since that was so phenomenal, but the taste that is here is pretty damn good, too."
""
""
"Overall - An excellent crafted brew for the Strong Ale style. Highly recommend. Very satisfying beer after just 1 with its overall fullness, powerful and tasty flavors and alcohol level. Great bang for the buck as well."
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium to medium-low intensity, leading to a beer that is slightly foamy on the palate, but never quite fizzy. Ethanol is felt primarily in the nostrils after each sip, slightly burning the back of the throat as well. Closes out semi-dry, with modest residual stickiness along the palate."
""
""
"I found this to be a very good beer overall. There was a nice combination of the sweet and bitter throughout my tasting experience, producing nice layers of flavoring with every sip."

"Absolutely one of my favorite beers!! honestly can go good with anything, but you are better off enjoying this beer by itself. it has so much too offer, such great combination between the yeast and malt's making this an outstanding brew. you can put this on my list of top beers."

"Overall - An enjoyable American Strong by Lagunitas. The brown sugar flavour is innovative and provides a unique twist. Nice balance of hoppy bitterness, sweet brown sugar and malts."

"O – The malts in this one are nice, they bring balanced sweetness and are not sweaty and off-putting like some other beers. Absolutely unique brew here and the ABV ties the whole package together."

"Honestly this is one of the worst beers I have ever had. I bought a six pack two months ago, and I can't bring myself to drink anymore of it. I've tried to give this away to friends when they come over and so far 3 people have drank about half of it and dumped the rest. The brown sugar taste is way too over the top into the disgusting range."

"Pretty tasty. Almost reminds me of an aged DIPA, but where the hop character is still fairly heavy and robust after the aging. Then again, it could be a malty-ass barleywine with quadruple the amount of hops used. Sweet, but not sickeningly so. Nice balance when all's said and done. Though the booze is noticeable, it's still fairly easy to throw back for being nearly 10% ABV."

"Pours cloudy dark reddish amber with two finger white head. Head quickly dissipates to thin film leaving some nice lacing. Aroma big on malt, some caramel, piney hops, and brown sugar. Flavor is somewhat sweet balanced by a bitter finish. Medium body with a fair amount of carbonation and just a slight oily texture."
""
"Overall a great winter beer. I'm not sure I'd feel the same way about this beer in the middle of August, but in the middle of January sitting in front of a fire this is a nice change from stouts and dark Belgians. If you like a little hop in your winter beers you'll like this one. Lagunitas makes some very good beers and this is one of them."

"O: this exceptional ale should appeal to those would like barleywines, IPAs and brown ales and are willing to try a mix of all three. Good as this is, it is not quite up to the level of the replacement Lagunitas Sucks ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not the easiest beer that I have ever drank but it is still enjoyable - I wish the alcohol was a little more well hidden and that the sweetness was not so shocking upfront and then fading quickly. Interesting mix of style with elements of a barleywine and a DIPA."
"Overall, a really good American Strong Ale although I feel it doesn't quite stack up to Stone's bastard line. Quite affordable, though, and great for the winter months."
""
""
""

"O- this one was interesting and worth a try. The mix of piney hops and super sweetness seems a little off a bit for me though. An interesting concept."
""
""
"Got this beer as a Christmas gift--not to say I didn't appreciate the gesture, but everything about it was wrong to me, it was entirely too strong, like the brewers had attempted to cram too many flavors into it. To me, it tasted a bit like old, flat Dr Pepper with Everclear and a bit of club soda. Would not recommend."
""
""
""
"Overall, an excellent American Strong Ale and a definite must-try for those who love Stone's ``Bastard'' beers. This one is very much in the same tradition. It's a big bruiser of a beer with huge sweet notes, a good dose of citrusy hops, and a fair amount of complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The faded hops flavor here is hard to get past. I enjoyed the malty sweetness, but I got an overripe pineapple flavor that lingered long after swallowing the beer."
"O- Not a bad beer but after a while the alcohol overtakes the flavors and it becomes more of a grain beer. Very good though for the most part."
""
"A bit hoppy ale, it is pretty well done, maybe not the most sessionable drinkable beer but packs a ton of flavour."
""
""
"I really liked this beer -- I'm a fan of barleywines and this ale seems very much like that style. According to the Lagunitas website, this was a failed attempt at making their Old Gnarleywine. I'm not sure what failed, but this result is a treat...recommended"

"Pours a slightly hazy copper. Brown sugar and piney hops in the aroma. The brown sugar comes out even more after a sip. Very sweet, but the aggressive, pungent hops cut through to tame it. Big and very tasty, if not complex. Great balance between the hops and sugar, each keeping the other from overpowering. And checking in at 9.9% ABV, you'd never guess it's close to that strong while drinking it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very clear, dark, tannic oxidized rust color, very appealing. Smells not very hop forward, but malt, sweet, bread and grain and some caramel, but some noticeable alcohol and pine like hop notes. Tastes very sweet and malty and not at all bitter at first, the bitterness only emerging after a time (like their sumpin') and this tends to modulate the loudness of the bitterness overall. Nice late hop echo coming in later. Mouthfeel and carbonation is moderate fussy and just about right. Overall, another very good Lagunitas offering, although I don't like as much the loud malt notes in the beginning that really mute the effects of the hops...I want the hops right THEIR!"

"D - Coming into this I was hoping for something unique and interesting, a certainly seasonal. What I got was more or less another West coast hop-bomb. Certainly a tasty beer in the end, but with the description I was expecting less hop more malt, and I still think that's what I would have preferred here. Regardless, this is a tasty offering from one of the few American craft breweries that distribute to my neck of the woods, and for that I'm thankful."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/9/2012. Pours slightly hazy reddish orange color with a very nice 2 finger dense cream colored head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big pine, caramel, grapefruit, orange rind, apple, brown sugar, bread, toast, floral, grass, and herbal earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, caramel, pine, apple, brown sugar, toast, bread, citrus rind, floral, grass, and herbal earthiness. Fair amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, light fruits, brown sugar, bread, toast, floral, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Great balance and complexity of flavors; with a great hop bitterness/malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy, slick, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with hardly any warming noticed at all after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent ""experimental"" Barley wine! Great flavor balance and complexity; and dangerously easy to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering as expected."

"Brown Shugga' is a real winner. Aside from packing a punch at nearly 10% abv the flavor of this beer makes it a star. Smooth nutty malt base and a piney hop finish shine with a nose of hazelnuts and eucalyptus. Great beer with venison or any roasted gamy meats."
""
"O - A delicious strong ale, and very hoppy. The sweet malts do lend some balance but the hops are on full display here. Easy drinking with a slow building alcohol warmth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Wow! This brew is somethin’…it’s an overabundance of pine/citrus/earthy hops that dominate and then some…sweet malts do their best and are complimentary…I’d have to say the brown sugar stops this thing from going off the hops deep end and does round off/balance the super hops where the sweet malt leaves off…my lips are sticky with hops resin, this is anything but “watery”…there is some spice warmth that I wasn’t expecting…the only downside with this one is the alcohol heat which is undeniable and maybe a bit to strong…it’s super drinkable, maybe scarily drinkable seeing as it’s 9.9% ABV, but that’s the risk you take…I’m not sure if I could drink more than 2 of these in one sitting and still complete full, coherent thoughts, but one is very, very nice…(4/5)"
"Overall, this may not be spectacular, or even the best that Lagunitas has to offer...but, I can't imagine a better pour on any given Thursday."

"Medium mouthfeel in the texture and very little notice of alcohol for the abv. Very drinkable. An execellent beer and I will be seeking this out in bottles soon."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A well done beer, I am surprised how well the hoppy elements melded with the malty and sweeter aspects which was really pleasant. This can definitely satisfy on a cold day while not being a rich, overly malty seasonal beer. That being said, I am more excited about the return of Lagunitas Sucks."
""
""
"O: I've had quite a few Lagunitas beers and they all taste very similar to me, which isn't a bad thing at all. This one is tasty, and does a great act between the caramel, brown sugar sweetness, and juicy tropical fruity hops. Really nice stuff."
""
"O: For an American strong ale, this is fantastic in terms of both taste and smell. The weakest aspect of this beer can be found in the mouth feel, with its quite syrupy aspect. The first time I tried this beer its 9.99% ABV snuck up on me and I ended up waking with regrets."
""
""
"O: Adding this one to my list of annual ""Must Haves"". You should probably tackle just one in a session, this one definitely holds it own."
""
"O fair beer."
""
""
"O: Lagunitas has always been a true and constant friend of the hophead and this is a good example of their generosity. An assertively bitter American Barelywine with a huge hops bill in the nose, flavor and bittering. bit more sweetness than the average American Imperial IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied. It is a little on the sticky side, but makes your whole mouth feel dry after it has gone down."
""
""
""
"Clear, mahogany-amber pour, with a small beige head that retained well and left splotches of lacing on the glass. Muted caramel aroma, a touch of fruity hops. I really expected something different with this one, but instead got the same old typical, basic, dull Lagunitas flavor. Caramel malts, tree sap, pine and citrus hops, woody nutshells, stale alcohol notes, some off-flavors consistent with oxidation. About medium in body and carbonation. I'd probably never get this again. So many uninteresting beers from this brewery, and this one's no different."
""
""
"M: I can't believe this beer is 10% abv. Full bodied but easy to drink, massive hop aroma with signature lagunitas malt flavor. A delicious and awesome beer."

"This pours a rich brown color and has a slight head And good lacing. It has a sweet smell with a little spice. Wonderfully brilliant malt character that keeps giving after its gone. The body of this beer is perfect and it has a higher viscosity than I expected and i was not disappointed. This is a great beer and coming in at 10% makes it an amazing beer."

"Poured into a snifter at House of 1000 Beers, first time grabbing a bottle here to drink. Pours a beautiful amber red with an off-white/relatively tan pillowy head, good retention and lacing. Smell reminds me of Lagunitas Sucks from last year -- sweet and hoppy, with a resinous malt character that is reminiscent of other Lagunitas offerings, but more pronounced here. Flavor is similar but super sweet, which is good but some may find it over the top. Mouthfeel is amazingly smooth, with little hop bitterness, but very good. Over all this is a very good beer, and makes me realize just how much Lagunitas means to me. Cheers."

"Poured in my Lost Abbey tulip, bottled on the 299th day of the year. Pours a clear orange red, with a one inch off white head, that leaves plenty of lace. Smell is tangerine, pine, hard candy, carmel, and a hint of grapefruit. Taste is pungent hops, sweet candy, and a hit of grapefruit in the finish. Body is medium, nice amount of life, a touch dry, and the most dangerously drinkable beer I have ever had. This is different, easy drinking, and complex beer. Love this so much and did I mention at $10 a six and amazing deal. Lagunitas is a great and very affordable brewery, don't ever change."

"Good Shit!"

"Hoppy but with a soda feel that makes it seem a little bitter as well as sweet. Light on the color. Nice on the alcohol content so it seems like it should be loaded but it isn't.. Ok on the aftertaste. A decent beer for people that are not into hoppy beers. A nice diversion but not something you would want a six pack of."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very nice beer, captures the brown sugar sweetness while still maintaining that signature Lagunitas hoppy fresh finish. I really love this beer, a great seasonal and I could drink this anytime, though I like the Sucks a bit more."
"Medium-full body; medium carbonation; very smooth, rich and creamy feel. I guess I don’t get the excitement over this one that much; it felt like a chore to drink; way hot and heavy-handed. It’s obviously well-made and somewhat tasty, it just struck me as unnecessarily massive, even on a cold night. Very much a cross between a highly hopped barleywine and a big DIPA."
"Another mighty fine beer from Lagunitas that falls squarely into strong ale territory. There are hops a-plenty but with a very intetesting and complex sugary malt bill backing them. This stuff is really nice now but I suspect that I'd be rewarded if I can show the patience and restraint to save a few for 9-12 months. I'm looking forward to seeing how this changes over time."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear amber-golden color with a huge, fluffy, dark egg shell colored head. This monster of a head has a life of its own. It stubbornly hangs on either because it knows how sexy it is, or because it mocks me because it somehow knows how I want to dive into this thing. I've really been waiting a while to try it. Toasted malt, brown sugar, grassy and lemony hops, notes of bread, and just a hint of clove on the nose. The mouthfeel is interesting as it gets a little dry in the middle, but finished nice and wet. Very interesting flavor profile. Alternating citrus and pine with sweet unfermented sugar backbone that presents itself more in the beginning and at the finish. Nice fresh finish with some perfuminess that lingers. I like this one."
""
""
"O - The name and the season drew me in its getting colder and brown shugger sounded great. I love langunitas. This beer starts out with a bigger hop smell with light hints of citrus and sugar. Next the first sip is sweet and hoppy . One might think this is a ipa.After the a few sips the brown sugar notes hit you and one begins to be reminded of a barlywine . I love this beer sweet and barlywine like but perfect for the colder seasons ."

"O Pleasant overall. It is very well balanced. Full body with good carbonation. Great hop aroma and taste balanced with sweetness and alcohol."

"Medium bodied with average carbonation. Has a slightly bitter aftertaste, finishes dry, and the alcohol is well hidden for 9.99% abv. A nice beer from Lagunitas. I look forward to aging some of these."
"Milder than the nose but nothing too special. Lots of burnt caramel sugar. Big malty monster really. Pretty smooth and only a touch of alcohol heat. Subtle underlying bitterness that balances the malt. Smooth with pretty good flavors but really nothing special. I like it but its not my first choice."
""

""
""
""
""

"O - A strong offering from Lagunitas. Bittersweet probably describes it in a word. Will try again."
""
""
"Overall a pretty damn good beer, has more hops than most strong ales but still fits well in the category. Can't wait to try this again after it has been able to sit for a bit."
"O. A solid beer, but not one I would seek out again and again. Out of a fresh bottle, it is bitter, juicy, sweet, hoppy, and boozy. While these characteristics are fairly well integrated, the boldness of the flavors kinda knocks you back on your feet. I think age would do this one well, helping to refine some of the brashness that is apparent when it's fresh. Solid and certainly worth a try, but not a repeat visit for me."
""
""
"i haven't had this one since winter of '09/'10.... almost 2 years. this is one of those instances where i'm glad they took the beer away for a while.. because i't better than i even remember it. for a beer in general, it's a personal favorite.. nothing all that excellent about it, it's just delicious and i'm glad it's back."

"O: I like it. Not my favorite style, but this one works. I will be aging a couple of the six pack I got today to experiment - will report back a few months/years later ;)"
""
""
"Tried this one at Gainesville HOB. Wasnt sure what to call this one. When served, I was told it was a barleywine. But it ended up to highlight huge bitter hops, grapefruit, and then a bit of caramel. Medium slick on the palate. A lot more focus on the bitter with this one, and curious if it ages into a maltier brew. Good brew, but was hoping for more sweetness with a name like brown shugga."
""
""
"O: Overall, this is a very good beer, albeit not what I was expecting. In my book this is clearly a DIPA. In fact this has one of the strongest hop bitternesses Ive had in a long time. Not sure where the Shugga in the name came from as this is far from sweet! None the less, very enjoyable. Im curious as to how this one would age, I think Ill pick up a couple more to find out what happens when the huge hop characters die down."
""
""
"Overall - I prefer the 2010 version of this beer but 2012 does not disappoint. If you love bold, in your face beers, 2012 Brown Shugga is a must try. I bought 12 the other day and plan on aging at least 3 of them."
""
"O- A freak, a deformity brought on to us, when a recipe went wrong. The flacholent musk from this beast is offensive, the obscene flavor is out right blasphemy. This autrosity. I will hide it from the world, for they will never understand, and love it as my own, and drink this abomination, until i cannot stand."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very good beer, just not at all what I expected. The brown sugar compliments the sweet citrus very well, but it is in no way the main attraction of this brew."
"2010--still enjoyable after 2 years, but a bit past its prime. I generally prefer this beer with at least 6 months on it, but with no release last year, I couldn't do a 1 year comparison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm honestly curious if they added brown sugar pre and post fermentation. The sheer amount of brown sugar sweetness in this is impressive on a few levels. Honestly, this should be disgusting. Yet, somehow, it works as a sipper. I don't think I would want to drink more than 1 of these, but that's not the point. I like brown sugar, so I guess that's why I like this beer."
""
"So, as another poster stated, I'm not a ""fancy"" reviewer; I just drink the beer and tell you what I think of it. I waited a LONG time to try this beer, and I have to say, I was disappointed. It's not a bad beer, but it didn't taste the way I expected it to. The name doesn't describe the taste IMO, but I can't really get mad about that since it wasn't made to taste like brown sugar (this was a woopsy-daisy barleywine to which they added a poop-ton of brown sugar in an effort to salvage the product...they liked it and decided to bottle it as a beer), and the lingering aftertaste is remarkably brown sugary if you wait a minute or two, and you're looking for it. The immediate impression I got upon first swig was a bit of a watered-down Sierra Nevada, taste-wise. It's got more of a bitter taste than I expected. And it WILL mess you up, consider yourself warned. I drank three and I was so toasted that I got sick, and that doesn't normally happen with me. It's not bad, but it's not something I really think that I'll buy again. I'm more of a Lil Sumpin' kinda girl. If you're looking to get schmammered, I think any Lagunitas beer will do the trick for ya lol, but this one will have you on your ayse for sure."

"Lagunitas Brown Shugga' - The bottle says: ""NA"""
""
"Great winter beer!"
""
"Cheers!"
"Not very complex, however -- it's mostly just varying levels and characteristics of sweetness. Mouthfeel is marked by slick malts, alcholic heat, and prickly carbonation, with the alcoholic detracting signficiantly. Overall, this beer is nothing exceptional but it does exude the quality this brewer is known for. It's curious to see what this much brown sugar does to a beer. It needs more balance and a bit more complexity to be truly compelling."
"O: This is a very tasty beer. I'm glad I tried it. The nose is a little sweeter than I prefer, but other than that it's great."
""
"Finishing my day off with some Rolling Stones tribute beer. It is one, right...? In any case, this stuff pours a clear russet topped by a finger of off-cream foam. The nose comprises brown sugar (no way!), light maple syrup, pine needles, and the essence of grapefruit peel in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, with some brown-sugary maple taking control up front, and some bright grapefruit and mild pine needles getting the back half. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a nice beer, one that marries two distinctive flavor combinations and doesn't try to force them to live dysfunctionally together."

"As I said in my profile, I'm a simple beer lover. Don't care about the lace, head, color... I will say it looks beautiful in a frosty mug. Nice amber with not too much of a head. The taste is amazing. Hoppy, spicy, and sweet all at the same time. Goes down smooth and leaves your taste buds begging for more. You can taste the alcohol but, even at 9.9%, it's nowhere near as prominent as a lot of beers near this potency. Great tasting beer that packs one hell of a punch. I drank 3 last night and felt like I downed 7 or 8 MGD's. I would HIGHLY recommend this incredible, delicious beer."
""
"Overall this is a fun beer: it is slightly but not overbearingly sweet with a smooth and easy mouthfeel. There is enough alcohol in the taste, though, to (hopefully!) remind you not to drink more than a few at 9.9%abv!! Enjoy."
"I didn't miss this one last year, but that's partly because Sucks put it out of my mind. I'm enjoying this one more than I had in past years. Brown Shugga is a good brew and, hopefully, here to stay."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I'm so conflicted with this beer. It tastes good but it's so extremely sweet and intensely hoppy that I can only have one and then I want something else. Not bad for what it is...but what is it?"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I was really expecting to be sugar-slammed here, or maybe a suggestion of a barleywine-like beer, but all that was mostly on the nose; the beer itself reminded me a little of the Innis & Gunn Rum Cask Oak Aged beer I'd sampled once. I would say this is a good but not exceptional beer for my tastes."
""
""
"Pours a clear reddish orange with one finger thick tan head, settling slowly to a quarter inch and leaving a spray of lace down the glass. Smell: grapefruit, pineapple, tropical fruit, dates, caramelized sugar. Taste: brown sugar, lightly toasted bread, pine cutting through the sweetness, then into sugared grapefruit, dried mango-ish tropical fruit. Body ramps from medium to full, with prickly carbonation into fluffy into a chewy, hops and booze soaked finish. Although pretty big and sweet, it doesn't come off as heavy, at all. It would be interesting to try all of Lagunitas' seasonal 9-ish% ASA/Impy Reds together (how different are they?). In any case, this is a win. Bottled 270/365 2012."
""
""
"O-a different beer that has some attributes of a DIPA, but with its own unique flavor profile"
""
""
""
"Overall, the best thing about this brew was the warming, seasonal feel, with hearty flavoring the whole way through. There was such a nice blend of warming spice, with sweetness of malts and a biting lick of soapy, citric, and piney hop bitterness. This made for a uniform sip throughout. The nose was also certainly stark, and with such fusel booze it can be seen to overwhelm the light of heart with fiery booze. The tea-like lemon flavoring, at times, does tip the flavor’s balance, but this is a very tasty, season-appropriate beverage."
""
""
"O: An interesting brew with loads of brown sugary sweetness and also warming alcohol which is well hidden in the aromatic and fresh hoppiness of this brew. Big yet balanced. The penicillin of the Lagunitas line: greatness birthed by happenstance, which speaks for their ingenuity and adaptability."

""
""
""

"I don't get any of that ""brown shugga"". But perhaps the brown sugar is adding some of the sweetness and alcohol touch."

"Overall a pretty nice beer. It drinks a lot like an imperial IPA given a big hop bitterness and some overall floral notes. It's not a bad beer but it's overall pretty weak not bringing any big bold flavors."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer but a little too unbalanced to be considered a great or go to beer for the style. Try it out, but there are much better offerings from Lagunitas."

""
""
"O: A good winter beer. I enjoyed this very much. Recommended."
""
""
""
"Just had this on tap tonight in Marcella's Restaurant in Columbus Ohio. Very fresh, fruity smell and taste. Deep dark golden brown, clear. Lovely color. Very hoppy. It was perfect with the Italian appetizers we had while waiting for the main course. One of the nicest beers I've had in a while. Impressive. The restaurant is awesome too. Highly recommended."
""
""
"Low B-"
""
""
"O: very pleased with this offering. Looking forward to having more."
"This brew does a lot of flavors, and it does them well. It's kind of like the Italian sandwich of beers- it has everything in it, and somehow they all seem to work together."

"Overall: A very good Strong Ale. Strong flavors but balanced between the hops and malts. The sugar adds a nice kick and doesn't go overboard with the sweetness."

"Cost: $9.99 for a six pack."

"O- First time trying this beer and a very tasty strong ale. Almost a hoppy imperial red ale that has some dark fruit notes along more sweetness. Glad I picked up a 6 pack."

""
"Overall, this beer is great. Halfway through drinking a nice wine texture comes out in it, that some might find unpleasant, but I find it very enjoyable. For a malt and hop lover it may disappoint, but for the whole package, it's pretty solid. In all honesty I wasn't expecting this beer to be as mellow as it is compared to other Lagunitas offerings, but for a strong beer it stands out. I could easily be overserved with this one."
""
""
"Overall struck me more as a sweet and malty barley wine rather than a strong ale. Glad to have tried it, but did not order a second."
""
""

"O: pretty tasty and interesting, quite sweet/rich but its not cloying. Not mind blowing but quite enjoyable, 6 months aging might smooth it out. I'd definitely reccomend trying it once, great value."

"a very long time coming... finally! it has a hell of a reputation. it pours a clear dark copper to red color, like an amber, with a two inch off white head that relaxes a little bit in time. the nose is all time, tons of brown sugar and molasses, spice and sweet, but also way more hops than i expected. bitter, a nice contrast to the sweet, nothing offensive here at all. flavor is so complex, nothing like this out there at all. sweet, thick, and boozed out max up front, but it settles into a hoppy, equally boozed, big ipa style. yeast is the same as seemingly all lagunitas beers, which really is my only knock on them, but it works here better than anywhere. feel is full bodied, but not as huge as i thought. its also plenty carbonated, which makes it seem drinkable at a scary rate. excellent beer, worth the hype. it will only get better as the weather gets darker and colder to suit this beer. yum, yum, yum."
""
""
"O: this is a great brew, delicious hops and a nice touch of sweetness, perfect for a hop fix on a colder night, which it is right now, and this really hit the spot."
"Edited after warming to room temp."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Hoppy up front with a sweet brown sugar finish."
"Well, Brown Shugga' does sweeten up with warmth. Regardless, I like this more than when I had it many years ago."
"O: Barleywine gone wrong? Not at all. Pretty basic, with a bunch of malts and hops along with a good dose of brown sugar. Glad to see this one back"
"Overall: I enjoyed this beer a good bit but I wouldn't go seek it out. If I was somewhere and it was on the menu I would order it though."

"Beautiful red amber color with a healthy thick white head that laced and stuck to the glass. A nice citrus hop that i mplies a little sweetness. The taste was malty, without being as hoppy as some of the other Lagunitas seasonals. Since this comes out every other year, I almost forgot how good this beer is. It is smoother than wild, and has more fruit flavors -orange - than any other Lagunitas in my opinion. The alcohol is well hidden, and this is one of the best offerings from this brewery."
""
"O- my first ever lagunitas brew ever.... this may turn me on to them but this brew also reminds me of 2 brothers cane & Abel with a slight lightness.... as far as thickness.... love this brew"
"Can't believe this is the first time I've had this one. Poured from bottle into brooklyn tulip. Pours a transparent dark amber color. Nice fluffy white head, recedes slowly leaving sticky white lacing all over the glass. Not sure what I was expecting here, but this isn't it. It looks and smells like a DIPA. Smell- citrus hops, tea leaves, orange peel (from the hoppy aroma). Taste- hop blast down my throat. Drying citrusy hop oil scorches my throat. Its followed by a tropical fruit backbone. Absolutely zero trace of brown sugar here at all. Is this a DIPA? I'm confused. Was expecting something along the lines of a barleywine, but this is a DIPA, I don't care what they call it. That said, its delicious, wonderful hop profile and great malt backbone."
""
""
"O: As far as I'm concerned, Lagunitas can do little wrong in my book. And this is another example of how good Lagunitas is."
""
"O - A delightfully decadent treat from Lagunitas. I was imagining that there would be more brown sugar detectable throughout the beer, but it was lacking. The beer is wonderful, and superbly drinkable, so even without a big brown sugar presence this is still one to seek out and grab."
""
"O - Good, but I can only drink about half of one of these and I am done. Too sweet and strong"
""
"O - a very nice ale. I'm glad I tried it. Now I will buy more."
"Nice off colored head to this but the light brown body offers little to be too enthused about. A very nice aroma offering some aromatic citrusy hops alongside a big cookie dough and brown sugar base. I like it. Flavor starts off with some grapefruit from the hops and then transitions into the sweeter side from the malt, offering some dough and brown suger. Some bitterness in the finish. Some alcohol is noticeable in the finish, it doesn't add to the beer but it also is not a deterrent in any way. A thinner but creamy and active mouthfeel, though the activity dies out prior to the finish. I kinda think a thicker mouthfeel would benefited this beer. Overall, been wanting to try this for a while now so glad the opportunity finally arrived. Worth the wait I do think, good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.0): This is a nicely crafted beer, and the fact that Lagunitas will happily put out something of this size and character for $10-12/ sixer is fantastic. This beer’s category is so broad that you grade them as much on overall satisfaction as anything else, and as far as that goes this is a very nice beer and an excellent value. Say what you will, but that counts. And beyond that, it’s just tasty and satisfying for a broad range of (admittedly American-biased) palates. Yummo."
"O) Thanks Lagunitas, what an excellent beer. Reminded me a bit of a few barleywines I've had recently. This was a pleasure to drink, and really hard to believe the ABV is nearly 10%. Glad to recommend this beer..."
"O - Cool beer by Lagunitas that uses some unique hops to blend in with the sticky sweetness."
"O - A well done beer that just isn't my favorite style. I'll drink the remaining from my six (I might even experiment with mixing, who knows), but I can handle just one at a time. not because of the ABV but because of the hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very interesting. many elements about this beer are unusually however they still complement the style so I would say this beer is pretty darn good. Totally met if not exceeded my expectations."
""
""
""
""
"O- Really great to have this again this year. It'd be cool if it was an all year round brew. I could see drinking this even during the warmer months sitting by a fire at night. Great balance without alot of alcohol for a 10% brew. Great job once again Lagunita's!!!"
""
""
"O: So good and so balanced. I can't believe how good this sweet beer tastes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O; This is a delicious beer and I really cant wait to see how this beer ages. I think that itll get better with age."
""
"A full flavored beer. One in any given night is plenty for me. Good stuff."
""
"O: The 9.9% ABV is pretty well hidden, but comes through as the beer is allowed to warm up. Overall this is a significant contender in the strong ale category. Definitely one to wait for year after year."
"Lagunitas' Brown Shugga pours a clear golden amber color with a nice big fluffy head. The smell is hoppy with a touch of sweetness, classic lagunitas smell IMHO. A nice medium body leads into a balanced taste of sweetness and bitterness. You get the brown sugar taste, but it's not over whelming. Overall this is a great beer and I can see why people were upset last year, but it birthed sucks so that's pretty awesome. And let's just call it 10%, because you can't taste the 9.99% that it's listed at anyway, so that .01% won't make a difference IMHO. Great beer that's devilishy sessionable, and with Lagunitas great pricing you can't lose with Brown Shugga!"
"D - Very drinkable. Great overall balance with a nice malty profile with brown sugar and hops providing balance."
"O- A solid beer worth picking up. Very tasty and to alcohol is well hidden. I will be pick some more up as soon as I can."
""
""
""
""
""
""
" I wanted to mention that, while this is not my favorite effort by Lagunitas, I do appreciate it more than their other beers. I tend to associate Lagunitas Hop-heavy recipes more appropriate for the warmer Texas weather. But Brown Sugga' still manages to settle perfectly into the Holiday Season. Cheers."
"Surprising hop-forward aroma. Perhaps its just too cold, but I'm not getting any of the sugar sweetness in the nose or in the mouth. I'm even wondering if the bartender has given me the wrong beer."
""
""
"O - A really impressive closing beer which packs a lot of sweet flavors, and is not the most drinkable in my book. Gets cloying after half way through. Good luck with this one because it packs a sweet punch, Cheers! After further drinking I found that pairing this with something salty like nuts really helps cut the sweetness and makes this a better brew. Try it, you will not be disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Brown Shugga' is an over the top beer with lots of hop bitterness as well as malty sweetness and about 10% alcohol. It manages to be balanced with all its extremities and the result is delicious."
"O: Pleasantly surprised, though I shouldn't really be since Lagunitas makes some solid beer. Would drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer is a different animal. The sweetness is complex and pairs nicely with a mellow hop earthiness. This is a very solid beer that I will get again as the cold weather approaches."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is how big fall beers should be done! I'm not a huge Lagunitas fan, but I look forward to this release every year."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a crystal clear medium copper color with a huge yellow white head that slowly dissipates to a cap and lots of leggy lace. Earthy and piney hop aromas mixed with a fair amount of caramel light fruit and candy and darker sugar. There's a solid shot of ethanol in the aroma that reminds you this is a big beer, but it never seems harsh. The flavor is big and sweet up front with lots of candied and darker sugars. Solid earth and resinous hop flavors with barely any harsh edges. A bit of warming alcohol lingers long after each sip. Medium body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. This is a really nice big beer, I really enjoyed it."
"O: I love Lagunitas and their approach to brewing. They make affordable, tasty beers with a great abv to price ratio. Brown Shugga falls behind Sucks and Stoopid for me but a very good offering that I certainly look forward to. I have a six pack hanging out in my pantry that I'm going to sit on for a while...curious to see if age will mellow this one out."
"O- Very interesting beer. Almost a malty IIPA/ barleywine loaded with sweetness. Certainly worth a try."
""
""
""
"O- Nice beer to try, glad to have had it. Sucks is way better IMO"
""
""
"I'm not a huge fan of this one fresh, time definitely helps mellow it out an improves it!"
""
"Note: this review is the beer straight from the fridge poured into a pint glass. As the beer warms...in both the nose and the taste it's boozier, hoppier, maltier and more flavorful! In my opinion, this needs to be drunk fresh. Sure, it'll age well by mellowing out, but enjoy it for what it is now because the hops are so fresh and the alcohol is so hidden."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a really unique brew. An American strong IPA? A dry hopped barleywine? Interesting, enjoyable mix here."
""
""
""
""
"O- A really enjoyable beer, the brown sugar is really bold and delicious, it's also mad drinkable even at nearly 10%."
""
""
"O: pretty tasty beer. good flavors and some nice complexity. I like sucks a little more but this beer is pretty tasty. The hoppiness surprised me but it keeps the sweetness in check."
""
""
""
""
"O: Solid, the 9.99% will really sneak up on you though! A must try !"
""
"Overall this is a fantastic beer."
""
""
""

""

""
""
""
""

"The sugar was great, even though I'm not into super sweet beers. This one was ""drinkable"" even though I hate that term (piss is technically ""drinkable...""), smooth, and delicious, which is exactly what I expect from a Lagunitas brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad..."
""
"Overall, I really like this beer. I've been waiting a long time and I think its better than Holiday Sucks, which replaced it last year, although I did enjoy HS."
"O- love this stuff! I think the wait made it better too! This a great Strong Ale, worth the money, very drinkable..."
"O: Great beer in the Double Bastard vain (though lets be honest, its not DB). Alcohol is well hidden, malt forward with some hoppiness."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I loved this simply put. Great flavor and balance. Still can't believe it has almost 10% abv. Going to buy as much of this as I can before it's gone."
""
"O - A nice strong ale that's very well rounded. Alcohol very well hidden, making this one very easy to drink. Cheers"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I look forward to this every year. I think it would cellar well but I'm not that disciplined. The big malty sweetness the aggressive hops is an unusual combination that really works here."
"O - Lots of things going on here. I would be interested to see how this one aged... It has all the ingredients to become outstanding given the test of time."
"O - yet another great offering from Lagunitas. I hadn't had this one before, then with all the hype of it not being produced last year got me excited to try it this year. Definitely did not disappoint, happily recommended."
""
"This was my first taste of Brown Shugga and was happy that it was the special release I busted my cherry on. This is a great beer and perfect on a cold night. I plan to pick up a few more cases of this."
"O - WOW, It is so good! I really enjoyed this beer!"
""
"This is complex and delicious. The malt is sweet but approachable. The hops are forward but balanced and citrusy. The booze is there and slows down the drinkability. Overall, this is really a great beer. I'm glad they brought it back."
""
"O/D-Another high ABV gem from Lagunitas hard time choosing if I like this or Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale more. Really surprised by the brawn of the hops here. I was expecting a big one-sided malt bomb. Instead, its a big malt bomb wearing a hoppy fur coat of awesomeness. Must sip slowly…so strong yet so tasty."
""
"Pours a nice copper ale with the same old dome centric white etched surface. Smells like alcohol, hops, sugar and brown sugar and a bit of cotton candy. Flavor is sweet and boozy with some hints of caramel and sugar. Medium bodied with reserved carb and a wet finish. I like this beer."
""
"Overall - It's a unique beer, anyway you slice it. I'd call it an Imperial Brown, except there's a tad too much hop presence to be a true brown. Beware: This thing has the qualities of a puppy, but it kicks like a mule! At 9.9%, it drinks closer to a 6.5%, and it'll sneak up on you like a ninja in the night if you're not careful. Not the most complex flavor or presentation, but when taking into account the strength and it's subdued quality, it's quite an impressive beer."

"D/O: Perhaps the finest of Lagunitas' high-gravity beers, this appears to be an American take on an old ale or wee heavy. Fruit and umami make for a distinctive combination, reigning over muted hops in this well-aged example. Like most of the beers coming out of Petaluma, this beer's intensity has a tendency to fatigue the palate, but less so due to the focus exhibited by its ingredients."
"Review from 2/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours an attractive medium red brown. Light head leaves a ring of foam and slight lacing. Hoppy, citrus and sweet malt aroma. Crisp intense hops up front. Medium barley wine like body and taste with caramel malt and faint citrus. Light brown sugar background. Like a cross between dark IPA and barley wine. Another hit from Lagunitas. Nice."

"Poured out a clear amber/ dark copper color. Has a thin tan colored head. Left a decent lacing down the sides of the chalice it was served in.

"Over the years I have loved and fallen out of love with this beer. The first season my friends and I discovered it, about 4-5 years ago, we couldn't get enough. We were so into it we had distributors hunting it down and then bought all they could find. Then another season came and something had changed. It wasn't what it had been... One of my good friends, Dr. Burton, was not as fickle as I. He tasted it, said some nice things about it and then shelved it. A few months after my initial taste for that season he presented it to me. It was all I had hoped it to be; malted brown sugar with the right amount of hoppiness supported by a healthy does of alcohol. It put a smile on my face. I am a fan of this beer. If your first bottle isn't making you smile, let it sit. It learns to please as it matures."
"O- Very good, something different from the everyday. Definitely couldn't drink more than one per sitting but with something like this you would want to treat yourself on occasion with this."
"Deep amber in color with a white head that dissipated quickly. No lacing on the glass. Aroma is brown sugar and and citrus hops. Flavor is brown sugar, caramel malts, and some spices that I can't place. There are some citrus hops in the flavor, but they lurk in the background. Medium to heavy bodied with medium carbonation. It has a very sweet finish that isn't cloying and long lingering. This is a good thing, in my opinion, as I've recently had a few beers that left an unpleasant long lasting sweetness. I was very surprised to see that this is 9.9% ABV. The alcohol is very well hidden, so proceed with caution!"
"One of my favorites."
"Overall, this is good beer, though I did find the sugars became rather strong after a few sips, and due to the high alcohol content (9.99% ABV), a tinge of vodka-like alcohol hung around the edges. Still, I suspect anyone who already likes Lagunitas--a company deliciously geared towards over-indulgence--will find this a nice addition to their line."
"For a beer with such a high ABV the drinkability of the beer is outrageous! I can easily see myself getting into a little bit of trouble with this brew. I am not a fan of really high ABV beers, but this one would do the trick for me. Lastly, if you are not a big fan of really hoppy beers, this may be one to try due to the intense sweetness. Prost!"
"EXCELLENT, MUST TRY!"
"Nice body on this one. Dark mahogany that is consistent with barleywines. The head and lacing however is a bit thin. Smell is sweet caramel, boozy, sugary malts with a strong odor of bittering hops. And yes I would say it does have a brown sugar smell. Even being served a bit too cold it smell is powerful. Taste is all over the place. Somewhat tropical notes lead the way with the sugary sweetness of the caramel and candy sugar blasting it's way in. I have had 2 lagunitas beers before this and the aftertaste was plauged with a watered down sameness. I detect nothing like that here. It is quite flavorful thru and thru. Mouthfeel is extremely oily and thick with a bit of heat on the throat. I am really glad to have picked this up. Much preferred to Olde Gnarleywine."
"On the sip you get hops up front, but those quickly give way to the sweet malty tones brought on by the brown shugga that’s been added to the brew. Once the sweet notes have passed, hop oil lingers but doesn’t overpower."
"Syrupy body and mild carbonation works wonderfully."
"O - Awesome brew! Age it next time you come across it! 1 yr would be ideal Annoying Lagunitas hops disappear at this point... Nice relaxing brew! Perfect for a hot summer day."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a cloudy auburn-brown coloring that is almost opaque, with a slight haze to it. No head on the pour at all. The beer has a bold, round aroma, which is a smooth blend of supersweet sugar and caramel, with a decent balance of hoppiness. Flavors are sharp and heavy, with a good foundation of wet, deep hops riding strong under a boozey highlight and malty sweetness reminiscent of molasses and caramel. There is a sweet theme to this brew. The aftertaste is a slick, rich, almost syrupy sweetness, but refrains from being cloying, with a good hops presence once again. Impressive. The finish is slightly bitter, which keeps it light, and the crispness from the carbonation makes it quick."
"O- I would never guess this was 10% unless I sat and really thought about the beer in between sips like I am now. Great beer that I think I like more every time I try it."
"Lagunitas impresses me yet again. These people love hops and so do I."
"Overall, an excellent brew."
"This beer is delicious, its the perfect beer to have when you want a good beer...and nothing else, a burger with this beer and your ready to not move. Not a salad beer either, do your self a favor get a friend go to a bar with this on tap order your friend two bud lights pay for them you have a few of these and let him drive home. DO not let him taste it or you'll loose your driver."
"O - i love this brew, came across it in my fridge and thought why not even though its got some time on it and i love it fresh, it has meshed nicely. definitely one of the sweetest beers out there, where i usually scoff at those characteristics this one is able to do it elegantly."
"O – Nice malty complexity, but the profile on whole is overly sweet, which overwhelms the relatively light body."
"This is one of the best beers I've ever drunk. It's everything I could hope for from a beer and more."
"A lovely brew from Lagunitas, and a truly American-styled one—the hops, the body, the sweetness all blending together into a raucous, opinionated and brash whole. Hell yeah."
"This one pours out as an amberish colored brew with a white head on it. The head settles but leaves a nice lacing. The smell of the beer is semi sweet, not as sweet as I expected it to be from the name. There was a little bit of a roasted smell in there and some hops as well. The taste wasn't overly sweet, I guess I took the name of the beer too literally... The flavors were decent in my opinion. After finishing it off I found myself saying that it wasn't the best beer out there but I suppose it'd be worth another try."
"Bring on the cool weather with this; somewhere between a heavy IPA, winter warmer and a barleywine, complex indeed. A very good tasting brew that will warm you up for sure.... any time of year. Very good stuff here."
"Overall I though this was a pretty good brew. It is kind of similar to WTF, if you replaced the hops with candied and brown sugar. It isn't the most complex beer but the flavors are pretty nice and everything comes together nicely. Normally I am not a fan of super sweet beers but thankfully the sweetness stayed in the aroma and wasn't that overbearing in the flavor. This beer isn't that drinkable, but if I didn't have shit to do in the morning and had another bottle, I would drink it. I could see this being a good bigger beer for the summer, it could be refreshing and might make a good campfire beer, I may have to verify it this summer. If you like stronger beers with some sweetness to it, this should be up your alley, and if your a fan of Lagunitas then this won't disappoint. This was another solid beer from Lagunitas, everything I have had from them has been good, so far my favorite Cali brewery. 2013 edit, tried the years release and it seemed very off to me, it was full of onion and garlic like hop aromas and flavors, i don't what's up with it."
"Pours a dark amber color, with little off white head. Sticky lacing surrounds the pint glass. A fierce race of carbonation bubbles race to the top. Strong smell of piney hops, caramel, and burnt sugar. The smell was very interesting for a Strong Ale, the smell of this one could pass for a DIPA. This one is pretty bitter. The hops are pretty forward, I also taste hints of caramel and molasses. The taste is sweet up front, but has a very bitter backbone. The alcohol is well masked for being 9.99% ABV. Mouthful was pretty heavy and carbonation was moderate. Overall the beer was different in a...different way. Nothing stood on why I loved it or hated it. Pretty average beer, glad I had a chance to try, but wouldn't care if I ever had this one again."
"The smell was odd, I had half expected a strong IPA and not a Strong ale, but that was no bother. Lots of hoppy tones, pine and citrus but the biggest players were by far caramel and a burnt sugary almost molasses like aroma.;l, also deppicted some earthy tree bark type aroma. The taste followed suit, earthy caramel tones with a definate hop presence and a sweetness that lay on the palate for a good long while. The feel was a little thin and slick, for the amount of flavor present I would have like to have a bit more thickness to it, but it was nice none the less. Alcohol was definatly not hiding and was a big presence here."
"Overall-I had one of these Saturday night, and hated it. I drank alot that night and didn't know if it was an accurate assumption. I was fortunate to get a single and it was an enormous dissapointment. I'm not going to let this beer change my view on Lagunitas, still a top 5 brewery, maybe Brown Shugga just needs some age."
"Lots of head, this one. Lace is much and lots of cling, right down to the last sip. Head is about three fingers, color is a dark brown, a 21 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is rich and sweet, with aromas of brown sugar, vanilla, caramel, peach, and roasted malt. Taste is bold and sweet, with flavors of caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, toffee, grapefruit, and sweet roasted malt. Mouthfeel is full and chewy, smooth like heavy cream with just enough zing to make it interesting. Don't let the flavor fool you, the almost 10 percent alcohol by volume creeps up on you and away you go. This brown shugga' is calling for me to get some more. A good desert beer for sure."
"It isn't all that complex or interesting, in my opinion. Basically a sugary beer with a fairly high hop character. It's different, I'll certainly give it that. At the end of the day though, I'm not sure I'd seek it out."
"All in all, a pretty good beer!"
"O--It's a good offering from a brewery I haven't dealt with a lot. It makes me want to try other beers form them. This strong ale, to me, tastes like a more mellow barleywine. I would love to try this aged to see if the overly sweet taste goes away with time."
"pours a dark amber with a 1 finger off white head. fairly good amount of lacing. smells of sugar, caramel malts, floral hops and alcohol. at first you get a big taste of sugar, almost too much, but as it flows across your tongue the hops let you know they are there and finally with a 9.99%abv you get the alcohol. not the brown i was looking for, but with everything going on i really like it."
"One of the great 6 pack values out there, less than 11 bucks. Poured a copper color with a nice tan head. Aromas of piney hops, alcohol, raisins and brown sugar. Medium bodied, with flavors of booze, pine, citrus, sugar and caramel. A fortuitous and delicious mistake by the brewers."
"Overall: A very unique brew, and one that I thoroughly enjoy. Pity that I'm reviewing the last one I'll get till next fall. Definitely not for everyone, this is a thick, rich, boozy beer that is best enjoyed sipping over an hour or more. If you like big beers, give this one a try."
"Half inch creamy tan head which dissipates slowly. Clear, deep amber body with decent lacing. Very pleasant, sweet, spicy aroma. Taste is unlike any other beer I've tried, not sure if I like it or not. Syrupy, lively mouthfeel. Definitely different, worth trying again, but I wouldn't run out and buy a case of it."
"Into a tulip glass on 3.30.11 this settles a beautiful, very clear cherry wood hued red color under a thin but nicely sustained head. The aroma is much milder than I'd have expected but otherwise an appealing one with notes of toasted sugar, light cherry, and moderate citrus hop. Mouthfeel and taste comes off very similar to a barleywine with a big complex taste. Bright, sweet, but earthy dark fruit, perhaps cherry, dominates the palate with somewhat of a spirit-like warming akin to, again, a barleywine. Finish is dry and sweet. Huge flavor delivered smoothly...Very nice."
"A strong sensory rewarding beer, a complex character."
"Overall - for a beer that's almost 10% ABV and a 51.1 IBU this is still modest and comfortable. very enjoyable in moderation."
"In spite of the high abv, a rather drinkable brew - Lagunitas has not disappointed me yet - and this is no exception."
"Pours a ruby mahongany with little to no head. Nose is surprisingly citrus and grapefruit hops, very sweet smell dominated by the hops. Taste is balanced moreso with a strong malt profile. Still sweet with caramel and brown sugar notes, added by resiny hops. Some light and dark fruit characteristics appear in the middle. Mouthfeel is light to medium. The high abv is apparant once this breathes a little. Sipper. One bottle in a session is plenty. Decent idea for a beer."
"Just a tad too sweet and strong for me to have more than 1 per sitting though. Will be buying more for sure. Another solid effort from Lagunitas."
"Good beer. I'd like to see what this tastes like with a year or two in the cellar. Thanks Jon."
"Prost!!!"
"A very high quality, fine beer."
"-Very drinkable and didn't really notice the high ABV content."
"D: An excellent assertive beer. Very drinkable with a food pairing due to the alcohol content. Chicago style pizza and most Mexican food comes to mind."
"D- Very tasty strong ale if you're only having one. Otherwise it's on the sweet side and, oddly for a strong ale...strong alcohol. Great on a cold winter night."
"The body is thick and viscous with very modest carbonation, but a ton of juicy grapefruit a substantial bitter streak make a valiant effort to cut through it. Loads of caramel and toffee turn creamy in the warming finish. This is certainly a different animal fresh, but it's quite enjoyable."
"I honestly don't know how to classify this beer, as American strong ale is starting to just mean beer to me. So my classification would be a junior version of a pretty fresh American barley wine - and not all that junior. Pours amber with a finger and a half of fast dissipating tan head. Smells of bready sugar sweet hops, however you might interpret that. The taste is pretty good - again, think American barleywine, that is fresh and hoppy, but not. In that sense that some American barley wines are so over hopped that they taste excessive when drank fresh. There is also a nice sweetness behind it. Not perfect, but this beer was <$2, so I'm impressed. The mouthfeel is pretty sweet, but not overly thick. It sits on the tongue with that sweet bitterness, but it doesn't coat it. Pretty drinkable for a 10% American barleywine junior."
"My Brown Shugga poured without much head and has an orange amber colour. The smell is hoppy and slightly sweet: nice. The taste is quite hoppy but develops some sweet maltiness through the middle and the aftertaste wasn't really bitter for me. The texture is slightly thick and carbonated. This is a very nice beer."
"Pretty delicious."
"Tasty, different and pretty drinkable, i couldnt finish a six pack in a night or anything but i could definitely have a few."
"Considering how strong and sweet this beer is, I find it to be very drinkable. Neither the alcohol or the sugars are limiting factors (the alcohol would be if I were driving). I could easily see myself buying this beer by the 6 pack if it were available to me locally. I'll have to buy some next time I'm in Lagunitas' distribution area. This is an interesting and recommended beer."
"The beer pours a clear, bubbly amber with a nice white head. Laces the glass well. The nose is sweet and sugary, like syrup with a nice malty body underneath. Really inviting. There's a great warmth about this beer. The sweet cane sugar flavors and warmed up by the good alcohol presence. Finishes a little bitter which gives it great balance. A really nice body and finish on the beer. This one is top notch."
"D- While there are so many wonderfull atributes to this beer, it still has a somewhat overly ""boozy"" taste to it. Enjoyed much better with a salty snack to balance out the both the alcohol and sweet tastes"
"Drinkabilty - Very easy to drink, and if it wasnt so high in alcohol id be ranked higher. A fun take on a strong ale. Very good for a treat, maybe a little to sweet for some but worth a drink for sure."
"Overall: Excellent beer. Easy drinking and delicious. Almost too easy to drink at 9.99% ABV."
"The beer was bright and clear, the color was a dark amber, copper with a thick, off-white bubbly head that left some good lacing. The smell has lots of brown sugar, a good helping of grapefruit and a hint of vinegar. I first tasted alcohol in the back of my mouth, then there was an overwhelmng brown sugar taste. In the background you could barely taste a hint of bitter, citrusy hops, the beer finishes sweet. This is a very thick brew, it has low carbonation and every sip leaves you wanting more. At first the taste is kind of strong but after awhile it smooths out and this became a very enjoyable drink."
"D. I found this to be very drinkable. Wasnt complex to where youd want to sip it and you'd never guess it was a 10 abv beer. I bought a six pack and in the same week i found myself going back for another. Highly Recommended very well balanced tasty beer."
"The mouthfeel if full and thick, deserves to be sipped and savored. Balanced carbonation also helps to keep the higher ABV and sweetness in check. Overall a great full flavored unique offering from the brewery I usually pass on because of their aggressive Pacific hop tendencies but this is perfectly balanced and delicious."
"D: Drinkability isn't bad, but it's a little far on the sweet and boozy side."
"Full bodied, as mentioned a good, unique balance of bitter and sweet. Good carbonation level and a strong bitter finish. Very drinkable. Had it in the past, my buddy and I killed a growler in a short evening, so I'd say dangerously drinkable, really enjoyed this bottle this time."
"This beer is well balanced in every facet. It is hard to believe that this is 9.99%, it could certainly sneak up on you. It really reminds of a Belgian Strong PA. The sugar makes it different but is not overdone. An excellent value here."
"Very drinkable, dangerously so even, for such a big malty beer. The drinkability is especially surprising given the massive maltiness of this beer."
"Drinkability is ok. The sweetness fades too much when this warms and the hops become king of the mountain. Tough to plow through it, not that your supposed to. But I don't yearn for each sip quickly."
"Mouthfeel was huge but in a good way with all the layers of flavors. The higher ABV would make it hard to drink a bunch, but the taste makes you want to."
"D- High abv and strong flavors make this a sipper. A lot going on in this beer, but it's named improperly. Yes it fits the style but brown sugar is almost non-existent. I guess the name suggests sweetness, which this has plenty of."
"D: Good beer to try, not my favorite of the style but it does make me want to try more. I would get this one again to try but probably wont make it a staple in the fridge."
"Drinkability: A solid brew that defies classification. It is well-balanced between sweetness and bitterness and is surprisingly drinkable given its higher-than-average ABV. This is certainly something I highly recommend and something I could see myself drinking again."
"overall worth a try but nothing i would really like often"
"Notes: Another nice pick from Lagunitas, another take on their hoppy backbones here with an emphasis on the sugar and malt. Pretty pleasing."
"As for drinkability -- while this ale is delicious, it left a very sweet and alcoholic taste in my mouth that left me clamoring for a glass of water."
"Mouthfeel is good due to the unique level of stickiness in the finish, and drinkability is just ok, as I can see the sweetness getting overpowering fast. Good experiment-turned-staple from Lagunitas."
"D- Much more drinkable than I thought. Despite the high ABV, this goes down EASY. And this is balanced. Sweet in a very good way...but hops keep things in check. This is far different. Very good!"
"Very nice. Makes an excellent after-dinner brew.I wouldn't have more than two."
"alcohol was just an after thought, i could not taste it at all which made this pretty drinkable."
"This beer was really good."
"I've had it before and knew it was good. But I had a friend with me who liked to dabble a bit in craft beer. So he had me suggest a drink for him, and he loved it."
"D- this is dangerous! The combination of flavor and lack of the 9.999% alcohol presence make this delicious. I do think this is may be a one or two bottle doing the trick. Nevertheless, it's pretty drinkable"
"Overall, I was very impressed with this brew not knowing what to expect. Tons of solid flavors and the alcohol is masked very well."
"This is an awesome beer, no question. But, as far as MY tastes go, I would tone down the sweetness in favor of the hops. The Arrogant Bastard trio is pretty hard to compete against. Unfortunately for this beer, that's what I've drank the previous 2 nights."
"Lagunitas wins again. They decided to make a brown sugar strong ale, and they have done it perfectly!"
"D- this is a sipper, i couldnt drink too many of these, with that being said it was a very intriguing beer, the combination of the strong ale and barleywine flavors is a nice concept, a nice one to grab in singles during the winter months"
"Too drinkable for it's ABV, use caution."
"Sure the amber brown color with nice head lures one into a false sense of security...Then BAM you take one to the buds!!!! The strong alcohol detracts from the buzz of this beer. This beer is tough and definitely not a session brew. However, if you can stick through the first half of the bottle the beer smooths out...most likely cuz the taste buds are numb. Certainly worth a try, but a six will do just fine."
"D - goes down easy, beware of the abv."
"Knowing the history, I thoroughly expected to hate this beer and I went into this tasting with extreme skepticism. Sometimes you just get surprised. This was one of those times. The appearance was average, the smell was nice, sugary, wheaty, but all that was somewhat average - the taste and drinkability is the compelling factor here. Very unique, highly sessionable ""ale"" as they call it but I'd not only drink this again, but want to try it fresh from tap. This was a 'sweet' surprise."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into dimpled mug. Aroma is sweet, dates, and nutty with alcohol notes present. Picked up more brown sugar this time around (2010 version). Taste is sweet malt with a residual hop bitterness and a hint of alcohol. Malt flavor is long lasting with a heavy mouthfeel. Mild carbonation. Reminds me of a barley wine mixed in a nut brown ale. A nice winter brew IMO."
"DB- I remember having this before and being a bit confused. I have come to understand what is going here somewhat but it still feels strange. The multiple style mixture feels somewhat abrasive but I cannot stop taking huge gulps of this. A not so common combination of flavors but a must try for craft beer fans. Brown + Barleywine + IPA + brewing skill = this beer...?"
"I liked this one"
"D - A nice all around great ale from Lagunitas. Very balance and tasty. I'd get this again for sure."
"Picked up a 6 pack at BevMo for $9. Excellent for the price."
"In short, worth a try."
"This is a solid winner but for drinkability it's one of those beers I have to feel to be in the right mood for since it's a little one dimensional. Still a great beer!"
"D: Gotta be a 4. Can't rate it any higher because 2 might do you in on an empty stomach. A lightweight might not be able to drive after 1. Very easy to drink though, and tasty enough to make me look for it again."
"Full in body, wetting to the palate, and a warm finish."
"2010. Pours a clear, reddish amber color with almost no head. Smells of brown sugar and hops. I also pick up a lot of dark fruits and cinnamon. I also get slight bread notes and cherry. Taste is in your face with sweet malts and hoppiness. The brown sugar definitely makes itself noticeable, unlike the high ABV, which is untraceable. It finishes with nice dark fruit flavors and sugary sweetness. This beer could easily bee classified as an American Baleywine. Mouthfeel is well balanced and a bit syrupy. Drinkability is scary high for such a big beer. Another amazing offering from Lagunitas."
"D- Very interesting and the noise is very inviting. Goes down easily, ABV hidding well and easy to return to"
"D: I tend to stay away from comparing beer-to-beer, but think Arrogant Bastard with brown sugar. Yes. Yes yes yes."
"It is obviously very sweet, but is also quite hoppy/bitter. I am not sure that I would fully classify this as an American Strong Ale, but it was complex enough for me to try again. Especially at the cheap price of <$4 for a pint."
"Drinkability: Not bad, not great. I finished the bottle and wasn't looking for another one, so probably typical for the style. I'll say above average."
"D: The beer was pretty intense for the first few sips, but it became easier to drink as time passed (and as the alcohol took effect I suppose). The beer was so strong and filling that I was content after finishing one bottle; I wouldn't have wanted more. This beer would have been more drinkable to me if it leaned a little to the sweeter side as far as flavor is concerned. The strong bitterness of the hops was equally matched by the malt presence, but there wasn't really any sweetness that I expected in a beer called Brown Shugga'."
"love this beer overall, and always look forward to it."
"drinkability is so so - i could not finish the whole bottle (it was just too heavy and sweet) but i did enjoy most of it"
"This is a bit thinker than most of the IPA's iv'e had and thats not a bad thing. I definitely have to say that as iv'e had a few drink i begin to taste the alcohol a bit more. I am still surprised by the fact that this is ABV 9.99% and its so easy to drink . Good for Lagunitas."
"D: I was hoping for something more sweet with less of that very common American IPA flavor. It is a good beer other than that, just not what I was looking for."
"This beer pours a ruby color with a one inch reddish white hear. The aroma is of grapefruit and pine. It is a strong, but rather uninteresting aroma. The taste is similar with a sharp alcohol presence that distracts from the rest of the beer. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer at best. The only other beers I've had that I can recall having such an in your face alcohol presence were all malt liquors, and to be honest I think I could easily describe this beer as being a hoppy malt liquor."
"D - The syrupy mouth feel and its sweetness, I am not sure that i could have more than of these per evening."
"Poured gently for a firm 1-finger head, reduces to a light film, average lacing, color is the most beautiful deep clear crimson I've ever seen in a beer. The aroma of this fresh hop profile is deep and spicy on the nose. Brown sugar on the nose? Well....yes, but hidden behind the hops. The taste is the same way, with strong-bitter-spicy hops encasing the brown sugar. Drinks well for a strong ale, with some raisin flavor that sticks to the palate. I would go out of my way for this beer provided it is a yearly release. Very impressive."
"M, D- I've reviewed too many hyper-hopped bitter bombs of which I commented ""Too bad it didn't have the sweetness to balance properly."" Well, here is a fine example of that desired balance."
"i first had this on cask at stoddards in boston and was one of the best beers ive ever had. the bottle lacks the original pint i had but still a great beer"
"D: Quite drinkable, thought with a high ABV, I'd probably be careful with having a lot in one sitting."
"Goes down smooth enough but the sweetness might keep from enjoying more than one in a sitting. Even with the slight warming at the end of each sip the 10%ABV is well hidden."
"Drinkability: I really liked this one after the first few sips, it seemed to be very smooth and balanced. But it became increasingly hard to drink the more I had. Just a little too harsh with the bitterness and alcoholic burn."
"The alcohol is there, no denying that, but it does not show its true strength. Dangerously drinkable comes to mind; Lagunitas--making sweet beer taste excellent."
"Good stuff. Not the best barleywine out there but still very good. Enjoyed it."
"cellent mouthfeel. What more can you ask for?"
"Slight peppery finish, dry fruity aftertaste."
"I really enjoyed this beer and will have to try it again on a more regular basis. I really think that they did a nice job here."
"Drinkability: This is one of those beers that falls into the ""dangerously drinkable"" category. It sips so easily that it would quite possible to forget the high ABV until it sneaks up on you. So I put it in the category of a one a night beer. That said, I did enjoy this beer and have added it to my shopping list for the future."
"Brown Shugga' goes down pretty easily, but the stickiness and maltiness hurt the drinkability of this beer for me. I really dig the hop flavors, but I am not such a fan of the malt profile. This is a very interesting beer none the less, and a nice hopping offering to get me in the mood for some of the crazy DIPAs that will be coming out soon."
"Its a good name for this brew i reckon definately suits it anyway it pours a cherry hue with average carbonation that leaves a one finger head and some sporadic lacing,the aroma is beautiful very wintery with hints of toasted marshmallows,burnt toffee,pancakes cover in maple syrup and pine residue,it has a medium bodied mouthfeel which is perfectly carbonated for the style and almost leaves a sticky feeling on your mouth which really lets the flavour's of marshmallows dipped in hot caramel,pure honeycomb,piney residue laced hops and maple syrup all make themself known and i found all through the drop it had a nice sweet brown sugar background to it and hence i think the name is spot on it really suits it and overall its one of those drops that really does not have a fill in as i have not tasted anything similar and im stoked i bought more than the one of."
"Not bad, but the alcohol really shows here. Other than that, just some sweetness, and not a lot of depth. Another overly alcoholic beer with no nuance. Not something I would recommend."
"Medium body, smooth and creamy as I've ever tasted, no trace of the ABV. Dangerous."
"This is one wild beer. Poured into a Sam Adams 'Guinness-shaped' pint with a brown body and decent tan head, good on the lacing. Smells sweet and spicy a little hops. Oh boy 51 IBUs is perfect for this beer, any less might allow the shugga to be overpowering. The hop-taste is great and refreshing through all the other action in here. It's a very heavy beer, with good carbonation. Had two of these but rather would share with a friend than drink em both."
"Drinkability - Overall, it's not a -bad- beer, but I can't say I'm a fan of it. It's a little over-hopped and I don't think brown sugar works very well in an I.P.A., I was expecting a stout or a brown ale for this one."
"O: Not my favorite offering from Lagunitas, but still ""good"". Probably won't get another sixer this year, although I am hanging onto the last one from this pack to see how it changes. Interesting and though provoking beer, just not my favorite."
"Overall this beer is quite drinkable for it's strength and not cloyingly sweet as I expected. The flavor profile is relatively simple, though satisfying. I would drink this again."
"Overall, it was good but just couldn't get into this one too much. Maybe some age would tone down the booziness which would help there but the sweet would stay. Avail here in TX. Rotation - glad I tried it but one is enough for me [N;N]"
"D-For the ABV on this one, it's incredibly drinkable and and reminds me a lot of DIPA's like The Oracle"
"Served from tap into a sampler shaker. Poured red-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sweet hops, and brown sugar. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus/bitter hops, alcohol, and brown sugar. It had a medium feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I was definitely liking the hoppiness that this one brought to the table. Pretty well balanced as well. Good aroma going on that wasn't too sharp as to scare you away. This is a must try at least once."
"d. 3.5."
"Drinkability -- This one grew on me. Didn't care for it upon the first sip, but as the beer warmed I warmed to it. An apt description would be a hopped up imperial red ale paired with delicate baked goods. A bit sweet, yes, but pretty nice. Better than I had anticipated."
"D - This beer is a mouthful, lots of malt...especially caramel, lots of adjuncts, lots of alcohol, and a good deal of hops. They are all in balance, but quite a bit of complexity, make it fun to drink but a couple in one sitting is plenty."
"Drinkability: Enjoyable beer by a top notch brewery that I will be drinking again."
"Served in a Lagunitas glass, first time I have seen it on draft. Brownish orange color, big fluffy off-white head, long lasting foam and lace trails. Smells of malty sweetness, caramelized or burnt sugar, slightly fruity as well. I was expecting a very sugary sweet taste, but was really suprised by the balance. Lots of toasted, caramel malt. The brown sugar is in there, but with enough hops to keep the sweetness in check. Thick but not sticky or cloying mouthfeel, very smooth and creamy, good carbonation. Very drinkable, can not feel the high (9.9%) alcohol."
"Very unique, the brown sugar flavor is there, it's sweet and a bit chewy. Nice layers of spices and maltiness come through a it warms. The carbonation is a bit low, but it is well done and smooth drinking. Overall another slam dunk for Lagunitas."
"Future outlook: More please. Need to designate a few of these for cellaring as well..."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a deep amber color with nice red tints when held to the light along with an off white 2 finger creamy head that left great lacing down the glass as I drank it. The aroma is heavy hop handed with some sweet caramel and brown sugar (as the title supports). The taste is knock your socks off good. I mean the balance of hops and sweet malt along with a thick consistency and mild warmth of alcohol in the finish. It starts with a slight citrus and pine hops but then the sweetness hits the back of your mouth. The finish is nice and bitter with the slight hint of alcohol on the tongue. This brew is something I am going to seek out again as all I had was the one sample. This one will not disappoint."
"A pretty enjoyable DIPA analogue, with the brown sugar just adding to the war effort against the big West Coast hops - attrition we can all appreciate."
"drinkability? do i even need to comment? i fucking LOVE this stuff...LOVE Lagunitas, LOVE everything they make."
"A nice holiday beer. Very good on a cold night, but not something I would want every day."
"Great beer! Reminded me a little of Oaked Arrogant Bastard, so when I either can't find one of those fresh or don't want to pay the high price, I think this may be a good substitute. Thanks to the guys from Lagunitas for putting this out, I'll drink this quite often!"
"D- Awesome. I could drink a lot of this. The alcohol is integrated very well. Great texture, nice finish, extremely well balanced from start to finish."
"this is my new fav beer from lagunitas. i really like what they did here with this brew. I adore the blends of barley and brown sugar used in this beer. I think it has a GREAT taste and ratio. great job highly recommended !! i have a 6er in the fridge at all times now ... till it runs out !"
"Pours clear brownish amber with a nice tan head with awesome retention. Plenty of lacing on the glass. Very attractive looking beer. In the nose you get piney hops with a bit of caramel and some dark fruit sweetness. Taste sweet with a little bitterness from the hops. Starts off with caramel and brown surgar notes. Then cherries in the middle to give it more of a fruity sweetness. Finishes with a citric hops bite along with a little alcohol warmth. Delicioius. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with little carbonation. Leave a sorta sticky oily feeling on the palate. Not bad, but different. The hight ABV and sweetness keep the drinkablity down. I could drink a couple of these and enjoy the hell out of them. Although probably stop there. More than likely i would revisit this one in the future. well worth what i paid for it."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. As I get further in the beer, the sweetness and bitterness begins to take its toll and as it warms the alcohol really becomes apparent. Near the beginning, it's a fantastic beer, but it drags on as I drink more."
"Medium drinkability, as this is very sweet and too sweet to be a session beer, but I enjoyed this quite a bit as a beer to sip and savor. High recommendation as this was very tasty and complex, and that 9.99% ABV is nowhere to be found; great job hiding the power! Mick Jagger would be proud."
"Drinkability: I'm liking it, but I'd rather just have their Gnarleywine. Not sure what the point of this one is. Much better than when I stuck it in the cellar a year and a half ago."
"D: This is tasty but a bit conflicting and out of balance."
"Overall a quality offering that has a well rounded taste and mouthfeel. Either as an introduction to craft beers or an evening session beverage, this offering is a very good example of quality craft brewing."
"Been wanting to try this one for awhile now. Finally picked up a six pack. Amber, slightly brown body with a thin off white head that persists throughout. Slightly hoppy, nutty, sweet grain aroma. As the name suggests, the flavor has notes of a big brown ale - caramel brown sugar, slightly roasty, nutty, and malty. Hops take a back seat to the sweet malt flavor. Moderate carbonation with a chewy body. Finishes with a slight espresso roast, slightly bitter, and sticky. Glad this one comes in a six pack - very drinkable."
"D: I like this beer a lot. It is very different from a barleywine or DIPA. The sugar sweetness adds something different relative to malt sweetness. The large amount of hops help to bring towards balance, but there is so many hops and so much sugar that it is impossible to imagine this would ever be referred to as balanced. It is very difficult to imagine drinking more than one of these at a time given the alcohol and ""bigness", but every time I remember I have some in the basement, I am happy. Definitely worth trying for anyone who likes ""big"" beers."
"Once agaian Lagunitas hit it out of the park...Pour dark amber with a nice thick head that stays with the beer. And a very lace. The Sweet Release is a nice winter beer, with great flavor. Drinkability is is so nice you must be aware of it's 9.9 ABV. This is a beer I will enjoy again, and I hope you enjoy this one also..."
"Once again... Loved this beer."
"Drinkability: Comes across as a light, grapefruit-hoppy Barleywine. Sounds good, but too sticky and boozy."
"M/D: It has a full medium juicy body with a thinner finish, a nice medium carbonation, making it a very drinkable beer. It has such a juicy finish that I just want more. Dangerously drinkable."
"D- This was a pretty solid brew. Could have used a bit more balance with additional bitterness."
"Really, really enjoying this beer - I would highly recommend it."
"Too sweet to drink more than a couple but something good to try. One is enough for me for a while. A bit too much sweetness for it to be a favorite of mine."
"It pours a very deep amber with about a finger of head. I got no lace. The smell is pretty light for a strong ale. Toasted brown sugar, toffee and citrus drift into my nose holes. The taste starts shockingly sweet. Very malty, very sweet. It is almost balanced by citrus and pine hop flavor but not quite. A bit better than last years cola taste. It is still far too sticky and leaves a mouth coat for days. I get that its thick, strong and sugary but it becomes a bit much by the end. On the drinkability scale, eh, always an interesting beer to sample each year, but the ABV and sweetness scream hangover, even if you're careful. Still, pretty tasty if you are in the mood for sweet and heavy."
"EDIT: 11/19/2012: Brown Shugga's back, so I went back and looked at my old beer novice review. ""Who the hell would mix a barleywine and an IPA?"" I guess I really hadn't had many barleywines at all then! I still think the sugared grapefruit line is perfect for the finish though."
"D- This is one fine beer. I mean, I wouldn't expect to down a full 6er while watching a football game, but it certain makes for a nice after dinner beverage...or a before dinner beverage...or an after breakfast beverage...you get the point. It ain't bad, folks."
"-Bye"
"Drinkability- Highly drinkable despite high ABV. I have never had more than 6 in a row, seemed like 2 too many."
"While this isn't my favorite beer out there, it was definitely a change of pace and a good drink. I'd probably have it again."
"Deep caramel in color with hints of amber and perfect clarity. Poured with a rich, foamy off-white head that leaves a well defined ladder of sticky lacings. Citrus orange and grapefruit aromas with an underlying sweet sugary aroma. Smooth, creamy feel with soft, pleasant carbonation.Medium to full bodied. Grapefruit and orange citrus flavors ride a wave of sweetness through the middle. Finishes lazily with sweet caramel flavors that taper to pine hop flavors and the faintest hint of alcoholic heat. The way the flavors come to a slow finish really slows the pace of this to a sipper. A nice combination of sweet caramel flavors and citrus hops."
"I first tried this beer years ago, though I don't remember it being this hoppy, this flavorful, or dammit, this GOOD. Honey honey, aw shugga shugga."
"Bright reddish ruby in body topped by thick, off-white head that leaves a ring of lacing. Strong aroma of pineapple, some citrus, candy sugar, toffee, and molasses. A warming drink: molasses, toffee, citrus, booze, hop resin, some bitterness, some spice, finishes dry. Thick in body with medium carbonation. A tasty, surprisingly drinkable strong ale."
"I loved the brown sugary smell with some spicy hops and the equivalent taste--caramel coats your mouth, brown sugar leaps out at you, there's just enough citrus hop to keep things bitterly interesting. Alcohol is very well masked, although it does creep in at the end of the swallow. I thought the mouthfeel was not really full-bodied enough to hold up the taste, which is why I've marked it down, but it was still a delicious beer, sweet and boozy like the most deliciously alcoholic coffee cake you've ever had."
"D- Moderate."
"D- About right for a dark beer with 9% ABV"
"D-A little lower because of the high ABV, but still delicious. Pick up a 6 pack if you can."
"Overall a very nice beer with good balance between malt and hops."
"D: A solidly made, drinkable beer."
"D: I would surely buy this again, and again, and again."
"D - you would never guess this was a high octane beer, very sweet tastiness with a strong hop balance, i'm convinced that Lagunitas only brew home runs"
"12oz bottle into Delirium Noel Tulip. Aggressive pour yields a nice white foam head on light brownish red beer. The aroma is malty and sweet-smelling with some very light dark fruit notes. The taste starts with brown sugar (or is that just the name?!) leading into a sweet maltiness that coats the palette. A little bit of a spicy alcohol burn into the finish. Overall a very nice beer and different from any of Lagunitas's other offerings."
"I'm definitely going to buy at least another 6 pack of this stuff, its WAY too good not to buy more of."
"Drink - A nice sipper beer that is good for the holidays/colder weather. I'm happy I tried it."
"We walk the woods, searching for chanterelles. Uncertain whether we should open this beer. Finally, we find one! To celebrate we pop the top and walk around aimlessly for another half hour with only a few hedgehogs to show for it. It is hoppier than usual, perhaps just much more fresh? But the citrus hops are big and bold as company to the shugga and carmelized malt sweetness. Finishes very nicely, without the lingering sweetness of years past. The smell is strong alcohol and citrus with the malt. It is distinctively Lagunitas. Definitely excellent. Sexy red in the glass, too."
"D: This is a great winter sipper. I would buy this beer again for sure."
"D: Very good beer, but not my favorite strong ale. Reminded me too much of an IPA, but I still enjoyed it."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is well balanced and more enjoyable than I would have believed considering what some others have said about this brew being sickening sweet. For almost 10% abv the alcohol is hidden fairly well but not completely masked."
"Drinkability - really interesting beer that has a dynamic I've never tasted before. The beer is complex yet simple. One for the sweetness on my charts. Thanks to SpinRSX for the afternoon sampling."
"D - This high octane ale is incredibly drinkable, with the ABV very nicely hidden. Nice bold flavours with the hops and malts nicely balanced. I have yet to be disappointed by these guys, and this is yet another winner. Scrumptious indeed!"
"D - For me the warmer it got the better it seemed. It seemed to expand in the mouth and the heat of the ABV came through. I could drink this all night!"
"Tastes exactly like what I had hoped, a full boogey ale full of rich roasted malt and a nice hop balance. The heat from the 10% ABV is so nice. This is practically the perfect beer for me. Hope these are available in Heaven."
"Drinkability: A sipper. I struggled. Too sweet and nourishing. Feels like a whole meal (dessert, in fact). As it warmed up, it became unbearably hot and sweet. Not like a huge barleywine, but just unpleasant, like hot-and-cooked orange juice. I left one quarter of my pint. Not a big fan of this one..."
"D: The higher abv is not very upfront at all, which really adds to the drinkability, but the bitterness seems to linger for a bit, hurting drinkability. Overall, it is pretty smooth and definitely tasty. The sweetness does eventually catch up with this beer."
"Note: this review is from notes from 11/29/10."
"D) A decent brew. I might consider another if it's the first beer of the night - the ABV is up there!"
"This is a great, unique, hoppy beer that really doesn't know what style it wants to be, but it's awesome. Lagunitas says it's a ""Barleywine gone wrong"".. works for me!"
"Perfect for the fall season!"
"Thick mouthfeel, almost chewy. No alcohol noticeable, and for 9.99%, that is crazy. Best to stick to one."
"Also, I will be cellar-aging a few to look for developments over the next year and a half"
"Drink- Would be a good session beer on a cold day while camping around the fire."
"12oz bottle. Pours a copper color with a thin head that dissipates quickly. Small amount of lacing. Aromas of hops, brown sugar, and an overall sweet smell. Taste is hops mixed with brown sugar. Sweet, boozey and somewhat bready. This beer has that nice hoppiness to it you expect from Lagunitas, but the brown sugar sweetness is almost too much. Overall I like it and this is a high octane brew that drinks well but it is very sweet."
"D: I have nothing but positive things to say about this beer. It might be among my favorites of all time."
"Excellent balance of sweet and bitter. Easy does it! 9.99ABV not evident, sip slowly and enjoy the great melding of flavor. Tasty, caramel-coated hoppy goodness. Not to be missed. Get some!!"
"This is a beautiful looking beer, golden red. I want paint my living room this color. It smells of the the brown sugar. There is a very one dimensional smell here, all sugar on the nose, overpowering everything else. This is a very good tasting beer. The dominating taste is sweetness but not without complexity For such a sweet beer there is a decent amount going on beyond just sweetness. This is a very drinkable and pleasant beer. The mouthfeel is pleasant and this is more drinkable than any 9.99% beer has a right to be. Overall, this beer is a little top heavy with the sweetness but I'll be damned if it's not an entirely enjoyable beer."
"D - Very high abv and too much flavor for me to session (although I managed three on Thanksgiving). The flavors open up more as it warms so I would recommend sipping it."
"In all this is pretty good. I remember I had this last year at at bodega. I wouldn't have many qualms with drinking this again."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: A bit chewey in the mouthfeel, alcohol is big but not overstated here. A pretty delicious beer and I do plan to drink more of this."
"I can't believe this beer is 9.9% ABV seeing as I sip them like wine coolers on the daily. There is only one store in my set that carries them and I buy him out of stock in singles regularly. Beautiful red tint, smooth going down. High class no matter how you look at it."
"D - The drinkability is very good for what it is, I think I could drink it like an 8% beer rather than a 10%. I really do notice the alcohol as it warms but the well blended roasty, nutty and brown sugar notes really keep you interested for 1-2 of em. Pretty damn good to me, I would definitely buy this one again for sure, very enjoyable. Cheers!"
"I'm very impressed by how well hidden the alcohol is in this brew. Overall, it's awesome. I'll be sure to take my time with this, even though i feel as though i could drink it within 15 minutes."
"Drinkability: With an ABV this high, this is a sipping and savoring beer for me, but it did go well with a roast beef burrito for dinner. While I can feel the alcohol a bit about halfway down the glass, this beer is so smooth and tasty I could see myself fooled into another one if I didn't know it was this high of an ABV content. A dangerously drinkable beer."
"Good beer to warm you for the winter months. The hops are strong but balanced."
"D- the large amount of hops in this one seems out of place, but this is a brewery that loves to over-hop things. i bet this one gets even better with a few years on it. a great value at $9.99/sixer on this one. too strong to think about more than one at a time."
"D-This is quite drinkable for such a big beer at 9.99% (overly pedantic measures) and a good value. Nice that is bottled in 12 oz. six packs."
"Had this on tap at the beautiful farmer's market in Los Angeles. Pours a copper brown colour with a finger of thick white head, leaving lacing down the glass. Smells of brown sugar (no surprise) with a lot of nuttiness and mild hops (I typed in ""mold hops"" in my iPhone, but I'm pretty sure I meant ""mild""). Quite a refreshing beer, which is surprising when I came on here and saw this is listed as 10%!"
"It's really a great beer. Worth $8 a six pack."
"D- High on alcohol interrupts the complexity a bit. The hops cuts through the flavor profile, however the hops is a nice flavor. Very sweet in the aftertaste. A sipper for sure."
"Clear copper to bronze pour with nice white head and good retention. This beer has a strong sweet smell and this smell followed through into the taste. Candied sugars, vanilla, toffee and some butterscotch. This is a well balanced beer, medium body and a bit dry. I am not the biggest fan of 'sweet' beers but this one was decent and, as usual, Lagunitas consistently puts out good beers."
"Drinkability was pretty good. For 10 percent this beer was dangerously smooth. I had really high expectations for this beer which unfortunately werent met. Flavors were good but nothing stood out and made this beer memorable. Reminded me of a less flavorful version of Old Gnarlywine"
"The strong malt flavor starts in right away but the sweetness is blunted by stellar Pacific northwest hops. Caramel and toasted flavors predominate early but the finish is mostly oily pine. No lack of flavor here and very easy to down despite being a ten percenter. The texture is smooth and supple and very impressive to handle such a plethora of flavors. This one is not for everybody but those that like seriously high octane will like this Shugga'."
"Overall: This is a curious brew. So drinkable and deceptive that it should come with a warning sign. I'm going to definitely pick up another 12 or so of these, saving half to enjoy with a little age to see how it changes."
"I tried it last year and was happy to see it back on the shelves. I'm sure I'll be happy to see it next year, too."
"Amber colored beer with a slow fading huge head.Aroma is green apple and caramel.Taste is caramel,green apple and sugar cane.You don't feel the alcohol on your tongue and it goes down smoothly.Four of these and goodnight!I would buy again and recommend."
"12 ounce bottle. Pours a very clear amber with minimal head and no lacing, though the beer is so syrupy it sticks to the sides of the glass. Has a barleywine style smell, with dark fruits like raisins, to begin with. This aroma is chased by loads of brown sugar notes. Tasting the beer for the first time you immediately notice the thick mouthfeel, though it's not unpleasant. Brown Shugga is full bodied with minimal carbonation. Alcohol is cleverly hidden, save for a little bit of a burn down in your chest after you drink it. The taste has a lot of different things going on. There are some minor fruit notes, but for me this is a lot like waffles and maple syrup. Mild citrus hops help lend balance to the beer. Oddly enough, even with all of the sugary notes this finishes quite dry, which leaves you wanting more. Despite the heavy body, it's really easy drinking. Call it the perfect fall beer."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Reminds me of Bigfoot a bit. I was not at all let down by this beer. A fantastic Barleywine that is a solid winter seasonal for hopheads to snag a sixer of."
"12oz. bottle served in my DT tulip. Pours a beautiful burnt red/copper with a loose half inch, tan-colored head that reduces its volume by half in less than a minute before eventually settling into a swirl and a band. Clarity is translucent. Nose is a little difficult to decipher - sweet malt, a slight vinegary quality and maybe a trace of soy sauce. Taste follows nose - definitely getting that salty, soy sauce flavor following the malty/brown sugar start. There's also a light hops presence that helps balance out the sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with a slightly oily quality and an easy, even carbonation. Not sure how I feel about this one. It's not bad, and I would certainly try it again, but it's not what I would consider exemplary."
"Overall this is a very nicely balanced brew, though the Hops are bid and up front, the malts and sweet sugga' are present and make this a nice flavorful brew. Lagunita's continues to amaze me. Several bar patrons told me this is the best version over the last several years. not as sweet and hops tones down from years past."
"Notes: There could have been a lot of things that went wrong with this brew, but everything is nicely balanced. I've always liked Lagunitas lineup of big beers, but they've earned my respect with this one."
"Sweeetttt! Someone talked in a forum post about pumpkin ales about a bartender rimming the glass with brown sugar....i think this one more qualifies. great beer."
"Drinkability- overall this beer is pretty drinkable despite its big 9.9 punch, its got maybe a touch much on the hop end for me and maybe would of like to seen kick more of malt too, but overall its decent beer but falls short of what i would call great, would be interesting to try with a bit of age on this beer, one thing i do start to notice though is alot of the lagunitas beers im starting to feel do taste quite the same not a bash but just hey im starting to see that"
"Would certainly have this beer again, though like I said would need to keep in mind that it is a 10% beer."
"Let this one sit too for at least a couple of years."
"D: Easily drinkable despite the abv; well disguised in the beer. Surprisingly well-balanced and not as one-dimensional as many."
"D: High, for the ABV. I enjoy this a lot, and will be looking around for similar beers as winter rolls in. A very balanced beer, for this season."
"Pours a deep orangish bronze/amber. Thick three inch solid white head and big lacing. Very malty and sweet smelling. Caramel, brown sugar and molasses on top of a fresh bread smell. Taste is also malty sweet. Malt, caramel toffee and molasses on top of a thick substantial bicuity body. All this sweetness is cut by a spicy herbal hoppy kick at the finish. It's still more bready and sweet than bitter though. I can feel some alcohol burn on on my lips. The mouthfeel is very satisfying. Thick, creamy and chewy. This is a big beer with good, complex flavors. With the thick sweet bready body combined with the ABV, it doesn't drink very easy. I would have a hard time drinking multiple bottles at the same time. I guess at 10% your not supposed to."
"D = i gave this one a lower rating here just because i didn't particularly love it. it's a good example of the style but i felt there were too many strong sensations competing to really enjoy it, definitely worth trying at the very least"
"The sweetness becomes a bit cloying but Lagunitas did an excellent job of balancing the flavors in this beer (and the alcohol is almost undetectable). Very nice to sip on a winter evening."
"D - Very heavy, and high in alcohol so you might want to stop at 2. I do enjoy this beer so much i think i can drink it all night though."
"D: all around good beer, I could drink 100 of these. I'm not the biggest fan of sweet beers, but this one is firing with all six pistons: sweet and roasty malt, highly bitter and aromatic hops, syrupy body, alcohol heat, It's call ""brown shugga"" with good reason, but it has great balance. Not the most exciting beer out there but highly highly sessionable. Also it doesn't hurt that it's a great winter warmer."
"Taste is malty, sweet and some good hops. Very creamy on the tongue and really a nice beer to drink. Somehow this came across as a little watery. Overall, it is a good refreshing beer."
"D- A unique take, but not sure that it's making me really want to come back for more, glad I tried it, but that's about as far as it goes."
"D - Very drinkable, especially for the ABV! Once again, another beer I love from Lagunitas, I have yet to be disappointed!"
"Bottle pours a reddish orange with a thin off white head that settles to a ring. Smell is sugar, cinnamon, cough syrup/alcohol, fruity hops. Taste is very sweet off the bat, red licorice and boozy sugars. Has an artificial candy sweetness that has a bit of bitterness in the finish. The sweetness of the beer really masks most of the other elements. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a medium carbonation, not too sticky and a bit coating. As far as American Strong Ales go, this is one of the most drinkable. I think i would prefer to put this in an imperial red category. Very tasty and smooth."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. I would highly recommend this one. This is yet another great beer from Lagunitas. I'm starting to think that they can do no wrong."
"D: How in the world is this 9.99%? A little on the sweet side but enjoyable."
"Overall: This a tasty beer and although its a bit unbalanced, its a must try. Its original and refreshing and a great autumn beer."
"Bottle pours a clear reddish amber. Medium off-white head, fine bubbles, low carbonation, with attractive lacing. Sweet fermented orange aroma with some strange mustiness. The flavor is initially bitter (which I like) but quickly dissolves into a candy-like syrupy blend of flavors, the hops come on strong at the end. Texture is thick and heavy. Good body, decent mouthfeel. Just a bit too sugary sweet IMHO. I should have taken a clue from the name, huh?"
"D - You can drink one of these down no problem, but one is going to do it for you, unless you're aiming to get drunk."
"D: This is a nice beer. The brown sugar is obviously meant to compliment the flavor rather than define it. A good accompaniment to a chilly fall night."
"Drinability> in spite of the odd little i-don't-know-what... this is still a rather drinkable beer"
"Overall a solid brew especially for the price point...not surprising for a Lagunitas brew. A month or so might do this wonders but fresh is a nice balance of hop and malt"
"D - Considering the ABV, this drinkability is dangerous."
"The high alcohol and sugary taste makes this more of a sipper for me, despite what the label says to the contrary - ""Life is uncertain. Don't sip."" One at a time is enough for me."
"D= great beer. Ill be buying a lot of this in the future. Another home run by lagunitas. I could drunk this all day."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, from the motherland Lagunitas, into my Zatec fluted glass. Nice firm 2 fingers of tan head. Good retention and nice sticky icky lacing. Smells floral, sweet malt, a bit of Duncan Hines brownies. Sweet up front on the palate. Finishes earthy and bitter. Dangerous 10% beer. Johnny Dangerous."
"This beer pours a very nice reddish brown that has a nice fluffy white head that dissipates quickly leaving some lacing on the glass. There is a nice transparency to this beer that I didn't really expect. It looks greath in the light though. It smells like brown sugar, molasses, caramel, and some citrus fruit notes like lemon and orange. There is also a very nice hoppy smell to this, mmmm gotta love it. the taste is nice and hoppy up front with a definite alcohol kick. It is also cut by a nice brown sugary sweetness that works very well. There are also notes of Molasses, caramel, butterscotch, and some subtle citrus notes. This has a good mouthfeel, Goes down smooth, and has a good amount of carbonation. Nice medium body on this that gives it almost a creamy texture. I think the drinkability is good on this one. I would love to have a bunch of these around to break out whenever I wanted. The alcohol kick was more than I expected, but I think it was a pleasant surprise. I also thought that it was going to be much sweeter than it was, and I'm glad I was wrong. I think this was perfect the way that they did it. Good job Lagunitas. Cheers."
"Mouthfeel was thinner than expected for such a big beer. Nice & easy to drink. It would be dangerous to drink a few of these, but they would go down quite easy."
"Hazy brown-amber pour with a thin and foamy off-white head. Thin spotty lacing as well. The aroma is hoppy with sweet dark fruit and molasses coming through more as it warms. The labeling on this one really threw me off as I was expecting more of a sweet brown ale. Once my taste buds told me it was actually a Barley Wine I was able to accept the flavor. Very hoppy on the front end, along with some alcohol burn. The flavor mellows a bit as sweet malt start to seep in. The finish is round and fruity with an alcohol burn leftover. Above average, and kind of unique."
"D: Like it says on the bottle, ""It's like feeding raw shark to your gerbil."" This beer was young and could use some aging. Would love to get my hands on some barrel-aged BS, though."
"full/medium bodied with moderate carbonation. for a beer approaching 10% ABV this drinks pretty well."
"drinkability - this is a sipper for sure, the sweetness prevents me from craving another, but this is a decent beverage worth trying"
"A good beer. I think it will age well. Thbe hops will subside and perhaps reveal other layers and reduce prevalence of the ABV."
"Overall, an decent cool season beer with a unique sweet malty flavor, but dont plan on drinking more than one or two because both the sweetness and the abv creepy up on you."
"drinkability is great, this is something meant to be sipped of course despite the very hidden abv, but at the same time a few in a night wouldnt be a bad thing."
"Not the most drinkable beer due to its sweetness, but rock solid like most Lagunitas brews."
"Enjoyable, but nothing I could buy again."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"Overall I liked it, as I seem to with all of Lagunitas offerings I have tried. Less than most, but it grew on me as I finished the bottle."
"D-quite enjoyable the whole way through, i very much wish to have another, i know i will some day soon! i can see myself coming back to this beer frequently."
"Lagunitas is quickly becoming my favorite brewery. Everything I have had is fantastic! If you see this or any other Lagunitas beer pick it up and enjoy."
"O- Different than what i had expected though i enjoyed it and feel its a good example of an ASA."
"Too cloyingly sweet for my tastes; overwhelmingly so to the exclusion of any other background flavors. If you lived on Capn' Crunch as a kid, give this one a try."
"D: The residual sugar and the alcohol make this a sipping beer, while the sweetness makes it hard for me to finish. Overall, while an interesting beer, it's probably not something I would buy again. It's worth a try and it's a great experiment, but the finished product just doesn't fit together well. (3.0)"
"d 3.5-4 not sure if its complex enough for its size, and the astringency is a bit imbalancing [note: second bottle tried a couple months later did not strike me as imbalanced], but it's good, and better than i remembered actually. not unlike a good barleywine minus the dates and other dark fruits i like in m barleywines. but i wouldn't be surprised if this one grows on me. [note: the second time did seem better than the first]"
"The beer is actually not hard to drink compared to the strength and I think the alcohol at the end actually helps balance it, much like hops would in a stronger ale."
"Overall I never really know how sum up strong ales. They don't really have a certain criteria to base an opinion on. I love barley wines and this reminds me of one. I gues that means I like it."
"A tasty brew that is really enjoyable and doesn't take too much thought because of its simplicity. I'll definitely grab some the next time it comes out."
"D - Man I think I still have a few places around and can get them usually for around 2-3 dollars a bottle. I will see this again next year."
"if i had another couple of bottles, there'd be no second thoughts whatsoever finishing all three."
" have no idea of the age of the cask."
"o - great beer. I'm jealous of those of you who have this as a seasonal local. It reminds me of a scotch ale with a bigger hop profile. It is however a fairly simple beer. Not much going on inside."
"Poured a clear brown mahogany with a thin off white head but laced well the entire glass. A sugar malty sweet aroma with a hint of molasses. Sweet malty burnt carmel on the tongue with a slight hoppy finish. Medium body with nice carbonation. Very drinkable"
"D - A very drinkable beer but beware of the high 9.84% ABV on board which is very well hidden but will certainly catch up if you are not careful. Nice beer I like it!"
"is a sipper due to the detectable and warming booze as well as the almost-overwhelming sweetness. borders on being a mess, but pulls through with some pleasant complexity in a pretty unique beer."
"I love this beer partially because I love a sweet beer from time to time. It's really easy to drink despite the ABV, which I think is a little more masked on-tap."
"D - So, so drinkable. The awesomely complex flavor and the unique texture leave you wanting more and more."
"Truth be told it is tasting like an American style Barleywine minus some hops and maybe a different yeast strain. I love Lagunitas' brewing style, but I can't see drinking more than one of these at a time. Winter warmer? Yep. Campfire beer? Yep. Definitely worth a try to drink something different."
"A drinkable brew but it is a bit too sweet for anything except a dessert beer or nightcap. The alcohol is not noticeable but at 9.84 percent it will become apparent."
"What can I say? If you go into a beer called ""Brown Shugga'"" that boasts of its intense sugary sweetness without a sweet tooth, you're kind of a moron. The day I tried this beer, I was that moron. I can tell that this is a well-done beer if you like this flavor profile. I don't."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied and a surprisingly strong carbonation. Very easy drinking given the high ABV, hardly noticeable in the taste."
"D - This is a very well balanced and enjoyable ale. Would never guess that the ABV is almost 10%. The sweetness becomes a little too much after getting the bottom of the glass."
"There's a very good flavor in this beer! It's smooth, creamy, medium bodied...full of sweet caramel, toasted oats, Belgian yeasts, roasted malts, oak, and a small amount of hops. The aftertaste has some nice fruit notes...but still can't figure out the fruit. A very good and staple-like beer from Lagunitas."
"Pours a dark golden brown with a light rim of head. Carbonation seemed appropriate. The smell was a nice mix of resinous hops and sweet malty goodness which I would have enjoyed more if not for the whiff of alcohol that came along with it. Taste was of strong American hops, more citrusy that I would have expected, with gentle brown sugar flavor and a warm flush of alcohol you could feel in the belly. Very nice drinker."
"Pours a copper amber brown. Cloudy and many a floater. Very little head. Smells sweet and fruity. Grapefruit and pineapple. The taste is sweet and slightly bitter. This is goood. A delicious mistake by the Lagunitas crew. I'm tasting enough fruit (grapefruit and pineapple) top remind me of Sunday brunch. There is a little bit of toffee or butterscotch taste too. Slightly salty. You really don't catch how much alcohol is in this brew until you get towards the end or you look at the bottle. In other words, it is not at all obvious to me that I am getting drunk right now. THIS STUFF IS GOOOOD!"
"d- a wonderfully drinkable and delicious strong ale. the assault of flavor reveals its strength, but there is very little trace of actual heat. The whole thing comes off (in part because of the words on the packaging) as a beautiful accident. Would definitely pick up again."
"Pours a great deep brown with slight reddish hues. Small tan head leaves nice laces around the glass. Looks delicious. Whiff pre-pour is surprisingly filled with hops, not so much after in the glass. Once in the glass, it's pretty much all sweet brown sugar in the nose. Taste on this is an almost overwhelming sweetness, nice malty backbone that has a slight hop bitterness lingering in the background. Feel is slick and oily. Not heavy at all for such a ""big beer"". Dangerously drinkable, especially if you happen to have a sweet tooth."
"How come you taste so good. I cannot place why I have not reviewed this beer yet. This must be my fifth sixer in the past year. And by far one of my favorites. I will not lie, the awesomeness by volume is what drew me to this beer the first time. It is by far the taste that kept me coming back. I almost gave a poor review this time, due to the fact that I drank it straight from the fridge, however this beer is certainly served best cool not cold. The sweetness, a factor I typically do not agree with is the factor that makes this beer so intriguing to me. I thoroughly enjoy the heavy mouthfeel, the heavy alcohol and the dirty finish this beer gives me. That damn dog has done it again and I want it to do it again and again. I rate this one the top of my list right next to 1554, but remember to pack a toothbrush if you aren't drinking it at home. The alcohol is too high for you to drive home and the stoutness of the ale will make your teeth feeling like they are wearing sweaters the next morning. Like the bottle says: Life is uncertain: Don't sip!"
"D: Overall an excellent full bodied beer. Very complex. Big time malty sweetness, balanced by a heafty dose of hops. A quality offering for sure and I will try and pick some up next winter."
"Drinkability is way to easy for this monster. Where is the 9%+?"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Sam Adams pint glass. The beer is a crystal clear dark brown with a light fizzy head that fades away pretty quickly. The aroma is Malay sweet with notes of alcohol. Taste is similar, although the added brown sugar definitely ups the sweetness factor. I was a little disappointed with this one until I realized that it was around 10 percent and the fellows at Lagunitas had done a pretty good job balancing the many aspects of this brew. Overall, the more I drank of this the more I found myself enjoying it...funny how that works."
"D - A sweeter and tasty beer that I can see myself purchasing again in the future. I bought this around Christmas time and to me this seems like a good beer for the holidays."
"Brown Shugga' is as sweet and tantalizing as it sounds. Most beers of this style and strength drink with a callousing nerve and stiff backbone; this one melts over the palate with tender pulses and delicate jitter. If only everyone had as much reason to be proud of what they do as the people at Lagunitas Brewing... what a world that would be."
"From hearing people talk, I thought this would be super sweet, but I think it had a pretty good balance. Like a malty barleywine."
"2004 Vintage, Bottle, City Beer Store. Ok, so, this isn't how the beer normally tastes, but I enjoyed it and I'll go back for a normal review sometime. There was no real hop aroma or flavor at this point. The beer is pretty much a sweet malt bomb. It actually reminded me of a doppelbock to some extent. There's a big sugary caramel flavor that dominates. The beer has taken on some light sherry notes. The body is beginning to thin out but it seems to be holding up against time better than the gnarleywine, oddly. The caramel malt and brown sugar sweetness aren't quite as overpowering or simplistic as you might expect. The flavor is round and full without being cloying. Very nice."
"Between Avery, DFH, and Lagunitas...what a great lot."
"Keep them coming Lagunitas."
"D: It's a solid beer, but experimental. Quite sweet, with lots of root beer flavor and a nice thick mouthfeel."
"What a completely unexpected treat this one was."
"Clear coppery chestnut color, creamy off-white head, good retention and lacing. Smell is sweet carmel, brown sugar, lightly roasted nuts with a touch of dark fruit and yeast on the nose. Bold sweet carmel and brown sugar flavors with a more pronounced and bitter hop presence then the smell let on. Touches of fruit and yeast on the finish. Full bodied, heavy on the tounge, like melted carmel itself, fairly pronounced sweet and bitter aftertastes. Good beer, stops short of being cloying, but would be hard to have more than one."
"A pretty good beer that has a terrible name. To date I've thought it was a brown ale. WRONG - this is quite hoppy and the name deceives."
"D - Not more than an occasional treat, perhaps. It is the beer equivalent of candy or dessert."
"For the price of this beer (less than $2 for a 12oz bottle locally) it's hard to find another beer this big and full of flavor."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is average, it's too sweet for it to be that drinkable. It was a decent tasting beer to have one of but it's a little too sweet and high in alcohol to have much of."
"D- a decent brew but not something i'd drink over & over again, a bit too cloyingly sweet while making you want it more is not a good combo w/ a 9.8% ABV brew IMO"
"Drinkability - Excellently drinkable, if you find the bittersweet taste to your liking. As previously mentioned, the stength of the beer is hardly noticeable, mostly due to the other striking components. At nearly 10%, this beer is more drinkable than many beers far weaker."
"A medium-full body, but surprisingly light and clean considering the high ABV and the sweetness. For how sweet this is, I don't find it cloying at all. Rather it is smooth and quite easy drinking."
"The overall taste of the beer was very smooth. It was very drinkable, could easily sit there and before I know need another one. Which is impressive for a 9 plus ABV. It was hoppy but also sweet, the sweetness is probably why this 9 plus beer is so easy to drink."
"Poured into a Sam Adams glass. Great clear copper color with a big off white fluffy head that quickly goes into a thin film with minor lacing. Aroma of cotton candy and caramel malt. The taste took me by surprise, I was expecting a super sweet brew and the first mouthful was sweet like toffee. As I progressed it did not seem as sweet and I was starting to feel the burn of alcohol. It really goes down easy though and that could be dangerous considering the ABV for me."
"Smooth to drink, but a thick body. Drinkable and sippable at the same time. Take your pick, this is good stuff."
"The taste comes with a initial sense of hoppiness that is then overwhelmed by the sense of sweetness. Alcohol is pretty well hidden by the sweetness, and the mouthfeel straddles a fine line between creaminess, sweetness, and hop bite. All in all pretty pleasant and pretty easy to drink for a 10%er (much like the hopslam I had in the same sitting). Worth checking out and pretty reasonably priced."
"The mouthfeel is heavy and sugary (Brown Shugga, duh) some alcohol hints but not too harsh. Overall a smooth tasting and complex beer."
"had this on tap at old chicago in uptown..and also have had it from bottle reviews is from tap serving which i preferred ..it came a beautiful auburn brown color with a minimal head and a beige ring with some sticky lacing..i had to let this ale warm as it was served to cold..as it warmed i could smell molasses and caramel and hops some brown sugar of course..the taste was not as good as the smell ..i got to much of an alcohol hit first then the citrus and molasses and all the b4 mentioned taste played to much of a secondary role..the ale was still solid ..maybe i drank it to cold to get all the layers of flavor ..again still a solid offering from langunitas.i just like maximus and hop stoopid better"
"Drinkability is relatively high. The flavor profile is pleasing which brings me back for more. The ABV is high, but well incorporated. I just dig this beer."
"Wow something must have blown up here with the recipe. Not sure if they were going for a Barlewyine or an IPA but it definitely has the hoppiness of an IPA and the chewiness of a barleywine. The result ... a gnarly beer that fights with you every sip and refuses to go down easily. A rare misstep for Laguinitas but a misstep indeed."
"Beer is medium to full bodied and completely sweet. I guess the name makes sense, since it tastes like sugar water. Drinkability is moderate and mouthfeel is fine. There is almost no bitterness I bet this beer is meant to sit on the shelf of some cellar for 10 years before its very drinkable. Yeah. That's what I think."
"The color is a deep amber/brownish with a small cap of sandy-colored foam. Pretty good retention with nice sheets of creamy lacing. The aroma is unsurprisingly sweet with a nice caramel, toffee, brown sugar quality with a subtle citrus note. I'd like to make an air freshener out of this. At any rate, the flavor is superb with a big, thick caramelized sugar note taking the lead. There's a sort of sweet, sticky toffee flavor that blends nicely with caramel, brown sugar and like a bright red fruity center. Not overly hoppy but there is definitely something there. The finish is nicely dry with citrus and pine flavors coming into the mix. The hops do a really good job of keeping the sweet malt flavors from cloying and keeps me wanting more. It's full-bodied with a nice warming quality but never feels overwhelming. I absolutely loved this beer. Probably one of the best experiences I've had with a beer in the past year. People who like big, malty beers should definitely check this one out but I'd recommend it to anybody. This is going to make it into my annual winter seasonal haul."
"Overall this certainly and interesting offering from Lagunitas and one that should be tried by fans of the style with a sweet-tooth. Thanks again Chuck for throwing this one in the box! Recommended."
"Pretty damn good and different...really tastes like an IPA with maple syrup."
"Very smooth drinker. Easy to wind up on the floor with this one. Nice light carbonation that complaments the texture of the beer well. Very big taste. Very sweet. Not very much to it in the way of complexity. Brown sugar, a little citrus-orange, and a nice bitterness."
"This is my first review... I liked this beer. It had a great pour, nice head in a red wine glass. some lacing, but not much. The first sip was awsomse. It is thick and has great flavor. the finish was bitter and had a it of pine taste to it. I could really feel the warmth in my belly when it hit bottom. The bitter lingered longer than I like. Overall a good beer for the price."
"D- It provides for pretty easy drinking, doesn't burn when it goes down, and if you like the unique taste then it's plausible that you drink this sucker all night."
"I like this, a lot. Another winner from Lagunitas, both in originality and in creating a satisfying drink."
"The flavors make for what would be a go-to IIPA while the abv does not. This proves that if executed correctly brown sugar can make play a part in good beer."
"Another surprise brew and this time for the positive. Nice!"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a small head. Smell is of hops and alcohol. Taste is very hoppy, some notes of sugar and alcohol. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a fairly decent brew."
"Overall I love when Lagunitas brings this beer out once a year and it's unique in it's own way. Check it out and you won't be disappointed with the experience."
"Notes: I love everything this beer is, and have never been let down by Lagunitas. This brew has a very 'fall season' feel; particularly the North East, where I live. It's apple smell mixed with the sweetness brings to mind Autumn. Next time I drink this - in the sniffer - I will be trying this beer with sliced apple and some sharp cheddar cheese."
"D - Drank way too well for such a high ABV beer. Nice and sweet with a good hop presence. Yes please, for dessert."
"So I guess this beer originated as a barleywine gone wrong. That describes the catch-all ""American Strong Ale"" designation as well as anything else I've ever heard, and this certainly bounces back and forth like a pinball between the bumpers of barleywine, American strong ale and Double IPA. Whatever it is, it's excellent, and highly recommended to enthusiasts of Stone's Bastard boys."
"D- Insanely drinkable at 9.84%, I can see the conparison to an American Barleywine. Highly recommended, I'm glad this is available in my neck of the woods."
"I think I may throw one of these under the stairs and see how it ages. that being said this is a good beer if your not afraid of something on the sweeter side, worth trying for sure"
"Amber orange pour. Slightly hazy. There's a rich malty aroma with citrusy notes as well. Taste is sweet initially with flavors of caramel and molasses, good roasted malt character and some lemony hop bitterness to round out the flavor. This coats the tongue easy and has a hearty mouthfeel. Satisfying without feeling too heavy. For a beer approaching 10% abv this is easy to drink. Lagunitas seems to be an approachable and affordable craft option."
"D - A rich, complex and interesting beer. A bit too rich to have too many but still a solid beer."
"D- This beer is phenomenal for a sweet lover, which I am. It's very surprisingly drinkable and tasty"
"(D)- A good beer with an interesting citrus kick. I wish I knew the age on this, cause it doesnt taste like its older due to how vibrant the citrus fruits are. Definitely would have this again though."
"The beer is surprisingly carbonated for an American Strong Ale, and the hop balance to all the sweetness creates a nice dry finish and interesting flavor combination. This reminds me of an aged big foot, definitely a lot sweeter, but the mouthfeel and body are similar for me. This is a beer I will not turn down in the future."
"The strong citrus grapefruit hops (Cascade, maybe) do well to balance the big sugary sweetness and this is a very unique and interesting beer with character that may not appeal to someone with expectations. I had two - but three might've given me the sickness..."
"d - I liked this one a lot. Can't believe it's over 9%. Could definitely drink a few of these taste-wise but might refrain due to the ABV. Definitely think it's worth checking out."
"M/D: Mild carbonation, and a fairly smooth, but the finish is what makes this not particularly great here. A little too bitter for my taste."
"D: A bit high in alcohol. Very nice hop presence and the brown sugar stickiness is a definite asset."
"Drinkability: well, I like it, but with its malt-bombiness and its high ABV, it's definitely not a session one for me. I might split a sixpack three ways, though."
"Flavor is citrusy hops with a subtle sweet malt back. Alcohol is deceptivley hidden. Watch out because it sneaks up on you."
"A great seasonal brew, DEFINITELY try this out if you have the chance. AT LEAST once!!!"
"Drinkability: This is not a beer that one would drink a whole six pack in a sitting. Well, you could, I just wouldn't go anywhere afterwards. It's a perfect beer for cold, howling, brittle, winter nights."
"Drinkability is fantastic. The high ABV is almost undetected while showcasing its flavor."
"Lagunitas Brown Shugga was recommended to me by Nate over at Martys in Newton. For some reason the name of this beer always struck me as gimmicky, but oh well. The color is copper, and has a small amount of mildly tan head. The nose is a good bit hoppier than I was expecting. I do get a bit of brown sugar in the smell, along with some caramel and grain. Taste is again, hoppy, with some mint leaf, and a really raw earth character. Body is medium to heavy, and leaves a very bitter aftertaste. Drinkability is hindered a bit simply by the fact that this beer is complicated. As I was told at the store, this is a challenging one. On the bright side, the 9.84 ABV can barely be detected. Maybe not among the best from Lagunitas, but certainly interesting and worth a shot. Cheers"
"D- great considering the relatively high abv- showing that not all strong ales have to hit you like double bass pedals, i.e. Stone"
"Great beer!"
"Drinkability - Not even a hint of alcohol, I could easily consume a few bottles of this and probably get pretty drunk at the abv. I wouldn't care though, it is almost refreshing for it's abv and style and I would definitely reach for another if I had one. I will be getting more."
"D: Drinkability is definitely a highlight of this one, have to watch it though, as the 9.8% abv could bring some ill effects after more than a few of these..."
"Pours a caramel/amber color with a good size off white creamy head, and good lacing. Smell is sweet malty brown sugar, caramel, chocolate, oranges & cream, with a some citrusy hops. Taste is sweet with lots of caramel malt, brown sugar, and oranges up front with a slightly citrusy hop bitterness on the end. Kind of leaves of oranges & cream aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel, easy drinker. Overall this is a great beer."
"This is a thinking man's beer. You have to try to appreciate each sip and swirl it around in your mouth and mind...will not turn this down!"
"Conclusion: Here finally is a Lagunitas brew that really, really impresses me."
"D: Way too drinkable and at near 10%, this ones dangerous. Alcohol is hidden very well so read your labels kids."
"Reviewed on: 12-29-2009"
"Pours a beautiful deep reddish amber color with small, rapidly fading head that leaves some lace on the glass. Smell is quite sweet, with some of the brown sugar coming to play with citrus hops. Pleasant, though. Taste is not overwhelmingly hoppy or malty, but a nice balance of both. Lightly roasted malt kicks things off here followed by a moderate bitter kick from some hops, fading into a lingering piney and somewhat smokey flavor. Very interesting, not nearly as sweet as I would have expected--was thinking this was gonna be like DFH 90 in the sweetness dept. Very interesting flavor, akin in ways to both English and American Barleywines. Thick and coating, the MF on this one is great, very smooth and full-bodied. It says not to sip this one on the bottle, and I damn well could get away with not sipping this one. Nice work from Lagunitas, I have to explore this brewery further."
"Poured a clear copper color with a fluffy white head. fainter than expected nose, some definite sweetness going on, but the hops were definitely there as well. I was expecting a much sweeter taste at first, but then I reminded this is a west coast barley wine, and should be treated as such. very sweet malts up front, the brown sugar is there and the hops take control of the lingering flavor. The mouthfeel is phenomenal on this one. velvety smooth. This was a great beer, but I feel as though it should be cellared for a few years to mull the hop flavor a bit. Definitely pick this one up if you see it."
"D- This is pretty fun to drink with the variety of flavors, and the near 10%ABV(hidden well) doesn't hurt either. Drink this in moderation."
"Dark brown body, 3/4 finger tan head, nice lacing. Huge sweetness in the nose which masks the hops. Taste is sweet, with some roasted malts present, a bit too syrupy for me. Not the most drinkable of beers at this ABV and sweetness, though I must note two years of cellaring mellowed out the alcohol quite a bit. A definite late night sipper. Not for the faint of heart."
"This beer is so drinkable for the gravity and is is smooth on the back-end making one down a glass faster than one should. My only problem with this easy drinking beer is the slight alcohol bite at the end dings it a little on the drinkability. I actually think that alcohol presence is needed otherwise I'd down too many of these in too fast of time. If Lagunitas could come up with same taste profile in a sessionable strength then I would be all over that."
"good but way too high of an ABV and way too much sugar."
"I first tried this beer last year thanks to an old co-worker from Starbucks. By far his favorite winter beer. And now has become one of mine. I am starting to look forward to seeing it on the shelves every winter now. For those who are not familiar with this beer. It started out as a rushed recipe for their Gnarly Wine ale. But as most rushed things go it took a turn off course, so they added mass amounts of brown sugar to try to speed up the fermentation process. The end result turned out to be this great winter beer. I would not recommend this to anyone who is not use too how a barley wine should taste. But for those who enjoy a good barley wine give this a try at least once."
"Drinkability: A solid beer that is one per sitting for the high abv. As stated above the sweetness really comes out as the beer warms. I will look for this again."
"M/D - I enjoyed this brew quite a bit, a brew I can drink throughout the night. I medium bodied brew that is sweet and smooth, but dry at the end, a good well rounded brew in my opinion. I will for sure have again. Another seasonal so stock up if you can find it."
"Poured from the bottle into a tumbler. Pours a reddish-brown-copper with little head that dissipates quickly to crown the beer. Definite sweet aromas of malts and sugar with some hoppy citrus (grapefruit) aromas as well. Taste is very sweet and the citrus flavors along with pine dominate the flavors. Feels rather light really compared to my expectation and the carbonation is rather light as well. A good drinking beer that could be pretty sessionable if not for the alcohol content."
"Oh this truly be a great beer. Brown Shugga is brewed with just that-- brown sugar, about 2 lbs per barrel I was told. Thats the first thing that hit me about his beer, the thick molasses feel of it and the sweet taste. The aroma is almost as intoxicating as the beer (over 10% ABV) and while it is one of the better beers I've ever tasted I could not drink too much of it in a night, mainly because its so sweet ad so strong."
"Poured with a great head fading to a pretty persistent lace. Good dark copper hue. The nose is pretty amazing with lots of sweet malts, hops, molasses and hints of brown sugar and banana. Tastes like an unsweetened bananas foster. Lots of caramel, brown sugar, molasses, banana, while the alcohol works well (like the brandy in bananas foster). The hops do come through, especially on the finish, giving it a drier profile. Simply a great beer and one I wish was available year round."
"D - An interesting offering from Lagunitas that hides its almost 10% ABV very well. One or two of these are definitely enough, but its quite a nice winter sipper."
"A very enjoyable beer, and surprisingly drinkable at 9.5% abv."
"D - A decent beer that could be better if the alcohol were toned down a bit."
"Drink is good. ABV is very well hidden. The heavily sweetness with the bright background of hops just make this an amazing drink. Drink up folks."
"Lagunitas seems to be the hopheads brewery. I thought this would be, not really sweeter because it's sweet, but maybe less hoppy. Awesome stuff that'll sneak up on you if you aren't careful."
"Overall, another solid offering from Lagunitas. Every beer they make has that ""Lagunitas"" hoppy feel to it, and this one is no exception. I would be able to peg this as a Lagunitas brew in a blind tasting no problem."
"D = I don't know about this one, I do not find either the taste or the smell overly enticing and the ABV while not too strong is present. I really didn't particularly want to finish the whole glass and don't really want another. That said, it is not really hard to drink either, just not my cup of tea."
"D - Good but has too much bitter aftertaste."
"Kind of a juxtaposition of flavours, exuding some barleywine, DIPA, and brown ale characteristics."
"A clear bronze/amber color with a moderate sized tan head , light carbonation , spotty lacing. Aroma of caramel malt , brown shuggar , floral and citrus hops and a pale malt of some kind . Flavor is quite sweet up front with some nice floral, pine and citrus hops , medium bitterness some caramel, burnt shuggar and broun shugger , full body with a slightly oily mouthfeel , a slightly alcoholic finish , very drinkable and good , a very good value and a good brew all around ."
"Sugar sweet with a hop bite to keep this from being to surupy, thick and rich. Alcohol is hidden very well I was suprised to see it at such a high abv. Could pound several of these if I wasn't being carfull."
"D: Quite a kick to this beer. Nice flavor, but it is strong. Kind of limits the drinkability a little. I would definitely recommend the beer but not more than a few in one sitting."
"I want to see what one of these would taste like in a year or two, problem is they won't stay in my house that long because i can't stop drinking the damn things!"
"Drinkability - Quite drinkable, especially when considering the intensity of flavors. A very interesting, different beer."
"D - This beer sounds all to good but is just way too sweet for my palate. Definately a big beer, but very sweet and the hops are super bitter making for a very dry piney finish. Too Sweet and Too Bitter, if that makes sense"
"d - definitely a big beer that doesn't disguise that fact, fairly harsh on the palate, not all that interesting or complex for a big beer, glad this comes in 12oz versus 22oz bottles, too bad it's in six-packs"
"Drinkability, well, its good for one or two, but I wouldnt want to drink them all night. Still a a good drinkability though considering its 9.83 abv."
"D: Again, this beer is unashamedly big, and it would be difficult to drink too many of these. A very surprising, unique, and very enjoyable beer from Lagunitas."
"Drinkability: Sits a little heavy and is a bit too hot for too much of it, and the sweetness from the matls gets a litlte rough on the tummy; but overall, it's a really good beer and I'll gladly have another at another time."
"Overall: I will say its a strong offering from what i've seen as of now to be a pretty legit brewery in their offerings. I almost put off the review because I was savoring the beer outright with this one because its a familiar yet distinct flavor of its own."
"Would I buy more of it? - yep, already have plans to pick up some more for when the real cold hits."
"Overall a decent beer, maybe for dessert. A bit too sweet to have more than one."
"Drinkability: Way too sweet. Almost a dessert beer. Hops allow it to balance somewhat but overall too sweet for my taste"
"Pours a beautiful clear dark reddish amber with a yellowish-tan fine-bubbled head. Aroma is hoppy and has a citrus undertone. Mouth-filling hoppy flavor has a firm hint of citrus, mainly lemon and orange, and is not too bitter. Texture is rough, lively and fizzy."
"O- Awesome beer, there is almost no hint of the alcohol content. Need to try the oaked version. Only complaint is that the aroma doesn't shine as much as the taste does."
"All in all an okay beer."
"d - great and definitely a one of a kind beer."
"Its not as good as Hop Stoopid or their Pale, but its in good company with all their others. . ."
"Nice pour, great tiny little beige-vanilla bubbles to top the ruby crimson head. The smell is all caramel, vanilla, brown sugar and HOPS! I love this beer already and haven't even tasted it. More caramel malt in the taste, big time malt backbone and somehow this beer almost balances the huge malt profile with just as much of a hop kick. Mucho caramel, tangerine from the hops, light almond cherry character and even jammed figs. This beer has a nice, fluffy, delicate mouthfeel while being moderately heavy and very satisfying. Outstanding caramelized, brown shuggary Imperial IPA/strong ale/barleywine/holiday ale/old ale. Another top notch complex offering from a top notch brewery."
"THis is a tasty brew. The alcohol is quite well hidden, offering a smooth sipper. The nice balance between the bitter hops and the sweet brown sugar work well. This is a wonderful cold weather drink."
"Had 2 of these while watching football on Sunday. The first one I thought was kinda sweet, although had a ton of flavor. Great color and mouth feel. I took a brake and had an IPA and then went back for the second one .. still the Eagles game wasn't on .. anyway, after the IPA the Shugga took on a whole new flavor. Great caramel flavor with just the right amount of carbonation. More hoppy than I remembered .. a well balanced brew. One of those brews that one just won't do justice."
"I thought this stuff was seven percent when I had it last. I think ten percent is a bit high for this sweet style of beer but Lagunitas pulls it off making this very easy to drink and not a chore. The sweetness while big is settled nicely by a nice west coast hop blasting. I drank it much faster than I thought I would."
"D- Easily able to consume a 12oz bottle and I wouldn't have an issue putting down a 22oz bomber or even 2 or 3 12oz bottles. I can see this going pretty good with the upcoming thanksgiving dinner."
"D- I blasted through a 12oz bottle of this nectar. The massively sweet character of this beer is exceptionally balanced by hops, and the nearly 10% ABV is really well-hidden. This is one of my new favorites from Lagunitas."
"They say this was a barley wine gone wrong, and so a ton of brown sugar was added to the recipe. I get hints of the barleywine characteristics, but not much of the brown sugar. This beer confuses me."
"Drinkability:I've been fairly impressed with most Lagunitas brews I've found. The way the hops are delivered through them are right up my alley. I'd probably have another one of these down the road. Pleasantly suprised with this one considering I was expecting some overly sweetened novelty brown sugar loaded brew. I'd definitely like to enjoy a bomber of this thing some time again."
"Notes: sweet copper ale with some great hop flavor"
"Poured into a pint glass dark amber with a nice one and a half off white head. Great lacing all the way down the glass. The nose on this is very strong of malted barley, almost compareable to a barley wine in scent. There's also a floral hop scent mixed in with it. The taste is very malt intensive. There's just a slight hint of hops at first but it quickly changes to a very brown sugar and carmel wallop. The mouthfeel is good, no noticable alcohol burn for a 9.8'er. The sugary overload of this beer really does make it's drinkability a little hard to take."
"sweet malt background"
"Drinkability: One a day would do the trick for a happy hop head that also loves sweet malt. Less alcohol would make me go back to this beer more often."
"[edit] Not sure what happened here but after the first beer of this I have not liked the beer since."
"Overall this is a great beer. More balanced then i thought it was going to be. This isnt a beer i would like to put much age on. The best part of the beer is the balance and i think with the fresh hops this beer really shines. Without the hop balance, this one would be sweet mess. This sixer is fresh and tremendously good!! I'm glad i have 5....oopss 4 more left!"
" This is a great Holiday beer. Thanks Lagunitas!"
"Mouth is medium bodied with a touch too much carbonation. Dry finish and a cloying nature of this beer just leaves the flavor in you mouth. Creates a distinct warming behind your ears. Drinks fairly easy but I couldn't slam more than a few. Would be great around a fireplace, or out on a cold night."
"D: A sipper for sure, it is a regular staple in my fridge door when I can get it."
"My first time trying this fine ale. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle in a tulip shaped fest beer glass. Appears amber copper color very appealing. A slow pour resulted in little head retained. Floral hoppy smell, certainly sweet aroma. Prune like dark candied fruit, molasses, fig like brown sugary flavor are a few flavors I could spot. Some fresh hoppy flavor does exist. Mouthfeel is certainly lighter than I had imagined making this a pretty drinkable ale in my thinking."
"drinkability: very flavorful and a well masked high abv. this one is very sessionable for 10 bucks a six pack."
"D - This stuff is good and for being 9.5% its way too easy to drink most strong ales don't get me excited but I really enjoyed this one worth getting to try"
"Mmmm, first are the dark fruits and the rich sweet malt, which underlies all the other flavors very nicely. The hops and citrus come in second with a bitter edge that mixes well with the sweetness. Towards the end of the profile is a second helping of a sugar cookie like malt with the heat from the alcohol only a little masked. This being said, the booze character brings no heat, just warmth. Mouth feel is think and delicious. A great beer that's opened my eyes to the strong ale."
"Poured a hazy brown with a tiny head that rapidly faded to a skin. The aroma was citrus The taste was malty sweet with little citrus hop backbone. However, and I have rarely (never) described taste this way, Shugga' tasted flat and heavy. The feel was full bodied with little carbonation. Drinkability was good. It still wasn't bad, but the heavy/flat sensation did affect my opinion of the flavor."
"This beer sits heavy, but the mouth feel certainly is not. That's thanks to a heavy carbonation, but not noticeably so. It's necessary to sift through this brew. Warms the throat and leaves an aftertaste of... everything on the front of the tongue."
"D - A very aggressive brew that makes no attempt to hide it's 9.5% ABV... A serious sipper... Elegant and sophisticated... A wonderful offering from the folks at Lagunitas... This is a wonderful beer to sit back and relax with after a long hard day... Love it... I really don't want this glass to ever end..."
"Pretty good, but I expected something a bit better."
"Poured a hazy reddish orange with a frothy, foamy white head, small amount of sticking. Aromas of fruity esters, melted brown sugar, a light caramel and a mild pine resiny. Moderate carbonation and a softly crisp, creamy smooth medium bodied mouthfeel. Pleasant tasting, brown sugar and caramel, a sour citric fruity, a herbal hoppiness, a light alcohol flavor shows up towards the end and a sour citric, oily and malty finish with a slight warming alcohol taste lingering in the palate."
"Brown malts, boozy, creamy body with a good dose of grassy bitterness from the hops. Not the best strong brown ale I've come across, but it works. Crisp, well-carbonated medium-thick body that lays a heavy blow of booze to the stomach. A little too dry on the finish for all those hops, but this is still a tasty beer and I'm glad I have another 5 Brown Shugga's to go around."
"D- This one really delivers and is certainly one of Lagunitas best. Great sipper."
"I am going to be honest with myself and all of you reading this. If it were not for an inner battle of self control this sixer would have been gone in a night. Far too easy drinking and massively enjoyable. While this may not be on any ""best beer"" list it is certainly a favorite."
"This one has the typical Lagunitas hop profile but the additional sweetness of the malts and sugar seem to do wonders for this one. Very good stuff."
"Mouth feel is bold, body is fairly thick and the beer is very smooth with the slightest amount of carbonation"
"D: This beer is under control. Nothing extreme, but everything just right. I really enjoyed it."
"Went down very easy for almost 10%. You don't even notice the alcohol. Even with the sweetness of the malt and the overll sweet nature, the hops balance this perfectly. Great beer."
"drinkability: a solid beer as lagunitas always does. One of the most consistant breweries out there. At forst I was liek wow, but as it went on the sweetness bothered me."
"In short, it makes Arrogant Bastard look like liquified dog sh*t - buy it on sight."
"D - Well, it becomes a bit much after awhile, but up to that point it's pretty drinkable. No problem finishing a bottle."
"Silky mouth with low levels of carbonation. This was a slow end of night type of beer. Glad I had a chance to try it."
"You can read this beer by it's cover. Pours deep brown, caramel color with a lot of 'stuff' going on inside. Disappointingly thin head, not a whole lot of lacing going on. Aroma let's you know what you're in for, a whole lot of sweetness. Once you adjust, this one is really delicious if you have a sweet tooth. Feels good in the mouth, but not a beer I'd buy for a length session."
"mid to full body. not a great deal of carbonation. not a bad beer. hard for me to drink to many due to the sweetness and the alcohol. but this is good going down."
"Drinkability- It was a pretty good beer. Definitely a winter beer , will drink it again most likely in winter"
"D: I just found myself enjoying Hairy Eyeball much more. This isn't a bad beer, but when the brewery offers a much better product in the same category, for the same price... *shrug*"
"Bottle from Irishboy. A deep tan pour with some haze. Head is beige and leaves spotty lace. Nose of pit fruits, lots of caramel malts, demerera, citrus, dark bread. Tastes of woody brown sugar, citric hops and rye bread crust, butterscotch, caramel, plum, sweet candy. Sticky and sweet finish with a slight hop bite towards the end. Has mellowed out nicely with some time on it. Thanks Richard!"
"A little too sweet for my tastes this is an ok winter sipper but there are numerous beers of the style that I would drink first. It was recently cloned on Jamil's show, which got me interested agian, but it is really too sticky a beer to drink too often."
"Aggressive head on the pour, settles into a two finger cream white mix of mostly tiny bubbles, pleasant thin lacing, very slow to dissolve down to the liquid surface. Curiously penetrating nose, although most of the components are ""sweet"" in nature it drives up into your nostrils. Scents of molasses crisp, toffee, caramelized brown sugar, white grape, cherry and pear fruit cushion the nose, however, there's a formidable burst of grapefruit citrus, hay and grass as well, not a sugar bomb but any stretch. In the mouth it's medium-bodied with carbonation which fits the whole, more bitter or astringent feel here without being offputting. The butterscotch, honey, molasses coating mostly during the first few seconds before tangerine, white grapefruit and sourdough bread show up. Some banana alongside the grape, pear, apricot, cherry fruit, not that fruity overall. Gets smokier and more of a roasted chocolate dust edge near the finish. One of this beer's more intriguing aspects is the interplay between the innate sweetness and the other elements."
" swallow and"
"I accidentally dumped a glass of this in my dresser drawer thereby turning it into a Brown Shugga sea with little sock and underwear islands. I'm hoping it comes out."
"D: Very good beer and dangerously easy to drink. That 9.5% hit me sooner than I thought. Would happily have it again, and hope to have it again soon."
"D - Immensely enjoyable. I'm interested to see what sort of a hop profile this beer has when it's fresh, but as it is it's still very flavorful and complex. The alcohol is fairly conspicuous on the palate, and yet it's still very easy to drink."
"Had a bottle that was sitting in the cellar for about 6 months. I was actually surprised by how much I liked this beer. I reminded me more of an old ale or barleywine for the rich malt and biting hops, but it's all good. This beer was tasty. The flavor has a mix of tart cherry, caramel, toffee, and raisins, all with a hint of molasses. The medium body was a little more drinkable than your average 10% American beer, and I wouldn't mind having another. Certainly one of my favorite Lagunitas beers."
"Feel is heavy but not slick, very enjoyable before bed but could not have many more, this is a have one and move on type. Not to say I won't buy again."
"Overall: The mouth feel is heavy and slightly carbonated. The body of the beer is thick and the finish lingers for a few moments. This beer will sneak up on you and kick you in the butt. The alcohol flavor is there but not dominating. The beer has a great flavor and is easy to drink . When I drink strong ale beers, I expect the beer to have a well rounded flavor and is not overly alcoholy. Good job, this the first beer from Lagunitas and I like was I am tasting."
"Mouthfeel is crisp, but a tad spritzy. Flavor is of sweet molasses, brown sugar, tart apples, and finishes bitter. A dull bitter this one is. Reminds me of a barleywine for sure. Drinkability is low, because this is just too sweet and too weird. This is a strange strong ale. Glad I tried it, but I won't be back anytime soon."
"12 ounce bottle served at the Flat Rock Saloon and poured into a standard shaker glass. Appears a hazed amber brown color akin to pale dry ginger ale with two fingers of dense ecru foam. Smells and tastes of molasses, caramelized malts, brown sugar (of course), a touch of hoppy bitterness. This ale is, without a doubt, rather sweet. But, for some reason, it works really well here. Every flavor plays off of each other nicely. Falls somewhere between medium and full bodied with ample carbonation. A different twist on a strong ale that's certainly worth a try."
"Despite my personal concerns over the body/mouthfeel of this brew, it's deliciously drinkable. Damned if I can find the 9%+ABV in here, BTW. Very balanced and smooth and easy drinking. Lagunitas, please send me more (since I can't buy your products in my state)."
"This is my first beer from Lagunitas, it was very interesting. I'll be looking for more."
"The mouthfeel is the only major flaw in this brew. It is really thin, and not so good."
"D - Very nice...not one that you can drink a ton of, but something that I will definitely look for again"
"My favorite offering to date from Lagunitas and one I'll seek out again."
"Extremely drinkable, despite the hefty 9.9% ABV, and quite desireable as well. It's a sipper, no doubt, but a very pleasurable one. Any essence of brown sugar is obviously hiding in with the malt underneath the hops, but it takes away from nothing. Quite superb."
"A real tasty beverage. I have been less than impressed with Lagunitas previous to this beer. But this one gives me some respect for them, and makes me want more of their beer, and that certainly includes this example. A keeper."
"Overall, this beer is a solid example of a big American strong ale/barleywine. One every once in a while when I need a break from IPA's in fine for me."
"D - Far to drinkable, I will look for it again and should like to have it on tap."
"American strong ale? Hmmm...I'm not sure about that. I'd say it drinks like a barleywine and a well balanced and tasty one at that. If I'm not drinking beer, I am partial to Knob Creek Manhattans, and boy, this bowled me over on the first sip. Boozy? A bit, but it really hides the ABV. A very nice surprise from a brewery that is good at giving pleasant ones."
"Lagunitas Brown Shugga' is a very clear amber ale with a thin sand-colored head that fades. It has a malty, somewhat medicinal, aroma. It is medium bodied; smooth and syrupy with a sticky finish. It's sweet on the lips and then becomes pretty bitter. There is a wood resin flavor present. The finish is long and boozy. I think I expected something sweeter and more malt-focused, but this is OK."
"Pours an orangey-brown color with a decent off-white head. Aromas of alcohol, malts, brown sugar (obviously), and caramel. Mouth-feel is sticky-sweet and thick, coats the palate well. Initial tastes are alcohol, caramel, brown sugar, with hints of fruits such as plums, and vanilla. As it warms, the true flavors come out. More of a hop bite adds to the sweet finish and really aids the balance nicely. Overall, this is a unique ale that I enjoyed. I would recommend it and I probably have it again."
"D- I love this ""mistake"" it grows on me the more I drink it. A fine barleywine it is. I know its say strong ale up above but since it was an accidental brewing of their Gnarley wine I would have to think that's what it is. Either way seek this out and enjoy!"
"Pours a hazy, dark amber color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of hops first, then sweet malt, alcohol, brown sugar, and finally some slight banana aromas. Fits the style of an American Strong Ale. Mouth feel is very smooth and thick with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops up front, then sweet malt, then brown sugar, strong alcohol throughout, and finally some slight fruit/belgian yeast flavors. Overall, a really smooth brew that packs a punch - good palate and nice blend of flavors."
"This one's nice if you're looking for an example of a sweeter beer that's not overbearingly sweet and is just a good example of a fine craft beer beside. Even though alcohol is near 10%, it doesn't hit you until afterwards and isn't harsh in the brew. When it does hit, it's more peaceful than anything."
"D: Like I said, the heebie-jeebies a little bit. I hope I didn't get a slightly bad bottle, but I don't want more after this."
"Quite the interesting brew and a complex companion with the roasted turkey and various zesty cheese and bean options I had throughout today's session. Goes great with a sap boil, but it'd be a fine pickup anytime between Thanksgiving and St. Patrick's Day."
"Very easy to drink with this ABV."
"Taste is immediately very sweet and then a rich hop presence takes charge. Hops are citrus, earthy, and deep. Pretty good balance for such powerful flavors. Easy drinking in spite of the alcohol content. Has an almost barleywine character on the palate. Nice beer but not very sessionable due to 9.5%abv."
"Not something I would drink alot of."
"Wow, this is a great beer. Not what I expected based on the beer name and color. Color is a rich brown. A lot more hops than I expected. I can barely taste the alcohol which was shocking based on the strength. The beer is really well balanced and keeps you guessing, you look at it and think Newcastle, you smell it and the molasses and sugar are there but there is a hop aroma that you don't expect. . . you taste it and, at first, it reconfirms the smell as the hops and flowers pervade, but then the finish is rounded off with some nice malts and sweetness .. .then the hops reappear again a few seconds later. Beer is well carbonated and could use a bit more body. A bit of a schizophrenic beer but one that I would buy again."
"D - Large and dominant, would not hold up for a night."
"This is a decent holiday beer for those cold winter nights."
"Interesting beer. Glad I tried it. This would be a great holiday beer to share with others."
"everything about this beer is pretty standard for it's style, except the particular sweetness it has. Pours out a nice medium amber and stays that way in the glass. little head on pour, good agitating pour at that, and doesn't retain much but a small ring around the outside. The cane sugar added gives it a nice sweetness that I enjoyed. It's not as sweet as Old Foghorn, which is good for me. Definitely can drink more than one without a second thought. I enjoyed it pretty thoroughly, and after three I can feel the residual bitterness on the sides of my tongue!"
"D: I could only imagine drinking 1 or 2 of these, but it would be good with a hearty meal."
"D: A pretty decent brew, although I don't know if I'd really go for more than one within a sitting. I keep see picking it from time to time, maybe it'd be better on tap."
"D - A superb offering from Lagunitas. Ultimately I could've used a little more complexity and coherence with the taste (and a little more hidden alcohol) but overall this is a unique and more than worthy brew."
"It gets a notch down in drinkability due to the prominence of the alcohol in flavor and richness, which pushes it closer to a sipper and would make it more difficult to consume many. This one is best left for a slow journey with a nice read."
"D: I wouldn't drink a whole lot, its entirely too sweet. I'm glad I revisited it though, as it is better than I remember it. Not a bad beer. I'd recommend it."
"D 3.5 - interesting brew w/ high ABV, not a session brew, it's a bit hoppier than expected, gives a nice cover up to the ABV. I would try it again, but it's not a regular!"
"Mouthfeel is almost cloying from the sweetness and really is the only category this beer suffers. Otherwise a very tasty beverage."
"Not one of my favorites from Lagunitas. It took 3 weeks to kill the sixer."
"Bottle purchased in Buffalo and poured into a snifter. I'm presented with an amber body and a generous tan head, which gradually faded to a small film and gave up some lace. The appearance reminds me very much of a barleywine. The aroma is wonderfully perfumed, full of fruity malts, caramel and citrus. The flavour reminds me of a nice barleywine - dark fruit and alcohol, but with a sweet, caramelized brown sugar touch. In other ways, it also reminds me of a malt heavy double IPA, as there's a decent citric bitterness rounding things off. The body was decent and carbonation fairly restrained, but I do feel it would have benefited from being a touch heavier and chewier."
"When I saw the name ""Brown Shugga", I was thinking maybe a strong brown ale. Obviously, an old ale is not that. With that said, I thought it was an alright old ale. I do like my old ales, but this one was just above average for me. Nothing really stood out in it, just that the appearance was nice."
"This beer poured a purple-ish brown with a very small head and some visible carbonation. The smell is sweetness that seems to be half malt and half brown sugar and a bit of hops. The beer has a sweetness from the sugar and malt that is balanced very well by the ops, with everything hitting at once and a little bit of the brown sugar coming out in backend as well. The high ABV is hidden quite well, I would have guessed it was way less than that. The mouthfeel is slightly thick and slick with a tiny bit of warming from the alcohol. This is a surprisingly drinkable beer for what it is, the surprisingly balanced but aggressive hops and the high ABV should have made for a much heavier-sitting beer. Definitely worth a try, I'm glad I grabbed a bottle."
"I also heard that this was a failed barley wine...not positive, but plausible."
"Notes: Everyone must try this beer!"
"Still though, the sweetness is kind of overpowering and I definitely would have trouble polishing of a few of these back to back (aside from the fact that I would be stone cold hammered if I did). Otherwise, a great beer."
"D: This is a real good beer. I could drink quite a few, with the ABV being high, not sure I could drink a lot....oh, yes I could."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. The color is a deep, clear amber with a sticky white head. On the nose is burnt brown shugga' and a hint of orange marmalade. The taste follows the nose, and that is a good thing. The flavors are sweet and phenolic with weak citrus notes. Brown Shugga is medium bodied and easy drinking. I first had this at a festival and the server described it as a Barley wine, but I agree with BA it fits better in the strong ale category. This beer is very enjoyable."
"Feels thick but not sticky. Although this monster is nearly 10%, it's easily drinkable."
"D: A unique and exciting beer. I haven't had consistent Lagunitas experiences, so I'm especially glad to have picked up this brew. Definitely a favorite. It also doesn't hurt that there's a a puppy on every label."
"I would say this beer is extremely drinkable. There is no flavor that exceeds the average craft beer drinking palate. I would say that if you like a strong hop flavor you should drink this fresh, but if you would rather have the malty sweet flavors drink this with 6 months to a year on it. If I had 2 I'd age one for a year."
"It isn't that this was a bad beer, I would probably not choose to purchase it again however."
"6/4/6/3/14 (3.3/5)"
"Sweet sugar goodness! For those brown ale fans, this is a fun one...if the gold standard is Sam Smith, this is in the discussion. It's a beautiful brown pour, very strong in alcohol...I would limit the consumption with a nice session beer behind it.."
"Full-bodied with light carbonation, the brew is a silky-smooth sipper, and tastes great, just like a young girl should. Yeah, yeah, yeah... WOOO!"
"This is a thick, full bodied beer, very sweet, very sticky, but loaded with very nice oily and estery hops that are delightful. There is a very thick, sweet, caramelized maltiness, there is a warming booziness, but liqueur like sweet. The joy in this beer is that the piney and estery hop balances so well against the sweet, but slightly boozy caramel and candied malts. The two complement each other so well that this is not a harsh hop biting beer nor is it a over the top ABV beer with a throaty burn. The beer is a sipper, but this is well worth seeking out."
"i can certainly echo everything in the previous posts and reviews of this beer - i really like brown shugga - an excellent brew for all the reasons previously posted - my sixpack of 12oz squat bottles appears to have screw caps - i find them impossible to unscrew by hand, even with one of those kitchen drawer rubber grip bottle opening things - removing the cap with an opener reveals that there are indeed screw threads on the neck of the bottle - perhaps the high malt/shugga content has welded the thread interface tight with heavy molasses-like sugars - all the more fun to get at the prized liquid -"
"D- I thought it was a good ale. I actually want to pair it with some BBQ. ""yummm i bet it will be awesome."" With the higher abv I wouldnt put it into a session type beer but 2 or 3 would be ok."
"This was a surprisingly drinkable beer considering the high IBU and ABV. The balance between the bitterness and the sweetness is very unique for me. Poured into a Pilsner Glass left it with a nice frothy head with a strong lace. I can find absolutely nothing wrong with this beer."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. I like that it is still balanced slightly toward the sweetness. It is not a beer that I would drink a lot of, but it is pretty tasty and this is the last beer that I bought from a 6-pack. I don't regret that purchase, so you may want to try one too."
"12 oz bottle. Hardy copper/amber pour with a nearly non-existant white head. Non-descript hops with slight malt and brown sugar aroma. Flavor dominated by hops, not overly bitter, just overly present. Not sure how anyone could get sweet out of this. I want to sit and disect this but it's just an IPA with some brown sugar. Clean finish sure, drinkability good especially for the abv. Probably great if you're a straight hop head. The base of the beer tastes like EVERY SINGLE other beer I've had from Lagunitas. Malt and roast are just too words they don't like to incorporate. It's like they just keep taking their IPA and adding different small items and calling it a different named Strong Ale. Everybody is always so high on this brewer and I guess I just don't get it. West Coast bitter beer, the thought being this is crisp and clean and organic in some instances. Rambled enough. I was unimpressed with this and will age 1 but look to donate the other 4 I have. Even their capuccino stout was just a heavy brown. Ok, now I'm done."
"Delicious."
"D - A great ale- I enjoy it immensely, it was a pleasant nightcap for me. I could possibly handle a couple or a bomber but on this night one was plenty which is my reasoning for only above average here. This is not a boring beer - Brown Shugga: ""how come you taste so good?"""
"I had to switch to a lighter beer after this one because of the high alcohol content. The taste was pleasing, but heavy, and I felt like I needed some refreshment after drinking it."
"D: Dangerous, I think. My friend said she could taste the alcohol, but I thought it was pretty well masked. At least according to the server, the abv is actually 12% which, if true, is even more impressive given the lack of alcohol taste and the often overly sweet concomitant flavor."
"Pours a light golden reddish brown with a nice head and thick clumpy lacing. Smells of sweet dry honey and a nice little balance of smoothness and bitterness from the hops. The strong ABV hidden well. Definitely an enjoyable beer, would likely get another if available, but not going out of my way to track this down."
"I got two of them, because I liked it so much, but that's really the ceiling for me as it is a deceptively strong beer. Definitely worth the little extra it costs, and a very enjoyable beer."
"Great before bed beer, but make sure you brush your teeth as that sugar blast will definitely do damage ;)!"
"D: Probably too drinkable. I had to go fast, unfortunately, and it went down smooth as you please."
"Overall, this brew is on and off. At puts this may be a high quality brew and at others times, just plain average. I really enjoyed the infusion of sugar cane, which offered a unique taste. Recommended."
"A fine beer on a cold winter's night."
"This to me was only slightly better than the Hairy Eyeball Ale. In fact I would say these to beers are nearly identical except for two things. The Brown Shugga has higher alcohol content but it is hidden better with the flavor and so it is not as offputting. Also, there seems to be a bit more molasses or brown sugar used and a bit less dried fruit which makes it slightly more balanced."
"M/D: Medium body thats flavor lingers in your mouth with great aftertaste. For being 9.9% it is masked beautifully in this strong ale. It is easy to drink."
"D: what the devil! why have I not had this before? I have found new favorite to add to the list, sheer wonder in a bottle. Without a doubt one of my favorite strong ales to this date"
"Although I enjoyed this one, it was a bit sweet for me to have more than one or two."
"Nice medium mouthfeel, medium carb. A very easy drinking ""bigger"" beer. I approve."
"Mouth: Pretty similar to the aroma; grapefruit with maple syrup is the dominant flavor. There's some bitterness, astringency, and alcohol too. Medium full body, substantial ( and maybe a bit much) carbonation. Average drinkability."
"D-Very drinkable, in its complexity and ease of consumption. This is an interesting beer with strong hop character and bitterness, balanced well by the smooth malt flavors, with a hint of something wild with the brown sugar mixed in."
"Smells of malts; I almost get a slight hint of gingerbread - but maybe it is imaginary. Taste is sweet and of molasses and vanilla. Hops are pleasant and provide balanced bitterness. I was expecting this brew to be a whopper, it was quite pleasant and very easy to drink. Not something I would drink on a regular basis, but I know lots of people who would really love this stuff."
"Drinkability is also good for the style but high ABV hinders it somewhat."
"D: Where is the 9.9%? Wait, I feel it now. Thought it might be too sweet, judging by the packaging, what a nice surprise! Can't wait to see what the other reviews say!"
"NOTES: BBCSD-0812"
"Full-bodied ale is certainly appropriate for the style and the slight slickness is acceptable for a style that requires serious hopping to counterbalance a wallop of a grain bill. Still, drinkability is hurt somewhat by a big 'ol dose of booze and that same flavor reminiscent of a certain tropical fruit..."
"12 oz bottle cellared for about 1.5 years. i thought this would be brown in color, but it was a clear bright amber/copper with lots of big particulates/floaties. minimal creamy head and lacing. caramel, brown sugar, molasses, and a hint of aged rum in both the aroma and flavor. big sweetness upfront gives way to surprisingly noticeable citric/resiny sharp hop bite at the end. medium to full in body with a creamy mouthfeel and long sweet/bitter finish which ends as drying. unexpected and interesting."
"this beer was recommended to me and serves as my introduction to Lagunitas Beers. I love it. It is such a drinkable beer at 9.9% abv. It deserves respect. I don't think that it will improve with age, it is perfect as is! I would definitely try more of Lagunitas."
"Poured into a straight pint glass. Minimal head leaves light but sticky lacing. A very pretty reddish-brown. Sweet aroma with nice hop touches. Flavor matches aroma closely. Smoothly sweet at the front with a balancing hop tang at the finish. Faint alcohol taste, but not in a bothersome way. Body is just a little lighter than full. Very drinkable, but this beer will sneak up on you. Because it's smooth, sweet and easy to drink you might not notice it preparing to pop you. Very enjoyable, becoming a yearly favorite."
"D: Picked up a six pack of this and the first one was very drinkable. However, I can see how the richness and the alcohol could probably start to sneak up. Regardless, a pretty solid offering."
"Drinkability- Most enjoyable brew, yet as much as you'll enjoy it the high alcohol content, 9.5% and super full palate will probably limit this session to one or two. But, you'll definately want to go back for more."
"Poured amber/brown from the bottle with about a finger of off-white head. Aroma was mostly hoppy, similar to a pale ale or IPA, and the taste came off the same way. I didn't notice a lot of balance to the beer--citrus, almost pineapple-like hoppiness accompanied by some sugar sweetness. I almost felt like I was drinking a boozey (the ABV was up-front) pineapple upsidedown cake. Mouthfeel may have been the high point, as Brown Shugga' drank like a nice, full brew. With the ABV as high and noticeable, however, I wouldn't want to drink many of these."
"Drinkability: A medium bodied beer, with a sweet and heavy feel. It's a little syrupy and the booze may be limiting to drinking a lot. A good one to try though."
"M + D: A little big, kind of sticky... it leaves a fair bit of residue behind, which has me smacking my lips for a while after each sip. A little rich, perhaps, but a good beer... solid beer. I'd be game for more, though the alcohol makes it a bit of a slower indulgence brew."
"Notes: A very fine beer and something to savor. I really felt this one was very deceiving. At this ABV it really was easy to drink and while I will not ever session this one I will have at least two."
"I was expecting a little more sweetness and brown sugar flavor in this beer, considering its name. It was still pretty good, maybe with a year or two of age on it to let the hops settle down it would fit its moniker a little better."
"Overall - As of today - the most tasteful strong ale I'VE EVER HAD. PERIOD. Congrats Lagunitas, Brown Shugga's a work of art."
"D - Powerful and tasty, but hoppier than the name would, I think, suggest."
"Verdict: Brown Shugga' is a decent enough little Winter evening sipper. Having tried it now, if given the choice between picking up a bomber or a six-pack, the bomber would win for sure."
"Poured a one-finger tan head that dies quickly with minor lace sticking to the glass. A very hoppy aroma for a borwn ale with hints of minor fruit and an alright malt base. Smooth and creamy with a great hop bite and malt sweetness. There are plenty of malts in this. I swear I can taste toasted malt, chocolate, toffee, caramel, peppermint, butterscotch, and maybe hints of roasted and/or coffee malts (anything with sugar, and yes, brown sugar). Not thin, not overly thick though, wouldn't necessarily say bready but a little viscous. A good beer that I recommend and look forward to having again."
"Hops weren't excessive and in fact, were the only thing that made this brew drinkable. I finished the bottle but after half of it was gone, I was struggling. Glad that I had this at the bar, because there is no way I could've finished a 6 pack of this. Far too hot for my tastes and no brown sugar flavors that I can discern. Mainly, it's just a malty strong ale with nothing that makes it drinkable. Not a drain-pour but it isn't that much better."
"i dont like hoppy beers so i drank the wrong stuff here. for what it is its good. its not too strong so you can drink a bit of this before it gangs up on you. the price is nice as it is domestic and it does have a good taste, specially if your into hoppyness"
"I'll be returning to this brew."
"D - Very nice and drinkable for what it is. This a beer like this, complexity really helps the drinkability and this one is delightfully complex."
"Pours a nice copper color with a small head. Smell is of (surprise) brown sugar! Taste is very sweet upfront but the alcohol taste is present, but only slightly. Finishes clean and smooth with a nice caramel/sugar touch. Although you can taste the alcohol, it still doesn't feel like a 10% ABV beer.. a solid beer, would love to have it again."
"Poured into a pint glass which revealed the beer's dark amber color. Not much head, and a velvety carbonation. Malt, malt, malt. Surprisingly little hoppiness, but I don't care. This malt bomb's ABV adds the right counter point. The booze isn't hidden, and it's upfront to say the least. A little sweet and heavy on the mouthfeel, and it lends this beer to sipping. Warms up nicely on the tongue. The malt wallop is quite heavy, but this one may benefit from some shelf time."
"MD Mayve a little zippy from the carbonation (just a fraction). Was a good beer for sure although the sweetness and high alcohol limited my enjoyment a little, and the ability for another a lot."
"Beer pours a deep amber with a thick head. Head retention is average with some nice lacing. Aromas of beets, brown sugar and biscuits. Not a whole lot of hoppyness in the nose. Taste has a malty start dominated by brown sugar. The hops enter in mid palate with pine needles and some mild grapefruit. Overall the beer is well balanced and drinkable. At 9.5% alcohol, you should drink with care. I rate this beer high because it is unique and different from any other beer I've had. That can be a blessing and a curse as I know people who really don't like this beer. I love it myself."
"Mouthfeel is full, but the lack or carbonation hurts it."
"A medium to slightly thick brew with some resiny slipperiness. Creamy, but the alcohol and solid carbonation give it a crisp bite. Dangerously drinkable, although it can - probably thankfully, given the ABV - settle heavily enough to curtail any over-indulgence."
"all in a very interesting and tasty beer. one I would definitely recommend to friends to try at least once."
"pours a reddish copper color with a nice off white head with decent lacing. the nose is shugga, sweet malts, caramel, molasses. the taste is sweet malts up front followed directly with bitter hops, shugga, caramel, subtle dark fruits like dark cherries, subtle red apple. Light to medium bodied, medium to low carbo. American Barleywine? I think so..."
"D- I think I'll switch to a different beer for the rest of the night. I don't ever see myself drinking more than one or two of these."
"I had one of these and that was enough. For such a big beer you would like to find comparatively large flavors. Personally they just weren't there for me. It's not likely that I'll come back to this one."
"Pours a coca cola stream with off white head. Smell is pretty strong of hops, with lots of malt, and a sugar sweetness. There is a tinge of alcohol in the smell. Taste is well balanced between hops and malt, with a good aftertaste. Carbonation is high and is highly drinkable for 9.9%abv. I drank the first warm semi warm and it's still delicious."
"Sweetest ASA in town. Pours clear mahogany with a minimal tan head. Aroma is all brown sugar with some hops. The taste is different from anything I've ever had. Very malty up front, with some hops that moves quickly into the brown sugar finish. Alcohol is completely hidden in the taste. Based upon the taste, you would think this a sweet stout over a barleywine any day."
"D: Drinkable when served cold in cold weather, wouldn't be pleasant warm."
"Overall this is a very interesting beer that's certainly worth a shot."
"You have got to try this beer. I was happy to find it in a sixer for only $10."
"Ah truly gets a sweet release with this here fine, fine product. Yessir. Ah surely does. Poured only a small sample so didn't get much of a head. But, what's there lasts. No lace. Lovely deep red tinged amber color. Dark ripe fruit, malts, caramels, brandies in flavors. Booze in the mouth with good carbonation. Very good mouth. Quite rich. Maybe a bit heavy for a session beer. Nice finish."
"D: the ABV is sneaky on this so by flavor i could have many but by tolerance one or two max"
"Can't have more than one maybe two of this one."
"A friend and I split a sixer. I'm not mad that I have two more, it's a strong beer for a cheap price it will knock me on my ass."
"Drinkability: A little too sweet and too alcoholic to drink very many. Alcohol actually starts to burn after a while. Still, this is kind of expected from a strong ale. Worth a try, but don't go searching for it."
"D: Not very. The taste in my mouth is bad from this, though the buzz is damn good. I won't ever get this again."
"Had to drink from the bottle since i enjoyed it outside during an evening bouldering session couple hours ago...so I can't say much about the nose. I thought there were some really interesting heavy malt characteristics, and some trippy yeast flavors especially at the finish. Wasn't boozy tasting at all, and I enjoyed the moderate hopping, added a little bitterness but not much. It is definitely unique and a pretty solid beer. I thought it compared with Double Dog, though much less intense, less hoppy and far easier to drink...so maybe i'm on crack and it doesn't compare at all, its a solid brew though."
"delicious!"
"Poured a golden brown into a tulip with a light orange, fluffy head. Plenty of sheeting on the glass as I sipped. Sweet, molasses aroma. Flavor is dominated by brown sugar (surprise!) and malt, with a tea-like bitternsess at the finish. Thick and rich mouthfeel. It's rather sweet, not that complex, or balanced, but somehow it's a bit addictive, and I couldn't smell or taste the alcohol. Enjoyable, change of pace brew."
"Pours a dark copper/ brown color with a thin off white head. Aroma is brown sugar, cinamon, hazelnut and hops. Flavor is similar to aroma with a nice balance of brown sugar, cinamon and a strong hop presence. Finishes sweet and bitter."
"Delicious!"
"Hazy brown pour from tap. Duh. I get the name after drinking this one. Strong sugar taste as in tasting the brown sugar when baking. Has a smooth malty background. A medium to thick body and the high alcohol make this a nice warmer. Even though the flavors are complex the overall result seems a bit flat. So not really exterordanry and at the same time it would not work as a session beer do to the high sugar and alcohol."
"An interesting brew right here. I remember enjoying it more before I reviewed it. Something to learn there? Will gladly have again."
"Overall: Another great brew from Lagunitas that I'll definitely be picking up again."
"Booze isn't present in the flavor, but you definitely get a nice warming sensation from this one. An interesting beer, even if it isn't very complex, but it is too sweet and syrupy to be anywhere near sessionable."
"Taste & mouthfeel: As the aroma implies, this borders on being cloyingly sweet. Heavy on the palate but somewhat muddled, the faint fruity sourness doesn't gel right with the spicy sweetness and leafy hop bite. Somewhat thin in body despite the sweetness, with a surprisingly bitter finish. Can't say that I'm a fan of this one."
"Deep amber coloured, with a simple white head. Good retention and some lace. Aroma is very sweet and fruity. Flavour is very sweet, with a large hop presence. Bitterness tries to balance the sweetness, but loses in the end. Has a very full body with a moderate carbonation level. This is an intensely sweet beer, which is no supprise considering its called brown sugga and says something about sweet release on the label. The large hop presence was unexpected and really this beers saving grace for me. The hops, although muted by the huge amount of residual sugar in this beer, added another layer, that kept things from getting boring or nausiating. One is good in a night. Would make a great dessert beer."
"Overall, a good beer, and a smart choice for a good time."
"Medium bodies beer with a moderate ammount of carbonation. Sweet sugary hoppy a little bit of spice."
"Pours a nice amber color with no sediment, a two finger off white head that i had to produce with a hard pour, and some average lacing. Aroma is hoppy, notes of pine and citrus. The nose isn't all too dissimilar from the Imperial Red, maybe slightly more sweetness. Yes, this thing is sweet. Very sweet, but not drain-pouring, outrageously so. There's a nice balance between the dark sugary sweetness and bitter, citric hops. Sugar coated orange slices, hints of caramel and maple syrup. Alcohol is completely well hidden in the flavor, but it can be felt in the throat on the way down. Thick and creamy to say the least, the epitome of full-bodied. Yeah, the high ABV can be felt in the brain as the glass begins to empty. A nice brew, strong, sweet, bitter, balanced in a big way. I'm not sure how many more brews I can have tonight after this one."
"A sweet Two Hearted? That's what I first thought of while drinking. At first the citrus really threw me off, I was expecting something more Nutty. Halfway through the glass I got more of the sugga' (if that's what they call it) and by the finish I could feel the alcohol and less of the citrus that boned me in the beginning."
"Poured a copper color with a nice fluffly white head. Nose has a nice sweet malt with a bit of hops and alcohol. Taste is brown sugar dominance with a bit of molasses. Alcohol is very noticeable after finishing only one. There is a definite presentation of malt and has a sweet finish."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall - Simply solid. A nice little experiment, nothing I'd go crazy over but worth giving a shot."
"I was pleasantly supprised by this beer. First off it is a great deal at under $10 a six pack. It pours a reddish copper with a silky tan head. The nose has fruity hops and rich malts. The taste has lots of caramel malts and bitter hops. The body fits the style well. A great beer from Lagunitas that strays away from their usual recipes."
"Bottle from trade with Ty. Pours a light brown with little to no head. The taste is mostly a sweet smooth malt, some hops, citrus, cinnamon and apples, and some brown sugar. It's a great mix that really blends together nice. No real notice of the alcohol. An easygoing drink with a lot to like."
"Poured this reddish copper coloration beer into a pint glass. The foam that it gave originally was good and reduced to a good head. Sugary! wow sweet malt with a hoppy aftertaste. It does leave a good warm feeling in your mouth. Great winter beer. The beer has a great carbonation and keeps it up throughout the drink."
"Mouthfeel: Big body, almost chewy. Lightly carbonated."
"The taste is a bit sweet but also with an earthy-dark toasted bite and bitterness. It has rich, aromatic, caramelly-stewed prune quality. It is fairly drinkable for the strength, the alcohol mostly adding full warmth and a bit of a spicey bite. It has a thick, oily feel."
"With a name like Brown Shugga' I thought I would detect more brown sugar sweetness than I did. This brew should be sipped, however, it is drinkable for its 9.9% ABV. My first brew from Lagunitas Brewing and I am impressed - have 5 more that I am looking forward to finish!"
"D - The name had me thinking Quaker Oatmeal sweetness but this is different and much more appropriate for my beer. Maybe some too sweet to have a few in just 1 sitting. Very enjoyable tho!"
"I recommend anyone to take this for a spin."
"Damn the Raleigh Flying Saucer has been getting some great stuff in lately! 2006 vintage on draft! Served a crisp dark orange with a thin diminishing head that leaves great lacing on the glass. Aroma is slight caramel and brown sugar, but a bit on the weak side. The taste is loads of brown sugar and caramel, loads of mops with the hops pushed way in the background. The beer is medium bodied and the age seems to have toned down the alcohol presence a bit. This one is certainly an enjoyable sipper."
"pours from a 12 ounce bottle .. lets go... very silky and mellow beer for having a 9.9% backbone .. tasty and abv very well hidden ... warms u up nicely .. van is the man, sneijder too (2) ... great flavours in this one- brown sugar, rum, figs, plums ... same aroma too ... a very drinkable barleywine!"
"D: An excellent Lagunitas effort (not surprisingly) but the 9.9% might slow you down a little. Definitely worth a try or two, and it probably cellars very well."
"Drinkability: Very sweet, and very high in abv%, but I surprisingly liked this way more than I expected I would. Alcohol is very well-hidden, malts are surprisingly complex (even if they are intense). A pleasant surprise and a very good beer."
"D-Very drinkable. Sweet but not too sweet and just enough hop kick to keep hop heads happy. I struggle to believe that this is 9.9%...a stealthy beer for sure! Brown Shugga....I love you! Thanks Mick!"
"D: Very nicely done with a sweet start and bitter finish that compliment each other for a great overall experience. Alcohol was very well hidden for 9.0% and makes for a good drinkable beer, though comes off a tad sweet at times which may limit multiples."
"-Oelergud"
"D: A good beer by Lagunitas, I wasn't wowed by it, but pretty solid."
"12 oz bottle: Nice sweet malt aroma, definite big hop characteristic as well, maybe some brown sugar scent but subtle. Appearance is amber/red with a thin tan head. Taste has definitely got some caramel malt in this, citrus hops, sweet, and alcohol is present on the back end. Palate is somewhat sweet on the lips, very tongue coating, and aftertaste has a lingering caramel maltiness and a bit of alcohol. Overall, it's good but not great kind of like most of the Lugunitas that I've had. Maybe it's too young. Will check back on this one in a year."
"D - Not as heavy as I initially feared. For some reason I was expecting something in the brown ale category... dunno why. This however is pushing barleywine territory."
"Simply put, this is an exceptionally well-rounded beer. Its sweet, sugary aspect is apparent, yet it never becomes cloying or messy. (This beer borders on being a sweeter version of a barleywine, and a damn fine one at that.) Brown Shugga' actually reminds me a great deal of Lagunitas's own Sneak Release Undercover Investigation Shut-Down Ale, but slightly better. I advise you to seek out this magical beer at any cost."
"The body is on the light side and the carbonation is medium light. The alcohol is *very* well hidden and because of that, the contents of my glass are disappearing at an alarming rate. Oh well. That's a problem I'll deal with and I give a salute to Lagunitas for brewing a fine American Strong Ale. I'd drink this again, no problem."
"12 oz bottle in to imp pint glass. Pours tea-brown with an offwhite head (my overly aggessive pour). Can definitely smell brown sugar, some sort of fruit that I can't peg, and raisins. Taste is sweet, apricot, with bitterness in the back. The alcohol lingers a little, but doesn't overpower initially. Not overwhelmingly drinkable because of the alcohol, but smoothe nonetheless."
"The taste is sweet but not near as much as I expected. That's good, I don't like really sweet beers. I really enjoyed this one but I guess I am partial to the stuff from Lagunitas. ;)"
"Too sweet for me. It was nice to try but won't seek out again."
"The sixer of this not enough, glad I decided to check if I had reviewed it or not, as I was down to the last bottle. Another fine brew from Lagunitas."
"Looks very pretty, deep amber color with a nice off-white head that leaves excellent lacing. Nose is lots of sweet fruit and malt, and a good bit of alcohol too. Flavor's lots of toffee and caramel malt, very mild hop flavor. Alcohol comes through strong, overwhelming some of the other possible flavors. Some light dried fruit. Mouthfeel is solid, medium to light with good carbonation. Overall, a drinkable beer, although the alcohol flavor and general ABV is just a little too high for more than one or two."
"** This beer was an absolutely amazing pairing with norwegian gjetost cheese and soda crackers."
"D: This one is very drinkable. In fact, its one of those that could get scary since it is high ABV but goes down so smoothly."
"Wow! A really tasty and unique brew that I enjoyed way too quickly. Awesome."
"This was a sweet offering considering the mighty ABV for this ale. Enjoyed chilled in a pint glass. Poured a brownish amber with a creamy head. Smelled of subtle caramel and brown sugar with some faint floral hop undertones. Taste was sweet and sugary with a good hop balance and a smooth palate. I would say mix this bad boy with some maple syrup, pour it on your pancakes and munch away."
"Certainly drinkable, it didn't taste like it was 9%+ alcohol."
"Not the most complex of beers, but very well put together."
"This beer seemed to get sweeter as it warmed. It was very easy to drink and tremendously dangerous at 9.9% alcohol."
"Not sure what to say editorially. I thought it came out a little thinner and lighter than an American barleywine; that Old ale might be a good handle for it. I could see age being a factor here, but I will definitely look to try it again."
"This poured a hazy reddish orange with no head. It smelled like brown sugar (surprise!) and some malt. Its flavor had a sharp bitterness up front followed by some sugar sweetness. It was oily and thick with no carbonation, and it had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very unique ale, with a name and scent that didn't match up to the flavor (but was still pretty good)."
"overall, this is really good i will buy more"
"Rich reddish maroon pour with a nice and big lasting beige head in a snifter. Smell is light, bright and balanced maltiness with just enough balancing hops. Taste is pretty mild, slightly thin and balanced again, with lemony and slightly acidic tart malt. Very smooth and drinkable for 10%. Slightly hoppy on the backend but overall its flavor was too mild to be really great, and it doesn't get any better as it warms...Still worth trying."
"D - Very good, this is an all around nicely constructed brew, and one I'd revisit any time. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall: I enjoyed it. I had this one after the hopslam and I asked for a glass of water because I thought I kept tasting the hops from the hopslam. I was happy to realize this one had a wonderful hop character of its own. Blended with the nice sweet brown sugar and a hint of booze makes this a wonderful drinking brew."
"Pours a gorgeous clear, copper and ruby color with a well supported tan head. Aromas are quite hoppy, plenty of grapefruit, orange, along with a slight spicy phenolic character with some spicy twang. Very little in the way of malt aroma, just a sweet note, but a good bit of alcohol. On the palate, it just sits on your tongue, one of the heaviest feeling beers I've had in a while. Sitting only at 51 IBUs, it isn't overly bitter, quite balanced actually; but, there's just a ton of hop flavor. Still, the malt character is lacking, just a touch of bready toastiness, crystal sweetness, finishing dry with lots of lingering hops. Overall, it's an interesting ASA (DIPA), though I think the undercarbonation and mouthfeel bring down the drinkability a bit."
"Slightly boozy finish is the only inclination of a heavy hitter. It was not cloying, nor sweet, nor overly bitter, as many American barleywines can be. Perfectly drinkable because of this, though I can't have too many."
"The beer poured an orangish-brown with very little head into a chalice. I detected alcoholic esters with a slight citrusy hop aroma. The taste was an enormous explosion of hop flavor and alcoholic esters, blending nicely with a distinct citrusy sweetness. The initial taste dissipated into a long-lasting hop bitterness. A very tasty and drinkable beer - it is definitely one of my favorites from Lagunitas. Nice carbonation and lacing too."
"I was suprised the brew tasted like it did, from the name I thought it would be a much sweeter brew. That being said this is a really good brew that I enjoyed quite a bit."
"Drinkability: Not nearly as graceful and seamless as some of the great barleywines, but decent enough for the price, I suppose."
"Poured a rich dark copper with good head, little lacing, and a lot of sediment. Very ruch and malty scent, extremely sweet. A wonderful taste, very reminiscent of a scotch ale/wee heavy without the peat. It's fantastically smooth for a 9.9% ABV beer. A wonderful brew."
"Pours a nice amber/copper with a tall and thick tan colored head that laces the glass all the way down. The aroma is of some sweet malts followed by a hint of alcohol, then a big boppy bitterness followed by a very sweet brown sugar aroma to finish it off. The taste is the same as well. It has a strong sweet malt base with a very nice hoppy bitter with very little hint of the amount of alcohol that is in this beer. It then follows up with an overly sweet aftertaste of brown sugar. It tastes like a strong ale that was fermented with brown sugar in the end. The mouthfeel is good - very warming, fresh, and smooth. The drinkability is high especially for a beer of this gravity."
"Overall: Wow, is this good. Pretty easy to forget that it's almost 10% abv. Highly recommended to anyone and everyone."
"Drinkability - I'd grab another sixer of these for sure. They are a joy to drink one at a time, or three in an evening."
"Definitely recommended..."
"I'm glad I went out of my way to track this down at Kensington Wine Market in Calgary, currently the only store in Alberta to carry it (maybe even Canada?). The Bushwakker used to carry it a year or two ago."
"D - This is a very good Strong Ale. It just tastes great."
"Poured into a snifter. Brown Shugga pours a light mahogany with a slightly off-white head that drops kind of quickly and leaves a halo around the edge of the glass, which leads to thin lacing. Aromas of fig, prunes and molasses are immediately present, with a hint of strong alcohol. Strong malty sweetness in the first sip, and the high alcohol lingers for awhile. Sweet malts are balanced nicely with the hops that finish the taste. Its actually hoppy-er than I thought at first, epecially for a 51 IBU Strong Ale. Solid mouthfeel, with a complex palate and perfect carbonation. Delicious and definitely worth getting."
"D: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easily, not too filling, strong kick, this is a very good beer to drink over the course of an evening until the ABV catches up with you."
"Pours a ruby chestnutt. Excellent clariy with a foamy white head. Smell- fruity sweetness. Taste- initial flavours are hops and fruit. Sweet malts come through in the middle and finish is bitter and dry. The extra sugar has fermented down nicely. Not cloying but you definitely know its there. Like liquid caramel. Good sipper on a winter night."
"I'm looking forward to the next five in my six pack."
"D- Surprisingly drinkable for such a sweet, sticky and strong brew, but my opinion may be a bit biased due to my predilection for sweets. Still, I think that this one would get tiring after the first was done and I would probably move on to something a but more tame. However, this one definitely succeeds at being a unique beer."
"D: I'm a big fan of this beer. It's definitely meant for maltheads, but it's pretty well balanced and is nice and drinkable."
"This has officially joined my short list of favorite beers. I tried to think of ways in which to improve this that might result in a slightly lower score in some way, but cannot, and I'm glad for it. Five stars. Amazing beer!"
"Bottle courtesy of Unclemattie: Poured a cloudy medium brown color ale with a good size head with good retention and some minimal lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt with some notes of toffee. Taste is a very interesting mix between some toffee, caramel and butterscotch malt with a light hoppy finish that is well balance. Full body with limited filtration and some great carbonation with no apparent alcohol."
"D - This is a one and done. The high ABV makes it that way. Not a horrible beer but I would pass on this on in the future."
"Drinkability: This is a solid American strong ale. It warms you up, but you would never guess the ABV"
"Eric"
"It's good, but doesn't do anything great."
"a good beer jury is still out though."
"Brown Shugga is a BW in '07/'08 .. Where's the Gnarleywine? I think I have a little left in my glass."
"The beer pours a dark amber/red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice balanced aroma of malts and hops. It's warming to the nose, but also enticing with loads of hop smells. The malt aroma is composed of lots of pale malts and a wonderful array of specialty malts, which provide the ""Brown Shugga"" element. The taste is great. It has an incredibly smooth malty taste that weighs heavy on burnt toffee flavors. It goes down easy and finishes silky smooth with a nice hop blast that lingers. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tremendous beer. It packs a bundle of flavor; a fine drinker."
"Way to sweet to drink too much of, but an interesting beer for sure."
"Pours a nice dark copper with hints of red and orange. There wasn't much of a head but there was nice lacing. Smells like sweet caramel. There is a good brown sugar taste and it balances nicely with the hops. Good mouthfeel and great drinkability for a 9.9$ ABV beer. This beer is wonderful on a cold rainy day."
"Overall, I was not very impressed with the balance of the hops to the sweetness. Good mouthfeel and appearance still make this beer worth while."
"D- delicious brew with wonderful complexity and balance, and fantastic mouthfeel. Recommended, I'll be looking forward to this"
"It's not too heavy, I'd ask for another, I definitely dig it."
"Summary: buy a 6 pack of this, hide the keys and enjoy!!"
"Congratulations Brown Shugga, you are my favorite beer, and have inspired me to write my first BA review!"
"This is a great beer, in my opinion. I am not want to drink malt-monster all the time, but this appeals to me as much as the Oskar Blues Old Chub, which I love. But the Shugga has more of a hop kick to it, which I think I ultimately prefer. It's boozy, but not over-wrought with alcohol in either the aroma or the taste. Would go well with a hearty beef or game stew as well as a rich dessert, like a cheesecake. Enjoy this beer."
"Grabbed a six pack for the Pats - Jax game last Saturday. Pours a brownish orange color with some good head that lasted a good amount of time. The smell was of malt and sugar. This beer has a wonderful brown ale flavor, with an added aspect of (brown) sugar that helps it stand out from others in the style. Very tasty. The one thing I noticed with this beer is the high ABV. The beer has such a nice taste to it, and they go down fairly easily. But if you want a few, be careful. After only three (we split the sixer), I really started to feel it. Make sure you remember this is not your typical brown ale."
"Tastes somewhat like Arrogant Bastard but sweeter (IMO of course). Citrus, tropical fruits, caramel, thick sweet malt. I cant really say I noticed the brown sugar but it is sweet."
"Overall, a tasty treat. Very good, but with some more body could be fantastic."
"D - This is a slow-sipper and would balance best with a bland meal or appetizers."
"Pours amber brown with a thin tan head.Decent retention,and nice lacing. This beer looks thick.Aroma is sweet,and bready. Body is thick,with a good amount of carbonation. Taste is of malty brown sugar,and spice.Nice bit of hops,and a good burn in the finish."
"Brown shugga pours a clear brown amber with good fluffy head. head dissipates but lace remains quite thick. The nose has subtle hop notes and some light malt. The taste is predominantly smooth hop flavors with less bitterness than an IPA but it is still there. A wierd sugar malt taste makes up a decent backbone. Hop flavors on the finish leave a slight bitterness in the mouth. A good brew, but nothing particularly special. Mouthfeel is good, chewy but not terribly thick. Drinkability is the highlight of this strong ale as the 9.9 does not show up at all. A great strong ale for session drinking which makes no sense but it is what it is."
"Wow, this is a dangerous, evil brew. That 9.9 abv is nowhere to be found, more like a 4.5. Well balanced and a delight to drink. Go grab some now."
"At 9.9% alcohol, this beer drinks very easy. Lots of flavor but good balance. A very fine beer, and a bargain if I do say so."
"I am considering picking up another 6-pack of this so I can enjoy it throughout the winter. Not a beer you would drink all night, but definitely one I am going to return to"
"D--This beer is strong to be sure. I like Lagunitas, good brewery. Worth a try if you enjoy strong ales, not a favorite though."
"D: Pretty good. But it is 10% ABV..."
"Served at just about cellar temperature, into a pint glass, from a twelve ounce brown bottle. Poured a deep copper amber color that had great clarity. Two fingers of thick, frothy, beige colored head formed from a somewhat vigorous pour. Head faded pretty quickly into a fluffy ring of foam atop the beer. Some sticky, glass coating lace was left behind on the glass. Smell had some plum, rum soaked cherries, thick sweet malt, and a small amount of alcohol. Tons of dark dried fruits in the flavor, some pineapple, some sweet brown sugar, and plenty of body warming alcohol stacked on a sweet malty base. Finishes smooth and just a bit boozy. Mouthfeel is thick, almost syrupy, with a medium to full body. Great drinkability. This has got to be one of my favorites."
"awesome beer!"
"I found this one middle of the road, unique, but not worth getting excited about. It tastes a lot like a mild Scottish Ale, with a little more alcohol. Recommended (barely, and if you like maltier beers)."
"Pours a coppery light brown color. No head but a thin foam that fades to the sides and results in nice lacing as the drink is consumed. There is nice carbonation in the glass, nice bubbles. The aroma is first and foremost sweet strong malt with hints of vanilla, caramel, syrup, and some floral hop. The taste is much the same. Up front it's sweet malt, caramel, some spice, and maple syrup. I agree that the taste reminds me of brown sugar. In the end the taste is distinct bitter hop. This beer is well balanced, simple, and straightforward."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer had a red hue to it with a minimal head. The beer was very hoppy smelling. This brew I was hoping was going to be really great, but it was just to high on the alcohol burn and too sweet for my taste. I will not buy again"
"D- A unique brown/strong ale with flashes of flavor, a bit too cloying and boozey for my tastes, I would probably not go out of my way for a second tasting"
"Pours a clear but darker amber brown. Nice sized crème head. Nose is a nice slightly sweet toned hoppy thing. I feel like I am getting a whiff of sugar cane on there too. Flavor is a combination of firm ale qualities with an amount of brown sugar mixed in that takes it to the side a little bit to an interesting place. The ale tones here are so well done. A nice thick and meaty offering. Feel has a great carbonation to it and a good body as well. Very drinkable. I don't get any of that 9.9% alcohol as it goes down. Smooth and even. Another very good brew by Lagunitas."
"Pours a brilliant red amber hue. Firm head at first but fades. Steady carb. Initial taste is sweet sweet sweet, some malty-ness in the background. Gave me sticky lips. Bitterness follows but not that pleasant. After a few sips the obvious alcoholiness takes over, they aren't kidding with the 9% ABV either. A strange brew but a unique taste of sweet brown sugar that isn't found in any other ale that I know of . . . Try it."
"Drinkability is very good for me...I rarely have more then 2 or 3 in a sitting due to the high ABV and robust taste, but I enjoy them fresh all winter. Another tasty, cheap big brew from Lagunitas, very cool!"
"I couldnt drink this.. my second official drainpoor."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink if you are looking for hops. Decent enough beer and hides its ABV well."
"D: Considering the alcohol content, this drink is very smooth. Feels nice, the aroma lingers, and the taste stays. Not bad at all!"
"Notes: The first time I ever had this was a sample at dba in NYC. I didn't buy a full glass then b/c I thought it was too sweet. I've now come to appreciate that there's more balance here than I originally thought, but still, this beer resides more on the sweet, malty side of the equation rather than on the bitter, hops side. . . . At one point I had the thought ""this is like a poor man's Arrogant Bastard"" -- a sweeter Strong Ale with more booze in it, leaning a tad towards barleywine territory. Worth checking out."
"Drinkability: Very flavorful and unique. It reminded me of a light Barley Wine."
"This is the scariest beer I every drank. The alcohol is completely hidden in the taste (but I can feel it). A nice winter beer."
"D. A fine malty delight, although the sweetness is a little high for me. Sugary from start to finish, this is a good dessert beer -- would probably go stupid well with creme brulee. Recommended."
"12 oz bottle from Wine Gallery in Brookline, MA. A: Amber, very clear, moderate amount of tan head that goes down to a caked on layer. Lots of lacing. S: Brown sugar of course, lots of dark fruit and some citrus as well (orange especially). Some boozey spice and roasted malts. T: Syrupy sweet up front with a nice bitter finish. Much more hoppy than I expected, which is very nice. M: Very thick, chewy, moderate to low carbonation. D: I was really surprised by the hop profile on this one--it's sort of like a cross between a barleywine and a DIPA. Really fantastic, unique beer. I'll definitely pick this up again if I see it."
"very possibly my favorite ale. i waited for 8 months for it to be re-released, this year in 6-packs. Brown shugga is actually a variant of lagunitas Gnarlywine, an aptly named barlywine. the taste of the brown sugar makes it very pleasant to drink, hides the alcohol well. definately best nearly ice-cold in a chilled pint glass."
"I got this 12 oz bottle from 3 Cellars in Franklin, WI."
"Dulcie picked this up at Wholefoods. Being big fans of the Lagunitas we are interested in trying new things. That said, I was a little circumspect about drinking a beer that seemed to speak of sweetness in the name. The 10% alcohol level was certainly a compensating factor; but actually it was a revelation in the glass. It poured a clear coppery teak colour with very little carbonation; the nose was redolent of molasses, but in the mouth you have an interesting tension between the bitterness of hop and the residual sugar. The key is, it wasn't sweet at all, but beguilingly smooth and syrupy with some caramel butterscotch notes. In an inexperienced hand it could be extremely dangerous: hugely drinkable. A top five find for us."
"Overall a somewhat disappointing brew. I was hoping for a little fireworks but all I got was a little 'pop'. Its a very smooth strong ale, but no scenery or personality. Well constructed but uneventful."
"It totally fits the song! You shoulda heard him just around midnight!"
"I'm not as disappointed in this beer as this review appears. This is a fine strong ale, just not one of my favorites. Kudos to Lagunitas for trying something cool: brown sugar in the brew."
"D - well, this is quite strong and quite sweet. Definitely enjoyable, but I'm not sure I could do more than 2 (and that's pushing it) in a sitting due to the strength and fullness of it. Of course as the alcohol continues to sink in I start to reconsider another. Ha. Either way I like it. Check it out!"
"The high alcohol presence is hidden well only really noticable when going down the throat. Snow is on the ground here in Central Ohio and this beer compliments it well, keeps you warm with a nice flavor. Another winner from the brewers in Petaluma."
"The bottom line: I didn't know quite what to expect with this beer, but what I got was a well balanced beer with a notable hop presence. I don't think it's particularly amazing, but it succeeds as an enjoyable strong ale."
"Overall- A great beer if you're into sweet. I'm going through a phase of really enjoying malty beers, but this one seems to go too far in the brown sugar direction. There were good things about this beer, but not enough to compensate for the negative for me."
"D - Sobriety be damned! I want more of this glorious stuff! This is really an outstanding brew....could take the place of a brandy after dinner, but it's balanced enough to drink a few of if you aren't planning on operating any heavy machinery in the next few hours!"
"D: Could drink a number of these but would have to try and keep in mind the ABV level!"
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark brownish red color with an off-white head. The aroma is a lot of sweet malt and piney hops. The taste much like the aroma features a good dose of malt followed by a nice hoppy finish. There is a good dose of hops in the taste, but there is a sufficient amount of malt to make this a well balanced brew. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and very smooth. The drinkability is pretty high considering it's high ABV, the full malt and hop flavors mask the alcohol pretty well. Overall, this is a very good beer that is recommended."
"Served out of bottle in pint glass. Nice but lighter brown was expecting darker - a few fingers of head that held nicely. Smelled boozey and hoppy for a brown. I was expecting at least a hint of brown sugar and a lot more maltiness. Felt decently carbonated but not too much so, great mouthfeel when warmer. Tasted boozey and hoppy for a brown. Drinkability - I really hadn't read the abv, a little boozey for me."
"D- a pretty solid ale, better than i was expecting from the reviews, but hey thats the name of the game."
"Not the best from Lagunitas but not bad at the same time, wish this one was a little sweeter which is odd because most of their beers are typically, cool idea for brewing this one though but the sugar cane is barely distinguishable, recommended if curious like I was"
"Brown Shugga' pours a light brown with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a very mild malty aroma. The flavor is quite strong on hops like an American IPA, bright and floral, but the malt bill is quite different. There is a sweet flavor, but I'm not sure I can attribute it to the brown sugar though. Not bad, but it didn't really do it for me."
"Buy this one when you can."
"D - I don't know what it is about this beer, but it has never seemed to impress me. I love Lagunitas, and I want to like this beer, but no... Also, I get a little tired of bartenders asking me if there is something wrong with my beer when I am just waiting for it to warm up to something other than 38 F...."
"also: what the hell is an American Strong Ale, anyway?"
"Good beer overall, would definitely buy another 6er."
"This is a meal in a bottle...very sweet & rich. Plenty of alcohol burn..maybe a little over the top. But overall, a good offering from Lagunitas that does not disappoint."
"d: I got this one from brandoman63 via trade. I hope I can find this around here because it is superb. I"
"Whatever the classification, it's decent enough."
"D: A little too sweet for an everyday beer, but not bad once in a while."
"Pours a cloudy amber color, nice carbonation, small fizzy off-white head, which leaves some sticky lacing around. The nose is malty, hoppy, slight spicy, and lots of caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, some hops, slight spice, and a good dose of caramel. The alcohol is hidden well. Medium body, well rounded brew. Very drinkable, this is a good ASA, another great brew from Lagunitas, highly recommended."
"D: One bomber is too much. This would be better off in a 12 oz bottle. The brown sugar is a nice touch, lending a hint of Belgian-style to the ale."
"Aged a little over a year. Pours a hazy amber burned orange with 2 fingers of pearl head that dies slow and leaves sheets of lacing. Smells of dried dark fruit, sweet malt, a hint of spice. Taste is sme as smell with a kick of tasty hop at the end. Reminds me a little of a SN Bigfoot. Medium in the mouth with ample carbonation. High drinkability and the ABV is not existant. Delicious brew."
" ~ Interesting. I'd recommend it to my friends based soley on it not being an ordinary brew. This is worth a try."
"This is a great ale."
"He's throwing a party tonight, and I thought it may afford me a chance to escape, but the party was so huge that he had to have security stationed at every doorway, whether in the grand ballroom that had woods as a back wall, or at the top of the front steps where one stepped into the next layer, as it were, of the house... set up almost like an onion, I recall it to have been... and the last thing I remember is searching down a hallway that seemed to be constantly shrinking, with strange artwork on the walls and guards at the ends... Many, many colours here, not just the porcelain and gold, and the desperation was setting in as I remembered the ghastly scars that covered his grotesque upper body and he smiled and acted as though he were a benevolent father, but I knew that though I could have all the fun I wanted within those walls, there would never be any escape... and I had yet to discover a good reason why he wanted to keep me..."
"The big alcohol is hardly perceptible and this is easy goin down for 9.9%!"
"D: At 9.9% ABV, you don't drink too many of these - but they are quite enjoyable."
"Drinkability is still good. I think I prefer this fresh, but it's still a nice beer and the age has not ruined it in my opinion."
"Murky brown-amber pour with a thin and foamy off-white head. Thin spotty lacing as well. The aroma is sharply hoppy with sweet fruit and molasses coming through more as it warms. The labeling on this one really threw me off as I was expecting more of a sweet brown ale. Once my taste buds told me it was actually a Barley Wine I was able to recover. Very hoppy on the front end, along with some peppery alcohol. The flavor mellows a bit as malt and fruits start to seep in. The finish is round and fruity with an alcohol burn leftover. Above average, and kind of unique to boot."
"Pours a deep orange/ light brownish color, with a light tan head. In the aroma a caramel sweetness and malty. In the taste, caramel, sugary sweet and a dry end. Huge sweetness with a dry end, an aftertaste of brown sugar. It is a bit too sweet for me, but it does hide the alcohol very well."
"Lagunitas Brown Shugga' pours out a reddish brown color topped with a small head. The aroma is sweet and malty. The brown sugar is quite noticeable in the nose. The flavor is sweet, but not syrupy. I taste raisins and brown sugar. Emphasis is on the malt, but hops come in at the finish, and the bitter hoppiness seems to build up as I work my way through this 22 ounce bottle. Alcohol is high, and that combined with the large bottle size makes for a beer to sip over several hours, if you're going at it alone."
"A 22oz bomber poured into a pint glass. Amber color with a very small head. Aroma is mostly caramel, with a little bit of citrus. Taste was caramel/brown sugar, with a strong malt presence, and some grapefruit hoppiness. A fairly robust beer, kind of chewy. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and will look for it again."
"Drinks damn easy for the abv, an almost great take on the style"
"Pours a dark ruby/amber color with very little head. Smell is malts, brown sugar, molasses, piney hops, and alcohol. Taste is primarily sweet matls and brown sugar/carmel. Surprisingly not too sweet or cloying. Perfect balance of sweet flavors and alcohol. Mouthfeel is on the heavy side, which is fine for the style. Crazy drinkable at ABV. Another excellent beer from Lagunitas, as I have grown accustomed to."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are also surprising. Clearly there are lots of sugars in the brew, because after a few sips my lips were sticking to the pint glass. But the body is not syrupy. It drinks like a lighter Vienna-style lager. It is way too drinkable for being so huge, so definitely nurse this one or split it with a friend."
"D: A bit strong in both the alcohol and bitterness department to get a great drinkability rating, but it is good."
"D: Nice flavors going on in here. I think this beer would age well for a couple of years and round out quite nicely. Makes a good after dinner digestif."
"I do like the creativity of this brew and thanks goes to czoch75 for this extra."
"Mouthhfeel has a solid medium body. Slightly slick and syrupy, but not cloying. Very nice"
"Scott"
"22 oz bottle. Copper orange with a big tan head. Good lacing. Aroma is lovely g with odors of grapefruit, hops, and some caramel, as well as just a touch of alcohol. Lots of flavors. Somewhat sweet. Slick mouthfeel and oily on the back of the tongue. It goes down like cough syrup. Nice hoppy finish. Yum."
"Poured from a 22oz. bomber into a standard pint glass. Appearance is a copper color with a tan/caramel color tin when held to the light. There wasn't much head on this one, possibly less than an inch. Mouthfeel was warm and the alcohol notes were highly detectable. Sugary sweet tastes were prevalent, lots of malts- dessert flavors. This one drank very easily for such a high ABV at 9.9%. I would absolutely buy this one again- enjoyed best on a cold winter night."
"Overall a good beer, but not the best from Lagunitas. I'll definitely buy it again, and it is well worth the $3.99 I paid for the bomber. Definitely worth a try."
"I expected a dense malty texture but was pleasantly surprised by a bright clean finish. Overall sweet and appetizing but not to heavy to enjoy the entire bottle on a hot day."
"12 oz bottle that I have had in the cellar for about six months. The color was a deep orange, cloudy, and had a short white head which disappeared quickly. The smell was a little bit sweet. The taste was alcoholic and slightly like a barleywine. Not much hops going on at this point. I liked this beer a lot better fresh. Also, the high ABV is enjoyable but lowers the drinkability. I can't wait for Gnarleywine."
"Pours a nice brown with a quickly fading off white head. Decent lacing. Smells very sweet, slight hops. Taste is definite brown sugar, this is a very aptly named beer. Sweet malts, massive brown sugar, very slight hop notes, make a nice, drinkable brew."
"Into a pint glass, pours a light copper with good off-white head, lacing in pots down the glass. Aroma is full of brown sugar, molasses, alcohol, caramels, toffees, sweet malty goodness, and don't even pick up any hop qualities. The taste has some bittering, slight citrus and oils from the hops, but again its the brown sugar that floats this boat, a smooth but subtly carbonated mouth giving it a great feel as it soothes you with oils, and sweetness, and delight. I can't say its my favorite strong, but a damn good one."
"Good stuff, I'd drink it again, very nice balance of the large amounts of sweetness and bitterness. A nice surprise as this is my first of the Lagunitas brews. Well worth the buy."
"Comments: Very tasty! Very full flavored & well balanced. Enjoyed this all the way through & definitely warrants a repeat purchase."
"When I first had this beer, the hops did not stand out as much as they do in the bottle. The beer was harsh, but not like I'm experiencing now. I'm certainly willing to give it another chance (it's not bad at all to begin with), but I'd like to try it with some age on it."
"From the 22oz bomber; this poured an orange-tinted amber with a thin but prominately standing cover of thin foam. Light sugary aroma. The sweet brown sugar (surprise?) flavor was mellow -- Id never peg this for an almost 10% ABV beer. This drinks very easily, only slightly warming with a nice full but casual Barleywine-like burn, with a slight hoppy tingle to finish it. Good. (#2796, 4/14/2007)"
"Nice nightcapper on a chilly spring evening, even better if shared."
"M&D: Good feel to it with the hops and sugars coming out from the first sip. Good semi-dense beer. You sure know time was taken making this beer. Very drinkable if your a hop fan. Overall a Good beer."
"Drinkability: 4 It's so dang tasty, you keep wanting more. .Overall a very good beer but the bitterness lingers for a solid 60 seconds so it is hard to call this ""drinkable."" I think this is still a little young. I would like to give it 6-12 months to see how the bitterness gets sanded down and the alcohol heat mellows. Will probably be exceptional."
"Certainly a sipper, however a very enjoyable one. Also inexpensive as the single bottle cost me $1.50. Try this one out if you can find it"
"Served at cellar temperature. Light shade of copper, crystalline with swirling carbonation streams. A fluffy cloud of dense and rocky ecru foam sits atop. Pine-inflected grapefruit and mandarin orange slices in the aroma; floral and slightly sugary, too. The citric hops from the aroma are surprisingly muted in the flavor, which is a pleasantly sweet affair overall, reminiscent of canned orange sections in syrup. Sugared nasturtiums and grapefruit jellybeans. Just a hair thicker than medium-full in body; slippery mouthfeel, remaining creamy without sliding into syrupy. Impressive!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's somewhere between light and medium bodied. It has a light syrupy feel to it. At nearly 10% ABV, I probably won't be drinking more than one. But, I'm enjoying it. Overall, it's a good beer. Actually better than I was expecting. Definitely worth checking out."
"Drinkability: Actually pretty drinkable given the shock factor here. Even though I didn't get anything I expected to out of this beer, it's pretty enjoyable. Goes down smoothly, and even the belches taste pretty good ;)"
"Sweet & warming and surprisingly drinkable, this is a great strong ale to sit down with on a cold, winter's night."
"Hell, I don't know where this will fit, but I want to explore it again. Great stuff. Amber ale like none other. Great!"
"Recommended. Nice after dinner beer."
"Drinkability - this is very good. High abv obviously limits sessionability."
" I'm glad to see Lagunitas coming to my area, I've had a chance to try five different beers from them recently."
"The alcohol is well-masked. It's there, but I would have guessed around, or close to, 7%. A unique beer that is rich, well-balanced while remaining appropriately sweet. Nice Job!"
"Mouthfeel: Nice medium feel, lighter than I'd expect as a barleywine. Dry alcohol rolls around the mouth and leaves that numbing/prickly feeling."
"D: Considering the sweetness this is a surprisingly drinkable beer. That been said, I probably would not buy another one -- not so much because of any real faults in this beer, but this style doesn't appeal to me that much. I found myself not wanting to finish it after I poured the second half of the 22oz. bomber. (I might like it more in a 12oz. bottle.)"
"Regardless of the complexity, this is an easy to drink beer. It is VERY deceptive given the alcohol content (9.9%!!). I could not note the usual oiliness or aftertaste of alcohol. Drink this one with some caution."
"I'd still say it's worth a try and I'd rate it a little above average overall..."
"The beauty of this beer is how cheap it is. I paid $3.50 for a 22 oz. bottle. Lagunitas is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries, especially for how inexpensive they tend to be."
"Overall; very drinkable with a good, clean mouthfeel. The mouth is left with a slight oil feel but with a sugar sweet finish."
"Mouthfeel is thin with carbonation."
"pours a redish amber color with a two finger beige head that settled to a half inch tight bubbled head to the finish with lots of lacing. smell of brown shugga, slight citrus and floral aromas and alcohol. taste is very sweet sugar and toffee and some citrus maybe oranges on the back of the palate. mouthfeel is thick, syrupy and weak on carbonation. the 9.90 abv limits the drinkability but i would buy it again for a high test pick me up."
"Not really what I was expecting. This beer leaves a metal odd finish in your mouth that really takes away from everything. I was expecting a sweeter beer also and this is very dry. There are some toffee, and fruit flavors that are hard to fit. I'm not sure I'll be trying this beer again."
"we have Ian Brown on the Hi-Fi with some golf on the TV . Bottle has dog on label and cap and it looks like "" Pete "" from Our Gang . Aroma is instant as cap is taken off . My sense of smell is not that good but I could smell this before cap was put down . I smell raisins , sugar , & molasses . Like treacle bread . My first gulp is pleasant and nice lacing present on glass . Slick mouthfeel and sweet on the end . Just not sweet enough ( which I already am but ..) . I like sweet but this was not my type . This brew is not what I was looking for ."
"D---A little less then average is the best way I can describe this."
"Reddish brown beer, not quite clear, topped by a short, light tan head. Fine bubbles formed some lacing, foam reduced quickly to a solid ring. Caramel, toffee, and grapefruit aromas hit the nose first, with notes of orange and alcohol becoming more apparent as it warmed. There were also some tropical fruit/fruit punch aromas as well. Solid bitterness with sweet toffee and grassy hops. Fruit character was much more restrained and was mostly citrus. Light molasses flavour towards the end, but it finished strongly bitter with a little alcohol warmth. Medium bodied, medium/low carbonation that resulted in a creamy texture. Some dryness. A decent beer, but the high bitterness doesn't really let the malt character show very well."
"Drinkability: this beer got a bit annoying as the bottle emptied. The sweetness just got tiring. A 10 oz glass was enjoyable, but goes downhill during the refill."
"Lagunitas, I'm with you: this beer is a mistake. Not to be repeated. Other offerings from this brewery are much better. My 2 cent review. Cheers!"
"Much better than I expected and I could feel the 9.9% ABV pretty quick."
"Pours clear reddish-orange with a quick-to-vanish tan head and thin lacing. The aroma suggests caramel and brown sugar (duh) with and hint of nuts and a dash of nutmeg. Alcohol vapors rise from the glass. In the mouth, the beer displays an artful balance between the combined leafy / piney hops and brown-sugar malts. Finishes quite green and dry with a big pine hop bite. Body is medium-thick and slick; fairly strongly carbonated for something this big. An eclectic take on the american imperial pale ale."
"Not the all time best, but a beer worth checking out. This is a great choice to wash down a cheeseburger. Another fine selection from the brewers in Petaluma. Worth the try."
"As it warms up, thickens up. This is such an odd beer. The brown sugar of the name is almost palpable. It's not a repeat beer. It's way too sweet for me."
"This offering from Lagunitas pours a rusty brown leaving a thick frothy tan head that sticks with this brew. The aroma is toffee, caramel, brown sugar, leafy citrus hops. The taste is smooth on the palate, it hits you with some alcohal heat upfront, but it is not overwhelming it actually is pretty hidden for almost 10%. The beer then takes you to a sweet brown sugary feel that is offset by pungent citrus rind hops, medicinal in feel, that finishes with a cooked sugar, cookies, sweetness in the end this is another great offering from Lagunitas, one that is made for winter sipping."
"Poured a beautiful amber with a big three inch head into my weizen glass. almost got the whole bomber in. The smell is caramel malt with a minor hop backbone. Taste this was sweet at first but as i have consumed my palatte has become accustomed to it. There is a decent ammount of hops to balance the sweet. You usually do not see this ammount of sugar in a non Belgian beer. i fear the hangover. Due to the sweetness which borders on cloying and the fact that im drunk off of one bomber limits the drinkability."
"Drinkability - Alcohol is high at 9.9, bery nice beer. i enjoyed this one, slow drinking beer."
"A uniquely flavored brew for sure. I was gonna rate the drinkability lower because of the sweetness and the high abv, but come to think of it, this is one tastey brew that is a little too easy to drink."
"Drinkability- Fantastic. The Alcohol is very pronounced but overall a very tasty beer. This is a very unique beer that I would highly recommend if you ever run into it on tap."
"Smooth, yet simple mouthfeel opens up this sweet brew. Notes of the tropics (pineapple, fig and starfruit) couple with a tinge of warm alcohol. Sugar is apparent, though whether brown, or candied is difficult to discern. Finish is slightly bitter, though not to the extent of the 51.1 IBU's the bottle promises. It is nice to have the sweet balanced by the mild bitterness."
"Overall- Alcohol is too dominent. Maybe age it to mellow out the flavors."
"Very complex, deep and dark, with sweet dark character. Wonderful."
"Cheers!"
"Peace."
"Cheers!"
"Slainte!"
"Purchased at local liquor store unknowingly poured into chalice. Nice fluffy slightly off white head, with muffy lacing, head lingers about a centimeter from the surface. The body is a deep red with lots of dark sort of purply tones. Smells of malty sweetness, this doesn't really emanate a very thick malt rather a sweet malt with nice toast notes, the hops are not too over powering but provide a nice balance. Flavor is slightly thin and sort of a sharp sweet bitterness, which I'm sort of indifferent to. The mouthful is sort of flat and through that the sweet, sort of cough spryness gets a little not so tasty, but I have to give it props for a yummy hop burps. Honesty this could be useful, but I'm not sure I'll buy again worth a try though."
"D: Yes indeed. Well done America! A fine dark ale that satisfies my Belguim cravings."
"Pours an orange amber with a moderate head that fades quickly. Smell is quite alcoholic and with strong aromas of honey, some apricot, malt, and faint hops. The taste is very warming and with carmelized brown sugar flavors balanced by lots of hops.Its just a little bit sweet, not at all overwhelmingly so. The alcohol is very well hidden. Absolutely delicious balance between sweet and bitter. Mouthfeel is full bodied but not thick. Not sticky. Good carbonation. Very drinkable- perilously so."
"This was OK, nothing special, with an edge of the brown suger in the taste. Initially above average foam, and a bit of colour. Average mouthfeel and drinkability. Of course, on the sweeter side, with sweet characteristics, caramel and the like. A decent beverage, only big in the alcohol.As a barleywine, this is quite smooth."
"Pours a crystal clear ruby-brown with gorgeous, jewel-like highlights. Thick but small head that fades to a dusting and collar. Aromas of pears and yeast, along with a bit of zesty sweetness. On the palate, bitterness and brisk carbonation start things off, followed by thick, sugary sweetness and a touch of bitterness at the back of the tongue. Some chocolatey sweetness at the very end. Not very complex, however -- it's mostly just varying levels and characteristics of sweetness. Mouthfeel is marked by slick malts, alcholic heat, and prickly carbonation, with the alcoholic detracting signficiantly. Overall, this beer is nothing to shout about. It's curious to see what this much brown sugar does to a beer, but it's not necessarily pleasing. It needs more balance and a bit more complexity to be truly compelling."
"Poured into a small tulip glass a clear deep reddish orange with a tight one finger head that stuck nicely to the glass as it settled slowly into a slight off white soapy-like mass.Ahh there are some hops in there and lots of em big and piney in the nose over top ofsweet and caramel and brown sugar with hints of cherry as well.Somewhat sweet at the offset mainly caramel malt and dark fruit with underlying notes of brown sugar these flavors meld very nicely into a viney,sprucey hoppy finish that lingers nicely.A great American strong ale with a nice American hop profile,not as sweet as I had thought it would be and thats ok with me another good one from Lagunitas."
"I bet bottles of this would age very well. I'll have to pick a few up next time I see it. I assume the keg on hand was fresh, and its already got a bit of that sherry agedness to it. Very nice. I'd like to buy this by the gallon and watch my entire saturday slip into hazy orange oblivion."
"Pours a light chestnut in color, there are some orange and amber highlights. A thin, yet creamy off-white head that settles a bit. The nose is coupled with freshly squeezed orange juice, nuts and sweet malts; some caramelized brown sugar is also detected during warming. Very creamy and lip smacking sweet; thick and lucious malts, with a near medicinal hops backbone. Becomes a bit dry, but more flavors emerge in the way of brown sugar, and sticky maple syrup. Traces of alcohol, but they add to the flavor and body. One of the best strong ales that you can find; a nice winter sipper and great tasting beverage!"
"D-Definately a big beer with big flavor. Easy to drink for something of this size and IBUs. Not an everyday'r, but a wonderful example of a neo-american strong ale."
"I plan on having a few of these and leaving the rest for some other time.I dont thik i have gotten a taste for these types of beers yet.The booze taste really takes away from the enjoyment of drinking this stuff.This is nothing new, just to me it taste alot like ABA. Ill try some more of it later on."
"It's a lot better than I thought it would be. I was expecting something a little more dopplebock like but I was pleasantly surprised by the hop and fruit character this beer presents."
"Drinkability: The alcohol is a bit much for this brew. I could see it benefiting from a year or two in the cellar."
"this is gold to some, but i'm not sure i fit in that category. i'll stick it in the cellar"
"M&D - not quite smooth, but it doenst try to be, bitter and sweet a great battle instead of a blend, a great play on the tongue, very nice, lagunitas brews well"
"The taste is quite big with hops, a huge malt backbone, and a dry, sweet finish. The finish is where this beer gets its name, as it does almost taste like brown sugar. I honestly had no idea this beer was nearly 10%, as you can't taste the alcohol at all. The mouthfeel was clean, and the finish was dry. Overall this is a nice, warming brew with hops and sugars battling it out on your palate for supremecy."
"Light, coppery color. Nice small head that leaves some great lacing on down the glass. Hoppy aroma, sweet smelling. Big hoppy flavor blended with a bevvy of malt in the backround. Nice sweet flavor to it. Faint, faint alcohol note to it in the finish. Nice body. The whole package comes together quite well. Have wanted to try this for ages. Got a bottle from beerrun13 in a trade and a bottle from my Secret Santa callenak. Well worth trying on a regular basis."
"Overall, interesting and sweet. Lagunitas never lets me down; that said I don't think I'll be buying it again."
"Drinkability: Brown Shugga', how come you taste so sweet? Do that line in the tune of the Rolling Stones classic. This is another one of those beers that would only be good once in a while. It is good, but it's a bit too sweet for my taste buds. It you adore sweet beers, then by all means pick this one up immediately."
"Overall I found this to be a tasty that creates an _obvious_ warmth when you drink, from mouth the whole way down to stomach, lingering. I can feel it warming my head as well. This is a hefty brew that is somewhat overwhelming, its strength seeming to play out more so than its depth of flavor."
"The aftertaste is a bit much for me. Too sweet for my dry tastes."
"This is a very good winter beer."
"D: Definitely a strong ale but good enough for seconds . Pleasing, well-balanced (sweet with a potent hop kick) and a high gravity. Try one - you may find yourself having another."
"Mouthfeel- Easy palate and very well incorporated alcohol."
"Brown Shugga could take some getting used to, but I think I could really like this stuff. The alcohol comes across with such a heavy vodka-esque bite."
"One of the things I get most excited for during the holidays is the release of this beer. Such a good flavor, and at 10% it leaves you feeling terrific. Pours a light copper color with a light head and seemingly endless bubbles. The smell is malty, with a hint of nut and some fruit as well (although nothing distinct). The taste is big and warm. Mostly the best parts of a brown ale with lots of candied sugars, and the alcohol is nowhere to be found. You can tell this beer is made with care. The aftertaste is pleasant, but very monolithic and leaves something to be desired in terms of variability. Overall a terrific beer."
"I find this brew pretty decent, but lacking heart. The alcohol is too high for the flavors expressed."
"Hazy seared caramel. Thick, dense soft tan head of mixed size bubbles that stands steady and is topped with a fine cream-like layer. Eventually it starts to fall leaving thick pock marked lace on the glass and coming to rest at a thin collar with some dust. Minimal sluggish carbonation streams rise. Sweet brown sugar, pine sap, and prickly alcohol aromas. Piney hop resin washes across the tongue dropping sweet brown sugar bombs before fading into the back behind warm alcohol. The hops come to fill out all aspects of the flavor and when coupled with the alcohol, it attains an almost pine-sol like solvency. Not particularly smooth, the pine adds a rough-cut texture to the medium-full body. The fine carbonation eases the drinkability somewhat. The finish comes to be filled out with an almost medicinal alcohol flavor laced with pine that leaves me wondering where the brown sugar sweetness went. This was an okay beer, but I probably wont be revisiting in the future."
"I'm a little underwhelmed after trying this one. I guess i was expecting something a little sweeter under the guise of a brown ale made with raw (brown)sugar. This one disappoints."
"D- This beer has an interesting flavor and I can see where it gets its name. It would be nice to have some big flavors that balance with the sweetness."
"Copper color with a nice fluffly white head. Aroma is has a nice sweet malt with a bit of hops and alcohol. Flavor is with brown sugar dominance with a bit of molasses and some citrus tones. Alcohol is very noticeable after finishing only one. There is a definite presentation of malt and has a sweet finish."
"I like it."
"mixed with a splash of brown sugar. All the desciptions sound like this beer would be very sweet but the 55.1 ibu (hops) keep this in check. The big magic trick is how well the 9.9 abv. doesn't overwelm this well balanced Strong Ale."
"Clearish brown with a hint of red. A little viscous. Nose is alcohol, some malts, and sweetness. Almost like a malty wine. Taste is like a bitter barley wine. Has hints of smoke, sweetness is there but not too overdone, and hops in the finish. Alcohol is hidden pretty well in the taste (although not in the nose). Not bad."
"While strong, I would definietly order this up again. I nice beer to sip after dinner, perhaps."
"D - I enjoyed this beer but the sweetness that lingers on the tongue makes it tough for me to give it a better score. I don't think I could drink more than 1 of these in a sitting."
"D - I wouldnt say its a session brew, but its still decent."
"Consume fresh!"
"Had this on tap at the Map Room in Chicago. It was their ""featured"" tap when i visited. Poured with really no head, just a ring of bubbles. looks fairly barley-wine-y, which is what the map room described the beer as being. brown, syrupy look to it. smell is sweet...they served it cold so that's all i got at virst and when it warmed up...still just sweet, maybe some brown sugar specific sweetness coming through. Taste is first just like sugar water and alcohol. Sweet and mildly fruity and very dry on the finish after every sip. Mouthfeel becomes, as a result, very sticky. almost like liquified sugar in vodka. overall, it was ok, but a bit sweet and dry. I might like it if it was aged and the flavor profile become a bit more complex."
"Pretty good brew."
"Good, interesting big beer. Went well with some Roquefort."
"Fullbodied and somewhat drinkable. A bit sweet, but not cloying."
"Overall a balanced flavorful brew. The high ABV is dangerously concealed. A tasty treat that I will be returning to."
"Very drinkable Strong Ale, Lagunitas is quickly becoming one of my new favorites breweries."
"Pours a pretty burnt orange color topped by a half-inch of creamy ecru head that sticks around for the duration. Aroma of crisp floral hops, sweet caramel malt, and a touch of brown sugar. Palate is initially sweet, with caramel malt and a considerable amount of brown sugar intensifying mid-palate. A light spiciness comes through right before the swallow, finishing with a good amount of warming alcohol. Body is smooth and creamy, quite enjoyable. On the whole a good beer, but be careful - the well-masked alcohol can sneak up on you."
"The mouthfeel was light and drinkability high. This is quite a feat considering the strength. I do see a promise of improvement here with some aging, although I am not sure this will hold up for the really long haul."
"Mouthfeel is good. A little parched, but an adequate body and good carbonation. Drinkability is perhaps the most notable part of this brew. Cant taste the booze. Simple, trashy, and lovely."
"Fairly cloudy in the glass, orangy, with a decent head that melted away fairly quickly. The nose is nice and sweet; smells like spent grain. The taste is not real exciting, complex but transitions through a sort of medicinal phase before finishing with a fruity tang. The mouthfeel is good but too heavy to be very drinkable. I'm not sure where I got this but I know it wasn't recently; perhaps this bottle is a little old."
"Beer poured a reddish brown with a surprisingly nice head that is leaving a good lacing behind. Nose is of sweet malts with hints of dark fruits. Taste is very interesting. There is a big presence of sweet malts, dark fruits, and a fair amount of hops. Mouthfeel is full and very smooth. Drinkability is good. This is one of the most interesting beers I have tried in awhile. It is a combination of Arrogant Bastard, Belgian Strong Ale, and Barleywine. The abv is huge. One is enough for me even though a second one would be mighty tasty."
"Pours a nice dark amber and copper color, clear, with a good size cream-yellow head. Aroma is sweet honey and a little caramel, cereal and a hint of booze. Hops are more evident in the taste but heavier on the malt side with some sweet grapey-ness, and rich caramel malts. A nice spicy alcohol bite in the finish. I have really been enjoying some high alcohol malt bombs recently so this beer is going down quite easily."
"red copper hue , nose of light hops , sweet and clean, taste is chewy with a sweet/ sour and metallic thing going on, sweet shugga finish, on of my personal favorites red copper hue , nose of light hops , sweet and clean, taste is chewy with a sweet/ sour and metallic thing going on, sweet shugga finish, on of my personal favorites"
"Scarily drinkable, I think my taste buds could handle one more bomber, but the brain cells might be ready for a break after that."
"A sweet, strong ale, but not overdone. The brown sugar, nutmeg profile is the focal point which draws from the ale's other flavor aspects, but the abv % is remarkably well hidden."
"A fairly drinkable beer although it does get a bit hot as it warms."
"Off to meet Lew and his missus ..."
"Drinkability: Please dont get me wrong, I am a huge fan of big ales but this train wreck is horribly disgusting. Not one of my favorites and I suggest that this beer should be avoided at all cost unless your looking for a buzz free of flavor. I love this brewery but this offering is just way off base."
"12 oz. bottle, 9.9% ABV. Very little carbonation upon opening the bottle. Pours a slightly hazy copper color, with a thick tan head. Great head retention.Robust aroma, caramel, citrusy and piney hops. Very nice aroma. Caramel flavors, sugary and robust. Strong candy like hop flavors, citrusy and piney. Slight alcohol warming. Hints of sweetness from the brown sugar shine as the beer warms. Medium body, with low carbonation. This is a gem."
"Although slightly different than I remember the beer is still excellent and highly drinkable. That said, its ABV can be more potent that it appears and the sweetness and chewy mouthfeel really come thru (together with the ABV) as the beer warms."
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass, a deep burnished copper two fingers of off-white head, nice retention, nice sheets of lacing left behind. Nose fits the name, lots of sweet brown sugar, slightly caramel, with a slight alcohol soaked fruitiness. Some floral hops start to come through after you've acclimized yourself to the sweetness. Taste mirrors the nose with a strong sugary sweet malt upfront, slightly biscuity, slightly fruity with a decently hoppy finish merging with a not unpleasant bite of alcohol. Full bodied and smooth, this is a nice enjoyable sipping beer. Overall, dangerously so, as I could easily drink several of these high octane beers."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is full bodied. The beer is definately a sipper. The alcohol is definately present in the mouthfeel of the beer. If you do not respect this beer it will kick your ass. The beer is definately a beer treat. I cannot see myself drinking more than one of these in a evening."
"An exceptional brew! Rich caramel in appearance with a small head. Beautifully sweet maly aroma with hops undertones. Taste Sweet malt presence blends into a mid-hop burst..finsihing in a hop finish with a tad of sweetness remaining. Alcohol was present but by no means overpowering. Smoooth with a great dry finish. Mouthfeeel was excellent for such a high abv."
"I would be lying if I said I expected hops, even with the IBU listed on the bottle, but a heavy, sweet malt presence upfront with a light, hoppy bitterness The finish is reminiscent of an English Barleywine with a faint alcohol flavor and light, hoppiness. The flavors mellowed and intertwined as the beer warmed. This is a quality beer, and potentially the best I've come to from Lagunitas."
"Drinkability: While the sweetness is not cloying, it does limit the amount of this beer you will want to consume; otherwise, quite intriguing"
"Red-orange. Fairly dynamic aroma, full of malt (caramel, pit fruit, toffee), hops (resin, grapefruit), along with a huge dose of brown sugar. Flavor is very much lke the regular Old Gnarleywine, with an added sugary malty sweetness. Less resiny and less hoppy overall, but still very hoppy. Still coating and very flavorful. An enjoyable beer, but it has its flaws."
"12.08.13 - party favor bottle, a nicely citrus hoppy, brown sugary strong ale, easy to drink, scores left intact"
"Considering how huge this beer is the abv is hidden amazingly well. Need to be careful with this one."
"This was a wonderful beer. First was the smell of the beer, it was great smelling a little sweet. The first taste was a little shocking, a lot stronger that I was expecting. But after the intial shock, this beer was great. A very strong taste, with a nice hop flavor. Also the slite sweetness that accompanied was excellent. Try this beer, it's seasonal so keep your eyes open for this one!"
"For a beer thats pretty much 10% ABV, this one goes down real easy. Worth a try if youre a fan of IPAs or ASAs. This is my 1st Lagunitas beer, but it definately wont be my last."
"Another great beer from Lagunitas, one of California's more underrated breweries."
"Tasty stuff from a Brewery that I am just learning about. Brown Sugga' doesn't have too much actural brown sugar in it, but it does have a serious malt base that hinges on caramel and toffee. An amber / copper color with a fleeting head shows nice lacing. Aromas of nuts, figs, and dates decorate the nose. Similar flavors show more intensely. Lightly licorice-like. Big hop contribution, along with a lighter than usual body, becomes very IPAish. Nevertheless, a tasty brew that's easy on the palate. Thanks Clvand0 for sharing."
" Taste is complex, strong fruity malt, moderately hopped, brown sugar does not overwhelm the rest of the flavors. Mouthfeel is smooth, drinkability good. I will age the rest for a short time."
"Very tasty stuff that goes down easy but be warned, this is a truly strong ale, one of a kind in it's style! Try it, you'll never know till you do...I recommend this one."
"D - tasty brew, I wouldn't mind having several of these. Alcohol is masked in the flavor pretty well, but will hit you later."
"Drinkability: I'm glad I tried this. ASAs are becoming brews that many breweries seem to be experimenting with in fantastic ways (and / or have been for a while). That I like a lot, and this is a great effort, and if I do purchase this again, as I said before, I'm definitely throwing it in the cellar. However, for the price and the experience, it was definitely a great purchase. Looking forward to more Lagunitas brews, as this was my first."
"D - This is the 2nd time I've had this from the bottle and it seemed much better the first time I had it. My judgement may be a little skewed since I drank it fairly warm. Not a bad beer. My first barelywine and definitely not the last."
"This pours a cloudy dark brownish red amber with a nice lacy head. The smell has a fruity,molasses and alcohol scent to it. The taste is like the smell,but I could taste a very strong alcohol presence. The m/f is heavy with all the flavors being well balanced. This is a damn good beer and I'm really glad I had a chance to have it on tap at Eli Cannon's."
"drinkability is great!...I would'nt recommend having too many of these in one sitting though, it is quite high in abv."
"It's very good , but it's almost too sweet to finish the whole 22 oz...but I did."
"rich, cocoa-tinged flavors, full, lush, very tasty..."
"Deep walnut brown with about a finger of brown head. The brown sugar (duh :) ) stands out most in the aroma, but there is also some toffee, some piney hops, and a light fruitiness. Distinct brown sugar flavor along with some fruit and a nice hoppy bite. Just a slight hint of alcohol that comes out a little more as it warms. It's pretty easy to drink given it's strength!"
"UPDATE: 1 Year and 1 day from original review. My last bottle from the original six pack; it's aged a year- that should help, right? Still heavy sweetness and alcohol burn. I do not like this, and I don't know why I keep trying. Drain pour. Scores adjusted accordingly."
"A hazey dark amber beer with orange highlights. Has a big creamy off white head and a touch of lace. There is a piney hop character to the aroma right up front. Then in the background is a sweet malty note. The flavor starts with a big rush of brown sugar sweetness on the tip of your tongue. Followed by a nice piney hop bite along the sides of your tongue and into the back of your throat. But it is that sweet sugar character that stays with you."
"Drinkability is really good. A bit high in the alcohol to have too many, but I'd definately pick this up fairly often if it was available to me. A good example of a strong ale, but with extra hops. Aging this could prove interesting to let the hops settle down and some of the malt and brown sugar flavors to come through."
"Overall, I was not too impressed. The flavors did not balance well, rather harsh and raw and too sweet for my tastes. I didn't much enjoy it."
"As said before, the body is really thick and vicious. The flavors come out but are sometimes dominated by the shear weight of this liquid. This is definitely a sipper. Take time, relax, and enjoy this during the colder times of the year."
"aw, who gives a fuck. this still an A+ beer and one i'd be happy to rereview every year until it disappears.. at bare minimum, ill be drinking it annually."
"Overall, this is an interesting beer to try. It's so damn filling, and the alcohol is present enough, that I'd say this makes for a good afternoon snack, but this is a really hearty beverage and I'm going to save the rest of the bottle for another time - dessert, maybe."
"Drinkability: like i said ther alcohol is hidden very well, and this a very unique beer that i wish i had readily available to me."
"Here's a shout out to the LBB for the sample. Thanks bud."
"An interesting beer, not what i expected. Big, nice hoppy residual taste, sweet up front, but nice bitter after-taste. Not really barley wine [to me at least], but not really anything else. Not for the faint at heart, or for those unwilling to try something different."
"Drinkability is outright dangerous for the alcohol content."
"This beer poured a clear red amber color and formed a nice off white foamy head that vanished quickly coating the glass with lace. A small amount of carbonation was present. An aroma of malt, caramel, and some sweets that I guess is brown sugar. The flavor was of malt, a toasted caramel aspect and some elements of brown sugar. The body was lighter than I was expecting and the finish was bittersweet. If this beer is really 9.9 %, it hides it very well. Really no trace the the heavy alcohol is noticeable."
"From the first the malt and sugar flexed their muscles, but never overdid the workout, steering clear of ever cloying and ruining the mood, a well-timed directional shift enabled by the sufficient and tasty hops profile. Granted, you might want to be in the mood for the syrupy sucrose sensation it creates, but combined with the hefty but never obnoxious ABV, it makes for a nice warmer in the colder times. But make note- that ABV is sneaky because of just how masked it seems, so caution is recommended. Still, we're all big kids here, so one or two seems a pleasant way to spend some time in front of the fire. Brown Sugga...how come you taste so good?"
"This label declares this ale to be an experiment. As far as I can tell, the data shows that this beer rocks."
"Not my favorite, but a solid barleywine (or strong ale, whichever it is now) nonetheless and a nice job by the folks at Lagunitas."
"Pours into a pint glass lighter than expected, transparent ""whiskeyish"" copper and yellow with a nice barely off-white head which leaves some nice lacing after recession. Nose has clear brown sugar hints as well as hoppy fruity aromas, also slight boozy hint which cleans the sinus'. Taste is smooth and thick with sugary sweet flavors suggesting honey or even maple syrup. Mouthfeel is full with very well hidden alcoholic esters, like many have pointed out, at almost 10 percent this is one easy drinking brew....definitely tread lightly with this one. A very high caliber brew from lagunitas."
"Cheers!"
"This is pretty easy to drink. The only detractions are the alcohol in the flavor and the high ABV. It's a decent brew overall."
"I actually think that the 2004 version is better, but this is still outstanding. I would like to age a few of these, but I don't think I could resist the temptation."
"A tasty sipper of a beer here which is quite mild to me but I am sure Hop exposure has thrown of my taste a little bit. Probably not the thing to serve a Budweiser drinker. I like it though."
"Lagunitas' Imperial Red is one of my favorite brews and this is pretty much a ""Double Imperial Red"" with all the flavors amp'ed up. While it's quite tasty and very drinkable, the high ABV does detract a bit from the beer - first because you get pretty useless pretty damn fast but also because they didn't really tame the alcohol burn very well - it's a bit too obvious in the flavor mix.."
"Usually I don't rate this style of beer high on drinkability but this one is different. I am very happy with this brew and will happily drink my share. But with almost 10% ABV you have to be careful, this one will do you in quickly."
"Lagunitas once again impresses."
"650 ml bottle, with an always entertaining if somewhat maniacal ""story"" behind Brown Shugga on the label's side. On the front it says this is a ""messed up"" Gnarlywine. Tasted at room temperature. Popping the green cap gives a whiff of strong and very sweet maltiness. This beer poured nicely, with low carbonation, producing a creamy light brown head which was moccha like in that it seemed to have streaks of lighter whites swirling. Rings of lacing which stuck instantly and seemed very viscous. The beer is a light, dusty ruby red. Dark nectarine, or light strawberry in certain light. An attractive beer without question. The aroma is very similar to a good barleywine. The phenols are always there, and the aroma tickles the nose with its strength. Heavy malts, but a definite kick of strong hopping is also present, adding an earthiness and a dryness I have not smelt in too many barleywines, or, like Brown Shugga, barleywine hybrids. Thick burnt caramel, red wine, the inevitable licorice and and creamy root beer. The northwest hops always add a nice balance to the heavy malting. The aroma is quite sweet, yes, but not as much as I thought it might be with the addition of brown sugar. The sugar can definitely be smelt, however. Smelling very closely, a very refreshing note of citrus, mixed with red grapes. Other aromas include rice pudding, mollasses, and fresh cinnamon buns. The taste is delectably full and satisfying in its maltiness, but the hops play their part perfectly here too. The syrupy malts come first, sugary and bursting with brown sugar and licorice flavours. In the middle the citrus hops come again and combined with the malts give a chocolate-orange combination which is incredible. I paired this beer with St Paulin cheese from France, and the light nutiness of the cheese made the chocolate and especially the orange come through in the beer magnificently. I would recommend the pairing. The alcohol is masked quite well up until the finish, when the bitterness, almost vodka-like in its bite, creeps up on you. The taste too is barleywine with perhaps an added sweetness. Burnt toast and cinnamon, maple syrup and a load of mollasses. The mouthfeel is definitely full, with extremely low carbonation, making it quite syrupy. Despite its near-10% abv, this is very drinkable, but with caution. It warms the stomach rather rapidly. A beer I wish was more widely available in Alberta(for now, only one store in Calgary has the exclusive rights to sell it). It also paired well with 3-year aged cheddar. A definite re-drinker, and cellaring a few for a year or two sounds mighty prudent."
"Slàinte!"
"I've contemplated cracking this bottle open on many occasions over the past year. I'm glad I waited though. I have no doubt that time has been more than kind and has turned the beer into the glorious exilir that I'm enjoying so much today. I would love to have a case or two sleeping in my cellar right this very moment. Brown Shugga', how come you taste so good?"
"Pours a hazy glowing crimson with an ivory froth that dissipates quickly, leaving nothing in its wake. Aroma is candy sweet, with notes of mint, brown sugar, and the alcohol, as Ron Burgundy would say, ""stings the nostrils."" Texture is extremely chewy with mild hints of carbonation on the back on the tongue. Alcohol becomes more present as it warms, but slightly cold is hardly noticeable in the flavor. Starts off peppermint sweet, with some hop bitterness, but not enough to balance the sweetness from the sugar. Still, for some reason this is exactly what hits the spot right now, and I think it's delicious. Drinkability is good despite the booze because it's just so damn tasty. This is one of those beers that you just know would be mighty interesting from the tap, or better yet, hand pumped from the cask. Mmmmm."
"This beer pours a cloudy orange brown with a lot of sediment. The off white head fades a little fast, leaving a good lacing. It smells slightly of alcohol. It has a sweet aroma. I can smell a good toasted malt scent. It has a slight raisin like aroma. This beer has a malty taste. Quite malty. I can only detect the alcohol a bit. It warms my throat slightly as it goes down. It has a sweet caramel taste. Not too much for hop flavor though. I can also taste some brown sugar, hence the name Brown Shugga'. This beer is full bodied. It goes down smooth leaving a malty sweet aftertaste. I dont think this beer would make the greatest session beer. It is higher in alcohol, and the flavor is sort of aggressive, and might wear thin after a little while. As for just one, this beer is pretty good. I am glad that I tried it. If you see it, it is worth a try."
"Another fine brew (even if by accident) from Lagunitas...my second favorite next to Gnarleywine...go figure."
"Pours a two-fingered light tan head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Clear amber color. Brown sugar nose. Medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Starts sweet but complex flavor, hops are here balancing the brown sugar and malts, the high ABV is not noticeable. Good beer to savor. $5.45 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Taste is initially sweet and rather hot with alcoholic burn, with some piney and sharp citrus hops kicking in the background as well. The middle brings on thick dark brown sugar, sticky sweet and lightly caramelized. Not quite as complex as a barleywine but very tasty in its own right as something a little different. Finish is nicely bitter, warming, with lingering hints of biscuit and vanilla."
"Yet an other great example of what American craft beer is about ... sip and enjoy."
"It's ok, dog."
"It's unusual, and devilishly enticing. Not to be missed!"
"poured a hazy deep reddish orangy color witha skim of a head. syrupy and sugary aroma...mmm....brown sugar?!!? with some alcohol in there as well. hoppy bitterness at first in the taste followed by some alcohol hottness. mouthfeel isn't as thick as expected, sugar seems to have left the beer a bit on the dry side in the taste and body and has a dry warming finish."
"Deep red colour... almost brown. Strong malty aroma, with a faint hint of citrusy hops. This is one sweet beer, but not in a cloying way. Flavors of carmel malts and molasses are dominant, with just enough hop bitterness to keep things from going off the deep end. No alcohol flavors (although there was some present in the aroma as it warmed up), but I could sure feel some warming sensations in my chest as I drank it."
"With the high alcohol content of this guy and how harsh it seemed to me, I doubt I could drink more than one. But I should try it again in case it was just a bad pour."
"Taste: Beyond the obvious malt sweetness and alcohol prickliness, this Beer had a woody, green leaf mouthfeel, it left a acidic sensation that reminds me of an arugula and spinach salad. It canceled out most of the cloying sugars."
"Drinkability: For me, OK; for the townspeople... dunno. This is a wacky brew; it almost like a pre-aged barleywine. It's so big and so sweet, though -- this one will do it for me. Again, all hail the bravest brewery in the US."
"I won't be able to finish this big bottle. Doubt I'll even get through the first pint I poured out of it. Not what I'm looking for in a beer."
"I loved this beer. It was basically a barleywine with a slight twist. The beer poured a very dark red color with a huge frothy head that lasted till the last sip. The smell was quite sweet with molasses dominating the scent as well as the flavor, but not in a bad way. The flavor was sweet no doubt, but it hd enough bitterness in the finnish to offset the great sweetness. The mouthfeel was quite thick and not balanced out with enough carbonation IMO. But that would be my only complaint. It's a must try."
"22 ounce bottle, no freshness dating. Purchased at Wine Warehouse in Charlottesville, VA for $4.49."
"Drinkability and Overall: The only thing that hurts the drinkability on this one is the alcohol presence in the belly. It's a suprise. Other than that, this is a pretty killer beer. One of the best from Lagunitas I've had. Thanks to GClarkage for the bottle!!"
"Overall impression: This is a very interesting twist on a standard barley wine. I definitely enjoyed it, and it is very drinkable considering the ABV. Might be too sweet to drink more than a couple, but at almost 10 % ABV that probably isn't the best idea anyways!"
"Ok, so maybe I really was interested in getting this cause I like saying the name! Well, I also have always loooved anything with brown sugar in it too! Poured out amber an semi-unclear with a nice huge froth of milkshakey, creamy colored head with a huge froth and a few bubbles showing and moon crater layer. Tons of lacing that started immediately and went all they way down. Nice malty scents with hoppy bites but not too much going on. Smooth and thick, creamy, but not too heavy. Feel silky with the carbonation coming out and just gliding over your tongue. I was really wondering if this would be too sweet, but nope. You get a taste of dark brown sugar -not as deep as molasses, just caramelly dark, with peppery hops. Twinges of orange rind in the background. This one may be a bit heavy to sit down with as a sesssion, but it is damn nice as a sipper, and for a few in the evening."
"Interesting idea with messing up a batch of barley wine and brewing it with a crap load of brown sugar. Deep reddish body with a decent sized white foamy head. Think sticky rings of lace around the glass as the head held fast. Sweet toasty malt with strong sugary notes, from all the brown sugar I am guessing. Some alcohol it noticeable and it also smells of a slight cinnamon. A touch of earthy hops round it out. An odd but pleasant smelling brew. The flavor is similar to the nose with a big sweet component from the sugars and the malts. Light fruitiness is there and a bit of alcohol and some bitter bops. Quite an interesting mix and the brown sugar is obvious. Ends on a slight alcohol bite with a touch of fruit sweetness. About a full bodies brew with a sticky feel. Pretty good stuff but I dont think I could have another one afterwards, it would become cloying. I would have it again in the future though, good stuff."
"Overall, I found this to be a rather easy drinking barleywine, but not strongly flavored as other beers of it's style."
"on tap at the BTAH in NYC, Poured copper, nose of dried fruit and some caramel. More caramel and sweet notes of brown sugar and cookie dough. Yes, this is a fairly sweet barley wine. Some drying elements come in late and as it warms, Smooth, medium bodied brew. Some warming alcohol also present. Too sweet for me. When I ordered this one somebody asked if I had diabitis"
"Pours a short copper colored head that recedes quickly. Body is slightly hazy deep brownish red. Strong aroma of cherries and molasses, grassy/citrus hops, lots of alcohol and red grapes. Big blast of sweetness, brown sugar? Heck yeah, and well supported by a strong bitterness. Light doughy yeastiness. Full body, light carbonation. I consider this the chewiest of the chewy. Goes down slow and sticky, lingering medicinal taste."
"This beer is pretty enjoyable, and I like that it is not too sticky sweet. It reminds me a lot of the first sample of their IPA that I had, because the IPA tasted like it had lots of unfermented wort in it, and I almost wonder if I had a bottle of the Brown Shugga' that had been mislabeled. Regardless, I do like this beer and I certainly recommend it if you find it."
"Notes: When I mess things up, I can only pray that they will turn out this good.. Maybe not a barleywine, but a good beer indeed."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/8"" tan head over the cloudy dark amber brew. Head fades to an uneven layer of bubbles pretty quickly, but exhibits average lacing. Aroma is whoa, all about sweetness and powerful alcohol. Taste actually throws me for a loop, showing sweet malts as expected, but then fruitiness, and nary a taste of the distracting ethanol-laden nose. Mouthfeel and drinkability are very nice for the style. For a slow start this one came on as the experience went on. Worth a try, almost too drinkable..."
"Big thanks to absolutesites for this one!"
"Another treat from Watermelonman! I am sampling a 22 oz bottle in a tulip glass at room temp. The beer pours a clear copper and mahogany color with a large off white head foaming up easily. Aroma is grassy hops mixing with caramel and brown sugar. Some lite alcohol hits as well. First sip reveals an average carbonationand average body. Flavor starts malty sweet with caramel and brown sugar some raisins too. I find the finish to be very hoppy with pine and grass mixing leaving a dry bitter flavor on my tongue. Very easy drinking for 9.9 %. Quite a tasty brew and one I would track down again."
"From a 22 oz. brown ""Sweet Release"" bottle, I actually like the little blurb on the side of the bottle this time. This pseudo barleywhine pours out a very appetizing ruddy copper hue, hazed with suspended particles when held up to the light. Thick and creamy off-white head with good retention, and some massive sticky lacing. The nose is sweet with light malt and fruit, with some nut and dried fruit notes in it. And mango. Weird, I smell mango. Nice touch! This is also one very tasty mistake Lagunitas has on their hands. Boozy from the start, but mild, the malt blends very nicely with the hops, dancing cheek to cheek the whole way through. Sweet caramel malt coils itself around a refreshing fruity hop character, and they are both hepped up on a good dose of brown sugar, which helps them tango the whole night long. The sugar makes itself more apparent on the finish where it takes on a nutty flavour, and then recedes into a mild citrusy sunset of an aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light and very drinkable, but not watery, it holds its own over the palate. This Brown Shugga is deceptively drinkable, you have to know where you're going to stop before even going in, or suffer a high abv% brown sugar hangover catastrophe the next day. Not that I know anything about that, some guys told me about it once, no fooling. This Brown Shugga should definitely be chalked up to being what we call in the hot shop one of those ""happy accidents", that should henceforth be repeated time and again. A shame that it's only a seasonal, but happy to have it available even as far north as Calgary."
"This beer poured a bright copper to amber color, very clear with a nice cream colored head. Very dense for a barley wine. The aroma has the distinctive doughy character I find in all the offerings from Lagunitas (it must be the yeast). The nose also has some malt candy and figs from the malt and a light citrus/grapefruit character from the hops. The head settles nicely to a thick lace. The taste has a wonderful malty sweetness. More of the figs and hard candy character along with the doughy hints I detected on the nose. Mild hop bite, and just a hint of alcohol warming. Denser mouth feel than I anticipated. Nicely drinkable. Unusual, yet pleasing version of the barley wine style."
"I like. Very tasty and drinkable at 9.9% ABV. Pick this up if you see it on the shelves. I wouldn't go out of my way to find this, but its a good beer and a solid effort at the style."
"Oh, Brown Shugga', how come you taste so good?"
"Nice amber-brown body, clear, with a decent frothy head. Smell lightly or raosted malt, very sweet, minor floral hop. Tart hops at the end, roasted malt up front. Couldnt pick out a distinct brown sugar flavor but could tell from the overall sweetness (not sweet like DFH 120) that a decent amount of sugar was used. Mouthfeel is watery and light. Drinkability is smooth, ballanced, and sweet. What? this is a barleywine? i was thinking more of a Amber and Brown hybrid mix."
"Very tasty product, and quite enjoyable after shoveling out from a blizzard."
"Overall, a damn fine little barleywine from a brewery I'd previously written off. Maybe I need to give Lagunita's another chance..."
"nice dark copperwith a sticky tan head that laces well. caramel molasses smell. i notice a good amount of a fresh cut pineapple and mildy alcoholic smell too. very sweet up front, reminds me of a maple flavored frosting. brown sugar shows up big towards the middle with just a bit of dark fruit, fig, prune, and some pears. the herbal hops at the finish round things out some, but don't balance by any means. sort of thin bodied for the flavor. not too distracting, but noticable just the same. decent drinability, i think i'd prefer it in a 12 oz bottle though. not something i'd drink regularly, but a nice change of pace."
"Overall: Nice! Definitely one of the better special Limited Releases from Lagunitas. Well worth trying!"
"1/4-inch creamy, tight head at start. Brown hue, but light, verging on a copper tone with a touch of haze to the whole affair. Candy corn, raspberry jelly roll sweetness on nose with a determined alcohol hot tone. Woody, oak on mouth, with a covering of some fruity esters that consisted of orange, kiwi, and some tart lemon. Finishes with just a flavor of alcohol bite and a faint, mossy remainder."
"Pours a nice ruby / amber color with a fairly large white head that leaves a nice lace on the glass. Aromas consist of caramels and toffees with a mix of brown sugar and some piney resinous hops. Initial flavors start off quite sweet with a strong backing of caramels which is followed by a nice hint of vanilla. There is also a nice flavor throughout of brown sugary sweetness that almost has a toffee like aspect to it. The finish is totally west coast with a strong mix of citrus and piney hops that adds just enough bitterness to round things off. The body to this beer is completely fantastic with a great chewy / creamy like feel to it. Overall this brew wasn't the most amazingly complex or in your face beer but it was definetly a fantastic barleywine that just hits the spot..."
"Been looking forward to trying this one. Pours an amber color with a moderate head that has excellent retention and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. The aroma was of caramel malts, but nothing much more. I expected maybe some brown shugga... The flavor is somewhat caramel-like. Alcohol is apparent and there is a lot of sugar in the taste. Too much sugar. Slightly thin. Not a bad beer, but too sweet and thin."
"The beer poured a golden amber color with one finger of head that sticks around well after the pour. The nose was sweet caramel, not quite as deep as I want. Fairly one dimensional. The flavor had more hop than the nose would tell. The flavor was too sugary for me. The feel was too thin for a barleywine. I want at least a heafty moderate feel on this style. Overall, not a bad beer, but too sugary and not thick enough for me."
"Drinkability- A bit too much on the sweetness scale to me. I like my barleywines, and this was decent, but it feels like I need to chase this with some jolly ranchers stix and some fun dip."
"This ""sweet release"" fills the glass with a dark rusty copper, with bright orange highlights. Head is small, off-khaki, and doesn't last too long. Nose is made up of sweet, buttery caramal rolls, brown sugar (crazy, eh?), alcohol, and subdued vegetal/floral hops. Cake-icing sweet malt flavors start out. Sugary sweetness mixes with apple/pear brandy notes and toffee. Hops finally arrive near the finish to counter some of the sweetness. Medicinal/herbal hop bitterness isn't enough to handle the treacle sweetness. Add in the obvious alcohol presence and it's a little too cough syrupy for me. Mouthfeel is big and syrupy. Not bad, but not my kind of BW."
"Very drinkable for one so strong..maybe dangerously so!"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a large glass goblet. Golden reddish brown in color with a big tan head on top. There is a sweet caramel and molasses smell typical of a barley wine. The flavor is very potent with a sharp sweetness in the middle and lots of tangy, toffee, and carmel flavors throughout the beer. For an American Barley Wine it is a bit under hopped in my opinion. More than anything else is tangy and sweet and quiet enjoyable."
"Drinkability is pretty high. Had no idea what to expect with this one and it really was a pleasant surprise."
"""BANG ZAP POW!"""
"Pretty deep red/brown color, murkiness undercuts the appearance though, thick head with cascades of brown bubbles with an aggressive pour, caramel, sweet, nutty fragrance, taste was a cloying, sick molasses-like sweetness coupled with an overbearing alcohol punch, all other tastes were basically blotted out, mouthfeel was slimy and alcoholic, this beer ended up in the drain half way through, you shouldn't have to try this hard to like a beer"
"From a 12 oz bottle, it pours a reddish-brown with a fair-sized off-white head that lingers. The smell is hoppy with a noticeable hop smell that still seems somehow subdued. Having brewed with brown sugar, the smell and taste were familiar and welcome. On top of that are traces of caramel. Drinkability is scary for a 10% beer. Lagunitas is hit and miss, but this is a hit."
"Yeah, it has a definite alcohol flavor but there's a heckuva lot more sweeter barleywines out there. I, for one, could drink a lot of these. I wonder if the bottle is sweeter though...will find out in 2 weeks, when it hits the shelves in NYC."
"Very rich. Very sweet. The brown sugar added during the brewing permeates every aspect of this beer. It poured a color only of what I could describe as liquified brown sugar. A foamy head formed, and as I drank a sticky lace was on the glass. The aroma was of brown sugar. The flavor was of brown sugar. By the way, I like brown sugar. I used to sneak it out of the bowl as a kid when my Mom would bake. There were other tones in this beer: the malt was a nice backdrop flavor to the brown sugar. The only negative was that it was so rich and the alcohol was pretty strong I am not sure I could drink too many of these. My palate would be worn down."
"Super special note: Always check your boxes when a trade has made its way to your door! Thanks xlperro!"
"Nice taste, but I'm not convinced that this is an Strong/Old Ale."
"Drinkability/notes: Simply excellent, rich, full, and flavorful; a spectacular beer. Would be most pleasant on a cold and rainy day. Cellared for approximately nine months."
"The name, Brown Shugga, is not deceptive at all. It does a good job of characterizing this brew. This was an experience. I didn't drink a whole bottle, but instead shared one with about three guests (actually, I had tried it earlier at the Pizza Port Strong Ale festival in December and rather enjoyed it). Very robust malt blend with a brown sugar taste that gives way to a good hop and malt balance. This is a great desert beer. I think you could probably pour this over vanilla ice cream in a glass and have an interesting beverage."
"Appearance: Amber brown approach with a nice bulbous tan head leaves awesome sparatic lacing with each sip. Aroma: Vinous hops with caramel sugar slightly burn nose this beer is awesome, full malty approach to this old ale. Taste: Great amount of hops sugary with hops piney, earthy, citric tones this is a great old ale very nice brew can't be beat in my opinion. I want some of that Brown Sugga' baby, gives me sweet loving sweet sugary malt ridden flavor makes me want to have more of this brew. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied old ale from this brew I know what's coming my way complex flavors galore. Drinkability: Wow, how can you do this to common folk alot of flavor that most people aren't ready for however hallelejuah for this example of a kick ass old ale."
"The hops are much bigger at the nose then I remember. Maybe I have a fresher bottle? Anyway, at a dollar to two dollars cheaper than other ABWs of the same class, this is a steal. Im upping my Appearance and Smell by half a point and buying a case to cellar."
"This is a dark red/brown beer with a nice tan head of foam. The aromas are very simple and light. They consist of heavy malts, alcohol, light hops, and brown sugar. The taste is sweet, sugary, and malty. The hops are noticeable on the finish, but generally speaking, they are light. The mouthfeel is light for a 10% beer and the drinkability is excellent for a barleywine!"

"Definitly a different beer. Hard to categorize other than ...great! Add a little cream to this and it would make a great beer milkshake!"
"Medium brown color, medium head. Brown ale brewed by feeding brown sugar cane to the brewery yeast. There are suspended solids in this beer. Malty and sweet. Full flavored ale. Malty and hoppy. Brown sugar gives the beer somewhat of a Belgian Ale flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is a little crisp. Aftertaste slightly harsh. Some bottle aging would help this beer a lot. Still a nice taste and a very interesting idea."
"Zum Wohl!!"
"Thanks to Gusler for the opportunity to experience a wonderful brew."
"Pours dark golden brown in color with a thin and sticky off-white colored head. Nose is sweet caramelized malts, brown sugar, pine, and a bit of fresh cut grass. Starts off with sweet brown sugar, almost too sweet, but is quickly balanced by bitter notes of pine oils and raw hop flavors. The fact that the abv is 9.9% is quite a surprise as I couldnt detect any notes of alcohol. However, it does explain the increased difficulty Im having typing this review! Ive been a fan of all the Lagunitas beers Ive had to date, and this one is no different. A nice choice for a nightcap that Im sure Ill buy again."
"It pours nice, and is a deep amber color. It is quite bitter, with good aroma and bittering hops, plus malty and full bodied, and the high alcohol level brings all the flavors out. There was a sweet aftertaste, but is not overly sweet while drinking it and it feels wonderful on the tongue. Wow!"
"Jakey likes! Pours a crystal clear medium brown with amber highlights. The head is oddly yellow (not sunshine yellow, but a dull creamish yellow) and looks almost greasy or buttery. The head forms nicely and sticks around long enough that I can't complain. Even when it's mostly gone, what's left manages to sheet the sides of the glass. The first thing that came to mind after the first sniff was leaves. It's that smell when you're out in the woods and you pull leaves from a branch and crush them. The hoppy leaf smell dominates the soft warm malts underneath. The flavor is what stole my heart, though. You've got buttery biscuits topped with caramel and toffee flakes topped with a dollop of cream sprinkled with brown sugar and a light drizzling of maple syrup. Actually, that makes this thing sound sickeningly sweet, but it's not. It's just sweet enough that you'd call it sweet but no more. The slightly herbal hops are easily picked out but don't overpower or even dominate. An exquisitely balanced brew and one that I wouldn't guess was over 6% just by the taste."
"If you're lucky enough to find this, or any Lagunita's beer, grab it."
"Pours amber with just a hint of cloudiness. The nose is of very strong hops is the most enjoyable part of this beer. It just smells good. This has a heavy mouthfeel with a barley wine like taste that is average. There is a slight taste of the brown sugar used in it too. There is also a strong alcohol flavor that shows up towards the end of this beer. The flavor also finishes up too bitter."
"Slightly hazy ruby hue, topped by an off white, thick, creamy well retained head. Mellow, mint laced citrusy hop nose with a dominant note of underripe tangerine. Medium caramel malt aroma with hints of biscuit and butter. Mellow impression of berryish fruitiness rounds the aroma out. Baked biscuit mild sweetness is perceived at first, then is ensued by a pronounced, almost syrupy well caramelized sugar note, which persists throughout. Hop bitterness provides meager contrast, leaving the overall flavor profile quite sweet. Hop flavor manages to eek in, lending a brown sugar smothered grapefruit impression mid palate. A bit lightly bodied, and a touch over attenuated, yet residual sweetness remains assertive. Finishes with a lingering suggestion of warming butterscotch schnapps. Brown Shugga is quite an odd brew. The sweetness is only a hair shy of cloying, and seemingly overshadowed malt nuances. That being said, the sheer uniqueness and dearth of alcohol character (until the finish) warrant a try. With a greater hop presence this could be a fine barleywine. It's quite tasty, nonetheless. This would make a delicious, supremely calorically dense vanilla ice cream float. Thanks to TXhops for sending the bomber."
"Sorry Lagunitas, but you are quickly losing merit with me."
"I found the beer enjoyable, though not great. No particular aspect of its character makes it stand out. Actually, I REALLY like the fact that I can get a bomber of 9.9% beer for less than $3, but price aside, this beer is unexceptional, though by no means bad. The slight cidery taste and the lack of distinction in malt flavor or in hoppiness leaves this beer truly average across the board."
"Crytsal-clear and a rich copper in color, with a mountainous off-white head and decent lacing. The aroma is quite appealing as the brown sugar sweetness blends almost imperceptibly with a blend of citric and lightly floral hops. Mild fusel alcohol aromas develop as the beer warms. The flavor begins malty with some light, fruity notes, followed by an almost granular sugary flavor and some mild alcohol warming. The finish is dominating by a biting hop presence, but one which stings only for a second and merges gracefully in to a very well-balanced sugary sweet and somewhat spicy aftertaste. Medium-full body and rather like a mild barley wine in character. A very well-crafted (even if accidentally!) and drinkable beer."
"Poured a thick hazy amber color with very little foam and had not lace. The smell was of a citrus nature with a hoppy/malty aroma. The taste was of bitter hops and could not find any trace of brown sugar at all. It was thick and brown, but the bitterness over powered the sweetness. To me, this was not a well balanced or complex beer."
"The pour an obscure amber color, the head is exorbitant in size, the consistency frothy with enormous sticky sheets of lace clinging to the glass. Also must say, the sediment is suspended much as the definition of obscure states. Nose is malt, floral, hints of fusel alcohol, caramel, a Top Notch Sniffer for the old proboscis. Front is malt and thickly sweet, the top full-bodied, the finish is medial on the carbonation, medicinal in its hop spicy bite, dry, alcohol bitter aftertaste OOOHAAAAA, how I love these Bad Boys."
