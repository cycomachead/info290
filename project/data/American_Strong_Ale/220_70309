Not something that you would really want to drink more than two of at a time because of strong flavors that can ruin a palate if you want to drink or taste anything else for the next few hours.","JkOd81127","Aug 19, 2014"

4,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"A simple review would be to say the Lucky 13.alt is another excellent Lagunitas beer with the trademark big hops with a touch of sweetness, but thatâ€™s too easy. The Lagunitas Lucky 13.alt is an alternative take on their Lucky 13 Imperial Red Ale that pours a dark dirty blonde with plenty of hops in the aroma. The initial taste was like biting into a big juicy grapefruit that kept my mouth watering and wanting more. There was a light malt on the end that adds a lingering sweetness, but it was the big sweet grapefruit flavors that kept me coming back.","brurevu","Nov 10, 2013"

Tiny suspended shards of yeast cloud the beer, interesting, gives an unfiltered look, doesn't detract the score much. Maybe the bottle's just old. Smells pretty good, spicy hops with a good citrus undertone. Caramel malts with a touch of alcohol all come together quire nicely. Taste translates well, spicy caramel hop resins having the most flavor, followed by the roasted malts. Not much of the citrus as in the smell, but is definitely detectable. Everything balances nicely, very enjoyable. Body is good too, crisp and dry with a medium body. Overall really good, not very familiar with the style but it seems pretty hop dominant for a strong/imperial blond ale, which is good news to someone who drink mostly ipas like me.

Taste is, whew!, sweet, and roasted nuts and ripe fruit...the malt backbone masking some middle hops. Interestingly, as the sweet wears off, the hops that were once hidden seem to come forward a bit. Mouthfeel is ok, and so is the carbonation, and the mouthfeel, is more on the DIPA side of syrupy, but not too much. Overall, too much malt for me...wishing that the hops were up in volume.

In my mind there's just a "been there, done that" type of feeling as I drink this. I'm not sure if it's just me, but every Lagunitas beer seems to have the same "house" taste (especially in the hop profile), and I just get bored with them sometimes. That's not to say that they're bad beers; I thoroughly enjoy them when I'm in the mood. I just wish they'd venture out and make a beer that's more of a departure for them, maybe take a risk every now and then. Maybe I'm being a little unfair.

Aroma has an intense tropical fruit, pine, pineapple, mango, grapefruit blasts of hops, all sugar coated with a nice malt backbone peaking through with a kiss of alcohol reaching the nares. They make some big beautiful beers, this has a wallop of hop flavor well blended malt sweetness and soothing alcohol which all goes down extremely easily with each sip. There's up front sugar from the malts, a bit of warming alcohol, but then there's a well blended hop orchestra of mango, grapefruit citrus peel, pine cone, and straight up dirt as in earthiness. Really well blended flavors that don't become cloying by any means, extremely easy to drink for a beer this huge. Resinous but not too oily, slick just to lubricate yourself and your palate, even carbonation nothing cloying...damn good.

The beer does taste a bit "heavy" (like alcoholwise) but this should not be unexpected with a ABV of 8.9%. The taste of the alcohol is a little overwhelming at first, but the tastes of citrus and hops do come out later. The beer, while a little bit of a slow start, goes down very smooth once you get past the alcohol feel, and a good beer for those hoplovers out there.","cyclonece09","Jan 09, 2012"

The appearance and aroma start out strong but the beer goes down hill from there. The flavors are a bit disjointed and the mouthfeel is slightly off.

3.85,-4.2,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a great beer that was very well done. I know Lagunitas loves to heavily hop there beers and this one was no different, I thought the Alt. version went better with the citrus hops then the red version, it was almost like drinking a pretty strong and super hoppyl IPA. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma and flavor, the aroma had a real nice mix of citrus fruits, and the flavor was pretty damn good too. There wasn't anything that I didn't really like about this beer but it could have been a little less sweet and sticky. This beer has pretty good drinkability, I don't think I will have any problem taking out this bomber by myself, it seems like this would make a great summertime beer. I would for sure buy this beer again when looking for a nice hoppy beer and I would recommend this to anybody whole likes an aggressive amount of hops in their beer. I like this beer more then the red version and it is up there as one of the better beer from Lagunitas. Lagunitas makes some high quality beers for a low price and this beer is no different, I have yet to be let down with any brew I have tried from them, they are one hell of a brewing company. Edit, after this brew warmed up a little bit it got much more bitter and harder to finish, so I am taking that in to account.","StoutHunter","Beers"

The hops take over the finish and dance for a second with a touch of ethanol. The malty sweetness is almost approaching maibock here but the hops are powerful enough to keep that in check.

Hops are strong and provide a big citrus and spruce flavor. Thereâ€™s some light sugary vinous complexity, as well, but Iâ€™m not sure where itâ€™s coming from. The beer has a definite sugary, candy cane note with deeper caramel sticking more to the background. The mouthfeel is nice and round. The taste starts sweet with lots of delicate hoppiness and ends with a healthy but relatively gentle bitterness. Itâ€™s deceptively easy to drink for the abv, and thereâ€™s very little stickiness or booze to it. Once again, Lagunitas has made a strong, hoppy and delicious beer.

It starts out with some aggressively bright and SWEET hops, along with some tropical fruit aspects and sweet grain. Sweet is really the main thing here! There's really not much bittering hops here, with just a little bit of bitterness coming through on the finish, along with some honey flavors.

Lucky 13.alt is more of the same from this Sonoma brewery--a hop-forward, fruity sweet, high ABV beer that you'd have a hard time picking out of their lineup.","wagenvolks","Jul 10, 2011"

4.23,5.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"O - Quite a surprising brew. This could become one of my new favorites. Awesome and definitely worth seeking.","chugalug06","Jul 09, 2011"
3.92,-2.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Very good American Strong Ale, although it doesn't seem to fit into a traditional Altbier profile, at least with my experience with the style. Particularly enjoyed the aroma. Flavor is also quite good just a little hot for my tastes.","elgiacomo","Jul 08, 2011"
3.88,-3.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Drink- I saw it and bought it and was glad I did. Its a new style which seems very close to a DIPA. Id love this on tap at some point. Although Ill take a bottle too","FosterJM","Jul 08, 2011"

4.12,2.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Shared a bottle of this one this afternoon with schmittymack. Poured a nice golden color with a good finger or two of fluffy white foam. Aromas of pine, grapefruit and maybe mango. On the palate, this one was light to medium bodied, with flavors of pineapple, honey and light malt with a linger bitter finish.","emmasdad","Jul 06, 2011"
4,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"O - Hell. This beer kicks ass. My local bottle shop just picked up the slack by providing this new beer. Very happy I purchased the bottle.","depechemode1983","Jul 06, 2011"
3.97,-1.2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"22oz bottle. Pours a semi translucent bright amber color with a 1/2 inch of head. Lots of lacing. Aromas of malts, booze, citrus and apricots. Some hops and tropical fruits maybe. Pretty complex smell that I'm having trouble pinpointing exactly what I am smelling. Taste is boozey with some grapefruit/citrus/tropical fruits. Malty with a nice alcohol burn at the finish. This beer has some of that typical hoppy Lagunitas flavor but a bit more subdued than some of the other offerings. Somewhat sweet. Drinkable even though it has a boozey taste to it. Again, like with the aroma, hard to figure out all the nuances here. There is alot going on with this beer but I am digging it. Overall, this is a unique beer worth having again.","PicoPapa","Jul 05, 2011"
3.94,-2,3,4,4,4,4,"This one is well worth checking out. Especially if you like Dreadnaught, as some (but not all) of the flavor profiles are similar in my book.","WastingFreetime","Jul 05, 2011"

4.77,18.7,4.5,5,4.5,5,5,"Picked up a 1/2 bbl of Lucky 13.alt as a replacement for a Lagunitas IPA keg that I suffered through. Neither the shop, nor I realized that it was the 13.alt, so it came as something of a welcome surprise. In terms of reviews, the best I can offer is that this brew reminds me of Founder's Centennial IPA and a little bit like Double Dead Guy--both of which I have had on my tap system. I would attribute this to the use of malts to 'mask' the ~9% ABV characteristic. Anotehr well-built offering by Launitas, and one that I'm proud to have on tap at home.","NHhophead","Jul 03, 2011"
4.15,3.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"O: Pretty pleased with this. Basically like drinking a big DIPA with a stronger malt base. Strong hops, good balance, smells and looks delicious. Definitely a winner. I'll have to try to find the brunette version to compare.","Dope","Jul 03, 2011"
4.42,10,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall, this is an excellent amber ale. I had the other Lucky 13 last year but I don't remember it being this tasty (unfortunately I didn't review that one). Dangerously drinkable. It reminds me of a Hop Stoopid/Undercover Investigation Shut Down Ale Hybrid: A citrus hop blast countered with a malty-caramel brown sugar backbone. Go get one!","Hatzilla","Jul 03, 2011"
4.05,0.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"I thought I was role playing with the blonde as I have rendezvoused with the brunette before but alas...I see it's another beer with an .alt at the end. Whew! Bomber poured into a snifter I am met with a nice copper colored ale with a foamy off white head with minimal lacing. The aroma is quite nice with red grapefruit, mango, pine and sweet hops. The taste has a nice combination of bitter and sweet on this beauty. Very smooth drink for being this high in alcohol. Light malt backbone. Big bitter aftertaste. Major mouth salivation going on if you are into that. Great mouthfeel. Overall this beer does the style proud. Awesomely drinkable though the taste may get tiresome after one 22 oz. I noticed as it warms, the sweetness shines through. A very well made beer and of course....worth the low price from the Petaluma crew.","kaseydad","Jul 03, 2011"
4.12,2.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Appearance is a nice golden amber color that has a finger of off-white head that dissipates quickly. The nose is much like a DIPA. Lots of fruity nuances like pineapple, grapefruit, and mango. Fresh and inviting. The taste is very fruity with the pineapple dominating. A stong bitterness creates a nice dry mouthfeel. Medium-bodied and easy to drink. This is more of a a DIPA than anything else. Damn tasty.","ChugginOil","Jul 03, 2011"
4,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Bottle poured a nice golden amber color with a large white head that lasted awhile and laced nicely. Piney floral hops dominate the smell. Taste is a fantastic balance of flavors. Citrusy sweet and apricot flavor malts balance nice with the bready malts. Slick mouthfeel and medium bodied. Finishes with a smooth bitterness from the hops.","nimrod979","Beers"
3.65,-9.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall: As I said, way too similar to Maximus. In all honesty, all of the hoppy Lagunitas beers are somewhat similar for me, but this goes too far. Plus, Maximus is not my favorite DIPA by any means. Ultimately, I still do enjoy it, as I like the signature Lagunitas taste, but I prefer it be better balanced within the beer.","bsp77","0"
4.14,3,4,5,3.5,4,4.5,"Pour is good nice foamy head that laces the glass. The smell is so perfect I have no idea what an alt beer is supposed to smell or taste like but I'm guessing its not like this. Scent is the standard lagunitas sweet hop concoction smell mixed with some serious passionfruit and some fresh cut grass. The first sip is a bit of a let down perhaps because I am a fan of lagunitas ipas and this style is not usual for them. A lighter version of the ipa but still good and quite flavorful. Weaker then the scent but unique and a little peppery, hops are great and sweet malt and baked fruit are there. All and all solid but I would rather have a shutdown, maximus or sumpin sumpin.","jizfiasco","Jun 29, 2011"

3.92,-2.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"With all due respect I don't think this was classified correctly. I have not had an alt beer...but just by reading the description...this ain't one. Tastes almost like a Burton Baton jr., a cross between an IPA and a strong ale. I'm guessing the .alt influenced the classification but don't think that's what Lagunitas meant.","cindyjeffsmith","Jun 25, 2011"
3.85,-4.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"D - A bomber size is just about perfect for this beer. I will probably pick this one up again if I see it.","Jeriba","Jun 22, 2011"
4.09,1.7,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into my Dale's Pale Ale shaker glass. Very hard to get more than half a finger of head out of it. Very big bubbled body (kinda looks like a cream soda). Decent lacing. Smells first off like Lagunitas house yeast. Flowery hops. A little bit of citrus, but not too much-o. Big malt character on the tongue. Some light bubblegum flavors and a nice flowery and citrus-y bite. Nice biting bitter finish. Sneaky for 8.9 I'd say. Not like any alt-bier I've ever had. Great addition to the Lagunitas line-up.","WestValleyIPA","Beers"
