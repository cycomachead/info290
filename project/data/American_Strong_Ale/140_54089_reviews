"Bottled November 2009 -- 5+ years old. Wonderfully integrated  flavors. So smooth."

"O- If you are still sitting on bottles of this, I would crack them open and see if it's come to a place where you like it. I don't think this has done very well with age on it."

"This beer is veer deep mahogany color with light caramel head that dissipates leaving a thin coating of bubbles around the glass. The aroma is dark dried fruits and tobacco. The flavor follows suit with a sweet caramel and raisin start. It finishes with a slightly bitter taste with a hint of roasted smokiness. It is a good balance of sweet and bitter. The mouthfeel is quite right. It is just thick and syrupy enough, but has just the right amount of carbonation to keep it light and drinkable. Overall, this is a very good beer. I wish that I had a few more bottles of this one. It could definitely last a bit longer."
""
""
"O - This beer has aged wonderfully. I love the thick mouthfeel. Although I can taste the alcohol, it still drinks remarkably well. I am definitely glad I aged a bottle."
""
""
""
"O- Although I did not review this fresh (as I remember Life & Limb v2 being cloyingly sweet), the 2+ years of age has done this beer remarkably well. American Strong Ale is a good category for it, as it is quite complex and possesses qualities of an Imperial Stout, Belgian Quadruple and the earthiness of something that might construed as being barrel-aged. I would not purchase a case, but being a fan of both of these breweries, this stands to be one of the most enjoyable collaboration (and aged) beers I have sampled...well done! (4.25)"
"O - This beer has aged gracefully in a good way, glad I sat on it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It's got a lot of the syrup flavors, but that doesn't make it terribly exciting."

"I had this beer at a tasting a couple years ago and was really impressed by it. I bought a bottle, stashed it in the cellar, and forgot about it ... until today. I'm glad I waited, as I think I have developed more of an appreciation for clean, malty flavors since then. This is a delightful beer and I hope DFH will brew it again someday so others can try it."
""
"O: Really drinks more like a stout than a barleywine, which, I guess, is why they use the useless term ""American Strong Ale"" to describe it. Definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Awesome collab here, wouldn't expect anything less from these titans of brewing excellence."
""
""
""
"It wasn't as good as I hoped but it was still delicious and very unique. The maple syrup is definitely noticeable and became more prevalent as the beer warmed. The mouthfeel was thick and creamy and the more I drank, the more I started to like this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Two finger tan head with excellent lacing and retention on an dark, deep amber body. Aroma is excellent with dark chocolate, brown sugar, toasted malts, earthy hops and semisweet dark fruit. I was a little timid trying this one expecting it to be very boozy but it wasn't at all. Flavors more on the dark fruit and sour fruit side up front with bitter citrus into the finish on a base of chocolate and caramel toasted malts in the background. Full body and light to moderate carbonation. Nicely smooth for the style. Very nice beer. Deceptively boozy. Good to share."

"Huge licorice notes with lighter berry-like fruits...strawberries and maybe even cranberries. A lot going on here and is still a bit hot, could probably benefit from another year or two. Still a decent hop bite. Medium sweetness (molasses perhaps?) and the mouthfeel is pretty rich. Interesting brew, although I am getting a bit too much on the licorice-alcohol combo, they seem to accentuate each other."

"The beer has definitely gotten a bit on the overcarbonated beer (at least from what was intended), but it is not excessively so and this has likely dried out the beer a bit more than it otherwise would have been. I am a bit surprised that I have had this beer since 2009, it is certainly holding up well, even if a touch of oxidation is becoming noticeable."
""
""
""
"This was not my beer. Made by two of my favorite breweries, DFH and Sierra Nevada, this didn't really come through for me. The color surprised me first of all, and was not a bad thing, but was much darker than I was expecting. Dark with bronze highlights when held to light and moderate wet head. Smell has lots of maple, brown sugar, and some malt, but is muddy and indistinct. Taste is the same... lots of the same flavors but nothing really stands out and it becomes just a sweet blur. Feel is smooth, a little sticky.. Definitely not my favorite from these two, and there are many other better American Strong Ale choices like Brown Shugga' and Deliverance."

"Overall, a very good sweet beer with a little barrel flavor that is highly drinkable. I did not even notice the beer was 10.2% from drinking it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Life and Limb, the SN/DFH Collab. Nice. I think time has been kind to this one . Better mouthfeel than I recall. Thanks!"

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled 6/29/2011. Pours fairly clear extremely dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of raisin, toffee, molasses, toast, biscuit, wood, chocolate, maple, clove, light vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with great balance and complexity of malt notes with well balanced wood notes. Taste of raisin, toast, toffee, chocolate, dark bread, wood, maple, molasses, light clove, roasted malt, slight char, and roasted earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of toffee, toast, raisin, chocolate, maple, molasses, dark bread, roasted malt, light clove, slight char, and earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and balance of malt flavors with wood notes; with light hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent strong ale! Great balance and complexity of malt flavor and wood aging; and very smooth to sip on. Really enjoyed this one."

""

"overall, a really nice offering. way different than the ipa they came out with this year. but still really nice."
""
"o: lots of alcoholic effect, dig the malty sugar flavors but it wears after awhile, the maple and birch add some interesting effect - nice overall, huge and somewhat complex but not fully capitalized, was far too hyped at the time"

"There are pieces of this beer that I like. But there's more that I don't like. The taste is lacking, and that really defines the whole beer. The smell promised sweetness and depth, but the taste didn't deliver. After a glass, I'm finding the strength surprising. I'll give it that - the alcohol is quite well hidden."
"O: Time has done this beer right. The hops have mellowed out, allowing the two syrups to really come forward and shine. I particularly enjoyed the birch syrup and the cream soda impression that it imparts. The body has smoothed out and developed a nice creamy and luscious texture. A decadent after-dinner beer that can be paired with an array of desserts. Maybe a pecan tart or simply a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I wish one of these breweries would re-visit this one."

"I'm really not sure if it's this cellered brew or my tongue that's evolved so much over the last 15 months,, perhaps it's both ?? At any rate this is a pretty amazing, well balanced, American Strong Ale. Very easy on the eyes, the nose, and the pallate I AM LOVING THIS on this 28° morning (following a Founders Breakfast Stout). I bought a case of this 4 months after getting into ""real"" craft beer and had alot of trepidation after trying it in October 2011, but after 15 months of 47° cellering I fumble stucked into what I believe is a great cellered American Strong Ale. Cheers and don't hate me cause I'm a RedNeck."
""
""
"Overall, a unique, quirky, and strong ale, perhaps not up to the par of Sierra or Dogfish's finest individual works, but certainly a tasty and worthwhile experiment."

"Overall: A very heady, strong, delightful beer. Taste buds be warned. This is not a beer for the weak or faint of heart. A wonderful American Strong Ale."
""
""
"Gave it a 4.25 overall, even though most of the components are 4s, just something about this that I really like."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and nicely carbonated. It has likely mellowed in the cellar and it is now a balanced, enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Would I buy it again? Yes."
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Great complexity with a great balance. The maple syrup is a really nice touch."
""
""
""
"Overall I am very impressed with how this ages. Not sure what it tastes like fresh, since they were all gobbled up upon release, but this is a very well done beer. The use of molasses brings a nice element to this style and in my eyes this collaboration worked well. The alcohol presence is still strong 3 years later which was a nice surprise considering the aging process. I could see maybe aging this a few months more, but the one I consumed was perfect for my palate."
""
"Overall: This old ale tastes more like a huge barleywine. Even with it’s enormous taste profile, it is strangely drinkable. I do not really feel Sierra Nevada’s presence in this beer, but Dogfish’s propensity to brew with maple syrup (thanks to the Calagione family) and their willingness to branch out (ha, pun not intended) is felt throughout the beer. This is a very impressive offering, and I would love to have this available all the time. It is truly a shame that this is a one-time thing. 18.5/20"

"O - I had this one sitting in my cellar for some time, I'm glad I let it mellow a bit. Nice collaboration between SN and DFH, definitely one worth trying"
"Other Notes: Cellared under less than optimal conditions, probably 65 degrees for a majority of the year from 2010-2011."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: I was a fan of batch 1 and thought batch 2 was a bit of a let down when fresh, however after a year, this is really getting better. The alcohol is still a bit too much, but I think that this one is only getting better, can't wait to try it next year!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Feels almost like dark and rich bourbon cocktail in beer form. Really good cold weather beer."
""
"An excellent collaboration. American strong ale styles seem to be the new hit with a wide range of approaches. Enjoyed this very much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is leaning towards the heavier side with carbonation being a little above average. Overall, I thought it was a lot better than I was expecting it to be. It really came together well and the maple syrup was really well represented in it. With all the sweet flavors I was really impressed at how relatively balanced and drinkable it was. Very enjoyable overall."
""
"Glad I aged this one a bit. It's better than the bottle I drank a year ago."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Goes down a treat - top stuff - in saying that this is the type of beer that almost needs a 275ml bottle not a bomber."
"O: Altogether a pleasant brew. I respect the complexity this beer presents. Even though I'm a hop-head I would still suggests this over quite a few IPAs. If you appreciate complexity and uniqueness, you'll enjoy this one."
""
""
"One of the more complex American Strong Ales I've had. A master blend of balancing flavors. Its sweet without being cloying. Excellent use of ingredients. Really no flaws. An awesome sipper. Wish I had another one to age."
""
""
""
"D - Liked this quite a bit more than I expected. The syrup as usual is a bit weak but helps the feel. One of the better collabs I've had in a while."
""
""
"O: A very nice beer. Incredibly complex, but still very drinkable."
""
"Wow! I hope they brew this again soon!"
""
""
""
""
"O: pretty solid beer. I meant to drink one of these fresh but it took awhile to get around to it. nice complexity but imo the original batch tasted a little better on tap and aged."
"O: Strong in fragrance and flavor, smooth and well balanced, definitely worth a try, should have some age on it, though"
""
""
"(originally reviewed: 08-08-2011)"
"Overall: Super solid, but definitely a sipper with an ABV approaching 11%; wish this one came in the 12 oz. format."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall this was forgettable. An average American Strong Ale that I would say could age well. I gotta say unexpected more from these two breweries."
""
"O: This is a rich, delicious malty brew; so glad I got to try this one and I hope to continue this beer"
""
"O - Nicely done collaboration beer! Great flavors and a long lasting finish!"
""
""
"O: Drinkability is very smooth and polished for a beer of this abv. Sweet dark fruit with an inviting and complimenting alcohol that never gets in the way or distracts even upon warming."
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas. Not overly complex but still very nice."
"If you have a beer cellar this would be a great addition to it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: High marks for being delicious. The added syrups are obvious, but contribute to the overall excellence. Recommended! Sort of like a barleywine"
""
"O- I'm glad I tried it, as I really like both breweries, but I wasnt amazed. A decent American strong ale, but not as good as Arogant Bastard. I guess strong ales just aren't my jam!... Nonetheless a pretty solid brew & the whole collaboration thing is pretty cool."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel - Thick, full bodied. A little syrupy and chewy. Medium carbonation. But it drinks pretty easy. The ABV is pretty well hidden under all the complex flavors this has to offer. Long lasting finish. Pretty excellent collaboration between SN & DFH."
""
""
"Overall - Very drinkable considering the ABV, but not very exciting. The tastes are almost too well balanced leaving the beer fairly boring. I was hoping for the maple to stand out a little bit more with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I liked this beer and I thought it was a good example of an American Strong Ale, I tend to think of this style as stronger beers with unique aspects too them that don't make it fit in other more straightforward styles, and that's exactly what this beer is all about, and I like that. It had good drinkability, it went down fairly smooth, but as it warmed it got to be a little boozy, splitting a big bottle of this with another person is the ideal amount to me, a whole bottle to myself might be a little too much. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and the complexity of the aroma and taste, they were both pretty nice. What I liked least about this beer was how boozy it got when it warmed up, it wasn't overwhelming or too warming, but I thought that it could be toned down a little. I might be inclined to but this beer again, but it would for sure be for a special occasion since it's a little pricey, but I don't think I will see it around anytime soon. I recommend giving this a try if you can handle a little booze, you will be rewarded with some rich and complex flavors and aromas. I was pretty satisfied with this beer, I was looking for a strong and complex beer that I could sip on with my brother and that is exactly what this beer delivered, I think this beer could even be aged for a couple years, it might calm down the booze, and bring out some more malty and sweet flavors. I am big fan of collaboration beers and I am glad these two brewery's came together to make one kick ass beer, it's one trend that I would love to see more of and I can't see why it would be a bad thing. These two brewery's did a great job with this beer and I am glad I got the chance to try it, since this was the last bottle left, you can be sure that if you guys get together for another beer, I will be there waiting to get my hands on a bottle, good job all around."
"Surprisingly good! Been sitting in my fridge for quite awhile, frankly because I thought I wouldn't like it. Boy was I wrong! Not much aroma, but flavor and mouthfeel are both magnificent. It carries a fairly persistent head, a nice delicate sweetness, a very pleasant mouthfeel, and only a mild hop bitterness. I believe this is the second beer I've had containing birch syrup ... and I liked the other one just as much. Time to find more birch syrup beer!"
""
"I want to rate this one higher, but it's really nothing special. Too many great options in the craft world for this to stand out. I have another one to sit on, but I doubt it will go anywhere but south. 3.5"
"Better with a year on the bottle ..."
""
""
""
"Life and Limb is a very good beer. I recommend trying at least one bottle. If you want, maybe I'll even trade one to you."
""
"Overall. Flavours didn't really work for me. I could see others enjoying this, just not me."
""
"M: The maple is a great addition, bringing sappy sweetness. Beyond that, the dark base is chewy and strong - up to the task. I'm regretting only grabbing one bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have to confess I didn’t like this one very much. Just not very tasty, the bottle was finished between two people but just barely. A miss in my mind. I wanted something a lot sweeter, with more maple presence, and less solvent booziness."
""
""
""
""
"The appearance and aroma were somewhat better on the fresh bottle, but the 2009 had developed a very nice body with great mouth feel."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an excellent sipping beer to accommodate drinking or deep conversation. It also works well with robust food."
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is good, I just wish it tasted s good as it smells."
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a deep burgundy color ale with a super large brown foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of caramelized sugar and light toffee notes with some dry fruit ester. Taste is a mix between some caramelized sugar notes with some dry fruit. Body is quite full with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Not the most complex brew thought this is not a criticism as this one is just an easy drinking high ABV beer."
"Good, but not great. However, this is a noble effort from two of the best breweries we have in this country."
""
"Overall I loved this one, it was worth the wait! I was I had a bottle to drink before aging."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I would liken this to a drinkable version of an Angels Share."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is still a really satisfying beer, but I think I fully prefer this fresh. The dark fruit flavors tend to hide the true essence of the beer rather than compliment or enhance it in my opinion."
""
""
""
"Taste is sweet to start, citrus and dark fruit in the middle, and hops come on with pine to a warming close. Mouthfeel is amazingly smooth, and drinkability is scary easy for the abv. SN & DFH have created a beautiful symphony here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Decent head, and a full nose. Flavor is a well-balanced mix of grains with subtle sweet and pungent notes. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"O- This was an unusual beer. Not what I expected, although certainly not disappointed. Definitely worth a try. I bought this and didn't wind up trying it until months later. Hopefully there are some bottles left."
"O - A very nice beer, if you are in the mood for something that is a tad on the sweet side. It also does a great job concealing it's 10.2% ABV."
""
""
"O - A very powerful beer with flavors that don't really pop. Neutral, easy to drink, flavors meld well. Is it worth the price...that's up to each person and how much they enjoy this respective style and breweries."
"O: Good beer, might be hard to get through the bottle all by myself."
""
""
""
"For my 1000th review i thought i review something special as i dont see this brew very often and probably would not of if it wasnt for MrKennedy so big thanks for that and it pours a very dark kola hue which leaves a frothy creamy three finger head and heaps of nice lacing,the smell is burnt toffee,maple syrup,coffee and the aroma of old trees in a forest interesting,the mouthfeel is thick sticky and sweet and has tastes of maple syrup,sweet fruity nectar,burnt toffee,caramel candy,molasses,treacle,candied peaches and finished with a smooth herbal dryness and overall a very lovely drop that would age very well and would revisit if i evrr saw again cheers."
"Overall, I enjoyed this one a great deal, but based on my memory of the cask version, this didn't quite live up to my first experience with this beer. Still, I really liked it a lot, and I would definitely buy and drink again, as it was a tasty sort of alternative, high ABV brown ale. Nice collaboration - I hope DFH and SN decide to work together some more!"
"I've had this a few times, once at the DFH brewpub. Last night I split one with my wife. We both loved it. Pours into our tulip glasses, very dark with giant, foamy heads in both of our glasses. Smells sweet to the nose. The taste follows suit, with slight hints of maple syrup. This is a delicious dessert beer. Very creamy and thick. I would buy more of these if they were cheaper and more easily available."
"A decent somewhat unique beer that seems to prove that the strong ale style is not one of my favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Second Note: Needed to list this as a “nitro-bottle” review in order to review this beer for Life and Limb 2; this was a standard corked 1 pint 94 fluid oz bottle of beer that was not a nitro bottle, just reviewed this way to share the notes on the “2” version."
"Overall: Not a bad beer. Have cellared this one for several months, but couldn't wait to try it any longer. I am dissapointed that I don't taste what I was expecting from a birch syrup addition, but maybe it is more apparent in a younger version. It does contribute to a solid alcohol presence that works well with the rest of the beer (and is sure to leave you glowing). A well made beer (as you might expect from a collaboration brew between breweries of such reputations). An interesting sample of a rarely represented style in the American beer market. Worth a try but not to die for."
""
""
"Overall Impression- While enjoying this on-tap last fall, I enjoyed it even more while in bottle. I'm surprised the maple syrup characteristics are still huge in this one with it being aged. Highly recommend this brew and will be looking for it next year!"
"I've held onto this since it's release and am very happy with the results. It's quite a nice beer, complex and flavorful enjoy to not be boring. The drinkability was very high which was an added bonus for me. Seek out, definitely worth trying."
""
""
"A brown bomber by my friend Patrick. Bown-brick-red colour with a thin head the was destroyed by the alcohol. Nice roastiness with caramel on the nose. The mouth is somewhat thin for all the alcohol, nice maple syrup, the birch is invisible and a cacao and coffee finale. A nice beer somewhat hard to define, the flavors are packed together."
""
""
"Batch 2. 750ml corked and caged bottle served in a snifter. Poured a deep brown with a finger of tan head. Cocoa and some licorice in the aroma. Molasses and more licorice in the flavor. Seemed a little hot at the start, but that smoothed out. Fuller side of medium bodied. Smooth. Not much hop presence, but not overly sweet for such a malty beer. Very long dry finish with more cocoa. Glad I got to try this, but I can't say that this did much for me."
""
"Smooth, creamy, full bodied, with plenty of carbonation, and a sweet aftertaste. A nice collaboration beer between Sierra Nevada and Dogfish Head."
""
""
"Overall: Not bad, but not amazing. Doesn't need to age...won't get any better."
""
"Review is for version #1."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very sweet, flavorful and potent brew that definitely should be sipped and savored slowly."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An interesting beer. The different syrups add an interesting complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: complex yet balanced, significant abv but not strong in the taste, syrup notes are also well incorporated; a collaborative effort well-done."
""
""
"Wow...just noticing the abv now...nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"O: Good beer, syrup adds a nice addition. I thought it might use a few months in the cellar to see what comes of some aging."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nicely done, great complexity, any malt lover should try this."
""
""
""
"D/O: This infrequent offering from the collaborative minds of Sierra Nevada and Dogfish Head could serve as an archetypal American strong dark ale. While very malt-focused, it is otherwise balanced and without clear weakness. For those that think imperfection is beautiful, there is nothing here that stands out. While it is obviously well-made, it lacks some special trait that could simultaneously earn loyalty from some and enmity from others. Compared to the 2009 vintage, this seems safer, with less maple character, less booze presence, and overall just a lighter and more approachable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Definate crowd-pleaser. I can't really fault this beer other than its not aMAzing. This beer is what all good brown ales want to be when they grow up."
""
"Tasty winter warmer, but too sweet for my tastes and not very complex. Great packaging though and probably quite cellar-worthy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" Massive yummy beast just right for the holidaze season."
""
""
"O: This is a great beer, really rich and complex and delicious. For such a strong beer, the alcohol is almost entirely disguised and only shows up as a slight warming feeling afterwards."
""
"O – The profile is complex with a brisk ginger spiciness and a ice depth of flavor. A very nice brew."
""
"O: Above average for style. Really interesting and pretty tasty stuff, I like the syrup addition. The prune flavor seemed a bit overdone IMHO, but that has never been my favorite part of the stout style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Life and Limb is an interesting drinking experience.. another swell beer from two of the most respected brewers in the States."
""
""
""
"D-Really easy drinking, high ABV stout. Its a little sweet for my taste, but still a very solid beer."
""
"O: I could easily drink one or two of these, especially with dessert."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: sweet, very sweet for a Strong Ale. But a good example of a String Ale and an example of what a great collaboration beer and a beer can be in general."
""
""
""
""
""
"O Looked amazing but didn't really do too much after that. Somewhat messy flavors that seemed like something was missing. I would hunt this down again, but definitely try it again."
""
""
""
""
"O- This one is big and malty with a fair dose of alcohol (although it doesn't detract from my enjoyment). A very nice brew and one I'd like to see develop with some age."

"This ain't drankin' too well. Papery molasses and generally just pretty dull."
"O - I found Life & Limb to be a tasty, maple-flavored brew. It was enjoyable and a beer I look forward to having again, even if for the price there might be others I'd rather check out."
"Final thought - $10 a pop and 9+ abv, price is high but very excellent"
""
""
"O - Not my cup of tea. I can tell it is well made. Perhaps it would pair well with a rich dessert to provide some complimentary flavors but as a standalone beer, I'll pass."
""
"i was looking forward to this beer and i was sadly let down. i did not enjoy this, almost a drain pour, very hard to get down. the maple syrup really took a back seat, too astringent, and seem to have almost a belgian like ester thing going on. i wont come back to this."

"I like the color, it's dark, almost opaque. There's a good head with a tan color. I can't smell much, but that could be my nose. I get a faint molasses smell. The taste is quite good. I can detect maple, but it's not overwhelming. I can pick up some molasses taste and roasty malts. There's a pleasant alcohol warmth."
""
""
"The first thing I noticed with this beer was that it was a brown tan color. It had a sweet maple smell. The taste was a full bodied ale with malt characteristics and a sweet taste of maple that was a compliment to the malts and didn't hinder them. It had a hint of birch in the finish which added to the experience. I'd have to say this beer is another good example of why collaborations between breweries is good in craft Beer."

"Overall: Not a bad beer. I really enjoy big boozey and heavy American Strong Ale. That is not this beer, it at the other end of the spectrum. Its flavorful for not being barrel aged. Was hoping the maple and birch syrups would have brought more flavors and complexity into this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Interesting and unique ale. The maple really comes through...probably the birch syrup too but I’ve never had that before so I don’t know what to look for. Very nice aroma...almost has the effect of a barrel aged beer such as a Scotch Ale. Excessive sweetness does get in the way of this being truly special, however."

"Aging potential, but a pretty average beer off the shelf. I like how this beer feels, but the taste is generic. My first sip presented a little sweetness, but it disappeared. May try it again in the future."
""
"I think this is aging pretty nicely. The flavors have melded pretty well but I'm not sure if the burnt raisin flavor will ever become more pleasing. I would bet the alcohol heat would dissipate more over time."
""
""
""
"O - This was really good. It was worth the wait. Thanks to madarab55 for sharing."
"I bought 1 bottle to start with and quickly went back to buy a couple more. If it was not for the price, I would have easily bought a couple cases."
""
"Hot from alcohol, but feels just right to me, for the American Strong Ale it is. Definitely something I'd come back to for dessert or a nightcap."
""
""
"Fuller body, decent carbonation, a little chewy and lingering on the tongue. This was a nice combo with the turkey, potatoes, gravy, etc - plenty of complex flavors, and I like the uniqueness of the maple and birch. The barrel aged version definitely takes this to another level though."
""
""
""
"This beer is good, once you get past the alcohol the underneath is great. Malty and dark fruit like. Great for this time of year!"
"Overall a pretty good beer. I was hoping a lite more sweetness came through in it's flavor."

"About one finger width of head that quickly disparate, the color is a very dark amber brown. The nose is interesting there is some dark fruit smell like figs, then a touch of sweetness and a little caramel also there is an alcohol smell but its very faint. Compared to the 2009 I had when it first came out this beer did a 180. Originally it was extremely boozy and over sweet. With two years of age this has mellowed out extremely. The booze taste is all but gone, just like in the nose I get dark fruit flavors like fig or black cherry, and a hint of maple. The mouthfeel got better with age as well, originally it was it very slick and viscous on the palate, now it is very light and the flavor does not linger on your touge. Over all this is with a year age on it an above average beer. very soild I recommend drinking your 2009's now."

"O - A well-balanced beer that successfully represents its style. Beyond that, however, nothing special. It's tasty, but there's not anything spectacular or unique about it. If I found it on tap I would order it to compare, but I would not buy it bottled again."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer. It was an interesting mix – and very tasty. With that being said, I could probably only drink one of these at a time."

"This collaboration brew is dark black brown in color with a thick, light brown head and blanketing lace. The aroma is of a deep but mellow malt with a little sharp vinegar yeast. The flavor comes on with a thick juniper-malt with sugary cider bite. It is pleasantly carbonated with tiny bubbles and ultimately delivers a velvetty but near syrupy feel with a medium-heavy body. There’s some alcohol notable but it does not distract from what is overall a damn good brew. Very nice"

"Into a wine glass, a very dark brown color (black really) rests under a mild layer of head. Aroma is a cool and mellow sweet milk and dark cocoa noted one. A smooth and crisply carbonated feel flows on through with harmonizing notes of sweet dark roasted malt and caramel. Sweet flavoring here is really delicious and I can't help but think of the pure maple syrup and birch syrup that may contribute to that. Fresh dark coffee noted finish. Goes together very well with a cheddar cheese beef burger and fries."
"Maple sweetness and dark malt flavors. A weak nose though compared to what I was expecting. Oh well, still enjoyable."
"Pours a dark brown with large three finger tan head. Nose is sweet caramel malt, molasses, dark fruit (plum, raisins), brown sugar and some some alcohol. Taste is similar with a large emphasis on the sweet malt and molasses. Brown sugar is still evident. Some heat in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy. Slightly creamy with a wet and satisfying finish. Overall a great sipper of a beer. Not getting too much maple syrup but as it warms that could change. Molasses is strong fridge temp."
"This is a very tasty beer that's easy to drink for it's 10%+ abv."
"Cheers..."
"A solid enough beer, but one that I wish had a bit more depth of flavor- particularly given the abv. Pours black with a fair head, especially for the strength of the beer. Smells a little hot, but doesn't taste it. The maple here is very subtle, and the birch is even more so. This is a shame, because the bitter and wintergreen notes of birch could work well here if they were amped up. There is a light, nutty sweetness, with a faint aftertaste of maple candy, some woodiness, and just a hint of birchy wintergreen. Very smooth, perhaps a tad too much so. With a bit more oomph, this could be a great beer."
"I would have to say this is a pretty good American Strong overall. I think this beer would benefit from some time in a barrel, actually."
"O - a good example of the style."
"I'm not one who prefers one packaging over the other (""tap beer is better than bottles!!"") without at least trying it and have reason to prefer one over the other. But I can point out a more pronounced maple flavor and aroma in the beer and it's a touch sweeter. The beer is fuller bodied than it's thin relative found in bottles. If you didn't enjoy the bottle and happen upon this on draught, try it out."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Medium-bodied, but can appear heavy at times. Not a bad brew, but the offerings I've had from Russian River are much better. This lacks a sort-of punch to it. I somewhat feel like they forgot to tag a taste onto the beers finish."
"Overall a good beer. I had just hoped for better."
"It's good, but it's a sipper."
"O - Awesome Beer!! This is probably one of my favorite dark beers. Has a lot of aromas & flavors that work well together to make a really nice beer."
"O - A very interesting project, but it works. Very good."
"O: very good beer, drinkable, but disappointing. This wasn't worth the hype. This would be a decent barleywine, but it's billed as something different and sold at a steep price."
"O- not sure if I'd buy it again based on the price tag, but it's a damn good beer. Enjoying it."
"Pours a dark toffee brown. Thin creamy off-white head. Aroma is a bit medicinal with vague hints of maple. Malt forward and warming. No hop aroma or flavor, just the requisite bitterness. I wish the maple and birch described were more prominent. Smooth and easy drinking. Having tried both batches, I would say that there is no significant difference (other than age at this point)."
"At first look this is gonna be an amazing brew. Lots of aroma; chocolate and syrup, nice fruit and malt. Little head and this thing packs an amazing punch of flavor. In general this reminds me a lot of CBS; i guess just in the fact that they both have a bit of this syrup thing going on. I nice sipper. I would love to be able to drink this stuff on the regular but availability has me beat. Overall this and celebration are my favs from Sierra nevada."
"This beer is delicious, wish I could get my hands on the barrel aged version. I wish there was a bit more maple tones, but molasses is close."
"O: Wow, I really liked this one! Give me more! I have another bottle that I'm aging until March, I will have to see if that brings out more of the maple and birch flavors."
"O: 4"
"Overall: Good beer, but I think questionable lines didn't help. It had a good quality of woodsiness, and a great story. The maple sap is definitely apparent in flavor, and definitely warrants and extended tasting."
"Apparently, this is a special beer. I'm really happy I had the opportunity to buy two bottles. One to drink now (this review). And one to age. I'm hoping the aging will pick up some complexity. As, this beer was really good. But, not as exciting as I was hoping for."
"O- I liked this beer. I really like the idea behind the name and I am thrilled to see breweries like Dogfish Head and Sierra Nevada encouraging creativity. I cannot wait to have the one aging in the basement in a few years."
"Not a very flavorful strong ale. It has the body but there just isn't a flavor that really pops. The ABV is pretty well hidden though."
"O: Very good would love to enjoy this again."
"I was apprehensive of this beer before drinking, thinking it would be too malty and heavy, but SN and DFH did a great job with this. It's an easily drinkable beer, especially for its ABV. Speaking of which, you would never guess this is in the double digits unless you look on the label. I quite liked this dark beer, more than most RIS beers out there. Can the future of dark craft beer please head in this direction?"
"Overall: Very good beer overall. The booze comes on strong at the finish, but I can accept that with an American Strong Ale. I really enjoyed this one and would definitely recommend it if you are able to locate it."
"Overall this is a big winner. As the bottle says, it's one to savor. Seek it out."
"Overall: They were not kidding when they said that age does this beer well. Other reviews have said that the flavors are disjointed. However, I can honestly say that the hop bitter, the smooth/woody/sweet syrups, and the fairly intense malts have been brought together with a bit of aging. I will get another bottle of this and age it at least a year. A really good beer from two of my favorite breweries. Its worth the pick up totally. Its also pretty memorable. I'll get another."
"I first had a bourbon barrel aged Life and Limb at a beer fest and thought it was fantastic, which prompted me to buy a few bottles of the new batch. The normal life and limb isn't as complex as the barrel-aged version, but it is still a solid beer. It hides the high ABV quite well."
"overall: my 4oz serving is sufficient - won't need a bottle"
"Poured from bottle into pint, probably not the best choice. Anyhow I was excited, Sierra? Dogfish Head? My favorites. Not my favorite beer. Malty chocolate head very thin and minimal lacing. Dark chocolate color, was a nice looking beer. The first sip is dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, sugar, malt, yes maybe I cannot stand a beer with no bitterness. Honestly, would drink it again just to prove myself wrong. Mouthfeel was the blandness, how can a beer this thick be so watery? Just not my cup."
"Ba Review #250"
"verdict? delightful, surprised to find it so out of the way from my home base, I will definitely check this out in bottle form if I can find it back home."
"O- heavy and sweet but a delicious treat that will leave your pallet full. would be a very nice option for a good desert beer to sip on for a little while."
"Overall I enjoyed it enough to get my money's worth but would not seek out again due to high price point and availability (gone everywhere) Still it was a very solid collab that I am glad I got to try!"
"Another SN classic twist on something that goes well along with the 30th Anniversary stuff!"
"Very good beer. Hides the alcohol well and drinks smooth."
"O: A great beer in my opinion. Collaborated between Sierra Nevada and Dogfishead how can you really go wrong."
"Cheers to collaborations!"
"Overall, this is a very unique beer. I am glad I tried it at the suggestion of fellow BA’s. If you like Palo Santo Marron, chances are you’ll like this beer too."
"D/O - I really wanted to like this, but it's just a little too hot. I'm debating buying another to age for a bit, but not sure, just not really that impressed. I'm not a huge fan of SN in general, but I expected better of DFH. Couldn't finish this bomber. Just think this one might not be best as fresh as it is."
"O: I wish this came in 6-ers. I would buy this as my regular beer. This is one of the most subtly flavorful beers I have ever tried. Highly recommend."
"O= This beer was really good, I am never short of amazed by Sierra Nevada, This was a dandy, especially on tap."
"O - This was an interesting one but kind off a miss for me. Its not awful but not really my cup-o-tea."
"thanks to mjtiernan for sending this in a trade. pours a light brown with a thin head that doesn't last or leave lacing. smells of wood, syrup and citrus. tastes of syrup and trees with a hint of orange. mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. definatly a thick beer that needs to be shared with others, too much for me in one sitting. very well worth trying this one."
"O: I honestly expected a better beer from a Dogfish/Sierra Nevada collaboration beer. Way too syrupy sweet. I would not buy this again."
"Pours a deep chestnut color with a thin wispy head that fades into to oblivion quickly. Nose is actually fairly light, a bit of grain and syrup. Notes of caramel, vanilla, coffee in the taste, but a bit cloying. As it warms up, it seems to become sweeter and becomes a chore to finish the whole bottle. It's a well crafted beer without a doubt but I don't think I'd buy it again. It';s definitely on the hot side, it would probably benefit from aging for a year or two."
"D: Obviously the drinkability is very low on this. This beer should be had for dessert. Not with desert.. FOR desert."
"This wonderful beer is poured into a small brandy snifter glass. It arrives a very dark brown with a dark tan head. The head dissipates quickly with very little lacing. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, and hints of vanilla hit the nose as I take the first sip. The first sip explodes in my mouth with flavors spicy chocolate, cocoa, with hints of vanilla and coconut. It is a creamy beer with very little bitterness but the spicy chocolate lingers for a long time. Had it at Livingoods in Plattsburgh, NY with a coffee & peppercorn encrusted sirloin. The combo is fantastic."
"D: Tasty with a good complexity, goes down dangerously easy, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a good high octane beer worth drinking for a long time."
"I was down in Rehobeth beach for a vacation and went to the DFH brewpub almost every day. The one beer I kept coming back for was life and limb. I had to drink this out of a bottle in the brewpub because I couldn’t leave with it. I tried everything to get a couple of these bottles out of the brewpub but to no avail. So I drank atleast 3 or 4 of them while I was at Rehobeth beach for the week. Every time it was the same things, as I ordered it the waitress was like, ""Are you sure, you know it’s a big bottle right?"" oh trust me I knew and man was it worth it. So out of the 22 or 24oz little fatty bottle it Pours dark brown with a tanish head. smell is of sweet caramel and chocolate. Taste was sweet like maple syrup, and finished a little bitter malt, much like semi sweet chocolate. This beer was great, very upset I can’t get more of this beer (batch one). Luckly they came out with a second batch but they taste slightly different. Maybe it was just sweeter because of the atmosphere I was drinking it in. This is honestly one of my favorite beers."
"Overall: Good beer. The flavor profile seems a bit off somehow."
"O - I enjoyed this beer. While it wasnt amazing, its still a solid colaboration. Looking forward to seeing how my other bottle holds up to age."
"750ml bottle (second release, I assume from the '2' at the bottom of the label), purchased at McKinnon's in Portsmouth. Pours a dark brick-red crystal-clear body with nearly two inches of tan-colored head that persists rather nicely. Smells fruity, sweet, with malty molasses notes. Sweet maltiness mixes with booziness, brown sugar, molasses, caramel, with slight woody and dark chocolate notes to round the whole thing out. Medium in both body and carbonation. Drinkable enough, though it's a little boozy and just slightly astringent which pushes this beer into sipper territory. Interesting and it grows on me for sure, especially as it warms. Some of the flavors remind me of drinking birch beer at the fair as a kid. Glad I tried it but I'm not positive I'd be rushing out buying it again any time soon."
"Notes: Lots of strong flavors that work together well. Very nice."
"Overall: I was surprised how smooth the new batch is. They're both very good in my opinion."
"O- I thought it was an interesting beer and was expecting a ton of syrupy sweetness, but was surprised how well balanced it was. It was pretty boozy, but being 10+ ABV, it still was pretty drinkable. Going to let my bottle sit for a while and see what happens."
"Pours a black color. 1/3 inch head of an off-tan color. Slight retention and decent lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, slight dark citrus, alcohol, and spice. Fits the style of an American Strong Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight citrus, slight hop, hint of roasted malt, slight spice, alcohol, and hint of earthy malt. Overall, great aroma, body, blend, and complexity."
"I'm happy I picked this up, and even happier that I'll be able to try it again in the future. I would say sit this one down for at least a year, if not longer. I believe that the sweetness and booze will balance itself out nicely, but it's a bit messy fresh.."
"O- A bit harsh and boozy at its current state. It may age pretty well."
"Overall- Good beer. I would consider getting another, but I would not cellar it. I think it would be sweeter later and that would take away from the beer. Not to mention all the people that have tried to cellar it and it exploded on them. 4/5"
"Overall, a pretty interesting beer from Sierra Nevada and Dogfish Head. The maple syrup is a nice touch, not something you'd expect to see in a beer. A nice sipper."
"Overall: a good layered ale. great with Italian bread and probably just by itself. I have a couple more bottles of these and I will edit my review if the taste changes much with some time."
"O: This 2nd Edition of Life and Limb is amazing! It is way better than the first brewing of Life and Limb 2 years ago. I am really enjoying the more birch, roast character that was added to this variation. The last Life and Limb had a lot o fussel heat and was quite maple-ly sweet. Even after a year of aging the first Life and Limb gained even more fussel and maple sweetness, but with this one I think it will age very well and may gain more of a maple/birch profile. This variation has no fussel heat and almost is a very sessionable beer to drink. This one is very outstanding!"
"I really like this beer. It's got some porter/milk stout similarities, which I enjoy. I can see how some won't appreciate this collaboration between Sierra Nevada and Dogfish Head, but it's right up my alley."
"O -- unique beer all the way. The double peak flavor (sweet/fig and then roasted/toasted barley) had me taking more and more sips. Reminded me of the Jack Rabbit roller coaster at Kennywood with the double-dip...just after getting hit with the first wave of flavor, you get smacked with the next (and those two waves together is what makes it so interesting). I definitely want to find another to age to see where these flavors go!"
"O – Wasnt sure what to expect here with this one but it’s a fine brew. Really nice flavors come out and they blend well but you still taste each. Warming booze makes it a winnder in my book. Not overpowering but you feel it, Nice brew all around."
"O= Overall I thought this was a really good beer. I think this is a great collaboration between two wonderful breweries. I thought it was nicely down and would get it again."
"Overall, this is great beer, and it says much of the quality of manufacturing that the 10.2% ABV is almost entirely undetectable, making this quite a dangerous beverage. Even better, the flavors don't diminish during subsequent mouthfuls, meaning the beer tastes just as good halfway through the bottle. Well worth a try."
"O- I love it. It is a sipper, but the sweetness makes it enjoyable. I am gonna grab some more for the cellar. Sierra and DFH.... architects of craft beer"
"Pours a deep amber to black, with a light brown head. In the aroma, roaty, woody, and maple syrup. In the taste, caramel, maple syrup, and a dry woody flavor. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry maple syrup and wood like aftertaste. A bit sticky sweet, but a nice wood presence and it grows on you for sure."
"O: could a bit more maple-y."
"O - Quite good. Strong, but not overpowering. An enjoyable sipper."
"Very dark pour with a light beige head that sticks around for a long, long time. Aroma is very earthy oak, maple, and birch. Taste is nice and big, sweet maple, caramel, dark fruits, malty and crisp alcohol. Nice and creamy mouthfeel, made you lick your lips. By the end of the bottle you could tell it was a 10.2 % alcohol."
"One thing I really loved in this brew was the last sip of each of those glasses where just that bit of head is left. Like slurping the foam off the top of a cappacinno, delicious!"
"O: A very good beer and I look forward to what this beer has to offer in a year from now."
"Overall, this beer is pretty good. They did a good job playing some really strong flavors and aromas off each other nicely. It does get a bit to sugary in the taste for my liking but that is really the only negative. Otherwise a solid beer."
"certainly one of the most unique brews i have ever tasted. poured a slightly red hue of dark brown, with a thin cream-colored head. the smell was sharp and earthy, sweet and pungent. the taste of the beer is where i got hung up. what IS that? it isnt unpleasant, bit i cant put my finger on it. i sipped on an 8oz pour for about an hour trying to figure it out. upon consultation with the bartender, i discovered it to be alaskan birch syrup. AHA! i enjoyed my second glass much better now that i understood the ingredient that gave it such an unconventional taste. could probably make a night of drinking this beer, but i commend the creativity! definitely worth a try if you can find it."
"Overall: I found it to be both interesting and enjoyable when, to be honest, I was expecting neither. Reminded me of He'Brew Jewbelation Twelve mixed with a bit of Palo Santo, though, maybe that's just the Steak-umm talking."
"Dark opaque appearance with white head. Anise, coffee, cherry, chocolate, molasses flavors. Mouthfeel is most like the aftertaste you'd et from coffee. Bitterness and sweetness in a nice union. A little on the syrupy end. Aroma is sugary, boozy. Overall two bottles of this is pretty good for me. Lots of depth."
"Was curious exactly what this beer would be like. Contrary to my expectations, it's mostly quite subtle. A nice opaque brown appearance with a slight brown foamy head that sits on top. A little bit of spotty lacing. Smell is very clean with a tad of chocolatey malt and the slightest traces of potato, salt, and a slight souring element. Taste is slightly sweet chocolate malt forward with a huge variety of subtle flavors. The flavors overall are very subdued and slight but with good composure. A really nice beer that I could see benefitting from age."
"M/O: The beer doesn't have any overpowering characteristics. The flavors are not too strong and the carbonation really helps bring out the flavors of the beer."
"Very enjoyable beer. Life and Limb provides a number of flavors and aromas that I do not see often in beer. It is a great change of pace beer. Not a hard beer to drink though it is a bit more of a sipper than most. This is a bottle I will probably pick up again. Not one I will drink regularly but one I would appreciate on occasion and be interest to see how it evolves with age."
"O - Like most any ASA, it's always an adventure. This one did bring far more intricate flavors to the table than other ASA's I've had though. Nice big mansion of a drink this one is."
"Mouthfeel is still, thick, sticky (which isn't inappropriate for a strong ale). Overall, I think it's pretty good."
"Cork and caged version. Dark brown pour with a nice foamy beige head. Dissipates quickly with sparse lacing. Charred malt in the nose, slightly boozey. Taste is fairly nuetered. What am I supposed to be getting here? Maple? No...At least I am not getting it. Not cloyingly sweet at all, and not bitter. Not much of a hop profile. Cannot place the taste, but the only thing that comes to mind is charred meat. Body is good. Smooth and easy drinking. The alcohol is well hidden. Overall, this is a fairly underwhelming beer. It's main attraction is that is that it is a high abv that is relatively not noticeable with a smooth body that leads to easy sipping. But taste, aromoa...It's just not there for me. Overall, an added alcohol buzz to the night's consumption without the burn, but not much else. This is a beer that is just ""there"" without contributing much more. Not a repeat purchase for me."
"The Rest: A definite malt bomb. Certainly worth a try, and I think I'll be picking up another bottle to sit on for a year or two. The finish took me by surprise and I was pleased that it didn't taste as hot as I was anticipating from the aroma."
"This is an interesting beer that tastes like a Belgian in many aspects but is different enough to make it worthwhile."
"Overrated in my opinion."
"O- Just as I remembered from 2009. A very solid effort from Sierra & Dogfish Head. Like the smooth taste and full flavors (molasses, fig, chocolate, wood) that changed as the beer warmed. Enjoyed the combination of flavors and the subtle carbonation. Have a couple I'm sitting on for late Fall to see how they age. A must try ASA-"
"D - Very well constructed and tasty. I'd like to try one with some age on it, but as others have said, it is drinking just fine right now. Recommended."
"Overall this is a seriously strong, but thoroughly enjoyable ASA. It's the kind of beer that separates a Beer Advocate from the rest of the population. If you can find it still, grab it, and than grab another to put in the cellar. I have a sneaking suspicion that this will age very gracefully. Hopefully I can find another. Cheers!"
"Overall, its been a while since I've had a good ASA. I'm glad I grabbed two bottles of this brew. I sense this will age out well in my cellar."
"Overall a solid brew. I am glad that I got my hands on two bottles. I am going to sit on one for a while and see how it ages and mellows out. Defiantly worth picking up if you can still find it."
"Opinion: This is a pretty darn good beer overall. I am happy with it. It has a good blend of hops, malt, sweetness, malt blend, etc. I would definitely drink this beer again, and that is the highest testament I can give a beer."
"As much as these things can be worth the price tag, this beer is. It's tasty and unique, and it's so much better than any other beer with syrup that I've had. (They're awful when done wrong.) Might be this year's Thanksgiving beer."
"mouthfeel - sugary and nice, smooth. good strong body, decent to light carbonation"
"96."
"Pours a dark brown with some red highlights, creamy light brown head with good retention and some sticky lacing. Scent is quit ebig with lots of dark fruit notes mingling with roasted grains, dry wood and flashes of sweetness coming from notes of birch beer and maple syrup. Taste follows scent in its construction, quite complex and well blended, dark fruit (fig, prune) and roasted malts are the star, notes of earth and wood and a mildly sweet presence of syrup and rootbeer. Higher side of medium bodied, good carbonation level. Quite a satisfying sipper, bold scent and flavor make drinking a bomber on your own a tough task."
"Low light brown head that settles out fairly quickly. Aroma of toasty malt. Rich flavor of dark malts and a bit of sweetness upfront. Velvety maltiness with notes of brown sugar and root beer, some cocoa and dark fruit. Offsetting bitterness is just firm enough to be present without taking over. Notes of marshmallow and leather. Moderate and creamy mouthfeel."
"A finish of bitter coffee/roasted grain and espresso. A really nice effort."
"Overall, this is an amazing collaboration! Full flavored, smooth and BIG! Cant wait to get more bottles of this. If you see it in the store it is definitely worth picking up. Cheers!"
"Beautiful appearance with the exception of the minimal lace. Very dark brown with a healthy head. Malty aroma with a touch of raisins and spicy hopping. Big mouthfeel, lots of body and medium carbonation. Very good balance, leaning somewhat toward the malty. Dried fruit is also evident in the flavor along with a touch of oak. Earthy hopping. The alcohol is well hidden but does show up. Bittersweet chocolate finish."
"Overall, not bad. A bit boozy. Glad I tried it though. Needs to be served in the 55 degree range to help balance the alcohol and flavor."
"A big beer that is not filling. The alcohol does play a big part of the flavor but did not bother me much after the first few sips. Maybe some age would benefit this beer. Interesting and worth a try."
"Very smooth and tasty. Alcohol not detectable. Complex and interesting."
"O: All in all, I was really expecting more. It's a good beer, but not amazing. It starts and ends nice, but the middle is lacking. I'm not really digging the fruitiness and alcohol burn on this one. Many better in this, vast, style."
"O- Sat on this for a month. This beer looks like a stout. Almost smells like a stout. But it definitely(and obviously) is NOT a stout. Delicious. Admittedly that word is not very descriptive...but it is all I have for now. Will purchase again."
"Comes out of the tap a luscious warm sable with a fairly thick and fine-bubbled light tan head that sticks around for a while. Malty aroma has strong molasses and caramel notes. Mouth-filling flavor has a malty core and caramel, nutty, molasses and earthy notes plus a hint of honey sweetness. Full-bodied texture is rather smooth and has a firm, fine tingle. Risk life and limb for this 'un! ;)"
"O-Glad I was able to try this, seemed similar to DFH Chicory Stout. It was very earthy and abv does catch up to you."
"O - An awesome brew, I'll definitely watch out for this brew for years to come! Thank you for re-releasing! I can't wait to see how this brew develops in time."
"O - Good. Really glad I found a bottle, hadnt seen it before. Worth picking up if you find a bottle. Very enjoyable, just not anything truly exceptional"
"O: The on-tap version last year was tasty but this was a real treat. The mouthfeel was a huge step up."
"750ml bottle $15 (I don't know why we have to pay so much for this). Dark brown, almost black, decent head. Smells like alcohol, sugar, and malt. The flavor was malty and sweet like a certain candy I once had and cannot remember. Overall not bad at all but not great either especially given the price paid. I'll pass next time."
"D: While all of the aspects of this beer are pretty good, they don't come together in quite the symphony I had hoped for."
"One year later, its still darn good, but the fading of the hops has decreased my overall interest a bit. Alcohol heat is much reduced."
"O - yeah i wouldnt buy try it again but since i already have another bottle im going to age it for about a yr before i try it again"
"O: Definitely an interesting beer and well worth checking out."
"Creamy and thick mouthfeel that leave a semi-sticky feel behind in your mouth. Overall, and nice strong malt-forward ale that is a pleasure to sip on throughout the evening."
"A nice malty take on the style, I enjoyed the slant this took. A great fireside sipper IMO, a bit overpriced though"
"Overall. Sucked. Sierra Nevada is quickly falling down my list of liked breweries with beers like this. Big disappointment. 9 dollars I'll never get back."
"O: Wow! Delicious now. Certainly this one will continue to dry out and develop further complexity as it ages. Can't wait!!"
"O: Lots of flavors; relatively complex. An odd balance. Definitely a sipper."
"O: Had this when it first came out on tap and found it to be way too boozy. With some age on it, the alcohol is calmed down."
"Aroma is sweet but I don't pick up on any syrup. It's roasty and heavy. The fusel alcohol in the nose worries me a little as I dive in, but the taste isn't actually that harsh. I definitely pick up on the maple syrup - can't say I'd be able to identify beech syrup. This beer became pretty great as it warmed. A fairly complex but smooth sipper that's likely even better with some age on it."
"Overall I found this beer to be incredible. Already purchased more! Wrapped each bottle into a plastic bag, because of the exploding issue it seems to be having. Just sent one to a buddy of mine, hope it doesn't explode in route. If you have been debating picking one up, my vote is that you do."
"People complain about the hype that a lot of beers get and claim that few live up to it. In my experience there is a reason that the hype started in the first place. Craft beer drinkers are not stupid and are rarely swayed by hype and some even take a perverse joy in countering the hype and panning the ""overhyped"" beer. And then there are some that take anything done by the ""brewery of the week/month/year"" as gospel and overrate it. In the case of this beer it does stand up to the hype. This puts the craft back into craft beer. You can taste the care and precision in which it was constructed. Kudos to both breweries...one which constantly lives up to their press and one that sometimes falls short but gets great reviews even if their experiment yielded something that tastes all the rest of their experiments."
"Overall, a good, solid beer, but not one where I feel it necessary to grab every available bottle to store for future consumption."
"O: Definitely an american ""strong"" ale. Super boozy. Glad I bought two bottles, the other one is getting laid down for a year or two."
"I enjoyed this tulip i got, i would totally order it again,."
"I poured from a bomber into a snifter. The pour is dark brown, big foamy head, lots of lacing. The aroma is woody, dark fruits, hints of maple syrup, hot alcohol. The beer is sweet, wood and dark fruit notes. There is a definite boozy feeling with this one. The body is full, good carbonation, it drinks easier than its high ABV would let on. A solid beer, didn't live up to the hype for me, but still very enjoyable."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer and would happily seek it out again."
"I had batch 1 on tap last year (no review) and was not impressed. I'm much more impressed with this batch from the bottle."
"Drink- I always have the hope that collaborations turn out like this and not a mess. This was well put together, and big. Nice rounded flavors and a mix of things. Worked really well. Big, boozy and crisp. Ill really need another bottle to hold onto for a year."
"Overall: Excellent beer. A little sweet, but overall a very good flavor. I will probably try to pick up anther bottle or two to age."
"Primo brau. Poured with a mammoth tan foamy, frothy, sudsy head that lasts forever and a little lace. Color is a clear (I think}, very dark garnet. Aroma is massively malty, toffee, roast, caramel, graham, a little fruit, and a hint of hop. Flavor is much the same, but the different characteristics flit in and out of presence at varying rates. Times dry, sweet, bitter and always with a little tang; super interesting. Great mouth and carbonation. Finish is like flavor and actually fades with a little astringency over a vague time. Slight tweak of alcohol. Would be easy to be a session but I might get a little trashed. Bravo brewmaster(s)!!"
"Its a sweet beer because of the delicious very real tasting maple syrup but balanced so nicely with that signature Sierra Nevada hopping. This is really almost a perfect beer in my mind. Its so good on every level."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Body is pretty thin for the ABV, and carbonation is moderate. Not terrible, but again the alcohol retracts from the feel. Overall, wanted to like it and the base flavors are decent, but way too much alcohol. Not terribly impressed, unfortunately."
"I bought two bottles of this: one I'm reviewing today, the other I'm cellering for a future date. I wonder how it will change. As it stands, a great find from Sierra Nevada and Dogfish."
"O - I guess the build up for this beer left me disappointed. I enjoyed this quite a bit, and would order it on draft if i ran into it, but was ready to be blown away by it. I was actually attempting to put a bit of age on this until I encounterd a post in the forums about bottles exploding that included a comment from the owner of my store saying he had a few bottles let go out of the same case that I purchased from."
"overall, a nice beer. I had a bottle of the first batch last year at the Dogfish brewpub, I seem to remember being even more impressed by that version."
"overall, very enjoyable, big, with abv well hidden."
"Overall fairly decent despite not having as much maple zing as I expected. Better when warmed."
"D: A nice beer, worth the money? Not so much, but I am glad I tried it."
"Overall: Very good beer and I'll have to get a couple more to age them. I really enjoyed the maple aroma, probably the first beer I've had that actually smelled like maple."
"Life & Limb is a lively, dim, reddish brown ale with a dense, waxy, khaki head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a sweet, grainy aroma with notes of chocolate, canned fruit and spice. It's very full bodied and syrupy with a sticky finish. It's a touch sweet and pretty hot and boozy. It's fruity, with a hint of cherry and dates. A grassy, herbal bitterness comes out at the finish to clean things up a little. The flavor of dark chocolate and black pepper linger for a while along with alcohol heat. This is a sipper, to be sure."
"Overall, it's a good beer. It's something fun to try, but I can't quite say if it's something I'll buy again in the near future if it's still available. I just think I prefer Hair of the Dog's Adam over this one."
"On tap at the Sugar Maple. Listed as 10.5% abv. Big bitterness that's pleasant enough, not much else going on for me. No aroma, average mouthfeel. Chocolate malts,A little toast and mollasses. Darker brown colour, some head. A bit boozy, alcohol warming."
"Notes: Interesting beer with a lot of woody flavors. Pretty sweet but not overly cloying. The alcohol was a little strong and it was a little much, but not bad. Definitely improved as it warmed. I enjoyed the beer but it wasn't something I would regularly go for or drink a lot of."
"An interesting beer, not sure how much the syrups come through, i mostly just got a woodiness that was quite pleasant. Glad to try, not sure if i would go out of my way to try and find again."
"A bit cloying, but an overall complex and delicious after dinner sipper."
"Life & Limb 2 is a delicious after-dinner or late-night sipper that non-beer drinkers would enjoy; however the sweetness makes it best enjoyed in small doses; the bomber should be shared."
"Overall, I expected a bit more from a collaboration of this magnitude. Perhaps I opened this one a bit early, as it seems like aging is quite popular with it. As of now though, nothing extremely exciting for me."
"Had this on tap good aromas and very dark in collrs great tan head about two and half fingers with excellent retention the taste is how a strong ale should be, choclate aftertaste with a little but of a spice note aftertaste, overall this a pretty good beer worth trying especially if you enjoy dark ales with big body and pack a little punch"
"O - Overall this is a really tasty offering that should be shared with friends. Looking forward to see what a little age does for this one."
"M - Medium body, light to moderate carbonation."
"This year's vintage isn't terrible but it's too sweet for mass consumption. 4-6 ounces would be plenty. I had a bottle last year with some age on it; that seems to be the way to go."
"At $10 for 750 mL, definitely worth the money."
"O - This has good drinkability. It goes down easy and the flavor is really good. The maple syrup flavors here really add a nice touch, and the amount of hop presence is perfect. Overall, I really enjoyed with beer, and I definitely recommend trying it. I would buy it again."
"O: Not impressed and am going to hold onto my other two bottles for at least 2-3 and 5 years, but I am a little afraid that it won't hold up well because of the perceived thinness. A disappointment although not bad by any stretch. I would take any of the previous SN collaboration beers ahead of this one though."
"Overall - Intense flavors really make this a big drink. Not a chugger for sure. Sip and enjoy the flavors. Not something to drink all the time, this 22 oz'er is more then enough. A special occassion, share with friends! Let it warm up some to really get everything out of the flavors it has."
"Batch 2 - Deep, deep brown, almost black. Thick off tan head, some speckles, a few sheets, special no, but nice looking. Much of the aroma is derived from dark malts, some maple and alcohol aroma is detectable. Little bit'o vanilla. A rich malty flavor, rich, more vanilla, rum, and maple like flavors then anything. Somewhat one dimensional. Pretty thin for the style and finishes a tad bitter. I remember liking this more, oh well it's still pretty good."
"It's a sipper, but damn delicious...at first. By the end of the bottle I was wishing I had split it with someone. I'm really glad that I tried it though. Good collaboration between two of my favorite breweries."
"Interesting maple and birch (I think came across as woody) elements. Definitely a sweet overall beer and the syrupy feel is almost too much. I only hope my other bottle survives aging so I can try it again because I see a nice potential."
"PS: This is an amazing beer."
"O: I can really enjoy this. I have a weak spot for Strong Ales and this definitely did not disappoint. There is some extra residual sweetness that I am sure will come down if my bottle does not explode and it may calm down a bit in terms of the hops which are kept extremely mellow from the sweetness of the sugar in this brew, but overall I could definitely say I would drink it again."
"Overall, this was a pretty good brew (as expected from a Dogfish/SN collaboration). Not my favorite style but in this case, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. I enjoyed it and would not mind trying it again, perhaps at a little warmer temperature to see if other flavors begin to shine through. A solid beer by solid brewers."
"O: A decent beer. Nothing special. I think it is a must try because it is so different. Could be awesome, could be bad, but give it a shot. Will probably be a lot better with some age to tame the alcohol."
"A very nice and drinkable beer, which speaks of experienced brewing from both breweries. great job.!"
"Overall, an interesting brew. Not my cup of tea, but I enjoyed my small pour."
"O- This didn't quite meet my expectations and was lousy for the price; but it isn't totally repulsive. If you're offered a free portion, try for yourself."
"Overall: A very good collabortation from DFH and Sierra. I love both of those breweries and they made one hell of a beer."
"I would've enjoyed it a little less sweet, a little less sticky - it was definitely more toward the stout end of the ale spectrum than I expected. I'm not saying I wouldn't recommend it because that would be unfair to the beer, but if there is such a thing as a maple stout, then this might've been it."
"O: This does not make me happy. Does not make me want more. Reminds me of a RIS I did a couple years ago, the fermentation happened in the 80's and the beer took 8 months to taste right. Kinda feel like that is where this one lands; making it very sub par."
"Boozy maple syrup concoction. Pours cola brown, plenty of initial head. Nose is boozy caramel. Palate offers a very boozy maple flavored spirit.... Ahem beer. Some hops, herbs, but overall a maple liqeur like liquid in this glass. Tough to drink- good for them that drinkability was axed as a criterion."
"AWESOME! A Must try! One of a kind taste. No head retention, to big of a beer for that. Good smell. Taste...how do I explane...oh, I know, mmm! Not much of a burn for 10%. Finishes smooth, and...hum, oh, yeah, kinda like mmm."
"O: A very tasty beer. I would be happy to have another, but it would surely knock me out. Will have to grab another bottle at the store and cellar it for a while-- would be great this winter."
"With all that said, drink this fresh in my opinion, as my experience has been the maple fades out a lot, and if that is your favorite part of it, as it was for me, enjoy it now, in my humble opinion."
"Overall: Really tasty, especially if your in the mood for something sweet."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. I have to say this beer really grew on me. At first, the waves of flavors encapsulated within this beer is somewhat difficult to sift through, but as it warms, each individual aspect comes into its own and claims for itself a piece of the beer. When viewed comprehensively afterward, the resulting flavor profile is enjoyable if not a bit sporadic."
"Poured black with a thick tan head. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, and an almost cola like syrup. The flavor was a blend of maple syrup, caramel, and a light yeasty finish. It was very light bodied and the alcohol was very well hideen. Overall it was a decent beer and wasn't overpriced."
"O: this is a good brew, alcohol burn overtakes the brew a bit, nice depth and is definitely better as it warms up"
"Pours a dark tannish brown. Lots of nice tan head. Smells rusty and malty. Some nice roast on the nose and some syrupy sweetness on the tongue. Oxidized but still tasty. Smooth and rich mouthfeel. A bit bitter however which hurts it overall. Still enjoyable but not stelllar"
"O: There are some characteristics I can appreciate about the beer but the taste just wasn't there for me. The nose enticed but in the in the end I walked away unsatisfied by this one."
"O: Tastes like a high octane Brown Ale with a dry, earthy bitterness. I don't feel the maple and birch syrups made their presence known enough. Or maybe they just came through as molasses overall? This beer hides the alcohol fairly well. The appearance and mouthfeel are impressive. Would have worked better without the earthy hop bitterness. Overall it is complex and a solid American Strong Ale."
"O: Overal very interesting, great mouthfeel, the flavor is interesting and complex, and it would be a hell of a beer to have with some dark chocolate or a cigar."
"Overall: Nice to have tried but not my thing. Cheers!"
"Pours a dark mahogany, opaque and sludgy. Dense tan head that quickly fades to a thin collar with thick sheets of lacing. Aroma is sweet, maple and boozy with light oak; fairly mild all things considered. Thick body, very chewy and viscous with light carbonation. Flavor is smoother and more balanced than I remember Batch.1 being but it's still a chore to get through a glass. Maple and oak dominate with charred wood, ash, light anise, chocolate and earthy hops. Very boozy but not as solventy and depressing as Batch 1. Better, but still a novelty."
"Overall-I have a feeling this one will really beautify with age. I am glad I managed to get a handful of bottles."
"O--This was a really good beer, but it is a bit unbalanced right now. While I love the maple syrup sweetness, the alcohol is still a bit hot. I have an extra bottle that I want to age. I'm hoping that will mellow and balance this beer out to make it a new perfect brew. Enjoyable, but not quite amazing."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer. It is nice and dark with a balance of roasted malts, some hops, and sweetness of maple syrup to add to the complexity. While there is some alcohol heat, it works well with this particular beer."
"o- ive had a bottle of the original release ive been debating opening, so it was nice to try it. beer was what ive heard and expected, but i personally enjoy it. ill enjoy another."
"For me, this is too much dessert to begin with, and too abrasive for a dessert beer even if I wanted one. Maybe a few years of age will transform this beer. I hope so, because it needs to be transformed to be worth drinking again."
"A delicious and interesting release. I'm glad I still have one remaining, though it seems to lack complexity and remains somewhat simple throughout."
"O-I had not had the chance to try the first batch of this so I was excited to try this one; even though I'm not a big fan of maple syrup in beer. But this one works on every level. A very nice collaboration from two great breweries. If this ever gets released again, I'll pick up some more without hesitation."
"O - Tasty, fairly drinkable for the style."
"Serving type: bottle"
"O: I didn't know what to expect from a beer in this very general category. Life & Limb is a great beer in small doses; This was a 10oz pour that seemed like more than enough, I would never try to drink a 750 of this myself. A very good collaboration, I'm sure to buy a bottle."
"Pours an earthy brown with a large deep tan head. Has a very earthy woody scent. Taste is maple syrup and great roasted malts, with some almost chared oak notes. Mouthfeel is great but I feel like carbonation is super high on this one? Overall good beer, I would love to see what this turns into with some age on it."
"O- This was my first shot at this beer, and I really enjoyed it. Totally solid big beer between two great breweries. Highly recommended."
"O - Good beer to start a long day stuck inside watching the hurricane blow things around. Pretty smooth, despite the booziness. Probably could stand to age a bit to smooth things out more though."
"O: Not the most complex beer, but a nicely done collaboration between two of the more popular breweries. This is a good sipping beer because of the abv, and one that will fit better towards the winter months. Definitely pick a few up and lay some down"
"The taste as my wife would say is like candy sweet malt start and carbonation fills the mouth. The taste of the malts dry and leave a belgian yeast at the end."
"Wow, what a brew. Very flavorful and well bodied. A great brew to savor and I would love to age a few for the future. Great collaboration between DFH and SN. Excellent stuff here."
"Overall though this is kind of boring to me. I am not even getting a sense of the syrup in taste and smell (it comes out a little more as the brew gets room temperature but not by much). Fairly average if you ask me, but is still easily drinkable but feels like a regular run of the mill barleywine or strong ale, or perhaps a sub par one."
"Cheers!"
"O- A really big beer. The flavors mesh well and keeps you looking forward to each sip so you can continue to enjoy all the complexity this beer has to offer."
"First time ever having the opportunity of drinking this one. Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a pint glass. Pours dark hue of brown with a very generous 2 finger's width head. I'm about half way done with the pint, and the head hasn't dissipated much at all. Lots of residual lacing on the sides of the glass. The smell is very malty. Lots of carmel. Taste is wonderful. Caramel, vanilla, and a touch of toffee. Mouthfeel is very stoutesque. Thick, full. Awesome. I'm glad I finally got around to this one."
"Overall – An interesting beer. I have one bottle of the original batch I never drank. I’m curious to do a side by side tasting of that batch with this batch one day. For so “fresh” very little alcohol taste/warmth. A good beer to enjoy on a cooler “almost fall” night in Illinois."
"A pretty good beer, overall; I enjoyed drinking this and it delivers to a certain extent within the style: sweet and sticky, some heat, some contrasting elements. That being said, it's a bit muddled and not terribly complex - I think there's only so much maple and birch syrup can add to a beer - so I probably won't actively seek it out again. I'd love to try the BA version though, since I think the base would do well in a barrel."
"D: This was a decent beer, but honestly not delicious. The scent and taste were kind of messy and hot, and the body was a bit over carbonated. So it wasn't super easy to drink...seemed like it was intended to be aged. Not worth seeking out fresh."
"The use of maple here is impressive, don't see this in a big batch beer all that often. Good stuff, just a tad too strong which causes some medicinal and alcohol hints."
"OA. I like it, needs to be aged a bit. So we will review it again in a year or so."
"O: Nice, but does not live up to the hype, though a very good brew. I had the 1st batch, albeit with more age on it, and I think that was much much better (aged)"
"Batch 2, poured from a bomber. I poured the beer into a schooner, and it presents with a huge pop when you pull the cork. The beer has a tremendously dense and thick foam on the pour, light tan in color, and very frothy, almost milkshake consistency. It settles extremely slowly. This massive collection of foam is resting upon a near-black, opaque, and thick looking brew. No signs of carbonation in the glass or on the pour. You have to break up the conglomerate of head to get your nose in there, but once you do, there is a blend of sugary sweet flavors, dark and rich malt, and a boozey highlight. The beer's flavors are dark and rich, with a molasses type foundation taste that springs some woody and smokey notes. The syrups are not overpowering, but the subtle sweetness and tang does come through as the beer further warms and settles. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel, and there is a thick, solid lacing along the glass. Again, almost like drinking a milkshake. The beer has a sugary sweet and roasted/toasted aftertaste, leaving a slight smokey flavor on the palate. The booze helps to keep the aftertaste quick and light, with a slick and fast finish. Definitely warms as you drink, and will be fantastic once winter-time rolls around. Very tasty!"
"O - Not amazingly impressed with this. Which is a shame since I've been wanting to try this beer ever since I missed the first batch. Its a good beer, but the flavor and aroma just doesn't stand out. I have two more bottles, so I'm interested in seeing how this beer evolves over time. I feel like this should be sold in 4 packs rather than 750's."
"O: Very ""meh"". It's got a lot of unique flavors, but I'm not sure they're actually enjoyable. I feel like maple and birch need a sweeter beer. And I'm not sure what is giving it such a gross medicinal bitterness, but it doesn't help at all."
"Glad I bought this, but next time, I'll save it for cold weather and a share it with a loved one who has a sweet tooth."
"Thanks to the esteemed bardwashrind for providing me with this. Pours a very dark brown with lots of tan head. On the nose and palate, there is lots of sweet caramel, dark fruit, and the birch syrup, which is cloying in more than extremely small quantities (6 ounces of this beer is enough). Body is on the thicker side with medium carbonation. Overall, an interesting beer, but I don't get why this is only sold in 750 ml bottles. Because it's a ""special"" release? To make more money? Why not sell this in a regular 12 ounce bottle given the high ABV and lack of drinkability? Ugh, the unnecessary oversized bottles are getting old."
"Overall - I think this is a solid beer from DFH and SN. I loved it and I will buy it again, delicious on tap. I can't wait to try it in bottle. A beer well done!"
"WOW, I will pick this up again for sure. I didnt rate this at the highest point because I have only tried a few Strong Ales and a few Barleywines, so this was great compared to the style I have tasted so far. I have had Double Bastard but this is more towards the style I think should be tried more. Thumbs up to DFH and SN. NAILED IT."
"Definitely worth a try and kudos to Dogfish and SN for coming up with this unique ale."
"Overall: Boozy and dark in flavor. Not as complex as I remember it from the first version, but it's definitely worth seeking out and trying."
"CHEERS!!"
"Glad I was able to find this on tap! (btw, it's on tap at Finnegan's in Plainfield IL for anyone local!)"
"Pours a nice dark brown. Aroma is maple, birch and booze. The flavor and body was where the beer started to go wrong for me. The maple/birch sweetness dominates to the point of being cloying. Considering this is a Sierra Nevada product, I was expecting some hop counterbalance, but there's almost none. The finish at least is a bit dry, owing largely to the high ABV. This might be better and more balanced after 3-6 months (or more) of ageing. The wood-aged version sounds good as it might add some bite, although this did seem to have a trace of woodsiness along with the syrup/sap of the trees. This was disappointing, especially considering the pedigree of the brewery."
"Malty american barleywine with deep sweetness with hint of cherry raisins and a warming alcohol finish. This tastes more like a stong sweet belgian brown ale than an american barleywine. One might expect some burn carmel and bitter resin since this appears at first to be a malty american barleywine, but it is extremely well balanced, and the sweetness dominates along with boozy warming alcohol finish. Excellent"
"Pours an almost black body w/ great head that dies slow and leaves a lace ring. A mixed aroma as I pick up something close to that Belgian yeast w/ sugar and orange/citric notes, and I'm alsom picking up dry, roasted malts as well as somthing close to coffee or figs. Real smooth, almost creamy w/ great carbonation so it mixes in some crispness and avoids being too slick. I have to sip on it as this is also strong tasting at the same time; roasted and dry malts blend w/ a sticky, bready/woody sweetness (like caramel and maple are in there, possibly even burnt chocolate). All these malts work together and still balance with some lowkey herbal hops for a dry, somewhat bitter finish. This is a quality ale that mixes sweetness w/ heaviness and adds a touch of fruitiness to it and finishes crisp and dry - a superb ale."
"O - Opens with a Pop! Lots of layers here."
"This is not mind blowing in any way, but it is an absolute enjoyable beer that has a pretty unique taste. I don't think it's worth going crazy over to find, but if you see it, it's really worth trying."
"Excellent brew and would try again."
"Overall I would rate this beer a B."
"Never had the first iteration of this beer, but I like v2. Looking forward to see what happens to a bottle of this with a year of cellaring on it."
"Enjoyed this a lot. Opened it early due to claims of exploding bottles. Hopefully I can get another and sit on it."
"A little thinner in the mouthfeel than I would have expected; only a slight notice of the alcohol. Excellent brew overall that I would gladly have again."
"O: Overall , a pretty complex beer - as it warms it gives off a different flavor profile, smooth and creamy mouthfeel with a sweet aftertaste that seems to linger , hardley notice the high abv% . Not a bad beer glad I had a chance to try it , might get another one to see how it ages."
"Cheers!"
"O: Sierra Nevada and Dogfish Head's Life & Limb Vol. 2 is a fine example of what a collaboration beer should be. There's not always a need to go crazy - just do all of the little things right, and the beer will prosper. This brew drinks like a dream, and one that could evolve into something really special in a proper cellar."
"A quite tasty beer, but perhaps I had built my expectations up a bit much as, in the end, the beer seemed to fall short of its potential. Deep chestnut brown, verging on black. Roasted malt notes with some caramel sweetness, but a drying note helped moderate the sweetness. Background note of maple syrup, married to a resinous, woody flavor that vagely called to mind the more piney-influenced Anchor Our Special Ale editions. While there was some nice layering of flavors, overall the beer seemed to lack some needed punch, particulary for such a big beer and abv. I may put one of these back for a while just to see what it does."
"Overall I really enjoyed this and hope they make it every year from now on."
"Drinkability: This is an interesting beer. It is quite enjoyable but to be honest I expected a little more from these two craft giants. It's good, very good, in fact, but it's not great. I would love to see how this would turn out after some time in the cellar."
"Interesting beer. I'll probably throw a few in the cellar to see what happens. As it is at the moment though, I'd call it good, not great. I think the primary draw is the maple, which I would like to see in more beers."
"From the woodsy syrups added to the roasted malts and the earthy hops, this brew seriously smells and tastes like a tree in the best way possible. The sturdiness of the palate further emphasizes that vibe. I do agree with some of the other BAs here who maybe expected to be wowed a little more, but the absolutely perfect balance on the palate makes me think that this will age beautifully for at least 10+ years. I've got another in the cellar and hope to come back with an update."
"This is a complex but intriguing brew if you take the time to appreciate it, a very good beer."
"O: Overall very good, it's always nice to see a collaboration between two big breweries. This one fortunately turned out quite tasty."
"Overall: Boozy but mild - not the greatest combination. However, it tastes quite good and is a nice sipper. Glad I tried, but probably not worth it."
"o: Overall I am disappointed. I was very excited to try this so I opened my 750ml bottle soon after I bought it. Maybe some time would add some depth and soften the finish. I'm not intrigued enough to spend another $12 to find out though."
"O - Not a good looking beer by any means, but it sure had some great flavors and decent aromas. I'm satisfied with having it once on tap, I probably will not seek out a bottle of this."
"Pretty good, tastes similar to some oak ages stouts to me.  I'd have it again.  And the price is right for something that has ""Dogfish Head"" on it..."
"D: i was worried that this would be too young/a big sweet booze bomb. however, i was pleasantly surprised by the drinkability of this beer. great complexity on the palate. i think this could be put away to age, but it is a fine drinker right now!"
"Bomber of Batch #2. Pours a super dark chestnuty brown/black color with a huge, creamy tan head. Tons of lacing. Aroma is earthy and boozey. Definitely can smell some of the maple syrup. Smells somewhat nutty. Taste is creamy with maple syrup and nuts. Flavor is sweet with hints of vanilla. Sweet syrup at the end. With the creamy mouthfeel, this beer is kind of like a maple syrup milkshake. The good amount of alcohol flavor and the sweetness slows down the drinking time. Overall, its a decent beer but not something I would buy all the time. Perfect for the colder months. Glad I tried it and I am interested in aging one."
"A must have a nice stong beer and well done."
"O: Great overall beer to sip on for an extended period."
"I cant place my finger on this one, it's strong, it's an ale, and made in America. If I would guess the style they were going after, it would be an imperial brown ale with some English appeal from the malts chosen. Not a total mess and may benifit from a short stay in the cellar. Im all for innovation and this is not the norm."
"Draft to snifter. Appearance is good; deep (borderline porter). Smell Is it's weakest attribute. Malt and alcohol are present, but it could be more robust. Taste is good. Malty with an alcohol presence that gives it a mild bourbon flavor. Mouthfeel was good too. Nothing memorable, but when it's a 10% beer, that's not a bad thing. Overall, a tasty beer. Honestly, it might have scored even better had I not known it was a collaboration between two powerhouses (and my expectations weren't already uber-high)."
"This is a sipping beer which would work well with cigars or with a strong lamb stew, basically anything strong enough hold its own while drinking this."
"Overall I enjoyed this, but it's a bit challenging due to the sweetness. I may age one for a good long time."
"Apart from anything, it's great to see Dogfish and Sierra Nevada come together for this beer. Above anything, I appreciate the clear comradeship that went into this."
"Overall this is a disappointment. A expensive and alcoholic milk stout."
"Very full pint from a bomber. No meaningful aroma. Nearly-opaque dark rich, slightly brown through the corners. Thick brown head, initially well-supported by itself. No significant carbonation. Flavors of maple (low) and birch (if you search hard for it). Good maltyness. Minor alcohol notes, well balanced for a 10% beer. Not heavy in the mouthfeel, which is impressive. But overall, not as tasty as the description left me hopeful for."
"750 ml caged and corked bottle, Release 2, date stamp on bottle shows that this was bottled on June 28th, 2011. I missed out on this brew during the first release so I'm happy that this was made again. Served in a DFH Signature Glass, the beer pours dark brown with a couple inch tan head. The head retention is excellent, and there's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is sweet and malty, it smells like maple, caramel malt, molasses, raisins, and some chocolate. It tastes like maple, molasses, wood, raisins, chocolate, smoke, and a bit of booze. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy, smooth, and is well carbonated. I think this is a pretty good overall brew, I liked it a lot!"
"It was a shame how few beer snobs were able to try the first batch, so I'm so happy they decided to make a second. I'm going to age the smoked pork I'm eating besides this beer for 5 years too. On second thought, maybe I'll just age the beer."
"O-well it was a very unique beer. it wasn't bad, but not great either. it was complex, but not very well balanced. it wasn't hoppy at all like some strong ales. good but no need to have it again."
"O - Thanks to CTSparky for sharing. He sat on this bottle for a year and I think the aging served it well. A prefect beer for those who like a bit of brandy to end the day."
"hmmm. I'm not blown away, but I definitely enjoy this one. kind of an imperial nut brown/old ale crossover. I got one more for the cellar, and may pick up another bottle or two before it disappears."
"Overall, I was less of a fan of this one compared to the first one and I didn't enjoy the first one very much. It was just kind of messy. Not something I'd buy again."
"Overall, it's definitely going in the cellar for a while. I'm curious to see what flavors come out as the alcohol starts to fade. It's good now, but I have a feeling it'll get better with some time."
"Pours a super dark brown with a hue 3 inch foamy khaki head that settles to a 1 inch cap. The carbonation bubbles are quite busy, moving down to the bottom of the head. Thick foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted/roasted malt, brown sugar, molasses, and wood aromas. Taste is of roasted malt (very stout-like in flavor), burnt sugar, molasses, and a dry wood flavor. The wood flavor lingers on the palate after each sip. A low level of carbonation with a slightly flat and thick mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that I have been following ever since I heard they were going to brew it again. A good beer but not quite what I was expecting here."
"This is one complex beer. The alcohol is barely restrained on the back end. The middle is a layered mix of a really boozy beer bread, molasses and wood. Maybe some fig or prune. I'm betting this thing could age for five years. A beer to contemplate."
"Quite interesting and a delicious showcase of the relative breweries' ingredients and brewing prowess. Not something that is going to change the world, but as with the brews in Sierra Nevada's 30th Anniversary Series, this is a collaboration that will most certainly go down in history."
"I'm not sure what to make of this. All I know is that it's very filling."
"O- Wow, this was worth the wait! Sam and Ken made a really nice and unique beer. Definitely will be stocking up, can't wait to see what it is like with a little age."
"Light to medium body and a good amount of soft carbonation that helps contribute to the dry feeling on the tongue. A little lighter in body than I would like. Alcohol is present in the taste and in warmth felt on the tongue and back of the throat as you swallow. Had tried the first one on tap after it saw a year of aging and I liked that slightly more."
"Drinkability - A sipper to say the least, yet the alcohol isn't too prevalent to make you not have more then one glass. This beer shows great complexity from two brewers who have so much to offer, and when combined, can make such a well crafted gem like this. If you can find it, store a couple bottles and age them to see even more complex flavors and aromas over time"
"O: At 10.2% ABV, Life & Limb 2 is an exceptional brew that blends the roasted, earthy qualities of a smoked porter or stout with the fruity bitterness of a DIPA. Incredibly smooth, complex and flavorful. I'm glad I got a chance to try it on-tap so I can leisurely open (or cellar) a couple bottles I managed to secure."
"Edit: MUCH better with age. Just opened my 2nd and last bottle about 2 weeks ago and it was fantastic. Age this beer!"
"Poured a dark brown color, almost black... with a nice frothy tan head. you can really smell the alcohol on the nose. Coffee, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla.. no maple syrup though.. must have fermented out. To me this is a coffee stout.. but they are calling it a strong ale. I will defiantly get another bottle of this if I can still find it."
"Overall, this is just as tasty as I remember several months back when I first had this out of the bottle (with 9 mo of age on it). It is drinking great now but is a little woody/oaky and could use probably 6 months to balance out and let the flavors synergize a little more. Still really delicious and can't recommend enough."
"Overall, a very good strong ale and is definitely worth seeking out, just don't expect much hops"
"This one pours a full bodied dark, dark brown with a one finger creamy beige head that turns into a nice lacing around the glass. The aromas consist of creamy and soft chocolate, light wood (Birch I suppose), and some light and sweet maple syrup. It's overly malty but very smooth and put together nicely. I do detect some alcohol as it warms but it isn't anything over the top. It tastes of sweet and bitter chocolates, maple syrup, has moderate woodiness, some toffee and finishes smooth. It is sweet but subtly so. It drinks really smooth and creamy. I didn't expect it to be this smooth so young but it really is the final compliment of the beer. You don't get any of the abv. and it's a nice sipper. I'm really a big fan of this one. I'll have to save a few bottles to age."
"Big, complex, well balanced. There's some boozy warmth, but I wouldn't guess it is 10%. Delicious"
"Black with a brown head, nice look to it, like a real cask ale. Smells a bit boozey, but rich and deep. It's an interesting smelling beer. Tastes very smooth. Lightly carbonated, and there's a touch of alcohol, but it's overpowered by caramel hints and sweet coffee and chocolate notes. This is a full-bodied beer, but mouthfeel is a bit weak compared to the rest of this beer's qualities. Overall, this is fantastic--a nice effort by two good breweries."
"O: Lots to say about this one and I guess that is a good thing. I feel strongly that nobody does brown ales like Dogfish Head. This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but for this style, the Sierra-Dogfish collaboration was a match made in heaven."
"UPDATE: I cracked my 2nd bottle in August 2012 after letting it sit for 1 year. The age did a LOT of good for this beer IMO. The before mentioned unpleasant licorice disappeared as did a lot of the spicy hops. It was much smoother, sweeter, and enjoyable than the first bottle I had fresh. The flavors melded together very well. If you have these, I would drink them at about a year to 18 months!"
"T: Brown sugar with a little hint of chocolate and maple syrup. A slight nuttiness towards the finish."
"Mouthfeel is creamy like a nice stout. Very smooth on the palate. Its a sipper so you'll definitely take some to time to enjoy this one. A delicious beer that has a lot of elements going on for it."
"Overall Drinkability - Makes for a great sipper, as the label even states. Very enjoyable strong beer for when you want the hoppiness and alcohol of an IPA with the maltiness of a cream stout. Basically an imperial ESB if you think about it."
"O: Very good beer, but not excellent(subject to change after I age my second bottle). This is the second iteration and it's pretty good. Would defiantly recommend and as many suggest age."
"D: Really nice. Interesting mash of flavors, but it all totally works."
"Not as bad as I was expecting it to be after I heard a lot of talk about it being overly sweet. It is quite sweet and balancing bitterness is barely there. I liked how maple heavy this beer ended up being though."
"O: I really expected more from this one. It is a good beer, however it just did not blow me away as I had expected it to."
"I loved this one"
"The CPJ"
"I enjoyed this more as it warmed. Many flavors going on here with smooth mouthfeel. Very nice"
"Pours a deep brown with an inch of creamy dark tan head. Aroma is lightly nutty, with a sweet hint o syrup and hops. Mouthfeel is heavy, creamy, witha finish that is much like a milkshake. Taste is of wood, syrup, hops, vanilla, honey, and earth. Creamy, rich, and filling. Overall, great on texture and feel, but lacking something in flavor."
"Overall I am enjoying this beer, but I would not jump head over heels to drink it again. I would have one or two a year. It's a very well crafted beer, but it tastes very similar to many beers in different styles. Which could be a good thing."
"D- Struggled hard with this one and then was bailed out by Steve. No, thanks on this one again."
"D- decent drinkability. Overall a unique brew that brings out some interesting flavors. A tad astringent on the finish, bit for the most part extremely solid."
"Pours a dark brown with a large off white khaki colored head and little lacing. Aroma has a little bit of everything, floral hops, caramel, roasted malt, citrus. In the flavor, quite roasty upfront. This gives way to the hops with earthy wood notes, citrus and some pine. Caramel malt sweetness is there to balance, along with the maple. There are big flavors of pine, roast and caramel all throughout this beer. Warming alcohol is certainly there for the ride but somewhat restrained. Full bodied feel, decent balance for a beer so big. Not getting a whole lot of maple though it was used in the brewing process. Overall, a nice beer, kind of defies most styles, so the catch all American Strong Ale is appropriate here."
"I liked it quite a bit. Hope I can find another."
"A little sweet but great aroma and flavors with only a pleasant warmth from the higher ABV. Would definitely like to pick up a couple more bottles."
"Poured into a snifter. This a black color with a solid an inch of head. Smell is sweet with some hints of dark chocolate and maple. Taste is an interesting mix of smoky wood, dark chocolate, maple syrup, and molasses. Extremely sweet. The alcohol doesn't bite too badly at first, but it catches up with you after a while."
"Bottled popped with a lot of force and the carbonation showed itself when I poured. It came out a brown body with a large amount of fluffy off-white head. The creamy head lasted throughout my pint and stuck to my upper lip. Nose is heavy malt. Toasted grain and caramel sweetness. Also some piney hops and plums. Flavor is a thick malty blast of caramel and burnt molasses. The same dart fruit flavors from the nose and then some hops kick in giving a resinous pine feel that leans towards having a bitter dry finish but it is smoothed out by the large malt body. Creamy with a semi-dry finish and little trace of the alcohol. Satisfied with splitting the 220z."
"O - good brew, not my first pick but wanted to try it."
"this is my first experience with this beer and i'm pleasantly surprised. flawed, sure, but overall a really tasty brew with a good amount going on. sort of unique, too."
"Taste-Spruce, wet tree bark, damp earth, cocoa powder,raw syrup. Very complex and full of character. Faintly sweet and woody. High ABV not evident. Sip slowly and savor the subtle flavors. A nice fireside brew, maybe with a big twig of 'smores."
"Batch 2. Pours a very dark brown color with a medium off-white head that disappears rather quickly. Scent is cocoa powder with some hints of maple syrup, booze, and a lot of malt. Scent is familiar of a strong scotch ale or wee heavy. As the beer warms, the syrup and molasses really come out, along with a bit of honey and more chocolate. Taste is very similar to the smell. I read a lot of reviews saying that they don't really pick up the maple syrup in this beer, but I really get a lot of it. I get the maple syrup with dark fruits and dark chocolate. Tons or roasted and caramel malt as well. Hints of booze as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. This beer had the potential of being overly syrupy, but it is not at all. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a tasty beer. I had this the first time it was released, and was not very into craft beer...so I guess I didn't appreciate it for what it was. This beer is good, but I think a year or two will make this beer great."
"Dogfish Head and Sierra Nevada have wildly different creative approaches to their respective lines of beer, yet Life & Limb manages to interweave them nicely. It's a tasty display of teamwork now, but I’m going to buy a bottle to stash away for a year to let the malt flavors and carbonation develop."
"I really like this beer. It isn’t anything life changing or mind blowing, but it is very solid and extremely different from the usual. Now if only it were priced like sierra and not a dogfish beer!"
"O- I'm certainly glad I had this fresh so that I'll understand what it does in a year or two when I open the next one. More coffee than expected, way less Maple syrup than I was hoping for! Not sure I should be rating this as well as I have. I like the Aroma, Smell, Taste, Feel and Drinkability... it just didn't seem to drink as advertised. It doesn't make it bad, just not what I expected."
"The serving was a 750ml bottle... the glass: oversize wine glass...I think it's pretty good. To me, it's ridiculously complex. It's like a bizarre dark barleywine; it has an ABV of 10.2 percent, smells malty as hell, hints of raisin and orange on the nose... when it hits the tongue it's like chocolate and orange immediately. You get the malty alcohol kick and then there is a surprisingly long lingering aftertaste of banana in the background, but I mean really ripe banana. Overall, I'd give it a B+/A-... not my favorite for a Sierra Nevada, but pretty damn good for a Dogfish Head."
"O-This is young. I expect it will be better in a few months, and excellent in a few years."
"O: This is a very delicious beer, one that will age beautifully. It's a little sharp and thin right now, but with some time I think that will mellow out a lot."
"Overall a decent beer. I remember wondering what all the hype was over the first batch. It's ok."
"O: Earth's juice tapped straight from Mother nature itself."
"O - Overall, I really enjoyed this one, as did my bottle-sharing friend. It seems to have aged quite well, can't wait to pick up a fresh bottle after batch two comes out soon!"
"I was so glad to get a bottle of this back when it first came out. The beer poured out as a deep rich looking brown color with an off white colored head. The head was thin and didn't do too much in way of lacing. The smell of the beer has some earthy fresh wood aromas mixed with some sweet maple and some caramel too. The taste of the beer was sweet mostly. Had a very light bitterness in the back end. The mouthfeel was very silky smooth, this beer was very easy to drink. Overall I feel that this beer was a really good calaboration between two breweries who don't really make beers of this style. Very interesting."
"Very robust chewy mouthfeel with low carbonation. Overall a nice collaboration here. A pretty unique beer that is easy to enjoy and sip on. Gotta share this one though cause it's a bit boozey."
"Wow. This beer brought the thunder. Ages extremely well. Maple, caramel, citrus and wbooze are more evident and distinguished now than fresh."
". A very robust and full flavor profile, this was definitely one to sit down and think about as you go through it. A full on blast of spiced alcohol was the first thing that I noticed, kinda hot, but as it warmed it mellowed out and by the end of the session had all but blended into the background and simply become an outstanding ale. Loads of dark fruit notes were permeating through the flavor. Prunes, Raisins, Figs all very discernable in the flavor and really adding balance to it as they melded together. Lots of spice here as well, very big. The notes of oak and wood in the flavor were clearly becoming evident as it warmed, giving it a very subtle, yet very powerful presence. I can see why people rave about this; it is very unique, very dark, and very seductive almost. The flavor really needed some time to catch up with you, the first few sips were nothing compared to the last few, really outstandingt silky smoothness that really lets the flavor pop and keeps it from getting too heavy. In fact it was really not filling at all, despite how big it was it was excellent as far as that."
"O: A really good beer. It was certainly helped by the cask, but the flavors were nice and it was incredibly drinkable for 10%."
"Poured a rich brown color with a creamy light brown head. Aromas of molasses, maple, chocolate and malt. On the palate, medium bodied, with flavors of dark fruit, molasses, dark chocolate and light booze."
"Finally cracked the bottle I've been hanging onto for a bit last night at emmasdad's house. Poured a dark brown with a decent brownish head. Aroma of malt, honey, and a bit of smokiness. Taste was very nice: sweet malt, maple syrup, honey, and some kind of fruit (dates?). Alcohol is well hidden and the mouthful was smooth and creamy. Wising I'd have gotten more than just the one bottle now."
"D: I had this fresh and thought it was a little too sweet. It is drinking super nice right now. I think it still has some legs though. Just showing a touch of oxidization. Really well done."
"This is a Baby Bear beer. Which means it is Just Right."
"Overall - It's been about 5-6 months since this beer was released. I had it quickly after it was released and didn't care for it much. Way to hop-forward. Given a few months, this has aged very nicely into a very good ale."
"Dark, sweet, medium bodied, and drinkable as hell for the abv. Definitely some grape/raisin flavors dominating the brew with a bit of alcohol warmth. As it warms the lack of body and complexity shows itself but it is still a very tasty beer. Not spectacular but very good."
"The drink is pretty good. I wish I could have tried it fresh..."
"A bit disappointing. It has it's moments, but the flavors just didn't come together for me."
"Really, really good beer that bumps right up on against excellent territory; it's really developed since I had it on tap & thought ""unh, OK, whatever"". Almost worth seeking out another to see if it continues to improve. Love the maple. OK, it really does stray into excellence."
"D--Well, this is an interesting collaboration. I had a bottle I was aging and again, thanks to generosity, I got to try this a little after a year of its release. It still could use some cellar time, and I think it will benefit from it..."
"Although the alcohol is hidden quite nicely, the flavor on this one is really a bit too big to qualify as an easy drinker. Delicious, but a sipper, for sure."
"Overall impression: Quite an enjoyable sipper."
"Overall, an excellent brew and one that won't forget. I would write more but that's really all that needs to be said. Excellent brew. Loved drinking it."
"Overall, a good brew and one that will get more interesting with age. Going to wait a few years before popping the cap off my second bottle."
"D: A year of age has knocked back some of alcohol and made this an exceptionally smooth and rich dark beer. This was my favorite beer at the time when I first had it exactly one year ago today (last Christmas). While I feel my palate has matured over the year, and I've had hundreds of world class beer since then, I still feel like this is at the top end of the 'beer greatness' scale. I'm glad and have a few more bottles of this, and I wait in anticipation to see if any more ever gets brewed."
"It's a little viscous in the mouthfeel, but I imagine that's to be expected with the syrup. In summary, this is a great drinker, experimental like you expect from DFH, but also smooth and delicious. Too bad we've already cracked our bottle--I wouldn't mind another few of these."
"Overall- Very unique and good. I would definitely recommend this beer especially if you enjoy complex, thick, and slightly boozy beer."
"A lush, medium body with a creamy feel. A little hot due to the heat from the ethanol, but tolerable. I'm having no problems putting this guy back. A definite sipper; drinkability is on par for the style."
"D - Good strong ale but a bit too overwhelming with alcohol."
"Pours a nice, deep brown color with a light off white head. A small amount of lacing exists as the beer goes down. Nose brings some notes of wood and birch as well as some drier brown malts. The birch stands out a bit in the taste to me, assuming that it is the woody note I keep getting but don't really recognize. Good malt presence backing up. Slightly dry feel with a nice body. Drinks fairly well now, but I am looking forward to seeing how it ages."
"Really glad I got to experience this beer, wish it was a yearly release!"
"Picked up a bottle back in the Fall 2009 and have been aging it in the cellar ever since. Last night, my wife was making a special dessert, so I thought it would be a great night to crack it open. Served at cellar temp, and poured into Brooklyn stemmed flute glasses. Dark hazy brown color. Nice sized white head that stuck all the way up the glass. A wonderful aroma of brown sugar and molasses. Taste was just as good. It had amazing flavors of raisins, maple syrup, and sugar cane rum. Mouthfeel was very smooth, as I think the one year of age helped corral the 10% abv heat. Drinkability was high on the scale too, as this beer hit the nail on the head in every way. Wish I could have gotten my hands on a second bottle now. Paired last night very nicely with a maple sugar-apple cider-cranberry tart for dessert."
"Mouthfeel manages to stick with the dry theme, with a light, airy carbonation to stand up to the high gravity. This beer took a while to impress me, but after a few sips, I really started digging the deep, unique flavors here."
"Drinks OK for what it is. It's boozy with warming and tingly feeling which is typical for a 10% beer. Lots of sticky sweetness too, but not the minerality I was expecting."
"A dark tawny red color with touches of amber around the glass. A soft beige head dissolves away quickly, to form a small ring on top. The sweet fragrance of malt comes forward at first, then fig and raisons come out. The strong scent of alcohol hits the nose then ending with soft a chocolate fragrance. The sweet, almost sugary, flavor grabs the palate at the start of each taste. That is followed by a dried fruit flavor, with a mild bitterness takes over and finishing with sour and tart flavor. A medium to heavy feel, with a dry and boozy finish. This beer is unique in the fact, that you don't know what it is. It has the darkness and color of a stout or porter. The aroma and flavor has Belgian aspects, with a feel and finish of some IPA's."
"D - malty and sweet, but not overwhelming. The bottle is a pleasure to drink, though the alcohol permits only one. Of course, there's no reason to drink this in excess; sip and savor it, or pair with a great dessert -- my wife made a spectacular creme brulee and this complimented it very well."
"This ale is brewed with maple syrup, and I'd be happy to have it on (or in) my pancakes. At 10.2%, you can taste the sweet maltiness that gives the beers its ""oomph."" Sierra Nevada's ever-present West Coast hops are overwhelmed by the malts, so don't expect the usual bite, but if you like Belgian Strong Ales, this American version is more creative and unique."
"Seems like i should have let it sit for a while longer, a bit of a letdown but still alright."
"Overall: Not wow'ed by this one. Nice malty flavor, enough hops to keep it from going sweet, hell of an alcohol kick, but good flavor. Not sure if the cellar would help this one, but it might mellow the heat."
"D - What a great collaboration... I wish this were available on a regular basis... A malt bomb to be sure, but never does it become cloying or overpowering... There isn't too much alcoholic heat, but the 10.2% keep this from being more drinkable..."
"The body is very good, but the alcohol finish cost it a half-point. Drinkability is pretty good for a beer this strong. It'd be nice to have this in 12oz bottles instead of these huge 24's. Overall, a pretty good beer, worth trying if you see it."
"Drinkability? I'm glad this comes in the big 24 oz bottle. I can enjoy and take my time with a delicious American Strong Ale. More at one sitting? Nah, but it's a fine drop."
"This is a big-bodied sipper, that has some great flavor complexity. Good drinkability for a huge beer."
"Poured into a tulip shaped glass from the tap during Philly Beer Week. Appears a very dark brown; not quite black but dark enough to not see through the glass. Aroma of maple syrup, caramel malts, and a bit of chocolate. Tastes more on the sweet side with a slightly bitter finish. Again, syrup notes with toffee, chocolate, and a tart coffee taste. Average in carbonation. Comes with a feel that tinges your tongue tip. Ok drinkability; however, this is hard to find and pretty high in ABV."
"The flavors exhibited don't mix or balance each other out. The malt does its think and then the bitter, roasty, and woody flavor comes in but in competition. The hop bitterness lingers too long as well. Also, the booziness is a little too unrestrained. Still too young of a beer, or just possibly a miss."
"Glad I tried it, but would never chase this... (if it were brewed again)"
"The beer is a bit thin for my tastes, but is definitely drinkable if you dont get bored of it. Sadness, I love Sierra Nevada, I was hoping for something spectacular in this beer."
"I am enjoying this very much - looking forward to trying our second bottle after a year or so.."
"drinkability is nice. a touch warm, but damn tasty. somewhere between an imperial stout and a brown ale. great depth. this is one damn tasty brew! now where can i find a bunch more of this?"
"Clocking in at ten point something abv, this isn't drinkable in really any sense. While not annihilating the tongue with flavors, it is strong and it is warm in the digestive tract. I have trouble giving beers over 8% abv a higher score than 3 (average); maybe I should consider how much I like a beer more, maybe not."
"When I first heard of this collaboration between Sierra Nevada Brewing Company and Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, I was excited. The results are less impressive than the idea. Something about the flavor comes across as weird rather than satisfying. All in all, it's much more DFH than Sierra Nevada. It's pretty good stuff, and is definitely worth a try. But, I can't help but feel a little disappointed. It just never comes together like I'd hoped."
"Pours with a dark brown color and a half inch ring of foam. Smells slightly of brown sugar, a little nutty, a little Smokey, a little grassy and a little like raisons. The taste starts with a funky dried fruit sweetness with slight grassy undertones, a bit of sourness is also present as well as a rich Smokey nutty malty flavor. These flavors lead up to the sweetness of maple syrup. The maple sweetness is complemented by a smooth but still semi bitter taste of hops that balancers out the sweetness. The birch syrup is also present in the beer and adds a unique kind of grassy, tree like taste: this gives the beer a hugely unique taste. The carbonation of the beer is on the low side making it very smooth and easy to drink. I found the beer tasted better being close to room temperature. Overall an excellent collaboration that aged quite well."
"Deep dark brown color-almost borders on black but has some great deep chestnut hues around the edges when held to light. Not much in the way of head. Nice aroma-somewhat tofeeish and slightly maple like. Sweet and sticky caramel flavor. Minor vanilla notes. Somewhat of a woody/smokeish flavor. A tad boozy near the end. Very full, sweet and gummy mouthfeel. This is my 3rd time having this and I really like this. All too dangerously drinkable. Can be complex as it warms but well balanced. Kudos to both brewers for a job well done."
"Overall, this one is as well-constructed and flavorful as anything you'd expect from Sierra Nevada, plus it has a touch of the uniqueness you'd expect from Dogfish Head. Not a landmark in brewing, but a nice marriage nonetheless."
"And very drinkable for such a huge beer. Very nice offering from both brewers."
"interesting beer. worth a try."
"A winner."
"Obviously a sensational beer. After recently drinking the Bell's Batch 9000, this one seems in the same class. Where the flavors here aren't as bold, they seem less reckless and more refined. A joy to drink. Thanks Pwoody!"
"I enjoyed this with a good friend, and we both thought well of it, but I can not consider it a good value, even for its novelty."
"The feel of this beer is pretty even and mellow, goes down pretty well and is an easy drinking beer. I enjoyed each sip."
"Fairly drinkable."
"3.5 D: Overall I like this brew. I wouldn't mind if they made this one again. I wish I had another to age as this one seems like it would do well with some time on it. The only problem is that this brew warrants a 12 oz size. I wouldn't drink a 24 oz of this again by myself. A little too sweet for that much volume."
"Pours a nice mahogany with a silky tan head. Good lace and retention. Nose has maple syrup, dark candy malts and ripe pitted fruits. Taste also has a nice maple syrup presence. Bready malts, subtle hops, herbal spices, caramel and toffee. Medium body finishes a bit thick. Nice strong ale."
"Sierra Nevada & Dogfish Head, Life and Limb.Everyone is making such a huge deal about this beer. I recently saw one go for $80 on ebay! Personally I am hoping this one will get better with age. It was good, not fantastic, and definitely not worth the $80 that people are paying. But for $10, it' s a good beer that I would suggest you age and see if it gets any better. It poured almost black. It smelled like molasses, raisins, prunes, chocolate but no hops. It tatsed like dark chocolate, coffee, burnt caramel, and it was a bit spicy. It was thick in my mouth and you can definitely taste the alcohol. The spiciness added an interesting character to the beer body. But I am hoping the alcohol will mellow out a bit in a year. I wonder how much the bottles will go for then?"
"Overall: While the beer lacks aroma characteristics, the real payout is in the flavor and body. Rich cherries and candi sweetness really set the beer off well against the alcohol, which always seems to be playing into the mix. An excellent late night quiet sipper that I would try to categorize as a Barley Wine, but the candi sugar throws it into a style all it's own."
"Completely underwhelming. Dark pour, decent head. Aroma is mostly malt, touch of toffee and coffee. Faint maple, no birch. Taste is similar, loads of malt, faint toffe and caramel, perhaps a touch of maple and molasses. A couple standard dark fruits like figs and raisins also. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky. I have no clue why there was so much hype on this one, it certainly didn't deserve it."
"Drinkability: very drinkable in my opinion, despite having a complex taste and decent amount of alcohol, I had to slow myself down from drinking this one too quickly. Overall a good beer that seems like it will age fairly well."
"D: Quite drinkable, glad I tried this brew but I was left just slightly underwhelmed."
"When these bottles first showed, they were limited & thus i went on a mad rush once a friend let me know of their arrival. This collaborative effort sounded amazing and on a dreary winter's evening I settled at home with one. A dark, dark brown with the slightest hint of dark orange edges, poured smoothly but lighter than expected. An opaque dark brown and trace head and lace with a dark sweet cocoa aroma and standard hops did not impress, but certainly did not disappoint. A bit standard tasting as well, but tasty at that, with dark chocolate, coffee, plum and a dash of hops in a medium body and quite drinkable. No complaints here, I just expected more for something initially called a Belgian Porter from Sierra Nevada & Dogfish. My fault I suppose."
"Pours dark but not black. Aroma of chocolate, medicinal notes, and maple syrup. Great flavors of chocolate, cocoa, medicinal, dry hops. Light in body and the alcohol hides perfectly behind decadent flavors. This beer is truly a collabo of great minds. A perfectly crafted drink."
"Pours an opaque black-brown with about a finger of khaki head that leaves no real lacing to speak of. The nose is dark malts, molasses, syrup, grapes, raisins, and figs. The taste follows a great deal, with the malts, molasses, raisins, figs, and plums coming through, along with a darker bit of syrup, oak, some hoppy bitterness, and even a tiny hint of smoke. The body is lightly heavy, with moderate carbonation and a very thick, chewy, and still somewhat smooth feel. Overall, the drinability is pretty high, though this brew stands better as a sipper than a gulper."
"Carbonation holds up well given the time of exposure for the beer and helps to offer a smooth feel throughout. Drinkability is good 'for the style' in that it never reveals a harsh bitterness or a one-sided sweetness that might deter. Tastes like a Barleywine towards the conclusion yet offers hints of a Fruity Belgian early on. Unique and worth a try though surely not a perfect match to any style and in fact morphs a bit throughout."
"Pours dark, but not quite black, a nice deep mahogany brown, with a hint of blackness in there. The head is very thin, the bubbles fade fast, and there is absolutely no lacing. Looks average - and I have no idea what to expect from the sight. The smell has a big of coffee and chocolate in it, but there's a rum-like sweetness, which is probably just the smell of alcohol that comes from a source other than fermented maltose. I can even smell a bit of tobacco leaves in there, earthy and herbal kind of. The smell is kind of lost somewhere between a mixed drink, a belgian quad, and a brown ale. But still, a little more enticing than the look. The flavor is fruity. Reminds me of rotten plums, like the ones that fall off the tree and have laid there for a couple days. I can taste the maple syrup, too, dried out from fermentation. There are flavors of wood, rum, and toffee. I get a bit of the roasty, chocolatey in there too. And I can taste the leaves, like burning leaves - not in a bad way, but like earthy, nearly charred, herbal flavors - kind of like the tobacco from the smell - a combination of the hops, probably, maybe a bit of the darker malts, and the fermentation temps (ester production) are the most likely culprits for this. I guess a lot of what I've described sounds bad - but the beer isn't actually bad. I will say that I was interested in it, which, actually, I suppose, usually means something bad from a beer persons mouth. I can definitely taste and feel the alcohol, but he body is kind of medium, thinner than a beer this strong should be. The carbonation, for what it lacked in head production, sure does bite in the beer. This beer, for what it has in pre-drinking intersted, kind of lacks overall. It was okay, but not sensation, probably would be worse if it didn't have SN and DFH name on it - you know? You really kind of wan to like it more than you actually do."
"Arrives at my table in a snifter. Dark brown, almost black with a beige head. Moderate retention and good lacing. I am not sure if a beer can smell dark brown, but this one does. Brown sugar, toasty malt, some maple and perhaps a hint of pine. The taste is quite wonderful and much more balanced than I had expected. There is definite maple flavor in there, but it mingles well with the dark malts and a very nice brown sugar/molasses like malt base. Other guests to the flavor party include chocolate, coffee, raisins and even some pine. It is worth noting that this beer carries much more bitterness than I expected. This is definitely a welcomed attribute. Mouthfeel is on the fuller side of medium with a somewhat sticky finish that seems appropriate with this brew. The alcoholic warmth is definitely there, but not in your face. I would not call this a session brew by any means, but it is a great sipper and a fine collaboration between two of America's best breweries."
"Daniel"
"This is pretty easy to drink, let's look at the label...wow, 10.2%. You can definitely taste the alcohol warming but it is hidden well. This bomber will sit easily inside my belly. Do I want another you ask, sure. But if you are going to charge me another 17$ for 24ounces, no thanks."
"Draught @ Plan B in Simsbury: This one poured a fairly opaque brown color. There was a small tan head that didn't linger at all but left a good deal of lacing. Surprised the aroma was a bit light, even after it warmed up. Still, it was very nice. Some maple, peppery notes, spicy and some faint fruits. There is also some maple to the taste, as well as being slightly spicy with some faint dark fruits. Slightly bitter to the finish. Medium bodied, and the alcohol was not noticeable. Also slightly bready and yeasty. Very Good!"
"- Not too bad, though... still hot after some months.. the flavor is there, and nice... but it is a bit messy. Overall not bad."
"This dark crimson brew has a slightly foamy off-white head. Lots of alcohol and sweet sugar show through in the aroma, but the taste is rather reserved. Malty sweetness starts out before a noticeable bitterness takes over. Hints or dark caramel, toffee and milk chocolate define the taste, finished by a semi-sweet, citric bitterness. A fine strong ale here, very warming but not all that thick. Was hoping for something a little more unique from two of my favorite breweries, but this is still a very good brew to be had for any beer geek."
"D- 10.2 percent is very well hidden. I made my way through a 13 ounce chalice pretty quickly. I was very impressed with this sierrva nevada dogfish collaboration. This was very limited in CT and I think it's very cool Plan B held onto this for a while and is now busting it out on tap."
"D - So, does this beer live up to the hype? No, but I didn't expect it to and, really, the excitement surrounding the release of this beer last fall was more about its sometimes extreme scarcity than it was about the quality of the beer itself. That being said, it is an enjoyable and unique beer. Much of what it going on here is caramel malt character that dominates the flavor and aroma. It has a satisfying richness, but it doesn't come across as engrossingly complex as some English Barleywines and Old Ales do. Fortunately, the dark caramel is not all that this beer has to offer. There is also a significant depth of character and complexity that is imparted the the use of birch and maple syrups. These complex sugars seem to give the beer an agreeable molasses quality while also imbuing it with a spicy essence that is much nicer that the spice character found in most beers that contain actual spices. Overall, it functions as a nice, smooth winter warmer that hides its alcohol well and incorporates some unique spicy characteristics without overwhelming the drinker."
"it's certainly a warm one, and bitter"
"F- thick and slick. resinous, syrupy oils that coat and stay, but once they mellow, you want it again."
"A very complex malty/sweet beer that has a bitter finish and hidden alcohol. Alot of flavors to think about, and its an obviously well crafted beer. Drinkable even with the price and hype."
"...as you can probably tell I took my time on this one and the beer did evolve quite a bit over the course of an hour. Scoop it up if you can find it."
"As you all know since you have read my bio, I'm not a fan of stouts or dark beers, but this is a sexy beer. In fact, this beer is so sexy, it's like Aunt Jamima served me this beer in a bikini, all while pouring maple syrup all over my pancakes. On a serious note, this beer was definitely worth the wait and creativity that Dogfish and Sierra put into it. The beer truly gets better after every sip. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone that can currently find it, if not you'll have to wait until next year."
"d - Overall this was a pretty good beer, but a little disappointing because I had great things about it. Nice sweet malt/syrup taste, a little hot but not bad. Would definitely try again, but will probably hold onto my other bottle of this for a bit."
"Poured deep ruby with an off-white head. Caramel, roastiness, and a hint of figs in the nose. The taste is very similar but there is more roasted barley and robustness that gives a bittersweet finish. Medium bodied with smooth carbonation. The sweet finish is almost cloying for this beer. Decently drinkable though."
"I considered it a bad omen when the lip chipped of the bottle whilst i tried to open it but no glass fell in so i feel good about this beer. YAY!"
"I expected some great things from this beer and I found it to be very good, but not what I expected. The hype did not match the product. Still a very good beer."
"Suffers a little bit on drinkability, as it overwhelms the palate somewhat a few ounces into it. This is a good beer overall, but not as awesome as I hoped it would be when I first heard about it. FT: my remaining bottle...or maybe I'll just age it for awhile and see what happens."
"Mouthfeel is very rich and creamy. No hint of alcohol. It goes down real smooth. Drinkability is good for a beer of this octane. Complex enough for this to be a slow sipper, but creamy and tasty enough to sip a lot of it. Very nice!!"
"D - Too big for more than one."
"Pours a three finger light brown head that fades slowly to a ring, leaving a good lace. Deep brown/mahogany color. Very light maple syrup nose. Medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Flavor has hints of maple syrup, hops; balanced not cloying; high ABV is hidden. Nice strong ale. Worth trying at $10.00 for a 24oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Drinkability? A bit lifeless(yes, pun intended)...and limb-less. Not that bad but not living up to the hype that surrounded this beer."
"two reliable breweries. Seemingly more DFH influence here, but nothing to complain about."
"Overall i can say i enjoyed this beer and it's unique flavor. Would be interested to see how it turns out after some longer aging."
"This is going down too quickly. Get it if you see it!!!"
"D - This was a very good beer but its strong making it a slow sipper but I really enjoyed the way it tasted too bad the store limited it to one per person worth finding to try"
"Medium body overall with a creamy and smooth texture. Goes down pretty darn easy for the ABV. Overall this was a good collaboration and a tasty brew."
"Dark brown, bordering on black with a one-finger tan head that dissipates quickly leaving little to no lacing behind. Smells sweet and a bit vinous like someone spilled a cask of wine in a candy store. A little maltiness and hoppiness is noticed as well as some dark fruits and distant phenols. Taste isn't as sweet as the smell, but the vinous qualities are still present. You can really tell that SN is involved with this brew, as the hops are more prevalent than in most Belgian Strongs. That being said, they're well integrated, and enhance the experience. On the other hand DFH puts it's mark on things with the sweet, brandy-like sweetness that lingers throughout. Some ripened grapes and some grain are also noticed on the palate. Goes down fairly dry with a slightly creamy middle. Alcohol is hidden, but becomes more noticeable as the brew warms. Great collaboration leads to a distinct and tasty brew."
"Reminds me of Schmaltz's Monumental Jewbelation 10th anniversary beer of a few years ago... just this big, dark, warming, dessert-like beer, one that takes some time and patience to decipher."
"D- So well integrated and light on the palate with little to no alcohol burn makes this bre.w highly drinkable. Highly recommended"
"Pretty good, especially if you like maple. Drink it a bit colder than normal, however. As it warmed it became a bit overwhelming."
"Drinkability: A definite sipper - no hiding the booze in this one. The overall flavor seems somewhat mild, almost to the point of being bland. As it is right now, it's probably not one I would seek out again, but I might pick up a bottle to sit on and age for awhile."
"Feel and Drinkability: Pretty heavy on the palate. Cabonation is low and the body is overall thick and smooth. Warms a bit as it goes down. Definitely one that I'm enjoying, though more than one 24oz bottle would be hard to drink. This is one to sip on over the course of a night/day etc... Glad I got to try it, but like I said before there's nothing all that great about it to make me want to buy another bottle."
"Pretty good beer, glad I had it on-tap at Hopcat; thanks Steve."
"Nice beer. Seet matls in the middle dry out at the finish than to be over taken again by a raisiny sweetness. Plum and toffee, with spent coffee grounds and dark chocolates. Very dark fruits that give a round middle are big and complex. Bitter hops on the end. Complex and good and ageable."
"This beer pours a dull black color with very light off-white lacing. The aroma is mild, but with rich roasted malts. More roasted malts (lots!) in the taste with hints of coffee. There's a bit of bitterness in the aftertatse, but it is nicely balanced with a cream-like flavor. Medium-bodied and really smooth; virtually no carbonation. A rather enjoyable strong ale that doesn't taste of the strong alcohol. Definitely worth a try."
"Though, it's listed as an American Strong Ale, it's almost like a combination of that and a stout. Original and delicious use of birch and maple in the mouthfeel and taste. The nose could be a little more telling but all in all, this beer deserves every desperate beer nerd that is seeking it out."
"D: Great collaborative effort by two fantastic breweries. The alcohol is disguised very well - would not have guess this was 10%. It was very easy to drink but caught up to me at the end, limiting me to just one glass. If you see this in your area, try it!"
"This is a very nice strong ale."
"No offense, but I was really surprised by this. I actually liked it a lot more than I thought, though it didn't have the quirky, esoteric qualities I was expecting."
"This is an excellent beer, and I wish I had more!"
"Pours a dark red Ruby with the thick tan head. Fairly tight nose with some sweetness and some light banana notes. Very strong flavor right off the bat. The sweetness is almost overwhelming for a second, then a good bit of wood and a background of banana, probably from the maple syrup. Super creamy, which goes well with the sweetness. Somewhere between medium and light bodied. I think the initial blast of flavor is a touch too much especially when combined with the level of sweetness."
"Overall: A nice offering, but a little bit to much hype and not as much show... I want more out of my collaboration brews."
"I was going into this beer like everyone else, high expectations. It just didn't do it for me, I really wish it did. I still love Dogfish and I still love Sierra, just not together I guess. I have another bottle I traded for, maybe in a year I will crack it open and see what happens."
"overall an very strong example of the style - compilations between very good breweries is awesome!"
"Pours a cola brown with dark ruby and amber highlights when held to the light. The hed is about one and a half fingers thick, and reminiscent of latte foam. This head lasts for about a half an hour of sipping before it dissipates. The aroma is dark roasted malt faintly recognizable amidst sweet maple syrups, toasted malts molasses offset some by just enough hopping to make the aroma not overly sweet. Great mix of deep roasted malt, maple syrupy sweetness , and earthy hop bitterness for balance this is a great beer. Although I sometimes wnder if the earthy flavors are from the birch syrup or the hops? PLus the alcohol warms things up at the very end of this syrupy sweet yet roasted palate beer. Great sipper and a great bottle to save as a conversation piece."
"drinkability: Did not disapoint. It's a wrold class colaboration"
"I think this is one of the more complex beers I have had in awhile, or maybe it was just that I really sat down and tried to give this one the attention it deserved since it was a collaboration between two breweries who I like. Regardless, overall it was a quality beer."
"Wow...this is an American Stong Ale?!?! More like a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Dark Belgian candi, dark fruits, sugars...mmm. Wow, I definitely didn't expect this one to taste so good based off of ratings. Some smokey malts...a big sweet front taste, with only slight bitters in the rear. Creamy thick sweet mouthfeel...very good!"
"D: a great brew from a couple of America's finest brewers. Worth seeking out."
"D: Hides the alcohol but i don't think i have an urge for more than this bottle. This beer is very average. Pretty disappointed from a beer made by two of my favorites."
"D - I am sharing the 24 oz bottle, but sharing a 12 oz would have been better. I just don't want that much."
"A dark clear brown color with a lot of carbonation, has a nice off white head that stays a laces nicely. Smells of sweet malts and some hoppy notes. First drink reminds me of a slightly hopped brown ale with more sweetness. A nice smooth drink, some caramel flavors and nice a small hoppy crisp taste in the middle but smooths out in the end. I really enjoyed this beer but I was hoping for something a little more.. I'd like to have it again though.."
"D-this is a little boozy and the alcohol is present throughout. however, it has a great mouthfeel and a nice malty sweetness to it. Appears that it will be truly awesome as the carbonation settles and the alcohol begins to mild."
"Got one in the cellar to see what happens when some of the heat burns off. Looking forward to it."
"24oz brown bottle. A rigorous pour reveals an opaque, deep brown with some bright red hues at the fringes of the glass with a tight cascade of light brown, tiny bubbles creating a cool effect atop the ale. Retention and lacing are excellent. Aromas are sweet with scents of malt and brown sugar. It's boozy right from the beginning and the booze continues to the finish, with notes of brown sugar, anise, vanilla, slight maple, and wood (maybe some mild pine from the hops and is somewhat oaky as well). Finishes boozy, as mentioned, along with a hint of white pepper. Mouth-feel is creamy, smooth, and medium-to-full bodied. Overall, I really enjoyed this one, but it seemed to lack some complexity. Glad I tried it, but wouldn't be persuaded to buy it again if I saw it."
"Drinkability- Definitely not what I was expecting. When I tried the beer I had no idea what was in it. I didn't get any of the maple syrup aspect in the taste as it was just pure licorice to me. Definitely interesting but the 7oz was plenty."
"Pours a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little one-finger creamy light tan head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some nice toffee/caramel notes, picking up some alcohol in the nose. The taste is sweet, malty, and lots of toffee/caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a pretty nice brew, glad to get some to try out."
"Drinkability: I'm having a hard time getting excited about this brew as it is just too unbalanced for my palate"
"Update: After having this beer in the bottle I found it to be much less cloying than I originally perceived. Because of this I am raising the taste and mouth feel points."
"(D)- I am glad I got the chance to try this due to its a collaboration from two breweries whom I respect and enjoy very much, but this is a little dissapointing; dont get me wrong, its good, but I was expecting more. Perhaps a few more months in the cellar will soften its edges?"
"This is a pretty big disappointment for a collaboration between two of craft beer's legends. Perhaps my other bottle will come oigether in a few months?"
"D - Overall this is a drinkable beer. I am keeping a bottle to cellar to see what time does to the overall feel of the beer. Hopefully it will get better with age."
"Nice dark pour,, minimal head, nose of a stout. Slight hop bitterness of an aftertaste. This is an interesting collaboration, not prominent flavours prevail, just the hype was worth the taste. Some say it is reminiscent of the Kentucky Breakfast Stout from Founders, however, I must totally disagree!!! From the minds of Dogfish Head Brewery, I expect a better brew!!!"
"T, M & D: Red grape, rasiin, & maple syrup came to party too. Light alcohol (well-hidden considering) on the back end of the palate. Medium body and lively carbonation. This is clearly the big brother and much, much better than Limb & Life. Although I was still a litttle disappointed, certainly a valiant effort and definitely an above average brew."
"Extremely drinkable big ale with lots of character and layers in each sip."
"life and limb...if you can find it, drink it...damn good beer for the holidays!"
"Gets close to two fingers of deep brown, solid mixture of foam and mixed bubble sizes, very good retention, the lacing ain't too shabby neither. Very close to black in color but stays within the bounds of darkest brown, a touch of orange gets through at the rims. Relaxed and easygoing nose of milk chocolate, raisins and dates, honey, rum, molasses, gingerbread, sweet but not ""sugary"" per se, quick burst of pepperiness and trace of earthy leafiness, minimal hops presence. Full-bodied, not heavy but has a big bottom, not a beer with swift pacing in the mouth. The carbonation has a nice fineness to it, not too fluffy. Straightforward caramel, honey, molasses, chocolate flavoring, little deviation from the nose. More breadiness and powdery texture. You get some mixed citrus zing and generalized hoppiness but little of distinct character. Earth, straw and pepper bloom through the finish. Maybe even some bacon. Solid, if unspectacular. (Collaboration between Sierra Nevada and Dogfish Head)"
"Drinkability: definitely a slow sipping beer due to higher alcohol, but this has a great flavor. If you can find this, get your hands on it."
"I have a couple of these put away and will be anxious to see how they age."
"The beer pours a dark brown/black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a warm, roasted malt scent along with some burnt toffee and hops. I guess the Birch and Maple add some aroma, but it's muddled within the malt bill. The taste is great! It has a complex array of flavors that begin with a solid malt bill of pale and roasted malts along with very nice hop character. The maple and birch syrup adds another layer of complexity. The maple character really compliments the hops. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine beer. Again, a brewer collaboration has spawned an instant classic."
"D: surprisingly drinkable, hides alcohol well."
"Many suggest aging it. I'd say drink one now, save one for 1-2 years. I suspect the tiny amount of zip you get with it will fade and become sweet and more alcoholic with age."
"D - A bit overly boozy but it makes for a good winter sipper. The label evokes feelings of late springtime or early summer, but it certainly works well as a winter beer."
"Like these new things from Sierra Nevada."
"Overall, I expected a lot more richness and complexity from these two great breweries. I think this could improve drastically in a few years but right now it's a pass."
"My recommendation: age it. Doesn't really seem to be worth drinking now, so you may as well set it back for a few years to see what it does. Even if it turns out lackluster, that doesn't, to my palate anyway, make it a loss."
"Poured into Franciscan Goblet. Dark strong choclate coffee ale. Definitely could smell nice aroma and taste of maple syrup. Light/med thickness with a mild bite in the beginning; smoothing out beautifully with a nice warm feeling. Overall I enjoyed my night with my lady!"
"Notes: This might do well with some cellaring. But actually, despite all the hype, and being a decent brew, it is well far from deserving half as much of the attention. I´d sure be happy to be proved wrong a few years from now, cause right now much as I typically like DFH (and even SN for that matter) I would deter anyone from the urge to get a second bottle, let alone the first one. The hype is its shepherd ,and by design it is hurting a fairly decent if also forgettable brew."
"It's a cool beer. Yet I don't really want a full bomber of it. I would like to have it again, certainly, but I'm very content to share it."
"Other reviews Seemed a little tough on this one but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Should have splurged on another bottle."
"Overall, this is an ok beer, which, unfortunately, is kind of what i expected out of these two giant craft monsters. I'm sure others will love it, and i don't mean to trash either brewery, as i am a big fan of some of their offerings, but i just think they could have done better with this one. Certainly worth a try, but the price tag is pretty monsterous, despite the high abv. We'll see how it does with some age, hopefully it works wonders, but until i see how these do with at least a year on them, i won't be excited to open another."
"Mouthfeel was medium to full. Creamy."
"Pours a really dark brown with the faintest of garnet highlights when held to light and a good sized tan head the recedes slowly. Smells of molasses, brown sugar, slightly bready/nutty with a hint of alcohol. Maple and birch can't be found, although I wouldn't know the smell of birch sap if it was there. Taste is a bit on the sweet side. I get lots of caramel and brown sugars, a woody almost oak note in there, some earthy tones and a lingering sweet malt and alcohol finish. Maybe its a yeast thing, but as soon as I tasted this I thought DFH. Light carbonation, big body with a creamy/syrupy mouthfeel. I thought this came together well for the diversity of ingredients involved. I honestly couldn't find any maple or birch in this. Maybe the bottle I put away for a while will develop those flavors for me. I liked it quite a bit actually."
"mouthfeel: pretty thin at first but goes into syrup mode and leaves a stickyness. once again, me no likey."
"Dark Strong ale with a little bit of a Belgian feel to it. Big head with craters, birch and maple syrup in the nose along with caramelized brown sugar and mild chocolate coffee. The taste score almost earns the next highest score, maybe will with some age. More birch and maple with the birch more prominent. Not the most complex example but extremely well crafted and tasty, a true treat. Great feel to this beer with a light thickness, a fluffy character while being heavy at the same time, very creamy and silky. Nice to have a beer where there is no trace of a weakness."
"A pretty solid beer that I'm glad I got to try. Plan to age my other bottle to see how that goes, since fresh(ish) it's pretty sweet."
"Cheers!"
"I have no notes on this beer. The birch flavor stands out and is memorable for me. I also picked up a dark brown sugar flavor, though I understand it is maple syrup. Cool concept beer. GREAT label. Had the Limb and Life the same night and enjoyed this more due to its better balance of malt and hops."
"So was it worth driving the 50 minutes to Lakeville MA for this beer? Well yes and no. Yes because the pure joy of the concept of Dogfish and SN doing a collaboration is awesome. Upon pouring I realized i was getting into something interesting. And the taste, reminded me of a slightly twisted Stone Arrogant Bastard replica. It wasnt by any means as brutally bitter, but had that same consistency and bite to it. This however had a little more too it with the maple hints with some dark spice. All in all a pleasure to drink, and would grab another one in a heartbeat, if there were any more left...."
"This beer was an enigma. At first blush, I cursed SN for going against their hop-infused principals, but the longer I let this Strong Ale mature, the more I enjoyed/craved it. I recommend sipping this after a nice meal to tempt you into a nice, long sleep; preferably in front of a fire and snow on the windowsill. Find it, drink it, and enjoy it. It's a rarity."
"Dark Stout like appearance, with burnt red hue through the bottom of the glass. Short lived tan head, but kept a steady thin layer of foam on top, with some lacing. I feel almost a ""stout"" body but with dark fruit and chocolate covered Cherries, and I imagine the unknown ""sweet"" taste is the maple? not real sure what to think of this 10.2% monster, but the more I drank and the warmer it got, I really started to get into this beer. Flavor's burst, and so did a ""Light"" alcohol burn on the back of the throat. This wasn't a Well balanced beer, but interesting and worth the $10. Now to find Limb and Life."
"Hmm, intrigued by the label listing some ingredients. Was hoping for a hoppy, SN offering, but this is not looking so good. Poured murky brown with a fluffy off-white head. Okay lacing. Strange nose. Can really smell the maple syrup and roasted malt. There is a smell in there I just can't describe. Like a molasses/tree bark/wet leaves/cocoa powder mess. Its not pleasant, but interesting. Taste was okay. Coffee, cocoa, maple syrup and the birch as advertised. Reminiscent of the Sam Adams Root Beer from that 1700's/Presidential series. Except the Root Beer is blended with a nice porter. It could have used more hops, because this just felt flat in mouthfeel and taste."
"Overall- I think I'll like this better with some age."
"Poured from the bottle into an tumbler. Pours a nice thick dark ruby/brown with a tan head. Limited lacing. Initial aromas are definitely roasted malts and sweetness of the maple syrup. Taste is sweet initially with the malts being very present seem to taste some bitterness following with a hint of coffee, maybe chocolate. Feel is medium to full bodied, leaning to the full side, with some light tight carbonation. Alcohol warming is present and noticeable in the aftertaste. Overall a good beer, with great unique attributes. ABV limits sessionability as does the sweetness in my opinion."
"It has a creamy medium-to-full body. A bit more carbonated than expected. Almost reaches the notch higher in score, but has a certain just too much carbonation, though it does keep it from sitting too heavy on the palate. Alcohol does come across too raw though. ""Interesting", but that's about it."
"D = I really like this beer but it has strong flavors and is not yet well integrated. This makes it a sipper and one that you probably do not want too much of at once. I am curious to come back to this in a few years though and see if it has improved in this category."
"The combination of syrupyness and the sweet taste make it hard to have more than a glass, but this is still a great beer."
"Drinkability- I thought it was really good. I wish I could get more. I enjoyed it."
"Taste is more of the same. But the sweetness allows for a very incredibly smooth mouthfeel. This beer is around 10%, but you won't find a more hidden, or smoother beer at that level. There's a very nice sweetness from the maple syrup that comes through in the finish. Not overly complex or bringing a whole lot to the table. But still a very smooth, easy drinking and enjoyable beer."
"I was expecting to be a little let down by this one considering all of the hype/excitement surrounding it, but I thoroughly enjoyed this, and I plan on keeping the other two bottles to see what a little time does to this one. It reminded me a little of some of the He'Brew Jewbelation beers I've had over the couple of years. If you liked 10 and 12, I think you'll enjoy this."
"I can't comment on the value of this beer because I had to pay considerably more than shelf price for mine. I will say it's a nice beer and one worth trying... just ashame it's not available like your average 6 pack."
" I had this beer in a bottle previously and this was nothing like it. Different aromas, flavors, and appearance. Seeing the other reviews here, I was hoping I just got a bad bottle before. I think my bottle was off, but the keg version was still nothing to write home about."
"D - Pretty good beer. Not something I'd want to down a sixer of, but would be great with a dessert and is certainly ripe for beer tasting events. Great collaboration."
"A sipping beer, an after-dinner beer. Too much residual sugar for my tastes, but intriguing all the same. Imbibe with caution - a serious ass-kicker!"
"D- Man. Such a good, yet dangerous brew. I can already feel the buzz from this one after half the bottle. I couldn't have more then one in a night and I don't know if I ever will have more then just one of this wonderful brew ever again unless I can find it again before its gone. Definitely happy I got to try this and will have no issues trying the next DFH/Sierra Nevada collaboration."
"A decent sipping beer."
"Overall- Alc. is well hidden yet warming in the end. A good sipper."
"Pours an extremely dark mahogany with a tan froth, above average lacing, & above average retention. The beer offers a very inviting nose that is rich and complex. Somewhat pronounced aromas of cinnamon, brown sugar, maple syrup, lightly roasted caramel malts, dried red fruits, plum, a banana like ester quality, chocolate mousse, sweet-sweet alcohol, light citrus/orange hops, vanilla sponge cake, a delicate smokiness, & cherry candy follow through on the palate with an addition of a subtle oak profile. There is an unbalanced alcohol flavor on the midpalate that is accompanied by a wonderful hop presence on the back end that dries the mouth rather than offering only bitterness. The beer is rich and full with a silky/creamy texture and a long finish. Overall a fantastic beer that I highly recommend."
"M/D- There is a very slick and heavy viscosity to this beer; so much so that you could share a 24oz bottle with several friends. Interesting collaboration and very cool idea but definitely wouldn't shell out $12-13 for more than one."
"M - Very substantial. Thick, viscous, velvety smooth brew."
"Live Oak Market. One of the best from the two best brewers! Waited a long time for it to finally come to Texas and when it did it went quick. Limited amount so it was pick and chose as far as who got it. You could really taste the two breweries subtle taste. The hops from both stood out and you get that hint of sweetness that Dog Fish Head put out."
"Nice beer. Definitely a sipping winter warmer sort of brew. Pours nearly black, light tan head that dissipated quickly. On the nose it was nice and roasty, caramel, baking spices. The body was somewhat light like a stout, it hid it's 10% alcohol well. I noticed the spruce much more than the maple. The flavor profile reminded me much more of a Sierra beer than a Dogfish. Makes me wonder what sort of beer one might brew from the yeast in the bottom of the bottle"
"I wasn't sure what to expect, but unfortunately this beer did not make these two great breweries better."
"Overall this was an adventure in a goblet as this beer was fairly intense. I certainly see more Dogfish Head in its crafting than Sierra Nevada, but this is a worthy collaboration. I am glad I got a chance to try this and would certainly give it another go, but I will no longer seek this beer out as I did prior to trying it. Worth a try at least once."
"Reviewed from my tasting notes. Served in my 20oz Uprising Chalice at Novare Res. It pours an incredibly dark ruby color with a thick, tan, foam head. It smells slightly sweet, with an earthiness to the aroma. There are hints of spices and maple. There is a definite sweetness up front in the taste, and it has a dry, alcoholic finish, but the sweetness remains throughout. There are spruce and maple flavors. There is also a hint of coffee bitterness. It's a very robust flavor. It has a very full body and low carbonation. As for drinkability, it's a pretty sweet beer--a bit too much for my tastes. Still, I consider this a good beer. I would order it again and would certainly pick up a bottle if I happened across one."
"D: This was an interesting beer. It's good, but I think my taste of it might be enough. I will hold on to my bottle of it and see how it does with some age on it."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and has a mild syrupy thickness. Very filling. There is an alcohol warmth, but not so strong as to burn. This is not an earth shattering collaboration, but one trying if it's available."
"D: I enjoyed this beer, but it didn't ""wow"" me as I was expecting. A second sample a few nights later, after my expectations were adjust downward, still didn't wow me. I think this beer would greatly benefit from some extended aging, but sadly it isn't available enough for me to buy a bottle or three for that purpose. The flavors and aromas appear to be there, but the alcohol and less than stellar mouthfeel overwhelm what should otherwise be a well-crafted beer."
"If this wasn't a collaboration between SN/DFH, my guess is the ratings would be alot lower. Just goes to show what hype and the Sam Caligione marketing machine can do."
"The finish has a bit of piney resin. The alcohol punch is a little too apparent, and there is a slight unpleasant sourness on the deep finish, but overall this is a good beer, certainly better than the description might suggest."
"If I could even come by another bottle I most definitely would indulge again."
"Overall this is a nice winter time brew. It definetly has a bit a of DFH extreme brew qualities. The alcohol is quite well hidden. It shows up a little in the nose and in the taste. Just enough there to let you know its a strong brew. A nice cold weather sipper."
"At times it was like a super brown ale, at others like an odd dubbel. Not too shabby, but it sounds better on the bottle than it tasted in the glass."
"D - drank the whole bottle, mostly because of the $25 price tag. not much good about it."
"Not something I'd drink again, something I'm glad I got to try, the beer is definitely more Dogfish Head than Sierra Nevada in style."
"Overall I really enjoyed this one. Heard a lot about it but even better than expected. Can't wait to try again in a year or so. Very good collaboration between Sierra Nevada and Dogfish Head."
"Very complex beer, this. Tons of rum-soaked dark chocolate and raisin notes pair with a vinous port character. The booziness is present on all parts of the palate, but never becomes overly hot. Earthy hops and maple syrup on the finish with a bit of holiday spices...rough around the edges, but granted this is a young 10% Strong Ale. Chewy, thick mouthfeel, but not sticky. I'm not quite sure how well L&L will end up aging, but I'm going to give it a shot...after all, it has all the markings of a cellarable beer: high ABV, thick body, complex flavor profile that still tastes a bit green. A fun collabo, and I hope DFH and Sierra Nevada do it again."
"A good beer, but nothing earth shattering either. Its pretty much a jacked up Brown Ale with slight flavors of maple and vanilla. I would definetly drink this again. Recommended."
"I had no problem putting back two of them in no time=)"
"As a novelty... it's pretty interesting. This is not something I'd want to drink on a daily basis, however. The heat on the finish is increasingly coming across off-puttingly harsh as I drink it. The beer is exceptionally sweet, almost intolerably so. I wish there was a hoppier finish. This beer is delicious as it sits in your mouth, but around the time you swallow, rather than getting a balancing blast of hops to mellow out the sugary taste of this brew, you instead get an intense blast of even stronger sweetness which is frankly a little overwhelming. Most upsetting to me is the mouthfeel of the beer, which is expectedly thick due to the maple-syrup, but is quite hard to handle, no matter how hard I try to appreciate it for being exactly what I anticipated. Wouldn't it be possible to make a beer with maple syrup that feels like BEER in your mouth? This feels more like syrup. In the end, this is one hell of a sipper at 10.2% and I'm feeling every bit of the alcohol in my brain, and feeling every bit of this thick syrup marinating in my stomach. A cool idea, but definitely a one-timer for me."
"D: Wonderful beer, but god help you if you if go for more than 1 bomber in a session."
"D: the harshness of the booze detracts from the complex malt profile. I am curious to see what this would taste like in a year from now. I was expecting something a little more rich"
"Taste is a bit odd, it has some light bitterness and some woody/maple backbone to it. Tastes like there's some Belgian candi sugars. I'm really not totally sure what I think it's very interesting."
"Notes: Everyone should try this. Why can't a beer like this be available all of the time?"
"Maybe a gimmick, maybe two excellent breweries pushing boundaries and giving us beers that we don't expect. I go with the latter, because even though I don't feel like I would want this again...I truly am glad I experienced it. Now to buy up some more and drink one every year following...this baby should age well."
"Drinkability/Overall: I was skeptical when I bought it. Various friends told me it was decent at best. The Whole Foods hipsters told me ""it needs a couple of years."" Now that I finally took the plunge, I'm glad I did. It's pricey, but I certainly see at least a few more of these in my future."
"d- I will be buying this again. Better get it before it gets sold out."
"Clear, dark burgandy body. Thin light brown head recedes rather quickly to a skimming. Spotty lace is left behind as I drink. Aroma is very nondescript. A little (emphasis on little) caramel, roast, alcohol and fruit. Flavor is more full than aroma. Tropical fruit tones mix with molasses and fig and maple. Sweetness is king, but this beer isn't cloying. It's a nice sipper. Alcohol is nicely integrated and really not that noticeable for a 10+ % beer. Light to light-medium in body. Lightly carbonated. Enjoyable."
"D: A solid collaboration beer, this one is pretty darn good after I've been underwhelmed by a lot of them. Worth a try for sure."
"High ABV, delicious, and a satisfying texture make for an excellent brew."
"I'm glad I was able to try this, but it's not something I'd reach for again. Also, the alcohol is catching up to me fast which hinders the drinkability. I respect both breweries, but it's hard to tell what they were going for with this one."
"On tap at the Church Key in DC. Pours a deep brown. Nose is lightly alcoholic, with definite caramel and fruitiness. Flavor is really well balanced, a nice malt and hops mix. Definite warming alcohol in the flavor. Body is good, fine for the style. Really enjoyed this one - a big, interesting beer along the lines of one of Stone's strong ales or maybe one of DFH's big brone ales (Palo Santo?), but a little maltier. Would definitely get again."
"Mabey just a tad too strong but still nice in a ( let's get hammered) sort of way."
"This is strong, boozey ale. There is nothing delicate about this drink. It is a fantastic winter flavor; perfect to help you get into the holiday spirit! That is, if by holiday spirit you mean hammered, passed out in the snow with just stockings on. The main flavor is hard to identify but is reminiscent of cola."
" D- This beer is big on booze and sweetness with not much more going on. It might really help to have it age but that is an investment I don't want to make. It is a nice soft porter without the booze."
"A big bold and imaginative collaboration beer, nicely done I think, combining the best from both Sierra Nevada and Dogfish Head breweries. If my wife hadn't shared the 24 ounces with me I could easily sit and sip away the whole bottle. Very drinkable despite the strong nicely syrupy flavors. I can easily see saving a bottle or two of this, as it seems like a beer that might age very nicely. Highly recomended!"
"Not a bad beer, but I was expecting more out of a Dogfish Head and Sierra Nevada collaboration - doesn't live up to the hype for me. I've got another bottle that I will age for 1-2 years and see if it improves any, but I'm doubtful it will get up to A range with some age on it."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with good head retention and lacing. The nose on this beer is impressive, with milk duds, brown sugar, more milk chocolate and celery salt. Interestingly, ths beer has something of a salty, underlying flavor to it. Flavors generally replicate the palate, except there's some nice light bitterness and licorice on the finish, which helps to counter the sweetness a bit. This beer is very rich tasting and has a very full and soft mouthfeel. Finish is pretty long, and alcohol is fairly well disguised for the abv. The sweetness hurts the beers drinkability just a bit, but this is still a very nice, very solid beer."
"I found this a tough beer to drink, especially with the strong boozy character. Even without that the notes are strikingly challenging. It's certainly got flavour, and if you sip it and share the bottle, you can get through it, but it didn't impress me terribly."
"Pours a dark brown with smallish tan head that recedes relatively quickly. Smells good, although a little hot--notes of molasses and syrup, nuttiness, and a bit of roastiness comes through too. Starts too hot when it's cold, I definitely recommend letting this one warm up and open up. Smell evolves nicely into some dark nutty and earthy tones, and the alcohol recedes in the taste and is replaced by a nice sweetness from the syrup. Some leafy hops in there too balance some of the sweetness with some bitter kick. Woody notes in there too. Definitely a unique beer. Very creamy and full bodied, perfect carbonation to keep it moving. A great sipper, and one worth trying (although maybe not worth the hype). Would love to see what some age would do to this, although I was too excited and wanted to try it fresh."
"D - An interesting brew, not the best of the style, but a very drinkable strong brown ale. A success to my taste buds - I could probably drink snifter after snifter of this since it is very drinkable for the strength - a satisfying beer"
"Overall, I think this is a great beer. The DFH/SN collaboration is very well done, from the artwork on the bottle to the flavor of the beer. This beer deserves two thumbs up and I hope to see future collaborations between these two breweries."
"A sizeable American Strong. If it were cheaper, I would stock up. Even as it is, I am still considering..."
" The drinkabality is a one or two 22oz minimum to respect the beer and enjoy it's taste."
"Overall: Smell decieving. It's pretty good, but not as good as smell and sight would lead you to believe."
"Pours a dark cola color with a HUGE stiff tan head that's got good retention and leaves spotty patterns of Belgian lacing behind. The smell is quite sweet and malty maple honey caramel vanilla woody complexity. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is a full bodied creamy smooth. The mouth compliments the flavors nicely; the sweet malt maple caramel taste lingers nicely. The alcohol and a light anise characteristic lends more to consider while warming slightly. A really fine drinker, the 10.2 ABV is well integrated. Split this one with my son...went down way too easily. Well worth the pursuit."
"Overall, a little too safe and boring for these two amazing breweries. I would have like to see a bit more innovation and unique tastes."
"I picked up a bottle at Ledger's in Berkeley and plan on having it in front of a toasty fire."
"I'm excited to see how this ages over 12-14 months."
"Lucky enough to get one courtesy of ""beerbobwfm"" here at my local Whole Foods. Poured into snifter, dark as can be with a mahogany edge. Massive creamy head with good retention and amazing lacing. Very nice looking. Smell is the ""worst"" part of this beer for me. Strong alcohol presence, some molasses and caramel and some dark fruit. Taste is terrific I think. A very complex body with some dark fruit, syrup, oak, caramel and some vanilla as well. I've read some other reviews and haven't had vanilla come up but I swear there is a little vanilla in here. Mouthfeel is absolutely perfect I think. A very full, creamy, velvety quality to it. Very smooth and silky going down with a chewy aftertaste. Overall this is an amazing beer I think. I was hesitant to drop the 11 bucks on it but it was worth every penny. Best beer I've had all year probably."
"$11.99 for the 24 ounce bomber @ DeCiccio's in Ardsley, NY. Nice label artwork, but sadly no freshness/vintage info, even on a brew that's label speaks about ""encouraging aging"" oh well, another opportunity lost. This beauty pours darkest of browns, under a stocky dark khaki/mocha head, that stays and stays. Leaving gobs of sheeting and modern art lacing. The sniff reveals bountiful aromas of raisins, maple and dark malts. Full flavor sipper, notes of more raisins, ample maple (w/o being too sweet somehow) and again more lucious dark malts. Yummy creation, 10% well hidden...can you say Christmas dinner dessert beer/night capper. I hope to be able to get at least a few more bottles of this one ASAP"
"Again, pretty sweet and malt-driven flavor. More molasses than I anticipated, along with dark fruit and some woodiness. Coats the mouth heavily; there's not much in the way of carbonation to whisk off the sugars. There's an earthy, herbal edge to the hops, and quite a bit going on, but I wasn't hugely enamored. Too sweet for my tongue, but the alcohol was nicely tucked away."
"D: This is a good beer, but honestly I was expecting a bit more because of the hype and the 20.00 I paid for the bottle. All in all it was a good experience trying a beer created by two of the best minds in brewing. I am going to age my other bottle for a bit and see what happens!"
"Strong malty taste, also maple, finished with an alcoholic whiff. Mouth fill was satisfying with a right amount of carbonation. I found this more boozy compared to some higher octane brews. Nothing wrong with that as sometimes a little booze can have some good effects on you."
"Overall good but in the end I think this one got a lot of press but just a decent brew, certainly not epic."
"This is a very unique beer I hope that dogfish and sierra do more together they can learn quite a bit from one another. This beer typifies Sierras perfect bottle conditioning and well balanced beer as well as Dogfish's off axis experimental approach to beer making. Well done! cheers!"
"Overall, an excellent, unique beer. If you can track it down, it's definitely worth it!"
"Pizza Peel Charlotte NC. Very dark brown pour with mohoghanny accents, an adequate amount of cream colored head. Malt, caramel, oak, leather, peat, light cocoa and some hop aroma. Taste is a smooth blend of toasted malt, caramel, vanilla, cocoa, oak barrel and earthy tones of peat and especially tea. Barrel and tea flavors stay a little longer than the rest. Solid medium mouthfeel. Very little alcohol presence at all. This was just a bit different. Hop profile from the SN is noticeable. The tea stands out from some DFH brews. Extreamly pleasant and I'm betting better on draft."
"The body on this is a bit thin. Lacks depth in carbonation and bite. Disappointing. This beer starts out quite hot. Nice alcohol burn at the onset. Deep chocolate bready finish. Bitterness is moderate with a minor hops presence. Alcohol and sweet molasses malts take the show here. Wow. This is interesting. This isn't your 'everyday' strong ale, but it is a good one nonetheless. Give it a shot."
"This is the sort of beer I really enjoy sipping on for an hour or so. I'm so glad I got a hold of three bottles!"
"Overall this beer was a bit disappointing. I feel as though there was a little too much going on here and the flavors became a bit too muddled - somewhere between and Old Ale and American Strong. Not worth seeking out but worth a shot to see for yourself."
"Edit: I don't have any idea how this brew is going to age.. I honestly expect is will be too sweet with a year or so, but I'm just guessing."
"Well the hell done Sierra and dogfish. I will be grabbing a few bottles I have been passing up on now!"
"Had this on tap at Stub n Herb's. Dark brown, no head or lacing after a few seconds. Smells like like chocolate, maple, and booze... lots of booze. Body is thin and dry. What sweetness that comes out in this beer is all from the maple syrup and almost none from the malts. Light chocolate, earthiness, wood, and warming alcohol, dry finish. Very dry finish. This beer just had a little too much dry alcohol flavors and too little sweetness that could have been provided by a little more body. Not impressed."
"Not very drinkable, one goblet was all I could handle. It is worth trying but I will not seek it out again."
"D-Glad I was able to taste this one great beer. I really could taste the SN profile and the DFH profile they both really pop great brew! For me though this is a night cap beer or after dinner brew it worked well after turkey dinner. This is a great beer to sit and sip with a good buddy. Drinks nice!"
"Over all it was a good beer with more and more flavor coming out as it warmed. I definately think this is a beer that should get better with age and enjoyed later more than earlier."
"Mouthfeel is great, medium bodied despite the high alcohol and it hits all the centers on the palate completely. There is not a strong forward flavor. Overall an interesting beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low to medium carbonation, some warmth going down. Not too bad at all, ABV is well hidden, and the maple character is quite nice."
"Drinkability= Can I have a designated driver take me home after I quaff mad amounts of this delicious elixir??"
"Drinkability - Hard to drink more than one. Taste like it will age very well good thing i got two. Taste like it is described as."
"The beer is dark brown with rusty colored edges, clear with very few tan bubbles on top. The aroma is very nice, the maple syrup comes through big time, also some sweet dark malt notes like toffee and roasted malts. This is a delicious smelling beer, and the actual flavor follows through just like it should. Kind of dopplebockish, this is a sweet malt-bomb with a noticeable ethanol flavor in the after-taste. The maple notes are there too, again this is reminiscent of some good dopplebocks I've had, maybe Samuel Adams Double Bock + Celebrator + maple syrup. Don't know what birch syrup tastes like but it must be there too... The body is thicker than average, a good match for the strong flavors. A good wintertime sipper that I'd be happy to have again."
"Poured into a pint glass. It has a deep dark brown color that barely lets any light through. When held up to the light a slight red color is noted as well. There was about a finger and a half of tan head. It has a strong malty aroma with notes of maple and spices. There is a strong roasted malt presence in the tasted. The maple is noted slightly along with the hop presence. The alcohol is noted slightly on the finish, but is hidden pretty well. Overall this is a very drinkable good beer. It seems like a thin imperial stout. It isn't a let down in the slightest, but at the same time it didn't wow me. Glad I picked it up but the $10 price tag is a little steep. I will probably pick up another one and let it age for a while."
"D: Amazing Beer, very filling and ston +10%, One and I am good"
"-i feel/hope this will age pretty well. i like it okay now, but it should be better later"
"Overall, I think this is a bad beer coasting by on the hype of being associated with two popular (but usually mediocre) breweries."
"D: This was a great beer to try. The alcohol in the nose and taste are a bit overwhelming and make this hard to be sessionable. Pretty complex tastes that are overshadowed by the booziness."
"Overall, I'm kinda disappointed with it. It's a great beer, but I was somehow expecting more. For $10.99 I don't see myself buying this again. And for the record, I highly doubt this will age well, I just don't see this improving much with age."
"Tap @ SF L&L Release dinner and @ City Beer Store. A rather disappointing mess of a strong ale. Life & Limb certainly isn't awful, but it doesn't live up to the hype surrounding this collaboration of two high profile craft brewers. It pours a dark brown, opaque, with little head. Light aroma of birch, citric hops and nutty malt, which sounds pretty good but it's already obvious that the beer is too sweet for my taste. The flavor is sweet with syrup and malt with a bit of a hop bite. Unfortunately, nothing seems to mesh. The flavors aren't terribly pleasant on their own and don't really work together well. Feel is thick. Had to try it twice to confirm."
"Overall, I thought this was a very good combined effort from two excellent (if strikingly different) breweries. I liked the concept of this beer and the result was pretty good other than the lack of smell. Looking forward to revisiting with the bottles I tucked away and am guessing the score should go up."
"Drinkability: This beer leaves me with mixed feelings, but in a good intellectual way, not a ""did I enjoy this?"" sort of way. I did enjoy this beer - it's a solid beer, complex in places, aesthetically pleasing in others, and well-made all around. There was enough about it that left me wanting in certain places, though other aspects blew me away. In essence, it's a mixed bag at the high-end of the spectrum, a beer that I examine under the most high-powered of microscopes, likely because of the caliber of the collaborators here. So, yeah, it's a good beer, worth the (rather steep) price tag to try, though part of me is also glad it's a once-off, as I don't know if I'd see myself going back for this one."
"D- Very quaffable. While the booze is present to a limited degree on the palate, there is nothing from a sensory perspective that indicates this is a 10% ABV beer. Dangerously drinkable."
"overall a good beer, yet not quite the marvel it was billed out to be. the ""life"" of blended yeast strains could be more pronounced in a richer aroma and perhaps a stronger oak aftertaste may help its ""limbness"""
"D: No. This is so harsh and solventy. It might age well -- the flavor underneath the booze was pretty solid -- but I have no desire to find out. I don't have any patience or respect for a booze-bomb."
"Perfect for a cool overcast night, not cold enough for an IRS, but perfect for enjoying the scent of falling leaves that is the signature of the autumn."
"This beer is a very good but different beer. Not your typical strong ale. Pours very good and has a good belguin lining and keeps a pretty good head. I didnt know what to think when i heard about this collabaration. I think the beer leans more toward something you would get from dogfish head. As the beer warms up you start to get more of a better taste of what this beer is all about. You taste a lot of caramel and syrup and even a little vanilla probably would go good with ice cream. It is very easy to drink this beer. I am gonna hold on to a couple bottles and open them up in a year or so. Cant wait to see more companies do collabarations. Whats next stone and russian river?"
"On-tap at the Bookstore Speakeasy in Bethlehem. While the beer was quite drinkable, but a little lifeless. There was a pale syrup flavor with a little sweet cocoa, but this beer didn't taste like much. As it warmed up, I hoped to et more flavor, but the alcohol just became more evident. It was easy to drink and pleasant, but I wouldn't bother with this one again."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with strong carbonation. Very nice, but not entirely befitting of the style."
"D: I sat on this one for about 45 minutes, and it did improve slightly as it warmed, but I could not get over how boozy it was. Maybe in a few months or a year it will be great, but it definitely needs more time."
"Drinkability: the 10.2% abv is deceiving as it drinks a lot easier than you think it would. the alcohol is more of an aftertaste/warming than a big part of the main flavor. interesting beer."
"D= Good beer. A little age on this and it would mellow out a little more I think taking some of the hotness away. Great syrup taste to it and an awesome woodyness that I suspect comes from the birch. Great collab guys! It's awesome to see brewerys do things like this."
"D. Pretty drinkable for being over 10% abv. Another of the dangerous high alcohol beers that are actually quite sessionable."
"D: This is a 10% beer but I would not have guessed it. I thought the alcohol was very nicely incorporated. I did not really think it was ""hot"" by any means yet it did have a nice warming quality. This is certainly a sipper just based off of the complexity of taste and how it changes as it warms however if you wanted to drink a couple of these in a night, it could be done. Glad I tasted it and would get it again if I had the opportunity."
"Bottle courtesy tripelthreat (I think). Pours dark brown with ruby-mahogany highlights and a fading frothy wet beige head. Aroma is big brown sugar and some alcohol with lesser accents of red and dark fruits. Flavor is boozy maple syrup, cocoa powder, and dark bread crusts. For a beer with a prominent sugar/syrup note, this finishes pretty dry and clean. DFH could certainly learn something from this collaboration. Something called 'attenuation.' Mouthfeel is slick and oily, carbonation is on the low side. Pretty drinkable although the alcohol is a little bit too prominent."
"I may have to go buy a couple more of these to see what long term aging does to it."
"Drinkability is really good. Man, what an interesting big malty brew! Lots of complex and interesting flavors that aren't overwhelming. The beer goes down quite easy for being 10+% ABV. My only nit pick? I'd like a little more body. But still, this is an excellent beer and it should age nicely. Well... I expected nothing less than excellence from Sierra and Dogfish. And needless to say, they didn't disappoint even with the steeper price tag. I'll grab 1 or 2 more for the cellar."
"D: Extremely deceptive, could have a few more of these if I knew nothing of the ABV. Enjoyable and positively unique"

"Obviously much anticipated,I am glad to grab a few bottles before they are gobbled up here in my area.Poured into an oversized wine glass a deep dark brown with some deep reddish colored hue when held to the light,a large clingy off white head atop.A mix of a whole lot of good stuff going on in the nose,winter spice,molasses,roast,and resiny hop comes through.Flavors are quite sweet at the onset with mollases and spice,some leather and dark fruit also show up,then a deep resiny hop flavor comes and really finishes this beer out as good as you can.Big chewey and mouth coating,you cant ask for a much better mouthfeel.Man I really like this beer,many times a anticipated beer doesnt live up to the hype,this does."
"Spilled some on my hand when I was pouring the beer. It was really sticky and I thought, oh great, this is going to be sickly sweet. Smelled wonderfull; fruity yeast, slightly roasted malt, some maple. Again, Im thinking this stuff is going to be thick and cloying. I was wrong, boy is this a well balanced beer. Biscuit and faint roast from the malt, clean bitterness from the hops and some maple, but not much. Slight alcohol heat, which I dont care for, but its not enough to ruin the experience. There is some sweetness, but the hops do a nice job of countering it. The body is a lot lighter than I expected, it is slightly oily but overall Id say its medium. It has a fair level of carbonation, which aides in elevating this beer out of the heavy catagory. Overall, this was a great beer. Id imagine that in a few years it will be nothing short of amazing."
"One the most ""complete"" beers I have ever had! Keep it up Saucer, Dogfish and Sierra Nevada, I love this beer, keep 'em coming!"
"Outstanding beer!"
"Dark brown with glowing ruby highlights. Firm sheet of lace lasts throughout. Sweet malt, dark fruits and a hint oak aromas. Dates, maple syrup, and subtle wood flavors lay down a nice foundation. Very complex. Nice subtle chocolate and light roast coffee flavors on the finish. A light spicy note is there as well, maybe from the hefty 10+% alcohol. The abv is extremely well integrated even so.The body is full on with a light and lush carbonation. Comfortably numbing stuff. This one gives you plenty to ponder while your sipping away. Excellent."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a tulip glass a dark ruby with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is slight maple and dark malts. Taste is an absolutely wonderful blend of maple, sweet malts and wood, very complex and very tasty. The beer is medium body with fairly well hidden alcohol. This one is truly special, definitely worth the hype."
"It is Dark and choclate colored it has a really good head and belguin lining. Also a nice aroma of vanilla syrup and caramel. A lot of different flavors especially once the beer warms up. Very easy to drink and you cant even notice the beer is 10.2%. Sam and Ken did a great job together on this look forward to what they will com up with in the future!!"
"D: You would have no idea this is 10.2%...scary! Yet extremely delicious, smooth and almost sessionable. Couldn't ask for more from these guys and hope they team up more in the future."
"Amazing drinkability for its high ABV. The creaminess and solid body on this brew demanded another and made for a seriously sessionable beer."
"O- I like this beer, it reminds me of the syrup my grandmother would pour from a tin can on to our waffles. Its different and the maple and birch come through to dominate the flavor profile. This would be a great breakfast beer. Very good collaboration guys."
"I really enjoyed this beer. It reminded me in a lot of ways of DFH Palo Santo Marron without all of the wood flavor. A great collaborative beer and one that I look forward to revisiting with some age on it."
