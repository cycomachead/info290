"Flavor is bright and hoppy, some citrus and pine mainly.  Bitterness and pale malts and really no hint of alcohol flavor.  Deceptive.  Good stuff."
"Oh boy, we've got a big one here. Bright tawny hue, topped with a tiny bubbled lacing. Floral alcohol, biscuity malt, & mild fruitiness in the nose. Creamy, smooth, almost cordial-like. Boozy but not hot, biscuity malt from start to finish. This is a massive brew, easy to sip but the alcohol gives a kick to the palate letting me know I should be taking my time. Beer geek delight with this one."

"O:)  Heavy and loaded...  this may be the perfect brandy drinker's beer."

"It's good, but I think the Double Bag is much more flavorful and interesting."
"Hazy russet brown tinge. Light creme colored head. A bit o lacing. Malty sweet nose. Mild hop taste and carbonation profile on the front of the tongue. Malty sweet tones of caramelized fruit on the middle of the tongue. Slightly boozy afterbreath over the rear of the pallet. Overall well disguised 11%ABV."
"O: really well done; the high ABV is noticeable, bit it matches the flavor and aroma nicely;"
""
"Overall- Intense and bold in flavor. Toasty sweet malts blend favorably with fruity sweet finish. Brighter fruits taste as if they have been soaked in alcohol, potent alcohol presence, but not off-putting. A sweet beer, but not out of balance."

"O- I have waited patiently for this 'Imperial German Altbier' to (finally) make return after its first release in bottles back in 2011...and it was well worth the wait. Although similar in format to Otter Creek's 20th Anniversary Ale (another 'Imperial German Altbier' brewed back in 2011), Triple Bag is superior with regards to its pleasant body, non-cloying flavor profile and lack of alcohol presence in the nose, taste and feel. I really hope Long Trail keeps up the momentum with their bigger beers with Triple Bag staying in more regular rotation. (4.75)"
"Paid $3.99 at Cheese Traders for a single 12 oz bottle that was about 13 months old (11% ABV - 65 IBUs).  Poured into a large tulip.  Beer is a clear, slightly dark, reddish copper color with a finger of off-white head that lingers and leaves beautiful tracing.  Aroma is of caramel, molasses, slight citrus and some dried fruit or candy.  Taste is slightly boozy but has nice notes of malt, caramel, molasses and is balanced nicely with a bitter finish and lingering booze.  Mouth feel is nice...full bodied, slightly slick, with ample carbonation.  Overall, I liked this beer.  I haven't had Double Bag so can't compare them, but this was an enjoyable beer for a winter evening."

"I did like this beer, at 11% ABV you could taste the alcohol.. I would not drink this everyday. But if you can find some pick it up (a single) and it's well worth chocking it up to the lift of beers tried :) IMO it's boozy. But at 11% it to be expected."

"Taste / Palate: It’s flavor is full bodied and loaded with notes of caramel and sweet raisin bread. There is a pleasant boozy warmth though out and its finnish brings only a just very slight earthy hops flavor. The feel is full, well rounded and a bit slick but not in a cloying way. Notes: Just as a side notes this beer was aged over a year in my beer cellar."

"O/D-Nigger is not better. Double Bag was one of my first intros to craft. I still enjoy it somewhat. This one doesn't have the same magic as it's little brother."

"Overall: Eh, this was just okay to me and certainly not something I'll rush out to try again. I haven't had too many altbiers, but I certainly prefer the Double Bag to the Triple Bag."
""
""
""
""
""
"Perhaps it would be a good ""food"" beer. Maybe some sweet sausages or braunschweiger would balance out the edges of this ale."
""

"Yuck. Frankly, quite hard to drink. And high ABV kicks you around for your trouble. Not my thing."

"Overall a touch boozier and sweeter than Double Bag, but I think I like Triple Bag better"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Too sweet and boozy to want another. In fact, I'm not even eager to finish my first. I generally prefer Double Bag."
""
""
"O - After trying the Double and Triple Bag, I can say I'm not fond of the style..."
"A nicely balanced Sticke Alt. The 9.2% abv is barely perceived."
""
""
""
"Overall - A little too malty and the alcohol is definitely present. I prefer their Double Bag to this brew."
""

"The beer pours a dark candied brown, with nice hints of amber in it. The beer’s body is clean but cloudy with a haze, and the beer’s head is very lightly tan in color. The beer’s lacing is thin and slick, leaving slippery lines of foam on my glass. On the nose, this beer is big and pungent from the moment the cap is popped. Beautiful rich malts leap from the bottle, the glass, and whatever other container you might have this beer in. When you stick your nose in the glass you get sweet notes of brown sugar, raisin, prune, slight maple syrup notes, and a surprising amount of creamy and also unripe banana. On the tongue, this beer is creamy sweet, bringing raisins, banana, brown sugar, caramel, and slight toasted malts on to the tongue. The beer begins with sweet brown sugar and a touch of maple syrup before opening into raisins, then prunes, then a touch of dates and lovely toasted caramel malts before the beer hits the finish of banana, raisins, and brown sugar. The aftertaste is beautifully long lasting, giving hints of both ripe and unripe banana and brown sugar. On the mouth, the beer feels slightly below heavy but chewy in body and creamy smooth on the tongue. The mouth is left dry on the sides but swimming in saliva on the middles of the tongue. Overall this beer is fantastic, sweet, and complex. I love how this beer is specially made from the first runnings of the mash as that adds a certain amount of fanciness to it. I also love how it smells and how it feels on the tongue, and especially how it tastes. This is a beautiful sipping beer that is ripe with flavors and doesn’t quite touch on the common flavor profiles of other big beers. This beer is a winner. Try it."

"O: Overall the booziness takes over at times and becomes distracting. Im not one to shy away from big boozy beers, only when they inhibit most of the flavor aspects and complexity. Drinkability is limited average excitiment, meh. To be fair im a huge fan of their double bag which i believe rated b+ and really enjoyed and think it is a much better tuned beer in terms of balance and malt profile. bigger isnt always bigger in this case."

"At 53 IBUs, this is no hop bomb; there is a hearty suppliment of honey and malt to bring out a smooth chewiness; all of this, to make for a unique quaff at the end of a tiresome day. One of these should do it."

"I think Double Bag is one of Long Trail's better offerings, so I guess I am predisposed to enjoy this. I think it probably mellowed a bit in the few months I accidentally let this age. I will be drinking this again."

"Pours a four finger khaki head that fades slowly to thin layer leaving some lace. Hazy amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Malty caramel nose, flavor is similar, malty caramel with hops balancing. Expecting more flavor, more body than the Double Bag. $11.95 for a 4-pak of 12oz bottles from Bert’s Better Beers Hooksett, NH."
"overall, a great beer. One of the best of this style i've had."
""
"It's really a very simple, big, slow sipping barleywine/double double bock (quadruple bock?). I like it a lot. Not the session beer that double bag is, but a really nice almost english style barleywine. I'll have another please."
"Overall: this is a hearty and malt-focused beer. This is a meal and the flavor is well balanced. Enjoyable but slow sipping."
""
""
""
""
"O - Nice beer, one I go to frequently when I want a nice malty beer without too much bitterness (not that often...but it happens)."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I would say this is a very good beer. I like Long Trail as a brewery and find most of their beers consistently good. I would purchase this again."
"O - i had heard good things of double bag so i didn't think twice when i saw triple bag for growler fills. i'm a bit disappointed honestly. the abv% is quite honestly the only reason i could understand drinking this one. there's not much there in flavors, smell, or even the pour. maybe this is better with aging. i would probably pick up a bottle to store for year or so, but never again in growler/tap."
""
"As I pour Triple bag into my mug, it appears oily, deep, and dark. Burnt sienna. An initial 1/2 inch head of carbonation is present, but quickly disappears almost completely. The nose is very sweet and extremely malty, with plum and spice notes. Surprisingly, the body of the beer is fairly light. Flavor-wise I am picking up baker's chocolate, caramel, and a tiny bit of resiny hops, along with some other sort of earthiness for a very dry finish. Towards the finish there is an intense warming sensation! Can't have too many of these in one night..."
""
"Overall this is one of the better beers I have had from long trail, really a one and done kind of thing and no way is available to me locally. Still as good as expected if not better."
"Overall- Nice, well rounded beer with some uniqueness, but still keeping true to the strong ale roots"

"Pours a dark brown with a thin, patchy cocoa head. Minimal lacing on the side of my snifter glass. The smell seems a little watered down for the style. Cinnamon, nutmeg, spice, alcohol, and malt. Very sweet smelling, and not enough meat in the smell. Taste is the same. Just not a lot happening compared to the best in style. The taste is very nutty, and almost tastes like a spiked iced tea. Hmmm.. Feel is medium, with below average carbonation and a alcohol heat aftertaste. The whole beer just seems a little 'off'. Overall, this is a fairly mediocre example of the style... I'll probably not look for this again. Cheers."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a clear dark brown with hints of red, with a 2 inch fluffy white head, that hangs around awhile, and laces the hell out of the glass. Smell is dark fruit, brown sugar, bread, and carmel. Taste is that more enjoyable then smell, with a hint of booze and hard candy in the finish. Body isn't that big considering the hefty abv, that helps with its drinkability, good amount of life, and isn't dry. This is nice and a different beer, malt lovers should love this, but has enough hop presence to satisfy a hop head."
""
""
""
"Overall--I'm definitely getting a kind of ""American Scotch Ale"" vibe here. Alcohol comes through more in the nose than in taste. This is a wonderful beer for a chilly late fall night. Great for nursing and mulling over the day by the fire. Unique and highly recommended."
""
"O: The beer has a good aroma and taste but it feels a bit syrupy, which diminishes its drinkability and makes it more of a beer that needs to be sipped."
""
"I was super surprised with this one. It doesnt have th ebest reviews here on BA, but it was delicious. Slightly over malty, but otherwise nice strong fruity overtones, with just the right amount of alcohol. It tastes more like a Tripel to me....as the name may suggest. Overall, well worth trying and hopefully you will be as surprised as me."
""
""
"Really liked this one. Heavy on the malt as you would expect from a strong ale. Very reminiscent of the Double Bastard. Lots of alcohol in the nose and palate, definitely a sipping beer as the ABV would suggest. Lots of malt but lacks the lingering taste, i guess this is where the hops should come in, but none present. Still a great beer and worth a try if you enjoy the double bag, thank you Long Trail!"

"What a monster of an ale -- really rich but creamy smooth. Great night cap for those of us who like malt bombs. Also, this follows nicely after a glass of Double Bag -- a real hard task to follow."
"12oz bottle with a Bottled On Date of I think 092811. Pours a muddy mahogany color with no head. Some lacing. Aroma is pretty boozey and malty. Some dark fruits. Smells somewhat like the higher abv DFH beers (Olde School, WWS etc). Taste is earthy, malty and boozey. Again I got to say this tastes alot like the cousin of the higher octane DFH beers. Dark fruits and some sweetness as well as some spices. More bitter towards the end. The 9.2% abv is very present. This is a very interesting beer and a great cold weather sipper. Overall, I want to have this again."
""
"Poured a nice deep amber, just a bit to opaque to see anything through the beer. Slightly rich and sweet aroma. Things change in the taste. All I get is malt, and almost sickeningly sweet malt at that, which finishes with a slightly bitter-sweet note. The whole beer lasts a lot longer on the tongue than you'd expect."
""

""

""

""

"O-One of Long Trail's best offerings, glad I picked up a bottle. Once again it is very malty."
""
"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle a coppery brown with a creamy one finger head that quickly dissolves into a medium lacing. Carbonation is light. Aroma is heavy with sweetness ( apples, peaches, strawberries, honey). 1st sip brings all that sweet aroma to the tongue in a very pleasant, non-cloying way. Mouthfeel is silky and creamy, and there is a hint of alcohol on the swallow, but it's very subtle. This goes down a little too smoothly for a 9.25% abv ale! Overall, this is a very good strong ale...one i'd love to see go from limited release to Long Trail's regular lineup!"
""
""
"Wish I could describe how wonderful this feels and tastes. Do NOT drink below 45 degrees. Very Dark, Very Rich, heavy, full, almost like a mouthful of warm brown bread. Picked up two four packs from the brewery last month. Would have bought more but for the $$$. Worth every penny, just wish I had more pennies."
"Wow was this a fun beer. Congrats to Long Trail on this one. I'm usually not a fan of malt bombs, but this one did me right. Rich, caramel, toffee, molasses, burnt sugar, all tickling my mouth. The heat is there, but does not interfere, like some malt forward beers of this ABV do. A real pleasure."
""
""
""
"From a bottle stamped 3094092211. Sampled on November 17, 2011. It has a nice looking, average dark amber pour with a head that dissolves in short order. On the nose there is a solid malt character as well as something like apple or pear. The body falls into the medium range. Malts are definitely a key element to the taste but not quite as malty as a Barleywine. It has a sour, hopped ending that is also a tad dry. This is a nice deviation for Long Trail."
""
""
""
"O - If you're at the less popular end of the beer-spectrum (opposite the hop-heads) and looking for a malt-bomb, this beer will be a rare treat. This is probably the maltly equivalent of the hop-bomb, Hop Stoopid, by Lagunitas. This beer has tons of flavor and alcohol that will satisfy all wants/needs of someone looking for a sweeter one-and-done beer."
"O- Glad I got to try this as it's never been on tap each time we've made the trek up there, but I don't think I'd ever search it out again. Not saying it's a bad beer, it's still very good, but unless it's where ever I am, most likely won't look for it."
"Overall, I love this beer. It’s a Belgian strong dark minus yeast funk, plus an abundant hop bittering. Perfect for an evening after a cold and lousy opening day of rifle season."
"A fine slow sipper. I'm looking forward to quadrupel and quintuple bag."
"Was surprised to even see this at my local store so bought a 4 pack of it for about $10. Love the double bag so was excited to see the triple bag. It definitely does not disappoint. Nice caramel and sweet aroma, very unique style beer with really no category. A bit strong, but that's to be expected. Great mouthfeel and is super balanced and finishes nice and smooth. A delight to drink, great beer."
"Overall: I like drinking this as a winter warmer. In my opinion it is more fitting than their Hibernation ale yet both are good ,but this is better. good job again Long Trail!!!!"
"Overall not bad, a bit too heavy for its own good, but decent with nice malts and sweeteners, the hops are interesting but a bit much, and sticky syrupy malt flavors a bit too much. Then again as its supposed to be much bigger than double bag I think they pretty much achieved that."
"A big robust beer."
"Cheers!"
"Thanks, Bendurgin, for the opportunity"
"Overall, it's nice, but I think I prefer the Double Bag"
"O: This will be on heavy rotation as long as I can find it. Great beer at a great price. You can never go wrong with Double Bag or Triple bag"
"O: an extremely complex and unique brew but every sip is kind of all over the place, decent but thick and heavy"
"D: This is a really nice strong ale.  Not overly complex and not overly sweet, with a nice balance between the sweetness and subtle spiciness and earthiness.  Goes down very easy despite the booze content.  A nice extra that I'm glad I got to try.  "
"An interesting beer, a souped-up Double Bag with a deceiving 9.4% ABV. A nice sipper beer for the upcoming cooler Fall and Winter months."
"O- Enjoyable- I will be working this in to the rotation. I love a good strong ale. Perfect for the winter months."
"One of my favorite offerings from LT -- I still gotta hate on the packaging, though. Saving two bottles for some cellar time. A nice, drinkable strong ale."
"Around the 10-month mark, it has as much bite as it did fresh. Less sure that I want to hang onto the rest, if they're taking up cellar space. Still smells amazing, still great tasting, just a bit more hops than I like; kinda American Barleywine."
"VERY GOOD, SEEK IT OUT!"
"o - this beer is delicious. it's quite mellow for the 9.4% abv. yes, there is a kick, but it doesn't turn you away. i got this bottle as a small gift from a good friend, but i have seen it for about 2 or 3 dollars at a local beer store. i would definitely buy this again, and i will. sometimes it's nice to have a great brew that you don't really have to analyze that much."
"Overall- As of this date, I would say try the Long Trail Harvest seasonal beer, it's phenomenal. This is somewhat forgettable. I am enjoying it, but its just a strong, dark, nut brown....stout..? Peculiar beer, leaves me wanting more to pinpoint it. It's rather expensive because I think its a limited release beer, but if you have the extra cash, check it out. Cheers."
"a slow sipper, but not as complex as a slow sipper should be. the aroma is quite good, but it ends up being boozy and malty, and thats about it."
"Pours a clear deep brown color with a smallish tan head that recedes quickly. Smells of caramel and cherries mostly, with hints of prunes and alcohol thrown in for good measure. Sweet, fruity, syrupy flavor. Lots of caramel and dark fruits with a bit of alcohol burn. Sweet sticky mouthfeel, low to moderate level of carbonation, with a medium to thick body. Decent brew that I enjoyed sipping for a couple of hours but a touch to high with the alcohol burn."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. It has all the great flavors of the original Double Bag but it's taken to a new level with the darker fruity flavors that are absent from the original. I imagine they are adding a darker Lovibond caramel malt here that adds that nice dark caramel and dark fruit flavors which really add to the complexity and overall flavor profile in this beer. Almost smells and tastes like a Belgian Dubbel because of the dominant plum and fig aromas and flavors present here. A great job by a great brewery that is always under-rated despite delivering amazing quality for amazing value."
"An extreme altbier? It tastes more like a barleywine to me. Regardless, worth a try!"
"12oz. bottle served in my Maudite tulip. Pours a deep brown, not quite the color of cola, with a one inch, loose, cream-colored head that quickly dissipates into a rolling, sudsy froth that coalesces around the edges. A half moon swath of delicate lacing encircles the bowl. Nose expresses dark malts and dark fruits; aromas are somewhat akin to an Americanized Belgian Strong Dark. Taste follows nose; however, there's also an interesting bubblegum quality (maybe grape), as well as a faint yeast presence. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an even carbonation that falls short of lively. I've been looking forward to trying this for a while and I have to say that I'm pretty pleased with this beer. Definitely the best brew I've had from Long Trail and I hope to see this added to their line as a seasonal rotation. I definitely plan on picking up some more to lay down for a couple years."
"It's a good beer that I will continue to enjoy. :)"
"I'm very curious to see how this will age, and wonder if anyone at LT has tried with previous years kegs."
"Overall this beer is truly a great beer that I think Long Trail should add to their list of great ales they sell in stores."
"Thick mouthfeel but smooth and creamy in texture. Overall, I'm digging this strong ale from Long Trail. Lots of malty and boozy goodness with just enough hops to keep things in line."
"Don't let the score I gave fool you, it was good, but I just can't see myself having more than one at a time"
"Give this one a try I was glad I did and looking forward to the other 3 that came in the 4 pack :)"
"The body is full and the carbonation is a bit soft. Overall not bad here. Not really sure what to ultimately make of this but it's pretty tasty."
"M&D - lively on the tongue, but not effervescent, mellow and complex and layered, looked forward to this one for sometime and it didnt disappoint"
"Taste is sharp, boozy and lots of dark fruit and sweet creamy flavors. Mouthfeel is full and thick. It's pretty decent."
"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, sticky and lingering on the tongue. Drinks decently, although this was a bit warm and sweet for my personal tastes."
"Being an appreciator of double bag over the years, I'm glad to be able to give this one a try, after missing its limited appearance last year."
"Drinkability: Alright, not great. Booze is ever-present, and those malts and sugars are overwhelming. I'm not a big fan of this one and Long Trail in general, but it is worth at least trying it once."
"I will be sipping this fine aged ale that is for sure!"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, it's not much stronger than Double Bag but it's a lot sweeter. Overall, it's a good beer to drink for while."
"D: Was quite easy to put down. It is 1% higher in ABV than its sibling, Double Bag (which I prefer to this), but it is actually easier to put down. Both are enjoyable, and glad I tried it while it's around."
"D: Not a bad beer, but it's not something I would have more than one of. I think I definitely prefer the Double Bag over this one."
"Good sipping beer, very sweet. Wouldn't have more than one. Decent beer though."
"Draft at the brewery back in November of 2008. I decided to try it based on it's limit brewing, despite the fact that I prefer hops to malt. Clear burnt orange pour with a thin off-white head. The aroma is an abundance of malty sweetness. Taste is similar with a European hop finish."
"Off the tap at the Scuffer (thanks Mike & Mike!) this brew was a dark amber/copper color with an off-white head. The retention was not very impressive but the lacing was adequate. The aroma was sweet and spoke to me of rich malt, green apples and some sourness and vinegar. The flavors were of caramel malt, toffee, ripe fruit and fruity alcohol esters with a slightly bitter and hop-filled finish. Though pleasant enough I continued to feel they missed the mark for the style. The mouthfeel was nice and the softer carbonation helped the beer be quaffable. But the Double Bag was still better in my opinion."
"This is a good one. Light enough to enjoy, hearty enough to keep warm. Or, as Ron Hawkins' amp used to say, ""Clean enough to be healthy, dirty enough to be happy)."
"D: A nice mouthfeel and taste combination. A pretty good, easy drinking beer that was pretty good overall and definitely worth a go if you have the chance."
"Fairly syrupy and thick body created a bog mouth feel. One to be savored and certainly not a session beer. I found it quite drinkable and enjoyed this beer."
"Not bad..."
"A strong ale indeed, and I'd be willing to revisit it. I think the flavors were still pretty raw, but liquor drinkers would probably relish in the wooded, smokey nut and fruit flavors of this strong, sweet concoction. Worth a try, but keep your expectations in check."
"Draught: This one pours a somewhat ruby tinged mahogany. There was almost no head and lacing. I was not quite sure what to make of the aroma. There was a sweetness to it, but it lacked any kind of caramel, toffee of fruits that you might expect with a beer like this. It smelled a bit astringent. There was not a lot of sweetness to the taste. In fact, it had a very dry finish. A bit of alcohol to the taste, maybe some fruits and caramel, maybe a bit woody. I do not think I will be drinking this one again. It just was not that good."
"This was a pretty drinkable beer for the ABV. A good winter beer I'd say."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, spritzy up front, with toffee, and sourdough battling along the palate, leading to a chewy finish."
"1094"
"Overall one of the strangest beers I can remember trying. Very spices and sweet, with a flavor that is really hard to nail down. Still a solid choice and I would not shy away from it again."
"Good cold weather sipping beer, preferably in front of a fire, perhaps with a dark cigar."
"Had on tap at Union Brewhouse. Poured into a 10oz. pint glass- a dark ruby color with a thin white head that dissapates quickly. Aromas of sweet malt, and some sweet dark fruits and candy. Maybe some oak or booze as well. Tastes similar. Very sweet with a hint of alcohol towards the end. Great sipping beer for a xold night, and very drinkable despite the higher abv. Slick mouthfeel with little carbonation."
"Pretty good, but nothing amazing."
"D: Decently drinkable but a bit boozy."
"Drinkability: Not really a session beer but not a sipper either."
"This brew is alright. Not stellar just average."
"A very tasty American Strong Ale!"
"D: As recommended and I expected, this is a fantastic beer in many respects. Triplebag goes to show you American brewers can come up with some wonderful creations while following our elder brothers in the brewmaking process. This is a strong beer and one to be drawn out to release the library of flavors. Look forward to picking up a growler of this and sipping with the wife by the fire this winter."
"M&D--Definitely a sippin beer, as the mouthfeel is more or less like trying to hold a water balloon in your mouth. Had to review this from notes because I couldn't read words off the computer screen after two pints. 8.2? Bull...corn--I think this is closer to 9 or 10, but I ain't got no proof of that. Also and last, the fella at Bierkraft in brooklyn told me this was a Doppelsticke, but whatever (dunno if BA even has that as an option)."
"Long Trail Triple Bag...what a crazy name for a brew!!! This is a highly malty version of the Double Bag. Pours a copper colour,leaving light lacing. Mild nose, just a better than average American Ale at 8.2% ABV. Not a brew to quench the thirst, but to appreciate the great flavours of this not so hoppy ale."
