"A little too hot for my liking, otherwise it was very good. Probably not something I would seek out again unless it were sitting on a shelf, but I am glad to have tried it."

"O-This is a tasty beer. It straddles the line between stout and strong ale. Don't drink this looking for hops because you wont find any. I liked the chewy feel, some may think it is too think. A very new new world beer."
"This is my absolute favorite beer, it's perfectly balanced and has a nice alcohol bite."
""
"The finest beer I've ever tasted. Thank you Fremont."

"Wow this is a really well done beer.  Initial thought as it hits my tongue is 'uncle jacobs' like.  Which happens to be one of my favorite beers so that means I like it, I like it a lot.  Very well balanced, not too much heat, lots of deep flavor and bourbon characteristics, creamy vanilla and sweet chocolate.  The earthy, wood flavors hint in at the end - this is really good."
""
""
""
""
""
"2014 Version. Drinking really smooth despite the heat and recent vintage. I'd buy this again and again (if I could find it). Heat from the bourbon and abv is warming but not so overwhelming that you miss the notes of chocolate and some vanilla. Slightly sweet too (with dark brown sugar notes). Really delicious."
""

"Thoroughly enjoyed this Fremont release.... wow!"

"Poured from a 2014 dated bomber into a snifter.  Pours like a stout, with a deep black body and a finger of khaki head.  Nose of brown sugar, vanilla, oak and booze.  Taste was brown sugar, vanilla, and a chocolate covered cherry finish.  It was a little light in the mouth, but still satifying.  Overall this was an outstanding beer. In the same class as parabola and bcbs."

"What boots this rating down for me a little bit is that the mouthfeel is quite cloying and syrupy. The flavor is good overall: love the bourbon vanilla but it is a bit sweet for my tastes. A 4 oz pour would have been perfect. It's the syrupy, muddled finish that keeps the beer from an upper echelon rating for me. There are many breweries across the country that can create a barrel aged beer that finishes well all the way through the taste experience. This one doesn't finish well with that caramel-ly syrupy finish."
"O: A really enjoyable beer. I never had the original version but I would definitely seek out the other versions, and this one, again."

"This is as close to Bourbon County as I've had in a while. Thick, rich and decadent but not as boozy and sweet... which is a good thing. This beer is the real deal! Certainly worth seeking out."
""
""
""
"A wonderfully complex beer with a balance of bourbon, caramel sweetness, hops, and a touch of stout qualities."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from 22oz bottle; pours black with at least a finger of tan head that dissipates within a few minutes. Wonderful aroma of bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, and a fig or date smell that is reminiscent of a barleywine. Taste is delicious; you get a nice amount of bourbon but not overpowering. Other tastes of vanilla, caramel, subtle chocolate, and again that fruity/fig-like essence. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and smooth, nicely carbonated. Overall, this is a special treat that does not seem as big as it feels after imbibing 11oz of this toasty goodness."
""
"Served alongside Cinnamon & Coffee Bourbon Abominable. Near black body with a small beige collar. Rich aroma of bourbon and malts. Big time oak presence with lovely notes of both chocolate and vanilla. Absolutely delicious."
""
""
""
"Aged in 15yr old bourbon barrels - am interested to know which exactly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent nose and a bit boozy."
""
""
""
""
"If I hadn’t just recently had Spice Wars, I’d call this excellent. It’s still very good, but it doesn’t have the complexity or the smoothness of that beer. I’d be interested in getting another bottle or two and laying them down for a year or two and see what it’s like when it’s mellowed a bit."
""
""

"This is all coconut and vanilla. Big bourbon notes. Exceptionally smooth.  Decently thick, coating mouth feel."

"Overall amazing, but not really a winter warmer, more barrel aged stout."

"The flavor is really where it's at for me.  Great bourbon character, strong vanilla notes, caramel, dark roasted malt, bitter chocolate.  This tastes considerably better than it smells.  A bit hot, sticky finish.  Overall, just drink it.  It tastes great."

"One of my favorite barrel-aged beers, and a great example of Fremont's exceptional brewing skill."

"A fantastic beer.  Listed as an old ale but tastes like a top notch barreled barleywine."

"22oz bottle of the 2012 vintage thanks to a trading buddy. Dark borwn color, short head. Smells pretty nice, bourbon, booze, wood. Flavor is pretty good too, heavily bourbon influenced, boozy, oak, vanilla, not bad at all. If I had to guess blindfolded I would have said this was a bourbon barrel aged barleywine."

"O - Definitely one of Washington's finest beers. The bourbon character is beautifully expressed. I'd like a little more spice and perhaps a little more roasted malt flavour. This is nonetheless a wonderfully crafted brew, and, if it weren't for my preference for the flavour profile of stouts, (more chocolate, peat and coffee) this might score even higher. The abv. is entirely an afterthought. A must try, particularly if you like vanilla and bourbon."
"Overall - Barrel is the highlight and the beer is just interesting enough to prop up the barrel flavors."
""
"The 2013 Abominable Bourbon Winter Ale was served to me, by myself, from a half growler I filled about half an hour ago. This ale appears pitch black with a smooth, tan, minimal head. There are ultra-fine bubbles that seem to melt from the sides as I move the ale around in my brandy snifter. As I give the drink some time to settle, the head has retreated back into a halo, with a spotty, uneven, smooth, fine cover of bubbles. The smell is of sweet vanilla, caramel, and a hint of alcohol, nothing else. The taste is rich, delicious, and decadent, like a fine desert. There is vanilla, light caramel, spice, molasses, and an obscure, taste of booze/alcohol/bourbon. The mouthfeel is faintly sizzling with sweet feedback. No bitter taste, no after taste, no complaints. Only recommendations."

"Quite enjoyable."

"Not that I'm surprised, but this is yet another excellent beer from the folks at Fremont Brewing. Also, good as it tasted at Fred Fest 2014, I think this beer is built for the long haul, and will likely only improve with a few years of bottle (or barrel/keg) age. Impressive."

"wonderful bourbon barrel usage here, as good as any, lots of burnt oak flavor with the attendant vanilla and booze, all are soft and gentle though, and none so dominant as to displace the strong ale base on this, which is a caramel malt bomb, super thick, and downright delicious, although a bit out of season right now i think. reddish hues of caramel and molasses color, and the aromas are similarly sweet, toffee and vanilla dessert come to mind, and of course the bourbon, which adds richness, sweetness, and the feeling like im having something of extreme quality. the flavor is sweet from the outset, but doesnt really finish that way, more of a quicker boozy hit to wind it down. vanilla is strong, and the oak contributes quite a bit, but the base beer is exceptional. as much sticky sweet grain as you can pack in here, which gives a luxurious mouthfeel to this highly viscous brew. carbonation is low medium, but its all i really need in this style. something more than a barleywine here, but in that sort of vein stylistically. my first brew from fremont is an absolute pleasure, made even more enjoyable by sharing it with some of the gentlemen responsible for its existence. a real treat worthy of its high praise."

"O - A very pleasant, warming winter ale. Everything is well integrated. Highly recommended."
""
""
"Taste is sweet and thick with a smoothness rarely found on an 11+ %'er. Marshmallow fluff meets whiskey barrel. Burnt caramel, molasses and cocoa powder flavors as well. The mouthfeel is quite full and silky. Amazing beer that I wish I had more of...much more."

"Overall- After a few more sips, this might graduate to a great beer. It is, without a doubt, a really good beer and it's almost great. This is a must try and I'm leaning toward great. No flaws, absolutely solid, complete with an endearing sublimity next to evident alcohol. Very well put together- I appreciate brewers that are this meticulous."

"Fuller end of medium bodied with soft carbonation.  Really nice mouthfeel for the style.  Thick but not viscous with surprising crisp carbonation that really helps.  Again, the barrel presnce is really prominent with lots of bourbon flavor but it's not hot or overly boozy.  Sweet bourbon with some spicy rye along with dry, toasted oak, vanilla bean and some toasted coconut.  After the beer warms, I'm picking up more dark malt, spice and vinous fruit sweetness.  A little peppery spice and rye compliment the spirit flavors.  There's also some cherry and other dark berries along with some silky chooclate sweetness and subtle roast.  Still, this beer is a bit bourbon heavy but the lack of heat makes it pretty easy to drink."
""
"Verdict: A nice Bourbon treated beer from Fremont. The chicory root flavor isn't my favorite, but the smooth and rich flavors are very nice, it's just a touch on the earthy side and it could use a bit more body. That being said I had no issue finishing a bomber of this."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, 2012 vintage. Pours fairly pitch black color with a small tan head with poor retention, that reduces to a thin lace that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, cinnamon, toast, dark bread, pepper, clove, bourbon, vanilla, oak, toffee, raisin, brown sugar, and roasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of malt, spice, and barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, cinnamon, vanilla, oak, clove, bourbon, toffee, molasses, light raisin, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, cinnamon, dark bread, clove, vanilla, oak, bourbon, toffee, brown sugar, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of malt, spice, and barrel flavors; with huge robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and moderately syrupy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible barrel aged winter ale! All around incredible balance and complexity of dark malt, spice, and barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly amazing offering as expected."

"This beer was amazing on all levels... I havent given a beer 5's across the board in a long time but this one deserved it... Oaky bourbon mixed with warm vanilla beans and smooth dark chocolate... hints of booze here and there... nice warm feeling in the belly after each sip... the bourbon isn't overdone here... its a key player but not a dominant force... the warm chocolate aspects really shine through and the nuances of the barrel make this a true delight to sip and enjoy... this beer made the campfire seem warmer, the friends seemed friendlier and I was happy as could be the entire time I was enjoying this. What more can one ask for in a beer?"
"It is the middle of summer and yet i'm drinking this awesome ale. Very strong at 11%, yet balanced and delicious. Very little head, and an intricate flavor pattern that changes as it watms and yet maintains the bourbon undertones. I love this beer and still have four left!"
""
""
""
""
"O- This one kills it in the flavor category. Obviously, age has treated it well. Thank you SatlyMalty for dipping into your cellar to send me this dangerously tasty brew."
""
""
"O: damn this brew is so freaking good. and i will be always ISO for it. mouthfeel is everything that i want in a BBA brew. big thick, chewy, beautiful lingers sweetness that can cut out the alcohol heat. simply terrific."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall very nice. Restrained and untainted."
"O - Great flavorful beer with lots of vanilla, caramel, and chocolate. The amount of barrel in this one makes you understand why they call it B-Bomb."

"easy to drink for a big beer and I'm wishing I had another couple bottles to age as I could see this improving with some time behind it. well worth seeking out but grab one now and one for later"

"O- A really tasty beer, the barrel flavors are sweet, rich, and just all-around delicious. I really enjoyed this one."
"Overall a very pleasant beer."
"o: a big fan of this one, almost running into stout territory, but more towards the balance of rich sugars and bourbon/vanilla with some chocolate accompaniment that roast-focused"
"Overall. A fantastic bourbon stout. Really diggin' this one and a perfect way to start a 4 day weekend!"

"An interesting take and result for a barrel aged brew. Fun one to drink also, and very easy drinking also."
""
""
"Phenomenal. Intense maltiness and barrel flavors without being too sweet. Just amazing overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Interesting stuff. It's definitely a 'winter' ale and somewhat hard to peg style-wise. A bit more heft and spritz would do this wonders, but it's still pretty enjoyable. I'd have this again, although I don't know if I'd go out of my way to trade for it in the future."
""
""
"Devilishly smooth and easily drinkable, complete with the traditional flavors you'd expect from a BBA barleywine, though it's labeled as a ""strong ale"". Creamy bourbon and oak, along with a unique bittersweet cocoa flavor that comes into play."
"***Absolutely fabulous. Never felt daunting or Undrinkable, even for its size. Wonderful barrel characters and a phenomenal base. Easily in my top ten."
""
""
"Pours a dark brown color, this beer almost looks like a stout. The smell is sweet with some dark fruit and caramel notes. There is a strong sweetness in the flavor, but the roasted malt notes balance it out a bit. I enjoyed the caramel and dark fruit along with the bourbon. The finish is sweet with a roast bitterness."

"Fantastic beer. Thick and sludgy with a wonderful heavy barrel experience. This one is dripping in bourbon, oak and vanilla. Different style, but still leaps and bounds ahead of KDS as far as Fremont BA beers. I downed a whole bottle of this myself and it was good to the last drop."
"O - This is close to being a flawless example of the style. Close, but not quite there."
"Fantastic. This is special stuff. Disappointing (lack of) aroma, though."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer has a moderate amount of booziness, but the sweetness and mild chocolate aspect with substantial vanilla does work out to be a decent beer. I don't think my rating is gonna be above the average, but, when judged by a non local, I think this will be an overall positive experience, just don't have your expectations so high that you think you're getting a world class experience, you're just getting a good PacNW experience in terms of barrel experiments, definitely one of their best yet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Another great one from Fremont in the barrel aged category."
"O: A great beer, the barrel shines through nicely and did an amazing job of transforming ABomb into BBomb."
""
""
""
"Opaque dark brown body with low carbonation. Almost stout-like in appearance. The nose is great, heavy on rich brown sugar, vanilla and caramel. Plenty of bourbon barrel. Leather notes pop out as it warms, along with a little black licorice. The palate brings a nice mix of sweet burnt sugar, bourbon, vanilla and leather. Body is full, almost syrupy. Mellow heat. Finishes on the dry side, quite a bit of tannic oak. Surprisingly great beer."
""
""
"(O)- Just a fantastic beer. Awesome barrel integration into the overall profile of the base beer. An american strong ale is kind of a catch all style in my eyes, but its been awhile since one has really impressed me in awhile. This is just plain good!"
"O: An outstanding barrel-aged beer. I recently acquired two bottles, and was planning on cellaring the second. We'll see how long I can hold out."
"In a sea of bourbon barrel-aged beers that continues to trend, this one is above the middle of the pack. Smacks of that bourbon barrel it was aged in. Balances just enough, while still stirring the palate with interest. Damn tasty."
""
""
""
"My thanks to gueuzehead for this special brew. Poured from 22oz bomber into tulip glass. Pours a dark brown/almost-black appearance with a half inch off-white head that dissipates within the next minute. The nose picked up oaky vanilla, light undertones of licorice, figs, mild chocolate, and bourbon. The flavor packs a nice, smooth, but a wallop of bourbon heat and goodness along with some caramel, chocolate, chocolate malts. Medium to just pre-thick mouthfeel with a nice stickiness to it. Nice, smooth, and warming backfinish with some pleasant bourbon heat. I was sure glad this beer was classified as a winter warmer because this bit a piece of Hardywood GBS (and the bourbon version as well) from behind for the all-time winter beers I've had to date. A really nice job by Fremont Brewing."
""
""
"O: This was very delicious. The spices still came through while the barrel really shined. I'd love to lay one down and see what some age does to it."
"O. I've heard this described as a barleywine but I would say it's closer to a stout. In fact, it reminds me very much of Goose Island's Bourbon County Brand Stout, perhaps with a slightly less decadent base beer. If you haven't figured it out by now, the fact that I am comparing this to BCBS means it is an outstanding brew. The effort and care that went into creating this is apparent from the first sip. Haven't had Kentucky Dark Star, but I am seriously ISO after Abominable here. If it is anything like this, than Fremont may just have a barrel program on its hands that rivals Goose Island and Firestone Walker. Very well done."
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown on black with a slight etching of light mocha foam. Smells fucking awesome, bourbon, vanilla, nougat, caramel, vitamins and minerals, some marshmallow cream and a little bit of burnt cream. Taste follows suite - vanilla, nougat, marshmallow, chocolate, bourbon, oak, smooth malts with a touch of alcohol. Really decadent. Full bodied with limited carb and a fantastically long and mouth watering finish. I'm really, really impressed with this beer. Wow. Nice."
""
""
"An excellent whiskey beer. Rather expensive. I got mine for $18USD for a 22oz bottle at a local grocery, which is by far the highest price for any bottled beer I've seen in a non-specialty store. But I have to say that it was worth every penny. Would buy again."
""
"O - Really nice BA beer. Strong ale is probably an accurate term...maybe a bit of an American Barleywine...balanced without the over the top hops that can sometimes be found in the style. Actually, the more I drink this...strong ale is appropriate. Nicely complex with very good blend of sugary flavors, almost ideal integration of bourbon barrel aging...super smooth - alcohol is noticeable but in control with just enough intensity and not overpowering the beeriness. This is quite nice."
"Overall: This is an awesome winter sipper. Sweet bourbon rich beer that doesn't fit nicely into any category. Good complexity. There are better BA beers but there's nothing bad to say about this one. Could be a little more balanced with the alcohol but it's never unpleasant."
"O: This is a most excellent beer. One of the best BA beers I've had. Would definitely seek this out on a regular basis."
""
"O: I actually didn't like this beer at first. I might have started at too cold a temperature, but even after letting it warm, I didn't think it improved significantly. On the other hand, didn't think it was worthy of being poured down the drain, so I opened an IPA, and found that alternating between this beer and an IPA made both beers better."
""
""
"Note: We drank a 2012 vintage last night and it was spectacular. The mouthfeel was much thicker and heavier than the 2011, which helped the overall experience. Excellent stuff. Easily a 4.5 beer. Thanks again Erik!"
""
""
""
""
"O: This lived up to the hype and really impressed me. I would drink this all the time if it was available to me."
""
"O- Very nice BA beer. Pretty bourbon forward but works well in this beer."
""
"Sterling example on a barrel aged bourbon forward beer. Can tell why they call this the catch all ""strong ale"" as opposed to stout or barleywine."
"My belly is warm for a beer still, albeit barely, in the single digits. Eminently drinkable, this improves markedly as it warms a bit; rather flat when cold, it really opens up. Really good, just a cold nose from the upper echelon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"To describe this beer in two words: smooth and deep. Excellent integration of the base beer and the barrel flavors, bringing out the best of both. Sweet, rich, and fabulously flavorful. Up there with my favorite barrel-aged English barleywines (or whatever you want to call them)."
""
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, vanilla, wood, bourbon, and some slight smoke aromas. Taste is much the same with a woody and bourbon forward finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a nice aroma and a great flavor that make it easy to drink."
"Drink- I can see why this was so coveted. It had great flavor. It was rich and spicy and bourbon forward but retained the winter warmer flavors. Outstanding job."
""
"O: decent beer. The major flaw is the mouthfeel, but I also don't care for the spiciness. It's not overpowering, but just under the surface. For some reason it doesn't jive with me."
""
""
"Overall, just wow. One of the best beers I've had in a while. Simply outstanding. Expectations not only met, but exceeded. Fremont does it again. I'll gladly pay $17/bottle for more of this next year."
""
""
"4, 4.5, 4, 4, 4"
""
""
"Overall: World-class."
""
""
""
"O - A very good bourbon aged beer. Bronze for a reason."
""
"Overall, this is a winner. Thank you very much Matt. If you have a bottle, drink it now. You won't be disappointed. Then, trade for another."
""
""
""
"Major Kudos to Fremont Brewing for creating that rarest of beers worthy of being called an instant classic."
""
"o- very fine beer! really glad to try it. both of us enjoyed each glass. i think i was impatient with this one dammit as i feel with a bit more age this one will be steller, malt meld the fruit and barrel together while toning down burn. would love to try this one with a year on it!"
"Overall, this brew backed up it's high rating and regards. Exceptionally complex beer w/ utterly perfect BA qualities, and oh so smooth. Fantastic stuff!"
"This is one of those cases where I should have shared this beer with someone, but I'm selfishly glad I didn't. Pours jet black with tons of lacing, not a complaint in the world. Smells divine. Great balance of oak, bourbon, chocolate, dark fruit, banana bread and spice. Taste follows the nose but is incredibly rich, almost, but not to a fault. Mouthfeel is semi carbonated and fairly syrupy but finishes long and a little bitter. This is a really great seasonal beer. I would not be so greedy next time as this would be a perfect finish to thanksgiving, or christmas dinner. I wish I would have bought another bottle!"
"overall: fantastic"
"Overall: I love it when breweries can make a barrel aged beer with near perfect carbonation like this. It makes the beer experience that much better. It balanced and its complex. Big flavors yet remains smooth. Just a great beer! Its makes me think this is a beer that would have been the brain child of a collaboration between Firestone Walker and Hair of the Dog. It reminds me of an english barleywine and an Olde Ale blended then barrel aged."
""
""
""
""
"This is very delicious. Great stuff."
"The body is full with smooth carbonation. A little hot on the finish. Overall this one is real tasty. Glad to have the chance to give it a whirl."
"Thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"O: This is an excellent beer, IMO. Best local beer I tasted to date. Hope this beer gets produced more and distributed wider. Maybe a bit pricey though (although worth the try - yes you should seek this one out)."
"O- A truly nice brew. Big bold bourbon flavor initially with a smooth well balanced finish."
""
""
"2010 vintage. Served in a snifter and a fairly aggressive pour reveals a quarter inch off-white head. The smell is big vanilla, bourbon and malty sweetness, and the taste reveals much of the same. The mouthfeel isn't quite as creamy as I would have expected, but overall this is a fantastic beer."
""
"O- A bit spendy, but I wasnt disappointed, I cant think of many delicious barrel-aged beers from this state. This is one of them."
""
"The pour is dark brown in color with a small khaki head. The aroma starts off with lots of roast and a bit of coffee. Bourbon is there, but not very strong. There's more oak than bourbon. Some toffee sweetness with a bit of dark chocolate. Again, not much bourbon flavor, but there is some oak and vanilla. A bit of roast and coffee with a fair amount of dark chocolate. Moderate sweetness of caramel and toffee. Actually sort of mellow."
"O: A wonderful beer. Very tasty. The vanilla comes through awesomely. Look for this beer. Fremont is by far the best Seattle brewery, IMO."
""
"Poured into an Ommegang flute. Pours a very dark brown, appearing black with red highlights at the edges. Thin fine light brown head dissipates into a ring, light lacing. Aroma is bourbon with slight hints of vanilla, wood and dark malt. Flavor is amazing, dark and caramel malt and dark fruit and strong bourbon. Oak and malt in the finish, with a hint of hops. Nice heavy, viscous body. The bourbon is so distinct this tastes like a boilermaker made with a stout and bourbon. Really tastes good. I'm very impressed."
"O: Dang good brew...was a pleasant surprise for sure...the best local beer I have had."

"Just delicious, I can't get over the bourbony vanilla smell... it was fantastic. This beer should get Fremont noticed."
"A great beer. Disappointed they would only allow me two bottles. With aging, this should be a fantastic beer. Plan to get some more when a second batch is released in Feb 2011."
"Overall this is a pretty good bourbon barrel aged beer. The only problem is that it is quite rich which makes it difficult to drink a lot of. An excellent effort by Fremont Brewing that is worth seeking out."
"O: This is by far one of the best beers I've had from Fremont. Clearly they know how to barrel age and blend, as this is flavorful, aromatic and just flat out delicious. I can't wait for their lambics and eventually gueuzes. These guys might be the only WA brewery that gives a shit about making quality beer of all styles. Keep it up guys!"

"Overall: A well balanced, highly drinkable, and thoroughly enjoyable bourbon barrel aged strong ale. I've been enjoying the hell out of this for the last two hours. Really killer stuff."
"O: Great barrel character, not super rich and full bit definitely good. Sort of like a lighter bodied, higher carbed, less rich angel's share (but for what it is it is plenty rich), in ways it is similar to abacus"
"Thanks to jedwards for sharing. 2010 vintage, bottling #3, bottle number 19 out of 240. Pours a murky, reddish-brown with no head, just a soapy skim and sudsy bubbles around the shoulders. Nose is malty, slightly vinous and also expresses figs and raisins. Fantastic flavors - bourbon, vanilla and a buttery quality on a nice malty backbone - dark fruits are interspersed nicely through the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light, perhaps a little watery, with a mild carbonation. This is a great beer. I would classify it as being closer to an Old Ale than an American Strong, however. That being said, a truly exceptional beer if you have the opportunity to try it."
"D: Oh yeah. Easy to drink and a very good beer overall"
"Drinkability very good, this is a super tasty bourbon barrel dark ale that is smooth as silk and light in the body. Packing plenty of flavor, I could drink a lot of this without realizing what hit me!"
"This beer is worth seeking out, it's certainly worth the road trip from Portland to Seattle. If you're west of the Cascades, you should try this."
"What a delicious treat! The Abominable is a delightful beer in itself, but this bourbon barrel version is outstanding. A beauteous brown beverage with ruby highlights. Like what a grizzly would look like after a session in a Seattle salon. Smells like bourbon and vanilla with a little caramel and chocolate. This is a bourbon sandwich, it starts with that classy bourbon bite, before mellowing into an exceptional winter ale, with the caramel, coffee, and chocolate flavors prevalent before giving way to the crumbling intensity of the bourbon on the back end. As this baby quickly disappears, it leaves vanilla and bourbon heat trickling viciously. Should've gotten a growler, but they were short-handed and it would've been selfish to hold them up any longer after their graciousness."
