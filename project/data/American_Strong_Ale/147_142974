Aromas of vanilla, brown sugar, resinous hops, a subtle spice blend, and old world fruit sweetness. Very rich and layered. Flavors are hopped bitter forward, with a resinous blast of bitter green notes, followed by a vanilla and woody undertone, a heavy dose of booze, and all of the sweet and rich notes from the aromas seem to lessen. Very subtle Belgian yeast notes and spice blend nod their head in there, too, to add some depth. The body is robust and smooth, with a boozy and hop resinous aftertaste. The finish is slick and dry, with a booze and old world fruit linger cleaned up from the heavy hops bitterness. Big beer, and damn tasty.","GarthDanielson","Feb 07, 2015"

The taste is that of a slightly more refined Arrogant Bastard. The bourbon is subtle at best, but a nice vanilla tone is to be found, along with brown sugar and a nice alcohol tingle. It has decent body and adequate carbonation to produce an enjoyable feeling. Overall it is a great beer. It will probably fall short of what some people expect from a barrel aged beer, but it's a solid offering. If you like regular Arrogant Bastard this is certainly worth trying.","ZebraCakez","Jan 03, 2015"

4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"22 ounce bottle, printing is a bit smudged but it looks like it says it was bottled on 09/24/14.  Served in a snifter, the beer pours a mostly clear ruby red/chestnut brown color with about an inch light tan head.  Head retention is OK, and there's a lot of lacing.  I like the aroma, it smells like piney hops, dark fruit, caramel, oak, and a bit of vanilla and bourbon.  I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some bready malt and citrus peel noticeable.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's coating and has a decent amount of carbonation.  I'm not sure how long this was aged in bourbon barrels, but I'd guess it wasn't for a very long time.  Not that I'm complaining, but this was hoppier and less bourbony than I expected it to be.  With that being said, I liked it.  Part of the Bastard Box, $20 for bombers of regular, bourbon barrel, Lukcy Basartd and Double Bastard isn't a bad deal at all!","bluejacket74","Nov 20, 2014"

The smoke, oak and bourbon flavors are very much there but it's not overpoweringly boozy or syrupy. If you want a beer that imparts the taste of bourbon but isn't gonna hit you over the head this great. By the end I thought I was drinking liquid wood in a good way. Arrogant Bastard bitterness was still somewhat there and it blended nicely on the finish with the woody qualities. Even for bourbon drinkers who don't always want to sip on a whiskey to get the flavors they're after should try this beer if they get the chance.","samtrillo","Nov 17, 2014"

This stuff pours a lightly-hazy tawny-amber topped by a finger of dirty khaki foam (gotta take those slacks off before you hit the rugby pitch).  The nose comprises oak, maple syrup, mild whiskey, and mixed greens.  The taste brings in more of the same, with a tad more syrup and oak, some pine resin, and a twinge of sharp grapefruit rind.  The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.

Pours a deep red amber with ruby tones and a half finger light khaki head that dissipates to patches, but leaving good lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus hops, light oak and bourbon. Flavor is mellow dark malt with suggestions of dark dried fruit, citrus hops and a pleasant light oak and bourbon overlay. Lightly creamy body, but light carbonation. An interesting take on the Arrogant Bastard line, with the same classic hop profile, but softer and more integrated. The malt is reminiscent of old ale malt more than the lighter caramel malt in the base beer, which is a great fit with the other flavors. The bourbon and oak are less forward than in other bourbon ales or oaked Bastard, but integrate well. Although there is a good bitter finish, no a hop bomb like the base beer and other variants, but still hop forward. Very different than the original and from what I expected, but I like this a lot. The more subtle flavors played well with each other and none dominate. I'd get this again if it was brewed. I was reluctant to buy the four pack just to try this one, but the other beers in it are so great (I actually liked Lukcy better this time around) that it was pretty painless. Great four pack.","LiquidAmber","Nov 15, 2014"

Which is a good thing—the subtle barrel/spirit notes (a bit of oak, some vanilla, hints of toffee, brown sugar, and maybe coconut) blend really nicely into the background of the standard Arrogant Bastard profile. While I could see a more barrel-forward brew being just as complex, it could just as easily suffer and become one-dimensional. In the increasingly crowded field of barrel-aged everything, Stone once again proves that they can set themselves apart and do something interesting.

It does seem to give it a much smoother, mellow feel, but the flavor is very faint. Much more noticeable in the aroma. There is a little wood flavor and some burn as it gets warm, but I think it is drowned out by the hop profile. It is slightly sour too, like raisins. Some caramel malts and much more muted hops than any of the other bastards. I definitely like it more than regular Arrogant, but not sure if I prefer over Oaked other than the feel. I would describe it as a cross between an american barley wine and an old ale. Very good overall.","WesMantooth","Nov 02, 2014"

3.91,0.3,4,4.25,3.75,4,3.75,"22oz bottle from the new Bastard four pack which is a great deal at $22. Looks pretty much like standard Arrogant Bastard. Aroma is a very nice bourbon and oak aroma. Flavor is good, basically AB with a touch of bourbon but for me it's a little too thin. Bourbon barrel aged Double Bastard would probably work a lot better.","ArrogantB","Beers"
