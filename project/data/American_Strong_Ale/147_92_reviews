"Overall: This is an average strong ale for me. The aromas had some promise but i was disappointed in the taste. Theres not enough malt to balance out the hops. I thinks its too hoppy and bitter for the style. I really enjoy a few of Stones' IPAs but i personally feel they are a bit overrated as a whole. Ill probably pass on this one from now on. Cant really go wrong at $5 a bomber though"

""
""
"Overall: This is a bold and flavorful brew. Has sweet malty flavors and bitter hops for a great combo. Excellent ale."
""
""
""
"Malty, bitter, and dry. One of my gateway beers into the craft world, and overall an outstanding brew from one of the titans of the industry."
""
""
"O - The faint nose makes the strong hop character a nice surprise"
""
""
""
"Very good and flavorful. Smells great."
""
""
"-overall it is one of my favorite grab and go beers!"
"Sweet caramel smell. Good balance of malt and hops."
"Overall, this is a bold and flavorful brew with a terrific presentation and mouthfeel.  The hops are a little heavy-handed for my tastes, but it’s Stone, so I knew what I was getting into.  With that said, it’s easy to see why this is one of their flagship brews."

""
""
"Good dark copper color. Lacks something in taste.  Seems like a bit of a burnt raisin finish.  Good strong ale. Great head when poured into a pint glass from a bottle. Overall a good beer but not my favorite Stone by a long shot."
""
""
"Dark ruby color that is crisp and hazy with lots of lace.. A/T piney hop, peach, pie crust, caramel, toffee, citrus.. Slight notice of alcohol.. Good balance with an edge to the bitterness.. Medium body.. Good beer"
""
""
""
"Hands down one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Solid beer with good flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorites. Very hard hitting and flavorful. Hated it when I first tried it, but bought it a few more times as my pallet grew and now I love it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely a big beer. It's very bitter but the malts even it out and it has just enough grapefruit in the aftertaste to keep it well-balanced. I'm getting hints of dark fruits on the aftertaste as well. This would be a great beer to have with a hearty German food meal."
""
""
""
"Awesome. Pure and hard hitting. One of my top favorites"
""
""
""
"I've had this beer many times over the last six years, although my tastes have evolved, this is still a bold, flavorful, easy drinking ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Classic stone beer that i can enjoy all the time!"
""
"It's very tasty and as the label says, ""you probably won't like it!"" Ha!"
"Very good beer, but for the faint of heart. If you've never had this style before, the first sip can be intimidating. It's a beer to be sipped and savored, not chugged. Highly recommended."
""

""
"Bottle of arrogant bastard drank."
""
""
"Pours a clear cooper brown color with a two finger off white head.  Aroma is toffee, caramel, and resin.  Taste is pine, resin and bitterness.  Mouthfeel is medium with a bit of an oily feel.  Overall, a very good strong ale that is undeniably stone, no mistaking it."
"Overall: Just a great beer, every time I drink one I remember just how damn good this beer is. Really stands the test of time. Well done, Stone!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This ale is not worthy to reach my stomach. Actually I drank the whole pint poured on tap. It is unremarkable given verbiage on the label. Looked like muddy water. Had nice aroma but not as good as any Stone IPA. Aftertaste was poorly balanced bitterness and sweetness (can't put my finger on it). Lagunitas Brown Shugga is far superior. What a surprise, Stone brews are usually great."
""
""
"This is a big boy beer! An enjoyable Strong Ale, but very unique with a lot of nuance. I enjoyed it way more, closer to room temp. Sweet up front with a late bitter bite way after the finish. I can't believe it took so long for me to try this one."
""
""
""
"Pretty good but not great. I get it from time to time"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Don't take my advice personally, I'm just not much of a fan of strong ale's."
""
""
"I thought this one was just pretty good, not great. Their IPA beers are so much better in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a fan of the overall taste, not for the price at least. I've had much better beers than this, though it was highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
"This is a big, badass beer. I don't have much to add to the previous reviews. Arrogant Bastard looks great, smells good, and has layers of tastes. Caramel malts, candy, a bit of coffee and cola. This is definitely not a session beer - it kicks you right in the teeth, then smiles at you."

"For what it is its good kinda lika an ipa lots of hop taste little citrus poured out 22 oz bottle in goblet"
""
"Not all that good to me!"
""
"Similar rich, malty and bitter flavours. Comes off a little abrasive, could use a bit more sweet clean malt."
""
""
""
"Tasty but not overly memorable."
""
""
"Overall: I will admit this one has had some cellar time so it might have lost some hop bitterness. I remember it being extremely bitter the first time I tried it. I do not get that this time around. Its pretty well balanced over all and not nearly what the experience I had was the first time around. So, I guess I have lapped this one in its arrogance! Who's the arrogant bastard now?"
""
"Despite not being a style I would drink regularly, the IPA Hunter® owed it to himself to finally get around to reviewing this legendary beer. I like Stone; after all, they do hops, and they do it well. Getting a lot of fresh-baked bread and sugary sweetness on the nose. A bit like raisin bread, but very subdued. Not overwhelming; simply complimentary. Taste follows the nose, but there's unmistakable citrus hops on the finish. On the real. A bit prickly on the tongue, while not being exhausting or heavy on the mouthfeel. There's a fine line between arrogance and supreme confidence. Stone knew what they were doing with this one. I haven't been this excited while drinking a non-IPA since the last time I saw Lorna Morgan rocking some tasteful lingerie. Larrrrrrge!"
""
""
"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet, it's one of my favorite ""go to"" beers. Very malty, lots of fresh citrus fruit, and a lovely dry, bitter finish. Fantastic beer + very reasonable price = me coming back time and time again."
""
""
""
"O: [3.75] The balance is there on this beer.  The nose was a little weak and I am not getting specific flavor elements on the taste.  Overall it is a well made beer.  I would drink it again - but might not seek it out.  I think that since it is 10 days from expiration it may have lost some punch on the nose and taste."

"DATE TASTED: February 6, 2015... GLASSWARE: HopDevil nonick... OCCASION: Cavs going for thirteen in a row--tying a franchise record?... APPEARANCE: serious dark brown body with steady effervescence; thick as snow, creamy, chunky off-white head that craters and clings... AROMA: instant pineapple and peach erupt; earthier textures blanket the scent with caramel malts and some interesting yeasts... PALATE: a powerful, mouth-awakening grip that tingles the teeth to the ears; creamy, formidable, and crunchy--in other words, a balanced ale...TASTE: as expected, a brutal malt swamp that holds its ground against a hop-laden West Coast citrus pucker--quite agreeable in its arrogance; love the lingering bitterness on the tongue and teeth, even as the strength of  the malt  dissipates...OVERALL: an American classic that lives up to its hype again and again--attractive, strong, assertive, alcoholic, reasonably priced and available in bombers or sixes; a versatile and instant mood changer, despite the Cavs' losing..."

"Great combo of malt and hops and the yeast tops it off and brings it together with a subtle sweetness and velvety feel. You really have to look hard to find anything wrong with this one."
"Interesting. Appreciated the bourbon flavor but overwhelmed the hops"
"One of several Stone beers that doesn't disappoint."

"Dark red ale. Maltyness fades to hop profile. Reminds me a little bit of Bigfoot barley wine w/o the sweetness. Creamy mouthfeel"

"Nice thick head that you can float a bottle cap on. Very strong malt smell and flavor, and heavy aftertaste.  This is not a beer for beginners, nor the faint of heart.  I am fairly new to the beer tasting scene, and this is very strong and defiantly way out of my league.  I read the reviews and wanted to try it out.  It's gonna be a while before I try this one again.  But considering other reviews from the more experienced beer drinkers this is a great beer."
""
"One of the best beers."
""
""
""
"Loved this one!  The bitterness is good & strong but not obnoxious or unnecessarily so. The malt profile is clean & balanced with a slight powdered sugar aftertaste.  Some strong ales & barleywines are too sweet for my taste but this one pulls off the balance nicely."
""

"Hoppier than some IPA I've tried."

"This Ale is not for the faint of Heart,it is a very complex Brew,and if your average light beer drinker tried some,they would have their face ripped off,No this Beer is for people who enjoy Strong Ale's and full flavors,and Man OH Man,does this Brew have some gr8 Flavors!Nice and Hoppy,with a Medium ~Heavy mouth Feel,right off the Bat you get that awesome Grapefruit smell and taste,with a nice dash of Piney notes,along with tropical fruits,Carmel,toffee and so much other stuff going on it's as though you pickup something New every time you drink from yer glass,and while 7.2 A.B.V. is not really a high A.B.V. for this type of Ale,it is probably a brew you want to drink @ Home,or if you are out,make sure you have a designated driver or take a cab,because this stuff is so damn drinkable,tasty & plain Delicious,you will want to keep drinking it ,and that 7.2% A.B.V. WILL Catch up to you before you know it, now the double Bastard @ 11% A.B.V. is a real Ass Kicker,...and [IMHO] even Better~Cheers & Peace 2 all;]"

"As soon as I crack open the  bottle I instantly can smell the hoppy goodness that is within. As I sip the beer I taste notes of grapefruit. It appears to be a dark amber like color and it definitely goes down very smooth. This is one of my top 5 go to beers that's for sure. Very complex and very good!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Every time I feel that my tastebuds need their asses kicked, this is the beer that I buy. Intensely full flavored and hoppily bottled arrogance. I like to think that I am worthy of such a brutal beer from time to time."
"Very coarse both in taste and feel. Heavy blend of both hops and malt. I see this one got some strong ratings but it's not for me. Given that so many people seem to like this one, maybe I'll try it again in a year or two as my tastes continue to change and re-rate at that time."

"one of the beers that got me into crafts.. always good"
""
"I preferred the ""Oak Aged"" variety but no one near me seems too carry it any more. I guess I'm truly not worthy."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: ""Complex"" is generally a word bereft of true meaning, but if you want to get an idea what beer drinkers mean when they say it's ""complex," then drink this.  The tongue-in-cheek reference to being unworthy because you lack the sophistication to truly appreciate this beer actually comes through.  I like it.  I am very impressed."
""
"Very good.. First time in had this. Was not disappointed!"
""
""
""
"Great offering from Stone very hoppy with a dark amber color and strong ESB"
""
""
""
"Overall, in my opinion, this one does what I believe Stone meant to do, its ""arrogance"" is bitter but isn't exactly one I'd have with food. Just one makes a good session."
"Pours a deep ruby red & brown body. Aggressive bitterness and oak smack the palate around a bit. Always a classic."

"very bitter with a subtle bite to the cheeks"

"It's a good beer with a cool bottle. Bitter, hoppy, and buttery."

"Incredibly bitter with notes of almost chocolate towards the finish."
""
""
"o- Pleasant and complex. This is why I drink beer."
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful deep redish brown with a very light tan head. Smell is much more subtle than the name would imply but it gives you just enough hint at what's to come. Taste is where this beer makes its kill move, so smooth yet all the qualities that you want from a complex brew. As an IPA guy I love ther bitter bite at the end. Overall, this is my favorite beer, it's the beer I would constantly have fresh on tap in my house if possible."
""

"O: Great beer. Not for everyone. Essentially a Red IPA with powerful hop presence. Love it!"

"Great beer, if you don't like this your a retard or maybe I'm being an arrogant bastard."
"I was at an italian restaurant when I saw this name on the menu!...  I had to try it.  The alcohol content on this one must be high, because one of these big bottle s and i was G to the O-N-E.  I just remember it tasting really awesome.  I have had more and plan to drink more when I can.  I'm sorry, I don't have any better details then this, but that's all I remember!"

"As an aside it's nice to see Stone pumping the core brand again. With all the one-offs and special releases they've been doing it's easy for the consumer to overlook Arrogant Bastard. The value of this new Bastard Box bomber four pack is so ridiculous that it's a no-brainer buy for the consumer. Hopefully it brings some attention back to this great beer."

"While this beer is not for me, at least not yet, I did enjoy its' rather lovely amber red color, and complex aroma, the taste was rather on the bitter end for me, it was hard to pick up the malt in this brew, but maybe that's just my palate still becoming used to these craft brews, it did pour a nice 3 finger brownish head that lingered awhile in my 12 ounce mug, assuming an aggressive pour."

"I wasn't worthy enough to drink this beer 10 years ago in college as I specifically remember the drain pour. Now I understand the words spoken on the label; Stone pretty much nailed the strong ale style here."

"this is my absolute favorite beer, prior to drinking this i was a conossour of liquor and had only drank beer as an alcohol delivery system, this beer is singlehandedly responsible for expanding my interests and turning me into the beer snob that i am, as such i have to give it a perfect rating as no beer i have ever had has topped it to this point. its taste isnt very sweet, its fairly bitter, and its a dark amber color with a small head and not too agressive carbonation. mouth feel i found was consistent and somewhat chalky, but not enough to reduce the experience, though someone i introduced to this beer said he found it was like drinking charcoal. If your into dark ales this is a must try!"

"Overall - Stone isn't yanking your chain with the narrative found on the bottle: this sumbitch is one hell of an aggressive beer: a big flavor and sensory bomb with a truly assertive bitter bite on the finish that kicks you in the mouth. Maybe the greatest feat is how this brew still feels balanced after the flavor onslaught. I love it, but obviously this brew ain't for everyone."

"Deep brown in color with a half inch of khaki colored head.  Brussels lacing.  I get biscuity malt in the aroma.  The taste is plenty of biscuity malt with a touch of bitterness from piney hops.  There's a copper penny malt note in the fade.  The mouth is bone dry and slightly chalky."

"This beer showcases the ultra bitter approach to hops that was popular in the late nineties. This is the kind of beer that caused me to switch to wine and other beverages. The new school of hoppy beers showcase flavor and aroma elements to balance the bitterness. In the bastard, bitterness is forefront and dominant. A very unpleasant beer to drink."

"Great hop forward ale. Refreshing and excellently balanced."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a remarkable, fascinating beer... best way I could describe it is like a marriage of a Belgian Ale with an American IPA, and I think fans of either style could find a great deal to love here, with the rich malts skillfully set against aggressive hop bitterness. Powerful, challenging, but rewarding to those who can step up to it.  We are not worthy, indeed."

"A lesser brewery might try to catch your attention and call this a mahogany IPA or an Amber IPA; because it is bitter and really showcases the hops and the malt. Not Stone, though."

"Bomber enjoyed in a Lagunitas mason jar glass. The label is frankly awesome, ""yellow beer drinker"" insulting arrogance at its finest. The beer is a murky opaque reddish brown with a comfortable two fingers of notably dark yellow-tan creamy head. Makes me think smoky bar room. Aroma is well-toasted grains, resinous peppery and citrus rind hops, a whiff of raisins, fruity pipe tobacco, aromatic alcohol. Somehow strikes dark/malty and fresh/fruity chords at the same time. The palate starts with bitter spicy hops, some grapefruit peel and flower water, and quickly transitions to nutty toasted malts surprising devoid of toffee or caramel flavors (although these are down there in the mix). A grainy bitterness like burnt Ovaltine and graham crackers coupled with hints of chocolate and walnut. Ample alcohol flavor but this is skillfully done by design. I am getting some peach and more floral notes late. Perhaps a little coffee. Could be the most adept use of fusel alcohols I've yet to sample. Producing a nice warmth about two-thirds through but no (or little) hop burn. Despite these big flavors, the brew is silky smooth yet still rather thick. Caresses the palate. The heavy malts persist all the way through into the finish, which seems astonishingly dry for such a malty brew. The hops are the coda as well as the intro. Has to be experienced to be believed and obviously I'd snag any variants that should enter this still nascent but fortunately growing craft beer market. A near religious experience, on par with Ruination or nearly so."

"Overall - I was happily surprised to find that this beer was not just another Stone hop bomb. This beer reminds me, a little, of Sierra Nevada's Torpedo IPA (another beer with a little too much of everything). A very enjoyable ale, just make sure you are sitting down when you take the first sip."

"Tastes vegetal, pine resin, some grapefruit rind, raisons, and dried dark fruits. Some caramel present, and some thing I can't quite put my finger on. It finishes with a quick sharp bitterness that fades into more of a sensation than a flavor.  Overall, I would recommend this to those who like to question what they are tasting."

"Pours a dark reddish brown with a yellow tinted two finger head. The smell is a perfect balance between the hops and the sweet beady malt. Caramel, orange, vanilla, candy. The flavor is also a perfect balance. It's bitter,  very bitter,  but there is also a nutty sweetness. It's hard to honestly review this beer as it has been an old standard of mine. The First Craft Beer I Ever had."

"Overall: This is your typical West Coast hop bomb of a brew. It is delicious but for myself, I could only take a pint of it and then I had to move on. A 3.75 rating because it hits everything it's supposed to but that West Coast purposeful hop attack really isn't my favorite thing in the world. Worth a try and a great brewery to go visit!"

I cant think of a time where this would serve a purpose that an IPA could not fill in.  Never the less a good impression for me from Stone as this is my first offering from them, and I look forward to some of their others."

If you haven't had it in a while, do yourself a favor and get some of this arrogant bastard between your lips ASAP."

"An excellent, tasty, full-throated and well-balanced brew that I find rather approachable despite the klitchy marketing hyperbole. Overall, I thought the hop flavors were kept within bounds and the brew possessed a balance that perhaps was lacking one or two previous samplings. I bought the bomber for $4.79, which was marked down about a dollar, and a very good deal."

"Poured a nice brown color with a quarter inch creamy head. Malty flavor with a good hop hit, but not overly bitter. Very balanced and easy drinking.

"The blurb on the back of this beer is definitely worthy of its title, cautioning the prospective drinker of the power that this beer backs. My comments strong, dark twisted flavour, very hoppy, with a spicy aftertaste. I think this beer is an ideal example of the Californian search for a hop texture in beer. Although not an IPA this beer boasts enough to join the ranks of that style."

"This beer has a nice color and good foam. It has attitude. But I don't know if it wants to be an IPA or a Stout. It has pronounced hops that gets overwhelmed by strong toasted, almost burnt, malt. It leaves a lingering aftertaste that definitely reminds me of a strong stout (not that mother's milk Guinness but more like Bell's Expedition Stout). I know it's not a Stout but the taste and aftertaste sure reminds me of one. It has a decent taste going down, a lot of flavor, not for your Lite drinkers. While there is a lot of taste in every sip, I have had better tasting brew. I was given 3 bottles of this Bastard, I'll finish them but I'm not sure I'll be buying it. At 7.2 abv, this is no slouch."

"I love this beer, from the writing on the back of the bottle to the taste and everything in between. The color is reddish orange with a thick white head that leaves trails down the glass. The smell was mostly slightly sweet with a little bit of hop but very understated, The taste is great with simple hop bitter notes in the beginning leading to semi sweet malt and almost a coffee/tobacco aftertaste. Absolutely loved it and would definitely recommend."

"Overall this brew is great. However is it just me, or is this brew a stone's throw away from a red/amber IPA? It's hoppy with a citrus piney knockout. great american strong red ale. I would buy this again. For something in between an IPA and a American ale this fits the build just right. I love how the bottle says ""you're not worthy"" and this is an aggressive beer ""you probably wont like"". I like it, and it's great for those in between nights."
"Put this beer up to the light and be amazed at how blood-red it appears. . . Has a lush dark look away from the light. The biggest knock against it is the beer lacks any real aroma. For what it lacks in smell though, it does a bang up job with the flavor profile. So crisp and malty up front that you don't really even notice the bitter bite till a few seconds later on the back of your pallet. For its price and how main stream it is, a very nice go-to. . ."

"Overall- I actually found this pleasant and not as wildly strong as I thought it would be. Maybe this was because the funny label and crazy bragging on the back of the bottle caused me to think this would be wicked strong, oh and the name. Read the label on the back though, it is funny. This is a very smooth beer and really is not a hop explosion, when compared to most IPA's. Not near as strong as Stone's Sublimely Self Righteous Ale (their black ale). That is because it is not an IPA, so it is much more malty. Nice and complex beer. Try it if you're worthy haha."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is just the picture of a balanced american strong ale. Highly hopped with IPA quality hop flavor, but an amped up malt character that has a unique flavor profile I have never had in another beer. This is a great, if not the best, example of the american strong ale style that I have had yet. I have probably over-rated this compared to my BA peers, but to me, overall this is perfect."

"Pours cranberry juice red with a pillowy two-finger head that retains well. It smells like piney hops but with a huge malt presence: I get brown sugar, toasted oats, and some dark fruit notes. It has a bitter pine needle taste from the beginning of the tongue until the end and leaves the back of the throat tingling. Alongside the hoppy flavors, there's a caramel malt with hints of indistinct dark fruits.There's a dichotomy in this beer and the hoppy characteristics don't work well with the malty ones. Mouthfeel is medium with medium carbonation."

"Poured a deep amber color with a big pillowy head. This is a very good looking beer. The head is exclellent and the color of deep redish amber is beautiful. Its listed as a ""American Stong Ale", but this beer is pretty unique in its own right. For me, its hard to classify. An amber ale with a lot more hops and more of a biscuty, malty taste to it with the lingering aftertaste of booze...that would be a start but it still doesnt do it justice. Its pretty damn complex. Its really delicious. A very heavy brew, I could only drink a pint of this personally, but its a very very tasty pint. Purchased at 7-11 in San Diego. Tells you something about the SD beer scene if the 7'11's are stocking these bad boys :)"

"I confess I don't get this beer -- the hops are too one-dimensional for it to be a hop monster, and there's not enough fruit in here to make this a really good strong ale. What you end up with, actually, is something like an overhopped American Pale Ale -- not exactly bad or undrinkable, but certainly nothing all that amazing, either."

"Bomber into tulip. Im happy that with all the hype surrounding this beer, it did not fail to live up. Darker than most beers I drink, I was put off at first, but soon grew to like it. The most interesting aspect to me was the head of the beer, being a tan/khaki, almost light brown color, really cool. I also love the attitude displayed by Stone. They brew beer for people like me, who think that opinions are fact, cuz when youre right, youre just right."

"This beer ROCKS and I also love the name! It is my currently my favorite beer. I like it even more than Founders Breakfast Stout or Santa Fe Imperial Java Stout which I love dearly. Great flavors, aftertaste, you name it. I'd love to purchase a six pack but have yet to find it in anything other than a bomber. If something in the Universe didn't line up quite right and I could have only one beer to drink, forever more, Arrogant Bastard Ale would be my pick."

"An outstanding beer! Poured from a bottle into a glass. This beer had a lovely caramel appearance and a nice head. The beer had a nice fruity aroma and what I would describe as a strong grapefriuty flavor. Very enjoyable stuff and justifiably arrogant!"

"This beer has a rich taste that is comparable to none. It has a dark amber appearance, and a deliciousness that demands your attention. Regardless of your beer drinking preference, you will enjoy this beer. Unless of course, Budweiser and Yuengling are your chart toppers, in which case, you wouldn't even be on this website to begin with, because your palate would be anything but educated. This is no time to be humble. There is no pride before the fall at Stone Brewery. Only the pride in knowing that if you try this beer, they have again broadened someone else's horizons. You don't have to sell your soul to the devil, but you should give your beer money to the Stone Brewery Gargoyle."

"Pours of a caramel color and strong notes of hops, grapefruit and what I would consider zest. From start to finish this says Stone Brewery. About an inch and 1/2 head that sticks around for most of the entire time you are drinking it. I tried it chilled rather then really cold and noticed the some of the flavors were getting lost drinking this beer to cold. Overall this is my go to beer when I go out and pairs perfectly with a good meaty cheeseburger."

"O: An excellent American Strong Ale. Because the characteristics for this style are so wide of a range, it absolutely fits the style even though the ABV is on the low end of the scale. A excellent ale. Near perfect. I love it. This beer has the right to call itself Arrogant Bastard in my humble opinion."

"Poured a rich, transparent reddish brown with a half-finger off-white head, receding to an off-white ring leaving some lacing at the top of the glass. Rich, gorgeous color but a little low on the head. Scents of caramel, toffee, some brown sugar, more prominent as the beer warms, light grapefruit and other citrus, fruity esters, a hit of alcohol and a bit of toasted malt. Quite nice, but not near as hop forward as I expected, more malt and alcohol. Flavor begins quite bitter, with far more hop character than the aroma betrays. Hop character is mostly pine resin, but with some citrus peel bitterness. High hop bitterness is balanced by a malt backbone with caramel and toasted malt flavors. Towards the middle and end of the sip there is a bit of brown sugar appearing alongside the other flavors and some flavors of alcohol. Alcohol becomes more prominent as the beer warms. Aftertaste is bitter, with some grainy and toasted flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly sticky and semi-drying with low carbonation. Very easy to drink, maybe a little light bodied. Overall a good, fairly complex strong ale. The hop bitterness is very high balancing the sweet malt flavors. Pretty good, however I prefer Double Bastard."

"O: Not a bad brew. I've had it before a while ago, but I'm just now reviewing it for my own keep sake. Arrogant Bastard Ale has a monster flavor. It's good to try at least once. If you're looking for a strong beer then definitely go with this one."
""
""
"It's a well crafted west coast style IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, if you're a fan of the so-called 'East Coast IPA', which experience has lead me to believe is any sort of IPA that has enough malts to balance the hoppiness, you're likely to enjoy this brew. Fortunately, Stone has a wide-ranging distribution, and most of the Continental United States (Gawd Bless Amurikuh!) can enjoy this enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Apart from that, I can't fault it :-)"
""
""
"From my tasting notes: With my first taste my initial thought was “what the hell?” It had a very off-putting bitterness that was not necessarily an intense hoppiness like an IIPA and it was surprising. The label states “It is quite doubtful that you have the taste of sophistication to appreciate an ale of this quality and depth,” and I was beginning to believe them! I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. I finished the first glass and slowly poured the rest of the bottle with growing dread. By now the beer had begun to warm a bit as I left it out of the refrigerator. As it warmed, Arrogant Bastard took on a much smoother more balanced taste as the malts began to balance out the hop bitterness with a more roasty almost toffee flavor. I easily finished glass #2 and completely erased my earlier disappointment. This is definitely an aggressive and sophisticated beer as the label suggests, and a very good, highly recommended introduction to Stone. Just let it warm a little first."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's almost aggravating how good Stone is because I constantly tell myself that their brews can't be all they're built up to be, but I'm always wrong, and Arrogant Bastard is no exception to that scenario. This one is every bit as refined and complex as Stone states in their arrogance. It's certainly not for the faint of heart and if you've got the balls to handle it, it's a must-try."

" Arrogant Bastard Ale was a gorgeous reddish brown color. It has a thick, rocky, beige colored head with excellent retention and lacing. The smell was mainly piney hops with some sweet malt. The taste was piney hops and sweet caramel malt with balancing bitterness. The finish was long, hoppy and bitter. The mouthfeel was good with a medium-full body and medium body. Overall this is a very good, hoppy beer, and should be tried by any hop-lovers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - a hop forward standard for the style. I will now seek out Double Bastard and Oaked."
""
""
""
""
""
"Draft poured into a pint Pilsner. It has a 1/8"" head which dissolves quickly, then lovely lacing down the glass. Medium brown in color, unfiltered. Aroma is hops and caramel. Flavor is hops, malt, well-balanced and very pleasing, with a bit of pine. Medium mouth feel. Overall an outstanding ale."
""
""
"This is one of my favorite beers.  It pours deep brown with a small head. Just enough to hold the rim of the glass while you drink.  It has a strong flavor with some coffee notes.  It is heavy and not for the timid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- a big flavored, hop-forward ale with great flavors across the board"
""
""
""
"O - This beer has both surprised and spoiled me. Less hoppy than an IPA, which I like as I tend to find IPAs too hoppy, but still a strong flavor. I've only had a few bottles, but it's already one of my favorites. If I'm sampling several different beers, I try to stick AB towards the end, as many beers seem mild compared to ABs...arrogance, for lack of a better term. I'll admit, I may be new to the whole beer review thing, but even I can tell where Stone was going with this."

"I see now why they call it Arrogant Bastard and why most of us won't ""enjoy"" this beer. Its because its nothing special, its an okay beer, nothing more."
""
""
""
""
"I usually like wheats and Pilsners with my food but this is an exception. Most of all if spicey food is on the menu. This is a wonderful Ale. Im sipping it and the taste is going up thru my nasal passages from my mouth. Im increasing my rating on it."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Really nice hoppy strong ale. It's not quite an IPA, not qutie an amber, something in between. Really nice hop flavor and malt flavor. Both are strong and balanced, but sharp at the same time. I'll have to get a little fresher version of this sometime, might be on the edge of starting to fade, hop-wise. Or maybe this is just really balanced."

"Appearance as poured into a 20 oz pint glass is stunning; a khaki head of foam that does not fall after nearly 5 minutes of sitting, a reddish brown color with absolute clarity that appears almost blood red when held to the light. Smell is very potent and powerful with equal part resiny, herbal hops and dark malts; dried fruit, prunes, leather, botanicals, pine and resin. The taste is bitter, dark and satisfying with a burnt sugar, caramel, toast, roasted cereal grains and black coffee, offset by earthy and resinous hop character, ending astringent and slightly drying. It sits heavily in the mouth, coating; medium carbonation that is completely fitting. This beer is good to the last drop, a combination of IPA, amber ale and Imperial stout in my opinion. It's a classic that has stood the test of time and one that I come back to over and over again."

"As usual, Stone have created a quality brew. While I would not agree that this is a world class brew, I would definitely agree that this is an outstanding brew. The brew's strongpoint being its nice balanced aroma of fine malts and an amazing pour. The brew is very strong, pungent and acidic in a good way and leaves a great aftertaste that sticks for a while. A very worthy brew and as always, many thanks to Stone, who are easily one of the better American breweries."

"I've only recently been introduced to The Stone Brewing Company. That said, from the very first sip I knew I was not a typical brew. It wasn't even a typical craft brew. My initial response to a Stone Brewing Company product was ""Wow, I think this might be the best beer I've ever tasted!"". That was the Stone IPA. This is my first try of Arrogant Bastard Ale and after my taste buds stopped screaming ""Uncle!", my response was ""Ahh, Seven Hells, that's good!!"". The first thing that caught my attention was smell. I knew then that Fate, that sultry mistress with the warm hand and sensible footwear had pushed us together and I was truly in for a treat. The rich head on this beer is the equivalent of a steak dinner at the Buckhorn Exchange. Once the beer hits your tongue it's like a cacophony of flavors. It takes your mind a few seconds to catch up with it. This beer is almost too good. I finished feeling like I had done something elicit, you know, like after you just get done watching a bunch of midget porn, it might be a little messed up but your completely sated."

"O: A very solid beer. I enjoy it, but I wouldn't drink a lot of it. Like Campari or some other bitter amaro, an occasional glass to sip is a fantastic break from the normal. However, it wouldn't be my go to on a regular basis. Definitely worth trying, though."

""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Like a stronger, slightly less flavorful, highly carbonated porter. Well done, but not an ale that particularly peaks my interest. I was expecting more, due to its popularity. If I wanted this level of bitterness, I would go with an IPA."

""

"O: A balanced, refined and STRONG ale that really challenges you. In-your-face, never-gonna-stop attitude with a few different flavors & scents that come together nicely and keep it interesting. Intensely eloquent."
"Growing up in San Diego and going to Cal State San Marcos, Stone has been a staple in my life. There once was a time back in my freshman year of college (2002) when I was not worthy. My Fraternity insisted on kegs of arrogant bastard and my palate was not adept to the wonderfulness that is this beer. These days all I got to say is damn I love this beer. Over the past decade I have always looked forward the to malty, burned sugar, and hoppy nose. The color is a fantastic deep red. The flavor is plenty malty, with nice caramel tones, and a nice strong bitterness. Think a Doppelbock DIPA. It's rad! The mouthfeel is a little over carbonated but I won't dock them any points for that. Give it a try!"
"Different taste but really good. The more I taste it the better it tastes. I don't know if not having their name on the label is a gimmick but I think I would tell everyone about how good this beer tastes. This company has been very consistent with quality."
""
""
""
""
""
"My pour created just over a finger of dense, foamy, tawny head that sat atop the beer in arrogant defiance of my desire to begin drinking. Color was a garnet-red with NE-quality clarity. Nose was ticklish with its inherent heat along with a toffee-like sweetness. I felt as though I might sneeze for a moment. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full and the heat of the alcohol felt as though it were evaporating on my tongue. I may not be worthy of this beer! Getting past that, I began to take in flavors of anise; dried, dark fruit; caramel/toffee and an odd mintiness. Finish was dry, to the point that it was making me sweat and tear up involuntarily. I could only bow in deference to its glorious intensity. Make sure that you know what you are getting into if you open a bottle of Bastard!"

"It pours a mahogany red. Deep like good wood. Clear. Not as much head as I thought it should have and not much retention down to a thin cap and even that disappeared. Smell is sweet caramel malt and hops bitterness. Because I wanted to try it so much I just dove right in. Lacing nicely and up front is full on hops. The citrus becomes more evident on the nose and in the finish. Nice long finish, medium carbonation and medium body. You would think to look at this beer that it would be heavy but it’s surprisingly light. It’s fully loaded with hops and strong malt backbone realizing a rich deep flavor that is not complex but rather assertive and in your face arrogant."
""
""
""
""

"I definitely prefer the Oaked version of the beer because the characteristics match so well with the oak. However, this is still quite good. This beer really does attack you with hops and bitterness. Not recommended for not those into bitter beers."

"O: I am real disappointed in this one. I thought that I'd had this one before and enjoyed it; I remember enjoying the Oaked Arrogant Bastard. But this particular example - not doing it for me. Malty and boozy, and not in a good way. EDIT: Reading some other reviews, I'm wondering if this was old or just a bad batch. I got almost no hop flavors/bitterness, let alone aroma. Guess I'll really have to try it again and see if it's better the next time around. Will update review if it changes significantly."

"Overall: Hot damn! I am worthy you bastards! I absolutely love this beer. Perfect unbalance of hops and malt. Heavy but not too heavy, could drink this all day but this will ruin a palate far more than ruination. Read the back story, what a fantasic mistake! Parts of this beer arent perfect but as a whole this beer cant get any better. Perfection. Enthusiastic 5!!"

"This is one of the best ways to get piss drunk. This is a tasty, bold ale that fills your mouth with hops and malt. Good lacing beautiful soft foam that lets you know the combination won't be too harsh. Enjoyed at Atlantic Beer Company in Boston. I'd heard a lot of hype about this beer, and it absolutely lived up to expectations."

"A strong, beefy ale with IPA-like flavor components, Arrogant Bastard slots nicely into the Stone lineup of aggressively hopped beers."

"O: love stone. this one is a little deeper and darker than their ipas. complex malts. not particularly refreshing, but i think it follows through on its intention. bold brew for bold nights."
"The beer is a dark, ruby-ish color. A very nice little head on it with super sexy lacing... a very pretty looking beer, for sure. Arrogant Bastard has a taste not quite like beers I've had before... there's some bitterness in there, for sure, but it's not as intense as it seems a lot of people like to describe it. The hops in this beer mixed with the malts balance it perfectly. I've had some people try and tell me it tastes/feels ""soapy", but I don't get that at ALL ... maybe that's because I had it on-tap. The taste is complex to the point where I can't pinpoint exactly how I remember it being, but it was interesting, and it was super tasty... a seemingly wild blend of hops and malt, and I couldn't get quite enough of my sample. Crazy drinkable, tasty beer."
""
"Taste is nice, pungent hops, intense compared to most American ales."
""
""
""
"An exceptional beer and one that did not disappoint in any way, shape or form upon first trying it. The beer was insanely hoppy with lots of bitterness. Surprisingly easy to drink and went down well with the mouthfeel complimented the taste and smell quite well. A must try."

"Overall, this is one in your face beer. SNPA made me realize that there are beers with a lot more flavor than what society would lead you to think. This was the beer that made me realize that beers could blow the roof off of your palate. My palate has tamed this beast since then, but I still find this to be a great beer to keep on hand at all times."

"Overall: This ale needn't the arrogance it flaunts on its bottle (although this undeniably adds to its character) as its deep hop aromas and aggressive bitterness give it its well-deserved status as one of the finest examples of American craft beer brilliance. The bottle claims that ""[we're] not worthy"" of drinking it, and perhaps it's right; any ale with as much character as this would have even the most seasoned beer buff worshipping it religiously."

"A reasonable buy at $5 for the bomber, but there is a sort of rich heaviness to it that wasn't inviting me back for another sip. Worth a try? Why the hell not, but fans of tart cloudy IPAs are not likely to be back for a second helping."

"This is a stong beer it might be a little expensive but worth it. has a strong smell and taste might be kinda bitter at first but once you pallet adjusts you won't be able to drink anthing else for the rest of the night. I highly recomend this beer with some good pizza or fryed chicken..enjoy"

"O: A great, got to, aggressively hopped beer that drinks like a fresh Americanized version of an Old Ale. This beer could hold it's own when paired with a spicy owing to how strong the flavors are or the bitterness could easily cut through a rich fatty dish. I'd enjoy this with pot roast of beef stew myself."

"O - When first I had this beer years ago, as the bottle itself states, I was not worthy. Truly, casuals will find little to enjoy from this one as it certainly isn't for the uninitiated! Now, I'm proud to count myself among the highest echelon of drinkers: those who this beer was made for. Arrogance achieved."

"O: I really like this beer, very balanced, and in my opinion the best offering from stone."
"O - Great, simple beer. I think this is obviously world-class and its price is more than reasonable. Doesn't get much better than this."
"O: A staple beer, everyone should have at least one. Would have liked a bit more from aroma. The fact that everything is set on high, but still balanced, is impressive."

"It pours an beige-necked amber, with a very well retained neck. Beautiful. The aroma emanates grassy American hops, but I also noticed a background caramelized malt, which makes it very pleasing too. The taste, well-carbonated, medium-bodied, brings again the very characteristic American hops, and the slightly sweetish, caramelized malt. It is super refreshing, with the alcohol very fitting to the other features of the beer. In the end, we have a strong presence of hops. Excellent!"
"O: Probably an acquired taste. I live in SD, so me and Stone are bffs. That said, while I think everyone should try this beer, I don't expect everyone to love it immediately. It takes some time before the gargoyle gets you."

"overall, this is a nice refresher. the clear brownish-red says coke in the head, and the tongue says refreshing. but not coke. easy to drink and i like the abv. relatively simple taste, and straight-forward."
"Honestly, when I first tried this beer, I thought I wasn't ""worthy."" It wasn't until the second time I had it I realized how truly amazing this ale actually is. At first I was sort of off put by the sheer bitterness that this beer has, but after overcoming that aspect, I absolutely fell in love. With an IBU that's said to be over 100 (Stone says the real IBU is ""classified"") it can be quite intimidating, especially after reading the blurb on the back of the bottle. That said, I am just blown away by how good this is. It pours a beautiful darkish red color with a bone white head. The pine and sting of the hops is immediately noticeable as you pour. Even more noticeable as you drink with a hint of sweetness behind it along with malt and a bit of roast as well. The mouth is surprisingly smooth with low carbonation. It almost clings to your taste buds, leaving you with a lingering bitterness. This is quite a special and unique ale. I'm glad to say that I'm from the same city where this beast was conceived. I just bought a four pack of the Oaked ABA and eagerly await to try it. Review will follow."
""
""
""
"Overall: damned delicious! Smooth and deep in complex flavor, and well balanced. Sticks to the tongue, but not enough to be too sticky."

"Overall: I kinda had a high expectation for this beer. One thing I really like was the malts in this beer. It's an interesting combination with the heavy hops. Definitely worth a try."

"O- This stuff is a marvel of modern craft beer. Imitated, but certainly never duplicated."
"Price Point - $4.99/22 oz bomber"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A quite tasty brew. It’s on the hoppier side, but balanced quite nicely by the sweeter fruit, caramel, and more malty flavors of the brew. Its well know for a good reason; its quite a good moderate strength IPA."
"O: Even if I hated this beer I would give it points for the monologue on the bottle. In fact this is an excellent beer that may become one of my go-to's."

"Poured a dark amber color with a four finger tan colored head that lingered for quite a while. The head recessed with beautiful mounds leaving a medium tracing behind. Had a light aroma that gave to a surprisingly strong hop taste that left a medium amount of bitterness on the palate. Mouth feel was medium with an almost light chewiness to it, all together I found it to be a delightful beer for any afternoon."

"Poured entire bomber into 34oz mug; dark, slightly cloudy orange with a thick white head that sticks around with some great lacing. Smells flowery and hoppy like an IPA, although with a bit thicker malt backbone. Taste follows nose exactly; sweet thick and malty at first, and bitter and hoppy to finish. Mouthfeel is medium, not too full or fizzy. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – No idea what to expect. Lots of coffee and bitter chocolate, as well as nice dry floral hops. Nice, truly unique beer."

"The notorious beer that invented the ""American Strong Ale"" category and also introduced a whole lot of people to the true art of craft beer. While this certainly isn't the best American Strong Ale I've had, (Stone's Lucky Bastard takes that honer, which is actually a blend of all 3 Arrogant Bastard variants) this is a landmark beer that can be enjoy both by the craft beer neophyte and the most seasoned craft beer enthusiast. Highly recommend."

"i am not the biggest ale fan...until now. this ale is a wonderful blend of hoppy, bitter, and full body greatness...with a slight trace of an exotic spice from some small tribal community in southern Iran that i've never heard of. At first the inexperienced drinker may find this beer a bit vulgar, cocky and downright mean...but as the offensive posturing of this beer starts to mellow down and slides smoothly down your throat, you will find yourself begging for yet another fake beating. by the fourth gulp, you will be writing love notes."
"Overall - One of the the best beers I have ever had, and I've drank quite a bit of beer in my day. Warm or cold, this beer is outstanding. I was taken aback by the beer that poured like a brown or amber ale, smelled like an IPA, and tasted like, well, nothing I've ever really had. It is a true conglomeration of styles. A hybrid of styles, done absolutely correctly. If you haven't had this brew, you need to get it."

"Pours reddish with soft head. Aroma is bready biscuits, caramel, assertive pine hops. Taste has nice caramel and booze flavor, with a pine bitter crisp finish to balance things out. A complex and strong beer, dry, and assertive. Medium slick palate, medium carbonation. Very nice."
""
""
""
""
""

"This is a fun one. AB introduced me to the craft beer world. I knew little about it all. The color is a gorgeous amber brown. the smell is of nothing but earthy hops and booze. The taste follows the nose...super bitter upon a canvas of earthy notes that are centered in this American Strong ale. It is a decent jump-off point and is always fun to revisit but the Arrogant Bastard is nothing more than a well-labeled, over-marketed beer beast. I guess I'm not worthy"
"This is by far one of my favorite all time beers. The strength and fortitude of the hoppy full flavor makes this a perfect beer. It's no wonder that multiple variations have been and are attempted based on this beer. Pretty much all of those are excellent too. You can't go wrong with Stone!"
""

"O: thank god that the store I bought this at has a couple other Stone beers. This was definitely a 'trial by fire' beer and I believe I passed the test. A great purchase."
""
""
""
"Excellent beer! You have to have a taste for a stronger tasting beer to enjoy this one. Poured a darker brown color. Taste is hoppy, barley like. Not bad at all and will get again. I personally like a hoppy taste. I would say that it is just under the taste of an IPA. It also had about an index finger width worth of head on it that was tannish in color."

"The taste was a big shock to me as it wasn't nearly as hoppy and bitter as it smelled. It does have the grapefruit hoppy taste of a pale ale, but it's not overpowering which is what I was afraid of. Honestly I'm a stout man, and I bought and drank this as a promise to a friend. I am truly glad that I did. This is a fantastic beer...and I will definately be buying more of it."

"This is one of my favorite bottled beers. Considering some of its qualifying competitors come from the same company, you can't go too wrong with any Stone beer. Delightful mouth feel, superb flavor and tremendous overall quality. A bit pricey, but worth the splurge. Try it. It might become your favorite beer. If you like something a bit hoppier, try the IPAs from Stone. Seriously, a brewery we can only hope is around to stay."

"Pours brown with some reddish hues when held to a light, great frothy beige head holds good retention & leaves excellent lacing all over the glass as the head dissipates. Nose is fresh piny hops, grapefruit, sweet caramel malt, bready, pungent. Tastes are definitely bold with pungent, piny, grapefruity hops, bitter up-front, sweetness comes through as bready malt and heavy caramel, almost burnt. Slight earthiness, but the pine rides out the finish and lingers. Medium body, creamy, nice carbonation. Overall, always a favorite of mine & nice to come back to after waiting too long to pick one up!"

"Overall what can I say. Perhaps that perspective is a good thing. As one who “came of age” in the 50’s/60’s, and eagerly sampled the readily available US beers of that period, this beer makes me very happy. Those who have “come of age” since the 1980’s cannot fully appreciate the dramatic difference between the readily available beers I naively quaffed in my 20’s and 30’s and what is available today. And breweries like Stone are the leaders in providing such a drastic difference between then and now. They are paving the future of beer by expanding the envelope beyond what we so eagerly enjoy today."

"Pours a dark brown ruby with a finger of caramel tinged foam. Moderate carbonation with good lacing and retention. Aroma of hops, caramel, some citrus, toffee, a bit of alcohol and some sugar with a good sweet malty back. Taste of spicy hop, caramel malts, and some butterscotch. Sweet malts come through with a strong finish tying the beer together. Mouth is full bodied, good carbonation with a nice sticky finish. Overall a great beer worthy of the hype and arrogance"

"O - A great beer for seasoned craft drinkers. Heavily recommended to hop heads who want more than another IPA. All around flavorful and satisfying beer. I personally feel that Stone has better beers out there, but this one has plenty of merit, and stands above most beers as a truly strong ale."
"O: An excellent beer. All the complexities I would expect from Stone. The beer opens up more and more as it warms. Like a story begging to be told. Very well-balanced."

"Overall this beer is a solid ale. 7.2% ABV is masked well by the sweetness of the brew but you can still taste the alcohol in the beer. Worth a try, even though some reviewers find the beer difficult to finish."

"Taste like asprin... effin hate it so much.. yuck! I had that taste on the tip of my tounge that was numbing. I thought it would be awesome without that nasty taste. Its however smooth.. If they change that taste I would engage another drink. Its not horrible but maybe you should buy 1 22oz. and try it out... who knows you might like it. It also was like 4 dollars at a store in Portland oregon."

"I'm sure most people will disagree with me, but I had to pour out most of this pint. The head hadn't even dissipated before my stomach started to hurt. I'm not sure if my stomach just didn't like one of the ingredients, or if the hops were just too strong for my stomach. All I know is I couldn't finish it."

"This is an excellent example of the American strong ale, and borders on an IPA in my opinion. Complex, tasty, and balanced. Must try"

"O: The Arrogant Bastard of the Stone Brewery line really does everything from sweet, complex malt to aggressive hopping. One of the Stone brews that really showcases both strength and depth of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It has been to long since my last go at the classic Bastard. This beer is a deep amber color and is extremely hazy. The head is slightly off white and really doesnt stick around too long. The nose is mostly pine, herbal and floral hops. The taste of this beer starts out with a high bitterness and an intense hop profile. There is a ton of grassy, herbal, spicy notes and a lot of pine and some lemon zest. The beer has a ton of mouth feel and helps to deliver the beers flavors. The other flavors of the beer are toffee, caramel and bread yeast. This is a classic go to beer, best fresh in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smells of piney / citrus hopping combined with toasted / caramel malts in aggressive quantities. Gains a touch of cherry aroma as it warms up. Flavor follows suit, but also has a woody and brash herbal hopping aspect that creeps up on you. It is slightly out of balance in favor of the hops (on purpose) but that's sort of the target they were aiming for. For me, this feels like a nice return to aggressive beers that comforts me whenever I'm in the mood for something 'aggressive yet not completely over the top crazy""."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer contains a solid amount of malt flavor as well as hop flavor and does an incredibly nice job of balancing the two in near perfect harmony - one of the hardest tasks when making beer. This is a beer that I have had many times, and I'm sure many more times to come."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Stone never disappoints me. The reputation of Arrogant Bastard and their whole line up is well deserved. A great beer that separates the men from the boys (well the macro drinkers from the craft beer consumers at least). Would I drink it again? Yes."
""
""
""
""

"O - I'm not sure how many more times I'll get this one, but it was certainly a good offering. I'd love to try it on tap."

""
"There is nothing quite like Arrogant Bastard. I love that descriptors for the beer ended with ""you probably won't like it."" This might be true, though, for the uninitiated. It's quite a bitch slap on your tongue. Strong Ale is the best way to describe it. It's just so strong on your tongue - bitter and complex. I honestly can't pick apart the pieces that make up this beer. The malt and hops work together seemlessly for a balanced taste. I've never tasted sweetness in this beer, though, which some have noted in their reviews. As it warms it is a little smoother, but sweet is an adjective I reserve for the Double Bastard."

"O - Not groundbreaking. All the marketing (You're not worthy!) aside, its somewhat of a staple to the craft beer world. Kind of a stepping stone past SNPA and Boston Lager. Its a damn tasty hopped up beer with a great malt backbone and it doesn't have to be super fresh to be enjoyed either. I've always been a fan of this beer and will continue to pick up a bomber from time to time."
""
""
""
"I've had this beer quite a few times.... Mostly, because I like it so much.... As I pour a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass, it develops an average inch head.... The appearance is beautiful of that of a dark cherry color.... The smell also has hints of cherry with woodsy notes, as well.... The taste of the beer also has woodsy and cherry notes.... I especialy love the lingering aftertaste and feeling this beer leaves on the palate.... Overall, I love this beer.... I'd recommend it to everyone."

"Stone Brewery Arrogant Bastard (2013) - Thick creamy head. Excellent lacing. Brillant black body with red hues under heavy light. No carbonation. The bubbles hang stagnant. It's thick. A full mouthfeel. Malt bread aroma. Chocolate and caramel wafting. Coffee and toffee front taste. Coffee, bread, and caramel. Stout, hops highlight, bitters and sours, spicing... fades to porter coffee and expresso. No alcohol. 7.6% ABV... not noticeable in the mouth. Warming the gut and the head. Crisp aftertaste. Lingering hops, citrus note appears, sour brillance, and then warming continues. In the mouth. In the throat. More hops. More coffee. More chocolate and light lemon. Strong. Powerful. Brillant. A serious beer for a serious beer connoisseur. I will not hesitate to tell you... aside from the special editions of this brew (Oaked, Anniversary, etc...) this is the best beer in the world. Simply more art than science. Simply perfect. 5 out of 5."

"This beer has a very aggressive taste. As I said, this is a mans beer. Very hoppy and full of flavor. A nice mix of fruits, spice, and outdoorsy flavor. This would make a great tailgate beer in this fall. Try this beer ad you won't be dissapointed. Another hit from Stone"

"I suppose this is the beer that got my into good beer. It was described as my favorite for a long time. Rudy reddish brown with a coffee ice cream colored head, light tan I suppose. Plenty of lacing. Large aromas of grapefruit, piney, resinous, and a hint of cacao. Packed with hoppy goodness, but balanced by a big ol' malt bill. Flavor follows nose closely. Grapefruit, sticky tree sap resin, clean yeast flavor, a bit of cacao. The hops are well rounded out by the size of this beer. Not a complex beer. Pretty full bodied and thick beer. An iconic beer."
""
""
""
""
"Pours brown with an orange hue. There is a finger of head that enjoys some retention and leaves a nice layer of lacing on the glass. The nose is distinctly piney. The upfront flavors are malt and bread and there is a terrific hop bite on the finish. There is a touch of alcohol present, but nothing unpleasant. This beer is simple hearty goodness."

"On a cold tap in a chilled glass so not ideal for flavor profiling, but still this beer rocks. From just the looks of it this beer is the standard to measure others by. Dark amber with a hint of ruby. Full ivory head and excellent lacing. Smells of caramel and other darker malts. Ample hops are present but are extremely well balanced by the malt. Not too strong yet not soft. Near perfection."

"In the last couple of years my respect for Stone has remained at a very high level, yet my interest in this particular icon of a beer has dropped. It's just too earthy with a uniquely dry, yet oddly medicinal, lingering bitterness. Score reduced from a 4.03 (8/16/12)."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a dark ruby red with a tan two finger head. Left a massive amount of lacing everywhere. Smells of very dark grains, roasted malt and burtn toast. The up front is a large amount of burnt bread along with burnt malt. Another drink adds a whiskey like charcoal hit into the mix, along with a large smoky flavor. The mouthfeel makes this beer seem just like a scotch ale. Keeps all of the mentioned flavors but adds a MASSIVE punch of smokeyness to the finish. Overall, this is a big, flavorful beer, and as the lable states, it is not for snivling yellow beer drinking wimps. Though it didn't appeal to my particular taste"

"I was honestly very surprised how much I liked this beer. I've heard many things about it and so I was hesitant if I'd like it or not. But it really was good. The color was a dark brown almost orangy. The aroma had nice fruity and piney notes, more citrus than anything else. The taste was what really made it unique though, it had the strong hop character similar to the aroma, but was backed up perfecty by strong malts. This was a big beer, big hops, big malts, big alcohol and it all balanced each other out and worked very well."
"Overall this beer was enoyable to sip while driving down slice after slice of my favorite pizza. After my pizza was gone, I had a difficult time finishing the beer. The beer completely warps your sense of what beer can be. Perhaps the label is correct, I'm not worthy."
""
""
""

""
"The thick head and carbonation also serve as a nice buffer. Enjoy with care, you can never just have one..."
""
"Great clear copper brown color with very ample head after agresive pour. Dense lacing of the glass. Not getting a huge hop scent, mostly wheat and light citrus. caramel, pine, good carbination, lingering hops. This is a pretty decent beer that is not difficult to find."

"Given the 2k plus reviews - there is not much more one can say about this beer. It's drinkable, flavorful, and an absolute ground breaker. Craft beer owes a lot to this brew. And for us ad guy types hardly any one does that side of the equation better. All beer lovers should doff their caps."

"O: this completes my ""Bastard"" circuit - all three of the Stone Bastard ales are great beers - and this one is the core of the line: a harmony of malts and hops, tons of flavor and character"

"Beer is medium to medium-heavy bodied, with mid-level carbonation that is able to create a somewhat foamy, smooth mouthfeel. Closes out expectedly dry."

"Overall, a nice sipper, for sure. I'm not really familiar with the style, so this didn't strike any emotion in me. If I were drinking this on my deck in 65 degree Autumn weather, I might rejoice. But it's 106 outside, and I'm in my basement."
""
"Review from 8/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark red amber with a thick, long lasting off white head with nice lacing. Dark malts, dark fruit, pine and citrus hops finishing with a nice lingering pine hop finish. Medium bodied and tasty. A very nice ale. I am not worthy."

"Arrogant Bastard, in my opinion, is the opitome of Southern California IPA's. I often find that the common denominator of many SoCal brews is very mineral-esque and super bitter, but lacking in the citrusy, sweet Norcal Hop department. Arrogant bastard was definitely one of the first brews that got me into craft brews, and I think it was more striking, more intense the first time I had it a long time ago. It's definitely an interesting beer, and definitely worth a try for anyone who appreciates the aggressive nature of the California strong ale (CAIPAFTW!)"
""
""
"A decent amount of carbonation helps bring all the flavors to the foreground and the medium-heavy body gives this beer an almost IIPA-type of experience to the drinker. Overall, this is an excellent beer and an excellent value. I couldn't see myself going to this often, but I can see myself choosing this beer time and time again. Great stuff."

"Feels slick and sweet, and that sweetness lingers for a while. Drinks well for the ABV, even considering the full body."

"I think STONE is one of the finest breweries to come out of America PERIOD; all their Ipa servings are the beers to be judged against and their belgium/ipa is the tops. They have two beers that I can't figure out if people are on something when they drink them because they are just,,,argghh (cough, gag, cough, disgust) SICKENING and I think they must be a joke from the brewmaster. This is a wast of money and DISGUSTING. Horrid, I would drink a Bud light any day over this."

"Bomber, poured in a shaker. Pours a deep, dark amber color with some definite ruby-red shining through. Small bubbles race up to a large, frothy head of about 3cm of beige. The head lingers and leaves thick lacing on the glass; a thin film of head remains throughout and leaves a ring to the bottom of the glass. I love the nose of this beer. The hops are by far the dominant force with bright citrusy smells of grapefruit and maybe a touch of orange along with resiny pine. There right behind it, is a backbone of caramel malt, very sweet and definitely very present. I loved taking deep wafts of this one. The taste was hops forward; more citrus and pine note, like on the nose, and blooming on your palate. As the hops develop, there is a good balance with the sweet malts that keep the hops ever so slightly in check. The mouthfeel is almost creamy, but not quite, maybe a touch oily with a long bitter finish. Overall, I have had this beer (along with many others) before I found this site, so I waited till I got it again to give it justice. I think I had it before I had really developed my palate, because I had not remembered this one as good as I found it today. I think it is another example of a beer that makes use of very aggressive hops with good balance with the malt. Very tasty and I will buy it everytime I see it."
"Drinkability – Not the best drinking beer. It tastes like it has more than 7.2% abv. Too much bitterness, and not much of anything else."
""
""
""
"Overall its a world class brew that is available readily and for a great price. This is one that i go back to again and again and am never disappointed. A beer that truly deserves its high marks and esteem."

"O: The alcohol is well hidden in this beer but it is not an easy beer to drink - the hoppy bitterness is kind of too intense for my palate. It is an enjoyable but more of a slow sipper - not the greatest match with food (in my opinion) as the flavor is too dominant."

"O- Drinks much like an Imperial IPA, but with less residual bitterness. Although I've had AB on multiple occasions, this is my first review and forget how much I enjoy it. Although familiar with its big brother, Double Bastard, I really need to check out the Oak Aged version of this stellar brew. For a flagship, this is as much unique as it is enjoyable. Go out and get some for yourself...and be sure to get it fresh!"

"Although I`m a fan of many Stone beers, this one doesn`t really stand out to me, however it does look nice. It`s got a clear, rusty red colour that I can`t recall seeing before. The downside is that the head isn`t very creamy and disappears pretty fast. You can really notice the hops in the smell, which I wasn`t expecting. On second smell, you really notice the malt too. Good balance. Which of course transfers very well to the taste. Sweet malty flavour up front that finishes moderately bitter, with some anise and grapefruit. It`s quite dry. Overall, nothing amazing but it is a good beer, no doubt."
""
""
"This is my type of beer. Exactly what you'd expect from a great brewery such as Stone Co. It pours a dark red with a nice thick head. Definitely a strong ale, because the first thing I picked up on was malt followed by a great deal of hops. The taste was great. Very hoppy with a malt aftertaste that is by no means too overpowering. A great balance in flavor. The carbonation was just right. I've had some good strong ale's, but this is definitely up there on my list. 9/10."
""
""
"The hop notes are basically gone. It presents itself as a malty beer with the ghost of a piney hop note that reads more like the residue of fireworks after the fact- - you know they were there from the lingering notes, but you know you missed them. I will definitely try this again and revise my rating when I get a fresher one."

"Overall / Drinkability: A very dangerous beer...I could easily see myself having another one and regretting it later. On the other hand, while strong in flavor, balanced enough that you can get all the flavors in each sip and deeper drink as well such that you want to come back for more. I've had the oaked version of this beer in bottle, but on tap and unoaked...I think it's an even better beer although the smell wasn't as strong as I though it would be. Still, a great beer I will seek out again."

"Fantastic - a definitive US beer. The flavour is perfect, with superb balance between the malt and the bitter/aromatic hops. The body is also solid; the only let-down is the aroma, which is less suggestive than you might expect. If only I could get this regularly for a reasonable price. A true classic - put this on your list of must-try beers."

"O-simple great strong ale, lots of malt and hoppyness"

"Poured into a brandy snifter. Pours deep caramel brown with a large soapy light tan head. The head retains well, dissipating slowly to leave some lacing on the side of the glass. There are aromas of big malts and resinous hops. It has an earthy smell. There's a nice big caramel malt backbone in the taste that brings some mild sweetness and breadiness to the table. There are some nice piney malts that balance the malt flavors. It's a well balanced flavor with a hoppy aftertaste. The alcohol is not detectable in the taste. The body is medium to full with adequate carbonation. The beer is smooth and the drinkability is very high. Overall, this is an excellent beer and worth all the praise it gets. It is an excellent accompaniment for a meal that also has big flavors or if you're looking for a beer to have with a steak dinner."

"O - Definitely a solid brew. Always enjoy it on tap when available. Can't beat the price and availability."
"Glassware, shaker glass. Pours a clear, deep red color with a thick, two finger off-white head. The head barely recedes at all and the lacing is like a sponge coat of paint. The aroma is of pine, citrus, and earthy notes. The taste is dominated by intense bitterness, both upfront front and the back. This is not a session beer. There is significant malt character, but the hops do not give other flavors a chance. The mouthfeel is rich, the head is creamy, almost like froth on a latte. This is an enjoyable beer, perhaps not to be enjoyed daily. I can understand why the brewer's were so hesitant for people to only correlate this beer with Stone."
""
""
""
"Arrogant Bastard is one of my favorite go-to meals. Yes, I said meals. It's also especially excellent with ""big food", such as red meat dishes. It arrives menacing and dark in color, strong in flavor, and it's alarmingly easy to drink despite it's massive personality. It won't overpower your food, but if you like strong beers, this one is just amazing. I've enjoyed it out of a bottle and from a tap. I think the tap version is slightly more fabulous, but both are positively fantastic."

"nice buy for less than 5 bucks a bomber. pours opaque red/orange in color, thick looking, with a nice 2 inch tan head. smells like citrusy hops right away, bitter and bold. also a full bodied red malt characteristic. flavor is very dynamic, with an exciting hop and malt interplay going on. the hops are indeed fruity but bitter, while the malts are dark and sweeter, with notes of toffee and bread pudding. feel is properly arrogant in this beer, with lots of silky smooth body, a detectable alcohol sting, and mellow luxurious carbonation. overall this is a pretty good beer, definitely something different, but i dont think its as incredible as some people make it out to be. a complex glass of ale, but its not made by the hand of god."

"Pours a dark amber color with an off white head that lines the glass throughout. Smell is pretty malty with some breads as well as raisins. Nice complexity to the nose. Taste is amazing. Lots of dark fruits, hints of chocolate, plenty of malts with a yeasty finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall this is a great beer. So much going on with this."
"Pours a clear amber color and an off white head. Has good retention and lacing. Aroma of toasted malts complimented by citrusy, piney hops. Taste has sweet notes of toffe and caramel malts upfront with a heavy, aggressive hop bitterness in the finish. Medium thick body and smooth."

"O: Fantastic. Lives up to its name - the taste is bold, brash, matching the bombastic self-promotion adorning the bottle. Wish I'd checked the review before purchasing - I would have come home with more as this isn't available locally."
""
""
""
"Pours reddish amber with a very slight orange tint and a off white head that forms a ring after a few minutes and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is sweet with a floral hoppiness and some earthy, pine scent as well. Taste is splendid has a sweet hoppy bitterness with a distinct pine flavor along with some fruity sweetness. Body is medium. Has a nice alcohol burn at the end."
"O: Again one of my absolute fav's. It may be a tad expensive but a nice treat to have from time to time. Stone really knew what it was doing with this one, glad to fork over the change and indulge with an air of arrogance :)"
""
""
""
"O: As most hop heads will tell you, ""One of the all time greats!"""

""
""
"O: this is a decent beer, nothing to scream about. I guess I just thought it would've been better but hey I'd still have it again."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best by 2/28/2012. Pours slightly hazy brick red color with a nice 2 finger dense dark cream colored head with fantastic retention that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, pine, toasted grain, biscuit, grapefruit, light chocolate, herbal, and a touch of dark fruit. Fantastic aromas here with great balance. Taste of big caramel, biscuit, pine, grapefruit, light chocolate, toasted malt, herbal hops, and some dark fruit. Nice amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, biscuit, toasted malt, pine, chocolate, and citrus on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance with the bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Very smooth and easy to drink, but is still a bit of a sipper. Alcohol is very well hidden; with hardly any warming noticed on the finish. Overall this is a fantastic brew from Stone. I have not had this in a while, but it impressed me much more this time around. Excellent balance; with nice flavor complexity."

"Stone Arrogant Bastard Ale, 22 oz. bomber: Another fine product from Stone. The Arrogant Bastard Ale is pretty dark in color, a dark amber I would say. The head is pretty thin, of an even consistency and despite being thin, does last and laces well. An aroma of malts and subtle hops comes through. While the Stone IPA and double IPA are huge in the hops department, this brew focuses on the malt, and the hops compliment the malt very well. Expect a flavorful but balanced experience if you try the Arrogant Bastard, with a focus on the malt."
""
""
"Pours a copper color with a nice fluffy head. Taste is medium bodied, great caramel malt upfront with some nice balancing hops on the back end. Refreshing not to have a hop bomb from Stone and this a is a great all around beer. Super smooth with great drinkability, this beer is dangerously good."
""
""
""
""

"Overall this is a good brew but I believe a few more malts would balance it out."

"Overall I did'nt expect much from this because it was so old and I have heard that ABA should be had fresh. It seems to have aged very well. Held its hoppiness well. Glad I did'nt throw this out."

""
""

""

"OA: surely worthy of its reputation."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a flavourful and suprisingly complex beer. The body looks just as delicious after sitting in my Tulip for 10 minutes as it did on the pour. 1 pint should be no problem to finish."
""
""
""
"Overall - While technically classified as a Strong Ale, Arrogant Bastard has the hop bitterness to rival that of the strongest 2IPA's, maybe more. It's a beer that can be, at times, tough to get through, but when one takes it's time, the beauty in this beer shines as bright as the best ales made."

"Blood red with a tan head that laces well and mostly diminishes. Flavors are huge, supperhoppy, resinous and complex with a unique, massive spicy mutant cinnamon like flavor dominating. Finishes with pronounced bitterness but a nice almost port-like aftertaste."

"Nice medium brown amber color. 2 finger head and great lacing. The aroma is hoppy with a rich caramel nutty tone. Dark fruit rings through as well. The flavor is somewhat extreme but well balanced. The strong hop bitterness mixes well with a sweet malty caramel that sticks to your mouth. It is finished by a somewhat strong alcoholic kick. It gets better as you let it settle towards cellar temperatures.  This is a great American Strong Ale."

""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"O - Definitely a beer that shouldn't be served super cold. Just chilled and as it warms up some it changes and opens up even more. One of the best experiences you'll get out of a bottle and it lives up to its cocky namesake!!"
""
""
"O: A solidly good brew. Personally I'd appreciate a weaker hop presence given the great flavors lingering beneath."
"Overall: I’ve had the Arrogant Bastard from tap before, and I recall quite liking it. It’s hoppier than I remembered, and indeed you’d think that this is a particularly bitter IPA from just tasting it. The strange thing is that it looks like a brown ale, and the creamy head would suggest something completely different than what you get: in your face hoppy intensity. Stone Brewing makes a case for this beer being something alternative that not many people will like, but actually I think that this comes quite close to some of the stronger and bolder IPAs or maybe Double Pale Ales that are not uncommon in the US. This makes me surprised about how highly rated the beer is. I think that there are certainly better beers in this category out there."
""
""
""
""
""

"This is a quality beer at a very competitive price. this 1pt. 6oz. bottle cost 4.99 at a local gas station."
""
""

""
""
"Overall the beer looks great, smells great, and tastes great!"
""
""
"O-A well made amber ale. For a strong ale, the alcohol is not dominant. I enjoyed reading the description on the bottle almost as much as drinking the beer. Can't beat the price for this quality."
"O: If I had to choose between Arrogant Bastard Ale and having a colonoscopy, I would almost ALWAYS go with Arrogant Bastard Ale. (Rare exception, Dr. Pete Sizemore, Chicago, IL. Hand warmer. Power dryer. EXQUISITE dr/patient relations.)"
""
""
"Amber color pour. An off white head that was very thick. Some great, lacing that sticks.Smell of caramel, malts, and hops. The flavor was dark fruit, malty and little piny with the sweetness of caramel to round it out. A very bold beer with a lot going on but very easy to drink and enjoy. A well done brew!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: I started out loving this beer, then I hated it, and now I'm back to liking it again. Big, chewy malt throughout, citrus hop resin and a good amount of booze."
"Overall this is a very good ale, very strong and very tasty. Has a big flavour and at $5 for a 22oz bottle a very good price."
""
""
"O: i really would consider this a double ipa. otherwise a solid beer!"

"O: This was one of my very first introductions to good beers, and it remains a favorite. A mouth-puckeringly, jaw-droppingly good hop bomb."
""
""
""
""
"O - this was my first and won't be my last arrogant bastard. Huge complexity and flavor. One of the best beers I've ever had. It deserves the title arrogant title with the look, taste, and feel. It screams world class. Delicious. I now understand why Stone are so highly talked about. A must try."
""
""

""
""
""
""

"Overall this is a top notch beer and a classic. One that I always love to indulge in."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Full-bodied and extremely flavorful. Even at 7.2%, it is quite easy to drink. Overall a very solid brew. One that I have bought time and time again, and makes for a good sipper any time of the year."
""
""
""
"It's a strong ale, good and bold. Maybe too bold to be my everyday beer, but very good."
""
""

"Serving type: bottle"
"O: This is the gold standard... this is what started me into craft beers in fact. I looked in my reviews and realized I had only reviewed the oaked AB, but never the original. I always have a few around from time to time, so what better time to review when im feeling all nostalgic... So overall, this is an amazing, riddle of a beer that has an earned cult following. I would recommend this beer to any person who wants to get into craft brew, and I hope they hate it and grin the first time they see the marketing, but they'll come back and realize, especially after trying 90% of the other crap out there, that this is the top, and a major part of the reason the craft industry is so strong."
"It smells and tastes great. You know that it is there for you... when you want a great strong ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The beer appears a gorgeous hue of ruby tinged sunburst orange. The head is off white and measures a finger's width, leaving some sticky lacing on the sides of the goblet. The aroma offers pine, hops, malt, bread, alcohol. The flavor brings a subtle sharpness, with dank malts and pine resin. Lingering pine and wet hop flavors with a substantial malt body. Medium to full bodied. Overall, a solid beer. I would have this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear reddish brown with half inch tan head and some lacing. The aroma is fruity with sweet malt and some spice. The flavor is sweet malt and vanilla in the background of an overpowering bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium full. Stone Arrogant Bastard is just way too bitter, theirs potential in the background. Barely recommended."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very nice strong ale."

"Excellent beer from Stone, it lives up to its reputation."

""

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Overall I give it a 4 1/2. Great beer for the price and the availability is very convenient. Not one of my favorites by Stone but it's a good plan b when nothing else in the store catches your eye."
"The malt sweetness is definitely present, but very short-lived. The hops seem to stick to my tongue for hours. The brew overall is kind-of rough, strong, and I don't know, the exact opposite of mellow, smooth and balanced?!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall - This isn't a beer for everyone, but that's okay. . With it's rich flavor, it's easy to recommend This is a beer for craft beer enthusiasts who are up to try anything new or for fans of Strong Ales."

"On tap at BJ's Brewhouse in Keller, Texas, served in a pint glass. Deep amber color, adequate head and lacing despite the crappy bartender's best efforts. Aroma of citrus hops, deep caramel, and some light oak and vanilla. Taste is a rich blend of citrus hops with a strong toffee malt backing, but not too sweet. Nicely carbonated with wonderful dry finish, alcohol is well hidden. This is pretty much a go-to beer for me, the best on-tap selection within 2 miles of the workplace."
""

""
""
"Arrogant Bastard Ale is a strong dark ale with lots of hops and a full body mouthfeel. It is as dark as the devil with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Try this beer. If you don’t like it, you are not deserving and that only leaves more for those of us who are."
""
""
"O-the arrogance is appropriate, this is one fine strong and unique strong ale"
""
""
"This is definatly not a beer for everyone. It even says it on its label, Its a stron ale with lots of hops and malts a dark color with a aroma that tells you its an Arrogant Bartard. Worth a try if you are looking for something different. Has to be one of my favorite Stone Brew."

"T: medium body, excellent hop taste some roastiness and spicy"
""
""
""
""
"This beer is a crystal clear lovely amber with a nice tawny head. The chinook hops are too heavy-handed, making the aroma a one-trick pony. A bit of dark fruity crystal malt sweetness is subtly noticeable as the beer warms, but the hop bitterness is beyond my liking, and seems to impart astringency that strips moisture from my epithelial cells."
""
""
"O: Overall the beer is really good, but the smell is very off-putting. I'm not sure what's wrong with my bottle. I would have to buy the beer again to determine whether or not it's the beer or my individual bottle. As it stands, I can't even rate this as average because of the smell."

"Overall, this ipa is one of the bests in my opinion. I love the flavor of the malts and of course the hoppiness of it as well."
""
""
"O – While I have had AB many times before, I seemingly forgot how freakin’ good it is. My first thought upon sitting down to review this was, ”why am I not drinking this more often?” Extra points for being available at grocery stores in the Tempe AZ area. Very well may be the best beer you can buy without looking hard or going to a specialty store like Total Wine. A true stud."

"Since i'm at a bar with wifi i might as well throw a few words towards the infamous Bastard. Deep amber/copper color on the double deuce pour into a standard pint glass. Significant lacing residue left behind. Aromas of pine, roasted malt and a touch of fruitiness greeted me when the head settled down. This is, as we all know, a bitter beer but it does provide a pleasing quantity of malt to the hop dryness. Finish is very dry - just the way i like it. A great beer from a company that caters to my taste profile purchased for a paltry fiver at Mom's Bar happy hour in West LA."

"Let me start out by saying I am not a big Stone fan. I think the hops are normally a bit extreme. This beer is no exception, I tried grading very objectively and most standards its a good beer. I personally only recommend Stone Beer's in general if you love hops to death. I can say I won't be buying this one again."

"From the cask at The Linkery in San Diego. I thought it might be interesting to try the cask version, but I wish I hadn't. The unfortunate part is the warm cellar temp accentuates the astounding excess of bitter hops and makes the whole concoction harsh and and brutal."

"What more needs to be said, 2675+ reviews and holding steady at A-. This is a big bold beer, the name and story on the bottle should be enough. If you can't handle it don't drink it and don't review it. If you're a Pilsner drinker this beer is not going to impress. If you're a big beer drinker who enjoys lingering hops and all the flavors that big beers should have then step right up. This beer is Stone's stellar offering and one that I will also choose unless I need to drive somewhere!"

"O: very interesting and tasty, i dont think i can compare it to anything else. I would buy this again but mainly to hoard and savor it on my own in a quiet room, not something i'd break out at a family party or watch a game with."

"I love the Arrogant bastard. It's a stong ale with lots of character and closely related to the West Coast IPA. For € 5,- a bottle a steal. I'd easly pay € 7.50 just don't tell the good people at Geers."

"O - Not sure why it took me so long to rate this, but I basically concur with all that has been said in the past. This is a stellar beer and one of my favorites. Certainly deserves its Arrogance."

"Thanks Stone! This beer is top notch."
"O: I love the bold hops. But surprisingly they aren't the only star of the show. The malts really show up to balance the beer. Even moreso than I remember. This beer is worthy of the accolades it receives"
"O: I've never enjoyed this beer, and I can't figure out why. I like Stone, I like hoppy beers (is that redundant?), but the particular flavor profile here rubs me the wrong way, whether I have it on tap or out of the bottle. Ah well, more for everyone else."
"Pours a dark dark brown. Nice reddish tint. Not really any head but still well carbonated. Smells malty and rich. Raisiny notes and nice vanilla underneath. Tastes similar. A bit bitter. Very interesting overall. Not something i would recommend aging per say but it's really not bad"
"O: a really solid brew, drinks real easy for a strong ale especially gievn the thickness that it pours with, nice nose and solid taste, stone does it right as usual"
"Yep, this is a good beer. Countless reviews before me have echoed the same sentiment, and I don't doubt that I will be buying more of this in the future in hopes that I can get to know this Arrogant Bastard a little better... Maybe we could even be friends."
"It is what it is, and that's a good thing here."
"Another favorite from Stone."
"TheBeerAlmanac.com"
"Pours that distinctive Arrogant Bastard red color with a creamy, bubbly beige head on top. Smells of pineapple and hoppy greenness with some sticky malt. Big, juicy, bitter flavor...sugary malt underlying a fruity hop attack. Medium bodied, on the slick side and bitter. Good as always and with Raleigh Times going for Most Arrogant Bar, offering $2 pints, I might be in trouble tonight."
"O: fantastic beer, and one that I will gladly enjoy again, maybe next time I will try it from the bottle though"
"O-This beer was a good experience that opened the doors to Strong Ales and hoppy beers in general. Oh, and you gotta love the attitude in the rant on the bottle"
"O- this is a nice beer. complex enough to enjoy tasting but blended together well. the alc is masked well. after a while i was feeling pretty arrogant , myself. ;D i wish they had more 'stone' around here."
"Overall a delicious American Strong Ale which is a year round offering from the guys at Stone Brewery down in San Diego."
"O - Very good year around offering from Stone. This beer fulfills your craving for hops and malts in a single beer. This beer would be a staple in my fridge if Stone would only distribute to Nebraska. Maybe someday."
"I feel it gets overlooked sometimes by some of the rarer and seasonal beers, but it's one of the best out there. Perhaps it's becoming ubiquitous in the craft beer world. However, you can't go wrong with Arrogant Bastard."
"Surprisingly this was my first time trying this beer. Not too bad, though."
"Overall- This strong ale is incredibly intense with its hop bitterness and semi-dry finish, yet you can’t stop sipping. I am blown away by my first strong ale, and can’t wait to try many more."
"O- Awesome beer. Seriously, awesome. But I guess if you are a member of this site, then you probably already knew that already . . ."
"O: A good beer, not overly complex in my eyes but maybe I just don't know that much. Either way, I liked it and could drink it again. A thumbs up from my girlfriend as well."
"Poured this American Strong Ale into a pint glass. The ale poured a dark reddish brown color, produced a off white medium head. Head retention was excellent. Lacing was amazing- nice rings of lace all over the glass. The aroma of the American Strong Ale is full of roasted malt grain and prunes. This is a medium body beer, very drinkable for a Stong Ale. Awesome session beer. Craft Brewing at its best. The taste is malty sweet, almost sticky- Deep roasted taste, full of caramel, dark chocolate and coffee. Finish's sweet. This beer has BALLS- Best example of an American Strong Ale I have had to date."
"This style is such a broad swath catchall that it's tough to rate Arrogant Bastard within its confines. Like a lot of offerings from Stone, I'm not terribly crazy about this beer and find it a little one-dimensional. However, the over-the-top hop bitterness is an intended effect, and for that I can say that this beer is a success."
"Overall I would say this is a very nice beer. But if hoppy as hell bitter beers are not your thing, I wouldn't waste your time. But if you like IPA beers I would grab one of these 22's the next time you get a chance. They are kind of expensive usually around 6 bucks for one of these, and some of their others are even more expensive but its well worth it."
"The drinkability is high for strong ale, and to me this beer has been always been very enjoyable for the past few years. This is a consistent staple at my family gatherings since we are “worthy”, and while other Stone beers might actually taste better, to me this is still always tasty and I feel loyal to this flagship Stone product which has brought a lot of enjoyment over the years. I am a huge fan of this and could drink this beer all year round and suggest that everyone try it."
"O/D - Great. Sessionable while being extremely aggressive. Nice with alot of well blended flavours. It works well. Good job."
"M: A delicious fullness that doesn't feel nearly as strong as it actually is. Plenty of hops but more than enough balance."
"Over all this Ale is Arrogant and perfect for arrogant bastards like me!! Major thumbs up!!!"
"I find myself enjoying this one a lot. Cheers."
"Feels like a kick in the mouth. At over 100 ibu's this is definitely a STRONG ale. A nice toasted malt flavor sneaks in just as the hop takes over your palate. The head cream color and amber beer color are immaculate. The 7.2% alcohol will leave you slow drinking this arrogant bastard."
"O/D- I've had this beer a number of times and am finally getting around to reviewing it. Complex but nicely balanced and highly enjoyable. I love this beer because it's readily available and pretty well priced."
"O- I do like this, but not quite as much as their IPA offering... feel like that might be more my style."
"Overall - I tried this initially before joining BA, and have been wanting to review this since joining. It is even better than I remembered, and is truly a fantastic, flavorful and powerful ale. I will be picking this one up far more often. It is imperative that you see ""if you are worthy", definitely give this one a try, two thumbs way up for me. Don't try other styles after this in the same evening though - the hops are powerful and will linger on the palate long after the session ;)"
"O: Big flavor, lots of balance and a heavy hit of alcohol. This beer is definitely a classic for a reason. I wouldn't try to drink anything afterwards because it leaves your mouth feeling totally ravished, but it's worth it."
"Don't want an over the top IPA? Don't want a malt heavy beer? How about a perfect combination of both? From the color to the smell to the taste this is an awesome beer. Nice mixture of hops with a sweet malty taste ending. This is a near perfect fall beer."
"Hot damn, I love this old craft standby."
"O: Excellent job, guys. First Stone Brewing in a while, and I should totally get on that again."
"O - This is a solid beer that benefits from its availability. Other Stone beers are better in my opinion, but this is a staple that should be tried."
"This pours a dark, hazy brown and has a good amount of off-white head and sticky lacing. The smell is dark fruit and a little spice. The flavor is heavy bitterness and dark-fruits…I guess. I feel like the flavor should be sweeter or something, I just taste a lot of extreme bitterness...black walnut comes to mind. I’m not complaining, however, I don’t even love highly sweet beers. This beer is definitely tasty, but I would like to revisit it in a food pairing situation. Additionally, I think this beer would be best served in the fall or winter. At a $3.59 price point, I see myself coming back to this in those situations when you want something a little meatier than an IPA."
"Mouthfeel - Plenty of bite that follows suit with the rest of the beer's aggressive nature."
"Mouthfeel: a nice tingle of alcohol bite. carbonated and dry with the finish which quenches the thirst and make you want more. a staple in my cellar and never disappointed when I break into a bottle."
"o: an excellent beer that is worthy of the name."
"O- A delicious brew. Not something I'd drink every day, but I'm really enjoying it right now. I'm sure by the time this bomber is don't my Arrogant cravings will be satisfied."
"O- One of the best beers I have had yet. Doesn't really get any better. I love this stuff. I wish it was available in 12 packs for $7.99 like Natural Ice is."
"I remember when this was one of the only craft beers I could easily find. Glad those days are over but this is still one solid brew. There’s a saying that asks which is better, the devil you know or the devil you don’t know. Get to know this devil."
"I'd drink this again for sure but perhaps not ice cold like this was served too me. I hope Stone comes to Alberta and seeing how it's in BC already I don't think its much of a stretch"
"This is a classic and I was surprised to have not reviewed before. This is a fantastic brew."
"O- Very balanced and drinkable. Excellent beer for the price, I still prefer the oaked version though."
"Deep bronze color and massive head, fabulous retention and lacing, looks and behaves like a beer from an old cartoon. The nose is comprised of citrus, pine and oak with a floral hops, it is a little boozey but it adds to the character. The flavor is hops, and malt with a toffee sweetness, bitter bite at the finish. Medium body and carbonation, well crafted. One of the better ales I’ve had, really interesting and flavorful"
"O: This beer is special to me, so I probably inflated the scores a bit. I still feel, even after everything else I've had, that if I could only have one beer for the rest of my life, this is the one it would be. Thank you stone!"
"All in all this is a good beer. Very Very complex. I think the heavy hops are overpowering and I have trouble recognizing the other flavors"
"Overall: This is a total classic in craft beer. A total ""go-to"" beer for those who like strong ales. Will get this again, aboslutely! Stone continues to blow my mind."
"O: Definitely give this a try! Very nice!"
"O: Arrogant Bastard Ale is marketed correctly, I'd say. It's a wild brew with some serious flavor and a lot of complexity, which is miraculously well organized--it doesn't taste like everything at once. It also does a good job of keeping a first timer on their toes looking like a dark brew, smelling like an IPA and tasting like a well balanced red ale (with some uncharacteristic qualities!). Arrogant Bastard Ale might have to be a repeat buy, you know, just so I can get more acquainted and perhaps even ""worthy""."
"Palate: grassy with citrus; floral; bitter finish that feels good on the ol' mouth. roasted malts are also available to the taste buds. very good tasting"
"Nice bold beer."
"D: Drinkability is pretty high although the bitterness can be tiring."
"O: This is a phenomenal beer. This is the second American strong ale that really made me take notice of the awesomeness of beer (the first being Rogue’s Dead Guy Ale) several years ago before I started to get all nerdy about beer."
"O: A solid strong ale that is, as it states, not for everyone. It has wonderful bitter flavor, but also has some sweet sugar notes that balance the beer. The head is wonderful, and the finish has great bite. However, it is not a beer to sit back and drink a six pack. It is a beer that you enjoy a bit at a time."
"Dr: Too difficult to drink for the ABV. The flavours are a damned distraction. The price is higher than it should be. It's far from awful, but I wouldn't have it again."
"This beer packs a pine punch in the face with the most curious and enigmatic aroma I've come across. The aroma has almost nothing to do with the taste, but that just adds to the complexity of this fine ale. After drinking my first glass of this bomber, I feel like I can scrape hop resin off my tongue. It's hard to imagine what kind of food would hold its own against this monster of a beer."
"Been a while since I had this on tap, it used to be my go to beer when I was craving some hops and bitterness. I had this beer after an DIPA and it still had that awesome bitterness. It doesn't have that same affect that it did so many years ago but still in my top ten that is readily available."
"Overall: This is definitely one of my absolute favorite beers and it's one that I drink very frequently."
"O - Fantastic beer. It's what really got me into craft beer."
"This is an outstanding brew but at $17.99 a six pack and $65.00 a case, who is being arrogant here."
"Quite thick and viscous, between soft and firm. Lingering bitterness diminishes drinkability, especially in a 22 oz. bottle. A good beer, but overrated in my opinion."
"In California they serve this on the Pacific Surfliners - the trains that go up and down the coast. That along with Stone's IPA. And I think the best way to enjoy one is from right in the cafe car of the #784."
"This beer is a tawny red with a reddish cappuccino head. The lacing is fantastic. The nose has green tea aroma with toasty and caramel notes. The hops come on in the second half and leave a deep sprucey bitterness that lingers that draws you in for another drink. The mouthfeel is full and lush. I think this is a great beer that is not nearly as bitter and extreme as I remember but a great drink."
"D - A really complex, interesting brew. To me this is strictly a sipping beer, so the drinkability is not high. The taste is impressive. This is the first time I've had it on tap, and it does not disappoint."
"0 - An excellent ale with alot of body and character, perfectly combined ingredients that makes this beer an outstanding A."
"O: a great ale, good hop presence though it could do with some more hop presence throughout"
"O/D: It's a classic, aggressive beer. On tap is ideal, but take it any way you can get it."
"One of the few beers I've had on tap in New Brunswick, NJ that I can honestly enjoy. I've had it many times out of the bottle and on tap its much more enjoyable than the typical beers served in a college town. I was pleasantly surprised to find the beer on tap and have had it a few times. The flavor is noticeably better on tap and considerably more enjoyable. Perhaps it was the environment or maybe my state of mind, but either way it is an all around great beer. I recommend to anyone who is in the mood for a flavorful/somewhat strong beer."
"Overall: An excellent beer which supposedly makes me ""not worthy"" enough to give it a perfect 5! I treat it as a special delicacy, and would never consume it regularly due to its extreme, pleasurably antagonizing experience. It's incredible, but I would never introduce people to craft beer with AB. What I love about AB is how self-conscious it is of the fact that it's NOT for everyone. I totally am enamored with it, however, and am happy to see that it's available everywhere. Truly a living legend in the craft brewing world."
"O: as if you didn't know yet, stone arrogant bastard is top notch stuff."
"This may well become my go to bomber!!"
"This is a phenomenal beer. I plan to add a bottle to my beer cellar. I may even seek out the Oak Aged version."
"Poured a nice reddish color with a solid and lasting head. The head is one of those thick juicy ones that doesn't want to let go, love that! Smells of roasted malt character mostly without much if any hop aroma. The taste is solid malt and a nice balanced bitterness. A clean yet full mouthfeel rounds out a brew that is solid, but don't expect a new twist here."
"O- its a strong ale high on hops. Not something that Im used to drinking but is still very well built and just a damn good beer."
"This ale is a shape-shifter from start to finish. It begins like a sweet syrupy old ale or scottish ale then takes a left-hand turn into IPA bitterness territory. This is quickly muddled by stormy clouds of stout roastiness, but the warm esters make a comeback in the end leaving the palate utterly dumbfounded, but somehow satisfied."
"Overall: kickass beer"
"The first thing i notice every time is the quality smell. It really sets up the flavor for the entire Arrogant Bastard Experience."
"O: overall this beer is just plain good. No major flaws, just darn right good."
"O: This is a thick, heavy brew that offers a substantial amount of flavor in every sip. As the bottle warns: you really need a developed palate to be able to truly appreciate the flavor profile of this brew. A solid ""A" brew that is thoroughly enjoyable when only a ""full-flavored"" beer will do."
"Pours a mahogany color with a yellowish off-white large head. The head is mousse-like and thins to a chunky covering. Laces the glass a good deal. Tiny carbonation bubbles rise along the side. The aroma is floral and pine hops. Taste is roasted grapefruit pith. This is a bit syrupy-oily in character. Has a warming alcohol finish."
"take it for granted, another Stone beer that is readily available, priced great and tastes good."
"A pretty reddish-copper brew fills my glass with only a small amount of white foam on top. The aroma is predominately hops with a bit of pine added in. It tastes like some DIPAs I've had, with that intensity of hops but with an added bit of toffee and cocoa. The body is dense, but not porter level. It has a mild dryness but it doesn't detract from enjoying the brew. I'm glad i went with this impulse buy, but I wish it was actually available in Iowa."
"D: Very enjoyable evil brew from Stone. Have enjoyed several already--at Bonefish Grill no less."
"D: very tasty. sweet yet assertively bitter. glad i picked up one of these bombers."
"I, like many BAs have a long history with this beer. When I was first getting into craft beer, I purchased this beer for name alone, not really knowing what I was getting into. I honestly drain poured my first bomber not because I didn't like it, but because it was too much for me. Since, I have had many run-ins with this beer, including trying it on tap, and I have quickly come to realize that I prefer this beer with a few months on it. Fresh is a little too hoppy in my opinion and I prefer to allow the hops to mellow slightly, allowing the malt to come through more. Personally, I prefer this beer right around its ""Best By"" date."
"this pours a nice dark brownish color with a nice tan foamy head which has good retention and leave a nice lacing. The smell is loads of malts caramel and toffee, with a slight pine hoppy presence. Feel is medium with a bitter hoppy coating. The taste is pretty good, you get a nice bready toffee malt taste (not as much caramel as I expected), followed by a complete mouth coating pine hop bitterness. Overall as allways a great product by stone, I usually buy the IPA because I like the citrus/grapefruit taste it has or the Oaked AB because I liked the added oak/vanilla flavor, but this one is an excellent beer and if stone didn't have so many other great beers, I'd get this much more. I think Stone might be my favorite brewery."
"Overall: This is very well balanced beer. I love how the yeasty flavors up front blend with the ""piney"" hops. Arrogant Bastard thankfully opened my eyes to the wonderful world of west coast hop bombs. I'm proud to have finally written a review."
"O: I enjoyed this a lot, one of my favorite brews. High ABV but not too obvious in the taste"
"Pours a dark mahogany with a white head that has decent carbonation, very good retention and nice sticky lacing. The nose consists of dark fruits, roasted and sweet malts along with some hops. The taste starts out with some dark fruits, bitter roasted chocolate, caramel, a hint of floral and pine in the hops that bites the tongue. The taste gets more intense after each drink and the alcohol and roasted flavors come through more. The mouthfeel is very smooth and easy to drink for a medium to full body beer. This is one of the most flavorful and tasty strong ales that I have had and I would recommend it."
"Mouthfeel comes across as smooth and creamy with a thick full bodied feel. Overall, AB is a classic American craft beer and one that, in this beer drinkers opinion, truly defines American beer. Bold and assertive, yet well-balanced and drinkable... hard to get much better."
"O: I enjoyed this a lot, and would buy it often if only Stone would distribute in Iowa. Definitely one to seek out on the occasional road trip to Illinois."
"Just another great beer from Stone. I have this beer several times a year, and I've never had a bad pour."
"I can't say I love this beer but I can say that I liked it. It is pretty good, but almost peculiar at first taste. I detected a strong taste of grapefruit in this brew coming from the hops yet has a strong malty backbone to balance it out. It has a very nice appearance of caramel color brew with a 3 finger head that shrunk down but lasted to the last drop. Good beer but not something I'll seek out."
"Very good beer have had it multiple times and haven't been disappointed once."
"This beer was great. Poured wonderfully with a big head and drank very bitter and hoppy, which I expected and wanted when I bought it. Definitely worth the money and not too hard to find in my town. More bars should have this on tap."
"Great brew. I'm not always in a ASA mood but when I am, this is an easy go to."
"O- Great beer for its style. Great for hopheads, even better for me"
"Overall it's a good beer, not great, but good."
"22oz bottle. Pours a dark amber red color with pretty good head. Tastes of malts, hops, alcohol and tart fruit. A very dark, heavy and hop-dominated beer. This is a very strong, hop-dominated brew and quite frankly, I am not worthy. The quality of this beer is top notch, and if you enjoy a hop-dominated flavor you will love this."
"A bit sharp on the feel but a nnce light body. Overall it's pretty easy to see why people love this beer. It's unique but doesn't stray into the strange territory."
"Poured from a bomber, pours dark amber with tan head that sticks around a little with some lacing. Very aromatic with malt and hops most prominent. Taste is very well balanced with lots of malt, good hops, and a little bitterness. A great beer that I would try to keep on hand."
"P.S. Whoever the reviewer is that said ""this is a great session beer"" needs their head checked."
"This beer pours a dark ruby color with no head but some lacing. The aroma has hints of plums and brown sugar. The taste has hints of coffee, figs, raisins, chocolate and cinnamon? The mouthfeel is a bit overcharged and leaves a bitter finish that lingers for some time. Overall a good beer."
"The beer pours out brownish-red in color with a thick and heavy off-white head on top. The smell is slightly sweet - with tones of caramel malts and a slight pop of citrus hops underneath. The beer's taste is powerful and strong, but surprisingly well balanced and sneaky with regards to hiding it's ABV. At first taste the beer smacks you upfront with a strong citrus hop bite. Then you get pleasant sweet caramel and roasty - almost nutty - tones throughout the drink with a clean-dry finish on the swallow. There's a notable amount of hop oil which lingers on the tongue after the swallow, but it's not overpowering and balances the malt tones gracefully. Overall, the drink of Arrogant Bastard ale is outstanding."
"But it did look really nice."
"6$ a bomber"
"the grapefruit citrus flavor carries on to the taste, with a lingering malty aftertaste, with a nice hoppy kick. very nice dry finish, great beer, hope to get my hands on some more."
"something bitter, I would personally choose Southern Tier's IPA or 2XIPA, but definitely try it if you see it."
"My next trip to BevMo and I saw some of their other beers, I knew I was in for a treat. A tasty treat! Bravo Stone Brewing!"
"O - I think they are on to something here"
"Overall there is a reason this one is a standard. It is a powerful tasting beer that is pretty much a hop bomb. There is a reason this one is one of my favorites."
"Served straight from a 22 oz brown bomber bottle because I didn't feel like washing a glass. Lemme cut to the chase and skip the formalities, everyone else already said what the stuff looked like. This is a BIG, flavorful ale that revels in its aggressive complex nature. This ain't a beer that you pair with a ceasar salad. Think venison chops with bleu cheese crumbles on top, or beef stroganoff. It reminds me of the Ginger beer sodas that the fancy pop companies make. Overall a very good beer if you like big flavor, which I do."
"O - Not sure why I have always passed this one up, but I am glad I finally gave it a try."
"Overall this is a really good beer. Great hop character and a great name. It fits me very well. (nose in the air)"
"O: A true classic in the craft world, and deservingly so. Am I worthy? I don't know, but I like it!"
"i would like to try more stone beers but for me this beer was just overhyped or at least not what it was made out to be i will go have a levitation beer instead"
"Cheers..."
"Poured a rich coppery brown...with a dense two finger long lasting head on a midly aggresive pour. Moderate lacing. Good mouthfeel, with a bitter bite on the back of the tounge that is lasting. I like the beer far more than i was expecting and would enjoy drinking this beer at any time."
"Overall - I think this is the flagship beer that really communicates what stone is all about, bold flavors. It really gives a nice hoppy ale."
"Arrogance is bliss…heavy malt and hop flavors along with a decent ABV makes for a solid brew, personally leaving little to be desired."
"Overall, definitely a good brew. Would serve as a good introduction to Stone and how big their beers can be."
"Really hard to get all the way through when I first tried this hefty beer years ago. But it gets easier once you know what to expect. Its greatness can't be denied. Pours a dark reddish-brown with a small off-white head that retains well and generally leaves a bit of clingy lace. Lots of strong hops in the aroma, rough around the edges, with notes of toasted grains and malts, and hints of dark fruits. Taste is complex; strong with pine hops, woody, bitter, biting, with toasted caramel malts, and notes of resin, raisins, tobacco, molasses, and coffee. Alcohol presence is noticeable. Medium bodied but full of flavor, can be a bit harsh to drink for beginners, but is a wondrous quaff for the experienced palate."
"O: I love Stone. This is one I like to have from time to time."
"Note: I drank this at the same place as the 90 min Dogfish Head, with the same fish and chips. Not even close to the same experience."
"O- stone must have invented this style because this beer is what I imagine the style should be. Taste could be more developed and the aroma could be stronger, but I'm reviewing in a bar so... Seek this beer out!"
"O: Very awesome beer. I love it and will drink again."
"Big hoppy bite in the front with immediate notes of toast and grapefruit rind. Finishes smooth with some residual hop dryness. Distinct blueberry and blood orange back-note."
"Overall: the difference between the bottle and the tap of this is extraordinary. While the label on the bottle seems to be hyperbole, it accurately describes the tap version. Cheers!"
"You can smell it from a table away, and it looks awesome. Power is all I can say with taste, I really enjoy how potent it is. It isn't my all-time favorite strong beer...but it fights for the top. My friends think I'm crazy when I bring out the ole Arrogant Bastard at dinner."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Poured 22 oz bomber into 13 oz tulip. Pours a clear ruby red. Fluffy off white, sticky head. Lacing is bountiful. Smell is some pine, bready, & a touch of carmel. Taste similar, but more intense with a smack of piny hops in the finish. The mouth feel is hearty for it's easy drinkability with plenty of life. This was one of my first true craft beer experiences a little more then a year ago. Still awesome, especially this fresh best buy 8/30/11. Stone is great."
"about it, The bottle was awesome looking the name was great. The story on the back was also very cool. This beer was just a really good starting point for me when venturing out into the beer world. Had my first bottle on 4-17-2008. The beer poured out as a deep amber color. The head is pretty thick looking and white. head that laces the glass really well. The smell was stronger than what I was used to at the time, It was big and hoppy, a subtle sweetness on the nose as well. The taste has a strong pine flavor to it. The hop character of this beer is very good. The other tastes were of some caramel malts that gave is a slight sweetness and a light wooden flavor too. The mouthfeel is medium and had a good drinkablity to it. Overall, I think this beer is a classic in it's own way. As long as Stone makes this beer I don't see them going out of business anytime soon. It's a beerthat's got the balls to stand up against all the others out there and say ""I'm better than you""."
"O. This is an amazing beer. It was one of the beers that helped me out on the road from macro to micro brew, and has earned a special place in my heart."
"Really tasty, a sweeter alternative to Stone's IPA's."
"overall arrogant bastard is, simply put, a great beer. i'd stop short of calling it world-class, but just very well-crafted and one i will always return to."
"Overall: A great beer, certainly an acquired taste by some standards. But a wonderfully big beer, none the less."
"O: A well crafted beer. Maybe overly hyped, but stands up to it. Goes down a little to easy for 7.2%. Definitely not an all day drinker."
"O - this is just one of those great year round beers. Enough malt character for chilly nights and tons of bitterness for a warm afternoon. I need to pick this one up more often."
"O - This is an awesome beer for anyone who thinks they're worthy."
"D: Not the kind i would want to session but a very good beer."
"Pretty opaque reddish brown color in my snifter. Has a perfect tan creamy head that sticks around with great lacing when swirled. This beer has a perfect nose. Sweet and malty with floral hops. Brings good sweetness to the tongue. Not at all cloying. The sweet on the front balances well with the back of the tongue bitterness. Mouthfeel is perfect for my taste, great effervescence, slightly sticky. Bitterness on the finish sticks around a bit too long for my taste and is the one and ONLY drawback, but overall, an almost perfect drinking experience."
"O: I can tell this is a high quality beer. It also surprises me with its Englishness. Really not what I expected from such a high profile US beer. I have to take into account it may have lost substantial amounts of hops from its journey to Australia, but this bottle still holds up in its own right."
"O - Somewhat surprised it took me so long to get around to this one...an excellent ale with a heaping helping of malts and hops, and yet it never looses balance. Heavier alcohol present in the flavor, but I dig it...not off putting at all to me."
"Overall - ""You're Not Worthy"" Perhaps not, but it's 1 Pt. 6Fl. Oz. of 7.2% ABV ale that is both invoking and satisfying"
"Aftertaste of breadiness, yeast and a little touch of sour start coming back to find it's way around my tongue. What a complex brew, and this beer can definitely afford to be arrogant. Damn bastard leaves me craving for more."
"share with local homebrewers"
"O: Top quality beer. They really hit the nail on the head with this one, complex darker ale, really powerful. They put the arrogant description on the label, and it sure lives up to it. If you've never had this, you gotta have it ASAP."
"Drunkability: Balanced, full of flavor, and a high abv... I like it."
"Definitely an interesting beer. A bit too hoppy for my tastes, but has more depth and flavor than most IPA's I've had. If you are looking for something a bit different, this one is worth a try."
"Th Arrogant Bastard is another fine creation from Stone. The color is deep amber with thin head, there is a slight hop and citrus nose, taste is a struggle between malt and hop which can linger on the pallete angrily, mouthfeel is a bit tough and bitter, but I like it!"
"This is a nice hoppy American Strong Ale. The flavors are very aggressive and in your face. I could see why some people might not like it, but I do."
"Where else can you find a ruby colored, sweet, hoppy, high ABV beer? I'm sure one exists but I haven't seen it. This beer earns the right to be arrogant."
"O- its a good beer and definately worth trying. Don't think its one I would want all the time but its a good change of pace from other beers and it gets a +1 for the story on the bottle. Had better beers but still a good beer."
"O: By drinking this beer my husband and I were able to get past a long ""having our differences"" day and enjoy each other, the company, and a great tasting, hop-filled, in-your-face finish beer that I would be sure to buy again!!"
"Overall a good beer, would definitely have it again and again. Not the greatest but really really good beer. Cheers!!"
"A deliciously strong, rich and complex beer which really delivers a lot of taste and aroma. Even better, it comes in a huge bottle! Not really a session beer but a fine example of a beer to sit back and savour."
"Overall - It defies comparison and it's a beer that grows on you. I'm thrilled that I can finally go to the Ale House and get something decent. It's not a beer I go out and buy, but it's a beer I'll always get when I'm out at a restaurant."
"Overall- Fairly simple, yet complex at the same time, great balance throughout all aspects on this one. A nice “go to” beer."
"I actually prefer this to the oaked version. The oak, while good, had a bit of harshness to it. This is way smoother, and in my estimation, much more drinkable."
"O- Always been a favorite, never reviewed. I can remember my first AB when I didn't like it, now I can't get enough."
"Notes: Arrogant Bastard is definitely not a beginner beer. But I've had enough quality strong ales to know a decent beer. From the smoothness of the middle to the finish, it's not hard to tell that this is a very nicely crafted brew. That said, I do think it's completely over the top. And maybe that's the idea, but I do find the sensationalism of it all - the Arrogance of it - to be a distraction from what is otherwise an excellent brew."
"O: I'm glad I picked up a bottle after my initial experience on tap. This is a fantastic beer, and I definitely plan to buy more next time I am in the States."
"o: this beer makes u proud to be alive. its a wonderful blend of biterness and roasted malt."
"Not arrogant without reason, a toast today to Stone's big news on their new brewery and everexpansion."
"I remember when this was one of the ""strongest"" tasting beers I've had. It's not anymore, but it's really a good beer I don't drink often enough. A widely available go-to when you're looking for something sturdy and flavorful."
"A tasty complex well-balanced brew. A Strong Ale indeed."
"O: Indeed, this brew is strong with a fantastic biting finish to each sip, and especially the final one. Floral, hoppy tempered with a malt base. It is a good beer."
"This beer is somewhere in between I.P.A. and double I.P.A. It pours a nice redish, with an aroma of hops and fruit. Generally double I.P.A.'s I've tried have had a powerful grapefruit characteristic. This beer had a balance of the hop character of a highly-hopped single I.P.A., and a fruit after-taste of a double I.P.A. It is one of the most complex brews I have tried recently. This is definitely worth picking up for any hop lover."
"although probably the most common of Stone ales, its as solid as it comes. a great hop forward amber. my only beef is i wish the ABV was cut a bit lower."
"Found this is the bottle the other day. I've had it before, but I'm reviewing now so I thought I would mention it. It's everything everyone is making it out to be a big, aggressive beer that you have to be a craft beer drinker to enjoy. Don't think this is the kind of beer that a bud or miller drinker would enjoy. But, if you love craft beer, it belongs in a category of it's own."
"This one is, as the name states, a bruiser of a beer. Strong and potent. Enjoyable, but watch out as this one sneaks up on you!"
"Overall, this is a really nice brew. In the past I've wondered why they don't just call it a big amber, but this time I really noticed the caramel malts backing up the bitterness, providing a little more depth than normal for an amber."
"This is also my goto draft beer and I enjoy it all the time. The only problem is that it tends to ruin my palate for anything else, but it's not a terrible thing if I have to commit to Arrogant Bastard for the night."
"All in all this beer is very quality, but maybe not for everyday drinking. It's not the most refreshing beer I've had but I think this would be perfect for a fall night after a hard day. Good stuff, great beer for a hophead."
"Mouthfeel - Seems full."
"O - Good solid Stone offering. Nicce drinker."
"This is an amazing beer. I mentioned above the simplicity with this beer and it really is fairly straight forward. A lot of pine bite against a strong caramel sweetness and wrapped in what has to be one of the best looking beers I've ever had the pleasure of drinking."
"Dig it."
"To me the AB is a definite pioneer in the craft brew industry and Stonebrew would not be who they are with out it. Flagship really. I mean what do you even label it...An American Strong? An Imperial Amber? An AltAle lol. I can totally see this brew as being offensive to the loyal BMC drinker. I have even tested this theory with friends in fact. Big fan. I love homebrewing the clone and have had amazing success. Even further surprised by the simplicity of the recipe but it all really comes together nicely. Cheers!"
"O: Outstanding beer. 'Nuff said."
"Taste does not always reflect color! Very Fresh Taste, crisper than I thought. ABV... enough said, and smell is clean and not overwhelming."
"It's typically stone in that it's great stuff, as expected. Arrogant Bastard doesn't disappoint at all. A real value at the price too."
"Delightful, and goes well with a bowl of chili."
"A muddled mahogany deep brown with very little clarity. The color eats into the head, a tan foamy 1 finger that sticks around, and to the sides of the glass. A sweet fruity caramel malty nose, same in flavor. Maybe a little raisin, or date. Smoky tobacco, slight bitterness. A taste of alcohol reminds you that its a strong ale. The faint taste of diacetyl, but I'm hypersensitive to it. Smooth creamy mouthfeel with low to medium carbonation. A good beer, love the oaked bottle I had recently, so I'm questioning the freshness of this particular pour. I'll seek it out as soon as I can to compare."
"O-A really good flagship beer from a real quality brewery."
"Pours athick three finger brownish head. Forms a sort of iceberg in the pint glass. Sticky sea foam lacing across the side of the glass. The beer itself looks similiar to iced tea, but with visible carbonation. The smell is of hops, carmel, and just a touch of malt at the end. Also another smell i cant determine...maybe cotton candy? The taste is strong, but smooth. Heavy, yet balanced. Hops and bitterness take the lead followed closely by a touch of alcohol and a slight candied sweetness. A classic and always a go to beer."
"O: This is a perfect example of how simple ingredients can become great, complex beer. I'm just glad Stone has the guts to make such aggressive brews; it makes the beer world a more interesting place!"
"Pours a dark mahogany, huge dense cream coloured head. Super thick and creamy. Leaves a helluva lot of lace. Medium retention. Nose is hopped to high heaven, lots of tropical notes with a sturdy malt base to support it. Taste kicks off with a blast of hops and massive malt backbone. Citrus and tropical notes contend with and intense bitterness imparted by the alpha acids. Huge caramel toffee base giving this loads of body. An interesting cinnamon spiciness comes out here as it warms, along with some dark tea flavours. Great bitterness here and a full, hefty feel. A suggestion of the alcohol is made, but that only adds to how good this was. An off center imperial red, methinks..."
"Picked up at my local up the street. They even opened up a slot in the cooler to stash it. Glad they are sticking to the Stone guidelines. Poured a 22oz double deuce into my New Belgium globe. This beer pours a deep amber with a great 3 inch head that leaves seriously sticky lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is hoppy up front. Nice notes of citrus and pine mixed with toffee and caramel with just a bit of biscuit and toast. As it warms the pine really starts drowning out everything else. Almost like blowing your nose with a pine branch. The flavor actually has a lot more malt then the nose would have led you to believe. Nice caramel and toffee notes with just a bit of burnt toast. Piny hopes help balance out the malt. Just a bit of booze and a hint of a medicinal hop bitterness at the tail of the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is nice and crisp, leaving a nice dryness on the palate. Overall, this is a good beer that deserves the reputation that it has garnered over the years."
"Overall- This is an extremely hoppy Strong Ale when it comes down to it but have had stronger ales than this one. Can only enjoy 2 in one night but a great ""go-to"" ale when the night is young or at times when you need an extra kick to your glass. Have been selling the shit out of this beer this week and plan on continuing to support Greg Koch and all of his great ales! Cheers!"
"For something that practically screams on the bottle ""this probably isn't for you!!", it sure comes off ridiculously sessionable. But maybe it's reverse psychology that makes it truly arrogant: make something virtually anybody would enjoy, and then taunt them not to drink it. I'd gladly have a couple of this on-tap if offered."
"O: Packs a delicious bite. A pretty fantastic beer."
"Poured a medium dark brown. Scent is very strong in hops as usual with most Stone Beer. Has a very heavy malt and hops taste to it. It was blended together very well to make a great complex sipping beer. Another very tasty beer to try on tap!"
"O- Oh yeah, Good Beer!!!!"
"Good smell. The taste is with a very bitter hop, a bit too hoppy for me."
"O-very good to excellent, can't really define this beer type, sortoff a IPA but sort of a pale ale, not sure. Not unforgettable but will try again when the mood is right."
"edit - by the end of the bomber, the edge has worn off of the bitterness and it's a lot more enjoyable. my palate has probably just gotten a lot more used to it."
"Pours a hefty two finger head, the head is very close to white, but not quite. The head is retaining itself very well, not going anywhere so far. It looks very frothy too, lots of small bubbles, a few big ones. The body has a deep red color, with hints of brown, it's barely see through, for the most part it's cloudy and you cannot see through it at all, but at some points you can. This beer looks very good, the head is still there!!! Wow. On one hand this beer smells very standard, just a hoppy ale, with some malt and not much else. However, there is a very lively feeling to it, I don't necessarily pick up fruit on the nose, but I just feel like it's going to be there. It's a weird feeling, because it's a unique smell, but I can't quite distinguish what's so unique about it. One thing is for sure, it smells hoppy and intriguing. Interesting taste, not as hoppy as I thought it would be on the smell. The malts are also a lot more noticeable. There may be some hints of fruit in here, but they are very very small. It tastes very standard, but at the same time it's a very unique standard, it's hard to explain, but for sure a unique taste, even if it is very subtle. The mouthfeel is pretty damn good, it's not huge, but it's pretty substantial for what a strong ale should be, and on some sips you get some creaminess from the head (which is still there btw) which is very nice. Drinkability isn't too bad either, like I said the hops aren't as present as I thought they would be, which is a little disappointing, but it makes for a smoother, more balance drinking. Overall, this is a very solid beer. I would call it a unique beer, but in very subtle ways, it's not the craziest beer out there, but it has a nice personality too it, and it is of course well crafted, I say of course because Stone makes good beer."
"Overall, its good, nothing great, but glad to have it at a bar my friends want to go to."
"The first time I tried to buy beer I was told to try this and I asked if it was any good after reading the label. “Well, the labels right odds are you won’t like it.” I put the bottle down and I bought something else. Today I proudly drink this beer from an Arrogant Bastard specialty glass, stem and all."
"Arrogant Bastard is an egotistical, condescending asshole of a beer, but like they say: it’s hard to be humble when you know you’re great. Though it’s definitely rough around the edges, AB always seems to deliver the kick in the ass my tastebuds crave."
"Overall fairly solid, but I think there's other bastards for stone that I would have and prefer."
"Overall a great beer. I don't know that I'll drink it all the time, but it was good and I'm glad I drank it."
"I will always have a big heart for this beer,it was the first real beer that got me into real beer. To this day it is still my gold standard for beer. App its a dark ruby amber it has a strong smell piney in the front and in the back. It just tastes like o this is what a beer is sour at the start super piney at the end,great thick mouthfeel. Everyone should drink this atleast twice."
"I didn't especially care for this one to start out, but towards the end of the bomber I was loving it. Note: as the beer warms the malt really starts to show it's true colors, so I would recommend letting it sit out at room temperature a bit before consuming if you want a more balanced beer."
"Overall: A very nice blend of sweetness and bitterness. I think the description on the bottle is a little misleading as it makes it sound like this a hopbomb like a DIPA. The bitterness is mild enough for someone who isn't a hophead to enjoy. Overall a very solid brew."
"Finish: A bitter hops with a little maltyness"
"Definitely good, though I'm not blown away by the flavor or the aroma. The aroma is a little light, and the bittering hops in the flavor just kinda come in and smack my tongue around. That said, it is quite smooth, moderately complex, and rather easy drinking for a beer with this much alcohol and bitterness."
"O - Great beer. Beer is good enough to deserve a 5 somewhere, but since it's just all around solid, I'll put it here."
"O- this ale has alot in the bottle and i found it quite tasty and a pleasure to drink it was sweet,hoppy and bitter ...just great"
"Overall this is a powerful, raw brew that kicks tail. The intense bitterness was not really my thing, but this is a beer to be respected!"
"Definitely an arrogant bastard-me no like, but good for you hop heads."
"The next time you're out and feel like being an arrogant bastard, go out and buy an Arrogant Bastard to see how it feels...and tastes. You deserve it and so does the beer."
"Poured from bottle into snifter. Deep red/mohogany in color with small amount of beige head that sticks around. Excellent lacing. Aroma is of barley, light on hops, some walnuts. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Taste is of barley, some hops, earthy, slightly nutty, dry, slightly sweet. This is one of my favorite Stone brews. The ""Bastard"" line starts here."
"Obviously a classic and a really, really tasty and complex beer. I prefer this to the Oaked version (though that's pretty decent as well)!"
"Overall it is worth a try to get a feel for what this really cool brewery can do."
"This is an ale not quite like any other. Bold and daring, it is well named!"
"Pours a deep, dark amber, hazy. Frothy, billowy white head floats on top. Smells of hops, sweet malts, caramel, and has some floral notes. Tastes of bitter bitter hops. Has some distinctive aftertastes, and oily resins. Do not let the sweet scent fool you, it does not come into play in the taste. This is a complex and layered Strong Ale. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky. Overall its a really nice beer."
"O: One of my favorite beers. This offers something new and interesting with every sip. Doesn't compromise on any aspect."
"I'm still confused, b/c I know this beer has more to offer then a B-, will review one day next week."
"This beer is a classic, a pioneer, and ultimately, simply delicious."
"O - A nice, solid beer. I tend to prefer a little more hopness in my beers, but that's not what this one's all about. You arrogant bastard!"
"They got this right when they came up with the name. This is one strong ale. I'm with most people when saying this is a beer that you start with and go nowhere else or end the night with it. It will linger with you and mess with whatever other flavors you attempt to put with it. Smooth feel, caramel flavors and moderate carbonation make this an exceptional beer."
"D- Very drinkable if you are sophisticated enough to enjoy it. Large bottle and high alcohol conent means you can't knock back 6 or 7, but you will greatly enjoy what you do drink"
"overall/drinkability - this beer seem like a chore to drink - just not my cup of tea"
"This beer drinks bigger than it actually is. It's a great presentation of a unique beer. Not a black ipa, not a double ipa, more than a big brown ale or double amber. It's a lot of ingredients that are blended together well to create a stand alone flavor."
"D - For a ""big beer"" and 7.2% it goes down pretty smooth. Overall, enjoyable and delicious."
"The drinkability of this ale for me is very high. I've has this now several times, and every gulp leaves me wanting more. Highly recommended"
"This is my first site review, and first review of anything by Stone Brewing Co. Arrogant Bastard Ale is an excellent beer going down. Has a great start, mouthfeel, and finish. I'm enjoying mine as I'm writing this. Looks wonderful in a glass, has a beautiful amber glow to it, with lots of froth. Poured wonderfully from bottle to glass."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Don't know if you could drin ka lot of this stuff though. IT's a little high on the alcohol content."
"An A? I remember having it on tap and liking it more. The second time around it seemed there wasn't much to it. I can't say I remember it all too well but that says something since it was less than a month ago that I had it last. I remember a slight hint of fruit that wasn't strong enough to really do much for the beers otherwise bland taste."
"D - Very drinkable, goes down well though the ABV is getting up there for a session drink."
"D - Easily poundable ale, offering some nice bold hop flavours with malt undertones. The ABV goes completely unnoticed and the hops are easily appreciated by any hop head. There's a reason this one is top rated... It ain't no joke."
"This is such a distinctive beer. I really can't compare it to anything else and I like that. To me, this is a world class beer."
"the name says it all. even the label is arrogant. this brew is a very crisp ale with slight bitterness and can also be purchased as double ale. the ABV makes this brew a little bit of a kick, and the price is a little high, but the taste and smell dont let you down. it comes in a four pack as well along with three other Stone brews. excellent, thank you."
"Drinkability - Man!!! This beer is really, really good. Unbelievably easy to drink considering the bold characteristics and the high ABV. I don't know how or why I haven't tried this yet considering how popular it is. I definitely won't pass this up ever again. A very, very nice and well made beer."
"D: I am pounding this bomber, it just hits the spot amazingly well after walking around the city for a few hours. I had a slightly rough throat, I would say this is an excellent beer for allergies or a slight sore throat form a cold. When I have a cold I like bitter soothing hoppy beers , this would fit the bill. Exceptional drinkabilty. Amazing beer."
"DRINKABILITY: This strong ale lived up to its name. It was certainly memorable, grabbing hold of the taste buds and not letting go. This isn't the kind of beer you select for a night of continuous drinking. It's a sipping beer, not an easy-drinking one. For a proper purpose, I'd definitely buy it again."
"D - Just not that drinkable for me because of the hops. Gotta respect Stone though for delivering a brew that is exactly what they claim."
"D: Slightly higher ABV but a nice medium bodied beer."
"i think you might want to start with another beer before you have one of these.... otherwise it takes a few sips before your palate can adjust and start to pick up on the nuances of this heavy ale. one of the only beers of it's kind in the general marketplace -- a dark bitter american red."
"D: Spectacular. The name is fitting, i believe."
"This brew is definitely something worth seeking out and trying, it is strong and complex making it exciting to drink, a beer that no two drinkers will describe as exactly the same."
"Pours a deep copper colour, one finger of sticky white head, some lacing on the glass...this one looks mean. Smells of citrus, pine, grapefruit, malty, toffee notes and a faint sweetness are present. Taste is nice and hoppy, citrus and pine notes come out in the flavour, great balance with the malt, dry hop finish with grapefruit rounding it out. Nice full mouthfeel, hop oil slickness and a medium amount of carbonation. Drinks very well, could session this if ABV wasn't so high, near perfect really, solid brew as usual from Stone."
"Aroma included pine and a touch of grape. Taste was unique...intense with malt and hops that went on FOREVER. Insanely complex. Finishes a little bitter and dry but nothing to detract from my enjoyment. A big, big beer but not too, too strong at 7.2% ABV. Stone is really good at incorporating big beer flavor without knocking you on your ass with inflated ABV numbers."
"Overall: A very outside the box product from the folks at stone. I can't wait to move to a state where their products will be more available to me."
"This beer packs a punch and puts light beers in their place. I was skeptical from the big talk marketing campaign, but this beer lives up to its own smack talk. I cannot see any flaws in this brew."
"D: Surprisingly drinkable...though can have the effect of turning the drinker into an arrogant bastard if overdone."
"This beer is best to be enjoyed at a steady sipping pace. It would be a good beer for drinking while chatting with friends at a pub after work."
"Pours a medium dark caramel color with a perfect two finger head. The smell is fruity hoppiness, with a little malt thrown in. Knowing Stone's reputation for big beer tastes, I'm surprised the smell isn't a little stronger. Maybe it will get stronger when it warms a little. Ah- but the taste delivers! This beer slaps you in the face and says 'Pay attention!' Great taste, with lots of hops mixed w/ citrus and some malt thrown in as well. Mouthfeel is nice, and it has a slightly bitter aftertaste- which lingers. The drinkability is good, but this beer makes me want to sip it.. enjoy it.. It feels like an 10-11% beer, but it's only 7.2%. Another great beer from Stone. Everything I've had of theirs has been great, and this is no exception. Cheers!"
"I would love to have a case of these."
"Overall: An aggressive American Strong Ale. Nothing particularly special about it."
"No resin to be found like Sierra Nevada but the greatness of this beer lies in the taste. It's relatively strong in the alcohol department but when I drank this, I would have never have guessed that. I split this with a friend but it would have been pretty easy to finish on my own and even though there are better offerings by this brewer and in this style of beer, one couldn't do wrong with this. I could easily see it being the standby for quite a few people that enjoy craft beer!"
"A very aggressive strong ale, highly hopped."
"4.0 D: I was glad I had a bomber. AB is a solid beer and a good introduction into the world of higher ABV, more flavorful beers. While now it doesn't impress me like it once did, drinking it again takes me down memory lane when craft beer could not have been any more exciting."
"M/D: Medium bodied very creamy. Has a bitter dry finish. Overall, quite good. A little heavier on the malt than expected, but something I would definitely drink again."
"D-May be hard to drink for some but i love the bitter malty sweet flavors that come with this beer. Very good beer. Have a few of these and get pretty tipsy!"
"I don't think I could have more than one of these in a night unless I felt particularly aggressive."
"This beer is my go to. It has a great taste and is easy to get anywhere for the reasonable price. I have had this on draught as well and its even better. If you are an ale fan this is one to try or retry. I would like to try and make my own personal brew similar to this one."
"This is my favorte beer. Its is very drinkable but has the sublte alcohol notes along with an almost nutty essance and overall hoppy charecteristics. Its got great between dark and amber color. Its got a mild head that laces pretty good in the glass."
"Final thought - big but easy to drink huge but not overwhelming. Just wish this one came in a six pack"
"Had this on tap at Mr. Goodbar in Buffalo. I haven't had this for a while, so I had to order it when I saw it on tap. Pours an amber-brown colour with small off-white head. Some lacing down the glass, head remains the whole way. Smells of citrus hops with a huge caramel malt blast. Very sweet flavour, bitterness comes through more in the after taste. Smooth mouthfeel. This beer is a classic for a reason."
"D: Very drinkable! This should be in the firge at all times!"
"This is one of my favorites and to see it on tap was pure mind blowing goodness."
"Overall, my system was shocked by this unique balance. One of the few I had where the taste didn't necessarily follow the nose. Great beer!!"
"Excellent mouthfeel and creaminess. Very drinkable. Highly recommended."
"D - the alcohol blends seamlessly with the sharp flavours, definitely in your face but dangerously drinkable"
"All good. Very good but not bowl-me-over good. So we're clear, this beer is very sessionable and drinkable. I wouldn't hesitate to grab this again but not worth a road trip either."
"Someone picked this up for me as a gift. Very large bottle and very large alcohol content which is always good. I really enjoyed this beer. The only problem with large bottled beer, they get warm too quick and you have to down them. I would rather see smaller bottles, cans so you can enjoy it more."
"Good brew. Very nice amber color w/ one finger head that lingers as a nice lace around the glass. Carmel and vanilla smell on the nose. Mouth feel is good w/ nice carbonation. Alcohol is fairly prominent. Will pick this up again if the price is right."
"Glad i tried it. I wont say id never drink it again but at £12 for one bottle, i definatly wont ever buy it again."
"D - The flavors in this beer are bold.. but I find myself always wanting to go back to the glass and explore those flavors and decipher them. The alcohol is not incredibly noticeable and after the beer is almost room temperature it still tastes great and goes down easy."
"D - This is a damn fine ale, that you will find hard to match"
"Hands down one of the best beers I've had. I almost was not worthy of its arrogance, but I loved it too much to not finish it. This is a beast of a beer. Approach with caution, and you will be rewarded."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Believe it or not, this is only the 2nd time that I've had this beer. I sometimes shy away from purchasing Stone because I've had out of date bottles over here on the East Coast, but this bottle seems fresh enough. Glad I purchased this bad boy."
"D - I could drink it all night. Great on tap. I'd like to have it in a better glass."
"the booze makes itself known, but isnt overpowering. everything i would want out af a strong ale"
"D - I would say this could be rather drinkable for me on the right day. if bitter beers are you're thing you'll definitely love this. it's not for everyone. ""you're not worthy""."
"This was a very drinkable beer, wish that I was not driving and could have had another."
"The CPJ"
"Oíche mhaith"
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the piney hops and the caramel malt. The flavor is very hoppy and high in alcohol. I get a lot of pine and orange, as well as some caramel malt. Still, this beer is all about the hops and the bitterness is about medium. Fairly boozy overall. Low carbonation and medium mouthfeel."
"Very drinkable. Goes down easily. Happy to sip on this one and will be happy to buy it again."
"Very drinkable, for me it got better with every sip (and not thats not because of the high alcohol :P ) Worth sitting back and enjoying on its own, not really one you want to pound or have too many of. A bomber of this is enough for an enjoyable evening with a good beer."
"D: They served this in a 20oz pint so I took a decent amount of time with it, but it's a very easy drinker at this point for me."
"D- Fantastic drinkability, every time i put this beer down, i pick it right back up again. I would go well out of my way for this beer if it weren't available to me."
"Overall: See taste and drinkability. Very good, but not quite what I hoped."
"Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured red-orange with a two finger very light tan that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, sweet hops, and caramel. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, dark chocolate, sweet hops, and slight citrus. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was brew was great. Had a very excellent flavor and good aroma going on here. Both the flavor and aroma were very well balanced and quite complex at the same time. Not too much missing here. A must try if you have not already."
"D: Ready for another halfway through the first pour. Complex taste yet smooth for the ABV. A winner for sure."
"D: Lots of bitterness but not unbalanced, there's lots of malt to back it up. Nice complexity and the hint of alcohol reminds you to slow down with this one that could otherwise go down much too fast."
"This beer poured well as if it knew it was going to look good.. ha.. Beautiful dark ruby red with a great head, perfect carb. Stone really knows how to make a beer smell good.. jeez.. must be dry hopping. This beer was very hoppy but it also had a mellow minty herbal note in there as well to calm it down. Tasted amazing and was quite quaffable, I poured twice (22oz) into the snifter and it seemed as though the first one went down the hatch in no time at all.. It was just that dern good."
"That being said, it excels in every category. I would expect nothing less from Stone, and it doesn't need another review to further cement it's reputation, but this really is a quality brew."
"Hoppy but not out of control, clean, strong pleasant taste, great color, stands up to food well.Mouth feel is nothing surprising, but this should be tried early on by those ""getting into"" beer for the first time."
"Drinkability: Good for a strong ale. It might be good to switch to a lower ABV beer after a while to let yourself cool off, but the taste is something you can keep running with."
"N- reasonably priced vs. the other imperial Stones."
"This is a nice dark ale. It looks kind of like Shiner in a glass but quite stronger. I can only buy it on tap or in 22oz, but its worth it. Just be ready for the kick. It is much stronger than other ales and will knock you back if you aren't ready. It isn't for the faint of heart or weak tasting beer lovers."
"I give two Schlitz about Arrogant Bastard. This beer is an outstanding value."
"D - Tasty finish that makes you want more and no detectable alcohol presence. It tasted absolutely delicious with the burger I had."
"mouthfeel is medium and the beer is very drinkable."
"d: very drinkable. one of my favorite beers."
"Drinkability: This is a fantastic ale. I'm an amateur home brewer and for my next batch I'm gonna try to recreate something like Arrogant Bastard Ale, or at least get somewhat close to it."
"Cheers"
"Overall: This beer is just too complicated for anyone that isn't used to good beer. If you want a simple, easily drinkable beer, this isn't the brew for you, but if you want something to savor that will really make you pause and consider it's characteristics, this is definitely something to look into. I'd say it's a sterling example of the IPA style."
"Drinkablity: Described above. For all the build up I was expecting something more undrinkable. I enjoyed the majority of the beer but would have preferred a 12oz bottle to a bomber."
"Go get some."
"Overall it's an awesome beer that deserves a spot in the top 100. I need to keep this beer around more often."
"Eerie side note: On my second pour, the foamy glob that I noted before actually became three separate globs that looked just like a smiley face. Is that the gargoyle's soul laughing at me for not getting the joke? I must not be worthy..."
"This bottle says enjoy by February 2011. This beer pours a deep, rich mahogany with a one finger beige head. It smells of bitter citrus hops and has a light sweet maltiness to it. It's very earthy. I'm definitely surprised by the level of hops in the nose. It tastes of bitter and very dry citrusy hops. It also has this slight woodiness to it. It drinks exceptionally smooth. I'm very surprised by this bottle. I remember it being a little more harsh the previous two or three times I'd had it. It's a very good beer but I couldn't drink more than this bottle. It leaves this strange, earthy and dry after taste that I'm not a fan of. It makes even finishing the bottle unappealing."
"Stone always knows how to properly hop their beers in the manner they describe it... I'm never disappointed, when they say its going to be bitter or very hoppy it always is. As soon as you smell it you get that trademark Stone brewery pine smell with citrus and the sweet malt in the background. I love how Stone is one of the only breweries that gets that pine hop resin taste and mixes it real well with citrus hops. The malt really comes into play in this beer and almost reminds me of what some breweries would call a black ipa. It kind of reminds me of a hoppier Victory Yakima Glory but better. The roasted malt blends in so nicely with the resinous hop bite it gives. That's the word that sets Stone IPA or highly hopped beers aside from other breweries highly hopped IPA's...resinous. Nobody can ever complain they don't get an amazing hop flavor and bite unless its past due its expiration date. This might be even hoppier than their regular IPA they brew mostly because of the different hops they use and the roasted malt coming together for a more bitter bite. Amazing beer that regular beer drinkers might have a hard time drinking because of the intense amount of flavor this has. Beer never tasted so rich, potent and good. I don't think this brewery can make a bad beer. My favorite California brewery."
"220z bottle poured into a tulip glass. Enjoy by date is 2/14/11. Pours an opaque reddish brown with three fingers of frothy foam. Good lacing. Nose is a bit subtle. Syrupy sweet roasted malt with a bit of bite from the hops. Full bodied with low carbonation. Drinks like a breast. Not too rich or syrupy in texture though. Nice, resiny hops cut the malty sweetness to make it more drinkable. Nice roasted, almost nutty flavors play on the palate before a wave of hop bitterness cuts through all that to the point that you think your palate might be ruined for the next sip. Bright, bitter hops linger on the finish. Every time I have this I am reminded how good it is. This is the definition of a classic microbrew."
"The beer that popped my ""Stone Brewing cherry"" years ago. Usually poured from a 22 oz. bomber into pint glass. Dark amber brownish body with light brown / off white frothy head with excellent lacing. Interesting aroma - Citrus, earthy, caramel, toast....overall gentle on the nose...but what a surprise thereafter! Taste is predominant bitter and woody, some spice. Bitter is not in a pale ale or IPA sort of way, and much more aggressive than smooth. Palate is moderatley thick and syrupy residue that lingers a good while. Depth and complexity that leaves you guessing and wanting more. A nice beer!"
"Next is the double Bastard and if it's anything like this I'm doubly excited!!"
"D: Really great beer that starts strong and continues throughout. Good balance and quality makes this a go to beer."
"Excellent offering from Stone! If you've never tried a Stone product, this is the perfect place to start. Classic brew! Recommended."
"D-so drinkable, and will drink again."
"This beer is endlessly drinkable and is something I always keep a few bottles of to drink. Fantastic."
"I still find the drinkability a bit dangerous, possibly more dangerous, on-tap. I do like this beer but it really isn't a favorite of mine. If I give the bottle another go I'll re-review because I think my score is a little high."
"Dark amber color, slightly hazy. About one finger off-white head with excellent retention and lacing. Vaguely peppery smell with some fruitiness underneath. Good mouthfeel with fairly minimal carbonation. The hops really come out in the initial tasting but finishes out smoothly. Stone Brewery products just became available in my area in the last year and this is the third example I've tried and is as good as the other two. Looking forward to more of the work."
"Bomber poured into imperial pint. Hazy dried blood red with a small off white cap with great retention and lacing. Smells of burnt sugar, candied fruit, resinous hops. Taste is bitter at first, mellowing out a bit to let the caramel and brown sugar maltiness through. Finishes bitter. Medium body and carbonation. A good readily available brew."
"Overall - Just a delicious, delicious beer. I love the balance in this beer, the bountiful amount of flavors and how the beer moves from sweet to bitter so seemlessly. Just outstanding"
"Beyond being a great beer, this is an important beer in terms of the history of American craft brewing: its roots are in classic English brewing, but it doesn't conform to any pre-established style. Its imitators are legion, its equals few. While its spin-off beers may outshine it, there is no denying AB's mark on the craft beer landscape."
"I never drink it out of the bottle. I have to pour into a glass to see the gorgeous amber color. The smell is unmistakable and I take a whiff before every drink. The taste is everything the bottle says and pairs with many Pub foods. Drinkability makes my first choice if I grab a beer from Stone. A good beer to take the training wheels off and really dive into the beer community."
"Drink- It was very good especially paired with a green chili burger. Last beer of 2010. Thanks Stone for a great sendoff!"
"D= as much as you can 1) afford, 2) tolerate with the slightly elevated 7.2% ABV."
"Buy two, because after the first, you will be wanting another. What a dirty devil"
"D: This offering has a nice hoppy presence, highly flavorful and enjoyable beer. The alcohol is hid well by the hops and is highly drinkable. I can't believe it's taken me so long to try it."
"On-Tap: Wow. A solid and awesome beer that lives up to its name! The flavor is much stronger on the front end when consumed on-tap, the spices and malt practically kicking in the face of any bastard lucky enough to drink a sip. The hops wash away the spice toward the end, leaving just a trace of malt and hops on the tongue. Extremely drinkable!"
"Drinkablity is high for a beer of this substantial character."
"Poured on-tap at the Stone Brewery. The beer is a beautiful red-copper color, with a thin ring of head. It has a malty smell with hops undertones. The flavor is initally a spicy-malt blast, followed by light bitter hops. The flavors are very strong and full, and very well balanced. There is a spicy, bitter aftertaste to the beer, with a hoppy finish. Great beer with heavy, non-apologetic flavors. Kudos!"
"D - Very good American style ale, long on flavor."
"MF/D- Big body, very creamy. Only downside is that it's a palate wrecker."
"Overall, a very enjoyable brew."
"Medium bodied with light carbonation to keep the tongue clean. Fairly easy to drink but the hops are bold enough to keep your pace slower."
"O - Complex and rich without being over hopped. Great job hiding the booze and nice profile overall."
"Notes: Love this beer. If you like beer with big, complex flavor and a good dose of hoppy bitterness then I would say you are 'worthy' to have this beer (even though the bottle says otherwise). Will purchase this one again when I can find it."
"D- Quite aggressively bitter finish that sticks around. More hoppy than expected. Refreshing, but strong. Sipper."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its rich aroma. It smelled very similar to a doppelbock, which plays right to our favorites. It was buttery and roasty and sweetly malty. Additionally, the spiel on the back of the bottle, about being too good for everybody, is awesome. We also liked the fact, as advertised by the bottle, that it is a simple brew, utilizing the most basic and freshest ingredients. This, too, was evident upon tasting, making for an easy going, natural-tasting brew."
"Someone bought this as a gift for me about 5 years ago. It was one of the first really hoppy strong ales I had tried. My appreciation for it has only grown tremendously over those 5 years."
"D: Medium. Lots of good flavors, but the abv could be a bit much after a few."
"Tried it on-tap in a bar. The beer is deep mahogany in color. Aroma is all hops with a slight hint of malt. When you smell it you'll know what's going to hit you: hops, hops, hops. Earthy, woody hops assault the palate right away. Felt like my mouth is burning. Finish is long lasting and all hops. Wow, so good."
"Love it or loath it, this beer does capture a great deal about its brewer: loads of brash character and plenty of clever marketing. And you may be hard-pressed to find a flagship offering with better value, more distinctiveness and this level of decadent maltiness and brimming hoppiness. Love him or loath him, Arrogant Bastard is one cool bad-ass."
"Drinkability: Definitely strong, and if you like hops it is probably up your alley. Alcohol really hits you, though not very present in the nose or taste. Overall, for the price, taste, and fact that it is only in a bomber, I probably won't find myself picking this up too often."
"D: Wow, the bitterness makes me want to sip this one even though the ABV is moderate. Great offering from Stone!"
"Pours a slightly cloudy, red color with 1 finger of head that fades to a thin cap. The aroma is a mix of sweet caramel, brown sugar and a little hint of alcohol. Creamy and full-bodied up front with a lot of sticky sweetness, leading to tons of piney hop bitterness on the back end. The finish is bready and lingering, before becoming more bitter and slightly astringent, but the overall effect leaves you wanting more. This is a big, bold beer with lots of flavor, and quite delicious."
"D- Very drinkable. Don't let the gargoyle or text on the bottle deceive you. This beer I could drink all night!"
"D: The category says it all: strong ale"
"Despite the hype it's really just a dark IPA. Yes it's good, but the name goes a long way toward earning the cult following."
"While the beers reputation is such an established one in the craft beer scene, in my humble opinion, the recipe has been a bit eclipsed by other similar beers in the last few years, but on its own, it is still a solidly good beer, with its flavor profile still being almost unmistakable."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability: Yep. This beer really delivers. Don't be intimidated by it's name or the menacing looking gargoyle on the bottle. I suppose this beer is wicked in a sense that it really has some strong memorable characteristics. I suppose those strong qualities make it ""arrogant"". This is a great example of a well made American Strong Ale. I would recommend this beer as a gift to those who you would like to introduce to the fine world of craft beers."
"22oz bomber. Pours a dark rust color with a thin frothy head. Some lacing. Nice hoppy aroma. Picking up on pineapple and citrus fruits. Taste is a nice blend of hops with tropical and citrus fruit flavors. Malt flavors as well. Bitter aftertaste. This is a full bodied beer that packs a good amount of flavor while not being to boozey. At $5.50 this beer is a great value for the amount of flavor and hops you get."
"D - Not exactly a session beer... I'd say it's a good beer to start off a night with, before switching to something a bit less arrogant. Though depending on the next beer, you might mistake it for water after tasting this beast."
"Drinkability is ok. Expect to finish your bomber and stop after that. Unless you accidentally purchased a double jeroboam and are by yourself on a Friday night, to which I say good luck sir. See you in the afterlife."
"D- Very easy to put down a bomber. No alc presence. A smooth drinker. Made writing a term paper much more enjoyable."
"D: While I don't find it that arrogant or bastardly, I still enjoyed drinking it. One of the harder beers to review for me but it's because all of the flavors are blending well and somewhat unique in my opinion."
"drinkability - the hop profile is tasty and nice, the alcohol is very strong but blends well with the other flavors"
"Almost a tequila sunrisey banded orange-amber-red appearance. Opaque at the darker bottom, lighter colors thin out at the top after the creamy beiege head settles. Sweet, sticky taste of dried apricot with a very malty, long bitter finish. Medium body with mid-range carbonation. Alcohol is very subtle for a high ABV ale. An exceptional brew."
"This beer wastes no time in making its presence known. The hop flavors hit you as soon as the beer enters you mouth and is balanced nicely with a malty finish."
"The taste is good but a bit overwhelming. It has a very distinct syrupy feel at first, rather malty and driven to the total, extreme opposite of what overtakes it within seconds- an extremely robust bitterness that almost numbs the palate instantly. While it may hold for a solid pint, the IBUs certainly hit me super-hard and it would be tough to sip and session this one. It also lacks the distinct woody musky feel the OAB has, which certainly makes it a better beer in my opinion. Nonetheless, this one is quite a worthy sample of its style, and a good beer by Stone."
"Fuller medium body, a little dry and sticky feel, but very drinkable. The alcohol is masked really well, and you can easily have a couple of these before feeling satisfied. One of my favorite regularly available strong ales."
"Aggressive pour into a SN pint glass yields a spectacular looking two finger head that sticks around, best retention I have seen in a long time. Beer is a reddish brown color, very enticing, the head is beautiful. Aroma is hoppy, with a sweet fruity smell, and some grain. Taste is very sweet and oily, hop bitterness coming through in the end and staying through the aftertaste, the toasted grain really comes out in the taste. Mouthfeel is very sticky, medium bodied. Drinkability is average, this is a good beer but not one I'd want to have more than one or two of in a night as a result of a moderately high ABV and the sweetness"
"Poured a frothy dark red from a 22 oz bottle with ABV, the gargoyle and 'best-by' date on the label. Nice thick head which dissipates very slowly with very good lacing. Aroma is heavy on the hops with hints of sweetness. Taste is an oily mix of hops, sweet caramel notes and more hops. It's a solid, 'in your face' ale. Taste gets better as the beer warms up. Highly recommended"
"Drinkability: Alcohol warmth is barely noticeable; this is one of the more drinkable strong ales I've enjoyed."
"D- Just like it says, aggressive. I love it. Great finish with just enough bitter bite to keep hop heads entertained. I will make this one of my staple go to beers."
"I'd love to pair this with some spicy fish tacos and mango salsa. One day I'll live near the coast.... One day."
"This level of brew could only benefit from barreling/aging. Thankfully, the good folks at Stone have concocted the Oaked Arrogant Bastard Ale varietal. I look forward to trying this particular creation soon..."
"D - I would come back to this beer eventualy, but maybe not right away as there are no individual qualities that demand its consumption over other beers. In a night, this beer is heavy enough where I would have to keep it at a pint or two."
"Cheers..."
"Thanks, Stone, but I know you can do better in the American Strong Ale category if you tried to brew a good beer and not sell marketing with a token beer to go with. Please drop the ridiculous, shameless and unecessary marketing and brew a better beer. Sans marketing, a good product sells itself."
"The beer pours a deep amber reddish color, with a thick white head. The smell is strong, mostly hops, kind of a piney citrus aroma. The taste is well balanced caramel and hop taste. The mouthfeel is medium and I would say this beer is drinkable, and yet one of those beers you'd want to sip."
"i could drink this all night, i should definatly visit this more often than i do for a cheap 5$ a bottle. itll catch up to you quick however. highly recommended. ill definatly be back."
"D- One or two is going to be enough for a night, the high bitterness and medium to high ABV are enough to keep you humble. Overall a great beer though"
"Stone's Arrogant Bastard is a big beer with an in-your-face malty, hoppy aroma, and equally aggressive flavor profile. This is a beer snob's beer, in that, its complexity of roasted malt, west coast hops and high abv challenges your senses. Not much of a head on its crystal clear reddish brown body, but a thick lace will follow it right down to the bottom of your glass. This is an intoxicating beer, both literally and figuratively, that will grow on you with each draw. Not for everyone, but definitely a treat when pulled from a freshly tapped keg."
"D- Aggressive taste, while easy to drink and even subtle at times. The cockiness on the back of the label was justified. There is 7.2% of alcohol in it, but I forgot about that with all the flavor. This drink is quite impressive, and I think I prefer it over their OAB. I'm not sure that Stone has or will make a beer which isn't exceptional."
"I've had this in a bottle before but it's a whole new experience and a lot better on tap. Less of the metalic flavoring and smell when it is on tap, so it's more enjoyable."
"Notes - Excellent offering from Stone brewing company. Also widely available. At 3.49 a bomber its a bargain. Thats only a dollar more than a 24oz BMC product at most convenience stores."
"This drinks and feels good. It's not too high in alcohol, and really doesn't pose issues with finishing a bomber in an evening. This is a fine beer, if you ask me."
"Mouthfeel was a pleasant medium, and drinkability was great. Great brew..."
"This is a fantastic well balanced brew. Classic appearance, good smell, excellent taste and feel. Most importantly, for a big bold craft brew, you can really drink it. It's outstanding and a must have for any serious craft snob."
"This just might be my new favorite ale."
"D - I finally deemed my self worthy enough to bring this beer to my lips. This is pretty much how I expected it to be - a lot of hoppy bitterness without much balance. Pretty good, I don't know if I am worthy enough for it, though. I'd drink it again, but would much prefer something else from the Stone arsenal."
"ok considering the price and availability. Doubt I'd drink a whole bomber myself. 1 pint is more than enough. definitely try it again, but there are others I'd choose first."
"A citrus wonderland along with a carameled fruit malt makes mouth happy. Complex hop profile that keep going and going. Just an awesome brew."
"D: A bomber to myself is a little too much. A little disappointed, not what I thought it would be. The abv is hidden by the onslaught of hops."
"Chad"
"WS"
"Overall this is a pretty good strong ale. A little much on the bitterness for my liking but definitely a great brew none-the-less."
"kinda expensive but its worth it in my opinion."
"Overall: A nice beer. Its warming and well-balanced. A nice rich treat that goes especially well with a full-flavoured spicy meal and nice cold evening."
"This is a really great beer. It pours a thick red-brown color with and eggshell head. the smell is complex, almost distractingly so. It has rich aromas of citrus, pine, and malt. Taste-wise, its bitter but in a way that detracts from the beer; the hints of fruit and barley come through brilliantly. It's thick as to be expected, and its very drinkable for a strong ale. Stone thought it would be a good idea to add double of EVERYTHING and it works amazingly well. Perhaps the only reservation I have with the beer is a blatantly (if not provocatively) condescending ad campaign, which fits."
"Delicious taste, great hop flavor with a slight malt backbone. Smooth mouthfeel makes it easy to drink for hop lovers. Highly recommend."
"For anyone that manages to make it through the entire bottle alive, there is always Double Bastard left to conquer. The first lines of the tome on that bottle read, ""This is one lacerative muther [sic] of a beer. It is unequivocally certain that your feeble palate is grossly inadequate and thus undeserving of this liquid glory..."""
"D-very high, the ABV doesn't detract..."
"If you like Hop bombs jump on this one. Not complex, the malts and sweet notes are there and more present as this warms."
"D: Highly drinkable, and the malty finish keeps you coming back for more."
"This is my first try of this one - I have to say I'm impressed. Poured with a large head that left loads of lacing. Smells of a mix of hop and sweet malt. This is a tasty beer. The hops are the first thing to envelop the tongue with a bit of sweet malt and then finishes with dry bitter hops again. It's a heavier beer but I had no problem taking down a bomber myself. It has a very nice mouthfeel that isn't too heavy and definately not too light. I'd definately have this one again. Now I can't wait to try the ""Oaked"" version I have waiting in my fridge."
"D Pretty good beer, probably not for beginners, interesting and complex.  The higher alcohol is well disquised. 4"
"D- Overall, I could take down a couple bombers on an empty stomach but it does sit pretty heavy."
"This pours a very nice dark red almost brownish color that has a small head with good retention. Thee was some good lacing left on the sides of the glass. Smells hoppy and earthy with some malty sweetness. There are also notes of lemon, lime, and orange zest. The taste of this beer is just great. Its hoppy and earthy just like the smell. There is a bitterness about this beer that I like a lot. I also think the sweetness of the malt cuts it nicely. I also taste some fruity notes in there and some citrus hops. The mouthfeel is also very nice on this. It coats the mouth well so you can really taste it. It has a nice medium body that is leaning a little more towards the heavy end of the spectrum. nice carbonation as well. I find this beer to be very drinkable. This is one of my 'go to' beers, and I could drink these night after night without getting bored. I think stone did a great job on this beer. I cant wait to crack my 3-liter bottle of double bastard and kick it up a notch, but right now I'm having this one and its great. Good job stone. Cheers."
"M: Smooth is the only word to describe it. The carbonation is just right. Medium in body and gives way to a semi-dry finish."
"It's a good beer, but has quite a bit of carmel and hops in the taste. I enjoy a beer with a good amount of hops, but I would have liked a little less carmel taste."
"It's iconic for a reason. Definitely an interesting beer."
"D: I can only drink maybe 20oz then I am done. It is a good beer to have a bottle of, but a 6-pack is too much for me."
"D: Arrogant Bastard has a really enjoyable flavor and a solid mouthfeel that lead to a solid beer that I will enjoy many more times in the future. It's strange, though... maybe I've just gotten so used to drinking big, bold beer, but AB is not nearly the beast that I remember it being when I first tried it. Now I just think of it as a well crafted, solid beer."
"Update: had this again on Thanksgiving night 11/28/13. Bought a 22 at Pinnocchio's in Media for $6. Enjoy by date = 1/4/14. Beer is very hop forward with piney hops (Chinook?) and some accompanying citrus. Bitterness is really in your face like a full -on hop assault. Malt complexity give this beer a great backbone. Excellent beer to wind down with football after eating a ton on the holiday. Great nightcap beer."
"I like this beer."
"D- Good thirst quencher, will look for again."
"Bought this beer in a bomber-sized bottle. Pours a dark amber with a caramel colored head. Smell is deep and rich with lots of malt. Mouth feel is thick and chewy. Taste is potent (hence the name) but refined. Smooth enough for me to drink more of these than would be good for me. Very full-bodied beer well worth the price and availability where I live."
"d - A pretty good strong ale. Definitely a lot of malts coming through in the smell and taste, but the citrus hops come out nicely in the taste to create a little bitterness. Have had many times and will have again."
"Overall drinkability on the Arrogant Bastard Ale at 7.2% is moderate, the pint size is great for this session and warrants a subsequent purchase next beer run. Solid Stone beer and I'm looking forward to trying more from these arrogant bastards (bottle label reads quite funny)."
"Drinkabilty - This 22 oz is perfect for a sitting. This has just enough alcohol in it. I could handle 3 12 oz's, but thats all. After having this, i now know that great lakes Nosferatu was created to compete with this beer, though nos is slighty more hoppy and stronger. Great beer, will drink again"
"I like how the label says that this is an ""aggressive beer"". To those who like craft beer, it isn't anywhere close...however, to a macro drinker I suppose it would be."
"D : It's a favorite for a reason, and that's because it's undeniably unique to Stone. It reminds me of my first taste of whiskey, a real kick to the mouth at first but eventually you succumb to wanting it again and again. Bonus points for possibly the most badass name in beer as well."
"I decided it was time to revisit this, as I have only had this twice before. Once was when I wasn't into beer at all and I thought it was a scary beer. The second time was right after I got into beer and it seemed over hopped. Now I can appreciate it, this bottle didn't seem too hoppy to me. Could be an older bottle, or I may just enjoy hopped up beers now. Over all I enjoyed it. Would definitely buy again, reasonably priced as well."
"Drinkability- Only let me have one double deuce. Cause I could put these down all night long. They just taste so amazing. One of my top three American brews of ANY style."
"This is clearly for the beer drinker who appreciates complex tastes & enjoys something different. Initially I can't say this goes down easy. Don't get me wrong, I like this beer for being different and the taste, yet it is quite bitter at the end for me but this is the type of beer I would enjoy learning to love with time."
"D- arrogant bastard exhibits excellence in the form of a crafted brew. While the alcohol makes it somewhat of a sipper... the flavor and taste counter that aspect. I could take two bombers and call it a night"
"AMAZING! This beer pours reddish black with a foamy froathy caramel head that sticks to the glass as is slowly fades. The aroma is very strong from the beer it is hoppy with toasted grains, a little citrusy and the alcohol in the background. This beer is rich complex, malty and caramel; toasted and smokey. The lingering taste is of citrus, definately grapefruit with how biter it is and dry it leaves your mouth. This is a big bold complex beer, delicious."
"Brown in color with an amber hue and heavy haze. Poured with a thick off-white head that reduced to a healthy cap. Lots of sticky lacings on the glass. Sweet caramel malt, floral and piney hop aromas. Medium bodied with pleasant carbonation. Sweet malty flavor in the beginning that leads to citrus hops in the middle and a pine hop finish. The higher ABV slips in at the end to take the edge off the mildly bitter finish. Very enjoyable."
"It's tasty enough to set aside the fact that it's a 7.2% ABV brew. It's a beer which I have enjoyed countless times over the years and will continue to do so - though I will make sure I don't make the mistake of going a year without having it again."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D- Leaves a weird cloying bitterness that I've never liked about this beer, but the hop fix this thing provides is more than enough to consider it ""DRINKABLE""."
"D - Absolutely. Just a reat all around brew"
"D: Every sip is pure, beer-loving bliss."
"Very good strong ale, had this one flowin' since they had the old brewery off Barham in SM. Good memories for sure! Recommended by me."
"Overall, good beer at that, would probably buy again for another tasting review, but just didn't blow me away- i enjoyed the IPA a little bit more than this one, not bad though, worth a try!!! it is good"
"Very drinkable if in the mood. good red, medium beer."
"Great Beer! If you love IPA's, this will please you. It is a very well crafted beer. The lingering bitterness leaves you wanting more."
"A true American original, Arrogant Bastard is one of the finest beers on the shelves today. Too bad you're not worthy..."
"Drinkability: Smokey, bitter, tart and bold. Have to be in the the mood, but when I am, it's plausable to put away more than one bomber."
"D= This is a solid beer by stone. I drink a few of these a month really enjoy this one by Stone."
"A great, widely available choice. The ""arrogance"" is perhaps a little out of hand though, I think this'd be a great choice for someone just getting into craft beers."
"Wonderful, thick, long lasting, light brown head of three fingers, which remained until the bottom of the glass. This was a first. Rich clear dark red/amber color with a grand action of tiny bubbles making their way to the surface. Color rates a 31 on the SRM chart. Smell is intense malt, wheat, citrus and hops. Very rich balanced taste of wheat and lime with a finish of hops, this stuff is good. The citrus and hops remains on the back of my tongue for a good 30 seconds after the brew has gone down my throat. Creamy and tingly feel in my mouth and back of my throat as I drink. A little pricey, but well worth the cost, as this is one of the best beers I have drank up to this time in my life. This is not a beer for the run of the mill crowd that are happy with lack luster, flavorless ""lite"" "low carb"" brews."
"I'm trying just about every Stone beer this month. So far everything has been excellent."
"its a big bold beer but however i have been known to be able to knock a few back love thid beer and will continue to drink it plus the name is way cool"
"I haven't had this beer in a looong time and, the last time I had it, my palate was so underdeveloped that I could not appreciate how great it was/is. A very dark amber body with a nice creamy tan sticky head gives off aromas of hops, citrus, piney and floral. The taste matches this with sweets and bitters in a medium bodied ale. I love this beer. It's so good."
"D- just an overall solid but unremarkable beer. ""Intro to hoppiness", almost...there are a good bit of hops, but nowhere near as much as in other Stone offerings that could overwhelm someone"
"I would say that this is not the most drinkable beer, especially for its ABV. The complexity of this brew keeps me sipping away. This is Definitely a 'go to' beer when wanting something flavorful and delicious."
"Strong, but drinkable. Definitely lived up to its name."
"A good west coast strong ale w/ lots of bitterness that makes it a challenge for me to have more than a couple. The acidity seems to linger, but it achieves its goal -arrogance. This beer is not for everyone, but I still find it highly drinkable"
"A great beer that I never second guess about grabbing or ordering on tap and one is never enough"
"This is as dedlicious brew, have to try it once."
"A: Decent head with good retention, color is dark caramel with a burgundy tinge, sticky spots down the length of the glass, quite clear - 4.50, S: Heavy on the hops - lots of pine and citrus, though alcohol is relatively low it is noticeable and almost solventy, chocolate covered rum cherries, subtle mint, sweet caramel malts are quite noticeable, very nice nose - 4.25, T: Sharp and dry, lots of pine sap and grapefruit pith, dark fruit like sweetness, significant caramel malts - 4.00, M: Medium body and creamy mouth feel - 4.00, D: Very drinkable, hops dominate, enjoyable all around - 4.00"
"This is what big bold American beer should be-intense, assertive and complex. Feckin ""A"."
"Not really my kind of beer but I have still much to learn of the style. I liked it but I guess I'm not arrogant enough to be worthy."
"A classic beer that everyone should have at least once or have sitting in the fridge."
"This is a Belgian beer without the Belgian yeast. Arrogant Bastard only gets better the longer you let it warm up. The fruit flavors and malt profile are amplified the closer that it gets to room temperature. It's a delicious beer, and I can easily see why so many people enjoy it. Overall I'm quite impressed with it, and I have absolutely nothing to add but ""wow."""
"D - A good beer but it got a little boring to me after a while."
"Being good in all other categories implies that the drinkability is high!"
"D - This is a great beer, everything about it was spot on. Not something you can just slam back, heavy, but definitely one of my favorite beer experiences so far."
"Drinkability is certainly better than a BMC offering, but the bitterness definitely takes some getting used to. It absolutely lives up to its moniker, as this beer is definitely arrogant, definitely strong, almost brutal. Too intense to merit any more than I've already had."
"D: Good Brew, nice for the style. Nicely balanced, a really good sipper when kicking back."
"Overall: A Bastard Everyone can love!"
"On Cask at Thirsty Monk with ""American Oak Chips"" added. Tasted 1 hour after it was tapped and set on the top of the bar. I found the cask to be a lot more mellow (in aroma, taste, hop-bite, and carbonation) than the original Bastard. This special cask version had a buttery taste and texture, with just the merest hint of wood. Whereas one Arrogant Bastard will leave my tongue dry, I was able to down two glasses with tongue and mouth intact. Once warmed up, the pine aroma wafted tantalizingly from the glass."
"Drinkability is an interesting category for this beer. You would think with the ABV that it would go down fairly easily (for me at least) but I find myself savoring it because of all that is going on. I think this is a good thing in the end, and AB remains a craft beer staple."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. I would highly recommend this one."
"This is a medium bodied brew with moderate level of carbonation. Well rounded and overall just a good example of how enjoyable hops can be when done right with a modest amount of malt and moderate abv to back it. About the only thing holding this brew back from being super drinkable is the bold character of the alcohol, there are beers with twice as much abv that are not this forward with the alcohol presence. Regardless, the name of this brew is quite fitting. A must try."
"MF/D: sizzling tingle of hops tickle the tongue but dissipate for a smooth swallow, a sessionable belgian that i will continue to buy. hits harder than 7.2%."
"D - Fairly drinkable, but not for the faint of heart (i.e., not new beer drinkers). This one is for the hop lovers who really go for the hop assault on the palate."
"D - Pretty easy to kill a bomber of this. It's probably too strong in flavor to really give to any kind of newbie."
"Awesome brew. Pours a deep slightly reddish amber with a 2 and a half finger light tan head that has nice retention. Leaves a bit of lacing behind. Smells of pine and citrus, nice hop profile. Taste has the pine and citrus as well, with a touch of grapefruit, but it has a nice caramel malt body that really balances this beer. This is a classic. My girlfriend doesn't ordinarily like really hoppy brews but this one actually didn't bother her. A classic go-to in my book."
"D- Absolutely a great beer. It was arrogant and it was a bastard. A definite sipping brew. But one wonders, can a beer be too intense? The label says I'm not worthy. I felt worthy. But I don't feel worthy or capable of drinking another. My taste buds would certainly tap out."
"D- Again, if a strong, hoppy beer is your thing, you will enjoy this beer; if you prefer lighter beers, most likely not."
"This isn't an all night sipper and its not something you want to down a great deal of. This brew is sure to kick you where it counts but leaves you satisfied and feeling like you know what a true craft beer tastes like."
"The beer is mildly carbonated and goes down nicely with an accompaniment."
"The bottle is pretty cool the stone demon and stuff that's on it. The back description is a bit pretentious but probably makes some beer geeks feel high and mighty for enjoying it. Want to try the oaked version now."
"D - arrogant indeed. right up a lot of craft drinker's alley, and i like them as hoppy and robust as they come but this is just lacking some grace, control. too many bold flavors at once do not leave much room for anything else. hits the spot on certain days, this must not be one of them."
"Overall, this is most certainly a beer I would drink again. It won't be something you could have a bunch of, but is certainly a well-crafted and delicious brew."
"D: Too high abv to session. Don't finish your night with this beer. It'll knock you on your ass. Very interesting though, and I wish I could session it."
"Overall, a good revisiting of an old beer I use to drink a lot of. It has never let me down. I like suggesting this to people I'm with at a bar: they order it and go, ""ugh what is this!"" They take 3-4drinks then they pass the beer to me and I finish it for them free of charge. Then they order their usual swill macro and give me a mouth-smacking look like, ""ugh the bitterness wont go away, how can you drink that stuff."" Ho Ho! No point in saying it's worth a try because it appears everyone already knows that."
"This is a very tasty beer, especially given it's relatively low ABV, and the hops are the main attraction here. I'd probably prefer it a little more balanced but that's not exactly Stone's style."
"Bomber. Floral aroma with a hint of honey. Dark red amber color. Heavy on the bitterness, my friends guess the IBU for this one at 90 I'd love to know it's score. Creamy texture that works beautifully against the bitterness. It's pretty much as bitter as I can drink without being bothered. Very well made hop oriented beer."
"Although it seems menacing, the alcohol is balanced and hidden within the beer, the aggressive flavors are mirrored by floral herbs and spices, and the drinkability of the beer is superb. I would never hesitate to buy a bottle, and soon will post a discussion of the Double Bastard!"
"Drinkability: If you like bland beers this isn't for you. In my opinion it's quite drinkable, and something I would have often."
"D - I don't usually like hoppy ales but this one is great. Goes down easy. Very nice and the palate"
"D - Big beer, big abv and flavors that don't easily leave the palate. I love this beer but I couldn't do too many at a time."
"A very bitter and rich brew that will please hop heads and malt lovers alike. Classic."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being moderate. Drinkability is very good, it's an excellent beer with a lot of bold flavors. All the flavors really mesh well together though and make for a great beer."
"This beer poured a super dark rich mohogany color. Creamy head that took a while to settle. Epic lace on the glass. The apperance looks menacing of things to come. The smell was not that prevalent. Very complex taste. Rich hoppyness yet also creamy. Bitter yet smooth. Malts are also a prevalent factor. The mouthfeel is very tingly and refreshing. The bitterness stays with you. This is a delicious yet dangerous brew. I often turn into an arrogant bastard when drinking this so be carefull memeber of the general population."
"A really excellent beer overall. I should revisit this one more often."
"D - Asmooth beer butthe flavor rush and abv make this a sipper."
"D - I can enjoy a bottle of this once in a while, but I wouldn't call it your typical sessionable beer."
"M/D - a little heavy for my taste, yet very tasty"
"Will drink again, but not too often because the taste is almost too strong for my liking."
"man i love this beer, and the double bastard is awesome as well. here's to ya'."
"Overall, a very solid brew. I'm sure if I had this 10 years ago I would've been blown away by it, but as it is, it's very well made and still relatively unique."
"D - Crisp and smooth yet complex flavors might hinder the drinkability as well as the higher ABV."
"One of my most favorite ales by far. Good job Stone Brewery"
"Poured this from a bomber into a tall glass and had it while I finished cooking a burger. It was initially a bit harsh, but the more I drank the more I liked it. It was chilled but not ice cold when I poured it, and I liked it more once it warmed up a couple degrees. Worth another try for sure."
"drinkability: excellent in my opinion. decently balanced brew. wouldn't session more than one of these though."
"D: i could have one or two of these and be done and happy. the higher alcohol content says not a session beer for me"
"Clear cherry wood color with a one-finger, foamy off-white head. Grapefruit, spice, orange and caramel aroma. Big caramel and piney hop flavor with spicy hops lingering in the mouth. Medium-full body with moderate carbonation but a bit sticky and syrupy."
"D: drank very good and I feel like this beer is way better on tap and goes good paired with crab, calamari, and lobster."
"D- Nice, I enjoy drinking this beer on occasion, more on colder days/nights because you notice the alcohol."
"Deep Amber not at all cloudy. Head was two fingers for 2 minutes, then gone. Didn't know what to expect from the smell, you get a faint hops aroma. First sip, a full on assault on your mouth, very hoppy at first, but after a few sips it becomes more complex, once you get past the initial hop attack. Unlike some other beers that are very hoppy, there is a nice sweetness of malt comes through about half way though the glass. Really good with extra sharp Cheddar and whole grain crackers. As intense as this beer is the 22 oz. bottle is the perfect size."
"Stone Arrogant Bastard Poured a very dark amber color, with a small head that didn't with the beer. It didnt have a very strong smell, but a very heavy smell. It tasted very strong, very heavy and very very bitter. It had a very strong flavor, and the bitterness made it hard to drink. Overall a very good beer."
"Pours a pretty, dark red, almost brown color with a huge manilla head. The scent is very hoppy with a bit of citrus fruit. It kinda has an apricot scent to it (reminds me of a lees intense Aprihop scent). At first the taste is very subtle, nice and smooth...then the hops hit you. The hops, with citrus and apricot are very well balanced. The bitter hops seem to linger in the aftertaste for awhile. The malt presence is more at the beginning of the sip, and diminishes with each passing second. Alcohol very well hidden. Loving the way this one is tasting right now. The drinkability is very full-bodied...but just a tad on the watery side at the beginning IMO. Drinkability is VERY HIGH!"
"O: I enjoy drinking with the bastard. Intensely hoppy and pairs great with this baked potato pizza...or anything for that matter. Its not too expensive, its because you're too cheap."
"D - Drink on and enjoy, this is the beer that made me become a true beer fanatic!"
"D - No this beer is not very drinkable. I could only have one but maybe some people could have more but not me."
"very drinkable and superbly crafted. i credit this beer as my introduction/gateway to hop bombs and imagine a lot of other people can too. worth seeking out if you haven't had it yet."
"This is a strong and malty beer. It's thick, and dark brown. Little hop presence on the nose, but mostly carmel and toffee scents and flavors. The beer lingers in your mouth for quite a while and is quite alcoholic which is hidden well by the maltiness. I wouldn't seek out this beer, but I would buy it if I saw it again."
"I apologize for all you hop hounds out there that cant get enough crammed into a pint glass but the choice of hops is what did this one in. As stated above the nose, appearance and gravity of this one were all good. But the hops. It wasn't that there was too much alpha acid, that I can handle. It was the aftertaste. Too rancid ,very piney. I might have had a bad batch but until i get the chance again my grade will remain low."
"One of the best starters to get a newbie into craft beer."
"This is one of my favorite beers. Deep amber on the pour. Hops Hops and more Hops on the nose, as well as sweet malt and some fruit on the nose. Small tan head in the glass. Oh I can't get enough of this hop smell. One of those things that you can smell even when you are not around it. The taste is one a the great bitter balancing acts of all time. Not saying this is a balanced beer. But like a good hot salsa, it is just uncomfortable enough to make you want to came back for more. Tons of hops and malt on the tongue. Lots of sweet from the malt coming out as well. BUY THIS BEER AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.!!!"
" D- I'm not sure I could distinguish between this and the regular AB but it as a great beer. It would have been nice to have a full 12. oz glass but I'm not sure I could drink many of these in one sitting."
"D- i dont drink this beer that often, but im impressed every time that i do. the growler itself was a little more than i could finish, and the last pint and a half drank the next day had pretty much gone flat. id take another one of these at the next available chance, but i wont crack it until i have a friend to share it with."
"The bitter piney notes hit in the back of the mouth, while a cool almost cucumber taste balances it out for a smoothe delivery up front. It finishes with a lingering bitterness that would be nicely accompanied with something sweet - I'm thinking whoopie pies."
"D- Low, objectively speaking, but great relative to the style. I could have a second right now."
"I could have a few of these in a night. I feel a bit guilty, as I made another grilled cheese sandwich to eat with it. This is one tasty offering from Stone."
"D: Awesome. I would drink it until I fell off my chair."
"A tasty beer with lots going for it."
"Drinkability is all dependent on what is on tap. But I love ABA cause I can find the bombers anywhere and they are relatively cheap. Talk about bang for the buck."
"The texture is outstanding and I could drink a bunch of this beer."
"D- I would rate this as very drinkable but not for beginners or the weak of heart."
"From begining this ale is wonderful, the mouthfull of fruitiness that is lifted into the palate and then the onl thing is the more drinks I get into this wonderful concogtion the less I tend to like it, but either way I still like this drink and in my opinion not a drink for everyone.."
"Great brew, cheers!!"
"D - A pretty approchable beer that's fairly easy drinking, smooth and with the alcohol pretty well masked. Definitely something pretty sessionable for the American craft beer lover. (4.5)"
"Drinkability: Very good beer that impressed me more as my palate has improved since the days when I like this only for its name. I think this is a steal of a deal for about $5/bomber."
"A truley delicious beer"
"Drink- Mine was slightly past the sell-by date, but I don't think I was missing much. I found it to be really good overall. Will try again for a fresher batch. Will definitely add to my favorites list."
"Pours an amber brown color with a huge head and plenty of lacing. Smell is mostly malt, and some hops noticable in the aroma as it warms up. The taste isn't so malt-forward like the smell, with strong hops bitterness and a little nuttiness. Really nice chewy mouthfeel, and a bitter aftertaste. Great beer!"
"d- the two glasses worth that comes in a bottle is the perfect amount. not sure i would want more of this than that in one sitting. would gladly drink another."
"Price = $5.89 at DAG's"
"Pours a dark amber with a thick off-white head. Aroma is sweet hoppiness. Taste is bready malts up front, hops are predominant (a little surprising in a beer this dark) but the balance is nice if decidedly hoppy. Frankly, this is an overflavored beer. That said, the flavors are nice, such as they are, there's no subtlety possible here--it's massive malts and more massive hops. One of these is fine, thanks very much, but it's nice just like a Spanish coffee from time to time."
"pours a cloudy brown copper color with average off white head and good lacing that recedes at an average rate. soft carbonation and a harsh piney hop smell. bread like malt flavor that is moderately bitterand a little tart. medium body with a tart bitter finish. slick texture that goes down smooth. dollar for dollar probably one of the best brews out there. if you have any doubt hit up ""jrish"" and i'm sure he can persuade you."
"Drinkability- 4.5 out of 5. This stuff is amazing. It has every right to be arrogant. With its complexity and wild flavor, I'm honestly surprised they pulled this off-- surprised and pleased. At $4.49 for a 22oz bottle, it's a damned good deal for a beer of this caliber. It's good enough to make a session out of, but take it slow; a beer like this needs to be enjoyed."
"The first friend you make in hell."
"D: Good flavor, good balance. I like the flavoring and bitter one-two hop punch. ABV a little rough to be too drinkable (in quantity)."
"The color was A nice dark carmel beer pouring into my mug with a lot of head. A great flavor with a good portion of hops to start out then blending into a sweet fruity carmel flavor. A top 10 beer on my list."
"D: This is one of the best beers I've ever had, and if Stone distributed to Missouri, a beer that would regularly be in my fridge. Extremely complex and delicious."
"D: Because it's so big, I don't think I could drink more than a couple of these in a night, but boy does it go down smooth."
"Notes: I think this is a really great beer, but I split a bomber with two other people and feel like I've gotten my fill. This is definitely something I would seek out again, but not something I would drink in large quantities."
"Overall/notes - Another really good beer from a really good brewery. I actually had this once long ago, before I had any IPAs that I enjoyed, and was put off by it. This go-round was much more pleasant. In fact, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed drinking this beer. I guess I'm an arrogant bastard after all."
"TASTE: Just like the aroma - an intense blending of bright hops and rich, sweet caramel. They dance back and forth together in a complex, bitter, and entertaining way. Finishes appropriately quickly in a luscious way that demands another sip."
"How has it taken me so long to review this bastard? It pours a translucent dark tawny brown, capped by a finger or so of ecru foam. The nose comprises a good amount of citrus, grapefruity, and piney hops backed by a strong backbone of solid caramel. The taste holds similar characteristics, though all elements are taken to a higher level: hops are large, the maltiness is large...maybe I'm not worthy after all, as I'm not sure how else to describe this flavor combination. The body is a hefty medium, with a moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a beast, yes, but not as beastly as it would have me (or you) believe."
"The arrogant bastard is just what you would expect from Stone. A good go-to beer when you need one, the AB will never let you down."
"D- I am about half way through a bomber and am really struggling to finish this. Not a whole lot going on and could use some cooling off."
"SERVING TYPE: BOTTLE"
"D: Although I said above that I find the taste similar to Yakima Twilight, Arrogant Bastard is more drinkable due to the lower ABV. Now I must try the various aged versions..."
"Pretty good. Pretty, pretty good."
"Drinkability - Its the perfect beer to get home from a long day at work and to just sit in your lazy boy recliner and relax."
"Never cared to much for the darker strong ales, but this one I liked a lot. Could easily see picking up a bottle or two with friends. Great beer, especially for the price of it."
"Strong ales are not my favorite, but this is the best I've had in this category. Very drinkable and the alcohol is masked very well."
"Starts off thick, creamy and malty. Very aggressive flavor here. Next comes a strong rush of hops and a pretty bitter finish. A little overpowering, but a nice full flavor. You're certainly wearing out your taste buds with this one, but it's tough to have a session full of these. It's the type of big beer that Stone is known for."
"Drinkability - For those that aren't into hop bombs, beware. This is right up my alley, although I'd never want to follow this up with anything as it has a pretty aggressive taste. One bomber was plenty as the hops beat my taste buds pretty good, although the bomber went down surprisingly fast. Good work, Stone!"
"I am not worthy."
"Drinkability- I'm set with one twenty-two oz of this."
"D. An easy drinking ale that doesn't taste 7.2%ABV. Really nice but the alcohol content would slowly creep up on you if you had a couple. Another sublime ale from the guys at Stone."
"It's full body and fine carbonation provide a rich and smooth mouthful. In every way, this full flavoured ale tastes as big as it promises to on the back of the bottle. When I first tried it almost two years ago it was overpowering to me, and today I can say I love it. Great beer."
"D: Very good. This is a vast improvement on a pretty good beer to begin with. Mouthfeel aside, I was extremely impressed with this version of Arrogant Bastard."
"the first taste is wow this is really a strong ""this is the way beer is supposed to taste"" euphoria..then briefly ""oh wait, railroad tie in the summer sun""..then quickly ""ew, it may get sweet - NO the bitter killed that completely""...now just after it goes down the bitter is finishing back into that original wonderful ""way beer's supposed to taste"" lingering...ok, i'm ready for another swig right now! toward the end of the pint tho, i've had enough cuz it accumulates more bitter as you go...but just as well, because by then you are appreciating the substantial kick and the great ride that this bottle has taken you on."
"As I poured a 2nd glass from my 22oz bomber I realized I really was not worthy of this brew, and I feared I wouldn't be able to finish it. but alas I prevailed, and it left with me with the best buzz i've ever gotten from a single bomber which leaves me suspicious of the abv, it seemed much stronger than %7.2 because it kicked my ass. 22oz was plenty for me."
"D - Just what the AB needed, IMO. The citra dry hopping is done nicely to just a touch of complexity at the end palate to both aroma and taste. Excellent drink."
"After all I have heard and read about this beer I had to try it. Stone has not let me down in the past with their IPA and again they came through with this one. The only complaint I have is the price but you pay for good beer."
"Pours a redishe tined brown, cloudy with minimal off white head. Scent is of citric hops with a pretty niced carmel backbone as well as roasted nuts. Taste at first hits you with aggressive grapefruity hops but quickly turns to the sweet carmel matl side. Evens out with a nice fruity and nut finnish. Medium bodied, lightly caronated, juciy in the mouth. Citra hops are catching on quick and they work well here, i wish the maltyness would be turned down just a notch."
"D - A beast, but compellingly drinkable. This was gone a lot quicker than I'd intended."
"D: Very easy to drink regardless of the good level of bitterness."
"D: Wow, great example of a strong ale. I would place this in front of other ASAs."
"Drinkability: Gotta take it slow on this one. The 1 pint lasted me a good hour and a half."
"D- This is an amazing beer that I grown to love over the years. This was my first craft beer that I purchased when I was 21 and I hated everything about it. Now it had become one of my favorites. One bomber fills the chalice twice and that is plenty for me."
"A fine ale."
"Glad I've had it from a tap and it is still the only Strong American Ale I've reviewed so far."
"But just because I am not crazy about hops does not mean I cant tell a good beer when I drink it."
"D- it will be dificult to mi to drink more than 2 of this one."
"D - Decently drinkable beer. Bitterness factor may limit the number of these brews you can have.  "
"Overall this beer has some very strong flavors but they play well together. It has a long finish that makes you remember the hops but the flavor is not just hop-minded, there are plenty of interesting things happening with the malt as well."
"d - Usually these unique beers aren't very drinkable because they're so strong, but this one just goes down so easy. The flavor is so unique. Shame these are 5 bucks a pop."
"Overall I like that tap version much better than the bottle, to the point where this is all I've been drinking when I go out anymore."
"Very rich grapefruit aroma that is fully realized after tasting. Slightly above average carbonation fills the mouth nicely with citrus, caramel, and a nice hoppy bitterness that dominates the finish and grows over time. Really makes you slow down and appreciate this one!"
"verdict- A great tasting beer, and certainly an experience you want to have once (and maybe again), but I don't really see this as more than an occasional drink."
"overall: this is one of the best high standard flagship beers out there its very complex and enjoyable and full of flavor. the other arrogant bastards are top notch as well but this one is just fantastic. drink this on a hot day or a cold day it goes with both cheers to stone for this mighty brew."
"Bitterness got to me a bit - drinkability takes a bit of a hit as a result. Just lingers a hair too long for me. Still, an all time classic that has held up pretty well."
"Bomber to a pint glass. Pours very dark red with a huge fluffy beige head. Shrinks down to 1-finger and stays there the entire beer, excellent retention. Leaves decent lacing. The smell lets out some nice citrus and dark fruit, and some bread scents. The taste is great - hops are assaulting at first but seem to hold back after the first few sips and let the flavors shine. Pine, caramel sweetness, candied bread, grapefruit and plum are tastes I pick up. There is some alcohol bite that shows up now and then. The mouthfeel is good, but feels a little watery and unbalanced after having Double Bastard not too long ago. Still there is a nice creaminess. A bomber is plenty for this beer, lots of palate assaulting going on. I love this beer, I will continue to get every once in a while."
"Notes: This is one very tasty, well crafted flagship beer."
"D - Like a average Sierra Nevada product. Yes, a average. I didn't learn me not no nothing in school. That didn't stop me from preparing for the BA misspelling bee, with my eyes on the prize."
"Reading all the reviews of Arrogant Bastard I was expecting this wonderful beer full of flavor and easy drinkability. Arrogant Bastard is full of flavor. Grapefruit and hops are the most powerful. At first the taste is smooth and once finished a bitter taste lingeres in the back of your mouth. From the outside Arrogant Bastards looks and smells amazing. Dark orange/brown color and I found it to smell very sweet with some hoppy overtones. What set me back was the drinkabilty toward the end of the 22oz bottle. It started to taste like dandilion flowers and had warmed up a bit much. Needless to say for anyone looking for a strong ale with alot of flavor Arrogant Bastard hits the mark."
"I've been drinking this one since the late nineties, back when Stone was a tiny production brewery in San Marcos. Figure it's time to finally review it. Pours a moderately hazy chocolate brown color, with ruby highlights and a big mocha head. Aromas of milk chocolate, piney hops and just a hint of citrus. On the palate, I get a lot more piney/citrusy hops, along with caramel and cocoa. This has been a really good beer for a really long time. Very nice."
"D: Pretty good for the style."
"The first time I had this beer (several months ago) I was definitely not prepared for it. What I have to say is that I actually really like it this time around, especially that bitter and dry bite it has. I think Stone has some of the best priced bombers and the quality of the brews is always excellent and refreshing. However, given that it does have the bitter and dry bite, it receives a lower drinkability factor because it requires more time for savoring and sipping. Excellent beer, a must pour if you're a beer lover!"
"Drinkability - It's ruinous, but at the same time very drinkable. I feel like I could drink a few of these, but then again I know my tastebuds would just be ruined."
"D-Wont do it again. Cant stand the headache hops."
"D - I can down a bomber of this one, but the bitterness gets punishing and palate-destroying. This certainly is a bastard in that respect. An American classic - marrying the strong a German-influenced malt tradition with American bruising hoppiness. This should be one of the beers representing the US on the global market instead of BMC."
"[Drinkability]: Drinkability is good."
"EDIT: My ratings gave this an A- which is cool but I was thinking B+"
"Drinkability: As noted above the beer has a bit more bottle age than I'd like for reviewing something with this much reliance on hop flavors. However, I did enjoy it and found one sip followed another easily. Although this will not go on my list of beers to have regularly, I'll probably be having this one again and I'll be trying it much fresher next time and will modify this review if needed."
"I feel that if you read that back of the bottle and like what it says, you will love this beer!"
"This is a very nice beer overall. In earlier days, it stood out as unique and bold. Since then, many stronger, more extreme beers have been recognized as more potent, and perhaps, flavorful. On the whole, though, for the price and availability, as well as overall quality, Arrogant Bastard deserves its place among the legends of the industry."
"D - Well since I have 9 more bombers relatively high"
"Medium body with nice carbonation in the mouth allowing the late bitterness a decent entry onto the palate. Its not as sweet as you'd think but the mouthfeel is consistent and good. Of course, what can I say about Arrogant bastard that hasn't already been said, its a great beer from a great brewery and of course I would have it again."
"Aside from the hops, the beer is fairly easy drinking and I did not notice any alcohol warming from this beer, as I can usually spot with high ABV brews. I tend to shy away from high ABV beers during the summer, but this will be something that I will definitely have on hand during the cooler months of the year. Thank you Stone for finally coming to Chicago!"
"D: Yeah, this is a new permanente on the session roster thank you for finally bringing Stone to Illinois!!!"
"Nice beer, easy to drink for a strong red ale. I enjoyed it, though I think for a similar style I prefer a few others like Bear Republic's Red Rocket Ale."
"D: If you can get through the hoppy bitterness, it's relatively easy to drink because the alcohol is rather well hidden."
"As I said at the beginning, this has long been a favorite of mine. It has not lost a bit of its appeal to me over the years. Gotta love Stone."
"Pours a dark red leather with a nice khaki colored head. Leaves a nice thick lacing. Smell is very hoppy with hints of toffee malt which makes for a great aroma. Medium bodied taste filled with caramel malts and floral hops, a slight hint of citrus pops off as well. Very drinkable, might go grab another bomber as we speak :P Overall an awesome beer that lives up to its hype. Nice job Stone"
"D - This is what makes the beer. It goes down smooth, and leaves you wanting more. Good for the beer."
"This my second experience with this beer, the first of which was on tap at a local pub. Pours a ruddy amber with ~2.5 fingers of off white head. The nose speaks to the heavy hop experience that is on its way. Flavor follows nose, though as the beer sits out a bit and warms the malt makes itself known, in a little way. Medium carbonation with medium body. Not a bad beer, if you can stand the hops."
"This beer is full of flavor and deep. Its enjoyable and slightly refreshing."
"D: Starts strong, but doesn't quite hold out. The more I drank, the less I liked it. Still, all around, a very solid choice. Avoid if you dislike hops. Not a problem for me though, and I think grab another someday soonish."
"This brew is simply outstanding. Though clearly a clever marketing gimmick, the folks at Stone Brewing Company have every right to be arrogant about this product. The diversity of flavors and aromas might not be for everyone, but if you appreciate extremely well-made craft beers, you will find this beer exceptionally enjoyable. I was thoroughly impressed and I will try more beers from this brewery in the future."
"D - Drinks well for 7%."
"I would purchase this beer again. It is the type of beer I can enjoy and relax with after a 12 hour shift at work."
"The Arrogant Bastard pours a deep amber color with a two finger creamy beige head that sticks around for a while and leaves a nice thick lacing on the glass. A sweet floral aroma comes up from the glass along with toasted malts and toffee notes. A wonderful balanced nose. When you finally take a drink you get a big dose of hops but they are not overbearing. Backing it all up is some nice caramel malts. A strong bold aftertaste that leaves your mouth sticky and dry for a long, long time. Drinkable yes, sessionable maybe not. At 7.2% it's a great beer to sit down and split a bomber with a friend. It's an aggressive beer so it's not for everyone."
"This beer is aggressive. I can't think of any other word to accurately describe it, and the brewery said it best. This should really come in six packs."
"Overall, this is my first Stone beer, picked up during a trip to Wisconsin to restock on New Glarus. This is complex and delicious, and I'd love to have it again."
"This is a pretty decent brew by the stone boys... I can't wait to try the oaked version."
"Drinking this one that is two weeks from ""best by"" date, so the hops are in the forefront. It's a good drink and can imagine it pairing nicely with a big flavor meal. But not necessarily a brew I'd have a session with."
"Drinkability: It's a little big, but everything is going right with this beer on tap! Great on a nice warm night as the bitterness is refreshing and it's a tad filling, but it's not going to slow me down. I could drink this all night."
"D - Very easy to drink. I had a couple of these and really enjoyed this beer more than the Double Dry-Hopped IPA."
"The appearance is a nice red/amper toped of with a gostly white, fluffy head, of which leaves a thick and scatered lacing. The smell is alchool and a tuch of hops; I will admit my sense of smell s not very good. The taste of the beer itself is wonderfully balanced palate of alchool fussle oils. I searved it at room temp. and that may be why I get mostly alchool, but that is not bad. This is a strong ale. Even if I cannot taste the hops or grain, they are there working together to balance the beer as a 12 year casking would for wiskey; I suppose that is why the barrel aged version is acclaimed strongly. The mouthfeel is slytle sticky but not unplesant at all. I am not a fan of strong ales but I could drink this from sun rise to sun set."
"I have had this so many times. I was drinking it before I even started pouring my beer and loved it every time. This is a good go to beer and a go to beer you can rarely beat. Thanks Stone!"
"I drank it on the go to wash down a hastily eaten turkey wrap. I'm busy and self-important. It's the arrogant bastard in all of us I guess."
"Reviewed from my notes. Served on-tap in a PBR pint glass (a nice touch). The beer has a translucent brown hue and a small, bubbly tan head. There are tiny bubbles rising within the glass. As I drink, it leaves behind some great lacing. The aroma is equally impressive. There are a lot of musty, grain-like fresh hops. Yum. The AB has an intense hop flavor on top of a good, slightly sweet malt base. It's an all-around excellent flavor. It has a medium body and an excellent level of carbonation. The chill of the serving temperature and the carbonation bubbles are very playful; almost too much so, but not quite. Generally, I like the AB just a bit warmer, but this still feels great. This is so drinkable, considering what a strong, offensive beer this is. I could drink it all day."
"OVERALL: Definitely a bold and aggressive beer, just like the label says. I enjoyed this one, but one bomber is enough for sure. The bitter aftertaste was impressive for sure, but perhaps a little out of place given the big malt profile up front. Regardless this is a tasty and enjoyable beer, and one that I'll definitely revisit, but not something I'll go out of my way to aquire."
"Curious note: enjoy by 3-2-10 is printed very lightly near the bottom of the bottle - I almost missed it and had to look very hard. But of course, a beer of this gravity will age well for years, so I wonder why they are dating them so young? (A good topic for the Beer Forum). I certainly enjoyed it, even though it was three weeks past the ""Enjoy by"" date."
"A beer I can easily drink all night. This is one of those beers that I keep coming back to. No matter how much I explore new and strange craft beers, I can always crack open an Arrogant Bastard and know that I will be satisfied."
"Love it. I don't know if I'll ever have a better beer. I hope I do."
"D - I can recommend this being good with a heavy meal. I had this on St. Patrick's Day with my corned beef and potato feast and it was still quite something. This beer is not for everyone."
"D-very tasty brew, a classic. Finally got around to reviewing the bitterness makes me call it a night on reviewing beers. Very nice balance and pretty big flavors. Everything transitions well and it is a great drink."
"D: Again, I wouldn't want to drink a lot of this in one sitting. I respect this beer for what it is, but there is no getting around the fact that I simply would not want to drink more than a single bottle in a month."
"D - Very drinkable. High alcohol content might limit you to one or two, but doesn't sit heavy and I never get tired of the flavor."
"Drinkability: Exquisite, as usual from Stone. I could drink this all day."
"D - Strength of this beer keeps you from being able to session it, but it is very good and not hard to get down."
"D: Very drinkable, different from the average beer, much stronger."
"Pretty drinkable. My next one may be the same."
"While I liked this a lot, I don't think the overall drinkability is very high. The 7.2% is fairly strong, plus the sensory assault is a little too much. Doesn't make for a good session beer in my book, but absolutely worth a try. I didn't even know this was brewed by Stone when I ordered it, but good first experience overall."
"M/D- Medium-light bodied, medium carbonation. good mouthfeel on this beer. drinkable enough for me to finish off a couple 22oz before they finish me off."
"I must say I have a soft spot for ABA as it was one of the first to open my eyes and taste buds to the craft beer world. But really, you can't ask for a much better introduction. It pours a nice burnt sienna with a thick umber foam. The bitterness takes a harsh bite out of your palate immediately and keeps biting. In fact, as you continue the bitterness continues on for 3 or 4 swallows after you stop. Surprisingly, as you become accustomed to it you can begin to appreciate the roasted malts and even a little sweetness from the alcohol as it warms. Moderately high carbonation keeps everything in check. Altogether, I still love to drink this beer and test friend's taste buds with it."
"Notes: Remains a nice offering on tap, but feels a bit subdued... Too cold probably and the glassware is fair but not ideal."
"Stone, you are my hero! Probably one of the best beers I have ever had, hands down. Body is dark amber, almost a red with about a half inch of foamy white head. Aroma is incredible. It almost made my eyes water. Hoppy to the max with some citrusy notes present as well. Taste is a well balanced hops/citrus/malt mixture that leaves an interesting sweet and sour bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean. This stuff hits the nail right on the head. Aggressive indeed!"
"Pours a dark mahogany with a 1 1/2 finger head that leaves a lot of lacing. Lots of things going on in the nose but the only thing I can smell for sure is the hops. The taste is over powered by hops but there is a presence of malt and caramel. Very nice mouthfeel and drinkable. One of the better beers ive had."
"D/M- Big and strong beer that needs its respect. Deff. Enjoyed when you have nothing to do for awhile."
"Really good brew!! The appearance is super dark the color of the bottle it came from but is nice and frothy with a lace that hangs out the whole time. It is full of aroma with a lot of hops character. The mouthfeel is great very smooth which makes a perfect drinkability though it does finish kind of dry. I really enjoyed it."
"Overall it's hard to imagine anyone who is a fan of big, hoppy American beers not appreciating this beer. I know I do."
"My only complaint is that IMO, this is a beer that requires American levels of carbonation, not cask. Still wonderful though."
"Overall - Complex beer that is well balanced."
"Drinkability: Arrogant Bastard is not for beginners. I recall having a trying time of it not too long ago. Still, despite its rancor for humanity, it maintains as an extremely enjoyable beer. This is one serious package."
"pours a brilliant and sexy copper tinge with a perfect tan head that sits neatly on my beer. picture perfect. smells of caramel malt and freshness. tastes glorious. apples and sweet pine hops hops hops. bitter finish but not harsh like ive heard. great carbonation and creamy mouthfeel. strong malt back. you can just taste the quality put in this brew. always my go to $5 beer."
"Value: $4.50 for a 22oz. Not bad at all considering in a bar you'd pay that for a 22 oz of crud."
" Medium to strong hop smell and a nice sharp, bitter bite that doesn't fade too quickly. Loved the aftertaste and slight burn in the throat. Very strong hop flavor with some malty aftertones. Mouthfeel was creamy and rich with good carbonation that went down smoothly. Drinkability was very good for me with only a light buzz after about a leisurely 45 minute session with a double deuce. I would recommend this to any hop lover who likes a big taste! The only gripe i have about this as well as the other stones offerings is it is very hard to make out the exp. dates. They need to change the color of the ink, especially for those of us east of the big muddy."
"The taste is strong but very good. I was worried that it would be too much to remain pleasant before I could polish-of the bottle, but to my surprise it was quite good to the end - maybe it even got better!"
"Arrogant Bastard. was I worthy? I can't say, my wife doesn't doesn't like you and my son thinks you are pure evil in bottled form, but I could certainly warm up to you. I will say I still have half a bomber to enjoy all to myself!"
"Very rich with sweet maltyness and roasted barley tastes in harmony with an aggressive hop bitterness. The alcoholic bite is faintly detectable, but the beer is very well-balanced and complex; everything fitting exactly in its place. It is medium/full-bodied and lightly carbonated. Very drinkable."
"D- I cant sit and drink this stuff all night like some people can. One pint and thats about it for me. I do like this beer but I am not someone who loves it."
"With such a high alcohol content for an amber, Arrogant Bastard needs to be handled with caution. It's sweetness and hop balance will beg for you to spend a night with your nose in the air, but if you're not careful that same nose you thumbed at light lager drinkers all night long may end up facing the bottom of the toilet. One bomber at a time, young padawan, and ride the complexity of this brew to an appreciation of the best of beers. Cheers mate!"
"I absolutely love this brew, I wasn't really looking for it, but when I saw it, I knew I had to go for it, and I'm so glad I did. Absolutely a great brew!"
"D: Because it's so big, I don't think I could drink more than a couple of these in a night, but boy does it go down smooth."
"It tasted great. The idea of naming a beer ""Arrogant Bastard"" pretty much defines the confidence of the brewery in this ale. You definitely taste alcohol, but more as an aftertaste. The first thing I noticed was the hoppiness."
"Lots of fruit cake sweetness and dried herbs. Pine and citrus resine with a solid malt backbone. Carbonation is there but seems to just carry things along. If there was any less CO2 it might be syrupy. Spicy hops are relentless. Abundant grainy finish with plenty of alcohol warmth and mild traces of coffee grinds."
"Overall I would suggest that you try this beer if you ever have a chance."
"We went out to dinner with friends on a Friday night in the South End at the Stork Club. The only interesting beers on tap were Ipswich Ale and Arrogant Bastard, so I went with ABA as the first beer of the night. Looking back online, I know I've had this beer before, but I am now surprised that I have never reviewed it. Anyway, it was served in a pint glass. Very dark red color. Rich and creamy looking head. Not much smell was noticed. Taste is what you expect from a Stone beer: quality through and through. Nice mix of hops and malt, with a hint of sugar to brighten things up. The only thing that caught me off guard was the mouthfeel. While I liked it, it was much more creamier than I remembered. My wife also had a pint, and she swore it drank like a Guinness. Do they do ABA on nitro tap? Because that is what it tasted like. Didn't expect that, from Stone or this restaurant. Problem with the tap line perhaps? I don't know, but I need to try this again somewhere else to see if I am going crazy or maybe I just haven't had this beer in a while. I liked this beer, but it left me puzzled."
"What can I possibly add to other reviews of this beer? It's fantastic stuff, the kind of beer that converts normal folk into beer geeks. The combination of big citric hops and sweet caramel malt makes a mockery of style guidelines while still feeling utterly natural and refined. The flavor is balanced - big hops, big malt, big flavor. Arrogant Bastard has become a defining beer of the American craft movement and sits as the flagship of one of the best known and most loved craft breweries. All hail Greg Koch."
"D - A nice solid drink. Stone just makes good beer, and this is their foundation brew."
"Poured dark amber with a slight red tint. The thin white head nicely laced the glass. A very powerful hop aroma was evident immediately upon pouring. Floral hops and freshly cut grass aromas wafted from the glass. Massive hops dominated the flavor, with floral and grassy notes. The finish was bitter and lip-puckering dry. The hop aftertaste lingered. No balancing act here, this beer is all about the hops. I liked it though. I felt it offered something outside the norm."
"Notes - This is the first strong ale I've had - and I have to say this makes a great first impression. I also appreciate the humor and smart-ass remarks that Stone puts on the bottle - claiming ""You're Not Worthy."" Little aspects like this makes for a more enjoyable drinking experience."
"D: ive had this beer both on tap and in bottle, i think it drinks better from a tap, but is ok from a bottle."
"D: Just wow. I could put back this one all night long."
"I couldn't drink more than one, maybe two. Not really my cup of beer as they say. Good once in a great while."
"I really like this one, a very well proportioned beer. It may be a little too large in all dimensions for a regular addition to my fridge but I will certainly be back again."
"- as the bottle says, and as some of the other reviews state, this really isn't for the faint of heart. some just can't handle the arrogance. and that's okay. there are a couple bottles of st. pauli girl in the fridge if you want em."
"m - dry and balanced"
"I poured this out of a 22oz bottle into a pint glass. The beer is amber colored with a 2 finger off white head that is frothy and leaving some nice lacing. The beer smells of hops, a little malt, and some floral notes. The beer has a nice pale flavor with hops, malt, and a little bitterness. Their is a little sweetness on the front end. The aftertaste is bitter, hoppy, and lingers for along time. The beer has a medium body and is nicely carbonated. It is frothy and a little silky in the mouth. This is a very good beer and I would be happy to have another."
"D: With such full flavor it is hard to drink a bunch of these, and also dont expect to be able to sample other beers after this one, the hops stick to the mouth"
"Not my favorite Stone offering but a solid very accessible brew that never disappoints..."
"Very bright amber-red ale. Smells of cooked broccoli at first (hope I'm not getting a sinus infection.) Calibrated my sniffer and I get more pine tree and less cooked veggies. Very spicy hop flavor mixes well with what tastes like a complex array of caramel malts. Very smooth. Aggressive hop bitterness is subdued by a pleasant sweetness. Not too bad. Drinkability is surprisingly good. I'm not sure how old the bottle is, it may be a little oxidized. Based on the other reviews I have to wonder if a I have a bottle that is slightly bad. Massive hop burps though..."
"Ive always loved Arrogant Bastard. I will return to review again and improve on this one."
"D: I have yet to be disappointed by Stone, and all of the good things I had read about Arrogant Bastard were completely justified."
"D: Very drinkable beer! Great complex taste with perfect mouthfeel. If I could get this beer at home I would drink it all the time. I will definitely be picking a couple more bottles of this up before I head home!"
"Pours a deep mahogany, rust color with an off white to khaki frothy head that recedes after a few moments of grandeur and leaves a chunky ring of lace as it settles. Smells of caramel malt hit first and hen give way to pine and mostly grapefruit hop aromas. Nice fruitiness from the yeast, some grain and alcohol heat. Later as it warms some nutty smells and phenols are present. From the start it has a very complex taste. At first the boldness tease then beats the hell out of the palate until you submit. Sweet malt flickers upfront but then backs off to the powerful hops (which are part of the classified recipe). The hop flavors start as pine, and then grapefruit follows it up and kowtows to the massive bitter finish. It has a medium to full body, with good carbonation and it is actually quite pleasant once you get a hold of this beast. Definitely a bold beer to drink all night or to pair with mild cuisine, but it might be paired well with spicy barbeque, other seasoned or smoked meats, strong cheese, or something that can fight back in the battle of your tongue."
"D_Would make for a good session but I find this beer unworthy. (Irony!)"
"Had this in the past and realized I haven't reviewed it yet. 22oz bombers poured a dark ruby brown colour with a decent amount of foam. The taste up front if a strong malt hop bite, followed with a almost sweet like floral hop taste. It drinks incredibly smooth and each bomber I had of this disappeared in short time. After watching the beer wars dvd, I had a craving for this beer. Glad I got to try it, and it was quite delicious. Bring on the double bastard next."
"Pours a reddish-hued brown with a nice head and plenty of lacing. The aroma starts out with plenty of bitter, resinous hops as well as some toasted malt and accompanying sweetness. Good caramel scent, which follows through into the flavor with a bit of toffee. Some floral hops alongside the bitter piney hops. Medium-bodied and well carbonated; very drinkable."
"Easy to drink, medium-light mouthfeel. The slightly high alcohol is well hidden. Great beer, and would pair well with many foods."
"I just plain love this beer. It's been a favorite for almost a decade. Yum, yum, yum, keep 'em coming."
" Definetly for the dedicated hop lovers only. From the arrogance on the label I was expecting a beer with big full malt and hop flavors, but all I got was the hops. I didn't really like this beer, but that does not mean it isn't any good. If you like to chew on mouthsfull of hops, this brew is for you."
"I had this beer from a 24oz bottle. The first time I had it, it was a LOT of beer in one bottle. It was heavy and bitter! I was not worthy just like the back of the bottle says. After going back to it knowing what to expect I loved it. It also prompted me to make my own american strong ale."
"D- Very drinkable as long as you respect it. In other words a good sipping beer. Beer swillers beware of this one."
"Delicious and I cannot wait for a second encounter... and then a third... and so on...!"
"The color is slightly reddish and it pours a lighter head that sticks around surprisingly long. The beer is often chilled a little too much where I get it but at the right temperature (maybe out of a bottle) the tastes ring true and if you can get past the aftertaste its really not as terrible as one might think."
"A strong beer, it certainly gets your attention..."
"Goes down easy. I'd like this with some sweet BBQ like dripping ribs. So dripping I call them REE-YIBZ. I could also kill about 4 bombers of this and pass out very happy."
"i like that there are beers in the world which go so far. the size of the beer makes it exhausting to drink, but despite that, the maltiness really holds the beer together. style this in a 5% version and I'd drink a lot more of it."
"D- I could easily have this frequently and this is not difficult given that this drink can be obtained in many places all year round. Definitely a beer I would go to if I had no dedicated beer store near by."
"Cheers!"
"The body is decent, solid and not heavy. Drinkability is not good, this beer is just not very enjoyable. This beer is very popular so my opinion is going to be the minority, but I won't be seeking this beer out again for a while."
"very drinkable. i wouldnt want to have more than 2 bombers in a night, but its always a possibility for purchase."
"What's not to like about this beer?! I purchased the 22 oz bomber at the Navy Club in Seoul and poured it into a wine glass. Nice dark copper coloring and wonderful lacing. Gave me a rich head of about 1/2 inch that took it sweet time disapating. Not quite as bitter as the Ruination so much more likely to be a session beer, however, when you have 22 oz servings at 7.2 ABV I guess one will do you just fine. About half way through I paired this with a Opus Opus X cigar and felt like I had died and gone to heaven. Cheers."
"Other reviews can provide more depth on this ale, but I decided I should start writing reviews at some point. What better place than with this beer!"
"The color, head, carbonation are all good, however drinkability is low because of the extreme bitterness."
"Pours clear with a gorgeous ruby red color and topped with a thick creamy, off white head. The aroma is big and bold scents of citrus hops with hints of malty sweetness. The flavor mirrors the aroma with big generous helpings of citrus hop bitterness balanced well with sweet malt background. The body is light, crisp, and carbonated with moderate levels of fizz. The finish is a gentle fading of the citrus flavors and leaves with just a hint of warming alcohol."
"Conclusion: This is my first ever Stone beer; thanks so much to Tolann for hooking me up! This is not the earth-moving, life-changing experience I expected, but it was pretty tasty and interesting nonetheless. It was actually a fairly balanced ale between the malt and the hops; the hop flavors/aromas were unfamiliar to me (I was expecting citrus or pine aromas, or something earthy or woodsy, this didn't really show a lot of any of those aromas/flavors), however, and I would have liked a bit more in the way of malt presence from an ASA."
"D-It's pretty easy drinking, although I finished the bomber pretty quickly and felt myself becoming a little tipsy. The alcohol is well hidden though. I've had this before and wasn't sure of the freshness then, but I haven't been impressed by this one on either occassion(it feels as though something's missing). I would love to have the chance to have a super fresh AB some time to see if it's much different."
"D: A good beer, but not very drinkable for my tastes. The finish just hangs around too long to have more than a couple."
"Drinkability- Easily sessionable."
"D: Very drinkable. The dry finish keeps you ready for the next sip."
"D - The alcohol is well hidden behind the malty, hoppy joy of this beer. And it's still good despite the enjoy by date. I'd love to have a fresh bottle!"
"poured form a 22 to a tulip it looks dark copper with a 2 finger head that diminished to a bit of foam and lace. the aroma was big of malt and hops. this brew had wonderful body almost chewy it was balanced between the malts and hops but there were subtle flavors that were unable to come through because the this beer is over powered by the hops which need to be dialed down just a bit to achieve more balance. this bad boy was tasty and drank the whole bottle in about 15 min. would buy again and again..."
"Seems like yesterday this beer was blowing my mind. Pours deep brown, seems way heavier than just the regular stuff out at the time. Smell is robust, hops, here come the Chinook. Taste = damn. Are you ready? Takes you on a wild massive malt, massive hop ride. You could call this a weaker barleywine almost. Not quite. But its up there, but so damn drinkable. An American classic, you don't have to just be a straight pale/ipa west coast style, you can incorporate those into the strong ale, amber or whatever you want to call this category. Good stuff."
"D: The alcohol is almost undetectable, this is a fairly drinakble beer, although I had it with food, which filled me up pretty quickly. I was able to drink two of these but I wouldn't have wanted more."
"Overall - Its an OK brew, nothing that gets me excited"
"D- Highly drinkable. Absolutely an outstanding beer. This is the first time I've had it and I will GLADLY purchase it again. Once again, Stone continues to amaze me."
"Overall - I love the approach of this beer (""You probably won't like this beer""). It makes you want to drink it, and with good reason! It's fantastic stuff. The oaked version is even better. Wish I could find 22 oz bottles of it!"
"Pours a cloudy, amber/brown color. 1/4 inch head of a pale tan color. Good retentiona and good lcaing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, hops, slight roasted malt, and dark citrus. Fits the style of an American Strong Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, sweet malt, dark citrus, slight roasted malt, and alcohol. Overall, a good body, blend, and great flavor."
"Verdict: Hardly a gimmicky label-engineered beer, Arrogant Bastard is a true classic that has the chops to back its supercilious attitude. If you're reading this, you should try this beer--just don't give it to your dude-bro friends."
"D- nice American Ale. lots of hops that brings the bitterness. really enjoyed it and would drink on a regular basis."
"D: Very easy to drink despite being so bitter. Has a damn good flavor too with a good hop punch. I would drink this again."
"Pours a dark amber with a 1 finger head that recedes quickly. Sweet nose, with notes of hops. Some dark malts, spice (pinch of nutmeg?), hint of citrus and a dash of hops compose a rather banal flavor profile. Nice and light, yet almost creamy mouthfeel. This is a good craft beer, but not a great one - and not worth the $6 a bomber. Maybe a 6-er is a better format for this very sessionable beer."
"D- Cap says it all: ""Hated by many, loved by few."" Almost too easy to drink."
"Till we meet again"
"Thanks to my girlfriend for picking this one up in Los Angeles while there for work and stowing in her luggage for delivery to me in MN."
"D - This is quite enjoyable and goes down very easy. I'm suprised I finished the 22oz bottle as quickly as I did."
"D: Very drinkable, despite the fact that one of the bottle caps on the sixer said: ""Hated by many, loved by few."" Easily one of the best American Strong Ales out there."
"Pours a nice fizzy yellow...err...wait. A nice dark amber brown, with some sticky off tan head. Some minimal traces of carbonation trickling up. From what I can get from the bottle, I think this one may be from 1/09, so the aroma may be lacking. Still get some strong hops, but it seems the malts are almost winning the battle. Definitely not as hoppy as a Stone should be. Hops are right up in front on the palate but fade quickly to a nice thick malty backbone. Should have reviewed a fresher one I suppose, but the taste is not lacking whatsoever. For being almost a year old, the hops are still kicking but have lost their fruity and bitter punch. Nice and thick in the mouth, not overly carbonated. This ones too drinkable, beware the 7.2% though. It will sneak up on you like a bastard."
"Overall, Arrogant Bastard is one of the best-tasting and most unique beers I've tried so far. Highly recommended."
"D - All 6 dollars worth of the 12 ounces were polished off very easily."
"D - In spite of the talk on the bottle, this is a very well balanced and drinkable beer. I go back to this one often."
"This beer pours a deep auburn/red color. Good head that sticks around well. Laces nicely. First smell. HOPS! haha slightly sweet. very intriguing. First taste malty with good mouth feel followed immediately by.... HOPS!. An almost awkward balance between the two. But to my surprise...I liked it. So many flavors. All that sitting in a wooden bench in the middle of Stone's gardens. Happy Birthday. !D"
"mouthfeel and drinkability: this is the kind of beer that leaves you feeling like you want to without too much syrup feeling in the mouth. it is definately one of the more sessionable beers i can think of. good all around"
"Recommended Music Pairing: Led Zepplin II"
"Cheers!!!!"
" This is my new favorite session beer. Two or three bombers of this and I'm done for."
"Pairs great with Mick Taylor's first solo album..track to note ""Slow Blues."""
"I love most of the Stone beers I've had...this one is another grade-A brew that has been added to the rotation. If you havent tried it...it's a must."
"Poured into a tumbler it forms a nice 20 mm head that leaves lots of lacing. The appearance is fairly clear amber. The aroma is a harbinger of the hop taste to follow, piney some would say. I think it's more on the grassy side with some grapefruit, especially in the finish. The taste is strongly hoppy and moderately bitter with good malt highlights. This is a full bodied brew, a pint of which leaves me satisfied."
"The body is a little slick and oily. Carbonation level is moderate. On to the flavor. Mmmm. Hops! Nice bittering hops right away, but not overly so; this is balanced like crazy. Lots of sweet toffee and caramel even the contest. There's a bit of a charred bread on the finish. Leaves a mildly bitter aftertaste. This is a great strong ale. Why did it take me so long to try this one?!"
"Cheers!"
"Notes: A treat to have this on tap earlier tonight at the Winking Lizard."
"Drinkability is a little disappointing for this brew. Much more drinkable from bottle. Like I mentioned, a little less carbonation than bottle versions."
"Pours a deep mahogany with a finger-thick off-white froth...nice lacing. On the nose are characteristics of chocolate, citrus, pine, hop flowerm roasted malts, subtle coffee, & dark berries. On the palate, the beer has a nice mouthfeel, definite hope bitterness, long finish with a slight hop astringency. Overall a good beer...I remember when I first had this beer, I didn't like it...i was not worthy."
"O: Absolutely refreshing, tasty, delicious beer"
"This is defiantly a ""hey guys try this"" beer, if you know what I mean. This one is best left for the hop heads, but it I really do appreciate it, and will enjoy this bomber to the last drop."
"Pours really dark with little head from the growler. Aroma's more vinous than bottled or on tap: less carbonated and sweet. Lots of raisins, but quite bitter, almost like an amber ale that got tipped into a vat of hops. Without the bubbling buffers in the mouth it's not quite as drinkable as in its other forms, but it's still a damn fine ale."
"Drinkability - I could definitely have a couple of bombers in one afternoon."
"Drinkability:First thing I came accross from stone while on a roadtrip over the last weekend. REALLY enjoyed this, and would buy it for the cheap price i found this bottle at anytime."
"Poured into my Stone IRS glass. It is beautiful amber color with a dense off white head. It smells hoppy, like grapefruit, and a touch of malt. It tastes remarkably balanced. It starts hoppy and then the malt comes through in the end. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. This is extremely drinkable due to its balance. I drank the oaked version a while back and wasn't impressed, I think because its marketed as an extreme beer. I don't think this beer is over the top in anyway, but an excellently balanced beer with a nice alcohol content. I highly recomend this beer and Stone in general."
"A classic hoppy, strong beer here. Warms the soul in the winter months and quite tasty any time really."
"Pours a deep burnt amber with a thick, yellow head and moderate lacing. A strong, floral hop structure in the smell with some roasted caramel malts and an oak-laden sweetness. A bit of alcohol in the nose, which rolls into the taste. Most of the alcohol and hops are present up front, which turns a bit sour on the back end, almost like a rhubarb bitterness that hide the sugars in the beer. Smooth, long draw in the mouth that is surprisingly well-balanced. Sourness from the rhubarb and grains hold through to the end, but aren't particularly accompanied by any other dominant flavors to finish."
"The mouthfeel is heavy but the beer is not very drinkable."
"I could knock these back pretty quickly, and am tempted to--but the flavor complexity forces me to savor it. It goes down very easy, and is one of my favorite beers."
"Honestly, I don't even know what to call this beer. It's completely unique... hence why, I'm guessing, BA has shoved it into the catchall ""American Strong Ale"". It's a bit of bock, a bit of cream or coffee stout, heck, I don't know what it is. Must be tried to be believed. A great beer."
"Nice drinkability. The bitterness in the aftertaste drops it a bit. A solid beer that I could have again, but probably won't rush out and get some."
"Notes: The bottle may say that I am ""not worthy", and that I ""probably won't like this beer""... I may in fact not be worthy, but I damn sure liked this beer! Welcome to Louisiana Stone!"
"D : You will probably end up pissed drunk by the time you realize that you've had enough"
"Because the abv is so well covered by the complex flavors I could drink this one all night long. Very nice beer and a terrific addition to the South LA beer scene."
"Notes: What a unique beer. Definitely light beer loves can't take this aggressive complex malty hop-bomb. A very fragrant powerful flavored yet sophisticated beer. This is one of the pioneers of the creative West Coast craft beers. Outstanding."
"D - Great drinkability, goes down easy. My favorite of this style."
"Aromatic with a lightly peppery hoppiness that is just a bit piney. Malt balance evident in the nose, smells of cookie dough and slightly fruited. The flavor is quickly cookielike, but unique in the sense that it is quite dry, not sweet. Sticky, piney hops then appear and the finish is mildly peppery and sweet. Nice contrasts of flavors in each stage of the flavor profile, making a complex, drinkable brew. Actually probably reminds me more of Stone 13th Anniversary than the Double Bastard in terms of the hop profile. Medium to full body with medium-high carbonation. Maybe a touch bubbly for me. Sticky."
"From notes at the Sierra Grille tonight. Pours an extremely dark red with a one finger full, creamy off-white head that leaves heavy creamy lacing as it is consumed. Smells is surprisingly not as strong as I expected. Smells of malts, dark fruits, hops and a tiny bite of alcohol, would like more strength out of this. Tastes of malts, dark fruits (raisins, plums, some citrus), alcohol bite comes into play but is good for most of the beer (starts to take over after most of the glass is gone). Huge hops up front before any of the mentioned tastes, the typical stone hop taste. The balance is nice before the alcohol takes over at the end, some chocolate even comes into play near the end of my glass. Medium body with decent creamyness and a good balance of body and alcohol warming. This is probably my favorite aspect of the beer. Carbonation is medium and suits the beer nicely, a coat of dark fruits is left on the tongue. Drinkability is good. Good taste, the price was not too bad for the quality. Alcohol will certainly kill this one after a while. Probably get it again for $6 a bomber, nice on tap also."
"A favorite."
"Wow... very tasty and complex brew that gets better as it warms. The ABV is a little high to drink several of these a night, but I would if I could. However, I'M NOT WORTHY. Awesome beer."
"Drinkability: Another superb offering from Stone. Maybe it isnt quite as good as their label seems to claim, but a complex, tasty and well put together beer nonetheless."
"Beer looks very good with a brown, slightly red colour and beautiful head that had great retention. Smells pleasant with a strong hint of hops that gives way to some nice fruity notes, mostly citrusy. The taste knocks me back a bit at first very strong on the hops, but after a few drinks there is a definite malt to it as well, a bit strong for sure, and will keep me satisfied. while i like the taste, the feel of this beer is what really hooks me. It's difficult to put into words, but the best i can say is that this is what drinking a beer is supposed to feel like. A delicious beer and i could certainly drink another"
"WOW. Poured a beautiful amber with a thick, frothy cream colored head with great retention and super sticky. Great lacing. Smell is malty then very oily with hops. Citrus like. Taste starts out malty and earthy, roasty even, then goes to very bitter floral hops. Tremendously complex, excellent beer. I could drink this all night."
"Drinkability - It is a strong ale with a rather high abv so beware! The drinkability to me is scary I think I could drink this until I pass out!"
"Drinkability: What an interesting beer to say the least, this beer solidifies the notion that I am very excited Stone has landed in Connecticut. This beer is balanced almost far too well, never have I seen a strong ale pull off not only the nice, bitter west coast hoppiness, but also the malt balance that really makes this beer a sure fire winner. An awesome concoction from a brewer who I can't wait to experience more of their over the top potions!"
"Very drinkable but this is a strong ale so beware!"
"-this is a very drinkable strong ale and i am glad that it is readily available...even on tap. good beer"
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is an amber color with a thick light brown head that leaves the stickiest lacing all down the glass. The aroma is very complex. There are subtle hints of caramel malts, some slight nuttiness, a mild hint of yeast, and some toffee. The taste is bold. The front is sweet with the light roasted malts and the full body has a wonderful hop balance. This brew has a nutty finish and doesnt in the least over power even with the high ABV. Wonderful example of a beer brewed by true beer lovers!"
"Drinkability: A great beer. This is my first tasting of it. I had heard people raving about it on this site before but had never gotten around to trying it. Hophead beers aren't usually my thing (I know; I'm an oddity on this site) but this is damn good. Try it!"
"Grades out somewhere between Double Bastard and Oaked Arrogant Bastard. You've got to love the bottle design though, don't you."
"My typical preference for hoppy beers is to be light in mouthfeel, and Arrogant Bastard fits that bill. It has moderate-to-high carbonation and is light enough to give off feeling that you're drinking ""hop juice."" Drinkability? Absolutely! This is a damn solid, hoppy beer that I would get down with anytime I could. I would buy this with some regularity if I could."
"Poured a deep amber out of the bomber. When held up to light, beautiful chestnut is revealed. Head is off white (slightly yellow) and left its mark all down the glass. Grapefruity hops is the first scent followed by caramel malts. The hops definitely dominates. I'm a hophead, but I really appreciate the balance of this beer. The odd thing is that right in the beginning, you get a hint of malty sweetness. This sweetness is very quickly overpowered by a nice hit of hops, and then reappears on the back-end. The carbonation is right on tingling the tongue along with the hoppy bite."
"Really well done (don't expect anything else from Stone), alcohol is very well hidden, just a nice big balanced beer."
"Out of a 22 ounce bomber bottle and into my nonic pint glass. AB appears a hazed crimson chestnut color with about an inch of thick off white foam. The head leaves a noticeable lace in its wake. Nose and flavors are of lemon peel, resinous pine, all kinds of grapefruit: white, red, just about the right amount of caramelized malt to pull it all together, toasted biscuits. Nearing full bodied for the style with ample carbonation. Tasty, bitter stuff."
"Drinkability: No need to rush through this one. Sit back and enjoy the ride as the beer warms up and the flavors come out. One tall boy should be a nights worth of moderate drinking when you're just chillin out after a busy day."
"D- This has always been and will be one of my favorites and I can always come back to it. Would be a good beer for someone who wants to try something big and bold."
"Taste is exactly how it smells. Delicious hop goodness throughout the mouth. You can really taste the pine characteristic to the beer, alongside the breadiness of the malt. It's like a piece of spicy bread with a sort of cinnamon quality to it. The flavor then follows to the sweet and sour citrus of the grapefruit and short astringency of the hop bitterness that lingers for a couple of seconds in the aftertaste before dissipating. And finally it all ends to the gentle warmth of the alcohol left in the back of the throat. The mouthfeel is just right, with a medium body and enough carbonation to the brew. The bitterness isn't as discouraging as I had originally thought when I first tried it, so I say that the drinkability is excellent. And it's definitely more of a drinker than a sipper. Such a reliable strong ale, I can always go back to this brew. Thanks again, you Bastard! I still am not worthy."
"This is a great and unique beer. If you like this definitely try the Oaked and Double versions, both were excellent."
"This beer pours a ruby-brown color. The head is a quarter inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of grapefruit, citrus, and pine. This is the strongest grapefruit smell I've encountered in a beer. The taste is almost a grapefruit like as the aroma, but not quite. There is a nice bitterness in the finish too. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a really nice beer. I held off trying it for a long time, because I really did not like Oaked Arrogant Bastard. This beer seems to me to have a lot more complexity."
" Get some!!!"
"Drinkability: A decent, drinkable beer, which hopefully will be more appreciated when I try it outside of a bar and in a proper glass."
"I tend to favor beers with a more ""session beer"" drinkability, but this still stuck my fancy. Deep copper color with decent lacing. Definitely a must-have for any hopheads out there."
"A rich copper color with a tan head. Hangs around with some good lace. Smells of sweet malt flavors and citrus (lemon rind?). The hops are strong with a lot of lemon citrus flavor but the toasted malt acts as a strong counterpoint and really softens them. It has a campfire quality in the taste that I found very appealing and definitely something that lends this beer to a more dynamic range of food pairings than perhaps a straight American IPA. A nice display of flavors overall and a good, dry finish on the end. I think this was Stone's original flagship beer before the IPA caught on and it's easy to see why. It's a lovely beer that is worth a try and one that is definitely worthy of it's level of respect and popularity."
"Poured from 22 oz bottle, deep reddish brown, thin tan head, minimal lacing. Smell of toasted grains, hops and cookie dough. Bitter hop flavor mixed with toasted malt, some caramel-like sweetness, mixed with malt and a tart, bitter hop finish. Nice balance of flavors, with a hoppy bitterness ruling. Medium bodied with a slick feel, goes down easy. Definitely a quality brew, a great beer to start to start or finish a session with."
"Overhyped for sure, but this is still a unique and tasty beer - worth trying if you haven't."
"D - Despite the high alcohol content this one is surprisingly drinkable."
"Overall, a very well done hoppy brew."
"D: Well this beer is great, really great, but certainly NOT a session - type beer."
"Drinkability: Decent drinkability, drinks light for such a high abv; its so delicious, so I'd drink it anytime. cheers."
"Overall: A staple from the stone brewery with good reason, this brew has it all from malt to hop. You're not worthy"
"Pours a deep majestic copper with a nice tan head that laced thickly down the sides of the glass. Smell is strong, piny, sticky, hoppy, resiny, malty, yeasty, clean, refined, wonderful. Taste is very bitter and very balanced. The bready malts are right there on the tails of the hops. Mouthfeel is thick and substantial, and drinkability is good."
"This is a profound beer that lives up to all the hoopla and the essay on the bottle is an arrogant call to arms for all craft brew fans."
"I'm glad I got to try this one from Stone, can't wait till they come to Louisiana and I can enjoy this more often."
"Drinkability - Quite drinkable indeed. I had a pint of this and was going to get another but have been wanting to try SA Octoberfest on tap so I held out. Overall quite nice and better than I was expecting seeing as I hold the Stone Oaked AB so highly!"
"Drinkability: Definitely a beer I would have again and it is no wonder that I have heard so much about this beer from both BA users and friends of mine who enjoy good brews. If you haven't tried this yet, do it immediately- I feel stupid for not buying this one sooner."
"""You are not worthy""...Indeed"
"D- moderate though enjoyable. This beer grabs you by the throat and demands to be enjoyed. At 7% it's not the strongest one you'll have, but the flavors are so intense you have no choice but to bow down and drink it at a slow pace. A world-class brew."
"Notes: though i am thoroughly impressed with the caramel/brown sugar malt flavours in the presence of this wonderful hop onslaught, the alcohol is a bit too pronounced, affecting the drinkability and taste as the beer warms. so drink it fairly cold!"
"Delicious but a bit too hoppy for me personally. A must try for all but will appeal to hop heads more than others. Not to say this beer is especially hoppy; there are much hoppier beers, but it does make the hop presence known."
"Drinkability = I first reviewed this beer on 4-19-2008. At that point, I hated hoppy and/or bitter beers. That has really changed, and now I love them. So, while back then I said this beer was too bitter for my taste, now I think it's just right."
"Drinkability: I could definitely have a few more of these! At 7.2 ABV, this isn't going to go quietly, though! I think this beer would be and outstanding complement to strongly flavored foods. Its strong and interesting character could stand up to any spicy or rich food."
"D: Okay but a bit too strong to drink much of in a night."
"T: WoW! so much hop! in such a good way. great lacing. its got a wonderful creamy feel to it. the bitter at the end slightly stands out more than the boldness at the beginning and the middle of the drink. definitely stimulates the mouth as it claws its way down your palate with a hoppy kick at the end... definitely a great session beer for Hop-Heads!"
"Drink this beer everyday and youll be satisdied for the rest of your days."
"Deep and complex without being overwhelmingly heavy. Great oak and spice mix, but subtle enough not to be overwhleming. This has become my favorite beer - as it works on wintery cold nights and I've even stretched it to be drinkable during water volleyball in 103 degree temperature without feeling too heavy or out of place. The marketing is brilliant and is always a conversation starter."
"Drinkability: This beer dares you to drink it. It tells you won't like it. Part of its arrogance is that it is a fantastic beer. It has some complexity but its not too much to take it. Arrogant bastard has a huge character. It may tell you that you're not worthy and you may not be. But drink it anyway, you'll love it."
"The taste is slightly boozy for it's 7.2abv, but also really malty. An awesome strong ale, it's got a lot of complexity to it that comes out more and more with each sip. Looking forward to comparing this to the oaked version."
"The original dark, hoppy ale from Stone, the first of several. Every time I drink this beer I taste different things, and no, my lips are NOT moving as I write this, but my mouth is watering at the thought of second bottle I still have."
"Meidum bodied, fairly smooth. Drinkability is a little hard to rate for this one, its gotta be a matter of how accustomed you are to this kind of stuff. I've given tastes to the so-called ""fizzy yellow"" beer drinkers described on the label and they weren't too thrilled...but personally I love this stuff. So if you've ever had anything even slightly on the extreme side, this shouldn't be too overwhelming. Definitely a keeper in my book."
"D -- Delicious and will become a staple. I'm not sure how I would follow this one up on a night of heavy beer tasting as it definitely does a number on the taste buds, but I suppose having to stick with this through a night isn't necessarily a bad thing."
"d- it is heavy and very bitter sumwhat filling, no hint of the alc, it gets away from me because the taste is excellent. BOW down to the gargoyle that protects this beer."
"D: Not quite as Arrogant as i expected. Yes, it's hoppy and decidedly unbalanced, but it's a lot more drinkable than the name or the description on the back of the bottle suggests."
"I consider this beer to be the staple of an American Strong Ale. It reminds be of a fantastic American IPA that was taken to the next level. Try this, you won't be disappointed."
"Overall, this is a great beer. Well balanced and delicious. There is a lot of flavor here, and I like that this beer is not completely overpowered by big hoppy overload. The flavor holds up and the beer is quite drinkable."
"It's hard for me to rate drinkability. Most beers with this much flavor tend to have a lot more alcohol. The huge amount of bitter hops and malts might hinder the drinkability, but I'm drinking it slow mostly to make this experience last longer."
"O - Awesome ""go to"" for a strong American ale. I like to keep a few bottles to age a bit if I want a more subdued hop character. It's a perfect hop fix when fresh. A cornerstone of any beer fridge."
"D: This was a nice malt profiled beer. Could drink a few in a sitting."
"Kicks ass!"
"D - This is the first beer from the acclaimed Stone Brewery that I have had the chance to try, and the hype is justified. This ale's bittersweet profile of flavours provides a beautifully balanced beer, with just enough kick to make you realise that you are drinking a strong ale. Thankfully, certain shops and bars in the UK are catching on to the Stone range of beers, and this is definitely something I will be taking advantage of in the future."
"Pours a nice amber brown color with a fluffy white head and decent lacing. The smell is of a strong malt backbone with toffee notes and an overlayer of floral and pine hops. The taste is of malt backbone but a bitter hop bite is present and big on the back end. A floral hop taste but it is slightly too bitter. The mouthfeel is nice with a smooth and light carbonation feel. The drinkability isn't as high as some in the class, the bitter bite is not in a hop enjoyable way."
"Mouthfeel is heavy, smooth, and not too bubbly despite the grand head of foam that sticks to this beer. A bomber of this beer is a nice treat, but I wouldn't want to have much more of it. It's more like an IPA than any other style, but it doesn't take on the role of a big session beer like a lot of the IPA's do."
"Overall, a very well balanced yet complex beer."
"This ale was way, way, way too hoppy for my tastes. Evidently - or according to the packaging - this is because I am a giant moron and a sissy when it comes to beer. I know I'm probably taking the damn label WAAAAY too seriously, but in my eyes if you put statements like that on your bottle, your beer sure as hell better deliver. And Arrogant Bastard simply did not deliver. It reminded me of the compressed pellet of hops I tasted when I toured the Anheiser-Busch brewery in St. Louis. I had some other Arrogant Bastard beers on my to-try list, but I will cross them off unless someone wants to throw a bottle my way for free."
"in the end, its a good beer, and its a beer that puts some hair on the chest, just like whiskey or a bj."
"I liked this a lot. While I wouldn't say it necessarily stands heads and shoulders above the crowd, it is definitely in an upper tier of beers, and I'm very pleased to try this again. This bastard is bitchin'."
"Got this in a 22 oz. bottle from my neighborhood liquor store. It poured a deep red brown with a two-finger head. Wonderful citrusy hop aroma. Has an initial hop bite followed by a sweet, carmel malt flavor. Though this beer is strong, its medium body makes for smooth drinking. This is not only my favorite American strong ale, it is my favorite beer period."
"D) Delicious. A fitting name and well crafted beer."
"Notes: This is a very very good beer. In my top five easily. It might not be something a novice beer drinker would take to easily but that's simply because they aren't worthy...yet."
"Pours a beautiful dark amber color with a foamy tan 3 finger head. Pine hops and caramel malt are the most dominant flavors, same as with the bottle. The tap version is sweeter than the bottle. The aroma is the same, but not quite as strong on tap, most likely due to the cold serving temp. As the beer warms, the flavor and aroma come through nicely. Smooth, creamy, medium bodied, and very drinkable."
"Overall-lives up to the hype, a great beer, above the level of others, I enjoyed the complexity and was really able to savor it. Great great job."
"D: At first it seemed a little low on the hops and the drinkability suffered, but once the bitterness kicked in it becomes much easier to drink. I found myself reaching for this beer quite often."
"D: I have half of a 22 oz bottle while I shared the rest with my brother, a good beer to sip and talk about, but definitely not anywhere on my top list."
"Had this one the other day after work. Poured an amber color with caramel head that left plenty of lacing. Smelled of pine hops, malt and fruit. Tasted like pine hops and malt. Smooth, but slightly bitter aftertaste and a little bit fizzy. Simply put, this is a good beer."
"D- I feel the 22oz bomber is quite appropriate in terms of drinkability. This is not a beer I'd like to drink more than 22oz of throughout a session. It was not bad by any means but definitely not a top ten."
"Overall this is a winner in my book. I'm not a hop head by any means but, if this the gateway to bigger and stronger hop flavors. The door has been kicked wide open my friends."
"M/D: Very thick and full bodied. Goes down smooth, I was expecting a slight bite with the ABV being 7.2%. I could see this being a session beer without a doubt."
"I love this stuff, but I still like the oaked version a tiny bit better."
"Pours a very nice auburn color, dark amber with lacing white head. There is a lot of hop presence in the aroma and flavor, a sort of fruity hop, but not to any extent where its overpowering. A very nice balance with the malt, as well. Caramel and molasses-like characters from the malt are just behind the hop to give a warming, full flavor. Mouth is very nice, full but not chewy. Its got a light feel for the robust flavor and full body. Perhaps not one of the best, but very, very good. I had this for the first time a very long time ago, before being introduced to many other beers and styles. Since then I had tried double bastard and oaked AB, but hadn't come back to the normal version. Certainly a pleasure."
"D: It's fucking good, a great sipper, something new and a reliving of the previous sip, developing and revealing and reconfirming with each sip. You can't beat the original. This is really something special."
"D - Not sure if I could drink a lot but the drink is good."
"M&D: due to successful bottling, the palate is really fresh and helps to lift the weight by a good margin with only the necessary dose of soft carbonation; the flavour profile is balanced, deep, yet overall surprisingly approachable - I find myself in deep thought about the structure of this ale and blissful imagination of how it might have tasted on the cask-conditioned form... Truly, a ""well-hopped premium bitter"" like this (this is how I appreciate this ale, regardless of any self-acclaimed beer style imposed here or by Stone, which it hasn't) shouldn't be an ""Arrogant Bastard"" in any sense. Frankly, I've never been able to grasp the humour (or pretentiousness) of Stone's beer-naming ""strategy"" (on top of lines and lines of unnecessary/redundant/quite uninformative explanation on the back label for many ales they bottle), which is quite a failure; but, I loyally love their beers. This AB is firmly on my top 3 from this brewery (so far) without a doubt. Being this drinkable and approachable, I almost feel I can stick to this ale the whole night..."
"Whew I made it - how many times I've started to review this beer when the 7.2% caught up with me."
"D - A very interesting, complex, and sophisticated brew indeed. One I'd definitely enjoy again on occasion."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a tall pint glass. Two fingers of white foam above a golden amber clear ale. Smells like malt and a hint of hops. Tastes of roasted barley, chocolate (?), coffee. The mouthfeel is good but not overwhelming with a good long finish. Very Drinkable despite the ""You aren't worthy"" slogan."
"D- Definitely drinkable, the bomber size is perfect for this beer."
"Just awesome."
"D- Could have another. Easy sipper with a tasty dinner, quite a nice treat. Glad it is widely available here."
"You're not worthy!"
"D: At over 7% ABV and with a full array of ale flavors, this brew is great to have on its own if you're willing to deal with the dizzying flavor profiles and the imminent hangover. A great ale, but probably not for the uninitiated."
"This is the beer that introduced me to the appreciation of good craft beer. I've tried many others but I always come back to this one and I am never disappointed. It's a great beer year round with all kinds of food. Excellent!"
"Overall, If you haven't tried this...then what the heck are you waiting for."
"Poured beer into glass. Color was very good. The odour was very nice, it implied that there would be a hoppy bite to it, however when I drank it, the hops were not really overtly there. There beer had a smooth finish to it, and definitely tasted good. I had it in a comparison to the oaked arrogant bastard. I found this beer to be better than the Oaked Arrogant Bastard, but that just may be a taste preference."
"Drinkability: Usually a bomber is enough for me, and it drinks a little slower than some of my favorite IPAs, but it definitely is consistent and tasty throughout and doesn't ever get too difficult to drink. I'd imagine most every good beer drinker out there has had this due to Stone's fantastic distribution scheme and power, but if not, it's certainly a great example of the American Strong Ale."
"Pours with a big tan head, the beer is ruby brown in color. Smells sweet, citric, alcoholy. Almost no carbonation. From the first sip the alcohol makes its presence known. Bitter throughout with a nutty-bitter slightly astringent aftertaste, which really lingers. A faint mustiness can be tasted, which seems odd and out of place. A real hoppy kick in the crotch. I wanted to like this beer more, and I consider myself a hophead, but it was a little too bitter/astringent without enough balancing maltiness for me."
"Will love to try the Double and the oaked."
"This beer is exactly what it advertises. It packs a punch! Not at all ordinary, it pours a light cloudy brown. The smell is complex, with hops and malt present. Once you take a sip and it hits your belly, you have to drink the rest. It has a strong hop taste but finishes refreshing and has a luring aftertaste. Unless you appreciate finer tastes, ""You're not worthy""TM"
"From the 22 fl. oz. bottle with no marked lot code or expiration date. Sampled on July 2, 2009. The pour was anice looking amber brown with a significant supply of frothy beige head that filled up a quarter of the pint glass. It gave me a foam moustache! The aroma was a kind of floral malt mixture, which I know does not make a lot of sense but that is how I define it. Nice though. The taste had a nice balance of hops which countered the 7%+ ABV, which I barely even noticed. No wonder everyone lies this one."
"D - This is a highly drinkable brew that could very easily be confused as a session brew. The 7.2% sneaks up on you, as it is so deep and enjoyable that you'll drink it more quickly than you should. I would drink this brew with good BBQ, a burger, a well-aged Gouda, or Mexican food. As good as it gets for a big American ale."
"I was really looking forward to this beer as I had heard so much about it. Let me tell you it didn't dissappoint! Everything about this beer delivers, from the excellent deep coloring to the great head of foam, to the complex series of flavors. Every sip brought a new nuance of flavor that kept me wanting more. The only drawback to the beer is that it is slightly heavy to be a session beer, but it is definately the first beer I will grab when I start off the night."
"Drinks incredibly smoothly and is very refreshing, zero bite here."
"I can drink this aged and fresh...a very versatile beer from Stone that never disapoints."
"Thick, toffee colored head with a little lacing. Nice dark color with bold smell, taste starts as a slight bitter coffee taste that turns an almost sweet finish. After the beer breathes for awhile other spices start to develop. A complex beer that is up at the top of my list for sure."
"d- it is drinkable, i definately wouldn't session this bad boy, i think i'd be on my ass, the cool bottle doesn't lie it's not for the faint of heart, but really great none the less."
"Drinkability- Its very drinkable. However, I choose not to drink it everyday. I save it as a special occasion beer, because every time I've had this beer its been memorable."
"I know American Strong Ale is a catch-all, but this one seems halfway between an IPA and an American Barleywine. Also somewhat reminds me of Furious."
"Excellent beer that you can enjoy anytime. A true Stone."
"Drink this. I can't wait to grab a bottle, as I think a bottle pour will make for a stronger bouquet and open this one up a lot."
"Drinkability- The beer that got me hooked on craft beer years ago is still one of my favorite ales to sit around and drink in cold or warm weather."
"Well this was my first bastard and it was pretty decent, I' am now much more interested in getting the oak aged bastard."
"D: A great beer, but I would not call it very ""drinkable"". Something I'd recommend trying, however."
"This is a great beer. I could enjoy several in a session."
"Overall, this is a great beer. I'm really happy that I went (way) out of my way to grab this when I had the chance. I definitely be doing my best to get ahold of another one when I'm in a Stone-friendly area."
"Arrogant Bastard... the redish appearance almost makes you think that you are going to drink unfermented carbonated wort... But on the first sip you realize that you are drinking an arogant bastard of a beer...."
"D - Very tasty, drinkable offering. Full flavored and nicely balanced. Definitely one I will return to again."
"d: not very drinkable. ok for a big beer, hop heads might disagree."
"This was my first Stone beer and it very quickly became one of my top 5 favorite beers. Poured the bottle into an arrogant bastard glass. Poures a wonderful dark red color with a thick white head. The beer is all about the hops mixed perfectly with hints of carmal and vanilla. Wow what a great tasting beer. The pine and citrus keep coming in and out throughout. Lots of malts to back the huge amount of hops. Nice long hoppy bitter finish. Great beer. Only problem is two bomber is enough for me although I want to keep drinking. Liquid gold."
" Pours a copper/redish brown. has a nice off white that gets about 1-2 fingers thick in these glasses, but lasts a while. leaves decent lace. Smells hoppy, almost similar to the IPA. Hits of citrus and caramel. Almost if they mixed the ipa with the stout, but not as strong in either direction. It's a strong flavor, but not overwhelming."
"Drink ability is also good. Alcohol isnt very present so it is semi session able but very flavorful. Over all this is a great beer and always a reliable choice"
"great brew."
"Aroma is strong hops. Taste is very hoppy, with strong hop bitterness and spice, and a background of malts. The big flavors stay in your mouth. While I wouldn't exactly call this easy drinking, I could definitely drink a few of these."
"(D)- The balance of bitter and sweet really brings out some complex flavors in this guy. The alcohol is hard to find amidst the bittersweetness, but it could sneak up on you after a few, but I definitely wouldnt mind having 2-3 of these no problem."
"This beer is a flavor sensation. It's sweet, bitter, and musty in a way to put hair on the bottom of your feet. Such a complex array of flavors, enough to label this as brewing genius."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - I couldn't wait to put down a review on this one, this beer is intense, pungent, in your face, and leaves you thinking about what you thought was a good beer. I absolutely loved everything about this beer, especially the flavor & the outstanding body, I got to say that I'm not big on the alcohol burn of these stronger brews, but I'm willing to over look that because this is just to good. I could have a couple pints of this stuff when the day is done, and I'm ready to just unwind and let the fruity, pungent hops flood my brain. Highly recommended. Cheers!"
"The carbonation finds a nice middle ground - not particularly prickly, nor giving way to too much creaminess. A full but not particularly heavy feel."
"Pours a ruby brown color with a very good head for a strong ale. The head sticks around and helps with the aroma as much as it can. The aroma is pretty weak even when compared to other strong ales. The smell is of a mild fruit that seems to have been toned down. The taste was good and refreshing. Brew is of a low body and I would say drinkability is good as the alcohol does not hit you right away."
"d - can only drink a few of these at a time, but definitely one to have again"
"I love reading the label. I ain't ever going back to ""tasteless fizzy yellow beer."""
"Poured from bomber. Dark mahogany color profile with hints of caramel, spice, copper on the nose. Superb strong ale that drinks like a hybrid IPA, ESB, porter. Notes of coffee, hops and malt. This is always a good choice for a full flavored beer and goes well with heavy food."
"This beer pours a gorgeous deep dark clear amber/red. Served without much of a head to it, but what was there retained quite well. Nice sticky lacing is left on the glass. Nose is surprisingly more on the hoppy side - citrus hops, some pine, but nicely blended with caramel malts. Taste is outstanding. Starts of with a big citrusy hop bite then leading in to darker malts, caramel malts and finishes with a slightly piney hop bite. This is an extremely well balanced beer that has big hop and malt presence but blends so well while moving in to the next flavor. Mouthfeel is medium body, low carbonation which works very well for this beer, very smooth almost creamy. This is a highly drinkable beer."
"Love reading the back everytime I have this beer."
"D - I could drink this at any time...but you have to watch out...too many and you might become the arrogant bastard...good stuff!"
"D: Very drinkable, but you should keep in mind that this beer is best served by slower drinking."
"This beer is bitter from the start to the finish of each sip. Like I said above, simply awesome..."
"D: Very nice for a 7%er."
"d- goes down fairly easy but i dont know if i would actually search for this beer to purchase it again"
"I think I like the bold/robust flavor of Double Bastard more than this, but I think I like this as an overall drink more--just more enjoyable, I guess."
"Definitely a beer to consider when making a selection."
"Mouthfeel is great one this one, not too heavy nor light, perfect for sipping and savoring or nice big gulps if so inclined. Carbonation is to a minumum, which helps with the swilling. High scores in this area."
"D: Pretty darn drinkable. I would love to try it oak aged."
"This beer has been a bastard to my taste buds. It's teased them, confused them, and in the end made sweet tender love to them. But yeah, I'd do it again. If you can't handle IPA's don't bother with this. But if you want to spend $10 for a good time, pick yourself up a bottle of arrogant bastard."
"Also, complements to Stone on a great name as well as their painted labels."
"Pours out a deep ruby color with some notes of brown. A massive off-white/yellow head forms that clings up and down the glass, making a very nice looking drink. I can smell the hops from a distance kind of fruity, and there are even some sweet bready, caramelly malts in there. Overall, a very nice mix of smells - almost straightforward, and sort of wavers between bold and subdued. I like it. The flavor comes up kind of like the smell. Not a harsh bitterness, but there's a good kick. Also, not a huge amount of hop flavor - I get some spiciness though, like mint almost in the finish, though I know clearly that quite a bit of hops were used in here. The maltiness shines through pleasantly, biscuity, kind of sweet. Overall, the taste is very nice. The mouthfeel is a little bit disappointing when compared to the rest of this beer. Mine seems a little watery, kind of clingy, and there's an odd burn (I don't think it's alcohol related) as it goes down. This one drinks pretty well. I mean, it's a well-executed beer. An old favorite of mine, which I'm finally getting around to reviewing, and I can say that I will probably buy more in the future. Recommended to all."
"I wondered how easy this would be to drink. No problem there, Went down very easy. Very very good beer."
"This is an outstanding beer, I want more."
"Mouthfeel is slightly syrupy. Good dry aftertaste."
"Poured a light amber red. Good sticky off white head that also had a great taste. Smell is very hoppy, also piney with a hint of citrus. Taste is very smooth. Nice bite of hops and pine with a slight metalic feel in the mouth. A little bit of the bitter stays on the tongue. Nice drinkibility, very smooth and easy to drink. Kind of surprising given the name. But easily one of the best of this style."
"All in all this is a very drinkable brew. Would love a chance to try this on tap. Good offering."
"I've had really mixed results from this beer. The first bottle of it that I had was absolutely outstanding. The second bottle was also outstanding. The third bottle was... let's say not so good. Okay, actually the third bottle was really pretty bad. I'm going to assume that I just had a bad bottle though, and rate it from the first couple bottles. It pours fairly dark with a nice piney scent, with a hint of citrus. The taste is just about what you expect from the scent. Hoppy... very hoppy... with a nice caramel flavor. The feel is good, and the drinkability pretty good. One bottle was enough for me. I'll eventually get some more of it, if I can get past the worry that I'll get another bad bottle. The bad one was really nasty... but when it's what it should be, it's a really great beer."
"Overall impression: My wife's favorite beer, and for good reason. Somehow it manages to be aggressively malty and aggressively hoppy at the same time. Great brew, one I like to have in the old beer fridge at all times."
"Hits thick. Finishes thick. I don't even want to know how many calories are in this beer ... because I'm going to drink a lot of them. There's a hint of peatiness here (ala a scotch ale), but the alcohol leads you to a barleywine feel as well. A lot of complexity going on."
"Overall, a good offering from Stone. It is certainly not my favorite from them. It reminded a lot of Troeg's Nugget Nectar, although I preferred that. Note: I drank over a half and hour and allowed to warm to room temperature. The flavor was enhanced by this and I enjoyed the second half of the beer immensely. A good but not great offering."
"Overall this is one of the most popular microbrewery beers out of San Diego for a reason. Great stuff all around."
"This was good overall. There is a nice balance between the hops and malt. This is an older bottle, so the hops have faded a bit. Still very good though. Another winner from Stone."
"Drinkability - High. I will definitely be searching for more of Stone's ""Arrogant"" series in the near future."
"what a beutyful beer and well balanced... when pouired you get a nice copper color ale with a thick head around two fingers smells of hops where great.. taste was nice with lots of hops it was smooth but not a chuggable beer i really wanted to enjoy the taste... nice lacing and great after taste .. i loved it ... cheers"
"Can't wait to try the oaked and the double bastard"
"D: Very tasty and drinkable."
"Both the mouth feel and drink ability reflect how powerful this ale is. Certainly too flavorful to drink 3 or 4 pints of the stuff. Overall, a good experience from this bastard."
"D - an absolutely delicious ale, one of my all-time favorites"
"I don't like the name or the tag line (""You're not worthy"") but this beer was very pleasant."
"D - I found this to be good but not mild-blowing. Perhaps the bottle was slightly past its prime. I would like to sample this on tap soon, because I know there is potential here. With a name like Arrogant Bastard, it HAS to be good, right?"
"Too yummy for words! Very drinkable in flavor and feel, but scarily boozy to end an evening early. Be very very careful with this one! Cheers."
"It has a dark copper color with a fair amount of ruby red tint to it. The aroma is sweet, spicy and nutty. The taste is so very complex with dark plums, caramel, spicy, and nutty flavors. It also has some hot alcohol flavors mixed in with its great bitterness. It has a fairly thick body and is very complex."
"This beer poured a dark copper with a two-finger tan head. The smell is a bunch of different types of hops including citrus and piney with a thin overlay of malt. The taste starts off With some sweet malt that is cut pretty quickly by some citrusy hops followed by some piney and floral hops with a good balance. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with a moderate amount of carbonation. This is a good beer to be sure, but I think I may prefer to subtleties of the oaked version better."
"D - not too much of session beer, but something that I like to enjoy on a regular basis"
"D - Bomber was about the right size. Will drink again, but not a session beer in my opinion."
"It won't be hard to finish the bomber, but I doubt I'd want more right away. That seems like enough for a sitting."
"Drinkability: A decent IPA, one to try just for reading the bottle. It is decidedly more ""aggressive"" than the normal ale, but a little too dark and raw for me. Not enough hops, and too much malts."
"Drinkability: This beer is very drinkable and is very enjoyable also. Definitely something I will buy again soon."
"D- One of my favorite beers to date. Would gladly drink it all the time."
"Another great brew from Stone. Those guys are amazing."
"D: Drinks easy, could probably drink a lot of this. Quite hoppy, so the drinkability would be lower if that doesn't sound like a good thing to you."
"D- The brew is incredibly drinkable and a bomber is the perfect ammount."
"Future outlook: Another beer that I can't believe I've waited this long to try.... I'd be happy to have this again."
"Drinkability is the top feature that absolutely sets this beer apart in this style. It is way way way too drinkable"
"Wow, what a great ale. I think the warning on the label is correct: you won't be able to fully appreciate the complexity of flavors in this beer. I'm afraid that my tastebuds are not yet sophisticated enough to pick out every flavor which overwhelmed my palate; but that doesn't mean I won't try again. I'll look forward to having another bomber of Arrogant Bastard."
"D: The definitive example of the American Strong Ale style. Maltier and more complex than an IPA, but not quite big enough to be a barleywine. Needless to say, it's a classic amoung American craft brews. It's not for beginners, though. It takes a pretty weathered palate to withstand the flavor assault and appreciate everything that it offers."
"D= Great beer but I don't know how many I could possibly have before it would be too much. The finish lasts a long time and the beer is high in booze. Great beer though I'll be searching it out again."
"While very good at everything, it is not distinguished at any one thing. There is no characteristic that grabs you by the collar and shakes you. Arrogant Bastard Ale is a jack of all trades, and a solid ""A," but the master of none."
"Drinkability - At 7.2% this beer misses the session boat my a few miles. Part of me wishes this beer was a little lower in ABV so I could have another one."
"Great brew."
"Drinkability is good. The sheer strength of the flavors, though, make this a beer you can't have too much of, or it will wear you out. One was enough for me, and it was a wonderful drinking experience."
"D- Nice and complex with a fair amount of arrogance."
"Overall an amazing beer, slightly bitter but still awesome. And a privilege for it to be my first review."
"Great overall. There are all kinds of things going on here, not sure even how to describe some of it."
"Very drinkable. The type of beer that would end up knocking me on my ass because it smells great, tastes great, is very smooth, and just begs for its next slug. Thats what the look of the Gargoyle on the bottle says to me. ""So...you think you could just drink this all night huh?"" Maybe its MY arrogance he's looking at."
"Love this one. Really hit the spot tonight."
"Highly recommended. A hoppy beer of this sort comes late in a beer drinkers evolution..but once you're there, its out of this world."
"Very good. I'm definitely gonna be drinking this one a lot."
"had my first one the other day...its a great beer in every aspect. it pours out a nice amber color with a good sized head and lacing on the glass throughout. the taste is hoppy with a little bit of citrus, but barely noticeable,very pleasant to the palate... just a perfect combo if you ask me"
"Drinkability: Session or sipper... you choice - whatever you can handle. Beautiful beer."
"Not sure I would buy again, but I would recommend it to anyone who loves hops."
"Just a great, complex, balanced and robust brew and it will be a staple henceforth. I can't wait to grab double bastard and compare."
" Top shelf stuff!"
"Overall, an excellent ale. I'll be coming back to this one."
"D: I'm still in awe of this beers balanced characteristics and exceptional flavors. Followed with a SN Torpedo, and didn't notice any hop character in the Torpedo. Would love to have this on a more regular basis."
"Poured from a bomber into an Imperial pint glass..Pours a wonderful deep copper. Lots of lacing and a great 3 finger head. The aroma of this bastard was mainly piney, grapefruity, and even a little sweetness. It tastes very sweet upfront, a mixture of different malts with that uniique stone yeast strain. It then turns into a complex mix of hops and malts, which isn't too bitter, just right. The back end is very nicely accompanied by various hops flavors and bitterness."
"Notes: This is a very tasty beer. I like it very much so. MMM"
"Oddly enough, this is the beer that got me into IPA's. I fell in love with hops through this beer."
"D=Not terribly filing & alcohol isn't over the top."
"D: This is a very fine beer and one I could drink over and over. While it is a strong beer, the alcohol is well balanced, and it is by no means a heavy or filing beer. I look forward to having another one of these soon."
"All in all, a great beer and well deserving of the hype and it's reputation. I will be back for this one again and again."
"One of the best I have ever had a highly recommend"
"WOW who knew?? The smell of the bitter grapefruit coming off this beer made me skeptical, but then I had to taste it. There has never been a place for the grapefruit taste till now. The taste of the grapefruit and spice was very pleasing. Good mouthfeel with the spice and once it goes down a good finish spicy kick hits your taste buds. I really enjoyed this tasting, what a wakeup call for the mouth."
"This is one beer that deserved a second chance."
"D--Like this bottle says, this is not for the weak palate. If you are just getting into craft beer I'm not sure that this would be something good to jump into, but any hop lover would adore this I am sure. Great beer. I personally would not want more than a pint in one sitting, and I'm not sure how I'm going to finish this bomber."
"Still I enjoyed it."
"Am I Worthy? I don't really know, but God Damn, this is one of the best beers I've ever tasted. Nasdrovia!"
"This is a big and assertive beer that lives up to its name and hype."
"Bottle 22oz .A deep dark amber color with a big thick off white head that leaves tuns of lacing as it slowly diminishes,some light carbonation. Aroma is piny,citrusy,and earthy,with some notes of the sweet malt waiting to be tasted. Flavors of caramel malts,toffee,pine,cherries,smoke ,hints of maybe burbon or oaky vanilla, very deep and complex like and old ale. A medium to full body,velvety mouthfeel, hoppy aftertaste and burps, a little sticky around the lips (something to lick off later), damn this is good shit ! and yes I would drink this all night long or at least untill the 3rd or 4th time I fell down eh."
"Are you worthy? Try it!"
"Nice carbonation and solid mouthfeel makes it easy to down a bomber of this. Undoubtedly my favorite beer so far..."
"First bomber will be hard to drink, but once you'll get used to it, you'll come back, fore sure. Many Tasteful beer will taste... ordinary after trying this one! I think I'm worthy now!!!"
"Pours a darker amber color with a thick tannish head. Good lacing all the way down the glass. Great citrus grapefruit hop smell. There is a very slight toasted malt flavor that is quickly overpowered by the extreme grapefruit hop flavor. This is pure grapefruit juice. The bitterness lingers long after the finish."
"D - To me this is a one and done beer as least when presented in the bottle. I remember a somewhat different experience when I had it on Draft at Mad Mex in State College PA. I would like to try it again on tap and then revise this review if the experience is different."
"Pours very clear dark ruby/brown colour large off-white head. Smell - hops, citrusy notes, some fruitiness (pear-like). Nice, inoffencive, pleasant aroma. Taste - starts off with hoppy bitterness which goes all the way through, followed by warming alcohol, some grapefruit, pine. It's really bitter al the way through, with slightly spicy finish. Very interesting and very different. Mouthfeel -aggressive, i'd even say purposley unbalanced. Creamy, a bit sticky. Drinkable for ABV."
"I have yet to experience a finer brew than this."
"Oh, and the beer's awesome."
"Final Thoughts - I love Stone Brewing Company and this was my first introduction to them a while back. Between the complex flavor and smooth drinkability, this ale solidifies it as my number one American Strong Ale. You have to pick up a 22 oz. bomber of this to truly appreciate American Craft brewing. Highly recommended!"
"The 7.2% feels and tastes more like 10. I didn't like it when I first tried it, but it grew on me. It's better when it warms up a bit, I liked the beer closer to the end of the glass."
"Notes: Very refreshing and drinkable for an ale of this strength and character. Very complex. An amazing beer."
"I would recommend drinking this beer with red meat. Actually I would recommend drinking this beer period. This beer was great and is the beer to beat in this class."
"Had this on on tap after already trying the oaked arrogant bastard. This is not as good as the oaked, but still a very good beer, just not as much complexity in this one."
"Cheers!"
"I waited a long time to try this beer, and it was not worth the wait. The appearance is amazing, with a deep amber burgundy color. The taste is overwhelming hop from the outset. The aftertaste is almost like sucking a grapefruit. There is no complexity. It is all hops. Not worth it, even for a hop lover."
"Drinkability- very tasty beer thats complex and has so much flavor its seeming with flavor, really good beer worth visiting many time and maybe getting different experience or thoughts each time, paired great with my burger and fries very tasty very complex hoppy beer, I like this one alot for sure, a real beer bottom line, alcohol at 7.2 makes this pack a well hidden wallop, very tasty beer to drink"
"Overall great beer. I think I could drink a maximum of two bottles in one night, but am perfectly content with one."
"Poured into a pint glass, deep amber/reddish, nice head that clung to the glass very well. Smelled of some caramel and toasted malt. Tasted the same but OMG, how nicely it was put together. Definitely not overboard, in fact the sweet is not really there, just enough to lure you in and give you the strong malt kick. Tasted most excellent! Mouthfeel and drinkability both were top notch. In fact, I can't really think of much else they could do to make it better, but I am very cautious of giving out 5's. This is the first in all of my years rating. Arrogant Bastard truly does stand out. I can't wait to get another!"
"Drinkability: Really high. There's a nice balance of the flavors going, and it's not nearly as intimidating as the bottle suggests. Perhaps it has mellowed with age."
"D: This is a damned good beer. Now I know why it is so celebrated by beer geeks like myself. It was definitely a beer I'd try again, but I don't think I'd have more than one in a sitting. It is a great beer to have as a nightcap, but not for a hot day at the lake. On the other hand, I thought I would have problems drinking the bomber by myself. This isn't posing a problem at this point."
"Pours a dark red, dark copper color with a small but nice one finger head that leaves a little lacing down the glass. The aroma has a hint of fruit and of course hops. For me the aroma doesn't stand out a lot but whats there is definitely nice. The taste is wonderful. Pretty well balanced and not extremely hoppy. It's bitter but has some sweetness to it that I really like. The mouthfeel is good, it's nowhere near thin but it's not really thick making it at a nice place right in the middle. This beer is very drinkable. Not a high ABV and the taste is awesome. It's to bad Stone doesn't sell here so whenever I'm across state lines I'm always picking a few of these up."
"Based on the colour and other folks thoughts, I was expecting more malt sweetness and toffee flavour, but this still has quite a lean and mean malt profile. The hops are assertive, particularly in the finish, but still blend together well with the rest of the beer. Agressive and simple, but perfectly executed."
"D - Delightful. Very easy to appreciate despite the ironic warning on the bottle, ""you probably won't like it."" No - you probably will love it"
"Bready malts on the tongue, touch of fig and chocolate. Nice rich body without being cloying on the sweetness. ABV is well hidden after a bit of air and warming, well balanced yielding a good drinkability. Nice."
"D - Good to excellent, depending upon my mood."
"Drinkable, but you couldn't kickback 3 of 4 of these, 1 bottle is about all I could do."
"The bomber was gone before I knew it. I was hesitant to try this because I was so disappointed with the oaked version. I'm glad I didn't let this great brew pass by."
"Overall I went into this beer hoping to love it, but truthfully expecting to hate it. I was very plesantly surprised with this one, I really liked it alot! and will have to get more whenever im down in TX. [or wherever stone might be sold]"
"Overall, good beer, but if you can get the oaked over this one I would recommend the oaked first. IMO, I would recommend letting it warm a touch as well. Still, a good beer worth a try and very drinkable for it's ABV."
"This is one i've been wanting to try for a long time. I'm glad i finally did."
"MF&D - smooth, crisp, refreshing, intoxicating. what more could I possibly ask for? this beer has a perfect consistency for the booze and flavour, and I rarely say that. well, I'm going to go review the oaked and double, so I'll find out if there is anything else I can ask for in this line of beer!"
"D - this is a very good beer and it's fairly cheap. i'd definitely drink it again."
"One of my favorites."
"D 4.5 I would rink this brew for sure, I am unsure of the cost, but I like the taste and such, it was most appreciated and a shout out of thanks to Carolyn!"
"D - Why can't all beers beer this good?"
"Bomber purchased at Green's in Atlanta. The beer looks beautiful in my glass with it's almost brown appearance and slightly fluffy head. The smell was nice also with malts and hops in the nose. The taste is where I was disappointed. Sure there are malts and hops on my tongue but I must confess that something is not quite right here. There is some type of too-sweet ingredient that I find out of place in this beer. Other reviewers have stated that they detect citrus flavors. Well, I cannot taste them. This beer is still quite drinkable and I will have more in the future. It has the potential to be a world class beer but with that sweetness thing going on I'll have to say that this beer is slightly overrated."
"D: very interesting, but a little too heavy for my taste"
"Delicious creamy mouthfeel."
"One of the best. Like any truly exceptional IPA, Arrogant Bastard uses it's hops as a keystone, not a monument. The bitter flavor is bold, but there's also citrus, malt and some spiciness. This is the IPA upon which I judge all others. Plus, the diatribe on the back label is absolutely hilarious."
"I have enjoyed this beer both in bottle and on tap and find it a great beer. Nice sharpness and hoppiness, but still a great, creamy ale with tremendous drinkability."
"Drinkability is great, I could definitely have another."
"This is very drinkable, I wish I had picked up another bottle."
"Notes - Another home run from Stone."
"On tap from rattle and Hum NY. pours very dark...small off white head. strong smell of hopps and a hint of cherry. very heavy tste of malt which almost magically turns into a malty but almost coffee/chocolate taste. this would probably be the first time I ever described something as a ""desert beer"" Nice for what it is but one is enough as far as drinkability."
"Drinkability: I like this beer and could have a couple. That being said, I will reach for the oaked arrogant bastard first"
"Looking at my avatar, you can obviously see I am a Stone fan. I have been drinking this fine ale for over 5 years now and it remains to be among one of my favorites. I refer to this as ""The Destroyer"" of beer, as it ruined my beer experience forever with weak, yellow, fizzy beer. This beer is a godsend among ales and is simply, in one word, amazing."
"D: When considering this baby is a DIPA and high in alcohol content, its very drinkable. I just polished off a 22oz in short time, and I dont feel like dying or rinsing my mouth out with water. Its a great aftertaste for the DIPA lover, and I would recommend grabbing a bomber when you can."
"Really nice, not the belly bomb I thought it would be. I could see it being a great food beer, but also would be a good ""on the deck after mowing the lawn"" beverage. Bottom line, it is alot less mouth fatty and more refreshing than I expected. Even better as it gets to room temperature, and burns off some of its tightness."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Poured a cloudy deep amber color with an off white heading. Smell is very malty immediatly followed with caramel and orange???.Very little lacing. A good deal of malts and a dry hop taste with a ridiculous bitter aftertaste. Very sticky on the lips. A great beer for tasting but probably not for a heavy session."
"My favorite stone beer so far"
"This is the first offering I had from Stone brewery and I have never turned back. This beer is well balanced, rich, complex. It has all of the qualities one would look for in an excellent beer. Easily a world class brew in my opinion."
"D - too bitter without anything else to keep my interest. Trust me I like bitter, but I like a little more fullness in the hop profile if it's going to try to blow me away."
"A classic - an icon, and still a solid, well-conditioned hit of hoppy goodness."
"Worth a try to laugh at the audacity. Pick up a bottle of Stone's IPA while your at it so after you spit this out, you have some backup."
"Buy one."
"D: While I had craft beers before AB was the one that pushed me over into the realm. I found a case today and figured it was about time I gave this one a formal review. Jammed the new 16 album Bridges to Burn and enjoyed life. This is highly recommended. If you are reading this and have not yet tried, go for it!"
"Tastes of caramel and dark chocolate. Starts off with those smooth flavors and then has a nice medium hop finish. Ever so slight alcohol on the end. Mouthfeel is nice as the beer wonders its way down. Great drinkability for this beer since I think I could easily knock out a few bombers if available."
"D- This is an excellent beer. A bomber goes down pretty quick, but watch out for that 7.2%."
"Overall, I prefer the oaked version, but its a bit too expensive for my wallet, so this is a happy substitute. Great Beer."
"D- Very easy to drink."
"I was expecting something a little more powerful, something along the lines of a belgian strong ale, and this definitely surprised me. I kind of thought it was just an extra malty IPA, but about halfway through the bomber the rich and complex flavors really came through. My only regrets are that it would be pricy to drink this stuff on a regular basis :3"
"D - Pretty drinkable. I think I could have had another if I weren't concerned about getting drunk."
"Drink one or have first."
"Into a pint glass purs and amber hued color with a thick pillowy head that stuck around lacing the glass slightly. Smelled of roasted malt and hops. Tasted outstanding of hops and malt with and alcohol backround. This beer is very strong tasting. I loved it none the less. Mouthfeel is thick and this beer is filling. Drinkability is good but would be higher if it was less filling."
"I enjoyed this beer but it isn't one that I would want to have more than one in a sitting."
"The real puzzle that is Arrogant Bastard is the taste. It is hard by sweet at the same time. Hard going down but sweet till the last drop. Just the experience a good micro fan must have."
"This beer is a great value. I just thought I'd re-state the obvious. A bomber costs me $4.99, for that price that's almost two pints at home, compared to one (or less) at a bar."
"D - Very good beer, my introduction to Stone, and this is something I can't wait to enjoy during Saints games, happy or sad"
"Overall: This stuff is really good. Not something I would drink every night. But for a cool winter's evening (if there can be such a thing in S. Florida) you could do alot worse that putting away a bomber of Arrogant Bastard."
"D: I could drink a bunch of these but the price held me back which is fine with me. Very good!"
"Pours a dark copper all over my state issued laptop. seriously. my Dell is now going to smell like ale, and I will have explaining to do, fortunately none got on the keyboard, mostly the power cord...Back to topic, dark copper with large head, partly due to the fact that it is warmer than it should be. Smells hoppy, yummy, and a bit nutty, and taste is as named, bitter, but not as bitter as advertised. A bit creamy and full bodied, heavy carbonation. A must."
"Overall: I was quite pleased with my first experience with Arrogant Bastard Ale. Is it a bit over hyped? Probably, but it's a solid brew nonetheless and definitely a new favorite."
"D-This was my first offering from Stone and I'm not let down at all.This is not for the weak,if you don't enjoy a hoppy/bitter beer leave it for me!"
"Wow, a very strong beer that hits you across the face. Unbelievable hops with a nice caramel malt profile for balance. Just a great beer."
"D: I really liked this. It grew on me as I drank it. Not a beer to hurry through. Doing that would cut short the complexities that emerge over the whole experience."
"drinkability: quality and the name is prefect."
"Glowing reddish color, strong cloudiness, pours a huge inch plus head that takes its sweet time dissolving, very lacey, residue sticks to the glass insides. Bitter hoppy and grainy nose, develops a semi-sweet character without a true source, golden raisins, pine tar, texturally feels like it slowly coils and uncoils in your nostrils. Dry and packs a wallop entering the mouth, bitters, orange peel, roasted grains, verges on grassy at moments. Raisins, cherry pits, peach fuzz, the fruit is there but sneaky. It's undeniably complex and feels like it would taste different bottle to bottle. Not a beer you can drink while out gossiping with the girls."
"D: Well, as expected, this is one aggressive beer. Obviously the hops run away with this one, but there's actually a very sturdy malt backbone, which is something that many beers like this seem to miss. This one isn't real easy to drink, but it is very enjoyable. Worthy of the hype, in my opinion."
"Notes: Yet another winner from the geniuses at Stone Brewing. The signature beer in a series of brews that all possess that same bold, in-your-face type of full flavor that one has come to expect. The sheer brashness of their attitude towards brewing better beer than anyone else really shines through with this one!"
"P.S. I tried it in bottles and draft. It's better draft."
"I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a very hoppy ale to knock them on their ass."
"I was pleasently suprised by the crispness of this beer. The ballance of this beer is exelent, one would deem this as a stong ale by first tast alone. There is not a stong alchohl flavor. The hops give this beer a crisp flavor. This is a very good beer and I see myself driking it time and time again."
"Poured from 22 oz bottle into a oversized wine glass. Deep, dark amber color. Outstanding Sticky lacing for the duration.(Over 1 Hour) That being said, I did not drink this brew very quickly as it was indeed quite strong. The smell was good... hops mostly. It is a fairly complex beer in taste but the hops clearly dominate here. I will have to try again to pick up on those complexities. Mouth feel was good although a bit syrupy and sticky which hurt the drinkability. One bottle was enough for the night. Overall a very good beer which I will enjoy again."
"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber. Dark amber brownish body with light brown / off white frothy head with excellent lacing. Interesting aroma - Citrus, earthy, caramel, toast....overall gentle on the nose...but what a surprise thereafter! Taste is predominant bitter and woody, some spice. Bitter is not in a pale ale or IPA sort of way, and much more aggressive than smooth. Palate is moderatley thick and syrupy residue that lingers a good while. Depth and complexity that leaves you guessing and wanting more...and I will definitely need more in order to put my finger on it."
"Burnt caramels are the overpowering flavor in this beer. It's filling and potent. One almost feels like one is drinking a stout, and should be prepared to be very full after this drink. Otherwise, the gasses and nitrogeny feel make this beer creep across the tongue wonderfully, and the hazelnut aftertaste will make this beer something to be glad to have on a cold winter night."
"This is not for lightweights. Arrogant Bastard has a modest drinkability factor due to the strong hops and elevated ABV."
"Overall I like hoppy beers, but this one just seems a little too hoppy for me."
"Other than that, I'd highly recommend this beer being a fixture in anyone's fridge."
"Taste has the deep malt, finishes dry, very balanced taste, mouthfeel is heavy with all the carbonation gone into the head, very unusual. Because of the relatively low abv for this type, it's an easy drinker, one I will keep in the fridge as I can find it. Bomber goes down easy. Very heavy but a nice sipper."
"I could drink a few pints of these. I will start buying them more often. BUY AND DRINK THIS BREW!"
"D - I could easily put away a few pints of this fine beer. I'm not really a hophead, but this one has just the right balance that ensures the hop profile doesn't completely dominate. Arrogant Bastard is a regular fixture in my fridge."
"Enjoy!"
"Pours a clear dark red with orangish edges, billowing cream colored head, meringue-like one finger chunk sticks around forever, thick sheet of lace all the way down. Smell: pine needles, floral, pink grapefruit, caramel, hints of cherry and plum. Taste: grapefruit, citrus rind, caramel, some leafy raw edges, roasted with a hint of dark chocolate. Given the finish, I'd swear there were oats involved. Even with all of the other amped ASAs out there, AB is still the king... brash, abrasive, but well rounded."
"D: It may not be as beautiful or complex as its seasonal bigger brother, but it's much more balanced. I've had nights wherein I put down several pints of this like water (only to feel the effects later). It's scarily drinkable. The alcohol is extremely well-hidden, so what remains is a wonderfully tasty beer that begs to be drunk again and again."
"D- Yes Yes YES!! Sorry I just really enjoy this beer. I recomend it to anyone who mentions they like a hoppy beer."
"This beer is mainly about hops. Strong flavours of cascades type flavor reminiscent of Sierra Nevada's pale ale with plenty of bitterness to boot. The second most prominent feature is the creamy head. It's almost like whip cream floating on a sundae mmm! I love the label on the back of the bottle,"warning this is an aggressive beer. You probably won't like it."""
"Nice pour head retains a little foam mound after settling. The aroma is great - solid hits of freshly cut fruit (apricot?). Each sip is its own little rollercoaster. It starts with the fruity smell as you raise the glass to your nose, then you get the medium bodied mouthfeel. Next is the sweet fruit that gives way to a bitter kick that appears and mellows after each swallow. I'm not a big bitters fan but I find this one tolerable and I know it's by design. The whole package of taste and smell easily masks its 7.2% alcohol content and keeps it highly drinkable."
"A muddy brown, quite opaque hints of copper around the edges. Head pours thick and off-white and damn does it stay. Tons of lacing around the glass. Smell is malty with essence of grapefruit and pine. More grapefruit than anything though. This is an aggressively hopped beer, though more mellow than I remember. Perhaps, the bottle is a bit on the older side. Hops come forward first, with a piney taste. A malty sweetness persists in the middle that gives way to a strong bitterness. Not quite astringent, but the alcohol is definitely there. Mouthfeel is just about perfect for this beer. Well carbonated to carry the hops and booze off the tongue. The beer is quite coating though and does seem to stick to the tongue."
"Awesome brew, highly recommend it!"
"This is simply one superb ale. Pours a beautiful burgundy-amber color under a durable, wispy off-white head. Aroma is initially dominated by the sweet malt profile. Lots of roasted malts, caramel and wheat toast notes are up front supported by a background of citrus-pine needle hop aromas. Mouthfeel is just perfect; smooth, chewy and round. Flavors in turn are definitely all about the hops here, but the sweetness of the malts balance things out very nicely. Starts out with somewhat semi-sweet dark wheat bread, smokey, fig flavor, but quickly transcends into a big, crisp and bitter hoppy long finish. It reminded me a lot of Bigfoot without the big alcohol kick and with a touch more malt."
"Recommended"
"On tap at the House Of Brews NYC from tasting notes 4/12/08"
"A fantastic beer - even better on tap than when I've had it in the bottle. Definitely worth it's arrogance!"
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer. It is extremely well crafted with no quality being overwhelming. I have reviewed both the oaked and unoaked versions...I enjoyed both, but probably would rather have the unoaked myself."
"It's very good, but could be so much better with more balance. Not my favorite from Stone, although it is their flagship brew."
"Contrary to the opinion written on the bottle, I found myself to be worthy of this beer. I must be pretty damn sophisticated. This one pours a deep, dark brown with a nice head and has a nice aroma and a nice malt taste with a huge bitter hop finish."
"Ruby amber colored with a nice fluffy two fingers of tan head that leaves decent lacing down the glass. Smells of toffee and caramel,fresh bread dough and grapefruity hops. The taste starts sweet and caramely then becomes nice and hoppy, a beautiful combination of massive flavors that pummel the palate. Complexity improves as it warms. Medium heavy mouthfeel, it coats your throat and sticks to your ribs. Highly drinkable, I always forget how good this stuff really is. Very nice."
"The taste is a wonderful balance of over-hopping and over-malting that continues all the way into a strong lingering finish. This is an arrogant bastard of beer that is hard not to love. It is powerful shit that doesn't need to offer apologies."
"Overall, this is a well balanced, super hoppy ale that goes down very easy."
"Really nice lacing. The finish will keep you busy. It starts off a bit sweet, then you notice what I think may be orange peel, it's bitter but not hoppy bitter. Then the 7.2% alcohol warms your mouth."
"Drinkable indeed."
"I had been waiting to try Arrogant Bastard until I developed the taste for hops and am glad that did. This is a great beer that I don't think I would have fully appreciated before. I'm proud to say that I am worthy!"
"D- This brew goes down way too easy...."
"This is my first review and I just had to say something about this beer. At 21 I have already developed a bitter taste for brews. I'm always searching for something I haven't tried yet that will leave my mouth tingling from bitterness. Once I saw this brew said ""You're not worthy"" I knew I had to try. It poured almost a brown which was cloudy with bubbles rising from the depths instantly. I chilled it to a near freezing temperature because I love cold brew, this might have made it more stronger tasting but I loved it. I can barely describe the taste because it changes so much so fast. After a swallow an immediate hoppy bitterness congregated on my palate. A fantastic beer! And still as my pilsner glass sits it is covered from top to bottom in the thickest lacing I've ever seen. A must do for any beer connoisseur!"
"A little boozy, but still, on par for the style."
"M - This beer is very well done. I will definitely get some more of this on my next trip to my local beer store."
"Very hearty to the taste. Strong malt notes. Very thick and earthy. Has a nice bright bitter hop flare to it. Does have a bit of a burn from the alcohol content. Don't drink this one after having a few of something else... it will push you over the top fast. Leaves the mouth a bit dry, and with a barrel aged alcohol aftertaste."
"Drinkability: I can see where a lot of people would like this beer. Myself however, cannot get over the overwhelming taste of socks. It had some high points aswell, like its full bodied flavor with complexities if you look for them. Overall, i think its an acquired taste as many beers are, but its definately a beer you should try if you see it on tap just based on its uniqueness."
"All in all, a really awesome brew that separates the hop-heads from those who aren't. I'll count myself in the former."
"This was originally the strongest (tasting) ale I ever tried until the Double Bastard. Pours ruby red and brown with a short off-white head. Dense, malty aroma, with some dried fruits and a boozy undertone. Big malt and cascade hop combination, with a sweet caramel-like backing. The alcohol is always in the forefront. Slightly wooden, and this isn't the oak-aged. One of the best beers."
"Medium bodied with a slick, but not quite oily mouthfeel. Drinkability is great. I almost wish I wasn't sharing this with some friends. Delicious!"
"M/D: The beer was rich and full bodied, but smooth and easy to drink, yet chewy. The beer had a slightly sweet and bitter finish to it. Too bad I only had one that night. Very well done beer, top notch for the style."
"D- I could sit and drink these all night. Delicious."
"D: I like this beer. Balanced flavors and good texture make me want more of this."
"As mentioned above, the brewers are not lying when they say this is not for the faint of heart. Don't give this to your friend who you are trying to ween off Miller Lite."
"Cheers!!"
"D - This is a pretty intense beer, but as every word on the bottle indicates, they were not trying to make a session beer. The hops are very aggressive and while the malt does its best to keep up with them, they dominate the flavor profile. Personally, I would prefer less emphasis on bitterness and more complex and subtle hop flavor, but that might also require less dark malt to let the hops shine through. Overall, this is an enjoyable and interesting beer, but there are better west coast hop-bombs out there."
"The finish is lasting, make you want to drink more. Very well made beer"
"(rated Jun 30, 2007)"
"Overall: If you are looking for flavor, intricateness, beauty, statements of faith for micro brews, this is not your beer. If you are hoping you'll look like an asshole buying this in the grocery line this might be for you. Dont waste your time or money and buy something else. And by all means, dont read the disclaimer on this, its definitely some of the best reverse psychology I have ever been a part of."
"Drinkability: one or two is nice, but I'm pretty satisfied after one"
"D- Drinking my second bomber as I write my review, so I would say yes, very drinkable...."
"Update (06.28.2008) - Had this again tonight, and it's still as perfectly balanced as I remember. You really can't go wrong with this beer- super hoppy for an American ale and super enjoyable for anybody who enjoys beer."
"Overall great ale looking forward to my next."
"Reviewed on 4/19/08. Bottle. Pours a dark brown with a small white head. Hoppier than I expected (a blend of floral, citrus, and piney hops), but blended really well with the malt base. The first time I had this was early in my beer palate development, so it wasn't anything special to me (especially since I didn't appreciate hops at that point). Having it a second time (now a time when IPAs and ASAs are becoming my new fave styles), I was quite pleasantly surprised and blown away by this beer! It was amazing and I can't wait to have some more again! Also I love the commercial description of this beer--so accurate! 8/4/9/4/16 (4.1/5)"
"Overall - My first ever Stone beer and i wasn't disappointed... i'm so glad this stuff has finally made it to the UK... definitely recommended..."
"D - I did a double-take, seeing Stone on tap at a local brewpub. It's good to have them here. Arrogant Bastard is a drinkable beer in the sense that you could have one or two with dinner. Beyond that, tread lightly, as to me it seems to drink stronger than 7.2%."
"D- Very drinkable and very nice."
"Not the most drinkable of brews, though the finish does beg for more. Alcohol makes itself known a little as the beer warms, but overall is well-hidden. Extremely pleasurable; the arrogance is not unfounded."
"3.5 drinkability. despite the interesting flavor profile, not sure i'd want to drink this often. the numbing effect and the acidity are deterrents, but there is also something missing in the flavor spectrum that could tie it all together and leave a greater sense of satisfaction."
"Taste started off sweet... Nice and malty with a great bitter hopp finish. It had a pleasant mouthfeel. Expecially for the 7.20 abv... Great BREW, Stone"
"Wonderful brew! Very drinkable and I enjoy it so much!"
"D - This is an excellent brew... Good looks, good scent, good taste, and good moutfeel combine to make a good beer... Complex and slightly aggressive... Alcohol provides a warming feeling... A go to craft brew for all occassions..."
"amber copper not to big of a head. big lace though. nose is pine, apple, orange peel, malt. taste is apple and malt yeasty with a pine flavor. good. tastes like their IPA and their pale ale at the same time. don't really know what the ruckus is all about. particularly compared to some of the other ones. expecting some more richness... maybe some nice caramel and leather malt would be nice. didn't get that. would definitely like to try the double bastard though."
"I really enjoyed this beer and will buy it again."
"full mouthfeel and clean finish make it very drinkable"
"D: Moderate. As good as the taste is, this is not a beer for hot summer days. For the winter, though, it does just fine."
"Poured a dark brown color with an averaged size head. Smells of molasses, piney, and some citrus. Sweet and bitter tasting (nicely balanced). Hoppy. Dark fruity. Chewy."
"The nose on the beer has a sweet caramel nose to it with a bit of hops in the background. The malty nose is pretty solid, and the sweetness comes across very well. The beer is poured a deep ruby red with a creamy white head of about an inch in height. The beer looks absolutely awesome; exactly how a strong american ale should look like! The beer is incredibly balance with a huge bitterness coming through at the end, but a sweetness lingers through the whole tasting. There is a great complexity of hops and maltiness that I can't quite put my tongue on. It's like the hops and malts are fighting for the forefront of the flavour but end up having a great compromise! I think I might have to check into chinook hops! This remeinds me of a beefed up Red Ale. The mouthfeel is nice any creamy! Exactly what I'd expect! The ale is pretty god damn drinkable as well! I could easily have another."
"M - Pretty sticky on the palate, but not dry. Nice coating"
"Overall this is a great beer. Just add this glowing review to all the others."
"Drinkability: Pretty damn drinkable, but not very true to the style. We were all big fans of Oaked Arrogant Bastard, but this one is a pretty big step down. Still a good brew that I would recommend."
"The aroma is very hoppy with pine and grapefruit. It's also got plenty of caramel. The appearance is reddish with a nice head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is smooth. This is a good beer. Despite the fact that it doesn't really have a weakness there is not as much to write about this beer as I was expecting. It's pretty straight forward."
"Overall I'm a bigger fan of this from the bottle. I like the more robust hop flavors and bitterness. I'd like to try this on-tap again to see how much it varies."
"After what seems like forever, Stome's beers are finally in Maine, Arrogant Bastards everywhere. Pours a deep brown/copper color with a thick head. Smells quite hoppy, tastes quite hoppy too, not as much as say Bigfoot, but quite hoppy with a nice malt background too. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for my liking. But overall a nice beer and a welcome addition to us here in true part of New England."
"on draft - std pint"
"The other reviews paint a good picture of what to expect with this beer, so I'm mostly just posting this to suggest a food pairing. Arrogant Bastard is really excellent with peanut butter cups. Specifically, Trader Joe's brand. I haven't had it with Reese's but I imagine that it's also quite good. Enjoy!"
"D- The great flavor and feel make up for the alcohol in this one. It was remarkably drinkable."
"D: At first tasting it lives up to its name but seems to continuously get smoother with every sip there after. You may be taken aback at first by its arrogant nature, but deep down you will find this a boozy, dry hopped treat that gets progressively smoother with every sip and will grow on you."
"Oh arrogant bastard, where have you been hiding all my life. I have never seen Stone in my neck of the woods, so you can imagine my excitement when I saw this. Appearance is something to behold. I wish I could give higher than 5, deep, deep copper color, over two finger head. Lacing follows it all the way down. Smell is a bit weak at first, but it was cracked open at 35 degrees. As it warms, up a wave of hops his as well as a bit of sugar and a touch of alcohol. Taste is great, overwhelming hops and a decent malt backbone. A little bit of sweetness but mostly just bitter hops. Mouthfeel is perfect. Drinkability for the style and hop content is very good."
"D- Very good ale. Looks as good as it tastes."
"Nice, dark red/brown color. fizzy two finger head, great lacing. Smells like an IPA/Pale little darker smelling. taste nutty, cofee, carmel finish. I have drank this many times but this is the first time reviewing. This is a good beer."
"Drinkability: This is a strong, hoppy beer that fans of either American Strong Ales or IPAs will enjoy. The kick is one that you won't forget, and it's a great beer to eat with pasta, like I did. Stone has done it again, giving us another reason to praise them."
"Taste is much like an IPA to me. Lots of hops but not as much grapefruit. A hint of malt. Very easy to drink. Well crafted beer and very ""clean"" tasting. Medium mouth feel but not a lot of bite."
"Fizzie yellow beer is for wussies. That says it all. Beer pours a dark ruby copper hue with a frothy head. The malts on the nose in this beer are quite powerful and mask the smell of the hop profile nicely. The thick malty syrup-like quality to this beer makes it like no other (except oak aged and double bastard). The huge malt character to the beer balances so nicely with the hops that they are almost undetectable. Strong alcohol is masked nicely and balanced perfectly. I want to pour this beer on my ice cream."
"Pours a dark brown colored body, with a brownish head that is big & lasting. Has a very bitter hoppy aroma. Wow sourness in the mouth. Very bitter dry, malty sour taste. Almost acidic. Warming. I didn't like this beer so much before, but now, it's growing on me."
"Mouthfeel: Appropriately full mouthfeel with some hoppy dryness."
"Gave it lower drinkability because of ABV. This is a very good beer."
"High alcohol content in this one though, I didn't really detect it while drinking this beer."
"D - Strong tasting and satisfying. This is a good beer for sure, but I might tire of the strong flavors in this one after a couple."
"Very drinkable despite the strong presence of alcohol."
"Pours into my mug with a tan three-finger head that dissipates quickly though some remains all the way down to leave thick lacing down the glass. The smell is woodsy, maybe some cedar in there, with hints of fruit (berry?) and some biscuity notes. The taste is huge from start to finish: starts off with sweet malts, moves through to diacetyls and faint caramel, then hits you hard with a hop finish that goes on and on -- big hits of grapefruit or tangelo, maybe even lemon rind. The hop finish also makes for a rather pleasantly dry mouthfeel in the end, though before that what strikes me is the smoothness of it: perfectly carbonated, just enough to fill your mouth with all this goodness. Glad to find this fresh from the keg: I prefer it to the bottled version."
"Go out and get some - you won't regret it - at least until the next morning."
"Not as good as I was led to believe, but then again I'm not really a hophead. Still probably the best hoppy beer I've had so far!"
"D: One of the ultimate American ales: explosive flavor matched with surprising drinkability. The bottle version gives more control of serving temperature and thus better exposure of the depth of flavor and aroma of this beer."
"I would give this ale high marks for drinkability if not for the huge hop bite. I love it and can drink a gallon of it, but I am afraid I must rate the style without regard to personal preference."
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. The beer is a toasted color of caramel. The head is thick, fluffy, and sticky. There are several layers of lacing in this bad boy. The smell is deceptively sweet with a hint of alchohol. The brew is smooth. This a very well balanced beer. The first sip is sweet and almost bready, Then a wonderful waterfall of alcohol coats the tongue. The finish is of wonderful aromatics, with hints of pear. The beer has medium body and is very drinkable. I think it would complement a steak very nicely."
"Nice amber color with a tan head. Good retention. The nose is a nice mixture of subtle sweet malts and bitter hops. Taste also has a nice collection of piney and floral hops over mellow candy malts. Medium body well carbonated. Classic brew from stone."
"Very drinkable beer as long as you can handle the alcohol content all night long"
"D - This is by far one of my favorite high gravity beers... glad to see it finally got restocked."
""
"D- Too drinkable for a 7%+ beer. After 2, I took a walk to test the affects. OK, but 3 would be pushing it."
"Very, almost too hoppy."
"D: Exceptionally drinkable, at least if you're a hophead. The complex and agressive flavors are overwhelming, and you can easily forget this is a 7.2% ABV beer... until you try to stand up."
"Drinkability: The last bottle I had of this was a couple of years old and was a bad experience; a fresh bottle has a lot more delicate and citrusy hoppiness and a balanced malt profile; lesson learned about aging the Bastard"
"Notes: This one is a treat, and inspired me to get off my duff as a longtime lurker and finally write my first review. This review is written while drinking the second one in as many days. Every sip brings a nuance. absolutely is one of the best ales that I have ever had."
"Drinkability is exceptional. Would drink this until I fell over. If I had that much."
"I've been looking forward to this one. Well worth the wait - fantastic beer. Its dark and heavy and riddled with flavor. Beautiful head. Malty aftertaste. The hops aren't overpowering at all, but definitely there - and the alcohol is hidden well. Wonderfully blended beer. I finished the bottle and wanted another one right away. This is one of my favorite beers - now I need the Double Bastard!"
"Appearance is hard to determine as I drank it from the 22oz bomber I got at HEB .. smell is top-notch, of good ingredients, not pasturised like most domestic beers (and many imports) Exceptional taste and mouthfeel, I paired this off with pizza and am very impressed. Outstanding drinkability as well, but the high alcohol volume (7.2%) makes it hard for most drinkers to have more than one or two in a session. Well worth the $3.99 price tag. Enjoy!"
"This one was a bit of a shocker. Bought this a few weeks in advance, waiting for the right time to crack it open. That moment came and this was the supreme beer for the occassion. It pours a dark, rich brown with a velvety tan head. It smells as complex as it tastes. Notes of hops and strong maltiness, but its also earthy and somewhat bitter, but sweet at the same time. It was crazy. I was in love. Somehow all of these flavours; the honey notes, the bitter coffee, the earthy richness, and the bite of the alcohol, all work together marvelously. It has a creamy mouthfeel that makes it even better. I was so glad I had this on reserve and I look forward to trying more from Stone."
"D - Not bad. Not a session beer. One at a time--maybe two at the most. The bitterness really prevented me from enjoying this beer."
"Praise Bacchus that this great brew is finally available in Georgia! It pours a rich, semi-transparent, appetizing brown with a thick, tan, fine-bubbled head. Aroma is strong fiercely hoppy and has a pine undertone. Flavor is richly hoppy, a hops lover's dream; it is fairly but not harshly bitter and has just a whisper of sweetness. Texture is lively and tingly, and the aftertaste is hoppy and piny."
"Pretty drinkable for what this beer is, no quarter was expected and none was given. A nice brew for taking one's time with. Im starting to see just why Stone has experienced so much success, and look forward to experiencing more from this brewery, thankfully I have a few bottles from them in my cellar. This is a beer that was brewed to satisfy the arrogant bastard within me and it does a great job of it. Highly recommended for those that enjoy bigger beers that carry a substantial hop presence."
"D - Good drinkability considering the alcohol, but the bitterness is a bit much for me. Excellent mesh of flavors, even if somewhat simplistic."
"This beer pours a brownish ruby amber with a frothy tan head that holds quite nicely with an even film and plenty of lacing. The smell is of toasted malts and HOPS! The taste is also fantastic. Its malty up front with the toasted malts and then it hits you afterwards with a huge amount of flavorful hops. The mouthfeel is a great body and has a nice carbonation. Overall, a great beer."
"Good beer but malt and hops are out of whack. Not a hopbomb, but just tons of one-dimensional bitter hops and just a whimper of timid but rich malt."
"D: If you like beers with big hoppy flavors, give this one a shot. It's complex, vibrant and highly drinkable."
"Smells of citrusy hops - grapefruit - and sugary malts - carrot cake, comes to mind for some reason. Taste is pine resin with grapefruit peel, apples, caramel. Surprisingly balanced, given the reputation as a hop bomb. But my mouth is puckering involuntarily. Very nice. Medium body, and very drinkable for the style."
"Drinkable enough, though I wont be opening another bottle tonight. I'd say it's as strong as it needs to be, though. Very pleasing all around."
"D= I've now had this ale on tap, in the bottle and also the oaked version. I have to say that I really love this ale. It has enough oomph to satisfy my taste for big beer flavors, yet was balanced and complex. I will definitely drink a lot more of this one!"
"The 7.2% ABV is not overly high for this beer. Still only wanted the one bottle. Gave me a bit of a stomach ache but it was well worth it."
"D: Well, finally got the pleasure of enjoying this brewhaha and was not disappointed. I liked the thick malty/ extreme hoppy combo and I can see why this brew has created such a buzz and almost it's own niche style. I will gladly grab this brew again and being a big Stone fan can't wait to try the Double and Oaked versions!"
"The taste of this ale is citrusy, not a sweet citrus, but a bitter citrus, thanks to the abundant taste of hops. The first half of the bottle was pretty hard to get down, and I am puzzled by the great reviews of this brew. Near the end of the bottle, I guess I have acclimated a bit to the bitterness presence of hops, giving leaving me with a non-sweet citrus only taste. Kind of reminds me of grapefruit. I really haven't minded the presence of hop flavor in beer, but lately I've had a few that seemed to hopped without any balance, leaving me with a bitter taste in my mouth for a half hour after drinking them.... this is one of those."
"D-Good session beer for the BA w/a higher tolerance."
"D: This beer lives up to its name... it's no wimpy beer and it ain't afraid to show it. At only 7.2% ABV, a bomber won't leave me feeling sleepy either."
"D: This beer slides down real easy-like, and will sneak up on you if you try to tackle more than one in a sitting. A good beer to finish the evening with! One of my favorites."
"Pours a dark rustic color, darker than i expected, with a half inch pillowey off white caramel toned head with good lacing. smell of strong hops, citrus and very sweet aromas throughout. taste of initial strong hops and citrus grapefruit notes. finished with a slight malt, a very good blend and combination of flavors that go together very well. this beer is flat out great! everything blends well and its very smooth, i would recommend this stuff to anyone, Great brew!"
"Pours an attractive rusty brown with just a tad of cloudiness and topped with a thick 1/2-inch caramel colored head. First sip is spicy hot with sweet malts and then finishes very bitter with a slight whiskey taste. What really stands out is this brew's mouthfeel. It is creamy almost bordering on milkshake like thanks to a fantastic malt backbone. The 7.2% ABV is not well hidden."
"Overall, a fantastic beer by Stone that does nothing less than satisfy."
"Certainly a nice beer and well worth trying."
"Bomber. Pours a hazy brownish-red witha creamy light brown head, decent lacing. Aroma is of caramel, nutty malts, and plenty of hops, spruce, and citrus. Flavor has a sweet malt start, buttery, and very nice hoppy finish. Very good all around beer, well balanced, and delicious."
"Huge citrusy hops offer a big bite, with some oilyness to the mouth feel. But in spite of the strong bite, there is a nice smoothness and cleanness in the drinkability. Definitely a beer that commands your attention. Nothing boring here."
"ONE nice brew!! Pours dark brown with a nice tan head. Caramel apple aroma, smells great. Flavors of caramel and citrus around the hops. Smooth body, bitter finish. A nice all-around ale with a bit of aggression at the finish but not too over-powering."
"This beer has a special place in my heart. It's one of the first brews I fell in love with when I moved out to SF. I don't have it nearly as much as used to, but an excellent bear."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, but kind of uneven. Somewhat heavy with a hoppy bite."
"A caramel dark brown with a thick creamy head, smells hoppy. Best way for me to describe this beer is heavy. This is a beer that I think tastes stronger than its abv suggests. It is very bitter but also malty... not sure if it qualifies as ""balanced", but seems like the brewer threw as much of everything into it as he could. This is not one of my favorite beers, but something I would have again."
"Drinkability: One of my staples. Excellent choice for any occasion."
"Poured this into a pint glass. Color is dark amber with moderate head that doesn't want to go away. Leaves lacing all over the glass. The smell is somewhat mild...mostly malt with some hoppiness in the background. Smells a little fruity but I can't place it. Medium to heavy body, but very smooth. Mild carbonation that makes this easy to drink for a heavier than average beer. Taste is malty. Tastes a tad smokey to me, but I like it (maybe I'm drinking it wrong?). Hops and bitterness round out the taste. A real easy beer to drink. My wife would love this. Too bad I'm going to drink it all."
"Overall, a very decent beer, but a bit more bitter than I would like in a beer like this; the hops are a bit overpowering. Maybe I'm just used to Belgian ales..."
"22oz bomber from a liquor store in Nashua, NH. Pours a hazy copper-red body with a good half-inch of off-white head. Smells amazing, juicy, citrusy, piney hops at the forefront with malt in the background. Tastes citrusy and piney with a fair bit of caramel and toffee malt to back it up. On the lighter side of moderate carbonation with a body bordering on viscous, slick. A plethora of pleasant tastes all balanced perfectly. Rich slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is hardly detectable until you start to feel the warmth. What a magnificent beer. Glad I'll be able to get this a bit more often."
"D= Not so heavy, you could drink a few. Very refreshing. I really like this beer. I could drink more than just a pint of this stuff in one sitting."
"Pours a deep reddish brown. A really kind of rustic oaky color. Beautfiul looking beer. An extremely distinctive and aromatic scent. Somewhat musky, with a kind of sour, mildly piney hoppiness. The taste isn't too distant from the scent. Nice hops coming through, dry and piney with citrus tones. Reminds me a bit of potpurri. Sour and woody, befitting of its name this one with a long, though not terribly complex finish. On the light side of medium in body. Mouthfeel isn't poor but does seem to be the most notable downside for me. Though it does have a smooth woodyness to it not unlike scotch. Overall a strong beer and well done though not exceptional."
"Huh. The bottle (or the paint on the bottle, anyway) apparently contains Cadmium and is therefore going to kill me and eat my children. Well done."
"Appearance dark red amber with a thick head and nice lacing. Smell of hop, malt and sweet bread, light citrus and molassas. Taste of hops that is nicely balanced with the malts, citrus rind leaving with a nice sweet bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick and full of body. A excellent IPA and one that stands out amongst many great American IPA's."
"Pours a deep copper with an outstanding tight white head. Great lace and retention. Smells a bit like plums and roasted malt with a great fruity hop undercurrent. It has a very elusive aroma profile. Not too malty, yeasty or hoppy. They all meld very well. Flavour is way hoppier than the aroma would lead you to think. Again kind of elusive. Bitter hops, some plum and then an almost chocolate like malt presence. Dry and bitter and slightly roasty on the finish. Mouthfeel is full but not heavy or oily. Carbonation is medium. Wow what an interesting beer. Unlike anything Ive ever had. It is like they took the best aspects from a bunch of different beer styles and fused them together into one glorious beer. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability is wonderful with this brew...glad I have another glass to go. Can't wait for Stone to be sold in NC...not sure my tastebuds are ready for this...lol."
"This beer is a favorite and im always drawn to the bottle when im not sure what beer to get. Thank you Stone!"
"overall, a great brew!"
"Exquisite feel, fullish-medium in body and drinkability off the scale for style. Kickass."
"Pours a deep dark copper amber body topped by a medium creamy tan head. Aroma is medium sweet with intense grapefruit and citrus. Flavor is grapefruit, chocolate, grapefruit and light chocolate. Perfect balance. Medium to full body. Somewhat long bitter grapefruit finish. Fuckin great beer, my hats off to Stone."
"Drinkability: an execellently crafted brew, especially for a hop head, well balanced with malt. A quality product from Stone."
"D - This definitely has some complex an interesting flavors, but I really don't see what all of the hoopla is about. This is a good beer, but the name has me puzzled. Arrogant Bastard makes me think of a massive 2XIPA that gives you the shivers with hop electricity, a RIS that kills you with thick motor-oil black evil, or a puckery geueze/lambic that strips the enamel from your teeth with battery acid chemistry. What is so aggressive about a mildly sour old ale? It's good, but not stellar."
"This beer is fabulous. First of all, I like the name. I think it really fits this beer. Deep amber color with a thick khacki head. Lots of lacing. A lot of caramel candy malts combined with a blast of bitter grapefruit hops. A little sweet but not over done with just the right amount of hop/malt balance. Rich and full. Finishes bitter and dry. I love this beer! I look forward to trying the Double Bastard."
"Drinkability: Remarkable! A truly great beer and one of my favorites. Perfectly balanced and an amazing taste. I will definitely buy this beer again and again."
"Even burping this stuff up is enjoyable"
"Overall: beer"
"It was easy to drink one bomber, but I'm not sure if I could go beyond. This is probably the best tasting beer I've tried so far."
"Semi-cloudy, deep red/mahogany color. Already lots of gumption for an Ale. True tan head displayed good retention and great lacing. Semi-sweet nose of biscuity malts and tropical fruits. Wow! Lives up to the label and name. Aggressive and complex brew. Earthy hops, rich malts and behind them subdued caramel and fruits most notably pineapple. Long finish and rewarding albeit powerful all the way through. This is a good thing but not for everyday drinking or the feint of heart. Stunning. If there is a better Ale in this world I know not what it is."
"D: I'd drink another but I had to hop on a bus to NY. Did I sleep good!"
"D - This is an unbelievable beer. Deceptively smooth, very enjoyable, and a definite must-try for all beer fans. Be sure to drink it with respect, however. It's a monster!"
"Finally got to try this beer! Pours a dark amber color with a tan head that disapears quickly. Smells sweet and hoppy. This beer is nicley carbinated, has a great mouthfeel. Maybe im not worthy because there is so much going on here! I can taste the malt and nice citrus flavors. This is a big beer with moderate drinkability. I couldn't see myself drinking more than a bomber of this. Highly reccomended."
"Wow! A dark amber body with a tan head that dissipated quickly. I was smelling a strong pineapple/citrus nose with plenty of hops, but other people disagreed with me about the pineapple. A big, yet balanced, taste finished off one of the better beers I have ever had."
"D - Yes."
"Cheers to the Brewers!"
"D: The boys in San Diego gave this beer a perfect name and it will keep you very happy through the entire quaff. Even better than I remembered from a year ago, Get this beer now!"
"mega malty, then hops take your toung on a wild ride, all beers should strive to be this one, this is world class, this is great beer, and a great bottle, any bottle that talkes crap about ""fizzy yellow"" piss beer is ok in my book, and this delevers the tast to back up the crap the bottle talks. GREAT, GREAT, GREAT BEER!!!"
"The wife helped me choose this beer while I was searching for a craft brew at a store in Albany, NY. I think she was trying to tell me something."
"D- I could have a couple pints, but not much more (well, unless you twist my arm). Tastes great, but it's gonna fill you up!"
"Pours a deep amber with a large, enduring head and outstanding lacing. The aroma is pleasantly sour with a hint of lemon. The flavor is strong and malty with delicious floral and citrusy hops, strong with grapefruit and lemon. It is sweet and carmelly - And amazingly refreshing. It has a great, medium-bodied mouthfeel and leaves a nice bitterness on the back end. Grapefruit, lemon. Lovely. Just lovely."
"Not bad at all, and a decent price tag to boot. Will revisit this one from time to time for nostalgia's sake."
"d:went through my bomber way to fast I could drink another one. I will be drining this one again."
"Superb product unless you like a nice lite beer."
"Served in a pint glass at The British Beer Company in Hyannis, MA this beauty poured a dark mahogany color with a modest but steady light tan head and excellent lacing. The aroma is light herbal hops with a touch of citrus and earthy malt. The body is very smooth and full, the flavor is a very mild citrus and nutty malt. It has a subtle but full carbonation and it is very easy to guzzle this stuff. The hops sneak up on you after a while with more bite, ending up all over your tongue. This draught version is very pleasant but it oddly falls short of what I recall of this in a bomber. Seems a little less prominent in overall flavor for some reason. Still, very decent choice and went well with my shepherds pie."
"overall, wow im very glad stone is in wisconsin finally"
"One bomber wasn't enough so I won't make the mistake of not buying more next time."
"D- Like most Stone beers, this one should definately be done in moderation. As much as I like this beer, its bitterness is quite agressive and after one bomber, I feel something maltier or sweeter is more than welcome"
"Pours a deep copper color with a tan head. In the aroma, a big malt presence, and a gritty hop. In the taste, hoppy, small grapefruit notes, and an abrasive maltiness. A bitter medium to big mouthfeel, and a dryer hop aftertaste. Big hops, abrasive, and a palate destroyer. Good, but an ending beer."
"D: I really wish they had six-packs of this stuff. However, a bomber of this is all you need. It is quite the experience, haven't had a beer like this before. Complex, flavorful and always keeps you guessing on what you detect from it. Very malty, very hoppy - a perfect American strong ale."
"mouthfeel is thick and delicious, the hop resins cling around forever and the alcohol presence is muted but still present. Drinks very nicely, but I wouldn't want to drink many in a sitting unless it was in the interest of getting drunk."
"The back of the bottles describes this as an ""aggressive"" beer, I was curious as to the meaning of this. After one taste I immediately understood and was instantly hooked. This is one of the best ales ever to pass my lips. The flavor is so complex it was like the fourth of July in my mouth. I can't wait to try their other brews. //12-7-07: I've enjoyed a number of bombers since my initial review including one tonight. This brew is one of the first beers that really lead me to the craft beer craze and for that I am very thankful. Some additional comments in regards to this great beer to complete this review. Pours a dark, burnt copper color with a very large tan head and sticky lacing. A very aromatic hop scent is emitted into the air. Bitter citrus with caramel and sweet breads. I can't believe how well the aroma permeates the air surrounding the top of the glass. Creamy on the palate with a nice bite and puckering finish. Medium bodied and filling. Grand flavor of resinous hops and roasted, sweet malts. A touch nutty, grapefruit and spruce. The flavor sticks to your ribs and assaults the senses. Overall a nicely aggressive and flavorful ale, still one of my favorites that I look forward to returning to every once in a while. A sentimental beer that deserves it's rating."
"It poured a beautiful deep amber color with a tan head that left quite a bit of lacing. The aroma is a hoppy and floral with some lingering spices. Taste is malty up front with sweet spices, some tangerine maybe also. Then there is an abundance of hops that explode in your mouth, and it finishes clean. There is slight carbonation up front, with nice creamy mouthfeel. Drinkability is fairly good. I'm on the bandwagon, very nice brew."
"Overall, something I will definitely buy again. It's a bit pricey but worth it for those occasions where you want a very strong brew."
"Overall, very impressive and venerable. Not drinkable all the time but I definitely dig this."
"Poured from a bomber into a snifter. Dark brown in color. Smell is hoppy, which is odd for a dark beer, but I like it. Taste is heavy on the citrus hops, backed up by a sweet roasty malt character that gives this brew an interesting complexity. Like nothing I've had before. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, and well carbonated, but goes down fairly easy. We'll put this one in the medium-bodied category. The bomber is going down fast, mostly because the flavor is so big and so delicious. But the ABV, which isn't incredibly high, can be felt and tasted keeping this to a once in sitting delight."
"D - Surprisingly drinkable for the abv but by no means a session beer and one that I would not mind revisiting but I like others more."
"M&D: The moderate amount of carbonation makes for an increadiblly smooth mouthfeel for this medium bodied ale. Drinkability is through the roof, at 7.2% ABV I could session this. Probably my favorite American Strong Ale I have had to date. Excellent! Skal."
"I'm very glad I got to try it."
"D: An American Strong Ale, indeed. Two and you're worthy."
"The dark amber in body topped by gargantuan off-white head. Smell is of cloves, grass, plastic action figure (no joke), some pepper, hop resin. The taste is smooth and has flavors of grass, plastics, hop resin, mild breadiness, toast and roast, booze, smooth bitterness, dry grainy finish but some resiny aftertaste persists. A little smokey and medium bodied in mouthfeel. This beer can hang out in the palate for a while, light carbonation doesn't attack the tongue and it smoothly flows down. The drinkability allows for you to keep hanging out with the Arrogant Bastard, hell, he could even stay the night. But he may want a brew too."
"Excellent."
"Big fan of this brew. Highly recommended."
"D-Really a great beer all around. Not a whole lot to complain about and this one is worth the hype - good price to boot. Drinks like a much bigger beer but there is enough room to drink more than 1 or 2."
"Dark copper and clear in color with decent size head from a medium pour but quite a bit of lacing though out the entire sipping from the glass. It smells of smoky dark fruits (black cherry and raisin is what I'm thinking), caramel and roasty malt but for the high hop profile it has not much of 'em really show up in the aroma. The flavor is quite complex and much different from what one would think strictly based off the scent. A spicy tart hop kiss touches the taste buds first but a warming molasses & malt thing surrounds it calming down. Somewhere in the middle there's a touch of black tea too. The hops and tea thing do tend to somewhat stick to the roof of the mouth but the finish, especially in the throat, is crisp and clean with a just a slight hop burn coming up as it's down the hatch."
"This is a really good beer, and deserving of its status as one of the classics of the American craft beer scene."
"My first Stone - this is a good beer (leans towards great at times) but I was expecting more given all the hype. It pours beautifully with a thick, rich head. The nose is pretty muted - mostly a maltiness which surprised me. Nice mouth feel and some classic ale flavors but it is just a touch too bitter for my taste - and I am not afraid of a well hopped beer. Next up on my list is Ruination."
"Honestly I was hoping to dispell the hype. I have to admit this is a really great beer."
"It is funny that this beer is labeled as an american strong, becuase I feel it is more like a red, or more exact a double read or an imperial red. Stone starting making this beer before the doubles and imperials were being applied to beer, so there was not a category for it then. I had this beer off of tap and in a 32 oz glass. It looked rather normal, similar to other beers. The aroma is through the roof hoppy and a little like honey from the malts. the taste is very strong bitter on the front end, but leaves smoothly. There is a full bodied mouth feel to this beer, where you will almost gag on it if you have had too much to drink. This is a great beer and I am thankful I live in CA so I can buy this is some grocery stores."
"D - If I ever win the lottery, I doubt I'll ever drink anything else."
"Maybe this was an old keg. And it was served pretty darned cold."
"Very excited to have this one (& Oaked AB I'm hoping!) across the border in Hudson soon. This one's a winner."
"Pretty drinkable, a good beer."
"The bottle is quite hilarious! I will trade for this again and again, its that damn good."
"D: I will definitely drink this many more times. It is quite assuredly one of the finer beers I have tried in long time. I don't know if this is considered ""extreme"" or not, but for my tastes, it's almost simple, and I sincerely mean that as an absolute compliment. And for $3.99 for a bomber, I think I'll have at least 2 in my refrigerator at all times."
"Notes: This is one huge ass-kicker of a beer... in a good way. Thick, over the top, and ridiculously delicious. Thank you Stone."
"drinkability is good. slightly unbalanced towards hops, somewhere between an american iipa and an american barleywine. i've had this one many times and finally sat down and reviewed it. hard to go wrong with the arrogant bastard."
"pours a beautiful deep copper color with a white head, it looks like a Belgian almost. Smells of hops, vanilla, caramel, wonder aromas dominate the nose. taste is wonderful, full of hops, chocolately maltiness, just really damn good, pardon my french. mouthfeel is full and thick, robust. drinkability is low, 1 being that i can't buy it in illinois and had to smuggle in from indianapolis. 2ndly the price lol regardless i can't wait for my next trip to indy"
"Pours a really nice ruby red/brown color that is topped by a very creamy soft beige head. Settles to a hefty little layer. Smell is a tad tame but seems to lean toward a rich maltiness with faint traces of dark fruit, soft amounts of roasted malts too. Silky mouth feel with decent amounts of carbonation. Wow! Thats different? Hops control the palate. Spicey, earthy, and consistant, not a hop bomb but really well represented. Some of the dark fruit struggles to peak out but is soon overcome by the hops. Had heard a lot about this beer, wasn't let down. Well done."
"D-For the experienced palate go for it if your just starting out read the bottle and heed the warning ""Your not Worthy""....yet"
"T: Very bitter malt character. hops are present but aren't overwhelming. I am tasting a slight black cherry undertone. Medium bodied with a bold flavor that takes no criticism. I really wish I could buy this in Springfield. for it would be a certain regular in my fridge."
"Amber colored ale with a three inch head that has good staying power.Aroma is pine.Taste is hops,sugar and pine.Another beer that is way overhyped on this site.This ale is not terrible but it is not something that I would purchase again.Give me a Budweiser over this any day!!"
"Is the Bastard"
"Overall: I can't believe I haven't rated this yet as I've had it numerous times over the past 2 years. It's pretty much now a classic American beer with iconic status. Well deserved and well done, Stone."
"Pours a clear reddish/brown color with a 1/2 finger creamy head. Extreme aromas of grapefuit, caramel, vanilla, and malt. Complex blend of grapefuit, lemon rind, and carmelized malt with a tea finish. High carbonation, medium body, cleanses the mouth while leaving a chalky mouthfeel. Easy drinkability despite the 7.2%."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. I actually was thinking it was going to be over the top with all the arrogant marketing and from what I had heard. This was far from what I experienced, it was a very complex and well balanced beer. One that I will certainly be enjoying again."
"Big airy off white head, dark amber in color with red outlines. Smell is bold with toasted malts and citrus fruit/piney hop is heavy with some alcohol tingle to the sent. Bitter heaven up front with huge malt backbone throughout, overripe citrus fruit flavors finishes with more dry bitter brillaince. Good mouth feel and surprisingly drinkable for this huge brew."
"D: Definitely drinkable, although with high alcohol content and the bitterness I don't know how sessionable this brew would be. I have yet to have a beer from Stone that in any manner disappointed me. They continue to surpass my expectations at every turn."
"D - The style is an American Strong Ale, so it's no surprise the abv is on the high side. The flavors mask the abv exceedingly well...I can definitely feel it though. Like I said, the flavor has really grown on me. The refreshing finish also bolsters the drink. Medium to full body, so it is capable of filling you up, however."
"D: Arrogant Bastard is an extreme, complex, and quality beer. The ABV, flavor complexity, and bitter finish limit drinkability somewhat, but it's still a high-quality beer that everyone ought to try at least once."
"Served in my Delirium Tremens tulip. Poured a translucent mahogany; excellent clarity. Rocky, off-white head. Good retention that eventually coalesced into a dollop of white in the center. Head was reconstituted with a light swirl and completely refreshed with each pour. Scent of hops, hops and more hops, as well as a hint of pine and citrus that lent a medicinal quality to the nose. Also thought I detected some dark-skinned fruit in there. Taste was consistent with nose and flavors seemed a bit muddled. Lingering bitterness between quaffs left a bad taste in my mouth. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and lightly effervescent with a mild burn up front. Bottle was right; I didn't like this one. Not at all what I expected. Probably won't bother trying the oaked version."
"I finally found a place that had this beer on tap last night and I was not disappointed. I was surprised with how dark the beer was and the smell was very pleasant. The first sip I was not impressed but on a second attempt I was greatly impressed, I will chalk the fist sip up to ... whatever. I have had this in bottle before and there did not seem to be much of a difference. Definately a yummy beer and I look forward to more."
"Drinkability: A really delightful beer fresh or even with a bit of age on it."
"General Impression: very good, but a special occasion ale for sure"
"Taste is sharp of citrusy hops predominantly, with a bit of herbal tones in there. Sweet caramel undertones are present, with some toasted malt also in the background. Mouthfeel is smooth and full. Very easy to drink. A very good beer."
"Easy to drink, another amazing Stone that it took way too long for me to try it for the first time; but certainly not the last. It is just one short step behind alpha king on my list of great IPAs (although classified differently)."
"This is probably one of my most favorite session beers. When I see it on tap, I know what I'm usually drinking the rest of the night. This beer pours a nice chestnut brown with a tan two finger head. The smell consists of hops and spices. Hops, malts, spices, and caramel are all present in the taste. It has a crisp hoppy mouthfeel and if you love hops, you'll love this beer."
"Wow what a beer. There is no surprise this comes from Stone Brewing Company. This beer has a great head, appearance, and taste. It has a nice hopped bit to it, and a delicious citrus tang. I feel this beer has a strong body with a great mouthfeel, coats well and leaves a delightful linger. One of my personal favotite American Strong style beers."
"Love it!"
"Drinkability is moderate as alcohol is moderate and flavors are good. It's a good beer, but I was hoping for a little something more."
"A wonderful, beefed-up ale, one which will put metaphoric hair where there wasn't any before, as evidenced by my girlfriend ceding me her share of the bottle, in exchange for some relatively 'tame' strong Belgian ale, after a mere few sips. And due to its all around, in-your-face nature - one serving at a time would be plenty (trying not to mouth the words as I re-read this)."
"D: This is a fine beer that can easily be enjoyed. I don't know if I personally would drink more than a bomber at a time but I would definitely keep this one in the house. Great brew!"
"Full bodied, very creamy/chewy mouth feel. A huge beer... Delicious on so many different levels."
"The lighter body makes this an easy drinker. However, the strong bitterness makes it a worthwhile sipper. The malt flavor presence is enough to make it very drinkable. 7.2% ABV is not too high, not too low, it fits right in there."
"Pours a clean mahogany, with a glorious white head and serious lacing. The smell is of floral hops, malts with some serious sweetness. The taste is predominantly of hops, though they are nicely complemented by toasted malts. There is a definite sweetness to this beer. Also, the yeast peeks through, making this brew far more interesting than your average hop monster. The mouthfeel is not quite up to par with the rest of the beer, a bit syrupy and not quite crisp - this seems to be a characteristic with which hoppy beers seem to struggle in general."
"Great Beer, even pretty drinkable... in fact, you'll only want to drink this once you've had it, which is good, because all other beers will most likely taste slightly ""light"" after this one."
"It's a good beer to sit back and appreciate. One bomber was all of the beer I needed for the evening."
"Taste starts with a kick of hops and bitterness, some slight caramel malt presence, and reverts back to the bitter aftertaste, very earthy."
"Once THEY bite you on the ass, you're hooked for life."
"As the bottle mentions you are not even worthy of drinking one, but that doesn't stop me. Definitely not suited for all but very drinkable by those ""worthy""."
"D- Very good brew. I enjoy this one but not one I could have every day."
"The aroma was dominated by bitter hop tones and the taste followed suit. Short-lived (im talking did-I-taste-it-or- just- imagine- it short- lived) caramel malt follows by big hops. That's the story. I haven't drank much of this style so I don't know if this is typical for it. Certainly the makers were looking for a big hoppy ale and they did it well. Still not as drinkable as some other beers (IPAs mostly) that also featured this same dominant trait."
"Notes: I never seem to get sick of this beer; an absolute classic of American craft brewing."
"Final Thought: The label doesn't lie, this is a monster of a beer that receives valedictorian status! One of the best I've ever had..."
"Overall a very nice treat I'll try and stock up on."
"D: Higher ABV is a little higher that makes it hard to drink many in one sitting but it is delicious."
"Very nice."
"I had this on-tap at the Houston Flying Saucer Draught House and Emporium."
"This is a hell of a beer, another great offering from stone. Pours a nice dark orange with a medium head. Smells sooo hoppy, can't wait to dive in. Tastes like it smells very hoppy and bitter, absolutely excellent. After the bomber I feel like I've had a 4 course meal, great beer. If you are not ready take the warning on the back seriously."
"Notes: I think the diatribe on the bottle is really funny and I was intrigued to try it.One could say this Brewery is pretty self confident and cocky but when you got it,you got it."
"Certainly a unique beer. Pours a deep dark ruby with good off white fluffy head. Nose is citrus hop and sweet malt. Taste starts off sort of malty, with slight barleywine notes, then cascades into a short sweet sugar taste, followed by a long ride of citrus/pine hops. A good bitter bite on the finish, and the malt sweetness licks the lips. Mouthfeel is quite good, great thickness to it, reminds you of the good malt presence, and the drinkability is quite good for the style. Great beer, and a go to classic when in the mood for some plain old arrogant gluttonous hop and malt face slapping goodness. sweeet!"
"M&D- A light but creamy beer with a syrupy sweet aftertaste. There is an average amount of carbonation that makes the flavor linger on your palate. Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. I could drink this beer at almost anime. On a hot day after working the yard, or on a snowy Sunday watching football. In fact I can't think of a time that this beer would not be acceptable. However, the ABV does creep up on you after a few. Be careful not arrogant when sucking a few of these bad boys down."
"Definitely not a beginners beer, it will take some appreciation for beer to understand the complexity and care that is taken into every batch of Arrogant Bastard. Wonderful balance of hops, alcohol, and raw ale flavors. Now I just need to find somewhere on the East Coast that sells it on tap...."
"MF&D - Medium to full bodied ale. The oiliness of the hops really coated my mouth well and the malty sweetness made this one a lip smacker."
"The flavour is strong and rich with a lot of malty-caramelly sweetness offsetting the strong hoppy bitterness. It has citrus and pine flavours. It just maintains the balance to avoid being harsh."
"MF&D- Medium to full bodied especially for an ale. Coats the mouth well leaving leaving behind a nice sticky feel. Does not taste anywhere near its 7.2 ABV so beware. Stop reading this review immediately and go out and by a bunch of these bastards."
"First taste is sharp! Its astringent, its hoppy, its got some serious bite! It slowly becomes smoother and provides that nice hop fix that draws me to beers like this. The hop bite and the alcohol warming are a nice combo. There is not a lot of malt backbone to the Arrogant Bastard, but you know what? Who cares? It doesn't need to be a well balanced example of anything. Its supposed to be what it says it is...aggressive!"
"So, unless you want to become an arrogant bastard please drink responsibly."
"Poured from a bomber into a pilsner glass, was an adventure in itself. It looked as if the pourer had made some error and the head would overflow the glass and just as it was about to get ugly it settled and came together perfectly. The heavy head joined the liquid like a Guinness pour on speed and what was foam on top quickly joined the beer on bottom. It had a chesnut brown color and a half inch of head with heavy lacing. The smell was a mellow maple malt. It had a maple fruity taste with a bittersweet aftertaste, almost like coffee but not so strong. Was heavy bodied for an ale, but in a good way. A well balanced tasty treat, delicious to the last drop. Need to keep in mind the 7.2 APV because I don't get a stong alcohol flavor and I could definately have a few of these. The Devil made me do it and I will do it again soon, you should too."
"Final thoughts - Extremely smooth, one of a kind brew. Definitely worthy of the name."
"D: Tasty enough to deserve another. A little more subtle than its oaked brother, and perhaps my personal preference. That's not to really say it's ""more mild," though. Delicious."
"D - I fall in the minority on this beer. Complex and beefy, yes. But the salty taste does not appeal to my taste buds. The advertising punches above it's weight."
"D - This is an awesome brew if the abv was a hair lower I could session this for a strong ale the taste is great everyone should give this beer a try"
"Pours ruby brown with a mahogany heart. Tight, compact white head slides down to an atoll around the glass. Smell is piney, resiny sap with some tangerine zest and backed up by a sweet, bready caramel malt background. Taste is very refreshing. Sort of similar to a bigfoot without the creamed mouthfeel. Hits the front of the tounge with sweet, toasted raisin bread, hints of maple syrup, all quickly balanced out across the tongue with a bit of piney hop. Finishes clean and dry, not to heavy on the mouthfeel. Refreshing."
"Really a good beer, no matter who may or may not be worthy. Really good sipping beer."
"Yup that first sip is HOPPY..citrus, dry bitterness very good. I can feel the warmth of this one..7.2%. Nice finish. the malt and hops blend together nicely. A very good ale....I've never been disapointed with STONE."
"From a bottle into a pint glass with a slow pour. Deep red brown color like mahogany. Foamy off white 1.5 inch head. Head retained for a while. Lacing down the whole glass. Smells of pine, maybe hints of grapefruit, and I get some grass. Not fresh cut grass, but grass you smell when your out in the field playing some baseball. Makes me think of my little league days. Nice hop profile balanced with a great malt backbone. Nice long finish. Pretty arrogant brew. Does a good job of ripping through my tongue but I am loving it. Incredibly smooth and easy to drink. Don't think i could do more than the 22 oz bottle at once. This beer screams to be paired with game or steak imo."
"I thought this would be up there with the Rogue IPA, but it wasn't quite that good. It was still more robust than a typical IPA, and it had a good, clean hops flavor with some malt. But it didn't have as much flavor, and it wasn't as well-balanced as the Rogue. However, the Stone was deceivingly smooth and easy to drink, considering it's 7.2% alcohol."
"D: A good beer... tends to slow down after the second serving.."
"Drinkability- Very good beer, dangerously drinkable, will sneak up on ya."
"I'm in love with this beer. If Stone has a musician endorsement program, someone please let me know because I would drink this beer on stage every night!"
"22oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Pours a dark brown color with a light tan head that turns leaves a good amount of lacing around the glass. The aroma is very nicely balanced with a good amount of malt to support the hops. The taste much like the aroma is very nicely balanced. The hops definitely holds the spotlight in this brew, but the malt holds its own providing a very nice backbone. Overall, this is a very enjoyable brew that is extremely well balanced but features enough of a kick to satisfy any hop fix. If this were available here, I would Arrogant Bastard by the case. Highly Recommended!"
"M/D - Top notch. This beer had a great taste, good carbonation and was very easy to drink. Cant wait for these guys to start showing back up in Tennessee."
"D - when a strong ale is called for this isn't a bad option at all."
"This was actually quite good in the long run. I was not impressed at first but the beer seems to wake up as it warms in the glass and breaths."
"Highly recommend!"
"drinkability: very nice - good drinking beer."
"An excellent example of the style, really a joy of a sipper."
"A rich, complex, and satisfying ale, almost a wine in many ways. There are more flavors and aromas here than I can begin to count, and my grasp of the english language isn't firm enough to describe all the sensations this beer brings about."
"mouthfeel no noticeable warming feeling from alcohol and seems to be a bit thin. Very drinkable alcohol aftertaste seems to dissipate after a few drinks and the thinness allows you to drink it very easily could be a very dangerous beer at 7%"
"This is a great and complex beer that I would love to try repeatedly and on-tap. A strong offering from Stone."
"D: The flavors are layered one after another which makes me want to drink sip after sip to find more flavors. Not something to party all night with but nice to have a bomber while hanging out alone."
"D - This brew have a sinister side but good."
"Poured a deep red/copper color to it. It has a big hop aroma, too, very citrusy and piney. These people must love using cascade, chinook or perle hops. It has a slightly heavy body, but is definitely drinkable. With your first taste you get the wonderful citrus piney hop flavor on your palate and then it mellows out and the bitterness flows through leaving a nice crisp finish. This is a very nice beer to drink and because of the big hop flavor you don't even realize it weighs in at 7.2%."
"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Poured into a nonic. Dark ruddy copper in color with a thick off-white head. Tons of lacing. Aroma is chiefly hoppy, with lots of tropical fruitiness and a big dose of pine. Taste is again hop-centric, with mango and grapefruit chased with a numbingly epic bitterness. Malt is also in full force, with lots of caramel and dark fruit. This is a bona fide tongue-raper, in a good way. Finish is long, dry, and very bitter. Killer beer, only for the worthy."
"I didn't like the smell or the taste. It smelled very pine-hoppy and tasted likewise. This is the second time that I have tried Arrogant Bastard from the bottle. The first was prior to learning about beer styles and their characteristics so I figured that I should try it again. Maybe it is better from the tap if it is sold that way."
"This is a brew, and a name, that'll I'll remember."
"I would expect such a complex brew to feel a bit harsh, but it's fairly smooth, and leaves a crisp aftertaste making you want more. I yield to this brews arrogance. I am not worthy."
"The first beer that I wouldn't be able to drink all day long."
"Hopefully I was worthy of this one!"
"Pours a deep red, with a medium tan head. Smells of floral hops. The taste is very malty, with a strong bitterness to match. There seems to be not that much of a hop flavor though, most of the hops shine through in the bitterness. Reminds me of an English strong ale with more bitterness. Mouthfeel is rich, carbonation levels are low and smooth. A quite drinkable beer, that tastes fantastic. I really wish I could get this back in Oklahoma."
"D. Very drinkable but not a session beer. I would not mind a couple of them over an early spring evening at home. A bit heavy but not as much as one might expect given its heartiness. Overall a good recommendation, but I still prefer the Stone Ruination IPA if I had to choose. Cheers!"
"guess i got drink if given again. but will not by ever"
"This is probably a lot more drinkable than expected for the alcohol content. Has always been a favorite and still is. Extremely well done."
"D- Very strong and distinct beer, yet very drinkable. This is the beer that turned me into a craft beer enthusiast, so it will always hold a special place in my liver."
"D: A pretty strong ale but its really good. Try one on today."
"This is a great beer, as most Stone beers that I've had have proven to be. The 7.2% ABV doesn't really show through much at all. Definitely something that I try and always have on hand in my fridge."
"D: Definitely a drinkable beer. An excellent balance of hops and malts. The hops are more evident in the beginning, but become much more balanced out towards the finish."
"Pour is reddish brown with a light head. Smell is malty sweetness, with some hops showing through. Taste is sweet but not overly at all, followed by a mild drying hop finish. Thich, and rich for the style, while flavors are somewhat mild actually. Nice bitterness at first, but it turned medicinal and aspirin tablet-like a bit. Not bad, but wasn't too crazy about it either."
"The label's right - not for beer wimps."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full and very smooth, a lush and easy drinking brew."
"Not the best beer I have had of this style but not bad either. Appearence dark amber almost reddish brown in color. Smell sweet malt floral and cirtus hop notes. Taste sweet caramel malt hint of molassess nice bitter finish citrius and grapefruitie. Mouthfeel thick with mediem carbonation. Drinkability ok this is a once in a while beer."
"Nice thick mouthfeel. For some reason, I've just never appreciated this beer as much as I should. I always find myself grabbing the oaked version, double bastard, or ruination instead. Solid, pleasing product."
"D: Very light feeling and drinking for the ABV. Great beer that you can enjoy year round."
"D: You can't drink these all night, but I would definitely drink this on a regular basis."
"Definitely lives up to its warning that this is not for the carbonated macro brew drinkers. This will definitely be something I get again and again."
"As does the taste, Arrogant Bastard sends the message that it means business. The caramel is very pleasant, but not too sweet, and combines with the fruit very nicely. I was surprised at the rather dry aftertaste, which doesn't go well with the rest in my humble opinion. Yet this is a very good and worthy brew, more than worth trying but worth its weight in gravitas. This beer has nerve and lives up to its braggadoccio. Well done."
"Very good beer."
"A while back, I had sampled Stone's Oaked Arrogant Bastard Ale, and really enjoyed the extreme flavor... the brewery's original ale is just as good, if not better, in my opinion... absolutely amazing dark-copper, prune-colored appearance with a gigantic frothy and foamy head that almost obliterated my drinking glass... smell was replete with caramel and bitter hops along with a tinge of vanilla... strange how the taste strongly complemented the aroma with honey flavors, caramel, strong hops, bitter florals, and slight vanilla... the flavor is truly extreme, aggressive and dominating... the strong ale flavored is extremely loaded with hops and a strong taste that completely dominates the pallate and doesn't let go... this has to be one of the most dominating and extreme American brews... definitely not for the faint-of-heart... really thick and rich stuff... if you like stronger, full-flavored beers, this one is definitely recommended..."
"D - This goes down so well. Very drinkable. This is not the greatest American Strong I've ever had, but it is a gold standard for the style. Solid."
"hearty, malty flavor, with a nice strong kick of hops. really well balanced and amazingly smooth. i just can't get enough of this!"
"D- I really liked this beer and would definitely drink it again. It was full of flavor which I drank a savored slowly. I can see the alcohol sneaking up on you after a few."
"This is an awesome beer. It pours a nice amber color from the bottle with a nice lacy thick tan colored head. The aroma is of roasted malts and great flowery hoppy aroma. The taste is excellent! The malts come through as the base and the hoppy bitterness follows through to the end. The mouthfeel is excellent and it is velvety especially for a beer of this gravity. The drinkability is excellent. I could drink alot of these if I could. This beer is awesome, pick it up if you can."
"D - Could drink several, but wished it was more of a session style. Just very refreshing for a stronger ale."
"D: Very cool beer, definitely one worth trying."
"Spur of the moment went to Spec's and picked it up...friend liked it so had to try it. Dark brown in color with a smell that resembles flowers. Taste is almost similar to an IPA and also goes down real smooth. Overall i would definately recommend this beer to other people."
"D: It was a bit over hopped and bitter for my taste but great craftsmanship is hard to hide...this is a well put together brew that merits great respect. I doubt it will be a longterm resident of my stash but I will never turn it away from my lips."
"D- Ah, I remember the day when AB was too strong for my delicate palate, now I find it smooth, balanced, and honestly, easy-to-drink; i usually have access to various forms of AB and other Stone special releases, so I am rarely going out of my way for the regular old AB, but it is still delicious!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Drinkability is good. This is my stand by and one of the first beers that got me into craft brewing."
"Medium in body, rich, smooth, and chewy. Very drinkable - aggressive, but complex and smooth enough to have a couple in a sitting. Great beer."
"I'll definitely buy this label again."
"Overall, this is a quality ale. Would definitely recommend tipping this one back. I was much impressed with this Stone offering, as it clearly lived up to the hype."
"I really wish Stone distributed here in Missouri, but I guess those of us out here in Anheuser-Busch country aren't worthy."
"AB leaves nothing to guess... it is Big. It is a beer I unfortunately always overlook/take for granted... I really should buy it more often... but the rational side of me always says ""the AB will always be here.. try something different."" I will make an honest effort to enjoy it more often.... too often, other beers leave you wondering what if the upped the malts/hops/alcohol ... ETC. AB leaves nothing to guess.... that being said, personally I prefer its bigger brother."
"D - This beer is all about hops. Quite nice IMO!"
"D- This is hurt because of the hoppy bitterness to it. Alcohol also hurts it as well. But a beer that is definately worth a second try."
"Appearance is a nice dark brown almost reddish color with a huge three finger head. It smells great with a strong hoppy, floral and sweet aroma. This ale is clean and fresh tasting with plenty of hops, however there is less residual bitterness than in Stone IPA. The hoppy freshness is balanced with some malty sweetness and hints of toastiness. There is some fruity (perhaps grapefruit rind?) taste mixed in there as well. While there is a significant hoppy character to this brew, it is a delicious beer I could drink often. There is no need to be intimidated by the label or the name, if you enjoy Sierra Nevada Pale Ale or Liberty Ale you will probably like this one as well. Cheers!"
"D: The only thing keeping this from being one of my go-to brews is that here in Michigan the price is pretty steep at $4.29 a pint. But you're definitely paying for quality. I will definitely be getting one of these every few weeks or so."
"I will be visiting the ""Bastard"" again soon, I just might wear gloves the next time I handle the bottle."
"D - pretty good, I really like this beer (I like the IPA even more) and wish Stone sold more of their stuff in Texas or at all in Georgia. I'd definitely enjoy this more often if I could buy it where I lived! Get in GA, Stone! Anyway, pick it up if you can."
"Taste is strong bitter with citric hops that show a bit rough edges. Maltiness is not as strong as the smell would make me suspect, but it still is heavy on the malt. The alcohol is warming and mouthfeel is sweet and a little thick."
"I think this achieves a nice balance between maltiness and hops, and is no doubt quite a bit bitterer (objectively) than the impression it gives. Quite drinkable for such a big beer. I think the two strong points of this one are balance and nose."
"D - Okay. So complex it becomes intriguing. This is one elusive beer, hiding itself beneath folds of hop and bitterness. It leaves much to discover, but will certainly turn off those who are weak of palate and cannot handle the intensity."
"Pours a cherry brown with a lingering massive head that leaves a fair amount of lace on the way down. Nose at first seemed like blueberries, but calmed down after a minute. Taste is massively complex and thorough. Sweet edge follows a burst of hop flavor with a deep almost oaky presence, which turns into what I want to say is a slight alcohol presence on the end. Not for the faint of heart, or palate. This beer is complex and lacks mercy for those who are immature in beer."
"This brewery continues to amaze me. Need to visit it someday."
"D - Great beer. I love this. If you like this also try Oaked Arrogant Bastard and Double Arrogant Bastard."
"Taste is massive hops up front, followed by more hops, then a lingering hop aftertaste. There's a mild malt presence that gives it a dry quality. Feels slightly thin and bubbly."
"I am not worthy..."
"This is a very goog beer and I wish it was more availible in the upper midwest. This is a very good example of the style and I hope to enjoy it again."
"Pours deep redish copper with a good size head that laces nicely to the glass. Aroma of bready malt and huge hop additions. Interesting mouthfeel from all those bitter hops. Taste is extreme and almost unbalanced but none the less very very delicious."
"Just a side note: this brew is not for the faint of heart. It's big, complex, very raw, and very sophisticated. You need to know what you're getting into before you buy it. If you don't like hops don't get it, if you don't like big brews don't get... if you dare. But I'm defiantly going to get this one again."
"Drinkability: A beer that has such a strong, long lasting hop flavor is not something you could drink a ton of. Very tasty and something I would drink often, just not several in an evening."
"Cheers to NCSUdo for the extra."
"The drinkability is decent, but the heavy flavor would make it difficult to enjoy several of these."
"D: I would like to spend an afternoon with a number of these, as I cannot see tiring of this great brew! I especially like how it changes as it lowers in temperature, started at 50 degrees. I will be offering to guests."
"I was really excited to try this after tasting Stone's IPA, which I loved. 22 oz. bomber poured into a pint glass with a nice one-inch frothy head. Color is a deep reddish brown. Smells of malts, hops, and earthy nuts. The taste reminds me of a strong brown ale or nut ale. I likened it to Samuel Adam's Brown Ale, but this beer is much better. The balance between caramel roasted malts, hops, and earthy nuts is a lot better. Great flavor. It's followed by a warming 7.2% alcohol; not a huge amount, but noticeable. Overall, another winner from Stone."
"Very nice beer. Not sure if it's worth $55/case, but it is a high quality example of a strong ale."
"Drinkability: I could drink more than a couple of these without getting tired of it. But then I would get tired of it.. because it's like slamming a grapefruit into your brain to get you drunk."
"Poured from the Arrogant bomber (which is a treat in its own) into chalice. Pours a richp mahogany brown with a slightly off-white head. Not a huge head but not too small, not the greatest retention, some lacing. Smell is hoppy with some caramel and some alcohol. Taste is great, very complex so I'm sure I'm missing something here. Some citric notes, mainly pineapple with a touch of hops and some sweetness too. An almost chocolate taste as it goes down. Medium to almost thick mouthfeel I would argue and a slightly oily feeling left behind but its not necessarily unpleasant. Overall a good beer, ABV is a little high but for the most part easily drinkable and a real treat."
"Scott"
"Had this at Moan and Dove on-tap. A heavy head with a dark brown appearance. Very heavy on the malts when sniffed, however, it seems a little off-balanced with its other aromas such as citrus and caramel. This hinders it from being perfect. This had a decently bitter taste overall, some sweetness here and there with sips. High carbonation allows you to drink it with some refreshing-ness. In general, this was another great drink from Stone."
"Has this from a 22 ounce bomber. Poured an attractive reddish-brown color with a good head that lasted a while. Aroma was fruity and very hoppy. Flavor was also a bit of citrus with very hoppy flavor. Very smooth and easy to drink. Mouthfeel was excellent. I would have again and again and recommend."
"nice job stone... i like how it starts you off thinking it will be sweet all the way through than explodes the bitterness on you like a timebomb...did not expect this one to be so smooth though..not that its a bad thing...and like they say you really have to appreciate what they were trying to do to understand this so many people ""probably won't like this beer"" but i do recomend it to hop lovers and sweet malt lovers...it goes both ways which is very impressive on both ends."
"Translucent medium brown an initial half inch of head that dissipates to a thin layer. Good lacing. Hoppy aroma that doesnt mask the rich bready malt. Plenty of carbonation, a little swirl of the glass visibly thickens the head. Taste begins with pine and citrus that is follow by a rich malt that is slightly sweet and finishes dry and bitter. This is a good ale with nice balance (for my tastes anyway). I could drink this all night, there is always something new in each sip."
"D - The hop finish could quickly overwhelm my palate, but the malt flavors balance it well."
"The bottle says that many people may not like this beer. They are correct. Not a pleasant beer to drink. I agree, in principle, with what this beer is trying to do (educate people on the difference between macro lager crap and big business), but they failed in my opinion. The key is balance. There is just too much hops and nothing else. Try something else."
"D: This is very drinkable except for the bitterness in the aftertaste. I will probably end up drinking this again, but it is not my favorite."
"Overall, great work from Stone. I look for this beer whenever I can, but I can't find it in Kansas. A real treat indeed."
"Overall: I'm a bit nostalgic about this beer, as a draft of this in California was really my introduction to extreme beer. Granted it's not that extreme today, but still a fantastic beer that is a joy to drink ."
"The beer poured dark brown with hints of ruby showing. There was a tan head and bits of yeast ""floaties"" suspended in my glass. I was expecting an onrush of hop flavors, but was surprised that I initially greeted with a sweet malt flavor. However, the hops soon dominated the beer's flavor and the finish was bitter. This beer was full bodied and had a smooth, oily mouth feel. I would not recommend drinking Arrogant Bastard on a hot sunny summer day, but for a chilly autumn afternoon, it is a great beer."
"The arrogant bastard pours a deep red with a huge foamy head and aggressive lacing down the side of the glass. I didn't see a freshness date. The smell and taste were malt dominated with some hops on the side. It had a in your face spiciness at the finish on the palate. This was one bastard of an ale that I would recommend."
"D - Suffers a bit here, for me at least. I doubt I could put back more than two. Overall a powerful punch and another great brew from Stone."
"A great beer, it pours out a nice dark caramel color with a great head and very nice lacing. It has a wonderful scent, not overly bitter at all, just a nice clean and crisp ale aroma. A wonderful taste as well, an excellent balance of malts and hops, leaning towards the former, with a nice, but not overpowering, hoppy aftertaste. Goes down fantastic for such a high ABV beer, and good in its comparison to all other ales. An excellent brew."
"Another beautiful beer. This rubyish beer pours real nice with a good finger's worth of head. It smells clean, crisp and hoppy. The taste? Well lets just say you should try some yourself its worth your time. If you can't wait and need a spoiler then here it is. First taste is slightly sweet and malty, not fruity but a good ale flavor. This is what beer should taste like. From there the hops creep up your tongue and do a little dance on your taste buds. After you swallow the bitterness of the hops stays with you for a few moments. It doesn't leave a bad bitter taste in your mouth but it does whet your appitite for more. This beer doesn't suck."
"The surprising low carbonation and not overblown hops make this a very drinkable beer. Moderately creamy mouthfeel"
"Poured out of the badass bottle into a pint glass. Has a very nice color with a good head that dissipates fairly quickly. This beer is very unique - but definitely tasty. It certainly lives up to its name as it is very in your face with all of the hops. I can't quite put my finger on any particular flavor in the taste, but it is relatively complex. Definitely glad I got my hands on this. An excellent brew."
"This is the beer that opened up hoppy beers to me, and I have not looked back. The hops numb the tongue and I love it. Alcohol adds spiciness and warming but never gets in the way. It is in your face, and I could not drink more than a bomber in one sitting. I do like year-old Oaked Bastard better than this, but this is definitely a staple for me and a new classic beer."
"Beer poured an amber red color with a strong off white head that is well sustained. Nose is a pleasant boquet of floral hops, a hint of what is about to hit the palate. Taste is a hint of caramel malts and a blast of those floral hops. Mouthfeel is full bodied and very smooth. Drinkability is very good. I have always looked at this beer as a junior version of the barleywine style but a much more drinkable one. Definitely worth a taste!"
"I'm no wimp. I like spicy foods and hoppy beers, but Arrogant Bastard is definately not for me."
"And if things weren't good enough, this was a perfect compliment to a cannoli & a 1-0 Pens victory over the Rangers. P-E-N-S Pens Pens Pens!!!"
"The bottom line is that this is a well-brewed beer that is very ""arrogant"" indeed with it's presence. I enjoyed it, and suspect that others who appreciate a full presence and hop flavor will as well. I don't believe I could drink these all night, but I'm sure some could!"
"Very thick mouthfeel this is a high alcohal brew but I think even with the bitterness I could drink quit of bit of this brew."
"Chocolate brown, mahogany, bronze (to light) with a full brown head, sediment floaters, good carbonation, and little lace. Nice balanced malt and hop aroma; chocolate malt notes and piney hop aroma. Tastes much like it smells with an overly bitter finish; not pleasantly hoppy. Full bodied and creamy with a harsh bitter finish."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into glass. A malty hop aroma, some bread notes as well. Taste is very full bodied, tons of flavors, from hops to citrus to, well, there is a little bit of everything in this beer. Great beer!"
"D- Kind of strong to just put away too much, but very enjoyable brew. I liked it, and I will pick some more up when I am back in the area that sells it."
"REVISED after having on cask at Linkery in SD. Unreal."
"I really like this beer, and would put it in my top ten list"
"The drinkability is limited only by the alcohol content."
"This beer poured a nice pleasent mahogany brown color. It had a nice foamy head that stuck trough my drinking. I prefer it cold, when it got warm the taste sorta got over powering. The mouthfeel was rather heavy but pleasant. It tasted fantastic with some great hot wings!!! It finished a lil strong for my taste but when I am in the mood for a heavier beer I would definately go for this one!!!!"
"One of the best out there. If you love beer, you owe it to yourself to try this. Heck, even if you don't, reading the bottle itself is worth the price of purchase."
"Drinkablitiy is almost as good as it gets. Very easy to put down and the alcohol is very well hidden"
"Believe the hype, this is a great beer."
"I bought this at Cost Plus on a special occasion (1 year anniversary at my job). I was intimidated by the commentary on the label, but after a bottle, I said to myself ""This is what beer should be."" A slight bitter taste reminding me of orange peel, but enough to make it beer and not something ghastly. The smell makes you think ""I'm getting into something dangerous."" The aftertaste says ""give me another bottle, and don't ruin this by eating anything."" This is the Owsley acid of beer. Don't ever be content with anything less unless you are cheap or poor."
"Overall, only Stone could make a beer like this. Epic in every possible way."
"D: Not something I could sit and session.. mostly because it makes you want to slow down and savor it all. I would have another but the 11th ale is calling me."
"Drinkability- Awesome beer. Can't wait for this beer to make it to Louisiana."
"Overall, I like it very much. I would drink it more often if it were lower in alcohol and if I could find some in smaller bottles."
"I loved this ale. Its like Stone Brewing advertises most people would not appreciate an ale of this quality and complexity. I fond this ale to be very satisfying in taste with a nice grapefruit flavor and a very nice citrus aroma. This is one of the ales that the dryness at the end really stands out and is appreciated. Pours a nice dark amber color with a nice semi thick head. This is one of the most amazing ales I have had in a long time. GREAT job Stone Brewing."
"It's a good thing that this is classified as a strong ale because this isn't for the weak-hearted! It also has decent drinkability for such a strong beer but may burn for some people on the way down."
"By the way, the warmer it got, the better it got. This beer really has it all..."
"i have had this in the bottle, offtap and in growler and it is always exceptional"
"Recommendations: If this does you good, give the Double Bastard a try!"
"This is one of the best beers out there in my opinion."
"I had, in fact, expected a lot more from this one."
"It really sucks that I had to go out of my way in Austin to pick up a bomber of this excellent brew. I had some the night before at the Gingerman downtown and just knew I had to get some more and take down notes. Maybe one day in a perfect beer world, more brews like this one will be available in North Carolina."
"Very drinkable, especially with the right meal, and just absolutely delicious."
"Deceivingly drinkable with the 7.20% abv that is MIA. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium. A classic and must try. One of the first beers to pique my interest in better beer and a great eye opening beer for the uninformed."
"Great, classic craft beer from one of the premier California craft breweries. Pours a dark caramel amber with a nice cream colored head with good lacing. The smell is bready, yeasty, caramelly, pineappley, and very hop tastic. The taste is roughly the same, with less fruitiness and more raw bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium and quite drinkable."
"Could drink several of these ABs"
"Poured into a pint glass from a bomber. The beer poured a dark brown, forming a creamy 1 1/2 inch head. Lots of thick lacing on the glass. The aroma is a strong balanced mix of hops and malts. Nothing really different, but still good. The taste is a good balanced mix of hops and sweet malt, with a hint of caramel in the middle, and a slight alcoholic finish. Medium mouthfeel. Overall, not a bad beer. I could definitely see drinking this again. Makes a good session ale IMO."
"I cant begin to explain how happy my mouth is right now. My palate is overflowing with citrus, caramel, some fruits. Has a nice dry bitter finish but it does not linger as long as would be expected. This beer is definitely worthy."
"It's easy to understand why this beer have so high ratings on this site. It is a very complex ale with dipa-characteristics. It is not an easy drink tho, one glass was more than enough :) A sipper for sure! Recommended!"
"M - Thick and oily. Mouthcoating and delicious. Very enjoyable on a cool night."
"This beer was recomended to me by a friend and I have to say, he was dead on with his tip. This beer is a great beer. It pours a dark brown color, with a 2 finger head. The bottle it comes in was bigger than the glass, so I had to drink some before emptying the bottle into the glass. I couldn't really pick up on a distinct smell, It just smelled to me like an english dark ale. The taste was a little bitter to start, but as I got about half way through it, it was a very clean and crisp taste. I would definatly drink this beer agian and recomend this to anyone who wants somthing new to try. I would just say, be careful when drinking this, it is a little higher by volume than most beers and can give you a nice festive feeling when you drink it."
"Ahh, the old classic bastard. I have had this beer many times and it was one of the first ""big"" beers I ever had.It is a dark ruby red color with a generous fluffy tan head. This is a good looking beer that borders between a n Amber and a Brown ale in color. The smell is hoppy and malty at the same time. The taste is like a battle between citrus hops and caramel tasting malt flavors. This is very good stuff fresh but if you get a bottle out of date you will not get the full experience on this one; the hops really fade. Too bad Stone can't produce this in six packs at a reasonable price."
"D: I love this stuff. Stone hits another home run with AB. Tasty, drinkable. The alcohol is a little strong for a session beer, but you can definitely throw a couple of these back."
"Poured a dark brownish-red with an amazing tan 2 finger head that lasted an impressive while. The scent of malt and citrusy hops are present. Initial taste reveals an explosion of different flavors: malt,sweet brown sugar, fruits,and piney finish. Amazing brew! Mouthfeel is smooth and inviting with a nice balance of carbonation. Drinkability is definately good also. 7.2 ABV is hidden well in this one, I'd definately drink a couple of these in a sitting, and many more in the future. Once again, Stone kicks ass with their brews and bottling!"
"Overall: I have been burned by marketing before, but this bottle is hilarious AND the beer is awesome. A great blend and balance of flavors. One of the reasons I wish Stone was available here in Minnesota. A delight to drink."
"Pours a ruby dark red with a nice off white head that sticks around and has lacing with a python grip. Mild smell of dried fruit, hops and some sweet malt. Hops show up much more than the smell would indicate. Fig and malt stick around nicely and are washed out by tasty hops. Feels full bodied with perfect carbonation in the mouth. Minimal alcohol feel and a bitter finish. Could make quite an evening out of this brew. A classic in my book."
"I got through about 10 oz. of the bottle and I started to feel a buzz.So the drink. comes down a bit for that.Other then that this beer is very awesome and I recommened anyong ""WORTHY"" to try it.Ive had the beer on tap and it is even better."
"One of the best."
"The dark amber ale poured quite nicely leaving a frothy head. This ale has a fruity scent to it. The hops dominates the malt in nose even though it doesn't when you actually consume the worthy beverage. The ale is sweet and fruity initially and then turns almost sour. The sour soon turns to the hops with a burnt and bitter taste. I found nothing unappealing with this variation of tastes. You mouth feels slightly bitter and dry when all said and done. The more you drink the better this tastebud rollercoaster becomes. I found that the initial tennis match back and forth the sweet and bitter ended well balanced by the bottom of the glass."
"D- the label was right, this beer is exceedingly complex. after 22 oz, my world has officially been rocked. could be the best ale i've ever had, but like an IPA, its intense and complex taste would not allow me to drink this all night long. i guess i just can't handle it."
"D - This is great! Very easy to drink, and still very complex. I will definitely keep this one on my wants list."
"Drinkability: So far, my reference beer for ""American Strong Ale"". I will try many to see if any one can knock the Arrogant Bastard off his pedestal. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
""
"Thats usually the case with Stone, but a great brewery. great beers! This one will not let you down."
"Now go F**k yourself...just kidding...you have to excuse me I just pounded a bomber and thats the Arrogant Bastard coming out of me."
"Poured an amazingly fine light-brown head that looked like it belonged on a Stout, and left strings of lace. Deep mahogany colored beer has a ruby glow when back lit. Aroma is bursting with pineapple along with candy sugar, alcohol, and rum. A half ton of citrus hop flavor rides a firm base of malty goodness. Finishes fairly bitter, but with lots of flavor to balance it out. The bitterness doesn't seem to disappear completely, and builds up over time. Innnnteresting. While the body is full the mouthfeel is soft and smooth making for a soothing drink. Boy do I miss this beer."
" Smells of raisins and hops. Deep, rich flavor. Alcohol more evident than expected in an under eight percenter. Almost like an abby ale with a hoppy kick. Very enjoyable, and you have to love the pure arrogance all over the bottle. Great job, Stone!"
"D: As warned on the label, this ale is definitely not for a novice beer drinker. Strong flavors abound, good drinkability though, a great beer from Stone, definitely shows what they're about."
"note: have had much more of this in the interim. both maltier and hoppier than previously noted, and more complex. a heavy hitting, big beer."
"D: Well I'll have to try a fresh bottle again to be sure, but I'll be damned if this old bottle of Arrogant Bastard isn't one of the top beers I've ever had. Complex and rich, with the age making it smooth and the body full and satisfying. Not a session beer, especially with the alcohol content, but certainly something I would never turn down."
"Appearance was very good. It poured to about a two fingered head. The head remained for quite a while. The lacing was very evident from the time it was poured until the time it was drank. It left a ring around the glass with every drink. The ale was kind of a reddish brown color, with the head being brownish white. I thought the taste was a bit stronger than most dark beers. It definately had a taste that had to be acquired. Mouthfeel was good with just the right amount of carbonation.After I finished my 22 oz bottle the high alcohol content was evident. It gave my a good head rush that was very enjoyable. If it wasnt for the high price I definately would enjoy this beer more often."
"Overall an excellent brew to appreciate, higher alcohol content and aggressiveness of the beer as a whole doesn't lend it to being a session beer. I can't see drinking several in an evening, but I can see enjoying one bottle at a time for several evenings to come."
"This ale was everything I expected. Definitely not a sessionable beer but one to enjoy at every opportunity."
"This is pretty drinkable for the style, but it's ultimately not the most memorable or inspiring ale."
"Notes: This bottle says it was best by April 30, 2007; I consumed it about 7 weeks beyond that, but I don't think that detracted from it at all. I recently drank a bottle from my cellar that had a best by date of September, 2005 that hadn't aged well; it had lost the hop bite just about completely. Younger, as this one was, it was a better balanced beer, smelled better and was more drinkable. I still liked it better on tap, but this is solid in a bottle too. Just don't let it get too old. . . ."
"Complexity and drinkability in the same package. Great offering from the craft beer world."
"D - Great in so many ways. The description on the bottle was hysterical. The taste is outstanding. I am very pleased with my first beer from Stone."
"Mostly easy drinking. Recommended."
"22oz bottle, no freshness date noted. Pours a clear medium brown with little carbonation but lots of head. Strong malty aroma with a good dose of hops on the nose as well. The flavour is less interesting than I was hoping for. Heavy on the malts and not as much hops as I thought there might be, although the hop taste does seem to grow as the beer goes on. I'm afraid I can't rate the Arrogant Bastard nearly as high as most people here - perhaps just not my type."
"Served in a pint glass from the tap. Appeared a wonderful dark amber color with a solid one finger head that remained throughout. Aroma of floral hops covered in caramel. The taste is where this flagship of the Stone lineup shines. Great fresh floral and citrus hop flavors combined with caramel, vanilla and slight dark chocolate. Can taste the beginnings of some flavor components that really come out in the oaked version. Very nice velvety feel with medium-heavy body. Good drinkability although it can get quite filling as this is a hefty brew. This is definitely one of my all-time favorites thanks to its bold flavor from both the hop and malt elements."
"a drinker, this one's for you. Impressive."
"D- A decent strong beer, too many though and you will pay for it."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass. This ale poured a darker brown with a thick, creamy light brown head that slowly faded. Heavy, heavy lacing. The beer smells like grapefruit and some roasted malts. The beer has a very aggressive bitterness that hits your tounge before you can discern any of the flavors. I tasted grapefruit, toast, pine, and some dark fruit notes. The mouthfeel is slighty resiny, medium-bodied, with a good amount of carbonation. Another high quality brew from Stone."
"Hops are in your face but with just enough malt character to make this a great beer."
"Notes: This one certainly a very nice brew two thumbs up to Stone brewing company for brewing this one. An interesting style quite the year round brew. Cheers"
"I give them high kudos for the name they gave this beer. It fits it in everyway. Damn, arrogant bastard!!!"
"Good carbonation, not to fizzy. Easy to drink, but a bit of a challenge with the ABV when coming out of a bomber."
"D- I think this is one of the most drinkable beers you can find. At least for those of us in the western half of America, the beer is very easy to find, affordable, and of the finest quality. I'd recommend this to anyone who is interested in American ales."
"D: God damn, I love this beer. It's overpowering, raw, in your face, all while being tasty and delicious. A completely unique American craft brew."
"This is one of my favorite beers. Has a high drinkability factor, mostly because it tastes so good. Deep color and full of complexity. It goes perfectly with a nice filet mignon. We started with this as our dinner beer, and it moved itself to our after dinner beer as well. Killer."
"The bomber poured an impressive ruby red liquid, capped with a dense, thick off white head. Great looking brew. Fine splotchy lacing. Smell is sweet malt, caramel, and pine. Toasty malt start and piny hop finish. Spicy alcohol is there as well. Crisp and oily in the mouth. Nice after taste. Chewy. Wish I had got another bomber."
"Impressive."
"Taste is of bitter, ascerbic hops with some coffee, roasted nut, and an alcoholic note to boot. Mouthfeel is definately not shy about its bitterness, as it attacks the back of the palate sans remorse. Some might consider it a bit overwheming in relation to the taste, but it's still enjoyable. Finishing remarks: Big aroma. Big taste. Big beer. Definately not to be taken lightly, but nonetheless an enjoyable drink."
"In the mouth it starts off big, but unfocused. Some dark ripe fruits are there like plum and raisin, but its vague, stale, old flavors are very dissapointing. Despite it being passed its prime (date), I imaginged a high alcohol would have preserved its flavor better (maybe the store's storage was poor). There is an okay hop bitter finish, but nothing to write home about. Mouthfeel couldn't make up for its flavor being syrupy ; it had a ""big"" body but it also finished thin and watery. Drinkability suffers for it just being so unfocused and boring, but I still wonder if it's just its age coming through?"
"Out of a painted-label bomber into a few glasses to split with my brothers, we have a hazy, orangy brown brew with a nice thick head. Looks appealing. The aroma wasn't too huge, mostly sweet and syrupy. Lots of punch upon tasting it, though - caramel, a little ripened berry, alcohol (but not much), and a very hoppy finish with a lingering aftertaste. Really nice in the mouth, all creamy and smooth, well carbonated. A serious beer, but quite consumable."
"This is a great ale i would drink over and over"
"Comes out of the bottle a dark hazy brown. Has a very good malt colored head with average retention. Smell is hoppy and malty at the same time. The first thing I taste is lots of malt followed by lots of hop. A very hop bitter beer. I think it needs something else. I like Stone IPA much better. (Why does only California know that cadmium can cause birth defects)."
"Had this last night on tap at Toronado where they were featuring Stone beers. At first look it was a deep Amber but holding up to the light you see it is a brilliant red. Not much head and lacing. Very aromatic hops which led me to believe that the hops would overpower in the taste. However, this was not so. Definitely hop forward but with refinement. Other brewers should take note. Good balance in the mouthfeel - refreshing yet substance. As I've stated before, I'm not much of a hop ale drinker but I did enjoy this."
"D-very good I could have several of these"
"D- This beer is very drinkable as it has for probably most of the people who have tasted it. Not a beer that I want to drink all night, but would not mind spliting a couple of bomber of this with a friend next time."
"Strong, malty and definitely not like anything I've had from around this area. I can easily see why beers from the Stone Brewing Company are held in such high regard. I especially like the aftertaste it leaves. Very good!"
"D- Because of the balance, the drinkability is pretty good, but because of how strong it is... you must be a glutton for intensity to have more than one bomber."
"Pours a deep mahogany red with a soapy tan head. Smells malty, caramel, with some piney hops. There's a lot going on in this brew, hops are everywhere, the malt is a good backing. Dark fruits, piney hops, toasty caramel hops, and a bit of warming alcohol. Delicious, it all balances out and, although coming up as an in your face brew, tastes great. Syrupy, light carbonation. I wish this was available here, thanks to OstrungT for the trade"
"Taste: quite light I was surprised actually since most Stone's product I had my hands on, were quite rich and extreme beers. Full, complex, at first the hops come in to tickle your palate followed by a sweet caramel and chocolate flavours of the malt."
"Arrogant bastard pours a clear deep red with a nice thick head. Taste is bitter upfront, and lastingly bitter. The hops are citrusy, piney and herbal. Behind the huge hops hides a delicious malt character, sweet dark fruits mixed with tropical fruits. This is one great beer, brutal and offensive, but in a good way. I know some may consider it not respecting beer, but I like this one out of the bottle as well as in the glass, I find I taste the delicious maltiness more."
"I've heard a lot about this beer, so I was excited to try it. I eventually drank the whole 22 oz by myself. Pours a delicious reddish-brown, nice and clear, with a thin, off-white head. Very good retention, some lacing on the pint glass. Smells and tastes of toasted malts, caramel, toffee, nuts. I thought this was a strong, chewy Brown Ale at first. Good balance with some mild hops. A bit of warming alcohol. Excellent mouthfeel for the decently thick flavors - I think this was spot-on; I've had far too many watered-down ""Strong"" Ales. Overall, an exceptional beer. Great body, wonderful balance of flavors, all the elements work together to make this a highly drinkable beer. I can see why so many people consider this a standard in the American craft beer repertoire."
"First sip...Holy Fuck!!! This beer is worth writing home to my mother about. Arrogant Bastard has it all. Delicious malts, like caramel and honey. Delicious hops like grapefruit and earth. This thing is a beast, but not an evil arrogant beast. More in the vain of...I taste delicate and complex and I WILL MAKE YOU PLAY WU TANG on the jukebox and make an ass out of yourself. This beer jams, you should drink it!"
"Smooth mouthfeel with perfect carbonation. One of my all time favorites. Complex and drinkable."
"A bit too high in alcohol and too harsh on the front end to be very drinkable."
"There is a lot of hype behind this beer, and to some people that is a bad thing. It is definitely a good brew. I have had other beers that don't live up to the hype. I think this one does. Plus it is a great value at 3.99$ a bomber (thank you Grapevine Market), especially with the 7.2 ABV. Try it if you haven't. I am definitely going to have another..."
"D- This beer will mess you up. If you are in the mood for something big, this will quench your thirst. If you are not in the mood for a monster, wait for another day though."
"A bit on the heavy side but not incredibly hard to drink. This is a good beer but a bit to strong for my personal tastes. I could not have more than one in quite some time."
"Anyway, recommended"
"Overall, a very drinkable beer. Good session beer....even with the high ABV. I was really very, very surprised [in a good way]. Definitely want some more of this one."
"This beer is above average overall-but a little bit over hyped. There are hoppier, more complex, not for the ""faint of heart"" brews out there. This just didn't live up to my expectations. I will probably have it again. I do not hate it nor am I in love with it."
"Poured into my specialty arrogant bastard glass, pours an amazing amber rustic color with a fluffy head that leaves heavy lace on the glass and stays the entire time, little carbonation bubbles float through this wonder looking ale. Smell is a bit citrusy hoppy smelling also has a bit of an earthy smell to it as well. Taste is a well balanced masterpiece of a bit of hop bitterness followed by bark, with a bit of a roasted malt and barley aftertaste, also a bit of grapefruit bitterness towards the end. Simply put this is one fine damn ale and one of the greatest brews around, top notch."
"Drinkability: I understand why I give it the score I gave it, it just goes to show that palates change from time to time."
"It's not my favorite of Stone's products, as this Bastard will come right after you. This is a beer that gets better the more samples you have of it (the original overall score was 3.85)."
"The beer poured a rich deep amber almost brown with a frothy head that slowly diminished but not completely and left great lacing on the glass. The aroma was of pine hops and burnt caramel. The taste is very well balanced between caramel and some brown malts along with earthy pine hops. They balance so well that both seem to dominate. The beer is medium bodied and although a little alcohol shows, it's not at all overbearing. This is one of my absolute favorite beers."
"Probably should be a sipper...but one can feel the beer making fun of your (lack of) manhood and you find yourself unable to stop drinking this awesome beer."
"Pouring out of a tall bottle, the appearance of the beer was a deep red colour. The smell was sweet; a combination of hops and malts with a touch of fruitiness. The taste is possible the best. It has an instant smoky taste, but it quickly settles into the palate with a smooth finish. Not quite fizzy but soft in the mouth. As for the drinkability, one bottle would be sufficient to enjoy. In an odd way, it complemented the sushi I had earlier in the meal. I really enjoyed this brew from Stone."
"Drinkability - Bitter start, but you get used to it quickly. Light body, tasted it with food and the bitterness softened and only then did the rest of the beer's flavors seem to strengthen."
"Overall this is a great beer. Definitely not an everyday beer but one I will definitely come back to in the future. It is good for special occasions and last night it did a great job at taking the edge off of an especially long stess-filled day at work."
"D: Not an everyday brew, but a great example of a STRONG American Ale. Everyone should try this, at least once!"
"Cheers!"
"D: not too high in alcohol, but not a session beer either. I think this is one of those beers you get a hankering for and really enjoy, but probably isnt the type of beer youd want a sixer of. Very fun, tasty and enjoyable beer * note: as it warms it becomes more smooth"
"- Bomber pour, cellar temperature, into a pint glass -"
"Pours the color of cherry wood -- dark with some streaks of ruby. Big yellow-cream head that eventually fades to a collar. As expected, huge hops aroma with just a touch of malt foundation. The hops are heavy on the metals, relatively light on the citrus, but American all the way. On the palate, smooth pale malts hit the tongue first off, but the flavors move toward the back of the tongue very quickly, displaying lots of hop oils and citrus notes. Metals are toned down from the aroma. Very strong, oily bitterness is the key theme here -- from the mid-palate through the finish, my mouth is coated with hop oils. It's rough, tough, and definitely not subtle. Overall, this is the quintessential American strong ale -- big alcohol, very hoppy, not too balanced with malts. Not really my style, but good for what it is."
"Comments/D: A strong in your face aggressive beer. Leans a little heavily on the hop side for me. Drinkability is good. Certainly worth getting more."
"22oz. bottle poured a dark amber color with a decent tan head that sticks to the glass. The smell has some citrus and sweet malt notes. Taste is mostly a grapefruit rind with lots of bitterness. The feel seems medium bodied and has a stickiness to it. This brew is very tasty and easy to drink and one of my regular go to brews if I'm out of the Double or Oaked versions."
"Aroma is very strong, even from a distance. Caramel or chocolate malts backing up a huge pine and grapefruit hop assault. Taste is excellently balanced, with good bready malt flavours and powerful earthy hops. Excellent mouthfeel, and a sour citrusy aftertaste. Well done, of course, and a great drinkable hoppy beer that doesn't waste the taste buds."
"Thick yet also thirst-quenching. A strong, ""wet ale."" Creamy and good. So drinkable for such a strong ale. Oaky, alcohol-y, strong, rich."
"""You're Not Worthy"""
"Poured a decent sized head that reduced leaving thick sticky beige lacing. The head also reduced to a very thick chunky off-white layer of foam. The color is a reddish-brown.Each sip left a ring of lace that circled my glass. The appearance is good, but not worthy to be considered in the 4.5/5 range.Very aromatic hop filled nose coupled with a strong fruit smell. Bitterness overshadows most of the tastes present. Would like to see more carbonation in the mouthfeel. It is finished being somewhat flat. Alcohol is hidden making it go down smoother than it should being such a full-bodied ale. Strong phenolic notes noted on the finish. Long lingering bitterness on the aftertaste. It is not really balanced in the taste and mouthfeel areas. Overall a great brew and worth a repeated buy. My two reviews of this beer are different because my knowledge of beer and reviewing have changed since my last review of 3 years ago."
"I had heard about this beer from a friend and decided to try it. I heard it was bitter and it lives up to the hype. I thought after a couple of swigs I would get used to the bitterness but I didnt. I will try this beer again when my sophistication changes heh heh."
"I found out a local bar had this, so I had to try some. I love the fact that it says right on the bottle, ""you won't like this beer"" because all of my friends who are regulars of the American Macros, definitely don't have the palate for such a beer. The beer pours a cloudy brownish-red color with a yellow colored, creamy head. The smell is of piney-citrus hops, very present. There is an initial sweetness, followed by a hop-bomb similar to the nose that lingers on the palate for hours after the beer is finished. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. A drinkable beer, the hop presence could easily be too much for most, but if you are a hop head, you should definitely try this beer."
"After that first taste of Arrogant Bastard three years ago, I had to look it up online. A quick Google search led me to my first ever visit to beeradvocate.com. I have a lot to owe to AB and rightfully so. It's a great beer."
"22 oz bottle into a pilsner glass. Pours a deep reddish-amber, nice finger of head. Looks pretty tasty. Nose is incredibly strong, lots of hops and even the malty, fruity sweetness comes through. Definitely not your average IPA (although it doesn't look as though they even classify it as such). Taste is incredible. Amazing balance of hoppy bitterness and complex malt flavors, caramel and raisins, and about a thousand other things. Really an amazing taste. Feel is fairly heavy (I needed something lighter after to ease up on the pallet a little) and full-bodied. Good carbonation. Overall, a really delicious beer. The first time I had this one it was too much for me, I couldn't handle it (just like the bottle says). But after having a couple more this one really comes through as original and quite delicious. Only the fairly high alcohol content might limit it."
"Drinkability - I could make this sessionable."
"This Bastard really does seems to live up to its reputation. Much better than the Levitation. I am excited to try the Double and Oaked Bastards in my fridge."
"Recommeded."
"Highly recommended beer! There is so much going on in this beer that it is better experienced than explained. I keep a spare in the fridge to share with any misguided friends that wonder in with inferior beer in their arms. At least for once they get to experience what a real beer is all about."
"Enjoy it if you get the chance! Cheers"
"I've had this beer many times before but this is the first time I've reviewed it. This Bastard never fails to please."
"Drinkability: High!"
"EOV"
"For me, and many others, Arrogant Bastard pretty much defines the concept of the Big Beer This is an experience anyone who likes beer should have. Definitely one of my favorite ales, and one of the top overall, as far as I'm concerned. There's a lot of hype around this ale, but there's a reason for it."
"Bottom line: A fantastic brew that will earn your attention whether you wish to or not. Highly recommended!"
"Glad I finally got around to reviewing this. It is truly wonderful."
"This beer pours a nice brown color with a tan head - not much carbonation on the pour. The smell is a pleasant fruity smell. This beer is very well balanced and is just a great beer that I could drink over and over again. Great mouthfeel, excellent taste with a fruity aftertaste."
"Good beer, but I would like to try it closer to it's source."
"Poured a reddish brown with nice head retention- great fresh hop aromas cascade off the pint glass- cirtusy piney- nice. Flavors are all over the place; a somewhat spicy, fruity, alcoholic malt, with an oatmeal thickness and slight sweet character atttempts to fend off the assertive hops- no way. The finish is a sticky hop bomb with some malt along for the ride. Very nice, wish there was some on tap right now...."
"Pours a near perfect ruby brown color with minimal carbonation.The smell is deep and rich, but not at all overpowering. The taste is a surprising combination of depth of flavor, smoothness, and pure potency. The hops and the malt stand alone on their own merits, but are delivered in a perfect balance. The mouthfeel is unusually light for beer of this nature, but not at all disappointing. As one of the best beers I have ever tasted, the drinkability is good to say the least."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- A ""wimpy"" texture is all we get here after all this haughtiness? Surprisingly, most of the carbonation of this beer is released and spent in the enormous, magnificent head. Thin on its way in the mouth, it never develops an interesting enough body to showcase the massive character... but since the flavor holds its own, it's not a dealbreaker. With a smile, I gulp and belch the rest of this ale down, realizing that one of these is enough... but damn I'm enjoying this tasting."
"D: This brew would get an good rating for drinkability from me if it weren't for the excessive sweetness at the end. In my opinion, the sweet finish just sticks around too long, and I found myself wanting a glass of water by the time I finished the pint. I know it seems kind of strange to have such a large gap between dinkability and flavor, but this brew is defenitely not meant to be a session beer. That said, the complexity of this beer is defenitely something that should not be ignored. Also, watch out for the kick of this brew, as the ABV is nothing to sneeze at."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This is a great beer. It's got a nice, sweet taste to it and evolves into a rush of bitterness. This really is one of my favorite beers. Definitely a regular in my fridge. But, one bomber is enough for me. No more than that. Overall, I highly recommend it. Truly a classic. Sure to bring out the arrogance in all of us."
"This beer is godawful. I have no idea why it got such high reviews. I couldn't even finish the stuff, as my taste buds had decided to mutiny."
"22 oz Bottle. This one poured dark amber with nice fat tan head that left great lacing. Strong hops and malts greet your nose and the richness takes over your mouth in a hurry. Flavor is sublime. Hops are agressive, yet still under control This is everything a craft beer should be. Yum, yum, yum. Love this one."
"This was my first taste of a cask-conditioned ale and I wasn't sure what to expect. What I got was not what I thought I would. If nice clear deep amber color and rich head had me excited. The smell was very heavy on hops, which a rep from Stone told me were Centennial hops. He then told me about how the dry hopping process worked before I took my first sip. The malt I expected from the Bastard wasn't as apparent as I thought it would be, however, despite the hoppiness it was a very smooth drink. I anxiously await my next chance to try a cask ale and hope I enjoy it just as much."
"Drinkability - I am not worthy, but fortunately they still let me buy a bottle and taste this fantastic brew. I wouldn't want this at a summer picnic after a day in the sun, but fortunately for me it is February. This is highly drinkable and enjoyable as there is nothing about the complex profile that isn't incredibly enjoyable."
"Tastes much better than standard Arrogant. Smooth and drinkable, but still the hop bomb that the Bastard is known for. Worth some hype by any means, but the Smoked Porter and Old Guardian '06 were easier drinkers."
"Pours a mahogany color, but probably a bit lighter that the original. Thick creamy, nearly white head, with excellent retention and lacing. Seems very standard for a solid cask beer. Big hoppy aroma. Centennial hops seem to be the showcase, as floral and citrus notes are present. Toffee, caramel, and a bit of fig are somewhat hidden behind a great amount of floral, citrusy, and piney hops. The creamy feel and low, soft carbonation make this treat oh so drinkable. Thank you Stone for bringing this to Boston's as part of the Most Arrogant Pub celebration. A real treat to have a cask beer like this."
"This beer being cask makes it just too drinkable."
"Drinkability: This is one of those occasional treat beers or maybe just when your feeling extra arrogant!"
"For all its heavy dutiness it is actually quite drinkable (though I wouldn't want to drink it all the time). At 7.2% it is strong enough to provide a nice buzz with just one 22 oz. bottle, so you don't need to drink as much of this as of other beers. For me this is the perfect hybrid between a session beer and a sipping beer."
"Drinkability: As the label (hilariously) advises, this is not a beer for everyone. If youre in the mood for a serious American ale, though (as I was tonight), you could drink these all night. At 7.2%, that would of course be a somewhat dangerous proposition."
"wow....this is good stuff. Pours with a huge well-retaining head..hue is dark brown and the nose is a strange combination of chocolate,banana, hops, and lemon. This head is going nowhere! Taste is very good....bitter hops up front give way to some glorious malts with a nice roastedness and a re-appearance from the banana. Mouthfeel is excellent and the finish is earthy and it makes my mouth water like quench chewing gum. The alcohol is pleasantly subdued for the abv%. This is seriously growing on me...even though the alcohol isn't overpowering it still gives you a little chest warmth. The aftertaste is caramel-like with a load of grassy bitter hops. Ok the head is still 70%after five minutes...impressive...I appreciate their arrogance....this is first rate....would like to try the 'oaked' version."
"Served slightly chilled in a pint glass. Poured a beautiful reddish-copper color with about one finger of bubbly white head. Head slowly dissipated into a thick swirl of lace in the center of the glass. Smelled of strong bittering hops, Dark dried fruits, and faint notes of alcohol. Tasted pretty hoppy, somewhat malty with moderate carbonation and plenty of smooth alcohol in the finish. Was a great well balanced ale that gets high marks for leaving me wanting more.."
"Beer poured a nice dark red, almost black. Carbonation appropriate, with mild head. Smell very hoppy and floral, with some nice spice. Taste was hop, hop, and hop. Very nice, great bitter finish. Nice strong mouthfeel, good consistency. Very drinkable, very good, very recommended."
"For the uninitiated, the ""You're not worthy"" moniker may apply (as it may take a slightly more refined palate to appreciate this one), but for those looking for a hoppy ""bastard"" of a brew you should look no further!"
"*as a side note, i've been drinking this beer a lot recently, and still love it just as much or more than when i originally wrote the review. i managed to try some on tap last night and was absolutely floored... the head was remarkable."
"Was a little harsh for me the first couple times. But after that, I see the hype. Beautiful looking beer, as most of Stone's are. Nice head, thick lacing down the glass. Bloody red color with some banana, maybe plum and high hops on the kickback. Almost like a souped up IPA. Lots of banana on the smell, and many malts. A bit harsh on the go down, but an excellent beer nonetheless."
"This is a brew that isnt afraid of hops, and knows how to use them. Its not over-the-top; its strong and balanced nicely. Arrogant Bastard gets a good deal of publicity as some superbeer. It is undeniably good, much better than your average available, but it is nothing to obsess over. Also, I like the arrogant bottle."
"Poured out of the 22oz bomber. The color was an auburn brown color that was clear, had a pillowy tan head that left fantastic lacing. The smell was weaker than expected but still had a good wiff of buddy hops. The taste is what makes this brew unique. It has qualities of a porter and an AIPA. The taste is of floral hops, roasted malts, strong. The ale has a nice creamy, moderate mouthfeel, that finishes a bit dry."
"Drinkability- Very tasty beer that deserves the recognition it's received. Can't wait to go poor the rest of that 22oz's and really enjoy that 7.2% ABV!"
"D - A very heavy ale that packs a good punch. I'm now left with about 9 oz left of a 22 oz bottle and I feel pretty happy. Good thing this is expensive, otherwise you'd be in a world of hurt the next morning."
"Not too shabby. So well made. I sat down on a winter night after working a swing shift and enjoyed the heck out of it. Got a little loopy, too. If only I didn't have to get it mail order."
"Poured out of a 22 oz bomber into a wide mouthed wine glass. Pours an amber brown color. I didn't get too much on the nose. At first taste all I got was the flavor of hops, but after it warmed up the hoppiness dissipated and it showed a malty, nutty flavor that was complemented by hop bitterness. The flavor makes me long for almond crusted walleye to complement it."
"Overall it is a fine example of the style. I could not have more than one in a sitting that is for sure. It is complex in many ways and is a must have for American Strong Ale lovers. I am more of an Imperial Stout man myself, but can definitely appreciate what this brew has to offer."
"This is a great brew worth giving a try. To avoid the aftertaste.... ...keep drinking!!!"
"This feels very syrupy and smooth, with a moderate amount of CO2. There is a slight oilyness from the hops and a warm follow through after each sip."
"Sometime hard to find but a exceptional beer form the first mouth full one is forced to say ""Holy molly that's good beer"". I would love to try this beer on tap I think you lose a bit of taste in a bottle. The Bottle is good try this beer!!!!"
"as of this review, there are 1040 reviews applied. I got one of these via trade!!! Not sure the age but I think it's around a year or so in the bottle. Tasty, a bit reserved in the hops flavor and aroma compared to a fresh version. I liked it better with some age on it. I could imagine it cellaring a year or two longer and seeing how it comes out. While not in my market, I can see why people like this brew. For today I'll leave the expansive descriptions to the other 1040 people."
"Poured from a 1 pt 6 fluid oz bottle into a glass. Love the bottle which is worth the read for the entertainment. Wonderful ruby brown color with a sturdy tan head that left an appealing lace in my glass. Smell was very complex  there is a lot going on here. Hops are all over the place as well as the roasted grains the fruit esters. Very enjoyable. Complex flavor that I found to be more enjoyable as the beer warmed a bit. This beer is hard to find in my area, but it was worth all the effort. I enjoyed this beer very much and would gladly purchase more."
"Now if only they would export this from USA to CAN."
"Only the slight heaviness keeps this beer from being more drinkable. Otherwise, it's the most flavorful beer I've enjoyed to date."
"Not really that drinkable, due to the overly carbonated profile and unbalanced profile... Just like the bottle says, I probably won't like it... well, I'll give it a ""why the hell not."""
"D - Alright. If you love bittering hops, then this is for you. I think it could use a bit more depth in flavor to be a truly great beer, but a great delivery of what I believe the brewer is intending this to be."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Beer poured a very nice amber mahogany shade. Nice thick one finger head that stayed more or less towards the end of the drink. Lacing was decent. Mouthfeel, to me, was pretty good but a bit bitter. I like bitter, but it lingered a bit longer than I would have liked. Other than that, taste was awesome. Nice and malty, with enough hops to balance it out. I would recommend this to any fan of nice dark ales."
"Waited quite a while to try this beer. Have to come right out and say that its a damn tasty brew and I wish I could have more already! This beer has a deep amber color with decent head that fades quite a bit, but has a slight amount of retention. Smell is dominated by hops, but doesn't over power it. I think they are amarillos, but not sure. Taste is wonderful, a close perfect balance between malt and hops...one doesn't over power the other. Mouthfeel and drinkability are very high. I could confidently say that I would drink one of these everyday if given the chance! Stone PLEASE distribute to Iowa!"
"I've heard a lot about this beer. Pours amber nice head with good retention, and lacing. Smell is not as strong as expected. Sweet citrus, and hops mostly. Body is thick with some carbionation. Taste is a good combionation, of sweet dark fruits, and nice earthy hops. Very good."
"The head is thick and frothy, very nice...it stayed even until the last drink. The color is dark brown with an amber hue to it. The smell is slightly roasty, slightly sweet and a little musky. The taste is very hoppy/musky and powerful. It tastes a bit old. The mouthfeel is a little lacking, it's a bit harsh. Overall I will try this one again, but it's not my session beer."
"A very pretty dark red-brown color with a thick off-white head. It had a sweet, citrusy aroma, as well as some malt. The taste was similar to the aroma. Citrus, and a good lingering bitterness. Maybe the bitterness stayed a little too long, but that's a minor quibble. This was a good beer to drink, very enjoyable."
"This is a nice drinkable strong ale. No too strong to down a couple but don't let them creep up on you!"
"Poured thick, almost syrupy. No head to speak of. Color is a murky reddish-brown, slightly clearer at the edges of the glass. Smell is somewhat dull, definite scent of hops, a hint of spiciness. Taste is a shockingly strong orange at first, with aspects of pear and pomegranate, giving way to a spicy hop taste and mellowing out to almost a smooth creaminess. Not a real cream taste, more like a cream soda. Mouthfeel is slightly oily, very heavy. Drinkability is ok, the only real problem is the oily mouthfeel, though I could see this being a positive to some people. Overall, while I'm not sure I'd run out and buy more, if offered I would jump at the chance to drink this beer again."
"But back to the topic, Stone did a really good job making this a very complex beer, but keeping it drinkable. Kudos."
"I thought I was sophisticated enough to enjoy a brew like this. But I tried a bomber of this while vacatining out in Arizona (since I cannot recieve this in IL yet.) and I can't really say I like it. Too much going on , caramel, fruit, overload...I'd rather have an Eye of the Hawk by Mendocino."
"Pours a ruddy dark amber with a small head. hazy. The smell is of grapefruit and spicy hops. Tastes spicy, grapefruity, and piney from all the hops. Long finish, amore grapefruit at the end. A little raw tasting, with a little bit lack of integration. The mouthfeel is alittle overcarbonated and a little thin. Not creamy. A pretty big beer and nice and brawny, but a little superficial and harsh."
"D - could drink this all day, one of my favorites"
"Drinkability is good, abv is not even too terribly high. Only downside would be that if you werent planning on Arrogant Bastard all night, you'd have to have one hell of a beer to follow this one with. I believe this would overpower most others."
"The taste is an excellently balanced, sweet malt with just enough rounded bitterness. I taste caramel malts with mellow smooth bitterness beets, citrus and sweetness. My only critiques I might wish it was a tiny bit more carbinated. This is definitely one of my favorite American strong ales. I'd totally buy this again especially during the summer."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle. Dark amber color almost a dark ruby when back lit. Fluffy off-white cream colored head creating a mild lace down the glass. The head dissipated after a while. Smells of a nice malt sweetness. Mild tones of caramel and a light hop scent. Hints of a citrus scent hidden in the back ground. Nice nose with a very pleasant and distinct aroma. The taste was of a nice well rounded malt flavor up front. Roasted nutty malt flavors followed by a light sweetness on the tongue. Mild hop bitterness rounds out the well balanced flavor in the back of the mouth. This is a great full bodied brew. Great rolling flavor from start to finish. Very smooth and drinkable. Again another well crafted and tasty brew from Stone. I am glad to see that there beers make it to the other side of the US."
"I wish Stone beers were available in Missouri. I would have this one hand all the time."
"Appearance- deep red colour with a creamy white head. Smell is more sweet than hoppy which surprised me. Taste is a very balanced to me- the malts and hops are in synchronicity. I was expecting more of a hop blast- it may be that I have held on to this bottle too long and the hops has subsidided. No matter- still a classic west coast beverage. Or it the lack of hops could be due to my mouth being hammered into a submission by a Surly Furious a couple of hours earlier. Mouthfeel is rich with a medium to low carbonation. The head dissapated quite quickly in my pint glass. Overall- it would be a staple for me if I could just access it on a regular basis."
"I love this beer as a strong ale. A rich translucent brown in color, with a tan head, the smell that initially hits your nose is fresh floral hops and citrus aromatics. The taste is a caramel maltiness up front with a long lasting intense bitterness at the end. Fresh wet hops are present throughout. As it warms, caramel is much more apparent in the aroma, and the lingering bitterness is much less than I remember the very first time I had it. This might be a beer that some people have to get use to for a while."
"This beer really started my love of good beer. I first tried this because of it's catchy name when at a bar in college. I have always been and will always be infatuated with the color of this beer. The head takes on a slight amber shade and the beer itself is such a unique bright amber color, that really is eye catching. The taste is amazing. Plenty of hops and a remarkable complexity."
"Pours a dark, reddish brown with a two fingered tan head. Belgian lace forms on the glass as the head falls. Sweet pineapple aroma. Solid wollop of hop bitterness up front with some alcohol and tingling CO2 and dry bitterness in the finish. Some dry grass, barley taste in the background. Medium mouthfeel and very drinkable. Does not do an adquate job of showing a spectrum of hop taste, just bitterness. Many other IIPAs I would prefer."
"This is a strong solid ale that is strong. Dark copper reddish poir with a tan head with mild retention. It has some citrus esters as well as a nice sweetness, coupled with good hoppiness. The taste is strong, robust and citrusy, with malt sweetness. A bit heavy mouthfeel, and adequately carbonated. Good drinkability, though it can sneak up on you!"
"Sorry, but I can't give this beer a better rating than this, I suppose I'm just not ""worthy"". Flame away, but, really it's a lame beer with a great marketing strategy. At least it's a well made lame beer."
"Moderate mouth that has weight with enough carbonation to keep it lively. Very drinkable for such a hop bomb."
"1/19 - Just had it on tap yesterday at The Yard House in Scottsdale. Wow, this beer is incredible. One of the strongest yet most drinkable beers I've ever had. I needed to edit this because the taste is crazy grapefruits. As soon as it hits your tongue, all the way until you move on to the next beer, it's all grapefruit. I love it."
"Has a great appearance. Pours almost reddish amber. Drank from a pint glass. Goes down smooth and leaves a pleasent aftertaste in your mouth. Be careful though, this smooth drink does pack quite the punch. I went through four glasses of these very quickly."
"Another great beer from Stone. Hopefully the rumor that they'll be distributing in Wisconsin in 2007 is true so I can have these more often. Good stuff!"
"It's a very good offering on draft, however I think I could only drink a two pints of this at most. Would tire of the taste after that. Would highly recommend, a little more ""relaxed"" than served from the bottle."
"This is one beer that will definitely throw off your senses; the first thing I smelled was a semi-strong sweet fruity fragrance that resembled some sort of exotic fruit basket. It pours out with a nice thick, light tan head that is a good contrast to dark amber red body of the ale- its almost like the picture perfect ale. However, it's mouth feel is creamy and is a bit rough around the edges, but its not harsh, and its has a great malty flavor."
"22oz. Bomber. This one pours a bit ""Thick"". There was a bit of an off white head. The beer is a bit clear, and a reddish amber color. Extremely malty with a nice hop afterbite. Unique taste. There is a bit of fruitiness in there. It is very potent. This is one my wife will definitely NOT like. I am Worthy!"
"Seems like one of those beers that keeps growing on you. Wish I had another bottle. A must try beer,although it seems like everybody has already tried this one."
"The beer was a nice ruby red with tan head and lacing. Strong aroma of grapefruit and sweet caramelized malts. Taste is a little different than I remembered. I've got strong pineapple and citrus hops, the pineapple surprised me. Overall a great, bold flavor than is still fairly drinkable."
"Poured a deep brown with a nice creamy head and thick lace throughout. Smell has a definate nuttiness as well as some hops, smells very thick. Taste is caramel and nutty as I expected from the smell, but has a nice dry hopped back. Very nice and smooth, leaves you wanting more. This is a definate keeper and a good way to welcome myself back home from vacation!"
"Cheers!"
"High ABV, have a bomber and then stop."
"If you have not tried this one, try it. If people have been telling you you would like this one, you will. I felt like it was going to be a hoaxy beer because of the name (and the price which was nearly 3 dollars for the bottle at CVS), but this is a legit beer. Try it."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" dark tan head over the clear burgundy red brew. Hearty holds on well, with ample lacing. Aroma is dominantly hoppy, with citrus and pine powering the experience. Taste starts a bit lacking in my mind, not as richly malty as I would expect. But never fear, the hops kick in a take over, with bursts of bitterness that impress, without making you cringe from overdoiung it. Mouthfeel is smooth for such a hoppy offering, and drinkability is dangerously good. Had this many times, just never got around to reviewing, reminds me why I keep coming back."
"hops "" shake "" if you will. this is another killer way to experience the massive hop profile of this brew."
"Great."
"A hearty, rich, full-bodied ale, with balance and power. Will happily drink again."
"This beer poured a deep brown color with a thick creamy head that lasted quite a while. The smell is sweet and inviting. The taste is very malty with a noticeable hop finishbalanced superbly. The mouthfeel is full and leaves a nice coating on the tongue that serves as a reminder of this delicious concoction. This is a very drinkable beer that is heavy enough to know you are having a real beer, but not too filling to keep it from being drunk at a proper pace."
"Pours a dark copper color and is semi-cloudy. Head is about a half an inch but settles down to a lace. Aroma is very fruity and sweet almost like candy. Goes down smooth tasting like grapefruit and is very bitter. It is pretty well carbonated also. I've got mixed feelings about this one. It says it's a strong ale, but could almost be passed off as a double IPA. I kinda like the fruity taste, but seems pretty bitter for a strong ale. This is the second Stone brew I've had and wasn't impressed with the first. It seems to be getting better after the first few sips. Maybe I'll have to review this again sometime."
"Drinkability varies based on tastes. Stone claims to have a brew that isn't for everybody with this one. And they are right; but that's why I like this beer. Couldn't have more than a couple of these and prefer food with this one. Will have another when I crave it."
"The drinkability is good, could be a little better. But really a very good brew. prosit, MK"
"Overall, the nose is spellbinding, the appearance good. The balance of hops to malt seems such to enliven the hops, but to not let it get overly out of character. Perfect in that sense. The finish is rich with flavors, but I would have liked to see a bit more complexity on the foretaste though. Excellent overall."
"Drinkability: I could drink this, and only this, for the rest of my life and be a completely happy and content man. I don't think I can say that for any other beer on the planet. In other words the drinkability is like everything else about this beer, perfect."
"Double Bastard is way better. A lot of this guy is hype."
"Enjoyed this a lot. WIll have to update when I can really take some good notes...Double Bastard is next.."
"Overall an excellent ale. Worthy of all the hype. Potent and drinkable."
"Poured out a dark amber bodym slightly red, clear and clean. Off white head is big, thick and creamy looking, and lasts a long time. The nose starts with citrus hops with some light sweet malt thrown in. The taste is first sweet, fruity malt blend nicely with a light, sweet, malt backbone, then some snappy hop bitterness.Nice and clean and refreshing. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Drinks clean and refreshing."
"Note: upon further review I realized the fruit. Definetely grapefruit. And the more I drink this beer the more I like it. It's a taste explosion!"
"At 7.2% ABV, the alcohol was hardly detectable. Although the hops may be a bit hard for some to handle, this beer deserves praise for coupling malts and hops in such a unique manner."
"What a great beer! Too bad you can't get it in Illinois. My friend Jay says I'm a wussy because I don't drink a lot of good beer because I'm allergic to it. But Stone's Arrogant Bastard is a notable exception. It has a crisp taste that goes down very smooth, with a complex flavor not unlike my last three girlfriends. The flavor and the color can vary sometimes, also like my girlfriends."
"Bottom line: Very solid beer, a lot of depth, and quite well balanced. It has some aggressive hop moments, but it always manages to bring them back into balance before they get entirely out of control. An impressive effort."
"The drinkability is average. I see no reason to drink this when there are beers that are much less offensive that have a true style to them. By far the worst Stone beer that gets the most press and praise. The strong ale catch all is just not a solid situation. I prefer structure. This is a bit messy for me. If this thing were about 14% abv, I think I would be more appreciative of it because I could forgive some of the harsh abrasiveness. As it stands it tastes like a monster only it is not really that strong considering. This beer has a great name. I wish it deserved to be so arrogant though. I think some people have been punked out by the smack talk on the bottle. Nice Jedi mind tricks. Stone's other products are much more deserving of the praise. They make some truly stellar beers. That being said, I am not feeling this one and I will not pretend to be."
"Slainte!"
"just an absolutely fantastic beer. the high gravity makes it something I'd drink occasionally, but man does it taste great."
"Wow! The sweetness of this beer is very nice. I can taste some pineapple/grapefruit and some nice malt flavors coming throught. The finish is dry with some of those great west coast hops really shining through. This beer sure has a lot going on! I think this might be one of the best beers that I have tried."
"Pours a soft yet thick head with good retention. The slight beige color compliments the almost dried blood color of the beer itself. The beer is such a deep garnet, that I had too hold the glass up to the light to see the bubbles. Plenty of strong hop and rye flavors hit me nostrils immediately. The flavor reflects the smell very well. I would say this was an IPA, but the caramel malts and other un-nameable sweetness pursuaded me otherwise. The palate is strong and thick with bitterness."
"after after a few of these I thought I should rate this beer. from the bottle. poured a nice Garnet with a tan head that left some good lacing. aroma a nice citrus mixture of oranges, lemon, tangerine and grapefruit, sugar, hops, grassy. flavor all that nice sweet citrus with a nice bitterness and dryness I am glad that I can now buy this when ever I want"
"D - I must say I'm not worthy, but a bomber or two would be quite the pleasure."
"Overall, the nose is spellbinding, the appearance good. The balance of hops to malt seems such to enliven the hops, but to not let it get overly out of character. Perfect in that sense. The finish is rich with flavors, but I would have liked to see a bit more complexity on the foretaste though. Excellent overall."
"Served in a pint glass, the Arrogant Bastard pours an amber/brown color with about an inch thick tan head. Good lacing too. The aroma is of sweet malt, caramel and citrusy hops, very nice. The initial taste is malty sweetness, and then has a good bitter hop finish with a bit of noticable alcohol warming after drinking it a while. The mouthfeel is medium/full bodied, and it's very smooth. Drinkability is high as well, it goes down easy. This is an excellent beer that's very well balanced, I'd recommend it to anyone."
"D - There is no denying that this beer is worthy of every accolade it has thus received from all other raters, and now me. Smooth and delicious, but full of bold and assertive flavor -- as well as alcohol! Be careful. This beer may be good, but it's still a Bastard."
"D- very drinkable for a beer with a 7.2 ABV%, one of my faves, first tried this beer at the age of 17 and thought it was absolutely disgusting, how things change, a truly awesome beer"
"At least the name will scare away any not worthy beer drinkers."
"Overall a very graceful and gentle ale that doesn't reflect its name at all. Don't get me wrong, this ale can throw haymakers with the best of them, but I'm very impressed with its remarkable balance and pleasant demeanor. I'm very glad to greet Stone's entry into the Michigan market with open arms (and mouth). The masterfully showcased hop profile in this beer would make me believe it was an IPA. I'll gladly submit to this strong ale any day."
"this is an awersome beer, so glad there is distro in michigan now."
"Pours a deep, dark garnet in color with an excellent and very thick off-white head and lacing that never ends. Smell is dominated by big floral hops with hints of piney hops and a touch of roasted malts. Taste is damn good, there are some malts up front but they are quickly overtaken by floral hops. The taste is much like an IPA but more subdued and balanced. Nice mouthfeel with a medium body. The alochol content is well masked. Drinkability is excellent as the flavor is superbely balanced."
"Mouthfeel is good, not overly carbonated but the drinkability isn't really there. This beer could be an EXCELLENT brew, and live up to it's hype, if it was just smoother and not so uneven -- but that's just my opinion. It's still much better than most beers out there."
"Poured a reddish brown color with a white head leaving a little lacing. Smell is full of piney hops, there's definately a strong malt base, but this is hops all the way. Taste starts a little sweet with some caramel, but is quickly full of piney hops. Pretty good. Medium bodied, higher carbonation. Once again, pretty good, and is worth a try."
"I really enjoyed this brew the first time I had it and I'm still enjoying it after drinking it many times. Aggressively poured a three inch frothy light brown head w/ a cloudy dark amber/ caramel hue. The head last throughout the drink and left good amount of lacing. The aroma was outstanding. Heavy malt/ caramel and a moderate piney or perfume hop. Although this brew is an American Strong Ale, the amount of hops would make you think its a IPA. (YUM). Finally, when I taste. It began w/ a moderate sweet caramel and had a long lasting heavy citrus hop ending. The bastard has a nice medium body, watery and lively feel to it. IMO this brew rocks, but it could turn many drinkers off. If your a hophead, I recommend this brew. Enjoy"
"Drinkability: I discovered this gem at Murphy's in Prescott, AZ in 2000. I saw it on the beer list, and thought the name was hysterical so I had to order one. I quickly realized that this was no mere novelty beer. This is by no means for the faint of heart, but if you're up to it, I think you'll find this to be very quaffable for a brew of this magnitude."
"Let me just say right now this review may be a bit biased. My beer drinking ""journey"" started with this beer and I always find myself coming back to it. And I will declare right now Stone is my favorite beer company. Thier beers are not for the timid, the gargoyle has just punched me in the nuts a few times but of course he helps you up and burshes you off. In general all of the stone beers are pretty strong and this one started the tradition I think. Well anyway on to the arrogant bastard! Pours a dark cherry with a very light tan head that stays and laces very well. The smell is hops, alcohol and citrus fruits. A complex tate the hops jump out but I also pick out peach, dark fruits, fresh bread, and the alcohol sting just in the background. The mouthfeel is pretty thick but enjoyable. Not a chore to drink at all! At least for me. I could drink this stuff all night but after more then 2 bombers I would need to take a cab. As I said before stone is truly one of my favorite beer companies and I always love trying thier special releases. And they never let me down! Thier beer is always good and strong! This beer gave me an appreciation for craft beers in general so I do owe it somewhat of a debt. Never a bad choise but if your looking for something ""lighter"" then go with something rogue and don't mess with the gargoyle!"
"Tastes a bold, hoppy, somewhat bitter roasted caramel malt. Mouthfeel is excellent, bold but adequately watery with just the right carbonation and hoppy after-bite. The fruits are still there but the alcohol taste is stronger Perhaps a little too strong for this AbV, but Im already sold by this point. It really is an arrogant bastard. Good beer."
"D: A good beer...under the right conditions, a great beer. Tonight, this beer was hitting me as a little too bitter and sticky. A bomber took a long time to finish, though it was enjoyable and is definitely recommended."
"Slight thickness in the mouth but defintely not chewy. Just enough to savor the flavor. Definitely a worthwhile brew."
"I remember trying this beer years ago when I was still into BMC, and not being able to handle all the flavor. It's great to look back and see how this is the epitome of craft beer in how much really goes into it. A bastard among the rest, this one speaks for itself."
"Arrogant Bastard Ale pours a dark reddish brown with a thin off white head. This is a really good, aromatic beer. Hops dominate the aroma, but there are esters noticeable too. Taste is definitely heavy on the hops, but the malt is doing a fairly good job of balancing it out. There is an estery, almost metallic flavor near the end. This was an older sample, I'd say it would only be better fresh, with stronger hop flavors."
"What a fantastic beer! I'd had this a couple times before and thought it was good, but not this good. I guess my palate has developed enough that I can truly appreciate it. This beer is quite common in my area, so I tend to overlook it in favor of more exotic options. That's a mistake on my part. Truly a great beer that often gets overlooked due to its abundance and hype. Marketing tactics aside, this beer kicks ass! Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Deceptively easy to drink, dangerous with the 7%+ alcohol content. Wish I could get this in Nebraska. Texas BAs should not complain too loudly, as they can at least get this."
"Pours almost a light brownish to dark ruby red. Topped with a hearty two to three inch head that last and leaves a good lace wich stays until you wash the glass. Good strong smell of malt with citrus mabey grapefruit. Smell doesn't show the true hops that are in this beer. Great ballance, this beer smells good. Taste like nectar from heaven. A good malty, piney, begining then with a sweet, grapefruit again middle. The hops are present the whole way through but especially after. A very thick coating ale by all means. Not all good things last as long as AB ale. I know I have many more beers to try, but right now this is very close if not at the top of my list. If you haven't you should ASAP. I will re-review this if necessary, but not likley."
"Raises a one inch puls head, light tan-orange hued head, slow to fall, with dense lacing. The body is ruby-copper, and barely transparent. The nose is of light grapefruit and pine (light for an IPA, anyway), with lots of caramel sweetness. The taste starts with strong bitterness and hop flavor, which fades quickly to a sweet caramel finish. Nice citrus notes. This beer is really balanced! Has a medium-low mouthfeel, with medium carbonation. Reminds me of a jacked-up ESB somehow. What a surprise, I hated this the first time I had it, at a place I continue to suspect for its tap lines."
"Anyone familiar with this beer has no doubt seen the brewers' tongue-in-cheek ""You probably won't like it," warning on the back. What a bunch of arrogant bastards! This beer is great!"
"D- I didn't really enjoy this beer. I'm glad I got to try it at a bar for $5 a pint instead of buying a 22 oz bomber and suffering through it. I don't enjoy this beer much at all."
"A unique concoction that's both intense and aggressive to the tastebuds. This one's best enjoyed shared and savored. Also, if you let this warm up a bit, the darker malt characteristics seep through."
"Drank this from a tasting glass. Poured a nice reddish amber color with a nice head that diminished to a nice lace. This is a beatiful beer. The nose is nice, taste great this is a great beer. Stone has another winner. I am drinking this beer with a meal of rack of lamb and it taste great."
"A strong ale is definitely accurate to describe this beer. I hadn't had one in several years and thought I would revisit it. The presentation is quite nice with a deep auburn color from the bomber to the pint glass. A thick head with tons of lacing that lasts forever. A very powerful and complex aroma with all kinds of components: various malts chocolate, spice, florals, with an alcohol kick and very aggressive hop finish without being overly bitter. Better than I remember. Mouthfeel is perfectly suited to the taste medium body with no more and no less than it needs. Drinkability for 1 or 2 is great but beyond that the alcohol and body limit the sessioning prospects. Excellent brew to wash away a bad day or celebrate a good one."
"Personal note: The increased level of my smell and taste since I quit smoking is incredible. I highly recommend quitting to anyone who really enjoys beer--going through the ""quitter's flu"" is more than offset by the pleasure I get at enjoying beer on new levels."
"A tremendous beer..."
"On second thought you probably shouldnt. Youre Not Worthy"
"D: Wow. The copy on the bottle has made the rounds around here, and that was my introduction to this beer (""you probably won't like this beer""). But this is strong stuff, really bold and assertive, and is a great way to get a hop fix, even if you're not a huge hophead (like me). It has enough supporting flavors that I don't feel like I'm drinking hop juice. Not a beer I can pound a lot of, but a really drinkable brew."
"Cheers to Stone Brewing!"
"An instant classic, that has become somewhat of a novelty beer. Regardless, it has superb flavors and a good mouthfeel. A must have!"
"Overall, a robust and very enjoyable beer."
"Dark clear brown color with a medium dark brown head. Tons of thin sticky lacing all the way down the glass. A thin head sitting on top of the beer the whole time beer is in the glass. Sweet toasted malt smell with some alcohol and nutty character. Hearty roasted taste that's slightly nutty with some fruitiness to it. Alcohol taste with hints of caramel. Not a lot of hop taste. A twangy sharp finish that leaves my mouth extremely dry. A great brew. Definitely worth all of the hype it receives. Thanks to BeerBeing for this tasty and excitingly complex brew. I'd be glad to have this be a regular tap in my town... Sigh. Maybe one day Stone will make it here."
"At first, I did not like this one. It is bitter....but it grew on me and is now one of my favorites. The name really fits the beer. The high abv discourages me from drinking more than a pint at a time, especially if I am driving. The sight of the empty keg by the back door broke my heart, till I was told there was another keg in the cooler. This is the beer I wait to drink all day at work, it makes everything all better. Good thing I work in a bar with great beer on tap. I actually have tried to get my friends to try this and you know the response I get. When I found some at the local liquor store, the guy asked me if I was sure I wanted to pay for that crap. People need educated. This is an amazing beer, just not for the weak and unworthy....and yes, I am worthy."
"d - this is a great brew but one to drink in moderation. you can really feel the warming sensation of the alcohol at the end and it's really pleasant."
"This is a great beer, from the name to the label, and best of all, the beer itself. Pours to a hazy, orange-red color, and a tan head that lingers throughout the entire beer, leaving excellent lacing up and down the glass. Strong aroma of citrusy hops, mostly grapefruit, stays stready throughout. Hoppy bitterness at first is nicely balanced by a hint of malty sweetness at mid-glass. Finish is an excellent, smooth bittersweet. I was looking forward to this beer, and once again was not disappointed by Stone."
"D: A favorite. I'll drink this all night if given the chance."
"This is a brew I will be back to again, whenever I can find it."
"Pours reddish brown with creamy off white head that lingers for a while. Aroma is all hops, I know the malt must be there, but I can't detect it. Flavor is complex hop bitterness and flavor, then carmel like malt flavor. The hop bitterness does seem to overwhelm everything else though. Mouthfeel is medium to full with noticeable alcohol burn in my throat after a few drinks. The bitterness seems a bit out of balance for my taste, but its still an ok beer. I think it is a little overrated."
"A fantastic offering. A friend brought me this back from a trip to California, and now, I am begging her to go back. Would go very well to start of with the appetizers at an italian eatery. A nice table cheese, with some bread and red pepper infused olive oil would be heavenly. A must try for anyone with even a moderate appreciation for hops."
"Drinkability - Definately do not drink this beer if you are planning on trying anything else in the same session. It is the most strongly-flavored brew I think that I have ever had. Lots of in-your-face flavors going on. A very intimidating beer for drinkers who are used to lighter-bodied and less flavorful brew. I won't be having much in one sitting, although it is a great flavorful beer to end on."
"Certainly a beer you can't go wrong with, but it's best to probably only have one or two."
"I couldn't see myself drinking too many of these at one sitting but I can see where you might get addicted to this bitterness."
"D = Very drinkable. But I don't think I could drink too many of these in one session."
"Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass. Big, thick head with lots of lacing. Color was a deep red almost brown and translucent. Aroma was like walking through a pine forest. Taste was a wonderful, sweet malt taste with a strong hop presence in the back of the throat, finishing with a strong hop bitterness. Very easy to put down but dangerous to put back more than one with the high ABV. Awesome, awesome beer!"
"Lived up to the hype. Big and balanced, wonderfully constructed. I'll be arrogant and call myself worthy. The beer is worthy too."
"Excellent mouth feel and highly drinkable. I prefer the draft version but this is still a very fine brew."
"Arrogant indeed!"
"Easily put away a 22 oz. bomber. Glad to finally learn that I am worthy! Good stuff!"
"Definitely recommended. But be careful, this stuff is pretty hard core."
"This pours a dark reddish mahogony with a fluffy medium tan head. A beer that looks hardy with the feel of winter and a roaring fire. The smell has a real hop citrus aroma thats not quite as strong as their IPA, but nice. The taste has a great mix of hop bitterness, sweet malt and spices, cinnamon, pepper, and carmel. The m/f is medium and very well balanced. Some Strong Ales are are way too ""syrupy", but this is smooth and it hides the alcohol well. An outstanding beer and I'm glad I finally found a place that sold it."
"There is much more cinnamon in this beer than I remember from the first time. This beer pours with one of the most unique cascading effects that I have seen since Boddington's. Generous head that lingers for a long time. The smell, as stated, as much cinnamon with a hint of plums and candied fruits. A great amount of carbonation that lets the taste sit and develop on your tongue before going down. Overall a tremendous brew."
"Dark brown hue with a tint of red nice tan head, small bubbles  nose hops, French vanilla coffee grounds hops, dark roast coffee taste  raw palate- aftertaste hops and coffeeDark brown hue with a tint of red nice tan head, small bubbles  nose hops, French vanilla coffee grounds hops, dark roast coffee taste  raw palate- aftertaste hops and coffee"
"Drinkability - Could down a few of these in a night, but I dunno, I found this to be nothing special so I prolly wouldnt do that."
" the marketing is way off though, this beer is a mild weak puppy, especially compared to what the bottle claims : )"
"Drink one, or drink five, it doesn't matter. On a warm day, or on a cold day, this one is guaranteed to hit the spot. This beer unequivocally deserves to be arrogant."
"Anyone have any double bastard they want to trade?"
"Ain't beer grand?"
"D - This is a great tasting beer. You'll zip through 22oz before you know it. I'm glad I gave this another shot - it's definitely one of my favorites now."
"Medium-bodied mouthfeel, but the drinkability suffers due to the strength of the hops. Although not nearly as bitter as the Ruination IPA, this is definitely one for the hopheads. Would recommend this one to anyone who thinks they are ""worthy."""
"Simply put one of the best, most complex beers I have ever tasted. The appearance is amazing. Dark, ruby red/brown tint with a caramel colored head that leaves uber Belgian-like amounts of lacing and never dissipates throughout being drunk. Probably has the best head retention I've ever seen out of a pint glass. The smell is actually pretty sweet, not bitter like the bottle and company suggests. Very cocoa and caramel like. The taste is the amazing part. The 7.2% is very well hidden leaving you to actually be able to scarf some arrogance down fairly fast, but why would you do that anyways?...Many, many different flavors bombarding your mouth at once. The mouthfeel is fairly heavy, but not sticky, which is perfect for me. Creamy once you get to the head. In fact, about the last 1% of the pour is pure cream. Awesome. Drinkability is damn good for how strong this beer is. There are just so many good aspects its amazing. Everyone must try this. Gotta love the bottle too!"
"Rich, slightly cloudy, deep Amber/Brown color. One of the best looking beers I've seen. Very minimal smell. Very smooth with a perfect amount of bitterness. What I liked about this was that the flavor was strong, but at the same time extremely drinkable. One of the best American beers I've had. Another fine offering from Stone."
"This is a beautiful looking beer with a deep red/copper color to it. It has a big hop aroma, too, very citrusy and piney. These people must love using cascade, chinook or perle hops. It has a slightly heavy body, but is definitely drinkable. With your first taste you get the wonderful citrus piney hop flavor on your palate and then it mellows out and the bitterness flows through leaving a nice crisp finish. This is a very nice beer to drink and because of the big hop flavor you don't even realize it weighs in at 7.2%. Hmmmm . . ."
"a nice dark reddish golden brown with a woody almost earthy scent. the hops certainly can pack a punch, this time around, the ABA tastes much better than the first time this beer toutched my unworthy palate. After some taste bud assults like Ruination, the hops in this beer pale in comparison, but still stand out and strongly proclaim ""I AM HERE!"" a hops lover will like this beer."
"Pours a dark red with an off white head. Smell is mostly hops with citrus and some yeast. Taste is bold with a medium body, mostly hops followed by some citrus characters and fruit maybe prunes. For such an intimidating label the taste reminds me of flowers. It has a bitter aftertaste that lingers from the hoppy presence. The mouthfeel is ok, lots of carbonation, decent balance. This beer is strong and if you are afraid of hops then stay away. It does represent a potent beer, but the label got me amped up for something much more. A good stone offering and worth checking out. This one has me wondering now about the double bastard, I will probably try that one soon."
"it's a tasty brew, but i'll take nosferatu or hibernation ale over it any day"
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into my pint, this beer was a dark auburn color. Great lacing around the glass, long lasting frothy head. The first smell is all about the hops. Nice hoppy/piney nose, with a bit of maltiness and slight alcohol as well. Just like the smell, the first sip shouts ""HOPS"". Very hoppy up front, but mellows nicely. Let it warm, it gets even smoother. The roasted maltiness and carmel also nicely round out the profile. Even thought this is a smooth beer, as big beers like this go, you can definitely taste the alchohol, which is a good thing. Overall, you must try this beer, if the label doesn't scare you away."
"Appearance was a clear dark brown/copper color which formed a light tan head of decent size. Aroma was more subdued than I would have expected. Primarily hops, with a mild grapefuit/grass aroma. Malt is fairly represented, but hops is primary aroma. Flavor was a lightly roasted malt, well balanced by the hops, again with a grapefruit type flavor. Some alcohol was present, but not excessive. Light to medium in body, with fairly high carbonation. The alcohol came out a little bit more as a warming sensation, and the effect of the beer was drying. Overall, a great beer which was highly drinkable."
"A very good brew - easily drinkable - a bit thinner than it could have been, but still aggressive - esp. in the mouthfeel."
"All in all, a curious brew that falls between classification... thus, an ""American Strong Ale"". I would recommend at least giving it a whorl to everyone."
"D- abv is so well hidden, hops is so present without being in your face, malt and sweetness are such perfectly subtle balances that this brew is an easy 'big session.' it may be over-indulgent in hindsight, but i could definitely see this luring an unsuspecting participant into an evening affair."
"Love the bottle ... ""This is an aggressive beer. You probably won't like it."" Haha. This is a great gift beer if you really want to ""rub it in"" to your yellow dishwater drinking friends. Over the top in a lot of ways. My bottle pours a slightly murky brown color with some glowing red highlights. Thick, bubbly tannish head and great retention and lacing in the glassware. Beautiful streaming carbonation. Nose is aggressive indeed. Strong hop notes, piney and some sour citrus. This is balanced by a thick, warm malt character. Smells terrific and in no way simple. Palate is likewise -- both thick, mouth-coating caramel malts with biting, resinous hops darting around. Complex palate that is so very complex. What is this beer? Falls into the elusive ""strong ale"" category. In other words, we don't know what it is, but it's something to be reckoned with ... Mouthfeel is thick and both smooth and biting. Aggressive carbonation and a lingering hop-bitter finish. What a complex creation. No wonder the bottle warns that this beer wasn't created for the ""sniveling yellow beer drinking wimps."" This is the liquid equivalent of the middle finger to that ilk. Excellent."
"This beer is like a DIPA with a lot less bittering hops and thus a more obvious malt profile. Lots of aroma hops give the taste of a highly hopped ale but in reality it is very malty. I love it and frankly I don't find it ""strong"" at all. This is an awesome beer. Super malty with a very nice hop ambiance that does not interfere with all that great maltyness but just lets it do it's thing."
"A serving note, if you want to really experience the flavor and aroma of this beer, serve room temp. That's true of most beers, but especially this one. If you serve it ice-cold, you'll miss the show."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is full bodied. The beer has lingering hop oilyness. The beer is pleasingly complex. This beer was oddly very smooth on draft. This is a very drinkable bastard. I dont think I would try to make an evening with Arrogant Bastard. But Arrogant Bastard is a great beer to have on any evening."
"Highly recommended and worth the high price."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability- Light Carbonation. Was very smooth and went down with ease. Could drink a few."
"Pretty much the only reason I bought this was because of its name and the design that was on the bottle. I guess you could say I'm a sucker for their marketing scheme. The Arrogant Bastard poured out a brilliant dark shade of red, and I do mean dark. As far as color and appearance goes, this is one of the prettier beers I've ever seen. I could definitely smell the hops on this one, along with something else that could maybe be described as fruity, but the hops are prevalent for sure. The mouthfeel was a very pleasant sensation, very smooth, and the overall taste of the beer is like a swift kick to the taste buds. It comes on at first with a kind of sweet taste which is quickly followed up by all the hops that you got from the scent. On the whole this isn't a style of beer I'm particularly fond of, I can appreciate it for a beer or three, but not much more than that."
"As the label humorously implies, this one ain't for everybody. It's big, it's bitter, it's bold, it's brash. But it's also so remarkably well made and well balanced that it's my opinion that anyone who considers themselves to be beer lovers must seek it out to try at least once. I don't believe I'd use this one as an intro to craft beers for a devout BMC drinker, but this is a great hook to sink into anyone already fishing craft waters. Simply put, it's beautiful. Great beer."
"This is an intense, well-crafted, complex strong ale that deserves the credit it gets. A deal at $3.49/bomber in AZ as well. Also reminded me a lot of Bell's 3rd Coast Old Ale."
"Pours a lovely dark red color with minimal head that dissipates quickly and leaves a trace of tan lace. Smell is very floral, maybe roses and something sharp that hints at the bitterness to come. Taste is good, ALL hops. No malt within a mile of this one. The first taste is floral, maybe pine, then it rounds into a lovely, soft licorice-like roast that is not burnt at all. It sort of lulls you into complacency and then the bitterness comes on like a freight train, painting the back of the tongue with a burnt coffee sharpness. Not even something I can describe as aftertaste so much as a oral hangover. This is not my style (I suppose I live up to their ""you're not worthy"" motto) so I may be a bit jaded. Mouthfeel is very good, hits a good balance of roundness without being heavy. Drinkability - low. Low low low. I can't imagine making it through more than one in a session, just too much hops. All in all, probably a good example of a style that appeals to...someone other than me."
"Poured a reddish color with a large, tan head that stayed around and left a nice lacing on the glass. The aroma was citrusy, with tons of sweet malt and floral hops. Taste of bitter hops, cherries, roasted and caramel malts, with bitter grapefruit flavors on the way down. Thankfully I did not see any difference in bottles brewed at the new facility."
"D: The first time I had this beer, I thought it was overwhelming, and I had trouble finishing one 22-oz bottle. Coming back to it, after having tried some real beer, I find it an irresistable (if not perfect) brew, and it will be in my fridge quite frequently. Easier to drink than a stout, but not quite a session beer."
"D: This is a very easy beer to drink for how big it is, though it's definatly not for everyone ""sophisticated"" or not. When I'm in the mood for a beer but not sure what I'm in the mood for this is what I get."
"Complex yet not difficult to drink or enjoy. A little too sweet for me."
"Most of this talk is rubbish. And I dont' care. One of the best beers I'll ever have."
"Hazy brown amber liquid poured gently from the bottle. Head is like a maniac on the loose ... 3 fingers in width. Nose is far too faint for my tastes. Pine, caramel, orange, and butter. I really have to strain to make out these scents. Taste is massive pine, burnt caramel, diacetyl, and pleasing bitterness. At the tail end I detect some pleasant grain. Mouth is perfectly modertate. I didn't care for this (I wasn't worthy?) the first several times I tried it. Something about the fruitiness didn't seem to mesh with the caramel. I had no such issues this time."
"The beer is very enjoyable and drinkable, but it's heavy bitterness will probably prevent someone from drinking too many at once. A very noteable beer."
"Drinkability? It seems wasteful to drink too much Arrogant Bastard. It's so powerfully distinct in its big, up-front flavors, that I appreciate it best in the context of other beers. After enjoying an AB, IPA's seem crisper, english bitters seem smoother, and doppelbocks seem sweeter."
"Eric"
"Tastebuds be warned, this beer has an incredible kick. For true hopheads. I found this beer on tap at a local pub. Poured with an adequate tan head that left small amounts of lacing on the glass. Fresh hops on the nose. Grapefruit and hop resin on the front, backed by a rich caramel maltiness. Finishes clean, leaving you refreshed. Good by itself but but with food. Especially something that has alot of Garlic. Yum."
"Pours a two finger dark tan head over a semi-cloudy rich red-rust liquid. Smells mild. Piney hops and grapefruit pith. Touch of caramel. Tastes hoppy bitter with nice fruity hop flavors and a nearly equally competing malt sweet. Hop flavor is oranges and grapefruit pith with a touch of tangerine. Esters are peaches. Malt is light-colored caramels and a bit of smoke (which may actually be a a result of hop grassy character). Thick body and moderate carbonation. Not the 'arrogant bastard' that I was expecting. I guess in today's extreme beers, this one just falls in line."
"Drinkability was quite good. Very complex but not so much so that you need to drink it in small increments."
"Full body, but not heavy. Exceptionally smooth. Carbonation is hardly noticable. There is a beautiful contrast between the velvety mouthfeel and the pine hop flavors. I guess I'm worthy. I really enjoyed this beer!"
"Arrogant Bastard is big, bold, and beautiful. There is nothing subtle in this. It is as advertised."
"It's got a spot as Stone's signature beer, but I personally like the IPA and RIS better. With that said, it's still a wonderful beer and one of those beers I'm always recommending for people looking to try a good beer to see what all the talk is about."
"Very drinkable."
"Cheers."
"I bought this beer for my birthday back in December and am just now getting around to drinking it. The beer had a fair amount of head and is a deep mahogany color. The smell is of honey and hops. The taste is pretty aggressive. Hop bitterness and a slight alcohol ting highlight this brew. The mouthfeel is smooth considering the higher ABV. The drinkability is very good for the style. The alcohol is there but in a very inviting way. This is a bold beer. Certainly one I will try again."
"Woo Hoo"
"D: Drinkable? Hell yes! Stone doesn't dissapoint with this arrogant bastard. What a great tasting beer."
"Interesting beer. One of those ""extreme beers"" that many go for. I tend to prefer mine a bit more balanced. If you threw in some more malt and maybe used a less attenuative yeast, you'd have yourself a pretty nice barleywine. As it is, it's a hop-lover's delight."
"Drinkability: Arrogant Bastard definitely lives up to its hype. I've had this numerous times and everytime I have one, I forget how good it is. Those big, piney, citrusy like hops do it for me, a fantastic bitterness that only makes you want to drink more. Alcohol is very well hidden, and the brown sugar sweet malt gives AB a very nice balance. Highly drinkable for a 7.2% abv. one that I will always come back to. A true classic that must not be missed."
"it tastes great, but it can be hard to get one down before it warms up and excessive esteriness and hops come out."
"for being pretty strong on the alcohol content, this is a fairly easy brew to consume. just not too many. drink this one carfully, or else it'll trick you."
"First thing that hits you is the strong hop aroma, along with a very toasty carmel malt flavor. A very dark red color. Medium off white/tannish color head with medium carbonation. Flavor is very bitter, but tends to leave you with a good aftertaste. Strong but goes down somewhat smooth. This is one of the best beers I have tasted to date. Not one for drinking in large quanities, one to be enjoyed slowely at the end of a very long day."
"Drinkability: This beer is so good. I like to drink it on it's own. If I were to pair it with food, the food would have to be very flavorful not to be overpowered. It looks amazing and tastes great, I'll take this any day, I fear it will become trendy because of it's great bottle, but I'll always know why I like it."
"This one is too damn drinkable, I found myself longing for another. Even with the extra alcohol, Arrogant Bastard is dangerously easy to down. This will be on my list of beers to seek out."
"I've looked all around and a 22oz bomber is usually $3.99 to $5.29. This is just a great beer for a VERY good price. Even at the high $5.29."
"Drinkabilty - very good beer, goes down easy. Would have several of these anytime."
"As the bottle states in so many wordsthis beer is not for the weak. I love huge beers such as this and am very glad I had the opportunity to taste this one."
"Some who are not impressed by this beer forget (or never knew) how important this beer was in convincing other brewers that there was a market for bigger beers. Sure, there are big beers from all over now. But this will always have a place in my heart and my fridge. And its bigger younger (Double) brother will always have a space in my cellar."
"great marketing though. def makes you want to believe that you like it, otherwise you must not like beer. nonetheless, this is a great beer. would def have it again. now i need to check out the double and oaked bastard."
"I enjoy the beers Stone brewseven if their advertising smacks of elitism. ABA is a very nice beer and it is made even better as it is widely available here in Las Vegas."
"d - due to the high ABV i wouldn't recommend this as a session beer, but it definately is great if you want to take the edge off."
"Pours a dark crimson into one of Jupiters hoity-toity pint glasses. Medium thickness whitish head that quickly dissipates. Heavily loaded caramel base with powerful grapefruit and juniper aromas. Blistering hoppiness that manages to not overwhelm the strong caramel body. Some nice toast and roasted character. Wonderfully balanced. Quite impressive really. This beer has a reason to be arrogant. Body is firm. Finish is mouth coating maintaining its outstanding balance. Surprisingly drinkable."
"I dont know how good os a session beer this one is. The hoppy flavor, although good, is a little overbearing, making it hard to enjoy too many. Also, the alcohol content is just a little high. This beer is good, but only every once in a while."
"D - Definitely an over the top beer that is enjoyable but it just seems like there is a little too much going on."
"Arrives glowing orange against the sun setting off in the distance. Topped with 1"" of sticky whitish head. Head lingers for quite some time before fading. Leaves amazing lacing all the way down the glass. Smells of hearty hops backed up with with loads of sweet malt. A hop moster, but a balanced hop monster. Chewy in the mouth and light on carbonation. Love to drink it, but it is a workout."
"I wasn't sure the Bastard would live up to all its hype, but it didn't disappoint me. I may have even thought a bit more of it had I not first sampled it after my first experience with FFF Dreadnaught (what a divine beer!). If Stone brews were available in my home area, I would definitely make this one a regular."
"I underestimated this brew...it really kicked my arse."
"This beer pours a rich amber color with a thick head that lingers. Very hoppy aroma. Bold taste with hints of fruit and extreme hoppyness. This beer makes me so hoppy. Good carbonation makes this beer feel good in your mouth. Leaves a bitter aftertaste which is nice. Overall this is one of my favorite beers. If you can get your hands on it, buy it. You will be impressed."
"Arrogant Bastard pours a deep burnt caramel color with an impressive chunky-foamy tan colored head. Aromas of fruitcake, pine, juniper, lime zest and candied fruits soar from thy glass. The taste is rich and flavorful, having a warm roasted malt and bitter hop lip-smacking interaction that is truly outstanding. Dangerously easy to quaff, the embedded natural carbonation creates the perfect atmosphere for this turbo-enhanced brew, as this active and dense carbonation carries itself onboard in a perfect way. I have tried a few of Stones products and Ive always felt that they lacked an element of profound complexity. This ale stands out as my favorite to date, having many more layers of complexity, much better in proportion, balance and just a better synthesis of its total parts creating one. This is a fantastic presentation of the style, perhaps the icon."
"It's a good looking beer, nice and dark, rich and deep red color in the glass. Aroma is also good, portending a solid beer. Taste is good but over the top, strong in the hops, moderate in the malt, and way too bitter. Mouthfeel is clouded by the bitterness. Due to its extreme nature, this is an average drinkability at best."
"In related news, I love Stone Brewing."
"I think everyone should try this once."
"Overall, this is one of my favorite beers. A must try."
"I go back and forth wether I like this or Ruination more. RARELY does a beer come along that is new and original. Something that hasn't been done yet. Hoppy and bitter, alcoholic and deep. Color is somewhat amber and non flattering, hiding the truth. Head holds its own thru the entire course"
"Clear red-brown in color. Not much of a head, but what's there sticks around. Pleasant fruity-sweet aroma. Lots of flavor -- mollases, chocolate and toasted maltiness and hops too. Rather light bodied for the intense flavor. Clean, dry finish. This one packs a punch while being very smooth. Nice. And dangerous."
"Overall, I wouldn't drink this again, but I think that people who like this style of beer would like it."
"won this bottle in a bet. pours red and clear with a white foamy head. vaguely sweet malt odor with some metallic hop smell...not all that impressive on the nose. very tasty. caramel hops, quite bitter and sweet. come citrus flavors coming through too...grapefruit and oranges. and a nuttiness too. syrupy mouthfeel. an extrememly enjoyable beer from Stone. I'll remember the hops and the thick malty caramel feel. truely delicious and extremely drinkable."
"Nice looking ruby-brown body with a good solid off-white head and lacing. The smell was elusive as I noticed a few different things but couldn't place anything precisely (i think my nose is going bad on me). The taste revealed a strong toasted malt flavor to the point where I second guessed that I was drinking a stout. But then the hops smacked me awake. Fruitiness. Some souring on my tongue that I didn't mind. Good all around really."
"I am a big fan of Stone brews, but I have not got around to reviewing many of them. Arrogant Bastard has not been one of my favorite of the Stone lineup, but it is very good to say the least. I am drinking this from a 22oz bomber in a pint glass. It pours a deep mohagany with a nice tan head that last for a litte while. AB has a very nice aroma with hints of roasted malt and and grapefruit hoppiness. The flavor is aggressive with a good bit of hops upfront and nice malt middle with a slight hint of Belgian candied sugar. It has quite a bit of bittering hops in the end and aftertaste. The aftertaste is a little harsh due to the bitterness and a small amount of alcohol warming which effects the drinkability. AB has a nice medium body and is a very drinkable beer if you are into aggressive beers. This a very solid beer from Stone, but my favorite of the lineup is still Ruination."
"Bottom line: good but not great. I'm just an old-school guy, and the over-the-top, IBU-flooded bitterness is just not for me. I love the fact that a Stone exists and that they're willing to push the envelope, but for me, the defining factor of a great beer is balance and harmony. While Arrogant Bastard offers that in its wonderfully inviting, strong but not overpowering, aroma--sweet and citrusy, that I pegged as grapefruit at first but then became more mango-like, with a very pleasant floral hop background--the flavor is just too bitter. As the beer warms, the complexity begins to come out in the background, but it's still dominated by the raw, even harsh, bitterness of the excessive hops--kind of like a good piece of music being overpowered by the bass being turned up way too high. If only the bittering hops were turned down, allowing some of the sweetness of the malt to come through, this would truly be a great beer. Or maybe it really is a great beer, and I'm just ""not worthy""."
"This is one beer you dont want to serve to cold or else you will lose a large amount of flavor."
"Good crisp finish. Nice beer."
"drinkablity: a very nice beer, good mix of hops and bitter. the mouthfeel makes it easy to drink. one of my first american craft beers, always worth a drink, a local dive has this on tap for 3 bucks, what more is there to know."
"My nonic is filled with a nice ruby brown liquid with about one and a half inches of thick, dense light tan head. I find the aroma has more of a sweet malt character with citrus and floral hops coming in at the end. The taste is excellent! Spicy, fruity, a bit sweet in the beginning with a touch of smokiness to it. Bitterness from the hops come in upon swallowing with a smooth, slick, slightly thick mouthfeel. It just fills your mouth full of goodness. Thanks Stone...the pleasure was all mine."
"Always a good choice for me. I just wish Stone would sell them in 12oz bottles. Great Lakes Nosferatu comes in 12oz and is really similar to Arrogant Bastard if anyone is looking for a comparison."
"Fairly strong in the large bottle, so I guess not the most drinkable beer in the world, but certainly something I was glad to have 22 oz of."
"Overall this was a great beer. I doubt that I would ever order it again, but it was great to order once. It was pretty freakin' intense, but at the same time mild. The bottle was oversized for this beer. I would have wished for a smaller bottle, the bigger bottle forced me to feel as if I needed to drink it. I am looking for someone to beer mail me directing me to a book or placethat can teach me more about appreciating beer."
"Full of flavor but not so overwhelming that you're ready to move on to something else after one."
"This beer would have been all 5's if it would have been a bit easier to drink. The hop bitterness really lasts throughout and destroys your pallate. But it is worth it. Without question one of my top 5 of all time."
"Drinkability: This beer is clearly not for everyone. It is not a beer you would give to a man or a woman dying of thirst or an aficionado of American swill. To me it is awesome; to others I don't know."
"Served from a 22 oz. bomber, the second pour in to a goblet reveals a thick, deeply-colored, lasting head similar to Brasserie des Rocs Grand Cru. The hoppy finish and slight alcohol taste was also more apparent on the second serving. If only the supply lines in PA were better established!"
"Mouthfeel is incredibly creamy, considering the bubbles I saw in the beginning. I wouldn't drink this every day, it's so unique that it strikes me as a special-occasion type thing. But wow, it's delicious. Somewhere between a malt liquor, a double IPA, an old ale and a barleywine...this is another fantastic beer from the creative freaks at Stone. Long may they brew."
"D- I wish I get this more often, but Stone hasn't arrived in Florida yet. If I can get a regular supplier of this I will buy more than 2 bottles nest time. Overall a very good beer."
"Side note: This ale's name and bottle humor me the same way Kanye West humors me. They are both just so full of themselves and I find both to be very funny."
"This is the type of beer that is so deep it is hard to actually pin point the individual tastes (in a good way) you almost taste something new with each and every sip."
"Onto the review--I served this from a 22 oz bomber into a snifter, it poured a dark deep amber, garnet on the edges, a finger of dense beige head that sticks around for a few minutes before subsiding to a scattered cap. Some decent bits of lacing left behind on the glass. Nose has a nice dose of citric hops as expected, but there is also a strong malt with hints of caramel, dark fruits and brown sugar. Taste meets expectations, starting with a nice full caramel malt, some toasted and nutty flavors detectable, and then giving way to a nice long bitter citrusy lemony hop finish Very nice, certainly hop heavy, but this beer has the malt backbone to keep up. Full bodied with a very nice smooth mouthfeel. This is an incredible beer, a huge American beer that is nonetheless tasty and drinkable if you've acclimated yourself to hops, I wish I didn't have to travel across state lines to get Stone beers."
"I love this beer. It is the most flawlessly balanced beer Ive tried. Some might say its a little hop forward, maybe thats what makes it balanced to a hophead like me."
"Nice big frothy head with good lacing. The head does completely dissappear. The aroms has lots of maly and hops. AI bit different than other strong ales. Eventhought eh alcohol is only 7.2, it's very apparent. I plan on cellaring some of these for a year or so."
"This beer is just all around cool, like if the Fonz made homebrew, he'd make this. I enjoy this every time."
"Pours thick carmel colored almost looks like iced tea. Smells sweet and delicious so many characteristics I don't know where to start, grapes, malt , hops and caramel. The taste is smooth and creamy with hops , malts, caramel and honey . This is a stellar beer and I would put this beer up against any other and be on top .I now understand and deem myself worthy ...thank you Stone Brewing!"
"does it make me an arrogant bastard to consider myself worthy???"
"22 ounce bottle. Loads of caramel with tons of hoppy nose. Upon first sip very caramel flavors and very high spicy bitterness. This beer is exceptionally clear with a amber to red color. Very nice tight white head. excellent mouthfeel and top notch finish"
"Pours out an off-red leathery brown color with few bubbles to be found in the body. Head is kind of small, beige, and leaves rings of lace on the glass. Malt aromas have a little bit of chocolate and toasted grain while the hops lean towards resin. Alcohol is a little to prominent in the nose for me. Flavor is of the toasty malts, lots of fruity esters (reminding me of the their porter), and a big finish of hops: grassy, floral, and earthy, with a pronounced aspirin bitterness that lingers on for a while. Mouthfeel is smooth on carbonation, it is almost to the point of being thick, but doesn't carry too much weight in the mouth. Solid overall drinkability."
"D- again rather average, a good tasty ale, but no complexities"
"This large bottle poured out a reddish brown color ,with a thin head that quickly dissappears.The aroma is of hops and more hops ,as well as pine and citrus.The taste is also hoppy and citrusy,and I guess if this is your favorite style,you will like this beer.As for myself,I think it is a little too hoppy and while I thought it was good.I guess I was expecting more.I suppose I am not worthy."
"A really great and special beer."
"Decent mouthfeel (its best feature), and fairly drinkable. I've had one, now. Probably not again, and certainly not for $4.75 (plus tip) for a pint."
"The scent of this one is enough to love, and the flavor leaves me wanting more."
"High alchole makes this not the most drinkable, but it is much more enjoyable than I remember."
"Cheers!"
"Bottle Pours clear brown with a small creamy light brown head. The head lasts well and produces great lacing. Aroma has a strong maltiness. I get some chocolate with some cookie. The carbination is perfect. Has a full body with a good palate and a slick texture. A good duration and a wonderful finish. A very good aftertaste. This is very good. The bottle has all kinds of insults on it. Its rather amusing. I would not hand one of these to my none craft buddies bt who cares this is darn good beer."
"Overall another great beer from Stone. I can't think of another beer that I could really compare this to but why try anyways, this one is simply great."
"After a bomber of this I felt great, the effects of this beer seem to stick with a little longer than most. Alll in all a great beer, definatly worth a try and on my top five list."
"A heart felt thanks to Bashiba for getting this Bastard to me!!!"
"Bottom Line: ""It is so choice, I highly recommend it if you have the means""."
"Overall, a wonderful beer. I've only ever had one or two 22's at a time, but I think I could drink this all night if I were inclined to shell out the $$."
"Bartender poured it into a plastic pint and got about a half-inch head off the tap. Dark color, almost black. Smelled great. Had some hops and something else in there (can't put my finger on it). Taste is great, this is definitely my favorite American Strong Ale. Hoppy flavor with some smokiness. Overall, a great beer. I like to get at least one of these everytime I head to Skipper's."
"A very complex and tasty ale, definitely not for ""tasteless fizzy yellow beer"" drinkers, and is always one of my favorites...i'll drink to that !!!"
"Overall i hate the fact so many people can go and pick this up at their local store, and it's taken me 2 years to get my hands on a bottle. This is one that i could drink pretty often, depite the rip-your-tongue out flavor. Great beer.... i still dont think i'm worthy."
"I love the taste of this, but the hops can get a little overbearing after a while. A bomber of this is plenty."
"Overall a good beer will drink again"
"Drinkability: When I first had this pre-BA I couldn't even drink this, it was too strong for me at that time and now I can drink this once in a while if I wanted to. If I have another one, I will make sure to have a glass of water sitting next to me after I finish this beer."
"Great Drinkability for a big beer."
"I find this beer to unbalanced and unimpressive. I looks good enough, other than that, isn't all that great. I have no problem with agressive hops...in fact, double bastard is one of my favorites because it is more balanced. However, the lack of sweetness to balance the strong hop profile of Arrogant Bastard leads to a very undrinkable beer."
"Overall a good beer. Very smooth with good taste. Despite what the bottle says, you are worthy."
"Poured a brown amber with a beautiful white head. Aroma has a spicy hoppiness. Powerfully flavored with smashing hops upfront which slides into deep rich malitness. The sweetness/bitterness combination is amazing. Aftertaste is pleasantly bitter. An excellent strong ale. With an abv at 7.2% it is alot easier to take than Bigfoot but with all the flavor you could want. I wish this came in six packs!"
"Cheers!!"
"Overall: Definately strong and bitter throughout, but has nice flavor profile. Not for the novice, but enjoyable for the experienced."
"If you could carbonate alpha acids, this is what it would taste like. Truly fantastic, but not for the non-believer.An aquired taste to say the least."
"I look at the label again, at the gargoyle snarling and hoisting a mug at me (should I have used a mug?!) like he knew this would all happen."
"Wow! ...this poured into an imperial pint glass allows the head to foam freely. Impressive aroma of grainy malt, much like a scotch ale. The flavor is unique. I find it hard to place my finger on it, but thick, sticky-sweet malt mixed with a bit of roated quality. Very close to the taste of a scotch ale, whiskey-like upfront bite. The taste is the highlight of this brew (one of a kind)! The mouthfeel is full and sticky, not too many of these in any one sitting. The drinkability suffers from the same and the fact alcohol isn't light. I enjoyed this brew and will look for it in the furture. I was also plesantly surprised by the taste."
"Drinkability: Hoo mama. So conflicted. The delicious aroma keeps me chugging this bomber, but I'm pretty sure I won't be having a second."
"This is a moderately drinkable beer. Certainly not an everyday kind of beer, and I wouldnt want to have more than a couple in a session. It is a very complex and challenging beer. I would certainly have it again, and probably will."
"Drinkability is very high. AB is far too easy to drink, always a joy to have. Another classic from Stone."
"well. what a treat. man, the head on this was incredible for me. nice and frothy. and it sat for awhile. it looks biege (sp?) clouds sitting on top of a amber-redish sunset. the taste was very malty, almost barley-wine like to me for some reason. was expecting some more hops in it, but ""dats ok. she'll be back. another...."" all around, a pretty decent beer, at decent price that i can groove to."
"Goes down smooth but it is very complex and agressive. This one is very complex and more flavors come out as it warms up. Too bad this is so hard to find near me because I would love to make it a regular."
"Pours chocolately brown with a thick tannish head. Very visually appeally. Smells great...malts hops and barley are most prominant but I detect a slight citrus scent. Tastes strong with hops and roasted malts. This ale is something that I would buy on a regular basis to drink at parties, etc. Very affordable for as superb as it is as well."
"This is a very drinkable and tasty beer."
"Poured a dark ruby/amber color with a large off white head. The head shrunk down to a 1/2 inch and lingered for a good while. Smell was good some citrus but mostly a malt/toasted malt smell. For some reason I was expecting a hops blast from this beer, but I must have missed something somewhere. The predominant taste is malt, but not a chalky strong malt taste. This is a somewhat sweet caramel malt taste, very balanced and very nice. The mouthfeel is rich and smooth. I did not taste any raw alcohol at all. Left some moderate lacing on the glass. Knowing this was 7.2 ABV and served in a 22 oz. bottle, I would respect this and drink slowly. However I would have no problem accepting a second one. (48 oz of anything is about my sessions limit anyway) This is a very drinkable and tasty beer."
"Overall, a tasty brew, but I'm a little surprised at all the really high ratings. Basically this reminds me of an over-hopped Anchor Liberty Ale."
"drinkability - terrible. its a quality beer for sure, but just too relentlessly hoppy bitter. should maybe be called Bitter Bastard. certainly a must-try, but i dont think ill be having this again. unless you like the taste of metal, you probably wont take it past your first try. good for the experience though...what novice beerfan could resist that bottle's appeal?"
"I've resisted reviewing this beer in order to gain perspective over time and multiple bottles. This beer scared me at first, shocked me later. Finally, after multiple bombers of this over the last couple years, I've gained a real appreciation for this strange brew. It has a totally unique hop profile that jacks your veritable jaw with PINE hop flavor. The malt holds up to the immense hops with little problem. Very well rounded despite the earth-shaking hops and notable alcohol content."
"A dark amber color with a excellent creamy head. Strong hop aroma, from flowers to earthy scents. The first taste has a little bit of barley there, then BAM, the hops come right out and announce their presence. The mouthfeel is slightly rich, but is still very smooth going down, leaving a nice dry finish. Overall this beer backs up the label, AGGRESIVE, the intense hop flavor make this a must try beer."
"Defnitely a favorite."
"Poured from a 22oz. bomber with a nicely written label. Pours a rich dark cherry color that is amber at the edges. Thin off white head falls quickly to light lacing that sticks to the glass as I drink. Aroma is sweet and malty with some floral and citrus hoppy notes present as well. Smells of caramel/molasses and slight hints of alcohol sting the nose appropriately. Tastes rich and hoppy, nice malting holds it all together, very well balanced with a bit of a bite present in the tail from the 7.2% abv. Mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth and slick, goes down great with a perfectly matched level of carbonation making this brew very drinkable. Would definitely seek out again, very well done beer, I love it."
"This drinks a lot like a barleywine with a little less mouthfeel and sweetness. The hops play a lead role, but the subtle malt is still detectable and has quite a bit of complexity. A nice warming mid-winter brew for those of us who dont live in CAnow if we could just get our frostbitten little Michigan mitts on it on a regular basis!"
"A great offering from Stone!!!!"
"Poured from a bottle, this dark amber ale has a firm but lacy head that settles quickly. Hops dominate the aromy with citrus overtones. I loved the sweet upfront taste and the bitter bite of the aftertaste but the sustaining mouthfeel left me wanting more. A great bold flavor...just comes up a little short in body. Probably not a great session beer but well worth a taste."
"Decent drinkability for the abv, although as I mentioned before, very in-your-face, which I think hurts its drinkability somewhat.... call me a sissy if you wish =P"
"If you're used to drinking the common beers of the big 3 (Miller/Bud/Coors) don't try to broaden your experience with this stuff, because it will probably turn you off, but if you're reading this review, you'll be fine. Just below the ""Arrogant Bastard Ale"" on the bottle you see the quote ""You're Not Worthy"" and they were RIGHT. I was NOT worthy before I became a beer advocate."
"One of my absolute favorites, and not just because of the marketing (though I am a whore for Stone's attitude). Hopefully this will be available everywhere soon enough, converting the curious into the truly Arrogant."
"Quite carbonated. Nicely warming. ABV is apparent, but this is not the big scary beer it makes itself out to be. Next to a Big A IPA, for instance, it faints away. Still, it's one I drink on a fairly frequent basis. I ordered another one."
"First off I remember drinking this beer a few years ago before my love of beer began and thinking it was absolute rubbish, really disgusting. This is my dad's favorite beer and he always has a case of 22oz. bottles out in his beer fridge. After trying this again today, I am so glad I have the palate to appreciate what Stone is doing here. Poured into what Stone calls their ""Way Cool Glass""....it is pretty cool actually. A deep rich caramelized amber with a lingering sticky head and amazing staying power. Nose is very aromatic and complex with the expected sweet caramel malts and over the top hops, but unexpectedly a distinct fruity profile as well, strawberries? Taste is intense and as the label warns, not for the faint of heart or the macro swill drinking sissy....the over-the-top hop profile will definitely weed those folks out, however this is actually a fairly balanced recipe. The malts are very well done and full of sweetness which is present up-front and then are blown away by the fruit-juicy fresh hop taste and texture....only to come back again for the finish which leaves you smacking your lips with a slightly cloying sweetness. Really a complex and robust beer, worthy of the praise it recieves."
" I will continue to try the beers recommended by BA. This one was just not for me, yet."
"This poured a deep reddish-copper hue, with a clean, clear body. It had a small head which left very nice lacing about the glass. It's aroma about knocked me over; plenty of hops and sweet fruits, piney, caramel, roasted malts. The taste was much of the same, but balanced excellently, with a barrage of sweet caramel and roasted malts up front, fading into a spicy, bitter hop finish. I can not emphasize enough the complexity and balance of this beer. Since I had it in the larger bottle, and the ABV is decently high, AND the tastes are in your face, I wouldn't try to polish off more then one or two of these in one sitting. Plus, if you do, you're not savoring and enjoying this beer, which is exactly what you shuold do. Truly worthy of it's stellar rating."
"Pours with a short golden head that is well retained over time. The color is a deep copper/brown and the beer has good clarity. Nice lacing and plenty of active carbonation is noticible. The aroma is of grassy hops with a faint nuttiness, but it doesn't eminate too strongly. Strong hoppiness is tasted immdeiately, but wait, there is a nice carmel sweetness on top of it to balance it out. The finish is crisp and bitter, but not overdone. Mouthfeel is rich and full, with a good feeling of carbonation. Very well balanced, very drinkable unless you don't like bitterness. When its this good it's alright to be arrogant..."
"This wasn't my first one and it won't be my last, so it's pretty drinkable. I do usually tend to switch to something a little sweeter after one of these though. I think it's the cherry flavor that makes me want to go sweet after a pint of this."
"Somewhat drinkable beer in spite of the name. Don't be afraid, just a little skeptical. I've heard great things from Stone and this might be the first brew of theirs that I've had. I look forward to trying more from this brewery."
"D - I mark it down a bit here because 22 oz. of this mighty, hoppy beer was maybe a bit more than I wanted. I'm not quite the hophead as some others. I may be back for more, but probably not frequently."
"Beautiful ale, but any more than two & it's time for a nap!"
"A must for hop-heads!"
"Nothing special in the appearance. Dark amber, about a cm of head, lot's of lace. Faint hops with some complexity in the nose. This beer is all about the taste. I get immediate sweetness, good natural honey like sweetness. Then some citrus hop taste capped off by some intense hoppiness. It's the hops that make this beer. I don't know enough about hop types to distinguish the types, but I know that I like them. I like them a lot. No, No, I love them. This is an aggresive in your face, kick your ass beer. The strength and complexity of the taste actually hurts the drinkability, but I still recommend this for everyone to try. You may try it and love it, or you may hate it. But I think we can all conclude that Arrogant Bastard is truth in advertising."
"Arrogant Bastard is easily one of my favorite beers. When I realized I've never gotten around to writing a review, I thought it would be fitting that I'll most likely earn my mug with this review. This bastard is a deep amber. It has fairly good clarity and a thick tan head forms from the pour. The aroma is powerful, resplendent with piney hops and an overriding maltiness that seems easily to be the equal of the hops. The taste is a wonderfully complex interplay of malty sweetness and hoppy biterness. The hops provide a piney oiliness that coats the tongue and creates an almost mouth puckering effect. This is cut rather quickly by the huge malt base that exists and all of a sudden I can't figure out whether the overriding taste is bitter or sweet. During the swallow, the alcohol provides a bit of a burn down the throat and warms the stomach. This beer is truly an experience. The aftertaste, mostly hops, lasts well after the swallow due to the mouth coating feel of the beer. Very sticky and chewy. The drinkability isn't great due to the stickiness and intense flavors. The 22oz bottle is plenty. Still, it's a beer I would never turn down. I mentioned earlier, one of my favorites, the interplay bertween sweetness and bitterness is truly amazing."
"Taste: Hoppy with grape notes. I was really blown away with how good this beer tasted. I could have drank this all night but this is one of those beers that will creep up on you. Be careful if you are not drinking this at home."
"Drinkability  Its high ABV% makes it slightly less drinkable, but its complexity and taste make it super desirable."
"M&Dr - Mouthfeel is solid with perfect carbonation that is ever present like scrubbing bubbles, not harsh but smooth if you can believe. I can drink this until i fall like a fresh cut tree. Way to go Stone."
"""Thank you sir. May I have another!!!"""
"Drinkability: Hides the 7.2% abv well. I could easily imbibe several of these in an evening. Thoroughly pleasing, massively hospitable, and pure in its flavor and smell. A fine drinking engagement I would recommend to anyone who fancies a fine beer."
"Drinkability: Don't know how much of this I could drink in one night, but I would definetly come back to this beer in the future. It is a fine beer to sit back and watch football with."
"malty sweetness with a stinging carbonation and a hoppy, bitter aftertaste. taste not as balanced as the aroma. hops are a little too ""aggressive"" for me, as the label warns. guess i'm not worthy."
"Drinkability: In my opinion this is one of the most complex and tasty brews that's very widely available in the U.S. It can certainly kick your ass, so it's not something to mess around with, but with a good meal or as a sipper it's tough to beat this brew. I'd like to cellar some in the future to see what happens, and I certainly will eventually."
"Drinkability: Listed as an American Strong Ale, but what does that mean? This is a big dark ale, very hoppy and pleasing. So if the ASA designation is a catchall for strong ales that can't be pigeonholed, this is what I would want from one of those beers. Thanks to Px2Grafx."
"While it does a decent job of living up to its own self-professed aggression, it manages to still be a well-balanced, highly drinkable beer. Obviously not something I would drink all night (unless the ability to stand was not a priority) but...wow. I definitely want to get my hands on more of this."
"Drinkability: I should have bought the six-pack instead of just the bomber."
"I was expecting strong floral/ citrus hops (which I now love) and didn't quite get it. Worth a pint but not a 6er or case."
" This is a beer that is so meticulously crafted that it's brilliance makes it seem simple and is truly a satisfying drink. Maybe a bit too much alcohol and kamikaze hops for binging but I can attest that having one with lunch is close to nirvana."
"Notes: I've wanted to get my hands on some stone brews for a long time and finally did on a Thanksgiving trip to DC. Definitely enjoying this one."
"I don't think I'd be too interested in drinking multiple bottles of this in a row. It's just too rough, alcoholic, and pricey. And as far as I know, it only comes in 22 oz bottles."
"This beer feels good on the palate. It is a full bodied beer and feels heavy on the palate. The level of carbonation is low, which is in my opinion appropriate to the style. It is not a beer that can be chugged, rather it has to be drunk over time. Its a great brew to sit down and enjoy. This beer is really a gem, one of the best brews I have ever had, I'll always respect the bastard and will always find myself coming back to this brew again and again. It is definitely worth the money and a try. Go ahead and see if you're worthy."
"I cant wait to try this again!"
"Overall, Arrogant Bastard has lived up to the hype; it is one great and incredibly tasty beer. If only I could get it in Nebraska..."
"overall: absolutely wonderful asa. very near perfect in every way. excellent aroma and flavor. fruity, hoppy, bitter with just enough sweet to carry it through. one of my absolute favorites from stone."
"Notes: This was a great way to relieve some stress due to an extremely hectic week. Thank you Stone; keep up the good work."
"Like Samiclaus without the huge, kick-your-ass ABV. Absolutely a top ten beer. Hugely complex & near perfect balance. Drink it! Or quit drinking. Period."
"Note: Since it has been said a few times that this brew has a sweet after taste. I may try another. This may not have had proper storage and the gargoyle may have fail to ward off the bitterness."
"What an excellent creation Stone hath wrought!"
"I have had this beer bottled and enjoyed it immensely. I decided to hold off on the review until I could find it on tap. It pours a cloudy tan head with a deep amber color- with a tinge of orange. This beer smells bittersweet. It has a very deep floral scent and multiple layers of hops. The hops definitely do not match the color of the beer. The smell prepares you for the hoppy bang you get from your first sip. It has a fantastic kick on the back of the tongue with the malt gently balancing it at the tip of the tongue. The tongue is lightly coated before it kicks you. This is a very hoppy, very potent beer. I would only recommend this to people who love hops and would advise them not to rate any beers for awhile after having this one because the hops dominate your tastebuds for awhile."
"Dark auburn, with creamy tan diminishing head.Snekks if malt, hops, and a fruity tone. The taste is very malty with strong enough hops to balance the heavy malt and alcohol. Many things going on in this beer! Good Brew! I'm going to crack open one more. Same consistancy, this is good stuff. I don't think that I would be able to note the flavor or nose of another beer right after this one."
"Try it. Have an open mind and buy other beer just incase."
"Alcohol is present but not overbearing. The best strong ale I've ever had. This one will be residing in my fridge this winter!"
"Very pretty dark black strong ale from the fabled Stone line of brews. Smell is of currants, raisins, and alcohol. Taste is of dark chocolate, molasses, and more alcohol. VERY bitter, lingering aftertaste, which strikes down the drinkability. All in all a very, very nice brew in moderation..."
"Pours a dark brown color but is still translucent with minimal carbonation and a tan-colored head that has good retention and is rather thick. I detect a lot of malt, some yeast, and some dried fruit aromas. Very interesting and appealing. The taste is complex and rich with a hoppy bitterness upfront followed by a strong malt presence. A bit of warming alcohol sensation as well. The aftertaste is sour and lingers longer after each sip. A bit of astringent taste over time in the back of my throat. A very good beer that is enjoyable, but the aftertaste reduces the drinkability in my book. One of Stone's best brews."
"Drinkability: I thought it went down easy. Fans of hoppy, bitter neers may not enjoy this. It comes in large bottles (22oz) and is 7.2% abv so you might not want to drink too many at one sitting."
"Pours a dark ruby amber with good clarity. The dense, two finger head is tan in color, holds well, and leaves slight lacing. Fresh whole hops and roasted barley nose. Alcohol is present in the aroma and taste, but not in an estery or astringent way. Big toasted malt flavor upfront, followed by a very assertive herbal hop bitterness that will dry, then gracefully fade. A touch harsh towards the end, but the full body and low carbonation allow a slight residual sweetness from the malt that evens the bitter and dry hop finish. The abundance of hops and solid malt profile create an aggressive flavor that is not overwhelming, but perfectly balanced and deeply satisfying."
"Drinkability...well, this a huge beer, big alcohol content, really bitter. I am not worthy...of more than 2 or maybe 3 in a sitting."
"Overall = Definitely try it if you haven't. I wouldn't necessarily seek it out again but would certainly accept one if it came across my path."
"This beer has definetly brought beer to a new level and changed my whole way of thinking about beer. It's in my top three."
"Thanks to Px2GrafX for the bottle. Way past due that I finally tried this one."
"-UF"
"It may be an unpopular opinion, but this beer is a bit of smoke and mirrors I am afraid, or is it emperors new clothes?"
"D: I could drink this beer all day and all night long, until I dropped to the ground because I'm not worthy."
"Poured a very slightly hazy, reddish copper with a medium-sized, light tan, frothy, slowly diminishing head with a decent amount of complex lacing. The smell is a little odd, but in a good way. I guess I was expecting the heavier hop aromas (which are definitely there: herbal, juicy and piney) but I wasnt expecting such a huge malt presence. Its lightly medicinal without being off-putting. The taste is huge but excellently balanced. The chewy, sweet malts are counterbalanced by the stinging bitter hops wonderfully. I love the caramel flavor in there, and the finish is very long, very bitter and lightly astringent. It has a medium-full body, slightly oily texture and a soft carbonation. Very good all around. And I really enjoyed FINALLY getting to try this, thanks to Ds in Pittsburgh. The great balance and true arrogance of the beer make it quite memorable. Definitely worth seeking out."
"Drinkability is a little lower just because of the high alcohol content and the boldness of the brew.... a bomber will suffice in fact it was taking me a little while to finish the thing."
"Kudos to Stone for this fantastic and confident brew."
"This lives up to the excellent text on the back of the bomber. It's complex, and while I appreciate it, I don't see myself making this a real fridge regular. It's definitely got potential to compete with the IIPAs in my diet, though, and as a sort of indulgence to my inner geek, it succeeds quite well."
"drinkability: the 22 will go down fine, but anything after that would be overkill"
"D - This was a bomber split three ways, and that was more than enough. This is a very bold beer that doesn't need more than one serving to get it's point across."
"The ""Arrogance"" of the gargoyle who adorns the bottle, which I've had but not reviewed, and the tap handle is appropriate, and it's true throughout this beer. Not just the taste but everything that really goes along with this beer. Arrogant Bastard is not for everyone; it's probably too big to for many tastes. But I would recommend this to anyone. I like it a lot, but trying a beer of this nature, which has garnered a sort of mythical following, is worth trying for anyone."
"The only pretense to balance in this beer is that both the malt and hop bills are over-the-top!"
"Thank you Stone!"
"Deep red in colour with a lasting, slightly off white head. Fairly low carbonation. Lots of hoppy aroma to this one (grapefruit, pine, earth), although slightly more restrained than I had expected. For an ""aggressive"" beer, its actually fairly well balanced. Flavors of caramel malts, some minor roasted malt notes, more citric hop notes, and a bit of a tea-like tannic note too. Its bitter enough to balance everything out, but not over the top. A full bodied example of an American Strong Ale."
"A huge advantage to this one is the fact that you can buy it at damn near any convienience store on the west coast. Big up's to Stone for making that possible."
"This is a great beer. While I've had this on-tap many times, I've never actually bought a bottle of it before. I may have to do that more often."
"Pours a deep dark brownish-ruby. Offwhite head is thick at first but settles down after a few sips from the glass. Sweet aromas of cinnamon and caramel. Different taste than I expected after the smell. Hops dominate up front but are quickly rounded out by the sweet maltiness. Overall, a damn good brew. Many complexities and layers to this one, and at only $3 per deuce-deuce, I will be purchasing this one pretty frequently."
"Second half of this bomber now, and this is really beginning to grow on me. And to think, next year i'll have (i think) access to this in NC."
"a dark reddish brown ale, capped with a thick, frothy, sticky tan head that laces like some kind of goo. aroma contains maltiness, caramel, some toffee, and a faint smell of something that i can only describe as five-pound nutty christmas fruitcake. the taste is big, juicy and meaty wth bitter grapefruit rind hops asserting themselves after the creamy and caramelly malt blast with a slight tingle of warming alcohol at the end. got some bitterness in the aftertaste there, too. and it lingers, even after a bite of edam...the mouthfeel is rich, creamy and certainly big. this is one tough-ass brew, and it's almost overwhelming at times. i was in the mood for this today, but i'm not sure i'd go for it on a regular basis. nonetheless, top-notch stuff and absolutely worthy of such self-proclaimed arrogance."
"wow, this one is flavorful. lots and lots of hops thrown into what would normally be a very malty beer. i like that though, it's different. taste is pretty full, thick, and overwhelming. i'd suggest drinking only one in a sitting. well, when it comes to ales this one is indeed an arrogant bastard and only tolerable in small doses."
"Pours a dark amber/red color. An off white head rises and dissipates quickly but this beer leaves some of the stickiest lacing i've ever seen. Strong smell of hops but it is balanced with caramel malt smell. My initial taste impression was that this is too sweet but that quickly changed to WOW. What a great balance of powerful hops and huge malt taste. The bottle says that ""you are not worthy," i'm glad i didn't listen. Mouthfeel is nice with a smooth dry finish. The high ABV shows through slightly at the end. Moderate carbonation level that dosn't distract from enjoying the feel of this on the tongue. You certainly won't sit down and drink 3 or more of these in a sitting but i could enjoy one of these every night. I highly recomend."
"A definite recommended brew, but as far as the rule of ""Is it worth the money"" goes, this beer stays strictly as a ""Man, I really want a harsh Ale tonight"" beer, as it clocks in at $6 for a 22oz bottle."
" I very much enjoyed this beer and would definitely recommend this beer to anyone looking for a beer with a dominent flavor!!!"
"Opinion: OK, here is where it all comes down...what did I think of that all out assault on my face. For the record, I don't really care for really hoppy beers...especially heavy Chinook, which this beer reeks of. Even still, I have to keep trying them because I respect a well-made hoppy beer. I just don't brew any. This beer along with DFH 90min IPA are ones that I frequently enjoy because they are very well crafted beers. I would definitely recommend this beer, but don't expect to be able to taste anything with less than 50 IBU's after you drink this beer."
"This is a fierce ale. One to be treated with respect. I'll reach for Stone's IPA first but this is still an excellent beer. And I think my favorite part is the note on the bottle that reads ""Keep Refrigerated Numbskull!!"" Stone's sense of humor isn't necessarily a selling point, but it definitely adds to such good beer."
"This is my first beer from Stone Brewing, and I can say that I'm thoroughly impressed. I was able to pick up some of their IPA as well, and I now can't wait to try that."
"Brew Before Dishonour!"
"The beer is very full-bodied and rich. As much as I would like to make it a session beer (just split 6 bottles with my old man), be careful, this one is capable of knocking you on your ass!!! Great beer and I highly recommend this one to any BA who has never had it."
"Mouthfeel is chewy, smooth. Bitey after you take a sip. Drinkable for those who enjoy it, definitely. Awesome beer."
"Ok, this is hard to describe. I think the strength of the alcohol taste is masking some of what I was smelling. I was actually quite surprised that this is a 7.2 as I'd have put it around 8.5 based on the flavor. It's also slightly more bitter than I had anticipated, but not in a bad way, it fit's this beer perfectly as it goes down quite smooth and there is a nice light bite after gulping down. Lacing was all down the side of the glass. This baby is tasty (I wish I had bought a couple tonight instead of one), I'll look forward to some more of this one."
"I've had AB numerous times in the past, from bombers to 3-liter bottles to tap. This is the first time that I have gotten to sit infront of my computer, analyze it, and review it. It's a great beer that I will always seek out."
"Very drinkable... it takes time for your taste buds to decipher the complex flavours."
"This is a extrodarie beer. Pours a dark amber/red. Not much of a head and leaves a small trace of lacing. Scents of hops and malt in a sweet surrounding. Medium body with a great sweet taste with a little hop bite at the end. I really like this brew and would make a great session beer."
"I can definately drink more of this now than when I first started on my high quality beer path. Arrogant Bastard is necessary in ones beer resume... though I still think Bear Republic's Red Rocket ale is better."
"An extremely complex beer. Resinous, piney hops abound on both the nose and palate...but with a nice malt characteristic as well. A must-try. I'm feeling a little loose after the entire bomber...though the alcohol is not otherwise evident. This one sat in the 55 degree F cellar for slightly over two months after I purchased it. If hops are as good a preservative as I think they are, I'd like to be embalmed with this stuff when I kick the bucket."
"I really wish this were a little easier for me to get because this is a very drinkable beer. I haven't been let down by Stone yet..."
"Damn good beer. Go buy some, already!"
"22 oz. with no freshness date - served slightly chilled in an oversized wine glass. Pours a nice ruby brown that kinda looks like red wine when light shines through. It's topped with a thin tan head that leaves minimal lacing, but I was swirling it constantly, thus removing any possible lacing. Smells very fruity - pineapple juice, tropical hops, and some sweetness and bitterness. Tastes like pineapple and mango with piney and citric hops (predominantly grapefruit) that are very bitter but complement the flavors nicely. It has low to medium carbonation with a smooth body that is oh so thick and feels wonderful. This is a great beer for the price and a great beer in general."
"this is a visually stunning brew. it is dark red with a huge tan head that has great staying power and that tries to pull the sides of the glass down with it as it dissappears (great lacing). i put my nose to this one and things go south from there. i know everyone tends to like this one, but sorry folks, it smells and tastes an awful lot like grapefruit juice to me. i can taste and smell grain, citrus, and definitely hops but the malt is nearly invisible behind the gaggingly sharp bite of monstrous hops. i can tell from the mouthfeel that they did not spare the malt in manufacture. i appreciate that this could not be a cheap beer to manufacture, but i can't jump on the bandwagon with this one. it is all i can do to finish a whole bottle."
"The bottle poured a nice dark reddish brown witha monsterous head that lasted for ever. For a stong ale there was very little aroma that I got from it. What I did get was caramel/fruit punch aromas with very little hops. The taste was very sweet, also with the fruit punch and malts that ended up with the ever slight tangy-ness of hops. Slight alcohol presence in the end. The hops are there but not strong enough. The mouth feel was thick and creamy ( a high gravity) Overall Not a ""session beer"" but one to enjoy and move on."
"Thanks mtnlover for sending me this to try for my first time. I've been waiting a long time to get my hands on a bottle. This beer poured a deep amber color with a mocha colored head that stuck around and was very creamy. It almost looked like it had the consistencey of whipped cream. Yum. The nose has is slightly hoppy with a phenolic twist (slightly band-aid). It's a good aroma, I like it. The taste is malty sweet with a generous hop bite. The hop addition is just right. Good mouthfeel. Full bodied beer with moderate carbonation. This is a good drinkable beer. I can't wait to get my hands on some more of this. I highly recommend. As if its reputation doesn't speak for itself."
"I have eyed this beer for a while and almost bought it once, but finally decided to give it a try. I definitely wasn't let down. This Arrogant Bastard appeared as a three-finger tannish foamy headed beast atop a deep rich reddish brown beer. Aromas of hops--earthy and grassy--were detected along with a hint of cinnamon, brown sugar or possibly maple syrup. A caramel smooth sort of taste yields to quality savory hopping in the aftertaste. This was a smooth and balanced beer. The best I've had in a while."
"Poured a beautiful clear crimson brew with brown highlights and a sticky tan head that was very thick and left nice belgian lace on the pint glass. The aroma is of a nice mild yet spicy hop aroma which has tinges of pine but not much. The flavor is very nice as it begins with a smooth rich malty flavor that is a touch toasted but more carmelized which segues into a delcious hop flavor that combines the spiciness of the aroma hops with the grapefruity, sharp bitterness of high alpha hops and finshes in a lingering bitterness. Smooth bodied this beer is a pleasure to drink and the rich mouthfeel complements the hops but the high alcohol is hidden quite well until you stand up."
"My complaint with this beer was its mouthfeel. I liked the thickness, but it was too the syrupy nature of this brew is not a positive attribute. I recommend this strong ale but for the money there are many better options."
"D: I can understand why that this is a highly ranked beer, but I personally do not think highly of this beer."
"Finally, the Bastard on Red/White/Blue day! SOB!! No wonder everyone raves about it  EXCELLENT ale! What a great caramel brown pour with creamy, foamy ivory head  purrty lacing! What aroma, citrus, pine, malts. TASTY quaff, malty, earthy with just a light touch of floral  just right! Oh, the smooth , light carbed, full bodied  hiding that 7.2 % amazingly well. Oh, crap, only 1 bomber of it. Gots to have more!"
"Notes: Once again another winner from Stone Brewing. I get the sense that they trial run beers for years because when they release a beer it is refined. Winner. Very complex offering with a nice malt depth alongside bigtime overhopping. Although this is not a sessioner it recieves plenty of attention at this household."
"Pours a brown, almost ruby red, eggnog coloured head that sticks everywhere. Smells like sweet malt, but tempered with a floral hoppiness. Taste is sweet up front with a floral and citrusy hoppy middle, and a nice bitter finish. Very balanced beer, very full and a caramel maltiness thats very pleasant. Thanks DrJay."
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!"
"Drinkability: Very good and drinkable. This beer is much better than I expected, and I expect a lot from stone."
"Good stuff, but you'll only need one bottle."
"D: Very drinkable, but be forewarned; its 7.2% alcohol could definitely turn you into an arrogant bastard, if overdone."
"Good smooth mouthfeel, a bit of carbonation, and a whole lot of a punch for your tongue. Very easy to drink, despite the high alcohol. I'd love to sip this all day and get slowly buzzed. A real warmer but still refreshing on a hot day."
"I classify this as a very good, but just short of great beer. I may need a few more bombers before I can say for sure, but I think this will be put into light rotation for me."
"More bottles will be coming home with me in the future. This is only my second Stone brew, and I've been thoroughly impressed thus far."
"Smooth, silky drink that I will come back to again and again. Unfortunately as of now, I have to travel to find this beer. But it is well worth the trip."
"The malt bill seems characteristic of a bold Dopplebock, yet hopped with a ton of Chinook- much like an Imperial IPA. A monster yeast gives a complex and rich fruit flavor. It's not a sipper, but we won't be doing keg-stands with this one either. A beer that has won my respect, regardless what the bottle might say."
"I bought another bottle of this in Fayetteville, and upon another tasting, I've decided to up my ""taste"" rating from a 4 to a 4.5. Really fantastic taste, nicely balanced between hoppiness and sweet tartness. I only wish this stuff didn't cost six dollars a bottle, and I didn't have to drive forty-five minutes to get it."
"Youre Not Worthy..NO, really, youre NOT.."
"What a hopnose catchable at the start cause off a not overwelming head. Darkbrown beercolor and not 100% clear. Nose is just like a good bag of aromatic hops with litle caramellic and coffeenotes from malt that also must have been used but partly fermented cause an alcoholic hint is there. Taste is proving that malts have been used and raffined into alc and CO2. Roasty, coffee but missing some body before going into a good bitterness. Litle hanging but with this amount... wonderfull. As of course the mouthfeel of a brew like this is, warming and provoking in another sip! Good beer and wuld love to have another one..."
"Dark crimson which barely let any light through. Off-white lightly persistent head, very thin. Smells of baker's chocholate, caramel, and a bit of citrus. Malts and barley overwhelm the hops and the taste is almost like the smell. The hops made a strong impression on the finish. No discernable aftertaste and felt very full in the mouth although the carbonation could've been less aggressive. Don't drink too fast though or you'll forget what you were drinking by morning."
"I absolutely loved this beer. Pours dark brown with reddish highlights. Aroma of caramel, tonnes of hops, dark fruit and toastedness. Delicious beer - sweet, toasty, caramel, dark fruit, tremendous hop flavours. Full bodied, rich, and extremely complex. Hidden alcohol, and very drinkable. Full of flavour and definitely one of the best beers I've had."
"On the other hand, my wife hated it. As the label says, it's not for everyone."
"Poured out a dark ruby/brownish color with a good looking head. Left some lacing on the glass, but not that much. Smell was mostly hops, with a faint aroma of malts and a touch of barley. Taste was almost like the smell, but the malts made more of a difference. Hops explode on the palate at first with a heavy dose of malts and barley coming in the middle and balancing out everything. Hops linger in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was full bodied with a creamy texture, but the hops really linger for a long time. Not for the weak, that's for sure."
"This beer tastes great- lots of potential for cloying here but there is a significant bitterness and alcohol presence to save it. Those qualities from the aroma are here as well- the caramel comes out early but the fruit creeps in at the end and lingers with the very long hoppy finish. Very well put together."
" Alcoholic taste comming to the front after the taste buds throw in the towel (after the first pint) and the carbonation reduces. Keeps a medium mouthfeel till the end and although finish is dry the bitter Cascade hops give a good aftertaste inviting you back for more. So yummy that I may have 2 bottles tucked into my coffin. So hoppy and still drinkable! Hummm . . . wonder how it would work as imbalming fluid. Maybe a little note tied to the bomber saying: ""Here's to ME and more of Stone's Good Stuff"" Carpe Diem!"
"Overall: Like an American equivalent to the Belgian Dubbel with high alpha acid hops."
"Arrogant Bastard Ale is like a roller coaster ride. It pours a rich dark amber/copper with a one-finger (short lived) head. It's absolutely beautiful in a pint glass. It's aroma is a little on the light side, with an indistinguishable fruitiness. A sip yields a sharp hoppy bite right off the bat, yielding to double-strong coffee and banana, with an extremely dry finish. A good beer."
"Drinkability: smooth and easily drinkable"
"Much more drinkable than one would think for a beer that has a warning that it is not for the faint of heart. I could definitely throw back of a couple of these, enjoying them all the way down."
"Overall, very interesting and complex. Definitely aggressive and a little unrefined, though. Lacks the smoothness of some other of my favorite ales, but I think that's part of the draw here. On the 'must try' list."
"Drinkability- Was excited to try this brew for the first time and it held up pretty much to my expectation. I was expecting a bit more of a ""spiritual awakening"" from it, but, nonetheless, it still is an excellent brew that I'm sure I will be having again in the future. Pretty yummy concoction."
"strong but drinkable if you can take the bitter hops."
"Overall, this was an enjoyable beer, and I would pair it with heartier foods. It's a bold beer that will challenge your taste buds if you aren't really used to over-the-top hoppy beers."
"Taste: It came down like an easy drinking Barleywine, too, having the complexities I like, but with restrained cloyness and not too boozy, which gives this Beer extra drinkability points from me. It's malty, chewy and has a light, almost crack caramel flavor. The aftertaste is an interesting amalgam of sensations on my tongue; it's candi sweet on the tip, the bitterness bites you on the sides and on the gums, and the back is bone dry. Nothing takes command, nothing overpowers, no nerve endings get scrambled. I've scarcely encountered an american Beer over 7% with this much balance. I'd call it a ""complete"" Beer."
"Drinkability-Not necessarily a session beer but still a great beer"
"The taste is huge. Quite robust with a medium body. Finishes quite smooth for a strong beer. The flavor is complex, but not too overbearing. An aptly titled beverage. This is an arrogant bastard."
"Gargoyles abound in this brew. ""Yellow fizzy beer drinkers"" beware indeed."
"Overall: arrogant & bastard & good!"
"Not overly impressed with this beer. It has had such a large hype, but it falls short. Sure it is hoppy with lots of course rough hops that give way to a little fruityness and while I like the hop combo the much bragged about malt complexity it two dimensional, sweet caramel meets grain. The alcohol gives it a good body and rounds out the flavor of the malt but sip after sip the malt complexity is just not there and since they brag about it, points are shaven off the taste. I will have to try this again in the bottle as the keg may have diminished the taste to be fair. Still a nice beer and I could put a 22oz in my session any day."
"I haven't had this one in awhile and damn if it still kicks the tastebuds in the grill. Big, dark and very hoppy, this beer comes on strong but the real pleasure is the balance that exists in the main body. More than just a marketing ploy , AB is one bad mutha; shut your mouth."
"This beer will keep your house mates from ever raiding your cellar stash again !"
"Pours a deep ruby red with a 1 finger beige head that hung out for a while and has fantastic lace. Aroma of a slightly roasted sweeter malt with some fruit overtones followed by a slight hop spicyness. taste of a wonerfull roated sweet malt followed by all the fruits (cherries, raisins, plums) leaves a nice hop bitternesss in the mouth which balances out the high maltiness of it. A bit warming and alcoholic but the complex flavors help to hide it nicely. Medium carbonation, thick, and robust. Complex. A wonderful example of the style. Pick some up if you get the chance"
"Worth all the immense hype it gets? Nah. But it's a damn tasty beer."
"I really love this beer. The first time I tasted it, I knew I would enjoy this ale for many years to come. I really like crisp taste it has. Definitely a beer to enjoy after a long day. It goes well with chicken and buffalo wings. It's well worth the search for a store that carries it."
"The boulder-sized Stone is rolling down the hill in your direction and there's really nowhere to go. Arrogant Bastard will hit you straight in the tongue."
"Perhaps the prettiest beer I have seen - just a stunning deep cherry amber in color with a magnificent 2"" head of tight cream foam that clung like rings on a tree. Nose was of course hoppy with a sweet lightness to it - unusual for such a great visual. Hops right up front on the tongue, then flavors like bread and some sweetness. The term ""sweet bitter"" came to mind. The only drawback is a noticable chalky aftertaste I could really do without. A very enjoyable drink."
"My first Stone disappointment. This beer did not live up to its hype imo. Pours a ruby red color with darker auburn shades on the side. Sporadic light tan head holds for awhile. Decent lacing along the sides. Aroma is very bitter and sharp. Quite acidic as well. There's some alcohol notes in there too, which I liked. The flavors in this beer simply did not work together. A very sweet caramel/butterscotch taste comes at first but then is soon drowned out by an intensely bitter, slightly piney hoppiness. The hoppiness holds and brings some alcohol fusels in with it and then on the finish the malt comes back with a sickening cloying syrup texture. The finish is horrible. I feel like I need to wash my mouth out with water. This beer is on the thin side and the body can't hold the flavors together. It seems like Stone just threw a bunch of random ingredients into the kettle and this was the horrible result. They have so many good beers, I don't know what happened here."
"This is a beer lover's beer and like the bottle says, not for the faint of heart."
"This beer just kicks your palate's ass; puts it on one freakish rollercoaster that doesn't end till you surrender and quit drinking. The drinkability of this beer depends on how much your palate can take. This is definitely not a beer for a novice drinker."
"Vive La Stone!"
"This is a special occasion beer, for kicking back on a rainy night. I don't see myself having it very often but it will be high on my list."
"Slàinte!"
"Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer. The strong flavours and aromas make it quite distinctive, while the craftsmanship keeps it very balanced and sinfully easy to drink. Poured from a 22 oz brown bomber with no best before date."
"I'm not sure this beer lives up to the hype on the bottle, though. Sure, most people don't like strong beers like this, but I don't think it's any less palatable to a BMCer than a DFH 60 Minute or even a SNPA."
"Drinkability: Fantastic, I am 1/4 way through a pint, several satisfying burps and I am on the verge of being unable to type. Look for posts later."
"Dark amber with hint of red in color. Nice mocha colored head. Grapefruit scented aroma. Extremely creamy feel with a wonderful mix of citrus and pine hop flavor. Not as over the top as I was expecting. The hop flavors are there and are definitely dominant. But it is a very well balanced beer, with a strong malt base. As the beer finishes, the bitterness really pops out at you and then trails off with a lingering flora hop flavor on the tongue. Happily much better of a balanced beer than I was expecting."
"An excellent beer. Hard to describe...have one for yourself."
"Pours a cloudy ruby color into my pint glass. A fluffy, creamy dark tan head forms and remains for quite some time. Smells of sweet caramel and fruits. No real hoppiness registering on the nose. A strong sweet malt backbone is the base of this one. Its full of caramel and dark fruits. A citric hop bitterness hits hard next. The bitterness is lingering and stays with the pallate for some time. The alcohol makes sure its presence known towards the end. Mouthfeel is nice and thick, great for the style. I like this beer, not my favorite example of the style, I think I fell into the hype a little bit, but nonetheless a great beer. Thanks a lot to prostman for the trade."
"This beer is trully a different beast on tap than it is out of a bottle. The garnet color was offset well by a tannish head that stuck around quite awhile. While there's some balance, this beer is all about hops. A sip is like taking a bite out of a grapefruit. Great beer to sip, but one is enough."
"This is my first experience w/ this brew on tap and I am really glad Redbones had it in it's rotation...I am worthy indeed!"
"drinkability: excellent. For such an intense brew, it's easy to want more."
"How do you start with this beer. Deep mahogany with ruby highlights. Thin light brown head. Nose is dates and figs from the malt along with grapefruit orange with a mild doughy character. Great depth of flavor with layers of sweetness from the malt. It starts as candy, changes to the date/fig component and becomes spicy like a carrot cake after a while. Smooth mouth feel medium drinkability."
"--Joey"
"Huge frothy head crowns a nice brown pour and leaves lace all over my snifter. Smell is hoppy and alcoholic with some malt straining to sneak through. The taste is hoptacular, but it's balanced well by a malty sweetness and candied fruit taste. The sweetness hides the alcohol pretty well, and then a nice hop and caramel interplay starts on your tongue. Quite entertaining. I'd label this one as medium-to-full bodied, and the complexities really shine through as it warms up a bit. Not just a clever bit of marketing, this one kicks ass, like all the other Stone brews I've had."
"Pours a clear ruby with a mammoth and rocky off-white head. Leaves a foamy layer and very solid lacing on the sides of the glass. Smells thickly and sweetly malty, with strong piney hops and an undercurrent of grapefruits and slight banana-like tropical fruits. Smooth and quite creamy, with powerful and chewy resin-like pine flavors. The initial hop kick is followed-up with chunky sweet caramel malts, which are interwoven with the hop flavors through the drink. Chewy, smooth, and very satisfyingly creamy in the mouth. A really good American-style strong ale."
"I've now had this twice in my life (Christmas of 1997, right after it came out, and just now). Both times my impressions were the same, so I won't be having it again. Arrogance is a great marketing tool, I just wish they had a beer that was worth being arrogant about."
"Body: Crisp, surprisingly light mouthfeel."
"A beer to be reckoned with. I'll usually take a dare, and dares are rarely this pleasurable. Thanks to karst for the treat. Yee-oww!"
"I read the back label, and Stone made it a point to say that ""i probably wouldn't like this beer"". Well, i loved it, but i can see how the average macro drinker (the same macros that advertise ""say goodbye to aftertaste"" these days) would hate this brew with a wild passion. Strong, brutal, and arrogant. What a nice way to start off my experience with Stone."
"Caramel brown with a lush thick 4mm head that holds extremely well. A good tiny-bubbled lace is left on sides of glass. Malty-earthy smell--fairly non-descript--does have some buttery elements not diacetyl-ish though. The taste is a full-on malt assault and quite lovely. Has nuttiness of cashews or hazelnuts. There is little to no bitterness but it does finish slightly too syrupy and sticky. The mouthfeel is fuzzy and syruppy but still quite pleasant. AB on tap is too damn drinkable (7.2abv) --very smooth but maybe a little too sticky--so have water with it. Much better on-tap than in the bottle."
"I approached this beer, my first Stone, with trepidation: the cult of the bastard is strong on Beer Advocate. Happily, this is one beer that easily leaves up to the hype. The hops are well balanced by the malt, resulting in a beer that's accessible while packing a huge flavor. We're not worthy."
"Not particularly drinkable because of the harshness and the ""off balanced-ness"""
"Not nearly as hoppy as I had thought it would be. But this is a different beer, a better balanced beer, and truly a beer that everybody should try."
"So many beers... so little time. I'm surprised I hadn't reviewed this already (on second thought, I still have a 3 liter of this that has been stowed away for a year or so). Pours a deep copper color with a fluffy off-white head. Some caramel malt sweetness mixed with a tree bark-like earthiness with a lot of piney and citrusy hops in the aroma. Malty and hoppy, balanced rather nicely. The hopping is piney and aggressive and the malt comes across as caramelly, biscuity and a little sweet at times. I wonder how many times this beer has just bitch-slapped some die-hard SNPale Ale drinker in the face."
"All in all: very well done. I will be having it again soon."
"A smooth drinking session beer with 7.2%, another hit from Stone."
"Can't say too much about this beer--everything's been said. A kick-ass beer to say the least."
"Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable to those who appreciate it, and I certainly do. Given the ABV I had to deduct a point in the interest of my brain cells."
"Decanting my 22oz bomber reveals a cloudy deep red color brew. Pours with an honest two fingers of frothy head, leaving some nice lacing. Excellent head retention. Nice powerful smell. Hoppy characters dominate - plenty of citrous and pine, yet balanced with floral qualities. Some caramel and a dose of alcohol in the nose as well. Taste is oh-so-bold! Aggressive hop profile gives your tongue the boot, but is delicately balanced by sweet caramel and some smooth malt. Full mouthfeel leaves you satisfied. Finish is citrous and sweet at the same time, backed by warming alcohol. Cheers to Stone for quite the ale!"
"If aged & served well, this could easily be a straight 5 beer."
"If you don't like this beer, you are not worthy."
"Appearance is dark crimson. Head is light brown and ample. Many rings are left around the insides of my glass. The aroma is nicely hopped with a citrusy smell. A little pine smell is in the mix too. The taste is big on malts and hops. Very complex. Caramel malty sweetness is balanced by citrusy hops taste. Hop flavor lingers of the tongue long after a sip is finished. Arrogant Bastard's taste smooths out even more after it has warmed up a little. There is so much going on here it is hard to describe, but one thing is certain this is a world class beer. However, if you don't like west coast hopped beers, you probably won't like this. After loving this, I must now get my hands on some Double Bastard and Oaked Bastard."
"Good carbonation and a nice medium bodied ale!"
"Wow. I received this as a gift from an aunt Christmas '03, and have stored it since then, probably not as well as I should have. I decided to open it today. I could smell the hops when I opened the bottle. It reminded me of opening a sealed package of hop flowers at brew time. It poured a reddish brown color, with a perfect tan head. The head held till the end. Lacing means nothing to me, but if it did, this beer would be the definition of 'nice lacing'. This beer tastes great. It goes in smooth, and finishes with a dramatic hop bite. I sampled it at about 58°, and it popped. I think I will call that aunt, and tell her I love her. I can't wait to taste this fresh."
"Overall, the taste is nicely balanced, although more on the hoppy/bitter side than the malty side. Since I prefer a less-bitter brew, this is not a strong point for me. Mouthfeel is good, but there's a ""puckery"" quality to the beer that I do not find appealing. Overall, I'd rate this about 3.7 because I can tell it's a quality brew, but I won't buy it for myself again."
"22 ounce bottle. Mental note to not overly age the beer, it is nice, but nowhere as Arrogant as when sampled fresh."
"This brew is a dark copper color, nice bubbly tan head. Sheets of lace follow the brew down the glass. Sweet malt and floral hop scent. There is a sweet caramel front, which is pulverized by intense bitter hops. Some spicy alcohol tones. Med mouth. My friend brough this and the Ruination, and out of the two, id take the the IPA over this. Still damn good."
"Poors with a medium red-to-amber color, with a darker almost-tan foam. Not too carbonated, and the head doesn't linger long. The aroma was fairly malty, with a good hops edge to it. The taste, however, was much heavier on the hops than the maltiness, but both were present in good proportion. The result was fairly hoppy, but nothing like the typical highly-hopped-so-it's-almost-an-IPA we've all grown used to. The result is fairly smooth, with a nice touch of sweetness to round out the flavor. Very nice, and very drinkable---I'd probably drink more of this if I could actually get it easily in my area. Almost lives up to the hype."
"Drinkability/notes: A rich and elegant beer, to be consumed with reverence."
"It pours a clear amber beautiful tan head. The aroma is a very strong hop and malt smell. I love strong hop beers, and this one gives you the hops along with very complex flavors. This beer is not for people who don't like full flavor in their beers!"
"The taste was so dynamic I couldn't not give it a 5, along with the complexities of the mouthfeel as the brew is swished to different parts of the palate. Although I wanted another one immediately after finishing, the drinkability isn't quite perfect for such a heavy and complex brew, but it is damn near. I only wish I didn't have to order Stone brews off the internet to enjoy them from home."
"In terms of flavor, this isn't one to disappoint. There's huge flavor everywhere, delivering layers of potent taste. The hops are huge and completely dominating in the finish. The mouthfeel is a little bit harsh but still good."
"The ale poured a deep dark coppery color, with a creamy head. The aroma was earthy, in a good way. All good so far Now for the taste  Rich sweet toasty malt while at the same time I tasted the spicy hops. Definitely nice when both flavors come through at once, when one doesnt linger longer or overpower the other. Very rich in flavor, complex but very drinkable nothing bland about this brew. A definite beer to have on hand for any occasion."
"I wouldnt have too many, but drinkable nonetheless."
"Poured from the usual 22 oz bomber into an Arrogant Bastard flute-like glass. It has a nice creamy head that cascades beautifully down the sides. The color is a mild reddish amber with a very slight orange tint. The aroma on this beer is simply beautiful. Very sweet with an abundance of floral hoppiness and some earthy, pine scent from the hops as well. Very inviting. The flavor is splendid with a sweet hoppy bitterness from the start. It is very aggressive on the palate with the pine flavor of the hops leading the way. It is not offensive, but strong in a good way. The malt is very clean and crisp with notes of cherry, caramel and berries. The beer is very well hopped but it is not overdone. There is definately a great malt/hop balance that makes this beer splendid."
"Pours a clear dark copper/pale brown under a 1.5 finger off-white head that fades fairly quickly to slightly chunky film leaving some OK lace. The nose is flowery hops, mollified slightly by some sweet grain. The mouth is very prickly and fairly heavy, with asyrupy consistency I'm not sure I like. Pretty complex taste profile, with plum and grain prominent early, followed by lots of truly aggressive hops, coming on flowery, then coniferous, drowning out the malt and burying the fruit. The finish comes on espresso bitter, completing the survey of hops flavors. I'd say the arrogance is justified."
"Thanksgiving evening treat. A deep amber hue, with a thin and reserved tan head. On the nose are the ever-present left coast hops, some fresh fruit to include grapefruit, these are sinus-cleansing aromas. The taste is more of an experience  thick and chewy off the cuff, rich and massively hopped up; caramel and licorice are noted up front. The citrus hop offerings come to life as she warms, just a touch dry, the body is very sweet and oh so smooth; the palate is cleansed by this massive brew! In addition, some sugary and cotton candy tastings left to graze the palate, add some raisin and oak flavorings  yeah youll find them all. Roasted malts and were hops mentioned? A massive beer, a huge beer, and a dang fine creation to be savored by many!"
"Smell was dominated by the spicy hoppness with a clean citrus or pine like scent in there as well. Nice carmel sweetness of the malts as well even some toast or bread like scent. The taste was full of malt flavor right off the bat. Then the hops hit and mellows the sweetness. Its sort of a rough transition when I first had the hop taste but it mellows and adds a degree of complexity to the beer that is amazing. This beer was very complex and full of flavor and body. Just hope I can find some more."
"As an addendum, the intensity of the hops seemed to have a negative effect on my well-being the next day. It's different than a ""hang-over"" from the alcohol. I've had it with other highly hopped beers before, but this one seemed the worst."
"The beer has a nice head, a rather unusual shade of yellow - almost like a butterfinger bar, and it looks particularly striking over the very dark shade of amber for the beer itself. The head lasts and subsides lightly. The aroma features a heavy dose of malt along with some caramel notes and a slightly cooked syrup note - strangely I had trouble detecting much in the way of esters or hops. But flavorwise, I get a great thick maltiness coupled with a huge hop flavor, and a great complexity with nuances of cherry, chocolate, and toffee blending with clear malt presence and sharp bitterness. Again, though, the beer surprises me because I don't get quite a strike of bitterness at the end - overall the flavor is much more balanced and the hops seem more for flavor than bitterness. Awesome!!"
"Still, pretty smooth on the palate. Each sip gives you a nice little warm buzz in the stomach, and I could imagine how this on-tap would get really addictive. I'll stick with it fresh though, thanks."
"This beer is quite different out of the bottle than it is on tap, so I feel compelled to write about it again. Comes only in a 22oz bomber. It pours a dark amber color with a large white head that doesn't ever go away and leaves lots of pretty lacing on the glass. The aroma is very strong with the pine hops, but has a caramel malt backing it up. The flavor is much more 'arrogant' from the bottle than from the tap. Less smooth. Very aggressive hop flavor that masks most of the malts. It's still really good, but if you can get this on tap, try that version."
"This beer is heavy. The head is quite thick and tan and stays for the whole pint. The beer is a dark red. Smell is fruity with lots of biscuit and toast. The beer is very malty. I would say that the hops are almost subdued, a nice change for a Stone Beer. There are hints of berries and slight dry wine characteristics. Mouthfeel is very chewy and a bit sticky. Drinkability, we'll just say pace yourself."
"Good beer, no kidding. Get it."
"-Oelergud"
"Medium bodied, with smooth light carbonation and a sweet caramel and raisin taste with some alcohol apparent. At first, the hop bitterness is subdued, keeping the pleasing brown ale-like maltiness at the forefront. As it goes, the hops become more intense, floral slightly, citric and piney. It gets harsher and more aggressive, finishing with an easy-going rasin and a lingering piney bitterness around the edges. Really a beautiful ale, all malt and hops, almost a defintion of what American microbrewing is about. Lovely."
"Big sweet malt flavors up front. Pineapple and candied fruit set against a caramelly background. Huge hops come in midway to balance out the sweetness. Pine resin with deliciously spicy notes. Finish is bitter, with lingering sweetness. Big, bold body; chewy feel. It might destroy my palate (even though I think Im worthy), but I dont care. One of my favorites or one of my favorite styles."
"Found this on tap here in Lexington. What a treat. The beer was a deep ruby red color, with a 1.5 finger of headThe nose is very sweet grapefruit hops dipped in caramel. The flavor is sweet, very mellow hops that linger. The hop is nicely citrus. The feel is thick and the drinkability is not to be topped. What an easy drinking beer. I love it. Always have, always will."
"What a great drinking beer to review for my 50th one."
"Purs a deep auburn brown witha thich tan head. Great lacing. Smells very piney and fruity. Tastes ridiculously hoppy with a nice caramel taste coming through. Very great tasting. My taste buds experience an absolute overload. What am I tasting? Thank you Stone for making this amazing beer. The statement on the back of the bottle says it all. Definitly one of the best beers I've had to date. Keeps coming up with new flavors the further I get down the beer. Amazing. Highly recommended. I've heard so much about this brew, finally got to try it, and it's definitly worth the hype."
"Yes, I proclaim it ""good""....and will merely melt and luxuriate at the rest of the consumption of this rare delicacy...I envy you Cali types who can snort this back with the ease of an ordinary day...."
"Mouthfeel was fine though not outstanding. There was a pleasant overall smoothness to the brew that was quite enjoyable. Drinkability was very high - now that I've tasted this Arrogant Bastard I'm going to make sure there's always one in the back of my fridge waiting for a good friend who appreciates good beer."
"Clean with good carbonation; tickling but not overbearing. An easy ale to dring with a great mouth and a top-notch nose."
"Drinkability: If for nothing more than people asking, ""What is that?," replying, ""Arrogant Batard," and then the inevitable, ""No way!," this beer is certainly worth drinking. On top of the fact that people think I'm crazy, the brew is delicious."
"In terms of taste, this one falls somewhere between a barelywine and an IPA. No real unusual or extraordinary tastes for the style of beer that it is. It is just a fine example of a hoppy American Microbrew."
"10-25-04 -- Re-reviewed after tasting this on draft at O'Brien's in San Diego last week. Just a totally different beer, even better. Hints of maple and a little whiskey peatiness come through. Hops and malt seem even better balanced. Fan-friggin-tastic."
"It poured a great clear amber with a nice tan head. The aroma was very strong and consisted of hops over burnt malt, it was simple but effective. It had a strong hop taste with burnt malt in the background. The feel was oily with an extremly dry finish. I happened to be in Irvine for a few days and decided to take the opportunity to find an AB and sample it. I found mine at the Yardhouse, and it was worth the effort. The beer definately was well put together and would be a hallmark for it's style. The amount of hops would always put this on my alternate list though."
"Sip and chug your way through 2/3 of a bomber, then kick back and let it warm up. As it warms up you should find yourself contemplating all the naughty things you want to do to satisfy your lover. Sip the last third of this brew saying those things with your eyes. This is a McNasty beer that will have it's way with you, and you should share that feeling."
"Definitely not a beer for the general masses, but what do they know, I love this stuff. Pours out a clear chestnut hue, a rich garnet when held to the light, damn sexy! Thick creamy off-white head, impressive retention with a tight cap almost all the way down. A tight wall of lacing also forms down the glass. The nose starts off with intense grapefruit rind hops, the malt gasps for breath as it quickly surfaces, only to be drowned in the hop goodness once again. Almost a bready malt presence, as fleeting as it is. The flavour is initially a smack-down of intense hops and grains, wrasslin' with one another, and you get so caught up in the action, it becomes pointless and far too distracting to begin breaking down the action into an anal play-by-play, you are simply swept along for the ride. A rich meaty malt becomes more apparent as the beer warms up, nearly toasted and caramel, making the gladiators easier to distinguish. Farther down the glass the flavour becomes more complex, but you get so caught up in the action that it takes a micro-biologist to create a spread-sheet for you to break down all the subtle moves and combinations into a discernable mode of operation. After a quick glance at the spread-sheet you are impressed, but proceed to throw it over your shoulder, in order to fully appreciate what is going on without being beaten over the head with the details. The flavour is duelling it out enough as it is. The mouthfeel is rich and velvety, and very inviting considering the extremes of the flavour, a plush welcome mat that you want to use as a bath towel after stepping out of the hot tub with a few frisky members of your preferred gender of attraction. I want more of this stuff, and I want it now, I was a total mud-skipping retard for only grabbing one bottle of this in my travels. Like that annoying dog in the Taco Bell commercials, it's time to make a run for the border. I'll pay the duty required for a box of this stuff--gimme, gimme, gimme!"
"The mouthfeel is just the way I like it. Wonderfully smooth body with just the right about of carbonation so it goes down easy. Drinkability is good on this one as well...I could see myself having a few Bastards with no problem! I only wish Stone was available in Illinois...arghhh!! A great ale that I hope I will have the chance to indulge in many times in the future. Muchas gracias to blitheringidiot for the opportunity to prove myself worthy."
"Smooth silky mouthfeel with excellent low carbonation, which seems to suit this beer perfectly. This is a very easy beer to drink and is enjoyable from start to finish. Glad I finally got my hands one!"
"Edit: I've since changed my mind about the Bastard. It's bumped up from ""good beer"" to ""kick ass beer"". I think maybe I was looking for some sort of crazy intense taste when I tried it the first time and therefore overlooked the fact that this is an incredible awesomely balanced beer, with a bite. And I definately do crave it frequently, in contradiction to what the original review says. Go git it!"
"An excellent beer to server with meals."
"This is a powerful brew and a joy to drink. For me, it a beer to enjoy occasionally but one I look forward to savoring. The magnum hops are a delight for the hop lovers. The aroma was rich and pungent. The malty background is smooth. The head was minimal. The color was warm brown and inviting."
"Drinkability is low, by design I think, there's a lot to this beer, and most of it is in your face."
"Stone could pee in a bottle, hop it up and I would probably drink it. Their beer are nothing if not extraordinary. Read the bottle first, the copy sends shivers of apprehension up your spine-Am I worthy? As it turns out, yes! Pours a beautiful garnet color with a lingering head and tons of lacing on my goblet. Malt and hops fight it out for the nose. An immediate punch in the mouth of hops. Raisens, moist fruit cake, port? Very complex and intense. I savored every drop. Like all dank beers, it should be drank cellar temp. I have a few of em stashed in the cellar, can't wait to see what time does to this Stone potion!"
"This was my first Stone beer and I finally understand all of the comments about how extreme they are. From a 22 oz. bomber bottle, it poured a beautiful mahogany color (one of the best looking colors I've seen), very clear, with a small head that remained in some capacity throughout the drink and left nice lacing as I drank. From the fridge, the aroma was slightly sweet with a big citrus punch and the smell of new carpeting (anyone else get that - beermail me). As it warmed, more malty aromas became evident - raisins, brown sugar, fresh bread. The taste at first nearly knocked me on my ass. I wasn't ready (and mabye ""not worthy"" as the bottle suggests) for what I experienced. The first taste started out slightly sweet and all of a sudden, my tongue was blasted with a bitterness I've never experienced before; it stayed with me for longer than any other bitter taste in my life. Cold from the fridge, this thing is a hop monster and seemingly nearly out of balance. As it warms, it really starts to come to life though. It gets sweeter and fruitier and either the bitter hops begin to fade or you just get used to the punch they pack... I'm still not sure. Either way, this is a very complex and balanced (but to the extreme) beer. Mouthfeel is medium carbonation, medium bodied, smooth and creamy - really nice. I knocked it down a notch on drinkability because the flavors are so extreme that it can be challenging to drink and the high ABV starts warming you up pretty quickly. I drank the second part of this bomber alongside a bowl of really spicy, cajun (no tomatoes) jambalaya which contained andouille sausage, chicken, peppers and onions, drenched in hot sauce and it stood up to it and complimented it extremely well. This beer would be great alongside any big flavor foods."
"Pours a beautiful amber copper color witha nice perfectly formed head with great retention and then to top it off great lacing. The smell comes in big with malty sweetness and a big citrusy hops aroma. The taste is also big with malty sweetness and citrusy hops with a hint of rasins from the special B malt that I think they probably use. The mouthfeel is pure bliss for big beer/big hops lovers. I could drink these all day, or at least until I passed out. Did I mention that I love this beer? I highly recommend it to anyone that hasn't tried it."
"Alcohol is well hidden, until you finish the bottle. :-)"
"This beer pours a deep mahogany color with a hearty, tan-colored head. The head tenaciously clings to every inch of the glass. The aroma is reminiscent of warm pumpernickel bread ... and a good bit of honey. A stout flavor, with strong overtones of yeast and hops. Just the right amount of smooth and creamy. A very hearty, well-made ale. I quite enjoyed it. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys darker beer."
"Edited on 3/20/2015.  Dropped the rating from 4.82 to 4.31 after having it again recently."
"Overall impression: If you love high alcohol, heavily hopped beers, this is for you."
"Bottle: Poured a deep opaque brown colored beer with a medium head with standard retention. Aroma is very powerful and consist mostly of what I think to be hops, a sweet and bitter type of hops though. Taste is quite unique for me (I think this is my first foray into the strong American Ale type) and consist mostly of some strong bitter hops and underline by some very subtle sweetness. Wow, this is like being hit on the head with a brick  plainly lots of malt and hops are included in here. The alcohol is a subtle but complement very well."
"drinkability, I'm not sure?,... It IS a class act, but I don't think, I could put down too many of these, but just to sip a couple, is an experience you should not miss!!! excellent!"
"Keep it up Stone."
"If that doesn't give you an idea of this beer... I'll continue. Aggressive, wonderful, hoppy, spicy, caramel, creamy, fruity at times, alcohol comes through just a little bit. Stone Brewery is a godsend."
"Bastard pours a rich redish brown color and makes a thick offwhite head. Head retention is great and laces the glass nicely all the way down. Smell is rich and inviting. Heavily roasted and malty aromatics fill my nose. Flavor opens up bitter and spicy, and then the rich and roasted character appears again with a nice layering of hop flavor and finishes with a malty sweetness. This beer is so unique, the flavor profile is really unlike any other beer I have ever tried. Mouthfeel is medium to full and leaves a slight sticky coating on the throat, warming as it goes down. Arrogant Bastard is incredibly tasty, drinkable and in my opinion a nice session beer... cause frankly you can't drink much else after the havok this wreaks on your pallate."
"Dark ruby red color. Made me think of blood for some reason. Wonderfully sweet, fruity smell. Sweet beginning rapidly becomes an intense (but not too intense) bitterness. Nicely balanced. This place had a great selection of beer on tap, but I every time I looked the beer list over, I found myself ordering another Bastard. Goes down very easily. Maybe due to the slightly lower ABV for a IIPA? Hope it is as good in bottles."
"Still the same amber darkness with a tight tannish-colored head. Aromas are complex. Lots of hop notes with a firmly established malt base. This carries into the flavor. At first the hops lie dormant, lulling you into a false sense of security. But they quickly rise up and pounce upon your unsuspecting palate. This hop bitterness isn't going anywhere and it stays entrenched on your palate all the way through the finish. Delightful. Excellent mouthfeel and carbonation. A fixture for me from now on whenever I visit the Ale House(s)."
"Deep dark red with a creamy tan head and a mild hoppy smell. A very smooth and well balanced beer though somewhat on the hoppy side - tart citrusy taste and hops you can really notice, but then again it's also got a notcieable sweet and malty flavor. This beer goes down really, really easy with a clean crisp finish. I would probably go so far as to say the Arrogant Bastard is the Great Wallenda of balanced ales (well, before his tragic end anyway.) Super refreshing, I don't think it's as strong with the hops as some people, maybe it was the tap, or the beers I had beforehand...."
"Very enjoyable beer overall. Heavy on the hops, with just enough malt to balance it out."
"Nirvana. Pure and simple. This wondrous beer pours out a deep, cloudy, reddish-brown with a decent head of almond color. The bottle alone is worth commenting on. Etched glass instead of the typical stick-on label. This is a collector's item bottle. The smell is strong with tons of sweet malt and maybe some honey. Quite nice. Taste is a complex mixture of overwhelming malty sweetness that is quickly extinguished by a huge bitterness. The finish is strongly bitter and fairly dry. The bitterness lasts several minutes beyond your most recent swallow... if you can wait that long that is! Mouthfeel is exactly what I like... it is something akin to eating a sandwhich. Carbonated to just the right amount...not even close to flat, but definitely not overly carbonated. This is not your average beer by a far stretch. I actually attempted to homebrew a batch of beer that tasted fairly similar to Arrogant Bastard. The difference? Stone Brewery got it right and I really screwed it up! This is one for the books... drink it alone, with friends, at a movie, in the park... you can't go wrong with this one. But a word of caution... this isn't for everyone (just like the bottle says). You really have to like high ABV, extremely bitter beers to venture into this territory!"
"This brew is so thick and rich and chewy... I can see how it led up to the Double Bastard, which I still like better. The whisky taste is appropriate for the style I suppose, though not exactly to my taste. I had the Oaked Bastard at the Real Ale festival and didn't like it, and perhaps part of it was because it was so unexpected. Overall one of the best beers I've had from a bottle."
"Drinkability: I don't think that this beer was designed to have more than one or two."
"Honestly, it's hard for me to compare this beer to anything else. It's in a category by itself. Highly recommended for those who love highly hopped beer with balls."
"This is a big bruiser of a beer. Everything about it is upfront and in your face. It has a nice three-way balance between the hops, malt and booze, which to me are all at their maximum for a drinkable (as opposed to sippable) beer. A little more of any one, and I'd have to slow way down. My highly subjective impression is that none of the elements (hops, malt, booze) seem integrated into the other elements, but rather are simply opposed to each other in near-perfect balance -- or as if all three were trying to get through a doorway at once and were hindering each other's prgress. Or maybe it's just the booze talking. Or maybe it's true -- I'm not worthy! Man, now I need another one of these."
"Beer is good. Happy Arrogant beering."
"Wyll-"
"Second bottle, from francisweizen, amazing yet again, the smell is amazing, thick sticky hops and a malty alcohol body, brilliant"
"I thought my taste buds had changed enough to enjoy this, but I was wrong. Pure hoppy bitterness through and through. Some candied fruit/grapefruit emerge 3/4 of the way through, but it's too little too late."
"I was just going to give this a 4.0 for looks, then I took the bottle into consideration."
"The aroma is subtle and hard to pinpoint, but is very pleasant. The first taste, full of creamy foam is wonderful. The abv is somewhat apparent throughout with a strong alcohol flavor, but definitely not overwhelming. The mouthfeel is tingly on the roof of the mouth with ample carbonation and hop flavor. This is a very drinkable beer and is not for everyone, like the label says, ""You are not worthy""."
"A real nice beer! As I stated earlier, I'm really starting to like these beers. After having an Old Woody (thnks to Weefishheads), and trying a Batch 6000 a few weeks ago, I'm starting to favor this style more and more."
"the review characteristics have been adjusted up by 0.5 for appearance, smell, and drinkability to reflect and average of the two serving types. basing this only on my bottle review, im sure there would have been a 5 or two in there."
"This is my first sample of anything from Stone Brewing. Nothing else I have ever had tastes quite like this.Very, very hoppy, and being that I am not a hop fan, I did not care for that taste like I thought that I would. Poured a dark garnet copper red colour with a dirty sand-like head. The head faded away to a thin film quickly. The smell is a little sweet, a bit fruit, date or raisin like actually, and definately complex. The texture of the taste is very smooth and almost silky. This stuff was way too grassy for me, with a tiny bit of caramel, as well. It leaves a very faint chocolate like after-taste about a second or two after you take a sip. I wasn't quite as impressed as I thought I would be."
"This is a highly recommended beer that I would probably buy more if I could get it easier. Picked this one up at Kclingers in Hanover. And it is not sold in Maryland where I buy nearly all of my beers. Hopefuly I might catch this one on hand pump at kclingers someday. I think it would be terrific served that way mellowed out just a little bit."
"Had this on tap at Dr. Dremos. I will mainly just comment on the differences in experience from having this in the bottle. This one came a deep crimson red with a medium to small head that dissipates fairly quickly. Aroma of hops, mainly citrus and a nice malt sweetness to round it out, more so than I remember from the bottle. The taste seems much more smooth and less rough. The hops make them selves known but are not as sharp as the bottle. The malts blend well and made for an overall smoother taste. Full bodied and more drinkable on tap. Great all around beer and even got my girlfriend drinking it."
"Very smooth. Heavy feel in the mouth. Served in a 22oz bottle. I asked for a glass but it never arrived. Nicely rounded hoppy flavor balanced with the malts and fruity undertones. The carbonation was perfect--accentated the flavor on the tongue but you never noticed the bubbling. Best served relatively cold. I noticed as I kept drinking and the beer was warming some of the taste was lost."
"A very fine ale. This pours a very dark amber color. There is a wonderful brown foamy head whic lasts. The tase is indeed complex but pleasant. There is a caramel/coffee malty sweetness, nice balanced with a hoppy bitterness. Thick on the tongue. Definitely buy a bottle and check it out. You won't regret the adventure."
"The drinkabilty was great for such a huge, uncompromising beer."
"A very nicely balanced beer, for sure... really an excellent and quaffable ale. But I'm downgrading it to ""Self-Confident Tough Guy With a Soft Spot For Kittens""."
"Dark amber colour with a tan head which takes a while to fade. Smells of hops with a slight citrus backing. Hops dominate upon the first sip. Carmal malt flavors keep the balance. All kinds of stuff going on in my mouth right now. Hard to sort it all out. Even thought the hops are dominate, I have to say that its the malt that carries this brew. Pretty heavy in the mouthfeel department. Two bombers are more than enough."
"Wow. I think it's actually more of a barleywine than an ale, but whatever it is, it is one tasty mofo. Don't know what's up with the whole Iron Maiden motif, but it's a great beer, I'll be back."
"Overall Impression: Extremely enjoyable. I may have to learn to age a few bottles to see if they mellow out to where the kegs seem to be. Where the bottles seem like a full frontal assault on every sensory organ you own, this is more of a controlled takeover, an authoritative, methodical full Swedish massage of every sensory organ you own. If you know the Bastard and you see him on tap, pay a visit. Strongly recommended"
"Served on draught, I was presented with a very dark red mahogany brew with a thin creamy head that clings to the glass all the way to the bottom. The nose did not impress me as much as the toasted malty flavor. The balance of malts to hops was nicely done with just enough bittering bite on the tongue to keep it interesting. The alcohol taste didn't hint to the 7.1%. If you want this as a session beer it will be a short night."
"If beer was wine, I'd classify this as a port. Something to be sipped slowly, savored after a gourmet meal, but this is not a thirst-quencher you'd slug down. Frat boys with bongs need not apply. Certainly a beer to include in your regular rotation. I'll be reviewing it again in the future."
"The beer pours a dark ruby red color with a thick off-white head that slowly fades. The aroma is great! It has a rich malt scent which is enhanced with the presence of beautiful citrous hops. The taste is good. It has a complex malt core which gives it a dark, yet very bitter flavor along with some intense flavoring hops. This brew is truely fantastic. It goes down easy and has a lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great sessions brew. It has great flavor; a good drinker."
"Awesome brew, I'm sure there's things I'm missing, but this is really top notch."
"Presented in a 22oz bottle with quite a humorous description on the backside and a cool pic on the front, all painted label. Poured a deep, dark ruby brown color with two finger off white head. Pretty good retention on the head and leaving sticky lace. Aroma is spicy citrusy hops, sweet fruit, with a background of chocolate maltiness - really a pleasant unique aroma. Taste starts as a malty cocoa, toasted grain flavor, and finishes with a really spicy kick from the hops and a bitter, warming alcohol effect at the very end. Excellent beer, and still very drinkable despite the aggresiveness that the back label describes. While it is aggressive, if you like a hopped up strong ale this can't be beat. Very balanced and unique."
"My first (and currently only) Arogant Bastard Ale. Pours a dark, cloudy mahogany with small head and medium lacing. The smell is overpowering Hops - piney, citrus Malts - sweet, smokey, dark ripe fruits, etc.... Man, a little bit (or a big bit) of everything in this here beer. The taste knocked me on my ass... I really mean that. At 7.2% this is a serious brew but man the deep chestnuts, smokiness, ripe fruit, pine, citrus... very serious brew. The initial taste reminded me of another brew ""Black Douglas"" which is actually a Scotch brew where the alcohol was very prevalent, but the malty sweetness really balanced it out --- the big difference with this brew was the intense hop bitterness that just kept on coming but never overpowered the other flavors. This is no hype, no lie, on my top 5 of best all around brews. I think a case of bombers is warranted... and just think, I've still got Double Bastard hanging out in the cellar.... sweet! One last thing -- for all this beer is offering it's still drinkable... no poundable, but definitely more than one if you're lucky enough to find singles."
"Wow, what a beauty of a beer right out of the gate! Pretty mahogany with bright orange and ruby hues. The head lays thick, and creamy, unflinching, begging to be tasted. The stick is solid all the way. A complex aromatic brew featuring sweet, grainy, breadlike aromas followed by inticing hop bitter. In the mouth this baby is thick and rich, bordering syrupy. A taste delight, once past the lips, the beer drips with flavor-toasty malt, a wonderfull fruitiness mid-palate adds a kiss of sweetness. A well balanced, while never delicate brew. A twangy, peppery, highly assertive hop bitter prevails on the mile long finish. A mouthfull of un-apologetic goodness, and a great way to cap off a fine day off here in Chicago, courtesy of the downright, upright, Jackndan! Thanks for the treat my friend!!"
"Love the ""You're not Worthy"" story on the bottle. Pours a nice copper color with beautiful lacing of the head. The smell of hops is overwhelming, but not in a bad way, very balanced and enticing. On first taste the hops assault your tongue awakening your taste buds for the rest of the glass. Finishes with hops lingering in your mouth. The beer has lived up to hype and is worth seeking out if you can't get it locally. The intersting thing is the beer seems to change as it gets warmer, the hops almost seperate themselves into different flavor categories as the temperature increases. It would be an interesting test to blind taste the beer at 40 degrees and at 50 degrees to see if anyone could tell if it was the same beer."
"Comments: A wonderful elixer, deserving of its hype, and perfectly drinkable. I was surprised by the aggressive hop character, and expected a more assertive malt presence for what is classified as a strong old ale. But, certainly not disappointed in this modern American classic. Wish I had a few cases of this in the cellar!"
"It is fruity and smooth in the mouth but that bitterness lingers. It is full-bodied and good from first sip to last drop. And Stone was right, ""I am not worthy."""
"I feel like a crack addict. I know that Arrogant is on tap not even 2 miles from my house. Arrogant is so good that I had to hide my wallet and car keys in order to avoid a bender. I have thought about walking, and would have been down at the bar drinking, instead of writing a review, except for the alligator filled moat that I built to keep my butt at my house, and not down at the bar."
"I'm not sure my palate is advanced enough to decipher all the flavors that were blasting my tongue when I tasted this beer. There was sweetness, hoppiness, and a wonderful mix of flavor. It's definitely worth drinking once but I don't know if I'd make a night of it. Great beer overall."
"Pours a reddish brown with a billous head that never went away. beautiful lacing to the finish. Aroma of hops and a roated malt that is oh so inviting. Although it has a high ABV content I never felt this got in the way of the superb rich malt that receed for a while to be replace by the hop flavoring only to give way again for more rich malt. Defintely one of the best of it's style. As this will now be distributed locally, I am looking forward to enjoying it when the mood strikes me to just relax and take some time to enjoy a really great brew."
"Love Stone. The label is just so much fun on this bottle, I mean, how can you not love a good beer that insults ya? Pours a nice reddish brown with a thin caramel colored head that is very light in froth and not too much retention. Lightly hop scented and light carbination. Very hoppy beer with good bitterness. Tastes of toffee and caramel, burnt toast, little bit of licorish. Very hoppy and great tasting beer. Good and strong and full of flavor like i like 'em! May not be a good session beer due to the 7.2%, but wonderful and a good staple in my home!"
"Poured into a tumbler from a 22oz bottle, the beer developed a fair and retentive head. The deep reddish brown liquid is quite enticing. The aroma is dominated by the intense hops, with strong citrus notes - grapefruit, and hints of pine. The taste is surprisingly well balanced. There is a big malt presence which is almost bigger than the unquestionably intense hops. The flavors roll between caramel and grapefruit. The beer was well bodied, and quite drinkable - but not exactly, a session brew."
"I can drink this, maybe I just grew to like Hop Monsters? Who Knows?"
"Overall a great beer, and I was not disappointed by the hype, it doesn't make the top of my list but I would definitely drink it again, whether on tap or not. Its not distributed in MD so its hard for me to get my hands on some."
"This beer lives up to the hype 100% in my eyes, and I proudly proclaim I am worthy!"
"Overall, this beer is definitely one of my favorites. I will be drinking this one fairly regularly."
"More than a hint of carbonation."
"Drinkability: Good. I could have another. This really is an intense beer though, so I doubt I could toss them back in succession. Nice to have had it though. I'm going back for a growler."
"The taste is the best part of this beer. I'm still working on how to describe beers, but all I can say is that this beer is pretty intense. Lots of flavor. I couldn't drink 'em all night, but I could drink 'em every night."
"PS I notice that my reviews are longer when the beers are interesting and complicated. It seems that my ratings are proportionate to the length of the review."
"Pours ruby to mahogany in color. Serve from a bomber at cellar temperature. Dense foamy head develops about three fingers head. Head retention is good with a head remaining for a long time. Smells hoppy. First taste reveals a strong bitter hoppy presence. Tastes like an IPA. Very in your face hop presence. Aftertaste remains for a long time. I'm searching for anything other than the strong bitter hops taste. I thought I got a little citrus undertones on the first sip but that doesn't seem present in the second. I'm probably drinking a little warmer than ideal serving temperature. I prefer something a little better balanced. A decent selection but not one I would travel miles for."
"While a bit less beefy than some of its brethren, it's arguably more artfully balanced. It's also simpler than some Stone offerings, but that is in no way a down note. It's malt, it's hops, and it delivers both in a smooth blend. And there is just no way that one is enough, no matter the sign on the bottle. It's likely that arrogance never tasted so good."
"I love ""hoppy"" beers and this is my number one favorite! No one even comes close. I find it hard to believe Stone Ruination and Stone IPA beat this out on BA review rankings because to me they taste a tad watery in comparison. Don't get me wrong I like those beers but no where near as well as ABA. I think the writing on the bottle says it all."
"So I finally had the pleasure of drinking a Stone beer. Pours a very dark amber with a tan head, suprisingly the head didn't last longer. Lacing with slither down your glass with each sip though. Smell is fruity with caramel hops. Taste is very strong but with great roasted and fruit tones. This beer explodes in the mouth, very full and lively. A very drinkable beer, if you want to impress someone with a great beer, this is the one to get."
"An excellent strong ale. First off, one of the best aspects of this beer is it's appearance. Great long lasting head, of a murky yellow white color. The beer is ruby in color, very cool to look at. Smell is very respectable and bold, malty and yeasty, with a hint of sweetness. Taste is very complex. Lightly carbonated, this beer is semi-sweet with a subtle bitter aftertaste. I discovered flavors such as the bitter of grapefruit (which I didn't really like since I don't like grapefruit) and the bite of baking chocolate. Thumbs up to this brew. Sadly though I won't be drinking much of this, since it is wildly overpriced at the only local store that sells it ($5 for a bomber). Way to go Stone!"
"Char"
"Overall, a very smooth drinking beer. I could easily see this as a session beer if not for the wallop of the 7.2% alcohol, which is not noticeable as you drink it."
"Reddish brown body with very low carbonation and a thin head that is gone is a matter of seconds. Lace is also quite minimal, and the beer has very still appearance in general. Aroma is on the sweetish side with flowery hops and malts that smell like honey. I can also detect a fair bit of grain on the nose with hints on vanilla and oak. Malt profile is very Scottish with sweet caramel, plum, cherry, vanilla, and a bit of smoked grain. Hops are quite detectable, and become more pronounced as the beer warms some. The hops add some dryness to the aftertaste due to their spicy, woody character, but they are not really bitter. As the beer gets warmer still, the malts that had been subdued by the hops make a big comeback with very fruity esters. Silky smooth mouthfeel with a nicely warming alcohol content. A sipping beer to wind down a stressful day at work, as the experience is totally relaxing and mellow."
"I finally got one! The pour was incredible, dark copper-red with a beautiful foamy head an inch thick that fell to a creamy thin line that stuck to the sides of the glass throughout the drink. The smell was full of strong hop spice with a hint of malt and a slight floral overtone. The taste started with a great hop kick that lasted from start to finish, somewhere in the middle I gained a kick of malt. The finish bordered on oily with lingering hop overtones. All and all this was a great brew."
"ng"
"This is a symbol for what is so good in brewing today. It is large and in your face and does not care which companies pay lots of money to promote their product. It is brown in color with ruby highlights. The aroma is full of hops and some malt. The bitterness is up front and the body is a sweet and smooth maltiness. It has a big hop finish that is herbal and minty. This beer is extreme and just wonderful."
"Had on tap at Chumley's in Lafayette. This should be what all other craft brews are measured against. Appearance is a nice ruby brown with a quickly disapating tan head. There is a strong raisin taste in this beer which yields to a strong hop profile. The smell hints at more malt than the taste would have you believe. This beer is balanced very well and the alcohol is completely hidden. This beer would never be a bad choice and will continue to be an excellent standby for me."
"Definitely one for the hopheads."
"Tall head, malty aroma, clear ruby brown color. All praise attributed to this popular California ale is well deserved. It is creamy smooth, delicious, has a biting bitter edge and clean finish. A hearty ale with robust properties all around. The body teams with malt while the bitterness is pronounced yet not overdone. All is well proportioned and balanced and the mouthfeel is sublime. This is a champion among beers. And I love all that ""You're not Worthy"" stuff. More power to 'em."
"It reminds me of Old Peculiar, only more drinkable."
"The taste is quite complex, even though it seems to be quite smooth. Can sense some caramel and roasted flavor up front that go nice with the brew. Has a bit of an alcohol taste to it, but not overly strong. The brew finishes with a very noticeable hop punch that smooth out to a somewhat sweet taste? Over all a nice brew, not one of my favorite styles, but I can see why it has the (much deserved) hype."
"Notes: Still not sure if I'm worthy, but at least bottles can't be the judge."
"on tap, fresh and tasty! pours a regal dark auburn, tiny bubbles lifting a moderate head and leaving some killer lace. This brew oozes HOPS, citrus, grapefruit, resins. Oaty/bready malt balance. This is a tasty strong brew to be cherished and sought out, again and again...enjoy the Arrogance!"
"This is an outstanding old ale...balanced..full of flavor....looks the part too...and just think, I've got the Double Bastard still to try..."
"Um...wow. My beermate and I raved about this one from start to finish. Some beers are interesting in a novel way; others are simply good and balanced. This one is both and then some. Pours a unique ruby-brown color with a respectable amount of head and some active carbonation. From the moment the beer hits the glass, the smell bloodies your nose with a barrage of grapefruit. As the beer warms and the citrus hops scatter a bit, some pleasant malts are detectable as well. The grapefruit notes carry over to the taste, but the flavors evolve nicely over time. By the time I was done, the hops were fading to a dry Scotch-like malty flavor. In between is something of a caramely balance of flavors. Resins cling a lot at first though not unpleasantly. As the taste gives way to malts, the mouthfeel likewise gives way to a richer, softer texture. Despite its intensity, this one is very drinkable. This will be one to savor in the future, as well as to expose my yellow beer-drinking friends to what an assertive, creative brewer can do."
"Do I think Stone products are over-hyped? Yes, a bit. Will I have another Arrogant Bastard? Certainly."
"I love the stuff, I try not to make a night of it though."
"all in all this is a great beer. very complex. i love the heavy hops and eventhough i have trouble recognizing the other flavors i do enjoy them."
"Graceful amber pour with excellent lacing that lasted throughout the drink. Step lightly ye filthy bilge rats! Tis nay a beer to be scoffing. Thick nose with a bit of alcohol aroma but not enough to turn one away. Sticky maltiness with great hops that should set ones tongue afire with a taste like none other. The bottles right, I'm not worthy!"
"Shall I compare this beer to a summer's day? I usually don't like people who are bastards, or arrogant, but this one has deserves the moniker. Beautiful red pour with a thick, enticing creamy head, that retains very well. Lacing is amazing, beautiful. Smell is of slight alcohol with a wafting of hops to warn you that this beer is not to be messed with. My nonick pint is still trembling from the pour. Taste- Taste is- thick, not quite chewy malt goodness overtaken by serious hoppyness, with alcohol mixing in with the hops before giving way to a pleasantly bitter aftertaste. This begs to be sipped again. Not too quickly, though, as seven percent is more than most mere mortals can manage. Slight carbonation, not overpowering at all- heck, it's there, but with beer this good, you're going to be concerned with other hoppening matters. A good introduction to the hoppy and malty potential of beer. Let the masses drink their tasteless macro yellow junk. They're not worthy. I raise my pint of the Bastard to them. Bwahaha!"
"Cant believe this was on cask!"
"The bottle warned me that I would not like this ale. LIES! It poured a beautiful dark amber with a substantial, lasting foamy brown head. Big hop aroma with malt undertones and hints of freshly cut grass. The mouthfeel was full and creamy with a light carbonation. Sweet malt up front, hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste, this is an ale that says ""you're drinking me and you're liking me or to Hell with ya'!"" Not being one who wishes for Hell, I choose to enjoy this brew."
"Wow. Big malt but a very very hoppy taste comes right after. Wouldn't have expected it to be this big from the aroma. Very full bodied malt with an extremely assertive hops profile. It would sound like this beer is just a one-dimensional big beer but it's actually very well balanced and complex. There are alot of strong flaovors in here (sweet malt, caramel, hops and spice) and they all complement each other wonderfully. On top of all that, it's just one ass-kicker of a beer, in ABV and big taste. I am always suspicious of ""gimmicky"" ad campaigns but Arrogant Bastard is a perfect name for this brew. Lives up to the hype."
"I finally got a gallon of this brew this week! A local pizza parlor had my favorite beer on tap, and Oh my Lord. This is so awesome. The color is a deep brown - thick creamy head that lasts - the aroma of pungent grapefruit rind comes just short of overwhelming the senses - you want hops? HOPS in three foot high letters. Alcohol fumes drift up and are overcome by the sweet malt which is in turn over come by a killer dry, bitter aftertaste, redolent of black coffee. This beer has become a local favorite. You gotta try this!!"
"Deep copper body with a thin light brown head, dark and taunting. Aroma contains a truckload of bold hops, one of those beers that smell thick, probably due to abundant crystal malt? Light citrus character and a suggestion at leather. Taste is very crystal malty with a weird hop profile leading to a untypical dry finish (chalky, dusty, ashes and slightly smokey). Very bitter aftertaste. Body is typical Stone, very full, thick, almost syrupy. Not my favorite Stone, but I gotta recognize the attitude."
"Dark dirty amber color, with light tan head that clings to the glass all the way down, nice lacing. Smells of malt and hops citrus and pine. Tastes of carmel roasted malt with citrus bite of hops finishing off the brew. It is a strong wonderful tasting beer with a great hop bite. Wonderful brew always have some on hand, very enjoyable."
"I found traits of many styles in this brew. While looking/smelling/drinking this, I thought - this is an amber ale, no this is an IPA, no this tastes a bit like a porter, but a bit like a stout. This is great."
"Stone has impressed the hell out of me again. While I don't believe that it rises to the heights of their beloved (in my case) IPA, I can recognize Arrogant Bastard Ale as yet another superb example of this brewery's brilliance. Am I worthy? Barely. Just barely."
"Despite being apparently different styles, the entire time I drank this I was comparing it to Alpha King. Three Floyds and Stone I see as two premiere microbreweries in high demand. AB and AK are the two flagship brews so I subconciously was measuring the two against each other. While I really enjoyed this and would definitely buy it again, AK is better IMO."
"A very dark copper color with a rusty head that is frothy to the extreme. The lacing is also very thick and entrancing. It's a very nice looking beer. The smell is almost more than one can handle with an aroma that smells of fruity hops and a malty alcohol scent. The taste is like nothing else with a huge hit of hops and malty character that blows your mind. This beer only gets better as it warms. Something that every beer lover must try. Not for the faint at heart."
"Sampled 11/27/03"
"No wonder this is a top 50 brew...poured amber with a creamy head that lasted...beautiful. Smell (or should I say smells) invited you to drink...I detected sweet malt, tangy hops, fruitiness and alcohol...what a great blend. Taste was equally complex.... a surrge of mouth sweetness that changed to citrusy and hoppy on the finish,,,,a tangy bitterness remained...mmm. Surprisingly smooth in mouthfeel for such a high abv, A definite sipper that was very drinkable. A definite recommendation."
"What a great beer!!"
"I liked this beer but not as much as the boasting on the bottle. I would definitely try this one again."
"Big, bad, bold, and brilliant. I'm hooked."
"All around an exceptional beer!"
"Drinkability: This brew lives up to the hype... thank the maker (ha ha) that this is now available in my area. Reminds me of Wailing Wench, but less rough around the edges...which is nice sometimes."
"I have to say I prefer Stone's hoppier offerings."
"head is interesting, need to swish in a big beer glass. Works well on tap too, had at Blue Tusk in Syracuse in late 2004 and had stouty roast in it and bitterness."
"Arrogant and amazing. Id search this one out anywhere I can find it."
"I can not quite place the malt flavour and I am not sure of the hopping. I could not tell if it wanted to be a stong ale or an IPA or a Belgium...."
"Very good slightly creamy soft carbonation helps keep the hops in check. Surprisingly drinkable for style."
"What's truly astounding here is that I like this beer. Despite my unending loathing for grapefruit, I like this. I've enjoyed drinking a few 22-ounce bottles of this and I know I'll do so again, but it's too strong for me to want to drink more than that at one sitting. Overall it's an enjoyable novelty, but in my opinion it's a bit more gimmicky than the bottle, with all its bragging, would like to admit."
"John"
"This is one of the best ""hoppy"" beers on the market. Having moved from Colorado to California, I was in search of a brewery that offered great tasting, hoppy beers. Stone Brewing in San Diego offers some excellent beer, including Arrogant Bastard. As a former English teacher I appreciate the creative writing on the back of the bottle! This beer is hoppy, yet has a slightly sweet aftertaste. It definitely packs a punch. Not for the faint-hearted, for sure. I enjoy the taste so much I could drink this beer every day! I have also had it on tap at The Yardhouse, and it is even smoother and crisper than it is from the bottle. This is an excellent beer, and one of my favorites."
"Well the waiting for me is over-pours a gorgeous amber red color with a slight head. Wonderful hop aroma-citrus,vanilla,some spiciness to it. Great flavor the hops are definately there. Nice earthy aftertaste. The hops sure do leave a lingering pucker on the back of your tongue. This sucker is very smooth for the amount of hops in it. A great beer all around-I could see some people not liking it-its a bit more imperial then your average imperial IPA-but I find it quite yummy."
"Arrogant Bastard pours a deep red pint with medium sized tan head, and great retention and lacing. It smells extremely hoppy but infinitely more complex with citrus overtones. The taste? Talk about arrogance, this brew is so complex I almost don't have the vocabulary to describe what I'm tasting. It has a big malty sweetness which masks the alcohol content really well. Smooth, warming, and complex, Arrogant Bastard lives up to its name and is utterly amazing."
"Very drinkable, but watch it due to the alcohol and normal serving size (22 ounces)"
"Drinkability: One of the reasons to stop by Dr. Dremo's if you ask me. I had to remove their Strong Ale from my palate and this did the trick. I'll definitely have this again and again. Better than Cats."
"Its beers like this that is so frustrating about web sites like this. You read so many good reviews about a beer,and then you search the web sites, and you pay the ridiculous amount of shipping to sample the stuff, and then you find out it 's one of the best beers you 've ever tasted and now your only option is to pay about 10 dollars for a 22 er. Wonderful, wonderful stuff, now how does the working man get this to Wisconsin?"
"my first sampling of a stone brew was a decidedly good one. the arrogant bastard ale was most definitely a big beer, but not as big as the bottle or other reviews had lead me to believe. mind you, this brew is not necessarily for the faint of heart, but it won't knock you on your ass with no hope for recovery either. it pours a dark, dark reddish brown colour with a nice tan head that lasts and lasts and lasts. there is a dominant spicy smell here along with toasted hops and a sweetness which is not as apparent in the taste, where the toasted flavours dominate a complex flavour scheme that does have that sweet but slightly bitter finish to it. this one most definitely gets better as it warms, so let it sit out for a while if it's wicked cold from being in your fridge. a most enjoyable brew overall."
"I have wanted to try this for a long time. The bottle tried to hurt my feelings, but it failed, for it was wrong. I do like this beer. A lot. A copper colored beer with a sweet yet bitter taste. Very hoppy and nicley malted at the same time for a near perfectly balanced brew. The alcohol was just the right level. The warm feeling it left made me decide to drink a lot of this this winter."
"Pale amber look with a nice white head with good retention. carmel malt sweetness on the tongue initially. This malt taste is then cut with a slightly astringent citrus hop wave. Quite smooth and drinkable. It went well with the mussles and friets at Eulogy."
"Dark copper-brown in color with a very nice frothy, 3/4in head that has nice retention. The head is quite sticky, and holds to the sides of the glass. Slight haze is noticeable, but its tough to tell through the fairly dark color. Lots of malty caramel notes are noticeable during the pour. Once in the glass, the aroma of malts is still apparent, but hops stand out more - citrusy, grapefuity hop aromas that are quite clean and somewhat sweet. Nice smooth caramel maltiness up front. Then a bit of citric hops picks up with roasted notes being more noticeable towards the end. Roasted notes linger in the back of the mouth after the finish. Some sweet hop notes are also noticeable towards the end. The body is medium to full with not much carbonation, but the hop bite seems to make up for that. A slight hint of alcohol is noticeable, but doesnt hinder the flavor any. Nice brew, well balanced, and quite drinkable. Definitely lives up to its reputation."
"My conversion came after attending the Stone 7th anniversary party this summer. After a few of these in the hot sun, I was converted to ABA. Enjoy!"
"Appearence: Reddish amber color, very clear, big, foaming head when poured, which took quite some time to fade, leaving lace behind. Smell: Massively heavy hops. Some caramalt malt aroma is in the background if you look for it. Taste: a malty sweetness battles with a heavy resinous hop soup, and eventually loses out. Mouthfeel is tingly, with hop bitterness finishing out. Drinkability: An aggressive, memorable beer. I'm not really a big hophead, but this is very well-made and succeeds at what it aims for."
"Jeez Louise is this beer bangin! It begins with a big up=front hoppiness with a wonderful simultaneious underlying chocolateliness. Then it is all big IBUs from there. This is an amazingly constructed beer. This is much more than just a big hop beer; it has a lot going on underneath."
"Reviewing it at a 4, I still urge you not to be fooled by my numbers. I review harshly. While back in the day I loved stone IPA, but saw arrogant bastard a bit over the top and not quite as balanced, after picking it back up I must say I was wrong. If your pallette has been broken in to good IPA's, you will find the bitterness of this beer very refreshing and not overbearing. For you people who are thrown off by the bitterness, I asure you, there are other flavors here. A dash of caramel, a bit of fruitiness near the end, and the hint of spice interlaced with the hops that you come to expect from a good stone brew. Cheers!"
"The ale arrived sporting a lovely dark amber color with a perfect off-white head. The aroma was good, with some hoppiness being the strong effect on the nose.This has a fantastic malt and hop balance that has your tastebuds wanting more. The sweetness and bitterness lasted together on the tongue well after the swallow. A nice lace formed on the glass as the ale was being emptied from the glass. Very drinkable and overall a great product."
"Drinkability: Overall, one of my new favorite beers. Not sure of my worthiness, but this is a beer that makes the trip to my house whenever it can. Stone = good beer."
"everything the bottle is, but a little less intense. still has the sweet malt paired against the harsh hop character, it just seems a tad more tame. that may be good or bad, depends on the dirnker, but since this IS ""arrogant bastard"" it takes it down a notch."
"Notes: I first tried this about three years ago, and I definitely was *not* worthy. After trying it again, I'm already aching to prove my worth with another bomber."
"This brewery has a unique marketing approach, definitely read the bottle as you drink this one. This beer for all of the hype is quite balanced between the hops and the malt. Definitely hop flavor, aroma and bitterness crawling all over the place in this one, but a nice strong maltiness & sweetness that carries the hop brigade quite well. This is a great beer that is a nice amber color."
"My very first Arrogan Bastard Ale. I was a little intimidated going into this beer knowing how robust it is. I found it to be great. It looked awesome smelled awesome and tasted awesome. There is nothing more that I can say about the ABA that anyone else has said. So Drink up and save a bomber for me."
"It is attractive. I bought it again because it continued to remind me of how complex a beer can be."
"Probably one of the best of its ilk. Delicious all the way around from the hops on top to the sweet malt and the heady alcohol. Sort of a HopDevil on steroids. An awesome beer and thanks again to Shoreline beverage for their selection. Gots to get me some mo!"
"Dry it out a bit and it'd be magnificent."
"Very cool bottle as well."
"Pours a clear ruby-brown with a thick light brown head. Thick sheets of lacing down the side of the glass. Aroma consists of citrusy hops, malt, some dark fruit, dark rum and has a sweetness to it. Medium-bodied mouthfeel. A firm bitterness is present throughout. Nice caramel malt background. Hop bitterness and malt flavor seem to balance each other out rather well. Warming alcohol effect is noticed as the ale goes down. Excellently crafted. I only wish this was available in Wisconsin on a regular basis and that I didn't have to travel 2 hours to track down a bottle."
"Notes: Absolutely delicious. Great beer worthy of me."
"Overall: Fantastically complex brew, and quite fantastic overall. I can't imagine drinking a ton of this beer, it's certainly not a session brew. However, at the same time I don't think I could ever see myself leaving a drop in the bottom of the glass. In all an extremely hoppy brew, and yet very well balanced."
"Everytime I see an Arrogant Bastard brew these words come out of my mouth "" Get in my belly"" with a Fat Bastard scottish accent.."
"From the 22 oz. bottle pours a dark brown (slightly red when held up to light) beer with a somewhat foamy off-white thickish head. A good looking beer. The aroma is rather mild, it has some spiciness to it, but is fairly unimpressive. Nice complex taste--some spiciness, but also tastes of sweet malt, bitter hops, and fruit. Becomes more flavorful as it warms and the complexity really comes out. A very good tasting beer. Fairly smooth and drinkable--overall a pretty good beer (especially in terms of taste) although it does not seem to live up to its own hype on the label, which I guess makes sense for an Arrogant Bastard."
"A great brew that I look forward to enjoying again in the future."
"Seriously, this one is astounding. These guys have to be Stone crazy. The oak-aged Arrogant Bastard reviews certainly have my interest at this point. The, Fluid malten beast, (Classic Coke) just made a new fan."
"What a beer. Not for the faint of heart, but the label should have scared timid beer drinkers aways anyway. This beer poured a dark amber and brown body with a chewy thick tan head. The nose is a blast of thick dripping malt, toasted, caramel, biting, smokey, with a nice citrus hop snap. The flavors are full bodied, roasted malt flavors with a nice balancing faint sweetness, which is then slammed by a slicing hop bitterness. A true joy to drink, I just wish the Arrogant One was available in Wisconsin...."
"When someone asks, ""What is American style beer?"" I point them to this. It's big and it's hoppy. Pours a deep burgundy color with a slight haze. The head is thick and never goes away. One of the most complex beers I've ever had. Starts out sweet with the taste of caramel and maple syrup and finishes with the intense bitterness of chinook hops."
"This beer is best as a sipping beer, IMO. Rather unbalanced taste will appeal to hops-lovers. The alcohol content is pretty well masked and could really sneak up on the unwary drinker. This is an intense beer that really grabs you by your tastebuds. Arrogant Bastard Ale fires a veritable artillery barrage of hops at the drinker. Not the first beer I'd aim at a person who only drinks macros."
"Medium - full bodied. Unique, and enjoyable. More of a sipping beer for yours truly, but one I will certainly seek out again."
"Basically the label says it all, this is an aggressive beer. So very bitter and complex. If you're not paying attention all of the wonderful flavors in this beer will fly right past you. Deffinatly a beer to take your time with."
"Wow, my first bomber bottle and or Stone. First of all, great bottle, both the info and humor, not to mention the attitude. The brew poured a ruby red with a nice one inch tan head. Lace was very nice. The aroma was of light hop, grass and malt background. Taste is a surprise hop overtone bonanza. Very slight malt to balance this very smooth and drinkable brew. The mouth is left tart but moist, not a dry beer. Hop lingers on in the aftertaste. A very well-done, well-crafted brew. Reminded me of a Great Lakes ""Elliot Ness", Thats a compliment!"
"A nice medium bold mouthfeel. It drinks well. There is a bite feeling to this ale. I truly enjoyed the bite. I could not drink this on a daily basis but for a nice swift kick in the taste buds it will do nicely."
"Once again, Cheers Stone!!"
"My friends ordered this for me when I caught my first trophy muskie. They said it was fitting, since now I'll become an arrogant bastard. Anyways... Holy smokes, this beer looks good. A deep, coppery red colour with a thick head. Smelled very hoppy. Whoa. Also detected some floral hops, pine, a little citrus and barley malt. Tastes great. When this beer enters your mouth, the tongue is hit with a complex mosaic of malts, citrus, smoke and alcohol. When it leaves through the throat, that sweetness becomes a bitter taste, as if the hops are making their final stand. Heavy mouthfeel. It's a bit thick, sort of like watered down syrup. For this beer, that's a good thing. Drinkable in that yes, I shall be drinking this again. And again. And again. But at one sitting, any more than three would seem too much. This beer is a treat to be savoured, not a drink to be guzzled."
"Almost a cherry wood in color. Nice hoppy aroma with a slightly smoky undertone. Taste is smooth, hops in the foreground. A slight cognac feel in the middle, with spice and caramel feel on the end. Certainly arrogant, but certainly not obnoxious. A well crafted highly drinkable brew that is perfect for this summer's day. Bravo!!!"

"A complicated situation, it was. A test of malt heft versus hoppy assertion culminating in perfectly heavy, splendidly carbonated, and ultimately consumable collision."
"Not being a hop head I can't rate this beer highly as it is very hoppy and my taste buds were tingling or just smacked hard by the bitterness.. the quintessential Pale Ale for hops and bitterness with little malt balance in the glass that I tried. Alcohol to boot that is disguised in the hoppy overtones."
"ruby brown, with a light brown head. fresh hops in the smell with some mixed fruity aromas, almost a fruit punch like effect. as for the taste, piney hops provide the backbone, but then it mellows a bit to fruity malt character raspberries dominating, a little caramel is present as well with hint of a grainy malt characteristic. the aftertaste is very hoppy. well carbonated with a meduim body. this beer has some balls. devlivers big in the hops dept. but has enough complexity of other flavors to be enjoyed on many other levels. an incredible beer."
"Pours a medium brown with medium sticky head,aroma is somewhat hoppy and maybe a little orange-like.Taste is pretty hoppy and zesty to begin with,with some nutty tones as well as caramel tones on the palate.Wow this is a complex brew,have heard alot of stuff about this one,now I know why."
"I enjoyed this beer the more I drank, very impressed."
"($3.99 / 22 oz.)"
"Thanks to Gusler for getting me the bottle."
"Pours a dark copper color with a big and foamy orange head. The head rises to crispy tips like merengue and sticks around a good long while. The aroma is low, but sweet, with hints of cinnamon and alcohol. Flavor is rich, sweet, and malty, with a very noticeable alcoholic kick. I'm not getting the hop profile that others describe. It only seems to come through in the finish. Fine wispy lacing crawls down the glass. I'd like more balance in the flavor, and less sweetness."
"this brew pours a beautiful deep reddish brown, with a thick tan head. It leaves a nice thick lace which remains at the top of the glass by the end of the pint. The smell is immediately fruity, mostly pineapple, with just a hint of hops and malt to complement, and a strong undertone of pure alcohol. The smell, I soon learned, was no indication of what the taste was to be. THe first sip was wonderfully smooth, with a smaller, yet fitting, amount of carbonation. the first taste sensation was a sharp alcoholic bitter, which although hoppy, seemed to include something more, which i find myself unable to pinpoint. the bitter immediately reaches a high point, and there it plateaus, remaining for a long time, while more subtle flavors begin to appear. a burnt earthy flavor lingers behind the bitterness, while a general hint of fruityness makes itself apparent. as the pint progresses, the bitter simply refuses to abate, and after finishing this glass, i think i could rightly call myself an Arrogant Bastard"
"A spicy, well-crafted brew, but lacking of enough finesse to make it very drinkable. Still, when you're in the mood for a Stone brew, you can rely on them like a hammer to the head."
"the beer looks nice and the bottle tries hard to stand out, but that's about all i like about this beer. the hops are just so overbearing that it left me with a muddy/earthy flavor in my mouth. have you ever smelled plain ole raw hop pellets before used for brewing? that's what this beer tastes like. there's absolutely no malty sweetness to balance it out either. yeah it masks the alcohol well, but so what? this beer is just so gimmicky to me. hops are great for adding bitterness and aroma, but this beer uses way too much of them."
"Yikes! Talk about hops! When this brew was poured into my glass, it poured with a large tan head that was fairly long lasting and there were fine-large bubbles. The body hue was dark brown and there was a little bit of carbonation observed. The first whiff of this brew reminded me of pineapples. From the first taste to the last taste of this brew it was constantly a strong bitter tasting brew that I did not enjoy very much. The taste of this brew stays around for a while."
"The hops in this one hit you over the head like a runaway tractor trailer. NOT for the weak! Excellent, full bodied, highly potent flavors just as bold as the hop character, but very enjoyable. Alcohol is noticeable, but not unpleasant. It should A smooth drinking brew, but rather strong for an extended session beer, unless you don't mind crawling on your knees! This is an exceptional example of the style, and the double will probably send me into orbit.... CHEERS to Stone Brewing once again!!"
"This brew pours a large head of light brown fine to medium sized bubbles and a cloudy dark brown body. It has a pineapple like aroma. Wow what a plate! It really give you a wake up call on the first sip. Lot's of flavor, strong initial bite, very complex with notes of spice roasted malt, and of course lots of hops. It leaves a stong afterbite too where the alcohol content shows itself."
" ""YOU'RE NOT WORTHY"" Dark brown color, medium head. WOW This is a very aggressively hoppy ale, very bitter strong hop taste. Extremely bitter finish. Nice balance of malt and hops. An aggressive beer, nice taste but not for everyone. Nor would I want to drink this beer all the time. High alcohol (7.2%). Nice etched bottle."
"(Props to Linc for giving me the chance to try this)A hop bomb. No subtle use of hops to be found here. Very sharp hoppy aroma (grapefruit/pine), with some raisins. The flavour is pretty full on, hops everywhere, quite bitter and very sharp and a bit sickly, particularly as you work your way through it, the amount of hops throws the balance out a bit. Pretty much everything i was expecting, a massive hop bomb. Did i mention it was hoppy?"
"pours a deep hell-fire red with an awesome off white head that would not go away. carmel and piney hoppiness on the nose. huge carmely malt presence holds up nicely against an equally huge piney PNW hop prsence. this beer looks and tastes like the definition of ""strong"". a wonderfully powerful delicious ale, only gets low drinkability score in my book b/c i couldn't imagine putting away more than two of these. still, a great beer to sip and admire the craftsmanship. better on draught than in the bottle. a great, unique brew."
"Mixed emotions about the drinkability, though. It's like the brain-freeze from a Slurpee: You can't help yourself by ordering one after another, but it hurts so good you can't stop."
"This was served on the hour, every hour, and without fail there was a line 5-10 minutes before, even though most had had the beer before. The Bastard had fallen off the Top 50 for a while, but I'm glad to see it back as this is truly one of the great beers of the American microbeer revolution. From the wonderful reverse psychology of the painted-on label to the wonderful contents inside, this is a beer that should be on everyone's favorite list!"
"Originally sampled 29 December 2001. Yes, I am worthy! When you take the Arrogant Bastard out of the fridge, let it sit on the counter for 10 or 15 minutes before you crack it open. This way, you can enjoy the explosion of flavors. This is one big beer; get some."
"This bad-ass amazes my every time I have one. (which is very, very often) Pours a tremendously dark brown. Thick tan head that sticks around to hang out for a while. Play on words there to describe what the head does to the glass, ""sticks"" & ""hangs"". Over the top scent of hops, over the top taste of hops. Hops with perhaps toasted malt and caramel and some spuce-like undertones. A very strong malt backbone holds this beer together and it does a damn fine job. This is a aggressive beer, somewhat of a bittersweet symphany. (to be corny) Job well done, making this a must have in the fridge at all times kinda beer."
"A very dark amber colored brew with just the right amount of head. After a great pour the ol factory senses kick in. This beer has a strong almost spicy smell that is coplemented by the aroma of the hops. The taste is strong and bitter with a slight spice flavor that melts away and is overtaken by the hops. Overall a great beer that kinda makes you want to be an arrogant bastard."
"It poured a very dark brownish amber with a creamy tan head that's still slightly present halfway down the glass. Mouthful is substantial. Smooth yet aggressive, rich malt flavors followed by extreme bitter hops and a nice alcohol warmth. A little on the harsh side with raw hops, but I can't say I wasn't warned.."
"Overall, a good beer with lots of character. I'm puzzled why I hadn't managed to review this one on BA yet."
"This beer came with a fair head covering a semi cloudy brownish red liquid. I did not start with a good impression. I was suspecting an overpowering hops aroma and taste, but was pleasantly surprised. The hops were in the forefront in both the nose and the tongue, but the malt characteristics were not left out. The bitterness started the taste and clung to the tongue a long time after the beer had been swallowed. The mouthfeel was moderate with a fair amount of carbonation. It was probably the hops and not the bubbles that tickled the tongue. I am looking forward to enjoying my next glass of Bastard and would recommend it highly."
"This thing pours a dark red/brown, with a nice head that slowly recedes. The aroma was very malty with very noticable hops mixed in there. After the first taste, for a minute there I really though that they were right, and I wasn't worthy, but then the flavors really started to came out. I'm not one for most highly hopped beers, but this is one, really complex beer, that I really came to enjoy by the time the bomber was empty."
"My 1st Bastard, and not to be my last! It poured a dark red-brown, with a small khaki head. Scads of fine lace. The aroma was mostly malt, with hop notes. The taste was grapefruit, hops, with a light caramel note. Mouthfeel was smooth, not oily, even with all the hops. The finish was hops bitterness and grapefruit. Not so much Arrogant, as aggressive, but not so hoppy that the bitterness overwhelms."
"Happy Drinking"
"I could take it no further. After 3 days of sitting my growler had to be opened. After an initial smell and taste a few people readily came to mind that fit the description of this Ale. Bombastic, arrogant, however all of those people are lacking the intricacy that Stone Brewing has accomplished with this beer. The head was thick, foamy resembling the color of coffee with cream just added. The only clear part of the body of the beer was right at the base of the glass. The rest had a substantial, murky, red cloud hanging. The smell was infinitely complex with such varied aromas as coffee, HUGE hops, grapefruit and toffee interweaving. The taste watered my mouth, leaving me wanting more. It was super hoppy with a big robust citrus flavor and some more subtle smoked notes mixed in. Although the appearance was not as spectacular as the Bigfoot the taste was far more refined, truly being able to claim the name Arrogant."
"Murky reddish brown with a light chocolate head. Intricate lace dripping down the side of the glass like a Dali painting. Definitively complex smell, hoppy and tangy. Same with the taste; there's nothing subtle about this brew. Significant endurance as the aftertaste reflects back the tanginess on the back of the tongue."
"AB poured a nice crystal clear amber with a thick creamy head. Bready aromas and hops - almost a piney or cut-grass smell - rose up from my glass. The taste followed suit - very piney and green - methinks I should have aged this bottle for a few months. Big on hops. Big on malt, once you look past the hops. Not too hoppy for my tastes, but this beer was just simply too young."
"This ale poured a clear, red-amber color with tall, creamy, tan foam that left lace on the pint glass. The smell was biscuity (bread) with citrus, malt, floral hops aromas. There was a crispness to the smell. The taste was dominated by malt sweetness, but with floral hops, oak, grapefruit, pine, some aromatic tastes, and a bit of caramel thrown in. The mouthfeel was smooth but crisp with a hoppy astringency. The body was medium and so was the carbonation. This is a very drinkable strong ale. Very nice with a good kick!"
"Tried this on draught at Barley's Smokehouse. This is just one of those beers that is so unique and difficult to categorize that it is always a pleasure to drink. Pours a deep dark reddish brown with a thin and foamy beige head. Thin lacing. Aroma is alternatingly floral, fruity (citrus mostly), and malty. Medium-bodied and tart, with flavors of citrus, caramel, malt and pine. Complex yet easy to drink, with a nice strong and bitter finish."
"Bottom Line: No need to question the parentage of this beer. It clearly is the spawn of Satan himself!"
"I had this wonderful brew in 22oz. form poured into a tulip glass. The color is a super deep ruby red, probably the deepest red hue I've ever seen. This color is just breathtaking. The pour gives a good 1 finger of head, that fades away to a small line very slowly, and leaves a fair amount of lace down the glass as I drink it. The smell wasn't what I expected. It had a sweet fruitiness to it, which was very pleasantly mixed with hop aroma. The taste starts off sweet, with a bite of citrus, grapefruit I'm thinking. The finish is all hops, but not too bitter. This is a beer that is in perfect malt/hop harmony. I really love it. The mouthfeel is a little soft for a strong ale though. The drinkability of this beer is very high, even at 7.2%ABV. I wish I wouldn't have bought the store's last bottle!"
"Poured a beautiful dark amber color with a nice fluffy orangy-beige head. Piney, citrusy hoppy fragrance smells great. Very velvety feel, very smooth on the palate and tasting very bitter with almost an ESB type of bitterness to it that lingers for quite awhile. In fact it doesn't want to let go. Real nice malt but obviously overpowered by bitterness. Name suits it well, arrogantly bitter. Bitter Bitter Bitter!"
"22 oz. bomber. Pours a dark brownish-red with a big, frothy off-white head. Aroma is of lemon-grass and lots of citrus. Hop bitterness and toasted malt. Taste is pretty much the same. Starts out with the citrusy bitterness, and ends with the malts. Very crisp to start, but ends somewhat smooth. Has a great warming effect. This is an oh so complex brew, and should be respected. Definitely a once in a while brew."
"(1/2/09) Oh, how foolish we are when we are just learning! The Bastard is one of the best (and most unique) American ales I've had - and I like the Oak even a little better. Funny to read the old reviews before the palate became more refined!"
"WOW"
"This is the first time I have drank this beer and I am in love with it. It is Sexy and Seductive and I am the bumbling virgin who has stumbled into its trap. I think I need a cigarette."
"Thank you Morris729 for this awesome beer!"
"Growler from Half Time. Dark amber, small head from growler pour. An insanely bitter, malty beer. Hops of course are the dominant flavor, so tart and bitter, but they also become fruity and bolster the caramel sweetness from the malts. Still if you don't like bitter beers you probably won't enjoy this. I like them generally, and enjoyed this beer, but a growler is perhaps too much of a good thing. Also the hop bitterness aroused my appetite (as hoppy beers are wont to do), but when it came time to eat something my taste buds were completely stripped from the beer. Good velvety mouthfeel, long astringent finish. An interesting, but not exactly useful beer."
"It's too bad I'm not worthy, though."
"Definitely tasty, definitely good, but I'm not sure that this is something I'd drink often."
"-F"
"Dark mahogany with a reddish tint. The medium/full malt body provides an almost creamy texture and light malt sweetness. Terrific aroma of hops, malt, alcohol and yeast (in that order) lasts throughout. Very highly hopped like a citrusy IPA only more alcoholic. Noticeable yeasty taste. This is a powerful, highly aggressive ale. Nice lasting whitish beige head and clinging lace."
"Had a moderate length finish, with a surprisingly quiet aftertaste for what is, at first taste, an aggressive beer. The mouthfeel was oily, but soon after the swallow the hops went to work coating my mouth with a very soft dryness. Pretty good, would like to see more things than just the hops be present in the taste and mouthfeel."
"Oh yeah, this is some good stuff. Good looking brew with that peachy amber look and tan head, too quickly gone. Great lacing and a smell that warns you of the arrogance right away. Hops and malt. Malt and hops. Packs a wallop, that Ol' Bastard. Citrus sense and all that jive talking in the palate, all the way from the front to the back. Why, oh why, is this so hard to find in Ohio?"
"A beautiful beer once poured into a glass, so pretty my girlfriend got jealous of me looking at it. The spicy aroma lept of the top of the glass to my nose and I think my nose actually puckered. The taste is great, a little bitter to consume too much, but the variety of flavors that mix with that definite hop make it an experience to not pass up. A fairly strong beer, which is detectable really in the taste."
"This is simply one of the finest brews I have ever had. It is so intense with flavor and aroma. Very full of body with hops that could make many men cry. I cannot wait to meet with this one again."
"Hops...check! Malt....check! Flavor for days....check! This one's got em all. A beer for all occasions. This one pours dark amber with big,thick tan head bursting with citrus hops- grapefruit rind and ripe oranges with a touch of earthy hop resin for good measure. It has a thick, heavy texture that is surprisingly easy to drink. The hop/malt balance is nice, sweet malt with a citrus hop flavor that finishes toasty with a smooth hop bitterness. It doesn't have a very complex malt flavor but more a base to hold complex hop flavor and bitterness.It is a bit heavy but enough fun by itself to quaff a few with snacks. A great beer to have around year round."
" feeling it already. Nice! =)"
"Well i took the challenge..but somehow I doubt that i am worthy!!"
"This is one helluva great brew. Pours a deep orangish/reddish/brown color with a moderately frothy off-white head, which leaves a thin, sticky lace. The aroma is definitely not for the faint of heart. A healthy punch of hops attacks the olfactory senses, leaving them begging for mercy. Slight aromas of fruit and alcohol are also detected. The bold taste of hops will beat down your taste buds and have them screaming Uncle. This is one vastly complex brew, I didnt think that anyone could put that much hops into one beer. Am I worthy? Why, yes I am."
" Slightly hazy, deep ruby color with slow, lazy trickles of carbonation. Frothy, pale tan head that left thick, clumpy lace at the top of the glass. Strong aromas of citrusy hop and fresh wort sweetness and ....more stuff. Initial flavors of juicy plums and cherries with maple and brown sugary grain that quickly blends easily with intense hop flavors of fresh oranges and ground pepper. This beer is aggressivly and arrogantly hopped yet still achieves just amazing balance. The strong, bitter finish is softened by left over roasty sweetness that makes you suck at the roof of your mouth to suckle every drop. I can honestly say I enjoyed this bottled version just as much ( tho, side by side taste test would be cool) the draft I sampled at the now infamous Blind Tiger 12, 12 @ 12 NYC Stone event. Now... the oak aged Arrogant Bastard.....that was a special thing indeed."
"Slightly sticky full body that just forces you to drink more and more. I'm so thankful to Gusler for the trade and even happier that I willl be seeing this in stores near me real soon. What a beer!"
"Yes, it does earn a five."
"Great message on the back of the bottle. Pours a deep copper with a tan thick head that sticks well to the sides. Lightly carbonated and smells of a hint of spicy fruitiness. Bold sweet maltiness balanced out well with a hop bite that's like the smell, fruity and spicy but realllly bold. Mouthfeel reminds me of a liqueur. I loved this."
"I am sooo glad stone is now available in NY...I will definately be picking up alot more of this"
"Drinkability: To be honest, I'd love to drink this all night, but I'd really pay the price in the morning. It's so aggressive in flavor, yet so easy to down...that's a scary combination!!"
"Comments: Life is good. Stone is now available in NY. Oh those hops. Worthy or not, for now on, I will ALWAYS have a pint (or 2, or 3, or ….) of the Arrogant whenever I find it or it finds me."
"I have been told that this is similar to Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale, and I love SN Celebration; but, to me, there is no contest. If SN Celebration is a cottage, this is a mansion. More complicated than SN Celebration. More demanding. A glorious beer."
"The Bastard pours with a tan head: fine with big bubbles in the middle. It condenses to a nice blob of vanilla ice cream with sticky, thick lacing. The beer itself is a beautiful garnet color. The nose is piney hops with underlying sweetness. The front is a slap-in-the face, bitter piney taste but this gives way to a full, sweet, malty middle (not that the hops go away, mind you). The finish is a lingering, strong, bitter, alcholic hop dream. Major cream and chocolate push through at temperature. This is just an amazing, hoppy, malty, creamy, classic concoction. One of a kind."
"The hops are more than throwing themselves at you in the aroma, in addition to the full, reddish brown malty body. There is a subtle carbonation that makes the effect of the alcohol stand out more. A full bodied malt backbone hold up the powerful addition of hops, and a bit of a caramel sweetness that accompanies it. This brew is quite over the top, and kicks almighty ass."
"Pours a red/ruby color leading to a fine creamy tan head. The head slowly gave away to a thick lace that held on to the very bottom of the glass. The aroma was great hops and a strong citrus smell, grapefruit comes to mind. The taste is just as satisfying as the aroma. Malt with a bold attack of hops. Great carbonation and drink ability! A must for all to try!"
"What's better than a 22oz bottle of Arrogant Bastard? Finding Arrogant Bastard on tap! Sunset Bar and Tap in Allston had this on tap. I actually did not see it on the menu the first few times I looked because it is in the Amber Ale section. This is not an amber! anything that is a redish brown can not be an amber. The bartender told me that they stuck it there because they couldn't figure out where to put it. This beer is too good for clasification! Gotta love them hops!"
"This is a beer that you're either going to love or hate. It's uncompromising in all ways."
"(On tap at Eulogy Belgium Tavern)-- Pours a deep red brown in color. Lace is off-white color, frothy, and sticky; retains very well. On the nose the aromas of toasted grains, fruity esters, and the alcohol is evident as well. Mouthfeel is smooth. On the palate the flavors erupted; complex malty sweetness, toasted bread, hints of caramel, pine, grain, and fruity/figs. Medium to full bodied brew. Alcohol really kicks in at the end. This stuff rocks...."
"This huge beer pours an awesome deep brownish ruby red. It forms a nice full cream colored head that holds well. The aroma is filled with an agressive hop aroma, some sweet maltiness, and a great aroma of figs or other fruits. The beer has a great fullness to it and the first sip is nice and thick almost chewy. A very upfront somewhat abrasive bitterness is complemented with the sweetness of the fruit flavors and malt. An awesome brew very well done, in fact it is a go to. This beer complements food better than most beers, the Bastard is amazing. My complements to the brewers at Stone!!!"
"A thin lace sits upon a deep dark brown body. The aroma of heavy hopping is very inviting and reflects well on the brews name. The first sip brings forth a heavy bitterness and heavier floral spice. The distinguishing characteristic of chocolate malt pushes through the hoppiness and is supported heavily by a smooth thick body. Very complex and powerful."
"Cheers"
"Deep red pour, with a big beige head that laces all the way to the end. Aroma fills the room with citrus and hops, much like the IPA and Ruination do, but a little stronger. Light caramel is present initally, followed by a hops onslaught that never seems to let up. Truly a fantastic brew."
"This is a truly outstanding brew... and I find that I'm one of the few... I am worthy."
" The tan head disappeared slowly to show the clear copper-red color. The aroma was very odd, a soft chalky pine smell like no other i've had before. A sweet caramel taste sticked to the inside of my mouth and then the hoppy bitterness took over in a big way. Damn i love this brew! A very enjoyable almost oily bitter taste lingers for a long time. I do think i'm worthy of drinking Arrogant Bastard on a regular basis, so PLEASE Stone bring your brews to conn.. Thanks Morris729 for the sample."
"This is a very good well balanced medium to full bodied beer. I find it to be very filling which leaves little room for another bottle. Definitly a beer not for beginners (i.e. macro beer drinkers!)"
"Wow! After all of my friends hyping this beer up I took the plunge and and I ever glad I did! This has got to be the best smelling beer I have ever had. After I poured it, I let it sit for awhile and warm a bit and took in the aroma that had hints of pine and carmel. The beer bursted with flavor once it hit my mouth and just opened up, dominated by hops but I could taste the malt sneek in there before the great hoppy finnish. I'm glad this is a year 'round brew because it will be a regular in my fridge from now on."
"Smells like kitty litter and Febreeze. (?!) Wierd. There are some beer-like smells too: caramel, copper pennies, bread etc. But the hops are so oily-strong that it veers into the household cleaner realm. Flavors are similar but with a rewarding finish of hot, buttery caramel. Not sweet. Bitter. Not subtle. An extreme style, I think, as opposed to poorly executed, which keeps it in the top quartile of beers. An impressive display."
"This was my first experience with the beer and the brewery. Im glad to say that it all lived up to the hype. Thanks to TXHops for the beer."
"Well worth the wait, and worth seeking out again and again."
"Well I finally worked up the nerve to pop the cap off the Bastard. It pours a gorgeous deep mahogany in the glass with a massive, rocky, light tan head leaving a whole lotta lace. The aroma whacks you in the nose with brown sugary malt, fruity esters (some pineapple) and citrusy hops. In the taste, Malt and Hops are nicely balanced, though the ostentatious bitterness is a bit overwhelming at first. It's best to let this brew flex its muscles (i.e. breathe) for a few minutes. Huge caramel and fruit show up in the taste (like caramel coated apples) with plenty of citric hoppy bitterness to keep the brew from being cloyingly sweet. It loses points in drinkability just for being such a hugely rich and heavy brew. I'm full and content, no need for another."
"(ADDENDUM: 12/27/02 I had the opportunity to visit a place called Fogg & Suds on the outskirts of Vancouver, BC the other day, and to my astonishment this place is ""trying"" to fetch $30.00cdn for a bottle of this stuff. Buyer beware. Arrogant Bastard is great stuff, but it should be obtainable for less than 1/3 the price being asked for here.) <sigh>"
"Pours a dark, clear copper color with a nice tan-hued head. Leaves giant trails of lace down the glass. Smell is very inviting with big notes of fresh hops, caramel malt, etc. This is an incredibly tasty brew. Hops hit you at first, followed by a more than sufficient caramel malt backbone that supports the bitterness nicely. Mouthfeel is quite smooth and for a brew of its magnitude (7.2%), AB drinks quite easily. I'm glad I finally got to try this one. Arrogance is bliss."
"http://www.soundclick.com/bands/3/larryvigneaultmusic.htm"
"This bastard pours a nice copper red with a foamy tan head that's not going away. The head last for the whole time it takes to drink it. The aroma is of floral hops with undertones of sweet malt and citrus. The taste starts with a hop bite that flows into a rich sweet malt. The finish is hop bitterness with hints of pear and alcohol. The aftertaste lingers for quite awhile with a nice balance of carmel malts, floral hop bitterness and touches of alcohol warmth. The mouthfeel is smooth and enjoyable. This is a great ale. It may be a bit bitter for some but it isn't out of balance. At 7.2% abv it will get your attention and warm your cockles."
"It's even a pretty beer. Dark copper color. Moderate head and a nice cascading, layered lace as it goes down in the glass. And it does go down. Much too quickly. Almost perfect. But as I said, I shy away from superlatives."
"What a wonderful appearance this beer has. The color is reddish-brown, with a thick tan head, and beautiful lacing. The promised ""arrogance"" is disguised a bit by a deceptively woodsy-sweet nose, and a luscious, creamy texture. The nose also suggests an aroma of apple. The flavor is assertive and hoppy, with a forceful, lingering bitterness in the finish. For the style, the hops could be toned down somewhat for my tastes. But, in keeping with the warning on the label, perhaps I'm just not yet ""worthy."""
"This beer almost brought a tear to my eye the first time I tried it. It's that good. The intense hops and malt in AB are just beautifully balanced and complex. The hop bite in the flavor is remarkable. The head is enormous, and the aftertaste is amazing. This just might knock Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout out of the coveted ""Best Beer I've Tried So Far"" designation. The only question is where do I go from here? Be careful when you're drinking beer that's this good."
"It poured into the glass a dark red/brown color. The head was a thick and creamy. The lace seemed sticky and clinged to the sides of the glass to the end. The aroma was strong, dominated by hops and toasted grains with a hint of toffee and/or caramel. The flavor was actually very complex it combined a sweet malt, hoppy bitterness with notes of citrus which did not show up on the nose. This was a very good beer to the end."
"I was comletely shocked by the amount of malt flavors this beer produced! This beautiful red-amber beer was served with a nice head that failed to ever fully subside. It left a nice lace on the glass as well. The aroma was very potent, with hops florals, citrus, and pine notes. The first taste startled me not because of the hops, but because of the excellent balance of maltiness and bitterness. Strong caramel notes were followed by an intense hop presence that left a lingering mitterness on the aftertaste. Every taste followed the same malt - citrus - bitterness trend, from beginning to end of the glass. The mouthfeel was very full, but yet somewhat refreshing with the heavy hop finish. The drinkability was good, as I did not realize the moderate ABV of this beer while drinking. This was a better beer than I had anticipated, and I plan to buy some arrogance again very soon."
"This is definately a hop head beer. Very hoppy with a bitter finish. Rather ropugh on the pallate too. I love their logo though. Just not a very clean finish either. Drinkable but definately not on my list of favorites. The aroma is deceptive. Perhaps that is the real problem with this beer. You get the aroma of Hops and are probably expecting more than you get from the taste. Also tastes a lot like it was allowed enough fermentation time. PErhaps if they bottle fermented this beer it would smooth out and be excellent then."
" I'm just sorry I can't get it here!"
"I love this beer, cascade citrus aroma, pours ruby-brown color,roasted huge malty flavor with a balanced huge hop profile.This is a big ale with a great flavor, I love it, I could drink it daily."
"I did not want to like this beer. Everyone raved about it and I thought ""so what?"" I picked up a bottle, and read the label, ""you're not worthy."" "And you are?", I thought. It poured dark amber with a nice head. The first sip was exhillerating. I was not quite prepared for this. Mega hops and a BOLD taste. I thought, ""this will soon subside."" It didn't. The last drink tasted just like the first. I killed the bottle an about an hour and a half. A 22oz usually lasts me 30 minutes if it is my first. Not this time. I enjoyed and savored every gulp. When I finished, I could drink no more. I had only bought one bottle and all my other beers were, ""not worthy""."
"Hop heads, embrace! A fearless leader has arrived."
"Pours a dark reddish brown color with a thick and creamy head that did a superb job of clinging to the sides of the glass while drinking.  The aroma, which is quite strong, is dominated by hops and toasted grains with hints of toffee and caramel.  The flavor is a complex combination of a malty sweetness and a hoppy bitterness with notes of citrus.  Its very creamy in the mouth and goes down smoothly.  A very good brew with a nice price of $3.69 for a 22oz bottle."
"This head of tiny bubbles quicky becomes an expanding universe which is gradually swept away in the rising ale below.  Smells of sweet apricots, carmel and coffee, which is a deceptive quality of this bitter brew.  Drinking this ale without an open nose is like listening to an arguement without knowing the details."
"The hops certainly prevail once you get past the head, but the citrus stays there also, right through to the aftertaste, which finishes warmly if you'll let this beer get above 55 degrees before you start, which leads me to the point I was alluding to at the top. I think the first time I had ABA it was too cold and the citrus was masked too much. Like night and day, much more enjoyable this time around. Keystone fans... up yours!"
"Not worthy!  I beg to differ, I was not impressed by this beer.  As a devout hoprhead I looked forward to this beer and was disapointed.  Pours a nice copper color but with almost no head.  The aroma is very hoppy which teased me into great expectations.  It did have a hoppy taste but it did not vary from first sip to last. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but while I wouldn't turn down another one I would also surely not buy one..............CHEERS"
"Been a while since I had this bad boy, and it is a beer that 99.9% of the beer drinkers will not like? But I believe if you ""Can't Run With The Big Dogs, Stay On The Porch"". Pours a deep dark ruby brown, portly beige head and lots of lace. Nose is malt, some what toasted, hop floral tones.The start is malt, the middle full, robust, the finish is devastatingly hopped, potently acidic, and the aftertaste malt dry. Very hearty, a ""Beer Lovers"" beer, not meant for the Palate Challenged Lite Beer Drinkers""."
"Not a session ale that's for dang sure!  Dark reddish brown with a thick long lasting tan head, exceptional lacing.  Strong smell of citrusy hops most notably grapefruit. Very bitter blast of hops coat the palate, good mouthfeel. A very complex full bodied, hoppy ale.  Very decadent and a good one for that indulgent mood we want to satisfy.  While very enjoyable to drink it packs a wallop at almost 8.0%.  I will have it again."
"Sweeter than the bottle, bit more deep caramel and highly toasted malt come through before the hoppiness sets in. Quite a treat but quite estery after it warms up, lovely mix of flavours. Something to start or end with but not make the night of being that it is such a strong ale."
"The bartender poured  my samples right to the top of the pint glass, so there was not much head to speak of -but I'm not complaining, just means more beer to drink. The body was apple red colored and slightly cloudy and left drink marks down the side of the glass. Fruity aroma of grapefruit and pineapple lifesavers. The first few sips were like a multi layered flavor explosion. At first it seemed too sweet, too grapefruity, and too bitter, then after a few sips all these flavors seemed to join together as a cohesive unit that was in awesome balance. After about a half a pint I realized what all the hype was about since this was a very drinkable, full flavored beer. After a while I didn't even notice the bitterness of the hops. Could have sat and drank this all night, but someone would have had to carry me home."
"I must say, this one starts to impress while it's still being poured!  Burnt amber color topped by a huge sticky tan head that stays almost endlessly.  Leaves tons of lace as the glass is emptied.  Grand aroma of ultra-citrusy hops, as well as piney hop character.  Just a little sweet malt backs it all up.  The first taste is a war between malt and hops, both in full force.  Rich and sweet maltiness comes on strong, along with sharp spears of citrus and rind-like hop bitterness.  Hints of spicy alcohol.  Grainy malt and bitter hop finish.  It's usually hard to find that complexity in the finish of a beer.  Tingly yet smooth mouthfeel.  Not one part of the experience of this beer lacks flavor.  Yes, that means a full body, this is one of the most full-bodied beers I've ever tasted.  An aggressive beer that doesn't even think of holding back.  Most are not worthy of this brew.  I say bring on the arrogance!"
"Thanks to Xlperro for the sample.  Nice dark color with a thick tanish head.  Nice hop smell.  I first notice the citrusy grassy hops, yet the maltiness is right there too.  Great drinkability, I could drink this all night, if it wasn't for the 7+ alcohol. I love it."
"Arrogant Bastard: damn straight I’m worthy.  Huge beer, hops, malts, aroma and alcohol.  Seems a little rough around the edges, but a balanced taste.   Long lasting cider/coffee aftertaste, and  alcohol warmth.  Very nice."
"This is one harsh and  potent beer, but quite good at the same time. It pours a dark brown color with a nice fizzy light brown head. The brew smells very hoppy with a slight spice hint. The first sip leaves the mouth exploding in hop flavor. then suddenly the mouth is overwhelmed by a fruity grapefruit flavor mixed with clove. The beer finishes very harsh, but not in a bad way. This would be a good beer for a cool fall night."
"Another great beer from Stone.  And you're surprised?"
"Oh baby, this is a fantastic beer. Beautiful rich copper/brown with a frothy tan head; luscious. Exceptional fruity aromas, almost tropical, with some grapefuit balanced by some caramel sweetness. Taste is also fruity (guava?), grapefruity, slightly piney. Huge malt backbone in this beer gives it a sweetness that envelopes your tongue. But in the end hops rule, and the beer finishes with a bitter hop twang that makes you wonder whether you're worthy. I am, dammit."
"The first thing I noticed was intense pineapple and grapefruit smells.   Grapefuit was very obvious in the mouth as was some pleasing malt sweetness that was kept in check by a fair amount of bitterness.  Mouthfeel was slightly lighter than the bottled version."
"I was expecting a butt kicking hop explosion from this bastard, which would of been excellent, but to my surprise there was enough malt backbone to highlight but not overpower the superb bitterness. Fruity and medium bodied with an initial grapefruit rind bitterness followed by some caramel and toasted grains, this was deceptively light and refreshing giving it's relatively high alcohol content. Finished with more flavorful but curiously balanced hop notes. I could of pounded a few of these, but it was too far to walk home."
"Heed the warning on the label non-believers, because this is one tough beer that is only meant for the big boys. The pour was dark and thick, the head was dark and thick, and the taste is like a malt explosion in your mouth. Stone is probably the God's of mixing water, hops, malt and yeast together. They haven't failed me yet."
"Creamy, thick light tan sticky head tops a dark ruby hued brew w/ excellent clarity.  Countable rings of bubbles interconnected by lace is left down the glass.  Quite attractive.  The aroma is a combination of a citrus hop nose and dark caramel malt, biscuit malt and a hint of diacetyl.  Mild hints of roasted grain are present as well.  Assertive hop bitterness hits the palate initially, but quickly gives way to a fairly rich malt profile comprised of deep caramel and toffee, buttery malt, and mellow dark fruity esters.  The piney chinook hop flavor is not obtrusive, and melds well with the caramel malt and hints of darker roasted barley.  Overall the flavor balance is skewed towards hop bitterness and flavor, but only slightly.  Full in body, w/ well calculated smooth carbonation that helps accenuate the malt profile.  Finishes w/ toasted malt quickly fading and clean hop bitteress lingering.  Arrogant Bastard is an aggressively hopped brew with a rich malt foundation.  It's not unlike Red Rocket ale, albeit with less roasted barley and a slightly higher hop bitterness.  Very tasty."
"untill the next day.  Friday I pour it into a pilsner glass and witness a beautiful glass of beer.  The color was a nice copper,  the head was thick and foamy with tight small bubbles and the stayed on and didn't dissipate at all.  The taste was so smooth I couldn't believe I was drinking 7.2 % ale.  This beer is so well brewed I could find no faults with.  I am not sure if there are some Cigar smokers out there, if so this is the beer to enjoy with your best cigars.    FS."
"Great deep copper color. Tastes much different than I expected. Upon the look, it looks like it would be very heavy but it actually isn't. Don't get me wrong,this beer is strong and very bitter and hoppy. It is one of the most perfectly balanced beers I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. I much prefer it alone because food tends to alter the great taste. Brilliant! Perfect!"
"The body is a hazy orangish-copper with crimson highlights, and its full and foamy tan head holds quite well. It drops to a thin 1/4"" that remains throughout the first half of the glass, and it leaves dense, clinging rings of lace.The beautiful colr and head make up for any distraction that the haziness might cause the inexperienced taster. The bouquet wafts from the glass loaded with fresh hops (somewhat earthy and leafy, but also clearly citrusy... Goldings and Cascade?) over rich caramel malt. The firm body is accentuated by an exceptionally fine carbonation and it's smooth and creamy in the mouth. The flavor is rich and fairly complex with a sweet caramel and lightly fruity malt note up-front that combines with earthy and citrusy hop flavors as it crosses the palate. It finishes with a firm, drying bitterness and residual earthy and leafy hop flavors. If there's anything that hinders it's drinkability (apart from the fact that it's a full-charged malt & hop attack!) it's the 7.2% alcohol by volume. I may not be able to drink more than two, but I want to drink more than two! Well worth seeking out!"
"275"
"Aside - Thanks to the guy who decided we WERE worthy to try this beer and hauled a keg up from Pennsylvania to his place for a bunch of us to enjoy."
"Pours a firm rocky head, with very small bubbles of carbonation topping an appealing amber/brown liquid. Nose is slightly sulphur-y, taste is very hoppy and a bit fruity...every hopheads delight. Lots of the lovely bitter flowers are evident in this beer Finish is malt, sulphur, alcohol & hops...very long. A nice super-hopped ale...cool silkscreened bottle, too!"
"Not impressed with this beer. I heard so much and maybe expected to much. I didn't like the beer in general. It was different, but not my cup of tea!"
"I had heard about this brew from a friend of mine at work.  He had met the owner of the brewery and told me that the breer was named appropriately.  I found it on tap at my favorite bar.  I thought I was ready for the intense flavor of this beer....I was wrong.  The hops were intense and the citrus aroma was excellent.  The malt helps to offset the inital assult of the hops to make it a well balanced brew.  Not fot the faint of heart."
"A very deep amber/red colored beer that forms a decent head white head that left trace lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt and hops with some caramel elements. It has an interesting flavor to it. A flavor of malt, hops and carmel. A bit stronger than I like my beers unless they're heavier to offset the taste of alcohol. So the finish was a bit heavy alcohol wise, but still another fine Stone product.c"
"You don't really get many beers like this.  Strong and at times overwhelming, this beer is everything it reputed to be.  One has to love hops to enjoy this one.  What makes this beer really different from other seriously hoppped beers, is it's texture.  Full- with even a slight sweetness that kicks you, hard.  I used to drink this more then I lived in San Francisco-a must try for any beer lover."
"Its an attitude."
"This brew is huge, and hugely complex.  A deep reddish-amber color with a decent tan head and some lace down the side of the glass.  Smell and taste are almost overwhelming, but still nicely balanced between an initial burst of caramel maltiness and a citrusy hop bitterness in the finish.  The alcohol content is evident.  I wish more of Stone's products were available in my neck of the woods.  This is an impressive accomplishment."
"Deep, dark amber color with a cappucino head.  Not strongly scented (out of the fridge) then BAM! take a drink.  Strong malt taste but stronger hops - heavy on both, but perfect ratio.  Gets slightly caramel sweet when warmer.  Surprisingly, the name is not just a gimick - this brew lives up to its name."
"Usually I try to go into detail of all my ratings but this one has overwhelmed me and left me somewhat speechless.  Great creamy malty body but a great hoppy character that more than balances.  Stone certainly brews some seriouslly hardcore brews and this one might be the flagship for that quality.  Damn fine brew and highly recommended."
"Stone is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries.  Top 5 maybe Top 3 in my book right now."
"I can't say I love this beer but I can say that I liked it. It is pretty good, but almost peculiar at first taste. I detected a strong taste of grapefruit in this brew coming from the hops yet has a strong malty backbone to balance it out. Did I say ""balance"" in an AB review? . It has a very nice appearance of caramel color brew with a 3 finger head that shrunk down but lasted to the last drop [maybe I drank it too fast ;-) ]. I also liked the bottle for the size, the content and the label. Maybe they are using a little reverse psychology on some unsuspecting peeps. It was however, a fun experience. Cheers to the brewery brave enough to be bold!"
"So what's up with this ""you're not worthy"" shite? I say bring on the Double Bastard!"
"I don't know if it was just my imagination, but I detected the scent and taste of pineapple and just couldn't get past it.  I like hops, but found the hoppiness of this beer a bit overwhelming.  It probably would age well, but I guess the point of the whole exercise is to get smacked in the face right now."
"Watch out, this one will smack you upside the head if you're not ready.  Pours with a big tan head, the beer is ruby brown in color.  Smells sweet, citric, alcoholy and slightly musty, which is odd beacuse this beer should have been fresh (I ordered it online at Beer on the Wall and tried it three days after receiving it).  Almost no carbonation.  From the first sip the alcohol makes its presence known.  Bitter throughout with a nutty-bitter slightly astringent aftertaste, which really lingers.  A faint mustiness can be tasted, which seems odd and out of place.  A real hoppy kick in the crotch.  I wanted to like this beer more, and I consider myself a hophead, but it was a little too bitter/astringent without enough balancing maltiness for me."
"rerate 8-29-02: It's only been a few months since my original rating and already the ""overwhelming bitterness"" has changed to easily palateable bitterness. Nice creamy foam pitted head this time. Too dark to be called off-white. Body is reddish brown, nice but not exceptional. Aroma is some sweet malt and a slightly pine-liek hop bite. Flavor bites first, a little interesting maltiness in the middle and some fruitiness (I could have sworn it was peach there a couple of times, but it became more vague after that) It ends with a fairly short, bitter finish."
"Son of a B1@tc#  Like a bouquet of flowers and garden hops on the nostrils.  Dark amber brownish in color with a caramel colored head, the bubbles have a look of an oil slick to them.  Starts off semi sweet and malty then turns down right bitter in the finish.  The flavor lasts and lasts minutes after you swig.  This brew has the most fitting name.  Complex and has tons of character.  Even though the drinkability is a joke, it deserves high marks because of this paradox.  Great winter brew!"
"At first you might think the bottle is half of the appeal, but then you find a joint that serves Arrogant Bastard on tap and you relaize that this is one of the world's best beers. From the smell to the taste to crazy things you do after four or five pints, this beer is first class. Really, all of Stone's beers are great, but there is just a little something extra about this one. But then, I am always a sucker for a big, hoppy faux-IPA type of ale. Aren't you?"
"I love this beer. Agressive hops with enough malt to back it up. Not for everyone but it is one for me. I feel it is more of a stong ale than an IPA but it is a fine hair to split. This beer has soo much going on sometimes it is hard not to be overwhelmed."
"I guess I'm ""not worthy"" of this beer, as the bottle states.  It had a lot going for it, a distinctive citrus note at the front and an assertive hops finish.  For some reason, however, this beer did not win me over.  Maybe I was just intimidated."
"Notes: Hugely complex. Its arrogance is indeed correct. As stated on the label, if you do not have the ""taste or sophistication to be able to appreciate an ale of this quality and depth"" then you may not like it. Or rather, go drink your safe beer wimp. It's rather aggressive, but oh so damn good (in an evil, not worthy way). Just beware before you drink. This beer is not for the faint of heart."
