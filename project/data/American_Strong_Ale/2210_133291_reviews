"Served in my GI tulip at 46 degrees.  Pours the color and clarity of cola with a rocky, two-inch, cream-colored head embedded with tiny pinpricks.  Heady eventually settles into a consistent slick leaving swaths and spots of lacing as it recedes.  Nose expresses toffee, caramelized sugar and ethanol.  Taste consistent with nose - the caramel/toffee presence really pops and lingers between quaffs; it's almost sickeningly sweet.  Figs and prunes become evident as the beer starts to warm.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body, but closer to medium, with a mild, even carbonation and a slightly oily texture.  Overall, quite good but not my favorite blend - best shared amongst 4-6.  A little goes a long way."

"O: Pretty ridiculous brew. One of the heaviest and sweetest ever. Huge booziness but somehow that doesn't even cut it down, it just makes it even more absurd. Pretty much every kind of malty flavor imaginable. Chocolate, vanilla, caramel, toffee, fruits and just plain ole sugar. Big and bold but the flavors are fairly well balanced. The sweetness however, is not."

"Amazing what these guys can create with a blend of beers. Truly amazing stuff."

"Overall:  Oh God, I thought §ucaba was FW’s pinnacle achievement.  Sorry, whalez, I’m a fan of tuna now.  It actually feels heretical to give this less than 5 stars... how about them apples?"

"Firestone Anniversaries have always been one of my favorites; each year the brew is full of rich flavors and lovely complexities and it is a pleasure to try and pick out which characteristics came from which of my favorite seasonal and year round Firestone brews. This year did not disappoint. The review is of my third bottle, cellared for 6 months. Pour is pretty standard of this kind of beer, dark and ominous. Light wheat colored tinges seen through light. Smell is pretty interesting: if the beer is still very cold, the first thing I notice is tequila and agave.  As it warms this transforms to smooth coconut and vanilla followed by heavy thick chocolate and coffee. Taste is nothing short of exquisite, delicious brandy filled chocolates melting in your mouth. Lots of different things to focus on and enjoy. Feel is full body, smooth and thick, coats every part of your mouth. Overall one of the greats, can't wait to try another one in a year or so."

"Drank my bomber over two different nights and enjoyed the second glass even more than the first. Highly recommended."

"One of the top 10 beers I have ever tasted. Truly exceptional and unlike any other beer."

"A winner."

"Had this on draft at Churchill's. Way way way too much cinnamon/syrup. Might be solid in several years after that mellows"
""
""
"Yet another decadent and delicious entry to the Anniversary series. Might be my favorite to date. Rich and complex and blended to perfection."
""
"To quote someone else on beer advocate, ""Daddy like."" An indescribable beer, with a very prominent rating. Well worth the premium price of $22/22oz."

"Wanted to give this one a try and break away from the ipa's and stouts I drink, but not a fan of the bourbon aged beers."

"Overall, this is one complex beast. Baller status"
""
"Overall - Complex as hell, but approachable all things considered. Has a noticeable sourness that doesn't quite fit with the overall theme, but an interesting experience nonetheless."
""
""
"On tap at back bar of Monk's for their charity event. Spectacular anniversary ale that won't last too long. Great bourbon flavors."
"Overall: One of the better anniversary ales FW has put out. Worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
""
"Another amazing blend from FW. I think 17 might have been slightly better, but this was still so tasty due to how much it leans on Parabola."
""
""
""
""
"Delicious like Parabola. Awesome aroma. Fantastic as it warms. Very smooth and velvety. Not very hot at all. Superb."

"A great beer. The caramel notes along with roasty malts make this a fantastic super blend form the Firestone barrel series"

"Another quality anniversary from FW.  Very tasty, better as it warmed.  If memory serves me correct, I liked this better than 17."

""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Tastes mostly just like Parabola"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Wow - it will be even better in a year or two."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A pretty big disappointment compared to previous FW anniversary beers and in light of the ever-growing price tag. Will probably just look for this on-tap in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The heavy dose of Parabola really did this beer well. One of the best barrel beers that Firestone has offered up."

"Wow! What a complex beer to savor.  Beers like this are why I am into craft beer.  Smell is of deep oak and toffee.  Taste is multiple layers of oak, bourbon, toffee, caramel, and a touch of dark chocolate.  Alcohol is there, but surprisingly subtle.  This is in my top 5.  Such an amazing beer.  Really happy to have found this on draft."

"O – Incredibly complex, very boozy, very malty.  Great flavors but very intense.  Not an easy drinker but a hell of a beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Another excellent FW brew. Although I prefer the parts to the whole. In this one it is definitely a treat to be savored."
"So smooth. Lots of Parabola, bourbon, dried dark fruits, sugars… glad I have one more. Epic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's good, but perhaps overly Parabola-y. Recommended! I've really enjoyed the entire of Anniversary Ales, save for the 16."
""
"M - Full bodies.  Thick and creamy.  Light to moderate carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow, let this warm up. More than most beers, this one really, really evolves as it warms. It's almost a completely different beer now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweet tobacco, oak, bourbon, vanilla.  Very complex.  Obviously let this one warm up a good bit."
"Don't drink it fast, and enjoy!"

"A truly incredible brew that has one of the greatest taste you will ever experience! Very expensive, but well worth it! Drink it only with your closest friends who deserve it."

"Awesome, just awesome.  FW is at the top of the list for barrel aged beer. Should have bought two, hopefully I can still find one.  Can't wait for 19."

"Bottle. I have noticed this anniversary offering from Firestone Walker has the highest percentage of Parabola I can remember. This anniversary brew pours darker than most I remember from FW. It is a very dark brown. Tan, thin,  oily head. As anticipated, the nose is intense. Like a low rolling nimbus cloud of aroma. The barrel influence is as important as any aspect of the nose. Vanilla, roast, coconut, wood, burnt sugar and caramel. Boozy fig, plum and raisin. Aerated chocolate. The flavor slides right in where the nose left off. Dark fruit layered in roast and some bitter chocolate. Rich caramel, brown sugar candy sugar. A bit of coconut. Intense, yet regal barrel flavor. Not just oak or bourbon; barrel complexity. Finishes with a dense, decadent feel. Medium carbonation. Lots of body. Alcohol is noticeable but works well with all the barrel character. I have come to expect greatness from these FW offerings. No surprise, they have done it again."
"Drink- I will say that it was good. It was a solid beer and that FW always does a good job. It wasnt the best of the Anny series I have had, but thats only because I like stouts better than strong ale blends. Wonder how this one will age as I always say."

"Not as complex as some other vintages, but still as glorious as ever"
""
"This is pretty solid, and I'd say better than XVII.  It is very well balanced and none of the individual portions dominated the flavor profile.  A downside is that it was significantly more expensive than last year."

"good, not great firestone walker"
"Draft into a shifter.  Dark purple near black with 3 full fingers of tan head that linger.  Lacing throughout.  Excellent looking beer.  Smells of toffee, dark fruits (maybe raisins or prunes, dark cherries), milk chocolate and roasted malts.  Taste is much the same but with complex oak and bourbon overtones.  Comes to life as it warms up.   More complexity.  Little bourbon burn aftertaste with little to no hoppiness.  Chewy and thicker than I expected.  Very complex but very smooth.  Lots of flavors colliding.  Very boozy and strong.  Nice sipping beer to enjoy over 30 minutes or so.  Top notch."

"2 22 oz. bottles from Wed., 12/31/2014 (Niciu 3rd Annual NYE Party) purchased from potential one of several retail shops in the district, 2014 vintage (obviously), poured into plastic cup, drank over ~30 minutes"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours slick dark brown. A few tiny bubbles, not much head. Aroma has a lot going on. Tobacco, chocolate, vanilla and bourbon. A touch of spice and charred meat in the taste compliment the tons of vanilla and chocolate. Boozy finish towards the back of the mouth. Fantastic!"

"I prefer parabola. A little too sweet"
""
""
""
"Seemed a little thin when cold but really opened up nicely into a rich but not heavy beer when warm."
""
""
""
""
"Bourbon oak and toffee notes burnt sugars and vanillas and hints of brandy fucking delicious and oddly stings my tongue love it"
""
""
""
""
"O - A nice Anniversary offering from Firestone Walker.  Not currently better than the sum of its parts but better than the 17th anniversary and it may integrate more given time.  Recommended given that it is a little pricey."
""
""
"what an amazing beer very very very strong smell of whisky caramel and chocolate and the taste is about the same at first a lot of whiskey follow by sweet caramel and finishing with a nice cocoa flavor very very very good beer the best anniversary from Firestone Walker that I have had yet"
""
"Poured into a Firestone Walker snifter. Pours a very dark, nearly opaque brown with a thin khaki head that dissipates to patches, with slippery light lacing.  Aroma of bourbon, dark fruit, vanilla, hints of nuts and chocolate, dominated by the bourbon barrel elements, very appealing. Flavor is wonderfully integrated dark dried and fresh fruit, vanilla, oak wood, bourbon, caramel, pale malt, and a hint of grassy hops. Finishes with bourbony dark caramel malt and a hint of molasses. Medium to heavy bodied, nearly syrupy. Complex but balanced, the flavors are well melded.The high ABV shows through even the dense flavor of this, but mostly as bourbon and toffee. Delicious. My choice for this New Year's Eve on the day I retired from work. I didn't regret it from the moment I opened the bottle."
"I'm completely blown away. Firestone has done it again. The only problem I have with this beer is I didn't get more than 1. Do yourself a favor and drink this now"
""

""

""

"Tend to  grab these out of a curiosity, but they really turned this one up a notch and made a real memorable one.  Might be one for the memory bank to file about boy I remember back when.  Nearly perfect, but highly memorable."

"O- A great beer for sure. Let it warm up for best results.  I was hoping for more barrel, and more of Parabola to come through, which I personally did not get.  I liked this better than Firestone 12th Anniversary, though."

"O-I don't know how Firestone decides on the blend for these beers, but they got it right with 18. This is a monster beer and one glass will sip with pleasure for hours, but it doesn't get cloying or overly sweet like some beers in this category. I wish I bought another bottle...."
""
"Firestone walker best one yet."
""
""
""
"This beer really defies categorization with the attributes of multiple styles coming through. I loved how the sweet vanilla and caramel aspects of a barley wine or old ale married with the roasty chocolate and coffee notes of a stout. Certainly a big beer but surprisingly drinkable and not overly heavy on the palate. Mixing so many different flavors could result in a bit of a mess but FW did such a great job here. Wish I had another one for the cellar!"

"22oz bottle purchased for around $22. Dark brown, almost black, head at first and then nothing. Very nice aromas of bourbon barrels, sugar, vanilla, booze. Flavor was a lot of Parabola, boourbon barrel, stout, brown sugar, and a hint of hoppiness which must be form the Jacks in there. Pretty much what I would expect from Firestone Walker, delicious barrel aged blended strong ale."

"When I was younger, I used to occasionally combine--in a semi-arbitrary manner--several different kinds of soda from a fountain in the restaurants or dining halls I frequented.  The result tended to be a rather delicious mix--even, at times, a ""mess""--of dissimilar and contrasting flavors.  This beer is just like that.  I know that FW, in crafting this beer annually, wants to create something that is ""better than the sum of its parts.""  It may or may not succeed in this each and every year; but regardless, the mere sum of those parts is exceptional."
""
""
"Really, really solid. The only knock is that it isn't as viscous as some people might like in such a big, rich beer."
""
"Overall: I had to try this when I heard it was 38% Parabola (which I love) and this does not disappoint, mind-blowing beer, a definite winner, I am going to have to pick up a few bottles for the cellar, at least two. A bit pricey at $24 but definitely worth it, amazing beer must try if you love BA stouts like Parabola or just BA beers in general."
""
""
""
"Lighter body than a straight up imperial stout but still rich and creamy. Very solid. Amazing effort. Still figuring out the complexity in this."
"Overall this is another wonderful crafting by the good folks and their friends at FWBC.  I have to say this is the brew I look forward to the most every year...and that is saying a lot!"

"Good beer. Lighter in flavor than DBA or Parabola. Some wine notes to Ale."

"I've had each Anniversary Ale since 15, and this one is the best in my opinion."

""

""
""
""
""

"Pours a dark, dark brown with a slight burgundy. Smell is very heavy on the booze and wood. There are hints of vanilla, and figs, there is also a slight amount of earthy hop presence on the nose. Holy shit is tastes amazing. Toffee, vanilla, caramel, bourbon. It's creamy too, so creamy. This is the best barrel aged beer I've had. No contest."

"These beers are always amazing, no one blends beer outside of Belgium quite like Firestone.  Will be interesting to see how this changes over time."
""
""
""
"Overall: a strong release. I think the presence of IPA, even in such a small amount, made a pleasant balance against the heavy weights, it was pretty drinkable."
""
"Overall: Another good FW Anniversary beer.  This one appeals to me because the Parabola in the blend asserts itself fairly well.  I loved XVII and am a big fan of XVIII.  I will hang on to some of my bottles to revisit this in a year or so."
