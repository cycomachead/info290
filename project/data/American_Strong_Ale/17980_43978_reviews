"Up front, sweet qualities, maple syrup, wrapped up by brown sugar and caramel. Just a pure maple candy treat. The ABV is well hidden under that sweetness."

"Overall, just an outstanding ale, unlike anything else.  Brewed by the very best!"

"Out of this world! Best VT beer I've had to date! That is saying something. This beer is well worth the price of admission. Thank God above I showed up at the warren store on the right day!"

"Overall this was a very interesting beer that I'm excited I got to try. I'm not always a fan of dark tripels so I was not wowed. Will try this again when I can get it fresh to compare to this almost year old bottle."

"Got this from a great friend who lives in Vermont!  Bottle 845 of 1500.  Beautiful, slightly hazy dark mahogany pour with a two finger creamy beige head with decent retention and great lacing.  The nose is incredible with huge maple notes along with hints of brown sugar, caramel, brown bread, molasses, vanilla, and toffee.  The taste is incredibly rich with the maple once again the star.  Hints of raisins were a surprise, complemented nicely with sweet brown bread, oak, toffee, caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, booze, and just a touch of chocolate.  The mouthfeel  is thick and syrupy with subtle creaminess, and a warming, somewhat cloying finish.  Overall, while this is borderline too sweet, it's so full of flavor, and it's got just enough balance to compensate for any faults.  Highly recommended!"

"Pours a hazy orange-brown with no head. No lacing on the drink down. Smell is of malt, maple, brown sugar, caramel, and toffee aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, maple, and slight cardboard flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of earth bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with a nice smell, but the flavors are slightly oxidized at this point."
"The beer pours a dark hazy amber (no chunks of yeast) with a thin halo of white head around the perimeter. The nose is sweet (unexpected notes of lactose-like dairy sweetness?), distinct maple and yeast, minimal alcohol, no bitterness. The taste is maple forward (as hoped) with a hint of fruit and yeast, and a slight bitterness in the finish (more woody than hoppy). The mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly syrupy (some carbonation, generous sap sweetness), but not chewy, has smooth maple goodness, masked alcohol, and a slightly dry bitterness in the finish. This beer is fantastic to drink, especially if you're a maple fan, but I'll have trouble justifying the price again in the future."

"I've actually had this before, but I'm just getting around to reviewing it now, as I brought out a bottle to share at SS'14. This is truly one of the most unique beers in existence. Pours a deep bronzed amber color, not really hazy, but ""glossy," if that makes sense...like looking through a thick piece of colored glass. A small yellow-tan head sinks to a ringlet and a swirl leaves some legs on the glass. Rich, dark sugars in the aroma, caramel and maple sap, woody and slightly boozy. Luscious taste reflects the nose, caramel, maple, some vanilla sweetness, some woodiness, and a stiff boozy kick, but that component melds well with the rest of the flavors, giving a sensation of a maple liqueur more than any other kind of booze. Medium-full body, mouthfeel is smooth and slick, syrupy, and can be on the hot side. Previous versions I've had have been a bit more hot with booze, but this particular bottle--aged only a few months after I bought it--was really nice and smooth, and the alcohol heat was toned down. I seriously could've easily conquered this bottle by myself with no problem. The price tags on these bottles are on the higher side, but it's understandable considering the recipe, and it's also worth every penny."

"Such an unique beer, the concept behind it is really cool. Authentic Vermont maple syrup used to make beer instead of water. Its sweet and syrupy on the mouthfeel, which is what I expected. This is a really cool novelty that I don't think I would want more than 6-8 ounces of every year."

"Overall: Fantastic use of maple in a beer. I really liked this beer alot. Another winner from Lawsons!"

"O- Definitely a solid offering from a great brewer. A bit too boozy in my opinion. I was lucky enough to have an older vintage ( I want to say 09?) at three penny back in may, and it was a lot less boozy than this one. Still solid, but not as great as that one."

"O- This is a great beer if you like maple, I think some age could help it all along for sure, will probably keep a bottle to try again in another couple of years."
"This beer is well worth the $25 price tag."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Reminiscent of bourbon Fred/Maple bourbon Fred. Missing a few components to take it over the edge for me - namely some better carbonation and a touch more smoothness. Still worth trying."
"Overall - This is a great brew that any fan of maple should try, this is more like a maple wine or something, a hybrid of sorts. Great brew."

"O - Sweet caramel and maple candy-like and very tasty."

"Overall - Maple is beer magic, but there's no way I could drink more than a few ounces of this."

"Pours a tawny, coppery color with an off white near finger of head. Aroma was rich, sweet caramel and maple nuts and dark malts. Similar taste, sweet, maple-y, caramel, sweet nuts. Full bodied, not too thick, not cloying either, though inherently rich and decadent. Would like to get another bottle and age it longer. I really enjoyed it."
""
"O - A sweet maple beer with a nice dark fruit presence that adds some complexity. This really wasn't as sweet as I expected it to be when you hear a beer that is essentially fermented maple. This is an interesting one that I was happy to try; however, I thought it was only OK and didn't really impress me too much."
""
""
""
""

"OVERALL: This was way different than I'd expected. It is definitely on the sweeter side of the spectrum with maple syrup flavors for sure, but it is not a maple bomb by any means. Nicely balanced and quite complex with the oak barrel adding a level of flavor to the brew. An interesting and enjoyable ale, though the nose would need to be more impressive for top marks here. Definitely one I'd jump at again if given the opportunity. Thanks again jbeatty!"
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a light level of carbonation. This was a very nice dessert-like brew that was downright crushable. For 12%, this brew drinks at an alarming rate. I think I killed half my glass before composing a single thought and writing any notes. The price point on this is a bit rough but christ, after having it I would not be able to say no to buying this if the opportunity presented itself. Thank you Heath for sharing this with me!"

"O: A very interesting beer. I applaud Lawsons being innovative using maple sap/syrup instead of water. Quite drinkable for the abv with a nice flavor profile."
"500ml corked and caged bottle into a couple of snifters. April 2011. #360/374. Pours copper with a thin white head. Leaves back light spotty lace that slowly drips down the sides. The aroma is SWEET! I’m talking maple syrup, brown sugar, caramel, sugary dough and fruit. I’m pleased to find that is isn’t cloying in the nose however, as the complexity keeps things very interesting. The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, very sugary on the palate but with more help from those fruity esters and some extra boozy sweetness from the ABV. The mouthfeel is fuller bodied and quite chewy on the tongue. This feels about 12% but doesn’t sting, as those aforementioned flavors eat up a lot of the booze presence here. I really liked this. I initially thought the sweetness was going to get to be too much at first but the overall complexity of this really grew on me the further I got into the glass."

"O: Perhaps this could have used a bit more age but this is a mighty fine dessert sipper right now. If you love sweets you love this. Thanks again Michael."
"Overall: Maple Tripple Ale is a fantastic beer and certainly one of the most interesting brews I have had. I thought that the lack of water would make this a little too sweet and syrupy to enjoy in quantity, but I could easily have hammered a second bottle and maybe even a third had it not been mid summer! I will certainly be looking for another bottle or two of this to put away in the cellar."

"O- This was an interesting, unique, and well crafted offering from Lawson's. I have pure Vermont Maple Syrup pretty much every week and you can definitely tell that this was crafted with it. Pure Maple syrup is very sweet and sugary, but this beer had a nice balance of it that coupled well with the Belgian yeasts used. It was very sweet and sugary, but not overly so that it was unappetizing. It did have a tiny bit of heat to it, but I felt like it went well with the beer a nice slight maple liquor feel to it. Definitely a sipper, especially considering the price. I definitely recommend checking this out, but it's probably not something I would drink all the time. I can see this aging very well although probably not improving significantly"

"O - Overall this wasnt a bad tripel. Like Jared said its almost as if they dumped a bunch of maple syrup into a bear and couldnt figure out what else to do so uhhh...belgian yeast?"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall nice, more like they threw in a ton of maple and couldn't figure out what to call it, so they threw in a few Belgian triple malts and yeast flavors to call it a maple triple, but fairly tasty."

"Just a pretty cool beer… Well done sir."
""

"O- An innovative beer that cannot truly be categorized. There are very few beers that are ""out there"" and this is one of them."

"o - overall, VERY impressed. kind of like a braggot. different, but damn tasty!"

"A good beer for sharing, I dunno if I would drink 12oz all to myself, but I'd be down to try, but its a gem more worth sharing, so thanks for sharing james! My favorite tripel, if it counts as a tripel. . ."
"Pours thick and dark golden, no head to speak of; legs trail slowly down the sides of the glass. Looks pretty much like pure maple syrup. Aroma follows suit. Before tasting I know this will be the most heavily maple-flavored beer I’ve ever had and it sure is. Hard to call it beer, almost. Flavor of mildly boozy maple syrup. Not many other flavor notes discernible. Brown sugar, caramel maltiness, very faint floral hops which contribute a subtle bitterness. Thick, chewy, and slightly cloying, a bit sticky, quite sweet, totally unique. What can I say? I loved it. If you are a maple fan this is hands down the one beer you have to try. If you don’t like sweet beers or maple flavor you should steer far clear."

"O–By far the best beer I have ever had. It is most similar to Avery's 2011 Beast but it somehow avoids all of that beers small imperfections. The beauty of the beer is the complexity that comes out of its simplicity. It has 4 ingredients (concentrated maple sap, barley, yeast and hops) and they come together in a way that surpassed my very high expectations"

"Overall: Very enjoyable, although I don't think I could do more than a few ounces."

"Pours a clear, viscous burnt amber color with a trace amount of white head with no retention or lacing. Nose is caramel and maple, sappy and sticky, with light dark fruit and some traces of oak. Some alcohol heat, but not distracting. Syrupy body, low carbonation, sticky and dense on the palate. Raw maple and burnt sugar sweetness hits the front of the palate and persists throughout. Finishes dries out a little with light oak and pleasant warming alcohol. For such a big, unusual beer, this never veers to becoming cloying or too boozy. A novelty, but surprising well balanced and drinkable."
"Pours a deep golden color with a nearly-non-existent off-white head and a few bubbles on top. The nose carries strong notes of maple and plenty of malty sweetness. Not much depth, but the maple presence is quite nice. The flavor follows the same pattern -- smooth maple with a bit of heat through the back-end. So much maple it tastes a bit woody. Medium-full syrupy body with low carbonation and a touch of booze. Well done, but hard to have more than a few ounces of."
"O - For what it claims to be, it's incredible. Others said they wanted to just sip a few oz., but with my sweet tooth, I'm pretty sure I could put away a whole bottle. To get that much maple flavor into a beer is an incredible feat. Get this!"
""
""
""
"O - Just simply excellent! The time in the bottle has definitely done this beer some good. The booze is so smooth and the maple syrup is the perfect compliment, without going over-board on the sweetness. Recommend!"
"D - A definite sipper, but highly enjoyable stuff with a nice blend of sweetness, warming alcohol, and barrel flavors. Don't open this without a few people to share, as it's more of a 4oz after-dinner kind of drink."
"Overall, this was a fantastic beer. One of my favorite tripels. Very drinkable and very unique. This was a real treat!"

"Poured from a bomber into a sampler. Wow. What a treat. Thank god for generosity and kindness. Pours a maple syrup golden brown with minimal head. The nose is all maple. Sooo lovely. The taste mirrors the nose entirely. Rich maple, vanilla, and a touch of bourbon. The mouthfeel is smooth as silk. Could hold this in my mouth for forever. Top notch beer."
"Wow, taste is very maple and sweet, it isn't cloying or syrupy though which is nice and makes it surprisingly drinkable. Mothfeel is very rich and full with light carbonation, quite good!"
"Overall: For a 12% brew aged in an oak soaked liquor barrel it drinks very well! Glad I picked up a few bottles as this one should be fun to age for a few years!"
"Thanks to Thirstybird for generously sharing this brew. 500ml bottle - #353 of 374. Served in a chalice. Pours a hazy amber with a quarter inch, loose, khaki-colored head that dissipates into a skim. As to be expected, the nose has a huge maple syrup presence, but it's not overly cloying. There's also a bit of citrus and a light boozy quality somewhat characteristic of a cordial. Taste consistent with nose - not quite as sweet as maple candy, but it's really quite sweet nonetheless. A subtle citrus acidity cuts the flavor a trace. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an easy carbonation, a slight acidity and a texture that falls just short of oily. This is really an interesting beer; however, it could definitely be bottled in a 7.5oz format similar to what was done with the Bourbon Barrel Aged Fayston Maple Imperial. We split this amongst three and had to revisit it between other offerings. That said, this beer is at its best as it warms to room temperature. A 2.5oz pour would have been perfect."
"Palate is rather hot with alcohol, but also quite sweet. Orange liqueur is big midpalate and then it fades on out into something like a maple sugar candy. White grape (props) and plum wine (props) also come to mind. There are some odd alcohol flavors and aromas here, but the beautiful maple sugar notes on the finish make it all worth while. As it warms the midpalate starts to show more classic Tripel notes."
"Light copper gold color with no head whatsoever. Theres evidence of a decent amount of carbonation judging by the bubbles floating up the sides of the glass, but actual amount was just right. I found it amazing how this beer was not overly thick based on the use of maple syrup, moreso how it was perfectly viscous. It was sweet enough to let you know what the ingredients were, but not so overbearing that you couldnt drink it. There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever of the ~10 ABV, merely a pleasant sweet heat. i wish i had more of a serving, but glad i got to share with a few appreciative folk. Absolutely worth seeking out."
"I attended a beer info session with Sean Lawson at the Vermont Brewer's Festival in Burlington, VT this past July 2010. At the session, Sean Lawson gave out samples of his Maple Tripple Ale which he stated was brewed with 100% pure maple sap. The beer sample was paired with a gorgonzola cheese. The beer was an amber color and had a strong aroma of maple which overpowered any other scent coming from the beer. The alcohol was well-hidden with this beer. The beer was a bit thick to the taste and was sweet, but not as sweet as the strong aroma of maple would imply. The taste was very unique and very good. It is quite the beer treat and I highly recommend trying it if given the opportunity."
"Deep amber color - exactly that of Grade A Medium Amber syrup. Aroma is of maple and a certain woody scent. Sean claims no wood-aging involved to contribute that. Nicely balanced between sweet & dry; hops are very low-key. Flavor is all maple & wood, with toffee & caramel notes. Not astringently dry like many sap beers. Finish is long and of maple candy - but not sweet, thankfully. As with many sap & maple beers, there can be a flavor of wood that imitates maple wood aroma - but very subtle. An utterly captivating beer."
"The carbonation is mild, but leaves a sticky, lip smacking feeling though quite mellow for the alcohol content. Could I drink more than one of these in a sitting I ask myself? No I could not as the sweetness eventually overcomes the palate. However, it is quite sippable and warming and just the right dessert for a cool, calm, easy-going night in Boston."
"Overall a tasty ale. Not the maple experience I was expecting and a bit of as far as the style goes, but good nonetheless."
