"Pours a deep black with moderate head. Aroma of blueberries and roasted malt. Smooth oatmeal moderated taste with blueberries quickly followed by roasted malt and a lightly bitter finish of the burnt malt. Very easy to drink and enjoyable to the end.  Not a beer for hopheads, but anyone else would enjoy."

"Nose of fresh Blueberries, faint lemon, chocolate, & malt. Taste sweet Blueberries, burnt brown sugar, malt, faint chocolate, bitter finish."
"Pours a deep chocolate brown with minimal fizzy head and decent lacing. Aroma is full of blueberry, kind of halfway between natural and artificial. Taste is decent, light and has a nice blueberry taste up front and in the finish. Once again, the blueberry flavor almost borders on artificial, but nonetheless, it is pretty good. Mouthfeel is nice, with a good amount of carbonation and a good creaminess. Also, a touch chewy. A light bodied stout. 7.50 ABV you can feel the more you drink, slight burn."

"The packaging makes this look like a novelty beer but, this is a solid oatmeal stout with just a hint of blueberry flavor."
""
""
""
""
"This was a nice brew very well balanced and not over powering."
""
"The best part of the beer it the subtle scent of blueberry pancakes when you hover your nose over it. You can barely notice when you drink it but I love this beer."
"O: This one makes me sad. The idea is there for a tasty beverage, the execution falls way short. Flavor and feel just aren't there."
""
""

"The flavor is fine, the texture is too fizzy though."

"A friend brought over a six pack and forgot it in my fridge. Quite a pleasant suprise and hey, it's tough to beat free beer!"

"A screw-top!?! Really?!? I just felt like I went to a lot of unnecessary work and to take out my frustration, I nearly inverted the bottle until I realized what I was doing. At base, it is a stout, so if you do not think that there was a pseudo-cascade going on, you are deluding yourself. It settled into a dense finger of deep-tan head that acted as a cap above the beer. Nose was very fruity, very blueberry, and while I do not enjoy them quite as much as when I was a kid, blueberry pie remains my favorite. Ah, sweet blueberries ... Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Mouthfeel was full, kind of creamy, dense with carbonation. The flavor was more blueberry than stout, so depending on your preference, it may or may not work for you. At this hour, it was working for me since I am positive that I would not have wanted a regular stout just now. The blueberry flavor was very evocative of summer and my youth and nostalgic drinking is one of my favorite things to do. Finish was semi-dry, since blueberries do not tend to be downright sweet anyway and when coupled with a non-sweet stout, they negated it being sweet. Very nice."

"This past summer, I came upon this tasty little brew at my local package store. Being a lover of blueberry flavored beers and stout, I gave it a shot. I was surprised that the blueberry flavor wasn't sickly sweet, and was well-balanced and didn't have a fake flavor to it. The sweetness from the fruit is balanced out with the toast of the stout. I enjoyed the six pack, and went back to buy more. I found it greatly refreshing on a warm day, and it went very well with burgers. My local didn't have any more, so I ordered it. I was told it was a winter seasonal and that I'd have to wait a few months to get more. I happened to buy the last one leftover from the last batch. When I can find it, it's a mainstay in my fridge."
""
"The mouthfeel follows the flavor nicely, smooth all the way as hoped in a mostly full body with some robustness to it. Roast is most noticeable in the feel, actually, leading into a roasty-dry finish. It COULD be a little fuller-bodied and ever so slightly smoother for the style."
""
"I just happen to see this beer on the shelve for the 1st time last Friday after work, so I thought Id try it since I like beer with flavor. It looked good. Well It is good. Good taste smell and 7.5% to boot with no nasty after after taste. Awesome If you like stout beer youll enjoy this brew very much."

"When I first opened the bottle, it was like opening a very high carbonated soda with lots of noise! Pours a dark reddish brown with a thick head that took forever to dissipate. I have never seen this before. The aroma was pleasing with like a wheat blueberry pie. Just one sip and your mouth filled up with the carbonation! Damn Sam! Didn't taste too bad but the excessive carbonation killed it overall. Ended up poring the last 1/4 in the sink."

"I tried one out of the glass, one out of the bottle. To make sure it wasn't me, I gave one to a friend which turned out to be a cruel joke but extremely funny."
""
""
"Nearly black pour with ruby hues at the edges; insane amounts of head, even with a gentle pour. Some sweetness to the smell but blueberries don't stick out in the smell or the taste. Don't get any of the silky smoothness I would expect from an oatmeal stout. A standard stout with not much else going on. Drinkable but nothing special about it."
""
"I got this for a friend when he was in southwest Wisconsin. I traded him a beer since I never tried this but he did warn me about the huge head and he was right. These bottles probably went through a second fermentation because the bottle cap had a lot of force behind it and even with a slow pour there was 5 times more head than beer. The aroma is still sweet with malts and blueberries. There are some robust flavors mixed with sweet blueberries but this is way too yeasty and it almost has more of a Belgian texture. Oh well as least I got to try it, but I’m sure that this is not the way it is suppose to taste."
""
"This was a let down, which was pretty much on par with my expectations. The stout flavors were just lacking. Nothing really off about it, and its pretty drinkable."
""

"Presentation: Packaged in a short twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a twist-off crown,, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
"overall - I can't figure out how this beer mustered an 80ish? I feel bamboozled. Conclusion? Non beer drinking, fruit loving, Stella Artois praising yuppies have sampled this concoction and deduced its dessert sounding name equated to a decadent brew. Steer clear stout lovers, don't make the same mistake as I did. Anyone want to buy 22 more of these?"
"Got a 6 pack of bottles, first one not quite cold, so it went down the drain when it got too warm for my taste. Second one turned out to be a little better, but still searching for that blueberry taste. Not the best blueberry I've had. Should of only grabbed one and let it chill properly."
"I have had this beer a couple of times to make sure that I am rating it accurately. The smell, head and body all appear to be something that you will love, however, the finish, mouth and taste lack in what we typically would like in an outmeal stout. I have found that drinking it at a higher temperature yields a much better result - albeit, that is only after two trials. My recommendation - serve at around 60 degrees... The best comes out in it at that range."

"I Purchased this in a Mix Six pack . I Picked 2 bottles of this beer, regretting that now.Fair amount of white looking sediment in the bottom of the bottle. Poured a white/cocoa 2 finger head which had a rich oatmeal bluberryish smell . A ton of bubbles and fizz , poured into the Fat Tire Tulip glass. The beer was very dark in color .When it took the swisharoo test not much lacing. The beer tasted Like nothing it smelled like. Stout yes, but a very thin style stout. For me the carbonation was out of freaking control.Berry Flavor was way in the back of the taste for me and the front was a faint oatmeal almost ale type flavor?Overall I did not enjoy this myself, but maybe someone who is just getting into fruit style stouts might enjoy this . Happy Hump Day!"

"Pours a rich dark chocolate hue with smells of blueberry pie filling complete with a doughy crust. Taste is flat, burnt and unappealing. Blueberry is hardly noticeable and the rich roastiness I enjoy in a stout is virtually none existent. Mouthfeel is is stinging. The enjoy by 2/15/13 and today being 3/3 may be a clue. Drain pour."

"I didn't know Mr. Cody was a brewer... Anyway, this stuff pours a midnight garnet topped by a finger of relatively short-lived khaki foam. The nose comprises blueberry syrup, blackened pretzel, and, oddly enough, pancake batter. The taste is a harsh double penetration, with artificial blueberry on one side and a starkly bitter helping of burnt malts on the other. You have to be into this sort of thing, and I guess you can count me out of that particular fetish group. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a fluid feel, and a dry finish. Overall, this stuff just didn't do it for me. Though things were placid enough in the smell, the flavors clash painfully, and it's unsure whether or not they would have tasted better apart from each other anyway. Add to that an oatmeal stout base that's just way too thin and not very creamy, and you have a rather subpar beer on your hands, son."
"The aroma consisted of fresh blueberries and roasted malt. Medium in body, ultra smooth and creamy. Foundation of roasted malt, blueberry, and chocolate. Overall, nice session beer, first fruit Stout that I have sampled, it was well balanced."
"O- If you drink this too cold it has very little flavor. Also even though it is listed as 7.5% ABV it feels stronger than that"
""

"Usually I'm not a fan of most fruits beers that aren't wilds/lambics, but this one was at least drinkable and decent. Not something I'd try to revisit though."
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: This tastes very dreadful. Everything else is ok though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My take: A very good blueberry beer. Similar in quality to Sea Dog's, but less refreshing, longer lasting, and more satisfying. Pretty good for a fruit beer, though the blueberry flavor itself leaves something to be desired."
""
""
"O- Smells good, but the rest is forgettable or just bad."
""
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
"Overall - A bit too much blueberry, not enough stout flavor for my liking. It's drinkable, but can get a bit too sweet with so much blueberry flavor dominating the profile."
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, alcohol, and an artificial blueberry aroma. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick and a fake blueberry flavor that is slightly medicinal. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that is drinkable but the blueberry presence is not very well done."

"NOTE: Live review."
""
""
"Overall, this beer is just too weird. 7.5% ABV? I beg to differ. The alc is undetectable. But it's just too sour and tastes like dandelion milk. Oatmeal stout? i think not."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm surprised the reviews are relatively low for this beer. I feel that it was very well put together - good balance of flavor without being too heavy in any single department. My only complaint is the somewhat syrupy nature of the beer, which may lead to premature palate fatigue. Not something I'd stock up on, but not nearly as bad as others made it sound."
"O - The taste was terrible. It tasted like blueberry, alcohol, and plastic. I would not drink this crap again."
"Well, this one certainly has a blueberry aroma...it's notable immediately upon the pour. It has a grain and mild oat scent as well. I imagined something like oatmeal for breakfast with some bitter chocolate and blueberries mixed in....that's not quit what you get with this beer, but the scents are present...they just don't come together perfectly. The liquid itself is a deep, black-ish brown color with a lasting light-tan head. Ever present carbonation keeps the head replenished and adds some distracting bite to the mouthfeel. Drier than expected, and there's also a solid hop bitterness. This is a better than average stout, and the blueberry isn't as overpowering as the smell forecasted, but its not exceptional by any means."

"Strong, smoky aroma has an overtone of blueberry - no surprise there! It pours a deep sable with a light tan head that leaves about average lacing. Flavor has firm notes of molasses, coffee, blueberry, semi-sweet chocolate and roast malt. Firm-bodied texture has a decent amount of fizz. If you like fruit beers and stouts, keep your eyes peeled for this one."
""
""
""
"O - The first blueberry beer I have ever had that I enjoyed. It's an interesting stout, and far from the norm of blueberry beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This oatmeal stout has some great and unique flavors, however the overcarbonation made me not enjoy this beer as much as I should have."
"O - I'm not a huge fan of fruit beers, but the blueberries in this one blend well with the grain for a very balanced flavor."
"Overall - To be honest.. I can't stand this beer lol. Maybe it's just because I don't like stouts, but I thought this one would be different. I didn't really taste any oatmeal either."
"O-good beer but not a favorite by any means. Give credit to a small brewer though."
""
""
"It is an ok beer. It is different from the Seadog Blueberry because this is a stout. It is a very good attempt and is well worth a try."
""
"overall i am not happy with this beer. luckily it has a high abv so it wasn't a total waste of money, but i do feel like i've been screwed with a little. i really hope the orange cream ale is a bit better than this one. the aftertaste is almost straight up wooden - which could be a good thing if it were a different wood than cedar which leaves its presence strongly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I enjoyed this offering overall and would try this again if I had the chance. As I've said I would classify this a bit of a dessert beer and that is not meant to be a derogatory observation."
""
"This beer poured a very dark brown with a two-finger tan head that lingered for a while. Good on them for the smell, it actually smells like blueberries. Not the canned oversweetened pie filler kind, but the real fruit. The taste starts off with some sweet chocolately malt that is cut pretty quickly by a some blueberries and finishing off with a bit of coffee bitterness. The mouthfeel is thicker than average with some light carbonation. Overall an interesting beer and the only one I've seen in the style."
""
""
"O: Definitely not as bad as their pumpkin beer, and definitely not a drain pour, but this was just too chemically synthetic and sweet for me to really love it. Thanks for sharing though, Bryin, I have been meaning to try this."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Pours a dark brown and puts up a 1"" tan head. Smells of blueberries (surprise, surprise) and mild chocolate, with the oats giving it a bready aroma. Taste is not that great. If I put a bunch of blueberries in my armpits and ran 10 miles and put the into a beer. This is what I think it would taste like. Somewhat bitter on the palate. Good carbonation. Not the stout I reach for if I got a hankerin' for one."
""
""
"D: Flavorful, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, not the best representation of style, this one is certainly more fruit-beer-like than stout-like, overall it’s just a mediocre beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: This was not a terrible beer but it is certainly not something that I will be purchasing again."
"O - I had high hopes for this combination based on how well I thought they did with their pumpkin ale. It never really was as distinctive as it should have been."
"Blueberry for sure. The appearance is very nice, dark and rich looking, after that... just goes down hill. The aroma is nice, smells like... blueberry. The taste like an unsweetened blueberry with a hit of what seems to be molasses. But goes down with a syrupy bitter stickiness. Not horrible but I think this is a one hit wonder in my book."
""
""
"Moderate carbonation with biting but long finish. Overall I'm pretty thrown off by the harsh aspirin-like bitterness in this beer. Don't know if it's old, a bad batch, or I'm just very sensitive to whatever flavor combinations exist in the beer. Won't seek out."
""
""
"D: i couldnt imagine drinking more than one of these. one sip is moderately pleasant, the next makes me cringe. i boo this offering. too much of a gimick then a beer."
""
""
"Overall: Interesting combination. I love the blueberries as they do not seem artificial as some blueberry taste can. Wish this was a bit less bitter, but I would still get it again. I prefer Dark Horse Tres as a similar beer though."
""
"Pours a brown beer with a fleeing underfinger of light latte foam. The beer smells of - blueberry and oatmeal. Huh, spot on for the name. Tastes of - oats and peppercorns and some sweet cardboard. Once I've tasted it, when I smell it again, it's got a bit of a musty smell to it. Medium bodied with some lighter moderate carb. Meh."
""
""
""
""
"DOA"
""
""
"O-I can't get by the metallic aftertaste in this one"
"Overall – not a bad concept, but it seems a little half-hearted. I only say that due to the blueberry’s lack of presence. Had it been a little more prominent, this brew might gained a little more noteworthiness. Not at all bad tasting though."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This pours a dark brown with a tan head. The smell is mostly of artificial blueberries. The feel is medium to light, lighter than most stout. The taste is okay, blueberries and bitter stout, but not something I'd get again."
""
"It's a nice and cloudy dark red with a copious amount of foam. The aroma has a decent amount of blueberry and a bit of wheat. The taste is more wheat with the blueberry component more noticeable at the end but seeming kind of artificial. It's quite smooth and the 7.5% doesn't come on fast. It's decent."
"O - I am a huge fan of oatmeal stouts and I am usually accepting of fruity experiment beers but this lacked many qualities of a good oatmeal stout. The blueberry was pleasant but on the side of overwhelming."
"Overall. Too bad this has the bitterness. The blueberry tastes okay but there seems to be some perfumy floral taste going on. Not really my thing."
"O- A very enjoyable brew in all aspects. I'm beginning to think there may be something to this Buffalo Bill's."
""
""
""
"O: My first Buffalo Bill's beer and disappointed. I think I've heard good things about their pumpkin ale. This was pretty bad. Not much works with this beer at all. Not a drain pour, but damn close. Definitely stay away, unless you need the tic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. Not an award winner, but certainly a good all around beer. (Also, the first blueberry beer I've had that's any good)."
"Two things on the palate, it's got a lot of tartness and the alcohol is out of whack. I was a bit nervous when I saw the 7.2% on the label and it is hot."
""
""
"O- With the exception of the look and smell, this beer redeemed itself to become quite a nice beverage. Well balanced flavors, not being overly sweet, and a nicely textured mouthfeel, I feel that this is a well done take on a fruity style of stout. One knock I'd give it though is that, especially as it starts to warm, the booze becomes increasingly noticeable in both aroma and taste. Otherwise, a decent brew!"
"O- My first impression was ""Oh boy this is going to be awful", but in the end it wasn't awful, just not very good. A blueberry stout or porter, or even brown ale could be a delicious combination, but this one falls short by quite a bit."
"Fuck me, I haven't had reaction like this to a beer outside of a crappy malt liquor/Euro-fuel lager, in well, ever. This one hurts, on a physical and psychological plane. Subtle malt, fruit from hell. 'Nuff said."
"Had on tap at the Sunset Grille in Allston MA. Pours a purple/black with a very thin head. Smells of roasted malts and plums/blueberry like it's namesake. Taste is alright, the blueberry is there but is pretty faint behind the general stout taste. Overall not bad but nothing to write home about."
"O-Ill buy this one again"
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a white head. The aroma is full of roasted malt with a strong, syrupy blueberry component. The beer is artificial smelling. The flavor is full of blueberry and chocolate with a little bit of roasted malt mixed in. Once again, the fruit in the beer seems artificial and fake. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"O: I picked this up for my wife, but then read some good reviews and figured I'd try it myself. This was not good and quickly became a drain pour for me. This makes e thik something like blueberry koolaid added to Guinness."
"This beer was something I picked up just by chance. The pour was very nice, solid black and a large brown head. Really nice lacing. The smell of the beer has a great aroma of blueberry and roasted malts. The taste of the beer is also rather impressive too, it takes like a toasted blueberry muffin. It's sweet but bitter too. The mouthfeel was pretty thick feeling. Overall I really like this brew a lot. I look forward to trying it again one day."
"Sweet and sour, but not bitter from black patent malt. The blueberry is obvious but the Stout is not. I find this beer to be more tart than bitter. I'd almost make a new beer category for this one--there are darker, but sweet, malts present. The flavor is complex with just a touch of hop bitterness. The body is disappointingly thin, especially for an Oatmeal version of stout."
"*The appearance of this beer is the best thing I have to say about it. It smells too sweet, and it is too sweet. In my opinion, just the wrong combo/amounts of ingredients in this beer. Won't buy again."
"Overall meh, not very good, lots of contrasting flavors, malts are there but waaay overpowered by the blueberries and some weird stem flavors and earthy hops that none of the above blend well."
"I really don't prefer fruit beers, but I thought this was original so I gave it a whirl. The aroma is pretty terrible, but the flavor is good. The oatmeal adds a good heartiness to the beer. It would probably be better with a little less booze and a little less blueberry to mask it. A unique beer that should be tried at least once."
"D: Overall, I wasn't too fond of this beer. I appreciated trying a new style however. For me, it was two completely different flavors (roasted malts and sweet fruit) that did not mesh well. Will not purchase again."
"What a let down. I thought the taste was going to be great since I liked the aroma. It really tastes weird, almost medicinal with the added blueberries."
"This is honestly the worst beer I've ever had. I'm pissed I even gave it a chance, I only picked up a single so it's all good. AVOID!"
"A yummy Black-and-Blue for home consumption. Highly rated, yes, but with virtually no deduction for over the top head, or for departure from traditional oatmeal stout characteristics."
"Dr: At this price, it's an interesting buy for a stout lover like me. I'd like to try more fruit stouts. It does hide its abv quite well. Beeradvocate's categorization handles beers like this especially wrong."
"D- not as tiring as you would think , and abv is very well hidden."
"D - an oddity; for a single pint it is quite enjoyable - but would I have another???"
"This dose not scream out stout too me except for the color. I appreciate the creativity but I dont think the blueberry works that well."
"I truly enjoy the taste of this beer and for the price, its worth getting again."
"Drinkability: I hate blueberries, and was very pesimistic about trying this beer because I'm not a big fan of blueberry flavor. What sold me is this is a oatmeal stout, and I love oatmeal stouts. I think the flavors tie in nicely. Good balance between the roasted stout elements and the sweetness of the blueberry. Not something I can drink a whole six pack of in a sitting as the flavor profile gets a bit over the top but a decent offering nonetheless. I would have this again."
"This is a 360 degree difference from Dark Horse Tres that utilizes blueberry within a stout. Just from the first whiff after pouring, I'm getting artificial Fruity Pebbles like nots that are found in Sunset Wheat from Leinenkugel's. This one looks alot better, pitch black with no ruby highlights forms a tan thick head forming fine layers of lacing. Aroma like I said un-natural as it gets what is going on here sharp candy blueberry pie notes not earthy blueberry skin. Flavor is horrible big layer of roasty alcoholic notes from the minimal 7.5% with off flavors hailing from the artificial blueberry flavoring to the actual hop additions that are just clashing with the dark roasts. Mouthfeel is fizzy carbonation, meaning too much. Body is medium bodied though it work work better if it had more balls. Drinkability overall is shite, this is a one and done beer, I will never drink this again as long as Dark Horse is alive and well producing Blueberry Stouts."
"Picked up a six pack for the wife and grabbed a bottle for myself.Poured into a standard pint glass a a near opaque black except for a few ruby highlights,a thinner quick to fade toasted almond colored head atop,it was gone in a blink.All blueberry in the nose wich wasnt to bad,but honestly thats all I picked up.Sweet cereal-like blueberry flavors really stand out with very little other impy stout-like components,light chocolate comes in as I drink more but its all artificial fruit here.It could be good but its heavy handed on the sweet blueberry artificial flavor and not overly drinkable."
"The beer pours a dark brown/black color with a 1/4"" tan head that quickly fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is average. It has a dry, roasted and chocolate malt scent along with a weak blueberry aroma. It's not very impressive. The taste is average as well. It has a muddled array of flavors ranging from chocolate and roasted malts to a sweet blueberry fruit taste. The mouthfeel is average as well. It is a full bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation. This is a disappointing beer. It's sounds delicious, but it falls flat."
"D: Pretty drinkable, this was a nice take on the style. Mixed the flavors very well together and a great feel to it."
"- Overall an interesting, and quite a good beer if you are into blueberries.. which I happen to be. A well made and balanced brew.. a great buy/."
"Good stuff here. I dig this, but being an imperial - I must admit that initially, I was mildly disappointed that it was not a bit bigger, but tere is plenty to enjoy here."
"d: I won't be going back with out all my gaurds up."
"I poured this beer into a perfect pint glass, it had a dark almost black color body with a 2 inch cream colored head to it. The smell is of malts and artificial blueberries. It taste like oatmeal with fresh blueberries, and to me a little disappointing, was hoping for a more fruity taste. The mouth feel is nice and leaves a chalky taste on the tongue. The drink ability is ok."
"I think I'll go forget I ever had this."
"Buffalo Bill's Blueberry Oatmeal Stout is a solid black beer with a foamy, light brown head that has decent retention and lacing. It took a heavy pour. It has a big, sweet blueberry aroma with a touch of roast. It smells pretty artificial, but pleasant. It's pretty full bodied and pretty smooth with a chewy finish that leaves the tongue a little chalky. The flavor is a little disjointed. It starts with a dark, roasted flavor that's bound to a faceless (but well present) bitterness. That's followed by a sweet artificial blueberry flavor that reminds me of the Dum-Dum that I swiped off someone's desk in the office last week. There's a little touch of something poison in there. I do appreciate that it's a stout and that it tastes like ""blueberry", but the excitement fades after about eight ounces."
"D - Overall whats to expect? You get blueberry full of flavor and smell on top of slight chocolate and bitter tones of a stout. Simple but perfect. If this sticks around I may pick up a whole sixer on the cheap. Good brew!"
"Overall, I like this. I'm all for people trying stouts with dark red or berry fruits. If you like blueberries and fruit beers, you will like this"
"Another intriguing winter seasonal. A nice medium bodied stout with an authentic blueberry undertone. Pours a mahogony brown with light edges, some light shows through. Aromas are enticing with loads of blueberry and chocolate malt. Flavor is mellow, medium bodied, easy to drink. Finish reveals all of the blueberry with a berry skin aftertaste that makes it seem like you ate a fresh one. Well balanced, oddly bitter finish that seems almost like a berry tannin. Pair with chocolate and we're in business."
"D-The weird bitterness along with the the rubbing alcohol and the complete lack of any malt notes render this one almost totally undrinkable. Had to drain-pour this one."
"D - Alcoholic tasting as well as fruity. I might have one in a night..."
"Dark pour with no head to speak of, like blueberry juice and dark rootbeer. Smells sweet, not much else. A piney and woody taste up front with a sweet noticeable blue berry back, actually more complex than I thought it would be. Complex but not entirely pleasant. Good mouthfeel, medium bodied and plenty of small medio carbonation. Not too drinkable. Maybe one was enough."
"Do not recommend."
"I've found Buffalo Bill's to be a quirky brewery, but one which makes interesting beers (or, at least, they were interesting in the 90s when everyone else was just doing pale/amber/stout combinations). This one is, frankly, just not very good."
"Pours into a black body with a large tan head that has decent retention, good carbonation and reallly good lacing. The smell is some chocolate, hints of malts and hops, but mostly all blueberry. The taste is strong with blueberries and chocolate with hints of malts, hops, oats and a pine taste to it. It has a dry finish to the taste with some bitter chocolate in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, but yet rather dry. The sweetness of the blueberries and the bitterness of the chocolate is very well balanced, and with the smoothness the oats provide make this a nice drinkable beer. Very good beer and for just $1.59 not a bad price either."
"Drinkability is good. This stout is definitely different. Not a beer I would go out of my way to have, but not a beer that I regret having either. Worth a try."
"good drinkability, although I'm not sure if I could handle more than one or two at a time."
"Drinkability-Very drinkable. Somewhat nice. I'd recommend this to a bridge the gap for someone new to stout. For me i wish it had more body and a bit more malt complexity."
"Hopes were high since I love blueberries as well as stouts but this I will not be drinking again."
"Pours an opaque purplish black, with a soft, cream-colored head that fell fast. Sort of a ""wet"" viscosity, and only minor lacing. The blueberry dominates the scent, and combines with bready, malty sweetness to create a very blueberry-muffin-like aroma. Mouthfeel is very silky and smooth; drinks nice and easy (particularly for a 7.5% ABV) with less blueberry in the flavor than I'd have anticipated based on the smell. Taste in general is malty and pleasant, a little grainy/bready; there is some mild carbonation spikiness and a wet, creamy mouthfeel on the front end, which overlaps into a contrastingly clean, smooth, almost dry middle; then, the subtle tart blueberry notes become a little more noticeable, along with some mellow but distinct herbal hop bite in the finish. Slight blueberry notes hang nicely in the aftertaste. While doing nothing really wrong, it's somehow not quite mind-blowing; but this is certainly a neatly balanced, very drinkable stout, that doesn't let the sweetness of its theme overpower. In fact, it is much better than I expected it to be, and a stout I would happily drink again. Give it a shot if you see it."
"Dryish mouthfeel, very full but not chewy. It's drinkable and interesting but it's such an odd combination I can't decide whether it's just interesting or if it's more than that. If only it turned your tongue blue."
"6 pack ,12 oz bottles from Fred Meyer, N.Salem. $6.99 dark mahogany brown in colour with a small tan head . looks like a porter. Strong blueberry aromas but also almost naked alcohol aromas at afirst though after a few more sniffs a more typical tasty maltiness shows and the alcohol goes down. Taste is really more toasty,toffee malts with blueberry basking in the back,a slight alcohol tinge in the back of the throat. Not bad really. Ok on the palate long lasting semi-bitterness fro the mats i presume, which i enjoyed. Overall i kind of enjoyed this though i would say this is a porter rather than a classic stout."
"I had held out on this prior due to bo wanting a fruity beer. it is not fruity."
"Yup, this one works and conjures up the thought of being a breakfast beer. The blueberry and roasted malt play well together. Balance is key and this beer is right on track."
"Drinkability: A good sipper, and surprisingly moreish. Just expect something unusual and you'll be satisfied."
"Even with the high alcohol, I never got that burning feeling in the back of my throat. It's a good tasting, creamy beer than goes down easy and leaves you wanting more."
"Poured into a snifter. The first thing you notice is the blueberry aroma. The blueberry doesn't totally overshadow everything else, it works well with the rest of the beer. You get a nice roasty note up front, then the finish is all blueberry. The mouthfeel is relatively smooth for the style. This was very drinkable, I could easily drink a few of these in one sitting."
"D - The idea for this one was okay but it didn't work out too well...the blueberry flavor was nice but the stout part came up a little short"
"Chocolate blueberry pie? The alcohol is not hidden well enough and the body lacks the creaminess of a good oaty stout. This should most definitely be classified as a fruit beer as the blueberry is quite prominent, calling it an imperial stout is not cool. The blueberry tartness clashes with the chocolaty and roasty malt, which I am glad it has in the fist place. I can actually finish this, not sure I would make it going into this beast. Most definitely not worthy of a six-pack purchase, but makes for a decent little novelty brew."
"The beer poured a nice dark rich color with specks of oatmeal dancing around in the glass. A nice hint of blueberry aroma, which was not in any way overpowering. The beer was smooth going down with more hints of blueberries and malts. A very enjoyable beer."
"Black colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is blueberry pie with fudge sauce.Taste also is blueberries and cocoa powder.Very smooth and goes down like silk.I thought this was a pretty damn good beer and would highly recommend.I'm pretty sure I will be buying this again shortly."
"Overall, a decent beer that's worth a shot if you see it."
"D- Yeah you can drink this, but I wouldn't advise in buying it."
"Drinks okay, but, too much blueberry & not enough stout going on for me right here. One & done for me. If I'd read the label closer I would've ditched this, for some reason I thought Pyramid did this. Time to start carrying some reading glasses on my beer safaris..."
"Pours a light and clear brown color with no head, just a few white bubbles here and there. The aroma is very sweet and very blueberry with a subtle malty aroma to balance it. This is echoed in the flavor which is also sweet and the blend of strong blueberry flavor and the supporting maltiness creates the illusion of a blueberry pancakes in liquid form. The body, however, is very light and slightly flat which brings out a little tartness and makes the drink and finish very quick. More body and perhaps a more grain flavored malt and this is a beer you can drink at breakfast with some eggs and bacon."
"does not match up like it should."
"First thing is, this is from a bottle that's over a year old. Interesting. Poured aggresively and got a small to medium fine tan head and some lace. Head quickly settled to a thin cover. Color is an opaque brownish black. Aroma is blueberry traditional stout. Flavor's about the same. Nice thing is, the blueberry doesn't hit you over the head. Actually not too bad, although it wouldn't be one of my favs. Little bit of a weird finish. Don't pick up much of the alcohol."
"D- Easy to drink despite being overly carbonated. I could drink it all night, however, I don't think I would want to. I'd drink it again, but there are def better options out there. This was a different stout for sure. I'm just not sure if it's a good different."
"It's a bit more carbonated than most stouts and pretty thin in feel. I'm glad I tried it but would probably not purchase it again."
"D- Overall, not outstanding but I would recommend trying this beer solely for its uniqueness. Worth a shot."
"That's all I got on this one. Give it a try if you enjoy fruit beers, you won't be disappointed."
"D - Definitely different. Not awful at all but not that good. Just different. It's an ok drinking beer I don't think I'll ever have again. One of Buffalo Bill's gimmicky beers I guess."
"I liked this beer a lot. If this were a normal American Stout and not an Imperial, my ratings would be even higher."
"Overall not awful, but nothing to write home about. It wasn't what I expected from an oatmeal stout, it reminded me more of a not very good Americal Pale Ale infused with blueberries. I don't plan on getting this again and its not something I would recommend."
"Pours a very dark brown color body, with a huge tan head, average sized bubbles, somewhat diminishing. Very hoppy aroma. Some acidic fruit too. Light fruit taste, berries. Some roasted notes too. Inhaling deep, blueberry, fruit. Almost a fake taste, plasticy. Blueberry aftertaste. Some graininess, but not very good. Sour. More roasted as it warms, but still that fake fruit taste or something. Somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Not offensive, but not very good either. A bit bitter."
"(Bottle into English pint) Poured a creamy dark brown almost black with little to no head to speak of. Aroma at first smacks of the blueberry smell, but over time a nice toasted malt flavor comes forward. The most surprising, however, was the subtlety of the blueberry in the mouth. A lively carbonation helps to pull the malts forward, with the blueberry actually as a nice undertone enhancing the roasted flavors. There is a nice smooth finish as both flavors linger just long enough to entice the next sip."
"D – This beer is palatable and just overall good; it is one of the best applications of blueberry that I can recall. Probably not the choice for RIS drinkers, though."
"overall better than most beers with fruit."
"Very drinkable beer, interesting."
"New to BC this is a better beer than the bottle and the concept appears. Pours like a standard stout but the blueberry notes pick up in the nose and the finish. The beer has a nice fruit note with the blueberry but not overbearing. Not the biggest stout but still reasonably full bodied for the style. Worth trying"
"One to two. A novelty that turns out to be good."
"Flavor is similarly mild, some lightly tart fruit and vague toast flavor. It disappears fast on the palate. Sort of sweet at first, becoming dry in the finish. Average body, it's not something i'd reach for again, but a decent transition beer for the non-craft drinker. 12oz. was from a gift pack sampler."
"Poured a black color with good carbonatio and a tannish head. Nose is whhhholly BLUEBERRY. To much berry, no enough oats. Taste is pretty thin, blueberry heavy, not much oats but a roastiness going on. Mouthfeel is pretty much dominated by roasted malt, hints of oats being smothered by bllueberry. No way will I try this again but someone else might dig it."
"Drinkability: while a moderately heavy beer (just by nature, it is a stout), the blueberry provides the cleaner finish than you would expect with an oatmeal stout. Fans of oatmeal stouts will appreciate the different take without an overpowering variation."
"drinkability: a solid stout but I would pass on it in a heartbeat. Very low compelxity for an Imperial Stout. If that's what they were trying to accomplish, then A plus.... Also, it's gettign worse as it gets warmer...."
"D- I liked drinking this beer, but one at a time was enough. It was just too sweet. The three major flavors (roasted malt, hops, and blueberry) were all good, but all very individual. They didn't really balance or work together."
"This is a very odd combo of flavors...didn't really work for me...will not be getting again."
"The beer is complex and doesn't overcommit in any given direction, but it's weight and the blueberry character certainly limit it to no more than a couple of pints. Still, it's a great beer for the cooler months and I'm glad to have picked it up. There won't be any trouble finishing these off."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip. Light beige, one finger head lingers above a black body. Aroma is of blueberry, and maybe some toasted malts. I suppose it smells about what I expected after having Buffalo Bill's Pumpkin. Smells refreshing actually. Taste is less sweet than expected after considering the aroma. No alcohol heat noted. Taste is malty with notes of blueberry of course. Pretty smooth. Overall, not very complex, but a very tasty treat...and interesting and pleasing."
"Fairly drinkable but don't buy this expecting a stout. Buy this if you are seeking a blueberry beer."
"Overall a fun stout to try in a smaller serving. Good capturing of the wild blueberries. Complex and challenging but not overly heavy."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Good heavy beer that still retains some good sweetness. Lightly carbonated but overall an interesting choice of style."
"Not what i was expecting at all. An interesting Bluberry beer that pours far darker and heavier than most fruit beers. The Stout gives ita good, full body and the blueberry aroma is definitely there but not overwhelming. Tastes very smooth on the mouth and was very easily drinkable. An excellent winter beer, with a summer taste."
"Pours dark brown to nearly black with off-white head. Nose has a true blueberry aroma (not artificial, contrary to what others have said). Some roasty notes are in the nose as well. This comes through on the palate as well, with some dusty cocoa, and of course blueberry sweetness. Hop bite at the end. Rather easy drinking, even with the fruit component."
"D: Not really my cup of tea. I see some others like it. Seems to be hit or miss really."
"Summary: If you are in the mood for a fruit beer or just something different, give this one a try"
"I dunno why the reviews are so ""meh"" about this beer, maybe its from people who don't like stouts, or only like conventional stouts, or are turned off by the fact that it is contract brewed, corporate hands (the people who hate ""corporations"" sure seem to be judgmental and close minded, but that's another topic) on it or who knows, maybe they just don't like this stout. I happen to like it very much."
"Overall- i'm not a stout fan but i thought i'd give this one a try considering my favorite stout is dark horse's tres. to me when i think of stout i think of malts and theres no malt taste to this beer. i say buy a single first or don't even waste your money."
"D- This bottle is enough for me. I didn't feel like I was choking it down, but I definitely won't care for another. The blueberry flavor that I perceived as synthesized was disappointing. The mouthfeel was a little disappointing..."
"Drinkability: Is this ever disappointing but, then again, I wasn't expecting much given my past experiences with this brewery"
"Drinkability is low. I finished this out of respect for beer in general but I'll never drink this again. Not a hint of blueberry anywhere.."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my nonic pint glass. The stout appears a dark brown color with about two fingers of dense ecru foam. Smell and taste is dominated by blueberries followed by notes of dark roasted grains, cocoa dusted dried blueberries, and milk chocolate. Roasty, bitter and sweet. A notch better than medium in body with ample carbonation for the style. One of the better blueberry flavored beers on the market. Worth a try if you dig blueberries."
"This beer is pretty decent. I don't mind Buffalo Bill's brews. Their Orange Blossom is pretty good and their Pumpkin Ale is okay. This is a winter seasonal (I believe), so it might be kind of hard to find in the summer. But, if you can find it, check it out. The six-pack won't last long as this beer is very easy to drink."
"Very nice blueberry auroma but slightly lacking in berry flavor. Definitely interesting and worth trying one if you get the chance."
"Drinkability: No, thank you. If you're in desperate need for a blueberry-based stout, please turn your attention rightfully to Dark Horse's Tres Blueberry Stout. The unrewarding blueberry flavoring couldn't (and could never) make up for a deficient stout."
"Stout and blueberries sounds like a nice combo, but not quite so in this beer. Not offensive, just disappointing."
"Another BA described the taste as liquid blueberry oatmeal, and that pretty much nails this beer on the head.  Surprisingly pleasant.  I think this stout does a servicable job, striking a balance between fruity sweetness and the oats and malts. An easy drinking stout and while it may seem gimmicky and I did pick it up on a whim, it was a nice change of pace."
"Huh? BA says this is 7.5% - no freakin way."
"D - The blueberry flavor is a nice change, but it's not something I could have to many of."
"D - Fun, but could get tiring."
"Overall -- Get it on draft if you can -- the beer moves up one whole range in my opinion. The bottles are OK if you can get them for cheap (I know that Grocery Depot in California tends to carry Buffalo Bills 6-packs for 4-5 bucks)."
"Pours a dark brown with a lighter amber along the edges. 5/4 inch head of a tan color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells strongly of blueberries, slight hops, and hints of roasted malt. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Not thick like many other double stouts, but not a watery feel. Tastes of blueberries upfront, very slight hop background, and finish is roasted malts. There's a dryness associated with this brew. I'm not getting a lot out of this besides the blueberries (as far as malt and hops). A new type of beer that I'm glad I tried, but not really my forte."
"Edit: I just bought another 6-pack of this and it lacks a bit from the other one's I've had. I think this is the kind of beer that has much variation from each brew they make. If you didn't like it the first time, give it a try again- maybe it'll be from one of the better brews they did."
"The beer poured a very thin head which dissipated quickly. It had a dark coloration like typical Oatmeal Stouts and had the texture of a typical one. The smell wasn't bad, however I found both the smell and taste (referring to the blueberries) more absent of the blueberry I would have preferred. Subtle is good, absent is less so. Overall it wasn't a bad brew, but just a very average one. Certainly I've had worse blueberry beers, and its worth trying. The texture of the stout was typical, and I was glad that it didn't have a syrupy flavor to it."
"We split the single 12oz between us, so I didn't get as many sips as I'd usually have to work out the flavor profile. By taste alone, I'm not sure I could have identified this as ""blueberry."" Something-berry, yes, but if you told me it was blackberry or raspberry, I might have believed you. But the nose definitely gives it away -- it's unmistakable."
"Dark ebony with a thick finger of sand colored foam that leaves some fine lace behind. Smells pretty blueberry heavy with roasted malt. Tastes more blueberry than anything else, otherwise a fairly dry, lighter than most stout with mild hop bitterness in the finish. Alcohol is very well hidden. The oatmeal comes through in the creamy, chalky mouthfeel. A decent brew thats a little too light for an imperial stout but better than other BB's beer that I've had in the past."
"The aroma had a faint blueberry smell to it and not much more. It was pretty bitter and a little sour. In the mouth it left a bittering note on the top of the mouth. Overall it seem very thin, lacked smoothness I am used to with an oatmeal stout. The label was more appealing than the beer itself. The 7.5 percent abv is pretty well hidden. It is worth a try but I won't be buying this one again."
"My dad bought a six pack of this stuff from the store, after recently visiting their brewery and tasting most of what they had to offer, I was not exactly jumping for joy to try a bottle but I got around to it and today, poured into a Stone pint glass, color is dark brown color with purple highlights, thin vanilla colored head that lasted about five minutes, not much lacing, read that there was thirty pounds of blueberries in each batch and I believe it after sticking my nose in my glass, pretty much dominates except for a little bit of roasted malt and artificial sweetness, taste was straight fruit at first, then faded into some dark malts but not many, it is a bit tart and it does not work at all with the other flavors, just too sweet, mouthfeel is mostly cloyingly sweet with some roastiness, medium bodied, pretty flat as far as carbonation goes, could not drink more than six ounces of it, just finished pouring the rest down the drain, another beer I would never drink again from these guys, probably will steer clear of this brewery period in the future, not recommended"
"Got all excited over this one in the grocery store. I love stouts and blueberries. Looks like a stout but the head is there and gone in a second. Initial aroma is medicinal with a hint of fruit. The mouth feel is thin and lacks that stout body, this is lighter than a porter too. Taste is begging for more stout and less fruit. The bitterness is pronounced as well as some blueberry sweetness with a tart finish. Tastes better as it warms up. But near the end, a flat beer. Disappointed."
"This soft fruity beer met my expectations."
"This was just OK. Enough blueberry was present but it overall didn't seem to meld well with the Stout qualities. I was one and done with this."
"I had high hopes for this one. but they were quickly quashed. If there was more of a stout to stand up to the blueberry, this could actually be great. But the stout wasn't there... and the blueberry definitely was. Not awful, but not really enjoyable. a novel idea that is fun for a sip or two but not quite solid enough to enjoy the whole bottle."
"Future outlook: Not a terrible beer, and was fine for a novel experience, but not something worth revisiting. I'd be interested in trying a full bodied, creamy blueberry-oatmeal stout if one exists (?), but this one doesn't fill that bill."
"Taste is pretty mellow for a stout. The blueberries come through well but not too strong. Very mellow in the stout department. A bit fizzy as well. Thin mouthfeel and a bit weak overall."
"EDIT: Future tastings of this are actually making me think it's even worse. The hops in the finish combined with that ""off"" (burnt plastic?) flavor really make this a complete dud. I normally don't change reviews, but every subsequent bottle has made me think this was even worse than the last. Worst beer I've had in years."
"Pours a nice dark black, although with only a bit of initial head and no lacing to speak of. Good scent, a huge whiff of blueberry along with a nice bit of burnt grain and smidge of coffee. Nice taste, decent stout characteristics on the way in, notably a bit of coffee and some nice dark grains; a huge mouth of blueberry at the end of the drink; mixes nicely after swallowing (Booberry cereal and coffee for breakfast); no one taste is completely dominant, which helped, too much blueberry would've been bad. Goes down quite well for a higher ABV stout."
"This is a good beer, but I feel that the blueberry in the aroma and flavor clashes too much with the roasted malts."
"Pours a deep amber to black in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, a faint, sugary blueberry is all I get. In the taste, sweet oatmeal, light roastiness, and a hint of blueberry. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry roasty malt and small small blueberry aftertaste. Interesting blueberry, a bit light overall, but OK."
"Poured a nice dark color, like it should, and left the perfect head...because of my pouring expertise. I love oatmeal stout's so I was excited to see it added with blueberries, and Buffalo Bill's did not let me down. Oh good Lord, it smelled like those blueberry pancakes mama used to make, but not too strong, just enough to taste the berries. The taste was great too..a great balanced stout with just the right flavor of the berry. Went down nice and smooth...all 6 of them"
"This oatmeal stout reminds me of my childhood. I spent many a summers eating oatmeal with blueberries. It had a very pleasing aroma of blueberries. The taste was very appealing with hints of blueberries and hops. I enjoyed this beer to the fullest potential."
"Drinkability is very solid given the style of fruit stout and its strength. I would say this would make a good dessert beer, but its also fine to drink on whenever its around."
"Ohh.. a blueberry belch!"
"Poured a leather couch brown with some seethruness and a thin head that died quickly and didn't leave lace. Blueberry notes abound but that's all I'm smelling - like I am smelling blueberry syrup. A little too sharp blueberry taste and a rather thin body give this beer, which is smooth and contains a good malt base, somewhat of a fruit soda overcarbonation feel. Not a bad beer and the ABV is hidden but this reminded me a little of cherry soda with the crispness a little too much. If they tweak the blueberry tartness they could have a great beer here."
"Drinkability: Fruity beer so that usually gives this category some points for me..higher ABV though. Also, not very much sticking to the style; I don't mind deviation, but this just seems a big jump. Too much blueberry sweetness, which tastes fine..but could use more. Worth trying, however."
"Notes from: 3/6/08"
"Drinkability- Not the greatest.. I'll be finishing this pint, but I'm fairly sure that this one will be my last. Perhaps I'll give it a chance again if I ever find it on tap."
"There isn't alot wrong with this brew... just nothing too great. I just normally don't appreciate fruit beers and especially traditional beer styles with a bunch of fruit thrown in. Again, not for me but alot of people will probably appreciate it."
"D- ill pass on this next time. the smell is about what it should be, but everything else falls short. i picked up the single because dark horse's blueberry stout isnt available yet, and this one didnt satisfy the craving. the alcohol is pretty well hidden or this would have been a complete disaster."
"D - Very drinkable. Doen't really taste that heavy. I could have another one at a bar."
"D: This is my first Fruit Stout... and blueberry is a nice touch with the creamy stout... Well balanced.... I'll look for this one again..."
"M: thinnish"
"Shared a case with friends. This beer is good in a surprising way. As in its good, not great, but pleasantly surprising. At first look at the label, I didn't think blueberries could stand up to the dark malts, but Buffalo Bill's nailed a good balance. Blueberries, juicy, upfront that fade into more subtle dark chocolate malts and a hint of smooth oats. Worth a try. Easily the best blueberry beer I've had, and I don't usually like Blueberry beers."
"D- its nice to have but notnice to drink more than 1 or 2 of. This would be a nice beer to have with an apple walnut salad."
"In the end, I appreciate the balance and aggression that this beer displays. But in the end, the conflict of flavors and textures cause the beer to be problematic and hurts the drinkability. The beer, as all Buffalo Bill's beers do, has a raw, homebrewed quality to them that I really do appreciate. Keep up the work, and keep challenging us."
"D: I was really looking forward to this stout. It was a complete letdown for me. The taste was awful, and I could barely finish one beer. This was the closest I've ever come to a drain pour."
"The body is good for a beer of this style and has excellent mouthfeel. Thisi is a very drinkable beer, good as a session ale."
"mouthfeel is thin and roasty, easy to drink, had no idea the alc was @ 7.5"
"Drinkability: I enjoyed the blending of this stout, enough fruit to make its presence known without being cloying and enough roasted barley bitterness to balance the fruit without drowning it out."
"A cola brown in color overall with very dark garnet highlights. Nice light beige, two-fingered head that recedes slowly. The aroma has a lot of blueberry fruitiness in the aroma. But still has a noticeable backbone of roasted malt and oats. Taste starts wih some lightly roasted oats, then some soft bread. Then the middle is all blueberry jelly. The finish then combines the roasted malts and sweet blueberries togther. Great, dry oatmeal palate with a splash of juiciness from the blueberries."
"Overall impression: Smells good, but the taste just doesn't back it up. I think its going to be a bit of a challenge getting through this six pack."
"This is decent, but it's not terribly smooth unfortunately. Blueberry aroma is nicer than the flavor. Not bad for a novelty now and again I suppose."
"I enjoyed this a lot more than their Orange Blossom offering (alco-pop?), and I remember their pumpkin ale not being so hot. The blueberry is just strong enough to give some flair, but not overdone enough to intrude. A unique and laudable beer that is impressive without being mindblowing. Chuck some more malt and blueberry in it and it might just be a killer. Probably wouldn't have another in quite some time, but I look forward to another meeting with it somewhere down the road..."
"Drinkability: wierd flavor combo makes this a unique beer to try, but more than one bottle would not be an option for me."
"Pours black with a tan head. Quite a bit of lacing on the way down. Nose is almost like coffee tones and blueberry. Flavor carries the blueberry too of course, but there is a biting tang that kind of detracts a bit. Still it is decent though. Pretty robust character overall. Sweet tangy tones are there for sure. Feel has a biting carbonation a bit and the liquid is fairly well bodied. Overall this is a pretty decent fruit stout. I can't say I have had a lot of them, but this one is working pretty well."
"drinkability: ok"
"D: I picked this up at OakTree in NJ as a single marked vintage. No date present whatsoever so I'm not sure how fresh this is. It was the last one they had on the shelf. I have a feeling it was somewhat dated. I'll try it again when I know it's fresh, but in the condition I drank this, I'd have to say that one would be enough for me."
"Thick at first, the carbonation leads this one towards the medium category. Chewy, but not overly so. Drying near the end with the touch of blueberries that only comes in the nose and onthe end. Unique, different, and worth a few."
"D: Actually not bad, a strange and unique combination that works to some extent. Wouldn't drink in multiples but worth a try to see for oneself."
"I was not disappointed - it's a typical quality oatmeal stout in appearance and mouthfeel. But it has a subtle but noticeable blueberry nose. The blueberry flavor is similarly subtle but pleasant and noticeable in the taste - a surprisingly good match with the sweeter oatmeal stout style. This beer is a candidate for a session beer, and might even be a good stout to drink well into spring."
"This one would pair well with blueberry waffles or pancakes. As one to drink alone...well...it lags a bit there."
"Buffalo Bill's Pumpkin Ale (my first review) isn't that good and Orange Blossom Cream Ale is even worse. Even though Blueberry Oatmeal Stout is the best of the lot, it isn't good beer by any stretch of the imagination. If you're curious, start with a single."
"D: Didnt read the abv on the bottle and was quite surprised. Well hidden and expected not to like, good surprise."
"I poured this strange brew into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was black as tar and had a big tan head. The smell was nice and really had the blueberrys too it. The tase however was a clash i thought. The blueberry was fake tasting and really soapy or perfummie taseting. I will not buy again."
"D: A very drinkable beer. Excellent taste with a very good, smooth mouthfeel to compliment the taste. Definitely a well-rounded beer that I would highly recommend."
"Drinkability: I was pleasantly surprised with this. With the higher alcohol content and the fruit backing the body, I imagine some folks wouldn't dig it too much, but especially since I'm not a big blueberry brew fan, this won me over. And around $9 a six-pack is certainly a good deal."
"Moderate carbonation and a sticky mouthfeel. Carbonation helps to cut come of the stickiness."
"I couldn't resist picking this up when I saw it on the shelf. I must admit I was skeptical, but it delivered as I hoped it would. Worthy of a try, not the best oatmeal stout out there, but a nice unique take on one."
" The 7.50% ABV is pretty detectable here, but it doesn't detract from the experience at all. This was one of the more interesting beers that I've tried lately, but I was just a bit let down by this. There's a lot of potential here, but everything comes up just a bit short. This is filling, easy-drinking, and not overpowering, but if I had some blueberries with me, I'd squeeze a few a toss 'em in. That's all this beer is missing..."
"A must try"
"I like the fruit stouts. The flavors seem to match up better than lighter beers. This one isn't perfect, but a very nice sipper. I'd pick this up again."
"Browsing around the Bottle King in Glen Ridge, I saw something that immediately caught my eye... ""Blueberry Oatmeal Stout""... not one to pass up an invitation on so interesting a combination, I was eager to give this one a try, being a fan of blueberries in general and having a strong liking for oatmeal stouts, this was certainly something different... My only other beer from this company was their pumpkin ale, which I really enjoyed, so I decided to give this one a go... Pours a deep, dark, chocolate color that gave way to a decent amount of foam that lingered for a bit... Smell is out-of-this world, with a very strong aroma of fresh blueberries that just bursts out...The taste was somewhat peculiar... different, but very satisfying... the blueberry element was definitely there, but stronger in smell than in taste... the stout flavor really pulls through, and the brew packs quite a punch with a hefty 7.5% alcohol content... Mouthfeel was good, but being such a strange combination with a pretty high alcohol content, drinkability is only average, as I wouldn't want to down more than two in a single setting... If you can find this one, definitely recommended..."
"Drinkability: Pretty good, but I can't see drinking a sixpack of this in one sitting."
"I would weakly recommend this beer."
