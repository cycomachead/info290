4,1,,,,,,"Gotta give some props to my man Alex for grabbing a bottle o' this whilst swinging through Munster on a trip and sharing it here with us.  This stuff pours a dark black-brown topped by a finger of leather-tan foam.  The nose comprises roasted malts, mild molasses, light graham cracker, cocoa, and a hint of leafy greens.  The taste brings in more of the same, everything going according to plan until a wave of milk-chocolatey sweetness bubbles through the center, washing over all through the finish.  A nice surprise, really.  The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a relatively full feel.  Overall, a damn solid stout, probably the best Three Floyds offering I've had in a while.","TMoney2591","Sep 01, 2014"

Smell is sweet molasses, dark chocolate with a light hop aroma and toasted notes coming through as it warms. Flavor follows suit with the nose - the hop flavor lingering throughout the roasted malt and sweetness (maybe sweetened with lactose) which is quite nice - I didn't expect such a hoppy oatmeal stout and was pleasantly surprised. The mouthfeel is silky smooth like a proper oatmeal stout, light bitterness from the hop lingers in this medium-bodied ale with mellow carbonation. Overall phenomenal take on an old classic style. Leave it to Three Floyds to take a classic style of old and spin it with a modern twist - nice work fellas!","DeanMoriarty","Jul 09, 2014"

4.13,4.3,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Final Word: Highly recommended for anyone that enjoys stouts or coffee! This brew was creamy, full flavored, well balanced and nuanced, and all of the flavors felt very true to the ingredient. The vanilla tasted like vanilla bean and not vanilla extract, and the coffee had the richness of real, fresh brewed, whole bean coffee. The caramel flavors brought the creamy texture, sweet vanilla, and bitter coffee together in perfect harmony, as if you were drinking a high quality cappuccino. Again, highly recommended!","Louisville-Beer-Reviews","Jun 20, 2014"

I have to rate it below "excellent" for reason (B) (yes, I take price into consideration when I review a beer). It's not as good as Anderson Valley's Barney Flats or Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout and it's considerably more expensive. That doesn't compute (even if the bottle does have some nice, paganistic "death metal" artwork). Nice beer, but overpriced and for fans of the the style only.","deadonhisfeet","Mar 01, 2014"

4.09,3.3,4.5,4.25,4,4,4,"D - A solid stout that I'd happily drink again. I liked the aroma a bit more than the flavor in the balance between sweetness and roast, but the taste is thankfully quite restrained in char too. Nate and I had no problem sharing a pint of this one, and it's a nice dark option with an otherwise hop-heavy tap list.","MasterSki","Mar 25, 2013"

This is by far the best stout I've had from 3 Floyd's. Next time I'll try and be a bit more sober for a proper review, but this was a awesome brew. If your at the brewpub get a pint and enjoy it!","IrishHockey","Jan 07, 2013"
