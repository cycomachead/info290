"Overall: Disappointed twice now on this stuff. I know it is rated high and everyone has different taste buds. Mine are just not firing here. I would like to have pulled a few more aroma and flavor notes out here. It is one step up from a Guinness extra stout for me but no more. Will not venture to this again."

"This is my gold-standard for oatmeal stouts.  It is so good I almost don't want to drink it.  Every oatmeal stout has something, some quality, that I would adjust in some way, except this one.  Perfect."
""
"Absolutely fantastic beer - this brewery knows stouts. Like big time."
"Taste got better and sweeter as the beer warmed up a bit a glass. Not too much chocolate or coffee, mainly oats. Great looking beer! Would buy again."
""
""
""
"Nice head. Good smell of English yeast. The front is malt, yeast, and roast. Every now and then I get the slightest hint of raise on the first drink when there is still good head. When held to light in a pint glass it is a deep dark reddish brown. You can see through it. A quality I always appreciate. Nice and smooth in the mouth as a patty stout should be. It's a great beer. In my top 5 stouts."
""
"Wow this stout blew me away. Pours black with a slight layer of tan foam. It's a traditional oatmeal stout which means it's perfect for any time of the day, particularly breakfast. The low ABV makes it easy to drink without getting drunk and adds to its smooth quality. Fantastic beer, best oatmeal stout I've ever had the pleasure of trying."
"Very smooth i am a quad drinker so for my first oatmeal stout i dont really have any other to compare it too. Im like stronger beers but this is pretty damn smooth and refreshing"

"A friend shared this with me. I thought it was a nice oatmeal stout, very smooth and mildly chocolate-ly, no real coffee flavor (which was nice in my judgment). But there are a lot of good oatmeal stouts out there.However, not interesting enough for me to purchase."
""
""
""
"Aroma of oats and hint of chocolate, subtle notes of molasses. Taste is medium dry with a small amount of bitterness with notes of coffee and grains. Very pleasantly creamy mouthfeel and a medium body. Possible metallic-like off flavor/aroma."
"355 ml brown bottle on a pint glass. Way too small a sample to enjoy this fine creation at full. Delicious!"
"I suppose this is the difference between an English and American stout, but this beer didn't have a whole lot of flavor for what it was. Tasted a bit thin and lacking, but still good. I think I'll stick to Imperial stouts and leave this one for the traditionalists."
"Deep brown pour with aroma of roast and chocolate. Sweet and soft on the palate. Very good."
""

"Bottle.  Started at 55 degrees.  I did not get much of an aroma, especially compared to its sibling imperial and chocolate stouts.  Pretty straight forward smell of grains and malts.  Not much chocolate or coffee.  Same with taste.  Smooth, minimal bitterness.  Mouth feel is between thin and medium.  Overall I would describe the taste as good but nondescript.  I would not drink it just to drink a beer--I'd reach for the organic chocolate or imperial stout.  But with a meal I would drink this over those.  Bottom line, Samuel Smith continues to impress me with its lineup."

"Absolutely loved this beer, best oatmeal stout I've had thus far, very very drinkable, taste is on point."

"A real nice oatmeal stout. earthy oatmealy creamy maltyness. Its good. Its really good.  Its dark. A nice creamy white head. Oatmeal. Malts. Whats the sweet note? is it chocolate? I dunno. Its good though. You should try it."

"Samuel Smith has a nice package deal out right now that includes their IPA, Organic Chocolate Stout, Oatmeal Stout, and a branded Irish-style imperial pint glass. Today I chose to give the old Oatmeal Stout a proper review. The beer pours with a giant, frothy cappuccino colored head, a full 2 fingers over the top of the glass. Picturesque! Like a root beer float. The awesome staying power of the head lingers over a deep black liquid with slight transparency and cherry accents. A distinct but mellow browned butter aroma greets the nose. Along with hints of raisin, smoke and minerals. The flavor is of mildly sweet butterscotch with subtle sour bitterness. Lime-like spiciness meets a roasted character with an herbal tobacco taste in the finish. It's a nice marriage of flavors, but the bitterness, though not excessive, still manages to overpower the malts a little. The brew is medium-bodied with adequate carbonation. Unremarkable, but suitable for the style I suppose. Overall, this is a staple for a reason. There's quite a bit of character packed in to this tame ABV offering from the English legend. If you've never tried it, it's a must have on any beer-tasting checklist."

"Smooth, pours well with a thick foam top. Felt it left something to be desired for how highly it came regarded."

"Best of the best. Perfection"
""
""

"Pours a dark brown body with a huge, fluffy tan head. Great lacing! Lots of oats and nuts in the nose, with cleaner in the background. Upon first taste, nothing other is oatmeal is present, but quickly the dark and roasted malts assert themselves. Sweet milk chocolate shows up towards then end to round out the flavor profile. Nice touch. Feels smooth, carbonated and very, very drinkable. Definitely lighter than I expected with almost zero bite. Overall, this oatmeal stout is much simpler than other American stouts (lower ABV, no syrupy qualities, or caramel notes), and therefore, can be critiqued for being a bit two-dimensional, but maybe I'm biased. Nevertheless, this is an oatmeal stout for anyone interested in getting into stouts. Worth every penny."

"O – A solid oatmeal stout, very straightforward, no flash because none is required.  Just enough bitterness to be well-balanced.  Quite drinkable, and with the lower ABV shouldn’t cause any problems to do so."
"A bit on the watery side. Freshness always a question. oats and burnt chocolate taste. Finishes on the bitter side. Does not stand out as a world class beer."

"Poured a deep amber color with a small creamy head that disappeared quickly to a fine lacing. Aroma was of toasted malts, mouthfeel was bland & light in carbonation. Taste was bland as well.....nothing but malts with an unpleasant aftertaste. I love oatmeal stouts but i couldnt even finish this one. Had to force down the half of a pint i actually was able to drink. Wouldn't seek it out again nor drink it if it was offered to me for free. Highly disappointed."

"Outstanding oatmeal stout, only knock I have is the annoying foil at the top of the cap, but the beer is amazing."

"Overall/Comments: Wow!  This is one tasty stout that is extremely well done.  This has a very good flavor profile and nose along with a nice body and drinkability.  This is a must try stout. Classified as an Oatmeal Stout @ 5% ABV.  Consumed 1/12/2014."

"THE standard for Oatmeal Stouts, exceptionally smooth & drinkable. One of my top 3 imports from England. This beer is a reminder to all of who invented the Stout!"
"One of the best stouts, and top 3 beers, I've ever had."
"Best God damn oatmeal stout!!"
""
"Overall, I completely understand why this is considered the standard for Oatmeal Stouts. Smooth and sweet, in addition to a taste that has been very well refined, this is one of the easiest drinking beers I've ever had."
"My favorite beer. It reminds me of simpler times. It's simple. So simple, it's perfect. I can drink this every day, at any temperature, with any meal. This is the definition of a beer. No bells, no whistles, nothing pretty. This is BEER."

"It pours a nice deep black color with a caramel colored one finger head that dissipates slowly. The aroma is that of chocolate and fresh bread. Taste is that of chocolate and malt, a nice spicy note comes in strong. Not terribly complex, but a great example of a nicely rounded stout. Feel is thick and creamy, sticks to the mouth and leaves a pleasant chocolate note that lingers. This is a great beer, one that I will be coming back to in the future."

"Really enjoyed this one. Pours a thick black with a khaki colored head. The smell was full of oatmeal and malt, with some sweet cream and milk chocolate in there too. The taste was heavy and a bit decadent with a milkshake like consistency. Lots of sweet chocolate and coffee flavors through out. Overall was very nice and very rich. Loved it."

"O - A fine stout.  A very fine stout.  Ultra-orthodox, and proud of the tradition it springs from, it offers a far better option at the price point than many a flashier stout from brewers on this side of the pond. What I will grab when a pure stout experience is what I'm after."

"Pours a viscous, thick, syrupy dark brown, almost black, opaque color. A tan head gives way to a sticky lace that retains throughout. Aroma is intoxicating. An earthy, roasted malt, bread and hint of burnt sugar. Taste is grainy, malty sweet, creamy, with a slight hops finish. Taste gets even better as the drink warms. I drank it without food, but would love to try again with chocolate. Feel is robust and full bodied; a meal in and of itself. Active carbonation that settles as the drink warms. I loved this beer and consider it an excellent example of stout."

"Overall: An excellent offering of this particular style, one of my favorite oatmeal stows out there and one of the best overall dark beers I've  yet to taste.  Far better than other offerings such as Guinness."

"Overall: Taken in isolation, this is an absolute belter of an oatmeal stout and worthy of anyone's time and attention. That said, it's probably the weakest of the Sam Smiths stout lineup (the Imperial is my favourite) but then it's up against some pretty stiff competition. Best enjoyed at your leisure - this really is too good to just chuck down your neck with wild abandon."

"Pours not completely black. It has darker brown hues and from the very middle of the glass emanating softly is a shy ruby blush.  Fat mousse like head of mocha colored foam that lasts, falls to a ring and leaves lace.  Nose is deep with roasted malt scents.  There's a sweet lush caramel , a bit of weak coffee, bitter chocolate and some scent from oats in the background as well.  This beer has an earthy woody scent too that is hard to pin down. Taste is luscious. Smooth, creamy and full.  The sweet caramel is first to grace the palate and then a big roasty taste follows. It has a bit of bitterness to it and it dries on the tongue leaving the coffee a bit stronger than on the nose and the bitter chocolate to come to finish.  At the last moments there is that woody and earthy taste again with that sweet and very soft caramel to linger alongside all those big roasty flavors of bitter malt.  I detected no hops on the  nose and I can find none on the palate save for that bit of woodiness and to say this beer is well balanced and a delight to the disposition if you ask me.  I like it precisely because it's not too sweet although it has an ample sweetness. Finishes with a bit of bite from carbonation."

"Pours almost pitch black with an outstanding head, lacing and retention.  Subtle nose of dark fruit (plum, raisin) with light notes of roast and chocolate as it warms.  Light bodied with little texture.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is laid back.  It consists of a blend of light roast and chocolate with a distinct mineral note. If you look for it, you can find the oat character. The finish has a slight metallic twang to it.  I suspect this bottle may be old, since what I'm tasting is nothing like the other reviews here.  If you don't bother to bottle date, then the reviewer can't take age into consideration."

"Overly malty with a burnt taste. I would also expect (and hope) that an oatmeal stout would be very smooth. This beer could barely be described as smooth, it also has a harsh finish that you would expect from a bitter pale ale. Stouts should be easy to drink in my opinion. There is a faint taste of chocolate."
""
"I love this beer. Big malt with coffee and chocolate greeting you with each smell and gulp. The taste has a little bit of a tang to it; kind of like coffee that you've brewed but let it sit in the pot until it cooled (it works for the good in this case). I'll get this again of course."

"O: I typically look for a higher abv, fuller mouthfeel stout when I'm drinking in the colder months, but this is perfectly suited for the change of seasons; it would also be great for a cold night when you plan to have more than a couple beers; in short, it's a great go to oatmeal stout"
""
"Pours a almost black in color with a good 3-finger thick creamy tan head that left lots of lacing when sipped. The aroma is of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and some oats. The taste is fantastic with lots of good favor from the above said items. Very smooth with no bitter finish. I can drink this one when it is 0 degrees or 90 degrees outside. Nice smooth finish with no bitterness or harsh aftertaste at all. Medium bodied with perfect carbonation. Always a favorite and a perfect ""10"" for me!"
"Overall this is a very good oatmeal stout and is certainly worth a try for anyone who enjoys this style."

"Samuel smith knows how to make the oatmeal taste dance around your taste buds and the smoothness to it makes you think it's a coffee drink not a beer. Love the smell after you take a sip of it near your nose it leaves you wanting more of it. The malt flavors are not over powering and coats your mouth with a sticky film that makes me love this stout so much. I would definitely recommend this stout to anybody who would love trying a stout for the first time."

"Large 550ml bottle, poured in an official Samuel Smith pint glass.  Dark color, pretty much black.  A very think, foamy head that dissipates very, very slowly and clings to the glass.  Creamy taste.  Extremely smooth.  Subtle, sweet, chocolate flavor, with a tough to describe earthy complexity.  I am surprised at how easy to drink this was."

"This is about a good as you can do. Dark, roasty, sweet, smooth. A tan head that follows you all the way down the glass. I remember the first one of these I ever had, it was like opening my eyes for the first time. There isn't a lot that can be said about Samuel Smith besides- ""Wow"" and ""Yes, please."" Also, considering there are a couple of bars here in Omaha where you can get a pint for under $5, it is a no-brainer go to beer."

"O- This is maybe the best sessionable stout I have come across and I'm glad I can easily find it at my local grocery store, it's even on sale from time to time. I do wish I could find it on tap more though. All of Samuel Smith's dark beers are impressive and I suggest everyone try them at least once. One of the best things about this beer is the mouthfeel, the oatmeal really gives it that silky texture that I love in my dark beers. This is also one of the first beers I had when I was getting in to craft beer, back when I wasn't really into IPAs."

"Overall: I had the Taddy Porter and this back to back and find the two very similar, with this having a oat character of course, less dark fruit, and a more pronounced chocolate and toffee character. Both are solid offerings if a little light. However, SS do make some of the smoothest beers I've had. I prefer this over the porter, but ill stick with the imperial stout over both of these for now. Next up is the nut brown ale"

"Pitch black in color with tan head. Coffee and chocolate aroma. Taste has many layers, coffee, chocolate, toffee, cream, soy sauce. Nicely carbonated. This is an outstanding stout. Taste and smell are both very complex. I'll definitely pick up a few of these next time i see it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all, it's a nearly perfect beer, and its great availability makes SS's Oatmeal Stout a must try in my opinion."
"The best oatmeal stout I've ever had and the standard which other oatmeal stouts are measured by. It was the first oatmeal stout I ever tasted and have not found one that even comes close. Hearty and not too sweet. Hints of chocolate, coffee and heaven."
""
""
""
""
""
"I dont get any real hop presence on the flavor piece of this beer and there is no alcohol either. Generally sweet and malty from start to finish with this one. A solid oatmeal stout that feels great and tastes good. Definitely worth buying if you are a malty."

"Poured a rich, deep opaque black, with dark brown highlights around the edges when held to light and three fingers of thick tan head that receded slowly and left abundant lacing down the glass. An excellent stout appearance, exactly what you look for in the style. Scents of soy sauce, roast malt, notes of dark chocolate, hard Yorkshire water and Samuel Smith's yeast. As it sits chocolate aromas become more prominent, alongside some faint hints of coffee and roast malt. There is also a low level of floral hop aromas. A very good, balanced, wonderfully presented oatmeal stout aroma. Flavor begins with a semi-sweet flavor profile reminiscent of dark chocolate with roasted malt undertones and notes of coffee with cream. Moves into a more bitter flavor, though still with an underlying slight sweetness and a greater flavor of roast malt. Finishes semi-dry with a roast malt presence and notes of coffee with cream. Aftertaste is roasted malt bitterness and hint of nuttiness from the oats. There are slight earthy notes throughout, mingling with the roasted malt flavors. A very nice overall flavor profile that is complex and deep, yet approachable and rustic. Very true to style. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with medium carbonation and a smooth, creamy, slick feel. Very true to form for the style and quite the wonderful beer to drink as a result. Overall this is an excellent, classic example of an oatmeal stout. It hits the style perfectly from aroma, to flavor, to mouthfeel and is simply a joy to drink. A wonderful beer."

"Pours a nice dark brown with a fantastic tan head. Smells malty with a slightly sweet scent. Taste is a nice very slightly sweet raisin malt with nice depth and flavor. Not too thick and not too thin. Some bitterness at the end but not too much. A very nice beer."
"Very very smooth better.. Dark look that pours out nice foam at the top... It has a oatmeal-caramel taste to it ... I can have a 4 pack of this beer all day.. It's casual taste makes it very enjoyable to drink...Great Stout.. One of my favorite Stouts"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A great stout for someone who is new to stouts like me. Not really bitter and more sweat but it still retains its stout characteristics."
"Samuel Smith's beers are the standard. This beer pours a dark liquid. Very little foam forms. Smell is faint, a bit of coffee. Taste is really nice. Balanced malty bitterness, acidity is present, a bit of creaminess and dryness. Mouthfeel is light, easy to drink. Perfectly balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall I must admit I am slightly disappointed after reading the reviews on here. It is not bad, but it is also not the best oatmeal stout I've had. I might purchase again, hard to say. Probably not, since the store I buy it from sells it for $3.50 a bottle and I can get a better tasting oatmeal stout with more abv at the same price."

"Poured from a 22 into point glass. It's dark to almost black  with a nice inch head with little lacing. Really nice sweet malty smell. It has a great sweet caramel taste on the palate with light roasted notes. It has a sticky thick mouthfeel with semi dry finish. Overall very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown to almost black in color. An inch of khaki colored head rests on top. Brussels lacing. Smell of oatmeal is present and yet a bit subdued. I get caramel,dark malt,and oatmeal in the palate. The fade is a blend of bitterness from the hops and then back to dark malt and caramel. The mouth is dry and creamy."

"Overall: I'm surprised this beer is so low on abv, it smells and taste like maybe a 7.0 abv, but moving right along. This beer is damned drinkable. No harshness, no incredible bitter or dry finish. The finish is just right, actually, a little dry, a little hoppy. It's actually hard for me to express how easy it is to drink this beer. I'll probably fall back to this stout when I want to drink a good beer and a lot of it. Well done."

"Poured from a 550mL bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass."
""
""
""
"Enjoyed from 550 ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. A dark coffee brown brew with reddish tinting and a decent-sized brown head. Aroma is rich and malt-forward, with cocoa powder, fruity yeast like apples and pears, medium-roast coffee, and a faint caramel sweetness putting in appearances. A well-rounded, sophisticated, and multifaceted brew as one would expect from such a classic, featuring chocolate milk, almond, caramel, vanilla, and coffee flavors, with the caramel gaining traction later as the dark malts lose some steam. Sourish and tangy from acidic dark malts and fruity yeast esters, yet smooth and creamy. The body is lighter than expected. Finishes long, smooth, and earthy, with a little butterscotch and a cereal grain type of sweetness. I get little in the way of harsh burnt or charred notes. Depending on the source one consults, oats either fail to add much flavor while contributing body, or they do add an astringent flavor note ... I certainly get the latter here although the source is difficult to pinpoint. In my mind (and to my palate), this is considered the prototype of the style for a reason. Less sweet than a milk stout but has some of the same desirable mouthfeel characteristics."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Absolutely wonderful. Pitch black with creamy tan head, great retention and lacing. Nose was nice and roasty with cocoa and vanilla. Taste followed - delicious cocoa, coffee, and a bit of caramel. I'm sure this would be great over ice cream. Not as heavy as I was expecting. Don't have much experience with oatmeal stouts, but if I tasted this blind I would swear it was a milk stout. Very delicious way to finish an evening."

"I have had Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout perhaps more than any other beer period. I have always been a fan of dark chocolate and coffee, and this beer provides delicious notes of both. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and it leaves your tongue wanting more. This is the beer that I would be happy with any time of the year paired with anything."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown pour but deep red hues appear when held to the light. Very good head, thick and foamy. Aroma is mainly oatmeal but chocolates flakes are also present. Flavor tapers off a bit but retains the oatmeal character though not full-bodied. Bit of burnt smoke hidden in there."
"O: If you look up oatmeal stout, Noah Webster should have a picture of this beer label next to it. That said, with the rise of breweries offering this style, it is not the best available anymore, but it is certainly one of the originals and for that alone it is worth checking out from time to time."

"The first bottle i picked up as a single on the road and was forced to drink out of the bottle , but it was quite good. A nice pleasant malt/ vanilla flavor. I was quite impressed. However I bought a 4 pack and busted one out and poured it in a glass and it was not quite as good as the one I had had before. Possibly a bad bottle. Not terrible , just not as good. Still would recommend if you can find at a decent price. I think i overpaid at 12.99 a 4 pack"

"A decent brew, though I can't say it blew me away. Looks spot on, while the aroma and flavour possess a blend of dark malt, grain and understated fruity notes. Body is OK yet could stand to be more creamy. Goes down easily enough, however the distinctive roastiness that I'd expect from a stout is lacking - the overall character is too muted. Worth sampling if you come across it."

"This is not a thick stout for contemplating in your mansion's study. This is a beer for enjoying at the pub, with the game on while talking with friends. A perfect compliment to a conversation, but never the focus."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Starts off fairly thin and steadily increases into a full and creamy body. There is a constant semisweet chocolate flavor which is balanced by an earthy hop bitterness. The finish is sweet with roaster malt character and baker's chocolate. The aroma was pleasant and malty, virtually no hops."
""
""
""
""
""

""

"For an Oatmeal Stout I was quite disappointed in this beer. Why would you even make an Oatmeal Stout with only a 5% alcohol content? I won't say it's a bad beer, but why it gets such high ratings on here, I cannot understand why. It has high carbonation which is ok, but it lacks kick or punch that good oatmeal stouts have. The head was not very dark, so it just seemed weird to have such a dark beer with a light head. Some people might enjoy this beer and I think those that do do not like strong tasting beers. If you are looking for a step up from a Guinness beer this might be for you, but if you like strong intense beers, which I expect from an Oatmeal stout, this beer isn't for you."

"Taste follows the nose. Caramel malt punch backed by dark fruit raisin, currant, plumb with a slight floral hop bitterness. Very creamy in the mouth and finishes dry with subtle oakiness."

"O-classic oatmeal stout, great flavor and body"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Deep, dark brown in color with dark red hues on the edges of the glass and good clarity. Poured with a thick beige foam that slowly reduced to a wispy cap. Roasted malt, sweet dark chocolate, toffee, and cereal aromas. Thick, creamy smooth feel with subdued, but tangy carbonation at the back end. Roasted and toasted malts with bready cereal flavors up front. Hop bitterness slowly emerges through the middle and expands to the end converting the malt notes to dark ripe fruit flavors. Roasted malt and hop flavors quickly exit from front to back with an incredibly dry finish."

"O- My first oatmeal stout, so I figured I'd start with one of the best. Wasn't disappointed - plenty of sweet and malty flavors to keep your interest."

It was a hell of an experience drinking this beer and would recommend this to anyone who likes stouts or is looking for one of the best stouts out there. The perfect beverage on those cold winter nights when you need something to warm you up."

"Poured from a bottle into SA glass it's black with a one inch head, which leaves streaks as it disappears. Smell is dark fruit, maybe prune. Taste seems bitter and coffee-like at first, then it seems to evaporate in your mouth leaving a slight taste of dark fruit. MF is medium, no alcohol and carbonation noticed. Very smooth. OA a tasty beer on the very slightly bitter side. I could easily --- "" have more than one""!"
""
"O: I liked this beer and I wanted to review it having tasted it before. Having said that, I liked the Ipswich Oatmeal Stout better. I think it had more to offer and I was left wanting another sip. This beer is outstanding. It is just not my favorite."
""
"O: A great example of the style. Nothing too offending or pretentious, just solid."

"Poured into a chilled, but not frosted pint glass. Very dark brown, almost black. medium head, low retention. Very roasted, almost sweet smell. Molasses smell perhaps. Taste is great. Hints of oats, grapefruit, coffee and chocolate. Sweet, but not in a bad way. slightly creamy, but not thick. Very, very smooth. Not a session brew, more of a desert item. Would be fantastic with meat, stews or even pasta. Will most certainly purchase again. My advice.. serve this at a ""cellar"" temperature w/ some meat and potatoes. It will not disappoint."

""
""
""
""
""
"This one's been in the cellar for nearly two years. Dark brown, nearly black pour with a quickly fading one finger beige head with minimal lacing. Somewhat subdued roasty nose with hints of toffee, dark chocolate, coffee, and nuts. The taste is roasty and nutty with hints of coffee, dark chocolate, burnt toast, tobacco, dark fruits, toffee, oats, and some subtle vinous notes as well. The mouthfeel was a bit thin and fizzy at first, but as it warmed it became thicker and creamier with a slightly sweet finish. Overall, I'm not a huge fan of Oatmeal Stouts, and this just didn't have enough body for me."
""
""
""
""
"One of the all time classic stouts and still the standard bearer for oatmeal stouts, if you ask me. I do agree that Rogue's Shakespeare could be the best U.S. made equivalent, but Samuel Smith's nearly perfect stout still wins for me. Usually, it is priced at an accessible rate where I live."

"Poured from a bottle into a 16 oz champaign flute. Builds a sturdy 3/4"" head that eventually reduces to lovely lacing. Color is dark brown, which reveals a deep ruby tinge when held up to a bright light. Aroma is rich and complex, malt, coffe and hops. Flavor is deep, complex, with roasted malt, coffe, hops, a bit piney, and a little fig. Mouthfeel is medium full. Overall this is a terrific oatmeal stout."

"Awesome lighter dessert like flavors in a beer that's highly quaffable. The quintessential oatmeal stout. Brewers these days are so obsessed with pushing the flavor and ABV boundaries in stouts, when this is just as satisfying and not nearly as intoxicating or calorie dense."
""
""

"Overall - a stout that makes you feel like you want to drink stouts all day, whereas I have always felt that stouts were situational, but this makes me feel that they can be unilaterally spectacular"

""
""
""

""
""
""
""

"O-This is a great beer and one that reminds me of why I like lower ABV stouts. The smell immediately suggests oats, and unlike more aggressive brews, the oats smell (and taste) authentic. They aren't drowned in alcohol or oak barrel. The feel is also a highpoint. This is one smooth beverage."

"very good, unexpectadly smooth for a stout, pours heavy and dark but drinks smooth and subtle, with enjoyable notes of coffee and fruit. nice balance of sweetness, just enough hops to offset the sweetness of the beer. overall great, the contrast between the rich color and subtle taste is a great attribute. can be enjoyed by most beer drinkers, which is impressive for a stout."

"My dad claims that this is the best beer that he's ever had, but I've had better oatmeal stouts that were made right here in Michigan. I know my opinion is an unpopular one, but it is what it is. S.S.O.S. is a drinkable, easy-to-session sort of beer, but it's not how I like my stouts."

"Its so smooth and delicious i wish i could take a bath in it. Drink while eating a steak and mash potatoes or while watching the game it doesnt matter you will enjoy it all the same."
"Pours a slightly thick black with a small tan head. Mildly roasted sweet caramel and chocolate malts fill the senses along with some sweet oatmeal grains dark fruity esters. Taste same as aroma. Palate is a rich creamy body with light carbonation. The finish is sweet mildly roasted caramel and chocolate malts, some dark fruity flavors with light bitterness on the end for balance. A very good, tasty and nicely balanced brew. I like."

I bought it in a 1 pt, 2.7 fluid oz bottle and wish I had gotten at least 2 of them. Wonderful taste and mouthfeel. I was sad to see the last sip in the glass. Gonna go pick up a couple of the four-packs tomorrow. Would definitely recommend to anyone who likes or even slightly enjoys a good stout."

"I love stouts... This is a nice sweet oaty flavour.. Mouth feel was very full. Sweet dessert stout even though I drank it on a hot day and I was drunk. It happens. Samuel smith has made this beer right. Only a couple other stouts I would take over this one. Bear republics big black and firestone walkers parabola."

"The mouthfeel was ecstatic, and one can really taste the oatmeal. Moreso, the aftertaste is like coffee- like, real coffee. Not like Kona Brewery's attempt at ""coffee beer", but good coffee- and without even trying. If you have ever drank malta or any other high-quality, non-alcoholic malt beverage, you probably know what I'm talking about. This beer is dark, smooth, and just unforgettable. The head has more staying power than Guinness Extra Stout, and the head alone is more flavorful than the body of most beers. This stuff is expensive and hard to find, but totally worth it."

"Wow this beer blew me away. Knocked my socks off. This was the first Oatmeal Stout I tried and it's so far been the best. I was a little bummed it only came in a four pack and that it was pricey but damn was it worth it. The grain, the oatmeal, the wheat, the creaminess...wow. It was truly like Oatmeal in a bottle...with beer. Highly recommend this beer."

"Hmm... Up until now, Samuel Smith's dark beers have been spot on for me across the board. Not to say the Oatmeal isn't good, but it was just very mild and underwhelming compared to their others. Reserved nose, some chocolate and oats. There's a lot of people claiming tons of smokiness in this and I really don't get it. Mild chocolate and toasted oats. I would like to taste more oats to be honest. Body is smooth and silky. This is a very easy drinker, delicious and true to form."

"O - This is quite easily the best easy to find oatmeal stout out there, and my favorite offering from Samuel Smith! Definitely try this if you're into stouts, it's relatively cheap given the quality."

"O- My fav from this brewery. So well done. Found this in my sis-in-law's fridge and I couldn't be any more happy to take it off her hands since she had never heard of Samuel Smith. Gets better and better as it warms."

"550ml bottle. BB ?/15. Pours a very dark, ruby brown with a dense tan head which lasted the distance and left some lacing. Gentle aroma of dark malts, coffee, molasses and sherry. Creamy, sweet taste gives way to a semi-dry finish, reminiscent of dark chocolate. Light to medium body and ""silky texture"". A very pleasant, easy drinking drop."
""
""
"Sammy Smith Oatmeal Stout is like a scoop of coffee ice cream. It is like a sweet piece of velvety chocolate cake with coffee icing resurrected as a beer. Since I think I overdid myself expressing just how damn sweet this beer is, I should also add that it drinks like a Smooth Criminal (lame I know.) An overall amazing beer, looks amazing, smells amazing, tastes amazing and feels amazing."

"This classic brew pours a pitch black color, and is topped with a tall, creamy froth. Near perfect appearance for the style. The aroma is sublime... cereal grains are intermingled with sweet chocolate and some light fruit esters (green apple & pear). Fortunately, the flavor is just as fantastic. Along with the aforementioned aspects, we also get some molasses, raisin and a trace of crisp bitter hops. The finish is quite earthy & roasty, with a light mouth feel. Thoroughly enjoyable and complex."

"Tiny cascading bubbles transition to a thick, tan three fingered head with the consistency of a pillow. Dark brown with red hues around the edge of the glass. Love the look. Smell: Licorice, bitter chocolate, sough dough bread. Classic stout flavor.. well balanced, malty, rich and goes down smooth. Mouthfeel: Dry, medium to heavy texture. Overall: No better stout in my opinion when you want a break from the high ABV versions of the style and you just want that straight up, traditional, dark ale goodness."
""

"I've tended to avoid Samuel Smith's for a long time due to a number of bad experiences with lightstruck beers from the clear glass bottles. This bottle came in a boxed 3 pack, all in the darkest brown glass bottles I've ever seen. After sampling all 3, my opinion on this brewery is now completely changed. Quite possibly the best oatmeal stout I've had."
"I wish i could find stuff like this on tap in the states, but I know there is not much chance of that happening."
""
""
""
""
"Not many Stouts can be considered session beers but this fit that bill. Although I only bought one bottle, I could have had another during my sitting since this went down pretty easily and smoothly. I expected this to be a bit more filling and strong but even though it wasn't, I enjoyed it a lot and can see why it's rated so highly. There's a lot to like here and something in it to appeal to everyone. Nearly every aspect of this beer lends to it's status as a classic."

"550 ml bottle into imperial pint glass, bottled on 8/3/2012. Pours crystal clear almost opaque dark brown color with a nice 2 finger dense and fluffy light tan head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, cocoa, molasses, oatmeal, dark bread, toast, light apple, floral, and earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt notes with some light fruitiness. Taste of caramel, molasses, cocoa, oatmeal, toast, roasted malt, dark bread, floral, and roasted earthiness. Light floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, molasses, oatmeal, cocoa, toast, roasted malt, dark bread, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark malt notes with moderate hops; with great flavor robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent oatmeal stout. Very nice balance and complexity of dark malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"As anyone can tell by my high rating numbers for this beer, I really am a fan of Smith's Oatmeal Stout. The number one seller for me is the richness of its taste. I really enjoy its full mouthful, and that coupled with a caramel, chocolate, and coffee-like flavor, makes me happy when I pour a glass of this into my favorite mug. The head is full, and the latticework is enticing. Darn good beer!"
""
""
""
""
"T: A rich, roasted grain and bread flavor throughout, faint roasted malt, cola, chocolate malt and some molasses. Just a hint of dark fruit as well. The mouthfeel is velvety as hell and makes this feel way bigger than it is. A fantastic stout."
"i cant add anymore to whAt is already here i was afaid to try this because i thought it may be heavy or i just wont like it but i do the part it being bittersweet well if that bittersweet i wish all beer tasted like that in the end if your looking to drink this beer forthe frist time my review wont help but the thousands other will pour a glass and read a review enjoy"

"OK...I've had this brew for perhaps 30 years...always a modest body and flavorful beer. Perhaps the standard bearer for oatmeal stouts...tasty and respectable on a consistent basis."

"Poured 550mL bottle with foil wrapped top into 34oz mug. Oily brown pour, jet black in the glass with thick tan head that sticks around. Smell is creamy coffee with a bit of chocolate. Taste is like the smell; creamy and sweet at first, then roasted coffee and bitter chocolate, with a bittersweet finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and full. It's no wonder this is the top rated beer of its style on here."

"Picture yourself sitting back with the cigar in one hand and this beer in the other and let your mind relax into a world of simple pleasures, this is the quintessence of Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout. Once long ago, subjected to a sheltered life of Guinness stouts, oblivious of what the real world had to offer, I now know the true meaning of beer excellence and the cost it takes to be enlightened yet again and again. The questions in my mind spinning around like a hamster wheel on steroids. Is the cost worth the roasted malts, tan head, creamy sweetness, roasted coffee, chocolate flavors and a balanced taste so good it makes your tongue slap your brains out? Yes!"

"Absolutely dark, the appearance is certainly elegant, with such beautiful tanned neck. You can identify caramel and expresso. The taste is sweet, with slight bitterness, where you can tell the oatmeal and the expected caramel/coffee. The full, silky body also has high drinkability, with a very comforting, malty, bready, aftertaste. Absolutely excellent for a session drinking with your best friends."

"This Tadcaster is a Tad over hyped methinks. While it is indeed very smooth and easy to drink there is almost no flavor to it. Light bodied. I get intensely sweet caramel, honey and a splash of espresso on the nose. But the flavor is watery on the start and the finish. The little hops character which is there is well balanced against the unique sweetness the oats add. So I do get why it is a widely enjoyed stout, but I prefer something more flavorful. It is good, just not my favorite."
""
""
"Overall: This is a solid stout. I find that the “mushroom” taste takes away from the enjoyability of the coffee/malt combination, and for me, this is the beer’s weak point. Aside from that, there is nothing much to complain about. Give it a try."

"APPEARANCE: A foam that gives way to a thin layer of light ivory persistent. Foam marks are retained almost from the height reached by the serving. Black as coal. Nothing maroon or reddish tones. AROMA: It has very defined or intense odors. TASTE: Very smooth and creamy, a little sweet, no conflict and, therefore, quite bland. After a few minutes, it leaves a sour taste that is not unpleasant. Despite being an oatmeal stout, I notice no difference with respect to that. Overall rating: Not as good as they say. I thought a beer right, but nothing more. Perfect for those who do not want the ales or protruding tastes or smells of that love or hate. Not worth the expense: 2.95 euros."

"Not to my liking. Do i feel excited after trying this style defining brew? No. Oatmeal stuff is not for me. Very smooth and easy. A good balance but at 5.5% i am thinking i paid a lot."

"Overall- I think this is a great example of an oatmeal stout, I could only imagine what one would taste like fresh from the brewery. I think this gets better as you drink it."

I've had this tons of times by now, and whether or not it may not be the most accurate take on the style, it's still extremely yummy and true meal in its own right. I could have something like this for breakfast if I wanted and not feel guilty about it. Without a doubt my favorite so far by Sam Smith's!"
"Overall a beer I would never turn down. Would love to try it closer to the source. Real balanced and light enough to session all night."

"Enjoyable, but not remarkable. I was expecting more maybe because this one's considered a benchmark."
""
""
""
"Overall - Overall a good easy drinking stout, nothing too spectacular. A little rough around the edges, my experiences with this beer on tap have been better than this bottle. Definitely a classic though and I will continue to come back."
"Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout ---3/5."
"As far as oatmeal stouts go, this is a staple. Perfectly balanced all the way around from the roasty coffee and chocolate flavors to the soft carbonation. I would love to be sitting in an old English pub drinking this right now."

"Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout pours jet black, with a billowing three plus fingers of mocha foam crowning the beer and filling the glass. Head retention is just alright, and lacing, while left in a solid ring near the top of the glass, is fairly spotty underneath. The nose is highlighted by a soft coffee aroma, met by a light touch of fruity esters. The flavor adds a mild chocolate flavor, which plays well against the subtle, coffee with cream roast. Those classic English esters help close things out. The body is wonderful, subtly full and featuring that great silky character that one finds in a well executed oatmeal stout. The carbonation is on the low end of the spectrum, just as it should be. There's nothing overly complex or ""in your face"" about Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout, it's just a flawless rendition of one of my favorite styles."

"O: Just a great beer, with many classic stout flavors blended well, but overly thick or overly sweet. Just the look of the poured beer is frankly my favorite look in a beer, what gets me the most excited visually: that dark bottom and nice strong stiff head. For me, it's a perfect pair with sticky cakes (shoofly pie, sticky buns), strong smoked meats, or just a gray morning. 4.5/5"
""
""
"definitely a heavier brew and one of my favorites for this style, although i prefer a higher abv with my stouts. it's almost comparable to a meal in that the heaviness weighs in the stomach. the appearance is definitely its greatest trait. it feels good in the mouth and is one which can be sessioned- to a degree. a great one from england!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor was lighter than expected. Well balanced, a bit sour on the back of the tongue that rounded out with a mild oatmeal. I guess I was hoping for a more full bodied taste with a bit more of an oatmeal presence. A good well balanced brew though."

"I view this as the benchmark for oatmeal stouts. It's simple and a prime example of the style. Delicious and rich beer."

"So easy to drink - love it."
""
""
""

"It's got a good ""crunchy"" flavor and a heavy taste that I love. The drawback for me is that because the beer is not as popular, I've had some bottles that we re slightly off. So I only tend to buy this in high traffic areas."

"Overall drinks well but seems to me more akin to a dry stout in that the characteristics of an oatmeal stout are not there. It's not as smooth, velvetty, or sweeter like an oatmeal. I would at the very least expect it to be heavier on the palette."

"This is my second oatmeal stout and I find it to be delicious, better than the first one I tried, by Sierra Nevada; which was quite good too. Everything is very well blanced. I will be trying more brews in this style and more brews my Samuel Smith."
""
"Pours an opaque, very dark brown with glints of cola brown around the bottom and edges when held to the light. A large, fluffy, dark caramel-colored head forms quickly and retains a little better than average. Once it dissipates, splotchy and spiderweb lacing is left on the edges of the glass, while a thin cap sits atop the beer. Aromas are comprised primarily of sweet chocolate and sorghum. While these aromas come through distinctly, they are not overly bold. There are also notes of roasted malt and ripe cherry. Mouthfeel is smooth, and not too viscous. The mild hop on the finish accentuates the light carbonation scrubbing. Flavors come through almost as distinctly as the aromas. However, everything is mild. In a time of craft brewers competing for the biggest beer, it's nice to sip a stout that has a lot of flavor in different varieties without having my palate overwhelmed. Mild chocolate, sorghum, and ripe fruit esters occur, essentially in that order. I regard this a quintessential stout."

"This is one outstanding stout! Thick, creamy, tasty and satisfying, you cannot go wrong. I will sure as hell have this again, as long as I can find it."
"A cascading dark tan head eventually settles majestic atop this dark brown brew. A slow disintegration results in a landscape of rocky lace. Big nutty and sweet aromas overlay dark chocolates, sweet bread and a hint of plum. Tastes nutty with a little less molasses sweetness involved. A vein of dark licorice coincides with a quick punch of cocoa toward the end. Weighs unexpectedly light to medium, and one could argue there's a wateriness, although the argument would be short lived as inconsequential. This is not an overly complex beer, but it is a well balanced and eminently rewarding beer that shows revisitation of basic (sometimes forgotten beers) can be just as rewarding, if not more so, than tasting the newest of trends or extremes."

"O: this sets the bar for oatmeal stouts, flavors are balanced and not overpowering, low alcohol content keeps it refreshing"
""
""
"Final Thoughts: The first sip was great, but after that the metallic after-taste starting to become more apparent. That's too bad because this was a very promising beer. Would I drink it again? Yes, I'd like to find a fresh bottle or have it on-tap to give it another chance."

"Poured into a Guinness pint glass. Near black in color with maybe a one finger tan head that quickly dissipates. Not much lacing as I drank it. Smell is a sweet cocoa and expresso. Taste is really sweet which i didn't care too much for. Reminds me Hershey syrup. I also get a bit of vanilla, expresso, and just a touch of nuttiness and fruit (cherries?) which I noticed when I had Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale. Mouth feel is quite smooth, but the carbonation and sugar leave my mouth feeling like I had a soda. Overall I can't say I'm big on it."
"One of the most recognizable oatmeal stouts out there, and for a good reason. Nicely done, easy to get, and reasonably prices. Often considered the ""benchmark"" for oatmeal stouts, and I think I can see why."

"O: Disappointed by not even having a hint of oatmeal, still a great stout, cream of the crop right here."

"Overall an exceptional beer. Very well balanced, nuanced, and complex. The relatively mild ABV is a big plus here, meaning knocking back several beers at a sitting is quite doable. A true classic."

"Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer was good. Not quite for me though. Cost a lot for a beer too. Oatmeal stouts are meant to be creamy and I don't get that. If they would have just called it a stout then I might have liked it more. Good beer overall."
""
"O: The grandaddy of all oatmeal stouts, it makes sense why this one is more dry than sweet. Even though I prefer sweet to dry, I have to give this beer props for history's sake."

"This a world class offering. It pours a nearly opaque onyx color with a beautiful one finger caramel colored head. Retention is good and the lacing is elaborate. The smell is pine, soy sauce, and just a hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is just perfect. I really don't know any other way to describe it.The taste is sweet with a gentle finish that is hops, chocolate, coffee, and toffee. I know this is a well regarded beer, and its reputation is well deserved."

"Poured in a large snifter a very black with a caramel half inch head which dissapated to a ring. Had a great lacing which hung around. The smell was of dark fruits, yeast, malts. The taste was very creamy, dark chocolate, malts, dark fruits. Very yummy. The mouthfeel was moderate to thick. Overall a great beer. My favorite Oatmeal Stout at the moment. Gets better as it warms. Nice low abv. One could drink a couple of these in a setting."

"Less body than I anticipated, not really much more than medium, effervescence is appropriate, just under middle-of-the-road with a sharpness on the tip of the tongue. A beer you could easily drink several of over the evening due to the low ABV but I just don't get the appeal of this brew. I'm sure its better on tap (what isn't) but this is just not grabbing me. Though it is better than standard Guinness, it's less than Guinness Foreign Extra and many others."

"Overall this is a fabulous, complex oatmeal stout. An old favorite. Just now getting around to rating it."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with a nice medium tan head and lacing. Looks nice. Malt, smoky malt and light coffee flavors up front, with a malty middle and somewhat sour, dry finish. A bit thinner than most stouts I've been drinking, but respectable for a 5% ABV. A nice stout from a great brewery."

"When I first had this (over four years ago), it totally blew my mind. Unfortunately, now I realize that there are better oatmeal stouts. The only issue that I really have here is that this is too sweet. Regardless, it's still a classic."

"Beautiful dark, molasses color with a tan, 2 finger head that lasted well, leaving a thin layer atop the beer until the last sip. Smells of vegemite and chocolate. Sweet, complex, yeasty taste, slight coffee undertones. Thinner mouthfeel, leaving a clean palate. Loved this beer - complements a meal to perfection, holding its own, without overpowering the food."

"Overall this was a fantastic Oatmeal Stout. This was also my first experience with the style, so I really don’t have a good frame of reference. Regardless, it was a very tasty brew!"
""
"O: As a whole, an absolutely outstanding oatmeal stout. Unlike any other than I've ever had. Would have liked a little more head and a little more fullness out of the beer, but the flavor and the aftertaste can't be beat. Will be purchasing again."

"Good beer, maybe a tad overrated."

"Poured into a glass mug. Pours dark brown with a large tan head that dissipates slowly. There are aromas of coffee, dark chocolate, and dark roasted malts. It smells sweet. It tastes like it smells. It's sweet with flavors of chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, and hops. The body is medium and this is a very smooth beer with enough carbonation. This is a solid and drinkable stout. If you like stouts, this is one I recommend."
"Drinkability: a very good beer in the style Oatmeal Stout. To drink at cellar t° (13 °C) with a chocolate cake."
""
"Overall: Pretty decent stout, though I was expecting something a bit more after seeing the reviews on here. It was still a fairly solid stout though."
""
""
""

"O: Definitely up there for sweet oatmeal stouts. A lot fruitier than I was expecting. A bit light-bodied, but good nonetheless."
""
""
"Smooth, lightly carbonated, and dry. Wonderful."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: More of a grainy, malty taste came as the beer warms. Not overly intense in flavour in my opinion, but smooth and pleasant."

"Deep dark opaque brown with just a bit of a reddish hue. Tan head was on the thin side but leaves a very nice lacing down the glass. Aroma of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, caramel and much more. Silky smooth mouthfeel and finishes with just enough bitterness to make it enjoyable."
""
""
"O: Very drinkable, almost a session stout. Good thing it has the standard American 5%."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I really like the Oatmeal Stout and this one cranks up the robustness a notch or two in my opinion. It's got a more pronounced flavor."
""
""
""
""
"Moderate carbonation, lots of flavor and sweetness for a low ABV. Well balanced with a nice clean finish and smooth, enjoyable aftertaste. I quite like this."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very satisfying and rich similar to a good coffee or port that can stand alone without food. This is the best oatmeal stout that I have had so far. It is dessert onto itself."
""
""
""
""
"Medium-bodied with an exceptionally smooth quality to it. Carbonation is present, but it just slightly lifts the beer on the palate, making the smoothness all the more noticeable. Finish is pleasantly dry."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Very nice example of the style. I tried it because I enjoyed the imperial stout from this brewery and i am glad I did."

"Overall - Such a classic, amazing Oatmeal Stout. Benchmark of the style!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There's a reason this continues to be the standard for oatmeal stouts. It's really freaking good, and all those characteristics I associate with the style shine through clearly. The oats are ever-present, bringing light sugary sweetness and mouth-filling fluffiness. An incredibly drinkable, sessionable stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Black with ruby highlights, and a great heap of creamy brown head and excellent retention. Great looking beer. Bready and roasted malt. Bready and dark roast, leaning towards chocolate. Mouthfeel is exceptional. Full bodied and smooth as silk. Overall a fine beer indeed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"SS Oatmeal Stout is a good smelling and tasting beer with a fantastic mouthfeel. I picked this up as a gift pack with two other offerings and a glass for 10 bucks. A world class deal at a price that can't be beat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark black. Aroma is that of caramel and malt. The taste is where this beer really shines. Molasses, toffee, coffee, caramel and plums are present. The ABV is hidden well with little alcohol presence. The swallow is very good and invites you to drink it again."
""
"Overall: What have I been missing, this beer is already a favorite. I have seen it at the beer spot by my house handful of times and finally gave it a shot. I do not read reviews before writing one nor the numbers but this beer as far as taste is concerned is top of the food chain. I hope you all have enjoyed as much as I have, Salud!"
""
""
""
"This beer pours a very dark brown with an amber tone peeking through in the light. There was a thin head and lasting lace. It's aroma is of chocolate, coffee, dark toast and a hint of smoke. The flavor is dark chocolate, coffee and some mild anise. A bit of maple shows up in the finish. The mouthfeel is full, smooth and creamy. Samuel Smiths Oatmeal Stout is a good brew, complex and very well balanced. Highly recommended."
""
""
"O - An exceptionally delicious stout. Rich tasting but not overpowering. Well-rounded with subdued flavors that please any palate."

"Samuel Smith has a very good history for making quality beers. This is one of the great flagship offerings."
"O: a good straightforward stout. Nothing fancy. Its gets down to business with great roasted malt flavor and brings you back for more with a great mouthfeel and finish. Reminds you that great beer can be found right in front of you with the most simplistic and traditional of recipes."
""
"Overall, a great beer which I will look forward to drinking again-hopefully on tap, or nitro-tap."
""
""
""
"Overall, an exceptionally good stout. As I said, it's kind of like the Stone Imperial Russian Stout, but this one doesn't burn your throat as it goes down. A wonderfully crafted brew that is a must-drink for aficionados and connoisseurs alike."

""
"Notes- Original tick of this beer scored it at 4."

"RJT"
""
""
"Overall - I don't know which is better, this or Founders. I think I have to give Samuel Smith's the nod, although Founders is much cheaper. This beer actually gets better the closer it gets to room temperature. Although I served it warmer than most beers, it continued to advance in flavor and aroma complexity as it warmed. Just a fantastic beer."

"All in all, I can finally say, ""At last, an oatmeal stout!"" This is exactly what the style should be, and I couldn't have been happier to taste it. Give it a whirl!"
"O- This beer is my first oatmeal stout and I liked it a lot. It has a nice complex flavor and has potential to be my next go to sipper. It is also cool to have a good stout that's an import."

"Pours a deep brown color, barely any color when I hold it up to light. Head is light tan. Stands about 1/2inch tall after the pour and settles to a thick film. As I drink there are nice rings of lacing left in my glass. Smell is of raisins, roasted malts, maybe a little vanilla. Taste is sweeter than expected. At first the raisin stood out, but as the beer warms I get more of the roasted flavor. Body is med-thick with gentle carbonation. I haven't had many oatmeal stouts, but I rather enjoy this one. I understand why it scores so well. Also, I appreciate a beer with a reasonable ABV like this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep brown with a black appearance. Extra thick mocha colored head with decent retention. Aroma emits lots of oat, bread, milk chocolate and vanilla bean. Mildly bittersweet dark chocolate, roasted malt, oatmeal and dates on the initial sip. A lot of fruity tastes follow into the body, rounding off with some notes of dark espresso, more chocolate, and dark rye bread. Lightly carbonated with a creamy, rich, bittersweet overall body. A good example of what an oatmeal stout ought to be."
""
"This is a very enjoyable beer and considering it's imported from England it's a reasonable price as well."

Med/full bodied, carbonation is perfect. Really get the caramel and roasted malts in the nose after the sip. It's a tad sweet. I enjoy it."

"O- i was pretty much very dissapointed with this brew. it was my first oatmeal stout and i was not impressed. ive heard a lot on this site about the style and was eager to try one(not a lot of variety in my area).. but you get what you pay for, and this was rather cheap. im hoping maybe it was a 'not so good' bottle or that other oatmeal stouts will taste better. there really wasnt much i liked about it other than the appearance."

"No vinegar taste, I taste good ol' roasty malt met with just the right balance of hop bitterness and the bitterness you get from charred grain."

"As with most typical British beers (like bitters) this beer lacks sweetness. If you like sweet beers you might not really like this. But it is a well balanced, easy drinking oatmeal stout. I don't really know what the oatmeal actually does with the flavour but it has made it nice and creamy. A nice beer."
"O: High in the drinkability factor, this is the best oatmeal stout I have had to date. Another great beer by Samuel Smith."
""
"I am convinced that one could survive on this beer only (without food) longer than any other beer on the market."
"the best european oatmeal stout bar none. pours rich thick hersey's syrup brown with a small tan head. aroma is espresso and burnt malt with a delicate bitter hop interruption. taste is very rich and the flavor of the oats is apparent. bittersweet chocolate rounds it out. mouthfeel is great, if just a tad undercarbonated. its smooth and drinkable and bold. a classy beer that i get excited for when i see it on a menu."

"O: very good beer, quite delicious. I really enjoy the flavors that were just the right kind of bitter and had a little sweetness to balance it out."

"Poured from a 550ml bottle into a goblet. This pours lighter than an IRS, but very dark almost black with a short lived tan head. The smells are a little light and the weakest part of this tasty brew, the smells are mostly sweet, with some molasses and oats. The feel is medium to thick but very creamy. The taste is very good, a little sweetness balanced by some bitter roasted malts and hops. Overall a tasty brew."

"Overall: One of the most drinkable beers I have had. This is the kind of beer that you find yourself wanting to take gulps of, allowing the silky and roast body to fill your mouth. At only 5% abv. this could be your shot at a sessionable stout, so long as you don't fill up and can afford it. A sort of original in the brewing world as well, so it is hard to say anything bad about it at all. A great beer, looking forward to my second bottle."

"Overall: A very VERY well balanced beer. It manages to keep it’s maltic sweetness in check against the bitterness of the hops. And at a modest 5.00% ABV it doesn’t overwhelm the drinker, that’s not to say it’s sessionable but it’s definitely light by stout standards."

"O: This is a very good beer that has a sweet but rather complex flavor profile, and a very fruity, almost wine-like taste and feel for a stout. It's delicious, and goes especially well with barbequed foods."
"I've tried SSOS numerous times,and don't get the same appeal the majority of reviewers got from the experience."
""
""
"Drink- Ah, Samuel Smith you do some great classic beers. Simple, smooth and well balanced. A very easy drinking small stout with a good blend of layered flavors. Would never turn this one down."
""

"O: As far as stouts go, this one is ridiculously smooth and drinkable. This isn't the most complex stout in the world; in fact, it's very simple and straight-forward. That, however, is far from a knock. Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout is utterly delightful in its smoothness. That little bit of creamy, chocolaty sweetness really puts it over the top for me."

"Overall I was unimpressed with this beer and I thought it was a bellow average Oatmeal Stout. What really hurt this beer was the fact that it kept that same super sweet malt profile that the other two beers had and just as it did in those beers it overpowers the flavors that define the style, in this case it overpowered the nice roasty and chocolate flavors that should be shining through. This one is a little easier to drink than the other two but it still doesn't have good drinkability, I wouldn't want more then one glass of this, the malt profile is a turn off and it doesn't hold my attention. What I liked most about this beer was the look, it looked pretty spot on for an Oatmeal Stout and it had very good head retention. What I liked least about this beer was the nasty overly sweet malt profile that all the beers in the holiday pack had, it overpowered the nice flavors that should be the highlight of this beer, it made for a pretty disappointing aroma and taste. I won't be buying this beer again or their Holiday pack, all the beers had the same bad malt profile. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who likes oatmeal stouts, it is pretty easy to find one that it much better then this beer. This beer was a let down and doesn't compare to the American Oatmeal Stouts I have tried, they are on an entirely different level. I was pretty let down with this beer and their holiday pack, after looking at the ratings I figured these would all be solid beers, but they weren't so either I hate the malt profile that they use in their beers, or I got some of last years holiday pack but with no dating I can't be sure and I hold that against them. The best thing from this holiday pack was the glass. This is the worst Oatmeal Stout I have had to date and so far I am not a fan of this brewery, I will be very reluctant to buy another beer from them, so far one of my least favorite brewerys."

"O: A easily and A. The taste is well balanced, and amazing if you like stouts you NEED to try this beer, if you don't like Stouts try it and it may just change your mind."

"Dr. It really doesn't get much better."
"Overall, an excellent stout."

"Pours a dark, clear chocolate colour with ample coffee-coloured head. Aroma is predominantly roasted malts and oats - very nice. The flavours are well balanced roasted malt tones, with underpinnings including chocolate and vanilla. The pleasantly dry finish is redolent of oatmeal. Doesn't have the creamy mouthfeel of some in this genre, but at 5% ABV it is truly a delight to drink."

"O: Terrific stout, almost like having a meal/desert, but very sessionable at the same time."

"Taste, however, is nice and smooth! I get a lightly roasted nut overtone, with some astringency. Thin-bodied, but ultimately quite drinkable. Not as coffee-like as some oatmeal stouts, but this is more than sessionable. Solid overall."

"this stout was very good but just too filling for me...very smooth and creamy but much prefer a stout that is bolder and lighter."

"Pours essentially black, with a giant head that lingers for a long time. Great lacing as your drink it down. Smell of roasted malt, some faint cherry and woody, nutty notes. Tastes of smooth, roasted malt, that finishes creamy. Slight bitterness helps balance out the sweetness of the malt. Not too dry, goes down smooth. I do notice a slight ""hard water"" type taste that is present in all the SS beers as far as I can tell, however it works great with their stouts and darker beers, but not so good with the lighter ales."

"Poured a fairly large and dense tan head that dissipated fairly quickly. The beer itself was a very dark, opaque brown, verging on black.The smell is delightful. It's a lovely mix of coffee, malts, oats and nuttiness. It's a creamy, heavy stout with just enough carbonation. It tastes fairly malty with huge notes of coffee and chocolate and a little sweet, oat background with a smooth, fairly bitter finish. Overall this is one of my favorite beers and as a result have tried several other SS brews, all of which have been great as well."

"Overall, really good. The flavors were deep and complex and played well with each other into an awesome fugue. So tasty, I'd say it was hugely drinkable as a sipping brew. Great for a cold november night, contemplating exams."
""
""
""

"This is, in my opinion, one of Samuel Smith’s best offerings. The smell is this wonderful roasted barley smell which carries over very well into its flavor as does its silky smooth feel in the mouth. The oatmeal provides a complex flavor to the malted barley and hint of hops. After a sip you might notice an almost dry bittersweet after taste. Truly a grand ale from a grand brewer."

"O: Top of the class! Really, this has me wanting to go back and mark down prior stout reviews (i.e. Guinness Foreign Extra Stout), but instead I'll give this one top marks. At the price, this won't be an everyday drink, and it shouldn't be. Something this good should be reserved for special occasions or special friends."

"Poured into an Irish pint glass. Pours a dark coffee black. The head is a flaked oats color, very tight, then dissipates to an even yet thin layer on top. Random thin lacing. The smell is awesome. It's sweet, and smells of oats and chocolate. This beer tastes sweet to start with. After that, you can detect dark chocolate, oats, and raisins. It's got a complexity about it that I admire. The mouthfeel is very, very smooth. Overall, this is a great stout. It's actually very complex in it's flavor, it is easily drinkable, and it's 5% ABV is great for a session. An excellent choice from the UK."
"(Reviewed on 10/20)"
"Bottle at Harlow’s in Peterborough. Pours black as night. Oatmeal tan head rises magnificently and gracefully exits by halfway through the glass. Notes of oatmeal, cream, chocolate, some malt, in the aroma. Mouthfeel is top notch. Silky smooth, rich, surprisingly drinkable for such a full beer. Flavor is yeasty, chocolate, oatmeal, cream, vanilla, and a bit of hearty smoked meat. Finishes very smooth, with the mildest of hop bitterness. Really a superb beer, certainly my favorite sweet stout, and the best Sam Smith."
"Overall, this is a nice oatmeal stout, sweeter than a lot of oatmeal stouts I've had. I could enjoy another one of these."
"I may have this again."
"This beer really shines after it's had a chance to breathe and warm up a bit and is one of the smoothest, most drinkable stouts I've tried."
"d) Very approachable, and good for three or four."
"O - It's sure drinkable, but it's not the stuff of legends. Really, it bridges more on what I think a Brown Ale should be than an Oatmeal Stout. I've had better beers. It definitely doesn't deserve even a spot in the shadow of Sam Smith's Russian Imperial Stouts."
"Overall: I've had this Stout many times throughout my life and it's always a pleasure. A simple, yet complex, recipe that has been around for ages. It's easily one of my favorite Stouts out there, and quite possibly my favorite overall. Samuel Smith Brewery makes some excellent beers, and this is definitely one of their best! Cheers."
"O: This is damn near a perfect beer. Very subtle flavors that are well balanced with a pleasant smell. The availability of it combined with the price and it's ease to drink pushes this to be my favorite stout I think. Very tough competition, but man this is a good beer."
"O: A solid beer, I don't love it, and I am not sure I would get it again, but it has its place."
"*Addendum 11/3/11: Drinking the other bottle I bought tonight, and pairing it with some buttery crackers and it is really bringing out a smokiness that I'd almost associate with a rauchbier. It is very pleasant to say the least!"
"Everyone should have this at least once if they're serious about beers. Certainly not the biggest stout in today's landscape but I feel like this is one of those that set the standard for a lot of what is being brewed today. It's also easy to drink, sessionable, and damned tasty."
"o: the best example of a oatmeal stout one will find."
"Revisiting this one tonight at my local watering hole. Poured a dark brown, nearly black color with a small finger of tannish foam. I had the barkeep warm this a bit before serving it to me so I'm sure that helped immensely. Aromas of oats, roasted malt, a slight of coffee (?) and some sweetness. Taste was great: roasted malt, oats (like oatmeal that I could chew), a slight bit of coffee, some chocolate, and no hop bitterness to finish. I (still) love this brew and would relish the opportunity to have it on tap."
"This is a solid oatmeal stout. The oatmeal thins the chocolate and roasted malts making this an easy drinking, any weather, dark beer."
"Smooth, dark, rich, bitter, a touch of sweetness wrapped in a ribbon of silk. Mmmmm. Great stuff."
"Mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied, with above average carbonation but is still fairly smooth. Goes down easily. Overall a good stout to start a Saturday morning. One of the better sweet stouts I've had, but still not something that blew my socks off."
"i dont taste the oatmeal and that makes me sad."
"Overall I will buy this beer again and again. LOVE IT!"
"Overall: Not much flavor or anything to make this beer stand out. It is rated fairly high on the Top 100 Beers of Fame, but this beer did not impress me at all."
"Deep, deep brown with garnet highlights. Short lasting beige head. Laces glass beautifuly. Deep malty aroma. Tastes excellent, with just the right, very slightly, bitter aftertaste.I persuaded my wife to try it; (her favored choice is Miller Lite!), and she said "" not bad for one of those heavy black witches brews you drink!"""
"This has to be one of the best out there. It's simply a delicious, creamy, fantastic brew that I can get any time."
"O - This is my go to stout, it is the perfect blend of deep flavors, aromas, and silky body. It is a truly satisfying and filling brew, especially since you can probably find this in your local store. If you enjoy this style and you haven't tried this, you are doing yourself a great injustice."
"550 ml bottle, bought in Denmark. Nearly black (= very dark brown with a reddish hue) colour, thick tan head. Moderate roasty aroma, notes of coffee and chocolate. Strong roasty flavour with coffee and bitter chocolate elements, dry roasty finish. Clearly a good beer."
"Overall - A stout with layers of complexity not present in others, very well balanced and a pleasure to drink. Overall great beer."
"O - this probably needs to be more fresh, but it's not too bad."
"D - Delicious stout, just a real pleasure to drink. Everything works well together in this brew - and I look forward to buying it again."
"While I mentioned that the smell, taste, and texture of this beer were well-balanced, I should probably comment on the color itself too. As is expected, In its simplest form, this is a very dark beer. Other than that, however, I cannot say much else."
"O: 4"
" Overall: 8/10 or 4.0 via beer advocate. Good choice my friends"
"Pint bottle into a giant snifter...pours a rich black with a decent head...I've only had this once or twice before with a dear friend who really likes it...smell is tons of oatmeal and a complex malt-backbone. Not too bitter, not too sweet...well balanced if on the less bitter side of a sessionable low-alcohol stout like this...excellent, highly recommended. A classic of the style."
"A truly great beer. An easy drinker. Smooth and palatable. I can't beleive I waited so long to try this again."
"Overall: I would have liked more roast but still very good and smooth. I will probably have another given the chance."
"Overall, this is a nice stout. Highly drinkable, while still having nice complex flavours and maintaining body and smoothness."
"O - Why the hell do I not drink this more often. I have seriously overlooked this beer. Which is weird considering I absolutely love everything else Samuel Smith puts out. This is an excellent Oatmeal Stout. Highly recommended."
"O - Love this beer. One of the firsts stouts I ever had years ago, and truly sets the bar for an oatmeal stout. Such a treat in a bottle."
"This drink does hit some nice points, but it's not all there. The coffee is all there, but I do like a bit more chocolate to my mouthfuls. As a stout it's all there, but there are other stouts that are so much more. I know that this ranks well as an oatmeal stout, but it doesn't beat out a top notch Imperial Russian Stout."
"I cannot believe I have not tried this beer sooner, someone brought a 4-pack to a beer party I hosted, I did not get around to trying it that night, but there was one bottle left and it took me a month to try this, so glad I did. Since I enjoy stouts so much I should have tried this sooner, but now I will make this a regular in my beer rotation."
"Cheers"
"O: Awesome. A beer I could drink all day, every day."
"Overall. A nice stout that I prefer over guiness. Its cheap and widely available. A good once in awhile beer."
"Overall: Great beer, but I would love to try this fresh to see how much bolder some of the flavors may be. I would definitely revisit this, especially with the colder months quickly coming up."
"Overall: A classic and a hallmark of style. This is a great introduction to darker beers and craft beer in general."
"M/O- I was expecting more due to the hype, I probably would have enjoyed this more if I had just found it, rather than it coming so highly recommended. I was a little let down, I expected it to be a little more creamy with less carbonation. Good beer none the less, and quite easy to drink, good session beer for stout fans. Oh, did I mention it was sweet?"
"O: I think I’ve said more than enough, but, to contrast I’ll sum it up as concisely as I can: sweet, mild, creamy, aromatic all while being expertly subtle in its crafting."
"O - A very enjoyable stout which I continuously pick up at the market. A good hearty drink. Maybe not the best but one that you keep coming back to.."
"Pours a shade or two off-black, some deep red notes when held to the light. A few fingers of light tan head, with solid retention and moderate lace. Nose has some roast grains, mild chocolate, coffee, light caramel and liquer-like sweetness at times I picked up. Taste is roasty and chocolatey, caramel, light metallic notes. Slightly drying and mildly bitter finish. Full and creamy feel, succeeds at coating the mouth. Great balance between the sweeter caramel notes and bitter roastiness. Great beer and the quintessential oatmeal stout."
"Overall: Samuel Smith beers really win in the flavors and the mouth feel, and this Oatmeal stout does very good in both categories. Another great beer that I will definitely put a star next to. Very good."
"O - overall a classic English stout, and basically the staple of what an Oatmeal Stout should be. Just an anytime beer for me. Easy going and lots of good English oatmeal flavor. I'd drink this any time anywhere."
"A real find - gets better each sip."
"O-Nothing special at all. I would take this over Guiness any day (given I actually finished this one), but not impressed. Low alcohol. Bland. Would not recommend this. Easy stout to drink. But not one for exceptional flavor."
"All in all this one is a classic, and I can see why it is the standard for the style. Also at just over $3.00 this beer is a steal. Another win by Samuel Smith."
"O - A beautiful, robust, sweet stout. Would be my recommendation for someone wanting to try their first stout."
"Overall - This is a very good stout. A little more full bodied and a tad more flavorful or malty and this would be spectacular. Samuel Smith definitely makes some fine beers."
"O: Best stout I've had yet. After trying the Taddy Porter and loving it, I had a good feeling about this beer."
"O: This is a good beer and one of the better oatmeal stouts out there. Very sessionable and easy to drink quite a few. Great beer."
"Oatmeal stout lovers, the search is over."
"O- An absolute classic, an old faithful for me."
"It's nice to be reminded that in a world where people only get excited about the next limited release, there is a spectacular beer like this lurking on a shelf in every store around."
"Overall- I don’t think I should have reviewed this one after drinking such an amazing beer before because this one is definitely a lot more average than I expected for “the celebrated oatmeal stout” Very much a british style stout, and very basic in both the tastes and smells unlike its north american counterpart. It is a nice stout don’t get me wrong but nothing amazing to be honest."
"O: when I thought life couldn't get any better than Guinness (20-21 years old) some one bought a bottle of this for me. I love this beer, it has so many good things going on for it I usually can't pass it up!"
"O: This definitely became one of my new favorites. An exceptional beer. Not much to dislike about this one."
"Cheers!"
"I've passed this one up many times but finally picked one up at the Round Rock HEB. I'll be sure to grab a few for my upcoming fantasy football draft to share."
"Overall: Fantastic oatmeal stout that everyone should try if given a chance. Thank you Samuel Smith's for another excellent beer!"
"O - At long last, I've found an Oatmeal Stout I like. And who better to bring this goodness unto me than one of my favorite micro breweries. It's a very bold, very enjoyable beer with a ton of character. It's finally undone the damage Saranac Oatmeal Stout did to me years ago."
"Pours a very dark brown color with a frothy light brown head that sticks around for the longest time. Chock-full of robust scents there is roasted malts, sweet carmel malts, as well as many other nutty flavors. Working my way past the frothy top, the beer is full of great, smooth, and mellow flavors. The ingredients are so well blended together its hard to pick out certain flavors but there's the obvious robust malts, oatmeal, roasted barley, and yeast as indicated on the back of the bottle. Quite a fine beer and a must drink for any beer advocate member."
"The beer pours a very dark brown to black color with a tan head. The aroma is chocolate and roasted malt. The flavor is more of the same. I get a lot of chocolate and roasted malt notes, with some lactose and oats mixed in. I also somewhat surprisingly get some cinnamon notes which go very well with the other flavors. Medium to thick mouthfeel and low carbonation. A very nice Oatmeal Stout."
"D - Pretty good oatmeal stout overall. Would definitely drink a ton any given night."
"O: Solid beer that I enjoyed drinking, did notice that all Samuel Smith's do kinda taste the same."
"O - Possibly my favorite beer."
"This beer has quite a reputation, and justifiably so. It is a very well-crafted stout that hits all the right notes. Having such high expectations, however, I was a bit underwhelmed by the flavor. This tasted to me like all the rich and powerful notes in the nose were turned down about three notches on the palate. However, this is still among the best stouts I've had, and it's certainly a beer I will return to."
"Roots"
"Overall- a really great beer. In a way, it is a simple beer, but is extremely good at what it is. You really can't go wrong with it when you want a stout."
"Overall: If every aspect of this beer was just 10% bolder, this would be an unbeatable beer for its style, in my opinion. But if you prefer the restrained English style, you probably won't find any fault here."
"Got this 550ml bottle for $3.99 - can't really beat that price, it is a beautiful beautiful thing."
"O: easy to drink despite the fully body. Overall super solid, didn’t blow my mind but, hard to find any weak points to this beer."
"Great stuff, easily in my top five oatmeal stouts. As flavorful as an imperial stout, but light bodied and low enough in alcohol to allow for several pints worth. Will be back for more."
"O - Just a really well made oatmeal stout. I expected a lot and was not disaapointed. It is well balanced and i will go back to this I am sure from time to time when it is available."
"D: A superb oatmeal stout that's a pleasure to taste and drink - just take your time and savour this bottled meal. I can't wait to enjoy it on a winter evening."
"Oatmeal Stout is simply outstanding. While none of the ingredients shine through individually, collectively whatever is in it works and works really well. As good a beer as I've ever had."
"O- A very outstanding brew. That's very easy to drink."
"O- Highly drinkable. Thick, strong in body and flavour but still very delicate on your mouth. Wonderful"
"This beer pours a dark brown to almost black with just hints of light getting through on the edges. the smell is slightly sweet and malty. the flavor kind of follows suit but it not quite as sweet tasting as it was smelling. the beer has lowe carbonation and a pretty thin body. this beer is good, but it does not hold up to other oatmeal stouts i have had like rogue portsmouth and mayflower."
"My pour created two foamy fingers of deep-tan head with great retention. It looked like the top of a root beer float. Color was a deep, dark brown with cola highlights at the edges. Nose had a roasty, chocolaty sweetness, not really dark chocolate, but more like chocolate and smoke or chocolate and charcoal. Mouthfeel was more active with carbonation than I would prefer from a beer whose brewers are calling ""silky"". Taste was rich, chocolate and a light smokiness, to me more of a dessert beer than an everyday beer. I have to agree with them about the ""bittersweet finish", but it was more sweet than bitter. I tend to think of bittersweet in terms of chocolate and this was somewhat sweeter than that, but there was also a modicum of bitterness."
"Overall - I would recommend this beer to any stout lover! I am more of a Russian Stout man myself but I am in love with this beer. I wish I could find something wrong with it, but I just can't!"
"Overall this is a fine stout and I would suggest this to anyone who fancies the style."
"This is truly a quaffable stout that one could easily enjoy any time of the year. If you want to explore the world of oatmeal stouts, you should start here - the benchmark."
"O: Awesome oatmeal stout. Very well balanced and refreshing. This is how an oatmeal stout should taste."
"Cheers!"
"D - Lots of hype for this one; I was saving this for a long time; maybe it requires more aging to develop a full body and sweeter roasted malt flavor; a bit watery if you ask me"
"O: Pretty decent Oatmeal Stout. Don't know what was up with the smell. Smelled as if it had been sitting in a pop can for a while. Other than that great beer. I'll definitely buy another bottle to retest the smell."
"I’m flabbergasted it took me this long into my beer drinking career to try Samuel Smith’s Oatmeal Stout. I understand its popularity — it’s got great flavor, it’s easy to drink, and I would smell it all night if I could. It’s now the oatmeal stout against which all others will be judged."
"Mouthfeel - first sip was very carbonated, dies off. way to thin and crisp for my preferences with oatmeal stouts."
"Overall a great stout that I'd try again and again."
"Overall a wholesome, classic English brew which I definitely will be purchasing again."
" Overall nice example of an oatmeal stout,my only complaint is that the mouthfeel is pretty thin."
"O: Excellent drinkability. One of the best British beers I've ever had"
"O- very nice beer, great body and great flavours. and could while away a cold evening sipping on these. nice."
"o: one of the best widely-distributed stouts you can buy."
"Overall, Samuel Smitsh Oatmeal Stout is a classic example of a delicious style. Smooth, creamy, and rich make this an excellent dessert beer."
"It's black earth, it's powdered bark, it's topped with raisins. The modest 5.00% we hit just holds up even higher the utter oddness of this beer. Little can one do to improve upon it, without creating entirely new beer styles. And that's exactly what we did."
"Very filling but completely satisfying."
"Pours black with a big sexy cocoa head. The nose is roasted malts, raisins, plums, oats?. Clean, clean, clean is the word of the day. Carrying through the flavor is a refinement and clean flavor - and the beer finishes very clean. The oatmeal creaminess and roasted malt flavor shines in its subtlety and combines with a slightly sweet dark fruit flavor. The body is a little thinner than desired normally, but with good carbonation. I wish there was a touch more assertiveness in the flavor - a bit more roast or chocolatiness, but more importantly, there is a slight flavor in there that I do not like. I want to say it is a touch of sweet smokiness? Don't hold me to that, but there is something in there that brings it down a notch for me. Regardless, this is a good beer."
"O: Great stout, almost porter-like in its presentation, but not quite as bitter or flat. A change-up from the Russian Imperials and a welcome dessert treat for me. No alcohol to be found anywhere, this could be a session beer no doubt. Different enough from Sam Smith's Imperial Stout so that there is room for both of them in your beer fridge. A solid ""A" for the style. Very tough to find a better example at your local beer store."
"The oatmeal stout is the finest of its kind.The appearance is dark brown,an inch of tan colored head that quickly fades away.The TASTE is smooth and malty, one of the finest in the town.I like to drink this while eating barbecue beef sandwiches.Overall I love it, I wish there were six instead of four in the pack. Not that I could all four in one night.O'well. THats life or beer for ya."
"Overall: An outstanding beer that is the standard for oatmeal stouts."
"The mouth feel is not too thick, but not at all watery. Perfect carbonation. I could session a few of these easily. One of the great beers despite all the progress made in America over the last 10-20 years."
"Prost!"
"D: Easier and easier to find (I saw this in a Duane Reade the other day), but a bit on the pricier side. I would be happy drinking several of these in the same night."
"I've always liked oatmeal stouts, but this is THE oatmeal stout IMO. I highly recommend picking this one up, it won't disappoint if you like the style. I can find no flaws with this beer."
"Overall-This beer is awesome, this is the standard I judge the few Oatmeal Stouts I've had on. Well crafty, nicely balanced. Definitely an ""A" Oatmeal Stout."
"Beautiful black liquid contrasted by a cream colored head towering about 1,5 inches. The aroma is earthy with a hint of roasted coffee and chocolate, however rather bland and weak. The taste is light but complex with a lot of grains and a hint of coffee, though I must say I felt a slightly metallic aftertaste which brings down the grade a notch.. It is smooth to the palate and makes a rather easy beer to drink, perfect session beer. Overall it is a great beer with some minor flaws, deeply recommended."
"O: I really wanted to love this beer. Unfortunately, it had the elements I don’t like about oatmeal – improper texture and taste that, at times, is pretty bland. It’s not a bad beer, but it’s definitely not in my hall of fame."
"Just amazing, full rich flavors with enough bitterness and carbonation to keep it in check. Unbelievably smooth."
"WOW. For the price, I can only say that this beer is one of the better choices on the market. I'll be enjoying this for years to come. 4.5/5"
"O - Overall, this is a nice oatmeal stout. I can see why people enjoy this so much. Still though, the random dark fruit notes I kept getting kinda killed it for me."
"I get the feeling that this is one of those quintessential stouts that may not be the best beer in the world, but one of those staples in the stout world, and I can certainly see why. This beer is more than solid; it's the embodiment of a stout."
"O - Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout got me addicted to craft beer. It looks beautiful in the glass, smells inviting, feels great on the tongue, and offers a very complex and well-balanced flavor. Worth every cent!"
"D: i remember this one being way richer in the past. maybe it is just my palate, but something seems to be lacking. still a good oatmeal stout, but i like more body on mine!"
"I haven't had this beer since college, but it's just as I remembered it - very easy to drink. When I'm in the mood for stout, I usually go for something more substantial, but this is still one delicious brew. It's very satisfying without being heavy or overwhelming."
"Overall – A good rendition of the style, though honestly I probably wouldn’t get it again. Crazy I have held on to this as long as I have."
"D-Overall this is a very drinkable beer. Love that the smell is not overpowering of oatmeal but you def. still catch that taste when you drink it. Any body that loves beer and coffee will love this beer. Great beer samuel Smiths, Well Done"
"Overall - I thought it was a pretty good beer. It was unoffensive, so it was good, but at the same time, it left me wanting a bit. But it was very solid. I think this would be a great beer to introduce to new beer drinkers to stouts and particularly, oatmeal stouts."
"Overall: I have had this beer before and would purchase it again. Very easy to drink and would buy another bottle or order it on draft if it were ever available. Sammy Smith has been around for hundreds of years ans this is a good staple from their beer selection. I am happy I bought it tonight."
"Quite complex. I enjoyed the change from other stouts (non-oatmeal), even if I struggled to identify it completely."
"O: Overall it wasn't bad, it's a very non-distinct stout which is pleasant. I wish it had better character in the scent because it really detracts from the overall appeal getting a nose full of metal when drinking. At the end of the bottle the scent got much better."
"I had this beer once a long time ago and remembered being a bit disappointed. While not as roasty as I tend to like my stouts, this is a very tasty beer that was super drinkable and had some great flavors to it. It is a must try, as well as a beer that I will most certainly revisit in the future."
"O: Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout is a classic and is definitely like tasting a little bit of history (especially considering this beer was reintroduced nearly a decade before I was born!) I personally prefer the American Oatmeal stouts (there's something about genuine English beers that are cloying to me - their unmistakable flavor profile gets old quickly to me for some reason) - maybe American beers are just a bit ""crisper"" or ""cleaner."" Whatever it may be, I'm happy to try the Oatmeal Stout By Which All Others Are Measured, and I'm sure I'll revisit it someday, but for now I think I'll stick to the American versions."
"Overall. Pretty much the benchmark for oatmeal stouts. Nothing really fancy here, just a very well-crafted beer."
"Deep brown near black colour, slight off white head, light lace spots. Smell is of roasted malt, coffee, faint alcohol and subtle chocolate notes, there is also a metallic presence that is there. Taste is of roasted malt and coffee initially, a light chocolate and mild acidity show up after that, there is also a light astringency in there. Good mouthfeel light creamy feel, medium carbonation. Drinks pretty good overall, not my favorite but quite a solid effort that is worth trying or revisiting."
"Excellent oatmeal stout and one of my favorites."
"Food Pairing:Pork any style, Mild Lamb Dishes, Yellow and other lighter flavored cakes, Mellow Chicken dishes, Cream based Sauces, Strong Pastas like Putanesca."
"So soft and smooth in the middle and finish, just amazing mouthfeel. Thick and creamy and delicious. Velvety on the tongue from the oats. Medium roast with coffee and dark chocolate dominating the middle. Black figs, and raising, unmalted barley, earthy resinous hops on the long droning finish. A bit leathery and hints of tobacco. Great beer."
"A great beer that is drinkable and delicious!"
"O- A great smelling beer that really changes flavors with the taste. I don't get the ""slimy"" aspect of oats that's often mentioned so I'm not sure if this can really be the benchmark, but still delicious and enjoyable."
"Overall - I can't find anything wrong with this beer the craftsmanship is outstanding go grab one and see for yourself."
"O: Everyone in my family likes this beer, and NO ONE else in my family likes beer. It may be the perfect stout for me."
"O - overall a very good example of the style."
"Overall I would say this beer is very nice. The taste on the beginning is a little lackluster, but not underwhelming in the least. The other aspects of the beer more than make up for it and provide a good stout I would recommend trying."
"I was expecting a much drier stout, mainly due to my lack of experience with anything but Irish stouts. This is a little sweet for a session, but enjoyable none the less."
"O - This is one of the best. The standard for Oatmeal stouts. Very drinkable. A great gateway into stouts. Solid!"
"This beer was good, first time I had it was at the Braveheart Highland Pub in Hellertown Pa. The beer is nice rich and dark. The aroma and taste reflect the look of te beer. This beer had a bit of a metallic flavor at first which faded in time. I liked the strong roasted flavors it had running through it. It was a good beer for sure. Enjoyed it even more the second time I had it."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I've enjoyed this beer quite a bit. Each sip was enjoyable and left me wanting another. I'll have this beer again in the future. My overall impression is of a well made beer that deserves the high regard in which many people hold it. It is well balanced and worth drinking."
"The coffee scent hits you when you open the bottle, like opening a bag of coffee beans. Color is completely opaque with a modest tan head. The initial flavor is a subtle maltiness, but picks up to a bitter-sweetness toward the finish. Coffee is prominent with an earthy undertone. Very enjoyable stout."
"This is a very example and a go to beer. easy to drink. I'm aging a couple, let you know in a year."
"O: A really good stout. Light enough to be easy drinking, flavourful and rich enough to merit attention. I approve of the larger bottle size; I enjoyed every drop. Definitely recommended."
"D: I think it's better on tap, Velvet Merlin has surpassed it in my opinion. I used to love this beer years ago but my palate has grown. Give it a shot but try it on tap if you can. Drink up!"
"Pours black with a light tan colored head that disappears fast. Scent is a bit grainy with faint hints of oat and chocolate. Taste is like Guinness but a WHOLE LOT BETTER! There are some flavors of chocolate, grain, oatmeal, and light hoppiness. Mouthfeel is still pretty light and although not nearly as watery as Guinness, it isn't as great as Velvet Merlin of Anderson Valley Oatmeal Stouts. Drinkability is high, as this beer is tasty and low ABV."
"D: This tastes great and is light enough to have 3 or 4."
"O - Very enjoyable. Can sip or have a few. Good beer."
"Drinkability: I like this beer, and am glad that I could probably only stomach 2 per sitting."
"$4 a 500ml, a bit pricey to get on a regular basis but will give it another go when I'm in the mood."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer. Love it, and its great that it doesn't need to have a high abv to be good."
"Very enjoyable stout."
"Very good stout one and a solid example of the style."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is full and very smooth. Carbonation is on the lower side but works out very well. A very enjoyable beer drinking experience. I could settle down for an evening with several of these on hand."
"A high-quality, highly-drinkable, highly-delicious oatmeal stout I don't have to think a lot about. It's simple and does that simplicity extremely well. This is a daily-drinking stout if there ever was one."
"This stout pours a classic near-black with no light coming through, even on the edges. Small tan head forms with a hard pour. Smells super roasty with a few sweet caramel notes. Palate features dark chocolate, roasted malts, oats and caramel. Quite tasty and works so well. Full bodied with a silky mouthfeel. This easy drinking stout is great from start to finish. Benchmark for the style."
"D - Meh. There wasn't anything special. The sweetness was a little odd and it was quite watery for a stout."
"This beer is very drinkable and satisfiying, with a full flavor that which is grand and memorable."
"D-rarely can i get a stout with so much flavor and not so much alcohol. it a really nice treat and this one disappeared quite quickly."
"An all around solid brew. Funny and somewhat sad that it has taken me this long to discover this gem. Drinks so very well all the way through. I will need to have this on a more regular basis in the future."
"These bottles are pretty big, looks like 18oz. the one gave me a little buzz, but i could see fitting in 3 or 4 of these in an evening."
"D: Superbly drinkable. Very, very tasty, I would definitely buy this again, and I think in fact, that I will."
"Poured a very dark brown almost black color with quite a bit of fluffy tan head on it. Smells like grain and alcohol. Not really a pleasant aroma. Tastes like some coffee, molasses, maybe some caramel. Medium body, a little thickness to it. The flavor in this beer isn't really my cup of tea. It's pretty drinkable, just not for me."
"Drinkability - A little too flavorful to be a session, but easy enough to finish a full bottle without feeling overloaded."
"Notes: I was really impressed with this Beer. If you have not tried this, go and find out where to get one, it's worth it."
"Samuel Smith stouts have always been great and this beer is nothing less than excellent. It is pleasurable in the mouth and does not leave a bad aftertaste. I enjoyed this beer with every sip."
"It is affordable and delicious (even to someone who does not enjoy stouts too much). It does start with a slight smell of soy sauce, but that is quickly gone. With the first taste came a sweet rich stout with a smooth chocolately finish. It is quite smooth for a stout, but not for anyone who enjoys a light see-through beer."
"This is a good beer!"
"D: Very drinkable. Very nice. thick for a 5% ABV, but nonetheless a nightcap for many I suppose."
"After a while it gets a bit sweet, but overall a solid brew."
"pours a dark brown with a mocha colored head. easy 3 finger collar of foam which hung around. initial taste was that of cocoa, roasted malts, chocolate and a nice sweetness. i love the description from the brewery that this beer was originally marketed to nursing mothers because my grandmother in law still swears that beer is what helped her babies sleep through the night when she was nursing. i really enjoyed the flavor profile of this beer and will definitely buy it again."
"D - Overall a very tasty with a touch of sweetness. Quite enjoyed the leafy hops and dark cocoa. This was the first oatmeal stout that had oatmeal flavours that lingered on the tongue. Highly recommended to any oatmeal stout fan."
"The mouthfeel is thick and very smooth, and the drinkability is quite good. It goes down easily, but I have to wait a bit before going back for more because of all the sweetness. Recommended."
"A vigorous pour produced a very dark brew, some mahogany edges and a giant, fluffy head. Smell is not strong, some roasted malts, maybe some vanilla sweetness, expected more. Taste makes up for the lack of smell. First thing I notice is that it is not a heavy stout, but a rather thin one. Molasses taste is up front, roasted malts are present, not overly bitter, some acidity may linger on the palate. Very drinkable, matter of fact, I had to force myself to slow down, but at 5%, no matter. Overall, a really nice Oatmeal Stout."
"This is a solid drink and very drinkable."
"Drinkability is solid, and this is a real inexpensive beer. Sam Smith for the win again."
"Great Stout - I recommend."
"Pours black with nice frothy light brown top. Froth fizzles away to an 1/8"" consistent head in a tall thin glazs. Dont smell much but some dark roasts and oatmeal. Tastes crisp and clean nice finish. OatmeAl and roasted barley hangz in da mouf. Sweet balanced and tasty. Mouthfeel is rich and smooth not a whole lot of bubbles. Very tazty woulx have no trouble drinking anothee one od these"
"This being my first review, I must admit that I am still developing my palate, but can definitely recognize a great beer when I drink one. The appearance was dark and tasty looking with a nice head, the smell was of dark malt, chocolate, the taste was amazing with subtle oatmeal, chocolate, roasted malt, and a nice hop balance. The mouthfeel was very impressive for a bottle, smooth, body, and not over powering. Drinkability...1 to 2 everyday for the rest of my life and I would be a happy man. Great beer!"
"This was a very nice stout, full of complex flavor, though sometimes I thought it was a little light. Surprisingly easy to drink for a stout."
"Overall a great boldly robust Stout and still one of my favorite brews..."
"D- It's not a bad beer. Good flavor and mouth appeal. Everything is great to me about this beer except when I swallow. I just get tired of that flavor it leaves behind. Unfortunately could not finish this one."
"This was a pleasant beer that I enjoyed drinking, though I doubt that I will purchase it again. I just wasn't overly fond of the mineral earth tones mixed with the malt notes."
"I'd have to say this beer is drinkable more than anything else. Not really what I'm looking for in an oatmeal stout but it is fairly tasty and would totally be sessionable. I had been wanting to try this beer for a while and was hoping to be blown away; I'm a big fan of their imperial stout and brown ale. Sadly I'm only left thinking it was all right. I'd drink it again but won't be seeking it out."
"550mL bottle. Pours a very deep, dark brown color with a big frothy tan head. Moderate amount of lacing. Aroma is earthy with some caramel and vanilla. Taste is a blend of chocolate, vanilla, caramel and coffee flavors. Not nearly as earthy as the smell would indicate. Slight tangy flavor. Rather heavy mouthfeel. Basically the benchmark by which other Oatmeal Stouts are measured, this is a great beer at a fair price."
"This beer poured a dark raisin brown with a one finger, creamy beige head. When picking up the aromas the first thing I think of is Newcastle. It's very, very malty and there are slight dark fruits, namely raisin. The flavors are very malty and sweeter than expected. There's light chocolate, light dark fruits, and light roasted malty sweetness. The flavors are just meh. The mouthfeel is perfect though. This beer is exceptionally smooth. It drinks well but for an oatmeal stout I've had quite a few that're better than this. The flavor just throws me off a bit. It's still solid, just not worthy of the rating in my opinion."
"Almost black in color with a nicely contrasted thick foamy beige head. Completely opaque. Nose of sweet malt and coffee. Thin mouthfeel for a stout, with less ""chewiness"" than others, but made up for with added flavor complexity. Malt swirls with coffee and bread grains for a hearty taste even if a bit liquidy. Carbonation is on the light side but crisp. There's definitely a place for this one in the world of stouts."
"Overall: This was quite the treat. I am a fan of Outmeal Stout, and this is one that I would certainly recommend."
"Drinkability: Certainly solid enough -- a great set of scents and pretty decent flavors to follow; body isn't as thick and smooth as I would like, but it also doesn't come across heavy at all and with the moderate ABV of 5%, I would say it would be easy enough to get through a couple of these in a night with little to no problem."
"Pours black with a hint of a deep red hue. Three-finger brown head which does a nice job lasting and sticking to the glass. Milk chocolate aroma, nice sweet smell. Very enjoyable flavor. Milk chocolate and a hint of hop bitterness to start. Roasted oats and a hint of vanilla along with more chocolate round out the beer which finishes with a lingering roasted coffee flavor long into the aftertaste. Very rich and creamy mouthfeel."
"M & D - very drinkable. No bitterness. Sweet, low carbonation."
"D - This beer is very similar in all respects to their Imperial Stout, but I think it is more drinkable because the sourness seems to have been cut by the dryness of this beer. Overall it's a more enjoyable brew that goes down easier for me. The lower alcohol content also helps the drinkablility."
"D/O- This may be the most drinkable widely available oatmeal stout. Very smooth. I'd say this is a classic beer for the style."
"D: Very easy to drink these but would prefer a more roasty stout."
"Drink - This beer had terrific balance and was extremely drinkable. Worth seeking out."
"Drinkability - Nice beer, balance makes it easy to drink. Inherent sweetness of the style limits ""session"" ability."
"Certainly, if you are not familiar with this beer you need to try it, and if you haven't had one in a while, stop and have one."
"This beerpours a black color with a creamy tan head. Smells malty; strong. A real nice rich creamy taste. Finishs very nice, doesnt have the water taste like some stouts. Easy to drink but still a full flavor. Overall a great oatmeal stout, a must try."
"D-This very quickly became one of my favorite beers of all time. Incredibly drinkable with fantastic flavor and an average abv, I could easily drink this all night. Thank you so much Mr. Smith for your fantastic Oatmeal Stout."
"Overall - fantastic oatmeal stout, actually one of the best stouts out there"
"The CPJ"
"Drinkability: This is a wonderful stout with an excellent balance of flavours and textures, entirely enjoyable and a potential new favourite of the style!"
"D - a hearty brew with a myriad of flavours, like comfort food in beer form, a great take on the style and very drinkable"
"Bottle poured into dimple glass. Pours black with a medium quickly fading head and great lacing. Aroma of roasted dark malts, chocolate, oats and the signature Sammy rusty water aroma I get from all their beers. Flavor matches aroma with the oatmeal and chocolate standing out. With a little cocoa powder for good measure. Palate is creamy, then dry and ashy. A classic and tasty stout."
"Delicious drink. Always a good idea to try an old master that has been around awhile."
"Overall an awesome oatmeal stout that if you like oatmeal stouts or stouts in general, you can't go without having this one."
"Drinkability: Damn good stuff. It is certainly worthy of celebration."
"A superb, rich brew with all the drinkabilty of a lighter beer. Sizable head leaves lots of lace after a slow fade. Could be brown but looks black to me. Aromas of toffee and roasted malts. Some butterscotch and an earthy scent. Light hop florals. Taste follows nose with a lovely dry finish that showcases the blend of malted barley and oats. A bit of chocolate blended in. Feel is silky smooth and light on the tongue. Carbonation is light and delightful. Super drinkable and just short of perfect"
"D- Delicious beer and a stout I will definately return to. Good transition beer for Guinness fans."
"Poured into a Sam Smith Pint. A nice deep brown/black with a fat head from a moderatly heavy pour. The lace is sparse but sticky. Oats and chocolate dominate the taste. Some vanilla follows with some mild but noticable earthy hops for bitterness. Not all balanced, a little on the sweet side but it doesn't bum me out. Nice and thick. Hell yeah Samuel Smith. Two thumbs up. A goddamn classic."
"This is a fantastic beer, one that I'd love to have over and over again."
"Overall this is so far the best oatmeal stout I've tried. It embodies the style so wonderfully. Great beer and a fore sure buy again.(Off to get one now before the stores close!) Great Beer Samuel Smith Old Brewery!!!!"
"D) A delicious brew. I would definitely have another one of these!"
"D: I could easily go through any number of these. This beer is the epitome of great beer, and I would not change a thing about it."
"D - Good drinkabilty due to the incredible smoothness. However this seemed like a meal in a glass. I don't think I could drink too many more pints even if I wanted to."
"Highly Drinkable Stout."
"I buy this at BevMo for 3 bucks. Its a pint bottle. Love everything about the appearance including the bottle and label. Thick dark head. A BETTER GUINNESS. Alcohol is rough on my body and drinking something of this quality keeps the creepy crawly awful hangovers from happenin. You ain't gonna get drunk too quick and its something that your body can process better than some hypercarbonated mass produced high fructose $h*t. This is the go-to dark beer my Nubian bruthaz."
"O: A fantastic oatmeal stout. The roasty bitterness is perfectly matched with moderate sweetness."
"D: High. Very easy to drink."
"D. A full body beer that is very filling, so have to drink it slowly and enjoy it. This is a must try oatmeal stout."
"D.- Extremely drinkable. Quite enjoyable!!"
"D: Not a bad quaff, however, this bottle is more than likely my last purchase of Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout."
"D- Very drinkable. Will drink again."
"This is by far my favorite Oatmeal stout I have had yet. Pours a great black with only the slightest of light highlighted brown. Body is thin not to thick wich I feel compliments this brew greatly. Aroma is of a roasty oats/malt with the slight hint of a dark chocolate background. These two aromas compliment each other greatly with providing the desired smell/taste up front with the undertone armoa/taste he;ping to stand these main charectors threw. The carbonation is good if only sometimes a slight over. Drinkability is great due to the body and alcholo level. Would recomend this brew to someone looking to step foot in to Oatmeal Stouts."
"This is a very nice beer at a low abv, I do prefer stouts to have a little more bitterness, however, this is a nice enjoyable beer."
"I still would not call myself a stout guy, but this definitely improves my opinion of the style. Much more drinkable than Guiness, I am not left w/ the cottonmouth, burn toast aftertaste that I get from it."
"D: I may be used to the aforementioned Imperial styles of stout, so this seems very drinkable. Even though I'm not a huge fan of the taste, I keep going back to this one for sip after sip."
"Overall, Samuel Smith's own a special place in my heart. When I started drinking craft, their beers were some of the first I gravitated towards. It's just fitting that this classic is my 100th review (completely by accident....not by choice)."
"Drinkability: Definitely a different tasting beer. Complex, sweet, and surprisingly low in ABV unlike most ""unique"" beers brewed today. A little pricey in my opinion, but it does have a nice presentation which makes me feel somewhat stately just for buying it."
"Drinkability: An old favorite that often gets overlooked by me for other beers. Every time I go back to it, I ask myself why do I not drink more of this? A very smooth and flavorful stout at 5% that I can drink over and over again. Time to put this back into the regular rotation again."
"Black pour with some reddish brown edges and a frothy, dense, tan head. The aroma is chocolaty rolled oats, brown sugar, a hint of coffee, and a little rum raisin bread. The flavor is creamy chocolate and oats with some brown sugar and hints of toffee, coffee, and dark fruit. The body is creamy, medium, with soft carbonation."
"D: A classic. One of the best examples of the style out there. Would love to have this on cask in the UK."
"Dark brown almost black color. Stupendous, dense head that clings to the glass like marshmallow fluff. Smells earthy, roasty, peaty and slightly sweet. The flavor and mouthfeel really shine: rich, creamy, ultra-fine carbonation, smoky, rich, chocolaty. There is a slight bitter dryness on the finish which leaves your palate and tongue clean for the next swig. Very up front flavors and very satisfying. Great stuff."
"One of my favorite locally attainable brews I can get. Pours a very dark black color. Its just a very creamy, well crafted looking beer and that also comes out in the smell. This stout is a slightly earthy, and chocolaty brew. A little cherry comes out in the finish but its not overly sweet. Not too heavy.. not too light and very drinkable."
"D: Solid oatmeal stouts. Easily drinkable, moderate ABV. A bit filling."
"D: I could drink this all day at 5%. Great brew"
"Bottle. Poured black in color with a nice foamy thick long lasting tanned head. The aroma was that of molasses, dark fruit and chocolate malts with a hint of coffee. Medium body with sweet malt, dark fruits (cherry) flavor in the beginning, followed by coffee bitterness and some chocolate. Finish is short but well balanced. Good Stout."
"D: This is the standard of oatmeal stouts. A few rough edges from what I remember in the past but altogether a very enjoyable brew!"
"Drinkability - One of those beer that u must try and is good for those cold nights. This was a fantastic choice for my 100th beer."
"Aggressive pour only produces small 1 finger light tan head...quickly dissipates with some lacing Color is dark reddish brown. Flavors of toasty, nutty goodness. Grainy and semi sweet malts well balanced with hops. Mouth is full of carbonation, making the flavors dance and pop. It is a bit thin, could be chewier, but feels very good. Overall a winner."
"Kept me feverishly wanting more after every sip, but presented or balanced in such a way that I was helpless in my desire to savor each sip. Excellent, and perhaps the Old Brewery's best offering."
"D: This is a very easily consumed stout. It isn't heavy like big stouts can be, yet is very flavorful and balanced."
"This is not a fancy Oatmeal stout but it is a damn good one and one of the best classical examples of the style."
"Good mix of flavors. Prominent flavors follow the aroma. Very smooth mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Solid overall brew that is very drinkable."
"Pour: Pitch black with fluffy cream-white head. Decent retention and smooth lacing. Smell: Bready, sourdough almost; yeasty and grainy, with a soft, sweet, sugary toffee caramel note; molasses, maybe? A bit of a metallic edge, though. Taste: Smooth, sweet-ish, medium body, but with some character. A bit watery entering the mouth before a creamy, toffee-sweet character usurps the palate. Fairly clean and very smooth; silky and buttery; and just a pinch of hops and grassiness, as well as a pinch of gassy metallic sourness, in the finish. This is pretty nice, a winning, easy drinker. Pretty mellow, but still complex. There is a bready sweetness that sticks out, and gives it an almost candy-tinged character. I am on the fence as to whether this is a positive or negative. Like their Imperial, this Samuel Smith leans a tad sweet for my liking, though not to the point of ruining anything; and like their Taddy Porter, there is a slight, weird pungency in the background, which I'm not sure how to feel about exactly. Still, there's no question this is a quality brew that makes for some good, pleasant sipping. Of the oatmeal stouts I've tried, this remains one of the best."
"Overall this is a fantastic session beer and one of the best session stouts on the market. Nothing here will knock your socks off, but it is not designed to. I have had a couple bottles in the past with a metallic flavor which were drainpours, but I'm sure they were handled poorly. Far more often then not they survive the trip to America perfectly fine. A great beer to drink with dinner!"
"Ok... maybe that last one is stretching it too far."
"Notes: My new favorite stout, picked up a 3 pack of 550 ml btls. box set for $11, came with a nice gold stamped glass, 2 coasters and a smith's guide to their respected beers. well worth the price compared to the same stores price of $4.59 for singles @ (Wegmans)I will be getting many more..."
"D - Nice drinkable beer. Something to have with a meal and then have another aftewards to enjoy the post meal coma with."
"D: I could put these down one after another. Very easy drinking. Excellent value. Would recommond to someone as a replacement for Guinness."
"Taste: Opens with a distinct bittersweet dark chocolate taste. leaves a fine and long lasting toffee aftertaste. Oatmeal taste becomes much more prominent towards the end. Finishes nicely with a hint of bitterness."
"Overall, the absolute best thing about this beer is the mouthfeel. It is silky smooth, and curiously curbs some of the admittedly robust flavors into easier drinking components. This brew exhibits the full gamut of aromas and flavors, and then some, expected of a stout, helping propel it as an exceptional beer."
"Do not miss this one! Great on a cool winter night!"
"D - If I were at a bar with this on tap I'd probably have quite the headache the next morning - this is a very pleasant beer to drink."
"D - Very smooth and well balanced."
"D - Rerally great beer and very very drinkable. This is my personal favorite oatmeal stout and I think the best interpretation ofthe style."
"Good, well rounded oatmeal stout, with an incredible aroma to boot. Highly recommended."
"Drink ability is quite decent. It does get a little heavy towards the end of the beer. It does have a good taste."
"Silky, luxurious body with a nice a creamy mouthfeel. I remembered loving this when it came available last year around the holidays, and I wasn't let down this time around. I'd recommend this to introduce newbies to the style, it packs a whole lot of flavour, is complex, and is also well-balanced so it is likely to appeal to many."
"drinkability: surprisingly easy to drink"
"This dark as coal beer poured a three finger head of light chocolate brown tight bubbles. When the head settled it left very clinging lace. The color is a 40 on the SRM beer color chart. This is the darkest beer I have ever rated. Aromas of chocolate, coffee, molasses, and some earthly smells of damp places where mushrooms and moss grow. Tastes of dark chocolate, deep roasted coffee, very dark molasses, clover, sweet malts and roasted oats. Good creamy feeling in my mouth with just a little attention getting zing. Maybe a little heavy for drinking all the time, this beer does offer great flavor and body and a great beer for special occasions."
"This is a very tasty stout. Nice roasted malt flavors with a hint of sweetness that makes this stout very enjoyable to drink."
"Drink- while its fairly easy to drink, I can never drink more than one."
"5.0 D: Even with some minor issues in the mouthfeel, this is one hell of a beer. Sam Smith is pretty much the king of UK. Just about everything I've had is tops for the country. This is exceptionally tasty given how small of a beer it is and allows you to drink plenty of it, which is why I wish I had more."
"D/M: slight carbonation tingle, nice smooth drinking brew, leaves a nice smoothness on the tongue, deep brew that drinks like you would expect it to"
"Delicious, a ""go to"" for me if there is one. hands down a great beer to introduce a non-geek into beer, as this one will get someone off the Guinness bandwagon in a heart beat."
"Cheers, SS!"
"D - This is top draw Oatmeal stout and I doubt you will find any better."
"Drinkability - Wow!!! That's about all I can say. Truly an extraordinary Stout. I really don't see how Sam Smith's makes such well rounded beers. The only reason I didn't score this as a perfect brew is because if I find a Stout that is better, I want to leave myself some wiggle room. Other than that. It's the best Stout I have had thus far on my short journey."
"D: super drinkable. Just a really enjoyable beer. The mouthfeel and just smoothness are something special."
"As I stated a few times above, this brew is a fantastic representation of the style. Its a great creamy beer, that is just smooth and comes together and has a nice finish. The look on this brew is a bit scary at first, but the drink is actually pretty easy and I certianly could do a few of these in a session with the lower ABV and the fact that its that smooth. Great brew."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, particularly as a desert beer."
"Very drinkable; almost ""dry", a little sweet; good in combination with any food. Just not as ""memorable"" as some other microbrews or a good doppelbock."
"Super drinkable. It was really nice to find a beer under 6% that tastes as good as this one does. Went down really smooth, my 4-pack is going to be gone in no time."
"D - Drinkability is amazing as well. The adjective I can best describe this beer is 'creamy' and 'velvety smooth'. Everything about it comes together quite well and as I finish this review I am almost done with all 18.7oz. Scary drinkable, but thankfully the low ABV keeps you standing."
"D - Well I can't seem to find this any cheaper than 3 dollars a bottle so it would be enjoyed on occasion but it was a pretty sweet oatmeal stout. Drinkable and full of flavor"
"D-Very good I could put a few of these away in a session. SS rocks another great beer!!!"
"The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy with a slight hint of spicyness/carbonation and a nice hop offset. Mild, but complex and wonderful flavor. This beer is highly drinkable :) Cheers!"
"Then the not so good. The aftertaste when the drink is done is horribly, nastily bitter and it lasts and lasts and lasts. I eventually had to use mouthwash to strip the bitterness from my tongue. Even that was only partly successful. I suppose that would be a reason to keep on drinking them but I can't say I'll seek it out again unless I know I'm going to be having something really searing afterward. Damned shame, too - otherwise this was a definite keeper."
"Taking a sip, not too bitter. Good sweetness from the oats balancing the roastiness in the malt and chocolate flavors. Very creamy mouth feel, full bodied beer from oats combined with the perfect amount of carbonation to make the beer seem like it was on nitro. Easy to drink and a nice standby to have for times where I would like a regular stout."
"If they increased the weight though the beer wouldn't be nearly as drinkable as it is. At only 5% ABV, this is relatively light and highly consumable stout. A classic."
"Poured from a 550 mL bottle, a nice dark brown color as it pours , hold it against light and it is absolutely pitch black. Mild smell of oats as the bottle cracked open, tan head with very good retention. Oats, a hint of coffee and chocolate somewhere in the back make this stout downright delicious. Smooth as silk, each sip leaves you wanting more, every sip is a revelation. It is the most well balanced oatmeal stout, period. Drinkability is exceptional, I can never get enough of the Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout. Hands down the best oatmeal stout on the face of the earth."
"D-exceptionally high, this is classic"
"D - A tasty and unique stout, this is definitely a keeper and something I could drink daily. Highly recommended."
"D= Decent beer I expected a little more from this one bet over all pretty decent. I wouldn't want more than one of these in one sitting though."
"D - I could drink this all night, but there are a few that I would reach past this to grab."
"Best oatmeal stout on the planet, period."
"Drinkability: Great example of the style: Complex, intriguing, great balance. Excellent on a purely technical level. On a personal level, though, i would have a liked a bit more restrained roastiness."
"Overall, one of the best examples of the style against which all others are measured."
"Now the taste of this beer surprises with a perfect balance and smoothness of barley and hops.The oatmeal is certainly recognizable and adds to the smoothness of the beer. Sweet aromas like caramel chocolate , and I swear I taste some apple, dominate in the beginning, until the bitterness of the hops balances the sweetness into a bittersweet beautiful aftertaste, which is just asking for more beer. It is very drinkable and I must say that this beer is one of the best beers I have tasted. Great job!"
"I tasted this from a 550ml bottle. I found it a great dark beer with excellent full head. Rich coffee and malt aroma. Excellent flavour. Taste is chocolate, slightly nutty with nice smooth mouthfeel from the oats.This is an easy drinking, delicious beer. Worth a second bottle!"
"Drinkability: I was drinking 4 a week for several months."
"Pours pitch black with thick tan head and some lacing down the glass. Smells of coffee, roasted malt, oatmeal and caramel. Lots of roasted bitterness in the flavour, but still quite sweet. This is delicious. Very smooth mouthfeel. I bought this as part of a 3 bottle pack with glass from the LCBO in Ontario. I wish this was available year round and I could buy it in singles."
"The taste is excellent. The oatmeal taste isn't very predominant, and instead, I taste a lot of the dark fruit and roasted malt, somewhat reminiscent of a Belgian quad. There is very little bitterness, though it still is pretty well balanced and isn't overly sweet. Its very smooth and velvety, very nice. I think it could have gone with a higher abv (maybe around 7-8%?), but overall very nice."
"A very nice ale, but it does miss the stout category, as the typical roasted malts were very much in the background. If one added some Fuggles and dry hopped Goldings this would make an outstanding Porter. In any event, this is one of finest Dark English Ales one can find no matter what one calls it."
"This really is a classic. It's rich, a little sweet, a little roasty, and it goes down easy. No wonder everyone loves this beer."
"Pours a solid black with a nice three-finger tan head. Low level of carbonation and creamy medium mouthfeel. Has a definite malty aroma, smell and taste is sweetish fruit, chocolate. Oat flavor is also noticeable and adds a nice dimension to the taste. This is surprisingly refreshing and for a stout I find it less bitter than expected. Would be highly drinkable, has a lower ABV than most stouts at 5%. A bit ""tamer"" than I expected, but still a damn delicious stout, looks pretty too. I would love to try this on tap in England someday. Price for me is around $10 for a four-pack, so not really expensive but still much more than other choices, so it's a special treat."
"D: Not bad, but not great, either. The Taddy Porter is a much better beer."
"Decent price, semi cheap for a three dollar pint bottle."
"i would drink this again,its sweet,very flavorful,and smells really sweet."
"I can do two bottle of this at a time but you just get to full from it to do any more. I think of it more as a meal in a glass than a drink"
"d - Overall a very good, very drinkable oatmeal stout. Was glad to have it and enjoyed the roasted notes and chocolate in the smell and taste. The mouthfeel and the low ABV makes this one you can drink a lot of. Would definitely have again."
"A great oatmeal stout."
"D: Damn smooth and tasty. So much flavor for being 5%. One of the best oatmeal stouts."
"O: Not as heavy as one would expect. It goes down smooth and easy. I could knock back two or three of these 550ml bottles in an hour if I wanted to, but it'd be a bit of a stretch."
"This beer pours out the same as any other stout, nice dark opaque color, with a wonderful light brown head. Head is about two fingers and is very present through the whole beer. Aroma is that of caramel, dark malts, toasty and some bread. Very roasted sent coming off this beer. Taste is very nice, lots of malts, some toffee and even coffee. Very nice flavors in the mouth, with a very nice finish. Very sweet throughout and pleasant. Towards the end getting some more bread and earthy flavors. For sure a beer you want to try as this has the makings of one of the best stouts! Definitely one of the best I have had yet."
"D- Hell yes. Drink in abundance."
"D - A bit on the heavier side, but not as heavy as it could be. Great with spicy Thai food."
"Pours a medium black brown color that has a slight visibility to it. Leaves a big 3 finger fluffy tan head that leaves some lacing but recedes very slow. Nice look. The aroma is very roasty and has a nice oat flake component that mellows it out. Nice malted chocolate and steamed milk come up too. The flavor has a nice roastiness to it and goes down super smooth. Very nice creamy mouthfeel and the carbonation recedes to leave a nice silky finish. Really can't believe I have passed this up sommany times. Really great stout and a new staple."
"I just can't imagine a tastier Oatmeal Stout. Appearance and smell is good but not outstanding in comparison to other oatmeal stouts. Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout has a great mouthfeel from the oats, rich chocolate and mocha from the roasted malts and just enough hop bitterness to balance the caramel sweetness. It is also a really good value when you consider a 550 ml bottle retails for about $3 here on the East Coast."
"drinkability; love this stuff and could drink all night based on the wonderful taste alone."
"Nice, flavouful stout. Maybe too sweet for some."
"D. I'm sold on this style. Extremely drinkable. However not a session beer because of the fulness that comes along with dirnking this style. Great sipping beer which i Have paired with pizza."
"The aroma is very pleasing. The standard roastiness and chocalte notes, but very nice. The color has a dark brown/black tinge, but for a stout it was somewhat opaque;light could be seen through the beer. the taste is sweet, full bodied, roasty and malty. The mouthfeel is on the thick side. The palate is a tad bitter, probably from the bitersweet chocolate. This gives the beer a nice balance. Definitely enjoyable."
"Poured this into a tulip. The body is very dark brown with a light tan head that leaves sticky lacing and is very bubbly. The nose is full of sweet dark malts, it's really sweet up front and reminiscent of brown sugar or molasses; pretty much something to that nature that I really can't place my finger on. It's not the most complex aroma, but it's very pleasing and well done. The taste is sweet through and through. It's not bad but the flavor seems a bit bland. I can detect the dark sweet malts and a slight flavor of oak. It finishes with a bit of a coffee taste. Like I said, it seems bland, maybe subtle is a better word, but this is really an enjoyable drink. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, honestly what I would want from an oatmeal stout. This is a great readily available beer, and at five percent, real easy to enjoy over a period of time."
"D - Very drinkable, the best of the oatmeal stout's I have tried."
"Poured a nice dark brown brew on my pint glass along with a brown creamy full crown. The oatmeal dominates the aromas, with some hops and barley touches too. Very little carbonation with full body. Smooth oatmeal taste that starts you up followed by the roasted malts and barley ending in a dryish hoppy aftertaste. Nice drinkabilty."
"D: This is a very easy to drink beer. The tastes are good, it is smooth, and as a low ABV. Not incredibly interesting, but enough so that I could drink a lot of this in one night."
"I'm bored. I've had better oatmeal stouts. I've had better porters. I could use some hops or just a bit more bitter in anyway. It's too sweet. It isn't overly strong. This is really that well thought of? I had an Edmund Fitzgerald tonight on draft...5.5% alcohol and 10x more flavor and complexity than this beer could ever hope for. Again just don't get it. That said no alcohol impact here. It's a touch too thick to really drink much of and I'm not sure that I'd call this a sipper."
"D- A great all around stout, sadly it's not available where I live, and where it is available, the price is slightly steep, but you get quality for what you pay. Do not pass this one up."
"Not bad, but not what i remember from past tastings."
"overall, i wouldnt drink this everyday, but if the mood struck, i'd buy again"
"Very very good. At 5% ABV, you can knock down a couple of pints of this flavorful dark ale."
"Highly drinkable, I;d forgotten how easy drinking and tasty this brew is."
"smooth, medium plus-bodied mouthfeel with middling carbonation. high marks for drinkability, as i would have no problem sessioning this."
"M - smooth, full bodied, significant carbonation."
"D-This is a very drinkable stout. Even sessionable at 5%ABV. Well done."
"Serving type: 12oz bottle"
"As for drinkability: it's only 5% and a bomber or two wouldn't necessarily knock you down. It'll fill your stomach and satisfy with both flavor and feel in a large way before overwhelming with any alcohol sensation. A truly sessionable beer. Or a prelude to harder stuff..."
"O- I havent yet had a Samuel Smith beer that i did not like."
"low abv smaller thinner beer, with a large tannish cap. Smells of milk, light roast and smoke, and creamy oats. Flavors follow the nose but the roasted notes seem more pronounced here. the term baby breakfast stout just popped into my head. Thankfully the oats have done nice job on creating a smooth creamy mouthfeel, giving this one what i look for in a drinkable stout."
"Cheers..."
"Delicious, delicious beer that's a pleasure to relax with. Wonderful winter warmer that I'll continue to enjoy."
"This is one of the best oatmeal stouts out there. Creamy, very complex and surprisingly flavorful for a 5% ABV beer. This is one of the beers that got me into craft beer and it's just as good as I remember it."
"a classic brew that I'm a little surprised I've never reviewed before. everyone should try this beer at some point if they get the chance"
"Love this beer. Poured into a Crown Royal glass. Pours a dark, rich brown. Big latte colored head. Oates in the nose along with some malt. Yum. This is one smooth stout. Roasted barley comes through up front. The oats mellow out the slightest hint of bitterness from the hops hanging out on the back of the tongue. One of my favorite stouts."
"Drinkability - while the nose disappoints the beer tastes great, good taste profile, decent texture, rich and flavorful"
"Pours a 2"" tan head and looks a standard coffee brown in the glass. Flavor itself was pretty mild but what is cool with this beer is it has the flavor and feel of drinking a mild mocha malt. I found it thoroughly satisfying like a kid at a malt shop slowly draining his glass. Plus it was reasonably priced so you know I'm going to be repeating this one."
"This old stalwart sure looked and smelled tasty. Lightish dark chocolate and creaminess on the tongue but it seems to lack the complexity and dimension I remember . Rather four square really. Certainly competitive but not exactly 'Jurassic Park'. Will this ever be offered on cask?"
"Easy drinker, strong flavor without the heavy body. This is like a 5% ABV version of Bitches Brew. Fantastic, these oatmeal stouts are quite lovely."
"d - quite drinkable, the flavors are smooth and well-integrated, flavors also have some depth, easy on the palate"
"Pours a dark black with a tall head that died quickly in my case. Lacing's pretty nice looking, though. It smells faintly like a barn with morning dew surrounding it. It's a bit sweet but not overbearingly so, with a notable absence of the coffee/chocolate flavors I'm used to in stouts. Nice change up, there. The mouthfeel is a bit thin for whatever reason, but not bad, and it's pretty drinkable. Good beer."
"O - While it's one of the beers that got me into ""better"" beer, I guess my palate has moved on. I still like it, and for the price it's definitely solid, but there are so many more interesting beers on the shelf around it."
"D- a great big beer to session"
"D: A very nice oatmeal stout. Not my favorite, but this is the classic representation of the style and one I wouldn't turn down."
"I love this brew."
"(D)- A solid to excellent example of the style. Smooth and creamy to boot, with just the right amount of a roasted background. Good stuff."
"D: Tasty and very enjoyable.. but then again, I'm left wanting a little more from it. Maybe a slightly chewier mouthfeel or some more complexity in the nose. Still another great brew from Samuel Smith"
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Super smooth and creamy. It's full bodied but I feel like I could drink a ton of it. This is one of the best beers that I've tried so far."
"Drinkability - This is a wonderful oatmeal stout with a delicate balance of flavors. One of my favorite breweries and one of my favorite brews."
"Smooth, tasty and filling. A favorite stout."
"The brew has a hearty taste of deep, sweet and dark bread. I detect a slight semisweet hint of chocolate and coffee. Feels a bit oily up front but leaves the palate dry yearning for another sip!"
"D- Could drink this all night. Good taste followed by an excellent mouthfeel make this easy going down. Such a good brew though you want to savor it slowly. The abv is low enough to have multiple of these. A spoiled session beer if you make it one!"
"D-this is a well balanced stout with soft creamy flavors and a body to match. great beer, great flavors, well done stout!"
"Poured the bottle into pilsener glass. Opaque black with tan one-finger head... Ruby highlights at the narrowest point of the pilsener. Smell is dark roast malty on a fruity alcoholic backdrop. Sweetness of malt has a chocolate tinge and sugary molasses dominance; bready notes, faint hop bitterness; thick and heavy mouthfeel common for the style; carbonation is complimentary.. Fantastic oatmeal stout, but, for me: enjoy one and I'm done."
"Drinkability: An excellent sessionable brew. I love the chewiness of this beer. The flavors are complex and jump out. It tastes almost like a sweet stout, but the grains let you know this is an oatmeal stout. A great beer."
"Mouthfeel is light and creamy. It's got a nice roasty bitterness to it. Light chocolate finish that's a bit bitter. Very solid example of the style."
"I think it would be even better fresh. Difficult to achieve over here in the states."
"Bottle. Black pour with good looking tan-white ring of foam. There is a little weird fermented/moldy aroma. When you go beyond it, you get molasses, intense toffee-caramel and sweet chocolate. Taste is well developped; chocolate, oats, burnt toast and of course molasses. Palate is creamy and smooth. Reminds me of Fuller's London Porter. Drinks very well."
"Pours a dark coffee color like any stout. Head was thick and healthy, bubbly and foamy, and a dirty tan color. Aroma was slightly weak but strong enough to pick up some roasted coffee smells as well as a hint of creamy sweetness. Taste was a mix of roast coffee and oatmeal w/ milk. Slight bitterness to it as well. Great body, not too thick or thin. Very drinkable, but the bottle is a bit big to have in one sitting."
"D-Very very drinkable especially because of the low alcohol percentage."
"Drinkability - This is a amazing beer. It has everything. Its sweet then sour, then stout, then mild. Its a all in one beer that is a pleasure to drink. I usually pick up a 4 pack monthly. I cant go many days without enjoying one of these. Ive yet to drink a better oatmeal stout!"
"Wonderful beer. Looks good. Not bad at all. Smells like oatmeal and of course it taste like oatmeal. Mouthful well it isn't the best but close to it. Drinkability is wonderful. I could drink a few of these and and enjoy its wonderful taste over and over again. I would recommend this beer to anyone."
"This is tasty, and abover average in all aspects, however I'm just not super impressed. I'd probably have again but can't strongly recommend it."
"Solid stout, not quite one of the best but good. Bloody 'ell!"
"This is an excellent stout with broad appeal."
"The mouthfeel is thick and creamy and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is very good for me. I love the oat flavors and what it adds to the mouthfeel. Excellent beer overall and pretty much a benchmark for the style for me personally."
"Overall it really does not get better then this, the hallmark people should strive for."
"D- This is a very drinkable stout! It's a wonderful example of the style and the enhanced bitterness really drives home the roasty character of the beer. The alcohol is of course well hidden, as it should be, is rich and creamy smooth. Anyone who likes a good English style stout will love this beer!"
"I don't have a lot to add to this that hasn't already been said. In all, it's a good beer, but I was underwhelmed. I had the Taddy porter as my first beer from Sam Smith, and was hoping the Oatmeal Stout would be as impressive, but it isn't, sadly. A good beer, but not one I'll be likely to buy again."
"Pours a very dark brown, looks black at first sight, but when tilted it shows its true colors, with ruby-red highlights. The head is a light brown color, which stays around for the whole of the drink, and leaves some nice lacing. Not over the top, an understated, subtle, coffee and mocha smell, with a bit of chocolate and cola. Definitely a sweet stout, lots of residual sugar, a nice milk chocolate main flavor, with a hint of coffee, some cherry notes as well."
"D- A fabulous stout, for sure. The fact that it is relatively light for a stout,and has decent carbonation make this one a good session beer in my eyes. Years ago my cousin(also a Beer Advocate)bought me one of these on Thanksgiving. It turned me into a person who ""dug"" good beer. First taste of stout. Haven't had it in a while, and this is the first time I've drunk it and really thought about the flavor profiles in it with the intention of a review. Forgot how damn good this beer is."
"This is a good beer to try, it has the perfect combination of ingredients. A must try!"
"This beer is very very delicious. I recommend it to any beer lover."
"To drinkability - quite a bit similar to the IS, but I liked this one just a wee bit better. Would go well with a salty meat."
"Drinkability: The subtle alcohol reminder mixed with an excellently sweet, coffee flavor makes this beer very hard to set down. Smooth, warming, and great tasting."
"D: a solid example of the style."
"Drinkability is nice with a great mouthfeel and a nice flavor package."
"D- I can drink this all day. A great flavorful taste of coffee, smoked malt and some sweetness as well. Very good"
"I didn't remember this beer as being as full flavored as it is. However, it's spot on for style and drinks very well. This is a stout among stouts."
"D - Overall, if you need a excellent stout and want to get something you know will be good, this is that beer."
"D. My favorite oatmeal stout in the world. Very drinkable."
" Pours solid black with about an inch of tan head that dissipates slowly, leaving thick, fluffy lacing. The nose is lovely. Roasted malts, walnuts, toasted whole wheat bread and oats. Mouthfeel is thinner than you might expect, but very nice. Deep flavors of roasted malt and oats. Light caramel sweetness, and a touch of bitterness make the lingering finish a thing of beauty."
"D:It will go down smooth and is surprisingly not as heavy as it looks. It is appropriate in the winter as it is in the summer. Drink with steak and soups."
"This is one amazing oatmeal stout. If you haven't tried this, give it a shot. I could settle in with this any time...amazing brew."
"Final Notes: A delicious dessert stout that is well-rounded and not overly alcoholic. I'll be drinking this again, for sure. Recommended."
"Drinkability- 3 out of 5. This stuff is good, but I wouldn't want more than the bottle (which gives about 2 glasses once poured)."
"A typical stout from the British Isles, not very heavy and light on the alcohol. Classic! Very drinkable and one of the best stouts from the UK...well, until you get to the ones from Brew Dog which will make your toes curl."
"Sweet and malty, this stout is on the sweet side, with very little roasted bitterness or coffee flavors. The beer has a nicely thick body to it, but not so much syrupy as it is grainy. Drinkability is excellent."
"I really enjoy this beer but have to be in the mood. It's a tad sweet for me at times. There's a lot of complexity though, and it's different for me every time. Great beer."
"at close range with a 12 gauge shotgun... this beer hit taddy porter right in the face and nocked it off my list of top 5... because this just raised the bar on a good beer... it sits up there with the 3 chimays and lion stout damn good beer..."
"Dark, ebony with amber highlights and a thick oatmeal colored head that leaves scrappy lace on the glass. Rich molasses and cocoa with a touch of raisiny oatmeal. Dark fruit, dark but sweet chocolate and cocoa flavors with a touch of vanilla. Full bodied and creamy, silky smooth from the oats. A textbook example of the style. Delicious."
"I reckon this is probably the epitome of an oatmeal stout. I think I'll pour my last bottle into some oatmeal sometime."
"An awesome beer. Not too heavy, not too light, perfect!"
"I usually drink this beer alone or with hearty foods, but I have been experimenting with paring beer and dessert. For this review I decided to pair this beer with Camembert. I wrapped Camembert with puff pastry and blackberry compote and baked it until crispy the drizzled a balsamic/strawberry reduction over it. These rich fruity flavors complimented the beer nicely and brought out a new level sweetness and roundness to this brew and I am very happy with the outcome. I hope others will try this pairing. It really shines the beer in a new light."
"The mouthfeel is nice and smooth, not too thick. It drinks very well, not too heavy at all."
"Cheers!!"
"Full bodied with a rich, creamy mouthfeel. Overall this is an awesomely balanced stout. Hits the perfect spot between the chocolate-y sweetness and coffee/hop bitterness, along with the fantastic chewy body from the oats."
" ~ I can't believe it took me so long to try this great beer. This is going to be a regular from here on out. If you haven't had a chance to drink one of these fine beers, do youself a favor and indulge."
"Nice mild roasty aroma with coffee, chocolate, and a hint of caramel. Low to moderate carbonation with a light and slightly thin mouthfeel. The flavor begins with breakfast, featuring coffee and oat malts. This is followed by a full chocolate sweetness and then a return to slightly bitter, earthy malts on the finish. Nicely balanced and easy drinking."
"Overall, it was great, with a good balance between big stout taste with the bite of astringency imparted by the oats."
"D - Pretty solid. Very easy going down and this could be a decent session beer."
"Drinkability - I love it!!! This would make an amazing float with a nice big scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. I do not think anything i have ever drank is worthy of a 5.0 but this is the closest i have had yet."
"Pours a really dark ruby brown with a big pillowy tan head with pretty good retention. Lots of roasty chocolate on the nose along with raisin, molasses, and vanilla extract. Cocoa and vanilla extract are the dominant flavors. There's a smoothness and taste that is reminiscent to an oak aged stout. This is a killer beer and silky smooth going down...very impressed by this one."
"I poured into a pint glass to two inches of tan head. It is dark brown with ruby highlights. The aroma is dark cocoa and coffee. The taste is dark chocolate and finishes with some rich coffee. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. This is another great beer from Sam Smith's. I've had three of their beers so far, and they have all been winners."
"Is to drink in peaceful place, out of noise and distracters, take with old cheese and black olive."
"Impressions: Excellent. Lovers of stouts or any dark beers need not hesitate in buying some of this."
"D- I can drink one and move on. Would visit again in the future."
"D- i can take 3 of this one with no problem, a amazing brew"
"Taste of malts and molasses, coffee, sweet, full bodied but also smooth. Sweetness is followed by a dry finish and that is a nice combination."
"Pours a dark brown color with a cap of brown, creamy head. Scent is mild - roasted and charred malts, hints of earthy, smoke, grain. Taste is a little more aggressive with the same roasted grain, hints of charm, smoke, earth, chocolate, nuts. Nice smooth and mildly creamy body, touch of dryness on the finnish. A nice, classic beer done right, would welcome one at any time."
"Value: ?"
"Overall, it's a good beer but not for me, I much prefer something dryer."
"This is a wonderful and highly drinkable beer and worth every penny you pay for it."
"Overall a really tasty, easy drinking stout. Very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: There's a robust mouth coating that leaves one wanting for another sip, and I'm seeing the glass disappear pretty quickly. Therefore, I can't deny its drinkability, but it's probably not my new session beer."
"Another S.S. classic."
"Overall: A true benchmark classic, and no doubt one of the best (or the best) oatmeal stouts in the world. My hat is off to Samuel Smith's..."
"Overall: Not terribly thick, but very heavy. Good to great stout!"
"Drinkability and Mouthfeel: Good weighted stout, drinkable and filling. Good crisp carbonation."
"Drinkability - Easy drinking with good flavors, in particular for a beer with only 5% abv."
"Drinkability: highly drinkable. Fantastic flavor and not so heavy that you can't have a few."
"D: This beer is very drinkable and would be an easy one to put down a few of when the temperature is cold."
"M/D - Rich, creamy, and chewy mouth feel; and a very delicious beer. Definately a favorite of mine."
"This stout was light and sweet. The low abv is a plus as well. Looking forward to re-visiting this beer again in the future."
"As a whole, while not my ideal stout body-wise, Sam Smith's is flavorful, yet easy drinking option that's nice to have around."
"d- this was one killer beer that i will definately be buying again. i had my eightynine year old grandmother (and beer loather) try some and she enjoyed it! the drinkability here is awesome, so smooth, refreshing, and satisfying all at once."
"D: great!"
"D - An awesome stout. Chocolatey roasted coffee flavors are creamy with the oatmeal giving a silky goodness. The premier example of this style. I could drink 1 or 7 of these anytime of the year."
"D- Oh HELL YEAH. If Sam Smith beers weren't so expensive by the case, I'd bring this to every party I go to. Its the perfect oatmeal stout."
"The beer poured a jet black color with a three finger head. The head was light brown in color and lasted for most of the beer. The initial smell of the beer was that of oats, malt and a hint of coffee. The initial flavor of the beer is that of malts and oats, eventually finishing with a metallic like taste and a hint of coffee. This could be tied to the relative sweetness of the beer. The beer has a very smooth feel to it, as well as being that of a light to medium body. This is a very nice beer that seems to feel rather light, I'll definitely pick it up again."
"Drinkability is so-so. It's a bit sweet and chewy for a beer that isn't really high octane or anything. I guess it's a bit short on the attentuation for me."
"D - This is a very easy to drink stout. There is a certain tasty thickness to it but that doesn't deter from the fact that it is extremely quaffable. There is little bitterness to this beer and it makes itself known as more of a bittersweet chocolate flavor."
"To cap off a big weekend of beer drinking with the boys, I cracked open one of these on Monday night as I relaxed on my couch with some cookies. Poured into a British style pint glass. Huge head. Dark brown opaque color. Smell was great, just like chocolate. Taste was exceptional. Roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, and oatmeal flavors all mingle on the palate. So silky right out of the bottle. A perfect mouthfeel, with just enough body, but smooth enough to drink easily. A classic example of the style from an equally classic UK brewery."
"Beer is medium bodied and has a great flavor to it. I can't taste the oatmeal as much as some other beers but it gives it good body. Nice roast in the back. There is nice connectivity in the palate but not a lot of carbonation in the mouth. It doesn't really need it. Drinkability is high. I like this beer and highly recommend to everyone interested in stouts."
"Overall, Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout is a deliciously well balanced stout with a pleaseant texture and high drinkability."
"Overall this is a very drinkable beer and a good one for my first oatmeal stout. At only 5% ABV and packing a good amount of flavor, you can definitely enjoy the whole 1 pint, 2.7 fl oz bottle in one sitting without regretting it later. Pretty good stuff from Sammy Smith's."
"This (outside of imperials such as Southern Tier's Oat) should be your first stop if you're looking for an oatmeal stout. If you don't like this - you're probably not going to like oatmeal stouts in general."
"Heavy pour yielded ~1"" of foam that threatened to overflow the glass (and would have if not for some slurping intervention). Dense tan foam has an odd orange hue to it and leaves tons of lace. Nose is bitter molassas, dark malt, liccorice. Taste is smoke, wood, toffee, smoke and a bit of orange rind in the finish. Smell and taste are both a bit subdued, not as robust as I hoped. Mouthfeel is a little thin. Despite the aforementioned shortcomings, I do find it enjoyable and will have it again."
"A very good stout, I will purchase again."
"NOTE: May be better enjoyed warm(er) than 50-60 degrees F."
"D- A very easy drinking Oatmeal Stout that I will revisit often."
"Poured this into a Sam Smith's nonic, and this beer came with the gift set. The appearance is a black coffee colour with an off-white head and the smell is of coffee and prunes. The taste is, you guessed it, OATS galore. Mouthfeel is medium and a bit dry. Overall, a superb drink,"
"Drinkability - It goes down very smoothly and doesn't get boring and not overwhelming. This is one of the best stouts out there, and nothing is really compromised in this beer. You get enough of everything, except the beer itself."
"D - It goes down very smoothly and doesn't get boring not overwhelming. This is one of the best stouts out there, and nothing is really compromised in this beer. You get enough of everything."
"D: Damn good oatmeal stout. Extremely enjoyable and drinkable."
"Notes: Very nice beer that isn't as bitter as some other stouts but it has a good stout taste. Full oat taste, with a little roasted flavors, but not a lot of roasted taste. Good for a session or for a slightly special occasion."
"Pours a near black dark brown with a frothy creamy head. Smell is very muted - hard to get much from it aside from some roasted malt. The taste is much more pronounced than the nose with strong malt, cocoa, oats and a bit of coffee. Medium body with a little much carbonation. Drinkability is decent."
"D: Definitely drinkable, wouldn't mind drinking another one. A very solid oatmeal stout."
"Pours a nice, dark brown with a fairly-nice tannish head with some lacing. The smell is lots of malty bread with a bit of a roasted character. Taste adds a little bit of chocolate to the mix. The mouthfeel is very, very nice with a beautiful smoothness from the oats. Very drinkable. A beautiful cold weather session brew."
"the pour on this baby was wonderful...nice cascade, could have a huge head if not careful. head died in a few minutes, but it was a full, fluffy dollop of wonderfullness. excellent smell, mouthfeel of mild carbonation- but very smooth. nicely malty, tasting the coffee immediately. this almost reminds me of a coffee porter like a kona brewery pipeline, but much better. i really liked this light feeling stout. was kinda weird because as i drank it i said ""this is pretty light for a stout", but it is 5% so that can explain the lightness, but as i drank it i did get pretty full pretty quick. the only thing i didn't like was the gold wrapper securing the top to the neck, b/c it did prolong my opening of this fantastic stout."
"Drinkability is superb."
"D - This is the beer drinkers beer; if you like the darker side of the beer world, then this has to be in your bank of beers."
"M/D - Had a lighter body than I would have imagined for a stout but it was still well carbonated so that it was smooth and creamy on the palate. Finishes a little on the sweet side since there's not much trace of hops and very clean after you swallow. Extremely drinkable."
"Wow, very complex and quite tasty. Sort-a fruity up front transitions smoothly into slight smoke then light coffee. It is really good. I have had this beer before about 2 years ago and didn't like it, well this is a testament to my palette growing over time. THIS IS MIGHTY TASTY. You should be able to pick this beer up at your local store and I highly recommend it. GREAT BEER! It is clean, crisp, and very flavorful."
"D: Extremely drinkable. I've been overlooking beers like these since I got seriously into craft in late 2008. It's nice to revisit them on a trained palate and re-evaluate them. This? This is great. I need to buy more of this and stop wasting money on somewhat dicey $10 bombers."
"I poured this almost opaque black beer into my glass and noticed a nice tan head that stuck to the glass throughout my entire drinking experience...yum! It smelled slightly sweet and chocolaty with a hint of coffee. It was very smooth, sweet, and bold. It's ""oatmeal"" label made the oat-taste stand out in my mind, but the flavor was filled mostly with coffee, chocolate, and perhaps some kind of herb like rosemary perhaps. There wasn't much carbonation and had a nice malty finish. As far as stouts go, this one is pretty good. I wouldn't have minded another bottle."
"Drinkability: This is good, but I think I must have it with a meal. This isn't a beer (for me anyway) for just drinking by itself, but it does go well with a meal (burger and fries in this case)."
"Picked up a Sam Smith sampler pack to get another one of their great pint glasses and do some reviews. The oatmeal stout started out pretty good, but had a little metallic taste to it. Worth a try though."
"Overall: Samuel Smith will always have a place in my glass--and this is the third sampler I 've got (thanks Jer), so I've got some extras--and revisiting this classic is a pleasant reminder of how nice drinking a beer can be: tasty, classy, relaxing and reinvigorating a New Year's Eve drag simultaneously."
"d - this is a great session beer and an excellent example of the style. could drink this all day if i pace myself, especially so in the cold michigan winter months. also, this beer pairs especially well with drier cheeses like sharp cheddar and provolone."
"I simply love this beer and just drove to three separate liquor stores to find it. It pours a beautiful dark brown color with a tan head that remains on the glass. The taste starts with a roasted flavor and finishes smooth with some caramel notes. I don't find this beer overly sweet at all. It isn't hoppy, but instead is well balanced like any English ale should be. I just drove twenty miles to find this beer and it is so smooth and well worth it. No American beer can match it. In a class by itself. I only wish I had another bottle."
"D - Refreshing and delicious with a lower ABV. Great stout."
"Notes: Balance, subtlety, and multidimensional grains make this a winner."
"Overall, one of my favorite beers of all time -- Ranks right up there with the Taddy Porter. The low ABV makes it an ideal sipping drink too...if only I could continually afford this..."
"M & D: Nice, smooth; very ""comfortable"" to drink. Hearty, without being overly filling. Good, cool weather dessert beer that I'll have again."
"D: Fantastic, could drink this one all day."
"D: exceptional on this beer. The flavor is so well put together, it is complex but not overwhelming, the oats do an amazing job or rounding everything out. This beer rolls over your tongue incredibly gracefully and the finish leaves you dying for another sip. Great example of the style"
"This is a very nice rich, flavorful stout. It has an amazing texture that I really look forward to in an oatmeal stout."
"Delicious beer, would go great with a range of food: Roasted meats, BBQ, smoked fare, chocolate desserts, truffles, ice creams. Well rounded and refreshing example of good, quality beer."
"Notes: Well, I'm finally getting around to reviewing Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout. It was the first Sam Smith beer I had and the first oatmeal stout I had. It remains my favorite oatmeal stout, and is one of the standouts in Samuel Smith's excellent arsenal of beers. This is considered the quintessential oatmeal stout, and for good reason."
"D: I really enjoy this stout. It's very drinkable and in many ways nearly perfect. A little more complexity in the smell and taste and I believe it would be perfect."
"A great stout, needless to say. I find, however, that one of these is plenty (which isn't necessarily a bad thing), so it gets a 4 on drinkability. Likewise, there could be more heft, and more creaminess to the beer."
"Overall this is probably the best oatmeal stout that is available at a mass scale. Easy drinking, smooth roasty flavor. Everything this style stands for. Pair it with bangers and toad in a hole."
"Great stuff!"
"550ml bottle served in my Sam Smith nonic. Poured a deep, rich brown, almost black in complexion with some ruby highlights around the base of the glass. Head is dense and frothy (almost nitrous-like) and tan in color. As the head sizzles and pops and slowly collapses, it exposes a pockmarked surface and thin sticky webs of lacing as it settles into a solid half inch cap. Malty nose with the suggestion of coca, brown sugar and flaked oats. Taste consistent with nose; however, I get a little milky sweetness in the mix (perhaps some lactic acid) and a slightly metallic quality that comes out at the back. Body is light-medium, a bit on the thin side and a little watery, but goes down very smooth as the carbonation is very even and subtle. I tend to like a little more mouthfeel in my oatmeal stouts; however, this is a very pleasant and sessionable brew. Probably my favorite offering from this brewer."
"Overall- It is an interesting brew which I encourage anyone who likes stouts to try this atleast once. I am sure there are better examples of this style out there but I could see this being a great gateway beer for someone that is looking into getting into craft beer."
"D: This one feels like you're drinking a beer. Goes great with any occasion. If you haven't tried one pick it up, you won't be disappointed."
"This is my first non RIS. I was expecting something weak and undrikable but this really hits the spot. A fine beer indeed!"
"Drinkability: An extraordinary drink, this beer is a staple for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! At 5% alcohol I can drink this beer all night and a classic among beer aficionados. When I woke the next morning I could still taste this beer and was very tempted to have a pint for breakfast."
"Ahh a classic. Poureds traight down the middle into a tulip glass and got a nice creamy 3 finger head with lots of lacing. Aroma is a very enticing sweet malty smell that invites you to take a sip. The malts are the star of this show and they shine tremendously. Nice sweet malty taste but not too sweet a good balance. The mouthfeel is a of a meduim bodied beer just enough to coat your palate and not overtake it. Great beer for sitting by the fire with a newspaper or crossword puzzle."
"so drinkable. session this. after you session half of the lineup from this brewery. amazing. one of my favorite breweries in the world."
"M/D - A surprisingly light body that has an irony, watery feel. Some modest carbonation."
"D: very drinkable, even sessionable at 5% ABV"
"D - A very enjoyable oatmeal stout."
"This beer was fantastic, flavorful, strong bodied, and tasty. I really enjoyed this beer. I did a beer tasting at my work for this beer, Wines Unlimited Stratford CT, and it went very well too. People bought this beer that night by the couples or fews, which considering it's steep price and it mysterious nature, this beer did well. I liked this beer. Jolly good!"
"EDIT: What a sweet mess, down the drain it goes... Stone's IPA is going to clear my palate."
"Well I got this as a recommendation from the great bear guide. This is pretty good but I have had a much better oatmeal stout. Founders Outmeal Stout is by far the best of this type i have had and one of the best of all beers. But Samuel Smiths version is pretty good. But, I would say Founders is MUCH better."
"A lovely, lovely sipper - quaffer - drinker - whatever, this goes down oh so very well, the oatmeal softening, and at times, leading the way. Not hard to see why this is considered to be among the progenitors of the style."
"Overall- tonight i bought two imperial stouts by samuel smith and one oatmeal. i wish it was the other way around. if you're a stout fan i highly recommend you to try this!"
"Overall this was another exceptional release from Samuel Smith that portrayed all of the qualities that I have come to expect from this brewery that takes great care in crafting their beer. Recommended."
"Pours a black color with dark red edges and a creamy tan head. Aroma of roasted malts, molasses, and licorice. Taste is delicious with flavors of roasted and sweet malts, chocolate, dark fruits, licorice, and a bit of coffee. Really nice smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Perfect carbonation. An extremely drinkable stout, this is a classic!"
"D: Excellent. Everything seems to be in balance, making this a very drinkable brew."
"F: Still a little somewhat sweet, some roasted flavors come out as it warms, the milk chocolate lingers with a very slight bitterness."
"(9.25/10)"
"D – This is very drinkable. Rich and full, but not too alcoholic or overpowering."
"A solid stout, but there are much better examples out there IMO."
"But I can chug this stuff down. Very drinkable. It's a rather mild beer and simple. I feel the score could be higher, but the lack of complexity hurts."
"This is a great brew with tons of flavor and character and at a lower abv can be enjoyed all evening."
"Very good overall. A perfect example of the style"
"It's not blowing me out of the water with its flavors, but it is very complex and mellow and definitely worth a try."
"For a darker brew, this beer is very easy to drink, and is incredibly enjoyable."
"D - This is an excellent oatmeal stout...one any stout fan has to try. It sets the bar high for this particular beer style. The low ABV also helps make it a meal in the bottle that you can enjoy one bottle after the next."
"Beer poured out very dark, with nice foamy head. I had heard this was an exceptional beer, and it did not fail. This is probably one of the best beers I've had in my limited beer drinking experience. I look forward to trying more Samuel Smith brews. This beer is a must for all BAs."
"cheers!"
"While in my humble opinion this isn't in the top level of stouts, I did enjoy this drop and definitely one I'd have again.."
"Just a perfect looking oatmeal stout. Very dark brown with a nice tan head. Head looks frothy and is retaining well. Smell is of very roasty malts, oatmeal and a nice Fuggles aroma. Seems like the perfect nightcap after a night of fantastic beers New Years Eve. Easily my favorite traditional oatmeal stout. Huge oat flavor along with the roasted barley and malts. Nice bittersweet chocolate flavor that gives the beer a dryness. Just fantastically well rounded, gently bittered and perfectly roasty. Not thin like many oatmeal stouts tend to be. Perfectly creamy and chewy. Breakfast in a glass. Low ABV, so this one is superbly drinkable. I could see putting a few of these back while fending off the cold."
"Such a good beer and the fact that its widely available means my wallet will suffer."
"I cannot recommend this one. However lots of people love this beer so i guess you'll have to try it for ourself and make up your own mind."
"Part of a gift pack poured into pint glass provided. Very dark brown that lets just a tiny hint of light shinning through. Nice thick creamy tan head that slowly disperses into a film. Only minor lacing. Aroma very neutral with just a hint of roasted malts. Very smooth to drink, feels great in the mouth. Very dry in taste with just a hint of roasted bitterness. A very chuggable stout and one that you can drink many of."
"This beer is a beautiful pour, gargantuan creamy head or subdued 1 finger that crest the glass like the picture on the box. Let the head die down so you can view the magnificent black body with dark brown bubbles. Sweet vanilla and cinnamon buns in the nose backed up by a roasty sweet malt aroma. Tastes like an un-bitter, roasty milk chocolate oatmeal beer. Molasses drizzled coffee beans are big in the taste followed by milk chocolate covered roasted sweet oats. Mouthfeel is creamy. silky and luxurious-heavy as well. As drinkable and tasty as they come, alcohol hidden even for a 5% abv."
"D- an extremely drinkable brew, prob. one of my all time fav. lower ABV stouts, loaded with flavor for the gravity"
"This beer is great. Over the years I have had it many, many times and it never fails to please. Great job from Sammy Smith."
"D - Delightful. Great by itself, with burgers, for desert. Tons of occasions."
"Pours a jet black with medium, foamy tan head. Lacing throughout. Aroma of sweet malts - toffee, coffee, dark caramel, chocolate.Smooth and silky on the tongue, very nice and well-balanced. Sweet? Yes but not overwhelming. Not too dry either - very nice beer but I agree with many others - this is not a session beer, but savoring a 550 ml bottle is very nice indeed!"
"Just keeps getting better throughout the bottle, and is quite drinkable, due to its non massive ABV. If you want power alochol, check out Sammy Smith's Imperial Stout. . ."
"Drinkability: Definitely buying more of this. I'm looking foward to the next bottle."
"D thanks you sir, can I have aother?"
"D- High- Fantastic. I'm not the biggest stout fan, but even I can't deny this beer. Highly recommended."
"This was one of my first favorites back in college in the 80s. It's still one of my favorites."
"The stout from Tadcaster pours a deep brown color with a tan frothy head after an aggressive pour. Lots of lacing lines the glass. The pour is quite pretty. The nose is quite sweet with the usual stout aromas of chocolate and coffee but this also contains some grainy nuts as well as malts. Taste is sweet as well with lots of chocolate. Where is the oatmeal?? Mouthfeel is medium bodied and crispy. Overall this is a very complex but well balanced that provides much more than the average stout."
"The first sip is very smooth with an even flavor and nice carbonation. Nothing is too overpowering, I'd say this is a perfectly balanced feel for this beer."
"After enjoying two Oatmeal Stout singles from Samuel Smith, I not only am going to try another brew from Samuel Smith's Old Brewery, I'm going to explore more in the world of stouts."
"Medium bodied, superbly easy to drink. A top example of the style and an all-time classic beer."
"Atmosphere is great. Beautiful appearance, and a great, complex, well-balanced nose. Flavor is a near-perfect balance of hearty malt, sweetness, and bitterness. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"would buy again and will enjoy the rest of the 4 pack."
"D: An excellent stout, though a bit heavy and taking a while to finish. I really enjoyed this and wouldn't mind more."
"The first thing I tasted with this beer is a medium bitterness. The bitterness is then taken over by a creamy, semi-sweet, roasted coffee/chocolate flavor. Its almost like if you were to put a little dark chocolate and a splash of milk in a cup of coffee. Although, most oatmeal stouts tend to have a more neutral acidic flavor than chocolate or coffee stouts. This beer is no exception- the acid flavor goes up and then comes back down with the coffee and chocolate. This is an excellent beer that is very well made."
"Overall a fantastic oatmeal stout. I could drink this all day."
"Drinkability - could easily drink a few in a night before it got too heavy for me. Truly a delicious oatmeal stout and will continue to drink it again and again."
"Overall, an excellent beer. By far the best of the 3 pack (which includes their EBA and EPA),d easily placed in the top ten beers I've ever had. St. Ambroise version of this is great, but I enjoyed this one much more. A perfect dessert beer but I could see myself having this on almost any occasion. I think this will be one of my favourites for a long time."
"D- Average, mouthfeel is great but with its heavier qualities I might be taking a breather before I drink any in a session, one was like a liquid dessert"
"Appearance is almost black with a big 2 finger off white head. The smell is very strong of chocolate and roasted malt. So is the taste, with a little bit of bitterness as its going down. The mouthfeel is absolutely perfect, almost creamy. Extremely great stout,highly recommend it."
"Everything I have tried from Sam Smith has been spot on. They usually set the benchmark for most English styles. The oatmeal stout is no exception."
"Almost black in colour, but you really need to look at a bit to notice it's brown tone. Very dark. Almost opaque. It's espresso look-a-like body is crowned by crema-like head, tightly-formed with a rich tan colour. That cap of foam shows excellent retention and clings thickly to the walls of your glass. Deep brown sugar aroma underpins notes of coffee and raisins. Tastes more breakfast roast than french. Initial coffee flavour gives way midpalate to fruit and semisweet chocolate. Finishes with a medium bitterness. Throughout, there is an underlying gentle sweetness. While not the heaviest stout around, the oats do give it some noticeable weight on the palate. It feels much heavier in the mouth than it does in the stomach. Very smooth and velvety, with very little carbonation. Well-rounded and flavourful, and a pleasure for all the senses. Outstanding."
"Overall it's pretty good, the mouthfeel is great."
"Overall, very satisfying. Definitely worth buying again."
"Final Thoughts: All in all, solid stuff here, nothing really to complain about. This would be great to have by a fireplace at the cottage or at Christmas. I'm not sure I'd say it's incredible, but it's certainly worth trying at the very least."
"D: A well balanced, smooth, and great tasting beer. This, along with the 5% abv make this extremely drinkable. You gotta love how smooth this is."
"I had pretty high expectations for this beer and after the first taste I thought it would be a beer that I would buy again. About halfway through however, there was an off flavor of sorts which could only be compared to rotting fruit. I did finish it but I was tempted to pour it out. Perhaps the fact that I spent $3.99 on it kept me from not finishing it. Overall, a very disappointing purchase."
"Notes: I rather enjoyed this, was my first oatmeal stout. Will be buying more from this company as I just found they have several of their beers at my local fred meyer."
"the brew pours relatively thin with a huge head and much lacing. the foam is a light tan colour, and the body is dark dark brown; it would be black except for the fact that light can get through it, even the center of the beer. mostly a malty smell, pretty light in intensity. it is not a 'clean' nose, but it is hardly trying to make a big impression. just kind of a malty, slightly oatmealy nose. the taste is much more oatmeal than one would expect in the nose. malts decently sized, and are complemented by an almost even amount of oats, which make the brew taste a bit sour. I like it quite a lot. the feel is a most a light-medium, but there is a very crisp carbonation that makes things a bit more exciting. the lightness of the beer, but the intensity and darkness of the taste make an interesting combination that I find quite chugable."
"D - ya its drinkable. Ive never had more than two oatmeal stouts in one sitting so i dont know how much of there i could have but it seems pretty drinkable"
"Cheers!!!"
"Very drinkable Oatmeal Stout as flavor is very balanced making this 550ml easy to enjoy till the end."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't drink a lot of these, but this 550 ml bottle will go down quickly."
"D - Very rich, but I could drink at least a couple of these in one sitting. I've never had an oatmeal stout before, and this is absolutely fantastic."
"This is certainly on the light end of stouts but still packs a complex burst of flavor. Brown sugar and molasses body, hints of wood, nuts, oatmeal, all overlayed on a light roasty malt base. Lightish/medium body but at 5% no surprise there; almost milk stout sweetness. Would gladly sit an English pub and quaff this most of the evening; it's a solid beer."
"D: With all the flavors, it's somewhere between a candy bar and a sandwich. The smoke is a little too strong, but it's overall great anyway. It's smooth and creamy, it's very easy-going, and it's well-rounded, with no flavor presenting itself too heavily. I love this stout."
"Overall, a solid choice for an oatmeal stout. My only real complaint is that it provided less of a bold roasted malt character that I love so much about stouts. Nonetheless, it boasts a complex flavor, solid appearance, and is exceptionally easy to drink. I would suggest trying it if you have not already."
"Poured an extremely black body with a thick khaki colored head. Aroma was roasted malts and I detected wet cardboard too. Mouthfeel was full bodied with medium carbonation. Smooth. The flavor is very different, it reminds me of soil - the smell translated to taste of course. I may be a beer nerd, but no one has ever made me eat dirt. This cardboard aroma and soil flavor lead me to believe this bottle is old or infected, I'm not really sure. Too bad because I really like oatmeal stout and WANT to like this one, but it wasn't good."
"Very drinkable."
"Overall opinion - One of my favorite beers that I drink regularly. I enjoy stouts and dark malty beers, so this was a real treat. And the price is spot on. Considering the quality of this beer, I think it's a steal. I would recommend this to a person that loves stouts, or even a person just getting into them. It's a great ""beginner stout"" since it doesn't really attack the palate like some stronger stouts might."
"Drank from a stifly poured bottle, and gave a nice head that was inviting. Not overly malty with a nice slight bitterness. The taste didn't stick to the palate as it was drunk. Overall, a beer I would drink again, although I am not sprinting to the beer store for another bottle."
"overall a true classic im glad to have on hand all the time"
"D- Really easy to drink. The smooth mouthfeel and full flavored but light qualities of this beer really contribute to this. Definitely a gateway beer for me and one I'm glad I revisited."
"Overall this is an oatmeal stout, not a stout brewed with oatmeal. Worth a shot."
"D: Very easy to drink. However, it isn't like there is a high abv to mask or anything."
"Poured a deep dark brown with a thick brown head fading to sheets of lacing. Smells of tobacco, chocolate, roasted coffee.Taste of burnt bitter coffee for a moment, then sweet chocolate/coffee with a mild bitter finish. Mouthfeel smooth with a medium body. Wonderfully easy to drink, the Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout was one of the first Stouts I ever drank and along with their Imperial Stout is still one of my favorites."
"If you like the style, or sweeter full flavored beers in general, this beer is definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability: Simply put- my new favorite stout."
"Drinkability: This is my first oatmeal stout, so I might be a little skewed. This is a great beer and I would highly recommend it to anyone. The oats really add a new depth of flavor to an already great style."
"Dark, rich pour with a finger of creamy tan foam. Silky and velvety texture, amazingly smooth. I could surprisingly make this a session beer. The sweet, chocolate flavor is not overbearing. It is perfect as an after dinner beer or for drinking a few if you are in the mood for dark beer. It smells of cocoa, nuts, and maybe a hint of cinnamon. Enjoy one of you get the chance."
"Bottle poured into a pint glass. This is dark, rich, and thick with a solid inch of head. The smell doesn't offer much, but has a faint sweet aroma hiding in the background. Taste is very sweet, combining semisweet dark chocolate chips, raisins, and the namesake oatmeal. This features a thick, creamy mouthfeel and awesome drinkability.. almost no alcohol presence whatsoever. This is a very solid easy-drinking stout."
"A great sipping stout. Will be stocking up on these when winter comes around again."
"D: Highly drinkable, flavor isn't too heavy but is complex enough to keep me intrigued. Enjoyable if you're looking to transition from a maltier palate to something that starts to be hoppy. This isn't it, but it'll wean you off the excessive maltiness."
"Possibly the best oatmeal stout in existence."
"Poured into a pint glass from a 50 degree chilled bottle. Dark as night with a tight tan head and lacing. The smell was fantastic and was better to me than the taste. Roasty toasty malt with a touch of hops. The beverage was bone dry but right for the style. Easily drinkable and a nice brew."
"d: With such a wonderful flavor and texture, not to mention a pretty nice ABV, this beer is certainly one worth enjoying again and again. This beer gets top marks for drinkability. Now excuse me, I'm going to get back to enjoying this wonderful beer."
"My problem with Samuel Smith's is that they all taste okay, but the tastes seem pretty similar - very dry and alcohol-heavy. This is fine, but I wish each brew was more distinguishable."
"This beer is a pleasure to drink. While not exactly ""session"" material, it's easy to drink and I could see having several over the course of a long evening."
"D- Good, seems like it would go good paired with a roast and thick stew. No chance of this beer overpowering your meal."
"Drinkability: Excellent drank my first on a lazy cold and dreary sunday afternoon and wanted to drink sip the afternoon away very good beer"
"I thought this to be an enjoyable easy drinking stout."
"I've saved this for just such an evening -- the first truly cool fall-like night to hit our area. A pint of this is an absolutely perfect compliment to not only dinner, but the evening. Let this beer breathe and warm up a bit, and its smoothness and complexity will be revealed. Outstanding!"
"Smell and taste go hand in hand. Chocolate hits the nose easily, and tastes easilyof coffee and chocolately. Light bodied for a stout. Light but noticeable carbonation. All in all, a very smooth easy to drink brew. One of the most drinkable stouts I've had."
"D: Very drinkable with a very complex body that changes througout the process."
"D - Very filling. It is an oatmeal stout, after all... Not too bad, but I've had better (see Barney Flatts review)."
"Pours a pitch black with a dark tan three finger head, medium lacing and decent retention, fits the style. Smells and tastes of oatmeal sweetness, roasted malts, some coffee, bitter chocolate and some hops, great taste, the smell is a tiny bit weak. Mouthfeel is kind of thin for a stout, no alcohol warming and a good coat of hoppy oat flavor on the tongue. Drinkability is great, awesome taste, good price, would buy again and no alcohol or bad flavors to ruin it over time."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink. This is my first oatmeal stout and I am definitely impressed with Samuel Smith's offering."
"Drinkability: The smoothness and the mild roasted malt profile make this a very easy to drink stout. My favorite Oatmeal Stout, but overall I prefer other types of Stout, such as American Stouts, Dry Stouts, Foreign Stouts and Imperial Stouts."
"as many said before me, this is an amazing beer"
"This beer has obviously been reviewd alot, but will just add that this beer is part of what got me to liking better beers and ""darker beers"" If you have friends who are hooked on water beer, something like this would be nice for them to try, looks dark but doesn't taste to dark. someone used to bud light isn't gonna take well to sierra nevada bigfoot ale, or new beliums trippel, so something like an oatmeal stout is a perfect great beer without the bite of some other styles."
"Good coffee, chocolate nose with great depth. The taste was real big - sweet chocolatey with a bitter end note. This is really an end to end desription but there was a lot going on in between as well, can't describe it. Very dry aftertaste and mouthfeel. A very highly recommended beer. I think it will be an awesome after dinner drink. Really impressed with this one."
"Overall: A nice beer, quite different in taste from the average stout (fruity). Strong taste for a low ABV! I'm happy that Sam Smith didn't disappoint me. Recommendable!"
"D: Rather a full taste for a 5% ABV. Surprisingly fruity for a stout. Another good beer from Sam Smith."
"a great all around oatmeal stout. i could drink this daily."
"Overall, this beer served itself well as a highly regarded oatmeal stout."
"Definitely a very drinkable brew. I could have easily had another couple of mugs. Pleasant and refreshing but with just enough body, it leaves you quite content."
"Taste is sweet milky chocolate with a slightly sour flavor and a bit of roast. The carbonation is low and it is not as creamy feeling as I expect in an oatmeal stout. There is also a bit of fruitiness that detracts from the smoothness of the beer. Maybe it is the brewery, but I have yet to be overly impressed with a Sam Smith's beer. It's a good brew, no doubt, but I can think of more than a few other oaty stouts I would pick before this one."
"The foam was thick, semi-dark wheat in color, smooth and lacey. The color was deep,dark opaque chocolate brown cola. The smell was a deep oatmeal with chocolate highlights, nutty accents and a barley overtone. The taste was crisp, thick deepness of oatmeal and slight chocolate accents. Nice hops andd wheat balance. Mouthfeel - Medium to full bodied, crisp, thick and semi-light viscous. Drinkability - a real good crisp stout. The only thing I really didn't like about this beer was the somewhat watered down feel in the aftertaste. Overall...not to bad."
"Good full, creamy body."
"I recommend this to everyone. A favorite."
"D - So tasty, I could drink this all day. Unfortunately it's not the most affordable brew. But if you want to know what an oatmeal stout can taste like, this is it."
"Mouth is delightful and smooth. Drinks slowly but great for the style"
"Pours a dark, dark brown with a two finger head that hangs in there well. The aroma is some chocolate and a little alki. The taste is sweet, chocolate and a bit of sourness; but I do not get much coffee. Feel was rich and smooth but not heavy. Drinkability was typical for a stout, you'd like to, but it's just too sweet and heavy to make a night of it."
"drinkability - a 5%abv oaty stout session beer!!"
"Notes: I would prefer a RIS rather than an Oatmeal Stout, but this is still a great beer. I find this to be a good beer to finish that night off with."
"Drinkability - It was very smooth. It left me feeling a bit full when drunk quickly. I feel that this is a beer worth sipping."
"Pleasing finger+ head of tan bubbles, the largest pop swiftly leaving denser foam to settle across the surface, moderate stickiness to the lacing. Mostly black, at some angles you can see dark brown to orange hues but not much. Very fragrant nose of black grape, blackberry fruit, black licorice and sweetened coffee, hard toffee, minor oats and other grains, nothing bitter here, very dominated by the fruit. In the mouth it's medium-bodied, the carbonation has a fine prickle to it and keeps things spinning around the palate. More sheer roast in the coffee flavors, bringing out more dark chocolate and cocoa as a result. Hint of witchhazel. Remains noticeably grapey, you also get red plum, cherry and blueberry fruit. Good grip, not too creamy, stands up for itself and not over ingratiating. The toast also teases out additional breadiness. Good length as it finishes, dries out steadily, tidy ending. Quite clear that this is British and not American made."
"Have not had this in a log time and a perfect session beer. Not real heavy but it can leave you full. Probably better sipped and enjoyed."
"Overall-a complex beer with lots of layers, worthy of a try for the hype alone, but I think it just didn't measure up to it's name."
"D - This could easily be a session for nights where I want malt and lots of it. Because Sam Smith's is so easy to find, I will give it consideration next time I'm looking for something cheap and malty."
"D: As mentioned, this is a heavy beer, but it manages to sit pretty light in the stomach. Obviously a few of these will fill you up, but they won't make you feel overstuffed or bloated. I would never turn one of these down. One of my favorites."
"Great stout, will be drinking again."
"Pours oil black from the bottle. 2 fingers of nice tan head dissipates rapidly. Light aroma for a stout. Not as much burnt roast smells as most stouts. Very mild and balanced flavor..I don't taste much oatmeal, but the flavors do have nice hints of chocolate and coffee. Excellent mouthfeel. Carbonation right on, nice and creamy. A very drinkable stout."
"NB. Beer tasting is easier without Maltese x poodle jumping up and down on your lap."
"Pours a very dark brown; nearly black color with a bit of redness around the edges where the light fights to get through. Initially it has an amazing creamy 3 finger head that slowly receeds and leaves a fair amount of lacing about the previously touched sections of the glass. Deep smell reveals traces of burnt grains, chocolate and little bits of coffee. Taking a deep gulp, it has that rich smoothness you would expect with anything advertising the name oatmeal. Immediate flavors of over-ripened dark fruit, coffee, chocolate and burnt barley/hop bitterness brings in the finish. The carbination is enough to make your tongue tingle...quite inviting for the next sip. This is a solid beer and each sip is a reminder that this beverage is well balanced...if only I had another."
"Overall- I'm a huge SS fan. This one isn't my favorite, but it lives up to my standards for this brewery. Not great but pretty good."
"No, it doesn't do it for me overall. It's just too light and a little to sickly. It needs some depth and body behind it. There are some decent characters, but there are also some odd notes that put me off."
"This is extremely drinkable stuff, with smooth pleasant flavours. It does venture into sweet territory at the back, but it's balanced enough for the most part to make it quaffable."
"Overall, this is a decent oatmeal stout. It isn't on the top of my list, but it is worth a try. One of their better beers in my opinion."
"Overall, very solid brew. Got it on sale and it was worth every scent."
"drinkability: One of the top stouts out there. Loved and will drink again"
"D - A truly world class stout! The flavours are beautifully balanced and complimentary, and the feel is of silk. This Oatmeal Stout is an example of why Samuel Smith's is one of the best breweries on the planet."
"Drinkability is great. Finishes clean and dry-ish - quite a feat, considering the huge body the beer has - leaving you ready for another sip."
"D: WOW, my first Sam Smith's and I'm amazed how they get a beer this robust in 5% ABV. My first true Stout from Englad and what an experience, I can see how these guys have lasted so long. I can't wait to try some of Sam Smith's other brews (Brown Ale and Impy Stout are first on the list). This is a MUST have for the beer lover and especially for the Stout lover! Another huge shout out for Porter's Pub in Easton, PA!"
"Drinkability: I'd say this is where it bogs down a bit, as I'd have a hard time putting too many of these back due to it's nature. The ABV is low but drinks harder than that. Still, an excellent beer for a dessert pairing or hell, as dessert itself."
" dry finish."
"This beer pours a dark,dark non see thru brown colour with a nice frothy three finger bubbly laced head with loads of prominent lacing down the glass,it has sweet aromas of chocolate,coffee and some feint hop aromas aswell to finish off on the nose,it has a nice medium,silky smooth mouthfeel with a bittersweet finish and sort of tastes like a very nice creamy cab/sav,it leaves you with a very full mouthfeel on the palette almost like you have just had a small meal in a beer quite a intrigiuing beer and definately stands alone in its catergory but probably couldnt have more than two in a sitting."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of oats, a touch of fruit. Taste is good, dark fruit, oats, a hint of coffee. Feels full bodied in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"CHEERS"
"The flavor of this beer is incredible. tastes like its aroma, just with more substance to it. The roasted malts balance its bitter hops nicely. there are definitely some roasted nuts in the flavor as well, and a hint of coffee, with a thick creaminess that makes it drink like a meal. Oatmeal character is definitely noticeable in the flavor and the feel."
"d - one of the first really high quality beers I ever had. I still remember the first time I tried this beer knowing that it was something special. This is an easy drinking stout while still having tons of flavor. It's easy to get a hold of and not too expensive. All around exceptional."
"-The drinkability is easy. This is a very nice Oatmeal Stout and one that anyone who is a fan of stouts will enjoy."
"Samuel Smith's beers continue to amaze me with their delicious flavours, complexity and brilliant drinkability. Their Oatmeal Stout takes its rightful place as my favourite stout in the world. More please!"
"Drinkability: I haven't had one of these for almost ten years until tonight. In college we called it sweet nectar of the gods, but could rarely afford it. Now I have no excuse. You probably don't either. This is an absolutely delicious beer. And at about 5%, you can drink it all night (and day)."
"Poured into a Sam's Perfect Pint glass. Had a nice appearance to it. Not too dark for an oatmeal stout and didn't have too much of a foam head that was an off white color, it lingers around sticking to the glass even after your done. It seems to look better after you start drinking it. Has a nice chocolate, molasses, and grainy aroma to it. Feels very nice on the pallet, almost drinks like a porter, seems a bit more carbonated than most stouts, it's also surprisingly drinkable for a stout as well."
"D- Not bad, would be near perfect if they could somehow toss that metallic flavor out of there and make it a bit creamier."
"Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout is one of my favorite beers, period. Once you begin to pour this exceptional brew you see why this beer is rated so highly. Color and head are enticing. The aroma could be a little stronger but this is dependent upon several factors which are not presently favoring this aspect; i.e. glassware, allergies, etc. Nevertheless, the flavor is creamy, coffee-like, slightly sweet and a wonderful bitter finish that completes it. There is an initial fruity character like prunes or raisins. One of the best stouts and beers."
"This is gonna be a new favorite in my fridge. The mouthfeel really pushes this beer over the edge, while still being a great sipper that does not becoming cloying at any time. Marvelous!"
"Drinkability: I would not have thought a stout could be this drinkable."
"Overall, I'm really impressed. This beer brings good flavor and a high drinkability. Very good for desert or a session."
"D - Quite tasty stout. Nice combination of flavors. I could definitely put down a few of these, although it would probably compliment a winter day better than an afternoon in June."
"I have to say that it's not as thick or heavy as I'd expect for any kind of stout. It's nice to be able to put away a few of these. The complexity and carbonation keeps it moving, but not too quickly. This brew is worth savoring and dissecting."
"Nothing special although I did enjoy it. Not too thick and rich tasting. For the price, I need more kick (ABV). There are better values with better taste out there like the sam adams imperial oatmeal stout. Not sorry I bought it but I won't do it again."
"D- I could sit around and smell this beer all night. I'd rather drink it all night, and I could easily do that. The taste and smoothness combine to make a very drinkable beer. And at 5% ABV, it won't knock me down if I put a few away."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - This is an outstanding stout! I was blown away with the richness of this beer, as well as the outstanding mouthfeel! I loved everything about this Stout, this thing hits the spot. Nearly flawless, and did I mention that it was overly indulgent? I could definitely have a couple pints on a toasty evening, sitting in front of a fire, ah. The drinkability is very high on this one, and I highly recommend that you try this. Cheers!"
"Drinkability is high. Doesn't go to any extreme that would inhibit its drinkability, and ABV is relatively low and not very noticeable."
"Excellent beer. I enjoyed it. Just started to get into beer as a hobby, but I liked this in all catagories. Enjoyed the smell. Could taate the oatmeal. Every drinkable. Fancy bottle was 550 milliliters. 18.7 fluid ounces. Enjoyed while sitting on pation watching the world go by. Very nice."
"Hands down the best oatmeal stout I've tasted. Another solid brew out of Tadcaster, England."
"cheers"
"I know Samuel Smith is credited for the revivification of this style in 1980, but I can see room for improvement/experimentation. I would prefer a heavier body and a greater intensity of flavors (maybe more oatmeal, higher ABV?). Still, this is one I return to with pleasure and anticipation everytime. This is also just the thing to nudge Guinness lovers a few baby-steps forward beyond the macro world."
"There are better oatmeal stouts out there but this one is still very good."
"M/D velvety mouthfeel and a smooth aftertaste that was very nice. Loved this one"
"Thanks brown bottle for saving me and allowing me to consume you once again."
"D= very high. Its so nice to have just a regular stout once in a while. This is a great beer. Classic example of a stout and great flavor for the sessionability. Awesome beer."
"Poured into a regular pint glass. Pours a thin black with a very light head. This one doesn't smell too strong, but you can smell the oatmeal. This is a very easy drinking stout, almost a beginners stout with very little bitterness. I really enjoyed this beer, very smooth, semi-sweet. I could drink a 4 pack and go back for more!"
"Drinkability: very high"
"A good oatmeal stout. Not my favorite, but recommend highly. Inexpensive as well. Lower in alcohol."
"D - I could have a couple. It's not something I can drink all night."
"Drinkability is very high here, I could drink this from the second the sun went down until I couldn't drink any more. Don't think I could handle this one outside on a hot day though, as with most stouts."
"D: low ABV, decent taste"
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: despite flaws, still a very worthy contender in this category"
"D- Seems like it could be a session type if its a cold winter night."
"Pours a nice dark and opaque black, with a large amount of head that dissipates after a while. Also leaves a generous amount of lacing while drinking. Smells great - toasted malts and roastiness like a coffee and has a hint of chocolate throughout. Tastes even better, with a sort of creaminess at first and a chewiness towards the end. Definite tastes of molasses or brown sugar, with some lingering tastes of oatmeal in the mouth! Damn delicious beer. Definitely a stout to look for."
"mmm I've got a newfound love of Sammy Smith . beers. Certainly not lacking in taste at all."
"D: Easily the best non-imperial stout I've ever head. It's amazing how a beer this small can pack so much flavor. If only Samuel Smith Imperial Stout were this good."
"A bit heavy to throw back a lot, nevertheless the best oatmeal stout I've tried yet and one I'll definitely be going back to when I get the chance."
"This is the quintessential session beer. At 5% you're not going to find many other session brews so tasty and easy to drink"
"Poured into a glass, as I always do. Black in color, with a nice mochaish head. Excellent lacing, great body...like your mom. Very sweet tasting for a stout, nodes of burnt coffee and chocolate, nice malty taste and excellent drinkability for an oatmeal stout. Really good beer here."
"18.7oz bottle. Pours opaque dark brown with a creamy light brown head. Smells of chocolate and toffee, along with a bit of nuttiness. Tastes dark and roasty with a lot of chocolate character and some metallic notes in the background. Some strange, almost vegetal notes from this bottle. Sweet finish. Thick, creamy body. Pretty impressive."
"This was the first oatmeal stout I'd ever had and got me drinking them, all thanks to a buddy from work. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass it pours an extremely dark brown almost black color with almost a ruby color around the edges. With the pour comes a decent sized off white, light tan head that goes down fairly quickly after the pour but still leaves a small head for a while leaving some nice lacing down the glass. The aroma is roasted malt and chocolate. The taste is fairly the same with the chocolate and roasted malt and is kind of sweet. Has a sort of medium feel to it and is a little creamy. With a low ABV I think this one is very drinkable, seems to go down really fast. I would love to have another. Another top beer from Samuel Smith. I've had a handful of Oatmeal Stouts and I think this one is definitely one of my favorites."
"Not something I'd usually be in the mood for, but let's call it a top choice for breakfast or dessert."
"I'm not sure how drinkable oatmeal stouts typically are, but man I want another one of these so I think that says a lot!"
"Subtle and delicious."
"Drinkability: A very good stout. Very easy to drink and very smooth. Not as sweet or creamy as some stouts and with more bite, but very good in its own right."
"Almost too drinkable fpr something this tasty. Stay away from the 12oz bottles and stick to the big boys."
"i liked this beer alot. i find that samuel smith's are almost always spot-on when it comes to meeting expectations on their style. nothing amazing, but solid and very good. i poured from a cold 550 ml bottle into a room temp pint glass. appears dark, with nice amber hues when held to the light. a thick, foamy head makes an appearance, but doesn't stay for too long, leaving just a bit of lacing. smells are fairly subtle: roasted malts, light on the hoppiness, and some coffee like smell, but nothing real sweet. tasted great. very creamy, with a nice roasted flavor with oats and balanced by a little hoppy bitterness (that doesn't linger long) at the finish. didn't notice much else except some burnt coffee/caramelesque flavors. mouthfeel was creamy and silky, just a mild bit of carbonation to keep it lively. not too heavy, but certainly not thin, i found it drinkable but not in a way that i would want to put down 2 or 3 bottles. a satisfying oatmeal stout."
"Been enjoying this one for years. Poured into my nonic pint glass. Appears a clear deep chestnut brown color with about an inch of tight, fluffy ecru foam. Smells and tastes of roasted grains, caramelized malts, molasses, milk chocolate, a touch of toffee and mocha. Full bodied and creamy with medium carbonation. This beer never dissapoints. A world class beverage."
"D: Very high, a supremely smooth version of an Oatmeal Stout and certainly the benchmark for the style."
"D - It's medium body lends itself well to drinkability in the oatmeal stout category."
"Drinkability: The balance of this stout really sets it apart from most other renditions"
"It was voted the number 4 session beer so i got myself one and wasnt dissapointed."
"Drinkability: This one goes down very easily and enjoyably. A brilliant beer."
"Pours black with a thick beige colored head. Good lacing down the glass. There are chocolate, coffee and roasted malt aromas. Good mouthfeel, not too watery and not too thick. Roasted malt, chocolate and sweet coffee flavors. Great flavor and perfectly balanced."
"D, this is the first beer i`ve had from samual smith. i have had it more then once so i do find it drinkable .grab a few of these and get yourself some pizza.cheers ."
"Notes: This is the third time I've tasted Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout, and each time it impresses me with how easily it goes down. It isn't the best looking, the most flavorful, the smoothest, or even the best example of the style out there, but it's still a darn good beer. I prefer my stouts a little less sweet and a little heavier, but if you're looking for an introduction into stouts this is definitely the way to go."
"Having read all the ratings & reviews first, my expectations were too high. Definitely a good beer/stout, and I will buy this again, but I guess I was expecting to find the Holy Grail of stouts, and I just dont see this as standing out above the pack."
"Overall, a good sweet stout that has good flavor and is very drinkable."
"Very dark appearance when you pour it out of the bottle into the glass. Tons of dark tan head which is thick like a cake sitting on top. Smells of roasted barley. The first taste you get is sweetness on your tongue then the flavors change as time goes on. The stout is heavy and definitely the roasted flavor. Very smooth not like a dry Irish stout. I really like this one with some oaty hints."
"I've not found many English beers that I would rank among my favorites. Not sure what it is, maybe the water. This one is the best I've tasted so far."
"medium to light body on this one, i would almost prefer a heavier body, but still a very good beer non the less. the drinkability factor is great, truly a sessionable beer. i would recommend this to anyone."
"Samuel Smith remains the king of the English ales and stouts in my mind thus far. This slightly off-centered oatmeal stout is certainly no exception. Think of a hybrid Dry Irish Stout with a Milk or Cream stout added to the balance and you've got this stout in your hand. Now sip, and enjoy."
"coffee. What great mouthfeel,chewy and sweet. This is one you could drink all night."
"D: I would end any and every night with this beer. It's a great session and a great sipper."
"Pours a black beer with a creamy tan foam head. Awesome looking stout, just as I expected. Smells almost like a coffee; nuts, molasses etc,. The taste is of oats, some chocolaty undertones has a great full bodied taste and mouth feel. Has a almost bittersweet finish. Some lacing on my pint glass. This stout looks, smeels and tastes delicious. One of the best stouts I have had. Very drinkable, almost like a dessert beer. I have not had several at a time so I am not sure how full this would make me. But an awsome brew none the less."
"There is a reason that this beer is one of the benchmark oatmeal stouts. It looks great, it tastes great, it feels great, and one could easily make a night out of a few. The oatmeal doesn't present itself as much in the taste as it does in the feel, giving it that classic ""chewy"" feeling. Unless you are allergic to stouts, this is a must-try!"
"Drinkability- When in the mood for an oatmeal stout, there's nothing better than Sam Smith's. As a beer, overall, moderate drinkability"
"D-Overall, I liked this beer very much and would have again."
"D - Moderate, certainly not the type of beer you would want to speed through, much better when enjoyed slowly giving it time to warm. The light, pleasant taste paired with overall good mouthfeel makes this stout easy to have a few of in one sitting."
"A dark brown/black color with a huge light tan head that lasts a while then fades to a thin cap leaving loads of lacing down the sides of the glass.Aroma has lots of sweet chocolate,some vanilla and licorice notes and a hint of grain.Flavor is kind of like those chocolate oatmeal no-bake cookies with a hint of vanilla,smoke,and a kiss of bitter coffee at the finish.A medium to full creamy mouthfeel,with just the right amount of carbonation. A well built stout , by any measure."
"Drinkability - Not sure how many of these I could pack down. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fiend for dark beer, porter or stout or schwartzbeer. I'd recommend Anderson Valley Barney Flatts Oatmeal Stout. Tastier to me, just as silky."
"D: Not a gulper. You have to take your time with this one. It must be embraced sip by sip."
"Mouthfeel is medium and very smooth and silky, as expected from the oats. Very easy to drink. A very nice brew."
"Excellent, I enjoyed it very much."
"A very good Oatmeal Stout that I would recommend"
"Poured black into its own glass, tan head a frothy one finger with good lacing. Smells of a chocolate cake, sweet brown sugar. Burnt coffee taste had nice balanced bitterness and with air took on a nuttier, bitter chocolate taste and feel. A few hints of molasses in the mix as well as a biscotti chewiness. Considering the taste, I found the body lighter than expected, smooth mouthfeel, a bit of dryness in the finish, brazil nut. Overall, this is a tasty Oatmeal Stout well deserving of a place in your cellar."
"D - This is a pretty decent oatmeal stout. Sweeter than I expected and smooth drinker."
"Flavor is very good: touch of sugar sweetness, dark fruit, grainy and roasty malt. Aftertaste is drier with light coffee notes. Very soft and smooth, but I wish it weren't quite so carbonated. Aside from that, the mouthfeel was great, medium but slightly chewy. Pretty delicious overall, probably the best english stout I've had yet. Goes down smooth and easy-- a joy to drink."
"D- At 5% this is quite drinkable and with the robust flavors I could drink a few witout getting bored. One of the finest examples of an oatmeal stout that i've had. I enjoy everything I have had from this brewery."
"Overall, my favorite release from Samuel Smith."
"Brown/Black pour. 2 finger light brown head. smells, well, like a stout. taste pretty dang good, Extremely smooth, and a nice thick creamy mouthfeel. Sweet, but not even close to being sickly. Taste like dark roasted coffee in the end for me. Hops shows up just enough to balance this one out. Nice Brew! i really like this one..."
"Overall, this is a quite good beer and definitely a good oatmeal stout. I do feel there are some things that could be done to improve it but given the consistent quality, it isn't necessary. The overall product is very drinkable."
"D = Was a chore to finish"
"Drinkability: Light and very tasty for an oatmeal stout. I can easily see why this is one of BA's most sessionable brews."
"D - a very drinkable stout and a good dark session beer; another great offering from samuel smith"
"T-You can definitely taste the oats and bread in this stout. Very smooth and easy to drink. A definite session brew."
"drinkability is great. excellent balance. a beautiful english stout and a hallmark of the style."
"D 5.0 - I don't love stouts in general - but I do love this one. It scores high in every category, and I really dig the tastes which would make it my first choice to date for a oat stout. This could be a sessionable stout if needed!"
"UK drinkers wonder why US beer geeks worship Sam Smith, and I'm starting to pay attention to the man behind the curtain, too. Not their best and not the best Oatmeal stout, either."
"The mouthfeel is thick, but definitely not the thickness of other stouts I have tried. Not to repeat myself, but it is very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is super smooth, sweet, fast-finishing, easy drinking, delighful."
"Notes - Like all of Samuel Smith's offerings, an excellent beer. This is the archetype of oatmeal stouts."
"Drinkability: I honestly have to say that this could possibly be my favorite oatmeal stout. Wait a few moments after each sip and savor the complex flavors that continue to dance on the palate. Each sip begs for another to follow. What a treat."
"Painfully delicious, going down easily yet begging for a slow sip to enjoy the rich, velvety, roasty nature of the beer. This is one of the first brews that I enjoyed in my foray into the vast world of fermented grain beverages, and one of the ones--if not the one--that made me realize that beer can be so much more than a pale, hoppy brew. Oatmeal stout still ceases to amaze me, and its near-extinction ceases to amaze me even more."
"Excellent English Oatmeal Stout. Very mellow brownish appearance greets me upon opening this beer. Smell is very pleasant, like newly baked bread with a cinnamon smell. Upon decanting it to a fine Guinness ale glass, it tastes rich and mellow with hints of clove, oatmeal, and a nice, malty finish. It is strong but never has any bite to go with the alcohol. It's very drinkable for a stout. Less bitter than Guinness bottled (the only good versions for me were on tap and in the Draught bottles and Cans with the Widget). Mellow, easily drinkable, rich, complex taste, and easily quaffable. Too interesting to be a session beer. I would give Samuel Smith an A- for this beer. Makes me feel warm and friendly drinking one. Recommended for most drinkers."
"I poured from a 550 ml bottle into my SA pint glass. It pours black with ruby highlights. A big, white fluffy head forms that will just not go away. The nose is sweet with hints of coffee and black licorice. The black licorice really comes through on the first sip, the finish is sweet and crisp. A medium bodied beer with a wonderfull creamy mouthfeel. The beer is meant to be sipped, but I would not have a problem quaffing this one. A very good beer."
"4 M&4 D: the mouthfeel is very smooth throughout and not heavy judging by its nearly rich flavour--a very enjoyable and refreshing stout with a good fruity and nutty backbone."
"D: Gets sweeter as you go along. Very drinkable."
"Bitter dark malt at first then sweet and creamy toffee, milk chocolate and more creamy goodness. The dark malt bitter returns again with swallow. Did I mention this beer was creamy? Silky smooth mouthfeel. Acquires a cola taste as it warms which is a bummer."
"D: easily drinkable and is somewhat of a standard for the kind. I can see why this brew has high marks and it aims to please. But, I still find this stout timid in some regards"
"Btw, goes great with cake."
"Drinkability Not my ideal style but good. One of these is plenty for me."
"Pretty good, but only one of these at a time would do."
"D: The classic oatmeal stout to which all others are compared. Well-rounded, moderate ABV, and extremely flavorful."
"D- I really enjoyed this stout. I'd say it is one of the better oatmeal stouts that I have had."
"it is very drinkable, especially for a stout, though like i said, it is thiner than a lot of stouts which may add to that."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer-- not as assertive as it's appearance would lead you to believe."
"D: Very smooth and easy drinking. With these flavors and the low abv, this is a very sessionable beer."
"Overall, not something I'd seek out again anytime soon. Honestly it feels more like I'm drinking soda instead of beer. I'm just not impressed by this."
"D: A variant of stout that too few brewers produce. The flavor is not as sweet as a sweet stout and not as dry as a dry stout which makes it a great beer to enjoy several. However, balance has its price and few would rate this as their all time favorite stout."
"A very smooth feel but maybe a bit rich for some. I'd cap it off at one bottle per sitting but that is not to say I would not want another later on down the line. Overall a fine example of an oatmeal stout."
"Drinkability is decent on this, but it is rich, that I could never conceive of drinking more than two of these oatmeal stouts in one evening."
"Cheers!!!"
"Pours a light khaki head, and settles to a deep dark chocolate with only a hint of ruby when held to the light. The nose starts with an acohol warning, developing into a dark fruit, rich and inviting. The flavor of figs and dates bubbles acrossed the tongue, falling back into a complex flash of caramel malts and soft sweet oatmeal, before finishing with the brewery's characteristic granite finish. Begging for another sip, I could drink the case tonight."
"Drinkability is good, but enjoy this one by itself, probably not good with food."
"I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I cracked this one open, and so this truly wondrous product definitely caught me by surprise. A dark dark pour with a nice creamy head and significant lacing, looks very appealing. The taste here was truly exceptional - oatmeal as the name would suggest, but a great balance of coffee and chocolate flavors with intricate complexity and not too dry. The best oatmeal stout I have sampled. Highly recommended."
"Note: I loved this beer! I've been looking for it for a while, and it's been sold out, so I was excited when I finally found it. I wanted to try it based on the great ratings I've seen. I'd love to go to the brewery in England for a try."
"Another excellent stout from Samuel Smith. Poured dark with an off-white head. Very earthy, roasty nose. Taste is full of creamy roast/chocolate. Simply felt amazing on the tongue. It glides all over the mouth, almost begging to linger. This is an excellent stout."
"A very good stout. Not my favorite by any means, but a good, tasty example of the style."
"D: Very drinkable, and with low ABV, could have tucked in to this one for the duration. But there were other beers to drink. :)"
"Poured from a 450ml bottle into a pint glass producing a beige colored 1/2"" head that laces the glass quite well as I drink. The color is deep deep brown/black. Excellent after dinner beer with the rich creamy flavor of roasted toffee and oats. Alcohol is balanced perfectly. This beer is rich in flavor and goes down very smoothly. This is an outstanding example of and oatmeal stout. Smells just like it tastes. Toffee and oats. I love this beer. Mouthfeel is perfect for a stout. Drinkability is good. Yummy"
"This beer is quite smooth. Goes down real nice and is one the best stouts I've had. The overall feel is strong but does not overpower."
"Drinkability: It's smoothness made this easy to put down. Only a slight bitterness at the end. That being said, the odd chemical/astringent taste remained throughout the entire beer. I enjoyed it, but I likely won't seek it out again."
"The first few tastes off of this one gives a metallic flavor off the head. Once I break though that I get the same berry taste that I smelled, almost like a grape soda. This is very smooth beer with no bite what so ever. Now as the beer settles I am getting a nutty flavor. I also pick up a grape taste. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth and this one is an easy drinker that goes down nice and smooth."
"Poured from 550ml bottle, an opaque dark brown-black with rocky tan head that fades after a minute. Smell: rich roasted and milk chocolate, brown sugar, a touch of earthiness and butterscotch. Taste: sweet with milk and semi-sweet chocolate, caramel, slight dark fruit and diacetyl. Fairly rich and sweet but balanced by the drying character and a touch of earthy hops. Velvety smooth and fairly complex for the style, with a notched up abv this would be really impressive."
"Notes: This has to be the classic oatmeal stout, once again samuel smith elegantly sets the bar for a style, there are no crazy undertones or bells and whistles with this beer, just classic stout."
"The drinkability is just great too. The only problem is that it costs a bit much for everyday. I think I'll just save this one for special occasions."
"Notes: This was quite a brew. The balance was near perfect,so tasty and filling. No letdowns here,simply a smooth and creamy treat."
"They are the original and the best for a reason."
"Some may feel that this beer has retained its greatness, and I agree to a degree that it is still a fantastic example of the style, but given the stout competition, I cannot say this is a beer for which I am going to rush back."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Nice carbonation. The dry finish sets up perfectly for another sip. Very drinkable."
"Overall a great stout that is inexpensive and highly drinkable. I can't say it's anything super amazing but I will pick up more."
"D - A great oatmeal stout...glad I finally got to try this...I'll be breaking this out on special occasions"
"I was expecting this to dominate other Oatmeal stouts I like but found for the price I will stick to cheaper os althought this is a great beer."
"Overall: A good oatmeal stout, but for the price not something special enough to keep on hand all the time. NOTE: smell improves greatly as it warms up."
"Yep, it was a good call, this is an awesome stout."
"Drinkabilty: Oh, why didn't I buy more than just this 20oz. bomber? It's been years since I've had this great beer. I guess since it has resided on so many good beer shelves across America for so long now, I've tended to take it for granted. But, I'm hear to sing the renewed praises (if they needed to be sung again anyway) for this special stout. It is truly unique, and such a pleasure to have. It won't be too long before I buy another bomber."
"I will revisit this, but the cost means that there will be long waits between visits."
"Nice, dry oatmeal stout. Really, I was hoping that I would like it more on this go round. It's not bad or anything. I just probably won't ever buy one again. Of Sam Smith's lineup, I've only loved the Taddy Porter. I appreciate most of their beers, but I often end up feeling a bit underwhelmed and disappointed. This beer is a dry stout with a full, smooth feel. It's dark, nearly black with brown highlights at the extreme edges. The head is beige and leaves some lacing. The aroma is chocolate malt with that dry note that I usually associate with Irish Dry Stouts (oh, Guinness...). The mouthfeel is creamy and full. It's the best part of the beer. Good beer but not great. (My girlfriend demands that I write down her note of ""baconey."")"
"pours very dark with a short tannish brown head. smell is slight of roasted oats. fantastic semi-sweet chocolate/caramel taste with a slight hint of fig?/raisin?/date? very smooth mouthfeel. definitely inviting to drink more to discover all the flavors."
"Very black pour, like a black hole with just the slightest hint of a tan head reminding us that there's life out there somewhere. Extremely roasty mouthfeel that warms the palate and the belly as it slides on down. This beer just makes a guy feel loved and at home with the world. Superb."
"D: I think this beer could relate to any palate. Yes sir, I could drink this Day and Night...Night and Day!"
"Truly fantastic, be sure to try this if you haven't already."
"Poured out of a 550ml bottle into a Samuel Smith's pint glass. Dark black body with a half-inch tan head and thorough, sugary lacing all throughout the glass. A perfect looking stout. Smell is sweet nuts, faint hop aroma, and oatmeal. Taste is roasted malt, piny hops, black licorice, leather, toasted oats, and a charred, bitter hop aftertaste that hangs around for a while. Velvety, silky mouthfeel has a crisp, dry finish. One of the smoothest beers I've ever tasted. Impressive. Overall, there are better oatmeal stouts out there (St Ambroise, Southern Tier) but this is still a great beer."
"D: Very tasty, could drink a lot of this."
"poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours black with no visibility, with a caramel heading,leaves a beautiful caramel lacing. Smells of mollases and roasted coffee beans,and hint's of honey. Taste bready with hint's of chocolate and caramel. A very smooth watery mouthful that goes down very smoothly. So far this has been the best stout I have tasted."
"The beer is medium/full bodied on the palate with a chewy, rich, yet smooth mouthfeel. It goes down extremely well, which I kind of expected from its low ABV, but either way it's a great oatmeal stout. Top of the line."
"Skip the pretzels, go straight for snackin' on some oatmeal chocolate cookies when enjoying one of these!"
"D- gotta say, this one lived up to my expectations. but i think i can find better representations of the style. REALLY good though"
"An enjoyable experience. Sets the standard for oatmeal stouts in my opinion. You can't go wrong with Sammy Smith's!"
"Thanks a lot to jac5084 for this one."
"drinkability- a lot of flavor that comes together i could definately sip on this beer all night long."
"D - Easy to drink - ABV is not high for the beer style. Not overly filling by any means. Flavors are muted, so it wouldn't become a wear on the tongue. Only knock here is the existence of that acidity that just doesn't go well over a session."
"7/4/7/3/13 (3.4/5)"
"(rated Jul 23, 2007)"
"Pours a dark pitch black colored body, with a huge tan brown head. Has an aroma of chocolate, and some oatmeal. Has a taste of some roasted malts, oatmeal, and more chocolate. Has a creamy mouthfeel. A medium body palate."
"I like everything this beer has to offer, tasty with a good mouthfeel, an easy drinker any day of the week."
"If you are looking for an oatmeal stout, this is the only beer you should be drinking. This is the best OS on the market bar none. It taste just like a bowl of cold soupy oatmeal. The best part of these beer is the fact it is readily available and fairly reasonably priced."
"D- Very high. Goes down so easy. The low abv is a big plus too."
"d: This richly deserves it's reputation."
"Dark-brown pour with a one-finger tan head. And its see-through. Aroma is nice; breakfast oatmeal with cocoa powder, some cream. More cocoa and cream int he taste, with a smaller helping of oats. Middle is kind of like a ""Whopper"" chocolate candy. Oaty, dry finish. I had to knock this beer for the mouthfeel. Its just too loose and watery for a stout, oatmeal or otherwise."
"OVERALL: A very good stout, very drinkable. I can certainly see why it's ""celebrated."" I would say it's not quite as good as the Tadcaster Porter, but definitely a great brew worth stocking up on. It's got an ABV that could definitely make it a prime session beer. One worth seeking out."
"Bottle. Always reliable Sam Smith. Pours a black/brown, light tan colored head. Smells of a slightly overcooked oatmeal cookie. Nice roast coffee and chocolatey tones. Could have more grain and oat characteristics. Just enough carbonation. Almost creamy mouthfeel. Warms very well. Finish very clean."
"This poured an opaque ruby with dark tan head. It smelled like dry roasted coffee and bitter dark chocolate with sweet cream and a hint of oats. It tasted like milk chocolate, sweet vanilla, roasted bitter coffee, and dry toasted oats. It was somewhat thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this had a very nice, complex flavor that was well balanced, quite clean and definitely tasty. It had good body, and was very drinkable. There was honestly nothing extreme or exciting about this beer, but it's a perfect benchmark for what an oatmeal stout should be. No frills, just solid."
"D - Another great Samuel Smith product. Traditional and delicious. Would love to try this from a nitro tap."
"D - Tasty brew perfect for a cold Winter's night in Chicago."
"Drinkability: For an stout, this one is defintley drinkable, although for the style there is definetley better choices, this one is still a good one to fall back on. Fairly sessionable for a stout. A tad boring for an stout yet the maltiness and the good mouthfeel make this a better brew. Not one I would seek out on a regular basis but I'm glad I tried it."
"Very drinkable."
"Overall: Excellent stout. One of, if not the best I've tried. Very good."
"Fantastic brew that I really enjoyed a lot. At the right temperature the nose blows me away. Great stout with a nice, creamy palate. Super malty- chocolate, toasted, brown sugar taste. Not very bitter. I really enjoyed this beer, this is probably one of my favorite stouts ever."
"A very dark oil with a tan head. Caramel, cream, oats, earthy, toasted malt, a hint of nuts and molasses. The taste is Oats, cereal and malt taste with hints of cream, chocolate and molasses. Has a creamy smooth mouthfeel. A nice full body beer with lots of flavor and a very smooth slightly acidic finish from the hops. I have been waiting a while to try this beer, now I know what the hype was about. All around a very good beer. Must stock up!"
"D - Absolutely perfect drinkability. The flavor and mixture of the smoothness are just perfect. It goes down very well and leaves you with a wonderful aftertaste. Slightly refreshing in a way. A perfect beer to drink during a cold day, as the richness is wonderful."
"Drinkability: is very high"
"this is pretty much the defining ale of this genre. and sam smith is the beer geeks coca cola, widely available and always excellent. this beer pours a dark brown, as dark as you'd expect from a stout but it has a very persistent head. for mouth feel and rich smoothness sam smith's oatmeal stout can't be beat. they've got the carbonation to richness/thickness ratio just right. this stout is no slouch on taste either. theres a very slight estery taste here but it has a very pleasant finish. i think sam smith's is a bit sweeter but its not cloying."
"Overall a well rounded stout."
"Fantastic, really."
"High drinkability and an overall enjoyable experience. Great beer."
"drinkability is definately high due to a modest alcohol percentage and delicious overall experience"
"Pours a dark black with a nice tan head, but not too thick. Good lacing throughout consumption. The most recognizable scents are coffee and roasted grains. The taste is overwhelmingly of coffee, but it is possible to detect some oatmeal taste. The coffee taste does a very good job of disguising the alcohol as well. It's a very good beer."
"A great example of the style, one to savour."
"D: Tasty when not paired with chocolate cake. Extremely sweet and drinkable"
"Overall a good brew, but not as good as Young's Oatmeal Stout. I wouldn't pass this brew up but I'm not going out of my way to get it. It's session-able (if that's a word) but I wouldn't have more than 2 in a night personally."
"Pretty good drinkable beer."
"d: I'll want more; it's tasty and drinkable."
"It's an easy drink that doesn't demand a finely tuned taste to appreciate. The carbonation was not overpowering like you see with some hoppy ales. It felt good in the mouth, not too thick."
"Pours a dark black color with a nice dark tan head that thins half way through. Smells like sweet dark chocolate, as it warms, maybe milk chocolate. I taste hints of oatmeal, definitely some sweet dark chocolate, roasted malts, and a little bit of coffee. The mouthfeel is unreal, from the look I thought it would be thick, this beer drinks so thin, the texture is like water. The drinkability is the same, goes down so easy."
"Very enjoyable, and highly sessionable at the abv. I could drink a few of these. Great beer."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D-Good drinkability. A quality flavor, probably one of my first oatmeal stout loves, due to its easy drinkability and enjoyable qualities. As I progressed through the bottle, it did start to feel heavy, but I'll surely be enjoying this one again in the future."
"D - This is a great oatmeal stout with a wonderful balance of sweet and bitter."
"D - A rich brew that will not disappoint dark beer drinkers and quiet possibly win more of their lighter brethern's drinkers over"
"Mouthfeel: Low carbonation, thin, and kinda oily."
"This gently carbonated beer is rich on the tongue, nicely balanced and has a long finish."
"Notes: A real classic of the style. I'm not sure why I don't buy this stuff more often, especially at the very reasonable price of $3 per 550ml bottle."
"I used to drink these alot but haven't seen it in a while around here. Pours fairly dark but you can still see through it, not too much of a head, kinda thin feel, overall a good beer that isnt too strong. I could drink this beer everyday. All there other beers are good also"
"a damn fine stout that i wish i could get year round."
"Overall, this was a fantastic ""Oatmeal Stout"" that really outshines most others in this style. I really enjoyed the sweetness of this brew."
"All in all, a phenomenal stout, especially when taken into account that this is widely available."
"A good stout. Nothing really stood out good or bad but pretty much all around solid. Kind of a smooth easy drinker stout."
"Quite easy to drink."
"While full bodied, this beer is never heavy or hard to get down. A fine example of the style, and one I will return to."
"M&D--Super silky, minimal carbonation makes for just right porridge for this bear. Not heavy, either--a super balanced beer that wears its age on its sleeve in the way it comes together tastewise. Truly refined, and a humdinger of a beer. Don't miss this classic of the style!"
"If you're not exactly 'new' to craft beer than chances are good that you've already a stout that is fuller, richer, and a heck of a lot more decadent than this; I can think of handful in the same oatmeal stout category. But Samuel Smith is who we have to thank for reviving the style after it had gone extinct before the First World War and considering the success their Oatmeal Stout has had at it, I think that's got to say something."
"Would buy this again and again, price was steep for a 4 pack but you get what you pay for."
"believe the hype. This is an awesome oatmeal stout. Sweet, rich, not too thick, which lends to drinkability. Pours dark coffee to black. Sweet like chocolate up front with slightly bitter aftertaste Complex taste and good both cold and slightly warmer. Not too high on the alcohol content, which prevents it from losing taste. A classic."
"I really enjoyed this - and think it has amazing drinkability and flavor for a relatively low ABV brew. This is probably the most sessionable stout I have ever had. The amount of smooth flavor this guy can pack in is truly awesome. Will definitely reach for this again in the future."
"D: Easy to drink for a stout--not too thick and not too thin. Been one of my favorite beers for a couple of years a still has yet to be usurped."
"Future outlook: Repeat business imminent."
"Blackest night of a brew with big frothy head that sticks around for the party. A sweet aroma that sifts through the air from the first pour. Smells of sweet chocolate, oatmeal, cereal and some dark fruit. Tastes of sweet oatmeal, raisins, and chocolate malt aftertaste. A great after dinner drink that could be a dessert of its own. Think chocolate mousse in a drink form. A wonderfully rich heavy bodied brew that'll have you swimming down chocolate rivers like you were chillin with Willie Wonka. Enjoy!"
"Solid all-around beer . Very good. Worth trying if you haven't and worth trying again if you have."
"Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout is a classic English stout which I first became acquainted with over a decade ago. It's been a couple of years since last I enjoyed this beer. Having come to love the bold Imperial Stouts with their aggressive American hop profiles and viscous motor oil consistencies I find this a significantly thinner, milder and softer stout than I remember, but no less delicious. Still a classic and still one of my favorite stouts."
"The taste is just great. There is a definite oatmeal backbone to the beer and it comes through in its consistency. The beer has wonderful toasted and roasted dark malts, it has the slightly charred grainy notes, and the caramel maltiness to make it a delight. There is a slight butterscotch flavor to the beer that detracts ever so slightly, but this one is well worth seeking out. There is also a milkshake quality to this beer, and it has the characteristics of a lactose-milk stout. It isn't a strong ABV beer, and the mouthfeel is a bit oily, with an aftertaste that is not overly sweet, more like a refreshing, complex, and interesting thick chocolatey after dinner drink. L'Chaim."
"Could enjoy multiples. The creamy brew settles great in the stomach and is not too filling."
"D: This is a very nice oatmeal stout and is, so far, my favourite offering from Samuel Smith's. I will definitely buy this beer again. perfect for the upcoming cold winter nights!"
"Overall, this is a phenomenal oatmeal stout, and another fine offering by Sam Smith."
"Moral of the story: don't drink your stouts, especially this one too cold. Actually, don't drink just about any beer real cold. This is a perfect example how much aromas, flavors and feel improve with some time out of the fridge. Samuel Smith is a quality brewery; this is a great oatmeal stout I'll keep coming back to."
"This stuff isn't the best oatmeal stout I've ever had, but it's very easy to drink. It is, however, better than I remember it from years past. I'll be buying it again."
"Overall, this is a pretty great beer. If you're into stouts but haven't tried a lot of ""unusual"" ones (i.e., if you're a Guinness drinker), I entreat you to try one or two of these. Good stuff."
"this brew pours up black with a nice frothy, tan head. the nose is dark malts, cherries, oats, hints of vanilla. the taste? Ahhh the delicious watered down malt taste like almost all dark English Ales (*sarcasm*)...taste is the same as nose minus the cherries. slight metallic sweet malt finish, watery medium bodied, low to medium carbo. Im not a fan of the watered down English Ale taste but this surely beats Young's Oatmeal Stout."
"Overall, the caramel flavor kind of overwhelmed me. I give it good points because it's a good example of the style, but I couldn't have more than one of these."
"This is a nice beer. I've had some oatmeal stouts are brewpubs that I consider much better, but this one is a winner. At face value (and not style, comparisons, etc.), this is a terrific beer that you can have more than one of and not feel like changing gears."
"D- That bitter, dry feeling calls for another sip. And another, and another..."
"D - Ok, not my favorite stout. Too light and watery."
"D: Loved this beer but the combination of the tanginess and sour bitterness at the end makes this an ""in moderation"" drink for me. A quality stout for sure."
"D - Very presentable, I'd share this with an honored guest."
"D: It was a medium bodied and has a light ABV but the biting aftertaste limits this to a one and out beer for me."
"Excellent Beer."
"This beer goes down smooth. Enjoy this one all you want. I would call it a very sessionable oatmeal stout. In fact if you closed your eyes you might mistake this one for a much lighter beer."
"Its a good beer to be sure, but its a little pricey. I'm looking forward to using this beer as a standard to measure Youngs Oatmeal Stout against."
"All in all a great beer, I will be back for more."
" This is a great beer. I would save this for a finisher, maybe with dessert or on its own later in the evening. I don't think I would have multiple in one sitting, however. I am glad that it is easily found around me, because I definitely will be getting this again and again."
"D - Very high. Great session or finisher."
"A must have for Stout lovers, i wish it was more readily available out here in hawaii."
"D - This is super drinkable stout. It has great flavor to it, a nice MF and only 5% ABV. This is a beer that I could easily drink one after another and I would definitely pick some up again. One of my favorite oatmeal stouts if not the best one that I've ever had."
"Pours a pitch black with a small, creamy tan head. Smells of molassas. Taste is slightly sour, chocolaty, with a hint of earthy hops. Mouthfeel is slightly watery, but velvety smooth. Carbonation levels are slightly high. Drinkable, this is easy to finish the entire pint bottle. A good ale from Sam Smith."
"mouthfeel is smooth, good carbonation, a nice stout indeed"
"I actually got some beer novices to appreciate the color and taste of this beer!! Awesome"
"O: I didn't care for this beer too much. An above average beer at best."
"This is a good stout. Even during my times when I did not like stouts I still liked this one. Black in color with a very thin tan head. You could certainly taste a hint of oatmeal and chocolate with some malts in the flavor. Very smooth and easy to drink. Finish is slightly bitter. Warming with a chocolate and oatmeal aftertaste. Very good."
"Out of the bottle and into my mug it is as dark as used motor oil. Not much head that fades to a thin ring around the glass. Nutty aroma with overtone of molasses. Chewy, yummy mouthfeel spiked by medium carbonation. Complex on the palette. Unsweetened chocolate, walnuts, hints of toffee, toasted oats and a lingering coffee finish. Good, but just a little odd, like British cuisine in general. Not my favorite Stout or Sam Smith offering."
"this is sweet and filling, this is like everything that i love in a hot fresh loaf of oatmeal breed brewed into a beer of extrodnary flavor and complexity. this is like a meal in a glass. this is as close to a purfict 5.o as you can get. this is top ten of all time and the greatist oatmeal stout i have ever had!"
"D - Not something I'd drink anymore than one of in a night but I could see myself drinking this pretty often. Yummy stuff."
"This was the overall best in show at our recent tasting of 11 totally different brews at my place among about a dozen people who aren't normally beer drinkers outside the Macro stuff, but considering some people came back for more. I'm pleased to see that this helped launch some of my friends, including my significant other into darker beers."
"550 ml bottle"
"Makes this brew very easy to drink and equally enjoyable."
"MF&D - An absolute classic. Hands down the best oatmeal stout out there. You could drink this one all day."
"Overall: good choice, made a good breakfast. Don't know how many I'd drink in a row, but I'd definitely have one for breakfast again."
"A thick, well-balanced drink with minutiae flaws - barely worth noting, even. A classic drink, it seems - and one I will definitely return to in the future. In fact, the very near future."
"The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but it does stick to the mouth. Drinkability is out of this world, and paired with my elegant PB and banana sandwich, I'm pretty sure I could drink this one every morning for breakfast."
"This is a medium/heavy-bodied beer with some sweetness from the malts to start, followed by a little smoky flavor. It then finishes with a slight bitterness at the end. Very smooth."
"Overall a great beer. Great drinkability and very enjoyable. A classic."
"D-Very enjoyable stout, could only foresee having one of these in a setting for sure. First experience with SS and will be looking forward to trying some other products."
"Very, very good. Appearance is just perfect: dark, dark color, slight amber in bright light. Dark brown, creamy head with lacing on the side. Now this is an oatmeal stout! Aromas are roasty and herby cocoa, hops, grains, potatoes, caramel, malts. Its a menagerie of great smells! Taste is creamy and sweet with a dry, bitter finish to it that is infectious. Like I said, very creamy for the mouthfeel, a perfect light, airy desert. Overall, one of the best."
"For all of the hype surrounding this beer I would consider this no more than average in overall quality. I was so excited to open this up but after a few pulls I realized that although this is a good stout it is merely average to me. Next time I will spend less money on a better stout."
"D= This is a damn fine stout and one of my all-time favorites."
"D: This beer is/was very easy to drink. Not too heavy, as some stouts can be, but certainly not a light beer either. Smooth from start to finish, as all good beers should be."
"This is one tasty stout."
"Probably the best widely available Oatmeal."
"Overall, pretty good brew. Though it's not my favorite style, I'd reach for this one again."
"Poured jet black with a decent dirty, tan head to it. Nose was a little roasty, chocolte, toffee and maybe some espresso. The taste followed with the nose. It was rather malty and much deeper than previous bottles I had consumed. I know these bottles had been sitting on the shelf for almost a year. It tasted quite nice, much maltier, thicker and fuller."
"This beer is rather thick and heavy, despite the delicious flavor, it would be difficult to drink more that two in one sitting."
"overall, i really enjoyed thisbrew"
"Everything comes together well in this brew. To me this is the standard for oatmeal stouts and I highly doubt I will find one better tasting than this, hence the rating."
"The bottle expires in Nov 08, so wasnt out of date, but wasnt fresh either. A solid offering, but I have had better oatmeal stouts ."
"This was the first oatmeal stout I have had. It was recommended to me and I am glad it was. This was a great beer. It smelled wonderful, tasted awesome, and felt great when I drank it. as far as drinkability I am going to get some more of this tomorrow."
"D - Very drinkable... Enjoyable stout... Another top notch offering from the folks at SS..."
"Drinkability is high. One of the better Oatmeal Stouts I've tasted and definitely lived up to the hype I've heard about it."
"Overall a rather good oatmeal stout."
"D Fair due to heaviness but aren't all stouts?"
"Also to note...the bottle when empty is still on the heavy side. no skimping at all in the manufacturing of these bad boys!"
"Drinkability- I've had this before, but finally got around to rating it. Class oatmeal stout with few as good."
"Not nearly as heavy as many would think with a perfect balance of creaminess and carbonation. An easy choice for a session brew."
"When poured it was very dark in color with an off-white head. A lot of carbonation in the beer, which was also tasted. Slight laciness on the sides. Not much in the smell department. Slight fruity smell after a couple of tries. Mouthfeel was good, like a stout should. Smooth but one-dimensional. The taste was bland with an aftertaste of fruit. Not very complex. The beer did not sit very heavy for a stout. Defintely not a session beer."
"D: A low ABV, a great choice as a session beer as it is not really heavy."
"D: This is a highly drinkable oatmeal stout. The sweetness never becomes cloying, the flavor is well-balanced and interesting, and the feel is top-notch. An excellent pair for anything sweet or sugary, also a nice late-night beer. Could be sessionable."
"Awesome stout!! Highly recommend!!"
"D - One or two of these"
"From a bottle into pint glass. Dark as night with about 2 inches of mocha colored head. Some head retention that boils down to a small coating on top with little to no lacing. A very ""malty"" nose. Great roasted flavors that make me think of dark chocolates and rich coffee. I'd take this over any coffee after dinner or for breakfast. Initially very smooth and velvety then the carbonation takes over. Low carbonation which I think gives it a heavier feel. Nice crisp bitter finish. Man I can drink this all day."
"12 oz bottle in to an imp pint glass. Pours dark bron with a tan head that is holding strong. Chocolate and roasted malty smells. Some sweet on top of malty taste with roast in the background. The oatmeal creates a great mouthfeel that is a little sticky. Very easy drinking stout because of the great mouthfeel."
"Overall, very good, surprisingly drinkable. Reccomended."
"I love this stuff, it's delicious, smells good, and generally warms the soul, and takes the edge off the day."
"A benchmark beer."
"D - The only thing that limits the drink is the slightly heavy body. All in all, the low ABV and great flavors make this a pretty solid session beer"
"Funnily enough, with the smoothness of the beer, and the sweetness of it compared to other stouts, this is a great gateway beer into stout drinking."
"Still a well-crafted brew that leaves a lasting impression: You'll NEVER forget it. A chew-tastic hunk of fruity coffee power."
"Dark brown and dense with a substantial cafe au lait head. Smells of oatmeal, toasty with a hint of fruit. Tastes very malty. There's a toasted oat flavor; both bitter and sweet. It has a sort of charred aftertaste. Mouthfeel is rich, not too thick or acidic. This is a drinkable beer, and very flavorful. However, it is so multi-layered, full, and complex, it's not something you would want to drink on a regular basis."
"Haven't enjoyed this offering in way too long. Exceptionally drinkable for such a heavy style-a classic!"
"This is one of my favorite stouts. Has a blackinsh brown color with a thick tan head. Good lacing. Lots of black and roasted malts with a good amount of sweet oats. The flavor also has a deep and rich malt profile. Chocolate and oats with some bittre hops to keep check. A ful yet crisp and refreshing body. Goes well alone or with a pub meal. Great stuff."
"I paired this with a late night snack of fried eggs topped with black pepper and chives alongside some cracked pepper encrusted bacon. Lovely combination."
"Pours a dark black color with a nice ample, brown head. Aroma is strong and malty like a stout. Taste has oatmeal upfront and finishes with a coffee aftertaste that's very smooth. Very subtle and yet delicious. While not as strong in flavor as other oatmeal stouts I've had, I still believe this would make a great introduction to the style (Oatmeal Stout). Very good fresh (as fresh as I have gotten) but don't let it age in my book."
"D - Fairly drinkable, but not a session beer. Sweet and malty overall with a nice, malty chocolate flavor. Not quite enough roast in the aroma."
"Any time a group of stout-lovers get to drink Sam Smith's, their reactions are going to be predictably happy ones. As oatmeal stouts go, it's well balanced and a touch on the heavier side. But filled with a ""wonderful rich flavour"" and a beautiful brown pour, it's clearly one of the best of its kind."
"This beauty pours like a frothy coffee. It's nice and stout...and don't get me wrong about the flavor. Even for those non-stout lovers, you've gotta get some of these even if you're not the biggest fan of the style. Mmmm Goood!"
"All in all, this is a good, solid stout Maybe a little heavy on the toasted oats. Not my favorite oatmeal, but definitely worthy of the occasional visit."
"A world class offering from Samuel Smith. If you like this beer and haven't tried the Taddy Porter...be sure to give that a whirl too."
"D- Easily one of the very best stouts out there, period. I could drink a few of these whenever. I recommend this to anyone, even if they don't like stouts."
"Great brewery with an always satisfying beer."
"The taste is similar, rich, and full-bodied, sweet with a wonderfully balancing bitterness. It has qualities of fudge and raisins. The palate is creamy, thick, and silky."
"Another premium beer from Samuel Smith Brewery. Enjoyed this one slightly chilled in a pint glass. Poured a deep baker's chocolate brown. Nose had a beautiful bouquet of roasted malts, some faint oats, and bittersweet chocolate. Taste was thick and chewy with dark cocoa, roasted malt, and brewed coffee notes. At the top of my list of favorite dark beers."
"Prost!"
"This review (and reviewer) doesn't do this beer justice as it is a very complex, and more importantly, a very, very good beer to drink. Stout fan or not, this is a must try."
"Excellent beer, a prime example of the style... if a new beer drinker would want to try a stout, give them this."
"Drinkability: High. However, it is a stout, after all, and so is quite filling. I have no problem drinking three or four of these in a row, though, so if your stomach can handle all the epic beer it's receiving, your mouth will certainly be able to savor more than one of these mighty stouts in a sitting."
"Notes: Simply one of the greatest tasting brews I have ever had. And until now I hadn't reviewed it for some reason. Please, pick up some and treat yourself to one of the finest crafted beers."
"Mouthfeel is smooth with easy drinkability, could have 3-4 of these for sure. Overall, as long as you get a fresh bottle, a great choice for dinner with a burger or fish or whatever you like. Not overpowering like most stouts. Just right."
"The color is a very dark brown in dim light maybe mistaken for black it has a wonderful smell of rich chocolate, brown sugar with a hint of molasses the, taste stays very well in your mouth and almost has a warming sensation and finishes extremly clean, this is definaly a beer i could keep around to drink on occasion when i was in the mood for a stout."
"D: I could drink a bunch of this. Too bad it's so expensive. I always keep a look out for it going on sale."
"Very easy to drink. Easy to session and still quite tasty. I've passed over this beer countless times in beer stores and now I wonder why."
"Sammy smith's oatmeal stout pours a deep deep black with good fluffy off white head. lace in nice. The nose is the weakest part of the beer with some malt smokiness and a coppery smell. Taste is defenitely the strongsuit here, and is immediately a roasted malt flavor that is huge with great smokiness and a wonderful burnt meatiness that sits well through the middle. The finish has some hops, but not enough to be bitter. Very silky mouthfeel through the middle, but still good carbonation. A grainy feel towards the finish detracts a little bit. aftertaste lingers smoke. Drinkability is superb, as there is a lot of flavor here for 5% without feeling abrasive or too soupy. Overall a fantastic brew by sam smith's. Defenitely one of my favorite cabin brews! I would love to clone this someday. Great beer."
"D- Very drinkable, but probably limited to one or two at a sitting. It's very filling, like drinking a loaf of very tasty bread"
"Dark brown color, carefully poured produced a light brown foamy head at about 1/2"" of depth and left good lacing down the glass. The smell yields some nice but faint aromas of dark roasted malt, a hint of coffee, and some additional aromas of lighter malts. The taste is this brew's strong point. An even mouthfeel, slightly chewy and very creamy, and a complex mix of malty goodness combine well with the relatively light carbonation all add up to an excellent experience. Samuel Smith's typically produces high quality brews and this is no exception. Very good."
"D: A very drinkable stout due to the smoothness and low ABV."
"D: Nice complexity and very easy to drink...could have pint upon pint upon pint of this stuff! An all-around superb brew."
"D- full of pure natural flavor, one of the things that appeals to me most about sam smith is the taste of the water. i wish i could get it by the gallon. all their beers seem so classy and traditional, and are entirely drinkable. this oatmeal is no different."
"Overall, this beer is one of my all-time favorites after just having one of these and I'll definitely be heading back for more. This is an oatmeal stout lover's stout. I was very impressed and I believe it is definitely worth a try at least!"
"T: Very well balanced, this beer opens with the roasted malt and the mild cocoa and coffee and oatmeal sweetness in perfect harmony. This beer is medium bodied, big enough to hold the flavors together while light enough to be truly refreshing. Mildly bitter on the finish with flavors of oatmeal, chocolate and raisins lingering, this is smooth on the palate with light carbonation. A touch metallic on the finish (iron?), this is the only flaw I can point to here. The oatmeal does take the edge off the roasted malt bitterness. I could drink an awful lot of this."
"Very nice beer."
"D: Pretty heavy beer, pretty much a meal in 18oz form, but a very good meal nonetheless. This is a highly drinkable beer and if they weren't 3.50 a bottle I'd like to tip more than one back any day of the week. Very good beer."
"D - it's not one of my favorites, but i will definitely enjoy it again. a really good oatmeal stout."
"Poured from a 335ml bottle into an Allagash Witbier glass, the beer appears to be dark drown in color with a moderate tan head. The aroma hints of roasted nuts and chocolate. The beer tastes with hints of caramel, chocolate, nuts, and malt. The mouthfeel is that of a moderately carbonated beer, and is easily drinkable. The beer carries no lacing down the glass, and there is a strong after taste of roasted nuts."
"Poured a dark brown, almost black color with a short tan head that laced the glass all the way down. It had a very nice malty and oatmealy aroma followed by some hints of chocolate and caramel. The taste has alot of deep roasted malt that is followed by hints of chocoalte, caramel, and some rich oatmeal flavor that was actually pretty sweet. The mouthfeel was very good as it was a very smooth and velvety and warming beer. The drinkability is good as I would definately have a few of these if I could."
"O- It was thoroughly drinkable. This was my first Oatmeal Stout. Quite a good introduction to the genre."
"M/D: Average mouthfeel not watery and not thick, didn't dry out the mouth. Is not the best drinkable beer a decent session beer though."
"Reddish brown in color. Thick tan head that retains itself well and leaves some nice lacing. Aroma is very very roasty with notes of coffee and nuts. There's also some sweet chocolate. Taste is similarly roasty. Lots of coffee with a little fruitiness. Very malt-dominated and chewy. Hard to tell if the mild bitterness in the finish is from hops or roasted malt. Mouthfeel is extremely creamy and velvety, but with enough warmth becomes a bit watery. A very tasty oatmeal stout, and one of SS's best beers."
"Easy to drink, good thing the ABV is 5%, otherwise you could get into big trouble with this one."
"This has been one of my favorite beers for a long, long time. Great looking, it's dark brown with a strong off-white head. Subtle aromas of chocolate and oatmeal and sweet malt. Taste is consistent with the aroma, only more definite. Sweet aftertaste is pleasant, not overpowering. This beer has texture unlike anything else - very smooth, rich and creamy. A most agreeable drinking experience."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Bottle: Pours with a nice tan, creamy head and a black body. Fine lacing. Aroma of roasted malt. The flavour is rather sweet with a taste of dark malt, notes of black coffee and chocolate. Medium to full bodied. Smooth and light bitter finish. A top beer in this style and very enjoyable too."
"Beer pours a deep dark brown with the faintest of ruby highlights when held to light. Large fluffy mocha head sticks around forever and laces the glass all the way down. Smells of molasses, oatmeal and a hint of chocolate. Taste is filled with caramel, molasses, chocolate, a bit of dark fruit. Finishes kind of dry with a lingering subtle roast bitterness. Mouthfeel is just short of creamy, medium body and carbonation. I actually think I like this a bit less than the first time I reviewed this. Its a decent enough beer, but nothing special. Maybe I just enjoy the less subtle American version of everything. My score reflects the first time I tried this."
"I could drink these all day without a problem."
"Overall this beer was excellent, I prefer the belgian style ales but this stuff was damn good. Thumbs up."
"D- One to enjoy, quite expensive for this four pack of ""victorian bottles"". But I should say well worth it."
"D - Fantastic rich brew that would go dowm great anytime."
"HV"
"Poured almost black from bottle, but head didn't last too long. Slight chocolate and coffee ground aroma. Litle thin in the body, but I was comparing it with another stout on tap, poured through a creamer. Easy to drink. No lingering malt bitterness"
"I definatley recommend that every stout fan try at least one of these!"
"D - This one will be drank quickly. Must check out their other beers. Very pleasantly surprised!"
"Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout is a great beer... I only buy it a couple time per year.. not my favorite style but this is a pretty good benchmark."
"This is a very easy to drink oatmeal stout for anytime.."
"D- Very drinkable stout. This stuff certaily suited my enviornment at the time. I enjoyed the blance and sweetness of the stout."
"This is a pretty drinkable beer if you're into stouts. It has a great, complex taste. Like most stouts though, it does weigh you down after awhile."
"me happy. i bought a four pack to try and it was gone fast. i definitely will be buying more."
"D - Very drinkable oatmeal stout. Not too dry or too bitter. Nice blend of flavors. No single flavor or aroma overpowers in this brew. Very robust and flavorful."
"Drinkability - A very good stout. Very easy to drink, very smooth."
"D: I don't know if I could drink 10 or 12 of these in one night, all though I sure am willing (and wanting) to try; But this was delicious. A Meal in a Glass!!!"
"just 5% abv?! i wish i had another!"
"D- one of the first oatmeal stouts I ever drank years ago, definitely still one of my favorites. Easily drinkable for someone looking for something in between a dry irish stout and a sweet chocolate stout."
"Black, with a good tan head atop. Smell is slightly sweet, and hearty oatiness. Light sweet almost caramel like flavor with oat and high carbonation from the bottle initially, but which reduced drastically after sitting out for 15 minutes. A really flavorful, smooth, easy to drink oatmeal stout with more umph to it that Young's milder flavored version of the Oatmeal Stout."
"Pretty drinkable beer. Tasty with a great feel."
"D: I love these, I could drink them slowly all evening."
"This wasn't as thick and full as I was expecting it to be more, but rather smooth and easy-going. I would definitely look to try more of this and recommend it to others."
"d: really simple but very well-balanced; a solid beer; what to expect from sammy smith"
"The mouthfeel does much to make this perfectly drinkable, holding the carbonation in delicate balance with the fairly sweet, smooth, creamy texture. I find that I rarely have two of these back-to-back, usually buying just one at a time to savor. Yet enjoying two or three of these in succession would be a cinch. It's the easiest stout to drink there is, malted milk masquerading as stout. A gem."
"Very filling; a meal in a bottle."
"Drinkability: Very good oatmeal stout. This beer is very balanced and very smooth. Definitely a good, traditional example of the style. Highly recommended."
"It took a long time for me to finally give this beer a try. The packaging just didn't look appealing. The beer started off great but the more I had the less enamored I became. One of these is enough to satisfy my appetite. I like the low ABV but a full bodied beer like this would match up better with more alcohol since you won't be drinking much of this beer."
"This is one of the best stouts in the world and worthy of tasting in a flight of the world's best."
"This is a great beer, especially for the winter. I imagine myself at a British pub enjoying this. Tastes like a classic English beer. Very heavy... it's like a meal in a glass."
"Exceptionally drinkable; after a disappointing experience with SS Taddy Porter, the Oatmeal Stout is a welcome follow-up. I can't wait to find some more bottles of this..."
"Pours a deep amber/ black color with a tan head. In the aroma, sweet oatmeal and a roasty maltiness. In the taste, just like the aroma, sweet oatmeal, and a roasty malt. A small bite and a decently big roasty maltiness in the mouthfeel, and a dry maltiness in the aftertaste. One of the beers that changed me into what I am today, however thank God for the brown bottles finally."
"D: Easy drinker, quite robust. The lighter ABV & consistency makes it a sure second."
"Pours a deep black color with a half inch frothy head. Smells sweet with roasted malt aromas with a hint of some fruit aroma. Goes down pretty smooth, but is surprisingly carbonated and there's a little bitterness in the aftertaste. The taste is that of roasted malts and too complex, but still pleasing. This is a slightly about average Oatmeal Stout. If you were to use an Oatmeal Stout as a session bear, this would be the one."
"Notes: Not my favorite but I had different expectations for the style. OK beer."
"D - Highly enjoyable, 1 20oz bottle was just perfect for a nightcap. Not a session beer but definitely worth revisiting, highly recommended."
"Poured this from a brown 12 oz brown bottle with trademark gold foil. Pitch black with tinges of ruby where very little light shines through. Two-finger khaki head that takes a while to get settled down. Solid lacing. Smell is both sweet and roasted. Toffee, caramel, coffee, oats. Very well done. Quite complex and a joy to breathe in. Taste is good, but it isn't nearly up to par with the delicious smell. A bit acidic in character. Slightly sour towards the end. Medium body and light carbonation. Not bad at all. My first experience in the genre of oatmeal stout. I must try others."
"D- Low alcohol makes it drinkable, but it isn't my taste to have more than one."
"Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout pours black with a generous tan head. The smell is a combination of sweetness, dark fruit, chocolate, and a touch of coffee. The taste is a wonderful combination of the above listed flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly coating with light carbonation. A pleasant aftertaste of coffee and a tinge of alcohol. This is an excellent oatmeal stout - pick it up if you see it."
"Pours very dark with a thin tan head. Nice even lacing all the way down that lightly coats the sides of your glass with a fine oily film. Pleasant chocolaty smell. Tastes of chocolate, oats, light coffee. Lightly carbonated. This is about as perfect as a stout can get, which is no surprise considering the perfect Imperial Stout made they also brew."
"D: This is an outstanding oatmeal stout, and one I keep on hand at all times. It's thick and delicious, with an outstanding drinkability."
"Poured from bottle into chalice, pours jet black with off-white head, not too thick and moderate retention. Smell is muted, but has a nutty and cocoa scent to it. Taste is good. Tastes of choclate, toasted grains, some dark malt. Extremly creamy, both in taste and mouthfeel. Its hard to describe but there is an overall creamy aspect to the beer. Overall a very good beer, the low ABV makes it an easy drinker that left a great overall impression."
"Overall I highly recommend this beer. The taste is almost so complex as to be indescribable. I think it would pair nicely with a cheesecake or white meat dish."
"D - I thinks this is a good stout I expected a little more from the hype on this site its worth a try"
"A really good oatmeal stout. The only better I've had was a homebrew with fresh oats. It's easy to find in stores, it's only a few bucks, comes in 18oz, and is very tasty."
"Pours the darkest of browns. Nice red hue when held up to light. Thin tan head,with decent retention,and a nice lacing. Smell is of roasted,nutty malts. Body was thiner than I expected,with a bit of carbonation. Taste is of roasted oats, and sweet malts. Very smooth,and easy to drink."
"this beer is awesome. i really doubt a better oatmeal stout exists. it comes in a tight bottle with foil and class all over it. it pours dark brown and smells like nuts and malts. the taste is awesome and has a little bit of coffee, with some nuts, and a ton of OATS. i feel like a horse. the feel is awesome, and for a decently thick stout, it goes down smooth as hell. i'm down with the carbonation as well. great times."
"Overall, I'm pleased with my first oatmeal stout experience and will seek out others for comparison. On its own, it seemed to be well-crafted and tasty. As a stout, since the taste is not explosive, it's well-served as a good starter stout for newbies."
"Poured into my Lake Louie pint glass. A nice dark stout with lots of carbonation sprigs rising to a browning head. A nice sight when making dinner tonight. The scent of sweet roasted malt was most present. The taste followed as well with only a bit of bitterness. It went down sweet and wet with a medium body - not too heavy and not too thin. This is a nice switch from the stout of a Guiness. This is also a bit more sweet and malty than Gray's. I've not tried other stouts of this type, but I'll definitely keep at least one of these 55ozs around. I will have to compare this to Young's as well."
"Overall, very drinkable. Very sessionable and enjoyable. Not the best stout out there, but very worthy. I'm certainly glad I bought a six-pack."
"It's amazing that this beer kick started the new Oatmeal Stout trends, because there's little room for improvement here. It finishes like silk and is easy to drink."
"A nice oatmeal stout. This has a great flavor and drinkability, but it is almost to sweet for me. I still enjoyed this though, and a beer I would recommend."
"The definition of an Oatmeal Stout"
"Drinkability was ok, it seems like a pretty heavy beer so that slowed me down although it went down smooth, mix that with a heavy dinner and you'll get full quick and not be able to enjoy much more of this tasty beer..."
"D- This is a good heavy stout. It is very drinkable, and one that you could drink all night."
"D: I love it. It's cheap. I'll drink it all the time."
"D- This is a very impressive beer. I can't believe that I waited this long to try it. I can see myself enjoying this beer often- in small quantities. One or two per session would suffice for me. All around on e of the best that I have had yet."
"D = This is a fine stout. I would happily sit down for another of these and would be happy to drink them all night as well."
"Lastly, maybe I'm lucky, but I've never had a problem with ""skunked"" Samuel Smith beers, in their dark brown bottles covered with foil tops and packaged in cardboard."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Samuel Smith's beers came highly recommend from a good friend of mine, and their Oatmeal Stout and Nut Brown set the standard for their styles."
"Very drinkable, especially for a stout. Nice work. Great session beer."
"Bottle smell is of sweet malty molasses with hints of brown sugar. Pours to a brown motor oil that lets no light through. Head is dark tan. Taste is very notably malty with a prevalence of oatmeal and semi sweet chocolate with a slight but not overly roasted flavor. The mouthfeel is good with sufficient but not too much carbonation. Not much hops at all detectable. This is a very sweet brew. For my taste is needs some bitter hops for balance. This is definitely a dessert beer and would go good with (or on top of) vanilla ice cream. In my opinion I have to rate lower on drinkability due to the lack of balance and excessive sweetness. One of these is sweet enough."
"D: Goes down smooth, but too heavy in the stomach to have more than one (550 ml) in a sitting. Higher ABV would be a nice complement to the flavor experienced here."
"Taste is smooth and creamy, quite sweet coming from the roasted aspects of the beer with chocolate being more evident than from the smell, the sweetness stays with you long after drinking."
"Still surprisingly drinkable, hasnt gone too far yet. Creamy yet slightly dry, light in body yet rich in taste, although certainly not to the level of bigger, badder assed stouts. Even while passed its prime this stout still demonstrates its quality. Do not cellar this beer for any significant period of time, respect it and enjoy immediately!"
"Considering the color and smell, I was expecting more flavor and a thicker feel; however, this seems to be a reasonable drink compared to other oatmeal stouts."
"Drinkability is the only thing that didn't stand out as much as other attributes. However, it's a really good beer, and served as a good starting point for trying oatmeal stouts."
"Drinkability is OK, but that classic Sammy Smith's tang is just too much, and this generally drinks much stronger then only 5% ABV. Would make a fantastic cologne though!"
"What's the old adage that ""you can never be too rich or too smooth?"" This one definitely falls into the rich and smooth category. As Oatmeal Stouts go, they can be a bit overwhelming. Like SS's other beers, however, this one takes a lot of taste and packs it into a very drinkable package. Dark brown, with a decent head that disappeared quickly but left a nice tan lacing all the way down the glass. All malt (dark toasted grain) in the nose and the taste starts with the same ""dark roast"" taste, but balances nicely. No change as the glass warms. And no perceptible alcohol taste. Very nice. And the best part is that you could enjoy more than one in an evening. Excellent!"
"D: Very nice indeedy laddy. Blokes learned by spying on the Emerald isle to the west. Aye! drink up!!!"
" I could easily see myself drinking these all day due to the rich body yet surprisingly smooth and light finish."
"Exceptional for the style. Great beer."
"My second sample from the Samuel Smith company, and I am even more impressed with this brew than I was with the Winter Warmer, which was also great... This beer pours a dark opaque color almost completely black with a nice frothy head... The smell is of burnt dark chocolate and roasted malts... a nice, sweet aroma with an even more appealing creamy, cocoa taste that is not at all bitter... The flavor is excellent for a stout - goes down crisp and smooth with no traces of bitterness what-so-ever... This is an exceptional beer that I will definitely purchase again.. Mouthfeel is equally great and I really enjoyed downing an 18 ounce size... Definitely worth a try and certainly recommended..."
"Pours pitch black, with hints of brown if the glass is narrow enough to let light through. Cream coffee colored head. Foam settles down to stable lace across the surface. Smells sweet, oatmeal, chocolate, and smoked malt. Tastes mmm... thick oatmeal goodness. Mouthfeel is perfect, the carbonation lends supporting creaminess to the body, and doesn't get in the way. Good session/activity beer.. for shoveling snow, muching on olives and strong cheese, or sipping slowly in a old lazy-boy recliner near the fireplace."
" Interesting flavor, very drinkable for such a heavy beer. My favorite Tadcaster brew thus far."
"I'm quite impressed with this one."
"D - See taste and mouthfeel. Basically, this beer runs short of the smell and my expectations. Still, a pretty good beer..."
"D: There would be almost no reason for me not to have another of these. This is a great example of the style cramy and not too sweet."
"cool looking skinny bottle. pours black with the slightest hint of amber. has a finger and half rocky tan head that died down quickly. smells like toffee and hops. tastes like it smells with an aftertaste of coffee and a slight metallic taste. a little over carbonated(i'm not big on carbonation) with a fizzy mouthfeel that's slightly sticky. very drinkable beer especially when it's cold outside. pretty filling and overall I'd say it's a pretty good beer but it doesn't stand out to me."
"This is what stout is all about baby! Very creamy, full of body and robust in flavor. It has a dark-as-night look and a frothy head that lingers and lingers. It has a chocoIate/coffee aftertaste that will leave you wanting another sip. I have always enjoyed this brew from Samuel Smith."
"to drink quickly, then it will be gone!"
"Overall this beer is a must have if you enjoy stouts. If you are new to Oatmeal Stouts and want to try one, this is one you definitely must try. Extremely drinkable. I could finish the 4-pack right now!"
"D: Not bad. Better than Guiness (which isn't exactly the ""standard", but something that everybody has had...) but I could do with a bit more flavor. Don't just love the burnt aftertaste. Still, an easy to drink beer that got better as the glass got less full."
"Well I've been putting this one off too long. This six pack of 12 ouncers has been sitting in my basement for at least three years now and that's how long it's been since I had what was always one of my favorites (just got caught up in variety lately). So I was curious if this fine brew would hold up at all. It did pretty well. A very dark mahogany/black with a medium tan head and a super Guiness-like lace that wouldn't quit. The aroma is a fine mix of raisin, fig, coffee and smoke. The taste brings all that and more in a somewhat acqueous, lightly carbonated classic. It is somewhat winelike which I don't so much recall so it may be due to the unusual incubation period! I also pick up some roasted nuts and it's a bit more smokey. Very smooth with a nice coffee bitterness. Surpisingly drinkable but not really something I would want to drink too generously. Even after brutal storage this brew pleases. Always recommended to those who favor some character to their beer. Can't wait to have a fresh one now!"
"This is one damn fine beer. This is exactly what I was expecting and looking for from this beer. I don't know if I like it as well as the Samuel Smith Imperial Stout, but that by no means is a knock on this beer at all. This is a highly recommended beer that should be readily available to most folks out there."
"I've seen this just about everywhere that has craft beers, so you have no excuse for having never tried it!"
"This beer has a massive flavor that, honestly, was just too much for me. Full of chocolate and coffee overtones, it finises with a licorice flavor that lingered just a little too long for me. Color is that of used motor oil, and the thick palate actually left behind a film that precluded any refreshment. I just didnt enjoy this."
"Initially the beer is sweet and ends with a light bitter taste. Flavours of caramel maltiness and light hoppiness are the predominant taste. Mouthfill was creamy. Very good beer."
"One of my favorite all-time beers. And also very good for breakfast."
"One of these was enough, as it is in a 550 ml bottle, but it was very easy to drink the whole thing, and rather quickly at that. i will certainly go back to this one again and again."
"Very smooth beer. Pours dark and is amber when shining through a light. The head is tan or brown and is large and lingering which is suprising given it has oats. Smells exactly as it tastes. Make sure you drink this at the right temperature. When I let the glass warm up I got a taste of toffee and Caramel up front with some roasted coffee and dark chocolate in the finish. Smoothness from the oats is evident in the mouthfeel. Definitely a sipping beer."
"Pours black with a big tan head. Aroma is like sweet chocolate. There are some light roasted notes and herbal hop notes in the nose as well. Taste is sweet dark malt with a little roasted malt bitterness. Chocolate. Light herbal hops. Substantial mouthfeel but not too heavy. Very drinkable. Great beer overall."
"Drinkability- Believe the hype, meal in a bottle. One is more than enough but its so good!"
"D - I really enjoyed this beer, it was very smooth without being syrupy. Not so strong that it would overpower robust foods. Even those that don't like stouts might find this one approachable."
"I would go out of my way to stock up on this brew. It is as close to brew perfection as I've ever been. The only brew I love as much is Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale."
"Overall: I was surprised by this beer. I was expecting more of a stout and more malt than was here. I like it better this way, so this is good. I recommend this beer, it was better than I thought it would be."
"My first trip into the Samuel Smiths line and it was very acceptable. Would almost make you want to get pregnant and become a lactating mother, well maybe that is going too far, but this one is good."
"D- Very drinkable, no taste too overpowering, and it finishes clean."
"Would give your left arm to be able to brew a batch this good! Next time you see it grab it and taste an old and still great beer."
"Pours a dark black color with a nice ample, brown head. Aroma is strong and malty like a stout. Taste has oatmeal upfront and finishes with a coffee aftertaste that's very smooth. Very subtle and yet delicious. While not as strong in flavor as other oatmeal stouts I've had, I still believe this would make a great introduction to the style (Oatmeal Stout)."
"Overall, a very good beer. One of the first I've had where I enjoyed the English hops. Well made and easy to drink, and worth keeping around."
"D: Great intro stout. Easy to drink, but still that ""meal in a bottle"" feel that I love about stouts. Nice flavors, nice cult status, great beer."
"d - nice sipper and one i can have a few of on a cold night."
"Overall, this is a great beer, a classic, and the only stoudt beer that I can think of that comes in a clear bottle."
"so smooth. and oaty. sweet. it's almost tough to describe, actually, but so...good. not quite chocolate or cocoa (there is a little hop flavor in there, by the way)"
"Very nice beer, a good entry level stout for those scared of the dark beers."
"D - Good beer for a cooler night, and could drink a few of these. Not a seesionable stout, but certianly very nice."
"D- I was amazed by this, I am almost speechless. This makes me want to go back and revisit their Imperial Stout. The best oatmeal stout I have come across. I could drink this all night."
"When i saw this beer on a bottle list at a bar, the bartender was shocked i ordered it, and in reply i told him i love trying new beer...but as uncommon as my order was my review will be quite common i think...It was a dark almost espresso like color, and had a mouth feel very similar to such. It did have a chocolate and coffee taste about it, almost like a milk stout. It was definately heavier than most of my choices but an excellent one at best. It tasted great and I would definately have it again..."
"1pint 2.7floz bottle. Pours very dark brown to black and a very thick, large, creamy tan head that took a while to drop. Nose is nutty, chocolate, very coffee semlling, a good smell. Taste is very rich, chocolate malt, coffee, nice and stout. This is my first Samuel Smith's Oatmeal and I have to say it is the best Oatmeal Stout I have had. Sweet and hoppy finish. A delicious brew. I'm going to have to buy more of these!"
"D- Drinkability is good. Kind of too sweet to me for a session beer, but one or two of these are good for the soul. One of my first stouts, so I definitely will be going back for more!"
"D: Very tasty brew. Calling my Mother and asking her to make a cherry pie for Christmas :D"
"Poured this into a pint glass. Poured out a black color with a thick 2-finger tan head, that went away quickly. There was a mocha and chocolate taste with the oatmeal taste. The mouth feel was light, but suprisingly didn't coat my mouth like i expected. The drinkability of this is quite good. I could session this beer frequently and enjoy it everytime. Definatly looking to try more stouts after this."
"After pouring this stout, the head settled down to almost nothing, not the slight creamy head I was looking for. It was a dark stouty color with not an over whelming amount of odor. There was slight hints of oatmeal and maybe some chocolate in the smell. Mouthfeel was milky and smooth, probably the beers strong point. I didn't encounter anything special in the way of taste, a sweet stout with a little oatmeal and coffee hints but nothing that really jumps out at you. To me, it didnt drink like a stout, too light and not very robust. A smooth beer that goes down easy and drinks easy, but not exactly what I'm looking for in a stout."
"My first oatmeal stout. It pours almost black, with a perfect tan, to dark tan head. Smell was not as strong as I thought it would be, but hints of chocolate and mocha. Taste of this beer is wonderful. Sweet milk chocolate, and hints of coffee, then followed by the slightest hint of dark chocolate. Mouthfeel was good, very creamy. Overall drinkability was good, however it would be hard to have more then a few of these at a time."
"D: A great drinkable lighter stout. When I first had this beer on my 21st birthday it really stood out from the other drinks I had on that day, and almost 2 years later it still stands up. One of the best all-around stouts that I have ever had, certainly a joy to drink."
"D - I wouldn't suggest trying to knock back a couple of these right after a meal..as this could be used as a meal itself..very filling..low ABV so it sessions well..as far as the taste goes..each sip is inviting and the brew is begging you to go for another taste"
"I was delighted when I came upon this stout in a little hole-in-the-wall place that had NO redeeming qualities except for keeping this and several other Sam Smith's in stock. People, this is a very nice drink. It pours very dark (not black) and has a pretty thick, tan head that disappears after a few minutes. The smell is nice, lightly sweet and not overwhelming. The taste is similar- you notice caramel (or something that tastes like it) but its not sugary. The taste itself isn't heavy- its hearty and complex, it almost tastes like it should be good for you in a whole-grain kind of way. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected from a stout, but pleasant. It's a heavy, meal-like drink; maybe you could have 2 in one sitting if you ate light beforehand. Overall, if you should find this one, you really need to try it."
" The body is really the main draw here. The oatmeal lends a silky texture that is just sublime and fits the palate perfectly. This also renders the beer very easy to drink, ensuring that a solo drinker can handle the entire large bottle. A top notch stout from one of the world's great breweries."
"Dark, rich, expertly balanced, and savory. Very approachable. American brewers take this ball and run with it, accentuating some of the subtle notes in this enjoyable brew, such as the patent malts, with their flinty and almost ashy flavor. Some Americans also push the oats and flaked barley, making for a more full, slick mouthfeel. But if you're looking for a traditional, consistent oatmeal stout, this is one to admire."
"Pours nice from the bottle with a fair amount of head, even if it's not as much as I'm used to seeing from a stout. Nice dark tones, but again not as dark as I'm used to seeing in a stout. It has a slight stout aroma, but nothing as strong as I'm used to seeing from a stout, just a hint of bitters and a very, very slight waft of oatmeal. It does go down smooth, it's texture being its best quality in my opinion. It has a nice stout flavor, but there is not one flavor that really comes out, making it a mild stout."
"Another good one from Sam Smith's. I have nothing bad to say about Sam Smith's except their beer, although outstanding, is way overpriced. This one pours a nice creamy head. Body is medium/heavy. Interesting taste. Very buttery and filling. Nice hoppy notes on the back. Smells decent, of some almonds and oatmeal. A very nice brew I would session out on if it were a little more resonably priced."
"Would drink again especially for the price"
"Drinkability was exceptional but I refused it an exceptional grade due to its over-drinkability. I could have used something that cure my hunger in a half-pint. Bring on a case of this and I'll still need stout quenching."
"--I will being writing a review of the Young's Oatmeal stout to see how they compare but I'm not sure if it can top this fine drink. A great stout and I look forward to trying some of the other Samuel Smith's beers tonight and tomorrow. Cheers"
"This is a good beer. Dark in color - completely black with light behind it. Head was about a finger-width upon pouring at about 40F. May have been a little cold for this beer. Head dropped to a nice lace in about 3 minutes. The smell is a little harder to pick up than some stouts, but it has a nice roasted aroma. Upon tasting, I found that it has a strong roasted grain flavor with bitter and alcoholic undertones. The alcohol does not stand out, and you have to search for it to find the taste. This drinks very well, better than Guinness in my opinion. The mouthfeel is thick and coating, which is expected of this style."
"This just might be my favorite beer. My only tasting came during a party in which I tasted a few beers for the first time but this one has stayed in my mind as the best of the night and I don't recall ever tasting a beer that I enjoyed as much as this one."
"Pour an almost-opaque mahogany from a 550ml bottle. The thick, tan, foamy head leaves tight lacing. Red highlights when held up to the light. Smells like espresso, sweet malt and dark chocolate with some raisiny scents. Taste is like coffee and toffee with some alcohol in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, more so as it warms. Another great beer from Samuel Smith."
"Poured from a 550ml clear bottle into a pint glass. It was pitch black even against a light. I gave a hard pour so it had a massive light brown head. It slowly settled into a constant foam with some lacing. The aroma was roasted and chocolate malts with a sweetness in the background. It was weaker than I remember so might need to rereview later. The taste was great. Nutty and chocolately. Very smooth from start to finish. Almost session beer smooth. The taste won't blow you away but you find yourself drinking it down and going back for more so I bumped the drinkability to reflect that. Mouthfeel was good but wanted a little creamier. It was just a little watery. Overall, an excellent brew that I highly recommend. This one has a home in the semi regular rotation. (4.5, RR, T, Y)"
"D - Excellent. Eminently quaffable. At five percent ABV, this has session written all over it."
"Drinkability is tough. I can understand why some people do not like to have several heavy beers in a night. If you feel this way you might have this oatmeal's stout drinkability lower. I feel that I can have several heavy beers (this beer surely counts) in a night."
"Taste: Wow this is one smoooth beer. Hits the tongue with an almost velvety texture with little carbonation. Immediately the tastebuds are bombarded with sweet malts, tasting of dark chocolates and milky coffee. There is a cola note in there, and that taste lingers in the finish. Very pleasant. Very heavy."
"You really can't go wrong with this one. Head of the house when it comes to the oatmeal stout."
"Really, this beer is virtually a side dish. I love it. One of the best oatmeal stouts out there."
"Almost black in color with a foamy tan head. Very smooth and full-flavored. Enjoyed this immensely. Aroma is of chocolate and caramel. Flavor is chocolate, caramel, mildly sweet and malty. Finishes very clean and crisp. Drinkability is good for a stout."
"Drinkability: I like stout. This is a really good stout. Mild, smooth and creamy. I could have several of these in a sitting."
"Pours a dark black color with a thick and bubbly tan head that is initially 2 inches tall. After a few minutes the head disappears to leave small carbonation bubbles along the top with lacing that sticks around. The aroma is of sweet malts. Taste is so smooth and sweet. The oats really bring out such a smooth textured beer that is really drinkable."
"Drinkability is high, because it's so smooth and balanced. I approve."
"Overall: A great beer, very rich and flavorful while being incredibly drinkable. ( Would make a great car bomb, there i said it). Awesome with some hot wings or barbecue and also does really well with some desserts."
"All in all a very good oatmeal stout."
"Drinkability- Oddly for a stout, very drinkable. I find myself regretting that I didn't buy the full 4-pack and only buying a single, but lucky for me, it is one of the most obtainable. I will be reaching for this instead of the only more accessible oatmeal stout."
"It's not a bad stout so I rated drinkability slightly higher but since I specifically tried it after seeing the 90 it scored here I was left scratching my head on this one."
"This is easily one of my favorite beers, and is a good one to sit back and sip when you're in a lazy mood and just want to relax. I've introduced it to quite a few folks who enjoy their beer on the stouter and more complex side, and I've yet to hear a complaint. As good as all of the Samuel Smith brews are, this one sits alone at the top IMHO."
"Poured a handsome, dark brown-black color with a 2-finger toffee-colored head that slowly faded down. Smells of oatmeal and dark roasted malts. Tasted like the smell: delicious roasted malt and burnt coffee flavors, with an aftertaste that was a mix of sweet oatmeal and a touch of bitterness. I started drinking this beer fairly cold, but the flavors really came out once it warmed up a bit, especially the oatmeal. Mouthfeels was heavy and smooth, with little carbonation. I enjoyed this beer very much."
"Pours deep brown. Nice head, dissipates slowly, keeps a rim. Smells nicely of roasted malt, definitely smells like a stout. Very smooth mouthfeel, slightly bitter-sweet aftertaste. Light stout with respect to mouthfeel but maintains a full taste. Very very drinkable, excellent brew."
"The taste follows the nose to a T. A big abundance of roasted malt with some sweet tones followed by a nice oatmeal flavour and lesser notes of anise and citrus tang. Wow, the mix of flavours really work well together and *force* me to take sip after sip. Very drinkable and it makes for an *excellent* session brew. I could drink this one all night long. The carbonation is medium light and the mouthfeel is silky smooth. I can't believe that I haven't reviewed this before as it's simply an outstanding example of the style and is easy on the wallet. Highly recommended!!"
"A well-crafted stout, and tradition is closely observed.. Great for a session, and recommended."
"D - Excellent. This is complex, but well rounded, balanced, and understated enough to be eminently quaffable. At five percent ABV, this has session written all over it."
"My first oatmeal stout and it didn't disappoint. Great looking black beer with a creamy, mother-of-pearl head. Two-finger head retention. Aroma reminded me of licorice, roasted barley and maybe a hint of chocolate. Taste was really nice; a chewy, viscosity to it, with notes of sweetness and coffee from the roasted barley. An overall earthiness was added by the oats themselves. Heavy beer which coats the palate. A great beer! Would love to savor/sip many of these."
"this brew is extremely well crafted without much room for improvement. the ONLY critique i have for this brew is that the bitterness doesn't show itself until after going down. that being said, definitely check this one out."
"This was a very solid beer; one of my favorite stouts. A very dark body with a nice tan head that holds throughout the beer. The smell caught me a little off-guard as it was slightly malty but still roasted. The taste emphasized the latter. Very roasted taste, almost smokey, as if the malt had actually been roasted over a fire. A nice, thick mouthfeel that was ok despite the summer months. Despite its thick mouthfeel, the beer is pretty easy drinking. The fact that the beer is nice and smooth is what makes it go down so easy."
"One of my favorite English beers so complex yet so downright drinkable."
"D - I could drink this for the rest of my life. It tastes so fresh and yet it shipped from so far away."
"While the ABV is only 5%, I think that the sessionability is impacted by the richness  this is a meal beer. If I were at a bar and it was on tap, I would probably go for it. I could see this beer going well with roasted meat."
"NOTE** Had this with chocolate chip cookies, onto a winner there!"
"D: Richness is the name of the game for this brew. It will put some fullness into your body, but God help me if I can't put it down."
"Very dark brown in appearance but not opaque and with slightly red hue. Head of about 1/2 inch with no staying power and virtually non-existent lacing. Smell is good with a sweet fragrance. Taste is mild with a smoky malt flavor; smoky oak with a chocolate finish. Mouthfeel is relatively light but foams up on tongue. This is a very drinkable beer but lacks a little complexity for my taste."
"Poured into a pint glass, it's black in the body and tan in the head; the latter just sits there on top. There's a hint of chocolate syrup in the smell, a subtle roasted flavor, a bit of cooked oatmeal, and cappuchino flavors. The taste is more of the same. Fairy smooth, with the bitterness at the lower end for the style, making it easy to drink. Delicious!"
"This is how you do an oatmeal stout."
"Drinkability: This is so easily quaffable I wish I had a whole keg here to myself. I want to homebrew this one and have it around all the time. One of the best session brews I've ever had."
"The pour was the best thing about this beer. Looked dark and creamy with a nice head. It smells like chocolate, coffee, smoke, and some sweetness. The taste wasn't quite what I was expecting. It tasted mainly of sweet smokey coffee with the smoke standing out the most, then a watery finish. The beer was somewhat smooth going down physically but the flavor was just over powered by smoke. The mouth feel was more medium bodied. The flavor is there but the beer just seems too watered down. Most of Sam Smith beers have this characteristic to me. This would be a good beer to cook with, but I'd pass on another chance to drink one."

"A creamy smooth mouthfeel has a great clean finish. As far a drinkability is concerned I could drink this beer for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and because it's not overly strong nature I would say that's not out of the question. One of my all time favorites."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours very dark brown with a small tan head. The aroma is caramel, toffee, chocolate, coffee and grain (oats). It tastes like coffee, bittersweet chocolate, caramel and roasted malt, very nice. Gets even better as it warms up some. Mouthfeel is medium, smooth and a bit creamy. Drinkability is very good as I could drink these all night long, it's very sessionable. Overall I think this is a pretty good oatmeal stout, I'd recommend it to anyone to try."
"This is a great beer, and aside from some dryness as an aftertaste, is a very good beer. its very hearty and very smooth. enjoyable brew, not an every day beer for me, but good regardless"
"Overall, a great straightforward rewarding oatmeal stout that tastes great."
"I purchased this brew with high expections and was left very disappointed. Poured a nice dark brown with a 2 inch light brown head. However, that was the nice part. The aroma was a stale coffee and strange scent of perfume. The taste was a long acidic and of sour milk maybe astringent. I tend to drink want I start but not this time. Maybe I purchased a bad brew but, I do not think I'll be buying another one."
"This beer is worth drinking again if offered by a friend, but, would hesitate paying for the beer myself...over-rated."
"Recommended. Samuel Smith continues to live up to its good name."
"It is no mystery why this beer is one of the best, and not just for the style."
"This is a classic stout. Very, very good"
"The metallic and acidic properties of an Oatmeal Stout are a little strange at first, but they tend to fade quickly as roasty and toasty flavors peak as it warms. This is a remarkable brew and probably one of the best examples of the style that I have had the pleasure of drinking."
"Definitve molasses aroma with light hoppiness. Somehow they squeezed an oak tast into this doughy malt. Certainly, too fizzy for my taste, then I see it is artificial. The head, as an arificial one would, dies almost instantly. The carbonation is lively, to the point of overbearing. It has a slight alcoholic taste to it, and the oatmeal taste never fully comes out, as it does with some others Ive had. Overall, I wouldnt turn it aay, but wouldnt seek it out either."
"As drinkable as a stout can be never get tired of these beer, one of my favorites. My favorite beer from Samuel Smith. A must try beer!"
"D - tasty, very tasty. this beer makes good company with their taddy porter, and nut brown ale."
"Drinkability: A nice, light, sweet stout fit for any time of day, including 8:30 in the morning!"
"drinkable?? yes, glad I finally get to taste a not ruined example of the beer, it does have a bit of a malty thickness that bulilds that may slow down a dehydrated drinker."
"D: It's smooth and sweet finish makes this beer easy to drink for a long time."
"Taste is alot like the aroma leads on, with flavors ranging from caramel malts to some nut and oat notes. A chocolatey aftertaste ends the full-bodied, smooth mouthfeel. It's almost chalky; very milk-like with carbonation levels on the lighter side. Bottom line: a smooth, tasty, and complex brew...definately a great, well-rounded beer."
"Dark black pour, with a full thick creamy head, that slowly reduces down to about a finger and a half thick. Smells of sweeter, a subtle hint of apple, slightly yeasty , and a touch of booze. Taste starts of mildly sweet, fading to a bitter charcoal finish. Very low on carbonation ratio, very good for a stout, in my opinion, It is very full brew, just like an oatmeal stout should be and It is very drinkable. This is a great one to try."
"Full mouth-feel, very smooth. Extremely drinkable  not super-filling, but big enough to feel like you got your days worth of protein. Good lunchtime beer."
"Now I can say I've had it and I enjoyed it enough to know I can fall back on it if I ever find myself with a limited selection. This almost always seems to be available."
"550 ml brown bottle with a gold foil wrapper covering the neck and cap. Pours a deep mahogany black with some burnt orange highlights. Rich, creamy offwhite head with some sticky lacing. Smells sweet with some coffee notes and roasted malt in the background. The taste is similar, smooth creamy lightly roasted maltiness with notes of caramel, dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and sherry. Black velvet in a bottle. An exceptional stout!"
"amazing! this was really really solid. poured a nice black with brown hues in the light. really nice looking. aroma has notes of chocolate fruitiness. the taste is very smooth, kind of like roasted coffee meets butterscotch. awesome. very drinkable, very light. yet very full in flavor. definitly one of the best beers i've had in my life. thank you kate! i love you."
"A really great beer. Went well with the pizza, well suited for the social situation. Very much a beer that I could drink very often, a great meal beer. I picked this beer about a year back and it seemed different, perhaps my tastes have changed. Went back to it simply to try it again. Good choice. Definately tasted the oatmeal. A bit pricey, but worth it."
"Drinkability: Extremely high. This is just a nice brew to drink. The flavors are well balanced and do not overpower you."
"Brilliant."
"D: A very soft stout that has a wonderful sweetness about it. Rich malts and fantasic balance will keep you coming back for more."
"I bought it this weekend because of the brown bottle. Yeah! My beer is back. A bit sweeter than I remember but still worth searching out! I'm happy to be able to enjoy this fine beer again without worrying about light damage! Thank you Mr. Smith (pun intended)"
"this is a perfect english representation of the style. i fully enjoy it when i can though it is a bit pricey and i do not understand the clear glass bottle. all the beers from this brewery are great. usually found in 4 paks or the larger bottle shown"
"D - Overall, this is a great, easy to drink stout. It is, and will continue to be, one of my favorites"
"i've had this beer countless times, and it always leaves a sour aftertaste in my mouth once the beer is gone. not a big deal if you're having another, or if you have some water handy. never the less, though, this is a classic, and with good reason."
"Dark rich in color with a light tan head that relaxes into a thin foam layer. smell of roasted malts with a slight note of coffee. Dark chocolate, coffee in flavor. Mouthfeel is full bodied. Lighter than what I expected, the smooth carbonation makes this beer easily drinkable. Solid, well build but not overfilling."
"Drinkability - My goodness, this is an outstanding Stout!! Very well balanced and smooth. Very easy to down several of these in one sitting. This could be my favorate stout, however I will reserve that until I taste one of these on tap."
"Poured dark brown with a big sturdy tan head that left medium lacing as I drained the glass. A lot of rich grains in the nose. Taste was very smooth and creamy up front, with a wallop of bittersweet chocolate at the end. Well balanced and pleasing. A terrific stout."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with copper and ruby accents. Thin lacing and head. The aroma is very good, and the taste is even better. It is definately a beer you need to try if you haven't already. It's a bit pricey but it is well worth it. This is better than a ""good call", anyone who likes more than American domestic macro crap will love this."
"Very good and velvety oatmeal stout. Pours a black with a tan foamy head. Smelled of dark chocolate and raisins. Tasted of dark chocolate and coffee. No alcohol and a dry finish. Very smooth on the mouth but a little watery. Very drinkable. Wanted to kill of two or three at one time but decided against it."
"This beer pours an almost opaque dark brown with ruby accents. Has a good rich thick head with no effort with the pour, and moderate lacing. Essences are of caramel/coffee/malts.Taste is a very smooth mixture of malts/fruits, maybe figs/dates with hints of coffee. Excellent mouthfeel, big and creamy. Moderate hops lend to a dry finish that is quite quick and clean for a stout. All said, this is a very well crafted oatmeal stout!"
"Completely black, tab head, slight lacing, with an intoxicating smell. Very deep tofee, chocolate smell with an almost coniac scent mixed in.(maybe it's just me). A great beer from an old brewery. What would you expect?"
"Pours black with some burnt orange highlights and a creamy offwhite head that sticks around and leaves some spotty lacing. Smells sweet and creamy with vanilla and slightly roasty notes in the background. The taste is similar, with a smooth creamy lightly roasted maltiness that is very smooth and has notes of chocolate, vanilla, and sherry. Silky smooth mouthfeel with a slightly sour finish from the grain. Quite drinkable, with its low abv and tasty creaminess, this one is a quaffer."
"Quite full bodied with a velvety smooth feel. This one would make a terrific night cap or dessert beer, if you will."
"A style I love, and a brewery I want to enjoy - but for English Oatmeal Stouts I'm sticking with Young's. This one keeps me batting close to .000 on Samuel Smith in bottles."
"There's something a bit out of the ordinary with this beer (when compared to other stouts) but it is good! It has a somewhat cool and subdued flavor, but it works well. Not an everyday type of beer, but one that I'll surely have again."
"D - The best stout I've had since I started keeping track; I read this this is Samuel Smith's flagship, and it makes sense why; it's got great flavor but is light enough for you to keep coming back for more"
"Notes: This is a great stout. One of the best I have ever had. I know this review doesnt do the beer justice. It is complex, interesting but also flat out enjoyable. The benchmark for the style."
"with this and other SS beers my advice is only by at high volume beer specialty stores... otherwise you could get a stale bottle which leads to less carb and more wineyness....and a hangover... so be careful... freshness is important with this choice."
"Pours a big forhty head that doesn't fall very fast and leaves a great lacing behind. The color is black a looks very smooth. The smell is coffee and a big chocolately taste that is very nice. The taste is even smoother with a big sweet/coffee taste. It's very smooth and velvetty. Overall I love this beer and would have some more."
"Like a hug in a bottle. Complex taste centered around creamy darkness. Definitely not bad, this one."
"Poured as near black as you can get, with a modest tan head that left some spot lacing. The smell is a bit faint but has a coffee syrup aroma. The taste of the oatmeal stout is not as pronounced as Smith's Imperial. It has a subtle roasted flavor, bit semi-sweet chocolate. The mouthfeel is as smooth as it gets, velvety. This is probably the most drinkable stout that I have had. It is very balanced and smooth, a tad bitter a tad sweet. I very much like this style however the taste doesn't blow me away."
"Taste is roasted and burned with that oiliness from the oatmeal. A good maltbitter and hopbitter balances the dark taste. There are some smokey elements and the yeast gives the beer it's distinct profile, which is hard to describe, but if I do, it would be earthy and charcoal. Body is medium and yes, this stuff is mild and highly drinkable. I could drink this all night."
"Drinakbility - 4"
"Ah, the taste of England. I'm not fond of the traditional rubbery, diacetyl-soaked English Ale, but this is a nice little awkward beer. If I had to drink English, it would be Sam Smith, although I prefer some of their other beers. The Impy Stout is much much better."
"Final Statement: Lived up to the hype. The jury is out on which is better, this or St. Ambroise, but Sam Smith's put together a real winner here. I only wish it were available here on a regular basis."
"Pours dark black, if there is such a color. Big creamy beige head holds very well. Beautiful in my pint glass. I don't know why but dark beers just look more like beer should to me. Smells sweet, slightly sugary with some coffee undertones. Not too much on the nose, but enough to be enticing. Tastes excellent, semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, very nutty and earthy. Leaves me with a good memory of every last sip. Highly drinkable, as far as stouts go. Thoroughly enjoyed."
"Drinkability- Very nice. Probably the brest mass-produced oatmeal stout in the world."
"Reminds me of a parking lot in a time long ago.... This beer drinks sweet and smooth. Even after all this time, still a world class stout."
"I loved this beer, I may be willing to say this could now be my favorite as of right now. I will be keeping a few pints of this on hand at all times for any and all occassions. I even got my dad to give it a try and he isn't much for stouts and he says that it's one of the most flavorful and delicious beers he's ever tasted. Drinkability? This beer is the epitome of drinkable. I love it!"
"overall - Glad to find that three years after my first (negative) review this beer is what I remember. Smokey, creamy, and flavorful without being overpowering."
"This is a beer worth saving for special occasions because it has such a splendid flavor. I recommend this oatmeal stout to all connoisseurs of stouts and porters."
"Poured from a 550mL bottle into a pint glass. Huge frothy beige head that stood two fingers high at it's peak slowly falls away to moderate glass-coating lace and a thin coat of film on top. Smells are roasted dark coffee and chocolate, malts, sweet caramel and toffee notes. Also a slight earthen grainy character present. Taste is sweet and roasty, chocolate and espresso flavors abound, finishes on a slightly bitter roasty flavor with a dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, medium to full bodied with lower levels of carbonation makes this one just silken-smooth. Drinkability is also great, very enjoyable stout characteristics and roasty complexity coupled with the low abv% make this an easy to enjoy oatmeal stout. Highly recommend and will seek out again."
"Poured the large bottle to an oversized pint glass. Pours black with a very small brown head that fades quickly. Light does come through, not pitch black. Smells of oatmeal cookies and molasses. Tastes somewhat sweet with good molasses hints and some coffee and bitter tones. Goes down very smooth. One of my favorite oatmeal stouts all of a sudden... Very good, I highly recommend."
"This beer pours very dark black but not completely opaque when it is held up to a light. The head is dark tan and is thin to begin with and doesn't lace much. The smell is chocolate malt, dark fruit, molasses and oatmeal. The taste is much like the smell with a bit of acidity coming through. The mouthfeel is nice and full with a good level of carbonation and a plesent coating feeling the beer fills the mouth well. This is a very drinkable stout something you could have a few of in a sitting with feeling bogged down or overwhelmed or something that you could have every day without getting tired of."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle a dark brown with a small layer of foam that dissipated rather quickly leaving very little lacing. Smells a bit skunky with some burnt malt.(hope I didn't get the clear bottle blues) Taste of oatmeal and a burnt malt and hop bitterness. Feels light/medium and a little creamy in the mouth. I have had this beer a few times and I remember it tasting a lot more richer and creamier. I think this one might be a little light damaged and I'll try it again and adjust my review in the near future."
"A very delicious and well balanced stout. What I liked most is that the aftertaste didn't completely pollute my mouth after a bottle of this beer."
"Beer is extremely dark, almost black. When held to light shades of crimson shine through, while the head is a thick coffee color. Smell is extremely complex, with the expected oatmeal, yeast, and even a coffelike aroma shining through. Taste is the same, strong and bitter, in a good way. Mouthfeel is amazing, goes down extremely smooth for such a heavy beer. Drinkability is likewise surprisingly high. I would certainly recommend this one, and look forward to trying it again."
"D: If I was a millionaire, my fridge would always be filled with Samual Smith Oatmeal Stout. It is great as a session beer, or for just sitting back and enjoying its many complexities. This beer defines the style of oatmeal stout and deserves all of the respect it is given."
"Some definite acidity and more of a carbonation bite. More of a bittering roastiness picked up here, but still quite smooth."
"D - Very good, and very easy to drink."
"This beer has a rich and smooth tight bubbled head that nicely laces the glass as it recedes. A cocoa or coffee smell hits you first when you go to take a sip. Very smooth on the palate with notes of roast?, has a slight sweetness at the beginning finishes wet with a burnt aftertaste. This 550ML bottle will be consumed quickly as it goes down soooo smooth. Would definitely recommend!!! Cheers"
"Pours a nice deep amber color that is almost black, with a tan head that goes away but leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. A very interesting aroma, hard to really pinpoint what is really there. Its a earthy, sweet smell, some chocolate and coffee tones. The taste is good, smooth in the front, with a building sweetness that ends with some chocolate bitterness and spice in the finish. A very good oatmeal stout, and another great offering from Samuel Smith's."
"There are many stouts and oatmeal stouts about, but this is hands down my favorite. The aroma, the taste, the color, it just seems perfect. I like to chill this beer just slightly, then pout it into a nice thick beer mug. I could be happy with this beer if it was the only one available forever more! I love it !!!"
"Starchy but sweet, full of flavor. Goes down easily start to finish, while remaining very complex (I can't place some of the flavor) and hearty, perfect to augment the paltry 13 degrees I'm working with tonight. Another reason to celebrate the Old Brewery."
"Overall a SUPERIOR, different, and TASTY stout. Highly recommended - especially for the holidays! Cheers!"
"Pours a deep dark brown with a nice head that lingers well. Great smell with hints of molasses with chocolate. Taste is fantastic, so smooth and well balanced. There is little to complain about here, possibly the best Oatmeal Stout around. I've had this case for a while and it just seems to get better."
"This is a great beer. So full and smooth. Great dark color with light tan head. Nice sweet roasted flavor. Feels so full and tasty in my mouth, but goes down so nice. I could drink quite a few of these if I had the money. Why can't cheap beer taste like this?"
"Dark brown color with little head. Aromas are malty with a little smoke. Very smooth in the mouth; flavors are somewhat sweet, with just a hint of bitterness. I cant detect the oat influence, but perhaps that manifests itself as sweetness. Great sweet finish, very pleasant. Very drinkable and smile-inducing stout."
"This beer will be in my home for the holidays for sure!!"
"This is the most sessionable oatmeal sout I've ever had. Try this beer."
"D: Hands down a great Oatmeal Stout from Olde England. Definitely a necessary purchase during the winter months."
"I love this beer."
"Very easy to drink for what it is."
"Black color with a thin tan head. I might have killed the head by pouring to cold but there just isn't anything there to speak of. Smell of cherries and plums gives it a real fruitiness. Milky smooth chocolate flavors appear in the taste and it finishes with a butterscotch note. I've been really turned off by butterscotch flavors in beer previously but this is just the right amount to not be overpowering. Some bitter bakers chocolate notes also come through. Very smooth beer with lots of interesting flavors. Totally enjoyable and deserving of the good reputation."
"Drink-ability: For anyone a fan of Stout beer this is a must try. Im so happy my beer store now carrys Samuel Smith."
"Drinkability: The most overrated beer on this website, and perhaps the world.This posesses all the bad qualities of Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock, but lacks the charm. Ehh."
"I bought a 12 ounze bottle from Michael's Deli in King of Prussia and poured into a pint glass. The sound it made when it poured made you believe it was thicker than it actualy was (altough it was thicker than the normal stout). It produced a good bit of head, with a decent rate of retention. The smell was very malty and sweet. The mouthfeel was a little harsh. The taste wasn't as malty as the smell was, I guess it was blended more toward taste than smell. Don't drink and review."
"Drinkability is ok. This beer is a bit heavy though, and I can't see myself drinking more than two on any one night. Still, an excellent oatmeal stout. Highly reccomended."
"I've yet to had a bad beer from Samuel Smiths."
"Best English beer I've ever had. Best stout I've ever had. About as close to a perfect beer as I can think of."
"This stout is as drinkable as they come and no sip is boring."
"Taste is smooth, sweetish, chocolaty, just really nice. Mouthfeel is rather thick, with super nice carbonation and smoothness. The only downfall on drinkability is that it's a bit heavy."
"HIGHLY drinkable. At 5.0% abv, and the robust and addictive flavors presented therein, this beer is breathtaking and you cannot get enough of it. A classic amongst classic when it comes to stouts."
"Overall: I cant believe I have never reviewed this one. It is always good, and always welcome in my house."
"Not bad, but I expected more considering the high score."
"I haven't drank many stouts before but I really enjoyed this. Poured into a pint glass. Fluffy two finger head that lasted a good 5 minutes, still a quarter inch after 10 minutes. Great aroma. Smooth mouth feel. Some coffee and chocolatey notes. Great beer to savor every drink. Definetely try this one."
"Beautiful black color, with a frothy white head. Very subtle aroma; little touch of chocolate. Taste is amazing; milky, sweet, with a chocolate-coffee characteristic, with a very faint bitterness in the aftertaste. Sugary aftertaste; amazingly drinkable beer. This is one of the classics that first introduced me to quality beer."
"Dnot bad, but not as good as I expected, I would not seek this out, but might give it another try in the future."
"D- a very drinkable beer, goes down nice and easy, a good beer, would like to try off tap"
"With the low ABV I could see this beer as a perfect session beer."
"This has always been a favorite of mine, and again I'm reminded why. After a summer chock full of hefes and pale ales, this has me really looking forward to drinking some dark beer again. If you like stouts and haven't had this, you're doing yourself a huge disservice, 'cause it's a real classic."
"Drinkabillity: I can see why this one is rated so high. I can see myself going back to this quite a bit. After a long day out in the sun, like I had today, it's perfect for sitting back and taking my mind off of things. Doesn't give me the same full feeling I get from other stounts, so I can see putting a few of them down in succession."
"D-I like it,Its my first oatmeal stout.I can see drinking this on a cold fall day.This is a ""treat"" beer as i call them.That means this couldnt be drank day in and day out,its nice to have once in a while.I would reccomend this to fellow BA's"
"Will this help lower my cholesterol?"
"Black, almost completely opaque body with just a slight ruby-red highlight, and a couple of fingers of tan head. Smells malty and chocolatey. Roasted coffee/chocolate and caramel dominate the flavor. A couple of slightly off flavors in the background, but roasted chocolate dominates them. Fairly sweet. Fairly full-bodied. Better than I remember. I am extremely impressed!"
"This is one of the best oatmeal Stouts, it never lets me down when I'm in need for a rich drinkable stout. recommended!"
"The pour into my Fuller's nonic raises a slight head, due to a light pour (I wanted the entire bottle to fit into the glass). What head it has is tan. The body is quite black, but has a lot of ruby at the edges when backlit. The nose is earthy, most likely from English hops, andquite chocolatey and roasted, too. The taste is slightly acidic, quite earthy, and finishes with light chocolate/coffee notes. I do wish it were less acidic, but it's still enjoyable. The mouth is on the fuller side, with a surprisingly high carbonation. Overall, this is an alright beer, but certainly not worth the $5 I have to pay for it."
"One of the most drinkable oatmeal stouts I have ever tasted. I enjoy the results of fermentation in slate tanks. It has the best appearance, taste, and smell of them all. I like the fact that it is not too strong, so you can have several. I enjoy that it has no cloying sweetness and a crisp aftertaste. This stout has a luxurious mouthfeel and can be counted on to deliver everytime."
"The stout pours nearly pure black, only revealing a dim brown hue when held up to the light. The massive foamy head is dark tan and was totally retained through a moderately slow drinking. I would have to say the smell has something unmistakable indicating its from Samuel Smiths Tadcaster brewery. There is something underlying all their brews that comes out in the nose here. Beyond that, there are molasses, cola, rooty, licorice and anise smells; a very complex nosefull. The taste is so smooth and round on the palate with sweet, syrupy, molasses and chocolate flavors tempered by an alcoholic warming touch and a restrained hop presence. The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and substantial. This is a dangerously drinkable beer considering its abv %."
"Drinkability - for such a rich beer, it's an easy 5 pint session. Bravo."
"Not sure why, but my reivews of BA's top 100 end up being a little low!!????"
"Cola-like body leaves flavours lingering in your mouth. A bit sticky, but the taste makes you want to keep it on your taste buds as long as possible."
"One of my all time favorites. Beautiful pour of deep brown with ruby highlights. Nice frothy head. Excellent aroma of toasted grain, mocha, fruit and on and on. Words don't do the taste justice... Flawlessly smooth and silky presence on the palate. Perfect semi sweet finish which makes this brew so completely drinkable. Bar none a marvelous creation that deserves the attention."
"Drinkability - The beer is definitely drinkable, but better beers exist as a whole and in the category. I would probably get tired of this eventually, because none of this beer's flavors have made an impact on me that would cause me to go out and get more.."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- On the palate, this is dreamy. A light, relatively thin entrance onto the tongue expands and swells into a beautiful, mouth-filling delight... full, active, yet subtle simultaneously. Effortless... a classic in its category, and worth trying and enjoying again and again."
"Pours a deep black with a nice brown head. Deep red when held to the light. Nice 1"" brown head, great lacing. Sweet malts and oats combine to smell reminiscent of caramel and chocolate... simply excellent. Mild taste, slightly of bitter hops and oats but is dominated by a great malty, caramel, chocolate taste. Mouthfeel is great, nice medium body, with relatively low carbonation and a great aftertaste. Great drinkability. This is another offering from Samuel Smith's that I will definately have again. If you like stouts this is a must have."
"This beer is very drinkable and one of my favorites."
"D- I'd drink it for a night. Not too sweet, not too dry. Just right. This is a great oatmeal stout."
"You can't go wrong with Sam Smith, the Tadcaster brewery. I haven't tasted anything average from this producer yet (the Organic Ale comes closest to ""average"") and I hope the company will never be tempted to cash in on some horrid licenced stuff ... this one is a refreshing, nutritious stout ..."
"Among all the beers I've tried...this is still probably my favorite which says a lot. Deliciously dark stout, organic, oaty flavor that is just plain and simple. I've sampled plenty of oatmeal stouts and they honestly can't hold a candle to the magic that samuel smith puts into ever pint. It set a new standard for my enjoyment of stouts in general...as a side note, i haven't had a bad beer from samuel smith yet and i've sampled all but maybe two of them it is truly a fine brewery."
"An Oatmeal Stout + beautifully grilled steak and Im in heaven."
"Pours an onyx black with a thick tan/offwhite head that thins down to a ring and leaves a webbing on the glass. Smells of nuts, toffee, caramel, coffee and oatmeal. Sweet with a touch of bitter. Exceptionally smooth taste with the same complexities of the aroma with a touch of a mild aftertaste. Very rich and creamy with a chewy mouthfeel. Thick, warming and satisfying. Very drinkable in both taste and texture though a bit filling. Makes a wonderful compliment to a meal and great as a dessert by itself."
"I'm editing my review: After 2+ years of drinking, this is still an excellent beer, but in my enthusiasm, I scored it slightly higher than it deserves. Still a solid A beer though."
"Drinkability: This is a great, easy drinking stout. Nothing to over the top as far as roastiness, hops, or malt, just a nice balanced blend."
"It's a good looking dark brown stout with a nice creamy head. Primarily coffee in the nose, though caramel might be there also. The flavor is where it's at though. This is a top quality stout with great balance, the malt flavor isn't overpowering and some of the coffee in the nose comes through on the palatte. It's got a pretty good mouthfeel too. This isn't a thin beer. If only it weren't so heavy you could drink this one all night. It's that good. But it is filling."
"The absence of bitterness, makes it very drinkable when served at a proper temperature, though maybe not the best example of the style. A classic."
"D: It's good, but it's not the best oatmeal stout I've ever had. Was a bit surprised to see this rank as high on the BA Top 100 as it does. I would absolutely drink this again, though."
"Overall, definitely not one of my favorite oatmeal stouts, but a good brew althogether. Worth a try for sure, but be warned about the higher-than-normal carbonation per style with this one."
"If you are a fan of stouts this is a definite must try."
"A very nice treat for all the senses. This would be one of my top picks to enjoy as an after dinner beer without a dessert, as it is almost sweet enough on its own merits. A very good choice to introduce yourself to the style."
"Overall, a very nice, well balanced stout. Not overly filling, so I could probably have a couple without feeling like I've had a full meal."
"Pours a thick, cola-like brown with a creamy tan head that retains pretty well. Smell is a little odd....wine like fruitiness, with notes of caramel, coffee, and roasted malt. Taste follows exactly, with that same wine-like fruitiness in the background...almost sour....other noticable flavors included chocolate, and some coffee. This is the first time that I have tried this beer, so I will get some more from a different store, and re-review."
"D: Legendary. Outstandingly good. A prize of an oatmeal stout."
"Very drinkable. I may very well have a new favorite beer."
"Overall it's quite drinkable, maybe because of the relative blandness, but it's not anything I'd turn down by any means."
"An Excellent beer.... I'll drink more for sure."
"Not as smooth as I remember it, but still a fantastic beer (in fact, the score went up from my last review). Recommended."
"Malty sweetness - chocolate malt, roasted barley, oatmeal. Creamy body at first, but it goes watery unless swallowed a little hastily. Finish is short. Too subdued for my taste. Fine without aggressive burned flavors, but more malt and more bitterness would help, I think. I would start with some hops - There's practically no bitterness or hop flavor/aroma. And the body is good for beer in general, but not really for oatmeal stout. A good, drinkable beer, I'll try it again sometime - judging by the other reviews, this may not be a fresh bottle."
"Pours a deep opaque black coffee color with deep brown-orange highlites. Two finger light tan cap that dissipates slowly. Aroma is distinct coffee, cocoa, toffee, grain, licorice, slight cherry fruitiness, and a hint of earthiness. Flavor is dark carmal maltiness with some slight sour cherry and wheat right up front. Followed with cocoa, coffee, and roasted barley. Very smooth mouthfeel, medium body, low bitterness and medium-light carbonation. Highly drinkable beer with just the right amount of alcohol."
"A must try for anyone with even the slightest interest in the style. I firmly believe that every Beer drinker should at least try a few Sam Smith's in their endeavors!"
"I love stouts, and this is one I can actually buy in Alabama (crappy beer laws)."
"D: This is a very good example of a sweet stout and well worth the potential spoilage of a clear glass."
"Overall, not bad, but nothing special in my opinion. I really gave this one a shot considering its pedigree, but I must say I was a bit disappointed."
"When I first opened the beer and took a smell, the first thing that came to my mind was ""breakfast"". You can smell the oatmeal with a hint of chocolate. A very smooth tasting stout. The complexity begins to come out as it warms up. The only downside is that this beer feels like a meal, it goes down easy but I could only have about two before I start to feel full. A solid choice if you're in the mood for an Oatmeal Stout."
"D - Good stout, but not quite as good as its reputation would suggest."
"Pours a very deep brown, bordering on black, with ruby sparkling around the edges of the glass and a large light tan head that lasts well and leaves thick lacing. Smell is a bit muted, with slightly burnt maltiness and a light coffee aroma with some earthy notes. Taste is rich and full, with bitter burnt chocolate and coffee malts providing the base upon which sweet fruity and caramel notes are delicately layered, making for a wonderful balance. The finish is sweet and long. Mouthfeel is perfectly smooth, well carbonated and clinging, and drinkability is stellar. What a perfect example of the style, an outstanding evening or dessert beer."
"Overall this is a stout I will drink over and over again. It is great with or after a meal. I can't say anything bad about it."
"Very black with a great frothy head. Not much lacing, though. As my daughter says, ""it smells like oatmeal"". Not as much coffee as some, but some nice roasted aroma. I like the sweetness of the aroma. Next to no carbonation. Hints of vanilla is nice."
"A nice hop bitterness hits the palate but is gone quickly as the dark malts take over. I also tasted tannins but in a GOOD way. A good froth in the mouth sweetens it up and you can feel the silkyness that I believe is imparted from the oats. I used to drink this stout all the time before it became the norm. Upon my return I am pleased to find it robust in malt and balanced in hoppiness. The aroma alone defines this stout as excellent. And I do say this stout is actually very good when fresh from the fridge in summer, for me anyway. Cheers, Joe"
"A must try."
"Heavy-bodied mouthfeel with little carbonation. Very creamy and smooth on the palate, and with a relatively low ABV, though the drinkability is hindered because this beer is just so heavy. Too filling, it feels more like a meal than a beer. Excellent treat, just don't expect to session this one. I would definitely recommend this beer to anyone... actually, come to think of it, I already do."
"Drinkability: on the whole, not as good as Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout, but good. a little too sweet to be highly drinkable, for me."
"Fairly easy drinking for a stout."
"Here it is one of my Favs of all time just the taste and the complexity of this beer is amazing. Every time I drink one I come to find that it has a complete different taste to it very good in my book. The appearance is of a pitch dark to almost cola like blackness to it with a nice 2 inch head and very heavy lacing on the glass. This stout has such a good smell to it I wished they bottled it as a cologne, it is that good roasted oats with hints of chocolate and arabica coffee. The taste is wonderful of roasted malts and hints of chocolate that go down nice ans smooth, leaves a great aftertaste of vanilla."
"I keep smacking and swallowing to shake that sour touch. Very smooth beer with a distractingly high level of carbonation for a stout. The tangy sour flavor is eventually too much, I think I would drink the heck out of this beer if it weren't there."
"Poured a deep, dark brown, almost opaque color with a medium sized light tan head that left nice lacing on the glass. Sweet dark fruit and oatmeal, chocolate, and roasted malt aroma with some slight alcohol. Very creamy mouthfeel, with roasted malt, chocolate, and oatmeal. This was the start of it all for me. I could drink this all day!"
"This was a good beer, but nothing spectacular. Poured to a deep black with tan head that faded quickly. Deccent lacing as I drank. Aroma was hints of chocolate, but faint. I enjoyed the flavor, especially at mid-glass, but the body seemed light, and slightly watery. Had an okay finish, but nothing to write home about. Enjoyed the SS Taddy Porter and Impy Stout more."
"Appearance on this beer is completely pitch black with a thick, rocky half inch white head with some good retention. Smell was dominated with lactates, accompanied with some light coffee and chocolate. Also in the nose were oats, a hint of something metallic, and also a somewhat pungeant vinnegar smell. Taste was a bit musty, but big on the oatmeal and chocolate flavors. This is a pretty big beer to be had, but in a good way in that this one could have fallen short. I have had many oatmeal stouts that just seem big and clunky, just pure heavyness without anything to really mention except its bigness. This oatmeal stout on the other hand has alot of personality and can be easily identified as being a Samuel Smith offering. As far as drinkability, although I enjoyed it, one bomber was more then enough for me, simply too much thickness for me. You can't really go wrong with this brewery, they time and time again provide classic esamples of the styles that they brew. A great starting point for anyone getting into quality beers."
"Looks the part with a rich dark color and a thick, creamy head. There is a hint of oatmeal when you open the bottle and in each drink. A very smooth, highly drinkable beer that finished strong."
"This beer was one of my introductions to the craft beer scene, and it was a pleasure to revisit."
"I have found this beer to be ideally suited for two applications: as the first beer of a tailgate (a.k.a. ""breakfast"") and as a compliment to cashews. An exceptional beer that I would love to taste on draught someday."
"Jolly good mate!"
"M/D- Moderate carbonation for a stout...the hop crispness right as the finish begins makes this beer all the more drinkable....it is pretty heavy, but easy to drink....I love that a beer like sam smith's is so readily available."
"Overall a decent offering."
"This ones really fantastic. The flavor is very simple and delicate, and the mouth feel works exceptionally well with it. Very nice."
"18.7 ounce bottle."
"Admittedly, I succumbed to a BA taboo by writing this review while slightly inebriated, but the flavors and aromas were so strong (especially after drinking Red Hook IPAs, which flavorwise were lighter) that it didn't even matter if my senses were slightly dulled, this beer packed a whallop of flavor! A great dessert brew."
"A classic example of the style. I had my first ten years ago and it has stayed delicious throughout the span. Way to go, Limeys! ;^)"
"Quite drinkable. Good session stout if thats your style. ABV is only around 5. An excellent example of the style without any bells or whistles."
"Cheers mates! MK"
" Eric"
"Killer session brew."
"Pours pitch black with a one finger mocha head. Smell is sweet dark roasted malt with chocolate and coffee. Mouthfeel is slightly carbonated and very smooth. Taste is sweet chocolate in the beginning with notes of coffee rounding out the end of the sip. Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout is a world-class beer that I always try to have in my refrigerator."
"I found I had to drink it a little colder than I normally like dark beers. Just under or at refridgerator temp. (What, about 50F I think?)"
"Overall, this is very good for an oatmeal stout. It's very drinkable and not too heavy as far as stouts go."
"D - high, not to alcoholic, not to bitter, easy for no-crafters"
"D: Highly drinkable, especially for a stout. Not suggesting the beer doesnt have many characteristics that should be savored. Rather, there is a good balance of complexity and drinkability to this beer."
"In any case, a great brew, and one that is really a great introduction to the fact that beer does not consist of a piss colored beverage you suck down to get loaded despite its nasty taste. I went to the store with the explicit purpose of getting this beer, because I had a trend of really bad oatmeal stouts and i needed something to restore my faith in the style. This certainly worked like a charm."
"This might not be the best example of this style, but it is certainly a great beer. However, I've had some regional and local oatmeal stouts that were almost/just as/slightly better for less money. This is a special treat - and a bit different than most others - nevertheless."
"it does have nive coffee flavors, is very smooth on the palate, and is a bit more drinkable than many in the family tho i wouldnt say its a session."
"I have had this before, as well as reviewed it. It has been quite a long time, however, and I felt revisiting it was in order. It poured black with a khaki coloured, thick foamy head which was slow to dissipate. The foam clung tightly to the sides of the glass when tilted. The smell is positively fantastic. Even better than I had remembered, quite honestly. You can actually smell the oatmeal present, on top of a bit of smoke, with some sweet malt, and very, very subtle chocolate, as well. Smells absolutely delicious. The taste is very pleasant, exhibiting most everything present in the smell. The oatmeal itself is a bit less in the taste and more in the smell, but the smoke and chocolate along with the sweet, roasted malt are all very much present here. Mouthfeel is smooth and gentle. This is better than I had remembered it, or perhaps my palate has become more keen since I last tried this, either way, I am very glad indeed that I chose to revisit this one."
"mouth: Enters with a smokier feel than I'd anticipated (but not overwhelming or unpleasant). Strong flavors of bittersweet chocolate and mint - alternating between sweet and sour. The hops seemed to be a bit sour in place of the usual bitterness, but it balances well with the sweetness. In terms of mouthfeel, the beer enters strong and fizzy but as it moves back in the mouth it settles into a creamy oatmeal-y flavored mouth cover that is so damn enjoyable I don't want to swallow. The non-aggressive warm exhale concludes this excellent gastronomic experience."
"Now this is damn good beer. Poured from a 550ml bottle at around cellar temp this beer comes out nice and dark (almost pure black in color). As I put the glass to my nose I can tell I going to enjoy this one. I get the scent of chocolate, coffee, and maybe some oats. The taste is outstanding and reconfirms what my nose has told me. All the flavors are there including some maltiness and hops. If anyone whats to get me something for my birthday I'd be more than happy with this stuff. A great stout in my opinion."
"I like this one a great deal, yet one was enough. I generally like to switch beers to keep the palate interested. However, I will return to Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout."
"Nice stuff that I treat myself to every once in a while. Pours dark brown, smells like cocoa. Tastes like bitter cocoa, malt but not overly sweet and not too much like chocolate. Finishes really nice. A bit tamer than the imperial stout, but still a damn good dessert beer."
"I feel like this is a pretty standard oatmeal stout. It doesn't appear as lights out dark as some darker roasted stouts, but it has a bit more tan appearance around the edges, and leaves a medium in size, lighter in color head. The smell, taste, and mouthfeel of this beer are the highlights of it for me. It is fairly sweet for a stout, it tones back the darker malts and highlights sweeter carmel maltiness that leaves a foamy, sweet mouthfeel. It has a dry fruity flavor that I like."
"The alcohol is a bit noticeable, and I think it takes a bit away from the drinkability. I don't think I'd want more than one bottle at a time, but that one is very nice!"
"This is truly a dessert in a bottle. I really love this stuff. I think I would take a bottle of this over a cake for my birthday."
"Very fine product. Good head. Fairly decent aroma. It's walking by a fancy coffee shop and a faint scent floats out the door past your nose. The smell translates equally into a nice smooth, mild favor. Slightly sweet, a little toasty. Very creamy feel with just a little carbonation. One of the most drinkable stouts I've ever had."
"A very easy drinking stout due to its thin-ness and low abv. A classic from a classic brewery."
"D: Very easy going down. Light on the booze, but a bit heavy on the sweetness to drink all night."
"This is a very dark black beer with barely a ruby/orange edge to it. The head is tan and very dense, tight bubbles. Smells a sour, sweet malty flavor. A strong caramel like smell to it, with a bit of fruity apple peel to it. This has an awesome flavor. There is a hint of coffee type malt that comes out toward the end of the swallow and leaves me saying Wow! A chocolatey, coffee. Up front it is that sweet malty, smell, maybe a little tamed. But regardless it is amazing. The apple peel flavor in the nose is not as strong to my tongue. Mouthfeel is not really syrupy, but it has a strong body to it. Very, very drinkable. Haven't had this one in awhile (a year or so) and I have been missing out on so much."
"Unfortunately, I think because oatmeal stouts are so good anyway, Samuel Smith's oatmeal stout gets a really good rating, but in the specific category, it just can't stand up to some of the smaller brews I've had. But, at the grocery store, Samuel Smith's the one oat stout you can be sure is going to be there."
"Pours very dark, almost black. Leaves a tan thick pleasant lacy head. The smell is subtle, yet intriguing, and from first whiff the drinker can detect a slightly sweet malty aroma. The taste is smooth, sticky sweet, and almost chewy at the same time. The roasted sweet oat taste is evident. The carbonation is perfect. This Oat stout is by far the tastiest that I have discovered. Unlike some other Oatmeal Stouts, this one is creamy rather that watery, and extremely smooth. I would say that it is the pinnacle of any Oatmeal Stout that I have experienced, and would recommend it to any beer conosiour."
"As tasty as this brew is, unless you really love your stouts, I doubt you will be able to drink more than one or two of these in a sitting...enjoy!"
"D: Would be a nice stout to have around. It is good, but it isn't great. Certainly worth a try."
"Great quaffability, I highly reccomend this ressurection (decades ago) of a classic from sam smith's"
"Overall, this beer is warm and comforting . . . it feels familiar! It is a terrific end to a winter night - it leaves you feeling warm inside."
"An easy to drink stout, but not a traitor to the traditional robust flavor of the stout flavor we've all came to love. Cool!"
"Clearly an impressive oatmeal stout. I love one every now and then - usually with a hearty meat and potatoes meal, but I can't see drinking it daily or as a session beer."
"I am a firm believer that clear bottles can hurt a beers flavor, and I defineitely get the same thing in here that I got in their Nut Brown Ale. I think Samuel Smith would be better served with using dark bottles, but thats just my $.02. I would still try other brews of theirs, but won't grab for this first if I had other options."
"D- really surprisingly drinkable. This is a surprise, most of the time stouts are one and done with the thickness and the complexity. This stout however balances the complexity with a crisp smoothness that makes it oh so drinkable."
"Comments: I enjoyed this Oatmeal Stout having never had one, of any brand, before. Initially, I was a bit put off by the aroma. The strong alcohol smell was overpowering to such an extent that it overcame the rest of its aromatic character. Once past the aroma, the wonderful flavor quickly charmed & endeared me to this stout. I would like to try others in the same style..."
"Mouthfeel is exellent. Very smooth."
"This is an incredibly smooth, tasty beer. Pours a solid black color with very little light getting through. Has an impressive tan head that slowly recedes down to just covering the glass. Lacing is thick. The smell is not particularly impressive, some malt, nothing outstanding. The taste is malty and incredibly smooth. The taste is slightly sweet, incredibly mellow and the mouthfeel is rich. There is no ""getting used to"" the taste. It is simple, nicely blended and has no unpleasant chalkiness, bitterness or other aftertaste. This is something I could slowly sip all night. I would take this over any of the few stouts I have tried so far."
"A very creamy, smooth medium to full body, coupled with low carbonation makes this a rich, luscious mouthfeel. This richness made me enjoy drinking this beer slowly, and it makes not so drinkable."
"I can see this as a nice addition to a meal... but on it's own it's a little bit disappointing. Not a bad beer, though."
"I could have finished the bottle but simply didn't want to. Moved on to a Black Hart stout and enjoyed the rest of the evening."
"Drinkability: Definitely one of the best of the style. It may not be the best, but it's not overrated. And especially for the price, this is a sipper and a treat to boot. Quality stuff all around, and the perfect amount of alcohol so you can have a few in a session too if you're going that route."
"Very quaffable."
"Drinkability: Very, very drinkable... surpassed my expectations and made me want more."
"Overall - This one gets better and better as you drink it. The flavors really come through as it warms. This isn't my #1 oatmeal stout, but it is very close. It isn't ""too"" anything; its well-balanced, flavorful, and very drinkable. If I could afford to, I would give this to anyone wanting to try a stout (but it is too expensive to be giving out willy nilly). This beer lives up to the hype."
"550ml-bottle.This famous stout poured out a dark black/brown with a small dark tan head.The smell was sweet with hints of chocolate,molassas and coffee.There was also the above flavors in the taste as well,but the mouthfeel was a little thin for me,especially for a stout.I felt the beer was ok for me,although it may be a little overrated."
"D - This is my 2nd oatmeal stout and is quickly becoming my favorite of the stout styles. A very drinkable beer and not as heavy as one would expect."
"Enjoyable and I will have it again."
"This was the first oatmeal stout I ever had, about 3-4 years ago. One of the few beers that has stayed with me throughout the years of developing my palate. Without a doubt, this is the oatmeal stout to which all others should be compared to. A benchmark of the style."
"D: Despite being heavy and a bit filling, this beer goes down very easy. It’s very flavorful and not over-powering. This is a beer that you can just chill out and relax with."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Another exceptional entry from the Samuel Smith line of brews. Drinks much like their Imperial Stout, if not a tad short of that classic. Smooth, molassesy finish with a nice touch of sourness, this is one of the easiest-drinking stouts in the world..."
"d: You can't really have a multiple amount of these beers do to how creamy and filling they are, but they are so smooth anyone can have at least one without a problem. A great example of a oatmeal stout"
"A classic of the style. One of the beers that turned me on to craft brew."
"Samual Smith's Oatmeal stout is a really good beer with that said. this beer poured nice and dark with a good creamy head. the smell is roasted malt. the feel to this beer is great kinda heavy and thick, gives you an Roasty malt taste oats dark chocolate and coffee near the end. very good over all and I would grab this one first over all the sam smith beers I've had."
"D: Quite drinkable. I'm going to be buying this more often -- I like this a lot more than I remembered."
"Again this is a very solid stout and one that I wish I could duplicate on the homebrew scene."
"Samuel Smith is one of my favorite breweries and the oatmeal stout is one of my favorite beers from them. Very very drinkable. I can have many of these in a night...."
"D: While it does have a low ABV I really wouldn't call it a session beer. It is just too rich to drink too many of them. Two of them is enough for me in one. night"
"Overall a great beer. Sometimes i overlook this, because of the price. I should get it more, but for special occasions (like when i'm sober). but really, a great beer."
"got 3 550 ml bottles for christmas. Very dark in bottle, you can forget that the bottle is clear. I'm all in favor of traditions...but the clear glass should go. This bottle was fine but I have had off bottles...problem is most packy sell this if they're going to carry a ""gourmet"" beer....but not alll stores take care of them or turn them fast enough. The flavor was malty with choc and coffee overtones...but not as tasty as Storm King or some of the better porters. Mouthfeel also not as thick as I would expect form an oatmeal stout...but the oats do make it feel silky.Overall a good beer but not up to the standards of the finest stouts and porters"
"Musings: I've had plenty of these in the past - first review. I do love the taste of the beer - the body and feel is just too thin for my liking. Put it against McNeill's or even Troegs and the skinny feel is clearly evident. Even still, a first rate stout."
"roasted malts in the taste with a medium mouthfeel and a heavy carbonation. leans towards the sweet side, but overall is a touch too thin in flavor. pleasant drink, but a touch too subtle in both aroma and flavor. the style in general is not for me."
"cheers..."
"Poured into a large pint glass as a very dark, almost opaque black/brown color. Very boisterous light tan head with exceptional retention. Nose is rich, slightly chocolaty, with roasted malt predominant. Slightly sweet aroma. Taste is almost bitter-sweet, with a strong maltiness and some baker's chocolate. Deceaving mouthfeel that I want to call medium, but finishes rather light instead. Low carbonation. Finishes dryer, with lingering roasted nutty flavors. This one is a good one ... maybe a very good one if you particularly like this style. Smooth and a little sweet. Worth a try!"
"I could simply not put this one down. It's rather easy to see why this one is a craft beer classic. Delicious and highly drinkable"
"Overall: Nice, but its not going into my regular rotation."
"Dark brown almost black in color with a carmel brown one inch head. A toasty, granola smell. A smooth, sweet taste that lingers into a nice aftertaste. An oh, so drinkable stout that I feel sets the standard for oatmeal stouts. Often I use this beer to introduce stouts to my friends who prefer lighter beers. This is one of my favorites and I wish to try on tap some day."
"Nice beer. I prefer the Imperial Stout, but this is also good."
"Very black in color, a short tan head develops slow during the pour, and then fades quickly. The carbonation appears to be average. Smell is dry and chocolate-y, mildly hoppy. The aroma is a bit off, it reminds me of drywall, oddly enough. The flavor is like dry coffee, a bit woody, and slightly sweet. The finish isn't all that bitter, but it does taste slightly burnt/toasty. The beer feels well carbonated, its thick but remains smooth. Drinkability isn't bad for this one. I feel like my review is lower than most and I can't figure out why. In the past I've liked this beer more, and this time I got more than one bottle from more than one source to make sure it wasn't skunked, but I feel the same way about it each time now. I think I'll stick with the Imperial Stout instead..."
"Mouthfeel is rich and velvety. I have a few bottles of this old stand-by a year and it usually makes me wonder why I bother with anything else. Many thanks to Jwff for the Sam Smith gift pack."
"Not a bad little stout, but it does feel like a little stout. I was hoping the flavor would be a little more aggressive."
"An easy beer to drink a few of although rather filling. I enjoyed the beer, but would like to have another bottle from a different batch. it tasted a little old to me. understandable vancouver is a ways away from Jolly Old."
"Drinkability: Boy, this is one thick beer, and as filling as one would expect from this thickness. Still, I'd feel OK spending a session on the Taddy oatmeal stout."
"Oh how I love this beer. Even starting to write a review about it makes my mouth water. The smell is fantastic! A rich roasted malty flavour that attacks your senses. You have to pour this beer then let it sit for a while. When this beer is too cold it destroys the taste. Like most good beers in my opinion. When it gets to the 55 degree mark start your drinking. You'll notice that about halfway through your already considering another one. Order it before you run out! If your not familiar with English brews don't be surprised by the lack of head. Thats a normal trait of good English beers. Enjoy."
"Not a beer I will be rushing back to, but a solid, quality product nevertheless that I know will pass over the lips happily enough somewhere in the future."
"D - This is hands down the most complex and delicious beer that has ever touched my lips. If you want to quit drinking swill and start enjoying GOOD beer, start here!"
"Not as good as my fond memories built it up in my mind, but still a quality product. I think it was the silky smooth mouthfeel that caught my attention so long ago, rather than the flavor."
"Highly, highly recommended. This ode to malt is fragrant, tasty, and luxuriant. Get it. Now! :)"
"Overall I enjoyed this one. It was fairly easy to drink. And oatmeal is supposed to lower your cholesterol!! We're saved!!"
"This beer poured a dark almost opaque black with hints of amber. There is a sizeable frothy tan head that dissapates mostly but leaves a little froth the whole way down the beer. The beer smells fairly sweet with roasted malts of chocolate. The taste is very sweet but overall very similar to the smell. The mouthfeel is thick with a good level of carbonation and a little drynes. The drinkability suffers a little bit due to the beer being so sweet but it is still a great drink"
"D - Absurdly drinkable. An ideal session. Perfect for foods. This is an outstanding beer. Troegs Oatmeal Stout is superior, but this is a different and excellent oatmeal stout."
"Subtle, tasty, extremely drinkable."
" In my opinion it is a bit pricey but then again what the Hell....live a little Eh?"
"This pours a dark black with a hint a red leaving a two finger head that leaves nice lacing,although the head does leave rather quickly.The smell is very strong with a very deep mollasses sweetness to it.There are also hints of fruit,raisins or prunes? and alcohol to the aroma.The taste is very creamy and milky with hints of coffee,alcohol,fruit,and mollasses.This is a pretty sweet stout.The m/f is medium with a nice balance.This is a very good,sweet,beer that I enjoy and will have again,but I can't help thinking that this is a tad overrated."
"Very easy to drink...after the first sip. Your tongue has to wake up."
" The whole 550ml bottle is rich and robust, chewy, - very full bodied and all the while very enjoyable. Great sipper in the winter  hell, this one would go great in the summer too! And it has on the deck at the Lake of the Ozarks, many times."
"Like some many of Samuel Smiths beers, its classic of the style and I personally havent found too many other oatmeal stouts that I can honestly say are better. Highly recommended."
"I would have liked to taste a little more oatmeal in this one."
"You may have discerned from my name that i love Samuel Smith beers!"
"Poured deep brown/black with a tan fluffy foam head, dark ruby edges (barely) if held to the light. Lacing is moderate to sparse - seems a bit soapy-ish at first. Aroma is mainly of fruits, especially a dried raisin or prune smell. Slight hints of burnt cocoa and chocolate as well. Taste is mostly burnt, with hints of sweet chocolate and a syrupy fruitiness. Mouthfeel was a bit thin but not too bad, actually coated the palate a bit and complemented the fruity and bitter finish. Not a bad beer for every once in a while, but not anything to rush to your local store for."
"Overall: Man, I love this one as much as ever. I've had a lot of stouts since the first time I tried this one, and it's still high on my list."
"Overall this is a very enjoyable beer that I wish I could drink to my heart's fulfillment without going broke. I could sip these and eat chocolate all night. This beer is definitely worth a try and is a little bit tastier than Young's in my opinion."
"Everything seems to balance out well in this stout. Low bitterness to where the roasted taste is most flavorful. Also Nuty sweet! Unlike some stouts I have tried the dark roast lingers nicely and not too bitterly. Just enough to be very pleasant. Can't go wrong with this one."
"as expected, mouthfeel is very smooth. seemingly no carbonation, and a nice stout overall."
"drinkability: it's good but after a bottle i've had enough. a classic beer that is good..."
"Opinion: Go Sam Smith's! This beer is a whole lot better than I even remember it to be. It has a superbly crafted balance with just enough sweet and slickness to make it feel like you just had dessert. Nice beer!"
"Notes: I think this would be the easiest stout to enjoy. Let the rooks sample this as it has an ease about it that cant be matched. I have, and would welcome sessioning this bitch anyday."
"Overall, a great stout that I will be seeking out again in the near future."
"Body is where it's at, just above medium with a smooth as silk mouthfeel and soft, buttery texture that simply glides across your palate."
" This is a beautiful beer. Probably not for everyone, and for me only a winter thing but if in the mood for a good stout, this is your wing man. I can see why everyone loves this: tasty, filling and surprisingly exquisite."
"Pours a very dark brown with a very small, light brown, foamy, mostly diminishing head. The smell is quite good. Sweet chocolate malts accompanied by aromas of molasses, butter, light spruce, raspberries and a touch of prune-like tawny port. The taste is of course very malt-dominant bringing in flavors of chocolate and coffee. Theres just the slightest hint of citrus making the hops presence just barely noticeable, but they add a nice bitterness to the finish. It has a medium body, dry texture and very low carbonation. I found this to be a bit thin for an oatmeal stout, but otherwise it is very enjoyable."
"Do this beer (and yourself) a favor and let this warm up..the flavors get much more evident and mouthfeel is very creamy, despite it being somewhat thin. Drinkability is great for a nut brown...just wish I could try this on-tap somewhere so I could try an untainted version."
"Pours true black with hints of ruby only visible when held up to direct light...even then it's just a hint. Nose is strong with raisins and lighter with baker's chocolate and coffee. Taste is almost perfect for what I would expect in this style, Classic stout flavors shine through with mild coffee and chocalate as well as some more unexpected nutty suggestions. The part where Sam Smith's is set apart though is the hop bitterness, they have this down perfectly which creates an amazingly balanced beer which is both filling yet wets the appetite. Aftertaste is long and perfect with a mouthfeel that is just right. An exceptional brew from an exceptional brewery."
"I haven't had the pleasure of trying many oatmeal stouts, but Sammy Smith got this one right. Excellent.."
"If you cant afford this, an excellent alternative is the aforementioned Mackesons."
"This is a classic, of course, not because I said so, or because you say so. That being said, wiser men than me, by the score no doubt, will leave weightier opinions. What I may be able to add is that this beer is certainly not as sweet as you may remember, and on that note, it deserves true characterization as a world class stout, along with imperials and exports, double americans, and the like."
"Pricey, and worth it. You can easily drink the entire 4-pack in one sitting."
"Drinkablity: I could drink a lot of these brews in one sitting. This did not fill me up as fast as other stouts. It has a nice flavor from the combination of oats and malts. It left my taste buds wanting more. I cannot wait to purchase more of this wonderful treat."
"D- This beer has a very nice depth to it. The oat flavors come through with layers of dark roasted malt. The slight sour finish really balances the malt in the absence of hops."
"Overall = Recommended for fans of stouts. This isn't a style I particularly enjoy but I can appreciate this as an excellent representative."
"Drinkability is good, but I think one or 2 is all I could handle. Its pretty rich."
"This beer was tough to get down. Actually, I didnt even finish the bottle. Based on other BA reviews, I'm assuming this was not the freshest of bottles. However, I'm reviewing this beer as is since Samuel Smith makes no attempt to ensure the freshness of their beer (i.e. clear bottles, no born-on/exp date)."
"An excellent feel to this beer, firm and smooth. One of the better stouts I've tried, and no doubt will be trying again."
"Taste is absolutly amazing. Slightly roasted nuts, with a coffie tang, smooth as milk and twice as tasty."
"Like a bad American I started drinking this a tad too cold. As it warmed it really mellowed out and came into its own. The flavors were much more balanced and it just slid right down. Ive had this before, but never realized how much I enjoyed it until I decided to review it. Its a substantial brew without being too boozy, syrupy or cloying. An ideal winter session brew. Oh yeah, I almost forgot: oatmeal is good for."
"Drinkability was quite good. I liked this one a lot."
"-UF"
"I still don't know which Oatmeal Stout I like better - this or the St. Amb's version. But there's always room for lots of both in my cupboard/fridge!"
"One of the best stouts I've had. Stouts are not normally my thing, I'm very rarely in the mood for one, but when I am in the mood, this will be one of the first stouts I reach for."
"I was really surprised not to like this beer, after all the hype it gets on this site and the fact that i usually love oatmeal stouts. but this was just way too sweet and had a very off flavor to me, also the mouthfeel was too thin for the style i thought, one of my least favorite stouts to date. i guess a lot of people disagree with me on this one but i just didn't care for it."
"Pours nearly black with ruby highlights. A huge pale brown head forms, very dense in consistency and superb retention that coats the entire glass with sticky lacing. Very sweet roasted barley aroma, with some molasses notes. Sweet oats and deep roasted flavor is robust but not overwhelming. The lack of any hop profile is compensated by the bitterness from the malts, leaving a balanced flavor that is non-residual, but also not too dry. Light carbonation and a full body lend a smooth and drinkable character that compliment the rich flavor. Burnt malt and overly sweet aftertaste create a flash of soy sauce, which fades quickly but leaves a slightly astringent finish."
"I could easily drink a couple of these, however, I wouldn't recommend it for the price. It was smooth but there really wasn't much going on with this beer. Give it to someone that thinks Guinness is too much. I don't understand the hype on this one, but if you'd like to send a bottle to reconsider, I'll gladly drink it."
"If there were a Roasted Brown Ale this is it."
"Not your run of the mill stout here. Much easier to finish off than some of the other stouts I've drank in the past year, especially when served just under room temperature. Unlike some other oatmeal stouts, there is more than just a hint of the surname in the smell and taste. Great head and lacing, can fill you up however."
"I was thrown by this one....thought the bottle was brown....the beer is really that dark....Nice and opaque with a few reddish brown tints. Nice two finger head frothy, sticks to the glass in a nice lace top to bottom. The smell is strong and sweet like brown sugar with oats. The taste is very good smooth and sweet to start with a nice coffee finish....not overly bity on the end. Very nice mouthfeel full bodied and strong. I will buy this one again."
"Havent had this one in a very long time. Why did I stay away so long? If you have recently been consumed with the more recent and over the top offerings, come back and revisit this classic. You will be glad you did."
"I've had this before and I remember enjoying it, so this bottle could have been treated poorly, but the brewery uses clear bottles so they are certainly not the victim here. I will most likely try another bottle in the future (not the near future) with hopes for the best."
"Pours a dark brown/black, little carbonation, small head out of a clear bottle. Not much lacing. Scents of malt, toffee/caramel sweetness, smells stronger than it's ABV. Taste's a little sour and finishes a little dry. Medium body. At 5% ABV you could drink a few, a good session brew. The clear bottle will keep me away from this brew, not telling how long it's been sitting there."
"this beer looks a lot like motor oil that has not been changed in bout tenthousand miles i like it. smells like beer taste like nothing i have ever had almost like it was recently on fire as a friend of mine put it it is a god damn beer as in god damn thats good. i think i would definatly drink this again even at 4.50 a bottle"
"This beer has a wonderfull appearance. It poured a very dark brown. It lets a very small amount of light through. It poured with a average sized tan head that did not stick around very long. The taste is dominated by the presence of roasted oats. I gave it a 3.5 on drinkability due to a strange aftertaste. This beer tastes as if the alcohol content is higher that the listed 5%. It would not be my first choice as a Oatmeal Stout but, however a solid choice."
"Overall: If you like oatmeal stouts you really should check this out. More of a hop presence and noticeable bitterness in the aftertaste than many but I feel that lends more character than it takes away."
"Overall: It's true(as I've been told) Samuel Smith makes the highest quality brews. And this is one of them. Like Stout? Try this one."
"It feels great. My mouth is tickled pink drinking this. It screams, Give me more! My stomach too tells me to keep this one coming. It coats the inside of my gullet making me feel warm and strong. Tastes like health."
"Very good oatmeal stout one of my favorite and at $3.99 a bottle it better be! One of my favorites"
"D - A nice sipper, like many stouts I've tried I could definitely sit and enjoy two or three of these at the end of the night."
"I would recommend, but would also love to try this on-tap to see the difference."
"Pours a clear black with some red highlights around the edges and a thick tan head, lots of lacing as well. Smell is sweet and roasty, some chocolate and grass is present. Taste is lots of anise, some roasted chocolate, coffee, oats and grass. Smooth, medium bodied and medium carbonation, pretty tasty although the taste is off because of the clear bottle."
"A classic...good reputation for a reason. Always satisfying and highly recommended. Great stout."
"Pours a dark, almost opaque brown with an impressive brownish tan head, though watery and not thick on the pour like Mackeson. Theres a nice malt/sorghum nose, though again not quite as complex or pleasing as in Mackesons offering. Flavor is good, slightly bitter with a strong presence of toasted malt. Its a pleasantly liquid beer, going down easily but not as thick or substantial as Id prefer. The finish is pleasingly bitter. Again, I find this to be a superior stout, but I believe that Mackeson edges it out in several important areas including appearing, taste, and mouthfeel."
"An excellent stout that I find myself picking up often. I think one of the ingredients is awesome-ness."
"This is the best Sam Smith's I have ever had, purchased at Harrington's in Chelmsford, MA. Due to the clear bottles they use, it's possible that my previous forays were with light touched beer, or maybe I just failed to truly appreciate the goodness. Whatever the real story, a most excellent beer overall."
"D: Very drinkable."
"One of the most well balanced beers that I have had."
"Almost pitch black in colour, the tan head on this brew didn't last too long. Nice malty caramel aroma with chocolate notes. Surprisingly carbonated and bitter. I didn't get any of the coffee notes that I was expecting, but I did get more malt and chocolate. A bit thin bodied, but still an excellent brew."
"This brew pours darker than a black steer's tookus on a moonless prairie night. Its massive whitish tan head lingers around long after the beer is gone. The aroma is everything that can be hoped in an oatmeal stout. Creamy, nutty, chocolaty, roasted malt. The taste is quite simply as perfect as the aroma. Creamy and chocolaty. The mouthfeel is smooth beyond discription. Overall, this is one of the best brews I have ever had."
"More would be good. How is it on tap, and where can one obtain it so?"
"The bar that I compare other Oatmeal Stouts with. Pours a nearly opaque black. Only very dark ruby highlights shine through. Forms a stiff tan head that remains and laces. Smells mildly of barley malt, roasted malt, chocolate, and cappuchino. Throw in some mild souring as well. No hop aromas. Flavors are similar to those in the nose, only much more bold, rich, and full. Never gets astringent or grainy. Big body finishes with flavors of plumbs and grapes (not wine). Finishes silky smooth, modestly sweet. The oatmeal rarely shows flavors but adds to the richness and smoothness of the beer. I highly recomend."
"This is a beautiful, smooth, subtle, easy going stout. No, it's not going to kick you in the teeth, but that's fine with me. I'm more than happy to be seduced by a beer rather than overpowered by one. Too bad I can't get this stuff here regularly, and too bad I only brought one back from Calgary."
"All I can figure from this is that this 6pack must have been mistreated, I will try again, from a different retailer, and see if I see things differently next time, but this one was nasty."
"I haven't had too many oatmeal stouts that I can think of, but this is pretty good as far as stouts on the whole go. I wasn't quite wowed by this but I'd give it another go next to others of the style."
"More goodness from Sam. Deep, deep dark color. Smells sour, almost a red wine vinegar scent- odd, but intriguing. Tastes of coffee, toffee, and malt. Roastedness, and a sour/tart/tangyness that I really enjoy. Oats also add to the character of this brew. Mouthfeel is bubbly and chewy. The sourness becomes a bit hard to stomach after a while, almost starts to remind me of cough syrup- but overall not a bad experience."
"Notes: Sole US distributor - Merchant du Vin"
"The color is a deep dark brown/black with a slight head. Not much in a distinct aroma. The taste has a little acidity to it. A good session brew with the low ABV. This is the first ale that got me started on the stout kick. I can remember being in college and having this for the first time in between classes in business college. Their are stout styles out their that offer more in terms of favor IMO."
"Over all, this is an easy going beer and is worth checking out."
"Pours a transluscent black with ruby highlights and thin tan head. Aroma consists mostly of sweet malt scents: caramel, oatmeal, toasted grain, molasses and toffe, as well as a light floral hops scent. Taste begins with a slightly bitter hop profile of mineraly, floral and earthy flavors followed by a complex malt character that is slightly sweet with hints of caramel, molasess, burnt toast, toffee, chocolate, and of course oatmeal. Mouthfeel is very smooth with moderate carbonation, and the drinkability is good as well. A great oatmeal stout, readily available and very tasty this is really deserving of its reputation."
"The mouthfeel is just a wee bit light for a stout, but the drinkability shines."
"Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout is a beautiful beer, and oily, inky black with a tannish head and good lacing. Smells of brown sugar and vanilla, mixed with a nice smoked/roasted scent. Tastes like sweet, smoky vanilla; faux-alcoholic. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but otherwise, this is an excellent beer. Sam, you done better with your stout than you did with your brown, son."
"Drinkability: Low alcohol content makes this an easy drinking beer, even in the summer heat, although I don't think one would want to make a session out of it. Still, very approachable, it's one of those beers where BMC drinker will be intimidated by its ""motor oil"" appearance and leave it alone. Although he will still insist that he's a real man and don't drink that weird beer, as he pounds his Bud Light. Oh well, more of the good stuff for the BA's."
"this beer may be much much better on tap, which could be said the same for many other beers, therefore I can't help but add that the oatmeal stout came a long way from England to the land where oatmeal stouts do not rule enough for people clear the shelves in time for fresher batches. however I do recommend this for special occasions, all the while served cold, and I mean COLD. serving it warm can make the stout way too unappealingly sweet."
"12 oz. bottle, served slightly chilled in a goblet. Pours black with ruby tinges and it's topped with a 1/2 inch tan head that doesn't leave much lace, but I was swirling the beer a bunch also. Smells like apples, banana pudding, chocolate, coffee, raisins, yeast, and lots of sweetness. The taste is the same but with a hint of alcohol and some piney/citric hops whose bitterness appears more as the beer warms. The body is full and smooth with medium carbonation and the beer itself is a top-notch brew."
"Overall  one of my favorite oatmeal stouts highly recommended if you like this style."
"Pours pitch black with a thin cap of beige head and moderate retention. Nose is roasted coffee, sweet molasses, oatmeal cookies. Taste is pretty sweet with flavors of oats, bitter chocolate, black licorice, and roasted malts coming through. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth and thick, very nice. This is a very good stout, more drinkable than the Imperial."
"Pours very, very black. With a bit of a satiny shine. Good, two finger brown head floating atop this liquid which stays til the end. Lace sticks to the glass like butter, leaving behind artistic designs on the glass. Smells sweet and earthy. Malts, oatmeal, molasses, coffee, and some nuts. The earthy smell seems a bit out of place. It reminds me of garden dirt. Ooh, good taste. Sweet malts, nuts, molasses, bitter coffe, sweet chocolate, and even a bit of spice. Mouthfeel is smooth. Just like the satin it looks like. Very drinkable. I can drink these one after another, and enjoy the last like the first. I love this beer."
"Highly recommended over your average brew, but as far as stouts go you can do better. Even so, this one won't disappoint."
"Lookin' good--dark brown with a thick, lasting tan head. Smells of chocolate, carmel, and apples. Maybe a hint of cinnamon, too. It tastes of bittersweet, dark chocolate and honey. Carmel and apple tastes are there, but to a lesser degree. This is a fantastic beer! Very filling and very enjoyable!"
"Overall  one of my favourite oatmeal stouts highly recommended if you like this style"
"Very, very drinkable - just what you'd hope for in an Oatmeal Stout. The brewers have avoided some of the more aggressive notes that can tend towards burnt coffee or bitter chocolate and have instead created a brew which is classic: sweet, dark and creamy..."
"Appearance and Smell. Not completely black, there are ruby edges, and light can actually penetrate this beer if it is bright enough/viewed at the right angle. Head is modest, receding to a fine lace. Oddly enough, I know I've had some bottles that produced very little if any head, or lacing, although I don't remember the flavor ever suffering much due to this."
"Drinkability: An excellent oatmeal stout that people should try. Becareful when buying because it comes in a clear bottle and you don't know how long it's been sitting out."
"Drinkability is good for this style."
"(edit: Search for my post in the food & beer forum for Barbecue Stout Burgers. They were excellent with this brew.)"
"D&N: I had this one more than a decade ago on tap in Spain, this beer isn't even close to what it could be. I can't shake the skunkiness I smelled when I first opened this one. No head, average tastes, Not something I'd recommend."
"A drink to sink your teeth into. Drink it by itself or with hearty food that can stand up to it."
"poured a dedep, black almost opaque color. Smell is of coffee and expresso. Taste is enjoyable but nothing spectactular. Left a nice dry taste. Drinkable, but nothing above average. After reading all tghe great reviews, I was a bit disapointed. I've tasted better stouts."
"A damn tasty brew!"
"I can't wait to head south of the border again and pick up more of this incredible stout... 'cause it can't be found in CANADA !@#$%&*&$#@"""
"Mouthfeel: Refreshing! Not every stout is refreshing to drink. Some stouts are refreshing but too watery. This stout has an excellent balance of body and flavor. Drinkable and inviting."
"This is a smooth, well made beer, and an excellent example of the style."
"I should really drink more of this stuff. Appears a really dark color that I will now coin as ""pitch brown."" Basically as close as you can get to black without actually being totally black darkness... I think you all know what I mean. The brown head lasts and lasts til the beer is gone, all the way down my friends. Smell is totally sweet and creamy, which carries over to the taste. In addition to the milky sweet cream taste there's a nice roasted malt and cocoa taste, and a low bitterness profile. Whereas their imperial stout has that burnt bitter flavor, this one is all about the soft buttery taste. Mouthfeel is nice and I would even say thin for a stout, but that's the way I like my stouts, not chewy. That's not to say that this beer isn't hefty though. Sure is. A really superb beer that I'll remember next time I'm craving a good stout."
"The beer goes down fairly well. I think I will revisit this one someday soon, as I also get the feeling that this one will grow on you with time."
"Pours an opaque deepest brown color with a luxurious creamy beige colored head. Not much head retention or lacing, but a nice looking pint. Dark roasty, matly aroma with some cereal grain quality to it. No discernable hop aroma other than a mild earthiness. Mostly roasty and sweet, with some caramel, coffee, treacle and chocolate-like undertones. Torrefied oat is a garnish amongst the malt. The sweetness is maltose, almost bordering lactose. Somewhat bitter in the finish, maybe some Challenger in the kettle. Very drinkable. A quintessential example of a full-bodied, lower ABV oatmeal stout."
"Notes: I flipped a coin to determine which stout I would drink and which would be used as a marinade. Tadcaster Oatmeal Stout survived and Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout became the marinade for my rib eye, it was an enjoyable steak and it did go excellent with this one."
"Slàinte!"
"Pours a dark brown, deep red edges, with a tan foamy head lasting a few minutes; little lacing to space of. Delicious smells of milk chocolate and walnuts, cookies, cereal, interlaced with traces of vanilla. Taste of nutty molasses, toastiness, butterscotch and grassy hops, overall lightly sweet. Ends with bitter roasted coffee and a long dry finish. Softly carbonated and full bodied but wonderfully drinkable. I will definitely buy this again and would love to actually try it with ham and eggs."
"Absolute yum. Ultimately drinkable, a favorite."
"Pours a bitch black color with a giant light brown head. Smells very sweet, like chocolate and dark malts. The Taste! let me get to the taste! wow! Silky full bodies with strong chocolate and butterscotch flavors. Some coffee and oats too. A little bit of hop background. This beer is almost perfect! I could drink this beer for breakfast everyday!"
"550 ml bottle. This beer pours out very nearly black with a tan head. Rich, malty aroma. Slightly sweet malty flavor with some roastiness. This beer has an amazingly smooth mouthfeel, which I assume is from the oats. This is an incredible beer that I am especially partial to, as it is one of my first introductions to quality beer. I would recommend it as a good stout for the inexperienced stout drinker. Of course it's a great choice for the experienced drinker too."
"Not too bad of a brew. I think there are better oatmeal stouts out there."
"A very drinkable beer, these are made to be put back with abandon."
"A good oatmeal stout, but I was expecting more from such a highly rated beer. I would rather spend the money on the Troeg's or Barney Flats!"
"550 mL clear glass bottle. No freshness date."
"Pours a deep, dark brown with a two-finger tan head. Very nice. The beer's aroma has the usual coffee and chocolate notes found in most stouts, but there's a also fairly major fruity presense that pulls it all together. Normally I'm not a fan of fruit flavors in beer, but I like it here. It's not overpowering, and it's a nice compliment to the slightly sweet character of the oats and the chocolate flavors. The mouthfeel is very thick, just as an oatmeal stout should be. The finish could've used a little more bitterness, but it's not that bad. All things considered, this is a great beer. It's much more understated than Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout, and I like it better that way."
"Pours out to a dark brown / dark burgandy color. Dense brown foamy head was long lived, as was the sweet floral like aroma mixed with dark chocolate. Taste was smooth and rich, with complex flavors of coffee, oats and chocolate. Slightly sweet aftertaste hang around for a bit longer than I would like, but none the less, it was enjoyable. A reasonably priced beer for those looking for a heavier brew. This is probably the definitive Oatmeal Stout that is widely available today. Recommended."
"I'll definitely be getting more of these."
" Glad to know that some things don't change."
"What a delightful stout! A world classic. Very English tasting indeed. One word...Masterful."
"Drinkability and Overall: This is the classic Oatmeal Stout. While far from the best, this is an easily enjoyed beer, most suitable for a spring evening. The flavor seems like it would go with dessert well. This is a must try on your ""road to beer advocacy."""
"Samuel Smith makes consistently good beers and I now believe that they are the best in England."
"Overall very enjoayble; sadly I can only get this around Christmas time in the Samuel Smith gift box."
"This beer is made with the finest ingridients and has the taste to prove it. This may be the smoothest beer I have ever tasted. Samuel Smiths beers are very pricey but it is not hard to figure out why after you have tasted it! This is a great started beer, but unless you are Bill Gates I would not suggest drinking this all night. Great novelty item beer, a god beer to oh and ah beer mates. Try it if you can afford it :)"
"A damn fine beer all around. Samuel Smith's probably makes the best English beer. And the Oatmeal Stout is probably their best one. So good. Everyone should try this beer at least once."
"Good carbonation and medium to heavy body."
"pours very dark brown with a nice thick cream head that has exceptional retention and lacing. smells of malt, almost chocalety. The taste and mouthfeel are exceptional. It is as smooth as smooth can be, not all overpowering on the tastebuds, something that detracts me from some stouts. As far as drinkability goes, I say, ""Yes, please. I'll have another, and then another, and maybe one more after that!"""
"Pours out a very nice black beer with a big tan 3-4 finger head that lasts pretty good.Sweet fruity aroma thats quite pleasant.At first i wasnt sure about the taste of this beer,it was quite bitter ,but it may have been a bit too cold. As the beer warmed i really started liking it.Flavors are hard to pinpoint but definitely a nice coffee type in the background.Mouthfeel is just ok just a tad bit watery for a stout.A nice stout that ill be buying again."
"Overall, I'm *very* pleasantly surprised with this beer. I don't think I'd had it since I was a wee beer novice, and now I'm cursing myself for waiting so long to try it again. I will definately be going back to this very soon."
"Wow, this is an amazing beer. It pours a nice dark color. There was a very nice head which lasts for a long time. The small was of nice sweet malts. The mouthfeel was amazingly smooth, and the taste was exceptional. This is a stout which everyone must sample. Enjoy!"
"Poured a solid black with just a hint of red on the edges with a thick dark brown head. Smell was oaty goodness, chocolate, roasted malts, very inviting. Taste was more of the same, very good. It would have been a shame if this style had disappeared like it almost did. It has a very decadent creamy mouthfeel, similar to the Imperial Stout, but not as over-whelming. Drinking this all night would be a little bit much, but it is a great oatmeal stout."
"A little rich to drink more than one or two in a session, but you'll definately want to."
"Overall: Truly incredible, a remarkable stout which is tremendously complex. Very rich and heavy, so I think it would be quite a task to drink more than 2 bottles of this stuff."
"1/2 liter clear bottle. Pour reveals a dark black viscous ale with a tight pored mocha colored cap with great retention. Wonderful lacing. Nose fills with aromas of unsweetened chocolate, pine and some burnt toast. Wonderful thick, silky mouth feel....burnt cocoa, lactose, dried currents and figs, damp oak....wonderful complex body....finish is delightfully lingering where the smoothness of this ale is detected...no shrarp edges (acidic charred grain presence in some stouts) the oatmeal does its trick in the finish giving an impression of thick cream and tart cocoa. An oatmeal stout to be savored."
"I had this again after many years and it is still the same which is nice. Being a SS product I agian taste metals in the beer, but maybe that is just me. The color it pours is black comprised of red, looking though at the right angle shows the beers color of ruby so dark it becomes black. It makes sense as the stout is just a built up amber and this beer is a near perfect in color in my eye. The nose is a little lacking as the malt seems subdued, but there is a presences of earth roastedness and chocolate oats that escape. This has a great feel in the mouth of silky oat protiens that carry a roast bitterness that is delightful, still this beer has a metalic aftertaste that I couldn't seem to shake. It left lace all the way down my glass, it would be hard to make a better mild oatmeal stout."
"A mixture of every color except black. The aroma is deep yet mild. A subtle perfume of chocolate, vanilla, pit fruit, milk, wet leaves and currants. I love the creamy texture and the suprising full body. Rich, deep malts, nice chocolate, coffee, minimal but identifiable sourness and a nice pleasing hop bitterness on the finish. A lovely brew."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with a medium head that sticks around for a while and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is somewhat mild, but there are roasted malts and coffee in there. The flavor is nice and malty and creamy. Nice roasted malts flavor as well as some coffee and a hint of chocolate. Great mouthfeel. Really good beer."
"Beautiful dark pour with a thick tan head that clings to the glass. An earthy smell and a mixed taste of caramel, chocolate and nuts blasts the senses. This beer is extremely smooth going down and leaves an aftertaste of oats. This is a very drinkable beer and one that I will definitely add to my list of favorites."
"A very drinkable version of the style given how tasty and mild on the palate it is. One of my favorite oatmeal stouts. One I'd be happy to drink anytime."
"Pours a black color with ruby glints and a diminutive tan head. Lacing is a good webwork. The aroma is of caramalized sugar, chocolate and cappacino. The flavor is a complex mix of sweet malts. Theres lots of milk chocolate, brown sugar, coffee, cocoa and subtle fruit flavors. Hoppiness and burnt barley flavors are present but very minimal. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth with a velvet like fine carbonation. This is a very unique and delicious stout. Id imaginie milk stouts taste similar to this sweetish stout."
"Not my favorite style, but it's the first chilly day of Autumn we've had in this unseasonably warm Texas fall, and this makes a perfect accompaniment to the cold."
"The beer pours a nice black color with a finger of cream colored head. The nose is chocolate chip oatmeal cookies from the malt and the oatmeal, It smells really good. The oats are very present. The flavor is the flavor is good, with lots of chocolate in it. The mouthfeel is just a bit thin for my liking. Drinkability is good as well. Even without the cold having hit yet, I could easily drink a few of these. This doesn't fill me up too much, making it a nice beer."
"Terrific foamy mouthfeel. Goes down great for a stout."
"This beer pours a solid black with a foamy tan head. Smell is of yeasty esters with a grainy background. There is a hint of a vinous character in the smell, a characteristic of the yeast I think. Taste is smooth but rich and complex dry roasted maltiness with an earthy character and a hint of bittersweet. Full bodied yet smooth as silk. Excellent drinkablility, I could drink quite a few of these."
"Dark ruby burgundy, rather clear, under a voluminous three+ finger head that settled pretty quickly to half a pencil's worth of head for the duration., leaving a few spots of lace. Nice roasted nuts and raisin nose. The mouth is fairly flat and rather syrupy heavy. Nice smooth malt taste, with a distinct citrus sour element to balance the bready grain. A touch of smooth bitter hops struggle to emerge from the oatmeal blanket, and do leave some notes in the finish. The aftertaste is mostly raisin, with a touch of lemon. Maybe the bottle was light struck, but this was not the knock-out brew I had hoped for."
"Notes: This was a fairly solid beer that was a nice sweet alternative to the Sinebrychoff Porter, which I also enjoyed."
"Pours a nice dark smooth black. Very nice smooth sweet smell of nuttienes with a taste of dark malt with hints of chocolate and prunes and a slight hint of oatmeal. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth that supports a nice easy drinking stout. This beer is a classic."
"Drinkability  This is a good, heavy stout thats light on the oatmeal but well-balanced nevertheless."
"This beer pours dark and has a nice tan head that sits about a half inch tall. It smells like molasses, malt, and a little alcoholic. It has a great flavor. Tastes of malt, roasted barley, chocolate, and as it hits the back of you pallat you get that bitterness of the hops. I like the mouthfeel a lot. Good amount of carbonation and it coats the mouth nicely. This a very good beer and very drinkable overall. I would recommend to anyone. This is the first stout that I really got my girlfriend to enjoy and thats saying a lot because she is not a stout drinker at all."
"Very drinkable, especially in the Fall months when it's not cold enough to demand a stronger stout. Can't drink too many though as it can become quite filling."
"Drinkability: Given it's 'meal in a can' nature this isn't a good session beer but good every once and a while."
"This beer is black with hint of red-brown when held to a light. It has a very nice thick creamy head that is tan in color and lasts. The taste is of coffee and chocolate. It is mildly sweet but well balanced. This a very drinkable medium-full bodied beer."
"Also try: Rogue Shakespeare Stout (for a little more body; a truer stout)"
"Smell was a roasted, malty, nutty assault on the senses, taste followed suit with similar roasted, coffee, chocolate tastes. This is a full flavored beer, but far from perfect, I think the roasted taste creates a somewhat one dimensional brew due to it's overbearing nature, I didn't feel like drinking many of these, I needed a change up after the first one."
"Pours a deep dark brownish black in which a beautiful offwhite head appears and nicely laces the glass. Aromas are off roasted malts, some other sweet malts, and a tiny bit of hop. The taste of this beer is extremely malty, showing off a nice array of roasted and toasty flavors. Following a nice smooth and sweet oat flavor along with a slight molasses take hold which adds a complex sweetness to this brew. Finally this beer finishes with yet more roast flavors and just a bit of sweetness to keep things just perfect. This beer has a nice creamy texture to it with a nice medium body. Simply a great beer."
"This poured out a nice thick dark black with about half an inch of tan head. The head dropped fairly quickly and didnt leave much lace. Aroma is packed full of chocolate and malty goodness with a bit of coffee thrown in the mix. Very sweet and creamy tasting with chocolate standing at the forefront and a roasted malt and coffee flavor blending in. A good blend of bitterness and sweetness balances this out fairly well with sweetness being more dominate, the finish is slightly bitter and dry. Mouthfeel was a good medium body and creamy feel to it. Very good drinkability as I had no problem downing a few of these. Excellent Oatmeal stout that I would recommend to anyone."
"Taste is very sweet and smooth. Minimal carbination makes this so easy to consume. Very deep flavors and a drinkability that is hard to compare as far as stouts. Just the right amount of bitterness underneath the sweet flavors."
"A good example of the style, mabye a little sweet but that is the style, full of flavour"
"Pours out a nice, dark brown... bordering on black. A milk-chocolate colored head rapidly appeared (fairly aggressive pour) and built to a very thick, fluffy mass. It slowly settled to a nice collar with some excellent lacing. This head survived several swirls. The aroma is good. Smelled something of oats, chocolate malt, and faint hops. Very pleasant, but not overwhelming. Taste was very rich with a complex development of oats, chocolate malt, and other darkly roasted malt flavors. Starts sweet, then finishes with a touch of hop bitterness for balance. Excellent! Mouthfeel was every so slightly thinner than I expected, though it did not seriously hurt the beer. Slightly higher than expected carbonation, but again, not so much as to be terribly distracting. This is truly an excellent stout to be enjoyed whenever the mood strikes! I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the style."
"I could drink this all the time, good stuff."
"The mouthfeel shows an incredible smoothness; this beer is so enjoyably creamy. But at the same time it remains greatly light and drinkable, with a very pleasing level of carbonation. The finish is sweeter and more ""aired"" than I expected, the beer's almost breathing in my mouth. Great."
"This is a very good stout. Its color is a dark brown, with a brownish white head. The head is deliciously frothy when I take my first sip, and it remains for the whole pint. This defining characteristic of the taste is toastiness. There are hints of chocolate and slight hints of coffee, as no flavor dominates. This is a smooth and well-balanced stout that I could drink several of in one sitting."
"Head is giant and creamy. Very full earthy aroma, can't help but noticed something off. Is it alcohol I smell? Taste is a fine mix of rolled oats and unsweetened chocolate. Nuttiness moves into a bitter sweet after taste that is unrewarding. Feels fuller in the mouth than it looks in the glass."
"This was the first drink I had on the night of our wedding reception. This was just what I needed to start out the fabulous night. Beautiful mollasses black color with super fluffy head that lasted forever. The taste was rich in toasted nut and chocolate and finished very crisp! This is a fantastic and very smooth tasting oatmeal stout. Two Thumbs Up!!"
"Would get a higher score if the palate didn't mimic the nose so badly. More roast and malt flavours would be good. Otherwise, a really enjoyable stout!"
"The body is medium-heavy with nice carbonation. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy at the start and finishes creamy and dry. The roasted malt and sweetness lasts shortly on the tongue.A great drinking brew."
"Dark brown nearly opaque color with a small tan head. Smell is of roasted malts, brown sugar, with a little of coffee and chocolate notes. Taste is slightly sweet and malty with dark roast (maybe a bit smoky) flavors. Again, notes of coffee and chocolate, but they are not dominant. Some alcohol warming detected, even though this is only a 5% ABV beer. Flavors are smoother and more pronounced when letting the beer warm a little. A little hop bitterness provides balance. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, although a bit thinner than expected from an oatmeal stout, but it still manages to leave a thin coating on the glass and in your mouth. I think one of these makes a great dessert (someone else suggested with vanilla ice cream... I'll have to try that!) This is a wonderful stout! One of my favorites!"
"Final Thought: This is really hard to beat, one of the best beers available on the market."
"An opaque dark brown color, just about black. It is topped by a frothy, creamy brown head. Thick malty aromas mixed with burnt toast, expresso, toffee, and chocolate are all found in the nose. The taste is sweet, creamy, chocolately, and slightly viscous. I get notes of milk chocolate, and espresso. There is a bitter component that is derived from the roasted malt, but it is not enough to balance the sweetness that is found in this beer. For some reason I was expecting a bit more out of this beer. It is quite decent but seems a little dumbed down, which makes sense given this beer wide availibility & popularity."
"the pour, although very dark and heavy varies from your average stout at the head. instead of the creamy, white head you get a fizzy, coffee toned volatile one which emanates scents of coffee, naturally, and malt, as well as some bitterness to it. The taste was rather impressive because, beyond the feel of coffee in it, this beer reminded me, strangely, to the german Rauchbiers, as the mouthfeel and taste were strongly smoked, with some meaty taste to it- pleasant, certainly, but unexpected."
"Very good beer, only major obstacle to drinkability is cost."
"This beer poured a very dark mocha black, with a tan beigh mocha head that was a froth of a monster. Very thick and creamy. Smell was very roasted and smoked, not very oatmeal/grain at all to speak of, picked up a little wood and bark smell? Taste was of dark fresh roasted coffee with chocolate fudge, the sweet fullbodied creaminess was a perfect blen with the subtleness of the hops. Full bodied and creamy in the mouth, flavorfully smooth, I would drink this any chance I get. Great for after a meal and great with vanilla ice cream if you like using your beer other ways."
"A lovely offering. God Bless England!"
"This stout produces a fairly good head with a nice tan-brown color...would live to try it by draught but the bottle is nothing to sneeze at!"
"Near-black color with a super-thick caramel-colored root beer float-size head. Not much of an aroma but a good strong roasted oatmeal flavor with a creamy chocolate malty base. A bit chewy and creamy at the same time, a surprisingly high level of carbonation. Good mouthfeel with a slight caramel finish. This would go well with a fine cigar. Not the top of the oatmeal stout chain but one of the better ones you might be able to find in your neighborhood."
"Ah, my first stout, I'm still trying to figure out exactly what I think about it. First off, this is some seriously dark beer, its almost pitch black. The aroma is nice, a little sweet, but not overpowering. SInce this is my first stout, I don't have much to compare to, but I do enjoy the taste. This beer starts off really smooth in my mouth and leaves a nice, mildly sweet aftertaste. Overall, I can definently tell that this is a good brew, but I'm still not sure if stout is a style that I really like. I'll probably have to try this again with some food to see what happens. I can definently tell this isn't something I'd want to drink a whole lot of in one sitting."
"So great, so dark. This beer doesn't speak of evil though. So much flavor, I'm at a loss. A beer to try, you must. You will not be disapointed with the flavor, if you love a black beer. It has so much more character than a stout of any kind, yet lets you feel like you already ate breakfast. This beer is worth the investment. A great cold weather friend. This is an amazing beer."
"Drinkability - super stuff, low abv, I could drink it again and again and again!!!"
"This is a tasty, harmless stout, but its light body and somewhat mild flavor make me wonder what all the fuss is about. I like it, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't make much of a statement, really."
"Overall a very solid stout, and one I would definitely enjoy to revisit."
"I think this is a good beer to to turn people on to stouts."
"Very dark brown body with a thin beige head. Just like the mcneills oatmeal stout, you can grab the oatmeal just by smelling. Deep malt profile full of chocolate, licorice, brown sugar sweetness and something powdery alike flour. There's no mistake on the tongue, this is a sweet stout, with caramelic peaks, tons of oatmeal, some powder sugar perhaps and nevertheless a great balance due to subdued english hops. Silky medium body, highly quaffable, definitely the most obvious definition of the style I've faced. On the other hand, it never comes close to approaching the imperial stout in terms of complexity."
"I could drink quite a few of these if I could find them. I think it'd go well with a roast."
"Drinkability: They seldom come any better than this. If heaven has beer...it's probably a lot like this."
"Poured a pitch black with small tan head. Aroma was a little bit faint but notes of malt and chocolate were notable. The taste is huge on roasted malts. A smokey chocolate character is present, but this is a pretty well balanced beer. No flavors were too strong or really propelled me to ponder this brew any further. I can see this as a nice session brew. It's a nice staple to have close by at all times and it's available in all types of places. It would be on my must try list."
"Aroma was not strong (I had the wrong kind of glass), but it was chocolatly (bitter European dark chocolate, not wimpy American milk chocolate) and my friend correctly noted ""smoky"". In fact, smoky look, smoky aroma, smokey flavor. Wonderful. Other flavors included almost a meaty quality, although there was some sweetness and chocolate. Mouthfeel was moderately creamy, with a very nice body, and drinkability was right on. An excellent brew!"
"Nice black,black beer with a great chocolatey tan head that lingers with some nice lacing all the way down the glass.Wonderful aroma of chocolate,brown sugar and a hint of coconut?DAMN!!!What a flavor-nice roasted notes but not astringent.Nutty,chocolate and a hint of caramel.Silky smooth-slides right across the palate and down.An amazingly quaffable beer-one you could enjoy even in the heat of summer.Quite a brew."
"I highly recommend this beer to anyone, especially those that enjoy dark beers. guinness is crushed by this beer, and while i still enjoy guinness, i will quickly grab the samuel smith oatmeal stout anytime."
"I'm not usually fond of stouts, but I definitely would make an exception for another one of these."
"Good starter beer for macro-freaks, but otherwise avoidable except for dessert settings. Might make a good beer ice-cream dessert."
"When I was a young associate attorney at a big downtown law firm, I loved Starbuck's coffee. When you are expected to bill 2500 hours a year, a good caffeine jolt in the early morning is great. I realize now that I am older (and hopefully wiser), that my Starbuck's obsession was not so much because of the great flavor of the coffee, but that the buzz from said coffee was so intense that it made it seem better than it actually was. Add to that the fact that those coffees were 6 bucks a pop, and it really puts into perspective what a bunch of hype and elevated expectations can do for a drink. So goes the SS Oatmeal Stout. The head on this beer is nominal. The taste is OK, the smell is phenomenal. Overall, this beer is good, but not great. It will give you a good buzz, and tastes delicious. The aroma is fantastic, and the color is darker than Darth Vader. I still think that it's high listing is a self-fulfilling prophecy, though. There is no way this beer is better than Chimay."
"Pours out like a black coca cola. A foamy cream brown head, some lacing. Soft aroma of molasses and roasted malt, slightly sharp, like black coffee. This is a thin stout, much thinner than Guiness. It has a mildly carbonated mouthfeel, some sweetness and a mixture of (as they kindly explain to you on the label) (baker's) chocolate and cherries. Oats are present, as is an acidity, and undertones of molasses and coffee. After taste is earthy, mildly Guiness-like and softly sweet."
"Picked up a bomber sized bottle at the local grocery store for $2.79. This black beer poured a fine head that left a nice lacing down my 22 oz glass. Very sweet smelling for a stout. This is an extremely smooth stout, very interesting and complex. The oatmeal must make it smooth. The mothfeel wasn't as thick as advertised. This was a very enjoyable brew, one I have had on and off over the years."
"This is a beer that eats like a meal; wow this is a filling brew. Over all for me it is a classic and another fantastic offering from Samuel Smiths. This brew is what I use to judge all other oatmeal stouts by. Simply fantastic!"
"The pour into my Samuel Smith imperial pint glass reveals this beer to be dark dark black, with a nice thick dark head. It smells sweet, with hints of caramel/butterscotch, but without being too overbearing. The sweet flavor is yummy. It's not syrupy, but there is a roasted taste with caramel notes and a definite dry roasted aftertaste with the lingering sweetness following at the very end. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but still good. Carbonation does not get in the way, but complements the roasted finish. This one goes down well, I could drink it all night."
"I was excited about trying this too, but ended up being disappointed. The smell was strong of vinegar and slight fruit (cherries) behind it. Taste was good, very complex for a stout, but too influence by the smell. Maybe another bad bottle for me, I don't know. There are better stouts out there, at better prices."
"drinkability:I really enjoy this beer,I would describe it as a nice sipping beer,great on a cold night! also this is probably the best stout I have tried. I like it much more than Guiness. if you like stouts I would recommend trying this one."
"Pours pitch black, but not as thick as some of its counterparts. A nice, beefy dark tan head, with noticeable carbonation. Smells almost chocolately. Tastes delicious with a chocolate, but not too dark taste. This beer goes down so smooth. I could drink maybe 2 or 3 of these, but they are quite filling so I would prefer to savour each one. A fantastic beer! Glad I got the opportunity to try it."
"Large clear bottle, pours black with a manly dark tan head, ecxellent head retention and nice foamy lacing. Sweet roasted malt in the nose. Smooth malt, toasted malt and burnt malt. Chocolate, cafe au lait and cocoa notes. Some chalky hops in the finish. Smooth, silky, coating mouthfeel. This one is wonderful to savor and enjoy. I enjoyed some spicy BBQ chicken and a piece or two of chocolate with this one. A fine brew, go out and get some."
"Poured out ink black with some decent amount of head on this beer. Gotta be careful with those gold wrappings around the cap, a little piece fell into my beer. Smell consisted of some sweet malts, chocolate, coffee, and some creaminess of some sorts. Taste is very good. So silky smooth and creamy. Almost like buttery chocolate in your mouth. It's so good. This beer barely had a chance to get to room temperature, it was gone before I knew it. It's true what the others say, this is an amazing beer. Always keep a 4 pack of this beer in your fridge/cellar. One of the best beers out there."
"This stout pouts as black as night. There is a thick large bubble foam head. The head last for aroma time and dwindles down to nothing. The aroma is a sweet and sticky. Hints of coffee and molasses are present along with roasted malts. The taste is smooth and a bit creamy leaving a smooth feeling across the pallet. The sweetness of the molasses comes across with a nice roasted malt flavor and a sweet finish. One fine brew. Cant understand why I waited so long to try this one."
"Paired interestingly with young French Brie cheese. It seemed to bring out the hardness of the water and add a metallic sourish tinge to the taste. The earthiness of the brie brought out the sweet fruitiness of the yeast and malts."
"Great beer. Great nose, little funky, lots of character, kinda leathery but more appealing than that. Good rich flavor, a bit funky, really satisfying. Good chocolate malt flavor with the rich earthy funk really make this beer enjoyable. Could be a little sweeter or something to up the mouthfeel, but other than that, I really enjoy it."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, a frothy tan head forms on top of a barely translucent dark mahogany liquid. The head was impressively sized, and showed good staying power. Nice strong aroma, mainly of heavy dark malts, and the taste echos that, with the hearty taste associated with those grains. An aftertaste lingers of chocolate, with a slight undertone of coffee as well. A thoroughly enjoyable stout."
"Poured beautifully, nice dark black. Provides a 2-3 finger head, nice and soapy. Head lasts a good while. When held up to light, produces a nice red-brown. Smells like molasses cookies, sweet but not overpowering. Medium mouthfeel surprisingly. Not too heavy, but assertive. Strong molasses taste, but hops keep sweetness in check. Great beer, could definitely put a few back if it were just a little less expensive."
"One of my all time favorite beers. Thick and black with a tan head I alway think of it as a grown-up's Guinness. It has a wonderful roasty taste that is almost over-powering, but falls short and disappears into a smooth sweetness that reminds me of milk stouts. I have been drinking this beer longer than any other craft beer and it has yet to disappoint me. It feels appropriately thick and rich and really just satisfying. I don't think any stout lover would have difficulty putting quite a few of these away."
"Super drinkable. I don't normally really like Stout beer; this brew changed my point of view on this style of beer."
"Poured into my glass to produce a giant creamy head - I had a Pavlovian response almost immediately. The beer had a deep, mahogany appearance, with maybe a bit of red coloring if the light hit it just so. Smell was inviting - a warm, malt smell and some dark fruit smells on top. The flavor was beautifully full, and maintains dimension without being overly complex. There is a wonderul sweetness that accompanies this beer. The roof of my mouth hummed with bitter while the tongue smiled in sweetness. Great beer - but what else can we expect from Sammy Smith."
"Chocolate brown. dense, and sticky body that is not quite opaque with ruby red highlights when held up to the light. Thick tall khaki head formed easily and receded to a quarter inch thick layer of bubbles on top of the beer. Wonderful lacing and head retention and medium carbonation. Smells like lightly roasted grains, caramel, and honey. Flowery hops with very mild bitterness. Taste leans definitely towards toward the fruity sweet end of the spectrum, with a mixture of plums, raisins, and cherries. Warming and soothing with a mouthfeel that is a bit thinner than most stouts. A restrained sweet stout that is easy to drink."
"Bottle  Poured a pitch-black brew with a nice dark foamy head. Aroma is very sweet with linger of maltness. Taste is very sweet with some coffee and chocolate. No strong aftertaste or bitterness. This is a very creamy, easy beer. You can go wrong with that oatmeal stout if youre a fan of the style."
"The drinkability is great, yeah it's roasted like most stouts are but the oatmeal makes it so smooth you can just sit back, relax and enjoy this one."
"Lots of sweet, roasted malt in this baby. Sweet but not cloying, with just a touch of bitter hops to finish. Clear, clean chocolate and coffee flavours make this a wonderfully toothsome beer. Good intro for a newbie stout drinker"
"Overall a wonderful oatmeal stout, a must try"
"Velvety dark coffee brown with a creamy tan head. The nose has that distinct Sam Smith sweet yeast smell, along with sweet roasted malts. Taste is smooth, moderately sweet, with mellow roasted malts throughout. Also some fruitiness (like all SS beers). Delicious. Good smooth feel, if maybe a tad watery. Very drinkable; I just wish it was cheaper!"
"This is supremely drinkable beer that I'm enjoying immensely. Here's the short version of this review: Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout is a widely available, easy drinking, delicious version of an oatmeal stout and is one that will always have a place in my beer fridge."
"The drinkability is this stout's weak link in my humble estimation. Certainly something to nurse for a while and enjoy the nuances of as it warms."
"Top of the line Oatmeal Stout."
"Not as chewy and more drinkable thant St. Ambroise. Dark brown with sudsy head. Drink your oatmeal! Taste is strong in-you-face. Almost thought it was a higher alcohol content. Nice with my roast beef lunch. Had a second almost two years later and my mates didn't like it, but I liked understated stout taste."
"I picked up the bomber at the Eats Ave. Wegman's. It poured a deep black colour with the perfect head of a dark tan hue. The smell was of coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, and a slight bit of hops. The taste was wonderful with the taste of chocolate ant coffee being the strongest part of it. There was also hints of roasted grains and malts. Just the right amount of hops were also added were I could taste them, but not too much. It went down smooth. Maybe too smooth because I want more."
"The beer pours as dark as a moon less night, black as a Raven, darker than the inside of a cow, I think you get the picture, head is Bunyanesque in size, spumous in texture and a toothsome light tan in color, as it ever so slowly dematerializes, the resultant lace a thick and glutinous blanket to obscure the glass. Ah that smell, rich sweet malt, toasted grains, coffee, earthy, sweet milk chocolate, a treat for the ocular and olfactory sense, start is ambrosial and rich in malt with the top middling in feel. Finish is benignly carbonated, the hops delectable and the aftertaste a blend of malts, hops and toasted grains, quite dry and pleasant, a long time favorite stout that never fails to please, and one that always occupies my DBF."
"Looks like most other stouts. Near pitch black, opaque liquid, with a tan head. The flavor really blows me away. Huge coffee, chocolate, and vanilla flavors. This is maybe the most flavorful Stout I have come across. Definitely a dessert beer, that I could not even think about sessioning. This is one that has a lot going on, and improves as it warms."
"John"
"If only it were socially acceptable to drink your breakfast, this would replace eggs and bacon, or scrapple, for me. It's just sweet enough to be a treat, with plenty of peripheral notes to intrigue the palate. It's full and earthy, never cloying, and so wonderfully refreshing. Despite its considerable heft, the lower ABV helps make it delightfully fresh and drinkable."
"Balck wonderful brew with nice foamy tan head that falls to nice tan ring following the beer down. Smells of roasted malts, oats good earthy smelling brew of substance. Taste is perfect roasted malt, sweet oats with hints of coffee, chocolate, carmel and more sweet wonderful brew with touch of bitterness at the end to bring eveything together perfectly. Mouthfeel is great, you could almost live on this beer alone my favorite stout as of present can't imagine getting much better then this. Why can't all beer be this good?"
"Pours with a light brown, one-fingered head, fades soon and leaves little lace. Light-medium carbonation. Deep red/amber color. Nose is a light roasted coffee. Heavy bodied, beefy malty/hoppy taste but has a sweetness to it, very smooth, very drinkable; $8.99 for a 4-pack of 12oz. Also $3 for a 550ml bottle from Northend Superette Manchester, NH."
"The aroma was pleasant, and the taste was amazing."
"Overall, a solid oatmeal stout - perhaps a bit overpriced (at least in my local market)."
"Well done. I'll definitely be having more of this in the future."
"Overall, this surprised me with its mellowness and drinkability. This is a myriad of flavors and textures, and to anybody who says they don't like beer I would point them toward this one. A classic."
"Taste didn't wow me to the level that this beer is ranked. Good, to be sure; smooth dark toast mingles with a more subdued roasty malt flavor. On the sweet side, and finishes with another hint of marshmallow. Only mild bitter tones as the glass warms to room temperature. A little too thin and mild mannered. I like stouts to be heavy, chewy and assertive; this meets none of those criteria."
"I am a fan of Oatmeal Stouts and this one an all around good stout. I highly recommend it. The taste is great and unlike some beers you can spend your time on it without it tasting awful on the last bit."
"As a stout lover this is one of my favorites. Looks very dark and rich in flavor. An off white creamy head full of complex aromas. Alcholic and sweet are the two that stand out to me. Very rich tasting but much lighter than other stouts Ive had. It starts off very rich and creamy and finishs slightly dry. An Excellent beer."
"The first thing that struck me about this stout was the aroma, Very complex, almost sweet, with what I thought could have been vanilla among other things. The #1 surprise was the texture and consistency of this beer, I was expecting something much thicker, more like guiness, and boy was I surprised, a much smoother, lighter consistency with a great taste and just enough flavor to let you know you are drinking something quality without being over whelming. It took me more time to get a good overall sense of this stout then I would have expected, a compliment to the complexity of the flavor."
"I find it hard to rate any stouts higher than this."
"Not a session brew but very nice for dining."
"Looks nice, with a fluffy light-brown head. Smells pretty funky, some plasticity and acidity. Flavor starts nice enough, although too sweet for my liking. Good molasses in there with the roasted grains. Finish is pretty bad, kind of like what I think varnish would taste like. Although I admire the distinctness of this brew and its fermentation flavors, I find it to be very unpleasant. Poor aroma and poor finish. How is this rated so high? I would like to see people's thoughts on this in blind taste tests so that there is no bias towards this popular brewery."
"I had this a few nights ago at a tavern in the 355 ml bottle and wasn't impressed (old, musty, excessively yeasty). But I decided to give it another shot for this review, and picked up a 550 ml bottle from a different establishment. So: pours a deep, deep brown; basically black at the center; rosewood/chestnut highlights appear when brew is held to light. Not much of a head on first pour, just a thin film of foam... a more vigorous pouring on the second attempt revealed an off-white to tan, dusky head about two fingers deep that eventually settled slightly. And the aroma... what a difference there was between this bottle and my previous sample! So much fresher, with a pleasant smell of fresh bread, rolled oats and a raisiny touch up front, sustained by a pervasive cream sherry sweetness throughout. The flavor continues the trend: more distinct cream sherry tones accompany a dark (almost pumpernickel?), oatmealy midpalate while remaining subtle and light. Suggestions of black bread, prunes, and puffed wheat cereal round everything out, punctuated by a bit of English hop dryness. Near perfect mouthfeel. Creamy and light, stunningly silky and smooth, but also tingly, dry, and warming... almost distributes itself across the palate without you even trying. Nowhere near the density I expected from such mealy flavors and aromas. Drinkability is hampered (if you can call it that) only because the brew is deeply satiating and filling--a beer to be savored and slowly digested--a bottle at a time will be enough. Tasty; soothing. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Obviously a tremendous stout. The oatmeal takes some of the more exciting stout edges off IMO, but if this is all I can find to complain about, I'm in heaven."
"One word comes to mind when I drink this brew...smoothe! This beer poures a dark dark brown with just a little light being able to sneak through the edges and a nice tan head that leaves a nice lace down to the last drop. The smell has hints of roasted toffee and carmel and a little bit of coffee scent as well. The taste is out of this world, not only is is the smoothest stout you could ask for, it tastes just as it smells with a carmel, toffee and coffee flavor but with just the right ammount of sweetness to round it out. This is a great dark beer to give someone to introduce them to the stout/porter style."
"It's been a while since I've had one, and I had forgotten how wonderful this beer is. The usual complaints about the clear bottles not withstanding, Samuel Smith has always been one of my favorites. While not my favorite from them, this one is still a top notch brew. As has been mentioned before, this is great intro stout for those looking to delve into the style."
"Poured from a clear 12 oz bottle. Quite a surprise to find the bottle clear, but the top is foil wrapped and the pour is a very dark brown. Thick beige head eventually calms down to reveal a bit of the cherry color on the outside rim that was noted by some other reviewers. Don't know where that cherry hue comes from, but it makes for an exceptional appearance. Dark malts and chocolate dominate the nose, but there are hints of fresh baked bread and cooked oatmeal. Smooth, full bodied and filling in the mouth. Taste is of a well balanced stout that ehoes the nose. Very tasty. I took my time with this one because it's just too good to finish(it's my only one). One of the best that I've reviewed. My only complaint is a somewhat unpleasant syrupy aftertaste, but I guess that goes with the territory. Can't wait to get some more of these. I like oatmeal, stouts, and English brews, so a quality oatmeal stout like this is very seductive to my senses and perspective, as well as my sense of perspective."
"Drinkability: world class. one of the best oatmeal stout sin the world, hands down."
"Overall Impression: Hard to figure how such a heavy, rich tasting beer comes off as light and refreshing. This is an excellent beer all around, and a personal favorite, but that odd metallic bottoming out spot is a bit distracting. It may be due to my unorthodox storage, or I may have let this one go a bit longer than I should have. Beautiful balance, wonderful quality, chug-ability, just about everything you could want in a beer. Scratches every beer itch I have. Strongly recommended."
"Not a chugging or partying beer!"
"I bought a 550ml bottle for $2.99. It poured a very dark brown, much like the imperial stout. Much sweeter taste. Less fruiter than the imperial which tasted like raisins. This is sweet yet subtle in the oatmeal flavor. A very dark malt is present in this one. I drink it alot at Phish concerts, and it is a favortie choice at home. I do like the imperiral stout more, however."
"This stout has a sharp, ""bite"" to it, with the mild stouty oat flavor. Delicious to drink for sampling and for those Friday nights. It's flavor is different than other oatmeals and is more highly recommended for those wanting to try an oatmeal. It captures the essence of oatmeals without the taste disappearing due to nitrous cans."
"I could consider this a ""comfort beer"". I'm going to miss it when it is gone."
"Highly recommended, this is a GREAT beer."
"Very complex and tasty, but I think it's a little overhyped."
"What can I say about this one that hasn't already been said. I will add a few things that stand out in my mind. Increadible silky mouthfeel. I find it to have a smoked or chared malt flavor to it as venom stated but also some really peaty undertones like a Scotish ale. Also did notice a red wine finish in its dryness. Awesome any way you slice it."
"Ah, this puts most other Oatmeal Stouts to shame. Smooth, silky, lots of coffee and chocolate flavors coming through with a light hop touch to keep you looking for another. I enjoyed this with some steamers on a recent night out. In fact, I enjoyed two. Nothing over the top about this beer, just plain fantastic."
"Notes: Six thumbs up."
"the thing that really got me about this beer was it's aftertaste that lingers and transforms from one great thing into another. maybe more experienced beer lovers get that from alot of differant beers, but for me it was the first time. another thing a like about this beer is it's drinkablity, tons of flavor, but light in the mouth and in the stomach. i'm used to drinking Guiness Extra Stout for my stout fix. this beer is a welcomed change."
"I have to fall in line with just about everyone else on this one.The tempting darkness of the brew is gothicly beautiful, as is the teasing carmel oatmeal aroma.Sweet carmelly aste floats right with you for the entire glass.Bitterness never showed its face. I thought the mouthfeel was just a little to high charged, but that just made it a thirst quencher, instead of just a sipping beer."
"Notes: Exceptional stout, and one of my new favorite beers. Find it, drink it, and sing its praises. It's that good, and should appeal to almost every type of beer drinker."
"If you haven't tried this one yet, you should already be on your way to the store."
"Probably one of the best oatmeal stouts I've ever tried. Perfect balance, excellent flavor. Absolutely world class."
"This oatmeal stout poured thick Into the glass thick and heavy. when the glass settled I could see the thick black smoke like body and the supper chunky tan head. the head kind of slithered down the glass as i drank, It was almost a meal in itself. the almost spice aroma jumped up and bit me. the first sip was almost heavy it was thick and full of flavor, rich malty with just a hit of bitter balanced out well. The finish was almost dry. a little to heavy to drink all night, butt good all-around!!"
"Black color. Very thick full cascading type head. Aroma is roasted malts and chocolates. A nice silky smooth. Medium bodied sweet stout. Mild malts and hops. A very flavorful beer. Nice chocolate and coffee flavor. Well balanced. Just wish it were in a brown bottle. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter and a touch dry. What a sweet/Oatmeal stout should be"
"Drinkability: It's a meal in a bottle, to be sure, so it's not one you'll be having too much in one sitting, but you'll definitely want to have more of this. And make sure you don't serve it too cold, dagnabbit!"
"This is one of the most delicious beers I'd had. All the elements are here for a truly great beer. Expertly crafted and so very easy to drink. A great way to finish the day."
"Appearance: Textbook pour with a full two fingered tan head to complement the deep ruby almost black color of this magnifcant beer full even rings of lacing nice. Aroma: Deep chocolate tone with a biscuity edge to it and fruit ridden coffee tones what a complex oat filled aroma awesome beer here folks. Taste: Creamy milk tones with fruit and robust coffee and chocolate textures a mild taste of alcohol presence running through it just so easily balanced this beer is tops in the style. Mouthfeel is fluffy the body has increased texture due to the oatmeal this is perfected. Drinkability: Smooth creamy easliy imbibed a must try that not matter the price tag next time I'm in the mood for a Oatmeal Stout this is my choice."
"Drinkability: MORE PLEASE!"
"One of the better stouts I have tasted. Wish there was more than one other oatmeal stout in Maine to compare it with."
"Damn good beer! Drank this delicious offering with a rib eye, and some fresh veggies from the farmers market here in Chicago on a beautiful early September day and it was like matching a fine wine with food! From the get go this beer showed its colors. Deep, nearly black with red tones around the edges. The smell and taste made me think of oatmeal chocolate chip cookies that I baked as a kid. The mouthfeel was velvety, creamy and very easy to enjoy. Taste wise I found ample stoutlike qualities-chocolate, mocha etc, yet this one had that oatmeal thing going that perhaps gave it the complexity to make it just a bit more unique that other stouts. I thought this to be a very rewarding food beer, and recommend it for that next rib eye off the grill."
"Baeutiful creamy head, with exceptional sticky lacing. Smell had an alcohol aroma with smoky undertones. Taste a nice complex blend of fruity, smoky ingredients. I was somewhat surprised at the sense of alcohol for a 5.0 abv...Medium, chewy mouthfeel that invites you to sip, not guzzle. Not my very favorite, but for the type an excellent offering."
"Love it when the hops are minimal, this is the one that re-started the style."
"If you can buy this straight out of the case, it will be one of the best oatmeal stouts you will ever drink. It has been sitting in a sixpack or loose, spend your money elsewhere."
"Pours dark black with very little head and that distinctive oatmeal smell. Upon tasting, that oatmeal is the first thing that I noticed. The beer is quite sweet and malty, and I noticed a burnt peanut-ty taste. Yes, it's a dark stout, but it was very easy to drink. I had this with my dessert, and it was a fantastic finish to my meal. I suspect it works well with most sweet foods. Overall, an excellent beer."
"Simply the best oatmeal stout out there. So rich and delicious that I could drink this one all night."
"Overall it's just such an amazing beer. Like a backwoods country stout. Earth, fruit, smoke and soft dark sugary malts. No wonder it's so popular among phishheads. A great beer."
"I think the best of the oatmeal stouts out there,pours a deep brown with a nice tan colored head that sticks very well.The aroma is very much like brown sugar and and roasted malt.The taste also has a brown sugar taste but a little more subdued with a nice roasted coffee taste ending nice and soft.Drinking this beer is a beer lovers experience."
"A very tasty beer. Bought a bottle at Huckleberry's. Poured a deep, dark brown with a big tan head that hung around for a while. Smelled of caramel, brown sugar and dark fruit. Taste was a velvety smooth dollup of mildly toasted malt, caramel and brown sugar, finishing with a slight hoppyness accompanied by a mildly raisiny taste. Mouthfeel is not as creamy as, say, a Guinness, but still nice. This beer is initially easy to drink, but one winds up slowing down because its very filling, otherwise I'd give higher marks for drinkability. I'm currently re-thinking my plan to go out and scare up a dinner (its too hot to cook right now in Spokane)."
"This was my first oatmeal stout. I am always weary of the clear bottles from Samuel Smith. This poured a dark dark dark dark brown with a nice tan head. The aroma was nice and full. The taste was the same. Between Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout and their Imperial Stout you can have breakfast and dinner. Oatmeal for breaksfast and Imperial for dinner."
"A beautiful brew from Sam Smith. Surprise, surprise, this guy is black, very black, in the glass! A nice looking, but slight tan head caps it off. Smell is of slight, roasty coffee/espresso, but is not overwhelming. Taste is pretty much the same as it smells, with possible hints of chocolate added to the mix. As with the smell, not too strong. The mouthfeel of this one is delightful! Very smooth, milky, and creamy on the palate. Only reason its not a 5 in my book, is that it could be just slightly thicker. The drinkability on this one is among the very best of stouts in my opinion. I could easily drink these all day!!"
"pours out a dark brown/black with a nice biscuit sized brown sticky head. aromas of malt, roasted coffee and caramel/soemthing sweet come through. the taste is a little sweet with a nice malt flavour, hints of coffee come through with some caramel/buttery toffee and something i cant quit place. the mouthfeel is nice, smooth and not too thickm just right with the pefect carbonation. drinkability is high because its just so damn smooth and enjoyable. the slightly sweet flavor is something i love and the somewhat normal/low ABV keeps you from stumbling around after a few. when your in the right mood (morning, desert, night cap), this is an amazing beer."
"I didn't detect much aroma in this beer. it has a fairly benign taste. Not bad, but nothing special. I'll have to rerate this one at some point"
"I just wish it came in a 4 pack or , hell, even a 6 pack."
"This beer poured a tan head with small-medium sized bubbles. The hue of this beer was brown and there was fair lacing on the sides of my glass. The nose was hoppy with this beer and it had a smooth mouthfeel which is much to my liking.A good Stout in my opinion."
"edit: I have had this one a few times recently and it has definitely become one of my favorites. Also, the oatmeal taste is more prevalent now. I upped my ratings to correspond with how I feel about this stout now."
"Beautifiul frothy thin tan head that leaves lace on my glass sitting atop a completely black beer. Aroma is of creamy oats with a slight noble hop accent. Flavor is of carmel malt and roast barley with a thick oatmeal finish highlighted by a slight noble hop balance. The body is heavy yet this beer finishes with a malty sweetness. Very nice stout that is not sour like guinness but rather it is creamy, flavorful, and sweet."
"Overall a really enjoyable experience, one of my favorites."
"To summarize: this maybe isn't my absolute favourite stout, but in all the stouts I've had, this one strikes the balance between amazing quality and popular drinkability. That is, I think most of my friends would be a little overwhelmed by, say, Shakespeare Stout, but they'd really appreciate this one."
"And here is the always yummy Sammy Smith's Oatmeal. This is the first stout other than Guinness that I ever tried. It's the first beer that got me into drinking better beer. I owe this beer a lot. It's the best beer to come out of a clear bottle, that's for sure. Nowadays, I'd have to say I prefer the Imperial Stout offering by Sammy Smith's. But this is one stout I will always fall back upon and enjoy thoroughly. It's damn near opaque with a well-retaining tan head. The aroma is mostly burnt chocolate malt, faint coffee, sweetness, and hops. Same goes with the flavor as far as I'm concerned. It has a buttery, if slightly thin but still thick enough for a stout mouthfeel. And it's creamy....drinkable as all hell. I only prefer the Imperial because I'm on a robust kick. But this stout is truly amazing and has never let me down. The clear bottle has always scared me, but it's always fresh when I buy it."
"This brew has a mild hoppy malt aroma. Invigorated pour with a light brown head of small to medium bubbles and a opaque dark brown body with a receding lacing on the side of the glass. It has a surprisingly smooth flavor with very subtle taste. Hard to place the flavor, but it went down very easily and was very much to my liking."
"Truly a wonderful brew and a well crafted stout. Two Pints Up!"
"As others have said, Whats with the clear glass bottle. Poured a dark chocolate brown, with a chocolate head that slowly receded leaving a fair amount of lacing on the glass. Aroma is of roasted malt, a hint of chocolate, and coffee. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, however the taste didn't live up to the aroma. Sweet from the malt with some coffee but little else. Not bad, but not the best Oatmeal stout I've had. Overall it was still enjoyable."
"From the clear bottle pours forth a black beer with a light tan to light brown head, which is composed of many tiny bubbles and diminishes somewhat quickly. The aroma is of roasted malt. Not particularly strong, but inviting. The taste is wonderful and full of many flavors including chocolate, roasted malt, and coffee. A taste similar to sherry also comes through especially in the dry finish. Very smooth and very enjoyable. Highly drinkable despite being a medium to heavy bodied beer."
"The beer pours black witha full tan head that is well retained. The aroma is of dark malts. There is something in it that I just can't put my finger on; maybe it's the yeast or an aromatic specialty grain. The taste is excellant. A good stout with that oatmeal flavor. Chocolate malts overpower me in a good way. It is such a balanced ale. A real pleasure to drink. The mouthfeel is med/heavy body, but a real drinkable beer. A low abv. (5%) means that many can be had without getting too loose. Another great brew from this respected brewery."
"Ok, Now i'm finished with beer in clear glass. This one was slightly skunked as well. I'll never make another attempt at this. Looks nice, dark with foamy head. Aroma is sadly tainted. Same with flavor, although not as bad as the nutbrown I had earler. Good mouthfeel and probably a good hopped stout. Maybe I'll plan a trip to England and try this one. On draught."
"The only other time I drank this beer, I had it in comparison with Sammy's Imperial. It is not as malty or subtantial (and isn't supposed to be). I tried it again tonight, and although it still comes across as somewhat mild for a stout, it has a nice, well balanced taste. Terrific appearance in the glass, with a large foamy head. I still prefer the imperial, but this is a very smooth, enjoyable beer."
"As stated earlier, I am not much of a stout drinker, so I would humbly categorize this as a beginner's stout. And, as a beginning stout drinker, I am looking to move to something a little deeper and with more character."
"A very nice dark stout, that when held to light I only imagine that there's a little reddish-brown color around the outsides of the glass. I light tan head that stuck around for a while and left a nice sticky lace down the sides. The flavor is sweet and malty with a hint of bitter-chocolate. Nice and creamy with a very clean finish and with only 5% abv this is one that I can drink all night. The only reason that I left room for improvement in my score is that it's not GLBC Ohio City."
"I had this beer in a 12oz. bottle poured into a tulip style glass. The color is a deep black with 2 fingers of dark tan head. There is a bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is sweet roasted coffee maybe. The taste is very sweet, not hoppy at all. Almost a mix of toffee and coffee in this. Nice sweet finish that is just great. The mouthfeel is very strong, I love it! The drinkability is a little low for a 5.0%. Great stout though that I will enjoy again soon."
"(which is by no means an exemplar of the style, just a starting point). A fine specimen for those with a sweet tooth."
"Pours a light ink black in color with a two finger foamy head. Aroma of burnt malts and some chocolate. Sweet and creamy, slippery smooth, somewhat acidic and smokey. Some dark roast coffee and a slightly dry finish, leaves you yearning for more. Incredible stout, should own it's own category."
"The sweet toffee smell is echoed in the front of the beer. The middle is sweet and malty, just a little oily. Just a touch of smoky coffee shows up in the finish. This is a good beer. It's almost a little too sweet for me, though it dries a little and gets creamier with temperature."
"Dark mahogany brown, with a foamy brown head. The head lingers a bit and leaves, but produces good lacing. The aroma is of roasted malt, and the flavor matches the aroma, but then throws in a hint of hop bitterness, with nuances of coffee and chocolate. Very well-balanced, very nice creamy mouthfeel. These guys just make really good stuf."
"I could drink this all night!"
"Black as night, only small amount of red shows through when held up to the light. Loads of lacing. Well what can i say, this is a fine beer. Very nice sweet taste, the hops are there if youre looking, otherwise they complement the beer very nicely. This shaint be the last of these that i consume."
"Pours with a thick, creamy head. Head settles nicely. Extremely dark brown. Smells... ""oaty""! Some nuts, too. Well rounded, complex, but soothing taste. Toasted oats are obvious but not over the top. Slight, pleasant aftertaste. Very drinkable. I could go a night drinking only this."
"I am glad that this bottle wasn't skunked, as it is very enjoyable - probably the most enjoyable of the 4 Samuel Smith brews I have had this evening."
"This should be given to anyone who thinks that all stouts taste like guinness. Black in color with a thin tan head. I found little to know aroma at all. This is it's only downfall. The taste though, is fantastic. It's a very robust molasses like taste that lingers on my tongue for quite some time. The mouthfeel is very thick and it goes down smooth. Certaintly one of the best examples of the style."
"Not a bad beer, and definitely drinkable, but not one that I will order again."
"tasted."
"Nice dark brown, nearly opaque color. Head is steady, tan in color. A slight skunky smell taints the aroma. The skunk dissipates (or the senses acclimatize), but the nose is faint. Only with a vigorous swirl is there any aroma generated. Sweetish oatmeal and some chocolate notes are detected. Many of the characteristics of the aroma are noted in the taste and are a bit more pronounced. Body is light, mouthfeel smooth and drinkable. A slightly above average oatmeal stout IMHO."
"What can I say, but Holy Freakin Cow. This is one absolutely smooth beer. Pours a deep brown color topped off by an incredibly thick and creamy head. Head retains itself for the entire duration, leaving a thin, sticky coating of lace on the glass. Nose is full of roasted oats, toffee, and mild nutty undertones. The taste is very similar to the aroma, mildly sweet and very delicious. The mouthfeel is total smoothness. I highly recommend this brew to any lover of fine stouts."
"This oatmeal stout poured a very, VERY deep amber almost black. It was clear when held to a light. The ample dark tan head held on for the entire time it took to drink the clear 550 ml bottle. The roasted aroma was muted but very nice. The roasted flavor grabbed my tongue. It semi sweet taste lingered long after the liquid was swallowed. There was almost a wee heavy aspect of the roasted and chocolate combination. The mouthfeel was creamy and clung to my tongue. This is an exceptional beer and I would recommend this to anyone."
"After hearing about this for a long time I finally tried it. Wow. This is good stuff. Pours black with a large dark creamy head. Taste is very malty, with chocolate accents. Not a boring stout here. This has a nice, thick mouthfeel. Finishes smooth with a nice lingering sweetness. Wow"
"I ordered a large (clear) bottle of this Oatmeal Stout at my newly-opened local beerpub, Mary's, and I savored its thick, dark, earthiness over delightful conversation with one of the pub's owners on a serenely slow Tuesday night. The stout poured an almost jet black (just a slight shimmer of red--but the lighting was low) with a deep tan head. It had a distinct musty smell and only the slightest hint of fruit. The mouthfeel was excellent; it was viscous and even creamy with little carbonation. The taste had a heavy maltiness, like caramel, and again the subtle citrus fruitiness lingered on the back of my buds. I liked it a lot, so I ordered another, and it continued to charm me--in all, a good choice from start to finish."
"This beer pours an extremely black color with a beautiful brown head which laces the glass all the way down. It has a mild chocolate nose with whiffs of sweetness. This beer is smooth and yet has the most complex flavor of any oatmeal stout I've had yet. I can taste the oats, chocolate, roasted goodness and even some hoppiness. This brew has a nice thick mouthfeel that helps keep the flavor lingering until you are ready for the next drink. This is without a doubt the best Oatmeal Stout I've had to date. While it is a little on the expensive side, it is definitely something I will treat myself to again."
"Rivisit Aug. 29th - Tweeked the numbers a bit - color of used motor oil and nearly pours as thick, finger high head of yellowish cream of spongyness, crumbles fast, spotty lace that sticks like glue. Aroma is strong of oats and molasses, some sweet bitter chocolate and lots of solid roasted malts with cherry and plum notes. Enjoyably wafting stout nose. Taste really smacks of nice sweet oat character the whole way through, almost too much, its sweetness is chewy and strong. Roasted malts play secondary on the palatte along with some darl fruityness of plum and very light bitter chocolate notes which alll mostly come through near the finish. Feell is super creamy smooth, medium body with the center being more full. Has a easy, relaxing calm smooth finish thats lightly dry. Lending this oatmeal stout to be smoothly drinkable, goes down easy; a sweet chewy treat."
"Overall great beer."
"Not normally a dark beer drinker I think this great beer helps to change my mind about the darker brews. This is an outstanding drink that looks good and tastes great. It has great black coloring with a decent dark tan head. Smooth and silky it has no single flavor that overwhelms the palate. A creamy, rich delight that is nicely packaged, but for the clear bottle. Definitely would be great with many different foods and could stay through the evening without overstaying its welcome."
"Cheers!"
"This is a delicious, mild stout. Very creamy and smooth."
"A 550 ml clear glass bottle of yummy oatmeal stout. Rather spendy, worth every penny."
"Rich, complex, and classic brew. Its less sophisticated than their Imperial Stout, but it still creates enough havoc in the mouth to keep you very, very interested. This is one of my sentimental favorites, so even if they get bought out by AB Ill still drink it!"
"Happy to sample this one on a brutally cold eve at an unsuspecting bar (TGIF's?)... Tried to pour the best I could into my glass with my icy fingers. I think my efforts could have been better, but overall appearance was good: very dark liquid with a ""thickish"" foam which settled in nicely (forgot to check my glass prior for head maintenance). I sensed a very pleasant roasted and alcoholic quality in the smell and my tasting quickly followed. Very fine taste indeed. Full, up-front roasted flavor and great finish. Mouthfeel was also super (oatmeal-enhanced?). My tasting notes ended here, but knowing I had to sample even more (or brave the cold) -- a beer-switcher stayed true to this brew the remaining eve."
"One of my top choices now and strongly recommended to try."
"Nice deep color was topped by an airy tan head that disappated, lacing was thin and very smattered. Nice roasty smell with some sweetness. Silky creamy mouthfeel, mellow roasted flavor, a nice nightcap. Upper echelon stout but I don't agree with the majority of my fellow advocates who consider this the king. Young's is. My opinion folks."
"Since I started with mentioning the McAuslan, I better finish that thought - the McAuslan is aggressive everywhere that Samuel Smith is relaxed and smooth."
"sweet effect on my palette and the oatmeal was very apparent. the only thing that caught me off gaurd was the thin mouthfeel it had, it was not at all thick. This cost me a little more than I usually spend, but it was well worth it."
"why the clear bottle for such a dark beer?"
"Creamy soft texture. Really full flavored on a huge frame, but everything works so nicely together it is not loud. It has that berry-fruity taste that great bittersweet chocolate has. There is a mellow sweetness here, that you almost miss because it is so mellow, despite it being so obvious. I found none of the astringent/bitterness that the other reviews found. I will have to buy a case and drink until I find it."
"Carbonation seemed to hold up well, but I will have to get a fresh sample this weekend to compare it. The after taste was dry and almost non-existent, but still left a slight bitter taste on the sides of the tongue. All in all, I would still consider the taste outstanding."
"Honestly, how do they do it? There are many who attempt this style, but no one comes close to Samuel Smith's when it comes to flavor, to taste, to utter perfection. Nothing less than happiness can result from drinking this fine brew. Always to find a spot among my Top Five. Absolutely perfect!"
"Poured dark as night. Not much of a head, but that's ok. The taste was rather sweet, bordering on being a porter. It had many unique complexities, the roasted coffe, the chocolate, etc. but it did not translate very well for me. A good beer, but not the best."
"A meal in a bottle, this one is. A classic English stout with all of the complexities expected from much touted Old Brewery Tadcaster. Certainly not the best stout in my opinion, nor the best example of the style, but it is damn good."
"This beer came in a clear bottle (surprised me) and poured into the glass a dark brown/black but when held to the light there were ruby highlights. The head was beige in color, creamy and thick. The lace held up nicely and stretched to the bottom of the glass. The aroma was of molasses, chocolate, dark malt, and slight vanilla. The tastes were sweet and creamy not thick. Flavors of roasted malt, coffee, bitter hops and chocolate in the end and some what dry . Simple and yet complex all at the same time. This is a very smooth beer. I am surprised that I had not tried this earlier in my life. I really REALLY enjoyed this beer."
"Backwash: The gold standard of bottled oatmeal stouts."
"That deceptive clear bottle. Until you pour this stout, you would swear it was in a brown bottle, but noooo- clear as glass can be! Deep brown, almost opaque, brew with a caramel colored head that lasts and lasts. Eventually fades to a thin layer with no discernable lace. Sweet chocolate aroma and mollasses. Smooth taste, slightly bitter cocoa, coffee, malts. Thinner mouthfeel than expected, light carbonation. Overall pretty drinkable and a good introduction to the style."
"-F"
"Nice chocolate flavor and typical dark stout appearance. Low carbonation and light body (for an oatmeal stout) made it easy to drink. The price is a bit high and will keep me from drinking too many of these."
"Oelergud - Cheers!"
"Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout is as black as a moonless sky, with a creamy brown head. It is fruity in the nose, wih a bit roastness and chocolate as well. Creamy, smooth, with chocolate notes. It is almost like a milk shake, with a hint of chocolate. It's silky smooth to a semi-dry finish. Probably one of the best Stouts I have yet to sample. Medium bodied, with a low level of carbonation. A very well balanced beer, the bitterness is tamed down by the creamy roast maltiness."
"Personal notes: This is a very good quality beer and true to style. My taste tends to favor a bit more bitterness but again, the taste fits the style."
"This review is from a 550 ml clear bottle that is gold rappedfor most of the neck. Pours dark with nice head and leaves good lace. Taste is chocolate with a roasted flavors. Very lightly carbonation. Full bodied. Drinking more than 2 of these is out of question."
"Pours a deep black color with a tan colored head. Aroma is of sweet roasted malts with hints of citrus. Taste is sweet caramel up front followed by a strong bitter burnt coffee taste and then a sweet buttery aftertaste. A very nice stout."
"The aroma is lacking unless served at about 50 degrees. The palate is very pleased with the overall texture and taste of this fine stout."
"Very drinkable stout."
"A damn good stout, but in the Samuel Smith range, I'd take an Imperial Stout or Taddy Porter over this. I find this beer to be a bit 'overrated'..."
"Dark brown-black color, creamy head, aroma of sweet chocolate and well roasted malts. Medium body with a creamy, silky texture. Great flavors of roasted malts and chocolate, I like the Imperial a tad better, still you can't go wrong with this one."
"I tried this one because it had such a high ranking and I was not disappointed at all. I love the creamy head and 'roasted' taste of this beer. Everytime I go to the liquor store to try a new beer, I keep coming back to this one over and over."
"Comes in a clear 12 oz bottle. The gold foil wrapped over the cap and part of the neck of the bottle is a nice touch.  Pours black with a thick light brown creamy head.  Aroma is sweet with scents of raisins, dark chocolate and coffee.  The texture is smooth and full-bodied as it flows over the tongue.  Lacks dryness of most stouts-- which isn't a bad thing.  Nice balance of sweetness and bitterness with roasted malt, fruit, and slight soy taste (I also noticed this, like the previous reviewer).  This is an amazing stout and a great session beer."
"Smooth black pour with substantial, foamy head that sticks around for a while and laces very nicely.  Full, smooth nose highlighted by creamy roasted notes and and light chocolate.  A wonderfully full flavor profile that invites my third use of the word ""smooth.""  Initial sweetness reminds me of Spaten Optimator but doesn't ever fully give way to the dry crispness of alcohol.  Creamy, carmely middle with a lighter version of the typical stout profile.  Drink after drink, and I just can't pin down the flavors (and that ain't a bad thing).  A pleasant mouthfeel and good drinkability top off this wonderful experience."
"THIS is what it's all about! Sammy Smith's Oatmeal Stout! Do you think they'll hire me to write slogans for them? I didn't think so either. Seriously this is the best beer I have ever had in my life. (I'm only 21 but still)! Simply amazing. I could rave about this stuff for days. I've never really been one to study the smell, appearance, and mouthfeel of beers like some of the aficionados on this site, but I just can't help it with this one. From the wonderful smoky aroma from when you first pop the cap, to the beautiful tan head that never goes away, to the slow caramel-like finish, this brew is a winner all the way. It is quite expensive, but IMO is worth it. Everybody should try this beer. There is no excuse not to. Go right now to your local beer store and get some of this. And when you get to the checkout counter, tell 'em Hoss McGraw sent ya!"
"A nice deep, dark beer that pours with a creamy looking tan head.  The aromas are of chocolate, brown sugar, with maybe a hint of hops.  The flavor is of roasted malt, chocolate, with a slight alcohol note that reminds me of a good bourbon.  The finish has a nice bitterness that balances out the slight sweetness in the taste.   Mouthfeel is good, but not as creamy as I expected.  Although lower ABV than many beers I drink, the alcohol is noticable, but just slightly.  Overall, a good beer, but not as good as a few others I've had lately.  That being said, I would not pass up the opportunity to have another one!"
"That said, it is a really good example of the Style, but I cant drink much of this."
"Cheers"
"Very potent tasting and rich drink. I like to drink it slowly and savor it as a special treat all by itself."
"Very pleasing to the palette and hearty enough to stick to the ribs at the same time.  A thick beer with full bodied flavor, but surprisingly smooth!  The over all is a rich hop taste with a hint of chocolate.  Definitely one of my favorites."
"Black in color and topped by a creamy dark tan head that holds well and leaves very good lace. When held to bright light ,some clear, brown highlights can be seen. The aroma offers a bright fruitiness, some light chocolate, a mild roastiness and a hint of butterscotch. The body is light-medium with a very fine, restrained carbonation that gives it a silky smooth mouthfeel. The flavor is sweetly malty with a good dose of fruitiness up front, followed by some bittersweet & dark chocolate notes as it crosses the palate, and finishing with a more noticeable bitterness, some nuttiness, and a long lasting gentle roastiness. Clearly balanced toward the sweet side. There's a mild diacetyl here that seems to pull the whole thing together. It never appears to become more than just a light butterscotch note, but it helps to round everything out so nicely - smoothing out the roastiness, and maybe even helping to keep the sweetness in check.(?) A very nice, and highly enjoyable beer, that is soft & sweet & light but also offers alot of character - allowing it to fill a variety of different roles. Highly recommended."
"I read lots of good things about this beer and it is one of BA's top beers. Alas, I would have to disagree. The good qualities is the nice thick pour and it's dark as night, but it has that distinct English taste and aroma to it. Unfortunatly, I'm not a huge fan of it. Not that those qualites make a beer bad, just doesn't make a fan out of me."
"Arguably todays premier stout and there is no wonder to it's popularity. Dark as midnight this one his the mouth with a take-force flavor but parts the way for a rewarding creamy sweetness that keeps inviting you back for more. A deep coffee and dark chocolate mix. Goes down as smooth as ice cream. I usually find myself having a few in a row before realizing it!"
"A nice grey/brown satin head that crinkles up in the middle before it resolves into a splotchy, torn blanket. My id is very disappointed with the color. It wants stout to be black black black, which this isn't. This is more of a Dunkin Donuts black coffee color than a Peet's espresso. But who cares about looks? Sweet, candied, roasted oats. It smells like something you should feed a reindeer; even some fruitcake spices are lurking underneath making the whole aroma very yule. Oh yeah, nuts too. And tobacco. A cigar-chomping, gluttonous Thrasher. A perfect attack of silky malty toasted almonds, brazil nuts and millet with a shy bitterness that gives definition and cut to the finish. This is soulful stout. Don't expect big, chewy extract though. This is rowboat-mandolin-sunspeckle beer."
"Happy Drinking!"
"Very dark with only hints of translucent brown at the edges.  Rocky tan head with impressive staying power.  Aroma of dark chocolate, cocoa, and coffee.  Very sweet taste that is almost surprising, and very malty.  A bit sticky in the back, leaves a bit of caramel.  Roasted and smoky peat-like flavor.  As for the mouthfeel, it melts in your mouth!  This is a wonderful, very impressive, and unique stout!"
"Wow, what a great beer. Somebody had to tell me the bottle was colorless before I realized that was the color of the beer! Sweet aroma and coffee undertones make this a new favorite of mine. If only it were more readily available! Perfectly smooth and drinkable."
"This is a great beer. Pours a beautiful tan head and leaves lace all the way down the glass. Smell some roasted sweetness and a nutty aroma. Creamy mouthfeel, very smooth. Has a unique taste and it does not have the amount of bitterness many stouts do. This is a real treat."
"French Roast in color.  Big bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt in the nose.  Medium to full-bodied.  Chocolate and light smoke run through the finish. This is one of those ""Dessert in a glass"" beers, and I wish I had another.  It was nice to finally get a decent sample of this stuff, has been two or so years... thankfully my local ""beer store"" is running SS as their brewery of the month."
"This is a classic stout that most everyone has tried or has at least heard about. It pours a very dark brown with a fluffy head. The nose is of roasted malt and oatmeal. It tastes quite sweet (caramel notes) with that lingering oatmeal flavor all the way through. Although I prefer a little more kick to my stouts, this is a very easy-drinking brew."
"Until I tried Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout this was my favorite.  Nice black color, roasted malt/caramel flavors.  A very smooth stout.  I feel it is a good stout for people new to the style."
"Opaque black, with a tan head which settles to a lace.  Smell is of roasted malt and carmel.  Flavors of coffe, chocolate, toffee, and just a touch of hops bitterness.  An outstanding stoudt."
"Dark brown, not quite opaque color with a big ol', creamy head.  Strong caramel smell carries over into a (too) mellow, sweet taste - needs more hops :)  Mouthfeel is watery, for a stout.  I'll take my oatmeal a la Rogue, unless I want to drink all night."
"This is a truly excellent beer.  Dark and heavy with a medium, rocky, tan head.  Complex roasted malt and cereal aroma.  The beer has a full, rich taste, which is sweet but not cloying.  I love this beer."
"A mouthful of velvety sweetness.  Who needs a dry Irish stout when you have those sweet English brews at your disposal.  Absolutely a must for any beer drinker.  Drink, Drink.  Cheers!"
"This is a brew whose reputation precedes it as being one of the best stouts in the world. The mouth feel was pleasingly rich, but not clingy, providing a good foundation for the well-focused complex oatmeal taste. This is the kind of brew that you could drink all night. However, I find that Rogue's Shakespeare Stout just slightly more pleasing. Both are must tries."
"Ink black for the most part, slightly reddish around the edges. Tan head that reached a finger, fair retention, first-rate lacing though. The nose is pleasant but not very persuasive, oatmeal sweetness and delicate roasted malt are the most noticeable aromas. Delicious. A magical blend of sweetness mingles with roasted malt and magnificent hops bitterness. Creamy and smooth, tickles your tastebuds as it slides down your throat. Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout is very worthy of its esteemed reputation. This is a must drink for any real beer drinker. Positively recommend!"
"This was an excellent beer and I can see why it is so highly rated by BA.  Started with a finger width of tan head that lasted for awhile with minimal lacing after.  Nearly opaque dark brown color with a nice chocolate aroma.  The roasty flavor was excellent, not overbearing like some stouts can be.  It had a nice full mouthfeel and was very drinkable."
"Pours almost an opaque color, with a small tan colored head that dies really quick and leaves a nice lace. Mouth feel is smooth and body is medium. On the nose, the aromas consisted cereal grains, oats and slightly acidic. On the palate; grains, oats, nice sweetness, caramel, and a bit of toffee flavor. The finish is slightly sweet and slightly dry. Overall has to be one of the best oatmeal stouts I ever had, I thought it may be over rated at first but not anymore."
"This was my first Samual Smith. I was also amazed by this thick, rich, black brew.I also never would of guessed it came in a clear bottle.Its dark, full of body,tan head and glass lace was very drinkable. Nice for dessert.Now I cant wait to try an Imperial Stout!"
"it is very rich and dark with great coffee and oat flavors jumping all over you. man this is a stout. i would love to find a beer that i enjoy more than this. i am partial to stouts, but as they go, this one is the top of the top shelf."
"One was enough. Just wasn't my cup of tea. A bit pricy for an average stout. Although it was easy to drink, it lacked any kind of lingering aftertaste. Tried it again, and haven't changed my mind one bit. Maybe a little. Liked it less than the first time. After tasting ""Storm King"" I dropped my rating of this beer another point in taste!"
"Pours like liquid midnight from a bottle, sweet, and some what musty, this brew slakes any thirst, cures any ill, and takes out the garbage, if you drink enough of it... A stoutmans stout, this is something to write home about!"
"Who need nitrogen? Black with ruby highlights in the body, big thick beige head that you can sculpt with. Head hangs over top of glass, with a dent where I was pouring, Roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, liquorice in aroma. Gloriously thick on the mouth,across the tongue and down. No harshness, well rounded, well balanced. Rich, a richness that reduces the drinkabilty a notch. Savor this. Great beer from a great brewery."
"Dark brown, with thick foamy head.  Smells rich.  Taste is full-bodied with hint of alcohol flavor, sweet but not too sweet, and goes well with  food."
"There is not a single aspect of this beer that is weak.  The aroma is a wonderful mild roasted malt with a slight sweetness and fruitiness.  Dark black color with hints of brown covered by a large full head.  Taste is full and rich for style with wonderful complexity making the whole journey from front to back enjoyable.  There is a great smoothness, a slight oily quality, maybe a little thin,  with a very pleasant lingering at the finish.  A truly great drinking experience."
"Dark mahogany body with a beautiful rich brown, dense, creamy head over the smell of sweet roasted malts. Bittersweet chocolate flavors fold into toffee and molasses until a subtle noble hops balance leads to a dryish finish. One of the richest oatmeal stouts I've had, almost leans towards an Imperial. The complexity of the malts makes this one of the better stouts I've tried. Would love to try one of these on tap in London to see if the trip and the clear bottle effects the taste."
"When my mom used to try to shovel down the Quaker stuff I would gag...if only she'd known about Mr. Smith....this is wicked stuff and, without question, one of the finest stouts I've ever tried...big, bold and beautiful...the Irish drink pony pee by comparison!"
"This beer poured a medium brown color and formed a light tan bubbly head that left trace lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt and hops with a touch of oatmeal. A flavor of malt, hops and lightly of oatmeal. I love the color of this beer. I have always liked Samuel Smith beers, even if they are a bit pricey. I love oatmeal stouts and feel some people are put off by the name oatmeal thinking it is something there mother is trying to shove down their throat. I would recommend this to people trying to get a feel for this type of stout."
"This is a quality brew. but, I was not as impressed as others on this site.  It is dark black, opeque with a sweetish cherry like nose.  Dark tan head.  Roast malt flavor with a sweet coat of the tongue.  The mouth is very smooth.  It was good but not quite good enough to give it 5's..  I did have 2 of these in a hotel bar... so I will taste again in the future and modify my rating if needed."
"Oh me oh my. Believe the hype! This Oatmeal Stout looks so delicious...black, big frothy head...and then you have a sip! Ohhhhh mmmmm. Wow. My favorite beer in the entire world. Words cannot express how I feel about this beer. Words would not do it justice. Just get a bottle for yourself and experience ecstasy."
"As near as perfection as I have had. Pours a midnight black, with a nice fluffy beige head. The smell is sweet and strong, but not overbearing. I loved the sweet first taste and the wonderful easy smoothness of this beer. Nice thick, almost chewy feel to it. The roasted chocolate and slight bitterness toward the end, was just right. I tried this based on the beer advocates rating, and it was better than I thought it would be. Of all the beers I have had, this is the most memorable. Of the Stouts I have had I would rank them: 1. Sam Smith Oatmeal  2.Young's Double Chocolate 3. Young's Oatmeal. 4. Old Rasputin Imperial"
"I was skeptical that this beer could live up to it's reputation, but it truly is a wonderful stout.  The color was spot on and the head nicely colored and creamy.  Nice full body with a fair amount of complexity.  Chocolate and roasted malt flavors mixed with flavors I could not identify.  The beer finishes smooth and dry with only the slightest hint of bitterness.  Overall, the best oatmeal stout I have had."
"It is an elite oatmeal stout.  Best in the world?...probably not."
"As luck would have it, my local packy just got a fresh shipment the day I noticed it was at the top of BA's Top Beers list.  Giddy-up!  Pours black(duh) with thin tan head.  Roasty aromas with a slight Yorkshire yeast ""twang"". You can almost smell the smoothness.  The stuff slips down your throat so quick you become thankfull it comes in a big-ass 550ml bottle.  The contrast between sweet, smooth and silky mouthfeel and the drying bitterness of the burnt malt and hops is amazing.  I haven't had this in many years but will most definately buy it again very soon."
"pours out an opaque murky brown colour with a huge rocky head that reduced quickly but left lots of patchy lace. aroma of dark roasted malts, ripened fruits and butter. full bodied mouthfeel is complimented by the roasted malt. incredibly silky smooth and satisfying. chocolate, caramel, toffee and some fruitiness in the taste profile, and the use of oatmeal really takes the edge off any bitterness that is present, and makes the drinkability all the better. certainly worthy of all praise and deserving of it's high rating."
"Had this last night and realized how good this beer is.  It had been awhile since I drank this stout and decided to pick one up after seeing it sitting near the top here for some time.  I should have done it sooner.  I actually had a Youngs Double Chocalate Stout afterwards and this is the one that was rememberable enough to review tonight.  Quick overview - Deep dark color, ruby tint when held to the light, rich, creamy tan head.  Roasted malt aroma, rich and creamy taste with notes of coffee and chocolate.  No decernable hop bite, and goes down smooth as silk.  I will pick up some more tomorrow."
"Sam Smith’s Oatmeal Stout: 550 ml clear bottle, gold foil top.  Rich, dense foam head stands a good inch and half over the rim of the glass.  Very light aroma, with a hint of coffee with a drop of cream.  Very smooth, rich creamy malt taste, with very little aftertaste.  No carbonation.  This is a fantastic beer, rich and creamy.   This beer will definitely replace your dessert after a big meal, although a slice of tiramisu might be nice on the side.  This has to be in my top five, and is highly recommended."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom 550ml (1 pint, 2.7 ounce) brown glass bottle, sealed with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
"This is an excellent beer. A meal itself. The smell turns me off slightly but it is quite tasty and feels good in the mouth and throat. It feels like it hits lighter than a 5% though, which is good IMO. I suggest having it without a meal, it's deserving of attention."
"Big bubbled head, softly persistent and light tan in color. Slightly less than jet black color, muted aroma. Pleasant creamy malt flavor, no hint of a hop bite. Long on mouthfeel, short on super interesting flavor. Nice beer and example of style, love the pillowy globs of foam on the pint glass, but it needs more flavor. There is that characteristic nuttiness to the profile that I find interesting and nice to note. This beer review might suffer because of a back-to-back comparison with Rogue Shakespeare."
"The thick beige head tops the nearly black hued brew-- a hint of a deep but clear garnet color is discernable when held to light.  It's appetizing in appearance.  The very pleasant aroma is comprised of chocolate, butterscotch, mild roasted barley and a hint of yeast - derived fruitiness. The meager hint of Kent Goldings is dominated by the malt notes. Silky smooth mouthfeel like a good outmeal stout should have.  Bittersweet in flavor from a superlative balance of residual sugars and bitterness from roasted grain and moderate hopping.  The mild diacetyl combined w/ the chocolate malt flavors lends a rich, dark chocolate note.  Finishes w/ sweetness on the tip of the tongue and a mellow bitterness that coats my palette.  Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout is the epitomy of balance.  Compared to many microbrewed versions it's quite sophisticated. It's worth the extra price.  I've forgotten how good this is."
"Excellent. There is such a nice balance to this stout. It has a slight sweet taste that combines with that of lightly rosted coffee with a molasses finish. Man, I sound like a food critic from a fancy restaurant just now. Ouch. I've said it before and I'll say it again...the oats make beers of this style like a meal."
"90"
"Doesn't have the burnt bitterness of the dry stouts, but it has the other flavors typical off a stout. I like it, but it doesn't floor me."
"This beer appears black and has great tan head with great retention (which I have not seen lately from a bottled beer).  Beautiful cocoa/coffee aroma.  The brew rolls over the tongue like velvet.  Taste of coffee beans and bittersweet chocolate dominate.  There's a nice bitterness here.  The hops aren't distinguishable, but the bitterness is.  I think the bitterness is probably more due to the roasted malts.  Great Oatmeal Stout."
"This is one of the best beers I have ever tasted. Beautiful black/ruby color with a lacy tan head. An initial tanginess that gives way to a deep chocolate and sweet coffee taste, finishing so smooth and creamy you feel you're in total beer bliss. Absolutely wonderful."
"Finishes with a slight coco bitterness .  Quite complex and on the heavy side."
"This is a fine, fine beer. Damn near perfect but I have to fault Sam Smith for using clear glass bottles. Despite that, this sweet stout holds its flavor pretty well. Creamy beige head atop a black beer although not as dark as SS's Taddy Porter. Very sweet, an excellent dessert beer; a marked contrast to the equally pleasurable but much spicier Imperial Stout. The oatmeal is detectable but insignificant compared to the amount of sugar, which puts a nice cap on the warm malt character. The beer equivalent of coffee with cream and lots of sugar. Low in alcohol but too sweet to drink lots of."
"I can not even begin to describe how spectacular this beer is. I had to go back and change (lower) my ratings of the Bell's Oatmeal because it is not in this league...not many beers are...everything about it is fantastic....great sweet scintilating aroma...black-to-very dark ruby reddish in appearance with a soft lace...sweet, creamy and smooth...delicious!!! with just a hint of hop bite on the finish...I taste the oats strong and almost a ""cream"" sweetness to it..I have yet to try the SS Imperial but it would be tough to top this..."
"After years of meaning to try this stout I finally got around to it recently and am left wonder what all the fuss is about.  It may be a better than average stout, but plenty of less expensive stouts are better. Considering expecations, I found the taste to be rather bland and lacking in subtlety."
"Overall pretty good. My first stout to drink, so keep that in mind when reading this. I love the look, the smell, and it has a creamy mouthfeel. I wasn't overly impressed with the taste though I still consider it to be pretty good. I will drink it again, but probably won't purchase it again anytime soon."
"Dark rich color.  Nice head & lace.  Roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, caramel, toffee, molasses, and oatmeal perfectly balanced.  Smooth, creamy, oily, and silky. Perfect balance between the bitterness and the sweetness. Outstanding aftertaste.  A must try.    Cheers!"
"Another phenomenal brew by Samuel Smith. Faint notes of oatmeal, dried fruit, stronger notes of caramel and cappuccino. It's SO damn easy to drink, almost dangerous. I'm trying to take it slow, but it keeps calling my name."
"Without a doubt - the best brew in the world.  A perfectly balanced stout.  Even if you don't like stouts this is one worth trying-you just may become a convert."
"An absolutely amazing oatmeal stout.  Incredibly smooth.  Perfection..."
"Notes: A cult classic among beer geeks dating back to 1980 ... lets have a moment of silence in honour of this fine brew ... if you want to jump into the world of stouts give this one a try, you might be surprised and actually love it ... I did that is for sure."
"A beautiful looking brew that goes down smooth, and never disappoints.  Like drinking quaker oats..."
"A good oatmeal stout, but I'm a little more reserved about its merit."
"Quite possibly the best beer on earth. A bit pricey but well worth the price. Drink slowly and enjoy every sip."
