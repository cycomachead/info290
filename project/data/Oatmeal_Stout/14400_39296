In the taste, dark roasty malts, cacao, underlying milky sweetness, hints of anise. Body was a bit on the weak side for a stout, especially an oatmeal stout. This might make for a good nitro beer, but as is, it didn't do too much for me.","Rifugium","Mar 05, 2015"

It may not be the most complex or intriguing beer in the world, but the oats are well done (if a bit heavy handed) and the beer drinks like you think an oatmeal stout would drink. Its a filling, tasty example of the style and a good first exposure to Ninkasi for me.","spoony","Jan 28, 2015"

Light body. Pretty standard oatmeal stout otherwise. Slightly roasty. Tastes like a smaller beer than it is, pretty sessionable given the abv. Overall, reminds me a lot of some of the kit-based oatmeal stouts I've had from beginner homebrewers. Drinkable but not terribly exciting, and a few glaring flaws.","Spelaeus","Jan 03, 2015"

The nose is malty with some nice chocolate, toffee, slight coffee note, and some vanilla. The taste is very nice sweet, malty, with some dark stuff thrown in, nice little vanilla note. Medium body, with a slight dry/bitter finish, ABV is hidden pretty well also. Overall a very nice oatmeal stout, would buy again, nice to see Ninkasi in UT.","Wasatch","Dec 06, 2014"

Smells of oats, chocolate, vanilla, coffee beans, toasted grains, cocoa powder and brown sugar; it smells sweet but not overly sweet and has enough milk stout qualities that it stands out as a deep, rich malty stout nose. Tastes like it smells with coffee, espresso, cocoa nibs, charred wood, vanilla beans, oats, roasted/burnt grains and mild floral hops. Tasted and smelled very good for a stout, it was super easy to drink and damn enjoyable. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with really solid roasted notes, a medium body and an almost watery feel that went down smooth. A really great oatmeal stout, this was smooth and tasty with just enough hop bite to mix well with the malt and oat base and limit the bitterness.","CHickman","Nov 08, 2014"
4,1.8,,,,,,"Poured a deep, blackish brown body with red highlights and a one finger tan head that quickly dissipated to a ring of foam. A pretty good looking stout, though not the best. Scents of rich roasted malt, dark roast coffee with cream, bittersweet chocolate, a light, earthy oatmeal aroma and light dark fruit. Overall impression of aroma is of a classic, enticing, true-to-form oatmeal stout. It is very well done. Flavor begins medium sweet, with notes of bittersweet milk chocolate, sweetened dark roast coffee with cream, a slight earthiness from the oats and light roasted malt. This moves into a medium sweet middle with more pronounced roast malt, and the previously mentioned flavors still present. Finish is medium sweet with strong notes of roasted malt balancing, along with sweetened coffee with cream and bittersweet milk chocolate flavors, with very light alcohol flavors discernible. Aftertaste is medium dry with notes of roast malt, cocoa powder and dark coffee, a welcome end to the medium sweet sip. Overall this is a pleasant oatmeal stout flavor profile. It has all the welcome flavors of the style and balances them well. The slight alcohol warmth on the finish is a tad bit unwelcome, but not overly so. Very nice. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, with medium carbonation and a smooth, slick, creamy feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a very true to form oatmeal stout that is quite pleasant to drink. Overall this is a fine example of an oatmeal stout. It hits the aroma, flavor and mouthfeel quite well and is very enjoyable to drink. A very nice offering and a good year-round alternative to Velvet Merlin.","Auraan","Nov 06, 2014"

This is most definitely a hybrid, and sadly, all of the flavors and thin body don't meld well together to me. The burnt notes definitely become distracting after some time. I tried a bottle from the same six pack as this over a month ago and it seems it doesn't seem to improve very substantially in the bottle, despite the higher ABV. I expected better from Ninkasi.

Smell is of dark roasted malt, toasted oats, and cocoa. A slight soy sauce aroma comes out as the beer warms up. Taste is much the same with the slight soy sauce flavor and a mild alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

Some nice spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of milk chocolate, caramel, toffee, roasted malt, coffee, toast, herbal, oats, nuttiness, and light dark fruits. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, coffee, oats, toast, toffee, herbal, nuttiness, and light dark fruits. Low amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, coffee, roasted malt, toffee, oats, herbal, and light dark fruit on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of roasted flavors with malt sweetness; and quite robust with no cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed at all after the finish. Overall this is a very nice oatmeal stout. Very nice balanced roasted and robust flavors; and very easy to drink. Maybe a touch too fruity, but still very enjoyable.","superspak","Jun 24, 2012"

The head is light brown in color, it looks like milk chocolate, and the body is completely pitch black, no visibility through this at all, maybe some hues of brown when held up to the light. The head has faded a little bit, but the bubbles and overall look see to be more creamy now. Overall it looks ok. Not too much of a complex smell on the nose, you get that big malt note up front, smells like chocolate and roasted malts, then you get maybe a little bit of oats, not much else though. You can actually smell the alcohol, which is a little off putting. First thing I notice when I drink this beer is the mouthfeel, it' pretty awesome, nice and thick. The second thing I notice is the smoothness of this, it just glides down the throat, all the flavors mixing in nicely, frankly I'm liking this a lot more than I thought I would. As far as flavors go, they are just all mixed in so well, so they are hard to pick out and identify, but I would say the first thing I notice is the nice big malt flavor, then the roastyness and chocolate flavor, polished off with the slightest hop bite. There is a nice crispness too, which I usually am not a fan of in my stouts, but it works in this beer for some reason. For as many flavors I'm getting, and as for how much flavor it has I'm surprised that it is this smooth and this easy drinking, but it just goes down like nothing.

This is one of the few stouts that I cant get some of that hop flavor, I usually can't taste it. Actually, after a few more sips they hops become more apparent. The malt and hops are perfectly balanced. The coalesce to great one great taste. The hops do not over power, but back up the dark malt for a complimentary boost With what I am tasting the texture is right on (although I am in favor of fuller body stouts). Any thicker and it would probably be too sweet. The over all experience ain't too bad. Definitely better than Anderson Valley's.

Just enough sweetness to round out the roast. Some hop bitterness, but no real hop flavor. Some biscuit notes once it warms up. Thick mouthfeel, very chewy, and a little slick from the oats.

I think more chocolate flavor would come out if the beer had a creamier feel. There's cocoa, roast, raisin-sweet malt and a touch of hops, though less than expected. The beer is somewhat acidic and of moderate sweetness. It's an excellent value, better than many similar stouts. Thanks for starting distribution here, Ninkasi.","popery","Feb 25, 2010"

It finishes very smooth which makes it very easy to drink. Overall a nice tasting beer with a good look and smell. I recieved this beer from madhombrewer as an unexpected thank you package.

4.18,6.4,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D: Get and try it! One of the best examples of a oatmeal stout I have had in a while. A valiant and bold brew. Do I dare say that a little more malt backbone would help things out a little, maybe I am just being picky? Good stuff","Magpie14","Nov 20, 2008"
4.2,6.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Received as an extra in a trade from a generous BA. Pours a dark black with a very small brown head, no retention and some lacing. Smells like coffee and oatmeal, some sweet malt. Taste is of bittersweet chocolate, black coffee, cocoa beans, brown sugar, and oatmeal. Alcohol is hidden within the rich and complex flavors. Full bodied and carbonation is low. I'm happy to see another bottle offering from Ninkasi and this one is well done.","HopHead84","Nov 18, 2008"

4.33,10.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The aroma was great of roasted malts with a hint of chocolate. The taste was really smooth and full of malty goodness. It had a tiny hop presence on the finish which rounded it out nicely. In the mouth it was creamy and lathering over the palate. Having an oatmeal stout like this one makes me remember why it is one of my top 5 favorite styles. This was an excellent brew and I will definitely be buying this one again.","cswhitehorse","Nov 17, 2008"
4.15,5.6,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Drinkability is really high on this one, and when the bottle was empty, I was disappointed. The abv doesn't seem all that apparent to me, and the flavors were impressive. I feel that the mouthfeel suffers a bit out of the bottle, as can be expected, however one of the highlights of Oatis on tap is the impressiveness of the mouthfeel, which doesn't quite come across as well out of a bomber. Still an impressive brew with some incredible flavors. Definitely worth a shot.","djeucalyptus","Nov 11, 2008"
4.03,2.5,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Taste is mocha with a mildly bitter finish. The cocoa and coffee are very well balanced. The oats give the beer good body and make it very smooth. Drinkability is good if you don't mind the 7.2% abv. Very nice seasonal.","Spikester","Oct 14, 2008"
3.9,-0.8,4,4,4,3,4,"Overall a drinkable OS, good but really could have been a great one if the mouthfeel had been thicker.","Reidrover","Jul 19, 2008"
3.75,-4.6,4,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Drinkability - Not a session beer, but one to try again on a cool eve. Stout fans should definitely give it a shot.","apaltrineri","Apr 08, 2008"
