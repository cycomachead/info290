3.88,-4.9,4.25,4.25,3.75,3.5,3.75,"One of the first craft beers I used to drink before I knew what craft was.  12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint.  Pours one shade darker than cola with a frothy, quarter inch, mocha-colored head.  Head eventually settles into a soapy slick that coalesces around the shoulders.  A few thin swaths of lacing are present during the tasting.  Nose is roasty with cocoa notes and a hint of vanilla extract.  Taste consistent with nose but a little ashy and there's a feint metallic quality.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with a prickly, slightly gassy carbonation.  Overall, not a bad oatmeal stout, but a little thin and perhaps a bit past it's prime.","Jwale73","Feb 07, 2015"
4.23,3.7,5,4.5,4,4,4.25,"Pours a very dark colour, roughly three fingers of mocha coloured head, little lacing.  Aroma is quite nice and inviting, mostly mocha and coffee.  Nice mouthfeel, not overly heavy or overwhelming.  The aftertaste is inoffensive.  Probably not as heavy as you would expect for an oatmeal stout.  Not overly bitter on the tongue, something you could definitely have more than one of, especially at a reasonable 5% ABV.  Something I would recommend to pretty much anyone in the depths of a long winter.","Derek69","Feb 06, 2015"

The nose is dark roast coffee, dark fruit, and earthy hops. Taste closely follows, w an added turn from rye bread, bitter cocoa, and rich caramel. Lingering finish adds a hint of maple syrup to the overall roastiness and dark bread flavor. Cascade and Willamette make a welcome appearance as well.

Even from the can it taste's good so you won't here me complaining any time soon.  It's got a nice alcohol percentage so your not choking on the liquor and the best part of this beer is the flavor.

No strong scent, outside of a mild roast malt and caramel.  Very smooth, especailly after enjoys some strong RIP's during he week.  Well rounded with not much bitterness, except at the finish,  Some dark chocolate undertones, but mostly a lightly roasted malt.  Not as chewy as I had anticipated, but still quite enjoyable.

4.16,2,4,4.25,4.25,4,4,"Sampled on tap at Beer Revolution in Calgary. A beautiful inky brownish-black stout smelling of burnt coffee, smoke, molasses. Nice mocha colored head that perches atop the murk. Palate is hearty, grainy, and deeply satisfying. Coffee and chocolate provide the lynchpins but there are some really nice mellow fruity notes (raisins) and delicate herbal flavors to provide complexity. Syrupy molasses and some dry nuts. Nothing clashes or makes itself known in an unpleasant way. Palate is silky smooth and body is heavy and thick. Oats add some astringency and although I am not wild about oats in brewing, here the bitterness rounds out the heavy dark flavors and sweetness nicely. Finish dry and chalky. Fanastic example of an oatmeal stout that hits the deep dark complexity mark without being unbalanced.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 20, 2013"

Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of big cocoa, dark chocolate, molasses, raisin, dark bread, vanilla, toast, roasted malt, toffee, oats, floral, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and oat notes with moderate dark fruits; and good strength. Taste of cocoa, dark chocolate, dark bread, toast, vanilla, toffee, molasses, raisin, oats, light coffee, floral, and roasted earthiness. Light earthy roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, dark bread, light coffee, toast, molasses, vanilla, toffee, raisin, floral, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors with moderate fruitiness; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a very creamy and moderately slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent oatmeal stout! All around great balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors with oat and dark fruit notes; with great robustness and very smooth drinking. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 30, 2013"

Small streaks of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, toasted oats, cocoa, and cookie dough aromas. Taste is much the same with char, cocoa, and very slight soy sauce flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

It's got the trademark oatmeal smoothness, but hints of smoke, bitter coffee, and leafy hops keep things very interesting. It's got more flavor than some imperial stouts I've had, yet clocks in at a modest 5% ABV. If you see this, buy it, and buy more than the single I bought. I wish I had more.","shand","Aug 23, 2013"
3.74,-8.3,4.25,4,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Pours deep black with cocoa edges that appear against the light. The head is gone but the lacing continues. The roasted malt echoes across the nose reminding me of sunrise in Peru. The sour coffee bitterness holds back the flavor for me although the beautiful buttery tannins of a good merlot make this a very interesting beer. Probably a good gateway for your wine snob friends. Silky smooth malt rolls into coffee bitterness in a jarring contrast. But I could have another.","templar316","Aug 22, 2013"

Aromas of dark chocolate, caramel, a touch of molasses, and cream. Very well balanced, and very rich. Flavors are roasted initially, with a coffee backbone and hints of smoke highlighting. Very bitter and dry, but balanced very well. The aftertaste is mostly coffee, with hints of bittersweet baker's chocolate. The grain bill helps keep things smooth and balanced.

It seemed a bit weak though. The taste reminded me of oatmeal sweetened with maple syrup. It had a sweetness to it, but it wasn't overpowering at all. The sweetness was nicely balanced with a roasted coffee flavor. I would have liked a bit thicker mouthfeel. While oatmeal stouts are not a style I prefer, I certainly enjoyed this beer. I think it would pair really well with a dessert.","DeltaGolfSierra","Nov 06, 2012"

The roasted flavor of the malt overtakes a lot of sweetness hiding in this gem . halfway thru I wanted another . It goes down like a light beer but gives that kick in taste buds ideally found in IPA's . It has a slight but not overwhelming taste that is need in a stout to make it stand out .

The flavor has notes of dark chocolate, oatmeal, milk, and mild coffee at the end. There is a welcome warmth in the finish. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. McAuslan St-Ambroise Oatmeal Stout is a good beer, smooth, and perfect during an early October snowstorm. Highly recommended.","B967ierhunter177","Oct 29, 2011"
3.52,-13.7,4,4.5,3,3,3.5,"Starting things off right today with a nice oatmeal stout. It pours a deep black-brown topped by a half-finger of dirty tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, chocolate powder, toasted oats, very light charcoal, and a nice vein of vanilla. The taste brings in more of the same, though the oats are more toasted, the malts more roasted, and the vanilla seems to have dropped out completely. Some lightly bitter coffee is tossed in there for good measure, as well. Unfortunately, the bitter and charred end of the flavor spectrum is spotlighted here. The body is a strong medium, with a moderate carbonation and a rather dry finish. Overall, what starts out as a damn fine oatmeal stout takes a turn for the worse with diminished flavors, a slightly thin feel, and a bad case of overcarbonation. Still not truly bad, but this is quite the disappointment.","TMoney2591","Oct 03, 2011"

The head is a nice one and a half finger in width, and it is probably the darkest head I have ever seen, it looks like super dark chocolate milk. Body is pitch black. On the nose you get all the characteristics of a regular stout, chocolate, heavy malt notes and not much hop, but you also get a sweet maybe even piny smell, it's a very weird smell. Im going to be honest the sweet piny smell doesn't smell too appetizing, but it also doesn't smell too dominant. Man, that is a smooth stout, it flows perfectly from front to middle to end. It isn't as thick as I like my stouts, but I'm coming to realize that's normal for eastern beers. I mean on one hand it's just so smooth, but on the other hand there isn't a whole lot of flavor going on, yeah you get the malt and the chocolate but it is very small overall. In the end you get that sweet, sour taste I was picking up on in the smell, but it is very very small and not unpleasant or anything. The taste is ok overall.

This beer tasted absolutely fantastic, basically the taste is as if one took the darkest chocolate imaginable and melted it into a beer, with very very slight tart undernotes. Mouthfeel was thick and wonderfully rich and creamy. Some might say it's a bit heavy, but this is one beer I could drink all night. I should note that is the first example of this style I've tasted so I may be a bit biased in my review due to lack of comparison, but in the grand and majestic scheme of what beer tastes good this nails it for me, really just an outstanding offering in my opinion!","abass","Jun 14, 2010"

4.5,10.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This brew poured to a completely black color, no light sneaking through this one. Thick deep tan colored head hat fills the English pint glass. The froth has great legs, a part of it sticks around for the entire experience. The amount of lacing is extensive, huge amounts of clumps at the top and then sheets as this beer disappears. The aromas are complex, dark mallts give a deep roasted and slight burnt scent that is reminiscent of coffee and chocolate, some sweet aroma. Some fruit aromas come through and maybe a little vanilla. Excellent roasted flavor that highlight the chocolate and roasted coffee that was noted in the aroma. Oat flavor seems to be there and I think adds to some of the smoothness, as this brew has a very creamy feel. Slight fruit presence as well as maybe a slight vanilla taste. As I said earlier has a very creamy feel across the tongue and in the back of the mouth. Carbonation is not extensive which is perfect for this brew, and has a pretty dry finish. This brew is excellent, one of the nicest "stouts" I have had in a long time. I will have to pick up more of this brew, though at the price it might be somewhat of a treat.","Stimack","Feb 07, 2010"

The beer never turns sweet as I've seen with many others in this style. Bittersweet chocolate also lingers on the palate through the finish. Medium bodied with appropriate carbonation.

There's a touch of sweetness, some caramel malts in the finish, but it is very light. This was thinner than I expected, on the lighter side of medium-bodied, decent carbonation for the style, slightly creamy going down.

Straightforward, but it translates well. Excellent, full thick mouthfeel carries the day. Just the right level of carbonation, not too much to overwhelm, but not too little to make it flat.

Almost reminds me of a Baltic Porter. Taste was rather average and quite honestly, a bit light. There are some dark malt flavours present and a bit of smoke toward the end. Finish was moderately bitter. Not a very complex stout at all. Mouthfeel was too thin, IMO; especially considering the style. Overall, this isn't a bad beer, but I feel this brewery could do better.

Medium in body with low carbonation. Smooth and creamy, burnt and roasty with a touch of sour as well as sweetness for a unique feel and good balance. When I want a stout that is a little bit different from the rest but still has it all, this would be among my top selections, satisfying, very easy to drink, and low in alcohol so it leaves more room for another (or something totally different).","HopDerek","Jan 26, 2009"

Taste is great and an all around example of well blended malts and oats. There is a slight sweetness and a big roastiness in the finish.

Enters the mouth a litttle thinner than I expected along with some scattered mediciney tones. A bit of soured bittered shrill asheyness is left on the tongue. This brew is no where near as tastey as the nose lead me to believe. It really lacks the creamy roasty richness that I would have loved to have had accompany the nose.

After dwindling slowly it forms a tight collar of lace on the rim of my Gulden Draak chalice, and with each sip fine speckled lacing is left behind. Aroma tartness with mild metallic notes, and dark powdered chocolate really dry and not much like I remember the draft softness of the oatmeal additions to come across in the nose. Definitely some cereal grains outside of patent black roasted malts the oatmeal is kicking just subdued by the dark roasts no real hop aromatics here. Somewhat tart and lactic with mild oxidation noted no date on the bottle here, but again not what I recall in my beer memory dark roasts with bitterness something practically burnt with these strange tart notes surfing around no real complex fruitiness just a mild funk brewing. Mild chocolate and coffee more so just dark baker's chocolate with a powdered cocoa finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied somewhat creamy textured carbonation is mellow and smooth no complaints in this department, finishes exuberantly dry.

After a few drinks, the sweet oatmeal really comes out in the taste. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and has just the right amount of carbonation. Drinkability is very good too, it's nice and smooth, and at only 5% ABV it's very sessionable too. Overall I think this is a good oatmeal stout.

It is on the light side of things, as the alcohol percentage suggests this is a fairly light beer on the tongue, it does not have the thick maltiness that one would find in an Imperial Stout that would have a nose like this beer does. Having said that the heft of this beer perfectly lives up to the 5% alcohol. This beer is an expressive mix of roasted barley, dark roast coffee, even espresso and a hint of dark chocolate. This beer has just a bit of oatmeal character to it that adds a touch of oily rich body to the palate. The beauty of this beer is that it combines the rich roast malt character of a beer far beyond this alcohol content yet still retains a balance that does not allow this ample roast character to overwhelm the this relatively low alcohol beer.","Gueuzedude","Sep 28, 2007"

Taste starts off with a toasted nutty malt character which is followed by the molasses and sweet oat flavors. This one finishes with sweet espresso notes that last forever, great aftertaste.

About two fingers of mocha brown head formed, and quickly settled into a thick glob in the middle of the glass. Left a reasonable amount lace behind. A nice smooth brown sugar aroma rose from the glass, followed by toffee, a slight hop presence, and a touch of cocoa. Also a little bit of a smokey, burnt coffee aroma was noticed. Wasn't as impressed with the taste as I was with the smell. Bitter burnt coffee, an almost bitter chocolate flavor, some smokey notes. Didn't really notice any hops like I did in the nose.

Tremendous lacing as well. The superb nose reveals scents of creamed coffee, darkly roasted grains, vanilla, and a slight milk-chocolate aroma. Probably the best-smelling Oatmeal Stout I've yet come across. The taste begins with a vanilla creaminess (but far from overtly vanilla-flavored) and moves on to a black-roasted malt grainy flavor. From there it rounds out into a dark coffee ground earthiness, with roasted grain flavors weaving back in for a spell, then finishes with a dry, slightly acidic mineral flavor. Dark-roasted coffee lingers in the aftertaste. Thinnish body, silky oat-inflected mouthfeel -- nothing less than spot on, stylistically speaking. Drinkability? Nary a day goes by without me trying to find a good excuse for heading across the river to see if the Beer Store in Ft. Erie has this. Easily one of the best Oatmeal Stouts in North America, if not the world.","orfeu","Oct 19, 2006"

The nose is somewhat strong, almosty scotch like with it's tar, smoke, and leather. The taste continues on this theme, but is accompanied by some malty sweetness.

The head is a deep tan, and builds to about two fingers before settling in and lasting, fluffy and thick, for as long as there's still beer in my glass, leaving thick sheets of lacing the whole way down. Smell is roasted coffee, rich and pungent, with an underlying sweetness coming together with a mild earthy note to promise a rich and complex brew. Taste is big and bold, with more of the coffee coming to the fore and a touch of hops accompanying the chocolate hints in the finish. Sweet fruits make an appearance as well, cherry and plum notes lingering on the palate for ages. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, and drinkability is superb. Truly stellar, the best oatmeal stout I've ever had.","Mandrake","Jul 21, 2006"

Taste is dead-on with big time coffee, chocolate, grains, and sweet malt characteristics. This reminds me a bit of a cream or milk stout. This stout is dry and silky. Meduim-bodied at best.

Taste is as goog as the smell, with bitter chocolate, coffee, more dark fruits, a nice roastiness blended with a sharp bitterness. Finish starts malty, and ends dry and bitter.

The mouthfeel is huge and very smooth. I used to drink this stuff all the time in my early university years, but the MLCC no longer carries it.

4.22,3.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Pouring from the familiar Mcauslan griffon-labelled bottle, the oatmeal stout is indeed very darkly black--I find almost no hint of red or brown(the bottle calls it "intensely dark"). The head can be quite large if you pour it that way; poured slowly and evenly I got 4 to 5 cm of brown-sugar coloured head, which, depending upon the glass, is quite consistent, but this time it went down to a thin layer. The dark foam is probably some of the darkest I have seen on a stout. The deep ebony of the liquid itself contributes to an extremely solid looking beer! Holding the glass to light or even to the computer screen shows only impenetrable black. Lacing is thick and viscous, even on my slightly damp glass. Even whilst pouring this masterpiece it exudes its rich aromas of milk chocolate and sweet raisins. Inhaling closer reveals burnt coffee, rye bread, sugared apples, cereal cream, spices and black licorice. The roasted character of the malt is absolutely exceptional, releasing toasted warm bread without being overly dry or pungent to the nose. Make certain to drink this beer at a comfortable room temperature to capture the full gamut of smells. Later I smell a good deal of fruitiness, even faint brown sugar or mollasses. The aroma never gets boring. Taste is quite dry all the way through the palate, but plays some sour, doughy flavours on the front of the tongue at first. In the middle is where most of the roasted malts and chocolate asserts itself. The first sip left a substantial finish of tobacco in my mouth, but subsequent quaffs left a more balanced, rather dry hoppy feel. Buttery bread, extremely sweetened coffee, raisins, grainy malt, spice, and baker's chocolate flavours. At first the body feels light in the mouth, but by the time it reaches the middle and back it is heavy and thick on the tongue. Creamy carbonation, but some definite astringency from the burnt malt and the alcohol, but the mouthfeel is still much above average. For me dry stouts such as this are not terribly drinkable in terms of amount--the parched feeling left in the mouth drys me out after 2. Still, this is a Stout I drink regularly, as it combines all the best elements of any stout I have tried, oatmeal or not. This deserves all the awards and praise it has garnered.","Cwrw","Apr 17, 2005"

The nose is very chocolaty and creamy with notes of sweet roasted cereals. Good head retention. Taste of a warm chewy oatmeal cookie with, chocolate covered espresso beans to round out and balance the flavours. A reasonably light mouthfeel, looks were deceiving. Towards the aftertaste, a roasted maltiness arrives late in the party but makes its presence felt. A malthops tug of war ensues slowly negotiating towards eventual equilibrium leaving lingering, faint impressions of cereals and roasted malt. A warm versatile brew that would be equally at home out on a Friday night at the pub or curling up beside a December fire. Heavy on taste, light on feel, a very nice brew.","LaSalle","Oct 05, 2004"

4.9,20.1,5,5,5,5,4.5,"The references to "stout" on the label and the standard bottle are circumstantial evidence that you're pouring beer and not 5w30. The huge, brown, doughy head makes you wait to get at that black gold. A rubber spatula comes in handy to scrape the huge clumps of lacing off the sides of the bowl and fold them back in. Sweet, roasty toffee, milky sweetness and a touch of smoke come off in the nose. Burnt toffee in the front gives way to a sweetish, full middle, where hints of fruit give it a tangy zing (or possibly a zingy tang). Some bitter chocolate too. The finish is bitter and dry, with charcoal notes. This is still one of my all-time favorite beers. It's really quite dry, with a very bitter finish. I wouldn't change a single thing about this (except maybe the bottle size). Makes me want to get back in my car and go get some more.","kbub6f","Jul 03, 2003"
4.47,9.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Originally sampled on 14 September 2002. Beautiful chocolate & oatmeal nose; black w/ a large tan head, this is an incredibly dry finishing beer. Very nice. In my opinion, this beer is the classic example of what an oatmeal stout should be. Seek it out.","jcalabre","May 24, 2003"

4.35,6.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours black with a brown rocky head that quickly shrinks to one quarter of its original size but sticks around until the last few sips are gulped down. An appetizing smoky bouquet is followed by complex flavors from roast malt and oatmeal and finished with a crisp dryness. This stout has a soft mouth feel and would go well with shellfish. A fine example of oatmeal stout, it’s a shame that St Ambroise does not appear to be available in the United States.","Bcant","Feb 12, 2003"
4.16,2,5,4,4,5,4,"Pours perfectly opaque black with a head like a chocolate milkshake. The aroma is big and bold with a slight lactic quality and a suggestion of tartness. The flavor is nicely roasty but balanced by the softer dark malts. Comes across like chocolate charcoal. Despite a slight harshness, the overall effect is a very soft beer. Oily on the tongue.","aracauna","Feb 05, 2003"

4.53,11,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"What a mouth watering site it is to see a World Class Stout sitting in its Chalice, the head all chocolate brown and creamy, majestically perched on that ebony fluid of life, Mine Anyway, with the prospect of fine sheets of lace to come as the head slowly ebbs away. The aroma of toasted oats, sweet chocolate, coffee, oh yes Im Drooling at the thought of the first taste. The start ambrosial, Liquid Pleasure, the top creamy rich and, voluptuous and the finish perfect in its carbonation, angelically hopped, bittersweet chocolate dry. What a treat, Eye Candy for sure, and a great treat for the rest of your sense also.","Gusler","Dec 18, 2002"
4.38,7.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"a wonderfully dark, almost black pour with a generous bronze head. Exceptionally smooth going down with great hints of roasted oates, dark chocolate and even a touch of coffee. this beer easily ranks as one of the world's top oatmeal stouts. it's my personal favorite!","Popsinc","Nov 17, 2002"
4.22,3.4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Notes: Quite robust and a little boisterous to the palate. Hmmm …. tastes like an oatmeal stout from the peek of the Micro-Brewery Revolution or at least a kick ass homebrew. Got to love this stuff … not many people have the balls to brew like this these days. Great stuff guys!","Jason","Oct 30, 2002"
4.41,8.1,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"for a non-nitro (I think) beer, this has a heck of a nice creamy head.  Came with the perfect amount of it too.   The taste is excellent: smooth, a little bitter, some roasted flavours.  This went down very well, I'll certainly be back to that bar for more of this!","the42ndtourist","Sep 21, 2002"
4.28,4.9,5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Thanks to a trade with a Canadian beer lover for this one! Outstanding Stout, although I still like Sam Smith's a little more. My only negative comment about this one is that the alcohol flavor was not hidden as well as it could have been (or do we call that "bitterness"?). Roasted aroma and nice coffee flavoring. Almost black with great lacing. I am going to try to hunt this one down again sometime.","Dogbrick","Sep 13, 2002"
2.51,-38.5,4,3,2,2.5,2.5,"Wow! It was like drinking soy sauce!No roasted coffee hints,none!Good color no head at all,it was sour pungent just horrible.Age obviosly got to this beer Iam not sure how it found its way down here in NC but Iam sure it had been siting there for awhile,I will retry at some point and re-review.","oberon","Jun 05, 2002"
