Balanced and clean. 100% recommend this brew. While I said in the mouthfeel that I wanted it to be creamier, I feel that if it were, it might make it into an entirely different brew in terms of booziness and drinkability, so I think it being the way it is works for it, there are other brews that come at the oatmeal stout from a more ""imperial"" angle.","JMScowcroft","Sep 14, 2013"

Aroma is strong on the milk chocolate with lighter notes of coffee, roast and some grainy oats. Taste is similar with a predominately milk chocolate flavor with light roasty malts and a slight metallic aftertaste. Mouth feel is on the thinner side of things leading the beer to be somewhat lacking. Really needs more body to support the chocolate. Overall, a bit of a thin example of the style but still rather tasty and enjoyable. Not bad at all.","davey101","Jul 21, 2013"

The roasty flavors are there but they don't overpower the sweet and chocolatey flavors. The mouthfeel is what really sets this one apart. Rich, smooth, and creamy. Dry finish with moderate bitterness. Perfect example of what an oatmeal stout should be. I think I'll be reaching for this one often.","thlayli87","Jun 29, 2013"

3.95,-0.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, vibrant, chestnut highlighted brown color with a tall, frothy, lightweight, light tan head that starts tall, but quickly settles into a quarter inch of retaining head. Aromas of milk chocolate, roasted coffee and grains, and a creamy sweetness. Smells solid and tasty. Flavors are roasted coffee backbone, with bitter and roasty characters overall. Chocolate overtones that lean more towards bitter and dark than the milk chocolate that was present on the nose. The beer is light and dry in mouth, with the bitterness giving is a slightly sharp, very clean finish. Tangy sweetness in the aftertaste, with the bittersweet chocolate cutting that quickly. Very good, tasty, dynamic, layered stout. Lower ABV keeps the drinkability high. Solid brew.","GarthDanielson","Dec 07, 2012"

The aroma from this beer is quite intoxicating. Toasty and roasty grains with hints of caramel and chocolate balanced by a bit of earth and a hint of dark fruit. The flavor is roasty and chocolate with bits of bread, caramel, and toffee. There's a light fruity sweetness with enough dry roastiness to provide great balance. Light earthy hop flavor with little to no apparent hop bitterness. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a dry grainy roasty mouthfeel. This beer smells incredible and tastes pretty good too.","johnnnniee","Dec 07, 2012"

Flavor is very nice, combining the expected roasted malt taste with a bit of bittersweet chocolate and a sort of molasses sweetness in the rear. I had this very fresh and the herbal, piney hops were prominent. Nicely creamy mouthfeel, decent carbonation, thick enough to give it some substance. The one complaint I would make about this beer is I felt the bitterness of the finish went on too long; still tasted the hops about an hour and a few glasses of water later. I like the hops but they dominated the finish too strongly for my taste, overwhelming the other aspects of this beer and kind of wiping them from my memory. Perhaps a little too fresh, methinks. Still, not bad.","tobelerone","Oct 13, 2011"

The flavor speaks out with a tart coffee bitterness, while the chocolate idea settles into a more subtle blend with leafy hop and even lemon highlights. This beer is a solid medium bodied to full bodied deal that is near silky in feel though a touch thin, very easy drinking...and it's organic!

Taste is pretty weak compared to the nose, but the nice flavors make up for it. Coffee is definitely the main thing going on, chocolate + oat come through more so as it's going down. A decent amount of hops.A bit of vanilla sweetness starts to show through in the finish. Mouthfeel almost feels watery thin at times, but this isn't exactly a high-body beer anyway and it makes it very drinkable.

This is a great characteristic, but I wonder if they didn't overdo it by just a little too much. It's a smooth beer, but the flavor is really upfront and I am not sure if I would want several of these in one sitting. This stout is definitely a sipping beer.

A fine looking brew and on par for a stout. Aroma is roasty, noticably hoppy though not overwhelmingly so; both milky and sweet aromas underly the roastiness. Concerned that this will taste too jagged for my tastes from the aroma. Taste is very full, and as it goes down its smooth, nary a trast of harshness. It's gently hoppy, the hops keep up but no more and leave the flavor to the malts which is much like the smell, roasty but no char, very appealing with a subtle sweetness, bingo. Flavors are subtle but complexity without needing to be a big beer. The mouthfeel is just outstandingly creamy and somehow both full on the tongue and yet not syrupy or unpleasant, but medium bodied in consistency. Masterful. Overall a great stout that I originally felt was too dark and bitter (early on), but now that I apreciate darker beers more, this will be one of the the ones I stock; this one will win out over even SN stout in my fridge.","Liquids","Jan 17, 2008"

I'm going to give credit to the oats for the light residual sweetness and the silky nature of the body my tongue is luxuriating in. Finish leaves my mouth lightly dry with a hint of hoppy bitterness. Really nicely done. Tasty, great feel, and extremely drinkable. It could have a fuller body but in that case I'd probably drop the drinkability score a touch to match.

Espresso is definitely most prominent in the taste, along with some dark chocolate and lovely oat malt. Hops do this beer well; I haven't had many of the style, but this one is amazingly well balanced. Enough bitterness to go round yet not interfere with the stouty goodness at all. After the initial burst of flavor, there comes a slight twang of alcohol followed by the lingering flavor of burnt toast.

Pour creates a thick creamed-coffee head, but with short retention -- 5 minutes later the head is gone, but there remains lace around the glass and some floating islands of foam. Smells slightly burnt, not smoky, and thin, as if lighter malts were toasted longer to force more color from them, but with weaker smell. Tastes a little burnt, and bitter but not in an overall unpleasant way. The body is thinner compared to Smith's, and the carbonation is stronger and sharper. Carbonation is not overdone or bad, but it doesn't seem to 'support' or add creaminess as the SSOS does.

The sourness I usually associated with oatmeal stouts is mildly present in the flavour, but well hidden. Flavour is relatively straightforward -- smoke, mild coffee, tangy but not overbearing hops. Mouthfeel's a little thin for the style, in my opinion. Tangy, bittersweet aftertaste.","crwills","Dec 02, 2007"

More coffee and bittersweet chocolate with a lingering burnt aftertaste. There is a nice hop bitterness that works well with the astringent dark malts. The oatmeal really gives this beer a nice body and mouthfeel.","ericj551","Nov 18, 2007"

It poured with a small amount of head that had no retention and left a small amount of lacing in the glass. The smell is pretty intense. Nutty and roasted smells come out and of course coffee. The taste is similar. Definitely some roasted malts in the taste. The mouthfeel could be described as chewey, imagine eating a coffee flavored granola bar.Heavy body.

I walked into the bar at the Borgata one afternoon and was happy to just find a good macro. This went well beyond my expectations.

Bittering hops give a quick finish. The roast flavor comes back with the next sip. Velvety, luscious mouthfeel leaving a very slight powdery feel on the tongue. High drinkability.

The aroma is a dessert-like heaven ... fudge-like chocolate, bit of espresso heat. The first swig is a nice delivery of toasty coffee.

There was little lacing, but what was there was thick. The smell is biscuity and nutty with coffee scents. The taste is full of caramel, coffee, chocolate and toasty, slightly smoked vanilla.

What I do taste is dark roasted maltiness: primarily cocoa and a bit of coffee. Spicy and floral hop bitterness is evident from the middle to the finish. Slight acidity emerges in the aftertaste. Earthy hops haunt burps. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, but the body is far too light: medium-thin. Nothing about this stout is going to clobber you, so I guess in that sense it's relatively easy to drink. The taste is pretty solid, but it just seems too light in appearance and in body for me to give it higher marks.

My personal favorites of the style are Anderson valley barney flats (due to its robustness) and Samuel Smith's (for its flavor). But this one falls flat compared to those. Still a fairly enjoyable beer, but nothing to set it apart. TBH, I'm surprised its a ~4.0 beer, as it pretty much comes up a little short in most aspects.","BrewMan13","Sep 25, 2005"

Tasted Chocolate to start with some sweet. Then a rich sweet rolling in with a coffee and a silky smooth body. Oh boy, this is enjoyable. The end is a bit roasty dry with a *very* faint floral hop rising up. Can't put my finger on the particular hop, perhaps Fuggles. I wish there were more to this beer other than chocolate and coffee, but that's about all I get (mostly coffee). True, there of several different kinds of coffee that roll around, but no other flavors arise to take me on interesting rides. Very enjoyable and very rich and potent in flavor. Md-thick body with mild carbonation. Fantastic lacing on the inside of my glass with a film of head still hanging over the top of the liquid.

3.87,-2.8,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Dark brown if not black in hue, when held to a light ruby highlights shine around the edges. A foamy brown head reached a maximum height of one finger, and then it quickly faded to a bubbly cap. The subsequent lacing was almost none. The nose is quite pleasant. There is great roasted depth with aromas of chocolate, hints of milk, oats, charred wood (not smoky), earth, and coffee. All of these smells work in perfect harmony. This is close to perfection. The bouquet is terrific, there is reasonable potency and the invitation is quite clear. The palate is almost as pleasant as the nose. The alcohol warmth seems out of place to me. The heat is off-putting, just a bit. There are excellent roasted flavors: earthy, charred wood with astringent acidity that melts into one with the chocolate flavors. The coffee stands alone, as does the herbal hoppines. The oats do an excellent job of rounding out the flavors; nothing becomes too extensive or too aggressive. The flavors are straightforward. This is a very tasty beer until the aftertaste, which seems flawed because it tastes like rubbing alcohol, it isnt very strong but it is still gross. I managed to get around this well enough and Id still consider the palate to be very lovely. The mouthfeel is a little too thin for me, it lacks in bulk and the fact there is very low carbonation doesnt help this aspect of that beer much. The consistency is a bit creamy. This is a good Oatmeal Stout, the recipe seems very old school, like centuries old. Im digging that! This was quite good, IMO, this is a hard style to get right. This one was close.

Pours a dark dream, a proper black, though the yellow brown head wouldnt appear no matter how much distance I put between the mug and the beer. I usually have a difficult time getting any sort of distinct smell from beer, but this particular brew drew me in with the smell of roast, almost burnt coffee. Taste is marvelous, thick and complex. I detect chocolate, coffee, hops, oatmeal and other indeterminate tastes all intermingling together. Carbonation is subtle and subdued. This beer would go great with a real hearty meal, like steak and potatoes. Easy to finish and easy to drink, a beer I would highly recommend to most, and embellish on for organic food eating folk. And to think, I was never that great a fan of oatmeal!","RocketWidget","Jan 05, 2004"
4.08,2.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"This is a jet black brew with a nice brown/tan head of foam. The aromas are of roasted malts, oats, sweet hops, and slight alcohol. The taste is very roasted, yet sweet, with some nice hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, just about perfect, IMO and the drinkability is good as well. A nice version of the style!","francisweizen","Jan 04, 2004"
4.2,5.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"A dark delicious stoudt with traces of coffee and the obvious oatmeal. Very rich with a great taste followed by an even better aftertaste. This is a great beer to sit back and relax near a fire on a cold night. The people from Wolaver's created something special with this brew. With a tan head and a silky smooth look this beer goes down with a fizzy taste and a oaty finish. Great for any beer lover.","stewart124","Dec 23, 2003"

4.4,10.6,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"this one was fresh as hell: bottled 11.03.03. drank: 11.18.03. kudos to otter creek/wolaver's for continuously getting fresh beer to the market. the new wolaver's oatmeal stout pours a dark, dark brown to near black colour, with a slightly off-white, creamy head that leaves a nice stickiness on the glass. a sweet smell dominates here, with chocolate, coffee, oats and hops apparent. the taste is quite similar to the smell, with all of the aformentioned detected before a nice dry finish. the order that the flavours hit me seemed to be: chocolate to oat to earthy flavours to coffee to the dry hop finish. very nice. this one is silky smooth and creamy and quite easy to drink. a great oatmeal stout. easily recommended.","SixpointJMH","Nov 20, 2003"
4.3,8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"In my opinion, a spot on Oatmeal Stout, very solid, well-balanced, easy to drink, packed with character and a great addition to the Wolaver's line-up of organic brews.","Todd","Nov 12, 2003"
