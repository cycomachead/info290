Thin mouthfeel even for nitro--which always comes off thin to me, despite the silkiness--and low carbonation. Overall, I would take this over Guinness, but it’s just not my style. What’s the point?

It pours a straight murky onyx topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises mild roasted malts, cocoa powder, and a touch of vanilla bean in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, though now the vanilla is replaced by a bit of treacle. The body is a solid medium, with a nice nitrogenation and a subsequently velvety feel. Overall, a nice, by-the-numbers oatmeal stout. Not bad at all.","TMoney2591","Aug 06, 2014"

3.97,2.3,4,3.75,4,4.25,4,"On nitro tap at 2 Bros. Pours a dark brownish black color with over an inch of thick brown head. Good amount of lacing. The aroma is roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and earth. Taste is a lot like the aroma. Roasty and lightly smokey with dark chocolate. Light hints of sweet vanilla and oatmeal. Slight dark chocolate bitterness but it's a sweet beer overall. Caramel and toasted malts at the finish. Has that nice velvety and creamy mouthfeel you expect from nitro. Overall, I'm glad I got to try this on nitro and would like to have a chance to try the regular version. Worth looking for.","PicoPapa","Apr 05, 2014"

Nice nitro-pour, obsidian color with a thick, creamy, tan head that sank to about a quarter inch and held there, lacing the glass as I sipped. Pretty basic aroma, roasty dark malts, toasted oatmeal. Basically the same in the taste, dark malts, toasted oats, unsweetened chocolate giving a light bitterness. A good brew, even if there's nothing here you haven't had before. Medium body, smooth mouthfeel, thanks to Mr. Nitrogen. A pretty basic brew, but still good. Doesn't really stack up to Founders' other stouts, but it's a solid base beer.","Rifugium","0"

I don't recall seeing it, but its one heck of a good beer on the nitro tap. perfect for winter, but I could get into this year round.","StonedTrippin","Dec 19, 2013"

I think this may be the first one I've had that sits this far on the dry, earthy part of the scale. It's not as dry as an Irish-style stout, but it's certainly no milk stout or sweet stout. A very interesting interpretation, but I think I prefer a little more sweetness on the palate (even at the expense of some of the silkiness on the feel).","deadonhisfeet","Sep 22, 2013"

For an oatmeal stout the aroma stayed way roasty, sweet, and happily smoky for the style, while the flavoring showed robustness, but did cheapen a bit along with the feel as the beer warmed. The feel did begin soft and silky, but as the tasting went on it lost that bright effervescence and became a bit watery. Otherwise it is nicely contributory and actually bolsters the creaminess and milk chocolates of the taste. This is a tasty offering, and pleasant on nitro, but be sure to drink it on the cooler side for that full effect.","TheBrewo","May 14, 2013"

That being said I found this to be a very pretty yet bland beer. It had everything going for it but it tasted like a stout for the masses. And, the feel I got from the crowed and some other brewery only offerings was that they were trying to appeal to the masses.

4.17,7.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"So as I go in and take a closer look I was a bit surprised to be honest. This really did not smell much like an oatmeal stout. At least to me it was much more reminiscent of a Baltic porter, well at first it did. It had that sharp alcohol nose to it and a hint of some dark spicy fruit mixed in. Quite interesting and definitely more then a little unique. I decided to let it warm to really bring out what was hiding in here and then came out the nice sweet notes of chocolate and coffee along with hints of lactose that I was looking for. The flavors followed along with a hint again something sweet, but yet a tart sort of fruit flavor as well. Very nice. Very rich full body on this one with great carbonation that never really gave up any ground at all.","mikesgroove","Mar 14, 2011"

4.14,6.7,5,3.5,4,5,4.5,"(D)- This is something you order a keg of! Has everything great about a stout and has the drinkability of a great session beer. Fantastic flavor, balance, and drinkability?! Just solid stuff. My only complaint is where is the oatmeal? This just reminds me of an Irish dry stout to me.","sweemzander","Sep 22, 2009"
4.06,4.6,5,4,4.5,4,3,"D Fair. The style does not lend itself to be particularly drinkable in my opinion. Make no mistake, this is a great beer but the style is not terribly drinkable. 3.0","adamette","Feb 28, 2009"
4.23,9,4.5,4,4,5,4.5,"What a great beer. This was had on a nitro tap at the bar. This had really good lasting head and fine lacing all the way to the end. The beer had a black body with a huge foamy tan head. The aroma was roasty. The taste was roasty with a nice smokiness as well. Some very slight hops taste, perhaps Goldings, as I found a slight floral fruitiness to it. Mouthfee was smoooth, very silky, very to style. Yum!","Reneejane","Feb 07, 2009"
3.68,-5.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"On draft at Founders. Pours a dark brown in color with a nice half inch head. Smell is black malt and a little coffee. Nice and creamy on the mouthfeel. A decent beer, but lacking the complexity and bombardment of flavor that you get in most Founders beers. I guess you get spoiled drinking Breakfast and Kentucky Breakfast and truly don't appreciate a well made oatmeal stout like this.","FtownThrowDown","Dec 20, 2008"

4.13,6.4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Poured black in color with 3/4" of creamy eggshell head, great lacing all the way through with retention that just won't go away. Smells of toasted malt, chocolate, oat, and a slight hint of coffee. Tastes of roasted oat, chocolate malt, and coffee with a dry roasted malt/floral hop finish. Medium in body, smooth and creamy with nice roasted flavors. Goes down easy, great flavors and low ABV make this a quite sessionable beer for stout lovers.","HopDerek","May 04, 2007"

3.53,-9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall, This is a good Oatmeal Stout, unfortunately it is a beer that should be ordered for dessert, and I ordered it to start off with. I strongly suggest having this one to end a meal, and not to start one as I did.","leftmindedrighty","Jul 08, 2006"
4.53,16.8,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I think this is an outstanding stout. It pours a fantastic brown head that is very thick dense and creamy. This body of the beer is black. It is so smooth. Coffee, chocolate, creamy. I really love this beer. The flavor is not overwhelming or over the top, all the edges are very smooth. Overall, great beer and at five percent you can afford to tip back a few.","adammills","Jun 17, 2006"
4.14,6.7,4.5,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Unbelievably smooth rich and creamy. Dark chocolate prevails, with a vanilla, oatmeal twist. Bold statements of strong coffee. Very delicious and refreshing and drinkable as hell.","mcallister","May 14, 2006"
4.55,17.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"This one is a winner. Pours a midnight black with a dark tan head that fades quickly. Smells a little sweet with burnt characteristics. Taste is similar but amazingly smooth. I have never had a beer this smooth. The only thing close was Murphy's Stout, but this is up a notch. The taste was great as well as the mouthfeel. This beer was like velvet across the palette. I enjoyed it very much. I could drink these at any time, a very versatile beer. Go to founders and pick one of these up! Delicious!","wingman14","Apr 23, 2006"
3.61,-7,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Overall, a good "break" beer if one is sampling a few things...it's one of the lower ABV beers at Founders and despite that, has a very solid, if not overly distinct flavour.","CortexBomb","Jul 04, 2005"

3.66,-5.7,4,3,4,3,4,"My first nitro-tap. Obviously it took awhile for the head to dissipate but eventually I got a dark beer with a creamy tan head. I really couldn't get much from the aroma because of the nitro (i think). The taste was very roasted. Roasted oatmeal, roasted coffee, and more roasted grains (i think i tasted rye). This beer had a definite bitterness to it which I think is from the grains (not a hoppy bitterness). However there was an acidity in the finish that I could've done without. A really good beer that I would like to try without the nitro, but I'm glad I tried it atleast once on nitro-tap.","granger10","Beers"
