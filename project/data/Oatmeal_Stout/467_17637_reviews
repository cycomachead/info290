"Dark brown black color with a nice tan head. Aroma of coffee, chocolate and roasty malt. Taste follows with chocolate and coffee with a hint of toffee. The mouthfeel is smooth, but slightly thinner than I prefer. Overall a decent oatmeal stout."

"Great beer. Very smooth and drinkable, extremely pleasant. Heavy notes of oatmeal and malts, extremely pleasant in appearance. Head clings to the glass, making for a very appealing flavor and look. Notes of malts and oatmeal are outstanding. One of my top beers personally."

"Overall, this draft-only beer from Summit is a great example of the style and I'm pleased I got to try it."

"O- superb for the style so drinkable with the ABV so low with so much stout flavor love this brew"

"A great season stout with an amazing smoothness and everything you expect from an oatmeal stout."

"O - I was wow'd by this beer when I saw it on tap. I went in not expecting much but what I got was one of the best oatmeal stouts I have ever had!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. This has been one of my favorites for a while. Proof that stout doesn't need 8 plus ABV or to be barreled to be great. The richness of the coffee and sweets balances perfectly with the bitterness. Zesty aftertaste stays with you. One Summit's greats."

"This is a real treat on cask. I have had it via nitro, and that is like every other nitro beer I have ever had. Meaning it kills all nuance and body. On cask this is very nice, and a perfect example of why nitro should be abolished. Not even the same beer. Highly recommended on cask."

"Served this Oatmeal Stout on tap, in a pint glass. Poured a very nice dark brown color, almost black, produced a tan average head, retention was average and it left ample lacing on the glass. The aroma of this stout consisted of roasted grain, and milk chocolate. Full bodied, this stout is smooth, creamy slick- You notice the mouthfeel almost before you taste anything. Roasted grain, milk chocolate, a splash of coffee complete the flavor profile of this beer. Excellent session beer, very nice example of a traditional oatmeal stout."
""

""
""
""

"Final Thoughts: This is one of my favorite offerings from Summit. It's also one of the hardest to get. If you are a fan of stouts or porters then give this one a try if you are lucky enough to find it on tap!"

"What a creamy delight (TWSS)! I had this on tap on the 4th of July and the hottest day of the year. Despite the heat, I really liked this thick, rich beer. It poured with a heavy foam into a dark color. The smell was pleasant but not overwhelming. The taste was ALL STOUT! It was rich, creamy, and flavorful without a single hint of alcohol aftertaste. It was thick and filling. A+"

"Overall: My buddies and I tried a bar in St. Paul called Groveland Tap and I was particularly excited because I saw it had this beer on tap. This is one of the best beers I've tried in some time. I will recommend it without hesitation to anyone."
""
""
""
""
"Easy drinker. Excellent stout, a good example of the style. Well worth checking out."
""
""
""
"Overall- This is a really solid stout. It tastes great and feels pretty good. I would have this again and again."
"Pours a deep brown black with a dense foamy three finger khaki head. Very mild on the nose, a hint of dark roasted chocolate malt, oats and leather. Pleasant flavors, chocolate, bit of cocoa, mild oatmeal, and a smidgen of smoke rounds out the dark roasted malt backbone. Fairly dry, modestly carbonated, creamy and smooth. Solid offering from Summit."
""
"Dr: Incredibly drinkable. Uses cream to overcome stout dryness instead of succumbing to porter-esque workarounds. The oat smoothness synergizes brilliantly with the nitro-draught system."
""
""
"Found this in all places, Stone City, IA right outside Anamosa on tap!! Was pretty excited to try it. Pours a dark black with tan head. Aroma of roasted malts, somewhat faint. Flavor is roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolate. Very smooth and an awesome creamy texture. Two thumbs up!"
""
""
"Overall, not a bad brew, but definitely not a favorite. Still, good and fairly drinkable as a night-cap."
""
"Poured into a pint glass, a dark brownish black, a bit light and clear around the edges when held to the light. A creamy tan head that retained and laced well. Smell of roasty malts and smoke. Taste was very dry and roasty, dark malts, and smokey leather, with a beef jerky sensation detectable. Coffee bitterness in the finish. Medium-bodied and fairly drinkable, though not the kind of stout I'd want to order for a casual session."
""
""
""
"Overall: Medium bodied with low carbonation. Pretty good here. I did not care for this oatmeal stout much. Maybe due to the fact that it was on nitro tap it killed the flavors, but I found it pretty weak all in all. I'd try this out again if given the chance."
"I had this beer after a Summit brewery tour. Pours great with a great head. Taste is even better with an exceptional finish. Smell is different than most stouts because of the oatmeal. Hard to find but if you find it you should definitely try it.One of the best stouts I've ever had."
"Overall: A very solid version of an oatmeal stout from Summit. Great for when you want a dark beer with a lighter body or something that goes great with a scoop of ice cream."
"A nice low ABV stout that is very easy to drink."
"O. I hope I have to come back just to have this beer. I will definitely be looking for it"
"I really like this stuff and it makes me wonder about the other Summit offerings."
"Overall-One of my favorites from Summit, which tends to go a little heavy on the bitter hops for most of their brews."
"D/O- Pretty easy going oatmeal stout, may become slightly bored with this offering after a pint or two."
"D: Very high. At 4.7%, it's extemely sessionable, and a great winter warmer. I couldn't wait to order a growler of this."
"Draft. On tap at Town Hall Tap on nitro. Super dark brown color, almost black, with a tiny bubbled tan head. Roasted malted, coffee, and dark chocolate notes in the nose. Nice lace on the glass. Smooth, velvety medium mouthfeel, mmmm only nitro can be this smooth. Very smooth flavor, roast coffee and dark chocolate notes with an overall nice rounded out flavor. Tasty. Ends fairly dry."
"D: Goes down so smooth, it is almost dangerous. Great at any time of day, from morning (on the special occasion or before a great sporting match) to the evening. Only drawback is availability. I wish I could have a pint by the fire on a cold Minnesota night, but absent a nitro-tap and keg fridge, I will have to save it for special occasions."
"On tap at BLue Door pub, comes to the table a gorgeous deep dark broung with a delicious looking cream colored head. Smells dark and roasty like a good stout should. Taste is on par with the style, not better than others, but very good. Solid mouthfeel, a bit thin at times but very solid. Very drinkable, I would order this again in a heartbeat."
"pint at Gunflint, Grand Marais, MN"
"D: Nearly chuggable, however, the incredible presence of oats makes the beer become slightly tedious toward the end of the glass"
"D - This is probably the best Oatmeal stout I've had very good taste thats very easy to drink worth getting if you see it on tap"
"drinkable"
"D - I wouldn't want to drink this again, poor mouthfeel and taste rates it low on this particular variable."
"Flavor is also a bit muted, with creamy oats and charred chocolate malts leading the way. Summit's oatmeal stout is tasty, but I expected a bit more from this beer as it fell a bit flat in the middle. Noticeable blandness towards the finish, but thankfully a bit of roasted chocolate malt picks up the slack. Great mouthfeel, courtesy of our friend, the 7th atomic element. Smooth, chewy, slick, velvety...all of the above in terms of body. All in all, a decent brew, but I would choose several other stouts over this one. Still, it's definitely worth a try."
"I love this beer. Best offering from Summit. Wish more places had it on tap."
"Looks like espresso during the first second of the pour followed by the nice cascade effect from the nitrogen and just under two fingers worth of creamy nitro-head. Smell is very similar, espresso and coffee, with a very slight sweetness of chocolate. First taste is of roasted barley finishing with a malty sweetness. Full Bodied and lingers for little while after it's gone. A very nice alternate to Guinness for desert."
"Drinkablility is great, this may be the definition of a session stout."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink with more flavor than a typical nitro beer. Great Oatmeal Stout overall."
"So easy to drink and a low ABV to boot. I wish some way some how Summit could package this for consumers. This has to be my favorite oatmeal stout."
"I'd like to see a fuller, non-nitro version bottled, because it has a lot of upside, but the current situation is akin to an oated Guinness. Good session stout, but a bit hollow."
"Pours black with a light tan head that cascades in the body of the beer for a while after it's poured. Aroma was of roasted malts and creaminess. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and super silky-smooth. Flavors were a perfect mix of roasted, toasted malt with hints of cream and coffee. I was anticipating that this would be good and it exceeded those expecations. This is to date the best beer I've ever tasted."
"Came to the table with a foamy, tan, 2 finger head and a dark black color, with streaks of red when held to the light. The taste and aroma have coffee, oatmeal, and chocolate. Smooth and creamy, medium bodied, the carbonation is fairly light. Nice drinkability, with a mix of sweetness and coffee bitterness. Nicely made."
"D- Surprisingly, this is quite drinkable beer, for me at least. This is probably my favorite beer from Summit."
"Drinkability: I feel like I could drink this all night long and just enjoy it. I would be quite content drinking this on a late fall night, into winter."
"Served in a tulip glass, slightly chilled at the Happy Gnome in St. Paul, MN, on cask no less! This shows a deep and solid brown black with a fair fuzzy light brown head and good, steady lacing. The aroma brings on some classic coffee, vaguely smokey malt. Chocolate floats around as usual, pretty nice overall. The taste offers much more of that charcoal smoke with sweet apple malt and more subtle coffee hints. This is sweet and smooth with a slightly dry finish but quite drinkable for the style. Decent liveliness for a cask, but mid-bodied overall. I enjoyed this a bit more than most cask brews, not knock your socks off great but a solid brew very much worth a try if you happen upon a cask like I did tonight!"
"On tap at the brewery. Heavy cascading action as I watch being drawn off the tap. The head is thick and creamy. The nose is mildly malty and smells almost ""creamy"" with some touches of smoke. The flavor is consistent with the nose. Rich and creamy mouthfeel with a slight touch of smoke flavoring. Clean finish that is very light considering all that is going on. The rich flavor and mouthfeel and the fullness of the flavors would lead me to expect more of a residual aftertaste. It stays pretty clean and the creaminess begs to be sipped again."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer, except the burnt flavor. Easy drinking stout. I could easily have another, as my pint is going fast. I recommend this one if you are around the Twin Cities."
"Would love to see this in bottles sometime. And I would prefer carbonation in the bottle rather than a nitro-widget. This would produce a better match to the ""on tap"" mouthfeel. Excellent offering from Summit."
"This beer is definitely the sum of its parts, quality ingredients, quality brewing, quality beer."
"D: Not as smoky as most stouts I've tried which makes it very easy for me to drink. I think I may have a new favorite dark beer."
"d= very good. pretty decent. i wish it wasnt on nitro tap, it prolly woulda had more flavor."
"D: Highly drinkable and every sip enjoyable."
"Had this on nitro at Whistle Binkies. Pours a dark brown/black color with a creamy tan head that left sheets of lacing down the glass. Very nice! Aroma was a little light, some watered down roasty malts, hints of chocolate. Taste was very nice. Roasted malts were in good supply, some chocolate and coffee notes, and a nice creaminess. I for one do not like nitro-tap brews. While the flavor of this beer was spot on, the body was off for me. Yes, it was creamy, but it was definitely missing that carbonation bite that would have really made this beer sing. The nitro basically ruined this for me and made a good beer less drinkable. It just seemed like flat, watery beer. Where is the body on this thick tasting brew?? If I could find this carbonated with CO2, I would enjoy it much more."
"The taste is outstanding, smooth, rich and flavorful, lots of creamy, malty goodness.The beer just slides down the throat; it isn't fizzy like some stouts I've had, just smooth and rich. At 4.8%, with smooth and easy drinking the Summit Oatmeal presents, this is a perfect session beer."
"May I suggest pairing this brew with a Signature Burger (at Stub and Herb in Mpls of course), sub fries with the 10,000 Lakes dressing (great both on the burger and with the fries). A solid choice for anyone before a sporting event or just out for dinner."
"What a treat. Fresh stout, with a heady aroma, damn near jet black in the glass, with a beautiful creamy head. Lovely smoky oats flavor, with a long aftertaste, smooth, and not overwhelming in alcohol. This is one beer I can drink all evening. Summit's masterpiece."
"On tap at Irish Fair O8. Nearly jet black with a thick tan head. Mild earthy, roasty aroma that gets much stronger after it warms up a bit. Wonderfull chocolate and coffee flavors with a rather sweet finish. Hops are there for balance but that seems to be it. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy(oats?). This is a smooth stout with no pretentions. Just drink it and be happy."
"First off, this was slowly and properly poured at Stub & Herbs in Mpls. Appearance is a deep jet-black with a gorgeous frothy tan head that you could float a quarter on. Aromas of roast malt and dark bitter chocolate are everywhere with a hint of grassy English hops. Flavor is....well, silky smooth and oh so creamy again with the roast malts and dark bitter chocolate. Hop bitterness and flavor are just enough to balance out the sweetness and creaminess. This is a great quaffing beer and if I would change anything it would be to allow the oats to come through a bit more. This was more like a Guinness than an oatmeal stout but an awesome stout nonetheless."
"Wonderful rich deep brown-black color with a deep tan head that holds up throughout and leaves nice lacing towards the end. Nice malt smell--hints of coffee as well. Taste had a very rich coffe flavor with hints of chocolate. Thick in the mouth, rich and smooth. A very good stout."
"D-A solid simple brew. Nothing about screams out but nothing detracts either. Good, plain and simple."
"Drinkability is good, only inhibited by the mouthfeel being a bit heavier."
"overall, i LOVED this brew, enough so in fact that the friends and i will be making weekly trips up to Hudson for this"
"D: Great all around beer. I'm very impressed by this one and would definitely enjoy a few in a night."
"Served a bit cold and with a tall head, but once it warmed up and settled down it was quite nice. It was a simple, smooth oat and cocoa with coffee-like roasted grains with wonderfully long aftertaste. Probably still my favorite Summit beer and a very worthy session beer."
"I could drink many of these as they are extremely sessionable and easy to drink."
"Jet black in color, with a creamy tan head. The head disappeared very quickly, which was disappointing. Soft, roasty aroma with hints of vanilla, and milk chocolate. Lightly roasted coffee flavor, with a bit of chocolate. Not much sweetness. Seems to lack the velvet mouthfeel, and silky texture of a great oatmeal stout. A bit thin. A small amount of lingering bitterness. Not heavy, and pretty easy to drink. Maybe a hint of fruit at the end, but not much. This is pretty simple, easy to drink, but not outstanding."
"Mouth is creamy but slightly thin. A stout that is easily sessionable."
"I've had this at a few places around town now, it has taken its place atop my rankings for Summit beers. This is quite good and I'm glad I tried it!"
"On tap at Whistle Binkies. This beer poured a black color with a thick, creamy, white head. Lacing was thorough, and left rings all the way down the glass. The aroma is of cream, graham cracker, and roasted malt, but was rather faint (probably from the nitro system). The taste was very solid. Roasted malt, cream, graham cracker. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, and silky smooth. Overall, this is by far Summit's best beer, and I wish they would make it more available. I could easily drink this all night."
"Drinkability is good. At 4.7% it is definitely sessionable. I think Summit hit the mark with this one. If you find it, give it a try!"
"Black throughout, the slightest red at the bottom. Creamy tan nitro-tap head on top. The aroma is quite sweet, with some roasted coffee and malt. The flavor also has a fair amount of dark roated malt flavor, but is sweet and chocolaty, with cherries, and some hops lingering in the aftertaste. A sweet and smooth stout, easy to drink. Pretty standard for the style. Good work Summit."
"On tap at the Summit Brewing Company. Nice black pour with a medium, dense tan head. The smell was nice and roasty. Taste had some coffee, a bit of chocolate, and some oats. Mouthfeel was nice and creamy/silky with light carbonation and was fairly clean and refreshing for the style. Drinkability was fair, and this would make a hearty addition to a good meal (especially breakfast)."
"D- This doesn't come out to assult your senses. The taste begins to grow and become more complex and you really start to appreciate this beer. Like Guinesss, made to drink a ton off by being ultra smooth and sessionable. I just wish they would brew this more often, not just around Irish Fair time."
"From notes. On nitro at the Dubliner...several times. Dark, roasted brown/black body with a fat, dense cocoa brown cushion of nitro head. Nose is relatively mild but pleasant, with notes of light chocolate, coffee, and a twinge of sweetish malt. Taste is similar, but with more pronounced flavors. Chocolatey oat-malt sweetness up front, complemented nicely with light roasted coffee and a slow-burning roasted bitterness into a residually sweet finish. Creamy, full, nitrogenous mouthfeel. One of Summit's better offerings that they should definitely bottle."
"On tap at William's Uptown. Poured a nice dark black color, sizable creamy tan head. Smell was a very mellow oatmeal coffee scent. The oatmeal really smoothed over the edges of this stout, lending to a very high drinakability. Nothing offensive or harsh in the flavor, still this is a good representative of the oatmeal stout style."
"The appearance is black, with a nice full head and good lacing. The smell is mild and sweet. The taste is complex, with hints of oatmeal, burnt chocolate, plum and just a very slight bitterness to balance the sweetness. This beer goes down very smoothly. A great addition to the Summit lineup."
"As it warms I get a little hit of mineral like water smell...perhaps a small hit of sewage fro mthe mineralness.."
"Summit needs to make this beer a regular. I had it on tap at Old Chicago, in St. Cloud, and it was terrific. I love nitro-poured beers for their creaminess and this beer was creamy and full bodied. I have had a few benchmark oatmeal stouts and this beer blows them out of the water. Sam Smith who?"
"I liked this a lot. A great addition to the Summit line-up."
"At first I was like, ehh, its OK, but as it went along, I liked it more and more. It grows on ya as you start to find the little things inside that make it interestingly good. The overall smooth and soft character of this stout makes it quaffable for sure. Surprisingly, I'm happy with this one by Summit."
"Dark appearance but chestnut light penetrates the bottom of the glass. Clear. Nice head, creamy and tan and keeping a staunch 1/2 inch for a long time. Not much downward-cascading action for a nitro pour. Thick clingy lace. Light cocoa aroma, a little apricot, not particularly roasty. Mouthfeel is medium, low mouth carbonation, tendency toward silky. Lactic milky senses to the flavor, and a sense of mildy burnt toast at the end. There's a little bit of astringency that picks up midway through the glass. All-in-all, a mostly pleasant beer and a nice one to see Summit brewing."
"Please, Summit?"
"Enjoyed at the Summit brewery on 5-22-04. Smooth creamy nitro stout with a whiff of oatmeal character. It was served WAY too cold, but even at frozen temps it was still pretty enjoyable and not at all harsh, which will help it's general sales. After warming, the oatmeal and chocolate aroma became more evident and body became even more silky smooth. Very drinkable and while nothing that is ground breaking, it is a very welcome addition to the Summit lineup. This will be available in the Twin Cities area mid to late summer on draft only, but I would love to see it as part of the normal lineup. Hopefully some will stick around for the fall/winter. If they do eventually bottle, would they do it on CO2 or a nitro widget bottle/can?"
