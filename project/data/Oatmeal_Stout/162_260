The stout like characteristics then shine through with roast, char, chocolate malt and Graham cracker. All the while I tastes tinges of molasses and dark fruit. Supposedly this was just $5 for a bomber, it was given to me. If that's the case this may be the best deal in craft beer.","KYGunner","Mar 07, 2015"

The alcohol is balanced nicely with the full flavor and sweet malts, with just a twinge if bitterness reminding you to keep drinking.

This beer goes down like a glass of milk. Outstanding flavor. Complex but not overbearing. Its flavor resembles that of a chocolate shake. This is possibly the best oatmeal stout I've ever had.

The nose brings milk chocolate, roasted coffee, nuts, oats, and a hint of vanilla. The taste doesn't bring as much of the smell to the table. You get hints of cocoa and coffee and roasted malts. Each sip goes down smooth with a silky mouthfeel. Sticky on the lips too. Overall, a good example of the style and can see why it is considered a classic in the area.","ChrisL24481","Apr 17, 2014"

The call-and-response between the creamy sugars and the bitter hops and roasts makes this interesting enough to stay satisfying throughout, and that doesn’t seem too typical in a low-alcohol beer. I thought that there would be some noticeably dull flavors in here due to the age of this bottle…turns out, that’s not at all true. Great beer.","BarryMFBurton","Mar 10, 2014"

Pleasant and warming, this would be an ideal beer for a night in front of the fireplace in the Winter. I am drinking this in July, but am married, so I have an active imagination. Regardless, if you are a fan of stouts, you should try out this beer. It is light, smooth and well-balanced. Not an Imperial Stout by any means, it is basic and well worth your hard-earned sheckles.","BeerDocT","Jul 27, 2013"

Upon moving your nose toward the glass an aroma of roasted coffee and chocolate surround it strongly and you don’t need to smell it twice to know what this beer consists of (though it’s really damn pleasant so you might want to!) The taste brings on a bitterness that’s reminiscent of dark chocolate and coffee beans but the addition of oats gives this beer a balanced sweetness and a consistent velvety texture which makes it very easy to drink. This is a great beer to have alone or maybe with some dessert after dinner.","RummyRedbeard","May 24, 2013"

The thick, heavy chocolate malts are like a brick; concrete and immovable, with coffee, molasses, and chocolate, yet halfway through, the hops kick in. This is unexpected.

As it warms, bitterness and a citric hop undercurrent become more and more assertive. Both bitter and chocolatey in the swallow, a satisfying finish to a great beer.

The taste holds notes of darkly-roasted malts, very bitter dark chocolate (the kind you'd bake with, rather than eat straight-up), vinyl, anise, rubbing alcohol, charcoal, and molasses. Yowza, this stuff is acridly bitter! The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a nearly chewy feel, and a pretty dry finish.

I detected most prominently, aromas of coffee, charcoal, oatmeal, and vanilla. The flavor resembles many of the characteristics with adding in some complexities such as cinnamon and brown sugar.

Solid, I'll be back for more. Definitely worth it.","Pittsburgh","Apr 08, 2010"

The flavor is phenomenal and the beer is highly drinkable. I could easily have a few of these without coming close to wanting something else.","Sam21","Feb 24, 2010"
4.42,6.3,4.5,5,4,4.5,4.5,"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on February 19, 2010. The pour is nearly black with about three-quarters frothy head that stays around for the entire time. The aroma is overwhelmed by chocolate and coffee with the oatmeal, a bit of bread or biscuits balancing it out. The mouthfeel is good and heavy. The taste is very nice although not quite as powerful as the aroma lead you to believe. It is full of coffee grinds, chocolate, and a pleasing background of hops. Overall this is a fine oatmeal stout.","puboflyons","Feb 19, 2010"
4.65,11.8,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. Pours out jet black with almost no highlights to it. Slight light highlights on the side, but it really pours out dark, thick and rich looking. It had a big dark tanned colored head to it that sticks around for several minutes, and produces some decent lacing to it. It's a hearty, rich looking beer. After smelling it, it could get away with being called a coffee stout. The more I smelled it I realized, it's a very generously hopped beer, especially for a stout. There are no doubt coffee and chocolate aromas to this beer, but the hops are probably the most dominant feature. The taste doesn't mess around, it has a flavor along the lines of an imperial stout. I guess this beer is having a bit of an identity crisis here. Again, very strong traces of coffee, chocolate. Burned malts, grains and oats compliment the coffee and chocolate tastes and has a nice hoppy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good, but certainly could be better. I think this is where all the flavors caught up with itself and all that was going on just kind of complicated the mouthfeel. It could have been a little smoother to help balance out the bitterness of the hops. The drinkability is still pretty top notch. All in all this is probably, the best oatmeal stout I've had. I remember this is one of the first oatmeal stouts I ever had when I first got into craft beer. I didn't remember it that well, but remembered liking it. I think my tastes have changed over the years, but it's good to know I appreciated good beer back then as well. It's a high quality brew, go out and get some!","AndyAvalanche","Feb 16, 2010"
3.38,-18.8,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"The taste is ash, skim milk, bitter dark chocolate, and hints of caramel. It may be a little too light bodied for an oatmeal stout, but really it goes down pretty easy and is somewhat tasty. Not a standout, but worth trying for sure.","alcstradamus","Dec 08, 2009"

4.32,3.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Moderate head, plethora of larger bottles likely contributes to it resolving down to a thin layer across the surface, leaves behind credible thick streaks of lacing. The liquid is blackish brown throughout, nary a trace of any lighter color. Pretty gosh darn powerful nose of dark chocolate, cappuchino, butterscotch and a gentle overall roasted feel, blends in plum and cherry fruit scents, fresh scones and oatmeal, while not present in terms of specific scents, the hops reveal themselves in the erect posture it has in your nostrils. Medium-bodied, dense with a big initial swirl of carbonation which slowly fades off as it progresses through the mouth. More grain-driven and herbal here, produces additional bitterness in the dark chocolate and coffee elements. English muffin, breakfast breads sort of things going on. Here a raw nuttiness develops. Not a creamy sort of stout, has a fizzy mineral water like consistency. Smoky finish, helps it lift into a cloud inside the mouth rather than soak more deeply into the tongue.","farrago","Nov 26, 2009"

Some nice roasted malt flavor, some dark fruit flavor, and even some smokiness flavor all mixed together.

4.15,-0.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"This is a beer that pays dividends for swishing, swirling and experimenting on the tongue. It opens up easily, revealing a fairly complex, rounded, & motley collection of brewing highlights - on the top of my mouth I feel a warming mix of bitter coffee, oats and dark, dry cocoa. The bitter cocoa highlights hang around and slide towards the throat as a warming bitter and earthy hoppiness takes hold in the finish. My sweet tooth is asking for a more rounded sweetness in the middle... Finishes a little thin - yet filmy - which takes away from the mix of oats and hops that have now fully emerged. It's dry, piney and hot now - no denying it brother. Still, malty sweetness is apparent enough for me to forgive, forget and enjoy completely. The filmy characteristics could use a hand from some better developed carbonation - bubbling is large, sometimes cumbersome in the throat, taking away slightly from an otherwise stellar drinking beer.","Philabeerphia","Aug 10, 2009"

Tastes of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and a little bit of bitterness/hops at the end. Definitely get some sweetness from the oats in this one. Taste of roasted coffee/malts coats the mouth during the whole drink. Mouthfeel is medium, creamy and good carbonation, seems right for the style, goes down nice and smooth. This is a drinkable stout, not too filling, great taste, good price for the quality, no reason not to pick this one up again.

The taste is a beautiful blend of coffee and mild chocolate, a very pleasant combination of bitterness and modest sweetness. Near full-bodied but quite drinkable for the style.

Roasted coffee is the most predominant flavoring with notes of bitter chocolate interweaved with the chocolate taste, with the finish tasting like a bowl of oatmeal.

A little bit chalky, but not in an overbearingly artificial or powdery way. Chocolate flavoring lingers nicely. A little bit of bitterness at the end with hop finish, plays in well to offset the sweetness. Carbonation is on the higher side, which is where I like it. Mouthfeel is where this offering suffers a bit, it goes a little weak right off the bat. Would like to see a little more heft, volume, body behind it. Very smooth, silky if not complex. Extremely drinkable. A great session stout, if not the be-all and end-all of awesome.

The head is nicely colored as well, with kind of a mocha chocolate hue. It get's a bit thin as you drink it, however, especially for an oatmeal stout.

This is the first oatmeal stout that I've had in a while that actually tasted like an oatmeal stout, and not just a regular stout. Very thick in the mouthfeel. This beer has some substance.

3.66,-12,4,3,4,4,3.5,"Oatmeal stout is a matter of taste, and it has been awhile. The beer pours an inky black with a deep dark head that is very promising and enticing. There could be a thicker, frothier head, and that would have sealed the deal for me. The head is very modest and doesn't retain nearly long enough. The lacing is okay. This is a thick, dark, full bodied ale with plenty of character. The smell as everyone else mentioned is roasted or charred oats, grains, burnt malts, dark roasted coffee or espresso, maybe a hint of chocolate, and a slightly off sweet malt aroma, perhaps a bit phenolic. Thankfully the off aromas seemed to dissipate as the beer settles. The taste is robust and this is a sipping beer for me. It doesn't have an oppressively high ABV, but this is a thick coffee, slightly sweet, oaty, biscuity, deep roated malty ale if there ever was one. I do like this better than an imperial stout because it displays less biting astringency and harsh flavors. This beer is not to everyone's tastes. I appreciate the style, but it isn't my favorite. As for Oatmeal stouts, I prefer Sam Smith's a bit more. There is a creamy, oily, inky mouthfeel and this carries on into the aftertaste. The beer is smooth, deep, and dark and it does make a statement.","albern","Mar 15, 2008"

Lovely darkness coats the mouth with notes of dark roasted coffee, uakers chocolate and a bitterness that reallly hangs on to the tongue. Mouthfeel is super thick like it begs for the next sip.

Very roasted malt up front with a tiny hop bite that balances it out well. Midway through the toasted oat flavor emerges followed by a nutty-coffee like aftertaste that is very enjoyable.

Mouthfeel was medium to heavy and surprisingly pronounced with the hops, making it more robust than some of the other oatmeal stouts I have tasted. Even with the 7% ABV, this is very easy to drink.

Equal parts roast, caramel, and milk chocolate, with just a hint of acidity. Bitterness was solid, but well balanced with the malt. Roast was a little less prominent in the flavour, which allowed the sweeter malts to contribute a bit more overall. Milk and dark chocolate were evident, as was caramel and a little toffee. Hints of vanilla and oats faded in and out. The oats really smoothed out the texture. Not quite oily, but full and even with creamy carbonation.

Taste follows suit, with pronounced roasted bitterness and light peatiness up front and throughout. More pronounced than a ""typical"" oatmeal stout perhaps. I don't mind this at all. I like it.

The mouthfeel is incredibly viscous and chewy, which is everything a stout should be.

Taste shimmers in a medium-big mouthfeel. Smooth it is not but busy with burnt malt coffee, subtle sweet. The pungency sweeps forward on the palate and lingers.

Nice warming sensation towards the back of the mouth. Body is rich and creamy, but lacking just a shade of the depth that would make it the perfect stout body.

Taste is again all about the dark grains, with the bitterness inherent in such a product. Could have been smoothed out a bit more here.

Brew poured to a jet dark color, Held it up to the light after my wife said that it looked like tar, no light coming through what so ever. Had a nice solid, clumpy dark tan head that had very good retention and left a nice amount of chunky lacing through out. The aroma is all about burnt malt and charcoal, chocolate, coffee and a little hop smell. The first think that I notice about this brew are the burnt malt flavors that seem to hit you up front and then I notice smooth flavors of chocolate and a oat taste. The hop taste builds and mixed with an espresso like flavor seems to be quite acidic (?) but goes well with this brew.

The head retention was excellent; a firm, foamy cap lasted for a long while, almost for the entire consumption. The subsequent lacing was sporadic and webby. One sniff and the beer said, Im an Oatmeal Stout dummy! Is there an aroma better on earth then a perfectly crafted Oatmeal Stout? I think not. Succulent sweetness from the oats blends effortlessly with chocolate notes. The chocolate is absolutely lovely! A bit of modestly roasted coffee beans and a kiss of milky sweetness that finds a home with a return of the chocolate. The potency is very sturdy. Inviting. The palate is astringent upfront with more burnt flavors than the nose let on. How sneaky! The hops seem more playful too, herbal and modestly bitter. The sweetness of the oats is a little too soft. The chocolate flavors are more bittersweet than anything. Regardless this is a tasty Oatmeal Stout, it is plenty hearty with subtle graceful qualities. The finish is long, more bitter then many Oatmeal Stouts (a nod to its heartiness); there is also a sweetness then dances with modest chocolate flavors. It is simply lovely. Medium-full in body with modestly low but natural carbonation. The mouthfeel is very pleasant and filling.

Taste is right on par with the nose, surprisingly roasty with more subltle oatmeal flavor than other oat stouts and definitive cofeeish undertones. Body is fairly full, and finish is fairly dry, leaving a slight toasted malt aftertaste...","mikeys01","Nov 02, 2003"

Slightly astringent and complex. Lingering sweet & burnt flavor in the aftertaste. Very nice oatmeal stout. A meal in itself.","crookedhalo","Oct 31, 2003"

4.15,-0.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"A man's beer. It's about as dark as Hell when the fires go out and as bitter as the most unpopular kid in school. This is the first Ipswich I've tried and I can't say I was expecting much. But I was surprised by a very burnt, almost smokey taste, and a thick, sweet finish--almost coffee-esque. Chalk up another New England-brewed winner. I guess I'm fortunate to live here.","86MonteSS","Oct 22, 2003"
4.5,8.2,4,4,4.5,5,5,"Dark dark black with a thin fading dark tan head. Smell is roasted, earthy and a hint of dark chocolate. Smell does not prepare me for the taste. Intense roasted dark coffee bean flavors. Incredibly smooth, and although the bitter chocolate and coffee flavors are intense the phenomenal smoothness mellows and leaves a roasted, toasted bread flavor on the palate. One heck of a beer.","chaduvel","Oct 01, 2003"

Hints of coffee linger. D'oh! Malt sweetness is there, as is hop bitters. Quite a balanced brew. Leave it to Ipswitch to surpass all expectations. This is a quality oatmeal stout that any fan of the style will enjoy.","scottum","Aug 21, 2003"

4.13,-0.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Dar, dark mahogany color with a dark brown foamy head. Smells of nice roasted malt, with a bit of hop bitterness coming through. Mouthfeel is round and full as the roasted malt rushes over the tongue. Also nuances of chocolate and coffee. Hints of hop bitterness linger in the back of the throat. Very smooth, pleasant, and balanced flavor that keeps its rich character until the last drop.","far333","May 25, 2003"

3.43,-17.5,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Poured a inky black with brownish edges and almost no head whatsoever. Pretty heavy, viscous consistency. Cocoa was the dominant aroma, with hints of coffee and a slight hop scent. The tastebuds were also treated to the chocolate malt flavors, which was balanced by the bittering of the hops. Mouthfeel was a little high in carbonation, which caused this stout to feel a little watery. the bitterness in the aftertaste was also a little overdone. Otherwise this is a very good example of the style, and I will buy it again (probably in the 1/2 gallon bottle instead of the 6 pack!)","nixhecks","Mar 25, 2003"
4.42,6.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This stout poured very dark brown (almost black) with brown foam that settled rather quickly and did not leave much lace. The smell was very nice and long lasting: sweet and malty, with oatmeal, coffee, and bitter chocolate. The taste was rich and full with flavors of roasted malt, chicory, coffee and bitter chocolate. The mouthfeel was smooth and full bodied with low-medium carbonation. There was a pleasant aftertaste of oatmeal, bitter chocolate and hops. This was a very enjoyable stout. Take time to savor it.","UncleJimbo","Mar 24, 2003"

Coffee, chocolate, and and fighting malt duel for supremecy in the nose of this drink and quite fulfill in taste. Unfortunately there is no born on date and I can tell right away... I got an older version of a beer that should be obtained fresh, fresh, fresh. Still a tasty stout, full of rich roasted malt flavor and a mediating hop. A little bitter on the rebound, would be great with a meal!","Delirium","Jan 20, 2003"
4.14,-0.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"This stout poured from a ½ gallon growler deep black with highlights of red-brown. The head was tan and dissipated quickly leaving little trace on the glass. The aroma was full of roasted and black malt with hints of alcohol. The taste is rich and malty at the start. The finish is dry and bitter with the roasted barley coming to the front. The aftertaste is long and pleasant with the roasted malt bitterness blending with flavors of coffee, oats, and hops. The oats give this stout a nonastringent mouthfeel that rolls off your tongue quite nicely without that charcoal sting. All in all a very nice oatmeal stout that good year round. The growler seems to be the more complex and flavorful recipe than that of the 12oz. bottle recipe.","purplehops","Dec 07, 2002"
4.78,14.9,5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"This is my favorite beer. Absolutely black with a nice head. Exceptionally smooth on the palate with very noticeable coffee and chocolate. I could drink this stuff all day.

4.38,5.3,4.5,4,5,3.5,4,"Pours absolutely black with a nice thick brown head that slowly fades away.  Smell is all chocolate and coffee, huge chocolate aromas dominate.  Taste starts off very dark chocolatey and slowly fades into a nice dark roasted coffee flavor that linger o the tongue for a good amount of time.  The brew is a little thin for an oatmeal and that is the only thing that is holding this brew back.  Extremely drinkable.  A great brew that is just a little short of being absolutely stellar.  Another good one from Ipswich.  Thanks to the Bierman for the brew.","Murph","Jul 11, 2002"
