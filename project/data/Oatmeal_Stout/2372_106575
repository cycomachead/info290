Taste is Damn spot on like a liquid cinnamon roll bit yet I'm not blown away.  Tastes a bit muted in some ways.  This is a really good beer but it lacks a bit.  Great concept for a beer and  with a few tweaks could be outstanding.","TATURBO","Jan 07, 2015"

Some stout's have a finish I describe as ""like licking an ash tray"".  This one is different   A hint of sweetness and minimal alcohol taste.  A very nice sipping beer, and with the higher ABV, sipping is the way to drink it.","Jimlikesbeer","Dec 09, 2014"

4.6,6.7,,,,,,"Picked this up from a great trade with Evan!  While the waxed bottle looks cool, it's a pain in the ass to open!  Pitch black pour with a two finger caramel-colored head with good retention and great lacing.  Fresh roasted coffee dominates the nose along with plenty of cinnamon and vanilla.  Basically smells like a Cinnabon.  The taste follows suit with the cinnamon taking command, along with hints of roasty coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, espresso, and subtle oats.  The mouthfeel is velvety smooth and really creamy with a warm, slightly dry finish.  Overall, the balance and drinkability really surprised me.  I was expecting a syrupy, gimmicky, sugar bomb, but instead got a complex, incredibly balanced, and delicious beer.  Highly recommended!","beerdrifter","Aug 15, 2014"

4.54,5.3,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.75,"this is just amazing. thanks to drlovemd87 for sharing this gem, thats as beautiful as it looks in the bottle, with bronze and white wax and a classy and comical label. dark brown in color and not overly heady, but sitting with a bright shine and just a little icing of off white head. the nose is the best of a coffee oatmeal stout, with rich earthy coffee, not super dark, and roasted barley bitterness, as well as the semisweet body of the oats. the cinnamon is a genius addition to this, that adds a little kick to the nose and ties the flavor together in a unique way. it gives some texture to the beer, thats almost coarse or granular, a nice contrast and challenge levied against the smoothness of this oaty creamy stout that would glide down awfully easy without the cinnamon. it forces me to slow down, to appreciate this and digest it in a new way that i dont always remember to do when i drink great beers. sometimes im guilty of rushing through a great beer just to get to the next one, which is not a good habit to develop, but this beer slowed me right down and made me focus on the present in a careful way, which i think i owe to the cinnamon. the flavors marry beautifully, this drinks like breakfast. full body with some texture is a nice mouthfeel. carbonation is middle of the road, but i wasnt wishing for more. what i was wishing for was another bottle. in a night that featured some world class beers, this one was the winner. i have not had nearly enough beer from terrapin, so its hard to say where this falls in their line up, but its one of the best beers ive ever had, one of the most complex yet unified, and one that i will never forget.","StonedTrippin","Feb 09, 2014"

Nose starts with a huge dash of cinnamon followed by coffee and chocolate. Cinnamon takes center stage and tones down the coffee a bit. Plenty of roast, dark chocolate, and a little bit of cream throughout. That taste is delicious. The cinnamon is smooth and melds well with the malty sweetness. It really does remind me a bit of eating a cinnamon roll beside a cup of coffee. The flavors are very smooth and well balanced. The cinnamon addition definitely does something special to this beer. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth with mild carbonation. Overall, this beer is quite delicious and worth seeking out. I could only imagine what a barrel would do to this beer....

Wish the cinnamon roll aspect was a bit larger here in the taste and the mouthfeel was a bit thicker/fuller.

4.12,-4.4,4.75,4,4.25,3.75,4,"Pitch black with a gorgeous milky tan head on the surface. The aroma is spicy...a blend of cinnamon and coffee-with-cream, as expected. More cinnamon and coffee in the flavor, though the coffee here tastes more like straight-up beans. Vanilla, a bit of chocolate, and some almost cherry-like notes. Nicely integrated cinnamon, which is something that can easily be overdone if not careful. Not quite full-boded and drying in the finish. Just enough sweetness to offset the spice. Not mind-blowingly amazing or anything, but not every beer needs to be. Well done.","wedge","Dec 22, 2013"

Taste is coffee and roasted malt up front, cinnamon, sugary cream back end that comes forward in time. Nose comes out more as it warms, sweetness. Very nice.","jbaker67","Dec 21, 2013"

I was given this as an early Christmas present 2 weeks ago and have been on a roller coaster ride of hyping it up and wanting to save it to drink at the ""perfect time"" which apparently came tonight. I just hope I can get my hands on another, ALSO DO NOT DRINK THIS within 3-4 hours of bedtime. I wouldn't consider myself caffeine sensitive but I was wired after this one.","ivanovichi","Dec 19, 2013"

4.73,9.7,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,"On tap at World of Beers in Jacksonville. Half finger dark tan head with very good retention on a jet black body. Aroma is simple but very full on the nose with coffee, cinnamon, dark chocolate and brown sugar. Flavor follows with a very complex design with nice transitions between a starting chocolatey and roasted malt note moving to cinnamon coffee bean and nutmeg finishing with sweet cinnamon roll icing and nuts. Full body and light to moderate carbonation. Very complex and flavorful, a must try beer.","kylehay2004","Dec 18, 2013"

There may be some very subtle cinnamon spice additions on the nose... The ""cinnamon roll"" addition adds a nuanced and enjoyable presence to the flavor profile, but it's nothing more than a minor tweak... There is also a very subtle and sweet pastry dough presence... I often complain when one-off offerings dramatically change the base beer, but in this case, this one doesn't go quite far enough... The mouth feel is improved over the traditional... It is no more than medium bodied and surprisingly smooth... There is nothing especially sweet or deserty about this offering... The 9.4% ABV is especially well hidden... The end result is an enjoyable brew, but not one worth tracking down unless you happen to be lucky enough to stumble upon it in your normal beer travels...","philbe311","Dec 18, 2013"

It really does taste like a morning drink, and if you're not careful, it drinks like one too. Cinnamon Roll'd is a little sharper with the added alcohol and the addition of cinnamon takes away a bit from the coffee notes. I think I have to call it o-2 for Terrapin on topping their original recipes with these reserve series beers. Both have been creative and interesting, but the hype seems to overwhelmed the product.","ILMbrew","Dec 12, 2013"
