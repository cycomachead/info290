"A decent rep of the style your basic oatmeal stout"

"This is my first experience with Schlafly beer - I will be buying more!"
""
""
""
""

"It's alright. Not bad. But the coffee stout gives a little better flavor than the blandness than the regular oatmeal."
""
"I liked this beer a lot.  Had everything I wanted in an oatmeal stout, very dark and hits of cocoa."

"It's a very dark and rich stout that has a smooth finish."

"Good beer that pours a decent 1/2 to 3/4 in. head and produces pretty good lacing. Beautiful deep chocolate color that is very hard to see through. Aroma is very light. Taste is good and this is one of the more criper oatmeal stouts I have had. There is a nice malty-raisin taste and a great crisp, carbonated finish. Not as creamy as other stouts, but unique in its own way and very very drinkable !!!!!!!!!"

"Solid attempt at the classic style."
"Solid, drinkable beer, that lacks the creamy sweetness of the very best oatmeal stouts. Big fan of the dry finish though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great classic oatmeal stout with a hint of coffee and chocolate."
"Mouthfeel is fairly light and crisp for am oatmeal stout."
"Overall - While this is not the best oatmeal stout I have ever had, it is certainly a quality product. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone. Condor recommended and approved!"
""
"O: not bad. I would buy this again."

"Enjoyed at the St. Louis airport, the beer was on par with most oatmeal stouts. Nice body in the glass with the usual full aroma. The beer held up well in the mouth and had some depth and body to it. Nothing special in the taste that makes it stand out against other stouts though."
"A good but not great oatmeal stout. Nice flavor but misses a tad on the feel and aroma."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very decent stout that I could drink more than one of. I saw this on the shelf and noticed it was ~8 months old (Bravo to Schlafly for prominently and easily labeling their beers right on the label). But I took a chance on it because I LOVED their coffee stout. This is decent - not the same caliber as the coffee stout but a solid offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.00) : All together, I liked this beer a lot and will be a return customer. Even with my distaste of the initial mouthfeel, I really did enjoy this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It's not exciting. Decent flavor. Nothing offensive."

"Bottle: Poured a black color ale with a rather large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of rich roasted malt notes with a side of black chocolates. Taste is also dominated by some roasted malt with a side of black chocolate. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Not the most complex beer but well enjoyable with good balance between the flavours and good drinkability."

"O: I must finally be going over the deep end, because this is FAR smokier than I remember. That's not a bad thing - I like Schlenkerla's rauchbiers and I like some good BBQ pulled pork (oddly enough, the only instance I enjoy pork products), but this beer is striking my palate too strangely to be a great oatmeal stout. As a result, it's hard for me to return to this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a solid oatmeal stout that is perhaps too sweet for my liking."
"The taste is very smooth and a clean heavy mouthfeel. This is my first Schlafly Beer and am ready to try some more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It is a pretty good oatmeal stout."
""
""
""
""
"A pretty decent oatmeal stout and probably worth purchasing again."
"The oatmeal is evident in the aroma, flavor and soft feel. Hints of dried fruits and faint coffee add to the flavor which is, as expected, dominated by roasted grains. No burnt grain. Low hops and carbonation. Full bodied."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-a pretty tasty stout"
""
""
""
""
"O - 3.0 - Yea, it's pretty bad. I hate to say it but this is pretty standard for Missouri beer. Good beer law state, just not good beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown with a creamy tan head. Aromas of cocoa. Taste begins with a bit of bittersweet chocolate, then some dense bread, then some smoked wood, and a bit of earthiness in the finish. Pretty good mouthfeel. Overall quite a good Oatmeal stout, I would get this again."
""
""
""
""
"I wish I had another."
""
""
"O: This is a decent oatmeal stout that doesn't really play up any oatmeal characteristics. It's a little creamier and more substantial, thankfully, but I don't get it anywhere else. Still, a fine and pleasant stout for any occasion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" The flavor is roasted and nutty with an almost coffee-like roastiness with slight yeasty and vegetal aspect which is okay with some toasted notes from the malt in the background and light spice from the hops I am assuming. The flavor has a bitterness of roasted grain with slight vegetal creaminess with more burnt malt flavor lasting into the finish. The flavor is good with some light cocoa on the tongue near the last taste adding a nice depth to the combination of malt and yeast flavors. Overall this is pretty decent, actually it is a very drinkable stout with nice layering and even though it is a little more carbonated than most it is not too sweet and the roast level is pretty spot on without becoming too much by the end of the glass."
""
""
"Black in color and not much light will penetrate it. Minimal Brussels lace at the top of the glass. I smell oatmeal and a bit of roasted malt. Mouthfeel is slick and viscous with a bit of dryness. Tastes strongly of roasted malt and oatmeal, leaving a pleasant lingering bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice roast character with cocolate bitterness. Moderate stingy carbonation takes away from some of the smoothness I was hoping for. All in all good, but not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark, dark brown and with chestnut highlights at the edges when held to the light. Touch of ruby in there too. Nose is weak overall. Bitter coffee, burnt sugar, light char, glimpse of dark fruit, roasted malt, faint chocolate and oats. Maybe some salted peanut. taste is slightly metallic up front. Body is thin and watery. My first thought is; ""this is more like a porter than a stout."" Has no depth or creaminess. Travels the palate way too quickly. Follows the nose with weak flavor of coffee, chocolate and the fruit has disappeared. Malt is weak and although this has balance it is lacking in intensity and depth. There’s a hop bitter mid palate that settles in back and without it there would be hardly any aftertaste except for the raw oat taste and a salted peanut flavor. I think this has potential but it just isn’t finished yet. It needs some tweaking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This needs a more solid backbone with more char, more chocolate and more character. It is tasty though."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a major disappointment this oatmeal stout is acidic, not very sweet, and quite unbalanced. Would not get this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel and roast stand out on the beer. One of the best oatmeal stouts I have had."
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and can be considered sessionable."

"Overall a nice, pretty basic oatmeal stout that is easy to drink"

"Overall, one of the better oatmeal stouts I have had. Lots of roast and chocolate and a great mouthfeel. A wonderful dessert beer."

"O: a pretty good stout , nothing that will blow you away but a good above average stout. I would defiantly pick this one up again."
""
""
""
""
"O- A good oatmeal stout, but nothing stands out and probably not something I would persue again with better options out there."
""
""
""
""
"This is a good, easy drinking stout, but no a great one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Not my favorite stout but easy to drink. I wouldn't turn one down in the future."
""
"Overall: interesting beer which has some flavors that are unfamiliar to me especially for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very enjoyable stout that is typical of its style. I have a fondness for the Schlafly brand in general, but will want to redrink this beer the next time I make it to St. Louis."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I probably first had this stout 10 years ago. Brings back memories. Solid stout and tastes as good as ever."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-As it warms though it starts to go awry, roasted/burnt seems to overpower. It still is a good stout though."
"O- Pretty good beer. It's not outstanding, but a solid oatmeal stout"
"O - I wouldn't rank this as one of my favorite beers, but it is definitely note worthy and I would have no problem drinking more of these in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer has been better in the past, for sure. Not sure if it's a bad batch or the recipe has changed, but I wasn't digging this one as much as I had in the past."
"Beer is medium to medium-light bodied, with mid-level carbonation that feels soft on the palate, but still manages to foam this up slightly. The result is a satisfyingly creamy and smooth beer with just a hint of crispness. Would be a bit better if just slightly heavier in body, but still above average."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A decent stout overall, would have liked a little higher abv, as well as more fragrance and flavor"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent oatmeal stout. Nice balance between the malts and hops."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Schlafly is my favorite brewery, they do everything well and this is a good representation of the style."
""
"Picked up a sixer of schlafly oatmeal stout at my local stateline beer store for just under eight bucks. The brew date is a year old and it's not been kept refrigerated as the bottle instructs. It pours black, with lots of thick foamy head which leaves copious lacing. The aroma is of malt and vanilla, and flavor is a little harsh. It's not as smooth and balanced as I'd hoped. Still a good, solid stout, but not as refined as I expected."
"Overall a decent brew, but not the best stout I've had"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a decent oatmeal stout from a brewery that has developed a reputation for producing solid, no-frills beers. I wouldn't buy this one on a regular basis, but I'm definitely glad I tried it and would buy it again. Recommended."
"12oz bottle from Pick’s poured into a shaker. Pours black with a half finger of tan head. Aroma of light coffee and chocolate. Taste is light bitter. Mostly coffee with a little chocolate and some caramel. Medium bodied with a surprisingly thin texture. Lively carbonation and a decently long finish. Overall, not too bad. There are better stouts out there but this one is darn good for the price."
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all, an OK beer."
""
"A nice, routine oatmeal stout that's saved from forgettability by the sharpenss of the bittering. Pretty good beer."
""
""
"o: average at best."
""
"Overall Impression- Great oatmeal stout! I've had many times in bottle but never on tap! I'll be enjoying the Coffee Stout by Schlafly very soon as well. Go for this if you enjoy a nice, roasty stout with good oaty and grainy attributes. Don't order if your looking for a medium bodied brew or anything less than medium-full. Could be substituted for a meal!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall I'm a bit disappointed. I've had, and loved, Schlafly's coffee stout, but the oatmeal stout isn't cutting it for me. There just isn't much to it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent oatmeal stout, but it's very heavy on the roasted malts, and charred in a way that I don't like. Not my favorite."
""
""
""
"Rich and thick, oh so easy to drink and tasty on cask. Anything from here is always recommended, especially if it's on cask."
"Poured into a standard pint glass. Pours a dark brown coming out of the bottle. After it settles it looks like black coffee in the glass. A foamy dark cream colored head sits on top. The head dissipates to a thin layer with random bubbles, but by the end there's hardly anything. Sticky lacing. It's hard to get a bead on the aroma, bitter chocolate is present. It tastes of bitter chocolate, burnt malts, and maybe a hint of oats. It's not all that complex. The mouthfeel is lacking. It's just too watery. Overall, I didn't know what to expect. I'm not overly impressed with Schlafly's offerings, except their Pumpkin Ale. This is definitely an oatmeal stout I will never revisit."
"dark and rich and chocolaty and robust and delicious. this pours a beautiful dark thick brown with a full 2 inch head into a frosted mug. heavy roasted aroma that smells a little sweet, almost decadent. mouthfeel is a bit thin, but the flavor profile doesnt miss the body, tastes great. this is the best schlafly beer i have had, a little bit of espresso in the finish, bittersweet. nice"
"O: A pretty good example of the style. Sessionable for sure. Sweet, but not cloying. Just enough balance noticeable. A very respectable oatmeal stout."
"D- Taste and flavor are a bit lacking. It's enjoyable, but I think Schlafly's Coffee Stout is their better stout."
"Overall: I would have liked this to be a little bit smoother. Not bad, but I don't think I'll search out another."
"M - Medium body with a creamy texture. Easy to drink with a nice balanced, but boring aftertaste."
"Comparable with their porter although I like that one a bit more. Still, a solid everyday beer."
"dark brown nature. Nearly opaque with a nice head of dark tan that rose up to around an inch before settling back down. Nice lacing along the sides fades quickly. Aroma is of deep roasted malts, brown sugar, caramel and a light chocolate note that seems to build with time. Nice touches of vanilla balancing in here now as well. Clean flavor, nothing rough about it at all as the brown sugar and vanilla really take over the profile and provide a very smooth, and very even feel to it. Warm roasted malts and hints of chocolate."
"O - Again, this is a solid oatmeal stout, but nothing amazing for the style (which I thoroughly enjoy). Another nice offering from Schlafly. Glad I picked up some of their beers on my last out of state beer trip."
"This is a very good beer. I wish I could get it every day. Cheers!"
"Overall, a respectable offering, but its not going to blow you away, especially since we are now in the season of Founders Breakfast Stout. Still good though, Cheers!"
"Not my favorite from this brewer but a nice stout. Nothing great."
"Nice glass of good, basic stout."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Poured this oatmeal stout from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The stout pours a hazy blackish brown color and produces a nice tan head. Retention is great and it leaves ample amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma of the beer contains sweet oats and malt, some suggestions of vanilla. This ale is medium in body, the front end of the ale contains roasted malt, sweet, and a very slight piney hop note. Overall this is an average oatmeal stout- Their coffee version of this ale is much better."
"O: I expect an oatmeal stout to have a full body with a very evident silky creaminess to it and an evident base sweetness. This meets my expectations only partway. It tasted sweeter and creamier on tap so I give the tap version a full grade higher than the bottle."
"O- I like this beer a good deal, and am happy it has found its way into the Nashville market."
"O- it's around average for me. The flavors are good, but it's a stout made with oatmeal. Hard to beat that. The head and mouthfeel are huge with this and it missed by a mile"
"Overall: Great mouthfeel and restrained roast. I would like to see a bit more complexity. A really nice example of the style."
"O: THis stout leaves much to be desired. I am not sure if my palate is used to something ore over the top/kick in the face, or not, but I would not purchase again."
"I really have liked what Schlafly has done with their stouts outside of their barrel aged one. I have to say I need to buy more of their brews if they’re going to keep doing such great work."
"overall it is a decent brew - i get more brown ale then oaty stout but i still enjoyed it - reasonable price 7.99 a sixer"
"Overall, this is a pretty good oatmeal stout. Nice balance, good flavor, good feel. I recommend it."
"OVERALL - Not as ""big"" of a beer as some of its darker brethren, but a great beer overall. It is more complex than beers of a similar price and if you are after a sweet and toasty brew, you can't go wrong with a Schafly's Oatmeal Stout. I recommend it."
"Superb and very enjoyable, and the taste and complexity improved as my ale glass warmed to room temperature."
"D: Leaves an unfortunate chalky taste the more you sip. Really makes this just a medium-bodied stout."
"Poured from the bottle into a small snifter. It pours opaque w/ some red tint. Has a slightly tan head w/ poor lacing & the head goes away quickly. The smell is of sweet malt, however this is a little low for me. There's a slight acidic bite & restrained hop to the nose. The taste is coffeeish, roasted malt, some espresso notes, & not as smooth as expected taking into account the flakes used to make this style. It's quite reserved but a decent stout. A slight lingering finish & has a good hop taste to it. Medium body & pretty drinkable. I wish it were more assertive, that would do wonders for this beer. I could have several of these in a setting. Prosit!"
"Overall	- doesn't really seem all that true to style being a bit too light in body and having more bitterness than expected. Don't get the expected silkiness in mouthfeel. Bit of a disappointment."
"D - Drinkable, but I'm unlikely to get more of this."
"D- good drinkability for me. I would buy this again as with most offerings from schafelys"
"D - I goes down easy enough. I wouldn't put it up there with Sam Smith's but it's decent."
"Well carbonated with with a light to medium somewhat airy mouth-feel."
"D- This is overall a mediocre oatmeal stout. I think some more oatmeal would really help this beer out significantly."
"Trying to pick out something worthwhile on this one hidden in the back with the char is slightly sweet banana note, doesn't redeem this mess."
"This one pours looking just like a coke, with lesser carbonation, and a cream colored head. This bottle is over a year old so the smell is pretty dull. It's got some light roasted maltiness to it with a little sweetness and slight alcohol. It tastes pretty standard. It's not very rich but has the light coffee appeal of a stout and has some breadiness to it as well. It drinks medium bodied and pretty smoothly. It's a decent stout but nothing too special."
"Pours a very dark brown color with a light tan head. The head is thin and not too long-lasting. The nose is roasted malt along with a bit of chocolate and coffee. Roasted malt pervades the taste as well with mild coffee notes. Good, creamy body with really nice carbonation. A bit plain, but pretty drinkable."
"D- This beer is highly drinkable. The downplay in the flavor helps to this and reminds me of the next step above Guinness. The alcohol is low enough to make this beer sessionable to the average drinker and beyond."
"Drinkability. High for a stout,where it's lighter/wetter mouth + body hut it in some ways that does make it an easy job to have a few Pounding 3 watching a ball game on a hot St Louis night? Probably could replace a Lager or Pale in that role. Could be an "" Entry Level"" for friends not used to a big,robust brew. Reasonable price, flawed yet may have a niche."
"Seemed to fall a bit short on the creamy, study notes that oatmeal lends to a stout. Pleasant deep roasted malt flavor with no particular notes. A touch on the thin side for the style. Finish was a hint of astringency. Overall a pleasant but unengaging beer."
"Drinkability: Meh. Not especially appealing or pleasing to my tastes, but one could certainly drink it without much to worry about, just not something that I will seek out in the future. However, let it be known that Schlafly has still been a very reliable brewery for me and I will still have no problems picking up their other beers as I go."
"Poured from a bottle, brewed on 7/15/10 into a pint glass. I have had this beer many times, but this is my first time to review. Pours black, with just a touch of light peeking through. Not much lacing. Aroma and flavors are sweet, with oats, cocoa, and a touch of vanilla. Mouthfeel is thin with a low level of carbonation. ABV and mouthfeel combine to make this a drinkable stout, I never have a problem finishing 2 or 3 of these in a sitting. All said one of my favorites from Schlafly. Cheers!"
"The taste is full of roasted malts that give a very dry brownie a cocoa nuance. The front is dry, while the finish is smooth and syrupy."
"That said, it's pretty quaffable for the style."
"D- probably wont be seeking this one out again. pretty bland for the style."
"D- I find this good for a couple, after a long day. Nothing spectacular but worth trying."
"Tasting a fair amount of oatmeal as this warms up; definitely quite quaffable. I'd get this again as a sessionable stout."
"I liked the beer but am not a fan of stouts."
"Probably a pounder of a stout that's a better value than Guinness."
"Keeper"
"D: Not much of a fan of this beer, the mouthfeel just kills it for me. If this beer was beefed up a bit with less carbonation it would be much better."
"Smells of roasted malts, some faint coffee and chocolate, no real hop smell. Taste is similar to the aroma. Light roasted malt flavor, some bitter coffee or bittersweet chocolate come through. More coffee flavor comes out at the end (once it has warmed a bit). Good mouthfeel, but not as thick and rich as I was expecting. Closer to a dry stout in body and finish. Moderate level of carbonation keep it smooth, dry finish. Overall this is OK, but I have had better."
"D.Nice brew not as thick and creamy as Guiness. A strong coffee, chocolate character with a nice bitter finish."
"Given its faults, this is still a pretty good beer - good enough to enjoy more than once. Pretty satisfying."
"Conclusion: Love me some Schlafly, and some of their beers are DAMN good. This one, though, is just a bit uninspired and average-ish. Not bad, just not special. It was a bit better/richer on tap at the Bottleworks."
"D- I could definitely have a few of these in a sitting. One of the best oatmeal stouts I've tried, too bad its not available local."
"Drinkability: Well this was a really nice treat. Not sure why this one is scoring so low - for the style, it's pretty good, hitting most of the highlights without making any huge missteps. The relatively low abv% enhances the drinkability a little further, too. I can see myself enjoying one of these on a Friday after work or with a nice earthy cheese or a grilled veggie kabob or two. Nothing to write home about, but it was good."
"Drinks great. The body is a bit thin and low powered here for my taste, but it is smooth."
"Overall, this is a very good example of the style. It has been my go too for english style stouts. The nose and flavor are wonderful."
"Roasted coffee aroma with no hop character. Dark brown, black, color, but very crisp. Caramel malt is evidenced, with some bitterness from dark malts. Hop bitterness becomes more evident on the finish. Medium bodied with a pleasant hop bitterness to cleanse the palate. Not a ""big stout"". Very balanced grain bill as the dark malts do not dominate the palate. This isn't your normal stout."
"Poured a dark brown, with about a finger's worth of head. Smells wonderful, just like opening a package of oatmeal. Has a creamy mouthfeel and tasted of roasted malt with a bitter finish. Had a bit of an unpleasant aftertaste which is what leaves it from being voted higher."
"Poures black, with tan 2 finger head. Aroma smells a tad sweet with a pretty decent oat smell also. Taste is nice and full bodied, nice roasted barley flavor, with a good dosing of oatmeal that comes through nicely, and finishes just a bit sweet and with a touch of hops to even things out. Wonderful med mouthfeel that is smooth and creamy. Overall a really god oatmeal stout that is better than most."
"Overall this is a decent oatmeal stout, but Schlafly has plenty of better offerings. Still, worth a shot."
"Dark brown, not quite black. thin head fades quickly. Has a fruity, slightly oaty smell. Tastes roasty, sweet malt, slightly fruity finish. slightly spicy. Light bodied, medium carbonation. Tasty, well balanced, good mouthfeel. nothing fancy, but i like it."
"I have had this beer before and I forgot how much I liked it. It is a very rich and creamy beer, which makes for smooth drinking. A nice example of what a stout should be. Nice flavors with a slight sweetness to it."
"Pours a very nice dark brown/black color with some good initial tan head and some very nice lasting lacing. Good scent, malty and sweet with a great sweet oatmeal tinge to it, along with the classic stout burnt grains; just wish it would've been a little deeper. Excellent taste, well balanced, great malt/burnt grain stout flavor with a great oatmeal sweetness and enough hops to round it off without making it a hop bomb stout (can't stand those). Goes down very smooth, a very well brewed oatmeal stout."
"I picked up a mixed six pack at a liquour store while visiting my brother in law. I had regretted not stopping at Schlafly while in St. Louis last summer and after trying this I regretted it even more. Black in color with wispy lacing on the surface after being poured into a pint glass. Mild oatmeal and coffee nose. Rich sweet flavor. Smoky coffee attack. Creamy finish. Mild smoke aftertaste. Very pleasant flavor and highly drinkable."
"a pretty good example of an oatmeal stout. It pours an initially large head which dissipates. Pretty smooth taste, easy to drink a couple of these. The smell is decent, I would have liked to find more of the caramel in terms of smell and taste though. Still, pretty easy to recommend this."
"Poured into a pint glass it pours a dark brown almost black color with a bit of red around the edges. Produces a nice sized head leaving good lacing down the glass. The aroma is sweet, a hint of chocolate, caramel, and of the roasted barley. The taste is a little sweet and the roasted taste comes out. The mouthfeel is very creamy and not as thick as I was expecting but at least it's smooth. Overall it's not bad. I think I was expecting a bit more but at least it's pretty drinkable. Not the best oatmeal stout available but it does a decent job."
"Although alot of seasonal stuff is out for spring time and I regret not getting some of that."
"One of the hoppier oatmeal stouts I have had, accentuated by some toasty malt notes and rather high carbonation. Roasty chocolate flavors get lost a bit and the body is pretty thin, but overall this was an easy drinking oaty stout that I would be happy to drink again."
"Pours a dark brown color. 1/3 inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of roasted malt, grass, smoke, some earthy malt, and some very slight hops. Fits the style of an Oatmeal Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick. Average carbonation level and strong bitterness. Tastes of roasted malt up front, smoke comes through second, hops are noticeable in the background, an earthy malt flavor is present next, and the finish is a smooth roasted malt flavor. Overall, I rather enjoy the smoke flavors and the complexity of the palate. This is another fine beer from Schlafly and worth the try."
"via mphopkins99"
"Beer served a deep dark brown, slight mahogany hue to it. Not much head to speak of, but that may have been from the bartenders pour - what was there was a tan slightly more than film that lingered. Not much lacing to speak of. Nose is of rich caramel malts along with some roasted malts and bit of nut. Taste is very roasted at first sip - roasted malts definitely appear first. There are some hints of coffee and leaves a very sweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel is creamy but not too heavy. This is a decent beer that I would pick up again."
"Due to the meager alcohol and mouthfeel with muted flavors you could probably drink a case of this stuff but I won't because it's not that good. This beer is highly drinkable but so is Coors Original and I'm not out buying that today."
"this embodies all the qualities of your average stout, except for that strange aftertaste. i don't love stouts. this is no exception. hard for me to drink this."
"With the wide varitey of this style im not sure that this would be the 1st i went for but overall a very sessionable beer and one for someone starting out in this area without a doubt"
"On Jan. 23 Bottle - pour into shaker glass. Pours clear, deep brown/amber (okay I am color blind!). Moderate head with good lacing throughout. Medium body - malty, chocolates, slightly bitter. Very enjoyable offering from the fine people at Saint Louis Brewery - Cheers!"
"D_Pretty minimal aftertaste. Alcohol is a little present and warming. The taste is fantastic, but the heavy body is a bit prohibitive"
"Overall, a terrible beer. Hopefully this was a bad bottle instead of their intention. Avoid. One and done. I'd try again just to see if it was a bad bottle if I found in someone else's fridge. For me, I'd never buy again."
"i gave this one above average drinkability mainly because of the mouthfeel and ""sweeter"" taste."
"D: Not too bad I'll try this one again and update my numbers if needed."
"Pours a red black brown color body, looks like a flat cola with a tannish head. Oatmeal, coffee aroma. Some alcohol in the nose too. Effervescent. Coffee taste, some liquor taste like whiskey. Watery taste, almost like a porter, but it does have that taste of a stout, almost. Some bitter chocolate taste. Maybe some oatmeal in the taste too."
"Drinkability: Comes up a bit short both in terms of flavor and body. So-so at bast."
"Easily drinkable on a cold and snowy night like tonight."
"D-one of the better tasting beers from this brewery"
"From a brown 12oz bottle - Pours a clear dark root beer brown color with a slight head and average carbonation. Smells of roasted malts, nuts with a little alcohol coming through. First sip is sweet then quickly bitter. Some nutty flavor notes present. Very light bodied. Decent mouthfeel but a tad under carbonated. Not too bad."
"d - Stouts are my favorite - definately have several more to drink."
"D - This is a very drinkable stouts. This has been my 'go to' stout when I can't make up my mind!"
"drinkability is good. this is a solid oatmeal stout, which is easy-drinking, but lacks the richness of flavor that makes the style so appealing. could be much better."
"D: Very smooth for a stout, I could drink several of these."
"Sampled at the tap room, just as it should be, damnit. Poured off the tap a DARK brown like Coca Cola (not quite black because sunlight still passes through it). Tan head about a finger thick displays good retention and some broken lacing. Aromas are a little light for such a heavy looking brew, roasted malts and baker's chocolate with a slight hint of vinegar. The flavors were equally taut, bitter coffee, caramel with a milk chocolate finish when the malts balance out. Malts are a little chalky though. Medium body is a little light for the style but the carbonation is light which gives it a creamy feel. It feels off balance to me and lacks gumption and heft. Where's the winter deflecting chutzpah? Get on St. Louis and keep me posted."
"D-The pleasant flavours rescues this one from being sub standard. Body profile could use a bit of beefing up. Decent overall but not one I would reach for over and over again."
"D: I enjoyed it. A nice drinking oatmeal stout."
"Not bad for a oatmeal stout and I say it about average in its drinkability"
"D-A possible everyday drinker, smooth and flavorful with a good price. Very enjoyable, look foward to the second showing."
"Pours dark, dark brown, not quite pitch black, with ruby hints around the edges. The head is small but dense and dissipates to a swirl on the top leaving sporadic lacing. The smell has some sweet malts and a bit of cocoa with a big oatmeal presence on top. The taste has a little more complexity than the smell with a larger presence of dark fruit and roasted malts. The oatmeal is still present in the taste just not as dominant as the nose. The mouthfeel is on the thin side as stouts go with good carbonation. The oatmeal leaves the finish a little dry and bitter, but not too bad. This is a decent oatmeal stout though it's not the most complex or tasty example I've had. Still recommended."
"A nice, solid example of its style."
"D: Not a bad beer by any stretch but nothing really stands out here to make me want another, I am going to drink it and enjoy it because it tastes good but I am ultimately going to forget out it in the long run."
"I expected something completely different from this one. If this wasn't labeled ""oatmeal stout"" it would be a solid brew, but it doesn't fit the style at all. Name aside, it's very drinkable, and would make a good session brew."
"Drinkability is good for a stout, not heavy at all but yet flavorful. This could be an everyday stout if i lived in the midwest, but i wouldnt choose it over, say, black butte porter if it were offered out west."
"You can't go wrong with a good oatmeal stout as far as I'm concerned and this one isn't bad at all."
"D: An easy drinking oatmeal stout, this is"
"good carbonation. full body. smooth. great beer. i could drink more than a few. good oatmeal stout."
"D - This is an okay Oatmeal Stout. Certainly worth a try."
"Pours basically black with a fluffy tan head. Light to moderate smell of dark roasty malt, a hint of coffee and almost a light skunk smell in the background. Taste is semi dry char, roast malt, and it has an appropriate level of carbonation. A touch thin in the body however, a lingering ashy, charred smokiness, rather than the oaty creaminess I expected. Not bad and an interesting Oatmeal Stout."
"Notes: My first oatmeal stout, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I still liked it. It's kind of funny to me that this style of stout is sweeter than any sweet stout I've ever tired. A sweet, mild stout, that tastes pretty good and is easy to drink. I'd reccomend it."
"Overall, this is a pretty good stout. It is easy to have a couple of these in a night. I've had it on tap a couple of times and in bottle...not the best stout by any means, but definitely not the worst."
"D- Definitely very drinkable. It did fill me up pretty quickly; after a couple I was feeling pretty full. Like I said before, I was expecting a little more taste out of it, but I think it was worth buying."
"Fuller side of medium bodied, with light carbonation. The aftertaste is of those burnt malts. Not bad, but I don't know if I would purchase it if I saw it."
"""Hey Schlafly...can we get a little distrabution in north-east Iowa please""!?!"
"Very mild roast to the aroma, too subdued for my taste. Mild bitterness on the end, with a subtle roast malt middle. Light feeling, not too thin or watery. Oatmeal isn't a major contributor in the body. It's light enough to session, bu tI moved on to something else."
"Poured from a 12oz. brown bottle into a pint glass. This beer pours beautifully, a rich dark brown when pouring turns into a deep brown/black color in the glass. I was a little disappointed by the thin head, but what're you going to do... Smells like sweet roasted grains and coffee. A decent taste that starts sweet and ends slightly bitter. The mouthfeel was impressive, nice and bubbly for a stout. A decent oatmeal stout, but not my favorite."
"It's not difficult to drink a couple of these back-to-back, but I wouldn't be interested. Not enough about this grabs me. I'm far from compelled to grab another. Decent, but a bit of a letdown, mediocre compared to many other stouts--Samuel Smith's for starters. Then again, aren't most?"
"Sample at the Lambert St. Louis airport location. The beer is a nearly opaque dark brown color with a thick and foamy light beige head that burns off slowly. Patches of lacing on the glass. Aroma of roasted malt and milk chocolate, with a hint of mocha. Medium-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. Sweet caramel malt, chocolate and grain flavors with traces of hops and coffee. The finish remains smooth (bordering on watery actually) and sweet with a lingering sweetness. Above average overall."
"Pours a dark molasses brown with a big two finger fluffy khaki colored head. Stickiness leaves its marks all over the sides of the glass, somewhat spotty, but good. Smell is well...bad. Metallic odor with a bit of cinnamon. Not the combination I'm looking for in an Oatmeal Stout. Maybe there's some hops in the nose too?...with a hint of nuttiness. Taste is a bit of smokiness with some sweet toasted oat flavors. Some interesting pine flavors seem to make an appearance midway through which are a bit disturbing. Aftertaste has a hint of woody vanilla with a bit of earthy flavors. Mouthfeel is pretty light with a good amount of carbonation. Just not really digging this one, could use a lot more sweetness whether it be oat, chocolate, or caramel flavors. Not one to seek out."
"Tried on tap at the bottleworks after a tour. This was a very dark brown almost black color, with a nice tan colored head. The smell is great, chocolate, oatmeal, roasted malts, all of the good stuff to be expected in a good oatmeal stout. The taste is great, very creamy and malty. An excellent oatmeal stout. I could drink these all days. A great buy for the buck."
"d: not particularly sweet, malty, hoppy or strong tasting this muted stout is smooth and very easy to drink."
"Finishes with a slight bitterness. Very drinakable oatmeal."
"Drinks pretty good, a good starter oatmeal stout"
"Overall, this was a very easy drinking, if unspectacular beer. It was a good quality, smooth and well balanced brew. I would have no problem recommending this to anyone who favors stouts."
"Taste is bitter from all of the roasted malt along with a touch of cocoa. The malt is also has a bit of a toasted character giving the beer a bit of a nutty characteristic noticed in the aroma. Hops are noticeable towards the finish. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth and medium to full. The finish is a bit dry. The first stout I have ever had besides Guinness and I have a soft spot for it, but not the best I have ever had. Still a decent beer from Schlafly."
"Had this on tap at the Tap Room! Had a thick sandy brown head that stuck around for a few, then left with thick lacing that hung on the glass throughout the drink. Very dark brown in color with a hint of ruby red around the edges.Had a definate malty aroma with a underlying scent of coffee. The taste was sweet and malty with hints of toffee and a definate oaty finish. I liked this alot! Especially directly from the source at the Tap Room! Took home a growler of this to hold me over for a few days.... since I am only a 15 minutes from the brewery I will definately be getting more of this soon!"
"Roasted bitterness up front, followed by toasted marshmallows and baking chocolate. Mild chocolate and fruit cake sweetness mid-palate. Dark chocolate bitter finish with a tartish, milk sugar edge. Moderate body that seems a little dry for the style. Not bad."
"12 oz bottle. The beer is deep brown in color with ruby tinges around the edges. A 2.5 finger tan head sits nicely over top of this one, falling to a towering compact island of foam over the beer. Clarity appears to be very good and there is a moderate carbonation apparent. The aroms brings roasty and nutty maltyness, a nice roundness, almost creamy from the oatmeal, with a kiss of coffee hiding in the background. The flavor is roasted and oaty up front, moving to a mild bitter and slightly pineyness from the hop, finishing with a hint of coffee and more bitter. As I swallow the beer, I get a bit of alcohol coming up into my sinus cavity, which detracts a little from the experience. Mouthfeel is moderate with a very minimal carbonation, with a hint of creamy texture to it. Overall, this is a fairly nice brew. It is one that would be easy to drink a few of."
"From now on, I'll be drinking my Schlafly's Oatmeal Stouts at a much warmer temperature."
"Drinkability -a most sessionable stout. Not overly filling but very tasty."
"Its ok, but with better oatmeal stouts available, I wouldn't buy it again."
"Thanks to unclejedi for sending this one my way. Poured from a 12oz. brown bottle into my shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a dark translucent brown color with about two fingers of bubbly, dark tan foam. Smells of roasted grains, coffee and a touch of sweetness. Tastes of lightly roasted coffee, and a hint of bittersweet cocoa. Medium in both body and carbonation. A pretty tasty example and one I'm glad I was able to try."
"Not available locally, and I never make a special trip for it, but I could session this oatmeal stout. If at the Taproom, I probably would session this stout. Haven't experienced it on cask, but can't wait to do so."
"A respectable local stout when in the area."
"12oz brown bottle with a bottled on date. Good amount of tan head that drops a stick lace on the glass. Pitch black more or less, dark enough to not let the light through. Aroma of soft charcoal and silky oats. Full bodied with a smooth and creamy dextrin mouth feel. Slight roasted character that grows to a streamlined char flavor. Mild hop bitterness plays off of the oat sweetness. Good malt base with a faint yeast and fruity note. Finishes semi-sweet, this one is an obvious chocolate pairing. Not bad at all, above average compared to the rest."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, leaves some nice sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is of sweet malts, and caramel. The taste is nice sweet malts, and caramel. Light-Medium body. Very drinkable, a nice little oatmeal stout."
"12 oz. bottle, bottled on Sep 19 2006. Very dark brown in color with only slight ruby edges. Thick tan head, which holds together well. Roasty aroma, a bit of chocolate, caramel, and fruit. Roasty flavor, but not very strong, or bitter. Hints of vinous fruits. Pretty smooth. Seems thin and a bit watery. Dry finish, with just a touch of bittersweet chocolate. A few scattered patches of lace are left on the glass near the end. Flavors seem very weak and mild in this one, which could make it a session ber, but not very exciting. Rather disappointing to me."
"pours an insanely dark black, barely any light can be seen through it, the head is thick and frothy and remains for the life of the beer, smells like rich coffee, maltiness is very apparent, only hops i can detect smell spicy. tastes is complex, chocolate, toffee, malt are mixed together, the longer i let it sit in my mouth, the more chocolate i taste. very good beer for a winter night, but not something i'd want to drink at a bbq."
"Pours a five finger head that fades slowly to thin layer leaving some lace. Deep mahogany color. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Roasted coffee nose. Starts sweet roasted coffee/chocolate flavor some bitterness at finish. Little thin for a oatmeal stout. 12 oz bottle part of mixed 6-pak for $7.99 from Friar Tuck's Peoria, Il."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with an inch tan head. There's also a good amount of lacing on the glass after drinking the beer. It smells like roasted malt, oatmeal and coffee. It tastes pretty much the same to me, except that it starts out with malty/oatmeal sweetness, and then has a bitter coffee-like finish. The mouthfeel is on the medium side, but creamy. The drinkability is good too, this is a smooth beer that's easy to drink. Overall I think this is a decent beer. It's not the best stout I've had, but it's certainly drinkable and I would buy it again."
"Well brewed beer, but a little timid--caught somewhere between a porter and a stout. The roasted malts add character and depth, but still allow the base malt sweetness to pronounce. The color is dark, but not opaque, and has a light head retention, carbonation, and lacing. The dark grains and light hopping rates give a complex bittering, but lightness with the oats never rounds the beer out properly. Though light and drinkable in the body, the smoothness and slickness doesn't show. Thins a bit toward the finish, but a nice drinkable beer nevertheless. Thanks again Beer Dave."
"D - Considering the lightness of this stout, I would say you could easily down a sixer of these no problem besides the taste flaws that may stunt that. Decent beer at best, overall."
"I'm sure there are much better stouts out there."
"Pours a mostly-opaque black color with a cocoa head that is impressive. Delicate lacing in the pint glass. Nose is of sweet chocolate, mocha, and oat bread. Palate is on the sweet side up front, then finished a bit drier. Good round mouthfeel and perfect carbonation. Hop backbone balances this beer nicely. Everything a good, standard ooatmeal stout ought to be. One of my favorites from Schlafly."
"Oddly enough my girlfriend, who (like alot of non-BA's) has ""dark beer fear," really liked this one. That kind of suprised me. Overall, I don't think I would come back to this one as there are much better oatmeal's out there."
"I had this fresh from the Schlafly brewery aka The Tap Room. It poured w/ a foamy head and was a deep black liquid. I took a deep breath and it smelled light, very little smell. It is highly carbonated though, reminded me of a pepsi for a moment. The taste is mild, i've had much better oatmeal stouts. I would drink it again, but it didn't win me over like I had hoped. It had the aftertaste of coffee grinds, overall I was a bit disappointed. As you can see from my rating above..."
"Overall a pretty nice easy drinking stout."
"Overall: I though I might have picked up a bad bottle, but from reading some of the other reviews of this beer I'm not so sure that I did. In drinking this I'm wondering where the smoothness is. Where's the sweet and full flavor? This bears a lot more resemblance to a lager than an oatmeal stout. It's not that the beer is necessarily bad, but for the style it really misses the mark by a mile and that's what my scoring reflects."
"D: Overall, this is a pretty standard stout. You drink one and it's ""Yup, that's a stout."" I doubt I'll buy another 6er, but I might try it again if I eat at one of the Schlafly brewpubs the next time I'm in St Louis"
"Velvet silk mouthfeel, this goes down pretty easy. Great session contender, but nothing shockingly awesome. Seems to have a great deal of conversion potential as well."
"Drinkability: This is an average beer, not fantastic. I enjoy it, but feel that it is not a great representation of the style. If you are looking for oatmeal smoothness, it is not here. I could drink a few of these, but if I was looking for an oatmeal stout, I'd have to keep looking."
"Bitterness from roasted barley somewhat smoothed by flaked oats but not as rich as expected. I am wondering if this truely is the base for their Kaldi Coffee Stout. Had to believe that the cold coffee toddy adds so much more complexity."
"Schlafly Oatmeal Stout isn't a total loss, although it's a mere shadow of the beer that it could be if more malt had been utilized. The skeleton is there, it just needs to be fleshed out."
"D-This is a very tasty oatmeal stout. It has good complexity and nice depth of malt characters. The mouthfeel is a bit watery but the beer is a nice stout."
" Much better on tap at their brewpub."
"Best Schlafly brew and oatlmeal Stout I may have ever drank. This one actually tastes like oatmeal, not just ""hints"" of scent and taste. Great serving temperature to get the full effect. Nice chocoloate color that dances on the palate. Easy enough to drink for its style."
"Deep brown color with ruby highlights topped by a thick clumpy tan head. The head receded quickly, but left a nice lace on the side of the glass. The aroma has a lot of roast malt with just a hint of coffee and black cherry on the finish. The flavor has cherry up front followed by a mild espresso flavor backed by a bit of chocolate. No real citrus in the flavor, bit there is a light bitterness on the finish. The mouth feel is smooth and rich, altogether a highly drinkable beer. This has always been one of Schlaflys signature beers, and even from a day old growler, its an enjoyable beer."
"D: Good beer overall, good example of an oatmeal stout."
"A pleasant diversion while waiting for a flight, but that's about it."
"I had a few of these brews on-tap during a recent trip to Missouri. On its own, as an pre-dinner drink, the beer was excellent. It also made a nice accompaniment to a mushroom-smothered pork chop. Its a dark, black beer with an exceptionally creamy light-brown head. An aroma of deeply roasted barley and oats is appealing. The beer also has a pronounced and lingering coffee and smoke smell. All together, its very nice. The taste is a mix of dark chocolate, roasted grains, oats, and a distinct malt sweetness. The hops are very toned down in this beer, which has a loud grain and oat quality. Fully body with a mouth-filling feel. Its an extremely satisfying beer. Its a moderately complex beer, but theres not so much going on that it doesnt go well with food. Im very pleased to have found this one."
"This beer is dark brown, a bit light for a stout. There is a decent tan head. The smell of chocolate is inviting but the taste just doesn't live up to it. It is not really bitter, it's more of a sourness or sharpness. Maybe I just don't like the particular hops used. Or maybe they were just too skimpy on the fermentables. The mouthfeel is thin and sharp, and it is highly carbonated. Drinkability is average. Overall it is average, it just doesn't meet my expectations compared to other oatmeal stouts."
"Very smooth and very easy to drink. I want another already. The body is a little thin for this style, but it is still relatively filling."
"This may be a bit better on-tap at the Tap Room and I've never had cask beer but I could imagine it being great there as well (something I MUST try on my next trip to St Louis). A worthwhile oatmeal stout"
"Dark brown in hue, blacker in the middle, redder around the edges. Shiny. The head was beige in color; at the apex the foam was almost two-fingers in height before it quickly faded to a clumpy, soapy cap. The subsequent lacing was unorganized and moderate in its coverage. I like how this beer looks. The nose was unimpressive. It lacked any sort of assertive oat sweetness or roasted qualities. The loudest smell was metal, tin to be exact. Smells like a bottle too. Weak astringency tries to shine through. Im not impressed with the nose and I cant call it inviting. The palate is not impressive either. Like the nose the palate lacks any sort of assertive oat sweetness or roasted qualities. In fact this beer doesnt even taste like an Oatmeal Stout to me. Porter? Sure. Regardless of what it is, this beer really isnt that good. At best the palate is ordinary with very weak (and irrelevant) kisses of roast, char, day old coffee grinds (diluted), and some caramel sweetness. I have lost interest in this beer quickly. I should have never drunk the bottle version; I should have let the image of the cask-conditioned nectar stay at the forefront of my mind. The finish is clean, way too clean for a quality beer. I also dont like the rawness that sits at the back of my tongue, it is disjointed and it fails to add anything to the taste. Yawn. Ive had very few Oatmeal Stouts that tasted less like an Oatmeal Stout. Sad. Medium in body, firm carbonation but it fits the mouthfeel well. However there is something stiff and lifeless about it. I felt compelled to swallow just to get it out of my mouth. It is hard to savor anything that way; no loss really as this beer doesnt have any flavors worth savoring. Drinkable? Well, it is easy to drink because there is nothing there but that is hardly what Im looking for in a beer. I am hugely disappointed in this offering. I cant see returning to this beer in the future. This was purchased at the Tap Room in St. Louis as part of a mixed six-pack. I say skip it."
"Near pitch black in hue, 1/3 inch dark tan head with intense patching and sticky lacing. Roasted malts, oats and some dark chocolate can be detected on the nose. A massively smooth and slick palate. Dried oats, burnt coffee, hints of chocolate and blended roasted malts to be found in the body. Nearly too easy and smooth, for the style oh-so thirst quenching. Tender hop bitterness and sweet malts coupled with strings of black licorice; oily-slick and lip-smacking good, enough word describers? Well rounded and full of great flavorings. This stuff is world class on cask, liquid gold!"
"Yeah, so overall, this is awesome. Really. The cask conditioning transforms this from a pretty good stout to a spectacular one. Definitely on the must try list."
"This beer pours a dark reddish brown. The head is creamy tan. It fades fast leaving decent laces. It smells very malty. There are hints of caramel and chocolate. The malty aroma dominates though. It tastes malty and sweet. The roasted malts are quite apparent. There is a light caramel taste. This beer is carbonated perfectly. It leaves a sweet caramel like taste on the palate It is easy to drink. It is just a little thin. Most stouts are very thick, but this one seems just a little thin. This would be a good session beer because it is not too strong and the flavors are not too intense. I would definately drink this beer again if it was avaliable here in California."
"On tap at the TapRoom was just as good as from the bottle. Still, dark brown/black with an impressive brownish head that laced throughout. Carbonation is less, taste is still malty chocolate with a small underlying hop kick. Still a little thin for a stout. But still very drinkable for one, two or a session"
"Drinkability is solid. Little thin on the feel and flavors but pretty solid effort from AB's neighbors"
"Pours a dark black/brown with a minimalist head. Smells sweet and full of chocolate. Deception. Taste is weakly coffee based with a lot of the barley bite that I look for in a stout sadly absent. Scant traces of vanilla and espresso round it out but it's too late. Mouthfeel is way too watery for an oaty. Borderline soda like quality in the carbonation. It's drinkable but not by me."
"Chilled sample in a pint glass. The beer pours a dark brown color with a soft fluffy beige head foamin up easily and residing on the surface for a long time. Aroma is sweet toffee, and rich roasted malt, some slight nuttiness perhaps? No real hop presence I can detect. First sip reveals a creamy, silky textured brew with very mild carbonation. Flavor is very roasty up front and rolls to a big malt sweetness of chocolate and caramel, some nuttiness here as well. The finish is slightly coffee bitter but is still appealing. Very smooth and tasty brew. Another winner from Schlafly!!"
"Flavor is ra big roast impression dancing hard on the palate for a time before a smooth slick body supports a caramel malt that leads to a hoppy finish that plays with the remaining roast."
"I had this beer courtesy of a beer trade with MJR. 12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Beer pours with a redish brown color and a moderate head. The aroma is heavy with grains, acid, and alcohol. The flavor is complex with hints of coffee, black tea, citrus, pumperninckel bread, malt, sweet hops and a grassy note."
"The beer pours a winsome onyx color; the head is a cap of frothy chocolate and the residual lace a sticky sheet. The aroma of burnt sugar, light coffee, sweet malted grain and quite pleasing this nose, start is rich and sweet, the top full and pleasurable to the palate. Mildly carbonated, the hops pesky in their bite, sweet and dry aftertaste, a quaffable brew tis true."
"Bottled on 9/3/03. Purchased at the brewery."
"Drinkability: Quite good for the style. This brew is much better from the tap than it is from the bottle, and I could sip pint after pint of this all night."
"I was taken aback initially by this beer's aroma, a bit offputting as it gave a sense of spoilage. This faded with the miniscule, mid tan head and let the taste predominate. The pour revealed a deep reddish black color that will barely pass light, ruby red at the edge. The taste is of smoked or burned sugars. The finish leaves bitters in the back. Solid body with decent mouthfeel, perhaps a bit thin for the style. Very thin ring lacing. A final touch of licorice in the finish is sensed. Not a bad offering, but better are available."
"ave"
"Pours a ruby- black in color can almost see through the glass when held up to a light, creamy tan head, chocalate and burnt coffee aroma. Dark roasted malty chocolate burnt coffee flavor, nice bitter hop finish, hoppy for the style this is not a sweet stout it is dry and bitter, but it is great oatmeal stout, better on draught than the bottled."
"Only complaint is that the body is very thin or light. A thicker mouthfeel would make this an excellent beer. It might be more drinkable as it is, but the thinner body is disappointing. This is for the bottled version."
"Jet black with an inch and a half of head on it. Smelled of malt and chocolate. Smooth and creamy the first hit and a malty finish to it slightly bitter but nothing dramatic. This is how I likes me stout! I can't wait to try it in the Tap Room as suggested. Definetly will drink (this and other beers...) again next time I'm in St. Louis. Oh yeah."
"I sampled the Oatmeal Stout cask-conditioned at the brewpub. The flavor was much better than either the bottled version or the regular draft. The taste was smooth and a bit sweet, but with heavy chocolate and coffee flavors. Very nice mouthfeel without the added carbonation. The cask version even seemed to have slightly more malty aroma than the other versions."
"pours out black as night. thin head and nice lacing. light aromas of burnt roasted malt and a bit of hops. dark roasted malts are evident, even burnt or woody in profile. malts add bitterness, but an above average hop presence adds some more flavors, and a bit of additional bittrness in the finish. pretty smooth, as an oatmeal stout should be. a slightly thin mouthfeel is masked by the above average hopping. can't find too much fault here. a good stout!"
"Nice deep dark color with a tan lace.  The aroma is of roasted coffee.  The sweet dark malt sweetness with a hint of sour and a dark malt sweetness.  The full body supports a slight bitterness in the finish.  Very drinkable and relatively tasty."
"Sampled at Schlafly's Tap Room at the St. Louis Airport. Served in a frosty mug - which really sucked. No head. Hardly any aroma. Smoky, sooty taste with nothing in the way of oatmeal sweetness or smoothness. Lingering aftertaste that was decent but slightly reminiscent of Dr. Pepper (corn syrup). This was disappointing. It had that unpleasant tar and meat quality found under the surface in so many American micro stouts. The description said: ""this stout has sweetness from caramel malt, and bitterness from roasted barley..."" which doesn't make sense to me, unless they threw in some unmalted roast barley, but that seems unlikely. If in St. Louis, Morgan Street Brewpub has a better stout."
