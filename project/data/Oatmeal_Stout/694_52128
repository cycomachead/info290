Dark roasted and charred malt aromas, with earthy cereal grain and dark chocolate notes. Medium bodied and creamy smooth with light, soft carbonation through the middle. The body thinned toward the finish. Dark roasted malt flavor up front immediately followed by bitter, burnt malt and roasted coffee beans.

It's a great beer for any stout and/or coffee lovers, what really caught me off guard is finding a realization that this beer is in fact a oatmeal stout. This beer is great and taste up to its expectations. Great taste and balance of mostly semi-sweet chocolate and coffee with a nice vibe with it's bold 7.5% ABV. Mixture of sweet and bitterness with a spiky but smooth mouth-feel. I recently got a six pack from my local beverage store and it did not disappoint especially the fact of it's moderate cost. Definitely worth every penny, will be buying again soon!","TheArcan3","Apr 19, 2014"

I'm getting to like these a lot, because they are very tasty, and the caffeine tends to counteract the alcohol to the point your body seems to think it has just ingested a very low ABV brew, so work such as writing beer reviews can proceed pretty much uninterrupted by a serious beer high. Good when you want to drink beer with some substance but not get taken out by it.","scotorum","Mar 26, 2014"

Sweet aroma of dark fruits, a little booze, a little chocolate, and coffee that is somewhat subdued for the name. Flavor follows with earthy coffee though, then comes sweet chocolate covered fruits, some nice roasted grains in the finish. Still light on the coffee for a brew called Java Head, but very nice nonetheless. Lingering sweetness left on the palate with the roast. Mouthfeel is medium heavy and pretty rich for a non-impy stout. Nice beer overall and something I could see being a nice go-to for a rich beer on a week night.","BMMillsy","Feb 17, 2014"

There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

Bittersweet chocolate with the coffee behind that. Roasted malt, dark fruit. The hops are subtle but they bring a touch of earth and floral and make the nose bright. I smell a little lemon but no oats. The taste is burnt, chocolate, the coffee steps up and emboldens the flavor of the malt. Body is thinner than it looks. The palate is beautiful simplicity like the nose and as it warms everything gains in flavor but not in intensity. Extremely well done. The drink is creamy and rich. Finishes dry, a little oily with some bitter and smoke and more coffee. This was my first stout and Troegs has won me over completely. This was a stately, pleasing stout. Undeniably delicious and easy to drink.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

Mouthfeel is nice, fuller bodied and creamy. Overall, what a disapointment.

Very subtle coco and malty goodness on the back end but, again, nothing too complex. This beer isn't nearly as "sweet" as I'd expect from an oatmeal stout. Really, it's a mid-range stout from one of my favorite breweries. Java Head is slightly above average, but doesn't measure up to the rest of Troegs great brews. Having said all this, I am glad it is part of their winter variety pack as it's a good pick for the colder months.","ClarkHimself","Nov 19, 2012"

The finish leaves you with a certain earthiness. The coffee aspect is not as nice as FBS, but I still am pleased.

A nice 1.5 finger thick brown head with good retention and lacing throughout. The nose consists of a pleasant blend of espresso and coffee tones. A hint of malty sweetness on the back end. The flavor begins with a roasted coffee flavor along with hints of chocolate malt and vanilla smoothness. Mildly bitter. Finishes smooth. No hint of alcohol. Creamy.

3.77,-0.3,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured into a Troegs pint glass, an impenetrable black color with a solid finger of beige head, that displayed good retention and lacing. Smelled like a breakfast spread of toasted pumpernickel, spiced oatmeal and black coffee. Taste of dark roasted malts, bready, with lots of coffee--more on the bitter side and less mellow--and notes of dark fruits, citrus zest, grains, and even a touch of hoppiness which is typically unexpected for the style. Interesting. Medium mouthfeel, smooth, and quite drinkable.","Rifugium","Nov 05, 2011"

Hops, chocolate, and coffee are the main things I get (as expected). Very smooth and mellow smells from this beer. Taste is great- excellent taste for the style. The coffee/chocolate/hops and malt all seem to be in perfect balance. It's very smooth, silky, and makes me want to take another sip. None of the 7.5% ABV is evident to me. Medium mouthfeel, with a smooth, silky finish. A little dryness in there as well. Overall, this is another winner from Troegs. I would definitely have this again. Cheers.","jayhawk73","Oct 10, 2011"

3.6,-4.8,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"This almost comes off more as a porter than a stout. For 7.5% ABV it's drinkability is definitely high and there are no real glaring flaws. Maybe the Troegs brothers intended to brew a very smooth and lightly flavoured 7.5% coffee stout, in which case I would say this is well done. For my taste, however, I would prefer something advertising itself as 'Java Head' to present more coffee flavour and for a 7.5% stout to be more intensely flavoured overall. A decent brew but not one I would be interested in revisiting.","eat","Jun 28, 2011"

3.85,1.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured a thick, mahogany color with a one finger tan head. The aroma was that of roasted malt, some coffee, and actually a faint hint of chocolate. Faint coffee and a little chocolate in the taste with some roasty malt gives way to a nice oat kick in the end. Has a smooth mouthfeel and goes down easy. It is a nice representation of the style, but it's not Anderson Valley Barney Flats good. I know the summertime is an odd time for a stout, but I was in the mood for a switchup.","BeerFiend2002","Jun 14, 2011"

The taste had a some burnt malt flavors with a creamy oat taste in the back. The mouthfeel could have been a little thicker.

3.7,-2.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall, with Central Waters Coffee Stout around, it's a tough battle for the kingdom. A valiant effort none the less, but one that comes up just a bit short...like most Mavericks. Make your sports or political connections at will.","BarrytheBear","Jun 07, 2011"
3.93,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Ok, the temp is up to 53 and let's see what we have here. The nose is the same, no changes there.

Flavor beings with a good burst of citrus and piney hops. Very prominent for the style. Hops give way to more traditional oatmeal stout flavor. Sweet, creamy, milk and a hint of chocolate syrup.

Taste has a nice sweet malt backbone followed with some roasty bitterness that tastes like coffee grounds (in a good way; not gritty). Medium to full bodied with an oily texture. Finish is dry and slightly chalky. Taste didn’t quite live up to the aroma, and I’d prefer a little more sweetness as the roast started to overwhelm the beer.

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, cream, dark fruit, and slight coffee. The flavor was of sweet malt, slight raosted malt, cream, slight caramel, and very subtle coffee bean. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this brew wasn't that bad, but it was also not that awesome either. The flavor for me needed to be more robust in some aspects so you could pick up on what they were trying to make here. This one just missed the mark on this key point if I'm honest.

Mild hops apparant. Not sure why this is an Oatmeal Stout, perhaps it is a bit creamy in the mouthfeel. Medium to heavily bodied.

I catch an earthy, roasty, chocolate smell. Taste is dominated by coffee beans, oats, and chocolate. A very well-balanced oatmeal stout with the roasty malts taking over and the hops complimenting very nicely. Low to medium carbonation, the strongness of the coffee beans really is the main shield against the 7.5% ABV.

The taste too echoes the milk chocolate, probably more so because this was bottled in September of 2009. It has really good flavor, rich and creamy. It drinks pretty light for a stout and is a light to medium. It's very, very drinkable. I really liked this one. I was glad I picked it up while in Cleveland.","aasher","Nov 11, 2010"

The taste is very similar to the smell but more pronounced, some chocolate upfront with some nice coffee flavors coming through in the middle and back. Creamy in the mouth, with moderate carbonation and little (if any) indication of the 7.5 % ABV.

Smells of caramel, toffee, molasses, quite sweet, light roast, charcoal, chocolate, with some leafy hops. Solid bitterness throughout, growing into a lingering finish. Sweet and malty too, caramel and toffee, milk and bittersweet chocolate, roasty but not overly so. Hop flavour broke up the sweetness somewhat, adding some diversity in flavour and providing balance. Mild alcohol warmth in the finish. Quite thick and palate coating, lowish carbonation, creamy texture with just a hint of astringency. Pretty good overall.

Not much to be found so far on this one. The taste is pretty one dimensional as well, charred coffee and faint hints of sweet chocolate. The mouthfeel is really the best thing about this for me.

Lots of flavor of chocolate and espresso, plus the added roasted taste that you often find in an oatmeal stout. Mouthfeel was a bit on the thin side for a stout though.

The malt has a lot of chocolate, too, which works well with the coffee. The taste is a bit dominated by the coffee flavor, but it's still solid. Starts nice and sweet and finishes dry and bitter. I would guess that this isn't the most caffeine-packed variety of coffee stout, which I appreciate. Mouthfeel is thinner than expected, since the recipe is based on an oatmeal stout. This beer just needs a bit more creaminess to show off the flavor to its full potential. More of the fruitier coffee notes and chocolatey malt would come out with a fuller feel.

The taste follows in lock-step, adding molasses and a slight bitterness from the coffee to the proceedings. The body is a hefty medium, with pretty much no carbonation (shocker!) and a fairly viscous feel. I gotta say, it's better on cask than from the bottle. Tasty shit, people.

It lacks the velvety smoothness that many of the best oatmeal stouts display, but that seems like it would be hard to achieve both a strong coffee presence and still have the smooth characteristics from the oats. This one drinks better at higher temperatures, some hops and marshmallow sweetness blend in nicely. Bitter roast lingers too long after the sip, not unlike a long visit from the in-laws.

Heavy on the roasted malt flavor followed by the coffee flavors with a lingering after taste of chocolate and caramel. Kinda rich and heavy with low carbonation, could still feel a little thicker for what it is. I tend to think these coffee stouts are all about the same level of drinkable.

The taste starts out without a lot of influence from the coffee, just a nice, dry, malty stout flavor, but then shows up big time on the finish. Coffee, dark chocolate and strong bitterness on the finish, but it actually goes out pretty clean. Body is medium, drinkability is good.

It's nice and roasty and well balanced with a light sweetness and a resiny bitterness. There are notes of ultra roast coffee and licorice. This is great.

The bitter, puckering black coffee flavor is obvious, but otherwise a pretty standard oatmeal stout. Its good, not my favorite. I enjoy it, but it falls a bit short on the coffee taste- its there but its not as full as I was hoping. A good, bitter stout made with coffee overall.

Typical pitch black liquid, does offer a hint of orange coloration at the outermost edges. Very user friendly nose of cocoa powder, chocolate covered raisins, toffee, plum and cherry fruit, oatmeal and cinnamon, the roast to the coffee really not that high, brush of floral notes but the hops presence is negligible. Full-bodied, creamy but not necessarily soft, more as if the carbonation whipped like fresh cream. Stronger roast here, dries out the overall mouth texture. Coffee, vanilla powder, cocoa powder, butterscotch, mixed nuts, lower level of cherry, raisin, fig, apricot fruit. Pinch of baking spices but insufficient to sweeten things much.

The taste has a big roasted malt character initially with big coffee and chocolate flavors, along with some mild dark fruits (fig and plum), a mineral like flavor, sweet cream, oatmeal and a big, juicy hoppiness at the end that is reminiscent of grapefruit and pine. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light for the style but it's not unwelcome considering the time of year.

It sure is a looker. Not very aromatic but I detect hints of cocoa and citrus fruit. Also a little sugar and grain. The flavor features a lot of citrus hops and cocoa. Complimenting those flavors are some roasted malt, toffee, and lastly, some coffee. Bitterness is moderate coming from both the hops and burnt malt. I would of liked a little bit more in the body as it is an Oatmeal stout. It feels a little thin and lacks the silky texture of the greats of the style. I was expecting more coffee in this beer, but it has nice stout flavor. Maybe they should call this Troegs Chocolate Java Stout..","morimech","Feb 21, 2010"

The flavor is very good for a nice oatmeal stout, the 7.5% ABV is completely hidden IMO. The malts really come out here with some nice chocolate/cocoa flavors. Now as in the aroma the coffee and hop flavor, while there, do not stick out. I know that the Troegs webpage states that this is a September seasonal release so possibly the hops and coffee flavors have mellowed out. Has a nice dry finish with ample carbonation. Now, let me say that this brew is very good, but for me does not stand out with the lack of coffee and hop flavors, would not mind seeing it in the mixed 12 pack but as for a standalone beer just does not cut it IMO.","Stimack","Jan 17, 2010"

Mix your favorite beer and your favorite coffee in the best possible way, and this is it. Stays on the tongue hauntingly dry, but more so like the tannins in an espresso shot than hoppy resins (again, a good thing).

Digging deeper pulls a little dusty cocoa, but no coffee really. This was bottled on 9.10.09, drank 10.14.10, so nothing in the aroma should have mellowed out by now.

Thin and kinda winey, with a faintly roast finish, kinda reminds me of coffee but doesn't really scream it like the coffee-bean-pot-skull on the label would suggest. Pretty boozy, not in taste or feel, but definitely leaves my head a bit cloudy. It has an interesting acidity, perhaps from the coffee? Long after, the finish has some nice berry characteristics.

Thick 2 finger head of tanned head retains quite well and leaves a ring of lace on the glass at every sip. The nose is an amazing balance of bitter hops, coffee tones and sweet chocolate. Taste is right in line with what the aroma lets you believe that you are in for. Hop bitterness upfront, burnt barley and chocolate notes filling out the middle and welcomed again with a bitter finish that is a mix of the burnt barley and hops. Lingering taste of bitter chocolate and hops remain on the palette. The alcohol is well hidden in this beer, it is not playing much of a role in the nose or taste. The feel of this beer is a little lighter than I anticipated but that is due in part by a higher amount of carb. I have to give this one a perfect rating for the smell. I purchased this bottle at the brewery the day that it was released and I have been putting this review off for too long.

The flavor seems a little on the light side, but considering its not a 10%abv or something beer its god a good level. Mouth is light to moderate, light carbonation. More like a porter than a stout.

3.87,2.4,3.5,4,4,3,4,"Starts out a little thin and watery on the front of the tongue. Some sweet caramel makes its way in as the beer moves across the tongue. The body reveals itself in the middle as milk chocolate qualities develop - this is a very pleasing easy, creamy chocolate taste that gently coats the tongue. The beer reaches towards a slightly astringency towards the back of the arc - a whiff of bitter coffee and heat mixes with the still sweet malty backbone. The beer kicks into high gear and finishes with a good prick of piney hop bitterness on the back of the tongue. Well done here Trogners. The dryish finish is all earthen hop, coffee and strong cocoa...and it is in no hurry to leave. The finish is very nice, but the beer otherwise lacks a commanding presence, and suffers from the timid start, thin edges, and seemingly below average carbonation. A solid effort here - a beer that is easy to enjoy.","Philabeerphia","Oct 19, 2009"

Smell is of roasted coffee beans and malts with only faint hints of chocolate, vanilla, brown sugar. Taste is a medium to dark roasted coffee bean flavor with dark chocolate and malts, more akin to chocolate covered espresso beans than actuall brewed coffee. Hints of vanilla and brown sugar are present. Mouthfeel is typical cask, creamy and smooth, medium body lightened up by the hand pump. Very good, somewhat unique take on the coffee beer.","rfgetz","Oct 19, 2009"

Overall this was a decent beer with an enjoyable taste and good body, but it wasn't as bold or clean as I expected. It's in limbo between being a standard or imperial stout. Pretty solid as a standard stout, but very unimpressive as an imperial. Also, I didn't sense any oat, so I'm not sure why it would be considered an oatmeal stout (unless I totally missed it).

The taste follows the nose, with sweet roasted dark malt flavors dominating. Bitter coffee and cocoa flavors are helped along by the light hop presence to give it a lingering dry mouthfeel.

Bitterness was reserved and actually perfect for style, and it made me wonder if it was warmer than necessary fermentation that was at fault here. Moderate roast, chocolate, and a clean, fresh coffee flavor with no lingering bitterness. The finish is moderately roasty with a little chocolate, and coffee. The palate's on the lighter side, with the carbonation being higher than I'd like, but once it had some time in the glass, it was pretty good. The finish was pretty good too. While I had no problems polishing off half a bomber, I was hoping for more. I'm going to revisit this in a few months to see how it's come along. The bottle I had was no more than 5 days old, making it one of the freshest beers I've had.","DefenCorps","Sep 07, 2009"
4.15,9.8,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"A 22 ounce bomber bottle picked up fresh from the bottling line last week. Poured into my Admans Imperial pint tumbler. Java Head appears an opaque deep brown color with over an inch of dense, creamy dark ecru foam. Nose and flavor consist of freshly roasted coffee beans, molasses, pungent skunky hops, bittersweet chocolate, nice roastiness, some dark bread notes and citrus akin to those chocolate oranges that are around for the holidays. Not really getting that chewy oatmeal characteristic that oatmeal stouts tend to have, but nevertheless, the stout has just about a medium body and is amply carbonated. A well done addition to the Tröegs lineup.","ClockworkOrange","Sep 03, 2009"

4.35,15.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Well I think that they finally hit the nail on the head, as this definitely falls somewhere between the Scratch 15 & 19 efforts. Great balance of flavors as this warms, with the citrus character of the Kenyan coffee beans really being put on display here. The smoothness and ease of the oatmeal polishes this out nicely. This is definitely not your typical Coffee Stout, but its uniqueness is what sets it apart.","Kegatron","Aug 26, 2009"
4.3,13.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D-Solid! Becomes much more interesting and complex upon warming. Flavours pop well with the proper 55 F serving temperature. A very well balanced, enjoyable and easy to drink beer. Another winner from The Brothers!","Deuane","Aug 25, 2009"
