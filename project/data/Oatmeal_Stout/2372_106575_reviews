"O: worth seeking out."

"This was delicious, very thin mouthfeel but this was delicious. Smelled and tasted like fresh coffee and cinnamon rolls."
""
"Pours with a nice thick head.  Has a great nose,  real cinnamon roll smell.  Mouthfeel is creamy and substantial.  Taste is Damn spot on like a liquid cinnamon roll bit yet I'm not blown away.  Tastes a bit muted in some ways.  This is a really good beer but it lacks a bit.  Great concept for a beer and  with a few tweaks could be outstanding."

"Terrapin Brewery's Wake 'N' Bake Cofee Oatmeal Stout is one of the best coffee oatmeal stout's I had ever had. Some stout's have a finish I describe as ""like licking an ash tray"".  This one is different   A hint of sweetness and minimal alcohol taste.  A very nice sipping beer, and with the higher ABV, sipping is the way to drink it."

"Picked this up from a great trade with Evan!  While the waxed bottle looks cool, it's a pain in the ass to open!  Pitch black pour with a two finger caramel-colored head with good retention and great lacing.  Fresh roasted coffee dominates the nose along with plenty of cinnamon and vanilla.  Basically smells like a Cinnabon.  The taste follows suit with the cinnamon taking command, along with hints of roasty coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, espresso, and subtle oats.  The mouthfeel is velvety smooth and really creamy with a warm, slightly dry finish.  Overall, the balance and drinkability really surprised me.  I was expecting a syrupy, gimmicky, sugar bomb, but instead got a complex, incredibly balanced, and delicious beer.  Highly recommended!"

"Smooth, rich, slightly drying. Fairly full bodied, warming. I'd drink this any day, it's terrific."

"Caliente with the St. Patrick's Day Terrapin tap takeover. Boom."

"O - It's an improvement and nice change up from the base beer. I'd probably reach for regular WnB more, but would definitely keep these on hand."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is too sweet as the cinnamon dominates the beer. Being a big fan of WnB I was hoping for the cinnamon to add something to an already great beer not take it over"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall I think this is a very solid beer, but it was a bit of a let down flavor-wise as the nose indicated great things. The base beer is better, but this is still well worth trying."

"Imagine having a cup of black coffee while eating vanilla and chocolate ice cream AND a cinnamon bun all at the same time. Yes. I believe that accurately crystallizes my thoughts on this fantastic beer. Enough said."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall- Really a nice improvement on WnB which is already a fantastic beer. This is worth it if you've never had it."

"In the taste, spices, cinnamon, vanilla and a coffee like roasted malt. The oatmeal adds a breakfast like aspect and a smoothness. Dark chocolate, mocha, alcohol and sweet cinnamon in the finish. Chocolate malt and cinnamon. Medium bodied with a smooth finish. Overall a very delicious beer. Heavy cinnamon but still nice."

"this is just amazing. thanks to drlovemd87 for sharing this gem, thats as beautiful as it looks in the bottle, with bronze and white wax and a classy and comical label. dark brown in color and not overly heady, but sitting with a bright shine and just a little icing of off white head. the nose is the best of a coffee oatmeal stout, with rich earthy coffee, not super dark, and roasted barley bitterness, as well as the semisweet body of the oats. the cinnamon is a genius addition to this, that adds a little kick to the nose and ties the flavor together in a unique way. it gives some texture to the beer, thats almost coarse or granular, a nice contrast and challenge levied against the smoothness of this oaty creamy stout that would glide down awfully easy without the cinnamon. it forces me to slow down, to appreciate this and digest it in a new way that i dont always remember to do when i drink great beers. sometimes im guilty of rushing through a great beer just to get to the next one, which is not a good habit to develop, but this beer slowed me right down and made me focus on the present in a careful way, which i think i owe to the cinnamon. the flavors marry beautifully, this drinks like breakfast. full body with some texture is a nice mouthfeel. carbonation is middle of the road, but i wasnt wishing for more. what i was wishing for was another bottle. in a night that featured some world class beers, this one was the winner. i have not had nearly enough beer from terrapin, so its hard to say where this falls in their line up, but its one of the best beers ive ever had, one of the most complex yet unified, and one that i will never forget."

"Poured into snifter. Appearance is only pitch black with a dark brown head. Appears like a nice hearty stout. Nose starts with a huge dash of cinnamon followed by coffee and chocolate. Cinnamon takes center stage and tones down the coffee a bit. Plenty of roast, dark chocolate, and a little bit of cream throughout. That taste is delicious. The cinnamon is smooth and melds well with the malty sweetness. It really does remind me a bit of eating a cinnamon roll beside a cup of coffee. The flavors are very smooth and well balanced. The cinnamon addition definitely does something special to this beer. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth with mild carbonation. Overall, this beer is quite delicious and worth seeking out. I could only imagine what a barrel would do to this beer.... Yum!"

"Just when you thought you've tasted it all, a surprise comes your way and shows all the flavors that you've ever tasted but does so with unique proportions and scale for a culmination that's both a shock and a tease to the taste buds."
"Quite a fun enjoyable beer and a great cinnamon example if not the best use of one in a beer. It does lack though a classic creamy oaty body that I prefer to have, but still a well put together brew."
""
"A wonderful take on one of my personal favorites. Great interpretation. This is a worthy pursuit for fans of imperial coffee stouts."
""
""
""
"For me an easy 4.5/5.0 any day of the week."
""
"Overall: You could toss just about any damn thing in Wake-n-Bake and have it be good. Multi-wax the limited release of bombers and you'd really have a hit on your hands. Still, more than once, I found myself wishing I was simply working through a pint of the original."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a really neat idea, I actually wouldnt mind this being a tad sweeter, its a bit dry but still its good, glad I got one of these. I think I prefer original WnB though..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good stout but the cinnamon competed with my favorite part of WnB which is the coffee."
"o - i think it took me longer to open the bottle than to drink this delicious brew. well done take on WnB."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall very good, huge cinnamon roll note with tons of espresso, very nice. Totally worth the hype IMO."
""
""
""
""
"Really a nice beer. High marks for achieving the flavor profile."
"o - overall, i'm pretty floored by this beer. how can you possibly improve on WnB? THIS is how. this beer should become year round in 4 packs...no, 6 packs. and it should 150% be distro'ed to Long Island, NY. if that happens it will be in my fridge at ALL times. i am a fan. would love to drink more of this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm giving this one extra points for uniqueness and flawless execution. Cinnamon rolls in my beer, who would have thunk it? This is on top of an already spectacular base beer; WnB is pretty damn good by itself. This adds complexity and uniqueness without destroying the base beer. Execution could not be better in my mind. I'll save a ""5" rating in case they ever barrel age this ;) Well done, Terrapin."

"Poured my bomber in small tasting sizes to really get this as it warmed and developed. Starting out when cold I felt the smell really, really lacked a little coffee smelled a lot like a regular wnb. As it warmed it improved greatly in all aspects... the cinnamon came through on the nose, on the taste got sweet, cinnamon, raisin, and coffee all rolled into one. Smooth, creamy with that coffee bitterness bite on the tongue really, really like this beer though not a surprise since I love the base beer and cinnamon rolls :)"

"Pours pitch black with a large, fluffy, tan head. Nice falling bubble effect from the pour. Extremely long lasting head with very good cling. Smell is wonderful, cinnamon and spice, roast coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and slight caramel. Taste is roast coffee throughout with a slight alcoholic burn in the finish. Sweet and cinnamon flavored up front with a touch of vanilla. Mouthfeel is incredibly creamy, moderate low carbonation, and quite viscous. This beer is simply amazing, even better than standard WnB. If you see this in a store, buy it before it's gone forever, you will not regret it. Highly recommend this beer."
""
""

"Very good, not great though. Cinnamon was a nice addition but not a big difference from the regular WnB. Although I will say the cinnamon comes out more as it warms. Thanks for the share egrace84."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Lots of great flavors pop out. Very tasty and warming with out being overly sweet."
"Bottle share at Proof courtesy of jbruner. Poured a pitch black opaque with good tan head that went fairly quickly. Aroma is perfectly dark. Coffee, dark roasty malt, and a touch of cinnamon in there as well. Taste is the exact same as the aroma, wonderful. Nice viscous body and creamy mouthfeel. Superb beer."

"Overall, very good.  Good stout mage even better. Would definitely do again."

"Overall: This one lives up to the hype. One of the best stouts I've had."
""

""

"i think i was expecting something sweeter. i did not like the taste of this beer cold. as it warmed up the cinnamon seemed to brighten up and the richness of the coffee was more evident. im glad i was able to try this one but i would not go out of my way to try it again."

"O - Overall, this is a delicious beer. Really turns an already delicious beer and amps it up in to a delicious breakfast treat. Wish the cinnamon roll aspect was a bit larger here in the taste and the mouthfeel was a bit thicker/fuller. Really glad I got to try this, a delicious beer for Christmas morning!"
""
"Overall - Worth the hype? Sort of. If you plan on drinking this for breakfast (with cinnamon rolls?), then totally worth the hype. I feel it's too sweet and cinnamon-y for consumption by itself. It's very good nonetheless!"
""
""
"Overall: Sweeter than the base version, but the cinnamon is well-integrated into the end result"
""
""
""
""
"Pitch black with a gorgeous milky tan head on the surface. The aroma is spicy...a blend of cinnamon and coffee-with-cream, as expected. More cinnamon and coffee in the flavor, though the coffee here tastes more like straight-up beans. Vanilla, a bit of chocolate, and some almost cherry-like notes. Nicely integrated cinnamon, which is something that can easily be overdone if not careful. Not quite full-boded and drying in the finish. Just enough sweetness to offset the spice. Not mind-blowingly amazing or anything, but not every beer needs to be. Well done."
""
"Pours a thick black from the bottle with thin tan ring of lacy head. Aroma is still coffee forward with a hint of spicy cinnamon beyond it. Taste is coffee and roasted malt up front, cinnamon, sugary cream back end that comes forward in time. Nose comes out more as it warms, sweetness. Very nice."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- a very delicious beer that tastes like coffee cinnamon rolls with a little more coffee than cinnamon. I wish it had more of a cinnamon taste to it and a little bit thicker. It was a little thin."
"Overall - I expected more from the hype. It's just got too much cinnamon. Doesn't live up to Wake n Bake's standards."
"overall not what i was expecting. nowhere near as good as regular wnb!"
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is enjoyable and the cinnamon is very nicely incorporated. However, I think I prefer normal wake and bake over this. Fans of spiced beers will want to seek it out. For a winter time one-off it is enjoyable."
""
"O- One of my favorite brews to date. I was given this as an early Christmas present 2 weeks ago and have been on a roller coaster ride of hyping it up and wanting to save it to drink at the ""perfect time"" which apparently came tonight. I just hope I can get my hands on another, ALSO DO NOT DRINK THIS within 3-4 hours of bedtime. I wouldn't consider myself caffeine sensitive but I was wired after this one."
""
""
""
"O: Terrapin totally nailed this. Great beer!!! :)"
"On tap at World of Beers in Jacksonville. Half finger dark tan head with very good retention on a jet black body. Aroma is simple but very full on the nose with coffee, cinnamon, dark chocolate and brown sugar. Flavor follows with a very complex design with nice transitions between a starting chocolatey and roasted malt note moving to cinnamon coffee bean and nutmeg finishing with sweet cinnamon roll icing and nuts. Full body and light to moderate carbonation. Very complex and flavorful, a must try beer."
""
"An enjoyable enough offering, but a slightly disappointing given the hype... It looks like and smells like traditional WnB... There may be some very subtle cinnamon spice additions on the nose... The ""cinnamon roll"" addition adds a nuanced and enjoyable presence to the flavor profile, but it's nothing more than a minor tweak... There is also a very subtle and sweet pastry dough presence... I often complain when one-off offerings dramatically change the base beer, but in this case, this one doesn't go quite far enough... The mouth feel is improved over the traditional... It is no more than medium bodied and surprisingly smooth... There is nothing especially sweet or deserty about this offering... The 9.4% ABV is especially well hidden... The end result is an enjoyable brew, but not one worth tracking down unless you happen to be lucky enough to stumble upon it in your normal beer travels..."
""
""
""
""
"O: a really enjoyable beer overall. Not terribly complex, but what's there is so good that it works. It's like a glass of cold-brewed, cinnamon-infused coffee."
""
"Overall: Definitely worth the hype and hunting for this beer. I came out with numerous bottles and i'm going to be left wanting more."

"Overall: I don't know how I feel about this one. One of the things I love about W-n-B is the incredible coffee presence. It really does taste like a morning drink, and if you're not careful, it drinks like one too. Cinnamon Roll'd is a little sharper with the added alcohol and the addition of cinnamon takes away a bit from the coffee notes. I think I have to call it o-2 for Terrapin on topping their original recipes with these reserve series beers. Both have been creative and interesting, but the hype seems to overwhelmed the product."
"overall: They nailed this. Very unique, interesting beer."
