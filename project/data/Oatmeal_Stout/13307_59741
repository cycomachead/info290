4.06,6.3,3.75,4,4.25,3.75,4,"Smoke actually doesn’t have the biggest influence on the palate, but it is recognizable in an enjoyable interaction with the malts, adding an unusal flavor to this great beer. Arguing from the perspective of loving a typical Bamberg smoked beer, this smoked stout entirely lacks the characteristic hints of saltiness. It is even more astonishing that it doesn’t need those, because of the complex coffee flavor, which stays in balance due to the malty smokiness - enough complexity is established in a different way, than they do it in Bamberg. The coffee flavor of this beer might already be enough to make this great, as it is very smooth, almost creamy, intense flavoured, and changes its taste on the palate during the tasting process.","aleigator","Jan 12, 2015"

3.27,-14.4,4,3.25,3,3.5,3.5,"The beauty of these really dark beers is that when I employ an aggro pour, the pseudo-cascade is extremely visible. I sat back in awe and watched it settle into two fingers of very dense, deep-tan/light-brown head with good retention. Color was an Opaque Black (SRM = 44) and it looked like the depths of outer space in my glass. Nose was very coffee-like with just a modicum of underlying smokiness. Mouthfeel was medium. While the coffee was still prevalent on the tongue, the smoke was beginning to assert itself in the mouth and in my sinus cavity. Warming, the smoke got stronger, but so did the coffee. I was really hoping for something much smokier, but since it is listed as an ""Oatmeal Stout", rather than a ""Rauchbier", I should not dun it too highly for this. Finish was still more prevalently coffee than smoky and I have to admit that I was disappointed. It was just too similar in taste to Beer Geek Breakfast and too lacking in smokiness to be worth the cost for a 330-ml. bottle.","woodychandler","Aug 07, 2014"

This is more the style of Smoked beer than an oatmeal stout, though it doesn't fit easily into either category. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.

Aroma of sweet dark toasted malt, very light coffee with light chocolate and smokiness. Flavor of smoked, toasted dark malt, brewed coffee, light campfire smoke that has some peaty mineral character. Finishes with light grassy hops and boiled down coffee with a light residual smokiness. Medium bodied. An interesting coffee stout with a somewhat lighter malt and body than expected from an oatmeal stout. The malt complement does not quite support the smoke and coffee flavors, although they are not that intense. I enjoyed this, but was left wishing for a more intense malty stout body to play off the additional flavors. A well made coffee stout that doesn't really stand out from the pack.","LiquidAmber","Mar 04, 2014"

Aroma is lots of smokey wood, candied bacon, chocolate, lots of earthy coffee, glorious. Flavor is chocolate and coffee up front with a nice bitter-sweet balance. earthy coffee really comes out as my palate gets used to the smoke. A rich oatmeal sweetness, lots of roasty malts, then a big punch of smoke that lingers on the palate until forever. Just a flavor explosion of all kinds, but the smokiness complements the other flavors beautifully. Relatively rich mouthfeel with low medium carbonation, but plenty drinkable.

I will now dream of curling up with this beer and a hockey game. masculine and aggressive, but patient and contemplative as well. an overall exceptional stout from mikkeller, one that I look forward to getting into again soon.","StonedTrippin","Nov 10, 2013"

It's also more of a burnt smoke than bacon or meaty smoke, which is interesting considering the name/alias of the beer. That aside, it's still a good coffee stout with some desirable qualities. Also, it's one of very few Mikkeller brews that are decently affordable (not that $5.99 for a 330 mL bottle is really affordable, but it is for Mikkeller). Nice to try if you're into the regular BGB or just a fan of Mikkeller, but aside from that there are better smoked beers to be had","BEERMILER12","Nov 05, 2013"

Crazy stuff: coffee, rauchmalt and roasted grain all laced with soy. It's fair to say that it lives up to its name; there is more than a hint of bacon in the aroma and a whiff in the flavour as well.

Very black with a big brown head that sticks around. Lacing is good. The nose is a mixture of smoke, roasted malt, coffee. The smoke isn’t overpowering here or in the tasting; in fact it’s very well balanced for this style, with a subtle bacony flavor underneath the coffee. A little smoky peat but not anything that detracts from the other flavor notes. Oaky, malty, bittersweet chocolate, vague maple bacon hints underneath it all. Complex and delicious. Fairly thick, slightly coating in the mouth. Smooth and a little oily. Satisfying feel. This isn’t going to be everyone’s cup of tea and I wouldn’t want it everyday but it sure hits the spot when the mood strikes. One is going to be enough unless you’re a rauch freak.

As it warmed some nice touches of molasses and woody notes start to dominate with a really intrsting bourbon smell in the back. again the smoke comes into play but soo nicely done i was quite imoressed. To taste this was like falling into a giant pillow. Rich and full with a woody, oak soaked, chocolate geyser of taste just exploding from the glass.

4.7,23,4,4,5,5,5,"The pour into my snifter was what I expected a two finger mocha colored head and a body that was black as night. What I expect for a stout from Mikkeller. The smell was good, however I got more smoke than bacon but I can tell why Mikkeller named it the Beer Geek Bacon for the European release. There is a hint of saltiness in the smell of the smoke. Let me add there is a really strong smoke scent. I did not get any coffee at all, which was listed as an ingredient. The taste however is where this beer takes it above the good rating I gave for the prior two categories. In the flavor you get the coffee on the middle of the mouth aftertaste once the initial smokiness fades away. Again the only notion of bacon is in the aftertaste, once swallowed. There is this salty flavor that is hard to define. The mouthfeel was dry dry dry and I found this to be exceptional for this type of beer. Overall this was an amazing beer. The overall experience of the beer improved as the beer warmed and I loved the complexity. Those not into smoke should stay away it is pretty profound but for an extreme beer lover, this was great and at 7.5 it hit the spot.","Vancoubeer","Jun 09, 2011"

Nose hold ash, wood, smoke among other general campfire notes. Hints to some smoked meat too. Yum. Taste is a charred and ashy wood, with a lighter and more peripheral smoked meat (bacon perhaps?). Slight caramel quality to the malt as well, with a little bit of alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel has a slight grittiness to it, and has substantial lingering smoke and roasted notes to it.

4.33,13.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5," I really expected a different flavor for some reason - The stout starts smooth, almost has a caramel cream element with some sweet malt qualities, but mild toast and cocoa creeps forward in the taste until a large amount of smokiness develops, even more as it warms. The flavor is not offensive to me as others in the style seem to lack the body or sweetness to balance the slight burnt dry flavors. Rauch Geek or Beer Geek Bacon whichever moniker it goes by at the time is not shy about it's smoke, but it also uses it as a complimentary flavor rather than a full on smoke fest. I find the smoke pleasant and vibrant, yet it still adds a bitter edge. I like the complexity it adds while the flavor does not neglect mild coffee notes at all. think of this as your oatmeal, coffee and bacon all wrapped up together in a slighter strong (7.5%) stout.I enjoyed this immensely - Rauch Geek was a fine example of what Mikkeller's strengths can be in a quality American style stout.","Slatetank","May 19, 2011"

It has an element of smoked wood, like cedar. It smells more like a smoked baltic porter than an imperial stout. It has the light sweetness of a baltic and lacks the true coffee presence of a stronger stout. The aromas are highly appealing altogether. The taste however is disappointing, coming from the way the beer smells. It's kind of bland. The smoked wood flavor comes through in the aftertaste. I wish there was more of this while you were actually drinking it. The more drinks I take from the glass the more I can see the bacon aspect. It's very rich and has nice roasted accents.

There is smoked malts and cocoa powder with an addition of coffee to add some mild bittering. The hints of orange are also detected as if to complete the breakfast flavor. The taste is not as smokey as I would like, and it should be rated higher in taste were it not for the fact that I don't taste the bacon. The mouthfeel is exquisite. This is one of the smoothest stouts I've ever had, and as an imperial, that's saying something.

3.85,0.8,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Think smokey stout. This is no where near as good as weasel, no way. its only mildly smokey, mostly roasty, finishes a little dry, medium bodied, its pretty drinkable for a rauch beer but its not as good as i had hoped.","drabmuh","Sep 04, 2010"
3.77,-1.3,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This is a fairly drinkable stout that really does have bacon qualities. I would recommend pairing it with something sweet to offset the salty and greasy bacon.","theghost3","Sep 04, 2010"
3.55,-7.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"HUGE disappointment in the bottle, does not add to the weasel at all, a little smoke on the nose but just a boring average rauch here.","jrallen34","Sep 03, 2010"

4.62,20.9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"16.9 ounce bottle. Served in a DFH signature glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with an inch frothy tan head. Head retention is good, with a lot of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is excellent, there's plenty of smoke/peat/bacon noticable, along with some dark chocolate, coffee and roasted malt. Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, it's very smoky and roasty! There's also a good lingering smoky finish. Although I think the aroma is smokier than the taste, this is still a pretty tasty brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and coating with low carbonation. This brew is smooth and very easy to drink. It's easily the smokiest brew I've had lately, and a pretty good overall brew in general.","bluejacket74","Sep 01, 2010"

4.03,5.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Not as good as the standard Beer Geek Breakfast, but still an interesting brew. I'd like to see the coffee tempered to let more of the smoked malt flavors come through.","dasenebler","Aug 30, 2010"
3.07,-19.6,4,2,3.5,3.5,3,"Oily opaque black with a thick collar for a head. Burnt bacon aroma, like bacon left in the frying pan for an hour too long; this is tarry, salty and burnt stuff. Tastes better than it smells, tarry and burnt, meaty and smokey. Medium-bodied, thankfully not too syrupy or burnt. Semi-sweet finish with strong roast and smoke. The aroma is fairly offensive, but it doesn't taste bad. Decent.","largadeer","Aug 30, 2010"
3.98,4.2,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"D: As with the other Beer Geek Breakfast brews, this one is good, tasty, solid. But at $10 a bottle, I'm not going to come back to it; it needs to knock my socks off for that.","Halcyondays","Beers"
4.6,20.4,4.5,4.5,5,3.5,4.5,"I also made a burger to go with it, i caramelized some onions with some cane sugar, sherry, butter, olive oil, salt, pepper, and some bacon bits, mixed in some smoked mozzarella, then put a spoonful on an elk burger and covered that with a slice of smoked gouda. The flavor combo was out of this world.","crossovert","0"
4.49,17.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,4,"I bet this would pair amazingly with some eggs and bacon. I have a feeling I'd like a beer from the Beer Geek series no matter what, even if they put shit in it. Wait...","Chico1985","Aug 29, 2010"

4.79,25.4,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"I picked this up in Chicago for $10.49 this week, 1pt .9oz bottle. It pours dark brownish black, completely opaque, a few fingers of tan foam and dried lace on the glass. The beer smells and tastes perfect, this is exactly the way I want a smoked stout to be. Smoked malts and dried meats, like beef jerky mixed with brown sugar, this is so addictive. A little chocolate in the aftertaste too, and a long lasting flavor of coffee in the aftertaste. The body is creamy like an oatmeal stout, nice match for the rich flavors. I want to see this available in OH.","TurdFurgison","Aug 25, 2010"

3.88,1.6,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,"d - A very interesting smoked stout. I thought it looked amazing and had a great feel to it. It also smelled pretty good, but wish the taste wasn't as bitter. Would try again.","mdfb79","Aug 25, 2010"
3.97,3.9,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"This beer appears a deep shade of black, with hints of brown only detectable at the crest when held up to the light. The beige head is surprisingly small and recedes quite rapidly, leaving only faint traces of lacing. The aroma is remarkably similar to the non-smoked version, Beer Geek Breakfast, as the smoky aspect is more subdued than I would have guessed. The beer has a nice flavor, with roasted and burnt malt taking center stage. The smoke flavor is a welcome addition, and integrated nicely. The body is medium-thin. There is noticeable bitterness in the finish from the charred malt that lingers in the tongue between sips. This is a good beer and worth trying. It's a nice variation of the original.","Huhzubendah","Aug 24, 2010"
4.2,9.9,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Thanks to the staff at Winchester Wine and Spirits for hooking me up with this bottle. This one pours out completely black, with a large, creamy tan head. The smoke isn't the first thing that leaps out at me with the smell. More dark chocolate, oatmeal, char, and molasses. That smoke/meat character does show up more as the beer gets warmer. The taste kicks thing up a notch, as this is really reminiscent of the campfire. Not so much meaty, as just straight up earthy smoke; Think wood and pine needles. It comes off a little astringent at times, as that smoke taste is very intense, and bitter in some places. Mouthfeel is medium, not quite as big as the regular Beer Geek or Brunch Weasel. I had no trouble finishing off this bottle, though I expect you need to really like smokey beers to fully enjoy this one. Final thoughts are that this is a smoked beer lovers dream come true. This is about as intense as it gets with this style from what I can tell.","jamie2dope","Aug 22, 2010"
3.68,-3.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Overall, this is a solid smoked stout. Probably one of the better smoked beers I have had. Lots of different layers to this beer. Great drinkability. I dig it.","mothman","Aug 19, 2010"
3.41,-10.7,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,2.5,"Poured from a bottle into my Zatec Fluted glass. About a finger and a half of dark brown head with not much retention. No lacing to speak of. Smells of smoke and coffee. Not much else. Tastes like smoke. Thought I got a hint of coffee, but then, oh wait, smoke. Very foamy, nice mouthfeel. Finishes very dry. Interesting beer. Not my favorite, but interesting.","WestValleyIPA","Aug 17, 2010"
3.9,2.1,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Draft. Poured as Mikkeller Rauch Geek Breakfast. Smoky smell dominates the nose. Dark black pour with a slight tan head. Coffee notes as well. Sweet upfornt with smoke taste that builds as you sip and the beer warms. Medium mouthfeel. Slight bitter ending. Not a huge smoke fan but this one is ok in my book. Glad I tried it but nothing I would seek out.","kbutler1","Aug 16, 2010"
4.62,20.9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: I was totally in the mood for this and it didn't disapoint in the least. On the contrary. To me it set new standards for what to expect from a smoked oatmeal coffee stout! Phenominal!","GbVDave","Aug 13, 2010"
4.62,20.9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is a fantastic beer. I'm a big fan of smoked beers, so this one really hit the spot. Mikkel really knows how to make a stout as I've rarely had a bad one. That said, with this beer, you better like smoked meat!","gford217","Aug 12, 2010"

4.55,19.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"DB- Very surprised to hear that people think this is overly smoky. It really isn't drastically different from Beer Geek Breakfast, just a bit of smoke on top of what is already one of the best Oatmeal Stouts there is. Coffee + Smoke + Roast Malt = A+.","cbutova","Aug 12, 2010"
2.19,-42.7,4,2.5,2,2.5,1.5,"D: It seems some brewers just way overdo the smoke in these kinds of beers. While I enjoy some smoke flavor in certain beers (like a porter or stout), this was like sucking down the smoke of a campfire.","womencantsail","Aug 11, 2010"
3.85,0.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4," The thing I like about this beer is the level of smoke. It is not overwhelming, but it is definitely there and goes really well with the traditional stout characteristics. Other than that, everything is basically pretty normal, except that this beer is notably smooth and drinkable. I keep on wanting to savor the smoke!","tombcrypt","Aug 10, 2010"
2.67,-30.1,4.5,2.5,2,4,3,"D- It's a good stout, but a failure as a rauch beer. I'd order this again if I was in the mood for a stout, but as far as the taste is concerned, this is a rauch beer in name only.","jmhart","Beers"
4.35,13.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall I was a fan of this beer and thought the smokiness was well done. It didn't overpower the beer and instead augmented what is already a nice beverage. Worth a shot.","glid02","0"
