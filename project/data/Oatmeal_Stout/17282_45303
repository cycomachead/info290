Looked like an average stout at the pour; trended toward dark brown hues rather than the pitch black color of other stouts. Aroma was faint coffee...not much else. Taste was extremely unbalanced to me: all I got from it was bitter, astringent coffee grounds. No oatmeal sweetness at all. Very chalky tasting and extremely thin bodied as well.  I guess I was hoping for something along the lines of Terrapin WNB with this one and it just didn't come anywhere near stacking up. I have enjoyed other offerings from Good People, but this is by far the worst thing I have tried from them to date.","bcostner1","Jan 25, 2015"

Aroma is dark and roasty with the coffee being nice and present, chocolatey,  oats give off some sugary sweetness, and closes out earthy and bitter. Flavor follows suit. I just wish they could have lowered the dosage of hops here, far hoppier than I enjoy in a stout personally. A creamier medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, a fantastic stout up until the hops assert themselves, making it is just a really good stout (for me). That said, the more I drink of this the less an issue the hops become.","denver10","Oct 23, 2014"

It wasn't life changing, but dependable enough for me to buy a six pack the next day. Unfortunately, the bottled version is much too carbonated and somewhat overhopped. The Williamette hops are more apparent than the coffee by a wide margin, and the mouthfeel is almost shockingly rough for an oatmeal stout, generally prized, of course, for a soft yet robust chewiness. This beer is certainly off the mark for its style, and sadly fails carve out a satisfying niche of its own. Perhaps worth a try if you place a great value on trying new things. It is not a complete failure, but neither is it a worthy successor to its esteemed predecessors (FBS, Sam Smith Oatmeal Stout).","mentaltraveller","Mar 18, 2014"

4.18,1.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Another good brew from the the state of Alabama. Listed as a Coffee Oatmeal Stout, this brew fully delivers on the coffee flavor with a hint of bitter chocolate. Pours with a good one finger of tan head that leaves plenty of lacing. The coffee flavor tends to overshadow the oatmeal flavor but the more you drink it, the better it gets. This is a stout with a bite, but a good bite that leaves you wanting more. A good fall/winter type beer that should warm anyone's taste buds.","gerite","Aug 06, 2011"
4,-2.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Visited J. Clyde's in Birmingham and had a chance to try Good People's brew. Took the chance to try the coffee stout that was on tap. The beer poured very dark/opaque, rich with a creamy head & decent carbonation. The scent was strong coffee/espresso aroma with a nice smack of hops. The taste had even more coffee that was fairly well balanced with sweet malt. The mouthfeel was good, decent body to this beer. Probably could have two if it were snowing outside...but on hot days...I would stay away.","WoodBrew","Jun 10, 2011"
4.05,-1.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"I lost about an 1/8 of the growler and a good bit of the carbonation in transit, but the beer itself is still really good. Maybe one day I will try it at the source.","johnnnniee","May 12, 2011"
4.08,-0.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Super rich, dark brown. Almost black. Creamy tan head that fades slow and leaves beautiful lace. The smell is full roasted with rich coffee notes dominating over a background of dark cocoa and chocolate malts. The taste follows the nose of roasted coffee, and chocolate with grassy, herbal, earthy hop notes lingering in the back. Very well balanced and delicious. Rich, thick and creamy on the mouth. Excellent beer.","JayS2629","Feb 03, 2011"

I think the same of this beer right now as I did when I was paying for pints of it at The Alcove right before their keg on HopSlam was tapped back on Thursday. This is simply one of the best regular(aka non-imperial) stouts that I've ever had.","Reaper16","Jan 16, 2011"

4.47,8.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Everything that you might have been hoping for when you took your first smell of the pint comes true in a big way once you take your first sip. There is a balanced brilliance to this stout that leaves you wondering why more microbreweries cannot make a stout as nice as this one. The coffee first hits the taste buds in a big way and the coffee highlights the quality of the roast used in the brewing process as there is not the slightest hint of any burnt coffee in the taste. There is a sweetness that also works its way into the stout behind the coffee, not in a milk stout kind of way, but rather in a way that almost perhaps just mentally gives the impression of a greater creamy nature to this stout. Roasted malts and a bit of dark chocolate rounds out the taste.","Bounty628","Oct 26, 2009"

4,-2.7,4,4,4,4,4,"On tap at the Mellow Mushroom in Tuscaloosa. Although a coffee oatmeal is not an English style, this beer struck me as having a very English stout creamyness that was very pleasant. A bit light on the carbonation, which may have been attributable to the dispensing system. Coffee flavor was not overwhelming, and the maltyness of the oatmeal was well managed.","Brent","Sep 01, 2009"

4.87,18.5,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"One of my favorites. Beautiful very dark brown color with a lovely fine brown head of foam that left nice rings of Belgian Lace in the glass. The nose was upfront coffee, oats, and chocolate. The tasted started with a fine mix of coffee and velvety oats/dark chocolate malt (breakfast anyone) with a nice balance of hops to malt. Not overly carbonated and very easy to drink.","BeerGreek","Aug 12, 2009"
4.82,17.3,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Such a great beer. Pours a deep black with tan head. Nose starts out with coffee, roastiness, etc. Taste is great. Deep roasty flavors, hints of coffee and semi sweet chocolate. Oatmeal lends the stout a smooth, velvety mouthfeel. Truly one of my favorite beers.","Sgoverton","Aug 03, 2009"
4.84,17.8,4,5,5,4,5,"A beer that feels every bit as good as it tastes, the GP Coffee Oatmeal Stout never fails to wow the taste buds. The coffee is prominent without being overbearing. The oatmeal lends a creamy mouthfeel to the beverage. The malt balances out with the bitterness of both the hops and coffee with no element overwhelming another. An excellent session beer, you will no doubt feel a bit perkier for having selected it.","sepharious","Apr 29, 2009"
4.12,0.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Growler picked up from Dee's package and consumed with some family and friends within a couple of hours. Pours a slightly murky brown with a light tan head that starts out pretty nice and fades to a thick ring. Some lacing. In the nose there is lots of coffee up front, some roastiness, and lots of bitterness. No cream in this coffee, this is black all the way baby. The taste is similar, with lots of stronf black coffee to start then a deep roasty bitterness. Quite intense and the effect is make this taste a good deal stronger than it actually is. It's actually got a little too much coffee taste in my book- too much to really appreciate any of the silkiness from the oatmeal or pick up other nuances. Still, I'm impressed with my first taste of a Good People's brew. I'll definitely be trying more.","Georgiabeer","Apr 27, 2009"

4.02,-2.2,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"D: Less drinkable than your typical oatmeal stout, but that's because this thing is suped up with coffee and flavor. Definitely one to sip on rather than gulp down. However, if they amped the body up a bit it might feel more like a sipper. Alas, when the ABV cap is lowered in this state they can up the malt and alcohol. Still, an enjoyable beer that went very well after my meal.","BamaBeerBuff","Feb 23, 2009"
4.33,5.4,4.5,4,5,4,3.5,"The beer pours up with a nice thick head the color of coffee and cream. The smell is thick with roasted malt and coffee. The taste delivers on the roasted malt promise I got in the aroma. The taste of coffee is very strong, and plays nicely with the malt character. A surprising dose of hop bitterness comes in behind and clears the palette, making this a very quaffable beer. Despite the coffee taste, I think this stout would make a terrific night cap.","BenSelf","Oct 29, 2008"
4.33,5.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D: Well the only negative thing I can say about this beer is that the mouthfeel could be a bit heavier in this stout. Still, that helps this beer in the drinkability category because it doesn't sit heavy at all and is one of the easiest drinking stouts I have ever encountered. Its simple, but still damned tasty and enjoyable. A good job goes out to the folks at Good People. Hopefully they keep it up and keep making some damn good brew.","everetends","Oct 14, 2008"

General consensus is this is as close as Terrapin Wake n Bake as an Alabamian can purchase inside state lines. Mouthfeel is a little thin but very enjoyable. If you like coffee stouts, you could drink this all night. Great beer while sitting under the heaters on an unusually cold Alabama October night. Seek this out, no telling how long it will last. Echoing some sentiment...hopefully this will become a staple in the Good People stable.","tiger88","Oct 14, 2008"

The hoppy aftertaste sucks you in, bringing you back for more and more and more. For anyone who likes coffee and hops, this is ridiculously drinkable. And you have no business ordering this if you don't like coffee. And if you're a hop head, well then all is right in the world.","Bonhoeffer","0"
