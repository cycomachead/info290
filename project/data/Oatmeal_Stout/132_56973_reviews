review_text
"I'm really confused here. There's no way this is an oatmeal stout, right? There's no oatmeal flavor or defining sweetness and the body is very very thin. The head was gorgeous and the retention and lacing are on point but flavor-wise its just so dry and thin that my mind is boggled as to how this is an oatmeal stout. Never would have guessed!"
""
""
""
"It really is too carbonated though."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I always keep a couple of these on the shelf at home because it is such a reliably great beer and only 7 dollars a bomber at Hazel's in Boulder.  Whenever I am not in the mood to try something new, this one always get a good look.  Great balance of stout flavor with the breakfast accents."
""
""
"A decent beer, just nothing special going on in any aspect.  Found the nose weak and certainly not as creamy as I'd expect from an oatmeal.  More hop than malt here."
""
""
"Not a lot of exciting things happening here, pretty standard stout that is basically just toasted malt with a light hop back, a little storebought coffee & chocolate in there as well.  Certainly good but fairly run of the mill."
""
""
""
"Creamy, tasty"
""
""
""
""
""
"I’ve had this on tap several times and it has always been a delight--much more mellow and refined than what I’m tasting from the bottle.  This bottle was pretty ordinary, save for the excessive carbonation."
""
""
"So a rehack on my first review of this beer.  A very good stout. Creamy like it should be. A good hint of hops.  Bit of chocolate in the taste that lingers.  Good nose.  Excellent stout.  (Not sure what was wrong on my first try)"
"12 oz. bottle into snifter.  Not sure of bottle's age but considering the layer of yeast caked to the bottom, I'd say it was sitting  for at least half a year.  Pours pretty dark for a 6% stout.  Looks black in the glass with rusty brown along the edges when held up to the light.  Tight tan colored head.  Roasted malts, oats, and maybe a touch of milk chocolate is what I get for smell.  Taste is mild, the creaminess makes it enjoyable but the thinness detracts from it.  A bit of a letdown for me, but I've never been a fan of Rogue's beers.  Definitely not a world class stout by today's standards."

""
"O-  Great oat stout!"
""
""
""
""
"Was disappointed with this one, Rogue makes much better stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
"Purchase Value – (C+): A 22oz bottle of this currently retails for $7.99, which means that given the quality of the beer, the consumer is getting an above-average return on their investment. Would certainly recommend getting a bottle to drink or age."
""
"Overall: Imagine a malt-forward IPA and you've got something a bit like this - it's an interesting take on the style, but even leaving out my somewhat local bias, Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout leaves this eating dust. Worth a try, but there are better oatmeal stouts out there. I kind-of expected better from a Rogue beer, and sadly I can't share the enthusiasm that others have shown."
"A great one, no doubt - but still a notch below the Samuel Smiths' offering."
""
""
""
"Great tasting Stout. One of the best beers I've had"
""
"Awesome.Simply awesome! My favorite low alcohol stout!"
""
"Overall, a pretty disappointing oatmeal stout and wondering if I just got  a bad bottle. The beer overall smells, feels, and tastes like a malty IPA. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone if they're looking for a good oatmeal stout."
""
""
""
""
"Body: Medium to full body with light carbonation. A great bitterness. Creamy."
"Pitch black with a smallish tan head. The smell is sweet - marshmallows, jelly beans, sugar cookies with a little floral hint. The taste doesn't follow the nose like I had expected. It it's think in the mouth. The floral essence hits first and then follows with a dark roasty flavor. Not as sweet as I had expected, which is probably a good thing considering how sweet the smell was.  Really good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Superb stout and the best I've had to date.  Of all the beers I try just to try this one keeps me coming back as often as possible.  Super deep roasted flavors that hang around long after the last sip.  Incredible beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is fantastic oatmeal stout - pours dark and creamy with a mocha-like head.  Complex aroma of toasted malt, expresso, and dark chocolate.  A profound taste combining rich toasted malt with a surprising infusion of almost citrus-like hops.  Long lingering finish that reflects the taste of the beer.  A must try for any stout lover."
""
"Consistently flavorful throughout, particularly thanks to the roasted grains and bitter/citrusy hops. Just enough carbonation to be satisfying but little enough not to interfere with the smoothness of the texture. Solid and straightforward."
"one of their best beer imo"
""
"Really didn't find this stout to be anything special. No outstanding flavors. Not sure why it's rated so high."
""
""
""
""
"Tasty!! Smooth stout. If that makes since. Haha. Great taste."
""
"it's creamy and smooth and goes down easy. it's delicious and refreshing when it's cold and it gets even better as it warms up a little bit (you can really taste the riesens). it's the perfect amount of sweetness. it's definitely there but not even close to being overpoweringly sweet."
"This is how a stout *should* feel, not too thick, but not watery. A solid stout with good carbonation, pairs well with spicy food."
""
""
""
"It's good. Not my style of beer but I can recognize how good this beer is."

"Poured out of a 12 oz bottle. Decent head for a stout, dissipates quickly. Almost no lacing. Heavy roasted malt aromas with a hint of sweet/fruity chocolate all of witch are prevalent in the taste. Also tasting hints of dark coffee. Medium Light mouthfeel but a good amount of carbonation."
""
""
""
"An incredible sensation with the richest smell and taste."

"O: Excellent.  Got in Chiang Mai, Thailand, drank Dec 12th, 2014. Some would say an oatmeal stout pairs with anything.  Dare you to try it with Thai ""Stinky Beans and Shrimp with Red Curry Paste"" then rethink it."

"I wanted to like this more than I did. Malty and bitter. My friend said she picked up chocolate, but I wasn't getting much of it. Maybe a hint of cocoa. I'm not getting the flavours I'd expect from this style. Maybe my taste buds are dead? Definitely no strong flavours. Finish slightly smokey."

"A little thin and reserved. Sweet chocolate syrup/bitter bakers cacao combine. There's a bit of bitter, and it's got some black coffee to it, but there's also the cacao contributing. Smoothe and easygoing, just wish it were a bit thicker/chewier/more pronounced. Small bubbles, but persistent. The carbonation punctuates the bitter coffee finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great imperial style"
"Huge coffee taste, super thick brew. Awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It tastes like some kind of coffee soda. Unless you are a fan of this style, I'd say avoid it. There's nothing good about drinking an alcoholic version of black coffee and club soda. It is not ""bad"" though; just not my cup of tea. (Bear in mind, I am a fan of dark beer and the various styles from which they originate.)"

"From one of favorite breweries, Rogue, from Oregon.  Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout is my standard for Oatmeal Stout, and this is almost as good.  Rogue seems to alway knows how to make sure the brew has character.  This outmeal stout is smooth, and, at the same time, has that kick that Rogue loves to add.  Pours thick, little lacing or head, a bit musty espresso followed by a slight bitterness.  Excellent, maybe great, but not perfect."

"O 4.25 - very impressive oatmeal stout. I don't know why I don't go for more Rogue beers, but for some reason I don't."
"I probably would never visit this again, although it's perfectly drinkable.  There are better stouts for the money (looking at SN Stout)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Here's where the beer loses me. It's a thinner bodied and creamy beer. I like the creaminess. The thinness of the beer coupled with the moderate to moderate high carbonation is too much for me, for the style. If the beer had more body and less carbonation I would enjoy this beer much more. All things said, this is a good beer. The beer gets high praise, I think there are others that should get equal marks or higher.  Glad I tried it."

"22 oz bottle.I`ve got to say that I was underwhelmed by this Oatmeal Stout.I have had better Oatmeal stouts that weren't rated near as high as this. Youngs Oatmeal was a lot better. That`s why i have to go with a low rating just wasn`t that good.Too much alcohol up front and not enough flavor.Motley out."

"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours pitch black with a thin, light brown head that has good retention and moderate lacing. Nice aroma of sweet toasted malt, chocolate, light coffee, hint of vanilla. Flavor follows, with toasted malt, coffee, chocolate and a drier, mildly hoppy finish with slight astringency. Medium bodied, lighter than I'd expect from an oatmeal stout. A nicely made, flavorful stout that does not quite have the body and rich mouth feel I've experienced with most oatmeal stouts. Stout flavor profile is near perfect with just a little dryness in the finish."

"O - I was expecting a heavier stout based off of the appearance and smell, but it is very smooth and nice."
""
"Deep black in color. Not even a hint of color on the edges. Poured with a dense, creamy, mocha foam that reduced to a wispy cap. Rich roasted malt, chocolate, and grainy cereal aromas with lightly charred malt and hops at the end. Medium bodied with a creamy, velvety smooth feel and light crispness along the edges at the finish. Dark roasted malt and coffee up front followed by chocolate flavors into the middle. Hop bitterness quickly overwhelms the malty sweetness. Tangy hop bite is followed by intense pine and light citric hop bitterness to the end. Finished semi-dryly with chocolate and roasted coffee notes followed by a lingering charred malt and hop bitterness. Complex aromas and flavors with a silky smooth feel."

"o: A very good oatmeal stout, rather more bitter than some from the almost 70 IBU's, but enjoyable as an American west coast take on the style. The bitterness makes it seem like its ABV is higher than 6."

"O- I enjoyed this Stout. I don't always enjoy Oatmeal Stouts, but this one was an exception."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a really good oatmeal stout. I paired it with baked lemon tofu and noodle salad. It kind of screams out for more robust food than that, but it was a darn good companion anyway. If you like oatmeal stouts, seek this out."
""

"Enjoyed a pint on tap at Beer Revolution in Calgary. Color is a nice inky oil slick black with reddish highlights near the bottom of the glass. Smells spicy and burnt, with some hop resins, nuts, and a slight red berry fruitiness hovering over singed caramel, wood char, and dark roast coffee. Palate is simultaneously roasted, nutty, and slightly tart, with coffee and chocolate flavors providing the base while redskin peanut, lemon rind, and chalky minerals add nuance. Reminds me of a thin to moderate bodied top-tier Irish dry stout with an extremely smooth, creamy mouthfeel. The smoothness has to be experienced to be believed. A drinkable oatmeal stout that has some hop presence and is curiously devoid of prominent sweetness. Screams ""American"" when compared with excellent British examples like Samuel Smith and not in a bad way."

"Can't believe I haven't rated this. Pours nearly black under a large, lumpy tan head. The foam settles to a solid sheet in the surface; minor lacing. Smells of dark malt, subtle oats, roasted barely, and earthy hops with a slight soapy/floral note. Lots of chocolaty roast in the flavor and some citrusy hop bitterness. Creamy smooth, not quite full bodied, but appropriate for the style. I imagine I would have rated this one higher years ago, but hey, it's still a classic. Good, hoppy stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with a nice foamy off-white head. The aroma is a combination of oats and dark chocolate, which comes off less appealing than it sounds, unfortunately. Otherwise the beer is fantastic. Has a nice mix of sweet malts, oatmeal, chocolate, and even a touch of bitterness in the taste. Goes down smooth and has an excellent full body feel."
""
""
""
"Opaque black brown under a nice large medium brown finely foamy head. The head fades to a thin layer leaving behind spots and strings of lace. Aroma is deeply and softly chocolatey, rich with oats, a smidge of vanilla, and some sort of berries underneath. Very nice. Taste is richly sweet, smooth, toasty, and evenly bitter through the finish. Bright lactic sweetness and coffee roastiness... Mouthfeel is soft, smooth, slick, and blankety. Overall a very nice oatmeal stout."

"Pours thinnish black, looks like it could be a bit diluted, with just about no head. Aroma is roasty with some coffee, sugars from the oats, and some earthy hoppiness. Flavor starts off roasty and then earthy bittering hops, but then finishes up and extends into the aftertaste with some nice sugars from the oats, roasty coffee, and burnt char mixed with some hops. The finish is by far the highlight of this beer. A creamy lighter to medium mouthfeel. Overall, the beer that got me into oatmeal stout. I still really like it but not sure I love it like I once did. Too many other great oatmeal stouts I have since discovered, making this one more middle of the pacl rather than top dog."

"22 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light coffee, light char, oats, toast, caramel, dark bread, floral, and roasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and oat notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, caramel, light char, oats, dark bread, floral, and roasted earthiness. Light earthy/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, caramel, light char, oats, dark bread, floral, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and oat flavors; with great robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very creamy, smooth, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent oatmeal stout! All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt and oat flavors; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Pours a dark...well really dark, just like a good stout should. I see a bit of lacing but not much. There's very little smell, could just be me. I do detect sort of a chocolatey smell with some burnt parts. Hmm, the taste is a little different than i was expecting. I'm very used to a heavy taste/texture from oatmeal stouts. This one, however, has a smoother taste noted by an earthy body and a sort of chocolate finish. I knew there was chocolate somewhere in here. A lot less of the actual oatmeal can be tasted in this one. I like the mouthfeel, although, i'm not entirely sure it fits the style, i.e. heavy almost like you ate a loaf of bread. Well, overall, i'm actually a little disappointed. I really was expecting to get a heavier offering like Oatis from Ninakasi or the Oatmeal Stout from Samuel Smith's (my favorite to date). I still think this one is worth checking out as it highlights differences in the style of the oatmeal stouts.."

"Poured into a 16 oz snifter, not sure when ur was bottled. Why Rogue Why! Give us a date please! Pours so dark and a incredible mocha head. The most impressive looking regular stout I have ever seen. Smell is chocolate, toffee, roasted coffee beans, and vanilla. Taste is what you expect from the nose, but this is a complex 6.1% Seriously amazing this stout is only a regular stout, drinks like milk shake. Body is very big for its just above average abv. For me this is the gold standard of oatmeal stouts, wow so special. On tap even better, that is a side note, but almost every beer is better on tap."

"O-It is great to finally try this classic of craft beer. For me, the reputation is mostly deserved...you get solid flavors, smooth feel, great drinkability, and no gimmicks.

"Overall, a solid stout from Rogue. It has all the traditional flavors and smells associated with other stouts. However, for this reason it is fairly forgettable. There are plenty of other stouts on the market you could get more for a cheaper price and you wouldn't be missing out on much from this brew. I probably wouldn't buy this again but only because I know of other stouts I prefer."
""
""
""

"I like this beer; it is comparable with Ninkasi's Oatis for a bitter malty oat stout. I did not even know it was made with oatmeal until typing up my napkin-scribbled review. It tastes like a thick stout with harsh dark-roast coffee bitterness. The American hops are incongruous with the rest of the beer. They should be toned down and perhaps replaced to some extent with Noble hops...or more caramel malt!"

"The color was quite dark and the moderate head was a beautiful tan color. I was looking forward to this one after reading some of the very good reviews. However, this brew had a bitter aftertaste that I could not get away from. Perhaps I got an off bottle and will make another try.."

"You better come thirty for this bad boy or its money wasted. Let’s start with the oversized behemoth of a 1 pint 6oz bottle for around $7. I can’t drink that much stout after work and would love a smaller 4 pack option. The pour was good with lots of rich creamy brown head. Has a nice sweet fruity smell that puts my grinning face deep into the glass. My thoughts are easily lost in deeply roasted malts and tantalizing bitterness. It has everything that I like in oatmeal stout, but the cocoa was a bit overpowering for me in the aftertaste near the end of the bottle. Nitpicking the logical minds, Shakespeare didn’t know chocolate, so maybe they should rename this beer to imply what it really is, Chocolate Oatmeal Stout. Anyways, in short there is nothing unexpected, just a good stout with lots of sweet and bitter flavors. Only negative is the price and size limits the purchase options from me without a friend to share it with."
""

""
""
""

"T/m- subtle well rounded stout. Not overwhelming in any particular are. Chocolate coco flavor, some mocha, a good amount of malts with some tones of vanilla. Very drinkable beer with little to no aftertaste and the alcohol is masked very well. Full bodied could be a little thicker in my opinion."

"Roasty, chocolatey, with a hint of dark fruit. Not my fave stout, but fairly drinkable. Nothing exceptional, but good balance of chocolate and roast flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As far as stouts go, this one is a little too light and bitter for my tastes. The subtle metallic smell and taste kind of threw me off. I'm new at paying attention to what I taste, so I could be mistaking that sensation for something else."

"Overall- A decent oatmeal stout but nothing special. I have had several that I would prefer over this."

"Pure dark brown/black with a very coarse tan head, sea foam like.Head does not last very long at all. Smell is quite roasted and coffee like. Taste is dry and a little bitter. No real sweetness to speak of. Grain notes picked up. Coffee ground flavors. Body is smooth with light carbonation. Pretty decent stout with a dry bitterness."

"Pours a fairly solid dark brown/black color with a smallish khaki head that persists quite well. Smells of caramel and roast with hints of cream vanilla and earth. Light bits of dark fruit aroma as well as hints of light sugar round out the nose quite well. The flavor is roasty chocolate vanilla with a hint of chalk and earthy hops. Medium body with a creamy velvety smooth mouthfeel and a light level of carbonation. This is a really nice stout, approachable yet flavorful and creamy as hell."

"Solid oatmeal stout here, and actually one of Rogue's less expensive bomber offerings. Nice, robust flavors along with a friendly mouth feel and a low ABV make this stout super drinkable any time of the day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Would I buy this beer again? Maybe."
""
"Pours a jet black color with large mocha head. Some decent lacing & foam clings to the glass. Smells chocolately first, then roast character really takes over as it warms. Slight burnt character. Earthiness aromas as well, likely from the hops. Tastes a tad acrid from the roast. Subtle chocolate, caramel, light vanilla notes. Tastes bitter but not a ton of hop flavor. Again, the earthiness comes into play. Feels about medium to medium-full. Oats give it a nice velvety creamy feel. Overall, this is a quality beer I've been looking forward to trying for awhile. Would love to try this one super fresh when the hops are more fresh and in your face. (Didn't see a bottled on date.)"
""
""
"O- Overall this is a fine and very tasty stout. I love how the oats, coffee, and hops blend with each other. I would definitely get this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is great as far as enjoying a stout goes, and only my second beer tried from Rogue (the other being their chocolate stout). I recall more sweetness with their latter, and that's a quality I prefer in stouts. But all in all, surely try this if you haven't. I would again for sure."

"Pours a rich dark brown with a nice froth. Smells exactly like most stouts--malted with some hints of dark chocolate and honey. A little yeast as well. Taste is very roasty with dark chocolate flavor throughout. There is a hopped zing in the finish, which is subtle but evident. Good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque very dark brown with an Irish coffee froth colored head. Aromas of chocolate and coffee bean. Mouthfeel is a little thin for the style. Not unappealing, just not complimentary of the flavor. Nothing like a good, creamy, viscous fluid to deliver flavors of chocolate and coffee so nicely. A lot of chocolate flavor is noted with some underlying coffee. Coffee bitterness lingers long after the beer is gone. I'd been really excited about trying this one, but I'm disappointed."

"O - Very good. Not quite as fine-tasting as a Founders Porter but leaning in that charred direction. Not as rich in the taste or mouthfeel as a Founders Breakfast Stout, and no coffee in this one. Nevertheless, it's a very good tasting, lowish ABV stout that I enjoyed."

"Very well done, smooth and full of rich roasted tastes, this is when drink beer for the sake of just having a beer is so worthy."

"O: An awesome example of the style. This has everything I want in an oatmeal stout. Smooth as silk, well-balanced roast and chocolate."
"Serving type: 22oz bomber."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is a nice, easy to drink stout. The nitro tap adds a great mouthfeel and a creamier taste. The roasted malts and traditional stout flavors are on point and balanced. Overall, this was a very enjoyable pint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep black color with thick brown head. Smell of dark roasted malts predominantly. Taste is like a strong cup of french roast coffee - that level of roasty, bitter flavor. Surprisingly bitter and well-balanced by the hops. Pretty smooth and creamy feel too. Just what I expect from an oatmeal stout. Good stuff."

"O - An excellent example of the style. Delicious, raw oat flavor counter balanced with rich roasty cocoa and just enough brightness from the hops."
"This is a well-rounded, well-balanced oatmeal stout. It certainly doesn't break any ground, and it's probably not going to blow anyone's mind, but it stays very true to the style. It's a great example of what all oatmeal stouts should be, and it's one of the most solid offerings I've had from Rogue."
""

""

"Overall- Good solid beer, but not Rogue worthy and defiantly not 90+...great winter drinking beer"

"O: I find the flavors and aromas of this beer though the bitterness does make it a little tough to drink. Very enjoyable and one I would have again but this is not a sessionable beer - between the bitterness and the dryness."

"O: I'm wondering if I served this too warm - but then I realized I had Samuel Smith's oatmeal stout at a similar temperature, and was far superior to this in just about every manner. I'd definitely try it again, just to confirm whether or not my fears are true. All in all, it's far from bad, just disappointing."
""
"Medium bodied, light effervescence, slightly watery aspect. Drying to a slight extent. Needs more body and some sweetness. This isn't a good a beer as I had hoped, especially with the high rating it got. Oh well, one man's poison.... A good beer, but not great, imo. In fact, nearly every beer lower than this (#56 today) on the ""Beers of Fame"" list I prefer over this one."
""
""
"Served in a pint glass at the pdx airport via nitro line. Beautifully pours creamy black with two fingers head. Aroma not too apparent as it was served in a pint, but hints of a malty essence and oatmeal of course. Drinks thick and creamy and very delicious. Although nothing really stands out about this beer, it is very drinkable and balanced and extremely satisfying especially waiting for a flight departure. Highly recommend stopping by the rogue taproom at pdx, and a friendly bartender! Cheers!"

"D - A solid stout from a solid brewery. I know Rogue is a bit of an afterthought for many American BAs, but they're basically the only American craft brewery that ships a wide catalogue of beer up to Western Canada, and I'm thankful for that. While this doesn't pack the punch that a lot of bigger, imperial stouts do, it's still a dark, smooth, and drinkable beer, even on a hot summer afternoon."
""
""
"It is kind of like a nitro pour, with the big creamy foam. It's just so bitter and strongly, severely flavored. From the 22 oz bottle, which cost $7 in San Diego."
""
"This is a really good stout, I'm starting to wonder if I had a nitro-pour now because of texture. I didn't see the tap myself so I don't know. But this is everything I'd want from an Irish style stout, with the added bonus of oatmeal malts and great flavor to boot, something that sometimes falters in lower ABV stouts. I would have this again. And again."
""

"Overall - This is only like, my favorite beer ever. when I'm drinking a Shakespeare, I don't have a care in the world. Sensual qualities. Sexy smooth."
"Overall – This is an outstanding beer. Superb in every category, easily sessionable at 6.1% ABV, smooth, silky, tastes great, everything about it is quality. While I have had Rogue beers before, this is my first review of one, and I hope to convey this beers outstanding qualities as best I can. I don’t know if I can make the call between this and Samuel Smith’s, the only reason I may call it for Samuel is strictly price. Where I am Smith’s is $4 a pint, Rogue is $8. Otherwise, those two beers are neck and neck. Highly recommended, expecially with some Ghiradelli or Godiva chocolate."
""
"Bomber while having some dinner at The Black Pearl in Ann Arbor. Pours thick black with a fluffy white head. Aroma of some coffee and mostly roasted barley and other grains. Thinner than expected on the palate, but still pretty hearty. Flavors of toasted coffee, dirt, bitter chocolate. Very nice beer overall."
""
"O: Rogue does it again. This is a perfect example of the style and always a treat. To bad its hard for me to find :/"

"Happy to find this at Pies & Pints in Middlebury, CT this stout shows a solid black color with a big, never-die chocolatey colored head with lots of luscious lacing. The aroma is a very subtle chocolate-grain, but hard to place. The flavor brings charcoal-dark chocolate and grass hops. Charcoal-malt emerges as the dominant theme but it’s very nicely blended into a highly drinkable, yet tasty brew. This is creamy smooth and velvetty in feel, really wonderful and inviting. Body is solidly medium with a bit of a dry/resinous feel. Very nice and a stout I would easily have any time!"
"O - Mild like you'd expect, but with just enough subtle character to rescue it from being bland and put it into the nicely done category. I'd call it a mature oatmeal stout, like what they tried to do with the Arch Deluxe. It's hard for this style to score highly due to its innately mild and subdued character but this is pretty well done. I put this up there with Samuel Smith's."

"I love the full-bodied taste and the sweetness that undercuts the bitterness. Its not enough to cut it entirely, and it does sit on the palate and bite afterward. But really, this is strong, rich and smooth. The chocolate-y coffee notes are there, and thus make this beer definitely a new favorite of mine."
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this on nitro-tap, pours incredibly smooth and took quite a while for the head to settle. The smell is very light, hints of oatmeal and malt. The Oatmeal gives the taste a sweetness which we really enjoy. You can taste the oatmeal, malts, and overall roasted flavor. The mouthfeel is amazingly smooth and so easy to drink. Overall this beer was extremely enjoyable and very well done."

"Poured from 750ml bottle into a snifter glass. Pours opaque black with a thin beige head. The nose lacked rich, creamy chocolate and oatmeal that I expected. Picked up more coffee and some green herb notes instead. The taste is of more chocolate, going into a burnt cocoa or even liquorice or charcoal. The palate medium bodied, there is a creamy texture in the middle section and a dry (unfortunately slightly astringent) finish. Expected more out of this one bc of its high rating. Not going to be on the bandwagon on this one. Sorry."
"wonderful beer i think im out of my beer slump great taste nice on the tongue a beer worth drinking a beer worth looking for nothing else to say you neither like it or you dont drink and enjoy nothing more to say it black always good a mighty fine beer thats doesnt disappoint"
""
"O - Overall, this was a decent stout, but not one that really stood out for me. The sum of all the aromas and flavors just didn't seem to come together quite right for my palate. That said, the look and mouthfeel of this beer were great, and I'm hoping the next Rogue beer I try will bring some redemption."
"Extreme stout with lots of body, malt and roastiness. Almost no residual sweetness perceivable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I may have found a new favorite beer. All the aspects work in harmony. You devilish Rogue Ales."
""
"Overall: A decent oatmeal stout, but disappointing for a stout made by Rogue. Certainly served too cold and deserving of a re-tasting. I know you feel my pain. ;)"
""
""
""
"O-really good. Much better than I was expecting when I bought it. I highly reccomend this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Maybe my favorite oatmeal stout, just a fantastic beer to have with a desert, or even as a desert by itself. The wide availability of this beer makes it even better, an absolute must have in the stout category. If you haven't had this, grab it the next time you go to the store."
""
""
""
"O - Excellent oatmeal stout, one that I will seek out more often."
"Funny how Rogue gets hated on all the time on BA, yet brews like this get very good reviews. One thing's for sure, this beers is a looker. It's a deep brown color with a large mocha head that leaves nice lace down the mug. The aroma is pretty stout-y, with plenty of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, and a bit of grainy oat. The taste mostly follows this, with a nice amount of roasted malts dominating the show, with some roasty coffee and grainy oat on the finish. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I'd like, which seems to be par for the course for Rogue's stouts. The drinkability is quite good though. Overall, it's a solid stout that I think would be well-suited for six-packs. Let it hit warm up a bit, it really helps bring out it's flavor."

"Poured black with a starkly opposing creamy tan head. Gotta love nitro. Aroma was as expected: dark roasted malts, toasted grains, notes of coffee and cocoa, with promises of earthy hops. Taste followed the aroma: dark malts and grainy oatmeal, roast and toast, cocoa, some coffee bitterness, and a hint of earthy hops. Smooth, though not as full-bodied as expected from a oatmeal stout on nitro...about medium-bodied I suppose, but still smooth and easily downable."
"O: This is an outstanding Oatmeal stout. Wonderful head, perfect roasted flavor and so creamy. I wish the nose was a bit more interesting. Overall, I liked this better than the Breckenridge."

""
""
"starting off the new year with a rogue breakfast, having this and the hazelnut. after hearing lots of good things about this one, i feel let down a bit. poured a dark brown with a half finger of mocha colored head that leaves very little lacing as the drink disappears. smell and taste are both the same with faint hints of roasted coffee, chocolate and the oats seem to be the last thing you experience. maybe it's just me, but i like the oats to play a more prominent roll. has a medium body with ok carbonation and a bad bitter finish. wish it was thick and chewy so i could enjoy the oats. this is just an ok oatmeal stout."

"one of my favorite stouts. pours dark dark browm almost black cascading from the nitro tap with a memorable creamy head. smells rich and dark malty, with notes of unsweetened cocoa and coffee. taste is a little bit bitter at the end, but not a hop bitterness as i know it to be, more like bittersweet chocolate. the mouthfeel is so creamy and smooth, full bodied and as drinkable as any stout in the game. a wonderful noontime drink after a hard night of drinking. rejuvenating and delightful"
""
""
""
"Overall, pretty good but wish the carbonation was a bit milder."
"This beer is pretty great. Big roast notes in this oatmeal stout. It is ridiculously drinkable, and this bomber is disappearing before my eyes. There are big notes of roast and coffee with a bit of chocolate in the taste. This stout should always been in any stout lover's refrigerator."
""
"Dammitall, Rogues have gone from blah to outright bad on this one. This beer is borderline lousy. Hope I got a bad bottle. Last time I reviewed a Rogue beer I swear I was taking a Rogue hiatus. Apparently the hiatus ended, but that goes double this time."
"NOTE: This is the EXACT same beer as the Chocolate Stout. The only difference is, with that one, Rogue uses a high grade (expensive) Belgian Chocolate."
""
""
"D - Very smooth and tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, this is an excellent stout. It's got several flavors that come through and it's a good session beer, that is if you want to pay the $6 per bomber ..."

"22oz bottle. Pours black as night with a mocha head. Aroma of chocolates, coffee and some alcohol. In the taste, more of the aforementioned chocolate, vanilla, roasted malts, coffee, char, espresso and very little booze or alcohol. The oats have made this beer silky smooth and goes down very nicely and easily. This bottle had some age on it, and was still very nice. Overall, a solid oatmeal stout with good flavors that went well together. Would be a fine dessert beer to pair with chocolate."
"O: Another overrated and overpriced beer by Rogue. I expected more given the price tag, and I prefer Anderson Valley's Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout a lot more to this one."

"O - This is an excellent showing of how an oatmeal stout should be. Nice and heavy, with good coffee and chocolate flavors, it is certainly one I will be adding to my regular list. Recommend any beer lover to at least try it once."
"Is it world class? Not quite - but it is very very good."
"O - Impressive, an oatmeal stout done right! This is a beer I go back to again and again because of it's varied flavours and excellent body. Try it."
"O-Great complexity of rich flavors. Would definitely recommend"
"Can’t think of many ways to make this better!"
"I was able to try the Rogue Shakespeare Stout at Moe Joes in D'town Plainfield, IL. The beer poured dark and opaque and very little head formed on the first pour...in addition the beer did not lace. On the second pour there was a bit more head, and some lace. The smell was roast espresso. The taste was pretty much roast and coffee. As the beer warmed a bit of the acidic coffee flavor came out. The mouthfeel was good, fuller bodied stout, which I like and not overly crazy with the alcohol. Overall the beer was decent."
"D: i remember this being better in my early craft beer days, but i have a few complaints here. just not as smooth and creamy oat flavor on the palate as well as a carbonation that detracts from some of the lighter nuances. not sure what the deal is. certainly a fan of many things rogue, but not loving this."
"Overall- I really thought this was a well made stout, there are few missteps that stop this beer from being really great, like the hops in the drink and the mouth feel. Do yourself a favor and let this one warm up considerably. That is where it really shines."
"This beer is slicky and oily with a good level of carbonation, head retention is pretty weak. This beer is thinner than I would like it to be but pretty easy to put down."
"Tar black with tight creamy brown head that falls to a finger's thickness, black coffee and dark cocoa fight it out with slightly resinous cascades. With warming softer milk chocolate emerges along with some grapefruit rind. The slightly oily and creamy mouthfeel rounds out a fantastic all-around stout."
"O: This beer is absolutely one of my favorites. This beer is incredibly well balanced and very rich."
"Verdict: A really nice stout from Rogue, warm and toasty, goes down easily. Great for those chilly nights or cool afternoons."
"Overall- I've not had too many oatmeal stouts, but I can honestly say it's hard for me to think of a more drinkable, well-balanced and just plain enjoyable stout. Cheers to anyone who has or is thinking about trying this great beer!"
"Pours an opaque black with a 2 inch puffy khaki head that settles to a thin film. Thick foamy rings and spots of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted oats, roasted coffee beans, and some bittersweet chocolate aromas. Taste is of the toasted oats and roasted coffee grounds up front with a cocoa powder flavor on the finish. There is an assertive roasted coffee/cocoa bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a crisp but thin bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good oatmeal stout with some nice coffee and chocolate flavors to balance things out. A bit too thin in my opinion."
"O - Decent beer, glad I gave it a whirl but not overly impressed."
"Bomber at Nikki's"
"A great stout!!"
"Pours deep dark amber in color.Light brown foam.Close & creamy, small bubbled.Thick layer with fairly good retention.Brief lacing rings.Toasted malt,oat & subtle chocolate aromas. Extremely dry palate.Chocolate flavor is backed by dry nuts.Dry hoppy aftertaste hids choco notes.Full body & high viscosity for a just 6,1% ABV beer.May be chewed it up!Drinkability is ok."
"I was considering giving up on the style so I stocked my fridge (via my beer fridge) with my stout stock and thought that i would trudge through a style that had lost its luster for me. I have changed my mind. I hope I can find some more opinion changers in my own fridge."
"poured from bottle to a pint glass. Pours pitch black with good tan head that strays around. A very alluring nose with lots of malt, xoffee, chocolate. Taste is very good with lots of dark roasted malt and a good hop balance. Another very good beer from a very consistently great brewery."
"O) A good oatmeal stout. Full bodied and rich with flavor. Appears to be adequate carbonation and well-balanced. Head seems to stay nicely with the glass. Will have again."
"This beer is probably one of Rogue's best beers. I was happy to have finally gotten some one day at a local Wegman's when I was there. The beer poured out as a deep black color with what appeared to be a pretty thick body! Surprising for Rogue to have something like this from what I've had from them in the past. The smell of this beer is big, roasted, malty, and chocolaty. The taste follows the same path, it's got a lot of roasted malts and chocolate in the mix. The mouthfeel of the beer is indeed pretty thick, I'm very happy that this beer actually has some good body to it. Overall I think this was really nice."
"Overall: Sweet roasty malts, a bit of floral hops. The smoothest dark malt aftertaste I've ever experienced."
"O: Kind of disappointing. Meh-ish stout. I would have again, but if this glass is any indication, I wouldn't recommend it."
"A solid offering, very reliable but nothing extraordinary. I've had it before and I'm sure I'll drink it again."
"-Overall 4.5: Excellent stout. Smooth, warming and at the same time refreshing, this beer set the bar high for itself, what with all the awards won listed all over the bottle, but it certainly lived up to the hype. Worth tracking down and worth the $5+ pricetag per 650 ml bottle. That Pacman yeast should be proud of itself."
"Overall I will be drinking this beer again for sure. I enjoyed this one for sure, it was super fresh as well."
"Fairly good, but not nearly the best oatmeal stout I have tried."
"From the 22 oz. bomber. Sampled on August 25, 2011. It pours a rich cherry-brown to black with a silky, gentle tan head that dissolves to a ring but not completely. The aromas are an enticing mix of chocolate, oatmeal, and Northwestern hops. The body surprised me as it came in a little lighter than medium weight. The taste had a nice, mellow chocolate malt character with a dashing dose of hops to carry it to the end. Great aroma, great taste, but a weaker body than I anticipated."
"The only detraction is the nitro, I bet it would be better on straight co2"
"Overall. This is a mistress in a bottle. This beer went into my all time top ten list as soon as I tried it and is hands down the best stout I have had. Take your time with this one. Don't be the perverted uncle, though. That was kind of creepy."
"O - Rogue has an excellent Oatmeal Stout here. I havent had many, but as a stout lover this will be something I'll enjoy over and over again. Everything seemed to fit in just right and all the notes seems to be spot on in a manner that's world class. I could honestly drink this brew anytime of day. It's very satisfying."
"Overall, this is an excellent stout, and it's easy to see why it's a gold-medal winner: it's been well-crafted, lavished with pounds and pounds of ingredients, and brewed to perfection by someone who truly loves stouts."
"O - Nothing amazing, but a very nice beer for the style. Glad I tried it, but there are better offerings out there."
"Overall: A great beer with dinner, and I think this would be fantastic with a wide range of desserts. The flavors would compliment a variety of highly sweet desserts, but serve as a nice counter due to the higher bitterness level in this beer. An enjoyable stout all on its own, but far better with food."
"O: This is just one of those thoroughly enjoyable beers. Very easy to drink and well made."
"I would love to get my hands on a keg of this stuff."
"Overall. Great example of one of my fav styles. This bomber went way too quickly."
"Maybe this bottle is a little old. This isn't an especially complex stout, but it's good, drinkable. When I give the glass a good swirl that tan head comes right back - not sure what exactly that indicates, but I like it."
"Enjoi!"
"O - Overall I think this was a great represenatation of the style. Really, really good mouthfeel and appearance helped push this oatmeal stout along."
"O: The silky feel matches up well with the malty goodness, but as I drank more I found the smoky taste built too much. 4"
"Poured a darkest black. Small, dark tan head. Smell was more bold malts and oats than anything else. Taste was direct and simple for a stout, I'd say. Which is to say it was good. Deep, roasted coffee and not-too-bitter chocolate. Went down relatively smooth. Overall, I'd sample another, but this isn't a stout I'd go out of my way for.."
"Overall b. Good beer would recommend trying it but not as good as other stouts ive tried."
"Overall - Very good, not outstanding, offering by Rogue. I couldn't wait to cook my wet aged steak to have this beer, but it would have gone perfectly."
"Quite a hoppy stout. Thick, creamy, and delicious. Overall sipper, but great to share and sip."
"O- In a style dominated by overpowering, high ABV, thick-as-motor-oil stouts, this beer stands out as a shining example of a simpler, lighter stout that still has plenty of gusto. I keep coming back to this beer, and it remains one of my favorites from the Rogue family."
"This beer pours a thick black color with a trace of tan foamy head that retains slightly and leaves little lacing. The aroma has strong notes of coffee, chocolate and caramel. The taste starts smokey and has notes of caramel sweetness, then finishes with some chocolate and coffee bitterness. The mouthfeel is slightly harsh and lingering. Overall a good oatmeal stout."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and almost watery, with a smoky bitter finish, a medium body that's light for a stout, and a nice smooth smoky flavor. A great stout, highly drinkable and extremely enjoyable."
"A masterpiece Shakespeare ain’t; the flavor's decent but the body's lacking."
"3) The price. I probably should win a prize for being the 1,000,000th person to mention this, but I don't understand Rogue's inflated price point."
"Pretty good stuff, as I mentioned I love porters due to their drinkibility and mouthfeel. Not too many styles have the ability to sip or slurp all the while enjoying every bit of it. I was turned off to the brew in terms of the brewery. Im not attracted to Rogue at all, I don't digg their choice of styles, I wish they made more lighter beers, but after siipping on this one for a bit i've started to appreciate Rogue not as a brewery but as crafters. They really do put a lot of craftsmanship into their products and i've sorta learned to enjoy them as a fine bottle of wine, not comparing it to others like it but rather enjoying each drink for what it is and how much soul the brewer has put into each bottle. Go out and buy one, if your a fan of stouts your in for a treat. Stay thirsty my friends!"
"You will not be disappointed by this beer."
"this beer pours black with a big light tan head. the smell is roasty and smooth. the flavor is smooth and roasty with a slight bitterness. the mouthfeel is a little thin but overall this is an excellent oatmeal stout. one of the top 5 i have had. portsmouth and mayflower are still my favorite"
"Good but unengaging due to lack of depth. The mouthfeel is as hearty as a Hawiian death metal band."
"I gave this beer a pretty standard pour into my regular pint glass and it gave me a huge two finger head. The head is super dark, darkest head I've seen in a long time, the last head that I drank that was this dark was a homebrew, so I guess this will be a quality beer! The head is mostly small bubbles, but there are a fair amount of big ones here as well. Somewhat pillowy look to it, but a little soapy too, overall a very strange looking head, but it's sticking around for quite a while and it's giving me some pretty good lacing. The body is pitch black, very few hints of born in this beer, if any at all, even when held up to the light. Overall it looks really really nice. The smell on this beer is absolutely perfect, dark malts, coffee, oats, smooth, big, everything you need in an aroma for a great stout! Perhaps some chocolate in here as well, but just overall a super well rounded smell, with all the necessary smells for it to be a great stout. What I really appreciate is that there are flavors that you don't necessarily need to put in an oatmeal stout, but you can if you chose to, flavors like chocolate and coffee. Those flavors are necessary, but they are for sure yummy, and I appreciate that Rogue put them in here and put them in well! Just a great roasty smell on this beer! Wow, that's a good beer, WOW. This beer might be better than the Wolaver's oatmeal stout, which was one of the best beers I've ever had, and for sure the best oatmeal stout I had ever had. I mean it's just so perfect, nice oatmeal flavor, slight alcohol kick, small small coffee flavor, not too much chocolate, but a tiny bit. Dark malts in the perfect amount. It's not as big of a flavor as I would like, and the alcohol is a tiny bit too noticeable, but then again it is 6.1% ABV. Those are what's keeping me from giving this beer a 5, and maybe it doesn't even deserve a 4.5, I do question that, but right now it's really hitting on all cylinders for me. It's a really really solid beer anyway you slice it. The mouthfeel is a little strange for an oatmeal stout, the carbonation is a little high, and the body is a tiny bit thinner than I would like. The body and mouthfeel overall still work for the beer, and don't kill it by any means, it's just not as great as I would expect with the amazing taste. Drinkability is amazing, it's a super easy beer to drink, even tho the alcohol comes at you a tiny bit. Overall a really great beer, we will see if the beer changes at all when it warms, but my guess is it will only get better! Definitely a contender for best oatmeal stout, and best beer I've ever had."
"Still, not bad. Always happy with Rogue's offerings."
"O - Well rounded, roasty stout with alot of charachter."
"O: Awesome oatmeal stout. Easily drinkable and finished my whole 22oz bomber in no time at all and had wishing I had another."
"Very nice oatmeal stout, especially if you enjoy bitter flavors. One to get again, now that I can find it locally again."
"Really a nice stout. Almost too smooth, if that's possible - the flavors are supremely balanced and this makes for a very fine drink."
"D: Good, but I think I'd really have to be in the mood to have this one again."
"-William Shakespeare (Romeo & Juliet II.ii)"
"O - Nothing to get either really excited about or complain about. Very average, I might feel better about it if it wasn't so pricey. Would have preferred to taste the malt more."
"O: This beer was good in all respects but lacked something special to make it the sum of its parts. I would recommend but think there are others I would reach for. Probably just personal preference. I think it was the burnt overtones that drug me down."
"A good quality oatmeal stout that just lacks in sweetness and has too much roast for my liking. Not the most affordable bomber, but still a quality beer all around."
"O: Not sure what the rave is all about with this one. It's overly smoky, has slight roast/coffee flavor, the only oats I get are of the dirt/earth variety, and not much going on here. Bit of a disappointment."
"O: A fine after-dinner brew to sub-in for your coffee or espresso with dessert. Shakespeare would pair nicely with a chocolate torte or mousse, perhaps. But, it's just as fine on its own and perfect as a digestive at 6.1% ABV; not too heavy with enough robust character to put a cap on the evening."
"O: Almost infallible - the feel definitely turned me off at times, but overall, it's very well-crafted. And, even with that snag, I still consider this one of my favorite oatmeal stouts."
"Overall, this is an excellent stout. It has a great mixture of tastes and goes down smooth. Definitely something to savor."
"Overall-I was planning on drinking this one slow and calling it a night, but the bombers gone. I really liked this beer."
"O: Great Stout that paired very well with the meat I was having at the time. Take the time to enjoy a few sips before the meal though as this changes the taste slightly and is less bitter up front during the meal."
"O - a classic all out stout, a big bodied beer with the flavour to match, extremely easy drinking"
"An exceptionally good oatmeal stout. It does everything right."
"Drinkability: I'm a fan of this style of beer so I find very drinkable, it's not a session or lawn mower beer, but I could put a couple bottles away with no problem."
"D: Its very good, nothing overpowering or lacking."
"Drinkability -- Rogue fans usually cite this as their favorite offering, and I can see the appeal. Good balance and a nice blend of roast flavors. This is definitely one of the better oatmeal stouts I've ever had."
"O - enjoyable, drinkable, doesn't get you canned in a single 22. I brewed a batch after enjoying this beer."
"O: great stuff from Rogue. Love the nuttiness in the nose, wish it showed up stronger in the taste."
"Overall, this is an excellent oatmeal stout. The complex flavor profile indicates the quality of this product and is exactly what one would look for in this style."
"Good, solid stout beer. Would not turn it down, but would not seek it out. Happy to have it whenever it's around."
"Overall I like my Oatmeal stouts just a tad thicker than this but you know I can't complain about this one right here, it will do no problem."
"I drank this one slowly as I enjoyed fish and chips, this is an excellent stout regardless of the nitro-tap and I hope to try the bottled version soon."
"overall - i still prefer rogue's chocolate stout, but this is a solid, workhorse of a beer and always worth a roll."
"O: Decent beer, but not a go to for stouts, or oatmeal stouts. Uncertain of the greatness this beer has acheived provided the beer is quite simple."
"O- this is one of rogues better beers, although i think you have to pay a little too much for what you get. still a pleasure to drink and something that often gets overlooked because of how common it is. there is alot of flavor packed into this somewhat small beer."
"D - The drinkability here is good. It goes down easy, and I could definitely drink a few of these in a sitting. I would definitely pick this one up again."
"3.0 D: Not bad, but probably the worst cask beer I've ever had. Just not enough flavor going on."
"O: A solid Oatmeal stout, however i would have liked more of an oatmeal flavor less on the chocolate. Overral i still very much enjoy this beer"
"O: A solid Oatmeal stout, but the hops knock it down a little for me, would have preferred a stronger presence from the oatmeal."
"Not the best oatmeal stout. There's a bit more that can be done here especially in the flavors. It's subtle in ways I don't love and yet it's so balanced it works. A great stout? Perhaps not, but a very good one."
"Wow, a really nice selection from Rogue. Pours a black with a tan head. Lots of lacing. Smell was not overpowering, some roasted malts, not too sweet. This reminded me of a dry Irish stout, maybe thats the oatmeal. Chocolate notes with the accompanying bitterness, coffee, and some grain. Smooth and drinkable. A really good beer."
"well balance flavors of roasted malt and slightly chocolately sweetness. smooth body, creamy head. not too heavy. very easy to drink."
"This beer starts out more on the bubbly side, which I wasn't expecting given that this is an Oatmeal Stout. As it warms, this mellows out to become quite a smooth drink. Shame on me for drinking it too fast! Big roasted flavors abound, but are well-balanced with sweet syrup, oats, and milk chocolate. Faint twig-like flavor on the finish. Good stuff here. Why I passed over this for so long annoys me. I'll have this one again."
"I can't wait to add this to my list of go-to favorites. definitely having these in stock in my cabinet"
"D-I expected much more from this beer. Not something I would purchase again, whether it be in a bottle or on tap anywhere."
"D: Overall this has pretty good drinkability as it goes down easy, although the lack of complexity doesn't lend itself to wanting a whole lot."
"D A good repeatable beer, would have another. 4  "
"6% ABV is nice and drinkable, especially when in the bomber size."
"Has a heavy mouthfeel, very complex beer, good drinkibility, beer goes down very smooth"
"D: Fairly high. The flavor is rich and the hops aren't too much, the finish is mellow, bittersweet chocolate, and the mouthfeel is rich and creamy. At 6%ABV, I could drink this all day."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, the beer is a dark black with some brown highlights under the light. The head is a chunky, light, foamy chocolatey color with good staying power. Aromas of coffee, nut, chocolate, and a little bit of pepper. The flavors are coffee first and foremost, and some slightly sweet chocolatey malt that helps to balance the bitterness. Earthy tones highlight, and there is a robust quality that does not go unnoticed. The beer is light and crisp in mouth, despite the heavy flavors. The aftertaste is bitter roasted coffee again, but with a touch of booze and rich, dark chocolate. Smooth and crisp finish, this beer is light and easy to drink. Very easy to consume in large quantities. Tasty."
"Easy to drink. I haven't been a huge rogue fan so far, but this is one nice bomber of stout."
"Drinkability - This beer is most definitely worth one's time and effort. Good all around. More than solid. Easily drinkable. It could almost be a session brew, that's how easy it went down. Perfect for a chilly evening or afternoon. Would even be good as a night cap."
"Drink- Good into stout. Soft and very drinkable. Well pairable as I had mentioned and did so with a nice sirloin. Brought out some nice flavors and sits nicely on the palate."
"D - Overall a very tasty oatmeal stout. World Class - a slight overstatement as I've had better, but a very tasty oatmeal stout nonetheless. Easily drinkable, though the mouthfeel was a bit of a turnoff. I'd take a 6-er of St Ambroise Oatmeal over this one, but not to be taken as a disappointment. Taste it for yourself!"
"D - For such a hoppy and bitter stout, this goes down very well. I would not call this a session stout, but this is certainly very drinkable nonetheless."
"Drinkability is quite good. With a tolerable ABV, an enticing scent and a pleasing taste, this Rogue beer is a great candidate to share with friends or to just indulge with by yourself. Just wish all of their brews were this solid!"
"Like many stouts I drink I let it sit out for awhile so that it would be a bit warmer. I am able to taste more if I do so. The Shakespeare is definitely complex with chocolate sweetness but also bitter like dark chocolate and coffee. The hops made themselves known too. Although it's complex I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd hoped. It wasn't too complex for me but perhaps the complexities didn't all add up for a beer that I enjoyed."
"D: Very drinkable, but the whole lack of appropriate body makes me question this being an oatmeal stout at all."
"D: Like a lot of Rogue beers, this is good, but not amazing and not really worth the price they charge."
"Goes down smooth enough, very easy to drink. Great beer."
"Cheers!"
"D - High."
"Verdict:"
"D - Very drinkable Nice even flavors, no rough edges. Good for a heavy beer, maybe a little filling though."
"D: Nice heavy stout that goes down easily because it is very well balanced."
"D: A nice, easy drinking oatmeal stout; although this is one of my favorites of the style, it--like most from the style--becomes a bit wearing as the beer goes down because of the intensity of the oats and malts; good beer though overall"
"I had very high expectations for this beer, but I was somewhat disappointed. The flavor and the body were much thinner then I was expecting in an oatmeal stout."
"D: I loved this brew. Creamy....smooth...roasty...chocolate....a little chewy grain from the oats (perhaps). I like this despite the higher price bomber being all that is available in my area. Does this come in sixers? It should. This ranks right behind Sam Smith in my book."
"D- A good beer, even a very good beer, but maybe not quite deserving of some of the hype it gets."
"A decent winter session but wasn't particularly impressed. I was left wanting a more full and smooth stout."
"D: Rogue really knows how to make a nice stout, although personally I prefer Chocolate Stout, this is a great beer. It has some great flavor and a nice feel overall."
"A big, thick, slow-drinking beer. Drinks like an imperial stout. No alcohol flavor but the heaviness seems more like a 10% abv than 6%. An impressive stout."
"Poured black with a very large light brown rocky head that was mostly diminishing and had good lacing. The aroma was of burnt cereal malts, mild resin hops and an earthy doughy yeast with strong notes of coffee and dark chocolate. It tasted mildly sweet with a hint of coffee at first then went to a slightly bitter-sweet coffee flavor that had a nice hint of chocolate and was mildly hoppy at the finish with the flavor lingering for an average amount of time. Mouthfeel was full in body and creamy in texture with a flat carbonation. Overall a nice stout, great on a cold winters night."
"22oz bottle. Pours a thick black color with a frothy, tan head. Slight lacing. Aromas of coffee, vanilla, malts and a nice overall sweet smell. Taste is a mix of vanilla, light and sweet coffee, and malts. This one is a bit light and watery but does have a decent taste. Good stout but I am surprised this is in the Top 100. Overall its worth a second look but is nothing spectacular."
"The CPJ"
"Taste is quite bitter from the dark malts, not much for hops to be found here. The finish is super dry and bitter with a light chocolate flavor lingering for a bit. The carbonation is a bit sharp at first but quickly becomes very mellow and rich. This is very well done."
"I will definitely seek this beer out again. One of the better beers I've had."
"Drinkability - This beer has an average drinkability, maybe slightly better. While it is heavier, the taste remains appealing and encouraging throughout the course of a pint-six bottle, though if you drink it too slowly the carbonation will die before you can kill the volume in your glass."
"Drinkability: The flavor gets more bitter with each sip without giving me enough complex flavor to make it truly enjoyable."
"Served from bottle into a Warsteiner mug. Poured pitch black with a three finger light tan head that subsided to a one finger slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour malt, and slight chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, oatmeal, and milk chocolate. It a medium feel on the palate with low-mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty excellent brew. A very easy drinker that has a very nice creamy mouthfeel to it. A very good balanced flavor and aroma going here. This one could be more complex to help it be great, but it is still very good."
"D: The beer goes down rather easily although I'm not sure if I could have more than one of these at a time because of the bitterness and dryness."
"Overall I probably won't buy this one again. Much better always avaliable stouts out there. Try it but it's not one I'll be keeping around. Doesn't live up to the top 100 IMO"
"Pint glass pour and I am met with a black ale with a big beige head that stays the entire session. Bitter chocolate aroma with some cocoa whiffs and roasted dark malts. Very bitter taste. I was expecting some sweet rush on the taste or at least the swallow based on the smell but there is none to be had. Black coffee, slight chocolate and malty. Bitter almost sour-like finish. The mouthfeel is too thin for an outmeal stout. Drinkability was ok. The bitter, bitter taste put me off a little. I may have had a bad bottle and therefore the review could be tainted. I recall drinking this fresher and getting a better session. Will look to re-review in the future."
"D: Great smell, pretty good flavor. Delightfully creamy and silky. I'd recommend this if you like stouts."
"Overall, this is a very good Oatmeal Stout. I will definitely drink this again in the future. I would love to try this on tap sometime."
"D: This is highly drinkable. There is hardly any hint of alcohol flavor in this beer. A great winter warmer."
"D - Super-duper stout. The stout standard bearer. The burnt malt and bitter hops flavors are great and what I look for in a stout. Not a criticism, but the chocolate really does not come out in the taste.. other than balancing out the bittering hops. I personally like this but be advised that this is not a CHOCOLATE beer."
"Thin texture was pleasing in this case, this was an easily likable beer."
"O: A quite pleasant stout. I enjoyed this more than most average oatmeal stouts. I would buy again."
"D: Decent drink, but too much hops and burnt malt for my liking in an oatmeal stout."
"D-The sour and astringent back end really hurt the drinkability."
"Very good pour from a bomber, dark with a nice light amber head. Good smell not too strong like some stouts. Some earthy and coffee tones. Tastes good at first drink, and is smooth with not a lot of alcohol taste. Lacks the creaminess of a great stout. Also like the Rogue Chocolate stout, it almost has an over carbonated feel to it. Probably would not buy again."
"No alcohol presence at all in the taste, making this dangerously close to a session beer. Something that you can drink fairly quickly and enjoy the flavor but not feel the alcohol."
"D - would sip these all day or night if they werent $7 a bottle ;)"
"The taste was the major drawback. Was expecting more, but perhaps that is the draw to this beer. A great balance that is super creamy. For me though, this is my not my Oatmeal stout."
"Poured jet black with a creamy tan head and nice lacing. Hints of caramel, roasted barley in the aroma. Very very smooth with a creamy malty mouthfeel with a blend of roasted barley, malt sweetness and hop bitterness. In the finish is a coffee after taste with a hop bitterness."
"Great drinkability, lots of flavor and low ABV. What else do you want?"
"This was a drinkable and well done stout, though it wouldn't be my personal choice as best for the style."
"I recently tried Wolaver's Oatmeal Stout and enjoyed it, but I felt more compelled to write about Rogue's excellent Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout. I love the balance - smooth mouthfeel, the roast coffee and chocoloate characteristics, nice hop bitterness on the finish. I am not a habitual stout drinker, but I have had dark brews that taste like soy sauce. That's certainly not the case here. The Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout is an excellent place to start if you're exploring this style - then you might also enjoy the Wolaver's."
"D: A solid oatmeal stout. I would certainly drink this again."
"Overall this is an amazing beer. Not as creamy as some other oatmeal stouts but very smooth and drinkable. The head leaves great lacing and the taste sticks in your mouth. I'd buy it again, but I think there are better oatmeal's out there with more bang for your $. Great Beer Rogue Brewery!!!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is between medium and full bodied, and fairly smooth drinking overall. This beer has been given pretty solid reviews by many people. I just don't find it that appealing."
"Drinkability is VERY good, and is certainly one of my favorite oatmeal stouts. Highly recommended"
"D: Great oatmeal stout, wish the nose was a little more pronounced though. Dry finish is not what I'd expect in an oatmeal stout."
"I can't say I'm a fan of Shakespeare Stout. I doubt I'll be trying this one again."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Rogue Ales--Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout--2010 22 oz. Bottle. 5.78% ABV? Calculated from 15 Plato 77% AA Specification. 69 IBU's. (3.75 / 5.0) Big dense lacy espresso head. Tight thick sediment. Opaque jet black color. No edge. Dry rich burnt espresso hop front. Sediment adds creaminess to crusty burnt rich roasted no fruit dry Stout body. Missing Oatmeal silk. Too dry crisp hot hop clean Stout end. Sampled 12/17/2010. Purchase for $4.99 @ Fred Meyer--Ballard, Seattle on 12/16/2010."
"Drinkability: heaven in a bottle during the winter. This is a great oatmeal stout. Not quite as good as Samuel Smith's, but good none the less."
"Mouthfeel: Medium body, which is a little light considering some oatmeal stouts chewiness. Very pleasant and definitely should be drunk more than once."
"OVERALL: A decent beer, but the palate let it down a little. This one is worth trying out, and definitely fits the bill if you're looking for an easy drinking stout, though I certainly wouldn't recommend going out of your way."
"This is a good beer. No overpowering flavors, it's creamy and alcohol level is moderate. It's highly drinkable."
"D: At 6.1%, it's definitely one that you can drink a bomber or 2 of quite easily"
"(D)- A decent all-around stout. For the style and $$ however, I will look elsewhere."
"Drinkability: Due to its balance, this a very drinkable beer."
"Not a bad beer, but didn't really live up to its reputation..."
"From a 22 oz. bottle poured into a large wine glass. Pitch black color with thick, brown head that dissipates quickly. Nice lacing. Plenty of chocolate flavor rounded out with ample roasted barley/coffee flavor. Slight herbal hoppiness. Flavor of roasted coffee, plenty of bitterness. Hint of dark chocolate and a touch of citrus. Full body without being overly sweet."
"D: one of my favorite oatmeal stouts. Rogue never let's me down. I'm sure I'll get it many times again."
"For the quality and the price, this one is definitely a pass."
"22oz. bottle served in my Sam Smith tulip nonic. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a dense, rocky, mocha-colored head that sizzles and pops and slowly recedes. Head eventually settles into a solid, quarter inch cap with a few spots and swaths of lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose suggests cocoa; however, it seems a bit chalky, as well as a slightly metallic quality. There's also a trace of lactose in the mix. Taste follows nose; however, there's also a roasted character and a slightly burnt/ashy flavor that lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with a lively effervescence and a semi-dry finish. A solid example of the style, but nothing to write home about here."
"Rogue always has pretty solid brews and this is just another one of them."
"Overall this is a really great beer, not exactly to style in my opinion. I like my Oatmeal Stouts a little more balanced on the bitterness scale. Drinks slightly heavier than the ABV indicates but that's great because I can have more!"
"Drinkabilty - Well, its soild but, too mild on flavors. I wish it had more coffee and or chocolate to it. You could easy down this 22oz'er. As usual, im a bit dissapointed with another rogue beer. This is good but, id for sure take samuel smiths oatmeal stout over this."
"Overall: For stouts this beer faired very well in my opinion. The flavor is great, the fragrance is excellent, the only down side to it is that I'm sure it's not an easy find on the east coast of the United States. This would be a great beer paired with red meat like a steak or lamb; or to just enjoy by itself. As for the big question ""would I have another?"" Yes I would. Enjoy!"
"With a thick and creamy mouthfeel I can't find any fault with this stout. It's an American twist on a great English ale. I would still prefer a Samuel Smith's, but that's really beside the point. Rogue should be very proud of this effort."
"D: A very good oatmeal stout. Nothing is too overpowering, a very balanced stout."
"Overall, this is not quite what I was expecting from a craft stout, but that just shows me that there are many things to learn about beer. I look forward to reviewing more very soon."
"It is a nice and creamy stout. The roasted flavors are plentiful."
"I have never tasted this beer before. I have had an Oatmeal Stout before and it tastes similar to that. Overall it's pretty good."
"Drinkability is hurt by the dryness. Not exactly what I would want from the style. It was ok, but was lacking to me. I would have it again, but won't be seeking it out anytime soon."
"Overall I enjoy this one, another solid offering from Rogue, I still like the Double/Regular Chocolate Stout better but this is right behind those two. I have had the Sam Smiths Oatmel Stout as well and I must admit I like the Rogue's version of the brew alot better. Thanks for reading and have a drink for me!"
"I will remember this beer as the beer that made me recognize the common flavour found in Rogue beers. This is not a bad stout by any means, my beer doesn't say anywhere that it's an oatmeal stout but BA says so. Not really getting any particular oatmeal stout characteristics from this though.A bit more hops on the nose than most stouts along with some chocolate and ground coffee. I can't shake the feeling that this is like a caricature of a stout. Like it's trying too hard. Ah never mind me, I'm just jibbering now."
"This is a different tasting oatmeal stout; earthy, hops and burnt malts with a chocolate flavor in the dry finish. Was expecting a sweeter flavor but this is very good stuff none the less."
"D: A very drinkable oatmeal stout, but not my favorite. Looks amazing but it's maybe a tad too hoppy (even though I'm a hophead). The bitterness is welcomed though. A great beer, but I wouldn't say world class."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. I would recommend trying it if you've never had it."
"Pours a dark brown almost black with some ruby red when held to the light. Creamy/bubbly brown head that sustained and left some nice creamy lacing. Aroma of chocolate, hazelnut, some light roast, sweet maltiness, toffee and light coffee. Flavor of dark chocolate, some coffee, roasty malts, nuts and maybe a light hop bitterness. Left a lingering coffee grind taste in your mouth."
"D-This is decent oatmeal stout, but not quite on par with what I have come to expect from Rogue."
"Overall, solid oatmeal and incredibly representative of the style"
"Pours with heavy, full, brown head. Good amount of head right out of the bottle, sticks around quite a while. Smell is of bitter chocolate, malts, caramel and some light notes of oatmeal. Not much oatmeal in the nose, however more comes out as it warms and brew is swirled. First taste is dark chocolate and malt. Nice smooth taste, with some oatmeal but very feint. Oatmeal becomes more apparent as the beer warms and swirled, similar to nose. Overall a wonderful dark stout with great flavor and depth, nice body, smell and appearance. Would highly recommend for anyone a fan or Rogue, stouts, or craft beer in general!"
"D - not a bad stout and not a bad price if looking for a stout would give this a try again."
"D: Very nice stout that is easy to drink."
"very drinkable for such a rich beer, but i don't know that i'd want to have more than a bomber of this in a sitting. i feel like this one definitely pushes the style limits a bit. could probably hold it's own against much bigger stouts in a tasting."
"D: Just because of the heaviness of the beer, I'd say it has a moderate drinkability. One 22oz bottle will do it for me."
"M/D - Medium-heavy body with a bitter finish. Velvety texture. Nicely carbonated. Well balanced flavor profile."
"D - Nice beer. Flavor kind of sticks in your mouth, though. I think I would tire soon."
"Poured a very dark brown almost black with brown highlights that had a half finger of tan head and left lots of frothy lacing sticking to the glass. The nose had some roasitness chocolate malts with citrus notes and also some hop character. After a couple whiffs I didi manage to spot out a little coffee aroma as well. The flavors were pretty much the same as the nose consisting of the chocolate roastiness upfront along with coffee, citrus, and hop accents. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a slight sweet and slight astringent mouthfeel from the coffee but it didi have a biiter hop finish. It drank quite good but I'm honestly not too enthused about hoppy oatmeal stouts."
"Pours inky black with a short crown of dark tan head. Very little lacing and impossible to find carbonation. If it's there, I can't see it. Aroma is heavily dominated by dark roasty malt, espresso, some hint of bourbon and maybe a dark chocolate bar w/dried cherries in it. Complex flavor hints at Guinness with a very dry and tangy upfront attack, almost no residual sweetness but it's there. Lots of espresso in the flavor. Evolves into this espresso slowly and with great complexity. Finish is very long, with a touch of hop bitterness, but mostly characterized by a full espresso City Roast that lasts and lasts. Very delicious and generally ok priced at $5.49/bomber. A classic in the style and worth seeking out."
"D - this went down with the quickness along with a healthy portion of lamb kabobs and hummus from my local kabobery. will drink again asap"
"Overall, very solid beer worthy of a top 250 spot. I will probably have again and would recommend you try this one out for yourself."
"Looks elegant out of a nitro. Nice and frothy. Creamy that fades but a head that leaves lace. Nose is subdued. Some dough and chocolate. Palate is a bit broader. Chocolate lace of carob, earth and tobacco. With a tad bit of licorice. Very mild leathery. Most say that it's an awesome example, but i've seen some equally if not more consistent english made."
"Poured a deep black, with a think, creamy head. A little thin in the mouthfeel, but is still smooth and unbelievably tasty. The alcohol is masked very well and the coffee and chocolate notes are subtle. The stout is very well balanced. This is one of the best stouts I have ever had and was totally blown away by it."
"A disappointing stout, not a worthy of an a- let alone being ranked as a top 100 beer based on these nutty rankings."
"Cheers..."
"MF/D: incredibly smooth, faint bubbles dance across the tongue before dissolving down the throat. easily consumable by a party of one."
"D - well this is a fine anytime beer by me."
"Notes: A nice beer with a lot of roasted and hop flavors. Lots of coffee flavors as well. I thought this was a good beer and it was tasty, but it wasn't top notch."
"Smooth mouthfeel but seems to be lacking a bit in body. Feels a little thin, but not too noticeable. A nice balanced stout overall. Good to have on occasion."
"Overall, a solid oatmeal stout, that may be one of the best representations of the style that's widely available on the market. Rogue gets a lot of crap from many craft beer elitists, but you can't go wrong with this one."
"D - I will have to try this in bottle forum to see if it was just the nitro making this awesome but it really was an overall soild stout with really nothing off putting about it. Nice offering Rogue! I could drink this one all happy hour!"
"d - At 6% ABV, I feel like you could drink a lot of this. I thought it was a very balances, solid stout I would definitely try again."
"D-great representation of the style, creamy texture, good flavors, well balanced hop profile, really a tasty drink."
"A great stout, exemplary of the oatmeal style."
"Reviewed from my notes. The beer came to me as a black opaque liquid with a soapy brown head. I could smell roasted coffee and alcohol aromas. The tastes included chocolate malts, light sweetness, tobacco and some some coffee bitterness (although the bitterness was slight). The beer has a medium body. The cask delivery method made it feel like there was no carbonation. Also at low levels was the coating, but a lot of flavor was left behind in that meager coat. This is a pretty drinkable stout, but the bitterness and coffee seems a bit strong to me. Maybe I would have better enjoyed the nitro-tap version that was also on offer that night."
"D - Fine taste, good aroma, but the chalkiness keeps me from putting this in the A category."
"D - Wouldn't want more than a bomber of this in a night. I like oatmeal stouts, but this one is a little too bitter for me to drink on a regular basis. A pretty good brew though, and worth the try."
"Drinkability: Shakespeare comes in a bomber, but I could easily drink two."
"Taste: rich full bodied stout. soe mellow chocolate. love this beer!"
"T- Fairly balanced but it leans towards a roasty bitterness on the finish. Starts with creamy smooth chocolate that segues into burnt oats and malts with a touch of hops."
"Pours a black of light's bane with a mocha head that sticks all the way down the glass, quite impressively. Smell is a caramel malt which prominently features barley and oats, plus a tinge of citrus hops, and notes of chocolate and coffee. Taste is full malt up front, barley and oats with the strong caramel taste, and the citrus hops come in for the finish. The malt is surprisingly crisp, as the beer is all around, and the hops share the finish well with chocolate and coffee flavors which blend so well with the malt. Incredible mouthfeel, super smooth and crisp. Very drinkable as while it is full flavored, it is not thick."
"A very enjoyable beer overall. Rogue is underrated on this site I find. Maybe it's their price point."
"A: The beer is a deep dark brown color, with a large light brown head that fades slowly and leaves a spotty lace on the glass. The aroma is of roasted dark malts, chocolate, oats and coffee with a touch of hops. The taste is malty up front as you would expect, with flavors of dark chocolate, roasted oats and coffee. The sweetness fades quickly and leaves the bitterness of dark chocolate and pale hops. The after-taste is bitter-sweet. Smooth and crisp, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky. Tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, I like the fact that this beer isn't as sweet as most stouts are and even though I think this is a solid beer, I've definitely had better stouts than this one."
"D - Great everyday stout, the lighter body ups the drinkability a bit. Not as big and complex as the stouts I usually drink, but certainly not something I'd pass on if offered."
"It looks like chocolate syrup or Turkish coffee - brownish black and very thick. The nose is big on mocha, heavy with chocolate, coffee, toasted marshmallow, vanilla, amaretto, hazelnuts, and a touch of coconut. Silky smooth on the palate like a cafe latte. Deliciously chocolatey, almost as much so as an actual chocolate stout. Milk Duds and chocolate chip cookies come to mind. Though it is rich and thick the overall flavor and finish are bitter, so this doesn't cloy even on cask. Fantastic stuff, an indecently delicious beer."
"Highly recommended."
"Easy drinking bomber, pretty damn close to perfect. Best Oatmeal Stout I have had since Sam Smith. Would have to taste side by side to see which is better."
"Drinkable beer, a lighter body stout, good beer to end a meal with of a night cap."
"The color is a deep rich brown with a caramel head. It is delightful in the nose - smells of sweet whole grain hearty bread. It is bitter at the first sip, then mellows a bit to a full rounded tatse - bitter up front sweet and hearty in the back. It is well balanced for a heavy beer and is very drinkable even for someone not aquainted with big beers. The beer is little heavy but would pair nice with a roastbeef sandwhich or definitely sweet deserts."
"Pours dark black with a big creamy brown head that leaves some lacing. Roasted malt aroma with chocolate and some light hops. The taste is roasty and has some really nice bitterness with coffee and chocolate. Rich and smooth mouthfeel. This is a lowish ABV stout which I like, drinkability is very good. Best Rogue beer I've tried to date!"
"Beer is medium bodied, I was expecting a little more body out of this honestly, I mean its called ""Oatmeal"" now. Lets do it. Beer is very bitter from the roasted grains, leaves a lingering taste and a graininess in my mouth. It grows in harshness the more I drink. Not my favorite oatmeal stout."
"O - Although the cost is a bit high, this is a good beer. I can't believe that I waited this long to actually review it, since I've had it a few times. Definitely one to seek out on tap if you have a choice."
"Served dark black in a large chalice - too cold from the bar tap, as usual. Looks like a soda at first, but the tight brown foam sticks very closely to the glass. Awesome lacing. Nose is remarkably hoppy, citrus backed up by espresso. The profile in the taste cuts both ways: strong, bracing hops meet in the middle, crashing into waves of coffee and roasted barley. Very aggressive, with a creamy mouthfeel that belies the huge flavor. Super hoppy stout, and still a favorite after all these years."
"About a 90-10 black to brown color ratio on the pour. A great brown head with medium lacing and retention. Faint roasted coffee and chocolate aroma. Roasted barley and a little more hops up front than your usual stout. Bittersweet chocolate, coffee and a touch of oats follow and linger on the aftertaste. Finishes nice, not dry and slight sweetness. A little light on flavor and was expecting a more oatmeal to justify the namesake. Creamy mouthfeel which is medium bodied."
"Medium body for the style and more carbonation than I would expect which makes this a nice drinking stout that could easily turn into two or three before you know it. I can see myself going back for more and a nice offering from the fellas at ROGUE."
"Opaque in body with off-white head. Light aroma of chocolate, cream, subtle citrus from hops, brown sugar. Dark chocolate flavors, coffee, roast, toast, slight hop bitterness, more ashy roast towards the end. Heavy in body but rather refreshing for a stout and doesn't sit heavily on the belly. A great night cap that can accompany dessert or just be had by itself."
"Notes: I was completely blown away by this on-tap...my brother swears by it, so I finally gave it a try expecting strong bitterness and charred aspects, but it was the opposite"
"Shakespeare Stout poured a black color, and had a good sized ale that disapted quickly. It smelt and tasted of coffee flavors, and chocholate. It was strong, but no one flavor was overpowering. Overall a pretty good stout. Not the best, but very enjoyable."
"SERVING TYPE: BOTTLE"
"not too strong. easy to drink. i could finish the bottle alone in a short time."
"D: Very drinkable, definitely will be finishing this one and wishing I had another."
"Drinkability: It is easy gong down and not too big or difficult to drink. It is sweet enough that I'm enjoying it as desert, and I think would be best enjoyed in this type of setting."
"D- really drinkable stout. It doesn't have that creamy goodness you'd expect from an Irish stout, but that doesn't mean it doesn't go down smooth...it just goes down differently. Regardless, its very drinkable and something I'll definitely look to buy again"
"This was my favorite Rogue brew I've had thus far. I will definitely pick this up again"
"This is very different from what I thought it would be. Hoppy yet balanced. Good chocolate in a regular stout."
"Mouthfeel is on the heavier side with moderate to low carbonation. The oats give it a little creamy mouthfeel which I always love. Drinkability is good, it's a very good tasting and flavorful stout."
"D - the unified taste and light feel make it quite drinkable."
"This is a wonderful stout -- came back to it after several years away, and now I regret the hiatus! Much preferred over the Rogue Mocha Porter."
"D: Everything here was good, but for some reason it just really wasn't drawing me back for more."
"Four years later, this is still perfect."
"Instantly my my fav Rogue brew."
"- Overall another fantastic stout... I must say that Rogue does make the best stouts.. always consistent and always flavorful while being able to maintain the style."
"Really great appearance. Rich and dark. Nose has some the standard stout stuff, but a nice slightly sweet balance as well. Great stout flavor. All the right combination of components. Really pure and pristine. Tastes like what a stout should be. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"Slainte."
"Pours thick and heavy with a solid black body, a large bubbly tan head, which fades quickly leaving a thin creamy layer, and medium carbonation. The aroma a full of roasted malts, light coffee, some notes of peat and mild milk chocolate. The taste has lots of rich bitter chocolate with strong espresso from the heavy roasted malts, and some really earthy soil (in a good way) flavours. It leaves a bitter lasting aftertaste just like a good espresso. Full bodied with a heavy creamy mouthfeel and a very noticeable carbonation. Great beer. Definitely one for people into their heavy bitter stouts."
"This beer poured black with a fine two finger head. Nose is of chocolate/coffee roasted malts. Taste is a delight, a perfect balance between the roasted chocolate malts and a generous portion of Cascade hops with hints of coffee. Mouthfeel medium bodied but is very creamy and lively. Overall drinkability is great. I have been dissapointed with the change in taste with beers on nitro-tap but this one did not dissapoint!"
"It's not the best oatmeal stout I've ever had -- and I can't say it really breaks any boundaries -- but it's solid and quite drinkable."
"Excellent overall. Something Sir John Falstaff would have enjoyed for sure."
"A very good stout!"
"I tend to get full after about two pints, but I can usually squeeze in a third."
"An oatmeal variant of their famous - and highly rated - Shakespeare Stout, which is one of my faves. It pours a beautiful opaque near-midnight black with a thick, fine-bubbled, persistent dark tan head. Strong aroma is richly of fine coffee and quality chocolate, very tempting. Flavor is like a fine mocha, quality roast coffee and good chocolate, not too sweet, hints of molasses. Texture is smooth, tingly and fizzy, leaving a slightly sweet and very pleasing finish. A must for stouties!"
"Pours out pitch black with a nice two finger, very dark tan head that retains very well and leaves a medium coat of lacing. The ring and cloud on the beer is very thick and makes for a very nice looking beer. Smell has notes of coffee, oatmeal, roast malts, cocoa and some hops. The balance is nice but the strength could be better. Taste is much of the same with the better strength. The roasty malts and coffee cocoa notes are very nice. The oatmeal is amazing in this beer and lends that unique sweetness. There are some earthy and piney hops that finish off a very good balanced taste. The mouthfeel should be better for an oatmeal stout. The body feels a tiny bit watery. The carbonation is low-medium and feels nice with the flavors. The oatmeal smoothness is nice but the watery body needs to be thickened. A coat of hops and roast malt stays on the tongue. Very drinkable beer. Rogue offers good beers at great prices. The taste is very nice. One of the better oatmeal stouts I have had. Need to up the body."
"D: high it tastes alot bigger than six percent so I could put some bombers down. one tasty brew but form rogue I would not expect anything less."
"Pours black in color with a darkly tanned head. Little bit of lacing is found on the glass and head has but minor powers of retension. Nose is a full mixture of citrus hops and sweet chocolate. Taste is fairly bitter upfront from a combo of burnt grain, hops and strong black coffee. Faintly picking up on yeast and a bit of sweetness in the taste as the beer reaches room temperature. Medium to low carbonation with a medium to light feel. Overall decent with an unexpected amount of citrus hops evident."
"Skimmed through some other reviews - apparently this is quite hoppy when it is fresh, but goes downhill fairly quick. However, since there's no bottle dating it's hard to know what one is going to get. I'll re-review if I see it on-tap."
"D - A fantastic stout that if you share out of a 22 oz. like me will leave you begging for more."
"D - A fine stout from Rogue, although I found the bitterness to be just a bit too obtrusive and sharp. The flavor was very good but its assertive bitter character meddled with the balance of the stout overall."
"Never save Shakespeare!"
"D- I killed the bomber by myself and I could easily drink a couple more. The low ABV allows this. Not GREAT overall, but I will def purchase this one again."
"D: For me, Shakespeare Stout is the definition of drinkability. Obviously we're not talking a thirst quencher that you're going to turn to to sate your thirst. What we're talking is a beautiful work of art that you're going to enjoy several pints of on a quiet evening, relishing life's simple pleasures. Not that this is a simple beer, but you get my meaning."
"D - Good drinkability. Lower ABV. Roasted flavors might be overwhelming for some after a few."
"D – As I said, good but not great."
"Very dark aroma, look and flavor. Excellent stout."
"D- Goes down really smooth. A real pleasure throughout the drink... and that alcohol is low enough to allow for consumption of the entire bomber without any major inebriating effects."
"I've had this several times in the bottle but never on tap, yet my opinion of it stays the same. This is just a very well crafted American Stout with lots of full flavors and a smooth, easy drinking body. Bottle or draft, this is probably my favorite beer from Rogue and one that I would never turn down."
"Drinkability: Great drinkability and well carbonated. Nice balance of hops and malt but not too heavy as some stouts tend to be."
"At 6.00% ABV, this is about as drinkable as this style gets. The best aspects of this beer are the roasted, melted-chocolate aroma and the relatively easygoing drinkability. For this time of the year, it's about as good as it gets, even if you want to down the whole bottle by yourself!"
"Overall, I think this beer is highly overrated as there are plenty of other, better options in this arena around this price. I would still buy it again if the selection is poor but I have lots to choose from in my area."
"This is a great beer to enjoy with a steak on a cold day. Luckily, I currently have all three, great beer - snow - and a juicy KC strip!"
"D-its crisp finish and wonderfully balanced, complex taste make this beer highly drinkable and is one of the finest example of stouts around IMO"
"Overall, I'm really impressed with this stout. A very well crafted stout. Simple, yet refined. Complex, yet approachable. Great stuff."
"D another good session beer from Rouge, not lacking in any areas and well worth trying with out doubt"
"D: Incredible, low ABV and gigantic flavor make this brew an absolute pleasure to drink."
"D: I can't believe it took me so long to have this one! I had passed it over time and again. I'm glad I got it on tap, I'll be sure to pick up bombers of this one in the future as it is a well blended and damn tasty brew."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied but very silky. Drinkability was good and it didn't fill me up as other stouts tend to do. A great example of an American Stout."
"Notes: I am really impressed with this beer which is not my favorite style and, frankly, the brewer is not my favorite either."
"While I have never tried this side-by-side. this beer reminds me quite a bit of Stone 12th Anniversary Bitter Chocolate Oatmeal Stout."
"BIg chocolate aroma mixed with floral hops. Pours pure black with a thick, rocky brown head. Loses some points because the head dissipates a little too quickly for a stout. Tastes of bitter hops with chocolate and roasted malts. A bit thin on the palate but the carbonation is pleasant. Lingering chocolate and bitter finish. This is a pretty damn good stout but it leaves a bit of room for improvement."
"Pours a dark near-black with a fluffy light brown head with excellent retention. Mild spotty lacing. Taste and aroma are dark chocolate and roasted malts with hints of cocoa and roasted coffee - a bit of that dark chocolate bitterness lingers on that back of the tongue. Carbonation is mild with an overall smooth, full mouthfeel. Typical stout drinkability."
"M/D: The beer had a medium feel to it, went down pretty easy, carbonation felt right and the beer was pretty easy to drink. Over a good stout, but I have had better, but I will be drinking this one again."
"D - I'm very impressed by this Stout! A very well crafted American Stout, one that all other stouts should be measured by. If you haven't tried this yet...get out there and buy a bottle. You will not be disappointed."
"Poured from a 1 pt 6 oz bottle into a pint glass. A medium pour leaves a thick milk chocolate colored head. It's pitch black with a bit of red tint on top. Big time lacing with this thing. There's a slight scent of chocolate and an almost woody smell. Alcohol is present, but not overpowering. Tastewise, this has a nice hit of smoke up front and then surprises with an almost fruity flavor on the back. What a surprising treat. Good stuff! This is super smooth for a stout. The drinkability is high on this, which could lead to trouble for me. Highly recommended."
"Pours a very dark, mostly opaque brown with a two finger golden brown head. Aromas of chocolate primarily with some hints of citrus blending in. Taste is definitely the roasted malts and chocolate though I thought I detected a bit of a metallic zing at the very end (not sure what that was about). Very nice feel for a stout carbonation was not over abundant and the hops added some oiliness on the finish. Overall a very good, drinkable beer."
"Happy New Year!"
"Pours a dark brown color. 2 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, and a hint of herbs. Fits the style of an American Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, slight hop, yeast, and slight sweet malt. Overall, a great appearance that set the table for the rest of the beer, which is followed by a good blend, body, and mouth feel."
"D- Highly drinkable due to the great mouthfeel, taste and 6% ABV. I could drink this all day and be very happy."
"Pours an opaque black color underneath of a full, creamy, brown head. An aroma of sweet and grainy malt gently flow from the froth. The drink is very similar packed full of a smooth roasted flavor. The body is heavy with low carbonation levels causing the drink to flow slowly and coating the palate with the velvety brew. The finish fades ever so slowly with a sweeter toffee flavor leaving a longing for another sip."
"M + D: For a beer brewed with rolled oats, I would have expected more creaminess in the body. That said, it still has a plenty of body and the mouthfeel certainly isn't bad in the least, so I can't bring myself to take marks on a point that is being influenced by something I feel could be suggestive. It's an excellent stout, doesn't go over the top with alcohol, heavy body, or so forth... but it offers an excellent flavour, and great balance."
"Wow! This is amazing. Black body with tan head. Rich dark chocolate and coffee aroma with taste to follow. Complex and rich in perfect balance. There's all sorts of stuff going on here. Molasses, toffee, pumpernickel, the works. This is the best stout I've had."
"D= Very drinkable with its low ABV (compared to some of its compadres). I could see this as a good session stout."
"Overall, from the somewhat limited amount of Rogue products I've had, this one is the best to date. The balance is superb; not too sweet and not too dry. An excellent stout and highly recommended."
"One really positive note, the head retention amazed me down to the last drop. One little swirl and the beer was blanketed with a nice layer of khaki colored foam. If lacking in taste, this beer has some great visual appeal."
"Pours straight black with a nice full tan head that doesn't last as long as I wish. The head does leave nice lacing behind though. Smellsof dark roasted coffee and a touch of chocolate as well. This beer tastes of roasted coffee with some light hints of chocolate. Has a bit of sweet licoricy finish. Though it's not a favorite of mine, it's still a very solid stout."
"At first, I didn't like it, because it was NOT syrupy and like drinking coffee-flavored motor oil. Perhaps, this was because we had been talking about Dark Lord for a bit. But now that I think about it, I think I was too quick to rush a judgment. What struck me most was the mouthfeel, which was smooth and almost watery, as opposed to the thick viscosity of the russian imperial style stouts. But perhaps, because it's not one of those hit you in the face stouts, it makes for a more drinkable beverage, like I could have more than one glass. Likewise, the roasted malt flavors and coffee-ness are more subdued, I think I even got a bit of dark chocolate in there too, but it doesn't coat your tongue or leave a lasting coffee bitterness. All in all, I'd like to try this again and I won't shy away from buying it next chance I get."
"A pleasantly solid example of the style, offering the expected silken bearing, as well as the well-rounded flavour, if not the weight or ABV, of a much bigger beer. I'm sure the ol' bard would have appreciated this one."
"There is definitely a chunk of yeast on the bottom of the bottle and this beer is alive. Kudos the Rogue for including the ingredients. There are several types of malts, including crystal and chocolate. The beer uses Cascade hops, along with oats and wheat. The latter two are interesting in this beer. The oats create the slightly watery but ultra smooth and creamy feel in the beer, while the wheat adds a bit of pricklishness in the mouthfeel to balance out against the silky oats. The beer is definitely more dry than sweet, with a biting and bittering dark chocolate finish, with some coffee roasted notes in there too. The charred dark roast lingers into the aftertaste and the beer is substantial yet warming. The ABV is well hidden. This is a nice, dark, slightly bittering dryish stout, with a bit of cocoa powder coming in at the very end. It's a fairly complex beer worth seeking out."
"Poured inky black with a towering dark brown head. Thick rings of lace appear as the head slowly shrinks down. The smell is bold to say the least, big chocolate and coffee notes with CC cookies and hops. Wow! Big time flavor here, darkest chocolate-bitter even, with roasted coffee bean and sugary black malt. Brown sugar too and a small molasses kick, rounded out with a bitter punch from the semi-sweet chocolate and alpha acids in the hops. Robustly hoppy for the style and it only adds that much more to the beer. Insanely thick and vicious mouthfeel one could chew on for hours at a time. A remarkable beer, one of the finest examples in existence and a must try for any serious connoisseur. Another one of the beers that got me started, I'll always go back to this one. Has all the character of the higher abv examples. Just on feel and flavor alone if I didn't know better I would think this beer was 9% not 6%."
"Overall - A incredibly well balanced and drinkable stout... recommended..."
"You get a smooth, robust and chewy drinking experience with this one."
"Notes - A very good plain stout. Probably would compete with SN Stout for my go to regular stout."
"D- Fairly high. I' have a second if I had it. Very good beer, another winner from Rogue."
"In case I didn't say it enough, this is surprisingly good, for Rogue."
"Overall, I have a feeling I won't be able to finish this, and if I do it will take me several hours. This beer doesn't flow at all. Maybe I got a bad bottle, in which I will reevaluate next time I drink it, but this beer isn't very good at all. I can't recommend this even in the slightest way."
"The taste is smooth, toasty-fruitiness with hints of singed herbs, light hint of burnt caramel, stewed prunes, licorice, hint of chocolate. It is smooth but zesty and lively with slight oiliness giving a nice feel that is solid yet not heavy and still fairly engaging. It has light swetness to a dryish, slightly creamy finish. When too cold, the finish and lingering aftertaste are lop-sidedly bitter, but if warmed, the finish is balanced and dry yet creamy, leaving a lingering afteraste of coffee/caramel candies with toastiness."
"Drinkability: Not the most complex stout, but the flavors here are as pronounced as I have had in any beer. I will look for this again, but only one at a time. A very solid offering."
"D: A highly drinkable stout; I think this should be called their ""Chocolate Stout"" instead because of the strong chocolate theme throughout."
"Drinkability: I rate this stout well in this department. I could drink a couple of these while still enjoying it. I'll be buying this one again."
"enjoy cheers!"
"Drinkability: I probably had my first one of these 12 years ago now. It obviously blew me away then, but it holds up well. Different due to the hoppiness, but very tasty. Lowish abv makes it possible to down the bomber easily. Didnt think I would end up rating this one so high, but its just great, and a decent value too."
"The drink itself is terrific. The rich characteristics of the beer make it a real treat. It is bold and very creamy. Great beer."
"Delicious and moderate alcohol content. That, along with my devotion to delicious black coffee, I find it to be extremely drinkable."
"D - the smell is inviting but the taste does not follow through as well as I hoped. It's still a decent stout."
"uscaptainsblog.blogspot.com"
"Drinkability: A fine example of the style. Another home run from Rogue."
"I like a good bitter beer, stones ruination ipa and their imperial russian stout. dogfish heads 120. Even rogues imperial ipa. All of those are very different from this beer and there's just something about it I am not quite thrilled about... otherwise a good beer, though i think it may be overated."
"D-I think the drinkability is rather high. Its not too strong, despite the catagory, but maintains a superior tastiness throughout that makes you want to have another. I would like to think of this brew as getting the best of the stout world without HAVING to get shitfaced in the process. But if you do, I don't think I'd blame ya..."
"One shade below black with an enormous head of light-tan foam. The head retention is incredible and keeps a decent layer of foam covering the surface of the beer and the sides of the glass. The aroma features a strong roasted malt character with a dark chocolate undertone and a bit of a citrusy American hop. It's good but could be stronger and a bit more polished. The flavor starts with the roasted malt flavors and a hint of coffee then gradually slips into the softer dark chocolate notes. Eventually it finishes with a resinous hop character that slowly drys the palate and leaves me wanting more. This, coupled with a nice amount of carbonation provides for a pretty good mouthfeel. At first, I felt this one was too rough around the edges but as it warmed it definitely improved and everything seemed to blend quite nicely. A damn good stout that's worth trying at least once but one that I could definitely see in my regular rotation. Not my favorite but it's up there."
"D- Really nice stout that isn't overpowering."
"D: another bomber im glad to be not sharing."
"D: A wise choice at any time. This isn't to strong or weak in any spectrum - very well balanced."
"Find it, drink it, and enjoy it."
"Overall just a great drinker, really nice and roasty and dry and balanced to perfection."
"I throughly enjoyed this one. Glad its always available at my local stop!"
"This beer pours as black as night with a one finger cappicino laced head,it has aromas of bittersweet chocolate and on smell it smells like a perfectly balanced stout between sweet and bitter,it has a nice dense mouthfeel with a big oat driven feel first up then the palette is balanced out by a rather hoppy bittersweet mellow chocolate aftertaste to really not make this beer as sweet as it sounds on its description on the back of the bottle,i really like this beer and once again im stoked that this brewery continues to send its brew's to our shores Thanks Rogue."
"one of the best beers I had by rogue and thats pretty legit cause all thier beers are wonderful"
"Overall, This beer was a good all around stout. Good aromas and a delicious pallate. Too bad this isn't offered in 6 packs around here."
"D- Pretty nice stout with a decent flavor. Worth getting again."
"Poured a very dark brown with a moderate head that faded to a collar. The aroma was coffee and chocolate. The taste not so sweet, but bitter black coffee and dark, semi-sweet chocolate. Mouth feel was medium to full bodied with fairly minimal carbonation. Drinkability was good, 6.00 ABV a plus in this category. Reminded me of SN's stout."
"Definitely worth a try!"
"D: For a stout it goes down well. It's not a dessert beer, so I'm not chugging it for the sugary taste, but it definitely drinks well for the style."
"Overall the cask version seemed to have a lot more hops in the aroma and flavor than I remembered from the bottle version. Even without the hops the malt bill is fantastic enough to make this worth a shot."
"Drinkability: possibly a little *too* drinkable."
"D: i'll drink again without hesitation!"
"Drinkability: Very, very good stout. Best stout I've had and highly recommended. I'd get this any chance I can."
"Drinkability: Very tasty!! A great stout and another great beer from Rogue. Highly recommended!!"
"An easy drinker that will have you opening more than one bomber bottle. Enjoy!"
"Drinkability - 4.5/5.0 - way better than a Guiness - very tasty, smooth - I will be repeating this beer."
"Dark black color with a nice cloudy looking head. The head sticks well to the glass and the color is beige. The aroma is dark chocolate with some roasted malts. I get also some hints of licorice. Very light licorice however. The taste is similar to the smell. Very good. Too easy to drink. Medium body. The taste stays in the mouth slightly... not overpowering. I would prefer that it stays longer. The bitterness is light. A very harmonious beer, a rich beer. The carbonation is felt in the mouth."
"Kind of disappointed with this one. Mostly roasted bitter coffee. A little dark chocolate around the middle. Many better stouts out there. Some bitter astringency on the finish. I'll pass on this next time. I thought this would be much better based on the reviews and the fact that I really enjoy the Chocolate Stout and the Hazelnut Brown."
"I don't know if I got a bad bottle or just an off day as far as taste goes, but this beer did not match previous reviews. Will try again soon."
"After being unimpressed by a Rogue Dead Guy Ale a couple years back, I had not bothered to try another Rogue offering, until now. This Shakespeare Stout will not emerge as one of my favorites, but it has at least convinced me to try other Rogue offerings in the future. After trying this brew, I was shocked to find that it contained oats. It just did not seem akin to other oatmeal-ish stouts (which I tend to like). The pour produced a strong, medium-to-dark shiny, foamy and persistent head. So far, so good. The smell struck me as predominantly coffee and not especially complex as stouts go. The taste seemed more like that of Irish dry stouts, like Guinness, sharp and heavy on the roasted barley, but absent was the rounded, slightly sweet and chewy richness from the oats. Things were better in the mouthfeel department, where the oats made an appearance to provide this stout with a good, creamy sensation and a pleasant, malty aftertaste. What lingers on the tongue, however, was a return to the coffee flavors. This was not a plus for me, since I am not a coffee drinker otherwise. There was more of a hops presence, which is to be expected with a brew that is described as an ""American"" stout. Don't drink this if you are seeking a more malty, rounded, English-style brew. For me, I did not dislike it, but I am not likely to seek it out in the near future. My tasting was an isolated experience; it would be interesting to taste this side-by-side with other micro-brew stouts."
"Just take 100 bucks and bye about 15 bombers for the next couple of months as this isn't a serious session beer anyway.. it's too dam^ flavorful and chewy to session."
"D- I would drink this everyday if it wasn't so expensive. This is one of my favorite beers, ever."
"The initial taste is full of the roasted malt and grain with some of the bittersweet or dark chocolate and cocoa coming in towards the end. I can pick up a few coffee undertones after a few sips too. The beer is damn smooth and creamy and has a small amount of carbonation going on. This stout has a light to medium body and very rich. I'd say this stout has such a high drinkability. A bomber of this would be easily be finished in a night's session by myself."
"This beer poured an inky black with a single-finger dark tan head. The smell is deeply toasted malt with a strong sweet molasses and chocolate backbone with a bit of imperial stout-style coffee in there as well. The taste starts off with some milk chocolate that goes into some bittersweet chocolate and coffee flavor with a bit of a bitter bite that doesn't stick around long. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation. I had no problem drinking this beer, and I will most definitely be picking it up again sometime."
"D - This stout definitely tastes better cold than warm. As it warmed, it became almost too bitter. Still, a very enjoyable stout. I just need to drink it faster. :-)"
"Poured into a Guinness imperial pint glass. Beer is pitch black and forms a frothy, tan colored head. Nose is roasted malts, cocoa, and molasses. Taste is dominated by a roasted bitterness and unsweetened cocoa or dark chocolate. Well balanced and easy to drink. Appropriate carbonation with a medium to full body. Finish is dry with a touch of bitterness."
"bitter and astringent mouthfeel that's surprisingly... welcome. good drinkability other than the bitterness."
"D: Excellent dessert beer. Enough uniqueness to hunt this one down."
"Appearance a very dark brown. Only hints of light shine through. very fickle two finger head. Good ammount of chocolate malt in the taste. The mouthfeel is a tiny bit watery but very relaxing to drink. I've had this before and I'll have it again. One of Rogue's strongest beers."
"While a fine offering on its own, this sonnet is perhaps best served cold. However, it will also compliment any beef dish."
"Very drinkable for the style. It is well-balanced between sweetness and bitterness. It never gets too carried away but there's enough in there for everyone to enjoy."
"Not quite first rate for me, but very good."
"Pours nice thick dark brown, big mocha head with excellent retention. Smells rich, and some excellent aroma hoppage going on. Taste is super-smooth, very rich despite having the texture and viscosity of milk. Silky. Nice hop afterflavor helps part aside the deep dark malt. More chocolatey and hoppy than anything else. Can be a bit much to drink a lot of, but still quite excellent."
"A very good stout from Rogue that is very drinkable. Really enjoyable and the quality is always there. Great beer."
"Pours black with a tan head. Very light aroma, but a touch of chocolate. Flavors of coffee, chocolate, and roasted malt. Flavor is nice and rich with a great mouth feel. Feels velvety on the tongue. Very enjoyable overall. This is definitely one of my favorites!"
"Full bodied, and with a soft carbonation this is a milky, creamy stout. Good drinkability"
"22 oz bomber brown bottle obtained at Mckinnon's Meat Market. black in color with a 1/4 inch of dark beige head that sadly didn't last long. the scent of chocolate is there at first sniff, a little bit of oatyness. citrusy, earthy quality from the oats, nice chocolatey after taste from the chocolate malts. thick and smooth mouthfeel. one sip invites another in and it goes down smoother than one would think."
"Wonderful!"
"D - This is packed with flavour and so much so that it is almost hard to drink. It is a beer that is worth drinking but one is most definitely enough."
"Drinkability: 6% ABV makes this a very easy going stout. My glass was gone before I knew it, even though I was attempting to take my time. A very nice example of an American Stout."
"D: A delicate stout. 6% abv is a nice treat. This is what i'd call a great pub stout. You want a nice beverage, but you don't want to be overwhelmed."
"Poured a thick black with a two-finger tan head that left spider lacing all down glass. A woody, burnt malt smell with a mix of caramel, dark chocolate malt. Real smooth and creamy with a balance between sweet and dry. Pleasant mix of bitter chocolate with some roasted and possibly coffee malt. Minor hop bitterness on the very backend, although the malts do the talking. Low ABV makes this a possible session, but 1 bottle was filling for me."
"D - This beer isn't as heavy as you would expect... and with an ABV of 6% makes this beer very drinkable...Rogue hit the nail on the head with this one...what a great stout!"
"Notes: I don't often review a beer twice simply because I had it via a different delivery (e.g. bottle vs. on-tap), but the experience on the nitro-tap was significantly different and so I made an exception in this case. Viewing my bottle review, I see that I felt the nitro tap added to the experience, resulting in some bumped-up scores for this one. Very enjoyable."
"Overall, this is one of the best stouts I've tried. Great balance and drinkability, and terrific flavor."
"D - Overall a great example of the style. Not exorbitant in flavor, easy to drink, and very sessionable as I finished a 22 and I feel fine. I will have to compare all other stouts versus this one now."
"Overall a really enjoyable brew. I was very pleased."
"On cask at Elmer Sudds. Arrived in a nonic pint glass and appears just about pitch black with a good inch of creamy dark ecru foam. The foam stays with me till the glass is empty, leaving a sticky lace in it's wake. Awesome looking pour. Smells and tastes of rich roasted grains, coffee beans, both milk and bitter chocolate, molasses, bitter, somewhat citrusy hops. Somewhere between medium and full bodied, with creamy and ample carbonation. Smooth drinking and satisfying."
"This one earns the word ""stout"" in its namesake, it is in fact the very definition of the word. You should see a picture of this bottle when you look the word up in the dictionary. This set the benchmark. I've had many a great stouts since I first tried Shakespeare Stout but I still consider this one of my favourite of them all. A stout by any other name is not as sweet..."
"On the palate this ale is big and roasty, full flavored, with ample hops to stand up to the roasty flavors. Finishes bitter, but bitter in a good way."
"I could easily drink a couple of these. Not a session beer, though."
"D= Very high. This beer is delicious and highly recommended. It's a great stout for someone who doesn't like larger stouts and would prefer a more toned down balanced and delicious stout. This is right up there with the yeti as my favorite American stout."
"Dark brown or light black in color with moderate prickle so that the beer resembles cola in the glass. Very light head and a malty nose with hints of chocolate roasted into the flavor and texture. Fresh and light attack with the roasted coffee and chocolate towards the front end and the bitter towards the finish. The finish is pretty crisp and leaves a little bitter in the aftertaste."
"D - A pretty good stout. Maybe a touch too roasty to make it great but something I would drink again in a heartbeat."
"There is a lot to admire about this brew, but I think as a matter of personal preference I like my stouts a little smoother and sweeter. I detect perhaps some ""over-roasting"" has taken place in the barley, nearly a ""burnt"" taste. A little too much cascade hops for the style might have pushed this out of my taste preference. I really like some Rouge beers, but something feels a little wrong about this one."
"Due to the deliciosity of this artwork of a stout it is highly drinkable, and I mean that in every possible sense."
"Poured as a dark black ale with lots of sticky chocolate tinged head. Head has duration and left plenty of lacing down the glass. Smell is of roasted malts and dark coffees. Taste is of a full, rich bittersweet chocolate, accompanied by distinct coffee been flavor. Leaves a coffee like aftertaste for a few minutes. One of the better stouts I have tried."
"Overall: A good beer...worth a try. Cheers!"
"Highly drinkable, had a very smooth finish."
"Fairly drinkable, but I wish it had a touch more sweetness and balance."
"Out of bomber this beer was an opaque black color with a two-finger tan head. The retention was very good and the lacing very good too. The aroma was of roasted malt, coffee, toasted malt, hints of smoke and well-defined chocolate. The flavors were also very good dominated by roasted malt and smoky elements. I also tasted roasted coffee beans, bittersweet chocolate and a dry, long, coffee finish. Not as sweet as some other beers of this style but complex, balanced and totally on-point. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body full and the carbonation medium/low. A classic for a good reason."
"Drinkability is good. Some might not to be able too handle drinking to much of the stout's but not this one. It is easy to go down and stay's down smooth."
"Overall, a good stout. Comparable in style to Storm King, but not quite at that level, IMO. Would not mind drinking again."
"D: A good stout with a complex flavor profile but misses due to the massive hoppiness. I like most of Rogue's ales but love very few of them."
"Extremely high. Probably the most smoothest stout I've ever drank, you can't go wrong with this brew!!"
"D - For an oatmeal stout it's surprisingly drinkable. I think the bitter/hops flavors offset the extreme malt and balance it well."
"Pours blacker than the blackest night, with a great creamy brown head. Smells of toffee and roasted malt, with a hint of chocolate. Taste is very similar, although it tends to be a bit on the bitter side. Not quite as balanced as I would have liked, but it still goes down fairly smooth. The only reason I knocked down the drinkability score is that it might be overly bitter for the flavors that it imparts in the beginning, But overall this is a fantastic beer."
"The glass came filled with this dark, perhaps light absorbing beer that had a creamy dark brown head that didn't surrender until the end. Several sniffs detected some toffee notes. Several gulps detected toffee and mocha flavors. IT WAS SUPER SMOOTH, an 8.5 out of 10 for smoothness. The taste lingered for a bit and was very appreciated. I will definately have this one again sometime."
"D: A bomber is a great portion for this beer. I look forward to trying this again as a dessert beer. I'll definitely recommend this goody!"
"This is a very drinkable stout--thick but not overpowering."
"Overall, an enjoyable beer on tap, one requiring repeated sessions. Looking forward to consuming it in a bottle again to see if there is a considerable difference."
"D - this was a pretty good stout. I wasn't blown away or disappointed. I would drink this again but wouldn't go out of my way to find it."
"Eric"
"D - Very drinkable although I wish it was less dry in the finish."
"Pitch black with a thick head, caramel colored. some lacing around the sides. smell is all coffee and chocolate. espresso with some bitterness in the nose. taste is rather bitter - bitter burnt coffee taste. some sweetness towards the end, but then back to an abrasive bitterness. beer seems quite raw with the flavors not really blending together smoothly, but rather each one is a separate entity. mouthfeel is well carbonated, some chewiness. body is nice."
"Taste is roasty with a some dark chocolate. I am detecting a little chawkiness, but not bad enough to bother me. Mouthfeel is about right for a stout, being medium with a little creaminess. Great stout that will be had again."
"Very little carbonation, quite smooth."
"Overall it probably is my favorite stout! I'm looking forward to another one!"
"Overall a great beer. Really, really enjoyed this one."
"Delightfully smooth and easy-drinking, this is a superb stout and a wonderful quaff. Superb."
"Man, I could drink this all night. Less ABV than a bigger RIS cousin makes this one drinkable on a high level for me. Full taste, not overpowering but delightful - absolutely top notch stout."
"Good drinkability. Not too rich or high abv lets this one be a good choice all night long. While not exceptional, this is definitely one of the better beers I've had from Rogue."
"D- A great beer which I thoroughly enjoyed and has some interesting differences from other stouts that really sets it apart. I was expecting much more hop flavor, and while there is a good amount, with those citrusy flavors, I didn't think it was overdone. Delicious"
"Poured a bomber into a pint glass. This beer is pitch black, and pours with a large milk chocolate colored head. Decent lacing on the glass. The smell is fantastic. It's nice and strong as well with dark chocolate and coffee. It has a smokey aroma too with a small amount of floral hops. The taste has more coffeeness to it than the smell, but it is not overbearing. The bitterness comes through a second after each sip, but its only strong enough to notice it. Quite a drinkable beer at it's low alcohol content, and I'm a bit sad that I didn't pick up another bomber. One of my favorite beers, and probably the best stout I've had."
"This was a very very easy bomber to put away and look for another. It is a real treat and could become a habitual purchase when available. I know it is year round, but I don't see it year round out here. Buy it when you see it."
"D: moderate ABV and well crafted flavors make this an easy & accessible favorite."
"poured into a pint glass out of 22oz. bomber. pours a dark black with a nice dark tan, almost brownish head that sticks around for a little bit and then fades to a nice foam ring. its completely opaque when held up to the light. although a bit thin in the mouthfeel, i find this to be a rather complex beer. in the nose there is a lot of coffee or almost even a cappucino smell and a huge roasted malt presence. nice and earthy with a little bit of chocolate as well. in the taste you get a lot of roasted malts and chocolate with a nice bitter chocolate finish. a decent creamy taste in the end as well, similar to an oatmeal stout.this beer has a really nice lace on the glass. i really enjoyed this brew, very easy drinking, but packed with tons of complex flavors. if you can find it, get it for sure."
"Poured an opaque cola black with more than two fingers of cappucino-colored head. Looks nice. Smell is malty with roasty grain and coffee and nut notes; fairly subtle. As I sip, I get more of the barley flavors from the nose and some bitter chocolate hoppiness. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I'd have liked. However, I find I really enjoy the drinkability here. At just 6%, this goes down easily. A nice, relatively simple stout that I appreciate even if I don't adore it."
"First thing I notice is not the flavor, but the awesome chewy mouthfeel of this beer. Totally fills your mouth. Remarkable. Taste is great, leaves a ton of roastiness and coffee on the palate. Not sweet, but pretty dry and bitter. Quite simply delicious and not over the top. Subtle carbonation-- just right. I now understand the revered cult status of the Shakespeare Stout."
"It is a mouthful, but it is frothy and delicious, I wish I had bought more than one of these."
"Drinkability- Goes down quite easily for a stout. I'd like to try this pumped with nitro."
"Pours a dark jet black with a nice thick tan head, nice thick lacing. Aroma is hoppy, chocolaty, malty, sweet caramel. Great complexity, rich chocolate flavor with nice sweet caramel notes. Very easy to drink because of the incredible balance and smoothness. Definitely glad I picked this up. Recommended."
"super thick creamy head with a jet black appearance. coffee and dark chocolate with a roasty smell. starts off tasting thin and lacking body but is surprisingly hoppy and finishes very dry and delicious. The bitterness is well appreciated too. Very good stout"
"All in all, a very good stout. The finish is the only thing that really gets me with this one."
"Mouthfeel is somewhat light, but very refreshing. Bubbly and fizzy from the carbonation. Creamy as well, but it suffers a little because it's a tinge watery. Drinkability is great - it's well balanced and easy to drink. The finish is a little bitter, mixed with coffee and chocolate - very nice. Great stout from Rogue."
"One for my favorite beers from the beginning of my beer exploration; it was nice to revisit it after a while and find that it is essentially just as good as I remembered it."
"This has good drinkability cause its not a heavy stout. I would consider doing a session with this"
"Pours a dark brown/black colored body, with a huge head, lasting, brown/light brown in color. Has a very stout-y aroma, coffee, but not much else. Has a coffee taste, and is rich. Somewhat watery. Okay, but not my thing."
"Nice overall, but I didn't care for the nose on this a whole lot."
"Drinkability: Probably the best stout I've ever had. Easy to drink, very smooth, and quite delicious. An excellent beer at any time; before dinner, during, or for dessert."
"It's interesting that Shakespeare Stout, the beer I noted to myself last week that I most wanted to sample from Rogue, was the same beer that both precipitated my grabbing a few others from this terrific Northwest brewery, and the one that I sampled last. Shakespeare Stout certainly embodies the adage ""last but not least," for it is an outstanding stout. I'm amazed that I had yet to try this sterling, hopped-up stout. It won't be long before I grab another one of these beauties from Rogue."
"Recommend to everyone."
"Good brew and one of my top rated beers for style."
"D- Its a solid stout would be really good it it had just a heavier viscosity. The flavors are not overbearing neither is the ABV so definitely session able."
"Overall, a solid American Stout and, as of now, my favorite offering from Rogue."
"Pours pitch black with huge tan head. Great looking stout. Smell - chocolate malts mostly, some cocoa. Taste - dark chocolate as it is, very bitter and chocolaty. Great stuff. Pretty much ideal stout - rich, smooth and easy enough to drink. I'm truly enjoing this one."
"Drinkability is through the roof on this beer, creamy, smooth and satisfying. Pass me another one, please."
"Body is fairly big for a 6% stout. Somewhat smooth without a lot of noticeable carbonation. Not a terribly drinkable beer in my opinion. I will be nursing the rest of this bomber."
"It was great to have a stout that wasn't too heavy on chocolate or coffee. Will happily buy again."
"Pours black as midnight with a thick and creamy tan head. Nice licorice and coffee smell with a hint of backing chocolate and some oat. Very roasty flavor with chocolate, oatmeal, coffee, licorice and a bit of a bitter finish to it all. One of my favorite beers in my younger days, I had a bottle last week that didn't quite live up to my memories but was still better than 90% of the beers I've ever had."
"j"
"This is a great stout. It has an incredibly smooth feel with lots of sudsy, soapy carbonation. There isn't any wateriness in the feel. The bitter hop bite in the finish is just right, not too big, not too small. The malt flavor is creamy, toasty chocolate with an excellent balance of sweet, sour and dough. There is a rather small amount of coffee and other subtle aspects to the flavor. It's a great stout in a category crowded by only good to average examples."
"Future outlook: Especially considering the reviews here and my general fondness for stouts, I am somewhat disappointed in this one. With so many vastly superior stout options so readily available, I'm unlikely to feel compelled to revisit this one anytime soon."
"Drinkability A 22oz bomber is a perfect after dinner sip. I could drink this stuff once a month or once every other month and really look forward to a treat."
"I finished the bottle, but the drinkability was only average."
"(rated Mar 29, 2007)"
"D: The smoothness of the beer makes it very easy to drink. Don't even dare to chug this beer or drink it fast because this beer is too superior to be mistreated like a busch light during a drinking game at a frat party."
"Thick, dark stout. Pours jet black with a minimal brown head. Almost as if it sucks the light of the room into it. Rich, brownie-batter aroma, if yoru brownies were made with dark and baker's chocolate. Very strong chocolate flavors with a bittersweet aftertaste. Nice and hoppy, cascades? Good roasted malt as well. Didn't get ""soy-sauced"" like some others. Really liked this beer."
"This is another fine example of an over hopped, over hyped and overpriced beer from Rogue. Although many may disagree, I feel like their time in the craft beer limelight has come and gone."
"Rogue, I love you! Another great beer from this world class brewery. This one pours a deep black with a beautiful tan head. Head retention is nice, as is lacing. In the nose I smell some oats, coffee with cream, chocolate, nuts, and a nice touch of hops. Flavor is rich, with a lot of chocolate coming through - kind of a cafe mocha thing going on. Also a pretty much perfect amount of hops. The balance here is outstanding. I like that when this beer first hits your palate you're thinking it's going to be a little sweet. Then as it moves forward, it hits you with a lot of chewy, roasted maltiness, then it finishes with a slight citric pucker from the hops. You're left salivating a little and just waiting for your next sip. Very well balanced, very drinkable beer. Love it!"
"the taste is great, i get lots of sweet caramels at first followed some of the more bitter burnt flavors. as everyone states, a great balance one hopes to find in a stout. theres a nice finish of warmth from the alcohol, which i also find very well done with this beer. the mouthfeel is good for a bottle, can only imagine what it would be like on tap. most certainly a session beer, despite the somewhat high alcohol. could drink these all night though."
"Poured black with a big thick tan head with good retention, it was there a while, great lacing throughout the whole pint too. Smelled of oats, maybe a hint of chocolate and coffee also whith a swirl of the glass. Tasted amazing as well. This is a pretty thick bodied beer but it is very drinkable."
"Bottle and Draft"
"D-This is a GREAT F-ING BEER! I really like this one and will surely be enjoying it again in the future. Deep, heavy flavors without becoming to heavy to drink and enjoy and an all-around easily consumed brew."
"the drinkability is pretty great, it's"
"3.4/5"
"Another very good beer from Rogue. The hint of chocolate and coffee had a strong backbone for the malt complex. There was a hint of hops on the finish. I think it could had a little more oomph in the body of the beer but overall it was very nice to drink. Nice Finish and very drinkable"
"D - Unfortunately this followed the chocolate stout. Though good, I'd certainly prefer the predecessor."
"Out of a 22oz. bottle this beer pours a jet black color with a rich creamy dark brown head. About an inch thick. Smell is outstanding and definatly malty and chocolate. Taste is EXCEPTIONAL, chocolate and malt, balanced with a sweet biterness. Definatly a ""go to"" beer in my fridge. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy with medium carbonation. Drinkability is low, as this is a rich beer. I would lOVE to have 5 or 6 of these if I could handle it. Great after dinner or tasting beer."
"This beer becomes even more flavorful as it warms. If you like your darks warm, go with this beer, if you prefer cold go with the Rogue Chocolate Stout. I recommend a Snifter glass for my darks, makes the aroma's explode!"
"Pours a nice dark brown almost black color with a thick, frothy coffe-colored head. Roasted malty aroma with chocolate, oatmel, toffee notes. Dark chocolate roasted maltiness with hints of burnt toast, caramel, nut and toffee. Very quaffable and sweet with slight dry finish."
"i love me some shakespeare stout. i have noticed that alot of people have said that this should be higher up on the top 100 and i completely agree. a fantastic stout. if you see it drink it. you wont be sorry."
"Excellent stout worth trying. Sessionable and not overpowering at all."
"dark thick and lovely. creamy dark brown head dispates slowly and leaves a heavy lacing. a slight hopy and than very chocolatey coffee taste. this beer has a very malty flavor but is sweet and finishes nicely. great stout. this beer has what i call a lot of re-drinkability."
"Pours a very dark brown/black with brown edges, frothy tan head, rings of thick lacing. Smell: roasted malts, oats, hot chocolate. Taste/Mouthfeel: starts creamy and smooth with roasted malts, dry oats, and cocoa, followed by spicy and citric hops, finishes bitter, dry."
"Overall impression: This is good stout, but not in my upper echelon.A"
"Nearly pitch black with a nice whole-wheat-colored head that lasted a good long time while releasing aromas of bread, charcoal and a little bitterness that reminded me of oranges. Being a fan of stouts and porters, I looked forward to trying this beer but was struck by its rather thin body and the higher-than-expected carbonation; the bubbles gave it a bite that I couldn't get used to. Plenty of hops at the back end... a tad too much so that the malt was buried too quickly. The sharp edge was okay, but still I prefer more of a malt presence and fewer IBUs in this style."
"D: Incredibly drinkable. The fact that it isn't too aggressive in any area and has a reasonably low ABV makes it a very easy drink to consume. Gets better and better as it warms up. Really nice stout."
"Final Thought: You definitely get what you pay for with this bad boy. The use of quality ingredients and precision of detail must be used to implement this world class beer. On-tap please!"
"D - A great stout that continues to please"
"Mouthfeel is clean and smooth, easily drinkable."
"Appearance is very good, thick black, one of the few beers I can't see through with a light held up to it. Fantastic. Just a little light on the head and lacing. Smell and taste are very similar. Lots of malted oats up front with bit of nutmeg and dry/bitter chocolate finish. Mouthfeel is wonderful, a bit too carbonated for a stout is my only qualm. But medium in body and swallow quite nicely."
"Drinkability: I was not too crazy about it, won't be trying it again. Roast, bitter chocolate, coffee. All there is here and moving on..."
"Very easy drinking beer with an apparent bitterness, yet balanced by the chocolate malt, quite enjoyable."
"D-Would want to try a fresher one, this one sat for about 6 months."
"Overall a tremendous stout that I will definetly buy again."
"This beer poured very very dark with a 1/2 inch head that is dark as well. Lots of chocolate and roasted grains to the nose with some hints of coffee. Taste is pretty consistent with the aroma. Lots of chocolate and bitter malts. Very bitter aftertaste. Overall mouthfeel is smooth and a very enjoyable beer."
"This beer is an easy beer to consume at only 6% and has good mouthfeel and excellent texture. The beer is almost like drinking a dark IPA."
"Sent from my Verizon Wireless BlackBerry"
"Aroma is full of roasted grain, with fresh floral hop aromas overlaying. Interesting, the hop element brings another dimensin to this rich brew that is otherwise dominated by bitterness from roasted malts. Expected flavors of dark roast coffee, espresso in the finish, but lots of fruitiness up front. Excellent and very drinkable stout."
"Mighty fine stout. Aroma of roasted burnt malt, coffee, and hops! Jet black pour with a medium dark brown head and some lacing. Velvety smooth mouthfeel this one slowly slides down the gullet with a bitter hop finish incredibly good. Nice rich flavor aside from the roasted malts there is a strong coffee presence along with some chocolate and toffee flavors. A mild smokiness comes about which is unexpected and well received. What's fantastic about this stout is the enormous hop presence, bitter biting and right in line the hops really round out this great brew. Nicely brewed."
"Wow... Rogue has outdone itself, such a nice change from the average(aka crappy) college party beers ie. budbudlightkeystonemillerbusch... blah blah blah"
"For me, this is a good stout, but not quite great. Easily quaffable and certainly will drink again, but the price tag limits this one to just a bomber or two per year for me."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth. Not a ton of carbonation. It's also not really heavy either. Pretty good drinkability."
"D: It's so good that I wouldn't want more than 1 in a sitting, and it would take forever to finish more than one. If your looking for a beer on a cold night look into this gem!"
"Thanks to Northyorksammy for this great beer!"
"Pours almost black with a nice tan head. Excellent retention and lacing. Aroma is of roasted malts and coffee. Body is medium with some carbonation. Taste is a roasted mix of malts dark chocolate and coffee. Well balanced and smooth as silk. Excellent."
"This is one of the best stouts I've ever had. Damn."
"D: Very unique brew, never had a Stout with this much hops and I gotta say, I enjoyed it! Rogue has another solid winner here, maybe not the best stout ever, but one you gotta try to get a feel for how far the style can stretch. Find this brew and give Will's bottle a try!"
"You know, I've had this stout before, but not for several years. I usually pass it while looking for something ""extar special"" at the bottle shop. Boy am I stupid. Something I see reguarly tastes AWESOME. Say what you will about hopped up stouts. But this is delicious. Don't be foolish about style constraints."
"M+D-- thought it would be thicker than it is but it is still a touch creamy...making it very drinkable and easy going...can finish a whole bomber easily and then some.."
"Overall, a quality beer that doesn't disappoint. Don't pass this one up if you see it on the shelves."
"D: Huzzah!"
"D: This would be on the upper level of ABV for drinkability for me, but I could probably have more than one of these. This is a pretty fair stout, and tastes nice. A little hoppy, but not overly hopped. Nice beer all around."
"Eh, I was hoping for more here, especially from something with such high reviews. I liked the Chocolate Stout quite a bit more, and I think the added sweetness did it for me. I've heard the two are almost the same beer."
"I poured a 22 ounce bomber into my SA pint glass. This is one dark beer. It pours pitch black and as I hold it up to a light there is no translucence. It has an attractive tan head, lots of lacing. There are hints of coffee, chocalate and a light malty sweetness on the nose. The taste pretty much follows, very well balanced. The finish is dry and a hint of bitterness. A solid medium body with fair carbonation. This beer is very drinkable. A great stout by any standard."
"D: plenty of these could be drank in one sitting. However it is not as complex or bold as hoped, but very drinkable nonetheless"
"Wonderful proper ale, recommended!"
"M/D: Carbonation is a little high, but the body is mostly smooth and a little silky. Really nice drinkability, really nothing wrong with this one. An excellent representation of the style."
"D - At 6%, rich and hoppy, one bomber is plenty. It is a complex example of the style, and bigger than its strength would indicate. Also noted, the bitterness of this stout really stays with you."
"Drinkability is moderate. Flavor is ok, and alcohol is fairly low making for easy drinking. I'm disappointed with this beer though, and the body is too thin. This beer is really average, I'm shocked it rates so high."
"A: Thick cottony head that clings to the side of the glass, deep chocolate brown with a smidgeon of light that passes through at the edges, an impressive start to the beer - 5.00, S: Deep aromas of chocolate and espresso, more of a cocoa smell, a subtle earthy edge, the aroma is extremely inviting - 4.50, T: Reminds me of drinking powdered chocolate milk that hasn't yet been fully mixed into the milk, the pleasing part of coffee grounds, dry and hoppy most notably on the tail of the beer - 4.50, M: A touch grainy - 4.50, D: All around an exceptional beer, one of the finest examples of stout I've had - 4.50"
"D - This is one of the best tasting stouts I've had the pleasure of drinking."
"Good stout. Pours dark brown - decent head, not much retention. Smell is not too strong - some chocolate and malts. Taste is slightly underwhelming, but I'm used to Imperial Stouts. It is a clear, refreshing and very enjoyable drink, overall. I'd like to try their Chocolate Stout - its at my local place, so that's next."
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, I like the fact that this beer isn't as sweet as most stouts are and even though I think this is a solid beer, I've definitely had better stouts than this one."
"Cheers."
"Very enjoyable and well-crafted. An easy drinker, especially at 6%."
"one of the best stouts i've ever had, its something to legit look forward to relaxing with after a hard day."
"Great brew, very rich in aroma and flavor. Like that hoppy surprise at the end."
"EDIT: As the beer warms up, the mouthfeel get's better and soe does the flavour."
"M&D- Too light and watery for my tastes but it is quite quaffable. Almost as thirst-quenching as spring water."
"Pours black with a really nice tan head. There is nothing wrong with the way this beer looks in a glass. The aroma is pretty dissappointing; Notes of smokey malts gives way to bitter chocolate the more it warms up. The taste is diluted dark chocolate. Dissapointing, watery mouthfeel."
"Overall: Very complex for a stout. An absolutely epic brew."
"Drinkablity it outstanding. Taste is outstanding. Drinking this you would think it is an RIS if it wasn't for the low ABV. First time that I have tried this. Not sure what took me so long."
"Overall: totally solid stout"
"Medium carbonation with a bitter long lasting aftertaste. Drinks like an imperial stout without the higher ABV. Almost a session beer that would be great on a cold winter day."
"Drinkability: A pretty filling brew. I was hungry when I started drinking it, and half-way through I'm already getting full. An absolutely outstanding stout, and if my stomach weren't so puny I'd be drinking this puppy regularly. Smooth, complex, delicious!"
"D : A great stout on nitro. One of the easiest drinking ones I have ever had."
"Drinkability: Abv% is obviously completely manageable and nowhere to be found in the taste. I've had this a few times before on tap, and it's just a really well-balanced, easy drinking stout - one of the better ones I've enjoyed."
"drinkability- at $66.00 a case this is a bargain in my mind....Chimay brand can have it's $150.00 a case nose into the air but must look at the kid kicking it in the shins...enjoy"
"D-- a wonderfully balanced stout.. another please"
"D - Excellent stout... Highly enjoyable... I typically enjoy slightly sweeter porters/stouts, but for a bitter one this one is right up there..."
"M,D. There is a decent amount of carbonation that leaves the mouthfeel nice and the lightness leaves the drinkability decent as well"
"Pretty good but it didn't really live up to my expectations. I think I just don't like their Pacman yeast strain or something. It always seems to have some funky taste that I can't put my finger on."
"Very good stout, could definitely see having another. A nice array of flavor and yes, the lacing reached the bottom."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy. It has a big powerful taste but it drinks so easily. It almost goes down like milk but with a completely clean finish. I ended up drinking about a pint of this bottle and it is the middle of summer and I was in a hot tub--I don't really see how anybody wouldn't be able to get through a bomber of this on their own at any time of the year, because I am not even a huge stout fan and this was fantastic. Who needs a 13% ABV russian imperial stout when you can drink something like this?"
"smooth and creamy. fluffy carbonation."
"drinkability - Not that of a beer, enjoyed it, Rogue makes good beers."
"I was a little disappointed with this beer, I was hoping for the coffee and cocoa notes to be more present."
"D: Not too bad, it kinda wears on me and becomes a two dimensional sweet-roasty heavy stout on me after almost a pint. I would only have 1 in a sitting but it tastes good none the less."
"At my house, Shakespeare is very likely to appear in numerous encores!"
"D: This is a beer to be savored. Despite this, it's still very easily gulped down. A masterfully crafted beer by Rogue."
"D - I could have 3-4 of these tonight..."
"I drank this guy from a pint glass, but virtually had to force there to be any head with the last third of the pour. The taste had a pleasant richness to it with notes of chocolate and coffee, as well as a little bit of creaminess. It had real character and wasn't too dry. It also had a hoppy bite to it that was perfectly mild."
"Pours jet black with a tan head. In the aroma, roasty malt, a coffee presence and a small hop. In the taste, roasty malt and coffee, also a oatmeal sweetness. A smooth, bog bodied mouthfeel, with a semi-sweet maltiness in the aftertaste. Nice stout, oatmeal sweet and a nice hop presence."
"an easy pour brings out a nice thick tan head over a very dark beer, with some red highlights. the aroma is a very nice roasted malt smell, maybe some chocolate and coffee notes there, but the taste is where the malts really shine the coffee and chocolate are pronounced and fade away in a bit of bitterness that might be more due to the hops than the malt. the mouthfeel is full bodied, but with a bit too much carbonation for me."
"D- I was incorrect i thinking this was a RIS rather than an American Stout. A heavy earthy beer that I would only recommend to an experienced stout lover."
"Overall, a great beer, that maybe needs a little time."
"D- a great stout overall."
"Big flavor without being an extreme beer. Coffee lovers rejoice."
"Slippery, dark, dangerous. This is a well-made stout. It's not huge, by any account, everything is in moderation and everything is balanced. I had a great time chewing my way through it."
"drinkability is good. a standard stout without anything unique, yet solid and drinkable. a good brew from Rogue. cheers!"
"Overall a good drinking stout. A little outside the box with the strong hops, but well received. Could easily be a session beer when you want to go a little darker."
"Verdict was ""DRINK IT WARM."" Started out fridge temp in iced glasware. Was NOT impressed. As I let it warm to about 65 degrees it took on a whole new life and became a very drinkable beer. Don't serve this one ice cold please."
"mouthfeel is nice, a combo from the oaty smoothness and the hops adding a dry finish and overall bitterness, really nice american stout"
"22 ounce bottle. Great appearance: solid dark with a really thick, I would say inch, light chocolate head. The head laced away to this creamy lacing and thin, consistent head. Aromas have a frosty punch to them. Rich in roasty mocha, yeast/bread, malt, slight vanilla, dark chocolate. The taste is more or less the above mentioned flavors but with more of a roasted, bitter feel to them. Great stout body; really helps enhance the flavors. I think the drink got better after sip; great stout!"
"My palette got quickly tired of the espresso coffee, which was out of balance with the chocolates in the stout. I didn't finish the bottle, got bored with it toward the bottom. Underwhelming."
"This was a pleasant surprise indeed. Quite smooth and almost sessionable. I'll buy this again i'm sure. Give it a go!"
"D: Decent drinkability, was bitter but the body seemed a tad thin at times. Takes a few sips before you may warm up to this but goes down easier after that."
"This stout pours out thick, leaving an opaque color in the glass and an outstanding head that holds well. The aroma is full of roasted cocoa flavor. Up front on the palate, roasted barley is tasted first, then a wave of mild hops scramble on before a long lingering roasted aftertaste. Chocolate flavors emerge as the beer warms, sweetening things up a bit. Leftovers of chalk sits around in the aftertaste too. A good mix of flavors makes this beer a winner and a role model for how other craft brewers can make thier stouts."
"Very, very nice beer."
"A very nice stout, worth trying."
"Drinkability: Where you would have a Guinness, insert Shakespeare Stout instead. It's not the visual spectacle the Guiness is, but the feel and taste is just way beyond in every way. A beautiful drinking beer that leaves you wanting more after each sip."
"M/D: The feel is moderate but dry and slightly tingly from the carbonation. Almost too flavorfull and dry."
"D: This was an excellent stout for me and it surpassed my expectations honestly. I don't know if I could drink more than one in an evening, but that one was damn good."
"D - Quite drinkable, this is a bit of a departure from many other American stouts. The roast character is aggressive, but complex and it benefits form the additions of the unusually assertive hops. Along with Sierra Nevada Stout, this seems the be the classic example of a sub genre of American stouts that display an aggressive hop character that one doesn't seem to see very much anymore. The idea of a big, palate crushing stout that doesn't reach into Imperial alcohol levels seems to have been lost on many breweries in the last few years; Shakespeare shows us the potential of such a brew."
"For a very flavorful stout, the drinkability is surprisingly good. There is no feeling of heaviness or over-alcoholic aftertaste. Given the extra sweetness, this would make an excellent dessert beer."
"A very fine beer from Rogue. Surprisingly fresh and delicious here at the airport."
"Let me start off to say that this beer really smells quite different, and not good in my opinion, the palate differs though. I will start off with the good to say there is plenty of chocolate marsh mellows, but really has quite a bit of medicinal notes that are very present. The beer almost smells like a cleaning agent to some sort, to what causes this i'm not certain. To the palate- a different story. The taste infuses chocolate, cinnamon and gingerbread that has a balance of some bitter hops. I like this beer, but the nose is incredibly weird. One of the few beers where the nose is off, and the taste is on"
"D: Very tasty and would drink again. Happy with this as I am happy with most Rogue brews. A bomber is more than enough for a sitting."
"Something this flavorful is always going to fare well on my drinkability meter... but having more than one bomber of this could be a bit much."
"D- Pretty high as far as drinkabilty. Pretty good american stout. There certainly are stouts that I like better, but this is one of the best."
"Very drinkable for a stout. Well balances flavors are not over powering and a modest ABV makes is sessionable. A really nice brew from the folks at Rogue."
"D: This is a great west coast style stout - I'm really enjoying the pronounced hop character of this one. Very rich and creamy yet quite easy to drink. I will definitely buy this beer again and I look forward to sampling more of Rogue's lineup."
"T/M/D - Smooth and creamy but light (not as thick as say, Guinness), a slight burnt taste, slightly milky and very mildly sweet. Settles in nicely, and leaves a little bit of a lingering aftertaste. Pretty good stout."
"Drinkability- An ok brew, I found this one disappointing but Im not a big fan of hopped stouts'."
"A thick brew that passes smoothly over the palate. Great pub stout to wash down some grub."
"MF&D- Medium bodied and slightly sticky. It coats the mouth well leaving behind a nice smoky finish. A good stout that I would definitely recommend. I am yet to be let down by Rogue."
"Pours deep deep black with a big tan ice cream head. Smell is nice maltiness, slight copper, and bitter chocolate. Taste follows with really roasty malts and some slight coffee. Bitter chocolate on the finish. Good unusually noticable hop bite on the finish, not overwhelming, but more pronounced than you find in most stouts (excluding imperial stouts). A great brew, but not one for beginners, very complex, I like it. great beer. Pacman rules."
"D: fine. alcohol not very noticable at all. Stouts are not my thing really, but if they're yours, you will likely really enjoy this one. Of the few stouts I've had, this one is the best because of pleasant aromas and flavors and it was suprizingly easy to drink."
"A very good stout - one of my favorites."
"This poured out a very dark brown with a medium head. It had a sweet chocolate flavor to start, followed by a nice coffee flavor that was quite bitter in the aftertaste. This became slightly milder as it grew warmer. It had a very good texture to it, not too thick or thin. This was a great stout to sip, with lots of subtleties."
"This is about as good of a stout as I've had. Infinitely drinkable. Nice amount of flavor without being overbearing and nice balance of malt and hops. For an everyday drinking stout, this is my choice."
"HV"
"A pretty damn drinkable and tasty stout with a fair amount going on in it. Rich chocolate character and somewhat mild roastiness should make this a great stout for introducing newbies to the style, so long as they enjoy cascades. A very well made brew, wonder why it took me so long to finally crack this bottle, as it has been sitting in my cellar for a year or so."
"A very good stout"
"Poured into my Rogue pint glass. Light-sucking black with a monumental 2.5 finger head of a nice deep tan. Great retention and lacing. Can't ask for a better appearance than this. Great aroma of chocolate-covered coffee beans with a clear hoppiness in the background. The citrus is unconventional (well unless you're on the west coast where no amount of hops is too much) and interesting, but it may be a little strong. Flavor is an epic coffee-forward barrage of roastiness with less hops than the aroma would lead you to believe. This ends up being pretty perfect as far as balance goes. Really tasty stout. Finish is long and dry."
"D-smoothest Stout I've ever enjoyed,hands down!!!!"
"d: It took me a long time to try one of these, and I'm glad I finally did. I've got lots of great local stouts to pick from, so it probably won't crack my regular rotation, but this definitely a quality stout."
"D: A little too roasty for me. It kind of overpowers everything else in the beer."
"This is an all around excellent Stout, and honestly, this is what other beers in the genre should be striving for. Cheers!"
"A very good American stout. Lots of flavor, but very drinkable"
"OVerall this was a pretty good beer. Not my style of choice, but I enjoyed it nonetheless."
"Pours dark, rich black color into a pint glass. Little head present, but first smell is of dark chocolate, mixed with some lighter hints. I was impressed by the taste--great combination of rich flavors with a wonderful, lingering aftertaste (described by others as chocolate covered cherry--I think that's a great description!). I would definitely order this again, and having it on tap was a great treat!"
"I don't drink enough stouts. I always expect them to be heavier.. but this is a nice stout that is actually very drinkable... especially on a cool Idaho night. I've had the Shakespeare Stout a bunch of times over the years.... especially lately; I bet I've picked up 4-5 bombers recently with the intent of reviewing.. but drink it anyway. Certainly a good beer for the Stout stable.. although quite a bit more pricey lately."
"D - For sure a session in the making. I could drink this everyday in the winter. Um-um goodness, highly recommended."
"It is fairly average in some respects, but is very well balanced. Nothing jumps out at you, but I could drink these all night long without my tastebuds getting fried."
"Rogue Shakespeare Stout pours a medium dense, opaque black with a short stiff tanish brown head. The smell is very pleasant and medium strong of roasted malts. Taste is predominant of malts with a roasted chocolate aftertaste. Mouthfeel is silky smooth with a low to medium carbonation. Overall the drinkability is fantasic. The smoothness comboed with the mellow malt flavor makes this very enjoyaboe to drink. Definitely one of the best from Rogue."
"notes-this was a good beer, and i had it right after a diff stout, both were good and yet different"
"D: I am a fan of Rogue and this fine brew does not disappoint. It's aroma and taste, as well as moderate ABV make this a brew that can be a great session drink. Nothing blows you away but everything works well together to produce another fine Rogue product."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable.Worth trying again."
"Overall, enjoyable, but out here on the West Coast, it's hard to beat Old Rasputin (I know, slightly different style), given it can be found easily. On the other hand, this doesn't knock you on your ass like Old Rasputin does, so kudos to Rogue for making a flavorable, tasty beer that doesn't zonk you out. Would make a decent session beer."
"On a scale of smooth to not smooth, this would be a 10... or a zero. I'm not really sure, but it's damn smooth."
"D: Extraordinarily drinkable. Stouts are one of my favorite styles and this tops them all...I certainly believe the World Champion boast on the bottle. I could literally drink this all day long."
"Black thick pour with a slightly oil look to it. Nice big foamy brown lasting head. Smell is fairly heavily hopped, with a rich roastiness in the background and a bit of dry cocoa. Taste is roasty, with medium to high carbonation, and was well hopped. Slightly overcarbonated, a bit dry, and bland, although the body was full and rich. Okay, but far from one of my favorite stouts. Just boring overall, and needed some sweetness to make the flavors pop a bit more."
"D - A excellent American stout, really has a lot of the hop flavor that you don't get in English styles."
"This is great stuff."
"Cheers!"
"This could be one of my regular beers."
"Overall: this is a very well made/considered stout that is a wonderful representation of the style. If someone asked me what and American Stout tastes like I would undoubtedly point them here."
" A very solid stout in my opinion. A great interpretation of a classic English stout, bastardized by Rogue to produce another winner. Nicely done, I'll be buying more."
"Notes - One of the best stouts ever. A microbrew classic."
"A nice pour released a black liquid , off brown tan head, some lace, looked thick. Smelled of roasted malts, maybe smoked?, some coffee, wood. Tasted great- malty, bitter hoppy, vanilla, well balanced, Lots going on, superbly balanced. Sticky on the tongue and lips, thick body going down. Awesome stout. Cheers."
"From 22 oz. bomber into mug. Ultra-dark body - lighter than expected, moderate head. Despite the mellow head this looks deep, dark and intriguing. Clean aroma - fresh yet disappointingly light fireplace aroma. Deep, dry and smoky - while this may not be my thing I can't disparage it - extremely well-made and balanced. Very clean for the robust style - dark roast coffee, slightly bitter (chicory tones?). Tartish yet deep-roasted palate - a little clammy on the finish - the afterburn has a cold, smoky feeling (sort of like camping in the late fall). The hint of carbonation can be a little distracting with the smoky roast. Wouldn't turn this stuff down at all - it may not be my thing but it's entirely a class act."
"D- Very enjoyable to drink"
"D: Quite sessionable. If this came in sixers, I think it would be a staple of my fridge. Some stouts are treats, and as such demand to be drank alone. On the other hand, I wouldn't mind putting away two or three of these with a meal."
"Pours an opaque darkness with a huge stiff light tan head that resists fading and settles like an ice cream float with massive 3d lacing. The smell is slightly less aggressive than some, but the earthy oat and chocolate comes through. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is medium bodied, and very creamy with a wonderful moderate malty chocolate after taste. Full flavored, the chocolate and oat combination scores! At 6% ABV this one is a real nice drinker. Wouldn't feel comfortable offering this to any individual partial to AB (or InBev for that matter). Cheers Baby!!"
"Black body with a very large and thick tan colored head. It has a very sweet roasted malt aroma with hints of hops and some chocolate, toffee and some coffee flavors as well. The taste delivers just that. It tastes of roasted malts along with a litte hop bitterness to balance out the sweetness of the stout which is followed by subtly sweet tastes of chocolate, toffee, and coffee. The moutfeel is excellent. It has a velvety smooth mouthfeel with the right amount of carbonation for this beer. It is an extremely drinkable beer and I would reccommend this one to anyone looking to taste how a stout should be made."
"A different take on a stout with the hop nose and taste. I will buy this again."
"Overall, another outstanding Rogue brew. They continue to impress with every style and make me wonder why I live on the East Coast. A must try for any American stout or oatmeal stout fan."
"Not much to complain about."
"Drinkability: alcohol seems non-existent until I finish the 22 oz. bottle. It's there and well hidden. For those looking for a stout with a known hop prominence, this fits the bill."
"So, once again never had this beer fresh, but i find it a nicely complex stout but not the best ive had."
"I would say that this is miss labeled. This seems like an oatmeal stout in every way. Anyway, what ever it is labeled, this is a great stout. A beer that should not be missed."
"Taste is quite chewy, strong malt front with a bitterness that slowly builds up and lingers. Great carbonation along with a creamy taste. Although the taste is deceiving, feels like this could be stronger than the 6%."
"I pored this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a black a beer aas I have ever seen. Completely opaqe. The smell wa rich coffee. The taste was coffee but smooth like black velvet and not strong like a lot of stouts or bitter. The beer had great lacing though the head was gone rather quickly as was the beere. Great beer I will buy again for sure."
"D: low ABV and very drinkable. would highly recommend giving this beer a try"
"The prime example of a GREAT Stout!! Poured into a Rogue pint glass at the Issaquah Brewhouse. Very opaque black with a thin somewhat dark head that was somewhat diminishing and lest spotty lacing. Aroma was everything I'd expect in a stout but just a little more complex. Taste was very much in tune with a good stout, definite characteristics of rich chocolate and coffee with the necessary presence of roasted barley. Mouthfeel was somewhat on the heavy side for a 6% beer, however, this is a great warmer for a cold winter night in Washington."
"Sampler at San Francisco Rogue Public House. Ohhh....this is gooood! Jet black body, with a quickly receding off-white head. Classic roasted malt stout aromas in the nose, accented with a fruity sweetness. Lots of chocolate in the flavour, along with coffee and hops. Satisfyingly thick on the palate, and easy to sink."
"Bought a 1 pint, 6 fl. oz bottle of this from Bottle King in Livingston for about $5.99, and I must say, coming from a high-caliber company like Rogue's, I really wasn't too impressed with this Stout sample... expected more, and was let down by an overall lack of flavor and complexity... appearance was about average, poured a jet-black, ebony color with minimal tan head... smell was complete with burnt, dark chocolate, espresso, and liquorice aromas... taste was typical stout, with dark-espresso and cocoa flavors that was more bitter than sweet... Taste seemed pretty watered-down and somewhat more bland than I was expecting...definitely had much better stouts before this, and the overall taste was more average than anything else... I wouldn't say this was a bad brew, just wasn't to my liking and not one I would try again... Wouldn't recommend this one..."
"D - this is an excellent stout it has a good taste to it this definitely worth trying someime"
"A highly drinkable stout! I think what throws people off is the hoppiness which is unexpected in a stout. What these people aren't noticing is that this is an American Stout, so it makes sense for it to be different. I've had other cascade-hopped stouts (by Rock Bottom in Palos Park, Illinois and Goose Island in Chicago, Illinois) and this is by far the best. Its unexpected and balanced well. This brew gets so much better as it warms up so please try not to gulp it all down to hastily. A stout to make even the most earnest liberal climb on their roof and shout, ""Go America!"""
"Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. This is a drinkable stout that is spot-on for the style. Highly recommended."
"D: Definitely a good beer, its a sipper."
"This is hands down one of the best beers in the world"
"Black, ebony - no highlights of anything, plenty of rocky tan colored head. Looks just like a stout should look. Chunks of foamy lacing. Aroma of chocolate malt is subtle not in-your-face huge like an RIS. Also cascade hops are present in the aroma. Taste is coffee-like with a bitter cascade finish. Mouthfeel is moderate with plenty of carbonation. I like drinking this beer. It is very nicely balanced and one worth having on hand. A stout for fans of subtlety and complexity."
"Pours dark and very little light can get through (though a wee bit does). Nose is almost a gummy cocoa. You get that roasted coffee and chocolate that you come to expect from some of the great stouts. But the flavor. Oh baby, the flavor. Rich and full with strong coffee tones and it just stays constant with a slight change throughout the life of it on your mouth. Feel is smooth and it is very drinkable. Even more so than the Imperial Stout for the obvious reasons of course."
"D: I rated the Smell lower because it doesn't quite hint at the excellent flavors found in this great stout. Big flavors + low abv = a very drinkable stout!"
"Drinkability: While this is a fantastic stout, I've had better in the drinkability department. The roasted barley/astringent character detracts a tiny bit from the quaffability. But overall: RECOMMENDED!"
"D: In between a sipper and being able to drink 3 or so bombers. Depends on the temperature it is served at."
"D - Great beer that's easy to drink. The lower alcohol content makes this easy to enjoy the whole bottle and then some more."
"I'm usually not impressed with the Rogue line-up but this was a nice surprise. Good beer."
"another fine offering from rogue, a company that i respect for offering a lot of different beers that i have enjoyed for the better part of the past fifteen years."
"D- I wasn't impressed with this beer. I don't think I'll try another Rogue beer. Every one I've had has been unimpressive. This is another letdown."
"Jet black body with a good mocha colored head. Great chocolaty roasty aroma with tons of coffee. The aroma is very strong and delicious. The flavor has TONS of roast malt with coffee and chocolate in the background. Bitterness is pretty high for a stout, but Rogue is as Rogue does. I can't get any hop flavor off this one. Good heavy body but not thick. It doesn't make much sense to say, but it makes sense in my mind. All the body is right up front and it slims down almost immediately. A great stout all around."
"Been on a stout kick lately and this has to be the highlight so far. Poured from bomber into chalice. This is one hell of a black beer, nick thick and creamy mocha head forms with good retention and average lacing. Smell is of toasted grains, coffee, and a touch of alcohol, something about the smell seems just a little off or out of place. This beer tastes amazing, everything a stout should be. Nice dark, malted grains, a hint of coffee, some chocolate (slightly bitter) and a small touch of hops which I normally dont detect in stouts but I like the presence. The mouthfeel is incredible, nice and thick, low on carbonation, it just seems perfect. The lower ABV makes this an easy drinker. Definitly enjoyed best at a warmer temperature and its meant for slow sipping."
"D, notes: Drinkability is ok. A little too bitter without enough malt balance in my opinion."
"Poured a 22oz bomber into a chalice. Poured an opaque black, that allowed a little light through that showed mahogany hues. Aroma is chocolate and coffee. Taste is a bit mellower than I expected. There is chocolate up front with a lot of roasted malts, a bit of hops at the end to balance. Mouthfeel is good, nice and smooth. If there is ever a chance for a stout to be a session beer then this is one. This goes down very easily."
"Poured a bomber of this into a pint glass. Poured a dark black with a thick khaki head. Smells of burnt caramel, coffee, and chocolate prove to me that this is a stout. Tastes very nice - all the smells were present in the taste, with mild sour notes. A little hoppier than I expected, though not bad at all. Very balanced with a nice thick mouthfeel. I'll probably have this again sometime."
"D: This is another outstanding stout from Rogue. This and the Chocolate Stout are by far two of my standards in that category. Very drinkable, and very delicious."
"D: Like the bottle says, it's pretty mellow, great mouthfeel and a compelling but not too complicated taste, I could drink this all night"
"Drinkability: If you want a thirst quenching, enjoyable stout to tip back over and over again all night, this is your beer. It does not have the depth that other popular craft stouts have (or Rogue Chocolate Stout for that matter) but this one has no flaws and is fairly robust in terms of flavor. (4.5)"
"Dark mysterious black body with a dark tan head. No lacing but bubbles stick to the glass under the surface. Burnt malt nose with expected Rogue hoppiness present. Nice malty taste with some chocolate and hops. Coffee finish that is a bit dry from all of the hops, I presume. A nice smooth feel to it that is almost a bit watery. Enjoyable brew. A bit on the pricey side though, therefore hurting the drinkability for me."
"This is a great beer, The way it should be. Buy It. Drink It. Enjoy It. Best I've had yet."
"Staple american brew for converting guiness lovers"
"D- Quite drinkable. Enjoyable and not too heavy."
"D- a very worthy stout"
"This is a hop lovers stout, but a great exercise for the stout lovers."
"Poured out of the large bottle a wonderful pitch black, almost like an onyx gem, the way it reflected light. It had a wonderful tan head and great lacing. Not much of a scent, though, very little to detect beyond some roasted grains. Nice taste, a very nice roasted flavor, seemed more like a dry Irish stout than an American, but good nonetheless. Not many other characteristics to the taste, though. Goes down great, very smooth."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability - Low carbonation = empty bottle. I truly savored the beer, and I realized after a while that I was done with this bottle. I could enjoy another bottle or two in one sitting. I noticed that it complimented the cool weather outside. Def. a late fall beer."
"Drinkability is average. I have to say I don't see what all the fan fare is about, it's just too acrid for my taste...I could use more coffee and less coffee grinds. That being said, the body is pretty light and the ABV modest enough that it went down easy enough, particularly as it warmed. Still, I'll take Rogue's Chocolate Stout over this every time."
"D: Pretty good. Definitely a sipping beer."
"Smells and tastes exactly like a strong coffee. Unfortunately, that's all it tastes like. I remember this beer being much more complex. But, after having it tonight, I feel as though it's a decent stout, but there are definitely better ones on the market."
"Pours out a very dark brown, almost black with a big chocolate milk head that dies slow to a ring. Smells of mild cocoa, mild coffee and a slight hop twinge. Taste as it smells with coffee and roasty notes coming forth bigger and bigger as it warms. A nice bitter hop bite on the finish. Medium in the mouth and very smooth. Nicely drinkable. An american classic stout."
"The lacing continued throughout the first few sips and this evaluation. As I sit here looking at this dark and lovely beverage, I think it is time to terminate this review and get down to the task at hand. No excuses!"
"It's so drinkable that I had restrain myself from gulping it down. I poured about half the bottle initially, put a stopper in it and stuck it back in the fridge for a few days to see if the aromas might emerge. I pulled it back out about 20 minutes ago to no avail, unfortunately. But I'm perfectly content drinking it the way it is. A brilliant stout, this is."
"JB&KW"
"D - I should have bought 2 bombers... oh well, next time!"
"D--Lovely, refreshing stout. Went well with my AYCE king crab...didnt overpower the meal at all. One I could drink again and again."
"Mouthfull is ""semi chewy"" I want to EAT the rest of this beer. Very creamy, very smooth carbonation. A classic. I want to session this beer VERY soon. Ther is nothing over the top. Just an exceptional balanced stout."
"What would life be like without a bit of Shakespeare. This has been a long time favorite. Pours a very dark brown with tan head that does not last. Smell has lots of coffee and chocolate. The taste has lots of bitterness and it can be a bit of a mouthfeel. Maybe a little to much but hey I like big beers but one 22oz bottle is usually enough."
"D I would have to say Yes, draft, bottle or from someone elses glass"
"I really enjoyed the taste and drinkability of this stout. Lots of matly coffee goodness along with some chocolate and a hoppy zing."
"Thick creamy head that rivals a cold-deck pint of Guinness. Color is a deep brown, rivaling the bottle. The head lingers as I drink the beer leaving long laces along the side I tip to my mouth. The smell of the beer is the only part that is lacking. I catch only a hint of roasted malts and chocolate. The beer tastes wonderful. This is where I found the roasted malts and chocolate flavors I yearn and some well balanced hints of hops to round out the beer. It is velvety on the tongue and the flavors linger as I swallow. Quite drinkable although the 22oz bottle can take awhile to finish."
"I was slightly disappointed by this stout's taste as far as complexity and intensy, but it was still very delicious. The best way to describe it would be like dark chocolate covered espresso beans, which became more bitter as the beer warmed up. And the mouthfeel was positively heavy."
"D - Very, a refreshing pleasant stout with a low abv and a nice flavor. I was expecting a more powerful stout, not the lighter subdued ""session stout"" that this is. I might have this again if found on tap."
"Pours a complete black with a very generous two finger tan colored head that dies down to a nice frothy layer. Stickiness is pretty good with a nice wall of lacing all over the sides. Smell is a nice milk chocolate up front that masks a nice hop tingle. Sweet caramel mixes in well with an hint of espresso. Solid, complex smell for a 6%-er. Taste is a bit disappointing to be honest. Stale coffee flavor up front with a tiny hint of smokey caramel. Not much else, pretty basic on the tongue. Was expecting much more from the smell, but I learned my lesson not to assume. Moutfhfeel is surprisingly light bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. Decent brew, but really thought there would be more in terms of flavor."
"I realize this is a low ABV beer, but the mouthfeel and taste were somewhat thin for a beer of this type. A decent stout, but nowhere near one of my favorites."
"Snatched the 650ml bottle from Community Beverage back in early-August and had the will power not to drink it until last night. Poured out deep dark brown, almost black. Very little head with moderately-gentle pour. Lacing was amazingly thin. Smelled of roasted hops/malts, sweet malts, chocolate , and coffee. Delicious taste. Quite full-bodied and the roasted flavors are quite pronounced. Unlike Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout (one of my personal favorites), this brew has a more subtle chocolate and coffee taste and the alcohol level is perfect. Deliciously smooth and a wonderful brew. Completely warranted of its high ranking and rating."
"Highly recommended and one of the best Rogue brews I have had"
"Very nice stout from Rogue. Pours beautifully, jet black with ruby brown highlights and a creamy mocha colored head. The smell is nice, with coffee, chocolate, piney and fruity hops, and grain. The taste is quite bitter and full, reminding me most of cold press coffee and dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is full and creamy, and the drinkability is quite good, perhaps a bit tough for those with more novice palates."
"Give St. Ambroise's Oatmeal Stout a try if you like this and want to be bolder."
"if you ask me"
"Rogue Shakespeare Stout poured a very rich dark brown color. Poured about a half inch head, creamy in color. There is definitely a hint of oats and a definitive chocolate aftertaste. Certainly one of the best stouts that I've ever had before. Recommended to anyone."
"Pretty nice stout, I'd buy it again."
"I'm still fairly new to the world of stouts. If anybody reads this review and thinks of a stout on this caliber, I would love to know."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is black with a thick, sudsy, mocha colored head. Looks very viscous on the pour. Smell is a mix of chocolate, burnt coffee and cascade hops. The chocolate is most apparent. The taste is primarily malty, with the burnt coffee and chocolate malt being the most obvious. The hops are more for balance than for taste although there is a hint of cascade in the finish. There is a slight astringency as well that dries the mouth. The mouthfeel is full bodied and lightly carbonated and as I just said, has a dry finish. A drinkable stout and all-in-all a solid offering by Rogue."
"The smell is chocolately and roasted malts. Its tastes of chocolate and a little bit of coffee. This is a very smooth and balanced beer."
"Although taste was less than expected still good and drinkable. Take two."
"D: A great stout, handsome and smooth, probably my favourite everyday beer from Rogue."
"pick it up."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into an English pint glass. This stout poured a deep brown/black color with a decent sized dark tan head that slowly turned into a thin layer of bubbles that lasted. Minimal lacing. The aroma included chocolate, coffee, and some spicy hoppiness. The flavor was dark roasted malts, coffee, and just a bit of hops on the tail end. There is a slight lingering aftertaste of chocolate and coffee left on the tounge. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and creamy with light carbonation. An excellent sessionable stout from Rogue!"
"Pours a dark black color with a nice brown head. Aroma is malty and roasty with a mild hint of coffee. Taste is very malty and the roastiness shines in the mouthfeel. I really like the aftertaste. Coffee explodes at the back of the tongue as well. Goes down very smooth and leaves a semi-dry taste. A second sip confirms the same. Very nice stout. Roasty, has hints of coffee and goes down well. Excellent!"
"D: The smooth and balanced flavors, along with it being only 6%, make for a very drinkable stout. A solid stout, you can't go wrong with this one."
"Like I said I'm new to this so I won't pretend to be an expert by any means but this was one of my first what I would call more obscure (at least to the average consumer) beers and it was a wonderful experience. I would highly recommend this beer any time"
"Almost black pour with nice head. Aroma and taste of dark roasted malt. Very good stout that I would buy again and recommend. My brother(pojo41) and I really liked this one alot and will have again when I get the chance. Unfortunately, can't find this in the beer hell we call Mississippi. Give it a try, you wont be disappointed."
"Now this is a great beer!! I managed to find this while in Texas and after hearing all the hype about it,I knew I had to try it.IMHO it lived up to it,and then some.I could get to love this beer if it were not so hard to find,but it is, and therefore it is pretty much out of my reach.If you can find it,and you like Stouts,by all means try it."
"D - Pretty damn good! One of the better American Stouts, but I was expecting more complexity from a beer that's rated #55 on the ""Best of BA"" list. Don't get me wrong, it is a damn good stout and it's also very drinkable.... I will definitely pick this up again!"
"Of the two Rogue stouts that are reasonably priced, I like the Chocolate Stout a little better than this one. Personal preference as the Choc. Stout is sweeter than this one. This is still a pretty good beer."
"Light body and mouthfeel. Not thick or viscous at all. Slight alcohol presence is there without it being hot. A very good beer I would say for any time of the year."
"Overall- Good stout, slighty loses its bold flavor later into the bottle. When colder weather comes in find this on tap and drink it all night!"
"Poured from a 650ml bottle with no dating info into my pint glass after letting warm up a little. It was dark black in color even against a light. It had a good sized brownish head that slowly settled to a collar with a bit of film in the middle of the glass. No lacing. The aroma was pretty sedate. It was malty with coffee and choc malts in the background. The taste was really good but also kinda sedate. Really expected more of a kick after ready some reviews. It seemed to be missing that extra something that would have gotten it a higher score. Good amount of bitter finish. Mouthfeel was a little on watery side compared to other Am Stouts that I've had recently. Overall, a good beer that you should try but I still prefer Cadillac Mtn Stout in this category. (4, RB-OAY, T, Y)"
"very drinkable, not at all over-the-top."
"I have this lots but never reviewed it ( strange ?) It is one of my favourite stouts for both its smoothness ( not in a tasteless Guiness way) and its complexity ( notes of chocolate and roasted malt are interwoven with pure bliss. A benchmark for stouts."
"The American Stout category has a lot of breadth to its definition. Some of the examples of the style have characteristics that are more distinctive than this one (one example being another Rogue variety - chocolate stout), but as a well rounded if not somewhat subdued example, Shakespeare fits the bill nicely."
"D: I would for sure try this one again and not buy it from World Market but a real liqour store which might allow for a fresher review."
"All that being said to achieve a better score, it needs to be a little more over the top >:{"
"D- this is an amazing beer, i will definitley drink it again!"
"Honestly, this is a year-round beer. It is great to drink, use in beef stew, or just simply drink some more. Let's face it, tough to go wrong with rogue."
"This one is a good solid American style dry stout. I've found over the years that I'm not partial to many of the Rogue products, but the fact that they still churn out fine brews like this and some others keeps me drinking their stuff. This beer pours black with a slight tan head and some slight lacing. The smell is of roasted grain, chocolate, dark fruit and cream. Very nicely balanced and appetizing. The taste is even better. Perfectly balanced roastiness, creaminess, and dry chocolate flavors come together without being sweet. Very nice, and with good depth while maintaining the dry stout profile. The mouthfeel as well is creamy but dry, making this quite drinkable. This stout shows that you can make an intensely flavored, balanced stout without heaping on the alcohol. A classic of the style, I can't believe I've waited so long to try it."
"Drinkability.... my kind of beer! Nice robust stout with good consistancy. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability is great. This one is so easy to drink, and enjoyable. As good I remember it from years ago..."
"Poured a deep dark black as night with a big foaming tan head. Very thick and opaque, like oil, but nicely carbonated. Smell was full of coffee and chocolate tones, with a definate sweetness that was evident from the very beginning. The taste was very full and robust. A nice full bodied feel. Flavors were very full, lots of caramel and sugar, coffee and chocolate tones were very predominant. Overall this is a very fine sessionable stout and was very glad to finally try it. Very easy to drink and very enjoyable. Another winner from Rogue."
"More Notes: Okay, I feel sick. This is soo much stout. I cant handle it. You have beaten me Rogue! Death by tasty."
"Overall too rich for continuous consumption. Maybe a tad heavy for my taste. Tasty, but not as complex as I was expecting."
"Drank a 22 oz bomber of this all on my own, in celebration of finishing my dissertation. Pours an opaque black with a ruby-brown head. Nice head to it, it dissipated a little quickly, but not too bad. Lovely smells of dark chocolate, roasted coffee, molasses, something tart like cherries. Tastes of much of the same: opens sweet like the chocolate and molasses, finishes nicely some bitterness from the coffee. Rounded out with flavors of toasted oats and some of the dark fruitiness. Good mouthfeel - nice thickness for the style, without being overpowering. Overall, a very well-crafted stout. Wonderfully drinkable, very enjoyable."
"D- This was good. Very drinkable. It still a sipper since it is a stout; but it is a very interesting and complex beer. Recommended."
"I know many will disagree."
"Mouth: Roast character is much more pronounced in flavor than in smell with a chewy, burnt toast feel to it all the way through. A touch of heat as it comes back up. The flavor falls a bit flat, though, as there doesn't seem to be a lot more than the roastiness. A roast bitterness lingers, very nice, but where's the balance? Mouthfeel is quite well carbonated but not as smooth as it could be."
"First off, I have to mention this was only $3.75 for a 20 oz. pint while it costs $5.25 for a 22 oz. bomber at Tiffany's in K-zoo. Anyways, Shakespeare Stout is basically, combines a rich and smooth cocoa and coffee malt profile with IPA-like hops flavors. It's a great mix of chocolate and citrus hops, hop chocolate if you will. I think the yeast masks, or takes the edge off, the grains. They're just not as big or complex as a good stout could be. Another good example of a bitter, but dark beer is Smuttynose's Robust Porter, check that out for the malt profile I'm talking about."
"Very nice beer that always seems to impress me."
"As you can tell I'm very pleased with this beer. I'm going to keep buying this beer without hesitation. Drinkability, is easilty one of the best out there."
"A solid stout."
"Drinkability - Went down well, it was a good beer. I was hoping for another favorite from Rogue. Will pass by this bottle if there is a decent variety to choose from."
"Drinkability: Goes down great. One of my favorite stouts!"
"D: Pretty complex tasting beer, would have this again for sure. Probably my favorite dark beer that Rogue has."
"Had this brew on-nitro today at the Eugene City Brewery. Paired VERY well with my Reuben. Poured a very dark color, thick creamy tan head. Smell is of nicely toasted malt, slightly of coffee. Not an overpowering aroma powerhouse, but all together well balanced. Tastes nice and roasted, just a bit coffee flavor to go along with the nice malt body. Very creamy mouthfeel. Man, this went down so easy. Please sir may I have another!"
"Drinkability- This was one of the best stouts I had the first time I drank it, and its still one of the best stouts this time. Its a very nice, subtle beer that has flavor, but not IRS intensity. Great beer!"
"I read about this big tasty bitter stout and it sounds harsh, and difficult to drink, but it is anything but. Ridiculously drinkable - it sure as hell won't be another year before I'll have this again."
"Pours a solid opaque black color with a two finger tan head. Nice lacing and decent retention too. Aromas were big and enticing with coffee, chocolate, roasted barley, and caramel dominating. Delicious flavors display everything found in the aroma plus a tasty hop presence as well. Hands down one of the best American Stouts I've had and ridiculously drinkable too. Get this when you see it."
"D- I could have another."
"D-This is a stout I should be having more often. It is going down easily despite the hangover"
"I really enjoy this stout one of my tops."
"Mmmm. Served up with a nice brown creamy head, pours out dark brown-black. The smell is sweet of chocolate and roasted malts and maybe some caramel?. The taste is a little bit bitter up front, but then mainly of sweet malt - lots of lacing. Delicious. I think this is Rogue's best product."
"But Rogue didn't have to sacrifice flavor and body to make a drinkable stout."
"This is one of my most favorite beers. Ebony in color with fairly small head. Wonderfully bitter after taste. Not a high gravity beer, but I must rate the ""feeling"" of this beer as exceptional. Just as drinkable as a Guiness yet much more complex and distinct. I am a huge Rogue fan, so I may be biased, but if you like Stouts, this is probably the best domestic you will find."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied and goes down very easy for a stout. In my opinion, the ABV is perfect for this beer and makes if very drinkable. I'd be happy with a couple of bombers in a sitting. Overall, it's a very good stout. Highly recommended."
"While not the best stout out there, this is still a solid, well-rounded, well-crafted beer, and worth a try."
"What an interesting pour  thick and oily with a nice rocky head. The aroma is heavy of roasted malt. The flavors swirl on my tongue  heavy with roasted malt and sweetness for balance. The mouthfeel is definitely heavy  just shy of chewy. This beer has the character of something suitable of Shakespeares time."
"D: Super good stout, not too bitter or roasted. Good balance makes it very easy to drink."
"The bitterness is balanced well, just one the boarder of being a little too present for me for the style. The bottle lists that only cascades where used, dont get me wrong I love cascade hops, but Im beginning to think that cascades used as bittering hops and boiled for a full 60 min. or more become a bit muddy. The mouth feel is pleasant on this could be a tad thicker, but nice just the same. This is a very tasty beer though I doubt Ill buy it again, just the same absolutely worth the experience"
"overall this is one of the top three beers taht i have ever had it is amazing"
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a mug. Pours an incredibly dark color, closest to pure black I've ever seen, with just the barest hints of brown around the edges of the glass. A nice tan billowy head with a little lacing. Smell is strong mocha malt, with a hint of alcohol, some nuttiness, a little chocolate, sweet molasses. Fairly bitter flavor up front, although not particularly hoppy until the end. Coffee flavor in the middle, with strong roasted malts coming through. A little sweet at the end, before the aftertaste. Body is strong and full, creamy, with solid carbonation; an oddly 'crunchy' beer, although I'm not sure if that makes any sense. It's a good beer, with a distinct, interesting flavor. For me it's a little too extensively bitter (a sort of coffee-like hoppiness, if that's possible) in the aftertaste, which makes it a little less drinkable. But overall, a good beer, quite tasty."
"One of the first beers I discovered. It introduced me not only to real stouts, but also great beer."
"Taste is light, sweet and fruity. Tons of estery watermellon, mango and apple ride a backbone of milk chocolate, cherries, and rasberries. Moderately buttery, with a very subtle hop, and hints of lemon rind in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, drinkability is very high. An excellent counterpart to the Chocolate Sout- very impressive."
"A great beer and in my opinion one of the best stouts out there."
"22 oz. bomber with the ingredients listed on the side; 69 IBUs. It sits in my chalice deep black with a half-inch of orangey/brown head that halves in depth, yet retains, and leaves light lacing. The bouquet is exquisite, lightly sweet, with roasted, chocolate, and espresso malts, pine, cake/cookies, brownies, black/blueberry, green apple, strawberry?, pear?, vanilla?, and some green hops to bring it all together. It tastes of roasted/bitter/charred malts, chocolate, tobacco, leather, earth, charcoal/ashtray, green/piney hops, and a touch of oats. The body is medium, drying, with medium carbonation and a long, lingering finish. Just a touch too thin for me, but overall a wondrous stout that is highly recommended and well worth revisiting."
"The most striking this about Shakespeare Stout is that despite how full bodied and full flavored it is, it goes down so damn easy. As long as Rogue is making this beer, I'll be buying it. Delicious!"
"poured from a 22oz. bomber. total black, or the darkest brown i have ever seen, with a caramel laced head. the smell is chocolate, dark fruit and coffee with slight hop prescence. the taste is amazing. the perfect balance of flavors. this beer compliments itself very well. definitly the best stout i've had to date. this beer perfect, or as close to perfect as i've seen so far."
"A bit more carbonated than I would have liked but a great stout nonetheless. As I get to the bottom of the snifter the beer warms, the carbonation lessens, and enjoy the taste characteristics more."
"A 22oz bottle was great, but if they made 33 oz bottles, I'd have been happier. This is mighty close to exactly what I am looking for when I want a stout."
"D- I have had some other bottles of this I know to be a few months old and I recall them being much better than this. I wonder if a little more time in the fridge would have done this beer some good. Still worth a try."
"A superb dry stout. Highly recommended. The best of the Rogue beers I've had to date, and probably the best Stout I've had (but I change my mind on that pretty often)."
"The mouthfeel is lacking a body and true taste, it's kind of thin. It still coats the mouth with dark chocolate, which is nice, but the black olives and lake water linger on the palate. The drinkability is one of the better aspects of this beer. It seems light for a stout, so it goes down well. The chocolate and malt aren't too overwhelming or sweet, so I enjoyed the whole 22oz. bomber. I think I need to stop drinking so many Imperial Stouts, because they are making me think regular Stouts are too thin. I'll try this again because, even though everyone's tastes are different, I expected this to be much better. I'm assuming I had a bad bottle. The store I bought it from isn't the cleanest and is known for some older bottles."
"Dark chocolate in color with a light brown head. smell of roasted malts, baking cocoa and coffee, the same could be said for the taste with a slight tinge from the hops in the immediate aftertaste with a lingering bitterness. A good drinker with medium body and the right amount of carbonation to make a smooth stout."
"Musings: A wonderful stout. Look, nose, taste and feel - everything top notch."
"This is a stout you can put away in quantity, but it tastes like a porter. Almost a stand-in for Great Lakes Edmund Fitz?"
"Took bottle from the fridge and poured directly into my glass. Completely black even when held up to a bright light, with a big brown pillowy head. About 1/4 inch of head remained all the way to the bottom of the glass with nice lacing. Smell of hops coming through along with the roasted malt. I found that I liked the initial smell more than the smell as I took a drink, though. Taste was great with a very slight hop bite and really no sweet malts - only roasted malts. Light/medium carbonation gave this one a nice mouthfeel."
"My wife thinks she sees brown, i say it's just black, no matter what it's dark and looks appealing. Thin brown head that caps this one off. Cocoa smell with some coffee bitterness in the background. Taste is also of cocoa. It also has a very earthy taste and mouthfeel. Almost feels a little bit gritty on the tongue. Finishes smooth and mild. Overall a nicely balanced beer. Very clean and simple which in this case is a good thing. Very drinkable. While I enjoy a hop or alcohol bomb, it's also nice to be able to find a good clean beer that isn't over the top but very well done."
"Generally, this is a very well dones stout and I would definitely purchase it again."
"Pours a dark, black/brown color with only a hint of red highlights on the edges. Thin head of medium sized brown bubbles. Aroma is very roasty and sweet, with a hint of soy sauce. Pleasurable taste with a heavy sweetness balanced by roasted grains. This stout definitely achieves its dark color with a heavy dose of dark crystal malt. Just enough chocolate malt and roasted barley to keep this from being too sweet. Aftertaste is were the chocolate malt truly shines. Almost a milk chocolate finish, fades into bitterness. Creamy mouthfeel, most likely from the oats. Great stout."
"D: An easy drinker. Impeccable balance. Shakespeare Stout is always in my rotation of beers and this it never disappoints."
"The pour produced a jet-black with a thin, caramel-colored head that subsided to about half its original two-finger size. Small amount of retention at the top of the glass. The smell is of lightly burnt malts, toasted nuts, and light-bodied chocolates with a hint of coffee. These flavors also come through in the taste, with a mildly bitter finish that pairs with a smooth sweetness. Delicious. The pleasant bitterness lingers. A very drinkable stout, and one of many great beers by Rogue."
"Poured into my pint glass this stout had a dense light coffee colored head and intense black color. I really liked the contrast of the head and beer. Toasty chocolate and hops in my nose. Some acidic coffee as well. Taste is hoppy chocolate. Very nice. The coffee comes through here as well, but the bitter hops dominate. Mouthfeel is very chewy but dry. Finishes clean for being such a big beer. I finished two bombers in a sitting and could have honestly gone for a third. A great beer."
"Drinkability: Good. Slow drinker. Rather hoppy for an everyday brew."
"Drinkability - While quite hoppy for a stout, the bitterness matches the dark chocolate perfectly. Drank this with a very rich chocolate/cherry dessert and the flavors were an amazing match. Fantastic."
"Cheers!"
"Medium-light body and very smooth. Quite drinkable with some nice complexity but nothing that really stood out to me."
"I guess it is sad that with my love of stouts and porters I have never tried the Rogue Shakespeare Stout before, I guess I should be a little ashamed of that because I usually see it at Olivers whenever I stop in. Well it was on tap last evening so I thought I would give it a try. Well I was not disappointed at all; actually I think it opened my eyes to what a superb beer this is. I was floating; my wife could tell by the way the beer went down, extremely tasty. The brew was poured to a black color; not sure any light would make it through but did not really look that deeply. Had a very nice dark brown head that had great retention and left nice lace rings down the side of the glass. The aroma is very inviting with a nice mixture of scents. I am picking up chocolate, coffee, roasted to burnt malt, brown sugar sweetness, and a pronounced (by pronounced, I mean stronger than the normal Stout but in no ways does it dominate) hop smell for a stout. The taste is simply incredible, extremely smooth through out, chocolate flavors up front that break to a coffee like taste that mixes nicely with the hops in the back end top give it the perfect amount of bitterness. This was the highlight of the evening, simple a great beer and one that I will have on a steady rotation at the house here, man I can not believe what I have been missing!"
"Poured into a Rogue pint glass. Very opaque black with a thin somewhat dark head that was somewhat diminishing and lest spotty lacing. Aroma was everything I'd expect in a stout but just a little more complex. Taste was very much in tune with a good stout, definite characteristics of rich chocolate and coffee with the necessary presence of roasted barley. Mouthfeel was somewhat on the heavy side for a 6% beer, however, this is a great warmer for a cold winter night."
"I would definitely recomend this stout to everyone. You will enjoy it immensely."
"Pours a dark brownish coffee color with a decent creamy head. This is a very good stout. Lots of malt and coffee on the nose. Taste is malty with coffee, chocolate and a hint of fruit. Very bold with a great body. An excellent stout. Perfect for those cold winter nights."
"Drink-Ability: This is just one of those brews that you cant put down till the end."
"22 oz bottle from sam's liquor in chicago. Pours black with dark brown fluffy head. Nice roasted coffee and dark chocolate aroma that mingled with the aroma of cascade hops. The mouth feel wasn't what I expected with it having oatmeal as one of the ingredients. Nice lacing down the glass. Had a bit of a smokey, phenolic flavor (is it infected?). I expected more of a dark chocolate flavor. An interesting beer. There are other stouts I'd buy over this, but it was very drinkable all the same."
"True to its name, this one's a classic. Tons of flavor and silky smooth on the palate, making this stout highly drinkable."
"D: Exceptional. I could drink this stuff all night. This is a truly unique stout. I used to drink this on tap when I lived in Oregon, and now that I'm on the East Coast I usually have to settle for 22 oz bombers, but this stout never disappoints, on tap, nitro, bottle, whatever. Very much recommended."
"Of the two brews, I preferred the Shakespeare (although the Yeti was indeed delicious). As I recall, this beer paired nicely with Gouda cheese."
"Mouthfeel is roasty, full bodied, rich, mildly bitter, along with moderate carbonation and a semi-dryness."
"A very balanced drinkable stout with a hop profile you don't usually come by in stouts. Full flavor and rich ingredients most of been used to balance out the 69 IBU's."
"Now the low points of the beer. The mouthfeel of this particular bottle isn't what I thought it should be for a stout. A bit thin, and the carbonation was way too high for my tastes. Unfortunately, this attribute brought down the drinkablity in my book (but I did drink the whole bomber). Definitely worth a try. Pretty good example of the style."
"drinkability is great. alcohol is well balanced, even if the bitterness is a little high."
"This is a good beer, but this glass was not outstanding. I'll give it another try before I say it may be overrated."
"D: Nice beer, quite aggresive. 22oz's is just about all I'd prefer to do. Not sure how well this beer would go with food."
""
"Poured from a 22oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured an opaque black, with a 1 inch dark mocha head, that left decent lacing on the glass. The aroma is of chocolate and roasted malts. The taste is much like the aroma, roasted malts and light chocolate, being the most detectable. This is one of thee best stouts available IMO. The mouthfeel is thick, like a stout should be. A very drinkable beer!! This is what I picture a stout should taste like. Thankyou Rogue for making this brew available year round."
"Drinkability - this is excellent. It's very rich, hearty, tasty, and satisfying, and since it's only 6 % abv, it's also entirely sessionable."
"Too often do stouts just not hit home with me, but Rogue knows how to do them. This and their Chocolate Stout are standouts among American craft brews."
"The taste is where this really shines, baking chocolate, coffee, subtle nuttiness, and a caress of hops in the finish. Very nicely done."
"Very enjoyable stout. At first, I was not overly impressed by it, but as I made my way through the first few swigs, it rounded out to be a very tasty pour."
"this beer comes in at 4-5% alcohol by volume."
"Drinkability: A good, drinkable stout, but not as rich and creamy as many stouts available."
"I forgot that I had this beer. I remembered today, and I'm glad. Holy shit. It has a nice licorice chocolate malt smell. It has a great head that just won't leave and retention that I can't get off. The mouthfeel is crisp and full. This is pretty easy to drink. A great cold weather brew."
"Caution...failry bitter and slightly acidic. If you have acid-reflux, make sure you have some Tums ready."
"O: An orgy of roasted malts. Nothing is overly extreme about this brew, but I feel that the body doesn't support the strong roasted character. A subtle sweetness is present, and the body is a bit light but neither are enough to fully support the resinous/citrus hop and roasted malts. Still, I could drink the hell out of this. Thanks again, Rogue!"
"A solid stout that is surprisingly drinkable. One of the best stouts I have had to date."
"Excellent finish and great flavors make this a simply excellent stout"
"Overall a good stout, but I find myself finding the standard stout less and less likeable over the years and finding imperial and Russian stouts much more interesting."
"pours a very deep black, not as thick/inky-looking as some stouts. thin chocolate brown head appears, and quickly gives way to a thin ring that lingers. smell is heavy in hops and roasted malts, with only faint hints of chocolate and coffee. the taste is surprisingly big compared to the smell. very sweet up front, with a big hops kick at the finish. sweet chocolate and coffee flavors are immediately apparent, with a heavy roasted taste lingering after the swallow. the hops content is a surprise here, as it seems to be significantly higher than i've come to expect in a stout. it's a wonderful addition, though, adding a slight citric refreshing quality to the beer. this is an absolutely wonderful stout."
"I went to the Weinhouse in Asheville to look around. The kind salesman asked me what kind of beers I liked and I told him that I liked dark beers. He recommend Shakespeare Stout to me. After drinking it I liked it so much I decided to learn more about it on the internet. Some how I followed links to this website and the rest is history."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and slightly creamy. I think I would have liked it to be a bit creamier, but still very enjoyable with dessert. I have yet to go wrong with a Rogue beer. Good stuff."
"Slainte!"
"D-I like this stuff.I think im getting a taste for Stouts and this stuff in a great example.Very Good.Highly Recommended.This is a very easy stout."
"Served in a pint glass, the Shakespeare Stout pours a very, very dark brown with a tan head. Decent lacing with this beer. It smells like chocolate, roasted malt, coffee and a bit of hops. It tastes the same way to me, except that the coffee/bitter chocolate taste is strong, and it finishes with a bitter aftertaste. It's full bodied, and the mouthfeel is nice and creamy. The drinkability is high too, it's good and smooth. Another great beer from Rogue, I'd recommend it to any stout lovers out there."
"ive had this beer many times and i definitely recommend it to anybody who loves stouts"
"Love this beer, and was really excited to get it on site at Rogue for a taste. Creamy tan head won't go away--even on the second draft I had in a plastic cup. Chocolate on chocolate in the nose and taste, and smooth and creamy big malt makes it a very easy beer to drink for as good as it is. Maybe my favorite American stout after Storm King."
"Got this one in a 22oz bottle. Poured a nice thick black color with a brown head, which stayed until the bottom. Smelled of chocolate and some spice. When it first hits your taste buds you immediately notice the sweetness and malt, some roastiness as well. The aftertaste is best noted with hops. Its a medium bodied brew with light carbonation, perfect for this style, could use a little more body though. Overall its a great stout with not too high ABV so not too difficult to drink."
"Poured a nice black color with a tan colored head leaving pretty good lacing. Smell was roasty, chocolate-y, and hoppy as well. Taste was full of chocolate upfront, followed by a roasty and hoppy finish. Mouthfeel was a little less than full bodied, with medium carbonation. Certainly a good beer worth a visit once in a while, I just don't seem to pick it up that often. Pretty much a must try, and should be widely available enough, that this is no problem."
"Poured from 22 oz. bottle. Jet black with light caramel head. Aroma had a hint of coffee and chocolate. Very smooth beer, and the mild chocolate aftertaste was great. Wasnt a very sweet chocolate, but rather bitter. Guinness was basically the only other stout I had tried before this one, and I must say this was an eye-opener. Excited to try more now."
"Pours a dense opaque black with a nice three finger head that dissipates slowly. Has a chocolaty smell, but more of a coffee taste at first that gives way to a chocolaty finish. Temperature plays a key role here, takes on an edginess if too cold. This one is just right and so smooth. After the too chilled bottle yesterday I was partial to their Chocolate Stout. Now, I just don't know."
"The only negative thing I can say about this stout is that it is a bit pricey. I paid around $4.25 for a 22 oz. bomber. But I wouldn't hesitate to pay it again to enjoy this beer."
"This is a very fine beer. It pours very dark, black brown, dark tan head. It has a very sweet smell to it, yet the taste is somewhat bitter. Very good flavors, its toasty, chocolaty, hoppy. Very drinkable. Tastes similar to Rogue's chocolate stout, but it is more bitter."
"Full bodied, smooth as silk and very drinkable. Another kick ass beer from Rogue."
"Another find at PDQ market, Rockland. Pours pitch black, not even direct sunlight can penetrate through. Smells very roasty and coffee like Tastes like unsweetened cocoa, burnt malt and a nice dry sensation. Overall...good. I like. Can't drink one after another but this is what Guiness drinkers should be drinking."
"Black opaque body with thick tan head, looks similar to the bar harbor. More mild than many stouts, but still more hoppy than I like my stouts. Roasted malt and hop permeate the scent and taste. Fairly full-bodied. Its good,but I think their mocha porter might be better."
"Overall: I once had a Rogue beer that I didn't like at all, so I decided not to drink rogue beers, after reviewing the Rogue reviews on BA, I decided to give them a try again. I am glad I did, this was a great beer, and one I will enjoy again and again."
"Although I like this brew. I was expecting a little more from this stout. Make no mistake I will continue buying this brew."
"Mouthfeel is a tad more carbonated than I would like but still good and I could drink this stuff all night. A very solid stout that I do not purchase enough."
"This pours an opaque brown-black with a smooth tan head and ample lacing. The smell has overtones of coffee and chocolate. The taste is creamy, with toasty malt, chocolate, coffee, a hint of plums, and just a tiny whiff of hops. The flavors blend artfully together. The mouth feel is rich, creamy, and smooth. This is a fine stout and I'm really glad to have found this on tap(at the Arcadia Cafe)in the Twin Cities."
"Mouthfeel- Thick and full-bodied, yet moments of thinness- which make this just a bit easier to drink."
"D - A great sessionable stout."
"Poured pitch black with a light brown head a lots of lacing. Smells a bit like a combination of caramel, chocolate and coffee but the malts dominate. Taste is excellent, roasted malts dominate but there is a hint of black coffee at the finish. Nice mouthfeel, just a bit lighter than some other american stouts but enjoyable none the less. In terms of drinkability this beer is great. The ABV isn't too high and with such a great taste I really can't give this any lower score. Overall this is an excellent interpretation of the style and I would highly reccomend this to anyone who enjoys stouts."
"D- I solid stout."
" Wavz"
"Overall: I am not too taken back with this beer. I have had many better stouts in my time. As with most Rogue offerings, I think it might be just a little over rated. This is the firts bottle I have had in over a year. I think it will be over a year before I have another bottle. It is not bad, just mediocre."
"Thank you Rogue for blessing us with this quintessential American Stout. It will always be one of my favorites."
"Very nice, a flawless example of the style. Its complex, rich yet very drinkable and features a lengthy and very satisfying finish. Highly recommended."
"Beer as comfort food ? An exceptional ""everyday"" stout."
"Poured an absolutely pitch-black color with impressive tannish head. Modest lacing. Smell is a complex mixture of bitter chocolate, coffee, dark fruit, roasted malt, and burnt toast. Flavor has all the ingredients of the smell and is nicely balanced by a firm hoppy bitterness. Rich, full, creamy mouthfeel. Very drinkable. An excellent beer for a cool autumn evening."
"Pours dark brown, almost black with creamy tan head which it retains very well. It leaves some lacing on the glass. Smells of roasted malts and fruity sweetness. Taste is chocolate and fruits and the alcohol is faintly noticeable. Full bodied with moderate carbonation. This is a good one."
"D- flavors increase as brews warms, and i would recommend savoring this brew. mouthfeel is amazing. well done brew, a must enjoy."
"Overall, I'd say this is an excellent stout, and one of the better year-round offerings from Rogue."
"Wow!!!! A fullbodied stout with significant notes of coffee and roasted flavors. Like I've stated before, Rogue hit the nail on the head when they tackled stouts...definetly in my top 5 of american/english stouts...it's a treat if you can find it. and obviously if you can find it on tap, there is a noticeable different in the flavor, smell, and taste...having had both."
" I enjoyed this one. The burnt or charred notes gave it an almost porter-like feel. I found that to be a nice twist. Complex flavors and very drinkable."
"This is a fun stout that I've come back to a lot. It's no world class brew, but it's quality. Paired very nicely with my from-scratch Scharffen Berger brownies."
"Possibly Rogue's best beer, and one of the great examples of the ""American Stout"" style, Shakespeare Stout deserves every accolade heaped upon it. The only thing bothering me about this beer is the typeface used for the word ""stout"" on the bottle. The ""T"s are too thin, the ""O" too wide. Fix the lettering, don't change the beer."
"This beer presents itself well and doesn't dissapoint. The entire beer goes down easy with plenty of flavor. It's also armed with a bouquet of dark aromas. I highly recommend this one."
"Jet black in color, frothy caramel colored head. Rich chocolaty and roasted coffee aroma, quite sweet and creamy. The tasted is quite creamy and chocolaty as well, with a lot of roasted coffee flavor. there is almost a hint of sherry and/or dark cherries before the sweeter malt flavor comes through.Right sticky mouthfeel. Bready, almost like burnt toast like after taste that I liked. Definitely full bodied, but pretty damn drinkable becasue it tastes to good."
"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber. The appearance is pitch black. No light gets through this beer. A small light brown head goes down to being a very thin layer across the top. The smell is of roasted malt and coffee and maybe something sweet like caramel. The taste is immediately of roasted malt and coffee but not at all overpowering. Some hops bitterness in the aftertaste. Fairly smooth mouthfeel with light carbonation. Thicker than Guinness but thinner than other stouts I've had. This beer sits rather heavy but is still quite drinkable. Overall, a nice stout but 22 oz. is my limit due to the heaviness."
"Drinkability: A well-balanced American stout. Very nice."
"Oh well, nothing lost, it was a $3.99 bomber. To each his own, just not to my liking."
"D: A solid stout, dunno as its best bang for the buck, but enjoyable every now and again."
"Pours from the big Rogue bottle to an opaque black, with thick, dark tan head that lingers and then receeds to very good lacing. Aroma was not real strong, but chocolate and roasted coffee was evident. Taste was more of the same, but not as sweet as I had expected. Finish was nice and smooth. overall, a good tasting, stout that was pleasant from start to finish."
"The hops are a bit too much for my personal taste, but if you like hops, you will love this stout. Nice change of pace, but I will probably not make this one a regular purchase."
"Pours jet black, with a minimal dark khaki head that dissipates to a dusting. Great aroma, with rich, burnt malts, coffee grounds, caramel sweetness and citric hops intermingling. At lower temperatures, there's a pronounced ""sour stout"" note, as well as bracing malt bitterness. At higher temperatures, these edges soften considerably, leaving caramel, coffee, nice citrus hop bitterness, and mouth filling carbonation. Brilliant. Great mouthfeel, medium with an enticing dryness (this isn't a sugarbomb). Very drinkable at 6 percent ABV, and a party in your mouth. Deservedly an underground classic amongst the beer geeks."
"Highly recommended - a fine stout."
"Heavenly and boy am I ever glad to again have access to it!"
"It's drinkability it good, despite the fact that you can really only session one (tops two) of these at a time. The answer to that? One is all you need. 6% ABV didn't seem like alot until about 10 minutes after I finished it, when this issue was resolved for me. Very enjoyable, very drinkable, and very warming. It's the perfect drink if you want high flavor but the humbleness of your beverage to blend in to what else is going on around you (Food, friends, etc.). Not much wrong here, not much at all. Can't wait to try this gem on tap."
"Looking back on my experience with beer over the past several years and drinking this today, I realized my proudest moment was probably when I tried to clone this--and it came out exactly the same. For one day, I played tennis with the gods."
"Black as pitch, hazelnut colored head with great lacing. Smells like coffee with some noticeable hops. Sweet upfront giving way to massive roasted flavors, bitter chocolate, coffee, fruity esters, underlying caramel all balanced by fantastic hops. Hop character and flavor becoming noticeable through the finish, green and citrusy, but always balanced. Amazing balance in this beer. Mouthfeel is full, and this is very drinkable. Great beer."
"notes- this stout does lack the complexity of some others but it is all in all a solid offering."
"Overall a fantastic stout. This would go great with a nice thick stew on a winter night. Would also be a nice compliment to a dessert that included vanilla. Enjoy this one as a great example of the style."
"Creamy mouthfeel and I thought it had pretty good drinkability. I'm don't have a lot of experience with stouts, but I thougt this was very good, just not the best I've had."
"D = Drinkable."
"Drinkability is a bit hampered, only because of how heavy this beer sits in your tummy. It's fantastic. But just a sipping beer."
"I poured my Shakespeare Stout from a 750ml bottle. It appeared pitch-black in the glass with a nice tan head. The aromas were of chocolate, but a little sweet. No sweetness was there when I drank it. Very thick and velvety. Tastes of coffee and unsweetened chocolate. Pretty dry and bitter finish. Extremely nice. A dessert in itself."
"Concluding, this is a top-notch stout...a must have!"
"Rogue is a great brewery for sure. I could drink a few of these at one sitting."
"indulge me while i tell a story. back in 1999 while a junior at auburn i was coming back to birmingham from tuscaloosa after the iron bowl. auburn had just won the game and the temperature was in the 30s and sleeting all game long. needless to say we were soaked. we stopped in a sports bar which consistently has the best selection in birmingham. i knew nothing about craft beer but knew i liked good beer when i could find it. we all ordered each other something different from the menu for fun. my friend ordered me a shakespeare. as the bartender poured it into my glass, i couldn't believe it, i haven't been the same since. this was when rogue bottled it in 12 oz. bottles instead of the bombers. now we can no longer get this beer in alabama b/c of the container size. thanks, taylor and FREE THE HOPS!"
"D - Very drinkable. This is a very tasty stout from Rogue, would highly recommend."
"D: Very drinkable, the hops are not too strong (like their Impy Stout) but they provide a nice presence."
" Shakespeare stout is very black in color with a nice brown head. The head is longlasting and leaves behind some lacing. The smell is mainly of roasted malt. The taste is very roasty with a hint of dark chocolate. It is medium to full bodied with a lingering aftertaste. It's a good thing that it comes in a bomber because 12 ounces just isn't enough. Great Beer!!"
"A really solid offering from Rogue."
"D: I'm a huge fan of stouts and a huge fan of Rogue but this is the first time that I've had one that I didn't really want to finish. It's not a bad tasting beer, but it's a bad tasting stout if that makes any sense. Not something I would pour out but definatly not something I would want when I am in the mood for a stout. This is basically a stout made with the hopheads in mind."
"..this sharp asperity in the finish ruins an otherwise creamy and smooth drink and IMHO keeps it from going into the 4+ scoring"
"An incredible American Stout, and one that I highly recommend."
"It's very nice to see Rogue finally getting decent distribution in my local area. I was very pleasantly surprised to see 3 Rogue offerings on tap @ a very good mostly vegetarian restaurant(Sunspot) that I try to frequent in Knoxville. I can sum this beer up in 3 words: My new favorite, it is outstanding in every regard. It pours a dark opaque black with a dark tan head, and very resilient lacing. The nose is excellent with molasses, coffee and caramel the dominant aromas. The taste surpassed the smell which I tought would be tough to do. The mouthfeel was robust and viscous, which allowed the unbelievable taste to linger. Excellent drinkability for such a hearty beer. All things considered, this stuff rocks."
"Overall one of the best stouts I have had. A true treat and I will definitely be trying this one again."
"Overall: An excellent stout, with bold roasted flavors and excellent drinkability."
"This is a delicious stout, with its own West coast interpretation of the style."
"D- Very smooth from the malt and crisp from the hops. Not very creamy so it goes down very easily. I'm surprised at the 6%abv, from the taste I expected more."
"Outstanding beer."
"Poured from a bomber into an imperial pint glass, very deep black with no light coming through, even around the edges, two fingers of creamy beige head that vanishes a little too quickly, some scattered lacing. Nose is suprisingly full of flowery hops which are overlaid over a nice roasted espresso and powdered cocoa aroma. Taste has a nice smooth espresso taste upfront coupled with a slight sweet malt and oatmeal flavor, and then finishing with a nice dose of floral hops. The aftertaste is a blend of coffee goodness and hop bitterness that just leaves you wanting more. I enjoy hoppy stouts, even though generally the hops really dominate the roast, but this is an absolute perfect blend. Full bodied, creamy, and smooth, this is a pleasure to drink. Because of the balance, the great texture, and the fairly low ABV, the only limiting factor on how much I could drink is the price of these bombers. Really wish I could get these in 12 oz servings."
"Bomber. Pours a deep black, some red on the edges, thick tan head, lots of lace and great retention. Smell is roasty, lots of chocolate, floral hops and caramel, pretty intense. Taste is sweet, lots of chocolate, grains, roast, floral, coffee and caramel. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, and a dry grainy finish. A good dry stout."
"I like to mix 'em up (start with a bitter and work up to darker and thicker) so it's a BIG closer for that method."
"D - Wow, it is very good. But because it is such a heavy beer I can't imagine having more than one in a sitting especially with a meal."
"Drinkability- The more I had the better it tasted. Could drink a couple if there was nothing else to drink. Didnt mind it but not the best."
"Kind of heavy--I felt full after the whole bottle. I don't even want to think of how many calories this liquid bread has! *grin*"
"Overall it's not very complex and a little one-sided and easy to drink beer. I will try another before I kick this one to the curb."
"Shakespeare Stout pours black with a tan head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. Nice aroma, hops are definitely peaking through the malt. Flavor includes nice chocolate and coffee notes as well as some hops. Creamy mouthfeel. This is a classic. Highly recommended."
"Pours a deep dark black with a tan head that leaves nice lacing lasting the duration of the entire drink. Dark roasted malt is followed by a nice hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is a little lighter than I expected. The balance of this brew is tremendous. It really is an excellent beer that is an excellent American stout."
"Slight pucker to mouthfeel brings this baby home. Very enjoyable. Must have more!!"
"Note to Self: Ranked the #5 American Stout when I tried it."
"Drinkability: Would make a nice Black and Tan with perhaps a Grimbergen Dubbel."
"D: Extremely enjoyable, tasty stout. It's one that's in the regular rotation of fine stouts available to me, must have on a weekly basis at least once. Definitely recommended."
"A good beer but quite dry and astingent, this is brought out even more by the seemingly high carbonation. Dryness is also probably due to a highly attenuated yeast."
"This is a great, complex stout to have as a dessert drink."
"Notes: A big stout in every way but alcohol content. Big-bodied, big-flavored. A good choice any time of the year, but I suspect it would really hit the spot when the weather gets cold."
"This is a great stout-- one I will not wait to revisit for so long again!"
"Served from a bomber , into a pint , this stout poured an opaque black with a solid , tan , creamy head of an inch. Aroma is creamy and roasty , with some hop in there and tinge of creamed coffee. Taste is creamy and rich , yet not overpowering. Semi-sweet chocolate , coffee and roasty malt tones with a bit of nicely balancing hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is creamy. This stout from rogue is a great one. Awsomely balanced and very drinkable."
"Medium to full body, slighly creamy, with low carbonation. Perfectly balanced, and has everything you would want in the style. One of my pantry staples."
"That's my 500th review. Looking forward to the next 500! :D"
"Drinks well at just below room temp."
"Pours a deep black with a minimal tan head. The chocolate malts that are used in processing are definitely apparent in the smell, which emits coffee as well. Taste is just sensational, with a smooth, creamy flavor and somewhat bitter and sour finish. Right up there with Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout as my favorites of the genre..."
"After I finished the formal part of my review, I finished off the bomber with a grilled burger topped with onions, green pepper and gouda cheese  paired with the food, the experience bordered on transcendent."
"You can't judge a beer by its bottle, but looking at this beer you can figure it will be tasty. I opened this beer and started to pour it into a glass and found it to have a very nice, very rich dark brown (almost black) color and a VERY nice light brown head. the head was thick and lasted for quite some time and left a heavy lace throughout the drink. As I havent drank many stouts, I was unfamiliar with the aroma but once I tasted the beer I realised what the smell meant and found it to be enjoyable. And as for the taste. this was a fantastic beer. very complex. it had a nice bold flavour without being overpowering. It was a relativly easy beer to drink, but I would imagine one bomber is about all I would want to drink at a time. not cause it gets old, but because it is a slow drink and leaves you full and satasfied. overall, I would recomend picking up a bottle you can get your hands on as it is one of the best stouts I have ever had."
"I will definitely have many more pints of this. It was very easy to drink. By far the best stout I've had so far."
"Drinkablity: I enjoyed the beer, however I am not a coffee drinker and I thought this beer was more coffee than beer."
"Drinkability: This is a ridiculously easy to consume beer. Just outright good, but at over 5% ABV, one must enjoy in moderation. I bought one bomber for $4.99 (a good deal IMO) and found another at a grocery store for $4.49 (an even better deal). One I will definitely purchase again."
"I can't argue that this is a very good beer, but I don't find it quite living up to the hype. It sure does go down smooth though, and I have nothing against having a bomber of this in my fridge."
"One of Rogue's best creations, no doubt. Utterly enjoyable in every way."
"It looked really good (pitch black with dark tan foam) but the aroma and flavor seemed weak. I tasted burnt malt, not strong enough to be offensive. I can't really see why this is highly rated by so many people. I probably won't get it again."
"Smooth and creamy, easy drinking. This is a great stout and I can definitely see me doing it again."
"This beer poured a deep black with a huge tan head. There is not a lot of lacing. The smell is grain and a small amount of bitterness. The taste is similar to a porter. There is a roasted flavor. The smootheness is not as good as I would like. The drinkability is ok but I think there are better options if I want a stout. Overall, a decent beer that is average for the style."
"Very black in appearance with a frothy tan head. Smells of slightly charred malt with a tinge of hops. Mouthfeel is full, smooth and creamy. Taste is charred malt with overtones of chocolate and coffee. Hoppiness is fairly subdued but balances out the malt so that there's no overbearing sweetness. Very tasty and a pleasure to drink."
"mouthfeel is full, thick but very smooth. drinkability is great except for the pricetag."
"Very drinkable at 6%. This would make a great session stout."
"Overall: A straight-up, solid stout. This is the real deal, darkly maltly with plenty of coffee/malt flavor. Excellent representation of the style, but not my favorite."
"This beer definitely lived up to its hype for me. Definitely my favorite American stout. The fact that it's easy to find makes it that much better. I will be enjoying this one regularly for now on."
"I tasted this at cellar temperature. This pours very smoothly and it's hard NOT to get a SIZABLE coffee-coloured head, thick and crackling slowly. Fine lacing that clung very quickly and securely. Swirling makes the edges of the head go even darker and almost light red. Like the Chocolate stout this is almost completely ebony, with only hints of blue near the edges. Incredibly opaque, too, as holding it right next to the computer screen shows no light. Solid appearance. Oats and bacon on the nose at first, almost more porter-like initially. Hickory smoke and beef jerky, with nice hop notes that seem to come in waves...sometimes there, sometimes not. Good malting that is grainy and full of licorice and tobacco. Some milky notes and plenty of salinity. Other notes of nuts, charcoal, blackberry, and black coffee. The alcohol is nose-tickling and fairly detectable. Sweet dark candy whiffs too occasionaly. Sticky sourish and salty malts on the tongue and plently of charcoal. Big and meaty. Fuller in body than their Chocolate stout. Lots of gristy dustiness in the finish. Some fruits in the middle too, dark and old, like dried dates or prunes. A little chocolate, but more coffee than anything. A good balance, but nothing out of the ordinary. Good full body and plenty of lingering bitterness. Could drink it rather quickly and easily. This compared to the Chocolate Stout? Weaker aroma but fuller taste. I have rated this in style and with disinterest, but I fail to see this as ""outstanding."" A good beer, yes. A little bit let-downish though for its rating. I was expecting more."
"I'm not sure what to say. This is (and the chocolate stout) are the only stouts I have liked. Very dark color, good head, smooth, tasted like I think a stout should taste. I must make the comment length longer, so I am adding this sentence to make my comment longer. I really have no other thoughts on this beer. I will be buying again though."
"Black in color with a thick one plus inch carmel brown head. Smells of hops, malt and notes of chocolate and oatmeal. A roasted, malty taste with a nutty, hoppy, and chocolatey finish. An incredibly drinkable beer that was not heavy. The head stayed with the beer throughout. I will definately have more of this and I look forward to it..."
"As I got farther into this bottle I fell in love with this stout more and more. It is fantastic. Each sip was better right to the bitter end. Buy this now if you can, you wont regret it."
"Huge roasty flavor. Delicious. Big coffee overtones and big malt. A pleasure to drink."
"This beer is pretty much pitch black, with a medium brown head. Head retention is on the low side. The nose is on the light side, surprisingly so, with moderate roasted malts and a trace of hops. Good roast and hops up front, leading right into a welcome bitterness.Coffee and roast feature on the aftertaste. This is not your typical coat-the-palate, throw-a-bunch-of-burnt-malt-in-it stout. The hops add a welcome dimension to this beer. Stylistically, Shakespeare Stout falls short on appearance and aroma but is otherwise pretty much spot-on. Solid."
"One to take your time with an fully enjoy."
"This was my first tasting of this beer and I was very impressed. I can't wait to pick up some more."
"A bit chewy feel to it. Drinkability is phenomenal. Could drink it all night."
"I could drink a bunch of these, and while I like stouts, stouts aren't my go-to style. Highly recommended."
"A very sound stout."
"Chocolate stout that is smooth and creamy..has a bitter finish at the end of each sip reminding you that it is a Stout and also a Rogue product. Black dark malty with a full nose of hops and wonderful creamy head..highly drinkable and a great apertif with chocolate."
"M & D: Very silky smooth but thicker than I thought it was going to be. I could definately drink a bunch of these if I had them. Good carbonation but low enough that the malts break through making them the main feature for this stout."
"Hands down a Grade A stout from Rogue, and probably the best beer I can get in WV. 6% abv limit really sucks."
"Overall not a bad stout. I think that if you like this style of beer, you would like this beer. Does it deserve to be in the top 25 or 30 on the best beer list? I'm not sure."
"D - high, this is a great stout, im very impressed, it had me fooled the whole time, cant wait to have it again"
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink and good in all respects. No part of this brew is overbearing, adding to the easy quaffability."
"D: Great session stout. Tons of flavor without too much alcohol. Easy and enjoyable to drink and priced fairly."
"I'm not much of a stout person, but this is a good one."
" The taste is lighter and more fluid on the tongue than I was expecting and seems overcarbonated, reducing the purity of the taste for me. Smoothness, however, is a big plus. Coffee and malt are among the main contributors but the flavor is not as rich or aggressive as some stouts I've had recently and a nice changeup. The balance is still nice and holds it up to the obvious appeal of its exterior characteristics. Worthwhile when you can find it, it usually sells out fast near me."
"Very pleasing and enjoyable, drawing in the best features of roasted malts and oatmeal, with expertise in dropping in the right amount of bitterness. Fairly straightforward but easily sessionable. Great for that transition to or from winter, on a cool evening."
"This is good, I like it. Unlike a lot of their other beers, this one isn't laced with chocolate or chipotle or ham, which turns me off to some of their offerings. This is a good, solid, well-balanced stout that fits a nice cool spring evening. Mouthfeel is better than normal with this one, something I'm usually indifferent about. The taste is solid, with a healthy amount of roasty hops carrying it from front to back. Overall a good stout. Probably not as complex as some people like. But it's very good in its simplicity."
"D - very tasty stout, but I'm not blown away, and I usually am by Rogue products. Nice, well balanced, rich stout. But for the body of this beer, it would make a nice session drink."
"This is a stout that drinks like an imperial. A home run stout. Give me more."
"The body of the beer is excellent and balanced very well. I really like this beer and I will be getting more."
"Anyway, here's to a wonderful brew. And, to proof that my time spent learning about and trying different craft beers was truly worthwhile, since without such an effort I'd never again have tried this beer or most of the others I've enjoyed."
"I stumbled upon this at my local grocery store and was eager to bring it home and give it a try. It poured a deep black color with a very thick dark head. Aromas were of burt malts and coffee and a little chocolate. It had a very good flavor, intense coffee, chocolate and burnt malts, with a bitter little bite at the end. A very intense and flavorful beer, not for the average drinker!"
"This is a heavenly way to end the evening."
"D: I don't think that this is a world-class stout as Rogue markets it, but it is definitely a very good one. Recommended."
"Pours an absolutely jet black with a big deep tan head that builds to three fingers before dissipating slowly and leaving tons of lacing. Smells of burnt chocolate and caramels with the hops providing a bitter undertone. Taste has plenty of dark, roasted coffee and some chocolate indertones and a bitter hop kick in the finish. Earthy tones linger in the aftertaste, which goes on for ages. Mouthfeel is thick and full with plenty of carbonation, and drinkability is incredible. This is probably the most perfect example of just what a stout is supposed to be that I've ever had."
"A good body really supports the beer. A rich and smooth drink makes it very easy to enjoy. It would be a tragedy too miss out on this one."
"A solid stout with a near black appearance and a chocolate smell sure to please any chocoholic. It doesn't stop there: the taste of chocolate is prevelent in the taste (though not as strong as the beer's brother: Rogue chocolate stout) . There is a light coffee and slightly more noticeable caramel overtone. A rich, thick mouthfeel, it is a beer that you can drink as a session beer."
"One thing's for sure, this beer is sure making my employer angry! I've been drinking it all day! I'm addicted!!!"
"Taste; chocolate coffee as the nose indicated, with bits of rasins and licorice. There's also just a touch of soy sauce, but not to much so. I like the slight hop bitterness that keeps this from being overly sweet. Mouthfeel is just a touch thinner than I would have liked, but still pretty good, and this is very easy to drink."
"Overall, this beer is very drinkable. Highly recommended. A little different, but wonderful. I had this with some Ben & Jerry's ice cream [chocolate/vanilla] and it was amazing!!!"
"A very good stout. A gorgeous beer too. As I said, this is what a stout is supposed to look like. It just seems too simple to me. It could use more complexity and deeper flavor."
"The mouth is thick with a bit of an oily quality (and thats good!). Very easy drinker, would go great with deserts! A worthy tribute to Bard!"
"D: Quite drinkable and expertly crafted in nearly all areas. The stout provided a bit of warmth and hope to a night that was otherwise devoid of it. A fuller body would have been enjoyed, but perhaps this was merely an outcome derived from my keeping the beer in the fridge for too long."
"Mouthfeel for me is kinda bad. Feels way over carbonated for the style, and feels a bit astringent."
"I picked up a bottle of this because a bartender at my favorite bar that has this on tap right now told me everyone loved it and that he thought it was awesome too. I told him I wasn't impressed by it when I tried it once a year or so ago out of the bottle and didn't try it at the bar. I'm a little put off by the amount of carbonation and I prefer the sweeter stouts. I need to try this on draft at the bar now and see if there's any difference or if I just have different tastes than my bartender friend and all the other folks that think so highly of this stout. If the draft is different, I'll post another review."
"Overall a great beer, but i just dont see it as being so high on the top 100 beers. But a truly an excellent beer!"
"Pours jet black with a half inch of filthy head. Aroma is difficult to write about as it's incredibly intense and complex. Dark roasted malts come through, followed by molasses and some chocolate in the finish. Flavor is bursting with chocolate goodness. Slight bitter hop hint at the end. Finishes rather dry, as dry as an American stout can. This would be perfect served with a chocolate dessert, or simply sipped and enjoyed by itself. The oats do give it incredible smoothness. Still not incredibly heavy, mouthfeel is seemingly middle ground. But, wow, what a bomber for oneself!"
"Another good one from Rogue Ales. Nice dark color and head. Hint of chocolate and coffee. Slightly bitter taste and finish with a oaty flavor. Very good mouthfeel, not too heavily carbonated. Very balanced. Was having with a meal and went very well with what was servered...not too sweet, not to dry."
"Presentaion: Packaged in an enameled twenty-two ounce bomber with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Pretty drinkable and balanced but has a bitterness and citrusy hop zest that most stouts don't have. Nice."
"I have grown to love the offerings from Rogue, every one of their offerings I have had have been excellent examples of the styles and have been great tasting. This one is among my favorites."
"Another great beer from Rouge. Good example of the style. Great to have on a cold winters day."
"This is a top notch stout. I bought it as a substitute for Rogue Chocolate Stout, which I could not find at that time. It does very well for itself, though. Recommended!"
"flavor is big on roasty, black coffee, bitter chocolate and a long dry finish."
"Drinkability: I had this beer almost a year and a half ago, and I don't think my palate was ready for it. I was prepared to not bow to all the hype, but alas, this is some good stuff. It's not that it's going to wow you with flavors never savored, but it's certainly one of Rogue's best, and it's balanced, tasty, and has just the right amount of alcohol to not make itself apparent and not be an intrustion on the drinkability. I'll be drinking this again for sure."
"This is an oatmeal stout if I ever did taste one! it has rolled oats in it and is smooth as glass and chewy and sweet and delicious and everything an oatmeal stout is. This is not an American stout. Good stuff and I will attempt to find six packs of it. good good good."
"this one is a very good stout; all rogues seem so high quality, just a few ingredients and seems very natural and pure. good solid shit. problem with this one is its so rich and deep and heavy(despite low abv!) that although its a damn good beer in small doses its difficult to finish the bomber cause it becomes just too much after a while."
"This was the best Rogue Brewery offering that I've tried so far. It was a very dark brown shade with a small coffee-colored head. It had a very pleasant sweet roasted malt odor. The taste was coffee/grainy, with some hoppiness showing up afterwards. A good mouthfeel, not overpowering, and not much carbonation. Very drinkable, enjoyed it a lot."
"I found this to be a very drinkable stout whos flavor doesn't overpower the palate."
"A dark, midnight black color pours in the glass with a nice beige head that laces very nicely. The aroma of the dark malt and chocolate comes through on the first scent. Those aromas come through in the taste, and then more scents and flavors start to show themselves. Some coffee and hop flavor come through after the first intial swallow. A rich mouthfeel thick, like two percent milk in the consistancy, but is very smooth going down. This not a session beer by any means. The intense flavors and the rich mouthfeel, make this a wonderful sipping beer. This beer is a joy to have in a glass."
"Poured an opaque black from a 22oz bomber with a foamy, mocha-brown full two finger head that slowly gave way to moderate sticky beige lacing. Aroma is of dark chocolate,caramel, coffee, and a pleasurable roasted malt sweetness present as well. Taste is slightly sweet, mainly chocolate and dark roasted coffee, nice undertones of malt and caramel balance the bitterness. This stout is lighter bodied with lighter levels of carbonation well matched to the style. Goes down nice and smooth, finishes with a lightly bitter aftertaste. Overall a well done beer, smooth and refreshing, would purchase again."
"Drinkability: superbly drinkable stout, as the full robust flavors leave you wanting another taste quickly. A great stout everyone should seek out."
"Pours fairly black with a nice tan head. The smell is not very heavy, but I got pretty standard chocoalte and coffee with some resonable hops. Taste is nice and rich, with lots of chocolate and espresso, sweetness and hops to finnish. Mouthfeels if velvety and well balanced. Drinkability is high, but not too high. Good stuff."
"I love stouts and this is one of my very favorite. I will be drinking this whenever I get the chance."
"Dark black in color, like looking into space, with a thin beige head. Smells of coffee beans and tastes the same with a light chocolate quality. Very nice carbonated mouthfeel. Smooth finish with a slight aftertaste, almost like an espresso. I felt as if it were quite filling, almost a decadent beer, very rich in taste. I think this would be best served after dinner, or with a rich chocolate dessert. Overall, a delicious beer."
"from the bottle. poured black with a medium tan head. aroma roated malts jump right out there and than along comes the chocolate, some coffee, with a touch of hops. flavor not disappointing at all good strong roasted flavors with the chocolate taking first place a head of the malts did pick up some of the oats. good beer."
"Drinkability: They weren't lying when they put on the back of the bottle, ""Another World Class Ale from Rogue."" I'm sure as hell wouldn't mind having another bottle of this beer. Excellent Brew!"
"This is a classic stout. Not overly complex, no gimmicks, no weird additions. Simply fresh, delightful taste. Balance in a bottle. Highest recommendation."
"Than being said, I would definitely recommend this beer. I do however, have to question its relatively high ranking among beers within the same category that seem to be a notch above. Least of which is a cousin...Rogue's Chocolate Stout."
"D - Excellently balanced and superb taste and aroma make this one of my very favorite stouts. The Rogue folks are no joke ... this and the mocha porter are among the very best in their class. If you haven't had this, you need to ...NOW!"
"A great beer for my first review. Opened this up to celebrate the birth of my daughter. I quit all alcohol while the wife was preg and this was my treat afterwards. Perfect choice."
"Very drinkable, mild carbonation, full body. This beer got better as it warmed up to near room temperature, I highly recommend letting this beer warm up a lot."
"Poured a viscous dark, opaque black with a tan colored head that was thick, leaving behind quite a bit of lacing. Large, intense bubbles cover the surface, even after the head dissipates. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, smoke, dry sherry, and black coffee; just wonderful. Refreshingly smooth with dark chocolate flavors that start off subtle but grow more intense as the beer warms. The sweetness of the beer is never overpowering or all-encompasing. Hints of smoke and burnt sugar are just wonderful, adding great depth and flavor. Creamy and textured in my mouth, this beer has a dry and bitter finish, very much dominated by coffee/expresso flavors. All together, this beer works on every level and is a joy to drink. Try pairing this with gourmet dark chocolates or cheesake...just incredible!"
"Pretty drinkable but doesn't quite come all the way together for me. A good stout never the less"
"Draught at the Rogue Public House in NW Portland. Pours rich frothy head that looks similar to espresso. Dark ink black not allowing any light to pass through. Smells strongly of roasted malts, nice chocolate, and sweet cream. No hops are present in the aroma. I know they are in there, but the roast overpowers them. First taste is bitter, but not from hops, from roast. Almost astringent. Chocolate and espresso fill your mouth next, very nice, followed by a sharp almost harsh bitterness. Again from roast not hops. NIce full, rich, slick mouthfeel. Oily and coating, from the oats one can presume. I decided to sit on this for a while and let it warm up seeing as it was very cold from the tap. At first it seemed to bring out this harshness even more, but after a few drinks, it went away. It is so much better slightly below room temperature. Definite balance. A decent beer."
"I'm always on a quest for the smoothest, richest stout, and I think I may have just found it in Rogue's Shakespeare Stout."
"This thing is super slick on the palate. It's not chewy, but it's frothy, creamy and full. When you swallow there's almost nothing left behind. This is the first stout I've drank that begs me to drink deep. Take a big gulp, swish, swallow, take another big gulp, repeat... I had to stop myself repeatedly because I just wanted to chug this brew. I think the flavor could use some extra complexity and beefing up, and this really isn't the chewiest of stouts, but drinkable? Hell Yeah."
"Dark dark black color, with only a hint of red along the edges when you hold it up to the light. Moderate tan head with good lacing. Rich dark-chocolate aroma with sharp, peppery hops. Initially sweet taste of cocoa & coffee, slowly bittering up after a few moments, to finish dry and roasted. Good, full body but not heavy."
"Pours inky black with a large rocky latte-colored head of small, densely packed bubbles. I cannot see through the glass. Decent lacing is left as the glass is emptied. The smell is of deep roasted malts with hints of coffee as well. The taste is initially filled with a those same roasted malts along with touches of carbon, as if burned. It finishes with soft hops and is slightly drying. Medium bodied and relatively light on the tongue, the carbonation makes it a bit perky. Absolutely drinkable, and if you like roasty, toasty, carbony malts, you've found a perfect match."
"excellent mouthfeel. slides down the tongue very easily with the finish sticking around just long enough."
"Pours a dark ebony with a perfect tan head which leaves a whole lot of lacing. Nose is strong in the hop department for the style with subdued coffee tones in the background. Taste is pleasant but not overly interesting, Some good classic coffee notes, I didn't detect much chocolate. Mouthfeel is rich and the aftertaste is very nice and lingers, taste like the foam on top of a good mocha. Overall a pleasant stout but I think maybe I expected a bit more, I'll go back to this one day and see how it treats the second time around."
"Drinkability- My skinny ass needs more calories. So go beer for beer with Shakespeare."
"Cheers!"
"The taste leans more toward dark roast coffee with dark chocolate and figs. Fairly dry throughout and finishes with a lingering bitter coffee taste. Medium/full bodied, very easy to drink. Nice after dinner."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability - a good after dinner drink, I would have it again"
"Pours a deep dark black topped by a one-finger creamy tan head. Aroma of rich roasted malt, chocolate, espresso, and a touch of briny peat. Palate is dominated by dark roasted malt, accented by coffee, molasses, chocolate, with the lurking presence of amarillo hops poking through towards the finish. Body is simply luxurious - rich, creamy, and damn near perfect. I could drink this all night."
"D- This is a very good stout, which focuses on the malts and the hops are just for support. Very smooth and nice to drink but it still has good complexity and character."
"This beer is a pleasure to drink, so full of flavor and richjust wonderful."
"An absolute classic."
"This is a very dark oily beer with a creamy dark tan head. The smell is of dark chocolate and vanilla. The taste is very good, very dry and a bit bitter, not as sweet as I had expected. The mouthfeel is very smooth with good body. The carbonation is light. It is a very drinkable beer."
"A little thicker than other Stouts I've had, this was a very dark black/brown with a very small head. No retention whatsoever on the glass. I can only describe the appearance as ""creamy", if that makes sense; just as I described the Sam Smith's as watery. The aroma was wonderful, very dark fruit, malts, yeast, chocolate. Then I tasted it. The balance of really good ingredients and subtleties of flavor made this beer excellent in my mind. It started off with a sweet, dark fruit taste, hints of yeast, malt, chocolate and mild caramel faded into oatmeal. I definitely wasn't expectin the oatmeal but it only grew more intense as the glass warmed. It was smooth and creamy, warming and the bottom of the glass was as tasty as the first sip. Excellent brew."
"Mouthfeel is much more full than most commonly available stouts, although still thin in comparison to the big Imperial Stouts."
"Yes, this is where it's at. The best American Stout I have ever had. Pours out to a deep onyx, with a dark brown colored head of about 1/2 inch. Medium level of carbonation, but still higher than what's found in most American Stouts. Smell is heavenly; aromas of roasted malts and sweetended milk chocolate. Wonderful. Taste is full and delicious. Flavors of rich malts, sweet cocoa and chocolate, mild dark fruits, and a tame yeast element. Hints of wood and earth are also noted. Phenominal. Mouthfeel is smooth and exceptionally creamy. Drinkability is very high; even though this is thick and full bodied, this could be a daily brew for me in the winter months. World Class, and highly recommended."
"Poured pitch black with a 1/2"" head (room temperature); substantial, almost sticky in the mouth, with a lasting presence even after swallowing. Aroma could have been stronger, but the taste more than made up for it. Woody Roasted Malt first, followed by dark chocolate and coffee. Wonderful all around. I'd have a second, and maybe third, in a single sitting."
" This is one hell of a great stout and is one of my favourite brews of *any* style. Find it. Buy it. Enjoy it."
"This is a great stout. Goes well with sweets."
"The bottle pours a completely opaque black into the glass with ample head that holds nicely and laces beautifully down the entire glass. The beer has a great sweet smell to it with strong roasted malts. The beer tastes wonderfully of coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts. As it roams your mouth it feels thick and creamy and the carbonation is exceptional. Overall I could drink this beer all day, all night, for the rest of my life."
"Flavor is intense to say the least. Rich malty base with a spicy/acidic hoppy kick. Espresso bitterness with hints of slight chocolate sweetness."
"Pours black in color with a copper and tan creamy head that left spotty lacing. Smelled of smokey earthy coffee, some alcohol and hazelnut. Tastes of smokey campfire, roasted marshmallows and coffee with a nutty sweetness in the finish. Exhaling through the nose brings out a smokey maple campfire. Mouth feel is thin that compliments the flavor well. Im getting the feeling that I should try this one by the side of a campfire next time."
"This is what a stout should taste like. great mouthfeel, not too carbonated but not watery, just perfect. Nice roasted malt with chocolate dominate the falors in this classic."
"What a wonderful beer. Comes in 22 oz. size only, as far as I can tell. Pours black, with a big head for a stout. Smells great: coffee, chocolate, smoke, and a sweetness your nose can detect. And it tastes like it smells and is quite sweet, though it's thinner than I expected, thinner than Guiness. If it was thick, it'd be a perfect, if expensive, every day beer. $5 at Armanetti on Lincoln just south of Addison. Say hi to Dave."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: Dam I was surprised. I am not much of a rogue fan to begin with. This beer had a medium body. Over all a very tasty and drinkable beer."
"D: This stout is most different from all the English and Irish stouts I've tried, and more interesting and ''bold", but not as formidable as elegant for that matter. I'm really deeply impressed by this American stout, especially given that I missed the chance to try it on cask when working at the BSF bar in GBBF 05, though I did nick a quarter of a pint of Rogue's Chocolate Stout on cask which is immensely delicious as well. I'm gonna buy more of Rogue's dark ales whenever I see any! Good stuff."
"""I would give all my fame for a pot of ale..."" -- Henry V"
"On the bitter side of the stout spectum, dark malt bitterness. Would be fantastic with a nice hunk of beef."
"Great drinkability. Highly recommended for stout lovers."
"This is a rather fine stout. It ours a very nice dark color. The head was extensive, a tannish color, and relatively long lasting. The smell was certainly pleasant, with hints of the nice malts contained within. The taste was good, being nicley balanced, with leanings towards the malts: with the relatively low alcohol content the flavors were nic ey unmasked. The mouthfeel was a bit weak but certainly not dissapointingly so. I certainly recommend this stout. Enjoy!"
"Without being as weak as Guiness, the scores I gave for taste and drinkability are about the highest I will ever give a stout. I am not much of a stout drinker, but I definitely gained new respect for the name ""stout"". After drinking too many creamy, almost fluffy, stouts, I had forgotten how deep a beer's flavor can go. The bouquet was perfect and, even though it didn't fit my tastes, the flavor was very diverse, hitting the normal chocolate and coffee a stout brings, but also hiding a hint of honey. Definitely the highlight of my night."
"Drinkability is good, a good stout, but nothing special."
"Opinion: This is a very tasty beer! I really like the malt hop balance, and it manages to not be acidic in the finish. I think that at this point I may like their Chocolate Stout a bit better, but I reserve judgment until I finish this bottle. This beer is probably the best true dry stout that I have tried, and I believe that it is leaps and bounds above its sour cousins."
"This drinks very easily, and it tastes really good, and I'd really like another one. Right now."
"Some of Shakespeare's stuff is pretty dark, but Shakespeare Stout a nihilistic black, with a big head the color of creamy coffee. The little black bubbles peppering the head make it look alluringly like a chocolate chip cookie. Smell walks the line between dark chocolate and prunes. Huge roasted flavor, to the point of being burnt, that overwhelms the ""mellow chocolate aftertaste"" promised by the bottle. More pruniness, but it mixes well with the other flavors. Good, velvety mouthfeel. Drinkable for awhile but the burnt flavor lingers and dissuades futher consumption."
"Rich, gritty and full bodied  still smooth for the entire 650ml bomber. Mellows mid-bottle as the 6% starts working. This is a very good session or quiet evening sipper brew."
"Notes: Not my favorite stout but definitelt worth drinking. I like a little more of a sweet complex flavor but this one is pretty good. I definitely recommend it."
"This one doth not protest too much, methinks."
"Whoa mamma. I'm surprised that I haven't rated this beer yet. I'm glad because it never tasted better than it did on tap at Barley's, Knoxville TN. Of course it's opaque black and has great head retention. This beer is surprisingly mellow and smooth, both in texture and flavor, to be so bold and flavorful. They get great malt flavors, chocolate flavors, and coffee flavors without a hint of astringency. Solid hopping does not leave the beer unnecessarily bitter, metalic, or acidic. It's as creamy as marshmellows, but easier to drink. Finishes mildly coffee-like and lightly bitter. I could drink this one all night."
"world class ale, indeed."
"This beer is very good at what it does, just as the people at Rogue are very good at what they do. The noticeable chocolate taste and aroma in this beer are divine, and in my humble opinion make this brew preferable over the, equally drinkable, classic Irish stouts."
"Not as ""big"" a stout as one would expect. I've had this brew quite a few times in the past, and every time I crack open the bottle, I envision it to be some 9%, thick, burly stout. It's really just a well-crafted stout that doesn't try to do too much..it just blends together exceptionally well. There's no excuse not to try it."
"I don't know what I was thinking the first time I reviewed this one. This is a damn fine sample. Very full taste, nice, toasted malts, very full body and great on the tongue. I jacked my previous scores. It deserved better"
"On a cold day, this beer is fantastically drinkable. This could replace the milk in my fridge, easily."
"Fine carbonation, nice tingle effect on the palette, very enjoyable drinker. Good Sunday evening nightcapper."
"A great looking dark color with a big coffee looking three finger head.You can really smell the coffee and chocolate in this stout.The taste is a full coffee and chocolate blast.It is extremely aromatic and flavorful.It's easy to see why this has won so many awards.A great full mouthfeel that lasts and changes as it goes down your mouth.As far as drinkability goes,I will probably buy this anytime I see it.This is one of the best beers in America. Cheers."
"Drinkability - 5 - This goes right behind Storm King in my list of favorite brews.... I could drink this all day long and not grow tired of it. Simply incredible."
"Not something i could drink all the time, but a nice treat once in a while."
"Pretty quality."
"Served in a pint glass at Zeno's. This is black with a nice thick frothy tan head. Smell is chocolatey malt with some coffee and perhaps some hoppy aromas in the background. Taste is roasted malt at first followed quickly by strong chocolate and coffee flavors. Finishes with some nice citrusy hop bitterness. Very nice thick mouthfeel and quite drinkable."
"Excellent brew! It wasn't what I totally expected, but this one is not too sweet to consume by myself. I'd definitely recommend this one to anyone!"
"Great drinkability."
"A consistant product however not the best Stout around 6% abv available."
"If you like stouts, get this one and dont be afraid of the sticker price, its worth it."
"This beer pours pitch black, when held up to the light no trace of any other color. A nice tan colored head forms but disapates fairly quickly. Smells of piney hops a bit of citrus coming through. Along with coffee, and chocolate. Medium bodied stout that feels good in the mouth. A clean finish with mild hops on the nose. A great stout and will drink(buy) again."
"Overall, this is a pretty good stout, and scary drinkable; it's a shame the Bard never got to try one himself. Shakespeare Stout is a must-have for anyone who hasn't trod beyond the Irish dry stouts, and is worth trying regardless of your beer likes/dislikes."
"drinkability: better than average"
"Overall....solid american stout that could please a large demo. nothing to throw a wrench in your palate and well crafted blend of malts and burnt barley taste. thank you rogue. Oh YEAH i almost forgot Rogue beers are priced very modest for how much work is apparent in their brew...thanks again"
"edit (10.24.05): did a vertical with the shakespeare and the chocolate stouts. these are both equally impressive in almost every way, but are slightly different. i just can't accurately say which i like better and which i'd rank higher. if i had a gun to my head, the shakespeare might have to get the nod."
"This is the second best american stout I've ever tasted (first being Sixpoint craft ales Diesel) The beer is black with a nice light beige head. The aromas were of stron groasted characters, some chocolate, coffee, unfortunatly cardboard, distant black licorice and a slight hint of alcohol. The hops brought up the rear but very faintly. The taste was very sweet of heavy roasted chocolate, coffee, black licorice, and a nice hint of , molasses. Once again it finished smoothly with well balanced hops. Very slick and creamy on the palette. In my book a very well put together american stout."
"Gorgeous pitch black brew with translucent edges, not much head in the pint glass...why didn't I use the snifter? Smell is coffee and slight anise, toasted malts. Oh, the taste, heavy duty toasted malt with a fine coffee flavor over the top and some hop bite underneath and in the finish. Quite a symphony of flavors. Mouthfeel starts a little watery but fills quickly and the finish is strong and long. What a great drinking stout. Highly recommended and readily available. There is no excuse for not consuming this beer."
"Drinkability: rich and sweet, good with dessert or a Padron"
"Drinkability: Comples and tasty. Well balanced. Sweetness matches the chocolate/hop bitter perfectly."
"Typical black colour and off-white head. Roasted malt and hoppy aromas are present, perhaps with a bit of soya-sauce in the mix as well. The flavor is much more ""roasted"" than I was expecting, but theres chocolate there too along with a combination of earthy hops and faint citrus finish. The flavor profile seems more ""imperial"" than ""sweet", but either way its all good."
"Bomber bottle, pours allmost black with a frothy dark tan head, leaving nice stringy lacing. Nose here is mildly of burnt grains and coffee grounds. this is a bold and full taste stout, pleanty of coffee, chocolate and roasty notes. Smoth and nicely rounded on the tongue, finishes smooth and coating, but not clinging to the tongue, finish is marked with more semi sweet dark chocolate and mildly drying hops. This one has been a classic, fine American micro brew for many years. Hats off and a big thank you to the folks at Rogue for putting this fine stuff out for such a long time."
"Pours a crude oil jet black with ample mocha brown head with good retention and decent lacing. Smell and Taste are earthy malts, coffee and bittersweet chocolate with a surprisingly high hop presence. Not overbearing, but certainly there. Quite frankly, this tastes almost identical to their Mocha Porter which I had a few weeks ago. This further blurs the line between porter and stout in my opinion. It seems like it's really at the brewer's discretion whether they call their dark beer a stout or porter. I'm not mad, I love both, just an interesting thing to think about. Mouthfeel is smooth and nicely carbonated. Finished the bomber with ease. A very solid offering from Rogue. They've yet to blow me out of the water, but they never really disappoint either. Just solid all around. Could have done worse for review #50."
"Strong, bitter aftertaste."
"Pours an opaque black color with a large tan head the recedes quickly. Aroma is of chocolate and coffee. The taste is rather smooth. Dark chocolate and coffe like the aroma. I don't find it to be very complex though, and it does seem to be as flavorful as a stout could be. Still, the flavor it has tastes good. Mouthfeel is medium thick bodied with low carbonation. Overall, this is a good stout, easily drinkable, and enjoyable."
"22 ounce bomber. This beer pours out black with a huge dark brown head. The aroma is roasted coffee, caramel, and hops - everything that I like in a stout. This beer has a great roasted flavor. There is also a malty caramel flavor. The most notable aspect of this beer is the hops. There is much more hopiness than in most stouts. The hops and bitter roastiness balance the malt. Mouthfeel is full. This beer is terrific both from the bottle and on tap. Just be sure to let it warm up if it's at refrigerator temp. Nearly perfect."
"Heres a stout of epic proportions. Oh yes, I love this beer. Buy a few."
"but it's a good stout."
"Drinkability: This definitely isn't a session beer, but it's not supposed to be. One bomber of Shakespeare is the perfect way to end an evening."
"Really an amazing beer. One of my favorite stouts. This was my second bottle, and I've got a third waiting for me."
"This guy is pretty drinkable as well- a sipper, but drinkable. Very tasty concoction. Go get one."
"Tasty drink. I'm a bigger fan of some of the other Rouge offerings, but this is definetly a winner."
"Intensely creamy, with a dry taste to it. Coffee flavors, hints of chocolate and a nice hop bite at the end. Mostly sweet. Very full bodied, and an easily quaffable masterpiece."
"Easy to drink, enjoyable to drink, and one I will drink lots and lots of."
"excellent"
"This is a stout worth seeking out. From the milkshake like head through the bottom of the pint, every sip was a treat. It was as luxurious as a fine chocolate mousse. I split this bottle with my brother, but wish I'd drank it all myself."
"Bomber obtained from John's Grocery (Iowa City) and consumed a couple days later (June, 2005). Pours a lushious off-brown two-finger head over a stark black liquid. Smells of c-hops, chocolate, roast, and alcohol. My first taste was of smoked malt and chocolate. In later tastes, the smoke disappeared and the chocolate resolved into that of chocolate easter bunny ears. I never thought I'd say that about a beer, but the flavor really is a gentle melt in your mouth. A hop bitter is present early and persists through the swallow, becoming a bit stronger in the immediate aftertaste. The bitter is accompanied by a citrusy hop flavor that is noticable, not overbearing, and in balance with the other flavors. It has a lactose creaminess that works well with what I perceive as medium body. The mild carbonation leaves only a gentle acrid that's actually below the hop bitter and gentle roast flavors. Not so roasty as to be coffee-like, but detectable with searching. Cherry sour, which is a feature found in many stouts, is either non-existant or hidden beneath the hop bitter in the end. Near the end of the glass and the beer is leaving a dry hop-bitter and cocoa powder on my tongue. Not entirely pleasing, from a drinkablility stand-point. There's still a thin layer of head on the beerand nice lacing on the inside of the glass."
"Bless you Rogue Ales for creating this fantastic brew!"
"Shakespeare stout is hard to dislike, I'm quite glad to have had the experience of drinking it."
"Drinkability: With the lower ABV and the great taste make for a dangerous combination. It's good stuff. Highly recommended."
"This pours a dark opaque color with a dark chocolatey head. The aroma is of chocolate, coffee, roasted malt. The taste is also of roasted malts and chocolate. It tastes like tootsie rolls and coffee. The mouthfeel is pretty decent. medium carbonation. Its a very drinkable beer overall. I would definately recommend it."
"Drinkability- Rogue impresses once again. One of the best american stouts I have had to date. This one will be purchased again in the future."
"This one could be the best of my favorite style. Highly recommended, although due to price concerns I'll likely stick with Obsidian for now."
"Overall, this is the beer that Guinness Extra Stout only wishes it could be. A very nice and complex example of an American Stout, and one that I wish I could buy locally. I've got one more in the closet, and I'll be hoarding it for a special occasion for awhile, I think. The next time I see this one on-tap, I'm ordering one just to see how the CO2 effects the brew."
"A pour from a bomber produces a thick and frothy head, beautiful brown and chocolaty. A rich looking dark beer, with a dense mouthfeel, but not heavy. Nothing like those watery nitro-infused stouts. An aroma of burnt malt comes to you, then a full taste, with slight roasted notes and chocolate aftertaste. A pleasure to drink. A great stout and my favorite offering from Rogue. Try it."
"D&N: Dangerously drinkable. I'm totally in love with cask conditioned dark beers now. If you see this one on cask, drop everything and go have a pint, you won't regret it."
"(I) Drink to the general joy of the whole table Macbeth: Macbeth, III, iv"
"If you look at this beer as comfort food you'll find that too much of anything albeit tasty might not be exactly what you needed."
"Drinkability: Can't give it a 5, but I sure wish I had another bomber of this."
"Very dark, basically black, with just a hint of dark brown highlights. This was topped by a dense, dark brown head that showed excellent retention. The aroma was quite malty, with some lightly roasted malts, chocolate, and just slightly burnt. Sweetness and fresh floral hops serve as a decent counterpoint. The flavour is really big, but balanced nicely between bitterness and rich malts. Chocolate and lactose-like sweetness counter the definite burnt malts. Bitterness is on the strong side, with plenty of floral and orange/citrus hoppiness. It had a long finish that emphasized bitterness and roasted malts, leaving the palate on the dry side. The texture was velvety smooth, low carbonation composed of fine bubbles, and a full body. This is great stuff... nice balance with plenty of flavour and a great finish."
"Hard to find anything bad about this beer. Pours black with a one-finger tan head. Did not leave much lacing but was well-retained. Chocolatey coffee aroma and the same goes for the taste. You can also really notice the roasted malts and a good amount of hoppage as well. Great silky, creamy mouthfeel. Really coats the inside of your mouth nicely. Very drinkable for a stout as well. At $5 for a 22 oz. bomber you won't see me drinking this every night, but definitely a great beer and a great representation of its style as well."
"The beer pours a jet black color with no light penetration, and a large tan colored head that leaves nice lacing all the way down the glass, another beauty from rogue. The aroma is a complex blend of coffee, molasses, dark chocolate and maybe dark currants...incredible smell. The taste begins with a sweet blackstrap molasses taste, followed by a dark currant fruity taste as well as dark, bittersweet chocolate. Then you get a nice roasted coffee flavor and the beer finishes with a dry, roasted, hoppy bitterness that lingers on the tongue. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth and lightly carbonated which contrasts with the bitter finish of the beer quite nicely. Overall an exceptional stout, not the most drinkable but complex and extremely tasty. One of my favorite american stouts."
"Definitely one I must make Chili with"
"Taste is an interesting case, it's not overly sweet but there is a definite dark chocolate flavor on top of a roasted malt note that lingers in the aftertaste. There's a nice hop presence offsetting some of the roastiness. The alcohol is just barely there, but you'll notice it. The mouthfeel is just a tad thin and watery for me. It's a delicious stout; one of the better ones I've had in a while."
"Poured smooth and creamy, pronounced coffee/roasted aroma. Taste was like a rich espresso, with bits of bitter chocolate, finished with a nice hop flavour. This is a rich and creamy stout that will leave you wanting more. Well crafted, and worth every bit of hype it gets. Well done."
"Pours opaque black from a 22oz bomber and generates a generous helping of frothy brown head. Nice powerful aroma of chocolate and smooth malt. Some coffee and roasted notes as well as a little caramel. Flavor is large, but remarkably smooth. Hints of black malt nip at the tongue, while big coffee and chocolate flavors smooth things over. The big malts eventually allow room for a hint of citrus hops. Finish is a nice blend of the hops, roasted grain, and a bit of sweet caramel. Mouthfeel is a little thin for the style, but nothing terrible. The hop presence makes for a very interesting take on the American stout."
"Pours black with a bubbly tan head with good retention. Malty nutty nose with some roastedness. Absolutely perfectly balanced nutty flavour with the roasted the roasted malts with a nice hoppy finish. I'm reviewing this from notes and I can still imagine the taste in my mouth. Lovely stuff. To quote my good friend who was with me that night ""I think I might have sex with this beer."" Wow. This is damn tasty. Unfortunately, in Ontario it is also damn expensive."
"This is the real deal. Bow down to the mo-fo king o' the stouts!"
"The taste is definitely distinct. No sweetness, mostly an assault of coffee and chocolate. In the middle of the sip you can taste the nut, and it ends with a dry bitter taste. Very overwhelming all over. I really have to judge this beer by style and not personal preference, but anyone who is looking for a kick-you-in-the-balls stout, this is definitely for you."
"Pours a pitch black with a dark brown head. Opaque, no light is getting through this bastard. Smells of nice charred malts, with a dollop of cascade hoppiness. Taste on this one is dry. Burnt and chocolately malts backed up by a citric cascade hoppines. Very neutral yeast finishes off this puppy. Very bitter and dry. Nice mouthfeel and very drinkable to boot. This is how a stout should look, smell, and taste. Damn near perfection in a bottle."
"The mouthfeel is full, creamy smooth, and not too carbonated. This is an outstanding stout that's easy to drink."
"Another great one from Rogue."
"Pours blacker than night and has a chocolaty tan head that stays until the beer is gone. This beer is so good it almost makes me speechless. I have waited too long to try this wonderful beer. It is smooth and velvety in all aspects and is for sure the king of American stouts. I am in love."
"This stuff poured just beautifully!!! Dark brown as it poured into the glass filling it jet black like ink. Finger thick head which dissipated quickly. Nice lacing. The smell was MUCH hoppier than I was anticipating. I don't really care for hops of this magnitude, but its other attributes make up for its hoppiness. The taste has a little less hops than the smell does, which is very good. There is a considerable amount of malt present here. The mouthfeel is very smooth. Perfect amount of carbonation. This has its good and bad points to me. Wonderful appearance and extremley smooth, but, it has quite a bit of grassy hop, which I do not care for. Overall, though, this is quite tasty."
"I am not really a huge fan of stouts, but this one is actually quite phenomenal. The appearance is pitch black with an huge tan head that leaves a pretty, frilly little lace on the glass. The smell is very earthy, like chocolatey roasted malts and caramel. The taste of this brew is almost exactly like Rogue's Chocolate Stout. In other words: chocolatey, ever so slightly roasted malt. The bottle boasts that this beer is consistently rated as America's finest stout... I, for one, cannot disagree, but I would welcome anybody to buy me a stout of any other make if they thought it could be beaten. Either opinion would be highly subjective, but nonetheless, I doubt anybody could argue that this is not a VERY fine stout."
" Additional note: this beer doesn't reach it's true potential until it has been "" cured "" for at least 18 months - like sitting in the back of your fridge type cured, preferably for two years. If you don't wait this long, or if you don't find a bottle that is that old, you will have what I refer to as a "" green "" beer. Believe me when I say this beer will taste primarily like grapefruit peel and not much more if it hasn't been aged for that long. Shakespeare Stout isn't for everyone and certainly not for the faint of heart."
"Wow! Great! I can't believe I have not tried this until now. Picked up a bomber the other day. Poured pitch black in color. With a two-finger deep, chocolate brown head. The nose came across as very smoky. The flavor was malts, more smoke, burnt chocolate, and with a very subtle but pleasant hoppy bitter bite. What does it for me is the mouthfeel. Very bold and full. Does not hold abck and tease but smacks you right in the teeth. Very easy to drink and hard to put down. If it were not for th damn snowstorm outside I would go buy some more."
"Pours as black as black can be. Can't see through it even when held up to a light. Very small brown head that leaves a nice ring of lace around the glass. Smells thick and robust. Aromas of beautiful roasted malt with notes of coffee & chocolate. Some hop aromas and faint smells of alcohol but the wonderful character of the roasted malt makes you quickly forget about it. Taste is very wonderful. A wonderful taste of of a beautiful roasted malt that contains all the flavors that it should - coffee, chocolate and a nice roasted bitterness. As stouts go everything here is just balanced wonderfully. Leaves a nice coffee like bitter aftertaste and a slight warming feeling going down. A bit too thick to be highly drinkable, but I don't think that is the intent one this one - just enjoy."
"Unusually for a stout I feel that I could down a few of these in a row, although I doubt I would want to. One is enough - a very pleasant stout, but more of curiosity than a session beer for me."
"Tastes as it smells, with more bitterness. No real taste of alcohol. The after taste is rich and chocolaty, with something that reminds me of hard pretzels. It feels a little less thick than one would think baised on the colors. Its smooth and is something I enjoy sitting and drinking pint after pint of."
"An excellent stout and one of my favorites."
"Inky black color with a thick brown head that drapes on the glass later as a lace. The nose is roasted dark malt with chocolate overtones, mild coffee and subtle cherry. Hops come across late in the aroma. The flavor has more cherry than I detected in the nose. Chocolate covered cherries is the 1st impression I get. The roasted malt and coffee character takes over from there with the hops layered in the finish showing as a tangy floral character. The mouth feel is a velvet smooth character Ive really come to love from fine stouts. This is a very drinkable beer, great representation of the style."
"Very drinkable, IMO."
"I will never forget last night when I tried this one out at the Town Pump bar in Black Mountain, NC. My drunk co-worker bought this for a female friend who wanted a Bud Light. She handed this off to me. When I left for the bathroom, I came back to find out the guy poured half the pint glass into his. After enjoying my half (which was one of the best stouts I've experience), the guy fell into the band's music stands and upright bass. The owner and bassist almost kicked his ass as he continued to argue with everyone. We all got kicked out but at least the owner told me I could come back (after I paid with the guys credit card and left him a fat tip). Memories."
"Thinking about it makes my mouth water. I think I'll have another."
"Drinkability: Certainly drinkable, but my bottle doesn't merit the accolades others have given this brew"
"Mouth feel is pretty smooth which is to be expected from a stout. Caramel undertones coupled with oaty goodness. This is a well made brew. Slight alcohol tinge followed by a very subtle chocolate tone. Overall a very enjoyable, very drinkable stout. Cheers!"
"Dark chocolate silk with just enough complexity to always be interesting yet not so intense so as to lose drinkability. This is THE session stout. Aroma is chocolate-covered black raspberries. The roastedness is strong but melds seamlessly with the other flavors of caramel and hops. Yes, the hops are there, just like we expect from Rogue, but they are not overly fruity. Their flavor adds earthiness and life to the aroma and a vinous depth to the flavor. Body is medium-thin, but the low carbonation stops it from feeling at all fizzy. Lingering bitterness and roasted acidity tantalize the taste buds for another sip. Oh yeah, this is nice."
" Mouthfeel is medium to big and chewy. Carbonation could be a little less aggressive, but 10 minutes in the glass and it's perfect. Quite silky and velvety. Creamy malts and pine drenched hops fight it out for the finish. As always, one of Rogue's best and it's even better on draft."
"Tastes great, smells great, and a joy to look at. I will buy this again and again."
"Heard a lot of good things about this one and all the hype was right. Amazing brew. Appears a dark dark dark brown, not quite black, with a little brown head that slowly fades out. Smells roasty and malty with a bit of bitterness thrown in. Burning tar sort of? That's a good thing by the way. This is the hoppiest stout I've ever had for sure. Not to say that it isn't malty, because it definately is. Roasted toasted malts galore, espresso bean flavor, not too sweet, just how I like it. And the best thing is, it has a super bitter hoppy kick to it in the end and a very dry finish. I don't think I've really experienced that in a stout before. Leave it to Rogue. Bunch of inovators..."
"D- very average. I doubt I will buy this again."
"Drinkability and Overall: Classic stout. Everything you want and need in a stout is available in this beer. Strong, yet highly drinkable. One of the best. Rogue has, once again, outdone themselves."
"Drinkability: Like a fine port or steak, this is not something I'd drink every day. It's just too fine and rich a brew. This is what stout should be. I can't imagine why I waited as long as I did trying it."
"Comments - If you have friends that don't like ""dark beers," get them to try this one. The flavor is complex, but not something that should scare off new craft beer drinkers. On second thought, ""earthy"" desribes this beer very well."
"Body is not thin but the mouthfeel is slightly thinner than expected. Probably keeps its drinkability higher, though, as anything thicker would cause that number to fall. Tons of flavor, an excellent example of a very good dry stout that certainly beats the pants off a Guinness."
"Just not my cup of tea... or mug of stout..."
"Reflection: This is another good stout from Rogue but it can't compete with their Imperial."
"Pours a deep opaque black color with a firm chocolate head about a half inch high that leaves a nice lacing on the glass. Aromas consist of a mix of cocoa and coffee along with additional roastiness and just a hint of oats. There is also just a touch of hops in the nose which really makes this brew smell quite nice. Flavors start off with a nice smack of roastiness and chocolate with hints of oats in the mix. There is a really creamy mouthfeel to this brew with a nice chewy body to it. Following there are notes of coffee and just a hint of astringency from the malts, but it is mostly subdued due to the nice additions of oats. The finish is hoppy and chocolatey with just enough bitterness that makes this brew perfectly balanced. I'm not sure if stouts get much better than this."
"My first Shakespeare Stout. The beer pours a jet black color with a small dark tan head that sits just over the top of he liquid. The nose is very roasted, with coffee coming through most dominant and a sweet chocolate in the background. Its not quite as strong in the nose as I would want. The flavor is really nice. A nice bittersweet chocolate moves to a sweeter candy chocolate, finally finishing with a really nice coffee bitter. Wow. This is a nice stout. The feel is a shade above moderate, with just a slight creamyness, but with an overall smoothness that is very enjoyable. This beer is disappearing very quickly from my glass, so how can drinkability be anything but good on this one. This is keeping me company while my wife and my family are at a movie that I didn't want to see. I'd trade the movie for this beer any day."
"The taste is quite shocking. There's the big, dry roastiness - that was to be expected. There's also the substantial mouthfeel and earthy creaminess from the oats - expected that too. There's also plenty of chocolate and highly-caramelized toffee-type flavors. However, this beer also packs a wollop of 69 Cascade-induced IBUs. That's IPA range. Hot damn, this is decidedly American, and quite visionary. Why'd it take me so long to return to this beer? My only complaint would be that the sheer intensity of the roasted malt and hop flavors make it slightly-less than supremely drinkable."
"Overall a wonderful stout, great winter beer by the fire."
"This was my last bottle of Rogue on my trip and boy was she a killer, the pick of the lot of the Rogue stable which is saying alot as these guys were one of my favourite overall breweries during my stay (and who knows, if I tried more of their brews they might be outright first)"
"Pours almost black with a mocha-brown head, hints of violet are seen on the edges of the glass. Aroma was a little faint at first, milk chocolate, roasted malt, it got stronger as it warmed. Taste was very complex, roasted malts, coffee, burnt toast with a lingering dry finish. Had an almost dank basement-like taste. Mouthfeel was smooth, and less heavy than expected. It is definitely good, but I didn't enjoy it quite as much as the Imperial Stout."
"Nice stout. Dark as night when served, some cola colored highlights. Low head. Chocolate in the aroma. Taste I found to be chocolate to start, roasted coffee bean to finish. Easy to drink, nicely balanced, good flavor. I enjoyed this brew, even though stouts aren't my favorite style."
"I found the bottled version significantly more interesting than what I've tried on-tap. The draft is smoother and creamier in body, but the bottled has more robust flavor and smell and better overall balance IMHO."
"This stout, one of Rogue's original brews, is very good and well worth looking for. This beer also shows that Rogue can make great beers that aren't hop bombs."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, lush and full. Shakespeare commands you to drink! Drinkability is marvelous as well. Can there be a reason to stop drinking this....I didn't think so. One of the best straight up stouts I've yet to have...props to Rogue. Highly recommended...a brew to be reckoned with."
"Mouthfeel is a bit creamy with ample carbonation, and a bit of bite from the hops. It is quite drinkable, as it doesn't have an extraordinary ABV%. This ale is highly recommended by me for an American stout. I generally enjoy most of Rogue's offerings, though."
"Pours a very dark color with a tan head that quickly dies off but leaves some lacing on the glass. An aroma of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, and a slight trace of alcohol. Very balanced flavor. Very malty with a strong coffee character and slight chocolate character. This is a very well made beer and I'll probably have it again soon."
"So far, the Rogue Shakespeare Stout is my favorite American stout...no, it's my favorite stout. Period."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Another great beer from Rogue, I haven't gone wrong with them yet. Shakespeare Stout pours the color of coffee with an average-sized, medium brown head. The aroma is very inviting, a nice mixture of roasted chocolate and hops. Taste is initially hoppy with some tongue-tingling action. Sip finishes with a mixture of roasted coffee and chocolate flavors. These elements come together nicely and equal a balanced beer. My only complaint is that I wish the chocolate taste was more assertive. Great beer, however, too heavy for long sessions."
"A stout lovers stout for sure."
"Notes: Oh yeah this is a great example of an American Stout. Nearly flawless."
"Pours with a thick creamy, light chocolate brown head that sits atop an opaque deep brown to black beer. The aroma is slightly acidic in its roastiness, and it has notes of chocolate, espresso, and alcohol. It has a creamy mouthfeel up front, and a sharp acidic roast malt bite in the finish. Espresso dominates over the chocolate, which is the opposite sense I got in the aroma. The dark malt notes of roasted barley, and burnt malt dominates this beer. Not much in the way of hops is noticeable above all of the roast character, but there is a nice hop bite in the finish that is a bit bracing and let you know that this beer is in fact 69 IBUs. A very nice stout that I have always had a soft spot for."
"This is quite a good brew, not too big (like an imperial stout), but not a lightweight either. Definitely a once-in-a-while beer though."
"Sampled while in Vegas, from a brown 650 ml bottle, silk-screened label. Interesting, all of that info pertaining to the beer printed on the label, but no mention of an actual abv %. The body is a thick pitch black, impermeable to light, very impressive. Thick chunky tan head, dented with large bubbles. Massive lacing. Dark chocolate on the nose, some coffee, and noticable cascade hops. The flavour starts with bitter dark chocolate, some coffee and roasted malt nearing the middle, and complimented by the hop presence. Velvety, creamy mouthfeel. Only one of these per serving for me though, it's a little rough on the guts once the bottle has been emptied."
"I have yet to find a Rogue product I don't like. This, however, is probably the best stout I have ever placed my hands on."
"On some sips, the flavor was immediate, while on other sips, the flavors were delayed. Taste was very reminiscent of Nailbiter. I would have preferred a thicker mouthfeel but a very nice beer nevertheless."
"The many favorable reviews of this top ranked stout certainly caught my attention, but in the end, it seemed a bit over hyped. Shakespeare is a good stout - maybe even a great stout but it's not an earth-shattering superlative. It's more of a supermodel: very attractive, with a great body, but perhaps a bit light on complexity. It's still good, and I wouldn't kick it out of the bar. It just seems that aside from the magnificent tan head and gorgeous black body that there is little more to justify the attention. The roasted malt aroma is strong, but standard. The flavors are almost monochromatic with roast coffee notes and a bit of a cascade bite with only the subtlest coffee notes peaking through a fog of acrid and bitter notes."
"The Storm King may rule the kingdom, but it certainly cribbed some notes from this baby -- get what I'm sayin'?"
"Pours a perfect deep black color that is brownish red when held to the light. Head is thick, heavy, and lasts near indefinitely. Smell is exceptional in its potency and allure, smells like a pure malt field, with elements of chocolate running throughout. Taste is quite good. Immediately complex, malty flavor is dominant with hints of fruit, cocoa, and quite sweet. Rogue brews consistently excellent beers, and here is one of their best. A must try."
"Great American stout."
"All in all, this beer is moderately drinkable."
"This stout is all that i anticipated and more, fantastic job by Rogue."
"wonderful, simply wonderful."
"The body is blacker than black. Spinal Tap would describe it as a ""pastel black"". The head is a hearty nut-brown color, not wussy off white. Black liquorices is in the smell, and something smelled a little sour. The mouth feel is smooth, no doubt. The first impressions are a burnt toast / dark roasted malt flavor. Followed by some bitterness. The after taste starts as chocolate and then progresses to a coffee / espresso flavor. I think this stout is a little too ""in your face"" for my liking, ""this one goes to 11"". If they kept all the same flavors, but just dialed down their intensity so they blend together better I would probably love it."
"All in all, another good offering from the guys at Rouge."
"Would I drink another, Yes, but not right away. Too many other beers to try before I revisit this one... build more of a palette before going back."
"Perhaps I got a bad bottle. Maybe something happend on the long trip from Oregon to West Virginia. I don't know, but this beer did not live up to my expectations. I may try it again, but at almost five bucks for a 22 oz bottle, I am quite hesitant. I have had better West Coast Stouts and would rather spend seven bucks on a six pack of Sierra Nevada Stout than Five on one bottle of this. Your mileage may vary."
"I've been holding on for this bottle for awhile. Pours a crude oil black with a phenomenal caramel tan mocha head that is incredible, the cake laced froth will coat the glass throughout the session. The smell is the normal mocha espresso/chocolate roast that is pleasing, this stout however didn't have much else to add, the smells weren't heavy either. The taste was lighter than expected, more roasted or bbq wood/grain, hints of coffee, misses that sweet caramel/chocolate I've come accustomed to, good but not great, medium bodied and cleanses the palate to invite you back for more, a good solid stout, I thought would be great though."
"What I really like about this Stout is that it has all the great charactoristics of a traditional stout, with a GREAT hoppy bitterness that stays with you the rest of the night. There are lots of roasted malts, chocolate malts, etc, but this brew is (from my experience thus) incomparably smooth, flavorful, and clean...with just the right amount of sweetness and creaminess to make it great, but not overly cloy-ish or like milk. I will be drinking this the rest of my life and I recommend you do as well."
"Pint at Barley's in Knoxville."
"I drank this at the Rogue Public House in Newport and found it to be a world class stout, mellow enough for sessions. A true champion."
"i grabbed a big-ass bottle of this stout at gooski's in polish hill(pittsburgh). cool painted bottle with good ole bill shakespeare on it. pours a pitch black with an earth colored, billowing head. smell is chocolate coffee with a little hops in the back. taste was a delicious match of hops and chocolate malts that go down smooth. mouthfeel was heavy and a little syrupy, little carbonation. very drinkable, very good stout"
"Drinkability/Overall: Surprisingly smooth and well balanced. This is the epitome of American Stouts!"
"22oz bomber. Pours out a opaque pitch black color with a towering dark brown rocky head. The head dwindles down a bit while you drink this but it never disappears. An excellent smattering of lacing is also left about the glass. The aroma filled my nose full of wonderful scents of dark chocolate and roasted coffee. A good smell but not overpowering with hints of citric hops added into the mix as well. Dark chocolate and coffee flavors dominate most of the taste here. Mingling about is also citric hops, roasted malt flavors and a slight smokiness. Very tasty beer indeed with a lot going on in it. The wonderful taste is enhanced by the rich and creamy mouthfeel and the full body of this beauty. Excellent drinkability here with not much slowing you down from putting a few of these away. One of my favorite stouts for sure, give it a try if you havent already."
"The beer pours an opaque black with a very thick consitency. The head is very dark tan, like two shades darker than Guinness. The aroma is mostly of citrusy cascade hops, with a bit of roasted grains and dark chocolate. The taste of this beer is spectacular. It kind of reminds me of a cross between a dry stout and Anchor Liberty ale, very hoppy, yet still retaining stout characteristics. Perfectly balanced. The mouthfeel is thick and oily but not excessively so. This is truly a remarkable beer, I want to try all the Rogue brews. Stupid discriminatory LCBO."
"It pours a dark black with a brown creamy looking head that lasts and imparts some whispy lacing. Smell is malt with light coffee aroma and hops, smell is little on light side when compared to the flavor. Tastes is smooth lightly sweet leading into a moca choclate coffee flavor that that turns lightly bitter then the cascade takes control and impart a dose of hop flavor and a good does of bitterness. This stout is wonderful full bodied complex and a well rounded brew. Highly recomended it is one of the best stouts I have had to date."
"Final Notes: This might well be my favorite beer. It's unquestionably my favorite dry stout. This beer is unafraid to be big and ruthless. It's good. Its so good."
"Bought a case to share over the weekend, it was a good choice since we had no fridge... This is a nice stout in general, colour is blackish brown with a big brown head that is nice and fluffy and takes a while to go down enough to drink. Then again I think I poured it way too fast so it got all excited and super foamy at first. That's ok. It didnt smell like much to me, but it was roasty and kind of hoppy, some coffee aroma in there. Taste was very good, very roasty and toasty, coffee, teeny bit of molasses or something sweet, but just a hint, and hops. Definitely more hoppy than sweet, but not at all bitter. Mouthfeel was towards the thin side to me but just about perfect, and drinkability is good because of this. I was happy with this stout and would get it again."
"I suppose if I were in a stout drinking mood, this one would go nicely one after another."
"they should call it the double-roasted stout!! very good"
"Opaque, very dark brown color, with a tan head that quickly diminished and it left no lacing. Aroma of roasted malts, and light oats. Had a very creamy, roasted/coffee flavor. I heard from a friend that this was an oatmeal stout, I wasn't able to tell?"
"Pitch-dark black, very murky, thin tan head, still as night. The nose is a bit tough to detect; maybe some piney notes, barley, roasted malts. Dry, very dry up front. Dark roasted malts, coffee beans, espresso, all of them noted in the first few sips. A tender sweetness comes into play, barley and chocolate also noted. Just when you think you can't be taken, the Cascade hops come in to play, here to stay. Mix in the flavors mentioned early on with some hop-bite and you've got quite a stout. Summed up as big and bold, hearty, flavorful and enjoyable, the ratings are well-deserved; a great tasting 'hopped' up stout; my hat is tipped to the brewmasters who dreamed up this great wonder!"
"A couple of quick postscripts: 1) This is warming a bit and getting even better. 2) If you're in the KC area I found this at the south Gomer's, my first sighting of this great brew."
"Flavors are amazing. A strong roasted coffee-chocolate engulfs the mouth, finishing with a bitter chocolate sweetness. This would be a perfect brew if it were just a little smoother on the mouth (I still compare to the Samuel Smith standard, though this come close to perfection)."
"The large, bubbly, dark tan head fades quickly exposing a black body surrounded by a faint ring of deep brown. A smooth choco aroma waters the mouth. Bitter chocolate and hops dance gracefully across my tongue. Chunky mouthfeel leads into a rough, yet enjoyable, coffee filled finish. Heavy, but quite sessionable."
"I saw this on tap and could not pass up a chance to try this on tap. This beer poured as black as the night and formed a deep tan foamy head that left latticed lace as it subsided. A heavy aroma of malt, hops, milk chocolate and expresso coffee. The flavor was of malt, hops, coffee and chocolate, with the chocolate dominating. The body was a medium light quality and the finish was bittersweet. Now if only I could find it around here on tap."
"Great drinkability and at only 6.0% I could have plenty of these in a night....well done."
"I sincerely hope this was a bad bottle, but it will be quite a while before I spend $5 to try it again."
"Bitterness is too intense to make it easy to drink. Improved significantly as warmed."
"While this is a fine stout, I would have to say that one of it's major drawbacks, for me anyways, is the fact that 22 ozs is more than enough of such a rich concoction. This stout it in some instances too rich for it's own good. A fine beer indeed, but perhaps a little too much."
"If it were readily available and priced right, I would drink this all the time. The only thing I would like is for it to have a little more flavor and thickness when it's in the mouth. The aftertaste is perfect."
"It pours deep, dark black and looks like motor oil coming out of the bottle. It has a big brown head. The aroma is strong with a lot of roasted malts, a touch of caramel, and plenty of citrus hops (I believe it says cascade on the label). The full body has lots of roasted flavor (coffee and a touch of chocolate), some malty sweetness, and then the citrus hops hit you. It is silky smooth going down and has a nice bitter punch at the end. A great stout that has a nice US twist to it with the citrus bite."
"Solid black, with a big frothy brown head. Big roast coffee taste, almost a hint of burnt toast, and of course, a roasty smell. Good northwesartn hop balance to the roast bitterness, but also some tannins seem present. Finishes with a slight hint of orange and pineapple."
"Note: This one was actually called Wild Irish Stout, which is the import name of this beer."
"Pours a deep black liquid with a tan foamy head. One thing I did not like was that the head disappeared too quickly. There was some good lace on the glass. Smells like a loaf of dark bread, with a slight chocolate note. Taste was a dark roasted flavor with a note of coffee. There was some good hop bitterness in the finish. Full body, and appropriate carbonation. I thought it was pretty drinkable. Overall, I thought this was a solid stout. I can see why it has been rated pretty high. Another winner from Rogue."
"At the first sip I was anything but disappointed, full roasted flavor with a nice hop twinge at the end. The hops are not overpowering or subtle but have that nice balance for this truly excellent beer. It goes down smoothly with some coffee flavors at the end of the tasting. I could easily see this as becoming one of my favorite beers while I am out here in Missouri. I wish I had found the store that had it earlier, it is a fitting yet different replacement for storm king."
"A great beer that lends itself very well to cask. It would be better through a beer engine."
"I will be back to visit you again Shakespeare. Ive been waiting for a stout like this!"
"I'm gonna have this one again and you should, too."
"How about that. LCBO being on the forefront and 4 reviews, all from Ontario. This is an above avergae stout, not too chocolately or burnt coffee. Very drinkable and not far below the infamous Shakespeare Rogue in rogue abilities. Malty and yet balanced."
"Poured a midnight black with a small tan head that diminished very quickly. Smell was full of roasted malts with hints of coffee, extremely pleasant. Taste is of roasted malts balanced extremely well by hops. I couldn't pick out any specific hops but the bitterness is definately there. This is one creamy stout. It goes down nice and thick. I feel like i could have a couple bombers of this a night and be content. A wonderful stout from Rogue, I can't wait to get my hands on their imperial!"
"I'll have a tough time buying any other stout for at least a few weeks."
"Light-swallowing, black pour with a thick, long-lasting bronze head. Smell is less intense than expected, but typical roasted malts certainly are there. A bit of licorice and a nice bite of hops as well. Velvety, wonderful mouthfeel smoothes out the sharp flavors--toasty malts, bittersweet chocolate and noticeable astringency. At first I thought this was ""merely"" very good, but that sells this stout short. Very well done, indeed."
"Decent beer, quite tasty, but somewhat one dimensional. Worth a try."
"It is drinkable but NOT as good as Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout."
"Huge brown head atop this pitch black beer that you could lose yourself in. Deep smells of mocha and coffee with hints of roasted malts and caramel. That taste is nothing short of spectacular. This has a big roasted taste taht finishes dry with a hop dryness that is not only present but delicious. This beer has a thick body and it's outstanding. Very complex and hits all areas of the palate. The aftertaste is of burnt caramel, coffee, and roasted malts. Everything in this beer goes together great and there aren't too many other stouts that work this well."
"One of the most outstanding beers I have ever had. I wish I could find this in 6 packs."
"A truly awesome brew, my new favorite stout. Everyone should try this one."
"A nice blend, a type of chocolate oatmeal stout. Some of the Imperial stout flavors without the huge ABV."
"Well then, had a chance to have this on tap. A few subtle differences, but not much. Nice dark, dark brown with a very brown head. Malty, chocolaty, espresso smell, and loaded with about the same flavor. It seemed to me the hoppiness wasn't as predominate in the tap version. But this doesn't make it bad, just a little less exciting. Full bodied with only a little bite from the carbonation. As stated before, I will continue to drink these, over and over again."
"Other: I remember the first time I had Shakespeare Stout was in 1996 or thereabouts. I was in NYC on a choir tour and went with a lady friend who loved beer to a nice restaurant where we shared a bottle of this with our meal. We both took a whiff and were amazed. My first words were, ""Smells like dirt, and I mean the fertile black stuff we get out in Iowa."" This was meant as a complement, and is something I'll stand by."
"Mouthfeel: So creamy and smooth it's amazing. It's not too thin and not too thick, it's right in the middle. Great texture. I wouldn't mind drinking another one of these bombers. Such a great stout. I believe it's one of the most balanced beers out there."
"Extraordinary pour from the 22 oz bottle produces an opaque, jet black body and a fluffy tan head that eventually falls into patchy and ring lacing. Dark chocolate and roasted coffee in the typical stout aroma, but with definite hop notes that are floral and mildly ctrus. Rich, smooth, and creamy in the mouth with a slight essence of hops twang. Mocha and roasted coffee are upfront in the taste, but there are lots of pleasant surprises lurking here. Some smokiness is evident, as well as oatmeal, butternut, and some faint notes of grapefruit. Finishes with a bittersweet chocolate aftertaste. By far, the most complex and drinkable stout I've tried. No perception of alcohol, whatever, and I'm thinking that Rogue could increase the abv of this one with interesting effect."
"So many intriging flavors really make this a nice beer to drink. The fact that I can't leave a bomber only partly emptied means I will sleep well tonight."
"Way overhopped for what I expect from a stout, but it's quite tasty. A challenging brew, bordering on imperial stout in it's intensity. Not something I'd want on a daily basis, but I think I'll keep a bottle in the fridge for those extra crappy days at work, when you're really jonesing for a powerfully flavored beer to relax with."
"Pours black as tar with a moderate, creamy brown head that dissipates into a thin film -- no light shines through this brew. The aroma was malty and roasted, but not as ""big"" as I anticipated from the appearance. The mouthfeel was full and searching -- seeming to coat the entire palate. The taste was thick -- sweet malt and nuts with some hickory and chocolate insinuations, with a growing bitterness in the aftertaste. Highly drinkable even if it would get pretty heavy after a couple."
"As happy as I was when I unexpectedly found this on a local guy's shelf, I was even happier when I finally tasted it. The flavor has multiple tiers, all distinct, but still wonderful parts of an impressive whole. It's full in aroma, flavor, and feel, and has a biting edge that earns immediate respect. If you love stout, and I do, the substantial presence here will draw you in and demand attention and indulgence, and you'll give these things willingly. I may be no literary competition for The Bard, but this big beer makes me want to wax rhapsodic, and when a beer can do that, it's truly something special."
"The drinkability is surprisingly high here. Perhaps this is a good session stout for those that eschew Guinness. Altogether though, when I want stout I'll pick up a Samuel Smith's Oatmeal or Rogue Chocolate Stout instead."
"I love this stout. It is truly a wonderfully complex beer considering it is not a ""big"" beer in terms of alcohol. I could drink a lot of this. My wife loves this stuff, which says a lot about its appeal. One of the best!"
"Everything is huge and endless - pour out the last bit of the bottle and you are shocked at the stain in your sink. Often overlooked, this one is one to look for if you want a relatively low ABV beer that seems so much higher."
" I will say that this would be a good session beer for all of the above observations."
"Overall a high quality brew, I don't think it usurps my favourites by any stretch, but definitely something I'll revisit."
"Rouge Shakespeare Stout is very good beer and deserves all of the accolades thrown its way. However, even though I consider myself an IPA-loving' hophead, I don't like such intense hoppiness in my stouts. If you love hops, love good stouts and love combining them in one glass, then this is the beer that you've been looking for."
"cascading midnight black with a creamy dark brown head...awesome. grainy roasted oatmeal aroma. medium body with a relativley low amount of carbonation...seems to suit the brew. deep creamy dark roasted oat flavor with an earthy hop bitterness. extraodinarily balanced. absolutely the most drinkable stout i've come across. an essential brew and a must-try for anyone whose even slightly into stouts."
"Update 4/2/04: Had it again, still think it is amazing. I had this at a colder temperature, and it still is bursting with hops, chocolate, coffee, and maybe a little raisin flavor."
" 22 ounce bomber. Pop top pours a black brown beer, no carbonation, with deep tan head. Reminds me of the King (Storm, that is). Smell is sweet and bitter, like an imperial. But this is just a meager stout. Well maybe not. Taste is very smooth, with just the right touch of bitter hop and roasty malt to make you say hmmm. If I had had this before SK, I'd say SK is a heavy Shakespeare. Since I've already had the King, I'd say this is a lighter guy, but fit to serve as his second in command. Good choco feel at the end. Interesting to note the oatmeal prescence in the malt (props to Rogue for listing all their ingredients--gentlemen among brewers). The oatmeal seems to have just turned to alcohol, and left little of its trace in the residual taste. I really love this beer, I guess my cynicism comes from the fact that Rogue is in Oregon, I am in PA, Victory is 1 hour from me, and Storm King is similar, and just a bit better. Rogue's Imperial should embolize this. I'm sold. I love it. But, at $6 a bomber, with $1.75 SK's in the cooler, I can't really bring myself to say I prefer this. Great beer."
"Shakespeare poured a shimmering obsidian black, with an cola-foam colored creamy head. The smell was powerful and was reminiscent of Expedition Stout, for those of you lucky enough to have that frame of reference...deeply roasty coffee malts with a nice floral bouquet of hops pinned to it. The taste started with a brief kick of nice smokey dark choclate, which then collapsed too quickly into the well done bitter finish with lingering cola undertones... a bit disappointing. Numerous assertive fruity esters were also present, and though I usually enjoy a robust ester component in most beers (esp. dark), these seemed out of place somehow. The mouthfeel was creamy and full however. It was quite drinkable for a stout, due to the lack of lingering monster stout flavors and a well-done sweetness level. Shakespeare is certainly a full-flavored and original stout, but the quick flavor drop-off and off-esters leave me unsatisfied."
"Medium bodied with a rich full creamy mouthfeel and exceptional drinkability."
"I will revisit this soon."
"Overall, an excellent, drinkable stout - perhaps the best I've yet tried (and I've tried quite a few)!"
"One of Santa's gifts this year. First, appearance was a definite 5.0 with a creamy light chocolate head that lasted forever. Smell was good witha hoppy presence with some malty undertones. Taste was excellent with a great balance between coffee and burnt malt. A slight bitterness was evident with a nice hoppy aftertaste. Mouthfeel was medium to full-bodied with a somewhat chewy quality. A sipping brew...drinkability was above average for the style."
"This was a very smooth beer, I'm a big judge on carbonation and this was just right; not too much, not too little. Bold flavors that even out in the end make this a solid brew for any beer drinker."
"A beer that definitely lives up to the hype."
"Poured a deep, dark black/brown with a dark tan head. Aroma is heavy milk chocolate with some roasted barley and maybe coffee hints. Taste is very chocolately and chewy with bitter hop and resin end. Mouthfell is excellent, all alcohol feeling is hidden by prepdonerence of malt."
"I will be buying more of this wonderfull liquid in the near future."
"Boy, this one was an unexpected treat. Buddy of mine had a 3 liter from I'd imagine 2000-1, just judging from the older Shakespeare Stout logo silk-screened on the swing topped jerobaom. The top part tasted really alcohol-laden. What I was drinking was like Shakespeare stout, I've had lots of it since it was released from Rogue, but it was different because it was smoky, almost hammy, wine-like, complex, lower carbonated; just an overall unique Shakespeare experience. Wicked; nice and thick. All the characteristics of this stout were in place, other than lack of any oatmeal, just rearranged in a way that my rating for this beer is so high. 3 liters are so much fun. My only gripe was the carbonation was sooo subtle that there was not really a head to accentuate the delicious aroma."
"Wow, that's a dark head. Brown and doughy with spotty lacing. The beer is a black black with black highlights. Holding against a bright light reveals some black. The nose is sweetish with plenty of dark chocolate and some milk. A dark chocolate front, deep tangy chocolate middle and a bitter, hoppy finish. This beer is 100% bitter chocolate. Pure, dark, unsweetened chocolate with a slight tangy, sweetish overtone. Good."
"A fantastic stout. Rougue has always been a brewery that I could count on to make a quality beer. This was no exception. It poured a thick black color with a nice one inch head. The smell was a soft mocha scent. A little coffe and a little chocolate. This lead to a smooth drinking experience. Chocolate and coffe blended nicely for a wonderful tasting stout. Not as strong and over the top like some stouts. The mouthfeel was smooth as was the general body of the beer. Thank you once again, Rogue."
"Pours black as night with a good brown head. Smell is nutty, bitter and malty. The taste is surprisingly smooth. Chocolate and coffee in a perfect blend. Just a shade below some of the other stouts I have had but very tasty. A little too bitter for me."
"An especially drinkable stout."
"A bit of dark brown highlight in the pour; otherwise this is a deep black beer with a huge, rocky, coffee-and-milk colored head of variously sized bubbles that starts about three fingers deep. Head fades to a more mocha color with time, but clings to glass and dries out into crusty, dark lacework. Super smooth smell with subtle milk-chocolatey malt up front and a hazelnutty finish, with a touch of yeasty, roast-barleyish breadiness in the middle and exceedingly fresh hop character. Just fresh, fresh, fresh in all regards, even though it doesn't exactly come roaring out of the glass. Flavors are of roasted coffee beans and more slight hazelnut with a smoky character; dark chocolate at sides of palate and bits of damp earth; then a medium-sized hop backbone that strikes at the roof of the mouth and finishes. Very nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is soft and a touch oily with a nice, wet, hop smack; coffee flavor finishes smoothly and consistently, but I prefer a chewier stout (been spoiled by the oatmeals). That said, drinkability is simply insane. Super moreish, truly gulpable. Recommended."
"It pours black with a medium coffee brown head in a La Maudite snifter. Aroma is deep chocolate and coffee. Very nice roasted barley matches solid floral hops. From the first sip, I find it quite sour, reminding me of a Guinness, but much thicker and hoppier. The finish is astringent and ultra dry (bad), but hops are pleasant and the roastiness is perfectly developped (good). Overall, I must say I expected more from Shakespeare Stout."
"Nice mothfeel. A bit thin for a stout but very tasty."
"A really good dry stout."
"This one poured black with only a glimmer of light shining through and a small to medium tan head that held well. Smell is of burnt malts and barley. Taste shows a balance surprising to find in a stout. Quite hoppy. Bittersweet chocolate. Burnt flavors show in the finish. Slight molasses and caramel are noticed the further I drink this one. Hop presence increases the more I continue. All around this was a good beer that can be enjoyed at any time."
"Drinkability- the alcohol is not a big concern in this one but it does take alot out of the senses with the wide spectrum of the hops and malt."
"An undeniably interesting beer, just not what I'll reach for the next time I want a stout."
"Update  I put an 05 in the cellar and popped it in July 2006 to see how it would age. The head was predictably smaller and the malts a bit more broken down, but the lovely roasted malt is still very strong and hasnt sugared up in the least. Maybe as a two-year-old it might start to sweeten, but after just one year it is super-hardy and ready for some more cellar time!"
"For me, this simply is stout."
"Poured with a chocolate soda type head, creamy chocolate aroma, chocolate coffee taste comes through in a gush at the first taste. The mouthfeel is not smooth at all, rather spritzy. Dark chocolate aftertaste, but not really to sweet. A very good stout, but not one of the 5 best beers in the world as per Stuart Kallen in his book 50 Greatest beers.Its not even in my top 5 list when it comes to stouts."
"A nearly perfect black with a rapidly receding tan head. Very strong expresso and toated flavor. Bitter and dry its quite a tasty brew, but I wouldn't quite call it great. Not sure what it is about Rogue beers that disappoints me, but I will say this one is drinkable."
"22 oz bomber. Poured a pure black with a massive chocloate head that slowly receded. Lots of lacing on the glass. Now here is where things go south for me on this. The aroma was all hops, I could barely detect anything else. he same with the taste. It reminded me more of drinking an IPA instead of a stout. Did I get a very young bottle that wasn't ready? I find it hard to rate this, not being like any other stout i've had. It's not bad but not what was expected."
"A great stout, made only better by the cask-conditioning. Bravo to Rogue for a great beer, and hopefully this is one I'll have again!"
"This is now officialy the best stout that I have ever had. This poured jet black with a medium sized brown head that turned into a nice pillowy froth on top of the beer. The smell was heavenly with the smell of coffee beans and a slight hint of plum. The taste just killed me with its perfect balance of hoppy, chocolate and smokey flavors all rounded out by a great coffee finish. This stout is balanced to perfection and is one of the few that I could pound back all night and enjoy every minute of it."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. The alcohol warms nicely. Drinkability is enhanced by the overall smoothness and balance. My new favorite stout."
"Drinkability: Good overall, but needs milder roasted malt IMO. WIll try again."
"I always love picking up a new brew and then finding out it is a top-rated beer. Anyway, this poured jet black, no edges at all, just pure stout. Even a very easy pour brought up a huge pancake head, tan in color, with maximum retention and sticky lacing. Aromas include earthy hops, roasted malts, and chocolate. The taste is very unique and complex, almost imperial-ish. Starts off with an earthy, bitter hoppiness with a dry, roasty malt flavor balancing it out immediately. Sharp coffee, chocolate, and even a licorice like flavor were all present. Despite having a huge head the carbonation is relatively low, making for a silky smooth, full bodied mouthfeel. One of my favorite styles to drink, this beer deserves its top postition and is a rare, complete, unique brew with character and distinction."
"In my opinion, the Stout class is the style that U.S. microbreweries have have done the best job with. This one is very competitive, with a expresso dark color and a thick perfectly developed 1 inch head. The flavor is strong and intense with a combination of toasted bread, nut and coffee notes, but it is smooth and dry enough so as to be very drinkable as a session beer, if those words can be used when describing a stout. Has a wonderfully thick mouthfeel that makes a syrupy lace on the side of the glass. In a class this competitive, I could not say this is necessarily the best Stout, but it is surely in my top 10, which really is saying a lot given the volume of solid competition with British and U.S. breweries producing quite a few memorable Stouts."
"More drinkable in colder temps to be sure, a great fireside beer. Sampled on a crisp fall day in Cincinnati enhances my score on this category."
"Very drinkable, especially at 6.2"
"Overall it's a really nice stout. I could drink this all day long."
"Black color, medium creamy head. Aroma is chocolate and coffee. A medium bodied stout. Roasted malts, chocolate and cocoa flavor. Mouthfeel is smooth. Somewhat bitter. Full flavor. Smooth taste. Slightly malty. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is bitter."
"$3.49 a bomber."
"Drink: This evaporates before you know it."
"Notes: I had four of these bombers at lunch, and I must say as much as I enjoyed them, they really filled me up. Not the best session brew, but oh so amazing!! Highly recommended."
"Wow. What a fantastic beer. Effectively pitch black with a thick tan head. First whiff is hops. Sweet, wonderful hops. Upon further investigation, you can smell the malt undertones - thick, roasted, chocolately, and rich. The taste present all of this in a nice neat little package. Hop bitterness and roasted malt start off the ensemble. The bitterness carries through the middle, and the finish is wrapped in dryness and smooth malt. Very silky. A tad heavy for a session beer, but would make an excellent meal replacement."
"Well this is quite the beer. Its pitch black but a hint of light will show when held to the sky. A nice brown head sits atop this one. Its got a nice roasted aroma to it. As for the taste, it is mainly a roasted one, but it is very smooth tasting. It is also backed by a nice hoppy bitterness, also smooth and well intergrated. This is a very well put together beer, great tasting but well balanced. Highly recommended."
"Very dark, pretty much black body with a medium sized brown head. A thing of beauty. I can see why this is called Shakespeare Stout, if indeed, Shakespeare was black and smelled of sweet roasted malts, rum-soaked coffee cake, and hops. Taste is not sweet as the smell might indicate, but loaded with malts and delicious roastiness. Very robust burned, roasty, coffee flavors--amazing. The only other stout that I can compare it to is Kalamazoo stout. Finish is delightfully dry and bitter with lingering chocolatey roastiness. I can tell the alcohol is there, but it goes down so easily. Maybe I will compose a sonnet to this beer, but on the other hand I think I'll just drink, enjoy, savor, and buy some for my family members for Christmas."
"Good brew, terse review: Black, black, black. Slightly poofed tan head. Aromas of chocolate and roasted barley malts layer over a bitter-ish hop aroma. Coffee and toffee-ish flavors beat down most everything else, which includes subtle chocolate and caramel. This brew closes with a nice little hoppy finish. It's a bit too flavorful and overtly hopped to make a big drinking stout; I'd much rather put back a few oatmeal or chocolate stouts or even a Sammy Smith Imperial. In some ways, it almost suffers because of its flavor. Nonetheless, it's a great one."
"Rereviewed: Got another bottle, this one must have been a bit fresher, the hops really popped out this time, but a strong stout malt base kept it in check nicely. Scores went up, guess this isn't one to cellar, but enjoy young, at least for me."
"What a wonderful stout. Not too harsh, smooth, nice creamy head that seemed to stay a while. Even a Bud Light drinker friend I was with enjoyed it. The bartender suggested it, and I found his suggestion admirable. Seemingly a typical stout, but as a typical stout, this one is still very memorable and I will ask for it again, if I can find it."
"This stout poured a deep black color. On top was a very dark frothy tan head. This stout gave off one of the darkest head that I have seen. Lacing is present but it gets patchy around the glass. The aroma is of burnt coffee, espresso, and roasted malt with a slight sweetness of chocolate. The taste is heavy roasted malt with a burnt coffee feel to it. After the swallow, it is nothing but a nice roasted malt bitterness with earthy tone washing over the tongue. Rouge beers have not disappointed me in anyway, nor do I expect them to. This stout is necessary for all to try!"
"Drinkability: This is a very excellent stout that i would be happy to order whenever the mood strikes me for a stout."
"This is an absolutely amazing beer! It pours a very deep, dark black color, topped off with a thick and creamy tan head that fades away moderately leaving a thin, sticky lace on the glass. The nose is full of coffee aromas, sort of like that aroma you get from the coffee pot when its been left on all day with about a half inch of coffee in the bottom. There is also a nice chocolate and nuttiness scents that push through the coffeeness. The taste is unbelievableroasted chocolate malts give the tastebuds a huge smack across the face. There is also a bit of alcohol left on the palate. This is one great full-bodied stout that is highly enjoyable. Its a bit filling though, after a 22oz bomber of this brew, my belly felt like I just eaten a 22oz steak dinner with big ol baked potato, I was stuffed."
"Pours black as night with a thick brown head that leaves good lacing. It has a roasty, chocolatey aroma with coffee notes. I also detected a raisiny, alcoholic aroma. It has a rich flavor with a roasty, and chocloatey flavors. It finishes with a nice roasted bitterness. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy for a full-bodied brew. I really enjoyed this beer."
"Drinkability is pretty good thanks to the finely balanced taste and fact that this beer gets even better as it gets warmer. By the time I finished, it was near room temp and better than when I started. Rogue created a good beer here which will really grow on you quick."
"Drinkability: Wish I had a lot more of this stuff. Not to sound yuppie, but this is a beer for the refined palate. 2/3rds of your friends will hate it. Nonetheless, this is an absolutely wonderful beer."
"Originally sampled on 9 May 2002. Great chocolate/coffee flavor. Wonderful aroma. In my opinion, this is a great stout to use to introduce beer geek wannabees to some of the heavier artillery. The chocolaty taste & nice aroma will ease them into the world of better beer."
"Bomber bought at Huckleberries in Spokane. Pitch black in color, with a big tan head. Smell of coffee and dark chocolate. Tasted of toasty malts, with coffee and chocolate, finishing with a minor hoppiness at the finish. Nice, creamy mouthfeel. All in all, an enjoyable stout."
"Pours a pitch black with a creamy off-white head,taste is very caramelly and of semi-sweet chocolate.The taste is roasted and chocolaty with some caramel sweetness almost like a snickers bar but not as sweet there is some nice nuttiness in the background.A real nice beer a liquid dessert."
"Notes: I usually prefer stouts at warmer temperatures. This is one that I truly enjoy equally both at refridgerated and cellar temperatures. I always drink one glass chilled and the other after it has warmed up a bit."
"This one is addictive!! Jet black appearance with a creamy, ever so slight, tan head that crawls down the glass as you drink it. Smell can't be beat for me....roasty, coffee, slight hints of chocolate, all at the perfect 'strength'. I love the smell of this one! Taste has some bitterness, sweetness, and coffee to it, with a possible slight alchohol warmth, particularly in the finish. Mouthfeel is very thick and creamy, but not quite as thick as a Chocolate Stout. Drinkability only gets a 4 for me, as it is sweet and thick....but, it is still a very drinkable stout to be as thick as it is. One of the best!"
"If feels great. Nice and smooth. I knocked points off for drinkability because of the sourness again. It just lends itself to a bit of a carbonated and tangy ending. I will still buy this stout. Very nicely done."
"Bottom line: yet another great beer from Rogue."
"i love rogue. they seem to be the can't miss brewery thus far. their shakespeare stout is another over-achiever. pours a dark dark black colour with a mighty, lasting, tan head. chocolate and malt smells prevail here. this is echoed in the taste, which is pure liquid paradise. this brew is heavy but light at the same time. a damn fine, damn creamy stout. no complaints. one of the best stouts i've ever had."
"Pours pretty much black with maybe the slightest hint of mahogony brown in there. The head is brown, thick , & frothy, with major lacing. Smell is of burnt coffee & vinous fruit. Rather fruity for a stout really. Taste is dominatred by tons of sweet maltiness and a fruity background. Quite florally hoppy as well There is some coffee in there as well as chocolate, but these flavors are'nt all that pronounced. There is also a marked alcohol taste. Mouthfeel is silky, yet finishes a bit gritty from thick carbonation trying to poke through such a heavy beer. A good stout, but it seems a bit ""all over the place"" to me. This beer can't decide what it wants to be."
"The malt and the hops are balanced very well in this beer. I didnt think I would like it, but the hops dont overrun the malt."
"I am not a big fan of Stouts that have a very heavy coffee taste to them; however, this particular Stout I really, really enjoyed drinking because it has a very mild coffee taste to it.This is a stout that I definitely would enjoy drinking again given the opportunity."
"This brew has a very strong roasted chocolaty aroma. The initial pour formed a small head of small dark brown bubbles. As the head died, it left a clinging vine lacing stubbornly letting go of the side of the glass. Its body is dark as midnight although some carbonation could be seen rising up the side of the glass. I eagerly await my initial taste. All of the stout ingredients are there in the taste, coffee, chocolate and roasted flavors greet my mouth as the first taste goes down and leaves a pleasant impression. Relatively smooth I thought and a bit more than I expected for a potentially good stout. No carbonation in the taste at all, no strong after bite and surprisingly smooth for a dark stout. A stout I can drink more of in a night and that says a lot right there."
"22oz bomber pours a deep black with a frothing dark tan head. Mild sweet aroma, bitterness with malt and hop prescence. Taste is where this bad boy really shines. A huge, bold mouthful gives way to exquisite bitter chocolate and espresso flavors, with a superb balance of hops. A long lasting bitter, dark chocolate aftertaste that makes me want more and more. An extremely well balanced Stout with excellent drinkability. Willy the Shake would be proud."
"Drinkablilty: Rich and endulgent but yet the body is light enough to enjoy on almost any occasion. A lovely example of an irish stout."
"Once again, the aroma was quite cascady (citrus/grapefruit) coupled with the roasty malts. The flavour was, firstly nicely chocolatey and roasty, but i think the hops ruined it too early, i like my stouts more roasty than this, save the hops for a good IPA or something. Quite a shame, because this has some lovely malts, ruined too early by the hops, still a very tasty brew, so i can't really complain."
"Full bodied and creamy. Burnt roast, espresso, and malt flavors up front. Hops cut right through all of those roast / burnt flavors to deliver a dry finish that has a lingering chocolate flavor. Quaffable in an extreme way."
"An impressive dark chocolate colored body lies beneath a thick layer of foamy, frothy tan head. The lace sticks and clings to the side of the glass. Heavy and rich roasted malt flavors roll with tastes of dark coffee, toffee and chocolate. The abundantly complex hops have citrus, spice and a light metallic tang to it. A slight camphor essence can be detected as can the fairly strong alcohol kick. This unfiltered, richly flavored Stout is really quite drinkable."
"Poured out black as night into my snifter.. Smell was of dark roast espresso with a twinge of hops. Taste was malty, with just a hint of molasses on the tongue, along with that really bitter black chocolate you get with a really high African cocoa bean content. Goes down velvety smooth and leaves nothing but a clean afterfeel on the palate. I will come back to this time after time..."
"Ebony black with small but impressive tan head that lingers. Aroma is cascade and a roasted graininess. Smooth on the palate, thick and creamy. Flavor is malty with a hint of chocolate and hop bitterness. Finishes drier than the other Rogue Stouts I've tried"
"The beer is classic stout color, black, with a dark tan head that when poured dissipates quickly, but remains as a slight ring around the glass. It has a mild citrusy hop aroma (Cascade hops) with dark malt character that blends together nicely. The beer tastes very dark, noting the use of roasted barley and chocolate malts (a little too heavy on the roasted barley). It is also flavored with Cascade hops which gives it a very pleasant hop flavor. It has a med. to heavy body, but is highly drinkable. This is not, in my opinion, one of their better beers, but is still better than many competitors offerings. My only complaint is that the hop flavor is hidden by the use of roasted barley. Nevertheless a great stout!"
"For a big beer this is an excellent drinkable stout wow wee..I need more sir!"
"Pours a dark brown head which provides very good lacing. Solid black beer. It has a pleasant aroma -- mostly of wood. It also has a wicker-sweet smell. Tastes malty and creamy. Delicious and thick like a full meal. A very good Irish Stout. Clean aftertaste, too."
"This stout is such an evil pleasure, the burned and bitter flavours are so intense, and they've somehow made this wonderfully drinkable. I haven't figured out how they did this yet. This is my first Rogue beer, and I'm deeply impressed."
"This beer is calm but somewhat complex. Not as loud and exciting as some others but far from average. Instead, the essence of balance and quiet intrique for a stout."
"The flavor is intense, complex, and changing as you drink. Roasted/burnt malt, bitter chocolate, and espresso. The malt mellows out as it lingers on the tongue, and the tingly aftertaste of bitter hops, bitter chocolate, and dark coffee sets in. The only criticism is that the mouthfeel is just a bit watery, and could be fuller. Otherwise, a tremendous selection. Just remembered there's more in the bottle..."
"And thank Hamlet's revenge it comes in a 22 oz bomber to tout!"
"""What fools these mortals be!"" if they don't like this stout! No ""toil and trouble"" needed to enjoy..."
"Well Shakespeare can keep his fame and bask in the pitch blackness of this stout to boot. A tan color topped off the rocky head which had very little lace. The smell was not overly complex with the standard smoked malt flavors. Better than guiness for sure, but the smell was nothing to compose a sonnet about. The taste was very well balanced with roasted nut, and bitter chocolate tastes complimenting notes of charred wood. The mouthfeel was very sharp and cut through the rounded malts. I would surly give my safety for a pot of this stout and the only tragedy was I had but one bomber."
"This is a truly legendary brew and well deserving of its name. The Great Bard would be proud that his Rogue bears his name."
"All in all a very solid brew that is very enjoyable to drink. You'll savor every sip. The world Stout Champion comes through as-advertised. Pick this one up. Enjoy!"
"I poured this beer from a 22oz. bottle into a tulip glass, forming about 1 finger of a deep caramel/rootbeer brown head. The color was black at night, no red hues like other stouts, just pure black. The head dies down soon to a small line. The smell is packed with roasted coffee and chocolate aromas. Best smelling stout I've ever had! The taste is a direct reflection of the smell, smooth coffee flavor with a little smokiness. You also get all 69 IBUs of hops from this one. The hops have a nice bite, very delicious. The mouthfeel is good and strong. One thing about this beer as I drink it, there is absolutely no lace on the glass. The drinkability is alright, this is a good finishing beer. It also gets better as it warms."
"Drinkability: Again, given that this is only 6.2% ABV, I really don't notice the alcohol content and it helps make this a very drinkable beer. Another winner from Rogue!"
"I begin this review by saying that I am not a Rogue fan nor do I like overowering hops. This beer came from the tap with a good head and a deep dark color. The lace clung to the sides of the glass. The hops attacked my nose and kept whatever malt from coming in. The bitterness on the tongue blasted away the sweet chocolate I thought I could taste in the background. The beer was so hoppy that this business kept the mouthfeel deep in the background. At best, I would rate this as a specialty beer and hope that no one tryig their first stout would tackle this hop monster."
"Pours a deep black, with a creamy dark head, quickly dimishes to almost no lacing. Aroma is roasty, smoky, some chocolate, lightly hoppy (floral mostly). Flavor is strong with the chocolate and roasted malts (coffee), with a mild hops bitterness showing in the finish. Very smooth and creamy in the mouth."
"I couldn't change a thing about this perfect potion. Some stouts may be more bold or brash in alcohol or flavor, but none is more perfectly integrated in all it's parts and easily drunk and thoroughly enjoyed. Truly, the stuff dreams are made of!"
"A great stout!!! My first sip of this beer exploded in my mouth with flavor. A smokey flavor took over first, followed by a lovely chocolate. The beer looks as dark as dark can be when it's poured into a glass. The aroma of chocolate and coffee invites your senses to experience this beer. The dark beer with its head color of a coffee latee' residing perfectly above the separation line. A good stout that is very drinkable."
"F."
"The only reason I am not rating this a 5, is that I have never rated a beer perfect yet! Pours a deepest darkest brown hue, with a solid tan head. Superb flavors abound, Chocolate is right beside toffee, coffee, and caramel, with enough hops to keep everybody in line, one great beer!"
"Dark and black color with light brown head with a pale tannish head. Aroma is typical roasted hops and malts. Flavor is similiar and is very well balanced. Not a very hoppy-bitter stout like SN. I repeat, this beer is extremely well balanced. This makes it easy to drink and appeasing to someone who might have been turned off by some other imperial stout. An easy drinking brew, but it might become a little boring after a few."
"Pours black with a beautiful light brown head. Nose is burnt caramel, and roasted barley. Taste is extremely well balanced with a very smooth, earthy malt taste with a bit of malt crispness. A little hop bitterness. Chocolately aftertaste, with a bit of citrus. Fantastically smooth mouthfeel. Drinkability is good. I'll come back to this one again and again. Probably tops my list of stouts."
"I’m not sure, but this stout I’ll gladly drink."

"Overall the best Rogue product I have ever had. IMHO most Rogue products are way to thin in the body department (for my taste), but this one is just right for the flavors they have blended together. This Rogue deserves much praise and kudos."
"This brew was all black with a creamy tan head that stuck around for quite some time. There was also good lacing. The smell was a nice malty sweetness and a whiff of bitterness. The first thing that hits the pallet is the chocolate. The middle was sort of coffee like and the end was balanced out well with a nice little hoppy ending. The mouthfeel of this brew was not as heavy as I thought it would be but it wasn't bad by any means. This brew went down smooth and easy. Overall I enjoyed this beer a great deal and will definitely purchase again."
"Have had it in the bottle before, and remember loving it. So, I saw it on the hand pump at The Sharp Edge Creekhouse and I couldn't pass it up. This beer is huge, the appearance is a deep ruby black body with a nice pillowing tannish brown head. The first sniff, I was shocked at the amount of cascade hop aroma that hit me in the face. The deep chocolate and coffee tones make this beer's aroma irrisistable. As I took my first couple sips, I just sat and thought to myself that this must be one of the most drinkable in your face stouts I have come across at this point. It is wonderful, pushes the envelop and with the harsher flavor of the dark malts on the tongue, the clashing of the hops are there to mellow everything out and form this amazing brew. On the cask this beer is very smooth, and inviting to the palate. Each sip takes on a creamier sensation to the mouth. Believe it or not this is the type of stout that could be enjoyed in pairs or more, because once you have one you want your glass to be full again."
"Initial taste impression is of smoothness. There are no harsh or out-of-place notes. While the malt is creamy and smooth it is balanced by crisp grain flavours and a strong underpinning of cocoa. The foundation of grain flavours shows the mix of barley, malt, hops and oats in perfect balance. The aftertaste is clean, citric with a fading hop and coffee cleanser. Primary impressions at the end are of balance and smoothness. This shows off the talents of a top-notch brewer in action. Love it."
"Alright, enough of the blatant Shakespeare ripoff. As I poured this brew I thought it had to be the darkest brew I've ever seen. It looks like motor oil, completely opaque. Lots of roasted barley and a touch of molasses on the nose with some citrusy hops coming through as well. The taste is extremely well balanced. Roasted barley, chocolate, a bit of citrus, a tiny amount of caramel sweetness and just hint of smoke. Outstanding! I wish the mouthfeel was a wee bit thicker on this one. It is more reminiscent of a Porter in that respect. But the good far outweighs my nitpicking. Way to go Rogue!!"
"This beer poured into the glass a deep dark black. No light could penetrate this beer. The head was a medium cocoa brown that was thick and rich. Not only in color, but, in all aspects, very nice and lasting. The lace that was left on the sides of the glass was very good and stretched a good way to the end of the glass and kept the color of the head even as it dried. The aroma was of roasted malt, sweet coffee, hints of dark molasses and floral hops. The tastes were of malt, bitter chocolate, sweet coffee and hops all over the tongue. It finished with sweet chocolate coffee with a bite of hops at the end. This is one of those good beers that only improves as it sits and rises in temperature. Not a thick beer as some of the stouts that I have tried, but it held up very well. A very good beer and a very good beer maker."
"I am really starting to love Rogue. This beer poured a nice dark brownish black with a great head of brown bubbles. The taste, oh the taste! Great roasted coffee, with hints of chocalate and other delectibles. Went down smooth, almost too smooth, as I pounded the bottom of the empty bottle like I was looking for some more ketpcup. A great beer."
"Cheers"
"The beer pours that deep rich jet black color that so typifies the stout style, the head elephantine in size, the consistency frothy, the color a deep chocolate brown with the resultant lace a thick and glutinous sheet to smother the glass. The aromas of rich roasted malt, coffee, brown sugar sweet, also a light hop floral scent to seal off the nose. Start is bitter chocolate sweet, malt and the top thick and chewy, with a finish that is hop bitter and purposeful in its bite. The carbonation moderate and the aftertaste dry and long lasting. Quite a good stout in my books and one I enjoy often when a big beer is called for."
"This is a beers beer! So bloody good. One of the best stouts I have ever had. poured out blackish dark browm with a one inch dark tan head. Smooth in character and charming with it's mellow taste. This beer goes down real easy with quite conversation. Mmmmmmmmm"
"With its subtle flavor, at least for the style, this isn't the biggest stout around and it's not going to assault or overwhelm your tastebuds. But that's just fine by me. In my judgment, this is one of the best beers produced in the U.S."
"The taste was better than I expected. It was slightly sharp with a nice roasty malt flavor with hints of coffee and little to no bitter after taste. It was not as heavy as I expected, there was little carbonation, and left a dry feeling after each drink."
"Comes in a 650mL pretty plain dark bottle with a very proud man holding a mug. Pours with a small tannish head that reduces to a lace fairly quickly. I really enjoy the opaque darkness and pretty delightful stout mouthfeel. My initial taste impression was burnt, slightly bitter coffee, and a faint chocolate malt taste on the way down. I wasn't too impressed. The bitterness lasted in a long disappointing aftertaste. I know it has it's place, but not a stout I will buy again. I recently had a Storm King Stout that was WAY better than Shakespeare while being higher in ABV."
"Pours an opaque, dark, dark brown to black with a beautiful chocolate brown head which is very creamy and inviting. Really an incredibly handsome beer. The bouquet is filled with roasted grains, coffee, must (old library books), cigarette smoke, perhaps anise, and olives/olive brine. On palette, dryness and sourness balanced by roasted malt sweetness with notes of bubblegum, espresso, chocolate, oak, and fruit. A distinctively quaffable stout, very well-balanced and full of character and just really solidy put-together in terms of the harmony achieved in brewing."
"Definately one of the better stouts. It's a nice dark black color, I couldn't see any light through it. It was like a black hole or something. The head didn't last too long, but it was a reddish/brown color, almost burnt sienna color. The taste was like a cappacino with some hints of olives. The after taste was more or a smooth semi-chocolately one. All in all, a good buy, and stands up to the hype."
"By far the best stout out there."
"I think Shakespeare is my favorite tasting stout. Seems to hit the chocolate notes just right, and anytime I've had another stout in comparison, the Rogues' taste wins out. Pours as dark as can be, medium to rich mouthfeel. Quite hoppy (although nowhere near as overwhelming as the Imperial). A wonderfully drinkable beer, that is amongst my favorites. Does finish a little dry, and I never seem to feel the ""kick"" that one would expect from a 6+% ABV. Overall, small shortcomings for a terrific beer!"
"I saved this one for the last beer of the night, which helps to explain why my notes are so hard to read. Aroma was chocolate and hops. Taste was coffee and chocolate. My light-beer-drinking roommate wrote down ""soy sauce"" for some reason. I didn't find it salty or tasting anything like soy sauce. After drinking Rogue Mocha Porter I was expecting more of a hop presence. Still a very good stout, but the Shakespeare seemed closer to Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout than some of the other Rogue beers I've tried. Perhaps the preceding SN Celebration dulled my taste buds."
"Thank you ZAP, budgood1 and Road Warrior for bringing this beer to me."
"-Oelergud"
"As black as night. With a nice tan cloud cover. Rogue's trademark hoppiness is present in the nose along with a nice toasty aroma. This is my favorite style of stout. Dry and hoppy. Not too rich, making it very drinkable in the long haul. A session stout if there ever was one. An after taste almost like burnt toast and I mean that in the most yummy sense of burnt toast (the die hards know what I mean). This might be my favorite stout ever, I have to think about it. While I finish my pint."
"A true heavyweight...the creaminess of this is really something...thick, rich and creamy...nose is of darkened grains..chocolate and even some raw leather....midnight black with a scarlet black mixed lace...For a sweet stout this has some serious hopping...a real dry finish....up front is the darkened malt...dark chocoloate...some espresso notes...like I said a real dry finish.....kind of a mix between a sweet stout and a dry stout....It has the craminess and complexity of a sweet stout but the finish of a dry stout...whatever the case this a great stout...not for the light hearted..."
"this beer is so nice and creamy, like chocolate milk. it is rich and smooth, and just a delite to drink. it has a whole lot going on in the flavor. you get coffee, dark malts, and a little chocolate for the most part. it is also hopped a good deal to balance it out. an absolutely wonderful stout."
"Quite thick and creamy in the mouth. Complexity is off the charts. Has so many flavors to pick out; coffee, almond, dark chocolate, and some burnt malts. Plenty of hops in there as well to balance things out perfectly. Old Bill makes a great stout!"
"Very dark black with a tan head that lasts and lasts. The smell is malt, chocolate and coffee. The first thing that you notice about the taste is how smooth it is. Nothing is overpowering, the hops and malt blend together to make something that is very balanced. A very great stout but I can't stop comparing it to Storm King. I know that it isn't in the same style but I can't stop comparing it to Storm King. Truly one of the best that I will go back for."
"Jet black with a boatload of dark brown head that seemed to last forever. Drank this one over the course of 40 minutes and the head always seemed to be present. Roasted malt aromas were very evident and pleasing, but not much complexity to them. Quite hoppy with a nice, balancing sweetness. The more you drink the more the various malt flavors come out (chocolate, roasted coffee). First impressions were that the beer was all hops, but once my tongue got acquainted to it the beer showed it had a lot more to offer. A wonderful beer."
"Anyway; This dark and creamy stout has a very brown head that sets it off from other stouts. Also there is a rather surprisingly good hoppiness to this stout. This is no Guiness - So don't drink this wanting to compare to guiness. It is not creamy but more buttery in texture. a very good stout. If you want a comparison try Old Rasputin."
"At first, the hops seem a little out of character for a stout, but after a few sips, it works well. The mouthfeel is very creamy and smooth, with minimal carbonation evident on the tongue. It is also a very drinkable brew. I drank half a pint in no time, which made me glad it is a 22 ounce bottle. This is one fine beer that I will not hesitate to buy again."
"Pours a syrupy black, no head at all. Big aromas of dark-roasted coffee, dark chocolate, ripe fruit, with an earthy, musty sort of smell underneath. There's more carbonation than meets the eye, lending a sandpapery mouthfeel. Roasted flavors are big--there's a huge malt profile here. Coffee-like and caramel maltiness blend with the roasted flavors, but there is also a strong bitterness that really helps prop the brew up. I wouldn't want more than one at any given time, but this is a very flavorful, interesting stout."
"Pured black as a moonless night. The beer seemed to come out in chunks because it was so viscous. There was little head but what was there was a tan color. I smelled some dark fruits and some bitterness. The taste is like sucking on espresso beans. Nice hops bitterness. It sort of reminds me of some Imperial Stouts. Finish seems to be on the dry side. Maybe a bit of creaminess it. I thought it might be overrated but I don't knock it for being so highly praised."
"Poured jet black with a small disappearing head that leaves an appealing tan head for the duration. A caramel aroma with some grapefruit hints seems ordinary. Shakespeare goes down very easy with a great roasted flavor. This bomber went very quickly, i'm disappointed the packy only had one cause i want more!"
"Very nice appearance: dark black with a very nice, full, long lasting dark tan head. A very pleasant smell, somewhat sweet and malty. The initial mouthfeel was of carbonation: sharp, malty, with coffee and dark chocolate overtones, with a somewhat sharp/bitter aftertaste. The taste was good: smooth, but a tad more bitter in the aftertaste than I prefer. The mouthfeel was good and smooth, but a bit carbonated if warm. The drinkability is good, though the bitter/sour aftertaste was a turn off. I found that this beer tasted much better if served chilled rather than at room temperature."
"I have become a big Rogue fan and I would have to say that Stouts (all) are my favorite beers, but this beer I found to be only good, not great. The color is black with a medium brown head that is thick after the pour but fades quickly. The smell is hoppy, but I didn't notice much else. The taste was just bland IMO. I caught some hints of malt and coffee but nothing really stood out. I think with beers that I expect to be good, that I often feel let down when I try them. That may be the case here. Altogether, this is surely a good beer, just less than I thought."
" Another true work of art from the good people at Rogue."
"updated 3/04"
"This stout exemplifies balance just as well as or better than any stout I've tried. Pours opaque with a frothy brown head that lasts indefinitely. Nose is of the roasted variety with a bit of chocolate and coffee characters. Taste is nearly unsurpassed. Notes of hoppy bitterness, bittersweet chocolate, roasted malt and coffee are all there. Excellent mouthfeel. Finish lingers for what seems like forever. It's hard to get enough of this blissful stout."
"Note: this beer was #3 in Stuart Kallen's ""The 50 Greatest Beers in the World"""
"22 oz bottle, pours black as night, nice tan head, aroma of roasted malts and strange citrusy hop smell, well balanced roasted malt and cofffee flavor, this stout has a nice hop bite, and finishes sort of dry."
"To sum up, I think this is an amazing beer, and one that I always grab at least one bottle of when the weekend comes. Having said that, I think it could be improved upon by going easier on the hops."
"This is an excellent stout!  22 oz ""bomber"".  Pours out black with a thick, medium brown head.  Aroma combines sweet scents of  chocolate, caramel, oats and coffee.  Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and full-bodied.  Tastes are of chocolate, oatmeal, coffee and roasted malts.  There's a smoky bitterness in the finish.  This is the first Rogue beer that I've tried and I have to admit that I'm very impressed."
"This Stout is praiseworthy of it's top rating.  No doubt about it, this is one damn fine brew!  Drink up!"
"   I must stop now and get another."
" For some reason, the flavor of this really reminds me of being at the beach on a cold day and has almost a saltwater quality to it, and I mean that as a compliment. This was one of the best beers I've had to date. Not quite as good as Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout, but better than Storm King."
"Pours black with brown highlights, looks like molasses when being poured. Cappucino colored head that starts out big and settles into a thin sheet with wispy lacing. Aroma is of hops and chocolate malt. Very creamy and chewy mouthfeel. Flavors of chocolate, some roasted malt, coffee, and hops. Perfectly balanced,  I did not find this to be too bitter, more of a roasted or bitter chocolate than a predominating hop bitterness. Finishes nicely with a tingle on the tounge and coffee aftertaste. Absolutely delicious, and amazingly easy to drink. Glad I picked this one as my birthday brew. Simply amazing."
"This big stout poured a very deep brown black, the head was bordering on brown.  A roasty nose dominates and a good roasted finish coates your palate.  A smooth yet very hoppy stout (66 Ibu's) very well balanced and decadent.  It packs a wallop at almost 8% so a near perfect to perfect drinkability score, at least for me is denied.  Excellent stout from a fine brewery."
"NICE ONE ROGUE!!!!"
"Pours a very dark brown - almost black - body capped by a full, foamy, dark brown head that drops but keeps a solid collar and decent surface covering. Lacing is minor with just some thin lace throughout the glass. The aroma is lightly sweet and cocoa-ish with some sharp fruit (citrusy hops combined?) but only minimal roastiness. The body is thin/medium with a tiny bubbled moderate carbonation that gently caresses the tongue. The flavor grabs your attention with a sharp acrid bite upfront, then reveals a dark fruitiness, roasted malt, and then light cocoa. Although it's substantial bitterness is noticeable from the start, it finishes dry with a flourish of even more prominent bitterness, some hop flavor, and a lingering roastiness. It starts big and finishes big! Quite bold. An interesting beer to linger over as it reveals itself more fully once warmed."
"Thanks bditty187 for the trade so I could review this beer!"
"I know there is no such thing as the ""perfect beer", but if you compare this beer to other stouts you have had... it will be ""the stout"".  Conplex, refined, and proof that an American Craft  Brewery can produce a world class stout.  I finally know now why this style is called ""stout""... it stands on solid foundations.  Yummmmmm!"
"Pours a beautiful thick black with a large 3 finger brown head that hangs around leaving a lace down the glass.  The smell of the cascade hops and roasted chocolate are evident and smells absolutely delicious.  Wow!  Great brew with flavors of chocolate roasted malt with the hops balanced superbly and the chocolate hangs around to the end.  This beer has a very creamy mouthfeel and leaves your mouth begging for another swallow.  Only my second perfect 5 in 100 reviews.  I couldn't find anything wrong with it, period!  What a way to enter the mug club and I was saving it for that!  Cheers!"
"Palate is out of balance for this taster - too much hop flavor.  Not too much bitterness, but it tastes almost like a hop tea rather than a beer.  There is some nice malt, coffee and bitter notes, but they are simply overwhelmed by the cascade flavor.  Definitely a quality brew, but not to my taste."
"This is a thick, black beer with a dense, creamy, tan head.  Great roasted grain and hop aroma.  Drinking sensation is full and heavy, and the taste is intriguingly bitter.  Coffee, caramel, and roasted/burnt grains.  The bitter finish is simply outstanding. I keep thinking that this is what other stouts aspire to be when they grow up."
"In my opinion, no other stout in the world compares as far as I have tasted. This is the best stout I have tasted, bar none. Get some now!"
"Black, nearly opaque, with an impressive dark tan foam topping it.  This settles, but stays pretty thick and leaves patchy lace.  Dark chocolate aroma with some citrus and fruity hop character mixed in.  Great malt/hop balance in the taste.  Chocolate in the front and citrus in the finish.  A bit of roasted/coffee character in between.  Fantastic mouthfeel, probably the smoothest stout I've tried!  Great complexity, Close to full-bodied, but you could say it's medium-full bodied.  Just a wonderful taste from start to finish.  Exceptionally drinkable!  I can see this being a regular favorite of mine."
"What a great beer. It was more bitter than I expected, but after the initial surprise I just sat back and enjoyed it. Strong chocolate aroma. Almost black color with a thin but beautifully dark brown head. This is definitely on my ""buy again"" list."
"This beer pours a very black color, with a thin brown head. The head doesnt stay as long as expected. There are slight smells of coffee beans and chocolate on the first sip. Upon first taste one notices spice and malt, and a hint of coffee and clove. This is a good example of a stout, not quite as creamy as i would have liked, but very good as far as stouts go. I would definately reccomend this beer to my friends."
"Great opaque brown color. The head is colored too; only it doesn't stick to the glass, has large bubbles and disappears quickly. The aromas are of candied dark-roast coffee beans, peat and carob. The taste is straightforward: mildly sweet and infused with sweet spices, coffee, potatoes, and charred radicchio. The finish is pleasantly dry and lingers just long enough to seem relevant. Not a bad stout at all. Can someone fill me in on the Shakespeare connection? Is this what he drank? I thought he was more of an ESB guy."
"Also, huge kudos to Rogue for putting *so much* information about their beer right on the bottle.  IBUs, Hop type, malt type, specific gravity, it's all right there!  Rogue is the only company I know of that does this."
"Pours blacker than black with a very creamy brown head that leaves a nice lace all the way down the glass.  Strong chocolate aromas as well as some dark roasted coffee.  There is also some nice piney/grapefruity bitter smell to this brew.  Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate.  Tons of chocolate in thsi brew, especially as it warms.  Good coffee characteristics as well and only a small amount of perceived bitterness due to the cascades but not very much actual hop taste/flavor.  Smooth and chewy mouthfeel that is definitely contributed to by the oats that are added.  This is one awesomely drinkable beer and is one of my all time favorites.  It is definitely very deserving of it's spot on the top beers."
"This stout looks as delicious as it tastes. The head retained its fine froth the entire time I drank it. Viscous, black stout with a reddish, coffee colored head. Slight coffee/burnt aroma; burnt toast nose leading to a very slight sweetness at the rear of the palette. Nice chewy mouthfeel, probably due to the oats. Maybe a hair too much carbonation in my 22-oz bottle. Finish is quick and hoppy; aftertaste deliciously roasty and bitter. One of my favorite stouts- nice and dry but not thin."
"Fabulous stout!  Too dry for me personally, however."
"This was exceptional.  Opaque, black and beautiful with a thin brown head.  The lack of head retention is the only thing that kept it from a five in appearance.  Chocolate and roasted malt in the aroma.  The flavor was coffee/roasted malt, which lasted forever on the tongue.  The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy-almost satin on the tongue.  This is one of the best stouts out there."
"My second favorite stout as of this tasting. Inky dark in color with a hint of chocolate flavor with a malty after taste. Has a little bitter tang on finish. But a pleasant bitter after taste. One to keep in my stock!"
"I've just returned from a local restaurant/beer bar where I had the Shakespeare Stout (ok, well two of them) along with dinner. Very tasty (with a very agreeable finish) though a bit thinner than I would have expected. This is a minor quibble though as this is one of the best stouts I've ever had. Highly recommended, esp in the big bottles."
"Absolutely seek and enjoy this brew, you are doing an injustice otherwise.  The best stout.  !Viva Rogue!  Cheers!"
"This heavy stout has a sticky heavy dark tan head and a very dark color.  Heavy malt aroma gives hints of the thick heavy body.  This is one of the most bitter stouts out there.  Nice roasted flavor with chocolate undertones.  Not the best, but not bad."
"Well not much I can say, that hasn't already been stated. I thought this was great. Jet black color, very thick, is it going to make it out of the bottle ? Nice thick tan head, little oily drops dancing on top. Smell was sweet and bitter at the same time. I really noticed the roasted fruit and malt. Tasted better than it smelled.Very even taste, sweet, the fruit, malt, and touch of hops as well. Very good, mesermerizing beer, I just looked at it and wondered how it could taste so good. This also at the top of my list. I have only 1 left of 6. Bummer."
"Deep opaque color; dark as night.  Deep tan head with loose carbonation.  Big chocolate nose.  Flavor is part creamy, part bitter, but with an incredible lightness for such a flavorful beer."
"140"
"Whatever. Please, sir, may I have another?"
"Get thee to the brewery"
"Man, this is an awesome stout.  Pours out motor oil black, darkest beer I've seen in a long time.  The head was light brown, not massive, but ample and smells of roasted malt.  Then comes a complete flavor explosion upon entering the mouth.  We got sweet chocolate, coffee, a sort of charcoal, and earthy flavors all combining for make one of the most complex stouts I've had.  It went down smooth easy, like the good stuff it is.  I was going to have dinner with this but ended up being dinner itself.  It finished off with a almost undecernable bitterness.  This is one of the best and I highly recommend it."
"Very nice dark cannot see light through it...Good sign.Nice malty and slight mint on the nose.Deep mocha malt in your mouth,with a medium dry finish."
"It's black and beautiful.  Many flavors are bouncing off each other:  chocolate, coffee, and others I haven't yet been able to put my finger on.  However, it wasn't quite as chunky as I expected.  I would like to try it on draught."
"This may well be the best stout I've ever tasted.  It was as black as a starless midnight with a thick creamy brown head.  Interesting, and damn fine, aroma of roasted barley and a bit of citrusy hops.  Nice thick, rich stout with an incredible flavor!"
"Midnight black with one of the darkest heads ever, deep auburn with those even darker last drips from the pour. Really great lace as well, intricate crown-of-thorns patterns. Sweet smell, some whiffs of dehydrated, concentrated strawberry. Darn-near perfect mouthfeel, heavy and rich but not at all syrupy. Chocolate flavors with a hint of vanilla and berry in a very consistent statement. Solid roast and an impressive and distinguishing hop bite to the back flavor. This is a dang OUTSTANDING Stout, just first rate in all categories. Man, it is good."
"This is as high as I think I've ever rated a beer.  Wonderful, outstanding, refreshing, flavorful....I could go on and on.  This pours to a beautiful dark color with amber hints in the lace and foam.   A wonderful mouthfeel is followed by a near-perfect taste all the way through.  There is something magical that happens to stouts when oats are added.  It becomes a food, an event, a happening and not just a drink.  Yum."
"Oh my gosh, this was a good beer. I'm a huge stout fan to start with, but this is a great stout. The appearance was great. It was like a big black mass topped by a lightly colored chocolate milkshake. The head was very creamy, especially considering it wasn't nitrous dispensed. Allergy season is kicking in right now so I couldn't get much out of the smell, but what I did get was nice. The taste is great, a little more roasted/burned bitterness than most of the other stouts I've tried, but it was backed up by a full, rich flavor. Combined with the mouthfeel it tasted like a drinking a glass of thin chocolate milk with a good bit less lactic sweetness (although I may have picked up some of that) and a healthy shot of dark chocolate espresso. This beer would be frightening if nitrous dispensed."
"Every beer that I had from Rogue was great! They have so many great beers!"
"Seriously hopped up stout. A strong pour will give you a beautiful chocolate milk head that leaves a spidery lace. Roast malt body finishes clinging dry grapefruit. More hop flavor than your typical stout makes this beer a treat. Well worth a taste if you've only tried Irish stouts."
"This is one of my favorite stouts.  Long lasting aroma, long lasting creamy head, and it also comes in a cool 650ml bottle."
"if only my morning coffee was this good.....pours out black with a vigorous brown head which unfortunately died too quickly.  hints of burnt caramel and chocolate malts with a subdued cascade hops aroma....the taste is exceptional with bitter malts and hops balancing out the profile...a burnt coffee finish with the hops lingering on....but the hops aren't overwhelming which of course is desired in a stout...but the hops (of course...it's a rogue) dance on the tounge enough to break up any creamy slickness that is usual for stouts.  a ""hophead"" stout for sure, but balanced enough to appeal traditional stout drinkers. yummy!"
"Dark tan head that is both creamy and lacy, sticks to the side of your glass as you drink it. Massive roasted smell compared to other stouts, with a hint of astringency. BIG Roasted barley assault upfront on the palate with a strong hop bitterness and no hop aroma, slight aftertaste of licorice and bitter chocolate. Thick mouthfeel that also seems to ""fizz"" on your tounge slightly. This is a big, bold, black and beautiful stout, and why I love the style... very heavy, which is what I drink a stout for..."
"My first Rogue. This is a great looking beer, pitch black with a light brown, foamy head. Oddly, the aroma is almost nonexistent. What strikes me is the carbonation, both the look of it as you swirl it in your glass, and the feel of it on your tongue. I couldn't detect much chocolate in the taste, but rather a very dark (almost burnt) espresso. Overall, a nice beer, and an impressive introduction to Rogue."
"Pitch black, dark tan head.  Full bodied, rich, malty, yet bitter-sweet.  Cocoa and smoked notes.  Like an oatmeal stout and a porter in one.  Very filling.  Unfortunately my 22oz bottle cost $4."
"Opaque, black appearance.  Faint aroma.  Coffee malt taste with pleasant bitter aftertaste.  Reasonably full bodied with a creamy texture.  Pretty good stout, very smooth and mellow."
"Notes: This is a cult classic American stout, drink and learn. Balanced to perfection and a sheer delite to drink."
"I opened a twelve ounce bottle that I had been keeping for a cold day.  Having had this before, I knew what I was in for.  I love the bitterness combined with sweetness.  A slight burnt flavor gives keeps you on your toes.  It did not have much of a head, so I was a little dissapointed.  But hey,what a beer."
"Exceptional pretty much sums up this fave stout of mine.Reminds me of a Sierra Nevada stout kicked up a couple o' notches. Roasty, chocolaty & chewy...I think you could stand a spoon on end in this one! Can Rogue do no wrong I ask?"
"Awww yeeah; this is the good, good stuff."
"Full bodied stout that starts out with intense roasted malt and barley and finishes with subtle hop bitterness. One of the better stouts I've quaffed."
"This beer is truly a force to be reckoned with. A remarkable stout. Another big winner in the Rogue portfolio."
"The beer smells good, but can't match the marvelous toffee, chocolate and coffee flavors that emerge.  Suitable for both bar drinking or as a dessert.  Another masterwork from Rogue."
"Not as sweet as an English stout, nor as dry as an Irish.  A unique middle ground."
"A stout loaded with Cascade hops?  It works beautifully.  Tastes like bittersweet chocolate liquor.  Has been my favorite stout for a while, and probably will be for the rest of my life.  (perhaps with the exception of Pike XXXXX stout)  If you can't decide between an IPA and a stout, have a Willy Shakes and have your cake and eat it too!"
"If you love Stout, you have to love this one....the Irish should be ashamed and turn to Portland, Oregon to satisfy their love for a style that their own breweries have long forgotten how to make.  Both the Shakespeare and it's seasonal variant Wild Irish Rogue are stunning examples of what you can do with dark roasted malts and a love of the brewing art."
