In any event, to the pint glass! The beer pours a dark blackish color with deep brown edges in the light. Small 1 finger tannish/light brown head. Some retention and lacing but not much. The aroma is roasty sweetness with a hint of hop character and a noticeably biscuity malt tone. The beer tastes rich with roasted barley, mild bitterness, a subdued malty sweetness. Feels silky.

The beer tastes like a good hearty oatmeal stout should: lots of bitter chocolate, a whim of oats, and a slightly dry finish. The mouthfeel is spot-on for a stout.

Nicely creamy, medium body with a nice light roast throughout lending just a touch of bitterness. Cocoa powder mid palate. Good malt profile, a solid oatmeal stout but nothing new or groundbreaking here.","Ineedabeerhere","Sep 25, 2010"
3.77,-0.5,4.5,2.5,4,4,4.5,"This is definitely a sold, above average Oatmeal Stout, with a well above average drinkability to go with it.","EgadBananas","Aug 10, 2010"
3.8,0.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Very smooth body maybe a touch too much carbonation. Very drinkable light oatmeal stout. I'm really glad these guys are finally bottling.","bfields4","Jul 16, 2010"
3.68,-2.9,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Not a bad beer but I think I had certain expectations of it as an oatmeal stout (more creamy, less dry) that made me like it less. Maybe if it was just called a stout I might have rated it a bit higher.","busternuggz","Jul 03, 2010"
3.88,2.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle. Pouring the beer it looks reminiscent of cola, with a nicely building sudsy tan head. You have to pour this beer somewhat aggressively to get any kind of head out of it. You can really smell the oatmeal in the nose, with some chocolate and burnt molasses. The flavor to this beer is an explosion. The first taste is amazing, with lots of bittersweet chocolate, roasted oatmeal, and caramel sweetness coming through. There's some hints of coffee here, though they are muted. The hops profile also adds a light fruitiness to the whole affair. Light mouthfeel, not creamy or thick, but drinkable in it's own way. Honestly, for my money it's right up there with Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout as one of the best examples of the style you can find.","eclaycamp","Jan 28, 2010"
4.07,7.4,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Nice, light body for a light, session stout. The oats don't thicken the body here so much as they make for a silkier, healthier texture moving across the tongue. The relatively low ABV% helps to make this a nice choice to enjoy a couple of pints of.","Reaper16","Jul 08, 2009"
4.22,11.3,4,4.5,4,5,4,"A very good, thick roasty mouthfeel. Was pretty drinkable because it wasn't too hoppy.","acelin","Jun 19, 2009"
3.8,0.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Enjoyed at the brewery. Pours near black with a nice tan head. Nose is very oaty with some chocolate, roasted malts and light hops. Taste is well balanced and easy to drink. Again lots of cocoa, oats and dark malt. Clean body is well carbonated. Good stuff.","rye726","Aug 25, 2008"
3.97,4.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"D - This is a very good oatmeal stout. It has a great blend of sweet and bitter.","zeff80","Jul 22, 2008"
3.88,2.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability is fairly high. Tatse is good and alcohol is presumeably low making for a nice session.","Goliath","Beers"
3.98,5,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Fine dense black shade. The nose has plenty of coffee with a sweet liquor/scotch ale accent. Light in the front with some fruit and a nice roast at the back with some bitterness (grapefruit?) at the finish. Lighter mouth feel leaves a smoother stout drinking experience.","damuraus","0"
3.73,-1.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"D-Decent but this would be served better on nitro. A bit more body umph couldn't hurt either. Not bad but this place has better offerings.","Deuane","Dec 13, 2006"
3.78,-0.3,4,3.5,4,3,4,"Both of the Free State Brewing Company beers that I drank with my lunch yesterday have potential. They're already good, but they need more ingredients (especially more malt) in order to be memorable. Although Oatmeal Stout wasn't quite good enough to warrant a growler purchase, I'll probably order it again if I ever make it back to Lawrence.","BuckeyeNation","Oct 22, 2006"
3.38,-10.8,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall: This is a very easy oatmeal stout to drink. I like a lot of the Free State Brews.","jazappi","Jan 02, 2006"
3.93,3.7,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Draught @ Free State: This one pours a very dark, fairly opaque brown with a tan head. It did leave some lacing down the glass. The aroma was somewhat milder. There are hints of roasted malt and chocolate to the nose. The taste is very smooth, with some roastiness and chocolate. A nice stout.","Boto","Mar 08, 2005"

4.07,7.4,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This oatmeal stout pours smooth and possesses a small tan head which eventually reduces to a lacey web. The aroma is of roasted hops with a slight hint of chocolate. It hits the mouth with that same maltiness then transitions to an expresso / chocolate follow-through. This stout is easy to drink, and not as thick as some. It definately is not watery, however. This is a good stout, but not great.","KansasNate","Feb 09, 2003"
3.57,-5.8,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"A nice dark brown with some light seeping through. A small head. Aromas of roasted malts most noticable. Nice palate of roasted malts, some coffee and a nice roundness from the oats. Mouthfeel is on the light side, but still very flavorful with a lingering finish. Overall, a very nice stout. Easy-drinking and pleasant. Well worth a try.","winomark","Feb 08, 2003"
3.06,-19.3,4,3,3,3,3,"Dark brown, almost black, reddish highlights, smallish brown head, soapy retention, good lace though. Faint nose, hint of sweet-malt... clean. Underlying hop bitterness mingles with the lightly roasted malt. No real complexity or development aside from a sparse hint of chocolate. Thin and lackluster, at best this is an average Oatmeal Stout. Far from great, nothing is offensive, but it is something Id not recommend.","bditty187","Feb 07, 2003"
3.09,-18.5,4,2.5,3,2.5,4,"Deep clear brown hue. Thin, tight head leaves Belgian lace. Aroma of burnt malt, mild baker's chocolate and dark caramel malt. Clean and underwhelming aromawise. Roasted barley bitterness upfront, mild hop bitterness immediately ensues, leaving an apparent void in malt character. Subtle, dryish chocolate mid palate. Lightly bodied, but quaffable. No trace of silky oatmeal is perceptible in the thin mouthfeel. Finishes clean and dry, w/ fleeting hints of chocolate. Uninspired. The filtration and / or over fining has stripped this brew of body. Good drinkability, but akin to a brown ale in roasted character.","marc77","Oct 13, 2002"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Dark brown almost black color, decent lasting tan head. Sweet chocolate malty roasted burnt aroma, chocolate roasty sugary burnt bitter coffee flavors, yet has a pretty smooth and creamy mouthfeel, medium body has a nice burnt bitterness in the finish.","maxpower","Oct 16, 2001"
4.55,20.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"A deep black color sits below a nice creamy tan head.  The aroma is lightly of dark malt.  Initially a mellow sour fruity flavor presents itself followed by a quick sweet malt and a lingering bitterness.  Great body and complex, I enjoyed this brew.","beernut7","Beers"
4.94,30.3,4,5,5,5,5,"The roasted oats dominate its taste and it has a wonderfully smooth, silky texture.  Just as Guiness has a worldwide following, many Lawrence, Kansas residents consider this beer to be a nectar of the gods.  This beer grows on you.  Free State Brewery is a hidden treasure in the Midwest.","mmthompson33","0"
