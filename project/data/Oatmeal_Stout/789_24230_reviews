"Good chocolate taste with a very creamy mouthfeel. Slight roasty taste, but not overpowering."
"Poured deep black with underdeveloped head. Rich, roasty, chocolatey palate, with mild hops finish. Very smooth and drinkable. This was a happy surprise from a brewery I had never heard of before."

"Poured into a Reuben's Brew snifter. Pours a very dark brown, appearing opaque black in the glass with a thin light brown film that dissipates to a thin ring around the glass. Mild aroma of chocolate and toasted malt. Flavor is toasted malt, nice chocolate, day old coffee, finishes with mild hop bitterness and a touch of char. Medium bodied with hints of creaminess. A quite nice low ABV stout. The oatmeal gives it a much more pleasant feel than most light stouts, and the flavors, although not intense, are nicely balanced and pleasant. I don't usually go to the stout style for a session beer, but if I did, this would be an excellent candidate. Mild, but nicely done."
""
"A solid stout!"
""
"This pours a dark brown color with a slight brown, carbonated head. The aroma is filled with cocoa and oats. The taste is a little thinner than I would have thought. It has a sweet oat flavor yet it is not super heavy in flavor. Decent body and very drinkable but I also think a little over-rated as well."
""

"Oscar's pours a black color with a small head. There is a creamy oatmeal and roasted aroma with hints of chocolates. The taste is creamy roasted, mellow chocolate notes, all on a nice mellow roasted malty backbone. The overall flavor is a bit weak and watery. Overall its a nice stout, but a bit weak."

"Overall: a decent beer but one of these is enough in a session. Worth giving it a try especially since the chocolate does come through here."
""
""
"Overall: It's good, it could be great if you could have it on nitro or if they bump up the body and mouthfeel a bit. But if you're looking for a solid chocolate stout with a touch of roasted aromas, Oscar's won't disappoint."
"This is a drinkable stout, however the bitterness leaves it mostly one-dimensional."
""

"Overall this is an average stout, would have liked it better if it had a little more body."
"I poured this nice beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer poured a really dark brew with a very nice tan head. The smell was like dark roasted (nearly burnt) grains. The beer did not taste burnt however. The beer tasted nice and toasty with big coffee or cappuccino taste to it. The beer had good lacing and had a bit of a dry finish. I don;t like that but I would buy this beer again."

"Pours dark black with some tan/off white foam. Nose is strong oat. Chocolate malt too. Present, but not potent. Taste is a smooth sweet chocolate malt, oat finish. Very subdued hop. Milky but not lactose-y. Very light and balanced. Good flavor, good stout."
" The flavor has a good malt presence with some caramel and moderately sweet cocoa tinges with light dried fruit taste and very low bitterness with some light roast flavor and very gentle yeast in the finish adding to the sweetness and grain of the oats. Overall I enjoyed this but it is pretty subdued and I would probably prefer a bolder oatmeal stout to be honest. It has a nice drinkability for the strength, though."
""
"O- This is not a bad beer. I enjoyed the roasty, smokiness of it, but I feel the chocolate was lacking. Typically I enjoy the roast flavors over the sweeter one, but I feel like when you advertise a beer as being a chocolate oatmeal stout there should be a strong chocolate presence. Either way this is an enjoyable stout, seems like a great introduction to the style."

"Pleasing enough but nothing special. Tasted like Guinness with a hint of chocolate. It was a little thin for me for a stout. I may have a few of these on St. Pat's Day as like I said, it is close enough to Guinness. The smell was nothing special. Faint chocolate with some roasted malts. Nice dark look in the glass."
""
"M. Far too watery and thin for my preferences. Medium carbonation."

"Overall, not much going for it. It lacks the richness that the aroma suggests which only makes the flavor more disappointing. Easy enough to drink but I can't imagine seeking it out again."
""
"I liked this one a lot. A simple low ABV stout with big flavor. I wonder why it isn't rayed higher on Beer Advocate. Worth a try for stout fans."
"Its Saturday night and time for dessert. Trying a Sand Creek Oscar Chocolate Stout. The stout poured dark opaque with off-white head that is not lacing. The smell includes roast, chocolate, and some espresso. The taste includes roast, chocolate, and espresso...much like the nose. The mouthfeel is ok, light body..perhaps too much carbonation. Overall it is a decent stout...not the best, but definitely good."
"I hope that bear can brew a good beer... It pours a dark garnet-tinged black-brown topped by a finger of relatively short-lived dirty tan foam. The nose comprises chocolate syrup, roasted malts, toasted oats, and a small bit o' molasses. The taste holds notes of cocoa powder, light coffee, very light molasses, and light roasted malts. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly smooth feel. Overall, a pretty nice oatmeal stout, one that doesn't try to do too much with the chocolate (which often ends in disappointment, frankly). Not bad at all."
"My first Oatmeal Stout and an enjoyable beer, but I feel like this is not a good first example of the style."
"O â€“ The nose on this suggested a stronger fuller flavor that really never appeared. Warming did not bring out any more taste notes. Strictly average here."
"Tastes are sour dank chocolate, raspberry vomit, wild yeast, hops, sweet sweet sweet oatmeal, mocha, caramel, some roast, ink and dried fruits. Smells like a stout that needs to be aged for a bit in some wood before it can be let out and sipped and enjoyed."
"This pours a dark nut brown color and settles damn near black with ruby edges. A few bubbles cling throughout drinking this. The nose is a bit subtle but offers some chocolate and coffee notes. Nothing too special here. The taste is a bit bold thankfully. Chocolate and coffee linger and are wrapped up in a roasty blanket. Mouthfeel is a lighter feel for a stout but it is very drinkable. Decent stout"
"Overall one of my favorite stouts."
"Poured a dark brown color with beige head on it. Smell is heavy coffee. Taste is a mix of chocolate and coffee. Not a lot of oatmeal coming through for me. Medium bodied beer. Pretty good overall (my wife absolutely loves it!). I'm sure it will have a regular spot in our fridge."
"O: Overall, a decent oatmeal stout that is fairly drinkable and could be a decent session beer with its low gravity. Nothing to write home about, though."
"Not a bad beer but i wouldn't seek this one out again unless i ever make it to Wisconsin to try it on draft. Second chances, every beer deserves one! Almost."
"D=I found this a bit difficult to finish, just because I kept on hoping more from each sip, only to discover that the same bland taste lasted throughout."
"D: This beer made very little sense and was not very pleasant to drink. I would pass on this one should I see it again."
"Basically and iced coffee, coffee, coffee."
"An above average oatmeal stout that is worth a try."
"Notes: A pretty good oatmeal stout. Not outstanding, but good. A good amount of chocolate and coffee as well. Worth a try, but I don't know if it would necessarily be worth seeking out."
"open the bottle nice caramel tones and little hop character. head retentionis very nice lasts very long and looks very dark much like a stout should look. the appearance is very dark with little light passing through it, very nice. the taste has caramel and chocolate overtones, little hops can be tasted. the beer is overal very good and is a great stout and i usually buy a 6 pack whenever i can"
"Nothing particularly astounding is going on with this beer, but it's certainly decent. It's pleasant enough to drink; it just seems tame to me. No regrets about trying it, but I likely won't pick it up again."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a deep dark chocolate color with a 2 finger milk chocolate head that didn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is a little weak. Some chocolate, burnt caramel, definitely some malt character and a little spice hop note. The taste was a little weak as well. Some chocolate, hops almost take over any sweetness there might have been. A little too much bitterness. Medium body, good carbonation, easy drinking stout, but much better in the class."
"D: I won't be having this again. Just not impressed at all. The flavor was a little off, nose wasn't all that, but the feel was just a crime... never had a stout so coarse and I hope I never do again..."
"Seems perhaps a touch light in the body. Certainly a great beer and I'd drink this every day. Maybe be happier with it in the summer months - when it's hotter and I want something lighter."
"Conclusion: Good looking beer that fails to come through in the flavor department."
"D - Not as good as I had hoped for for breakfast, but it'll do the trick. A good oatmeal stout that'll hold its own against any others. Being strong and assertive makes it a bit more of a chore to drink beyond one or two."
"J"
"Average mouthfeel and drinkability for a stout. Slightly chalky. Overall a nice stout with a great nose."
"D: Very good. A very sessionable, though not ideally flavored beer. I would recommend this to fans of the style who want to drink a lot without getting too drunk."
"D - This is a pretty decent stout. Not very overpowering with its taste, but flavorful enough to keep it pretty interesting. I could definitely have more than a couple of these without thinking twice about it."
"not too bad. sort of don't understand so many of the low scores here. maybe some batch inconsistencies?"
"Pleasant brew. Not too complex, but would happily have a couple."
"This was pleasant enough. It could stand to be a bit more flavorful though."
"A quick growing three finger head jumps to the top of my glass and fades slowly. Head is toasted biscuit brown in color. Body is jet black and only shows hints of light when held to flame. Nose is roasty with toasted malts that are really bready. Includes some coco and soft spice also. Enters the mouth with that same roasty feel, very malty up front on the palate. It is a bit thin mid palate but quickly fills in with some dry bitter feel towards the end of the palate. The oats keep this brew smooth throughout. Mouthfeel is dry, bitter and slightly thick, but it still stays soft. Drinkability is very good. I actually had an oatmeal raisin cookie towards the end of this beer and it was the perfect pairing."
"D - It is a fairly good drinkable stout. You can taste the chocolate but I'm torn with what seems moderate carbonation, but it is good!"
"Black in color but with faint hints of light threatening to break through if you hold it up to direct light. If you were to say ""brown"" it would be a very, very dark brown. Very little lacing and a bit of prickle. Very sweet malt nose and a little whiff of banana and quite a bit of coffee. Nice roasted malt flavor with pleasant coffee, smoke and a little oatmeal in the flavor. It drinks better than it looked upon the initial pour. The prickle and coloration of the stout made me nervous as it looked more like a dry irish stout than a chocolate oatmeal stout. The flavor removed my fears. Some sweet maltiness in the flavor that is carried by the body and the abundant flavor from the roasted malt."
"D - An easily sessionable beer - if you dont get a little bored."
"D: This beer would make a great session. It's refreshing and the complexity is delightful!"
"Thanks, joshuaseresse, for the chance to re-visit"
"Pours a very dark brown color, not quite black, with a nice two-finger tan head that fell slowly, and lacing ensued. I could smell the roasty, chocolate aroma as I poured it into a nonic. Very nice smell to it. Flavor is mostly chocolate, plenty of chocolate malts used in this one, and not some much roasted malt. Very creamy tasting, notes of vanilla, caramel and coffee are also present, but not too strong or overwhelming. It tastes very nice but it's not complex and is unfortunately a little light on body. It's silky smooth, but a bit watery on the finish. A very drinkable stout and quite sessionable. I will easily put back 2 or 3 of these tonight."
"Dark, dark brown in the pour. Borders on black when held to the light. Very faint roasted aroma. Slight metallic/coppery tinge to it. Mellow roasted flavor with a faint hop bite to it. Again it has a somewhat metal taste to it. Rather thin body wise. Lacks the silky smoothness of an oatmeal stout. A notch above average."
"Overall, this is a quite drinkable stout. It is certainly reasonable given the price and availability for my location. I will enjoy it when available."
"Overall: It's pretty drinkable being that its under 5%. The mouthfeel is alright and its only moderately carbonated, if it were a bit stronger in carbonation then it may have had a chance to show more flavor."
"Pretty tame, but very drinkable."
" ~ I first tried this beer a few years ago and was quite inexperienced in characterizing different attributes of beer. Since then I've learned enough to recognize the uniqueness of this Chocolate Oatmeal Stout and realize how enjoyable this beer really is. If you have not tried Oscar's, your doing yourself a disservice."
"Very tasty and flavorful light stout. black body, light head that stayed pretty fluffy. Sweet chocolate and a very light roasted malt scents. A very drinkable and flavorful stout. light body and low carbonation. stronger chocolate malts than roasted making it more of a porter style, but hey. its a good stout still"
"Medium body, pretty low carbonation. Feels watery in my mouth."
"Pleasant and tasty with some nice details and a decent feel. Goes down pretty easily. Not the first beer I'd grab, but one I could certainly sip on for an evening."
"There are better stouts out there, but this one isn't bad and is definitely worth a try."
"D- 4.5% makes this quite sessionable. I'd defintely drink this again."
"D- very weak and simple. im sure i could drink more of these (it wasnt offensive) , but im not sure id want to. only if i was desperate."
"Pours a dark brown nearing black with some slightly reddish highlights on the edges,the head is a darker than average,chocholaty brown and medium in size with very little lacing to be seen as it quickly fizzles out.The nose is subtle and made mostly up of coffee and roasted malts.This is a really light Stout considering the layers of flavor within.Lots of dry coca powder and lightly roasted coffees take center stage,backed up by a good nutty,semi sweet finish.Very light body,not really creamy,more soft and smoothe.I was in the mood for a good breakfest beer this morning and this one made a nice meal."
"Purchased at Breeze-Thru in Milwaukee. Gorgeous deep brown/black pour with brown head. Head dissipates quickly leaving ring around glass. Aroma of coffee, roasted oats, and chocolate. Great smooth mouthfeel. A bit too watery, however. Bitter smoked mocha taste; very full coffee flavors. A bit over carbonated for a stout, but still recommended."
"pours black with a big lasting light tan head. Smell is sweet, chocolately and roasty. Taste is smooth, lightly creamy, roasty chocolate with a tiny hint of light bitterness for balance. Medium to thin bodied and a mild powdered chocolately finish. A touch mild, but nice flavor still and a good sweet stout for sure."
"Pretty nice stout for sure. Not too strong or ""in your face"" but a great easy drinking darker brew for a summer night."
"This is a medium bodied beer. There is a creaminess to it that coats the mouth. However, for a stout this is a bit on the light and watery side. It is still heavier than your average beer."
"Very drinkable, this one has a great flavor."
"D: See above. Not a typical bitter stout, this is a decent ""beginners"" stout."
"D - Overall an okay stout, could be a bit stronger in the flavor department, but it's pretty easy drinking. Go for a Bell's instead."
"An ok stout, more approachable than challenging. Glad i tried it, but will likely not try it again."
"D - This is a good oatmeal stout. Not exceptional but certainly worth a try and a good value."
"D-Pretty easy to find in WI at taverns and restaurants. Not bad when faced with the usual BMC line up, but I would definitely reach for a samuel smith is I was in the mood for an oatmeal stout."
"This one is very heavy and that makes it tough for a session brew, but as a sipper I'm all for it. Very nice."
"Nice brew, goes well with simple chocolate (not overly bitter or flavored); not particularly special, but overall worthwhile."
"Poured dark with a finger high tan head, foamy. Diminishes fairly quickly. Smells good- a dark coffee/chocolate nose. Mouthfeel is a bit light for a stout. Tasty, with a light chocolatey-roasted malt finish. A very smooth stout, kind of on the light side. Very drinkable."
"d- could have many of these, a light dark beer, there is so much out there that has alot more taste than this!"
"I like iced coffee with cream and sweetener. This beer would make an interesting substitute. I could see pouring it over ice with some cream. It has plenty of flavor to stand up to the ice."
"overall, i really enjoyed this brew, very nice cocoay beer"
"Drinkability: Though not a terrible stout, it is a tad depressing."
"D - A good all around stout. Nothing really outstanding, but no complaints either."
"Flavor was also decent; more sweet coffee-ness with some roastiness. There was also a vegetable flavor that I found a bit off-putting. Mouthfeel was a bit flat, but not awful. Altogether, a not displeasing package but certainly far from excellent."
"10/31 I did return - damn good Oaty at a damn nice price of $7.50 a sixer."
"This beer pours jet black with a one finger mocha head. It smells great with strong chocolate and coffee aromas. The flavor is weird. It has a great initial chocolate flavor, but that fades very quickly to a thin taste and feeling. It is very creamy though. It almost makes me think that this beer might be past it's prime, but there is no best by or born on date to check."
"This was poured fairly warm. It had a nice big, foamy, textured head that quickly subsided to just a trace. Only a hint of lace. Opaque brown color. Light malty, roasty, chocolatey aroma. Not as much taste as I've noticed before, but this bottle here at home is a bit old. Nice mouth-filling body with a bit of softness. Pleasant dark malt, roasty finish. Nice beer."
"Pours to a dark brown with medium thick tan head that lingers well and leaves okay lacing. Nice malty aroma of chocolate and oatmeal, that seemed to wane just a little as the beer warmed, but was still pleasant. Flavor of this slightly thin-bodied beer was mostly chocolate, and mouthfeel was slightly chewy. Finsih was medium duration and pleasant, but this beer could have been even better had the body been a little fuller."
"Drinkability: My first sampling from Sand Creek. I picked this up from a store that had some not too fresh brews and was worried about the age of this single. Very good and drinkable brew. If this is not fresh, I would like to try one that is."
"As mentioned earlier, this is a very light-bodied stout with not a lot of carbonation. I'm not overly impressed with this one, though it is far from offensive and I could see it as being easily drinkable. In fact, I could definitely see myself recommending this one to someone who enjoys a Guinness to broaden their horizons, but that's about it."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle that appears to have a dating notch. I got this in a trade so not sure of the exact age so either a couple months old or over a year old but believe couple months. It was a deep black in color even when held to the light. Had about a 1/4"" of head that turned into a thin foam with a bunch of carb bubbling in the center of it. The aroma was burnt coffee, roasted malts and a little chocolate. The taste was also of burnt coffee and was watery with a bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel was watery as mentioned. Overall it wasn't very good but since not sure on date of sample willing to re-try later. (2.5, NA, ML, N)"
"A friend asked me to try this one. It's a pretty decent oatmeal stout but nothing that I'd make special trips to Wisconsin for."
"Beer poured black with a tan head that is barely hanging around. Nose is very pleasant, of chocolate malts. Taste is very heavy on the chocolate malts but the lack of hops leaves this a bit unbalanced. Mouthfeel is very smooth but a bit thinner than hoped. Overall drinkability is pretty good. Not a bad beer but could be better with a few tweaks to the recipe."
"I'm not crazy about oatmeal stouts (and that distracting sour character that seems to come with them) but this is a fairly tasty beer."
"Lighter black color with some red highlights. Medium controlled tan head. No lacing. A good medium chocolate flavor to this beer. Not sweet but not bitter either. More milky than I expected. It leaves sort of a lactose film in my mouth, like when drinking milk. Nutty roast deep down. Some acidic black malts up top. Not too oatmealy imo. Good fuller body. Not the smoothest oatmeal stout I've had but more flavorful than most. Very good for the price."
"Tasted: 10/03/06"
"The flavor is nice and thick. Chocolate, coffee, and the foamy astertaste is a nice change of pace."
"This brew pours an opaque black color. The head is two fingers in height, and tan in color. Lacing is thorough. The aroma is roasted malt, graham cracker, cream, and coffee. The taste is like the aroma, but a little less pronounced. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, with a lot of carbonation that detracts a bit from the flavor. Overall, this is a pretty good stout that I would drink again."
"This beer is a dark black with a tan head. There is no light coming through here. The smell is as the name implies, oatmeal and chocolate. Also some caramel hints. The taste is more oatmeal. There are some sweet chocolate hints as well. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. The beer is an easy drinker. I could go for this beer again. Overall, this beer tastes like what the name says. A good beer that is malty and filling. Thumbs up."
"The lack of any head dropped it down on the appearance scale for me. The coffee comes through strongest in the aroma; malt dominates the taste. A medium texture; note quite as slick as I like oatmeal stouts to be. Very drinkable, though; it's best attribute. The closest thing to a lawnmower/summer stout that I've had."
"Originally reviewed April 9, 2005. On tap at the Gitchee Gumee Brewfest 2005. Pour of deep black-brown with a tan head. Aroma is of coffee and so is the flavor. ItÂ’s consistent, but mostly one dimensional. The palate is smooth and drinkable, but could use some more complexity. Salt is the smack."
"Nice and chocolatey with strong coffee characteristics. Tastes like it has been flavored with Nescafe hazlenut creamer. A pleasant example of the style, but nothing fantastic."
"I have to admit...I like this one a lot. Very much a stlye I prefer and it's been brewed in a fashion that I like. The appearance is black. I hold it up to a light and I can't see through it at all. The head is so thin, let's call it non-existant. Wonderful roasted malt smell, very rich. Tastes just as I expect a stout to taste--there is a distinction around the malt and it isn't all burnt--it's malty, sweet, well-balanced, deep, and dark. It has the aroma of malt and sweetness and a little bit of alcohol. I probably shouldn't throw these back all night, but I definitely could."
"D- It is hard to do a beer that has so many flavors thrown in together that the chocolate and most of the oatmeal is lost but there is a lot of coffee and tart flavors that dominate. Interesting beer but I think the stout should come first and the other flavors should support."
"Bottle courtesy of QuinnÂ’s IGA in La Crosse. Dark brownish black color with a thin and dense dark beige head that lasts a little while. Thin sheets of lacing. Mild coffee and malt in the nose. Medium-bodied with burnt coffee, chocolate and malt flavors. The finish is bitter with coffee and hops, along with some sweetness on the back end. Above average all around."
"Overall I found this to be a tasty treat."
"Overall a very nice stout I will be looking for again soon."
"Aroma was roasted bakerÂ’s choclate and cocoa. Classic stout appearance-black body holding a firm mocha head. Luscious ebony color as it settles. Flavor is sweet, but the choclate is muted to me and more smooth, vanilla tinged fromt he oatmeal. The overall taste is still good if not fantastic. Full body and texture you expect from a stout. Solid beer."
"Disappointing beer."
"cheers..."
"Drinkability: Flavorful and easy to drink. I wish I had another!"
"Not a great stout, looks good, smells real good, tastes alright. The light body makes having a few possible, but they could get boring in a hurry."
"I really enjoy this beer. Nothing too complex, very drinkable. Definately recommended."
"gracias to dirtylou for smuggling this bottle out of el norte"
"Drinkability: Pretty darn good. This isnÂ’t an amaizing stout but itÂ’s good enough and for the price I could drink quite a bit of it."
"Pours out a very dark brown, nearly black color. Very little head. The aroma is a nice combination of chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, nuts, and fruit. The flavor has the same characteristics of the aroma, but is also both sweet and sour. Some oatmeal flavor too. I would enjoy a little more oatmeal flavor. Medium mouthfeel. Decent drinkability. Pretty good beer, but nothing to get too excited about."
"I really like this stout. Ok, it can't compare to the world's great stouts, but it is a very solid beer, and costs considerably less than most of those great stouts so I will be buying it more often. This is a beer that can be enjoyed in quanity without breaking the bank, while still drinking a really good beer."
"Oscar, you suck. Okay, you don't suck, but Gray's wins the state championship, and moves on to fight England's Samuel Smith's for the championship of the Western Morality Bloc."
"drinkability: pretty easy drinking"
"poured a deep brown, virtually black color with tanish head that feel to a slight ring. Smell is of coffee, chocolate, and toasted malt and is very pleasant. Taste is strong of coffee and toated malt and follows through with the smell. Aftertaste is a bit dissapointing and fails to follow through from the taste. A very good beer that seems to fail in the finish."
"Drinkability is ok. Nothing really special going on here."
"Pours pitch black with absolutely no head, even though I gave it a pretty rough pour. I thin, spotty tan coating is all to be seen. Smell is quite nice, roasty malts and fresh coffee. Taste continues with the sweet roasted malts, coffee, and maybe a hint of raspeberry chocolate. It describes itself as a ""Chocolate Oatmeal Stout", but coffee is the dominating feature here, which is fine by me, I like a good coffee stout. Mouthfeel, sadly, is almost flat, seems rather undercarbonated, but still thick and smooth. Overall, the yummy coffee aroma and taste mostly make up for the lackluster appearance and mouthfeel. Worth a try if you can find it. I've never seen it anywhere else."
"One-finger tan head settles to a thin layer slowly; low alcohol content. No lacing whatsoever. Impenetrable black body. Nose of chocolate and caramel, a bit of oatmeal too. Good, evenly gentle carbonation on the tongue, body is medium-thin, rather straighforward, chocolate and a slight oatmeal acridity (the good kind) mixing nicely, smooth going down. Refreshing in the way oatmeal is. An interesting spin on the style but not something I'd revisit that often."
"pours a 1 finger head that is very creamy and tan. black and quite nearly impervious to penetration by light. smells roasty and chocolate with faint smells of grain. taste both the roast and the chocolate. kind of like liquid baker's chocolate with mildly bitter hop finish. very pleasant. interesting, bold brew, yet not over-bearing. really like how after-taste hangs around rolling back and forth between the roasty and chocolatey. i need to try more of this stout sub-style."
