Medium bodied with a median carbonation level = smooth and almost creamy. Chocolate/fudge and strong golden caramel and toffee notes greet you in the nose. The flavor adds a bit more nuttiness and some yeasty fruitiness to the mix. Leafy and grassy hops add balance along with a solid bitterness. Richly flavorful and satisfying without being overly malty or full bodied. Drinkable, and (bonus!) fairly inexpensive.","NeroFiddled","Jan 28, 2015"

Has a nice roasty back notes but the chocolate takes the for front with this brew. Great creamy body from the oats. I would of liked to of seen maybe a little bit more of hop bit. This reminds me more of a milk stout or chocolate stout from all that chocolate flavor that takes the over the remainder of the aroma in flavor. But no complaints it a really great beer and for the price at 5.99 for a 6 pack you can't go wrong. I'll definitely buy this again, I recommend you give it a try.","beerman21","Aug 20, 2014"

I will say that, you can definitely tell that there's an Irish dry stout influence on this beer. It's kinda like the cross between and IDS and an Oatmeal stout.

This beer smells good; raisins, dark chocolate, oatmeal. There is no alcohol in the nose. This beer tastes very good; it is roasty, not too over the top, and leaves a pleasant finish. The major challenge to this beer is its mouthfeel. The carbonation is too much and too tight and it is very thin. This gives the beer a Coca-Cola-like quality that detracts from its impressive flavor. I probably would not buy this again.","mentaltraveller","Sep 18, 2011"

The nose comprises roasted malts, cocoa powder, and a very tiny thrust of maple syrup. The taste follows pretty closely, though the syrup is definitely nowhere to be seen and the cocoa is slightly dryer.

GB, however, is not typically known for their ales, preferring to stick with bocks and other malty lager styles.

Not in a bad way. Starts off rather fruity followed with a smoke presence and finally a coffer bitterness on the palate after the swallow. A little too carbonated for my liking. A little smoothness would help. Drinkability is good though more than one is not in my future. For the price, this is worth picking up and giving it a shot. Well worth the effort.","kaseydad","May 30, 2010"

4.12,6.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,3,"TJ's exclusive made by Goose Island and very well priced (almost too cheap for what it offers). Compared side by side with some other examples of the style I wouldn't necessarily pick this one as my favorite but it's definitely in the top three. Appearance is a deep dark brown to black that is virtually opaque until held up to a strong light where one can see tinges of deep tobacco and slight crimson coloration along the edges. Pours nicely as it forms a supple lightish mocha head that sticks around for the duration of the experience. Minimal lacing. Aroma holds notes of sweet roasted malt, molasses, coffee, and evaporated milk. Taste is reminiscent of the nose in every respect: rich and sweet with a lingering bitterness on the finish that dissipates after about ten seconds, leaving a craving for more. Mouthfeel is nice with a carbonation level that is not too forced or abrasive but just right. Drinkability is not necessarily high for me, but the possibility to take in a couple of these in a sitting is very much a reality best enjoyed by those with an appreciation for the finer things in life. All in all, this beer is a fine example of a quality offering without the sticker shock. Well done, GI/Stockyard/TJ's.","PantsOptional","Apr 17, 2010"

Pours a dark brown that verges on blackness, with a big brown head that is foamy, fluffy, and long-standing. Aromas are roasty and sour, very much like an oatmeal and coffee breakfast. The flavors reflect all the aromas with the added goodness of chocolate notes. Finish is more sweet than bitter but the roasty bitterness and minerally elements definitely support the malts. A very enjoyable beer and a great value.","droomyster","Feb 11, 2010"

Specific tasting notes include coffee, bittersweet chocolate, a hint of smoke, earthy pepper, and iron. The carbonation level is high, but the bitterness lasts into the finish anyways.

Larger bubbles rose from the bottom to the brim of this drink. The aroma is of deep chocolate and sweet toffee. A lighter roast smell, not burnt like many others in the style.

Lots of sweet chocolate dominates the aroma. Some roasty aromas, and as a consequence, some hints of coffee arise. A bit sugary smelling. Taste is closely reflected by the aroma. Sweet layers of chocolate at first give way to roasted malt, oats and espresso. A bit of roasted bitterness drys it out through the finish. A little high on carbonation, but still smooth.

4.42,14.5,4.5,5,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours a deep brown-black hue, with little head, but delicate tan lacing. The aroma is intoxicating by itself. Rich roasted malt, with strong notes of brown sugar. Mouthfeel is a little more watery than I was hoping for. That's made up for by a full flavor, where the malt shines and the oatmeal comes through. Not too heavy, but truly rich. A great after-dinner beer.","Eris48","Oct 06, 2005"

3.67,-4.9,4.5,2.5,4,4,4,"I love how this beer looks, opaque brown with an ample beige froth. Head dissapates quickly, though lacing is pretty impressive. It doesn't really have a smell, just a faint hint of chocolate, but the taste is very smooth, a great roasted taste. An interesting mix of bitterness and sweetness. Very easy to drink if you like the style, I highly reccomend if you're looking for a cheap stout. (from Trade Joe's)Could drink a few of them when I'm in the mood.","lokicat444","Jul 21, 2005"
4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, yet malty scent that boasts of oats, chocolate, crystal, and roasted malts. It's earthy with a slightly sweet aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a very smooth, malty flavor. It goes down with a roasted and chocolate malt taste and finishes with a dry oatmeal flavor. It's earthy with a chocolate edge. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a good OS. It has a flavorful malt bill; highly drinkable.","WesWes","Jun 29, 2005"

3.89,0.8,4,5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A good beer except, perhaps, for a little over the top coffee-ness. Pours a proper black body under a thin tan head. Extremely bitter coffee smell and taste. But somewhere in there, I was getting an iompression of toasted marshmallows and capuccino Jelly Bellys. I got this bottle at the brewery, but Its otherwise sold in the Trader Joes chain.","DrunkMcDermott","May 26, 2005"
3.97,2.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours black with a tan head. Wow. Smells a lot like coffee with some chocolate notes. Tastes like it smells - which isn't a bad thing! Nice bitter espresso aftertaste and not too sweet either, which is a nice change from the bigger stouts. Could be called a porter...the mouthfeel is nice and smooth. Overall this is a very drinkable stout, not too be looked down upon in any way!","Star80","May 09, 2005"
3.73,-3.4,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability- Not bad at all for an oatmeal stout. The smoky texture and high bitterness caught me off gaurd a bit, but overal a pretty decent brew.","GClarkage","Mar 20, 2005"
3.94,2.1,5,3.5,4,4,4,"Tasting: The predominant flavor on the tongue is coffee. There are hints of roasted malts and chocolate as well. This is a rather sweet beverage. It comes across very smoothly on the tongue as well. If one is a fan of coffee, then this beer will be great for a ""session."" I see this beer as having potential crossover potential for people looking to explore the world of stouts. I definitely recommend it!","bceaglejoe","Mar 12, 2005"
4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours out to a jet black in the glass with a moderate sized head. Aroma is that of roasted malt and grain. The taste is that of coffee infused with a slight dose of bittersweet chocolate. A slight bit on the thin side, but in no way does it detract. Finishes quite easily with a nice does of coffee and chocolate on the way down. For $4.99 a six pack at Trader Joe's, this is a steal. Goose Island, er, uh, Stockyard Brewery, ya done good. While its not a Rogue Shakespeare it is still a very solid oatmeal stout.","proc","Jan 29, 2005"
4.13,7,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Pours black with a tan head and is leaving a gentle lacing down my glass. Nose is of malts and a mild trace of coffee. The taste was very well put together! When it first hit my tounge it hit with a creamy but roasted chocolate coffee sensation that lingered until the dry hop finale blasted me. This is wonderfully creamy but it is a tad bit thin for the style. Overall drinkability is very good as I would definitely by this again for the price I paid!","arizcards","Jan 22, 2005"
3.72,-3.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a deep dark brown, but not quite black, with a tiny, quickly disappating light brown head. Aromas of coffee, chocolate and roasted malts combine nicely to create a nice, inviting nose. Palate is a continuation fo the nose, with mocha and carbonation adding a nice dry component. Slight cola flavors also noticable. Mouthfeel is light, on the dry side, but with a lingering finish. Oatmeal adds a nice roundness and softness throughout. A very drinkable stout, IMO. Good flavor profile and mild finish. Worth trying anytime.","winomark","Jan 17, 2005"
3.68,-4.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"It poured a dark, dark brown with hardly any foam what so ever. The smell of roasted malts filled the nose. The taste was of roasted malts and chocolate. There was also a slight hint of a spicy nature, but just a slight hint. The overall taste of this stout was just a bit over average. There was just something missing that I couldn't put my finger on. Kind of a lack luster finnish, maybe!","BeerManDan","Jan 03, 2005"
4.13,7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pour dark brown with a healthy tan head. The aroma is filled with roasted malt and oats. It simply tastes as an oatmeal stout should. The sturdy burnt oats floats smoothly into a bitter finish. All in all a great beer. The fact that it goes for $4.99 at Trader Joes' is pure icing.","swamiswamu","Dec 08, 2004"

3.58,-7.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a pitch black color with a large tan head that leaves a nice lace. Aromas are extremely roasty, with a nice coffee backing and only a hint of oats. The flavor to this brew goes right along with the aromas. Initially there is an astrigent roastiness that just dominates the flavor profile. Following there is a just a light oat like flavor that adds just a hint of sweetness but a fairly strong coffee flavor quickly overwhelms it. The finish to the brews is slightly bitter with just a final roasty flavor and a bit of chocolate. The mouthfeel to this brew is fairly medium bodied, with a light carbonation that tickles the tongue. A fairly drinkable brew but just a bit too roasty for me and a little on the one dimensional side.","bigbeerdrinka","Nov 12, 2004"
4.13,7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This beer was a pleasant surprise. Pours a very dark brown (almost black) that is not quite opaque. Medium thick beige head and thin lacing. Nice coffee and chocolate aroma. The body is not very thick but is very smooth and drinkable. Roasted coffee, sweet chocolate and malt flavors. The finish is lightly bitter with a lingering coffee aftertaste. Easily the best Trader Joes beer I have tried and a pretty good Stout to boot.","Dogbrick","Oct 18, 2004"

There had to be something wrong with the taste or something. Nope. This was great! Three dominant flavors of oats, coffee, and roasted malts. Not too complex, a bit thin for a stout, and somewhat bitter. But it was still a great beer. I had a few by themselves then a few with some brats and they actually paired well to me. This rivals Arcadia Imperial Stout and Hennepin for the best taste to price ratio.","granger10","Jul 12, 2003"

3.23,-16.3,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"Stockyard: An oatmeal stout from Trader Joes (Hey, Jackndan went to Trader Joe’s). Pure black, with garnet highlights when held to a bright light. A tannish head that disappeared pretty damn quickly. Had a typical oatmeal stout aroma, i.e. lightly browned coffee and caramel. The taste is fairly faithful to the style, sweet malts opening up to dark chocolate. However, the smoothness of an oatmeal stout is missing, and has more carbonation than I would have liked. However, fairly inexpensive, easy enough to drink. If you are in Trader Joe’s I go for this one.","jackndan","Jan 30, 2003"

Wonderful aroma of roasted coffee and creamy chocolate.  Rich taste of roasted malt - the oats are really apparent, yet not overpowering.  Also notes of coffee and chocolate.  Good creamy mouthfeel, but not quite as thick as I'd like.  Very pleasant brew to drink.  Wonderful with Sunday breakfast.","Viking","Oct 05, 2002"

Taste was creamy rich, nicely balanced oatmeal taste, slightly more subtle than the Young's or Samuel Smith versions. Crisp bitter bite to the finish. Overall an very nice sweet oatmeal stout flavors. Full bodied, but not as ""chewy"" as the Young's version. This is still a very good version. I think I am really starting to enjoy Oatmeal Stouts, I'll go searching for more.......","StevieW","Sep 14, 2002"
