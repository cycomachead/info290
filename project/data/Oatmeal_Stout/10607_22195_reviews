"I am not able to get past the fact that this beer is way over hopped for the style. As I stated above, I can see there is a a good beer in here, brewed with quality ingredients, but the hops are hiding most of what I am looking for."

"Very good stout, nice tweak on the hop addition."

"On nitro-tap at Prime 16. Pours a pitch black color with over an inch of frothy, tan head. Some lacing. Aroma is a sweet chocolate and coffee mix with some smokey roasted malts. The taste has more of the sweet oatmeal than in the aroma. Light and sweet coffee as well as chocolate. A bit of smoke towards the finish. Silky, creamy mouthfeel thanks to the nitro. Damn drinkable. This beer really shines on the nitro tap. Overall, worth seeking out."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the nice coloring, and thick smoke to the malts. Negatively, however, the nose was a little light, and the flavoring, other than that wild smoke, was too. We were hoping for a better balance, and more solid flavors to mix with such a strong component as the smoke."

"A delicious tasting beer overall; some semi-sweet chocolate mixes with coffee and roasty malt; good oatmeal presence; moderately sweet with the faintest kiss of hops mostly noticed in the somewhat bitter finish. Very well rounded flavor and mouthfeel, which is silky smooth, medium-bodied, and medium-to-low on the carbonation side. Again, there is almost a nitro feel to this beer even from a regular tap. One of my favorite Sixpoint offerings to be sure, very impressive."
"O: Not bad, but another beer from Sixpoint that I would probably pass on the next time around."

"O- it's Sixpoint, so it's quite good, but I'll still take Diesel."
""
""
""
"O: Good but not great, a little too thin of a stout for my preferences. Very easy to drink and quite sessionable but needs a fuller body."

"On tap at Rattle N Hum, poured into an imperial pint glass. Deep dark almost black hue with purple on the edges capped by a creamy off white head with excellent retention. Nose is light with hint of roastiness. Taste is full of roast malt, light flower balances nicely. Mouth is light and creamy. Yeah!"

"o - Overall a very good oatmeal stout. I know they are supposed to be different, but I think this is a ton better than their Diesel stout; I hope they can this one as well. Reminds me of a good sweet stout, as it has a lot of sweet chocolate and vanilla to it. Would like to have it again."

"This beer pours a very dark brown color, almost black. It has a nice finger of creamy tan head on it. The head has good retention, and it leaves behind some scattered lace on the glass. The nose is of dark roasted malt, chocolate, toffee, light hops, and cream. It smells really nice. The taste follows the nose pretty well. There is a nice roasted malt flavor and bitterness. There are some flavors of coffee, dark chocolate, toffee, and mild hop flavors. The finish leaves some lingering roasted malt and hop bitterness on the palate. This has a medium body, that is leaning toward full, and good carbonation. It goes down smooth, and it has a really creamy feel to it. There is some sweetness and a nice roasted malt bitterness that balances it out. The roasted bitterness lingerings on the tongue for a bit. This has good drinkability. It has really nice flavor and great feel to it. It is quite creamy. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer, and I would buy it again. I recommend trying it out if you come across it. Cheers."

"Definitely a winner from Sixpoint, and is highly recommended."

"i see that its brewed in beautiful downtown brooklyn by 6 points brewing co - i'm gonna have to take me a trip over there real soon"
"O - This Oatmeal Stout took nicely to the nitro...all the classic flavors were present and represented nicely...a solid Oatmeal Stout"
"A nice hoppy stout. The hops dominate over the malt in this one."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a good flavorful stout to drink for a while."
"O- Nothing mind blowing but I got to say, despite its mellowness, I'm actually really digging this."
"i hope maybe i can try this one on a regular co2 pour one day because that might change my mind! :-)"
"Overall it is interesting but needs more of a malt backbone I think. Not sure about how I feel about the hop angle in this, I am not sure I feel it fits or melds well. Don't see myself gravitating towards it or really desiring it."
"Taken from memory and notes. Enjoyed on 8/1/11"
"O: a solid stout with a unique twist. I'll say it again: *all* stouts should be served on nitro. Props to Spitzer's for having 3 nitro taps!"
"Overall a very easy to drink beer, just not so interesting."
"D: The beer is rather easy to drink and is quite sessionable for the style because it isn't very heavy."
"Medium bodied with a nice balance of roasted, dry and sweet flavors. Lots of roasted malt up front with hints of coffee bean, chocolate and a prominent oatmeal character. There's a slight lactic cream presence mid-palate that provides nice balance and there is some more bittersweet dark chocolate toward the dry, roasted finish."
"(Probably didn't help that Rattle N' Hum had it listed as a Sweet Stout. It was the polar opposite of anything sweet.)"
"D - I was satisfied with this, but it is not my first choice in oatmeal stouts. I found the bitterness to be slightly high in hops and malt putting it slightly out of balance. The nitro treatment doesn't help IMO but I would order it again if on C02 to compare"
"There's nothing to complain about here. This is just a solid Oatmeal Stout with plenty of flavor and a super silky feel that helped along a good bit by the nitro. I could have easily downed a couple of these. Very sessionable overall."
"D: Another solid dark offering from Sixpoint. It won't blow you away, but it's damn solid."
"On cask at Rattle 'N' Hum. Average mouthfeel, black with some decent head.Decent choice for cask . Balanced stout, a bit on sweet side but flavourful. Malting makes it a drinkable stout. Nitro would make it more creamy and maybe pump up the rating some."
"On-tap at the Spinnerstown Hotel. Served in a tulip glass, this beer appeared pitch black with a very short head. I really thought this was a great, albeit aggressive, take on the style. The flavor and aroma are full of big chocolate flavors up front with roasted barley around the edge. The malts are followed by a powerful citrus hops kick that provides a great bitter contrast to the cocoa notes. This is easily one of the best oatmeal stouts I've ever had."
"D: Yes, good. Lower alcohol, I think. Very tasty."
"D - Really nice. Enjoyable and solid. Not my favorite example of the style, but pretty good."
"Overall this was a smooth oatmeal stout however I would have preferred to try it on a normal tap rather than the nitrous. That being said, either way it's served it's worth a shot."
"Reviewed on 11/21/2009. Growler from Big Z beverage. Pours a dark brown with a plentiful dark tan head. Aroma of roasted malt and oatmeal. Flavor of roasted malt with a smooth and milky palate. A pretty good oatmeal stout and definitely very drinkable."
"D: extremely smooth and drinkable. I'd have another if I wasn't meeting my boss later."
"D- The flavor is good- bitter, woody....but the mouthfeel is great- full smooth and creamy. Yet another very enjoyable offering from Sixpoint."
"D: Great flavors, but smokiness and the slickness don't mesh well. I look forward to trying this on tap."
"Pours a dark silky brown with a light, crisp head. Aroma is strong in oatmeal, quite chocolatey and with some espresso beans (not like roasted beans, but like chocolate-covered beans). Mouth is very smooth and creamy. Very lite carbonation. Taste is a strong oatmeal presence with slightly bitter aftertaste. A good amount of pale malt is present. Smooth and creamy but the flavor is a bit off, or at least just not for me. I wouldn't get it again, but I'm sure others would like it."
"Deep dark brown, thick tan head with decent retention and fair lacing. Found both the aroma and flavor on this one to be a little more skewed to sweet chocolate and coffee than the Diesel Stout by Sixpoint, but still had an overwhelming amount of toastiness and dry grass finish. The body also was very very thin for a stout, but a tiny bit thicker than the Diesel."
"D - Pretty solid oatmeal stout with quite a bit of hop character, especially for the style."
"D- Drinkable because it doesnt overpower, well crafted beer. Could have been a little more complex and sweeter."
"D_A decent but not great Oatmeal stout."
"HV"
"Drinkability: easy to quaff this stout and a few of these can be had in a single session. Nice balanced flavors makes this an enjoyable version."
"It wasn't a bad Oatmeal Stout, but ""Otis"" didn't really do anything for me. It would have been better for me if it was more roasted than dry or have the dryness level match up with the roasted level. I would more than likely pass this Sixpoint up if I ever saw it again. If you've never had, it's worth a shot at least once."
"Poured rich chocolate, left light lacing. Nose of chocolate, coffee, caramel, and malts. Tasted oats, chocolate, coffee, caramel...all the best ingredients for a rich, tasty stout. This could be one of my top 10 stouts, very rich and tasty. Highly recommend!"
"Notes from and tasted on: 04/06/09."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, gritty, chewy, nicely balanced between sweet maltiness, and bitter hops."
"A good oatmeal stout with an unexpected dose of hops."
"Pours a dark brown almost black, with a small white creamy head that fades fast. Aroma was of roasted coffee/smoke with a chocolate finish. Taste was nutty, roasted coffee, smokey and some malts. Mouthfeel with creamy and smooth. A very well balanced beer, another winner from Sixpoint, i can't get enough of their stuff"
"This beer pours a black, opaque color with a finger of thick off-white head - very good head retention. Lacing is thick and sticky and present for entire sitting. The nose quite muted however there is scents of fruity hops and caramel roated malts, some slight undertones of chocolate. The taste was made up for the lack of aroma. Coffee, chocolate and a bit of a nutty flavor are the most present. Roasted malts and slight hops are also present. The beer is full bodied and creamy but not overwhelmingly filling, very smooth going down. Tonight was my first experience with Sixpoint and both samples are impressive!"
"If only Sixpoint would make its outside of NYC then stout drinkers around the world would have a new session beer. The nutty chocolate, full roast flavour is dressed in a mouthfeel as silky and satiny as its complexion. A word like 'balance' really takes its meaning from wonderful craftsmanship offerings like the Otis Oatmeal Stout."
":)"
"D--What's the ABV, like six percent? Hell yeah I'll have another! The smoothness of the mouthfeel and the dry back end of this brew make it easily sessionable, especially in December about-to-snow temperatures."
"Overall, this was not an overly complex take on the style. However, it was a solid take IMO. I would recommend it, but not above a few other brews in the category."
"Pours a murky brown. Tan head. Oddest color I've seen in a long time for a beer. Nose is sweet malts. Flavor is kind of funky. Earthy and slightly metallic edge. Malty flavors and a pretty thick aftertaste. Feel is decent. Thick on the liquid and a good enough level of carbonation. I am going to drop the drinkability though on this one. Sure it's pretty good, but the funk edge on this one is almost too far out. Not my favorite from Sixpoint."
"Looked good  near black with about an inch of tan head courtesy of the nitro tap at the Blind Tiger, which left nice rings retained well by the pint glass. Smelled good like a good stout should  roasted chocolate malts swirled with toffee; the oats were present if didnt come through as much as I like. But on the tongue, the diacytl that produced that pleasant toffee aroma was overwhelming. I wished Id ordered a second Chelsea Dry Irish Stout. I didnt taste a whole lot here because of the overwhelming buttery flavors, but theres some molasses and roast coffee going on. It was smooth and creamy, despite. Id try it again just to make sure that I didnt just get a bad batch, but I was disappointed with this one."
"Notes: the bartender at BTAH didn't know whether this was a porter or a stout (though she did pour it like you would pour a nitro-tap Guinness, so at some level she must've thought it was a stout or had been trained to pour it thusly). I didn't think it was strong enough to be a porter, so I was guessing at the time that it was an Irish Dry Stout. Knowing now that it was an Oatmeal Stout makes sense, but I usually find that Oatmeal Stouts are a little more creamy. Still, this was not bad at all, and I'd like to try it again knowing now what it is I'd be drinking. . . ."
"Overall a very good oatmeal stout. Extremely smooth and drinkable."
"Poured an opaque black color with a large cascading head. Great retention and lacing. Nose was heavy on coffee and roasted barley. Taste hits you with a sweet sugared coffee and toasty barley flavor. Also to be found is light caramel, powdered chocolate, and mild hops. Nice mouthfeel and very drinkable. Tasty!"
"Pours a dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice creamy tan head which lasts a little while then leaves some nice islands and some sticky lacing. the nose is slightly malty with some caramel undertones. The taste is malty and bitter with a slightly dry finish. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad oatmeal stout, glad to have had a chance to try it out."
"The taste was mostly dominated by hop character, with the oatmeal roasty/sugary flavor playing second fiddle. To be honest, the hops dominated the flavor a bit too much for my liking. Notes of coffee and chocolate are present, but barely. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, and the beer is quite drinkable. Overall the beer is a quality brew from a quality brewhouse, but it doesn't keep within the style very well. I would have liked to see more oatmeal charcater in the flavor. Still, it's worth a try."
"On tap at the Blind Tiger 3/19/05. Dark chocolate brown that you cannot see through at all, with a touch of a dusting and ring of thick, heavy khaki head. Not much coming from the aroma -not very strong, just a bit of coffee, some semi-sweet chocolate, and a tiny bit of hops. Smooth and silky, it flows nice and you really do not feel the carbonation-which I enjoy. A lot of dark coffee and sweet chocolate in the flavor, and a lot of flavor left to linger on the palate. Very nice and very drinkable."
"I enjoyed a pint of this tasty brew at the Blind Tiger Ale House. Pours black without any light shining through. Dark tan head, puffy with good retention. Leaves well developed lacing. This one sports a roasty malt nose. Notes of coffee and toasted grains. Mouthfeel is a bit hollow in the center, not quite the velvet the brewers were going for. Still a nice take on the style, subtle and balanced, worth a try to support this new Brooklyn NY, brewery."
