3.08,-21.6,4,3.5,2.75,3,3,"Bottle.  Started at 54 degrees.  Dark, dark brown to black, nice medium tan/camel foamy head with some staying power; smell is malt, slight oats.  Something dark and well-roasted, as it warms.  Taste is straight forward at first, nothing distinguished, no chocolate, sweetness or even heavy oats, but then gives way to a rising bitterness that just lays there persisting on the tongue.  Maybe the beer is turning bad, but it smells ok.  Maybe it's just not my cup of tea.  I think it is just a burnt/bitter, slightly acidic taste. Mouthfeel is light to medium but finished thin on the tongue, giving way to that bitterness that lingers (oh yeah, I already covered that part).  I could say something predictably silly, like, ""it's a crime to recommend Convict Hill"" but that would be pushing the rules and there are many raters who seem to like it well enough.","marieli","Mar 14, 2015"

Tiny dots of lace form slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, toasted oat, and cocoa aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, char, and oat flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice cocoa and char combination going on in the flavor.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 06, 2014"

Pours pitch black color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense dark khaki head with good retention that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Some nice spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, oatmeal, caramel, molasses, light coffee, dark fruits, roasted malt, and roasted earthiness. Very nice and balanced dark/roasted malt aromas; with good strength. Taste of big chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, molasses, coffee, oatmeal, slight dark fruit, and roasted earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, coffee, molasses, and roasted malt on the finish for a bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of roasted/dark malt flavor; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and chewy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden at 9.2%, with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial oatmeal stout! Great robustness and balance of flavors; and very smooth to sip on. Really enjoyed this one.","superspak","Apr 23, 2013"

Oily black in color, but an aggressive pour yielded a few carbonation bubbles with almost no head and some spotty lacing. Very subdued nose with some subtle roastiness with hints of oats and coffee. For what this lacked in appearance and smell, it more than makes up for in the taste. Very rich and flavorful with great roasty notes. Lots of fresh roasted coffee along with hints of oatmeal, caramel, dark chocolate, and molasses. The mouthfeel is rich and thick and extremely smooth with a nice subtle bitter finish. The alcohol is extremely well hidden making this scary drinkable, but it's rich enough to be a sipper. Overall an outstanding interpretation of the style!","beerdrifter","Jan 12, 2013"

I initially started pouring this down the side to keep the head in check, then poured straight down the center for the last 3rd of the pour to get the desired crown. However, this beer generated but a few columns of fizz. Otherwise, it's perfectly opaque like just about every other stout on earth. The smell is the best part of this beer by far. Chocolate, a bit of tofffee and/or caramel, and a roasted grainy scent that is just terrific. The taste isn't quite up to par with the bouquet, however. It's quite bitter with a heavy dose of black coffee dominating the flavor profile. Charred oak with a bit smokiness as well. The mouthfeel is the low point. It's very very thin, and heavily carbonated. It doesn't have the dense creaminess I prefer in my stouts. Letting it rest on your tongue is like having an 9-volt battery in contact with its tip. Not a pleasant feel at all. Overall, not a stout I plan on revisiting. I'll give the remaining bottles away as extras so others can tick this and form their own opinions.","Retail1LO","Oct 04, 2011"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, caramel, cream, and very subtle oat. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, cream, oatmeal, and alcohol on the followthrough. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. A little much for outside in our current weather but still quite tasty.

Roast is in full supply, and pretty much dominates everything else, although it's not astringent nor bitter. There is a slight bitterness on the back end, but I would contribute it to the hops rather than roasted barley. Chocolate plays second fiddle to the roast, as it's very light, and there's also a touch of dark fruit/raisin peeking through, but only momentarily. Nice, full body, low carbonation, slick and smooth, with a bite of bitterness on the very dry finish.

3.35,-14.8,4,4,3.5,2.5,2.5,"Pours pitch black, too much head- filled the pint with less than and inch of liquid. Smells like berries, coffee, cherries, slight earthy must. Tastes like cherries, coffee, dark breads and more fruit. The carbonation is a bit excessive, it has been 5 mins and the bubbles are still going strong. Some cola and toffee flavors, I also get some bell pepper in the after taste. Mouthfeel tries to be smooth and creamy, but this carbonation is waaaay too much for this. I don't want to say infected, but there is something up with this bottle. Still good, but not in the capacity that it could be.","youradhere","Nov 28, 2010"
3.94,0.3,3,4,4,4,4,"8.50%! I was thinking more like 5%, especially after I killed the bottle in about 6 minutes. Despite my obvious gluttony, this Texan Oatmeal Stout packs a ton of flavor in each sip. I could see it working just as well when gently quaffed from a snifter as it did getting slammed from a nonic.","deapokid","Nov 27, 2010"

3.78,-3.8,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Drink ability was good. Nice beer for a cold night. At 9 percent alcohol, it goes down smoother than most imperial stouts. Just wish there was more sweetness to the flavor and a little less bitterness. Gonna age one for a year and see if that helps","angelmonster","Nov 14, 2010"

3.11,-20.9,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,3,"Overall, a bit above the average oatmeal stout. It is a bit too roasted for my liking. Somewhat drinkable. No alcohol showing in it which surprised me for how high the abv is.","mothman","Oct 30, 2010"
3.56,-9.4,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Bottle. Pours a dark brown almost black color with a slight tannish head with crimson highlights. The head settles to a nice color. The aroma isn't really overly strong in any way but rather a subtle roasted malt and coffee note. Leather, dark chocolate, and roasted coffee are the dominate flavors in this one. I think the oats in this provide for a nice medium velvety mouthfeel that is rather well done. Even at the abv %, the taste really doesn't have that over alcohol note that some bigger beers can have. Not overly roasted either because I really don't get that overly bitter aftertaste.","kbutler1","Oct 25, 2010"
3.75,-4.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"d - A pretty drinkable oatmeal stout that is heavy on bitter chocolate in the taste. I enjoyed the smell but wish it had been more carbonated. Would be willing to try again.","mdfb79","Oct 19, 2010"
4.55,15.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Pours a very nice rich black brown color with a huge mocha colored head that leaves nice lacing and has great retention. The aroma is very nutty, some vanilla and tons of milk chocolate. Big roasted malts, just a hint of dark chocolate, but all milk chocolate on the palate. Big flavors of raisins and winter stone fruits masked by rich marshmallow like sweetness that blends all of the flavors together. Mouthfeel is spot on for the style. Really couldn't believe this was 8.5 percent abv after it's big silky texture and no alcohol burn. Really a nice made stout and perfect example of the style.","Augustiner719","Oct 17, 2010"
4.01,2,3,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,"12oz bottle into my Westmalle goblet. Awesome name and bottle, looking cool...Dark brown pour with light carbonation, disappointing for an oatmeal, love to see this on tap...An alluring sweet aroma, surprised at the sweet chocolate, vanilla, and oats coming through without alcohol on this 8.5% beer. Vanilla really shows more than anything, really nice...The taste bores me, most of the sweetness is gone leaving a plain stout with a little roastiness creeping in. Not bad, just boring, however at the abv super easy to drink.","jrallen34","Sep 28, 2010"

4.02,2.3,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Thanks to wagenvolks for the trade. 12oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass pours a deep opaque motor oil black with a thin quickly diminishing tan head. Aroma is a nice amount of roasted malts with some bitter cocoa. The taste is a nice amount of smooth roasted malts with a nice blend of bitter cocoa and subtle espresso. The beer is medium bodied and quite smooth with well hidden alcohol. This is a very enjoyable strong stout, one I would likely keep on hand all Winter if it were available here.","atsprings","Aug 16, 2010"
4.05,3.1,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Nothing illustrates the oblivion of convict life quite like a deep stout. This one pours a straight obsidian topped by about a half-finger of somewhat resilient light tan foam. The nose comprises coffee, roasted malts, dark chocolate, and a touch of burnt oats. The taste is quite similar, with some blackened biscuits, charcoal, cocoa, and a hint of vanilla (in the background) thrown in there as well. The body is a solid medium, with a light carbonation and a heftily smooth feel, bordering on chewiness. Overall, a very nice, black stout, another brew I wish they carried around here so I could have it whenever the urge hits me.","TMoney2591","Aug 12, 2010"
3.63,-7.6,4.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Notes - I would call this more of an export stout than an Imperial stout. Which is good, because we need more of them. I have a couple of issues: an oatmeal stout should have a thicker mouthfeel. Also, I'm not a fan of the bitter alcohol-syrup aftertaste. Otherwise, though, it's well balanced between bitter and sweet. Not the best stout ever, but it's a decent stab at it, to be sure.","Fnord","Aug 12, 2010"
4.05,3.1,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours pitch black with a thin layer of brown head. Pretty big aroma here; oats, black strap molasses, and dark chocolate liqueur. The flavor has an added note of smoke to go along with big, fairly dry, chocolate flavors. The rich, creamy mouthfeel is the overall highlight to compliment the flavor. This is a big ol' oat stout that's worth trying at least once.","brownbeer","Jul 25, 2010"

4.28,8.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Roasty, dark coffee notes blend with Baker's chocolate and a grainy oat note. Mocha bitterness lingers into the finish and clashes with the hops nicely. Alcohol is well-hidden until the very end (plus that familiar warming sensation below). Mouthfeel is velvety smooth at first, but the carbonation picks up mid-sip to add a bit of kick to the finish. The medium-thick body is near perfect in consistency: luxurious on the palate, but never too heavy. This stuff is really good--maybe even better than on-tap, which is a rarity. Independence had never really impressed me until I tried this beer almost a year ago. I just might have to start revisiting some of their other bottled selections, because Convict Hill is one excellent Oatmeal Stout.","wagenvolks","May 24, 2010"
3.06,-22.1,4,3,3,3,3,"I was not really impressed with this. More acrid coffee that I want for the style, and not nearly as creamy and smooth as I was expecting. Oatmeal Stouts should be incredibly smooth and creamy with a bit of sweetness. This is not. Not bad, but poorly made for the style IMO.","champ103","May 10, 2010"
3.84,-2.3,3,4,4,3,4,"Taste is pretty smooth with a nice balance between roast and sweetness. There are hints of Irish dry stout sourness that are not all that uncommon in an oatmeal stout, I kinda like it. It's a tad thin and does not have the viscous creamy feeling many of the best display, but this is easily and hands down the best beer from Independence, not even close. With all the new upstarts in Austin, they will need some firepower like this to compete.","twiggamortis420","Apr 27, 2010"
3.82,-2.8,4.5,2.5,4,4.5,4.5,"drinkability: cant really go wrong at 5.99 a four pack. the alchohol is very well masked and the beer is full of flavor. it just smells weird in my opinion. it is also very fresh right now and i cant wait to see how this tastes after a few months. this and stash are becoming my go to local grab.","northaustin","Feb 15, 2010"

4.35,10.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Got this on-tap at the draught house. Pours with a black color, minimal head, it looks almost oily. Smell was very creamy, hints of chocolate and coffee. The taste was creamy as well. Compared to other stouts, this was an easy drink. Even with a higher ABV, the blend was done well enough where it was hardly noticeable. Great beer from start to finish. Definitely worth a try if you enjoy stouts.","fjordhook","Oct 27, 2009"
