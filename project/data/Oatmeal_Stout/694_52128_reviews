review_text
"The beer offers light amounts of roasted coffee, a medium minus roast character with some bitterness of anies on the back. The beer has a medium minus mouthfeel and that follows on the amount of flavor as well."
""
""
""
""
"High B- (3.48)"
""
"The flavor also has a nice balance, with a modest but obvious coffee addition that mixes with the malts rather than masking them.  Excellent sweet-bitter balance."

"Dark black/brown with brown head.  Aroma lots of light/medium roast coffee.  Flavor is mocha, chocolate milk, mild coffee and dark chocolate bitterness in the finish.  Very nice coffee stout."
""
"I am not a coffee porter guy.....but I have a Troegs variety pack and it was included. Very coffee, not enough vanilla,creaminess,etc......"

"Expected a little more unique coffee flavors. Wasn't quite there to keep me coming when craving a very specific flavor pallet"

"LOVE!!!!!!!!! Especially good beer for the coffee lover!!!!!"

"Certainly a very good beer, but there are much better examples of coffee stouts on the market right now. The coffee flavors are there but are weak. There's a touch of chocolate as well. That's about it. It feels a little thin as well. Just not hitting the right notes for me."

"12 oz bottle.  Pours black with tall, creamy, long lasting beige head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of toasted malt, coffee, chocolate and herbal hops.  Body is medium and smooth.  Taste is of toasted malt, coffee, brown sugar, dark fruit and herbal hops.  Finish is long and dry. Outstanding stout."
"Fantastic damn beer. Deep brownish/black with a solid finger of tan head. Balanced coffee, cocoa nose with noticeable bitters as well. Excellent taste. Cheers. Balanced and roasty. Medium to heavy mouthfeel, with residual bitterness holding on. Nice example if a coffee stout. Proud of this PA brewski!"
"Looks great with a nice head. has a nice thick feel of a good quality stout however it was too bitter considering the coffee flavor and aroma was missing or just overpowered by the hops. I would never turn one down however it would not be a beer I will return to on my own accord."
"Appearance 3.5, Aroma 4, Flavor 3, Palate 3, Overall 3.25"

"For something called ""Java head"" I thought it was lacking coffee flavor.. It's a very good beer. Very smooth."

"On tap at Troegs.  Great coffee nose.  Somehow the hops brings out coffee in the smell and taste.  Great creamy finish.  Terrific 7.5 stout.  Gets a bonus for having sooo much taste at a lower abv."

"All in all, I'd come back to either but under 'druthers', I'd go cask. BTW this is not always the case in my book. Usually flavors survive better from casks but often, since they are higher maintenance, they can lose in the long run. In this instance, it is not the case. A real treat."

"Having a beer for breakfast?, This is the one. If you like coffee and a kick ass beer, this will suit you just fine. Medium head when poured and dissipates rather fast. Flavor is bold and finishes with just the right amount of somewhat bitter coffee flavor. Taste remains in mouth for quite awhile...but....so does coffee. High alcohol content but well balanced!"

"Black in color. Poured with a thick, light beige foam that reduced to a thick cap that left sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Dark roasted and charred malt aromas, with earthy cereal grain and dark chocolate notes. Medium bodied and creamy smooth with light, soft carbonation through the middle. The body thinned toward the finish. Dark roasted malt flavor up front immediately followed by bitter, burnt malt and roasted coffee beans. Hop bitterness kicked in from the middle to the end riding over dark roasted malt. Finished with a lingering, bitter charred malt aftertaste."
""
"Pours a deep dark brown with a finger of tan head. Most of the head dissipated but a thin film remained for quite some time. The nose has roasted notes but I am really not getting any coffee notes. The flavor is similar â€“ roast but the coffee is very, very faint. The body is fairly hearty and the finish is mildly bitter."

"Overall: Although enjoyable, I don't think its a good representation of a coffee stout. Not enough coffee or roasted malt flavor. Maybe a tad too sweet for me as well, and the aftertaste isn't that great as it's bitter for the style. With better options available, I probably won't be returning to this any time soon."

"O: Decent coffee stout. I could drink more but I have several others that I like better. This is okay across the board but doesn't stand out in any area."
""
""
"Overall - A good beer, but with a name like Java Head, you'd expect a coffee bomb... this is not. Instead it's a fairly hoppy stout with coffee character taking a lesser supporting role. Eh, it's good enough. Try it if you get the chance, but don't go out of your way to find it."
""
""
""
""
"I am drinking this beer right now as I write this. I am still enjoying the various flavors, even though I am not a fan of black coffee. That says a lot for how tasty this beer is!"

"Overall: This has been my go-to favorite from Troegs. Last I was at their brewpub this is what I had. As well being a coffee type stout, which I love. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This really beats you over the head with the burnt malts. Nothing in balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a well crafted coffee brew that isnt too much coffee and not enough beer. I will definitely buy this beer again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is a nice balance of coffee, hops and malt. Very good. The aftertaste is more than just a coffee overdose like some of these. Is very pleasant. Recommended."
""
""
""
"Surprised to see this beer only rated around the 80's overall. It's a great beer for any stout and/or coffee lovers, what really caught me off guard is finding a realization that this beer is in fact a oatmeal stout. This beer is great and taste up to its expectations. Great taste and balance of mostly semi-sweet chocolate and coffee with a nice vibe with it's bold 7.5% ABV. Mixture of sweet and bitterness with a spiky but smooth mouth-feel. I recently got a six pack from my local beverage store and it did not disappoint especially the fact of it's moderate cost. Definitely worth every penny, will be buying again soon!"

"Good coffee presence with a stout and creamy body. The raisin/plum plays well and adds a creative layer. Nice creamy texture, this went down very smooth."

""

""
"The color of this beer is, as the name implies, as coffee. It has a thin, tan head. The smell is subtle and ashy. The taste is strongly of coffee and chocolate and lingers long on the palate. The mouthfeel is slightly oily as it is not overly carbonated. Overall this is a very good beer but just shy of outstanding."
""
"o: An excellent coffee stout! I'm getting to like these a lot, because they are very tasty, and the caffeine tends to counteract the alcohol to the point your body seems to think it has just ingested a very low ABV brew, so work such as writing beer reviews can proceed pretty much uninterrupted by a serious beer high. Good when you want to drink beer with some substance but not get taken out by it."
""
"O: Java Head definitely hits a bullseye with the ""java"" claim. Lots of sweetened coffee flavors here to satisfy any Starbucks fan, or anyone who prefers their stouts on the slightly sweeter side. In terms of stouts in general, I'm not floored by this, but it's definitely a tasty brew that I wouldn't mind getting again in the future. If you're a fan of iced coffee (or coffee in general), give this one a chance."
""
""
""
"I just visited the brewery thats next to hershey and I'm surprised they didnt use their chocolate in this beer it tastes like it. The coffee beans add to the roastyness and wow this is just an incredible beer. One of my favorites that Troegs makes hands down. They ran out of it on tap at Troegs and I understand why now."

"Overall not bad. Typical straight forward stout. Nothing bad nothing great. Very drinkable."

"Bottle in trade as an extra. Big thanks! Pours black with a two finger head that is brown looks super creamy and rich. Sweet aroma of dark fruits, a little booze, a little chocolate, and coffee that is somewhat subdued for the name. Flavor follows with earthy coffee though, then comes sweet chocolate covered fruits, some nice roasted grains in the finish. Still light on the coffee for a brew called Java Head, but very nice nonetheless. Lingering sweetness left on the palate with the roast. Mouthfeel is medium heavy and pretty rich for a non-impy stout. Nice beer overall and something I could see being a nice go-to for a rich beer on a week night."
"O: I love the coffee back end, but can't get over the heavy burnt coffee front end."

"Pours a clear dark orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, char, and acidic coffee aromas. Taste is much the same with char and acidic coffee flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with a subdued coffee presence that is somewhat acrid in my opinion."

"O- a decent coffee stout, good hop & earthiness, not overwhelming coffee malt, pleasantly surprised at its approachability, but still too cloying for two in a row."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very above average. Many coffee stouts go too far with harsh flavors but this one hits a lot of the right notes."
""
""
"I don't consider myself a connoisseur but I know what I like and I know why I like it. I'm a stout lover and Troeg's Java Head is up there with the best. It poured a dark brown with a thick light brown head. The hint of coffee was well balanced and not overwhelming. Great flavor and to my satisfaction the lacing lasted to the final sip."
"Not my favorite selection from Troegs even though I love stouts and coffee. Just wasn't a memorable beer."
"Java Head pours black with no head. There is a coffee aroma; very roasted. The taste is the same, good coffee flavors, with nice roasted notes to finish. Good flavors, decent body, but overall a bit light. Overall its a stout with some nice coffee flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I was impressed by this. I'm also new with the Stout style as well. As stated, the complexity of this brew is a big reason to go and try if if you have not already. It is smooth and easy to drink. Troegs craft brews do not dissappoint. Give it a try."

"O: This is NOT FBS, not for a second. One is decadent, sweet, yet brimming with coffee; while the other (this) is hoppy, bitter, yet very easy to drink. As someone who doesn't mind a bitter-ass stout, this one is quite satisfying in my opinion."
"Overall: This is an interesting stout, and I would buy a case. It is different from other stouts with the dominance of the hops, but I find a lot of similarities with Guinness Foreign Extra Stout."

"Overall- easy drinking beer, lots of coffee flavor not over whelming. great beer"

"O-a really good, not quite great coffee stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark black, <1/4 inch of white creamy foam. Rich coffee nose, lighter roast. Creamy taste, strong coffee bean, mild bitter. Smooth. Milky mouthfeel, but not in a lactic kind of way. Bitter builds, but always contributes. Really good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a jet black body with a thin chocolate brown head. Expected a little more head but no issue here. The coffee isn't overpowering. I had to agitate the beer to produce a fuller nose. The taste gives you some iight espresso but the body is fairly thin. This drinks much more like a coffee ale bordering on a porter. Solid flavor but not exactly what the bottle describes."
""
"Java Head hits the ground running with a bold and drinkable blend. Its rich and bright and gives a level of spunk to beer drinking."

"o: kind of surprised - after trying this i think it should be rated higher than it is. it IS true that the coffee flavors could be a bit more pronounced, but its a real nice combination of roasty and sweet. drinks smooth and warms you nicely. thumbs up"
""
""
""
""

"Overall, a beer I have had many times via the bottle, first time from the tap. To be honest, didn't feel much of a difference betweeen the two. A great coffee stout, certainly one I would recommend and have again. Readily available in this part of PA."

"An old favorite from beginning craft days, haven't had one in so long I had forgotten how good this is. Looks like a stout, they're all good. Darkest brown to black, good head, beautiful lace. Nice aroma of mild roast coffee, mild bitter. Big coffee taste with a nice grapefruit, bitter orange hoppy blast. Mouthfeel oily and slick, finishes dry with that great bitter hop aftertaste. I had that Stone Dayman coffee IPA this year, guess what, this has been around and is just as good."
""
""
"O - Excellent coffee stout from Troegs, this is a bigger take on the style, but the balance of hops is what I like best here, though this isnt for the feint beer drinker, its bold."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is pretty good. I'm not too keen on coffee stouts, because I feel like there is a way to achieve a coffee character without actually using coffee. However, the coffee is a good complement and does not overpower the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours pitch black with a mocha colored head of foam that fell slowly to coat the glass with thick lace. Nose is simple, uncluttered and mild. Bittersweet chocolate with the coffee behind that. Roasted malt, dark fruit. The hops are subtle but they bring a touch of earth and floral and make the nose bright. I smell a little lemon but no oats. The taste is burnt, chocolate, the coffee steps up and emboldens the flavor of the malt. Body is thinner than it looks. The palate is beautiful simplicity like the nose and as it warms everything gains in flavor but not in intensity. Extremely well done. The drink is creamy and rich. Finishes dry, a little oily with some bitter and smoke and more coffee. This was my first stout and Troegs has won me over completely. This was a stately, pleasing stout. Undeniably delicious and easy to drink."

"If you love your beer, leave it. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. Get out there and play the field! It's a mighty big field and ""free love"" is what craft beer is all about!"

"This beer has no real flavor if you don't practically gargle with it and then all it does is burn the skin off of your uvula....Then after you swallow the party is basically over....unless you are in to a burning uvula and you go back for more. It has some strong bitterness then just a really acidic end with no after taste."

"Funny thing is that I am not a coffee drinker because I don't like hot drinks, but coffee stouts are among my favorite styles."

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- Solid but unspectacular, tastes wonderful until the bitter chocolate aftertaste overpowers the initial flavors. A bit disappointing, as I prefer stouts and porters. This is very dry and bitter. I enjoyed it, but it fell short of my expectations."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste has quite a roasted malt character to it, a bit burnt perhaps with a small bitterness on the finish. Coffee is very light. Most coffee stouts that I've had pack way more of a coffee punch than this. As it is, it comes across more like an ordinary stout to me. Those aren't really my favorite style so that's a letdown to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not sure I would classify this as an oatmeal stout as it is missing some of the sweetness and all of the smoothness expected from the style. I guess the whole flower hops really alter the typical taste profile. The burnt bitterness and the hoppy bitterness do not work for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My brother has been raving about this one for some time and I am very surprised about how good this stout is. I guess I should listen to my brother more (at least about beer). Another great beer from Troegs!"
""
""
""
""
""
"No much nose to this, but otherwise a solid coffee stout"
""
""
""
"Not very good balance in this beer. I don't understand the fruitiness - whether from yeast esters or aggressive american hops it just doesn't belong in my coffee oatmeal stout. Too much carbonation as well makes the aftertaste unpleasant and punishes each sip instead of inviting another."
""
""
""
""
"This beer grows on you. Well balanced stout, equally displays hops with coffee, good complexity. Could use less roasted malt and more crystal malt sweetness. Overall very pleasant and one of the better oatmeal stouts out there."
""
"O: A great oatmeal stout with a very coffee-forward approach. I'd say this one stands up there with the better coffee oatmeal stouts such as FBS or WnB. Definitely an underdog in the category, most likely due to the fact that it isn't labeled as an Imperial"

""

""

"Having had Java Head several times now, I've found it to be a very well-balanced coffee stout. More coffee and more viscosity would be nice, but as it stands, it's a great stout that I keep coming back to."
""
""
"O- a good coffee stout, good hop balance, I expected to get smacked with burnt coffee malt but was pleasantly surprised at its drink-ability."
""
""
""
"Overall: where is the coffee here? Basically a decent base beer but definitely is lacking a memorable quality."
"D - Nicely done, but I don't get a great deal of coffee in either the flavor or aroma. There is significant chocolate in the flavor profile, but it is more or less a slightly sweeter than average American stout."
"M/O - Full bodied, intense, and somewhat dry. This is a great brew all around. Will definitely pick this up again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, a very good beer and worth trying. Serving temp and glassware are key."
""
""
""
"I love the brash hoppiness versus the sweeter coffee notes. An experiment gone right. Excellently different. Unique and easy to revisit."
"Cheers."
"O: I enjoyed this with a melt-in-your-mouth pan-seared coffee rubbed NY sirloin with a demi glace made from the beer. The pairing was heavenly. Having a flashback (good one) right now. Will have to try this again all by itself."
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Pours black with little or no light. Of white colored head - a finge or two at pour and disappates nicely to a layer on top of the beer. Lots of spotted lacing. Smells of dark malts and coffee. Taste brings the same but adds some chocolate notes. Overall good taste but also pulling in some vibrancy from maybe fruits & hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A very tasty coffee stout with a surprising citrus element that blends perfectly with the coffee. The alcohol is hidden well making this a very drinkable ale."
"Pours black with a light brown head that recedes to the edges. Aroma seems rather underwhelming to for what I was expecting. I am not really getting much coffee, seems like I am getting some hops though offering a line pine, some licorice? on top of a roasted malt base. Flavor is as underwhelming as the aroma, and slightly off putting. Really crappy coffee, licorice?, some sugars from the oats, roasted malts, and a slightly bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is nice, fuller bodied and creamy. Overall, what a disapointment. Perhaps, however, this was my fault for drinking a Breakfast Stout right before this, if the opportunity presents itself I will have to give this another (and maybe more fair) chance."
"Overall another enjoyable brew by Troegs. Could have a little more body and maltiness but still pulls through as a great stout."
"O: a solid stout, tasty in its own right, although I would have perfected a bit more coffe and a bit more heft, perhaps an impy version of this brew, with some dialed up coffee, and this would be seriously awesome... Solid just the same though."

"Pouring aggressively into a snifter yields a powerful 1.5 inch tan head that stays put for a good 3-4 minutes. Jet black in color and smells of coffee, roasted everything, etc... nice, but nothing too crazy. First taste is burnt coffee, and very bitter at that. Very subtle coco and malty goodness on the back end but, again, nothing too complex. This beer isn't nearly as ""sweet"" as I'd expect from an oatmeal stout. Really, it's a mid-range stout from one of my favorite breweries. Java Head is slightly above average, but doesn't measure up to the rest of Troegs great brews. Having said all this, I am glad it is part of their winter variety pack as it's a good pick for the colder months."

"O- a mediocre attempt at a Java stout from a prestigious brewery...."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a decent stout. It's not extreme and it's not over-the-top. It almost drinks like a porter. Not bad, but I probably won't buy it again. I should mention however that I just love the label on this bottle."

"Mouthfeel is thin and not very satisfying for a stout. I like the acidity, but its almost gritty and not balanced by anything else. Drinkability suffers due to the basic taste - doesn't really develop other than the chocolate, and it gets a bit boring to drink to be perfectly honest. Not one of the better coffee stouts I've had."

"This is a nice, simple, easy to drink beer. It has just enough flavor to keep you interested, but it's simple enough that you can have a couple of them without worry. I enjoyed this one."

"O-a decent oatmeal stout but a little overpowered by the malt, not enough coffee"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'd like to have a little more coffee flavor in something called ""Java Head"". No comparison to some other coffee stouts (Bell's Java Stout still rules the category in my book). Not much complexity here, but not bad, either. A lot of bitter and dryness. Let it warm and breathe, and then sip it."

""
""
""
""

""

""

"O: The coffee flavor in this beer is really nice but unfortunately there is not enough other notes or complexity in this beer. It is quite bitter and the dry mouthfeel makes this not the easiest drinker, this is a slow sipping beer."
""
""
""
"O - Pretty good, the coffee or the chocolate flavor has some room for improvement, need a little more boldness. Good winter beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a pretty decent beer. I feel like the aroma is a bit muddled due to the vegetal hops, but there's a wonderful texture here and a good flavor to boot."
""
""
"This one i purchased at the brewery, it pours a nice dark as night body with a nice thick tan head that hold for a long time. The smell has nice roasted malt aroma and some hop aroma. The taste has a decent coffee flavor up front but not too strong, then i detect a hop flavor on the back of the tongue. It has a nice mouth feel, very smooth and leaves just a little bitter after taste in your mouth. Overall thsi is a good stout, even though the coffee flavors are over taken by the malt and hop."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An impressive coffee stout. It's quite unique in the way that the citrus flavors break up the coffee and caramel flavors as it crosses the palate. Well worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely a beer I'll buy again and one I'd recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've let the beer warm considerably so the nose ranges from sweet, sticky toffee to bitter, roasted coffee. The taste is just as potent with upfront grain sweetness teeming with hints of coffee, chocolate, followed by a dry, bitter finish. The mouthfeel is smooth as velvet, but I would have liked more of the grain to linger. The carbonation and full body made this a perfect dessert beer. Definitely up there with FBS and WnB, but not quite there yet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In a word ""meh."" Nothing great, not horrible but the six pack I bought was definitely more of than I want to drink. You can actually taste the grittiness of the coffee beans, but no actual coffee. There's some chocolate overtones, but in a powered box kind of way. It leaves a hell of an after taste, and again not in a good way. The more I write, the more I don't like the beer."

"I would drink again, merely to confirm the absence of the coffee I had. Man, this year is taking longer than ever to get the reviews in from March Madness, thanks to koufax21 for bringing this one."
"The taste is pretty straight forward - fresh American stout base with the addition of a coldpressed black coffee. Nice and creamy. This would likely be a routine purchase if I had this one in distribution."
"Like most of Troegs brews, the Java Head Stout get high marks in my book. It had a nice dark consistent color. Slightly reminding me of a Manhattan Special with a kick, it went down smooth and easy. I could almost taste the hops and coffee beans mixing together in my mouth for a very complex, but soothing taste. It is a little heavier than a Guinness and probably best paired with a good meal."
"A very dark stout when poured. Thick head which lasted only briefly. Didn't have the powerful coffee smell of a fresh coffee stout, was more malty with the coffee playing more a background role. The taste was dark roasted malt, chocolate and then the coffee and hops seem to tease the taste buds into guessing which is causing the bitterness. Not as thick and creamy of some of my favorite stouts, but well crafted and worthy of buying again."

"Glassware: Kisatsky Tavern pint... Occasion: rainy Sunday evening... Appearance: black--no sugar, no cream--with a cloudy, pencil-thin brown head and minimal lacing...Aroma: sharp and creamy (a paradox?) with pleasant vanilla punches...Palate: active, full-bodied presence that demands attention and lingers in the teeth--a soda pop finish...Taste: medium bitterness, with a balancing sweetness--slightly alcoholic for a 7.5 ABV ... Overall: not feeeling (or tasting) the coffee, this is a compelx beer that ttempts to brew two of my favorite things at once--and gets some points for the hints of vanilla and roastedness...a warmer on a soggy April night for sure...."
"While this is a fine drinking beer, it is better paired with a meal and one per sitting is sufficient."

""

"Overall I probably won't be getting this again. The taste is decent though super dry and the mouthfeel just doesn't do much in the way of adding dimension to the beer."
"The beer is extremely drinkable with a very smooth mouthfeel, I find my glass with much less in it than expected every time I look at it."

"O- Another solid beer from Troeg's"
"Overall this is just an average stout, nothing really makes it stand out."
""
"Drink- Overall, I enjoyed. Its a risk to do a coffee beer and it could be my fault I waited to long to drink it. I'd do the same pairing again."
""
""
""
""
"O - It is a good coffee stout with a great aroma and taste. The flavors favor bitter more than sweet, but there aren't any flavors that don't belong. I enjoy most of Troegs beers and this beer is good, but not outstanding. There are some better options, but this one is good, cheap, and available."
""
""
"Not super complex, but what's here is good. Predominantly deep, dark java. The oatmeal contributes a thick, creamy body. A solid beer with wide availability, but it can't touch Breakfast Stout. :)"
""
""
"Overall this is a flat out good, well balanced malt forward beer. The coffee taste is not as strong as most Stouts nor is there any discernable chocolate taste however the balance in this brew makes up for any shortcomings."
""
""
"A completely opaque, extremely dark brown color topped with a light tan/cream colored head. Great lacing on the glass, but the head goes down rather quickly. Aroma is sweet, with the presence of grains and the coffee bean. Taste has a 'roasted' grain flavor with coffee is in the forefront. There are hints of brown sugar and dark chocolate as well. The finish leaves you with a certain earthiness. The coffee aspect is not as nice as FBS, but I still am pleased. I wish this was thicker/fuller bodied, but it is very smooth and goes down very easily."
""
"I wish this beer was a bit thicker and the coffee flavors were a bit more pronounced and fresh. That being said, this was still a fine coffee oatmeal stout and paired well with my breakfast."

"O-A decent beer, however as it warmed more of it's flaws came out."
"O - A tasty beer I would definitely try again. I feel like its hard to make a bad coffee stout. I think the carbonation could be stepped back a bit though."
"Received in trade from Hudak, thanks man! Poured from bottle dated 10/26/2011 to a pint glass. The beer pours a deep black color with deep brown edges when held to light. A nice 1.5 finger thick brown head with good retention and lacing throughout. The nose consists of a pleasant blend of espresso and coffee tones. A hint of malty sweetness on the back end. The flavor begins with a roasted coffee flavor along with hints of chocolate malt and vanilla smoothness. Mildly bitter. Finishes smooth. No hint of alcohol. Creamy. Overall, this was extremely enjoyable. Another beer I wish I had access to more often. I would recommend."
""
""

"This is a phenomenal Stout. The oatmeal really adds substance to the complexity."

"Let me point out that the Java Head Stout from Troegs is a fantastic porter, but it is a porter, not a stout,nonetheless."
""
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: Easily drinkable but is a beer that should definitely be allowed to warm to about 55 degrees before drinking. The full complexity of the flavor is hidden a bit until the beer warms. On the whole what I would expect from Troegâ€™s, a good solid beer that works well. That said Iâ€™m learning I donâ€™t prefer coffee stouts and so will probably leave this one on the shelf or pick something else from the tap list."
""
""
""
"The pour has a nice milky tan head and some lacing on the glass. Almost a black non-see through, terrific looking stout. Not much on the nose. A bit of chocolate and cocoa but very faint. Medium bodied with a creamy mouth. To my surprise, extremely hoppy for a stout. Would not classify as an ""oatmeal stout"". To me, more of an imperial stout. Nice cocoa, liquidy chocolate taste with an unexpected hop flavor on the back end. A pretty good brew, maybe well above average."
""
""
"O - Decent oatmeal stout. Not sure if I'd get again, due to the price not fitting the quality."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very nice brew though it is lacking in what it promised to deliver: coffee! There are many better stouts out there, but there are also much worse. More coffee, especially in the nose could have made this an amazing standout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Pretty decent but not as good as Terrapin Wake N Bake or the even more impressive Founders Breakfast Stout."
""
"O- not something that I would drink again"
""
""
""
"Well, I was expecting some coffee to this brew, and...nada. The pour looked real nice - great head, great dark color. Basic roastiness in the aroma and taste, with nothing really jumping out at me. I was more disappointed by the lack of coffee than anything."
"Overall pretty enjoyable, perhaps not a favorite coffee angled brew but easily drinkable for a high abv as well."
""
"pretty darn good, kind of heavy but overall a good beer, when i get more money i'll definitely buy a case of this and stock this in my fridge"
""
"Overall- Another exceptionally nice brew from an exceptional brewery. It hits all the right notes for me, and stays away from the sweet, sticky feeling I often get from oatmeal stouts. I wouldn't want to drink more than two of these in a night, however, and it lacks the kind of flavor ""oomph"" I'd want from a moderately heavy beer. I'll definitely pick it up again and I'd love to try it on tap if I ever get the chance."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Solid look, taste, and mouthfeel. The coffee was not overpowering, which was nice."
""
""
"O - Pretty disappointed in this. Just wasn't as complex as I would expect. Not a very good stout IMHO."
""
"Overall: For a "" "coffee"" beer this was actually lacking in the ""coffee"" department would have loved more. The beer over all is not bad but kinda missed what it was trying to be"
"I would rate this an average stout. I didn't know it was an oatmeal stout until I read the description. It wasn't every thick and was overly carbonated for the style. The flavors were on the mild side and lack character. However, it's not bad at all, just not great."

"O: Wow. My mouth is so happy. Coffee, hops, oats. Total beergasam. We know the Man upstairs likes beer b/c Troegs made it through the recent floods, and this is one of the reasons why they made it. So many flavors, so perfectly well balanced. Again, I love coffee beers, so this rDev will be skewed towards the uptick. Big ups 2 Troegs!"

"Full mouthfeel with light carbonation. Recommended!"
"There is a lot of flavor packed into the medium body. I drank half of the bomber thinking that it was low alcohol, like this was a session coffee stout. There should be such a thing. I didn't check the ABV until the second half of the bottle. It's not the best coffee stout out there, but it's extremely drinkable."
"O - Interesting stout, I would certainly have another but not necessarily seek this one out."
"Overall: Nice, smooth coffee stout. This is tasty stuff if you in the mood for a robust stout without an overdose of sweetness. It is what it advertised itself as."
"Overall â€“ This beer definitely scores points for having an interesting taste. It has some promise and just needs a little tinkering to be a truly great beer. As a fan of American Black Ales I'd probably pick this one up again."
"Poured into a Troegs pint glass, an impenetrable black color with a solid finger of beige head, that displayed good retention and lacing. Smelled like a breakfast spread of toasted pumpernickel, spiced oatmeal and black coffee. Taste of dark roasted malts, bready, with lots of coffee--more on the bitter side and less mellow--and notes of dark fruits, citrus zest, grains, and even a touch of hoppiness which is typically unexpected for the style. Interesting. Medium mouthfeel, smooth, and quite drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is thin, a bit bubbly. Been looking forward to trying this one for awhile but I could pick up a 22 of Guinness xtra stout which is nearly as good as this for half the price."
"Pours a super dark brown w/ a perfect two finger chocolate head. Excellent lacing on my snifter. This beer is very close to being a 5 on appearance- it looks fantastic for the style. The nose is a little on the subtle side, although not bad. Hops, chocolate, and coffee are the main things I get (as expected). Very smooth and mellow smells from this beer. Taste is great- excellent taste for the style. The coffee/chocolate/hops and malt all seem to be in perfect balance. It's very smooth, silky, and makes me want to take another sip. None of the 7.5% ABV is evident to me. Medium mouthfeel, with a smooth, silky finish. A little dryness in there as well. Overall, this is another winner from Troegs. I would definitely have this again. Cheers."
"Great beer, hits the marks where it should. Solid, well made stout that hits the spot."
"O-Very good beer. Very smooth, tasteful and not overdone. Good amount of coffee flavor and a perfect abv for the style."
"QUITE NICE, WORTH TRYING!"
"Overall: Excellent, absolutely wonderful. This bottle was aged for a few months and I am very happy with the results. One of the best mouthfeels. Taste is lovely, as well as everything else. A formidable competitor in the oatmeal stout world."
"Overall a well made beer with an unbeatable value. If you're looking for a nice stout, go ahead and reach for it."
"cheers"
"D -"
"Overall: Good, but I've had better coffee beers before."
"Pour a thick black hue with a small brown head. Aroma of dark roasted caramel malt, espresso beans, and some cacao. Taste is dark roasted malt and espresso, cacao, some toasted oatmeal. Palate is a full rich body, with a creamy oily texture, and moderate carbonation. Finish is dark roasted / burnt espresso beans, dark malts, some light cacao and a toasted oatmeal with some hops. Overall an interesting but drinkable brew."
"O: Great Stout â€“ although coffee portion was pretty weak. Could have been better, but all around it was very good. Troegs is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"Pours jet black with a white two finger head into my bruery tulip. Aroma is weak, malts and feint coffee. Taste follows the nose, very light, like drinking a Guinness with a dash of coffee. Smooth and easy to drink, hides the alcohol well. Not bad if your looking for a light tasting stout, just not what I was looking for."
"Overall I found it to be fantastic and will definitely be trying this again in the future. Maybe I got a great batch, if so, I'm glad I did."
"O: I wanted to like this one but it was just not as good as others in the style. I'd take Wake N Bake over this any day but I like my coffee stouts to be big and in your face. This is more like a hint of coffee."
"O - First offering I have had from Troegs and it was very enjoyable. 7.5% alcohol is hidden nicely and it is a very drinkable stout. Definitely recommended."
"Pours pretty much straight up black with a filmy tan head that left lots of lacing. I could smell tobacco along with citrus and green pepper on a base of coffee and black chocolate. Surprisingly I could taste a lot of citrus hop flavors followed by jalepeno, cocoa and bitter coffee. It feels very smooth, thick and creamy with low carbonation and a nice lingering finish. I would recommend trying this one to anybody, it's hoppier than most stouts and has lots of different flavors."
"All in all, a good beer that I enjoyed drinking, but not at all what I was expecting given the style and title."
"O: This is a pretty good stout. It isn't overly complex and amazing, but it certainly isn't bad and it hits the spot. I do think the label is packing some pretty cool artwork as well."
"I'm also not a fan of these new caffenated alchohol drinks I see in 7-11, they just encourage wide awake drunks!"
"O: A nice stout. It goes down smooth on a warm summer night."
"O - This beer is so much better as it warms. Upfront the coffee bitterness dominates. As it warms it softens a bit, the creamy mouthfeel becomes more pronounced. Nice."
"If you're looking for a rich, satisfying stout ... pass on this one."
" Overall- Not a masterpiece, but a fine sipper that wonâ€™t bore you or weigh you down. It would have been nice for the coffee to come out a bit more."
"Final Thoughts: A very nice stout. It was a pleasure to drink in the evening."
"good, but needs a bit of depth. not as chewy as I'd like in a coffee stout, but pretty tasty."
"Overall as I've already stated it's a good stout, but not a good Coffee or Oatmeal Stout."
"Overall: One of the best yet from Troegs, as they combine two of my favorite beverages: coffee and beer. I can see myself having a few of these in one sitting, though not your typical session beer at 7.5% ABV. When I want a coffee stout style beer, I know where to go..."
"O â€“ Overall, I liked the coffee flavor in this brew and that it was not cloyingly sweet. On the downside, it was a bit watery in mouthfeel. Just above a middle of the road rating on this offering for me. Glad I had the opportunity to try, but would not make this a regular."
"There's things to like, and things to dislike about this one. It's got some lovely flavours, and the coffee is worked in very nicely with the rest. But there's no basis for it, and the 7.5% is high for a beer with so little body. You feel it after a while, and you wonder why you should."
"O: I wish this was available here. This is a smooth drinker and pleasantly sweet, not sugarbomb sweet though. I'm really liking Troegs so far.."
"O: Overall an enjoyable beer, not as refined or as smooth as some of the best in the style"
"This almost comes off more as a porter than a stout. For 7.5% ABV it's drinkability is definitely high and there are no real glaring flaws. Maybe the Troegs brothers intended to brew a very smooth and lightly flavoured 7.5% coffee stout, in which case I would say this is well done. For my taste, however, I would prefer something advertising itself as 'Java Head' to present more coffee flavour and for a 7.5% stout to be more intensely flavoured overall. A decent brew but not one I would be interested in revisiting."
"If you are unfamiliar w/ Porters and Stouts, it doesn't hurt to start here; you might find yourself a new favorite beer. However, if you've tasted big leaguers: Fullers, SN, Founders, Youngs, Anchor or Rogue, you very well may be quite disappointed."
"Poured ontap into a pint glass, dark brown in color with a khaki colored head. Aroma of roasted malt and a bit of coffee. In the flavor, a nice roasted presence with some mild dark roast coffee presence. A kiss of earthy hops is noted in the finish. Medium to full bodied feel. Overall, a nice roasted presence, some coffee and hops mix well. A pretty decent stout."
"D - Great drink to top off the evening; nice burnt coffee and taste and smell; great combination of conventional stout flavors"
"O: Great coffee stout. Heavy espresso taste makes this a great beer to pair with dark chocolate, chocolate or coffee desserts."
"Slightly above average stout overall. Troegs is probably my favorite brewery so I would love it if they made a bigger stout."
"Poured a thick, mahogany color with a one finger tan head. The aroma was that of roasted malt, some coffee, and actually a faint hint of chocolate. Faint coffee and a little chocolate in the taste with some roasty malt gives way to a nice oat kick in the end. Has a smooth mouthfeel and goes down easy. It is a nice representation of the style, but it's not Anderson Valley Barney Flats good. I know the summertime is an odd time for a stout, but I was in the mood for a switchup."
"This beer poured out as a thick looking black liquid with a mocha colored head on it. The lacing was thin but showed itself on the glass. The smell of this beer roasted but I was struggling to get the coffe aromas from it. I was hoping that I'd be more impressed with this brew. The taste had a some burnt malt flavors with a creamy oat taste in the back. The mouthfeel could have been a little thicker. All in all this beer was alright, I just felt like something was missing."
"Overall, with Central Waters Coffee Stout around, it's a tough battle for the kingdom. A valiant effort none the less, but one that comes up just a bit short...like most Mavericks. Make your sports or political connections at will."
"Ok, the temp is up to 53 and let's see what we have here. The nose is the same, no changes there. The flavors were about the same with perhaps an additional of some chocolate on the back half. While there is no great change to the flavors per se, at the warmer temperature the flavors were much more accessible and more enjoyable."
"D/O- Overall a solid coffee/chocolate based oatmeal stout. Drinkable enough to have two or three, which is saying something for the style. Recommended for normal gravity stout fans."
"Medium bodied with a tingle across the tongue. Coats nicely and carries flavor across the entire tongue. Definitely very enjoyable when I am in the mood for a not-so-filling stout."
"O: SLightly too bitter, imo. 3.5"
"O- A good coffee stout- not the best example of this style, but solid overall. Nice balance of malt/hop/coffee."
"D - I like it but a little too coating and tiring for session."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a deep black with a small light brown head. Goes away fairly quickly. Aroma of hops, bit of coffee and molasses... not very strong. Flavor beings with a good burst of citrus and piney hops. Very prominent for the style. Hops give way to more traditional oatmeal stout flavor. Sweet, creamy, milk and a hint of chocolate syrup. Decent black coffee kick a tad more hop profile finish this one out. Very smooth."
"O: I can say that I enjoyed Troeg's Javahead Stout as a variation from the norm one-dimensional, roasty stouts. The char character could have been toned down in my opinion and the hops a little more complimenting of the roast profile. However, I would rule this beer as one worthy of a revisit for its unique and surprisingly refreshing character."
"Cheers..."
"Overall: An excellent coffee stout. For lovers of stouts of all kinds, this really is a must-try. Coffee, chocolate, and Cascade hops all exist in perfect ratios. One of my new favorite stouts..."
"Pours a two-finger brown head that fades quickly some lace. Deep brown color, mahogany highlights. Good carbonation and heavy bodied. Nose is roasted coffee/chocolate, flavor is roasted coffee with a burnt coffee finish. Nice IS. $5.99 for a 22oz bottle from Kappy's Fine Wine & Spirits Peabody, Ma."
"Overall, a very solid beer and one I would get again."
"O: I didn't really dig this and neither did my tasting friend. We both thought it was rather bland and had a stale coffee taste. I had pretty high expectations for this, both from hearing a lot about this stout and the fact that I love NN. I wasn't impressed."
"By most standards, this is a very solid coffee stout -- by most standards. To the extreme stout enthusiast it lacks body and enough coffee punch. That being said, its balanced drinkability is surprising and I wouldn't turn one down."
"O-> A nice effort. Not bad by any means, but not stellar, knock my socks off either. This is a very serviceable coffee stout that lives up to its name with flavor. I would probably have it again as a ""cleanser"" beer with or after dessert."
"(22oz bottle). Pours near black with pillowy khaki head. Light carbonation bubbles. Aroma has loads of coffee, chocolate, caramel, and a little wood. Taste has a nice sweet malt backbone followed with some roasty bitterness that tastes like coffee grounds (in a good way; not gritty). Medium to full bodied with an oily texture. Finish is dry and slightly chalky. Taste didnâ€™t quite live up to the aroma, and Iâ€™d prefer a little more sweetness as the roast started to overwhelm the beer. Still, its a decent beer and one for big coffee lovers."
"Enjoyed from a variety pack that a friend of mine picked up in Pennsylvania. TrÃ¶egs makes some nice brews and this is one of them. Not as much coffee on the nose and tounge as I would have expected, but still a good beer. Mouthfeel and beer was slighty above average."
"I got this beer in a trade with listenatjoes, thanks Joe! Poured this beer in my Struise glass the beers looks very nice with a pitch black fluid and a decent head. Coffeesmell and dito taste. Groundnotes in the nose. A good and honest stout which could use a bit more alcohol. For this style a good beer."
"The mouthfeel is thinner than expected. Was hoping for something creamier and thicker. Overall, great tasting and easy to drink. An overall great stout, just falls short on my extremified stout palate."
"O - Great beer, I would definitely buy again. The strong alcohol flavor would be its biggest downfall, but impressive coffee beer overall."
"O: Overall I would say this beer is well worth picking up. Drink it cold but slow, while it warms up you really get to enjoy it."
"Overall this is a decent stout. easy to drink. the sweet chocolately flavors are the best part, everything else is just average."
"Pours a dark brown, not opaque, light gets through, light brown head, fluffy. Smell is toned down, not the strong coffee scent you'd expect. I get more chocolate and char rather than coffee, but not in a bad way. It has a bit of a dry finish, not very sweet, has some bitterness. Overall, not a bad stout, just needs more of a coffee boost for it to be aptly named Javahead."
"Bottle from Premiere. A coffee novel, with very little drinkability. Reddish dark brown body, coffee and roasted nose. Dry mouthfeel, with chocolate and real coffee, a little acidic. I just could not get into it, tried again a while later, and drain poured it."
"More nuances to the beer are revealed as it warms up to room temperature. The 7.5% is very well hidden under the attack of so many flavors. An enjoyable stout this Friday evening."
"Love all of the stuff I've had from Troegs, bought this for the NCAA championship game. To be honest, I was sort of let down. It pours a great dark brown color, has a nice roasty coffee smell, but I felt the taste was lacking a bit. The relatively high ABV is pretty well hidden, and there's some good kiss of hops upfront buried in the coffee taste, but the aftertaste is a bit bland and boring. Average beer, expected better for sure."
"D - I quite liked this coffee stout and would have more"
"(Drinkability): The Troegs Java Stout is one of those beers that feels like it's on the verge of an identity crisis. Is it supposed to be desserty? Hoppy? Light? Heavy? I really don't know. I love a good coffee stout every now and again, but this one just feels lost and out of place. They should rename this batch Troegs IPA w/ Java. Not horrible, but not really good either."
"D - Pretty good drinkability here. It was a bit of a sipper for me, but quite easy to drink. This is definitely one of the better oatmeal stouts that I have had so far. Overall, I enjoyed this beer and I would buy it again."
"The taste boasts of roasted coffee, malts, and hops. The hops aren't overpowering but you know they're there. It finishes nicely and begs you to drink another but be careful, at 7.5% ABV, it catches up to you quickly. It is without a doubt, my favorite stout and one of my favorite beers."
"Overall I was a fan of both vintages but if I had to choose one I would go for the 2010, although that's not a surprise for a coffee-forward beer. In any event, this is a solid beer that's worth a shot."
"D - Very drinkable. Flavors are really smooth and nicely balanced. Overall, nice and creamy, could maybe use a little more of a punch, but a really tasty beer."
"It's a good beer, don't get me wrong. But I was expecting something like Founder's Breakfast Stout. If this had a bunch of coffee in it, it certainly didn't come through over the regular flavors of dark roasted malt."
"Overall this is an average brew for me. Love the other offerings from Troegs but this was kind of a let down"
"O-Overall I like this beer. Pretty drinkable and tasty as well. Would pair well with any dessert or sweet item served."
"Its an excellent stout for the price, it only cost me $9.99 for a six pack and the 7.5 abv is hardly noticeable."
"O - For those who enjoy coffee stouts, this is certainly worthy. A great baseline of the style to compare spme of the whales against."
"D- This beer was highly drinkable but there was something missing I can't quite put my finger on. I really enjoyed the flavors overall and the ABV wasn't really detected at all making this beer a sleeper. I really liked this beer but like I said there was something missing to it."
"D=Abv is not overpowering or is the espresso taste, sits fairly light in the stomach, Two or three of these in a sitting is definitely doable"
"D- I have never been a huge fan of stout beers. But the missing dry finish and chalkiness that this beer has allows me to really enjoy the flavor without the disappointment of the aftertaste. Finally, a stout I can enjoy."
"D - Normally a sipper to start the night off for me, but the ABV is not that noticeable. Sessionable for the right person I suppose."
"12oz bottle. Can't find a bottled on date. Pours a dark, almost black brown with a thin head. Medium amount of lacing. Aromas of coffee, vanilla, chocolate, and a hint of caramel. Flavor is kind of like a dark roasted coffee with cream and sugar. Some vanilla and a bit of a dark chocolate finish. Creamy mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable for this sweet style of beer. Overall I like this beer and would seek it out again. It is certainly one of the standout beers in the mix 12 pack."
"OVERALL: Not off putting by any stretch of the imagination, and quite drinkable to be honest, but simply too mild and mute to be noteworthy. A fantastic feel for sure, and some nice flavors are definitely there, but everything just needs a little more umph to make it stand out. One worth checking out, but if every batch is like this, then it won't be all that memorable."
"Drinkability: I thought this beer was very good and well balanced. I'll come back to it again when I'm in the mood for a coffee beer."
"Tastes milder than the nose, but I found this highly drinkable and easy to put down. This is a classic oatmeal stout that brings enough grains and coffee into the mix to balance the sweetness."
"Overall, very let down by this beer. Had ""Java"" not been in the name, I might have liked this more but overall a so-so stout."
"Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer. The name of the beer is a little misleading. There is some coffee flavor in the beer's finish, but this beer really has the taste of a good oatmeal stout. Although not a primary focus, the coffee flavor adds to the overall enjoyment of this beer."
"D: An okay beer but not one I would ever seek out, especially with all the other great coffee and/or oatmeal stouts out there."
"Big thanks goes out to bs870621345 for a bottle of this! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured pitch black with a massive five finger khaki head that subsided to two fingers upon sitting. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, cream, dark fruit, and slight coffee. The flavor was of sweet malt, slight raosted malt, cream, slight caramel, and very subtle coffee bean. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this brew wasn't that bad, but it was also not that awesome either. The flavor for me needed to be more robust in some aspects so you could pick up on what they were trying to make here. This one just missed the mark on this key point if I'm honest. Worth trying at least once, but that is about it."
"Drinkability (3): I wouldn't call this a breakfast beer and that's what I look for in a coffee oatmeal stout. The char flavor is too strong and there is little coffee to speak of. It's a borderline imperial stout and could probably be toned down a bit on the ABV without losing much. Maybe this is more of a nightcap beer than a wake-up beer, but perhaps I was deceived by the java namesake."
"Anyways, it definitely pairs well with dark chocolate. Not the best of stouts, but definitely good enough to try. Good drinkability."
"I enjoyed this beverage. Very good for coffee/java stouts. I would recommend this beer for stout lovers."
"Overall: Solid. The level of hopping is a bit strange, but I like it."
" A decent beer."
"D - The dry body and coffee grind character slows the drink down."
"Pours dark black with a finger width of foamy tan head. Tan lacing left all the way down. Nose is sweet and creamy; notes of coffee bean, baker's chocolate, vanilla and roasted malt. Taste follows the nose; burnt, toasty malt is upfront, bitterness follows into the finish. Mild hops apparant. Not sure why this is an Oatmeal Stout, perhaps it is a bit creamy in the mouthfeel. Medium to heavily bodied. Not bad drinkability; I wouldn't normally have subsequent stouts in a session, so one bottle is just fine. Enjoyable. Glad to see a bottling date, impressed and will seek out more from Troegs."
"D - A decent stout for sure. Not too much coffee present but that's ok. I really enjoyed this one and wouldn't mind drinking it again but I wouldn't seek it out."
"D - Accurately named with fresh coffee being foremost in smell and taste, and I was surprised to see how much hop presence that it did have. I'd get it again."
"D: Decent beer, but from the bottle, it just doesn't stand out from the coffee stout crowd."
"Very nice stout here, and one of the best ""Oatmeal"" stouts I've had. This one is very easy to drink, is affordable (5.99 for a 22oz bomber?!?) and is just plain outright good. I think that if this one is available for a while, I'm going to buy as much as I can. Fantastic."
"D- pretty drinkable. Not an all night long beer but a nice brewbrew"
"Looks like a good stout with thick off-white head. Lacing all the way down as you drink. The smell is lacking the coffee that I was expecting, but it was there. Otherwise nothing special in the aroma. Its a stout that I like but the fact that it was brewed with coffee beans makes me think that it should hit you with more than the just the stout taste. It's a good beer and stout but I expected more out of the taste since it was labelled as such. All that said, it was easy to drink and has a nice mouthfeel. Troegs does good things though and that should not be forgot."
"D: One of the easier to drink coffee stouts, but far from the greatest out there. Still, there is nothing really wrong with this brew, there's just simply nothing really outstanding. Pick a couple up if you love coffee."
"1305"
"This was a pleasant suprise! I will definately get myself a full sixer of this on my next journey to the beer store!"
"I cant imagine calling this one a stout, oatmeal stout, coffee stout, or any other kind of stout. At best it is a weak black IPA but realistically, this is a dark imperial amber ale. Its sweet and malty. Kind of an Arrogant Bastard meets Rogue Imperial Red meets Southern Tier Iniquity. Maybe my bottle is old as hell; who knows. I still dont understand the lack of a brewed on/bottled on date. Anger! Not my cup of tea, or in this case, not my cup of coffee. Not a stout!"
"A well made beer."
"Maybe just a bit too American for my tastes. I thought the coffee was nicely done, but the roasted and hop bitterness in the finish clashed a little."
"This beer is thinner than the flavors lead me to expect, and leaves me wanting more body. On the other hand, drinkability is quite good, and it would be easy to have a few of these."
"Wow, what a disappointment. I like Troegs, this is the first brew I've tried from them that I didn't like. Beer is just ""thin"". Doesn't look like a stout, pours dark brown with a thin light tan head. Smell was weak, mild coffee roast with background of sweet malts but nothing stood out. Tasted ""weak", no full flavors. The mouthfeel was the worst, almost watered down...more like a cheap lager style."
"Notes - All in all, a very good, but not outstanding coffee stout. If a few things were tweaked a little bit I would probably enjoy this one even more, but it's plenty enjoyable as is."
"Final Thoughts - Take this beer and make it an Imperial Stout and I think we have a winner minus the smoke and light ash. All these components Imperialized would be fantastic again, minus the smoke and light ash components here. I'm all about mouthfeel with Stouts so that would explain my opinion on the matter here. Well done I'd say though on what was trying to be accomplished. Somewhat similar to Old Rasputin but I'd say close to on par."
"D - This is okay, really needs more flavor and depth, drinkability is average for the ABV."
"The beer is a gorgeous pour but everything else is left to be desired. The smell and taste barely even had coffee, this beer is clearly not one they will be known for. What they got right was how an oatmeal stout should feel and how I envision stouts should pour."
"I don't really give a Schlitz about Java Head, though I am glad that I got to try it."
"A good stout here. Love the coffee flavors picked up in their ""french press"" through extra whole leaf hops and coffee beans. Gives this brew a truly unique taste. Malt flavors power this beer and hops give it a great balance for the style. Pours out a dark thick coffee color with a decent head. Foams not as tight as Guinness but still not too out of line. notched a mark after every sip. overall i'l' be buying this brew again for sure."
"Troegs Java Head Stout pours an intense-looking black with about an 1/8 inch head that reduces to a scattered film suggesting low carbonation and there is moderate lacing. I catch an earthy, roasty, chocolate smell. Taste is dominated by coffee beans, oats, and chocolate. A very well-balanced oatmeal stout with the roasty malts taking over and the hops complimenting very nicely. Low to medium carbonation, the strongness of the coffee beans really is the main shield against the 7.5% ABV. A very drinkable brew that you will want to have more than one of because it is complex and smooth at the same time."
"Notes: This is a decent oatmeal stout otherwise it's not too shaby. Cheers."
"It goes down quite well, but the light sense and the bitters kind of put me off after a while. I was hoping for a more full bodied stout, but I suppose this could be a great dry stout? I'll have to develop a taste for that."
"D: Absolutely loved this beer, very superb! No hop bitterness. All the coffee notes were ideal."
"D: Very easy drink, but there is really nothing special here. The sweet upfront flavor throws me off a little here. This beer has the unluckiness of following up a FBS review and it isn't even a 1/10 of that. Hopefully I wasn't too hard on it as it is a decent stout."
"I'd get this again. $2.10 a single."
"overall - very surprised by this beer. Its been a while since i've had an oatmeal stout, and I forget how enjoyable they are. Very drinkable."
"D- Overall this stout was pretty bitter and seemed a bit brash. Kind of surprised to find this much flavor packed into a non-imperial stout..."
"D- Alright, but there are better examples out there, it just doesn't compete with others in the style."
"pours a nice dark brown with a big mocha head. tons of complexity in the nose, getting a lot of piney hops, followed up by creamy coffee and oats. taste is a bit perplexing, starts with big time troegs signature hoppiness but is accompanied with a lot of creamy coffee flavor. the mouthfeel though is lacking significantly, far too thin and the coffee loses a bit of what was found in the nose. finishes off with a refreshing bitter bite. drinkability is good with the low abv, but I think there might have been too much going on here to have more than a bottle."
"I find I want to chug this bad boy down and go find another. I wish you couldn't see the average rating before you rate yourself. A B+ seems a bit low for this beer, but that just might mean that this one matches my palate better than it did for others. This is also the first Troeg that I thoroughly enjoyed. Nicely done!"
"taste steps up, instant hoppy punch without the grapefruity mentolation...broad and bitter (in a good way). not catching the coffee yet...simple actually but very refreshing, near perfect viscosity and roil in the mouth, very drinkable. reminds me somewhat of a basic Guinness Extra Stout, but lighter. to the point and delicious. very dry finish."
"Drinkability - This is an easy to drink stout , the sweet is well blended with the bitter coffees and mild hops,decent balance of all the flavors that are in this stout."
"D: Sort of an odd concoction, when you think about it; a citrusy, herbal, hopped up coffee stout that drinks with the sweetness of an oatmeal or milk stout as well. It doesn't necessarily jive on the palate all the time and the 7.5% ABV is a doozy. But, I think Troegs Java Head is an enjoyable stout that doesn't overdo the coffee bitterness at the expense of making a well-crafted and balanced stout."
"Drinkability - I could drink a couple of these but it's nothing special."
"I definitely wish I'd gotten a bottle or two of this beer to go."
"4.0 D: Good enough beer, but could use a bit more sweetness and a creamier mouthfeel. Still, I doubt I'd pass this up."
"Pours a deep dark brown with a half-finger width tan head on top. Great lacy rings left behind after each sip. The nose is full of fresh-ground coffee, warm cookies, and hints of vanilla. The mouth is creamy-smooth from a good oat presence. Good black coffee, mild hops, roasted sugar, sweet milk chocolate in the flavor. Very nice Oatmeal Stout. The alcohol is noticed faintly on the back end, but it's not as prominent as expected. Good beer."
"D: Very drinkable, this is a great oatmeal coffee stout."
"D: This is good, yet not my favorite. Not as creamy as I would have liked."
"Overall a solid coffee stout."
"D: This is a decent coffee stout, could have been a little bit more coffee for me but I'm a coffee junkie maybe its just right for others. I bet its good on cask."
"Coffee flavors don't come to full fruition as the hops and roasted malt mute most of the coffee out. A decent Stout regardless."
"MF&D - Thick and Chewy. Coates the mouth well. A nice stout."
"Overall a very well made and unique coffee stout, one I've sought out a few times."
"d- a bit one note for me, but still very enjoyable and goes down easily - can't go wrong with any of troegs beers this one included, love them."
"Served to me with a two finger off-white/tan head. Black as the night with very little light passing through. Smell is of chocolate malts, roasted malts and a little coffee. Taste follows suite with a heavy dose of roasted malts and some chocolate and coffee. The coffee element is very muted considering the use of coffee in the brewing process. I like the subtle coffee flavors but it doesn't fit the name. Finishes clean with a healthy dose of bitterness. Full bodied mouthfeel with a semi-fluid feel on the tongue. Nice, drinkable stout overall. It just needs a properly fitted name."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how smooth it drinks. As an oatmeal stout, the beer is expected to have that clean, refined feel as it sips. To this it does not disappoint. To note, the label is also very inventive. For something with a coffee element in the name, the aroma and subsequent taste could have focused a bit more on infusing that characteristic into the profile but, in the end, the drinker is left satisfied with the blend provided."
"D-4.5"
"D/M: drinks very smoothly, slides a bit thickly across the pallet, great taste and character make it a good drinking brew, strong carbonation presence"
"D-Good for the ABV, a tasty beer that doesn't overwhelm and remains fairly smooth. A good value for the style."
"as for drinkability need i say any more."
"A very nice stout for sure. This was my first Troegs experience and it obvious that they put some effort into their brews. Next up, the Troegs Hop Back. Gotta work my way through the 12 pack this week! Merry Christmas"
"Good beer, enjoyable, not to bitter, easy to drink."
"edit: enjoyed this more at cellar temp. more chocolate and a little more coffee come out."
"I will always take a breakfast stout over this, but I would be very happy as this beer for my second or third choice."
"22 ounce bottle. Pours deep brown with a once finger tan head with good retention that recedes to a thick cap. Great glass lacing. Aromas of coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, and some vanilla. Taste of some chocolate and coffee, lots of malts. A slightly bitter finish, but not that strong. Creamy body, but it comes out a bit thin feeling. Solid stout, pretty good."
"drinkability: on par"
"At 7.5%, it's not exactly a session beer. But, the drinkability is pretty standard. It's a nice oatmeal stout, but not top of the line."
"Definitely an enjoyable stout, but I would have rather seen them resurrect the oatmeal stout or converted scratch 27 into a year round stout. Please John bring back scratch 27 or the oatmeal stout!"
"Taste for Java Head contains java, more chocolate, malts, some spices such as cinnamon, very rich overall. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is very good on this coffee stout from Troegs. Its been some time since I have tried something from Troegs and I am happy to finally get around to this one. This is one beer that is very much worth your time."
"Morey's Bottom Line: One of Troeg's only offerings that I had yet to have. Glad I did. Never had their Oatmeal Stout, but this is very good."
"Overall: Overall the beer was decent. Not much smell or chew, but the flavor was decent. It delivers on the coffee taste that it advertises. There are definitly better stouts out there, but this is worth a try for any coffee flavored stout lovers."
"T: I wouldn't classify this as an exemplar of the style, but if you like coffee stouts, this will certainly do the job."
"Overall-great example of an Oatmeal Stout, one of the top out there. Plenty of coffee, lives up to the name. Very well done."
"D - With the strong flavors and heavier body, this isn't a session beer. It's a great after work or desert beer though."
"Arrived with two fingers of dense deep-tan head with excellent retention, right from the handpump. Color was a deep dark-brown with zero light penetration except at the edges. Nose had qualities of dark chocolate, coffee, and charcoal. Mouthfeel was full and creamy with a pronounced dark-roast coffee taste on the tongue. Finish lingered with anise, bittersweet chocolate and charcoal. Very dry and would be an excellent accompaniment with dessert. Nice lacing throughout."
"Another fine offering from the Troegs Brewing Company. And I'll raise my glass in hopes that the lowly Detroit Lions can find a way to knock off those nasty Pats while I enjoy this brew."
"Medium bodied, but a little thin considering the style. A bit of chewyness and dry edges in the feel. Smooth, easy drinking, and goes down pretty quick considering the abv, which is masked very well. Another hit from Troegs."
"This is an excellent example of an excellent coffee stout."
"very drinkable for the style and flavors."
"If you like coffee and beer the java head is a great beer for you. I have the opportunity to teast this beer at the brewery itself, in the teasting room. Was a good hardy stout but not made for drinking is mass amounts. the beer had a rich coffee smell which made it quite interesting. overall the beer was good."
"D= Delicious for coffee lovers that's for sure. This is a world class coffee stout but I don't think they do enough to make it an oatmeal stout. The oatmeal plays a secondary role and the mouth is quite thin on it."
"Wish it had more coffee flavored influence. A good stout."
"Poured almost black into my favorite snifter. Foam disippated into a light tan ring. Moderate carbonation. Roasty toasty aroma with a hint of coffee. Quite honestly not as coffee forward as I expected. Same with the taste. Malt backbone, a hint of hops, nice and dry but only mild coffee. Mouthfeel was dry and the brew was certainly easy drinking."
"D - A very drinkable coffee stout. A nice rich, roasty, offering perfect for a cold day like this."
"Overall, a decent effort. I was craving a stout and reached for this one out of the beer fridge and it hit the spot. Like I said, it wasn't anything like I expected it to be but that's not a bad thing. Its certainly worth a try!"
"This one poured a midnight black with a skimpy khaki head that laced the glass. It smells rich and sweet, almost like a milk stout. It smells of coffee beans and milk chocolate. The taste too echoes the milk chocolate, probably more so because this was bottled in September of 2009. It has really good flavor, rich and creamy. It drinks pretty light for a stout and is a light to medium. It's very, very drinkable. I really liked this one. I was glad I picked it up while in Cleveland."
"Java Head Stout pours with a very dark, nearly black body and 1 finger of creamy tan head. The aggressive pour yielded some nice retention and lacing on my pint glass. Initially the predominant aroma is chocolate, but i pick up some coffee and roasted malt scents after a few more whiffs - nothing bold. The taste is very similar to the smell but more pronounced, some chocolate upfront with some nice coffee flavors coming through in the middle and back. Creamy in the mouth, with moderate carbonation and little (if any) indication of the 7.5 % ABV. Nice to see this become a year round offering from the Troegs Brewery - a welcome addition to my fridge!"
"Very nice."
"This is a dense black beer with a very thin tan head. The aroma is coffee, black-patent, a bit of booze, and grain. The taste is bitter and intense. Espresso, bitter chocolate, roasted malt, and a touch of bittering hops. It's an engaging and very drinkable beer. Full in body. If anything, the flavor is dominated by coffee...it could be a bit more intense. Still, very good."
"Pretty drinkable. I like to cap off the night with a stout as opposed to drinking several in a row, but I could drink another one of these after this no problem."
"This brew is very crisp and refreshing. As some have stated in there own reviews of this brew, drink this reminds me of really almost drinking coffee. Its cold and has a wonderful flavor. I would love to be able to drink this in the morning. This is another great brew, that I have had from TrÃ¶egs."
"D - Good overall brew. Well balanced."
"The mouthfeel is good also. It is very drinkable. Even my wife liked this one."
"I had this after a long night of work, so a good beer was needed. Great stout with a strong mouthfeel. Finishes smooth, but there is a little heat from the alcohol, but in a good way. Flavors of citrus, coffee, and caramel make this an all around enjoyable experience."
"Honestly, this was surprisingly tasty. I wasn't worried that it would be awful at all. Troegs knows their shite."
"overall, a good solid stout"
"D - It's good, and my bottle disappeared quickly, but it wouldn't be my first choice when shopping for a coffee stout."
"Pours jet black. Has an intensely sweet taste almost like molasses which finishes like coffee. The smell is all too much like coffee. Overall it isn't bad but other tastes make it taste less like a beer and more like carbonated iced coffee. Feels kind of smooth, a bit light for its strength. Goes down nice enough"
"D: The coffee taste after the swallow is refreshing and recalls energizing memories of drinking actual coffee. I would drink it during the day instead of coffee.... if I drank beer during the day."
"D: Good, although the bitterness seems a little heavy, while the mouthfeel seems a little weak. Still good, but not a stand out brew in this style."
"M: Very light! If you like chocolate, hops, and Imperial Stouts are too much for you, this is the beer you're looking for."
"Very well constructed."
"Pours a really, really deep brown that is bordering on black with a bit of a mocha head that fairly quickly recedes into nothing. The nose is fairly one dimensional with a lot of coffee, but that's fine by me as it is quite nicely presented. The taste is overloads of coffee along with a bit of roast and a nice creaminess. Smooth mouthfeel with good carbonation, accentuating the coffee flavor. A really nice coffee stout."
"Pours jet black with a dark tan head. In the aroma, coffee and roasted malt, with a small oatmeal sweetness. In the taste, dry coffee, roasty malt and a sweetness that almost reminds me of lactose. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry coffee aftertaste. Nice coffee presence and interesting sweetness."
"Quite dark, seems more brown than black at first glance. Coppery edges. Dark brown cap, sort of thin and fine with a rockier collar. Sticky lacing, but not a lot of it. Smells of caramel, toffee, molasses, quite sweet, light roast, charcoal, chocolate, with some leafy hops. Solid bitterness throughout, growing into a lingering finish. Sweet and malty too, caramel and toffee, milk and bittersweet chocolate, roasty but not overly so. Hop flavour broke up the sweetness somewhat, adding some diversity in flavour and providing balance. Mild alcohol warmth in the finish. Quite thick and palate coating, lowish carbonation, creamy texture with just a hint of astringency. Pretty good overall. While there's definitely some roast, I didn't find it overpowering for a coffee beer. I'd certainly have it again."
"Poured into a pint glass. As I've mentioned before in previous review, I generally give aggressive pours. This one pours pitch black with not even a shred of head to be found. This looks like a glass of flat cola. Hopefully, it get better. The aroma is near non-existent. Light coffee and that's about it. Not much to be found so far on this one. The taste is pretty one dimensional as well, charred coffee and faint hints of sweet chocolate. The mouthfeel is really the best thing about this for me. It's silky and full bodied with just right carbonation. Not the best I've had from Troegs. I'll finish this one, but I'm less than impressed."
"D- This is a good beer. Hell, it could have been a great beer. If someone wants something with coffee in it, I'd send this their way any day. Alcohol plays out nice. Flavors, bouquet, and appearance all leave me happy. If only it felt better."
"Thin to medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Glad I picked up a 6-pack as this is one enjoyable beer! Good job Troegs!"
"This was a good oatmeal stout, the flavor is pretty much what you would expect, very balanced. This was unusually very easy to drink, not as filling as I had thought."
"The alcohol is suuuper well hidden. If it weren't for the kinda strange aftertaste this would have scored higher."
"On tap at the Yardhouse in Dedham. Served in a standard pint glass. Dark brown color. Thin white head. Smell had a faint hint of coffee. Taste was put together well. Lots of flavor of chocolate and espresso, plus the added roasted taste that you often find in an oatmeal stout. Mouthfeel was a bit on the thin side for a stout though. Not watery, but would have loved it to be thicker. Drinkability was good as it was smooth and the 7.5% abv was not really detectable. A decent version of the style, and a good way to start the night."
"M/D- Smooth, and a little prickly. Nice mouthfeel. Fairly drinkable, but I'd eventually get a little tired of the earthiness."
"Mouthfeel is Medium bodied and oily with a low level of carbonation."
"D: A drinkable oatmeal stout."
"D: A bit of a mixed bag. Not sure I'd want to drink too many of these."
"All in all, this brew started great but ended poorly. Not really worth going out of your way for. Maybe try once if you like stouts, but only if you have access."
"T- The hops dominate the taste too. Which is a disappointment to me. Lots of sweet citrus and bittering herbal hops. Coffee is second and its not that great. Its kinda like an acidic, cold cup of coffee. There is a nice bit of chocolate that sweetens things up and brings the taste to a balance."
"This one is average in body for the style, somewhat thick but not really viscous, but it is smooth overall with high carbonation for a stout. Overall a nice mild stout that was just what the doctor ordered after the first chilly, rainy day of fall."
"Easy to drink, I just wish most aspects of this brew were more ""in your face", instead of unfortunately somewhat hidden."
"I've actually had this once before, out of a 12oz bottle. I felt like the coffee was much more pronounced there, but the difference (older bomber, maybe) made for a really interesting beer. Quite enjoyable."
"D: I find this brew to be quite drinkable for the style, the ABV is hidden well and besides the lack of coffee throughout, this is a well rounded stout."
"Solid coffee oatmeal stout, but far from the best. Definitely best served only lightly chilled, as I served it at 55-60F, yet continued to improve as it warmed up beyond that temp. I could see a fresher sample being more intense on the coffee and hops front..."
"You know, cuz you're a lonely guy reviewing beers on here. What else are you doing?"
"I had a very fresh bomber last time and that had more coffee and hop flavor to it as well."
"Good coffee stout. I'd put this in the better half of coffee stouts that I've tried. It has a great aroma full of both dark, roasty malt and strong, rich coffee. The malt has a lot of chocolate, too, which works well with the coffee. The taste is a bit dominated by the coffee flavor, but it's still solid. Starts nice and sweet and finishes dry and bitter. I would guess that this isn't the most caffeine-packed variety of coffee stout, which I appreciate. Mouthfeel is thinner than expected, since the recipe is based on an oatmeal stout. This beer just needs a bit more creaminess to show off the flavor to its full potential. More of the fruitier coffee notes and chocolatey malt would come out with a fuller feel. The beer is almost wall-to-wall black. The sides just barely glow with dark brown. Very good beer and one of the easier to drink coffee stouts that I've tried."
"The drinkabilty suffers a bit due to the bad mouthfeel."
"Overall, this is a very nice oatmeal stout that offers a slightly different spin, which is a good thing. Very drinkable and easy going. If you enjoy the style, this is absolutely a caseworthy brew."
"D: Better than most impy(semi-impy) stouts for me. I can nearly session this one."
"Notes: Not super impressed with this one. I want more body from a coffee stout."
"D: The 7.5% was well hidden."
"Heavy and creamy but not syrupy. Dense but not burdening on the palate. Airy, fine textured carbonation with a semi-dry finish. I wouldn't have called an oatmeal stout necessarily. Certainly not the most drinkable one I've had (oatmeal stout that is) but I suppose I could put back a few relatively easily. Overall, a quality, very enjoyable brew."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, there are certainly several other beers in the style that I would pick first."
" The coffee flavor hits in the back of the mouth and is smoothed over by chocolate goodness; then, it finnishes with a slight piney bitterness that keeps you coming back for more. A delightful brew and extremely drinkable."
"I poured into a pint glass to a half inch of tan head. This beer is dark brown/black in color. The aroma is dark, roasted malt with rich coffee. The taste is very much the same as the smell. It has roasted chocolate malts up front with a coffee finish that seems to linger on the palate. The mouthfeel is medium, a bit thin for me, but this is a good tasting beer. I could go for another."
"D: 7.5 ABV? I didn't even notice. I like the flavor, texture, and just about everything about this beer. I'll buy this again!"
"overall: not the best coffee stout I have had its very bitter and not that easy to drink, note to brewers if your doing a coffee stout tone down the IBUs cuz coffee is bitter."
"D: I'm such a happy camper! A unique oat stout, in my opinion."
"This is not the most interesting stout, but not bad. Worth a try or two."
"(LATE EDIT)- I keep thinking about what this beer has done in terms of smoothness for it's abv, and it's DAM^ impressive! THis is the easist drinkin 7.5 you'll ever sink your teeth into."
"D= too dense and filling for more than a few, but even one is a great treat at a time."
"Pours so dark that it only permits the smallest glints of brown to show on the edges when held up to the light. h as a sticky brown head that generously laces the top of the glass. The espresso aromas are definitely there, but they're not prominent. Delicious smells of dark chocolate steal the show. As far as taste is concerned, this Java Head has the sweetness of a milk stout but is remarkably well balanced by strong roasty notes and rich coffee flavors. The weight and feel are watery and weak, but the flavor is no joke. This is a very tasty beer."
"Drinkability - Refreshing, consistent. Great addition to the Troegs line and I am sure to purchase a few bombers for the cellar."
"D - Truely exceptional. $5.99 for a bomber! Nice 1.5 hour session beer that won't leave you bloated."
"Overall, just run of the mill. Flawed and overstyled, nothing I'd want to have in succession. Not horrible, but really a hodge-podge of flavors."
"Typical dark brown color. Minimal head with no lacing. A bit thinner then I'd like. Aroma is mostly just malts - not really picking up any coffee. Flavor is very much the same, and while that flavor is good, I was really expecting more coffee to come through - as it is I'm not picking much up here at all. Glad I tried it, but not seeking it out again really."
"Id call it a breakfast beer."
"Drinkability -- This beer escapes the pitfall of many other coffee stouts in that it keeps the coffee flavor sharp and doesn't drink like like a boozy frappuccino. The body is a bit thin, especially for an oatmeal stout, but overall it's quite a drinkable offering. If you like your coffee black, this will suit you just fine!"
"A dark brown-black pour with a great caramel head that quickly fades with minimal lacing. The nose is all roasted malt and coffee with a hint of chocolate. The taste is much the same. It had a wierd aftertaste at first but quickly faded. It keeps the roasty flavor without getting too sweet like some of this style. Definitely got better as it warmed up. Just enough bitterness but very smooth and drinkable. The slightly elevated alcohol was well hidden. Drinkability was good for the ABV."
"Notes: Maybe not remarkable in any of its characteristics but as a whole it works pretty well and it is well above average."
"Yet another awesome cask offering down at the CK. It pours a straight obsidian topped by a minor ring of large tan suds. The nose comprises roasted malts, coffee, caramel, chocolate, and some slight oak and vanilla notes. The taste follows in lock-step, adding molasses and a slight bitterness from the coffee to the proceedings. The body is a hefty medium, with pretty much no carbonation (shocker!) and a fairly viscous feel. I gotta say, it's better on cask than from the bottle. Tasty shit, people. Get some!"
"Notes-Well, this doesn't come anywhere close to Peche' Mortel which I feel is the paragon of all coffee stouts; this is mid-tier at best."
"Drinks: unremarkably. I consider myself an aesthete of coffee stouts, and having tried many, I'd say Java Head is nowhere near the top of the totem pole."
"Decent beer, but plainly not what Troegs intended. I often leave my coffee beers for a bit to leaven the coffee a bit - I like it evident but not overbearing - but this clearly might be better off fresh."
"This one is okay but I wish I had, had my girlfriend bring me something else back from vacation."
"D: Pretty easy to drink and nice flavors, but I was really hoping for more coffee aroma and flavor."
"Overall: really tasty and easy to drink a few with the ABV being 7.5. Really wish they would amp up the coffee."
"The 7.50%abv is hidden, very well. The flavor profile is rich and bold, yet not overly so. This is an easy drinking beer, if you enjoy stouts and/or coffee."
"Notes: Saw this in 22 oz. bombers for a while so it was good to find it in a 12 oz. single at Save-On since I just wanted to sample it. Come to think of it, I am sure that the price on the 22 oz. bomber is more than twice that of this 12 oz., or $3.70 so it was a good value as well!"
"The coffee comes out a bit more in the flavor, but it is a little astringent...luckily there is plenty of lactose-esque sweetness to counterbalance. It lacks the velvety smoothness that many of the best oatmeal stouts display, but that seems like it would be hard to achieve both a strong coffee presence and still have the smooth characteristics from the oats. This one drinks better at higher temperatures, some hops and marshmallow sweetness blend in nicely. Bitter roast lingers too long after the sip, not unlike a long visit from the in-laws. One of the better values for a coffee stout, but there are a plethora of tastier ones out there."
"I bought a six pack of this on vacation, after drinking a few I wish I would have bought a second six pack, it's hard to find here. very good beer."
"Bottle pours deep dark brownish to black with a very thin almost non-existant tan head (even with a heavy pour). Aroma is as expected with rich roasted malts, coffee, and a touch of licorice aroma. The flavor is less then amazing, but pretty good. Heavy on the roasted malt flavor followed by the coffee flavors with a lingering after taste of chocolate and caramel. Kinda rich and heavy with low carbonation, could still feel a little thicker for what it is. I tend to think these coffee stouts are all about the same level of drinkable. You wouldn't want to down a bunch of them, but one or two is ok. All in all a tasty beer."
"O: Would I buy it again? I probably would if I was at the brewery again. Recommend it? Yes, this was pretty good. Worth the price? A growler fill was about $10, so $2.50 a pint or $1.78 a 12oz. Not the best price, but not outrageous. Iffy. Search it out? I'd go to the brewery again- the beer was good, it was a neat set-up, and the best looking sampler tray I'v ever seen."
"D: Good drinkability for a stout; flavor and mouthfeel are working in unison fairly well. For the most part, my expectations were met. I'd probably have this again."
"D: You need to take your time drinking this beer given the amount of dryness and bitterness."
"D- It was just ok. Easy drinking but Id much rather grab a wake 'n bake."
"D- A very good session beer. I enjoyed this one while watching the Celtics in the post season. Fit perfectly in the evening and the experience."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium thick and the finish is full. This beer is very unique, it doesn't have the flavors of a strong oatmeal stout. The coffee flavor lends to a unique profile to the beer taste like on the palate. The oatmeal cuts the strong coffee flavor but only in half. I was hoping for more a smoother flavor in an oatmeal stout."
"D: really enjoyed the java head and had bourbon notes that made it more intresting and complex. Drank well and would love to get more of. This dark dank."
"D - This is a really disappointing coffee stout. It's lacking in just about every regard. The coffee needs serious bringing out but it's a decent starting point."
"This is a very tasty, very sesisonable, very good stout. Damn fine stuff, and at 7.5% it goes down way easy. Very impressive stuff. This is a new ""case worty"" favorite for me."
"Thanks Adam!"
"I liked this more than I expected I would and will be seeking out some more in a future trade. This falls squarely into my underrated category and will be a must try recommendation to anyone with access to it. I'm guessing this is about 8-9 months old and is drinking amazingly well! I suggest you serve it cold. As it warms up it becomes more complex and showcases different attributes. The wide range from cold to room temperature is an experience to be savored. Great job Troegs!"
"D - It's very sessionable so I give it a decent mark here. It is not a nugget nectar so i am a tad disappointed that this flavor isn't a bit more pronounced.. but this is good.. i wouldn't seek it out but i drank the three i have no problem.. if you are a beginner or you just like stuff not so heavy on the palate then i believe you will love this.."
"Overall rather dissapointing. I had high hopes for this one. It turned out to be a less then memorable beer. I do have another bottle so I will edit my review if I feel the need."
"D) A delicious stout. Wow. Like liquid chocolate ice cream."
"I drank this from a 12oz bottle into my Orval glass...The beer is black with a small but nice thick and foamy head, good lacing, really nice...The aroma is super light, a little coffee a little sweet, wish it was much strong...The taste is also super light, a little sweet coffee...The feel is light and watery but makes its super easy to drink...Its ok, easy to drink, but just not super flavorful. I guess you can say its a crushable porter, not a full oatmeal."
"D- Fairly drinkable. I'm a big stout fan and this beer lies in the middle of the road as far as what I have had... Not amazing, but still good!"
"Always look forward to try a different offering from Troeggs. This perhaps is not the best offering from there impressive line-up. However worth a try"
"This is, however, quite drinkable. Perhaps not for an entire evening, but one that will last a few bottles before moving on."
"D - Gets a little sweet after a while, especially since I have a bomber of this to go through. Otherwise, the flavour profile is very enjoyable."
"Pours a black color with two fingers of tan head that fades slowly with chunky lacing. I'd almost say the hops are more pronounced in the aroma than the coffee, which hangs around in the back behind a nice floral hop aroma and hints of roasted malt and chocolate. The taste starts out without a lot of influence from the coffee, just a nice, dry, malty stout flavor, but then shows up big time on the finish. Coffee, dark chocolate and strong bitterness on the finish, but it actually goes out pretty clean. Body is medium, drinkability is good. This beer is a nice, balanced stout and I was pleasantly surprised since I was expecting the coffee to be more pronounced."
"D: ABV completely masked, and it leaves a nice sticky, foamy lace down the glass as I imbibe. As it gets to about room temperature it becomes more complex, but more watery, so better, but barely so."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. It has a lot of pine and coffee flavor to it, and its a very good stout."
"TrÃ¶egs Java Head is a solid black beer with a thin, dense, light brown head that leaves solid sheets of lacing. It has a roasty, almost ashy, aroma with notes of coffee and pine. It's medium bodied and incredibly smooth, with a light, graceful finish. It's nice and roasty and well balanced with a light sweetness and a resiny bitterness. There are notes of ultra roast coffee and licorice. This is great. It's really tasty, pretty complex and very drinkable. It's very similar to Victory and Weyerbacher imperial stouts-- clearly of the Pennsylvania pursuasion."
"D- Good, I polished off a bomber of this easily. Very smooth and easily drinkable along with a mid-range ABV."
"22 oz. bottle. Pours a completely opaque dark brown, with a good sized fluffy light brown head, good lacing throughout. Aroma is sweet and roasted malts, cocoa, coffee, oats, and some floral hops. Flavor is roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee,burnt and lots of earthy bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium, creamy, and lots of coffee bitterness that lingers at the end. Good beer, nice balance, although I didn't expect this much bitterness."
"Poured with a nice head, looks good. Definitely has the slight sea foam stout look to it. scents of dark black coffee and grapefruity hops can be detected but it smells weaker than expected. Tastes a little weaker too... The bitter, puckering black coffee flavor is obvious, but otherwise a pretty standard oatmeal stout. Its good, not my favorite. I enjoy it, but it falls a bit short on the coffee taste- its there but its not as full as I was hoping. A good, bitter stout made with coffee overall. The mouthfeel is a bit drying - from the coffee maybe? Or possibly the hops. I'd have another, but I feel like if the coffee flavor was stronger I'd love it."
"Overall I was slightly disappointed with Java Head. One thing that I took note of was the 7.5 abv...I would have had this pegged at about 5% given the way it feels and drinks. This isn't a bad beer by any strech of the imagination, but given some of the amazing beers in this segment, Java Head just gets lost in the shuffle. For comparisons sake, I'm going to make it a point to try this beer on tap the next time I have an opportunity. Worth a try, but don't go out of your way to grab one."
"I have had this on-tap at the brewery and loved it. Bottled is good as well and I would have it again absolutely."
"D/O - A well crafted, Coffee laced Oatmeal Stout from the bros in H-Burg. It's worth a try, but I don't really see myself drinking this beer again anytime soon. Nothing really jumps out at me when I'm drinking this beer. A good TrÃ¶egs brew, but not a great TrÃ¶egs brew. Bring back the original Oatmeal Stout. Cheers."
"D: Java Head is a solid example of this style. A bit lighter than others, it's a great beer for people getting into coffee stouts. It's a beer that I will seek out again in the future."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable. The 7.5 percent ABV doesn't hamper drinkability at all. Overall, another great brew from Troegs."
"Overall, quite enjoyable for any fan of dark toast stouts and/or coffee lovers."
"Flavor is pretty plain. There's a mild coffee, or roasted coffee bean taste...but again, pretty well hidden. I am a little let down from Troegs on this one. There's a little more flavor at room temp, but still a pretty average coffee stout flavor. I expected a little bit more flavor. Light mouthfeel, high carbonation. An ok beer, a decent coffee stout...but not Troegs best."
"taste is a lot like a homebrew. Not bad but very meh. It's a sharp but it has a really nce mouthfeel that's very rich and fll bt again not as smooth a I'd like."
"D- This beer is pretty drinkable.It's not spectacular, but enjoyable and I'm glad I tried it."
"It is very tasty but is very mainstream and average. A must try but not overwhelming."
"Huge, frothy head, deep tan in color with a great deal of larger, more delicate bubbles which helps it dissolve at a steady pace, almost milkshake like in appearance, rings of sticky lacing cling behind. Typical pitch black liquid, does offer a hint of orange coloration at the outermost edges. Very user friendly nose of cocoa powder, chocolate covered raisins, toffee, plum and cherry fruit, oatmeal and cinnamon, the roast to the coffee really not that high, brush of floral notes but the hops presence is negligible. Full-bodied, creamy but not necessarily soft, more as if the carbonation whipped like fresh cream. Stronger roast here, dries out the overall mouth texture. Coffee, vanilla powder, cocoa powder, butterscotch, mixed nuts, lower level of cherry, raisin, fig, apricot fruit. Pinch of baking spices but insufficient to sweeten things much. Could use a little more length at the end."
"D: Another respectable brew from Troegs. The beer's flavor is as advertised and fairly tasty. The thinnish mouthfeel takes away some drinkability and would make me think twice before having another one of these, though. But it's by no means a bad brew - definitely something good to try."
"Pours a deep brown with a nice tan head, and leaves quality lacing on the glass. The aroma has some nice chocolate and coffee notes upfront, along with some citrusy hops, dark fruits, heavy cream and some burnt bread. The taste has a big roasted malt character initially with big coffee and chocolate flavors, along with some mild dark fruits (fig and plum), a mineral like flavor, sweet cream, oatmeal and a big, juicy hoppiness at the end that is reminiscent of grapefruit and pine. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light for the style but it's not unwelcome considering the time of year. Overall this is a very solid coffee stout, with an interesting twist (the dry hopping)...I would definitely buy this again if it were available in these parts."
"I was so glad to hear that Troegs was bringing back a stout based on their oatmeal stout. This is now available in 12oz cases year round I believe, which absolutely rocks!"
"There should be more of a noticeable coffee flavor. That's not to say I can't taste it, it's just that the ""java"" bit is this beer's most compelling characteristic and, except for the appearance, it's rather lackluster. Moderately drinkable, but a bit strong and not that balanced."
"D - Moderately drinkable. It's full and kind of dull tasting but it's refreshing at the same time. Might like to get this one again."
"Oatmeal stouts are not my favorite but I have been trying a lot lately unfortunately. Seems to be a style that many make but that I never seek out. Dry finish and medium mouthfeel and carbonation."
"Pours a very dark brown color with a medium sized brown head. Loads of hops in the nose, way more than i was expecting but it works. Im not sure if this beer is just crazy fresh of what but im not picking up on as much coffee flavor here as one would think, its roasty, its got some coffee bitterness but overall this one is pretty hop dominant right now. A strange offering in the style, but a very enjoyable beer for sure."
"D- once again really wanted to like this beer but it was very average at best in the taste and nose. Really a bummer to get such an average product from one of my favorite brewers."
"D- java head is a good oatmeal stout that combines a coffee lovers experience. The brew is filling, so a bomber is enough for me. Again, I was hoping a stronger coffee presence... but this is still a great drink"
"Medium body. There is a nice creamy, almost silky feel to this beer that adds some character. Alcohol is pretty well hidden. Carbonation is on the lower end, which fits well. Overall, a good beer, but I would have expected a bit more coffee character given the name."
"D: Quite nice. Smooth and easy to drink. Troeg's kept the bitterness of the coffee in check for the most part, so this doesn't have some of that unwelcome harshness of some coffee porters/stouts. Would enjoy again."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a small head. Smell is virtually non existent. Maybe a slight hint of coffee. Taste is of coffee with some notes of chocolate, finishing bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a fairly decent beer."
"D-this is a good drinking stout, not as much coffee as I thought it might have; but still a good oatmeal stout!"
"D - very easy to drink, not over the top flavors, very smooth, a little lacking in flavor, but overall enjoyable"
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Straight black with a barely there tan head that quickly dissipates. Smell is wonderful, tons of coffee with a hint of chocolate...chocolate smells lighter than usual for a stout, maybe of the milk variety. Taste is STRONGLY of coffee with hardly any chocolate coming through. The coffee almost tastes sweet after a couple of sips, and the chocolate starts to come through a little more. It takes awhile to get used to, but its a rather nice stout."
" I have no problem downing a bomber of this stout, drinking 2 would be a challenge. The new release of the 12 oz bottles it may be more drinkable being less a limited supply and less than a 22 oz commitment."
"Java Head is an interesting beer. It's good, but seems quite a ways away from great. One of its biggest problems is its light body. It's too thin and holds it back. The flavor's good, but would improve with a stronger chocolate malt presence. As it is, it's barely sturdy enough to support the coffee heavy flavor. Ultimately, my love for coffee carries the day here. This beer works for me, but I can see where it may not for others."
"Not bad, I am generally not a fan of coffee stouts, or coffee in general so I am already biased against this beer. However, I liked it more than my pre-conceived notions indicated..."
"The taste has firm bitterness contributed both by grassy/citrusy hops and roasted beans. Kind of like a chocolate bar you get with bits of orange peel in it. Some cocoa and java chips. Medium bodied and a good substance to it, low carbonation - could've been a little thicker, but the weight of it helps the drinkability and makes it a little more approachable. I really like the 7.5% ABV point for splitting a bomber between two people. This beer is kind of like a poor man's darkness in the way the hoppiness works with the base stout. A shadow of darkness though, as far as intensity goes. Although this is by no means a bad beer, I would vote to lose this brew from their portfolio and bring back the Scratch 15 beer in 6pk form."
"Glad I tried it, could be part of a regular rotation if it was local and reasonably priced. Probably would be better on draft. More of a standard oatmeal stout than a coffee stout."
"Dark brown color, very dark brown head. Decent dark malt aroma and flavor but, again, not as much coffee as I had hoped for. I would recommend but there are several others I prefer."
"very drinkable for its strength with good complexity. i would drink this beer often. thumbs up"
"i'm editing my review as the beer is now offered year round in 12 oz bottles and at a competitive price. perhaps i now have a better attitude, but the beer tastes a tad better this time around. very similar to the old oatmeal stout, only with a touch of coffee. this is a solid stout worthy of a taste."
"D: Cold it was all about bitterness -- from both the coffee and the hops. But as it warmed it improved, with the bitter chocolate becoming sweeter and that initial lingering bitterness tapering off a little in the aftertaste. A decent coffee stout; I'd get it again but drink it closer to cellar temperature next time."
"A really nice beer, the coffee is definitely present without being too overwealming. That said, there is an almost bitter or acrid component that;s either coming from the hops or the coffee that is unpleasant. Not overly sweet for an oatmeal stout, but pretty solid as an American stout."
"Pours very dark with a large mocha colored head that had great retention before settling to a thick cap. Large amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. It sure is a looker. Not very aromatic but I detect hints of cocoa and citrus fruit. Also a little sugar and grain. The flavor features a lot of citrus hops and cocoa. Complimenting those flavors are some roasted malt, toffee, and lastly, some coffee. Bitterness is moderate coming from both the hops and burnt malt. I would of liked a little bit more in the body as it is an Oatmeal stout. It feels a little thin and lacks the silky texture of the greats of the style. I was expecting more coffee in this beer, but it has nice stout flavor. Maybe they should call this Troegs Chocolate Java Stout.."
"D - very drinkable dispite the ""heaviness"" and I could easily finish more than just the one bomber."
"Drinkability-Absolutly didn't like/the after tast stuck with it and didn't wash away/will never drink this again"
"Give me another!"
"Great smooth mouthfeel (thanks oats) and a nice medium body. ABV is stepped up for this style, but it is perfectly done to compliment the other attributes of this beer. A nicely done beer that I will surely seek out again."
"Black in color with a thick tan head with a mixture of delicate bubbles and big soapy bubbles. Pretty nice retention and good bits of lacing evident. The aroma has a pleasant coffee bean character that mixes well with toasty malts, floral and earthy hops, and vanilla. Tastes of toasty and toffee malts, chocolate, some mild raisin and lower than expected java. Slightly spicy on th midpalate and a nice rich toasty and floral finish. What a nice beer. Rich in body with slippery oatmeal evident, carbonation hits the target as well at a low-mid level and creamy feeling. What a great oatmeal stout, the java is there but it is a nuance instead of a commanding aspect of the beer. Rich but mellow, smooth, relaxing beer."
"D- Definitely not over-the-top like some chocolate or coffee stouts and despite the 7.5% abv, this one went down far too quickly. Must find more!"
"Pretty drinkable. A unique combination of flavors that works for me!"
"Drinkability n As this brew tastes okay, but not strong, one should be able to drink a few glasses no problem. However, there are better options out there."
"Future outlook: Not the best I've had from TrÃ¶egs, but still quite solid. Maybe not a ""seek out"" beer for the future, but one that I'd still welcome back."
"D: A big, coffee-infused, hoppy oatmeal stout? Yes, please. Props to Troegs for using a coffee blend from a locally-owned coffee shop in Linglestown. It's nice to see local companies sticking together and producing an excellent product. Achieves an impressive balance of coffee flavors, roastiness, sweetness, and hoppiness that scores this beer points in my book."
"Java Head is good beer through and through. It's still a shame that Troegs killed Oatmeal Stout, because it was just as delicious and had the not insignificant advantage of being a year-round release. Thanks to jwc215 for the bottle."
" This one goes down pretty easily as the alcohol can hardly be felt, as well. While this is a good beer to have during the colder months, I couldn't help but feel that this was just a bit disappointing. If it had more of a mouthfeel and thickness of an Oatmeal Stout, I think this would rate much higher. That being said, it's not a bad effort for their first bomber and I still think very highly of Troegs!"
"This brew poured to a deep black color with a thick dark tan head that had good retention and lacing. The aroma of this brew is dark malts, some coffee and a slight hint of hops. Based on the write up I was expecting much more in the way of both hops and coffee aroma, they where there but not overly dominate, it is the heavily roasted and burn malt that comes through. The flavor is very good for a nice oatmeal stout, the 7.5% ABV is completely hidden IMO. The malts really come out here with some nice chocolate/cocoa flavors. Now as in the aroma the coffee and hop flavor, while there, do not stick out. I know that the Troegs webpage states that this is a September seasonal release so possibly the hops and coffee flavors have mellowed out. Has a nice dry finish with ample carbonation. Now, let me say that this brew is very good, but for me does not stand out with the lack of coffee and hop flavors, would not mind seeing it in the mixed 12 pack but as for a standalone beer just does not cut it IMO."
"I did finish the bomber with no problems but I have had better coffee brews"
"It was purchased in a case of 12, 24 oz bottles and of those there reamins 3, one of which I'm trying as I write. For the price there are better stouts out there. They should brew this in 12 oz. bottle for a variety pack; its not terrible, just not the best. Maybe a hoppy stout isn't for me."
"Pours a rather opaque chocolate brown, with a Guinness-tan creamy head and persistent lacing. Aroma is what you would expect, invitingly malty with coffee notes and a hint of yeastiness. Hits the tongue like both a good dark stout and a great cup of coffee--that's the best way to describe it. Mix your favorite beer and your favorite coffee in the best possible way, and this is it. Stays on the tongue hauntingly dry, but more so like the tannins in an espresso shot than hoppy resins (again, a good thing). Excels in drinkability for the style--creamy enough to satisfy, but surprisingly light considering. An excellent selection this season, and one I hope the Bros. Trogner continue to improve on."
"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy tan head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some chocolate/coffee notes. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, with a very nice touch of chocolate/coffee. Medium body, this is a nice smooth brew. Drinkable, a nice one."
"While certainly drinkable, I've had much better coffee stouts. I find the hops a bit heavy and compete to much with the roast bitterness that should be there to compliment the coffee flavors. Maybe with some age..."
"Pours black with a big khaki colored head. Great hop bitterness with a smooth oatmeal stout mouthfeel and a decent black coffee bitterness. Without looking I'm not aware of the ABV. Its highly drinkable though and tasty. Troegs has always been a great brewery but I'm always a little gun shy about their new beers, and while this may not be new its new to me and it was worth the price of the bomber. I dig it and I'd drink it again."
"Drinkability - very good, I would highly recommend trying it."
"A middle of the road stout, I wish it highlighted the specialty ingredients more, but it's a good stout that I would drink again. It would be more drinkable with a lower gravity, I know pick pick pick. Cheers!"
"D: I find this beer to be... so-so. To be honest, I was excited to find this in a store and may have hyped it up a little too much. Certainly nothing to write home about"
"Drinkability is pretty high. I got through the bomber surprisingly fast."
"22 ounce bottle, bottled on 9/10/2009. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with a 2 inch frothy tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's some citrusy hops noticable too, mostly in the finish. However, for this being a coffee stout the coffee isn't strong in the flavor or aroma. For a beer called Java Head I expected a lot more coffee flavor. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is decent, it's smooth and goes down easy. The alcohol in this brew is well hidden. I think this is a good enough beer and would buy it again in the future, but since I was expecting more coffee in this brew I have to say I was a bit disappointed with it."
"A damn tasty coffee stout. Highly recommended."
"Overall impression: Worth a try, but not something I'd seek out"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a dark opaque brown with a thick 2 finger light brown foamy head. Aroma was slightly akin to cold coffee with a touch of mocha. Taste was slightly mocha flavored, smooth like a blended coffee drink. Coated extremely well inside the mouth, carbonation was a touch strong, but not overwhelming. Very pleasant to drink, a solid stout with very smooth coffee undertones."
"Pretty interesting, but I think that the coffee character is quite muted for a beer that highlights coffee as an ingredient."
"D- though not a stop-you-in-your-tracks beer it is quite drinkable, absolutely no hints to the ABV"
"OVERALL Smooth, balanced, flavorful and easy drinking for a big beer."
"Overall, a slightly above average stout. A little too one dimensional, but it will certainly satisfy the coffee lovers."
"This is quite drinkable and the 7.50% alcohol is well-hidden. A very nice stout."
"Drink is good. A different tasting stout to me with that heavier citrus and coffee ending. Very drinkable and very crafty."
"This a good hoppy coffee stout. The hops aren't to over the edge and blend quite well with the stout flavors. The only issue I can see some having with this is that the coffee flavors aren't that strong. But I rather like the subtleties of this beer. All and all, another delicious brew from Troegs."
"Reviewed on 10/4/2009. Bottle. Pours black with a small tan head. Aroma of sweet roasted malt, light coffee, vanilla. Flavor of bitter roasted malt, bitter chocolate, and some light coffee grounds in the finish. I'd like to get some more java from this java stout. Overall, an ok stout."
"Overall I hate beer markups. This no impart reflects the score of the beer but Bocktown sold me this bomber for 10.00 at 25 percent off with tax. At about 7.25 it is an ok beer but when I saw it for 5.50 at my local beer place I was pissed."
"Dr. Easy going."
"Pitch black colored beer with a rich slowly fading head.Aroma is faint cocoa.Taste is coffee beans,cocoa,sugar cane and cream.The flavors are light but pretty good.It is smooth going down like most oatmeal stouts.Overall I like it and would recommend to try at least one time."
"OK beer, nothing spectacular."
"I know it sounds like I have nothing good to say about it, it's not horrible, just boring. BLAND."
"I like that this beer's flavor ingredients (coffee and hops) are pressed into the liquid French press-style (my preferred coffee-making method). Java Head does fine in its attempt to offer something new to the coffee stout thing with its firm hop presence, but it's not a gold medal winner either. Perhaps the experience is tainted since I'm coming off recent experiences with Southern Tier's Jahva and Mokah, and those are freaking mindblowing, whereas Java Head is not."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with good carbonation. Malt body is solid without being too heavy, making this one quite easy to put away. Overall, this ends up being more a hopped up oatmeal stout to me than a coffee oatmeal stout. I would have liked a stronger more vibrant coffee presence for a brew named Java Head....maybe Hop Java Head??"
"Poured from a bomber bottle into a Imp. Pint Glass. Dark like molasses pour with a couple inch thick coffee colored head. It almost looks like espresso in my glass. Scent of heavy coffee and alcohol not hidden at all. Open cocoa, coffee, malt flavors right from the first sip. Coffee is the lingering after taste. Burnt malts and nuts also. Lighter than expected mouthfeel almost some what watery for the color. I have only had this brew out of bombers so drinkability might be some what limited."
"A: Hefty head on a hard pour, a solid 2.5 inches of thick sticky cream, the head drops to reveal a spider web of spotty lacing along the edge of the glass, dark to almost pitch-black color - 4.50, S: As the name implies the nose has tons of roasted coffee, quite earthy and with a touch of charring, aroma is quite dry - 4.00, T: Coffee plays a big part in the palate, somewhat of a dry grainy flavor, noticeable hop bite, ashy with the slightest bit of smokiness, smidgeon of sweetness in the depths of this beer - 3.00, M: A bit on the grainy side, otherwise a medium to heavy body - 3.75, D: Overall an enjoyable beer, it didn't knock my socks off but I would drink it again - 3.25"
"To me, coffee bears are a ""dime a dozen"" these days and this one stands out from the rest."
"D - Very tasty beer. Not too much coffee -- would've assumed the coffee I was tasting came from the malt. Maybe could use a bit more sweetness from crystal. A rough aftertaste."
"I wouldn't recommend this."
"Overall, I wish they made the coffee/java flavors & aroma a bit stronger. A nice tasting stout, but it won't give you that caffeine fix if that's what you were expecting."
"Pours a near black color with a huge frothy light brown head that left a wall of lacing as it dissipated. Some yeasties floating about. The aroma is of roasted malt, toasted bread, and light metal. Not very strong and I didn't really pick up any coffee aromas. The taste has roasted malt flavor with stale coffee, wet burnt wood, very light toffee and has a hint of lemony sourness. The initial feel is quite light and almost watery, towards the finish it seems to thicken a bit; semi-soft carbonation. Sweet yet finishes with a roasted malt bitterness. A fairly average coffee stout, definitely on the lighter end of the spectrum. The back end bitterness doesn't seem to be warranted with the flavor profile. It's enjoyable but I probably won't purchase again."
"Over all impression was it tasted like Newcastle poured through a stale coffee filter."
"Honestly, this is one of the blandest beers I've ever had. It's not terrible, it's not really anything. It doesn't have a strong coffee quality. It doesn't have a strong stout quality. If anything it reminds me of a really bland English brown. I thought that maybe it doesn't age well, but it's only 3 months old--max."
"Tastes more dark than the smell. Far more bitter--burnt toast and background hop. It's thinner than I like, particularly for an oatmeal stout. The aftertaste is similar to mocha. Put it together, a nice complexity."
"Drinkability: No hint of booze in this one, though it's not particularly high to begin with so that's not too surprising. Not - by any stretch - the best Troegs beer, though a solid addition to their bomber lineup, and one I'd be happy to have again at some point."
"Overall, this bomber was a cake walk. Very easy drinking with a lot of flavor. I really enjoyed how well the earthy hops and coffee mixed together. Very drinkable."
"Another solid beer by Troegs that I could see myself drinking again and even a couple of bottles in a session."
"Drinkability- Overall not too shabby. I could use a bit more body, a bit more coffee and a bit less hops. It's definitely tasty BUT, I've been drinking A LOT of Bell's Java Stout in the last week and it's amazing. Either way, enjoyed this, I'm just a negative Nancy this morning. Thanks Adam!"
"Overall, average, common coffee-style stout. Nothing that stands out."
"D: Decent drinkability though lacked heart, a robust nature, and a wow factor. This could of easily been delivered in six pack form, as when packaged in a single bomber with a moderate pricetag you expect a bigger more special beer. Recommend for a try, though i think it fell short of being good in most regards."
"Super deep russet brown, head is the color of coffee with cream, made up of super dense bubbles, about a half inch tall. The lace sticks like crazy. The aroma is muted, kinda homebrewy, that fruity-yeasty smell. Perhaps it's too cool, letting it warm... Nothing else really comes forward. Digging deeper pulls a little dusty cocoa, but no coffee really. This was bottled on 9.10.09, drank 10.14.10, so nothing in the aroma should have mellowed out by now. Flavor is roasty, a hint of toffee or butterscotch? Thin and kinda winey, with a faintly roast finish, kinda reminds me of coffee but doesn't really scream it like the coffee-bean-pot-skull on the label would suggest. Pretty boozy, not in taste or feel, but definitely leaves my head a bit cloudy. It has an interesting acidity, perhaps from the coffee? Long after, the finish has some nice berry characteristics. Mouthfeel is fine, lightly coating, lingers for a while but not too heavy, good carbonation. Drinks nice and easy at 7.5% but I definitely am feeling it by the end of the bottle."
"Pretty good. I'd recommend giving it a try. I bought my bottle at Wine Warehouse in Charlottesville, VA."
"I'm a huge coffee fan, the more the better. This just doesnt do it for me. Pretty disappointing from a brewery that normally isnt afraid to push the limits."
"D: Very drinkable for the style, but this is a big beer - make no mistake. Definitely worth a try!"
"The citrus is very well balanced. I was really worried with the smell, but its balanace for the beer is great. Pretty amazing brew if you look at all the components that contribyte to its flavor. I can appreciate how folks wont like this interpretation of the style, but on the grounds for what they were shooting for, they have hit the mark."
"This is a decent beer and would drink it again, but there are other stouts out there I would choose first."
"Drinkability: Very pleasant for a stout, but I did not get an overwhelming taste of coffee or oats. Both flavors are very subtle. This one was more refreshing than I have had in this style. I will have it again, but will not rush to do so."
"D- A very interesting stout. I could see drinking this as a sipper due to its big flavor or a session beer due to the freshening/lightening hop profile that is present."
"22oz. bottle served in a standard pint. Poured the color of cola with a cascading, dense, three inch mocha-colored head. Head slowly crackles and recedes leaving behind thick concentric bands of delicate lacing before settling into a solid quarter inch cap. Subdued nose - some lactose, flaked oats and a mocha quality. Taste follows nose; however, the mocha comes out more dominantly in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is creamy, light-medium and a little gassy - a bit on the thin side. Easy drinking, but lacking some of the chewiness I've come to associate with the style. Definitely worth a try - I bet it would be exceptional on nitro."
"Pours a near black color that shows off hues of redish brown along the edges of my pint glass when held up to the light. The color coming through the edges flirt with the notion that if this beer wasn't so dark, it would be fairly clear and crisp looking. Thick 2 finger head of tanned head retains quite well and leaves a ring of lace on the glass at every sip. The nose is an amazing balance of bitter hops, coffee tones and sweet chocolate. Taste is right in line with what the aroma lets you believe that you are in for. Hop bitterness upfront, burnt barley and chocolate notes filling out the middle and welcomed again with a bitter finish that is a mix of the burnt barley and hops. Lingering taste of bitter chocolate and hops remain on the palette. The alcohol is well hidden in this beer, it is not playing much of a role in the nose or taste. The feel of this beer is a little lighter than I anticipated but that is due in part by a higher amount of carb. I have to give this one a perfect rating for the smell. I purchased this bottle at the brewery the day that it was released and I have been putting this review off for too long. The smell is exactly what I believe the Troegs brothers were looking to accomplish with this beer and it is wonderful even after sitting in my beer fridge for too long. Great job, very good beer."
"Drinkability: After being a little disappointed with Scratch 15, Troegs has amped up the recipe and produced a complex and tasty coffee oatmeal stout that nicely blends together a variety of elements"
"strong bitterness brackets tastes of sweet coffeeness and sweet roasty. supersmooth delivery though a touch slim for a 7.5% stout (an oatmeal stout doesn't have to be robust, by any means). this does allow for hops to make an appearance, presenting a woody and citrus (though, importantly, not oaky) interruption of the sweetness. the coffee element is dignified and not forced like so many adjunct ingredients are"
"Smell is very chocolaty with some bitter coffee coming through. Taste also has strong chocolate and roasted malts with the coffee coming through as well. Not as strong of a coffee flavor as I anticipated but still a very good taste overall. I enjoyed this beer and for the price I would but again. As someone that isn't a huge coffee lover I enjoyed the more subtle coffee in this one compared to some other coffee stouts."
"D - The stout is solid and so drinkable you forget it is your ordinary 5%, at 7.5% it can have slight warming effects. The oatmeal impact is minimal but definitely a great choice if you dig coffee and stout w/ dark roast almost burnt flavor w/ dry not creamy feel"
"Find it. Drink it."
"Overall, a nice stout and very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: this beer is great for an after dinner drink or sitting in front of a fireplace. Easy to drink and a few could be had in a session, but be wary of well hidden alcohol levels."
"I poured from a bomber into a standard pint glass. It is pitch black with a 2 finger tan head. On the nose it is chocoalte forward, hints of coffee and citrus. The flavor profile is dark bitter chocolate and rounded out with coffee liquor and grapefruit. The finish lingers and is pleasantly bitter. The brew is full bodied and creamy. I enjoyed this beer but was suprised that the coffee flavors were just for rounding it out. IMO with a name like java head it should be coffee forward."
"I would suggest this to any coffee and beer loving individual."
"good oatmeal stout. however I want more coffee if they want to call this a java head stout."
"Overall this was hands down one of the best coffee beers I have ever tried I would go for this one again in a heartbeat, any day of the week. Amazing stuff."
"Tasty brew as is typical for Troegs with excellent character and just a slight twist from the style norm."
"D: Split the bomber and that was no problem. Very easy drinking with a fairly reasonable ABV. They really do not make a bad beer."
"Solid beer but not stellar."
"Pours a thick coffee black with plenty of head. Just a hint of coffee smell, but not much aroma at all. The coffee taste is more of an aftertaste than anything. Not nearly as much coffee flavor as I'd expect from a beer called Java Head. There are too many hops to let the beer really sing as an oatmeal stout. I think it would be better if it were made more along the lines of a standard oatmeal stout."
"Pour is super-dark with tan head that lasts fiarly long. Aroma has some espresso and strnog oatmeal presence. Some bitterness, not too robust though. Flavor isn't very robust either, some java and milk chocolate as well as darker malts. The flavor seems a little on the light side, but considering its not a 10%abv or something beer its god a good level. Mouth is light to moderate, light carbonation. More like a porter than a stout. All around it is pretty easy to drink, not super heavy. It is better than most options you might find at a bar."
"bomber from State Line Liquors, MD"
"M/D: Very smooth due to the oats, but is actually a bit too thin in the mouth. Carbonation is great. Pretty drinkable, hides the alcohol well."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, a bit slick and oily feeling. Slightly watery but pretty decent and drinkable."
"D: A higher ABV of 7.5%, makes this more of a dessert beer. Worthy of a purchase."
"D: A real solid brew from the boys at Troegs, but not quite up to their normal high standards. Also, a good but not great coffee stout, but to be fair after Jahva, Depth Charge, and Founders Breakfast I've got pretty high standards. The flavor here is good, but just a bit too thin and unbalanced to really take it to the elite level. All Troegs fans should support them and try, but not really a must try for all brew fans."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer and have already revisited it quite often and will continue to do so. Highly recommended if you are a fan of coffee stouts."
"Poured a dark brown with a one finger head that slowly reduced to a skin. The aroma was light coffee. The taste consisted of the usual suspects, i.e. coffee and bitter chocolate. The feel seemed on the medium side, but I'll give it a full bodied rating, and a nice job of walking the carbonation tight wire. Drinkability was good. I was happy with Java Head and the price was reasonable."
"Starts out a little thin and watery on the front of the tongue. Some sweet caramel makes its way in as the beer moves across the tongue. The body reveals itself in the middle as milk chocolate qualities develop - this is a very pleasing easy, creamy chocolate taste that gently coats the tongue. The beer reaches towards a slightly astringency towards the back of the arc - a whiff of bitter coffee and heat mixes with the still sweet malty backbone. The beer kicks into high gear and finishes with a good prick of piney hop bitterness on the back of the tongue. Well done here Trogners. The dryish finish is all earthen hop, coffee and strong cocoa...and it is in no hurry to leave. The finish is very nice, but the beer otherwise lacks a commanding presence, and suffers from the timid start, thin edges, and seemingly below average carbonation. A solid effort here - a beer that is easy to enjoy."
"Pours a deep dark brown with a standard full and fluffy khaki colored hand pumped head. Smell is of roasted coffee beans and malts with only faint hints of chocolate, vanilla, brown sugar. Taste is a medium to dark roasted coffee bean flavor with dark chocolate and malts, more akin to chocolate covered espresso beans than actuall brewed coffee. Hints of vanilla and brown sugar are present. Mouthfeel is typical cask, creamy and smooth, medium body lightened up by the hand pump. Very good, somewhat unique take on the coffee beer."
"This beer poured almost jet black and formed a huge medium tan foamy head, much like a float. It formed a latticed lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt, coffee and a hint of chocolate. The flavor was of malt, coffee, anise and bitter cocoa. The body was fairly light for the style and the finish bittersweet."
"D - Another very solid offering from Troegs - which shouldn't come as much of a surprise... Leaves you wanting another sip before you even put your glass down... I would be happy to recommend and revisit in the future... As a lover of both coffee and beer, this one is right in my wheelhouse..."
"uscaptainsblog.blogspot.com"
"Extremely drinkable and tasty. Not a wow beer but well made and worth trying and repeat samples."
"Drinkability: A solid, tasty brew from Troegs and an excellent addition to their lineup."
"Big, robust beer that will double as a meal in my opinion. A 22 oz is enough for anyone...at one time anyways. Cheers!"
"Drinkability is good, enjoyable stout reasonably priced even pick some up for a try."
"Bomber bottle, w/o freshness info. Pours quite near black, the head is dark khaki, slow to receede and then leaves copious lace. Dark malt and just a slight sniff of coffee/java in the nose. More dark malts, chalky chocolate and some grainy hops. Stale dark coffee note becomes more present as it warms. Not all that pleasant stuff, didn't really come together for me."
"Na Zdravje"
"not something i'll be returning to,but worth a shot."
"Drinkability overall is excellent one of those beers that keeps us beerdrinkers waiting for more, I enjoy a good limited release Harrisburg Trogner offering it has become some of the best drinks around."
"Pours an opaque darkness with better than a full finger stiff tan head that fades slowly to spotty patterns of lacing. The smell is a light malty NECCO chocolate java. The mouth feel is light-medium bodied and grainy with an unexpected zing of hoppiness. I'm surprised how well the substantial hoppy character blends with the mocha flavor; both linger nicely. A real fine drinker."
"D- I found the coffe element to be underwhelming, as it warmed the coffee seemed to come forward more as the hops receded but not enought to redeem this one for me."
"Very nice flavors not too big or complex but makes will for a fall stout that is quite drinkable. Coffee fresh and fine, coffee tannins, fresh citrusy hops, limited black fruits, slick glyceryl mouth yet thin at the same time."
"This beer is very drinkable and has no abrasiveness. You have to like porters/stouts, subtle hops, coffee, and alcohol to like Java Head as all those distinct flavors come together in their pleasantly decorated bomber. Good stuff...glad I picked it up."
"A delicious, unique brew! Things blend well - coffee forward, but hops certainly there, mixing in well. Get it if you can - esp. if you like coffee and hoppy!"
"D: Okay. Unique beer I like it. I like the waves of bitterness, each being very unique. The bakers chocolate flavor is bitter, it yeilds to an acrid coffee bitterness only to be overpowered by a citric bitterness. Different I must say. This is not a coffee forward beer. It is a different twist on the style though which I like. Unique."
"This beer pours a deep dark brown with slight light brown tinges to the edge when held to the light. A tan one inch finger of a head that recedes to a film and leaves nice streaky lacing. Nose of coffee, tofee, and toasted malts. Taste sweet upfront - toffee and caramel malts at first, lending to roasted malt mixed with chocolate and this finish is bitter coffee and burnt malts. Medium body, low carbonation, thin upfront at first with a slight oily feel to it at the end, bitter aftertaste. I enjoyed this beer throroughly and could definitely sit with it for a while."
"This isn't a bad brew, but nowhere near as good as I had anticipated after having Scratch #15 and #19."
" Yum!"
"This poured a nearly opaque black ruby with dark tan head. It smelled fairly simple like roasted coffee with heavy cream, and some bitter chocolate. It tasted like dry roasted coffee with copper and barley, then semi-sweet chocolate and a bit of lemon. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter coffee aftertaste. Overall this was a decent beer with an enjoyable taste and good body, but it wasn't as bold or clean as I expected. It's in limbo between being a standard or imperial stout. Pretty solid as a standard stout, but very unimpressive as an imperial. Also, I didn't sense any oat, so I'm not sure why it would be considered an oatmeal stout (unless I totally missed it). It'll probably be a while before I buy this again, if ever."
"Buy some of this stuff!"
"M/D: If you have ever had a beer that you thought was silky smooth, re-evaluate your stance. Nothing I have ever tasted comes close to the silky texture of this beer poured out of a firkin. The beer retains just a bit of carbonation from the pump, lending one of the most slippery mouthfeels of any beer I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. The alcohol is completely non-evident, and I would try to session this one if possible! This is one helluva good cask beer."
"Very dark chestnut brown (alomst black) with a chocolate milk-colored head. Foamy and medium-large in size, then diminishing to a creamy light brown film. A good amount of sticky lacing. Smell is of robust roasted malts with a decent dose of coffee. The hops the label advertised are a bit overstated. The taste follows the nose, with sweet roasted dark malt flavors dominating. Bitter coffee and cocoa flavors are helped along by the light hop presence to give it a lingering dry mouthfeel. Some very nice flavors pop out late in the finish. Overall, a nice treat. Worth a try if you come across it, but nothing worth seeking out."
"D:Extremely drinkable for a stout. Dangerous because of the higher ABV but addicting none the less. OK for a coffee stout."
"I picked up the 22 oz. with no signs of slowing down. This would be a great introductory brew in the stout variety to someone who might at first be intimidated by the intensity of a heavy malt presence as found in others."
"An excellent addition to Troegs lineup and one of their best beers in my opinion. You can tell they use their Hopback for this one to add a very unique hop aroma/flavor to a traditional stout. Guess the scratch series are paying off!"
"I had both of the Scratch beers that were coffee stouts, the 15 and the 19 I think it was, and this one is not quite as good as either. It's still quite good, but I enjoyed the boldness of the previous two a little more. If they are going to call it Java Head Stout then I'd like to see them amp up the coffee flavor a bit more. Still, a tasty beer for sure."
"Drinkability: 22oz is good enough for me but i can definitely session this brew"
"Overall, a good oatmeal stout. The mouth feel was spot on and very silky smooth."
"The flavor is more coffee forward than the aroma would leave you to believe. Pretty roasty with a nice coffee/espresso bean flavor up front which roasted chocolate malt, toffee, caramel, burnt toast and a nice bitter hop profile. Slightly more watered down than I would prefer but still has a nice silky medium body. Again, this is very hoppy for the style and it shows in the dry bitter finish. The alcohol is decently masked."
"overall: a very different beer for the style, very drinkable and tasty with a lot of different flavors going on that meld well, really fruity in an interesting way, layers of flavor my hat goes off to troegs for this one realy quite nice!"
"Overall, a solid offering from Troegs. I'm very happy I got the chance to try this, thanks a bunch to Sean (aka seanpachefddfa) for sending me this bottle!"
"Feels a bit carbonated, yet dense enough to handle it. Nice and easy to sip, just not one of my favorite coffee stouts."
"I would recommend this beer to anyone. Give it a try."
"Drinkability is uneven since the higher ABV is well-hidden you don't have the sense that you may get buzzed and the flavors are interesting but the bitterness at the end puts me off a little."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Beer is dark, like a stout, kind of brown at an angle, but there seems to be floaties in it, probably yeast? I'm not sure. Head is brown and diffuse, can't really get a reading on the carbonation, since the floaties aren't settling out, i'm going to guess this beer is THICK! Smells like a stout, maybe pick up some coffee and oatmeal in the aroma. Not a lot of oatmeal in the flavor, some alcohol in the flavor, some smoke on the back end. Pretty drinkable. Go find it, check it out."
"Drinkability: Not really worth it, so I scored it pretty average. It's not an especially heavy stout, and the flavors aren't awful, but not what's necessarily advertised by the label. If you're a fan of Troegs, you might like it, but if you're more a fan of stouts, I think you might be a bit let down, but that's just me..."
"d: I love oatmeal stouts, coffee, and Troegs. Very surprised I don't like this more. I was kicking myself on the way home for not buying more, but one was plenty. Glad I bought some fresh Nugget Nectar, I can't have Troegs leaving a bad taste in my mouth. :)"
"Coming into this, I expected a little more than what I actually received. Overall, a nice effort by Troegs, and will revisit this one again. ~"
"D: This doesn't feel like a 7.5% brew. I'm not sure where this fits in the TrÃ¶egs coffee stout trilogy that includes Scratch 15 and Scratch 19, but it seems like a middle ground between the two."
"A good java stout, and not too rich like Southern Tier's Javah. Recommended."
"D - This is a very drinkable beer...it's not heavy and it has some nice characteristics that stand out for it...I did not try any of the beers this one was made from...but Troegs always knows how to do it"
"Overall, pretty drinkable, and for me quite good. I bet it would be interesting with some age on it also. Especially if you aren't looking for a hoppy stout, set this one down for a while."
"Pours a pitch black with a tan head and medium lacing, decent retention. Smell and taste is a bit weak imo, has some roasted malts, coffee, hops, almost like gin, nothing too prominent, just a weak taste and smell. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, no alcohol and good carbonation. Drinkability is alright, decent taste, piney taste turns it into gin after a while, not as good as I had hoped."
"Easy to drink."
"Worth a try..."
"The beer pours a dark black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a bitter black malt and coffee scent along with some light chocolate notes. It also has some crystal and roasted malt character as well. The taste is decent. It has a complex flavor profile that boasts of coffee, patent malts, and hops. It goes down easy with a stiff dryness and a nice coffee finish. It has some citrus hop flavors in the middle which I could really do without. This is a black, coffee stout. Leave the hops out of this one. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This could be a much better beer. As it is, it's pretty good."
"D- Looks great, smells great, tastes good. It doesn't really stand out, but it isn't a complete crapshoot either. In fact I would lean more towards stand out than crapshoot easily. I might have this again, but their are better stouts. I recommend a look-see."
"The look of java head is a dark black shade with a rising head of mocha color that reached 2 inches almost spilling down the side of the glass. Nice streaks of lace although not covering the glass. Aroma's of dark malt, slight chocolate and a whole lot of fresh coffee beans. Taste is coffee forward with a slightly burnt taste. This is joined by some sweetness with slight vanilla and cream. Some hops round this out flavor wise. The feel is smooth and medium bodied with light carb which is pleasent. Could of polished off two bombers of this easy. This is a slightly ramped up version of scratch 15 and I feel it needed a slight tweek as 15 was so so for me. Grab you some bombers if you like coffee, I hope this stays in Troegs line up."
"Another quality beer from TrÃ¶egs."
"D - This is quite a good stout. Extremely smooth and sessionable. Plenty of flavors that all blend together very nicely...silky smooth."
"Would love to have again and again and again - but then again I love Troegs brothers brews."
"It reminded me of dead reckoning with coffee added during the brewing process, but they just missed the mark a bit."
"Pours a dark brown color with a off white thick frothy head that gives way to some lacing. The smell is of roasted malt, molasses, and coffee bean. The smell is just average as it is slightly weak. The taste is of molasses and roasted malt as a backbone and over the top is a nice mild coffee flavor. The flavor is smooth and not overpowering, all the flavors complement each other. The mouthfeel is of light carbonation and is a little creamy. Overall there is nothing to stop you from drinking a lot of these. You can go back for one after another."
"Same notes are in the taste as this is a light, medium-bodied somewhat creamy beer that passes a little smooth due to some minor oaky/woodiness. Has some coffee, roasted and chocolate malts taste along with minor hop bitterness. A good mild stout that is enjoyable but not the most outstanding."
"D: A very odd brew with heavy citrus contributions and less pronounced coffee notes. Not Troegs' best by any means."
"M + D: Mouthfeel is a tad disappointing, simply in that I would have hoped for more creaminess and body. It's not that I would consider it thin... rather, just not thick enough. There is a light-medium body to it, but it could do well with a bit more. This is a good effort, though, and certainly worth the time to look into."
"Overall- A nice coffee stout thats not too strong. A solid offering!"
"Overall, it was smooth, but I was expecting much more out of this, given the great beers that Troegs has brewed in the past."
"The pour was gorgeous - black with brown highlights,a large brown head that hung around a while, leaving some lace. On the nose, it's surprisingly hoppy with so much apricot and peach, I was taken aback. The base stout seems to be whelmed, with moderate roast, chocolate flavors coming through, and prominent cold pressed coffee also present. However, once my nose latched onto the hop character, it could not let go. On the palate, the beer opened (again) with a surprising amount of hop flavor with peach and apricot. Bitterness was reserved and actually perfect for style, and it made me wonder if it was warmer than necessary fermentation that was at fault here. Moderate roast, chocolate, and a clean, fresh coffee flavor with no lingering bitterness. The finish is moderately roasty with a little chocolate, and coffee. The palate's on the lighter side, with the carbonation being higher than I'd like, but once it had some time in the glass, it was pretty good. The finish was pretty good too. While I had no problems polishing off half a bomber, I was hoping for more. I'm going to revisit this in a few months to see how it's come along. The bottle I had was no more than 5 days old, making it one of the freshest beers I've had."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle picked up fresh from the bottling line last week. Poured into my Admans Imperial pint tumbler. Java Head appears an opaque deep brown color with over an inch of dense, creamy dark ecru foam. Nose and flavor consist of freshly roasted coffee beans, molasses, pungent skunky hops, bittersweet chocolate, nice roastiness, some dark bread notes and citrus akin to those chocolate oranges that are around for the holidays. Not really getting that chewy oatmeal characteristic that oatmeal stouts tend to have, but nevertheless, the stout has just about a medium body and is amply carbonated. A well done addition to the TrÃ¶egs lineup."
"The bitterness makes this one a bit onthe harsh side and I would have liked it to be a bit creamier and easy to drink. That said, it still goes down very easy and a beer that I would go back to again."
"D- this is a great brew from troegs and i would def get a keg of this. Easy to put back and nice for the winter months. enjoyable beer."
"Well I think that they finally hit the nail on the head, as this definitely falls somewhere between the Scratch 15 & 19 efforts. Great balance of flavors as this warms, with the citrus character of the Kenyan coffee beans really being put on display here. The smoothness and ease of the oatmeal polishes this out nicely. This is definitely not your typical Coffee Stout, but its uniqueness is what sets it apart."
"D-Solid! Becomes much more interesting and complex upon warming. Flavours pop well with the proper 55 F serving temperature. A very well balanced, enjoyable and easy to drink beer. Another winner from The Brothers!"
