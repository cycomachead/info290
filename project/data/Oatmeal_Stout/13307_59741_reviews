"Personally, and I'm not an expert in this style- but it tastes like a grill... in a bad way. Grease, smoke and more grease."
""
""
""
"O- the smoke plays more of a support role here, and it actually helps enhance the dark chocolate sweetness and the coffee, well done"

"O- Not a bad little brew but the bitter taste isn't blending with the other flavours well"
"Smoke actually doesn’t have the biggest influence on the palate, but it is recognizable in an enjoyable interaction with the malts, adding an unusal flavor to this great beer. Arguing from the perspective of loving a typical Bamberg smoked beer, this smoked stout entirely lacks the characteristic hints of saltiness. It is even more astonishing that it doesn’t need those, because of the complex coffee flavor, which stays in balance due to the malty smokiness - enough complexity is established in a different way, than they do it in Bamberg. The coffee flavor of this beer might already be enough to make this great, as it is very smooth, almost creamy, intense flavoured, and changes its taste on the palate during the tasting process."
"Intensely smoked.  Lots of wood, peat, pork and bacon flavor.  Moderate roasted malt and coffee blends well with the smoky notes.  Well balanced overall.  One of the better smoked beers I've had."

"The beauty of these really dark beers is that when I employ an aggro pour, the pseudo-cascade is extremely visible. I sat back in awe and watched it settle into two fingers of very dense, deep-tan/light-brown head with good retention. Color was an Opaque Black (SRM = 44) and it looked like the depths of outer space in my glass. Nose was very coffee-like with just a modicum of underlying smokiness. Mouthfeel was medium. While the coffee was still prevalent on the tongue, the smoke was beginning to assert itself in the mouth and in my sinus cavity. Warming, the smoke got stronger, but so did the coffee. I was really hoping for something much smokier, but since it is listed as an ""Oatmeal Stout", rather than a ""Rauchbier", I should not dun it too highly for this. Finish was still more prevalently coffee than smoky and I have to admit that I was disappointed. It was just too similar in taste to Beer Geek Breakfast and too lacking in smokiness to be worth the cost for a 330-ml. bottle."

"Pours a nearly opaque blackish color with medium brown head; thick rings down the glass. Smell: wood smoke, grain twang, earthy coffee with caramel and light fruitiness (plum ish). Taste: medium roast iced coffee, toffee, light earthiness, pine-ish note, grainy finish. Chocolate and dark fruit are reduced to being buried under the roast and grain. Worth a try, but my least favorite of the series so far."

"Pours a black color. 1/4 inch head of an off-tan color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, hint of alcohol, hint of smoke, and hint of floral notes. This is more the style of Smoked beer than an oatmeal stout, though it doesn't fit easily into either category. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is also a noticeable dryness. Tastes of sweet malt, roasted malt, hint of smoke, slight hops, and slight alcohol. Overall, good body, blend, and aroma, but the smoke is almost an afterthought."

"Truly a beer described and tastes as labelled. Missing only a bit of creamy palate feel to match. Otherwise a blast to drink."

"Poured into a Reuben's Brew snifter. Pours pitch black with a thin brown head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of sweet dark toasted malt, very light coffee with light chocolate and smokiness. Flavor of smoked, toasted dark malt, brewed coffee, light campfire smoke that has some peaty mineral character. Finishes with light grassy hops and boiled down coffee with a light residual smokiness. Medium bodied. An interesting coffee stout with a somewhat lighter malt and body than expected from an oatmeal stout. The malt complement does not quite support the smoke and coffee flavors, although they are not that intense. I enjoyed this, but was left wishing for a more intense malty stout body to play off the additional flavors. A well made coffee stout that doesn't really stand out from the pack."

"Bottle from Tipples, labeled as Rauch Geek. Pours pitch black with a massive dark brown head that goes on forever. Aroma is lots of smokey wood, candied bacon, chocolate, lots of earthy coffee, glorious. Flavor is chocolate and coffee up front with a nice bitter-sweet balance. earthy coffee really comes out as my palate gets used to the smoke. A rich oatmeal sweetness, lots of roasty malts, then a big punch of smoke that lingers on the palate until forever. Just a flavor explosion of all kinds, but the smokiness complements the other flavors beautifully. Relatively rich mouthfeel with low medium carbonation, but plenty drinkable. Probably my favorite of the Beer Geeks I have tried."

"O- Not a bad beer, but my least favor of the series."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, smoked malt, toasted oat, cocoa, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with smoke, cocoa, and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and dry mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a smoke presence that is more apparent in the aroma."
""
""
""
"Overall, there's a lot going on (including some off notes). It doesn't mesh really well and the bitter roast is a bit overwhelming."
"This beer holds it own by being packed with flavors at 7.5% ABV. A wonderfully delicious take on the series."
"Well, now. All I can say is that this is a pretty damn fine smoked beer. Rich and dark with a hefty malt backbone and a nice, thoroughly integrated smokiness throughout. I don't know how long this particular brew may be available, but, being a big fan of smoked beers, I'll definitely pick up another couple of bottles at Coaltrain Wine and Spirits in Colorado Springs to supplement my stash of Aecht Schlenkerla smoked beers. This one may not quite reach the heights of the Bavarian standard, but it's not too far off the mark."

"another beer geek incarnation, a splendid one too. big dark brown bodied oatmeal stout with a frothy milkshake tan head and intense smoke aromatics. its like an oatmeal stout meets a campfire, evoking notions of brisket and pork butt on the slow fire. its meaty in that way, almost primitive, yet refined in a way that only mikkeller can execute. big bold zesty flavors from the charred barley, and a coffee addition appears evident. as full bodied as they get, and at 7.5% its sturdy enough for cold winter drinking. some people dream of curling up with a book and a cup of tea on a grey day in January. I will now dream of curling up with this beer and a hockey game. masculine and aggressive, but patient and contemplative as well. an overall exceptional stout from mikkeller, one that I look forward to getting into again soon."

"O: A little weak on the smoke aspect, especially when it collides with the coffee and bitterness in the mid-palate the way that it does. It's also more of a burnt smoke than bacon or meaty smoke, which is interesting considering the name/alias of the beer. That aside, it's still a good coffee stout with some desirable qualities. Also, it's one of very few Mikkeller brews that are decently affordable (not that $5.99 for a 330 mL bottle is really affordable, but it is for Mikkeller). Nice to try if you're into the regular BGB or just a fan of Mikkeller, but aside from that there are better smoked beers to be had"

"Overall, a subtly smoked oatmeal stout with pronounced roasted grain qualities (500 ml, BB 03-11-2013, into tulip)."
""

"Bam! This brew assaults your palate like a batallion of smoke-infused coffee ninjas, insistantly demanding your attention. Crazy stuff: coffee, rauchmalt and roasted grain all laced with soy. It's fair to say that it lives up to its name; there is more than a hint of bacon in the aroma and a whiff in the flavour as well. Overall though, the coffee and smoked malt sit uneasily together and compete rather than complement. The result is inspired but imperfect - it lacks the incredible silky smoothness of Beer Geek Breakfast. However, it remains a unique and worthy brew - don't pass it up if you see it."
"O- a nice beer. it was hard to drink 16 oz of it though."
""
"One of the most interesting beers I've ever had! The smell was incredible - smokey, bacon-y, earthy, and something roasted like peat moss. The taste wasn't quite as strong as the smell, but I'd say that's because it was smooth and well-balanced. This isn't my favorite style of beer, but I'd have this brew again and again."
""
"O- it's a good beer and interesting but nothing spectacular. Somewhat let down by this one. Won't be getting it again.  3.5"
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is pretty much medium-bodied. It's not bad, really, just lacking. In body, primarily. Overall, this is a solid, enjoyable impy stout. It's got pleasant coffee-dominant flavor with a nice bacon-like accent. Worth a shot."
""

"O= A solid smokey beer. I love the smoke and tis is one to keep in stock if you can find it."
""
""
""
"O: Not as good as I thought it would be from the aromas and surprisingly boozy but this is still a good, interesting brew"
""
""
"D - The aroma is overwhelmingly smoky, to the point that I was dreading the flavor, but it is surprisingly drinkable for a beer with such intense peat character. The smoke in the flavor is pleasant and provides a nice balance and contrast for the dry caramel malt components."
"Two finger milk chocolate colored head with little retention on a jet black body. Aroma is a little off putting. The mesquite aroma is more like Raid insectacide by my nose. I cant get much else from it. When drinking the flavor actually makes the aroma better. The flavor is a very nice smokey, mesquite, bacon taste which is actually mellow and not over done making this one of the more drinkable beers in this genre that I have had. Thick body and moderate carbonation. I know my rating is high but for the genre this is excellent."
""

"Thought this was pretty good, better than the hop one but not as good as the first two."
"500 ml bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours an almost pitch black color with a nice 1 finger dense tan head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of burnt wood, smoked meat, roasted malt, dark chocolate, caramel, and coffee. Nice and balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, burnt wood, smoke, caramel, roasted malt, coffee, molasses, and herbal hops. Light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, smoke, caramel, coffee, and roasted malt on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of flavors without being too smokey. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and lush mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish present. Overall this is a very nice smoked stout. Nice balance and robustness; and very drinkable as well. Enjoyed this one."

"Pours a very thick, pitch black color with a medium, dark brown/espresso colored head that goes down slowly. Scent is initially smokey with some espresso and burnt malt aromas. Charred chocolate and dark malt scents with some dark chocolate and more smoke. Taste is just as smokey as the nose leads. Not overly smokey and not too light on the smoke. Almost ""just right"". Lovely roasted malt and dark chocolate. Some nutty characteristics...light hazelnut with intense almond. Some burnt sugar with sharp espresso...a little like stale espresso, but not bad. The light vanilla and smoke make up for it. Mouthfeel is thick and full-bodied. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a great smoked stout. I like this one more than Beer Geek Breakfast and Brunch Weasel."
""
"Like It? Sure"

"Overall, this is tasty, but not mind-blowing. The nose was like whoa, but the beer was just good."

"O: I like this beer. I’m not blown away, but its super interesting and I love all of the smoke and roast in this beer... Uggh, I just got a mouthful of little brown sludgy bits! Gross. I'm gonna have to bring it down a peg now."
""
""
"O: Excellent smoked beer. Great on its own or as a compliment to a hearty meal."
""
""
""
"Overall, this was a very nice stout in my opinion. I would like to give West Lakeview Liquors in Chicago for recommending this to me. I would say I normally don't really enjoy Mikkeller's beers but this one was very solid. Beers like this make me want to see what else they have to offer.... Merry Christmas to me."

"overall for me the taste brings the beer down a lot it was just way to smokey felt like i was drinking an ash tray. it had a nice aroma and look to it but i was disappointed."
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of smoked malt with rich roasted dry malt notes is quite interesting though not as over-the-top as expecting. Taste is also a nice mix between some smoked flavours and notes of dry coffee. Body is full with nice creamy texture and good carbonation. Very well brewed with nice mix between smoked flavour and notes of roasted malt. Also, this beer has got quite a body considering the low ABV."
"O - Smokey brews are no longer on my ""to buy"" list... This one is way overwhelming. Too much smoke and not enough good eclectic flavors. Not worth hunting."
""
"O Great after dinner or for beakfast as the name implies. Despite how smokey it is, it's never overpowering or cloying. This was really great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There is a lot of Smokey flavor going on with this beer. It's important to know that going in. Not as much of a thick body as it looks and sounds like it'd have, making it relatively easy to drink."
""
""
""
"i love me some rauch, although this interpretation wasn't wholly satisfying"
""
""
""
"D: I think they went a step too far with smoking such a dark brew. The smoke clashed with instead of complimented the darker qualities (coffee, chocolate, etc.). An interesting beer, but not the best Mikkeller out there."

"Do not want."
"Overall: The bacon and coffee flavors I think were overpowered by the smokiness. Stale coffee and overcooked bacon perhaps can be detected but that's not what I wanted. I want breakfast in a bottle with some nice hops."
"Overall - Smoke-dominated. I long for the stout inside. And where's the coffee? Less smoke would give this a hint of bacon, but it's so smokey I don't even think of bacon."
"Overall. A little bit over the top for me. The smoke is just too overpowering. Interesting, but probably not something I'll seek out again."
"O-Really unique but well put together.Strong flavors playing off each other well."
"Overall: I have to stick with weasal as my favorite still but this was a well done combination of styles and ingredients. I love what Mikkeller puts out."
"I like rauch beers in general and this beer a lot; wish it was a bit less pricey and I could buy it more often. Not always in the mood but when I am this one hits the spot. Very black with a big brown head that sticks around. Lacing is good. The nose is a mixture of smoke, roasted malt, coffee. The smoke isn’t overpowering here or in the tasting; in fact it’s very well balanced for this style, with a subtle bacony flavor underneath the coffee. A little smoky peat but not anything that detracts from the other flavor notes. Oaky, malty, bittersweet chocolate, vague maple bacon hints underneath it all. Complex and delicious. Fairly thick, slightly coating in the mouth. Smooth and a little oily. Satisfying feel. This isn’t going to be everyone’s cup of tea and I wouldn’t want it everyday but it sure hits the spot when the mood strikes. One is going to be enough unless you’re a rauch freak. Had this last on a cold mountain evening with a platter of smoked and unsmoked cheeses, nice crackers, and charcuterie."
"My wife bought this at the Foodery in Philadelphia for me birthday. I poured from the 1 pint 9 fluid ounce bottle into an all-American pint glass. Darkness to the point of opacity with a thick tan head. If you are enjoying this for breakfast you will wake up and smell the coffee but the smoky notes were subdued. But wait, get a mouthful and there they are. Delicious roasty smoky goodness. A lovely balance of the coffee, stout and smoke swimming in the chewy but not=quite-thick lay on the tongue. I found a certain peatyness reminiscent of a single malt Scotch. Lovely."
"Overall: Another great coffee stout. The smoked element overpowers much of the coffee, but is reigned in a bit by the oatmeal's creaminess."
"Overall: Not sure how much I like this brew. It may just be that I would have preferred this beer to have a little more malty sweetness in play to help balance the very bitter coffee/cocoa and heavy smoke flavors."
"I wish this were sweeter and richer. mostly a bitter oatmeal stout with some smoke-- I was expecting more."
"Had as Rauch Geek Breakfast, which is labeled an Oatmeal Stout. Whatever. Strong, smoky aroma has tones of coffee, molasses and hickory. It pours a deep, nearly black, opaque sable with a very thick and fine-bubbled dark tan head. As for the flavor - imagine drinking a high-quality mocha that's been spiked. Now add a generous helping of hickory smoke and pinches of nutty, caramel and licorice flavors. Full-bodied texture has a strong fizz and leaves behind a firm, persistent tingle. Catch this one while you can!"
"Pours black with ample, compact, and very dark brown head. Diminishes to a thin film and ring; overall, solid retention and minimal lacing. Has a smokey and roasted character which reminds me of barbecued meat. Taste is similarly smokey and roasted, with a slight undertone of vanilla. Carbonation is medium-high, a bit too high for the style. Medium bodied. Overall, this is a decent example of a roasty/smokey stout, pretty light on the coffee (considering coffee was added) and non-existent chocolate presence."
"What is the difference between a hop bitterness and a coffee bitterness? I can't tell in this beer. Wherever it comes from, it lingers for a little bit. There is a sweetness that is similar to a spoonful of sugar and a splash of cream that kinda takes the edge off. Actually, there aren't a lot of edges, just a lot of charred flavors that aren't subtle. The way all of the flavors mix isn't very good to me at this time."
"From the first sip I’m loving it. The smoke comes through and I can’t get enough of it. There’s a lingering finish. It’s sharp, dry, and delicious. I may just have to get another one of these, and soon."
"bummer! i love the concept, but it was surprisingly light in body and lacked richness and balance. mostly, though, it was the texture. it was like ""beer geek tapioca", or ""retirement home breakfast."""
"Notes: This beer is able to deliver a hefty dose of smoked malts while still maintaining good complexity and layering of flavors. Easily one of the better smoked beers I've had."
"O: Overall, it took me the whole bottle and a bunch of input from tasting friends to really try to understand what this beer is. We are still trying to... Maybe a little more age on it and it might gain a bit more harmony. Still this beer is goin places!"
"Cheers"
"D/O- Extreme beer here, I'd like to think anyone who buys this knows what they are getting into and therefore enjoys what they taste. Bacon smoke in a higher ABV oatmeal stout defines it perfectly. Will have this at least a few more times before its all said and done."
"Pours jet black with a dark brown head. In the aroma, sweet oatmeal, roasty, and campfire like. In the taste, a nice sweetness of oatmeal, and a nice roast, with a smokey flavor sneaking up halfway through and hanging in there till the end. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry smokiness in the aftertaste. Nice roast and small smoke, not too much smoke either, very well done."
"Overall, this is a very good beer. I think it could be tricky to have more than one due to the intensity, which is also what makes it great. It is good enough that I would definitely have another, with that being said. Very nice beer."
"O - Berr and bacon together, how can you resist? Interesting concept, more smoky than bacony, worth a try but not another purchase"
"Thick, chewy body. Not overwhelmingly slick - the carbonation is just right. This is a nice beer with a hearty meal, or even as a dessert."
"Overall its a little much but interesting."
"The aroma was heaven. Rich chocolate and dark fruits melded together seemlessly. with a huge campfire like smoke note then percolating through but i was quite impressed with how it did not dominate. Really very rich and full, and easily one of the b =est smells I have come across. As it warmed some nice touches of molasses and woody notes start to dominate with a really intrsting bourbon smell in the back. again the smoke comes into play but soo nicely done i was quite imoressed. To taste this was like falling into a giant pillow. Rich and full with a woody, oak soaked, chocolate geyser of taste just exploding from the glass. Some burnt sugar notes, sweet lactose like flavors, and that really nice dark fruit tartness in the finish. Different then most other giant stouts, this one had a mind all its own."
"(16.9oz bottle from Holiday Wine in SD). Pours dark brown with khaki head. Aroma is smoke, dark chocolate, and some light dark fruit. Taste follows suit with bitterness and a touch of malt sweetness. Medium bodied with oily texture. Bitter finish. Ok beer, but could use some sweetness."
"This would be great around a campfire on a cool night."
"Overall, a solid beer. Perhaps - as far as stouts go - my palate is unrefined. If you like smoked beers, give this one a shot. If you don't, I'd save the ten bucks"
"D-OVerall this was too smokey to enjoy. the coffee and meat flavor was very nice but the smoke was just soo much to enjoy. A decent stout but not something i will seek out again."
"Let this bottle warm up a bit out of the fridge. Poured with a mammoth, tan, foamy, frothy, thick, creamy head and no lace. Color is an absolutely opaque brown black. Aroma is smoke, dark roasty malt, dark ripe fruit, and old leather. Taste is very similar to nose with just a hint of malt sweet. Body is good, smooth, soft and chewy with good carbonation. Finish is like flavor and of medium length. I prefer smoke beers with a milder smokieness, so I don't call this a session."
"Pours a deep black with cap of dark brown bubbles, gone rather quickly and minimal lacing. Scent leads with a strong smoke and chared grain profile, noted of bitter black coffee grinds on the back. When cold, taste is dominated by a strong, but not harsh meaty smoke. As it warms, other flavors, namely spent coffee grinds and a faint touch of dark cherry. Lingering char on the palate, full bodied and smooth, quite bubbly. A nice aggressive smoke profile that doesn't overpower, a good base beer unfortunately hidden too well."
"O - As a lover of smoked beers and a person that has to be in the right mood for a coffee beer this one works out really well for me I'm enjoying the blend of flavors probably couldn't drink more than the bomber in a sitting but its still very good and worth trying if you like smoked beers"
"As a smoke-head, this is tremendously drinkable, with the smoke being a pronounced asset, yet not overwhelming completely. But the wonderful Beer Geek stout attributes are stifled quite a bit."
"I honestly didn't get any bacon out of this; certainly not as much as Schlenkerla. This certainly delivers the goods in terms of smokiness, but it wore me down in a hurry. Before the end of my half-bottle, I was 100% burned out. No pun intended."
"O - This is a tasty smoked/coffee beer. The sediment at the end was a draw back. Too much age maybe?"
"O: Smoked beers are polarizing, I think... but I’m in the crowd that loves ‘em - especially smoked porters and stouts. This is a nice, savory brew that I really enjoyed. Wish I had some for a campfire or a pulled pork dinner. Delicious."
"The pour into my snifter was what I expected a two finger mocha colored head and a body that was black as night. What I expect for a stout from Mikkeller. The smell was good, however I got more smoke than bacon but I can tell why Mikkeller named it the Beer Geek Bacon for the European release. There is a hint of saltiness in the smell of the smoke. Let me add there is a really strong smoke scent. I did not get any coffee at all, which was listed as an ingredient. The taste however is where this beer takes it above the good rating I gave for the prior two categories. In the flavor you get the coffee on the middle of the mouth aftertaste once the initial smokiness fades away. Again the only notion of bacon is in the aftertaste, once swallowed. There is this salty flavor that is hard to define. The mouthfeel was dry dry dry and I found this to be exceptional for this type of beer. Overall this was an amazing beer. The overall experience of the beer improved as the beer warmed and I loved the complexity. Those not into smoke should stay away it is pretty profound but for an extreme beer lover, this was great and at 7.5 it hit the spot."
"The last rauchbier I tried kind of scared me off smoked beers, but I thought this blended in some smoked flavor nicely with more typical stout notes, and I enjoyed it."
"Notes: A bit thinner than some of the other geek breakfast offerings but it is nicely balanced out by the smoked sense and it retains most of the underlying essence. The nose is slightly more provocative than the flavor but, all in al,l this is quite recommendable."
"Had this on-tap at the Brick Store Pub. I'm a big fan of Rauchbiers, so I was excited to try this one. Pours black with a coffee with cream head. The aroma is lightly smokey and roasty, but a bit subdued. Luckily, the taste is exceptional. Perfectly balanced roastiness with beautiful smoke notes and a meaty song of bacon throughout. Quite bitter and dry in the mouth, with late cocoa notes. A really cool beer."
"O- Kind of dissapointed I didn't have this with some BBQ, but it was great on its own, I thought they did a nice job incorporating the smoke in this."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. The alcohol is well integrated. However, the biggest turnoff of this brew is how oily the feel is and the way it coats the mouth. The texture of coagulated mystery ingredient is absolutely repulsive as it slides down the back if the throat. My friend sharing in the experience drainpoured his share. I tried my best to finish mine but nearly threw up after entering the second half of my glass. Bad bottle or not, I will never drink this beer again."
"O: Interesting."
"O - A ""unique"" beer. I really have been wanting to try this beer for some time expecting some real bacon flavors and aromas and i barely got any. It was kind of a let down, along with the medicinal aftertastes i don't think i would buy this again."
"I’ve been venturing further into smoked beers and this one certainly doesn’t disappoint in that aspect and is a unique take on the Beer Geek family. However, the tire burnout aroma and taste are a bit off-putting but luckily it is a minor aspect of an otherwise fantastic brew."
"Overall a very good smoked beer. Not one dimensional, but lacking some depth of character from Bamburg examples."
"O: Everything was pretty good on this beer except for the flavor profile, the most important feature. Certainly need to try this one again, since other palates I trust have enjoyed this beer."
"Pours pitch black, with several fingers of dirty and almost muddy brown head - dense and creamy. Fantastic like every other Mikkeller stout I've tasted. Nose hold ash, wood, smoke among other general campfire notes. Hints to some smoked meat too. Yum. Taste is a charred and ashy wood, with a lighter and more peripheral smoked meat (bacon perhaps?). Slight caramel quality to the malt as well, with a little bit of alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel has a slight grittiness to it, and has substantial lingering smoke and roasted notes to it. Great stuff, feels like a Schlenkerla on 'roids contained within a stout."
"This is an interesting and complex flavor profile here, one I cannot really compare to the Beer Geek Breakfast because I've never had it. I did enjoy this ""smoked"" version of it, but after a full bottle, these overly smokey notes got to me and became a little sickening."
"Mikkeller knows how to do coffee stouts...this is outstanding, jam packed with flavor without being overbearing in any way."
"The CPJ"
"Poured an opaque dark brown with a healthy tan head that lingered very well. Roasted malts and beef jerky in the aroma. Taste of smoked, salty, cured meat up front, dark malts providing a smooth, rich background. Nutty and earthy qualities as well, with a bit of leather. Yeah, definitely a man's brew. Full-bodied and chewy, and--for me--quite drinkable."
" I really expected a different flavor for some reason - The stout starts smooth, almost has a caramel cream element with some sweet malt qualities, but mild toast and cocoa creeps forward in the taste until a large amount of smokiness develops, even more as it warms. The flavor is not offensive to me as others in the style seem to lack the body or sweetness to balance the slight burnt dry flavors. Rauch Geek or Beer Geek Bacon whichever moniker it goes by at the time is not shy about it's smoke, but it also uses it as a complimentary flavor rather than a full on smoke fest. I find the smoke pleasant and vibrant, yet it still adds a bitter edge. I like the complexity it adds while the flavor does not neglect mild coffee notes at all. think of this as your oatmeal, coffee and bacon all wrapped up together in a slighter strong (7.5%) stout.I enjoyed this immensely - Rauch Geek was a fine example of what Mikkeller's strengths can be in a quality American style stout."
"Well if you like a good Rauchbier, you’re probably going to enjoy this, as it definitely brings a whole lot of that plus most of the other things that make the Beer Geek Stouts solid. My only complaint is that the coffee character that is normally a big part of these beers just doesn’t have much of an impact but I guess that’s to be expected. This isn’t going to be everyone’s cup of tea but I overall enjoyed this."
"Overall: I am very please I was able to try this. Not an every day beer, but on a rainy day like this I was really satisfied!"
"A really interesting and unique beer overall. I would absolutely recommend pairing this up with some BBQ - that would be a real winner."
"M: Smoke, smoke taken to a new level and then some. The chewiness, for all the smoke, is surprisingly sweet but moderation is the key - very smokey and intense."
"Pours a dark brown with an interesting reddish tint. A nice amount of off-white head. Smells smokey and roasty. A bit of coffee on the nose. Tastes roasty and smokey like a bit of bacon. The roast is a bit off but overall the dryness of the roasted malts is perfect. Overall something i wouldn't want to have again but definitely intestine to try!"
"For something different, I recommend picking this up."
"A hugely smokey beer that lives up to it's name. This is definitely not for everyone, but I absolutely love smoked beers and this one fits the bill. I will have another."
"O - Very one dimensional."
"A very smokey beer but it works well with the coffee and roasted malt flavor. You got to enjoy smoke to like this beer. The flavors make this beer a bit heavy. Great winter/campfire beer."
" Finished this beer out of duty and price. My buddy bought it for us to try and it was eighteen dollars. Otherwise, drinkability isn't great. Still got love for mikkeller though. Just not this particular beer."
"Rauch Geek Breakfast is yet another tasty treat from one of the best breweries on planet Earth. Brunch Weasel is still king of the Geeks (and is a much bigger beer), but this smoky little number isn't far behind."
"While it all starts out quite indicative of the titular breakfast morsel, everything thankfully levels off to a more agreeable smoky oatmeal maltiness, far more drinkable that one would have assumed from awkward first impressions. And not surprisingly, I have an urge to seek out some Islay single malt, something usually anathema to my Speyside-worshipping palate. Nicely played."
"O - Tasty and unique. Really glad I had the opportunity to share this one. Though, it might be tough to take down more than a single bottle at a time."
"Pours black with a medium sized tan head. Strong smoke aroma with chocolate and roasted malts. Taste again is smokey with more chocolate and bitter coffee. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Very nice, this is one of the best smoked beers I've tried. Thanks wordemupg!"
"Too smokey! First sip hits you wth that over smoked, burnt maltiness. The aftertaste is worse than the mouth feel, ill leAve this short bc i couldnt stand this one, im usually a huge mikkeller fan, but i was dissapointed with this brew. Overall... Not so good."
"D: The smoke is a welcome addition to an oatmeal stout infused with coffee.  I would have enjoyed more smoke characteristics, but that would have hurt drinkability. Quite drinkable, especially for an unusually chilly evening. "
"Have this alongside the Schlenkerla standard and see what you think. It's a potent one, and not to be missed if you get the chance, if only because of the level of novelty."
"O: not my thing at all. Pretty sure this is my first Rauchbier and certainly my last for a long time. I looove Beer Geek Breakfast & Brunch (and most other Mikkellers), but this was just terrible. Hate to pour out craft beer, but the remaining ~80% of this bottle is headed down the drain."
"At $11 a bottle, I can't give it too high of an overall score, but it is an interesting beer worth checking out if you've never had it before. Not as good as the brunch weasel, but good."
"D: While this is an uneven and inconsistent beer, it still has a good drinkability."
"This brew pours out like old motor oil, it looks super thick going into the glass. The smell is smokey but not overwhelmingly. You can pick up on other aromas too like medicine and a little bit of burnt coffee. The taste is surprisingly a much lighter smoked flavor than I expected. Some smoked beers are just way too much and it makes it gross. This one wasn't too bad, but not great though. The mouthfeel is also surprisingly lighter than the look it has. This beer is a little deceptive with the eyes. It's ok but nothing fantastic."
"overall - this is a terrible tasting beer and is very pricey to boot - i would never buy or drink this beer again"
"O - Can't say enough about how beautiful this beer is. It has the best head I've ever seen, on any style of beer, period. There's a salty character to the smoke in the beer that I'm ambivalent about. Not the best smoked beer I've had, but a nice take on the style."
"Overall this was a rough beer. I would say that this is going to be one of those ones you try and you are either going to love it or hate it and nothing in between. I will admit another slight downfall to many of Mikkeller's beers are that they come with a hefty price tag and this was no exception coming in at $14 but I really wanted to go out on a limb and give it a shot. If you are feeling daring or just want to try something really out of your normal this is just for you. Would I buy it again or would I possibly trade for it myself? Hell no, the tiny taste of the bottle was too much for me. But hey again that's why it is called a opinion and no one can judge you for your perception."
"Drinkability/Overall-Great beer that I'm enjoying with every sip, Mikkeller really put together a nice one here and despite my slight nitpicks it's a real knockout of a brew."
"O- Stay away if you dont like smoked beers, if you do grab this one up, I loved it."
"CHEERS!!"
"Doesn't live up to the bacon claim, but as a concept this so totally works, the roast malt, coffee and smoked malt make a winning team with this particular combination. If you like smoked beers then go for it, get some and go again."
"I'd drink this again but I'm going to be broke after trying all these new Mikkellers released in Alberta and then buying more of the ones I want to cellar. Nice smokey flavors if you like that sort of thing its worth looking for"
"O- overall, i think this is my favorite treatment that the beer geek breakfast received; and im not really a fan of smoked beers. the smoke is heavy without being overbearing or leaving this too one dimensional. this is something ill look for again."
"Pours a nice color like most of the other geek beers i've had. Dark brown head that has good retention. Good carbonation on this. The smell is real nice, smokey coffee that makes me dive right in. The taste, however, is disjointed. I'm barely able to get a 4oz. pour down. I like smoked malts and rauch beer quality but this ones terribly bitter on the finish. The coffee and malty middle doesn't make up for the finish. I was really disappointed in this as I've thoroughly enjoyed the other beer geek breakfast and brunch beers."
"D: A little outside of my style preference (due to the smoke), this is still smooth and enjoyable to drink. Another solid variation on Mikkeller's solid breakfast beer."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink because the smoky flavors and bitterness are not overpowering and the alcohol is well hidden."
"Cheers!"
"O: I liked the beer. I thought the smoke was a little overpowering at times, and I wish the bacon could have been stronger. Nonetheless, a pretty soild offering, but not one I would want to have too many of. Skal."
"M - Fantastic. Velvety smooth and viscous."
"Drinkability - AMAZING BEER! Its perfect if you like oatmeal stouts, bacon and rauch (smoke) beers."
"Great great beer. I rased through my serving. Delicious and recommended. The balance between all the flavors is amazing."
"For an oatmeal stout I kind of think the feel could be a little smoother. It's kind of light and the carbonation is a bit coarse. Drinkable beyond belief though. Real good beer. Only downside is that it is a bit on the warm side."
"Drinkability is slightly above average. I did enjoy the smoke aspect to this, but not to the point where I'd have more than one. An interesting beer to try, though."
"Overall: I wouldn't care to drink it again, but not bad."
"D: I could actually drink a fair bit of this if I enjoyed it more. Not a bad brew, and interesting in its pointed smokiness. It drinks much lighter than it is, and I'd actually give it a higher drinkability rating if I wasn't confident that the smokiness would become even more tiresome."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being moderate. Drinkability was good, I thought it was a very nice smoked beer. It had a big smoky, campfire like flavor to it, but was also pretty smooth and drinkable. Very enjoyable beer overall, and a solid beer all around."
"I like this beer, I just wish it were a LITTLE bit smoother and the coffee less bitter. Tasty, none the less. (But my mom didn't like it)"
"I likes my smoke and I likes my Beer Geek Breakfast. This one is good -- better than the standard Beer Geek, but not quite up to the level of the weasel."
"This brew needs a lot of time to unlock its flavor, but it's worth it. Still a bigger fan of the regular Beer Geek Breakfast, but a nice try."
"All in all an interesting beer. Probably won't pick this up again but I'm glad I picked it up for the experience. All over the place. A good experiment, but that's it."
"Cheers!"
"Marvelous. Worth a try for fans of the style. If you love bacon, it's a bonus."
"I have never rated a beer all over the board like this one, but I still like it and want some more, just a few too many flaws. cheers!"
"D: Overall I would just drink the GBB, I think the smokiness could be cloying after a bottle, there is a lot in this beer that needs to be respected and enjoyed but I would wait a while before trying this again, maybe laying it down would mellow out the flavors a little."
"D: Lots of good flavors in this beer, but they don't stand out. Initial impression of this beer was great, but after a few sips my excitement died down. Definitely worth trying, just temper your expectations"
"Pours a deep brown/black with an inch of tan foam that quickly faded into a layer of bubbles with nice oily lacing down the glass. I'm mainly picking up on the smokey bacon aroma and some dark roasted malts with hints of the coffee fighting through. Taste keeps flipping back between roasted coffee, bacon, smoke and bitter chocolate. very unique flavor to me. Light carbonation with a medium body, its smooth and creamy while being harsh from the smoke at the same time. Its fairly enjoyable but not sure i'd want more than one glass. But this also is coming from a self-proclaimed non rauchbier fan."
"Drinkability: Let's sip this. With how much smoke is in here, there is no way this is doing anything but disappearing slowly."
"Jet black pour with a big, frothy, brown head. Lots of espresso roasted coffee bean aroma with a healthy dose of dark chocolate, mild dark fruit notes and layers of hickory smoke and maple. The flavor is dark bitter coffee and semi-sweet chocolate with just a hint of raisins, dates and plums in the middle. The finish has lots of wood smoke with a tiny bit of maple sweetness and a kick of spicy noble hops at the end. Body is creamy but a little thin and aqueous with lots of soft carbonation."
"D - Not bad, but I was surprised by how little this evoked bacon. It's just a smokier, smoother version of Beer Geek Breakfast. I heard it's more bacon-flavored on-tap, but I wouldn't bother with the bottles again. This was split four ways and that was about right for me."
"I'm not sure if I'd go for this again. I'm not a big fan of smoked beer and perhaps it just isn't for me. If you enjoy smoked beer I'd give this a go but it wasn't for me."
"d- not the greatest, this one shouldn't be challenging my palate, but it kind of is, it's a sipper for sure."
"d-Smooth and creamy, but still a wonderfully balanced smoked brew. Not too filling. Really amazing brew, but not something you'd drink a ton of, but I really LOVED this one."
"D: Truly a unique brew that I enjoyed much more than I expected to."
"D- not a fan. Waaay too smoky for my tastes"
"D - This is a great beer (on tap) that I had to get a second pour of. Great stuff."
"MF: Chalky, dry & tannic. Tastes of oats & chocolate balance w/ the smoke for breakfast flavor."
"Pours a deep black with a very small head (if I swish the snifter) this however does leave some lacing, surprisingly enough. The aroma is sweet smoked bacon with some coffee, and plenty of roastiness. I didn't detect much for hops at all in the aroma of this beer which is why I am surprised that the beer has as much fruity hop character in the flavor as it does. The flavor is of course dominated by sweet smoked bacon and cocoa with some nice fresh roasted coffee. The finish is remarkably clean, and for a beer with this much going on that's really saying something. Just a really tasty beer."
"D- Pretty good brew, just the smoke taste makes this one a bit on the harder side for me to drink."
"D: I don't think you'd want to drink a lot of it, but it is definitely an easy sipper, and incredibly robust for a 7.5% stout. I really like the way the smoke adds to the coffee in the beer, does a lot to enhance it. Very enjoyable beer."
"Overall, this beer is more well balanced than I prefer for this style but the surprising hop character is quite nice."
"The name definitely drew me to this one. I'd been wanting to try this for awhile and was lucky enough to find a bottle at LUSH in Chicago. It's like motor oil in both consistency and color. It has a two finger dark, dark creamy khaki head. The aromas are rich and malty. It's smoky but not as smoky as I thought it would be. It has an element of smoked wood, like cedar. It smells more like a smoked baltic porter than an imperial stout. It has the light sweetness of a baltic and lacks the true coffee presence of a stronger stout. The aromas are highly appealing altogether. The taste however is disappointing, coming from the way the beer smells. It's kind of bland. The smoked wood flavor comes through in the aftertaste. I wish there was more of this while you were actually drinking it. The more drinks I take from the glass the more I can see the bacon aspect. It's very rich and has nice roasted accents. It grows with every taste, kind of like hickory smoked bacon. It's drinkable but it could've been more, could've been better. It's drinkable for the product but it's too pricey to really try again. I'm glad I found it."
"Medium to full bodied with a bitter aftertaste and mild carbonation. This beer does not have as much of the smoky, or bacon flavor as I had hoped, which is disappointing. I am still glad I had a chance to try this."
"D-One bottle is enough to get the idea."
"D: The smoke is dialed in very well and doesn't detract from the drinkability. I was expeceting a little more with the bacon factor, but it's still good."
"TASTE: this practically tastes like coffee-beer; in actuality, it's a smoked oatmeal stout; very roasted on the palate with some cement on the finish; the smoke comes through only a very little bit --- this is nothing like the famed Schenkerla brews; there's really nothing elegant about this 7.5% abv. beer, so don't bother with it if that's what you're looking for. So, do I like this beer? Yes. Do I think it's worth it's $10 for 17oz? No. Would I drink it if somebody offered it to me? Happily."
"This beer was smokey from start to finish from texture to mouthfeel. It was very different than anything I had tasted to this point and it's very unique. Worth picking up a bottle, but for $12+, it won't become an everyday staple for me."
"D: Very nice beer. It's smooth and it has some nice malt characteristics. This can bee slugged back pretty well."
"A bit too much sourness for me, but otherwise a fine beer. If Mikkeller lost the twang and focused a little more on the oatmeal, malt and smoke, this would be a world-beater."
"In the hierarchy of Mikkeller's Geek beers, Rauch Geek Breakfast is my least favorite (thus far). It's damn tasty beer and shows just how strong Mikkeller's roster is. I like the smoky flavor, but it's not something I'd want all the time. I would've like a little bit of bacon in the nose and flavor, but it's still good beer. If you can handle smoky beers, check this one out. It's not Mikkeller's best in the Geek line, but it still Rauchs."
"Black bodied beer with a thick, dense, hefty brown head supported on top. Retention is outstanding as is lacing. Nice aroma of smoke, char, tobacco, chocolate and roast. Char hits the palate first. Then dark chocolate, tobacco juice, leather and greasy bacon. Very good all around. A little acridness, but fitting for the style. Actually some sweet malt underneath all the roast and chocolate that peeks its head out once in a while. Lot of character as usual with Mikkeller."
"Overall, a good ImpStout but was hoping for some more rauchbier elements in it. Maybe a little aging would have toned down the vanilla and allowed other elements to shine through. Recommend if you can easily find. Not avail in TX so got from Ummagum. Rotation - glad I tried it but one is enough [N;O]"
"Full body, a little dry and chewiness in the feel. Smooth and tasty drinking, which goes down faster than usual, especially with the relatively lower ABV. One of my favorite smoked stouts I've tried so far."
"D: Very good drinkability, consumed at 50-55F. Alcohol at 7.5% is hardly a factor, you'll be to mesmerized by the huge smoky roasted nature and smooth consumption. Silky smooth on the down."
"Once again, Mikkeller impresses me. Keep up the great work, sir!"
"I poured from a bomber into a snifter. Jet black pour with a slight tannish head, slight lace. The aroma is thick with smoke. The beer has a heavy smoke flavor, light chocolate, and some coffee. The body is medium, and it is lightly carbonated. IMO this is just ok. There are better smoked stouts out there and the body is kinda light for an imperial stout."
"Drinkability -- Wow. This one is definitely for a specific clientele. One of the smokiest beers I've ever had. Interesting, good, but not great. Had no problem finishing my taster, but beyond that may have been tricky."
"drinkability: sipper - but nice"
"Poured into a Maredsous glass, black dense liquid with a dark tall mocha head, a bit fizzier head then i would have liked for this style. Smell is all bacon and smoked meat, smoldering bbq wood planks, a tiny malt presence. Taste follows smell, very smokey, toasted malt, typical rauchbier flavors, bacon, and a hint of coffee. Mouth feel is medium bodied with a low carbonation, slightly coating. The smokey flavors are too strong and overpowering in this brew to make me want more then a small pour."
"This is a full-bodied brew whose smokey aromas and flavors become more pronounced as it is allowed to breathe. Residual sugar cuts the astringency and makes this a sticky beer. Mikkeller with another awesome Geek Breakfast offering. Five star. "
"Drinkability - well, I wouldn't drink more than one bottle but that has nothing to do with how good this is, its more to do with this not being a beer that you'd want to session that is for sure."
"I only wish I'd saved this to bring back to @LaitueGonflable and @tobeerornottobe. They would have got a kick out of this. You probably will too."
"Alot of thin coffee flavor here, and the smoke drops off quite a bit in the tasting. Roasty malts with an understated sweetness/hop interplay. Mouthfeel lacks a bit, which is one of my main complaints with Mikkeller (along with the price). More creaminess and less astringency, please. That said, it does ring true with the original beer geek breakfast and fans of it should like this one as well. I think it is a decent beer, but typically overpriced."
"Complex and full of character, a ""coffee and cigarettes"" eye opener for the tastebuds."
"mouthfeel is very rich and coating. i like this beer, but the nature of the style doesn't make this the most drinkable style. it's good for a bottle, but this isn't something i'd throw back glass after glass. the smokiness just kinda wears on my taste buds after awhile."
"This is a monster. Thick, tannic as all hell, long long finish, bakers chocolate, very bitter, black fruits in the middle, light on the palate with a delicate creaminess. If not so bitter would score a bit higher otherwise another fantastic stout in this series. Earthy, peaty, and tobacco laden. Nice."
"D: This brew is very likable, there is a nice character to it and it could appeal to many different people. Not overly smoky and very nice balance of all flavors."
"After comparing this to my year-old review of BGB, it appears as if both the bacon version and the regular are really similar in all aspects, aside from the smoked malt character. Very fortunate to have been able to try both types and I'd say that these Beer Geek beers are more than worth of your trying!"
"Drinkability is fairly good, with an appealing smell and an interesting flavor. Definitely a sipper as the flavors come alive as you let the brew warm up. Haven't had the regular Beer Geek Breakfast to compare, but this gets me quite interested. A great start to my Mikeller beer experience."
"D- Not the most extreme smoked beer I've had, but very enjoyable- would pair well with a very sharp cheddar, or a steak. As far as the other beer geek line-up goes, I enjoyed this more than the breakfast, but far less than the weasel."
"Cheers..."
"Not as challenging a beer as it would seem, a more intense stout without the sweetness or syrupy qualities that plague imperials (those that border barleywines). Tasty, meaty, more roasted than smoky."
"If you don't like rauschbiers than you won't like this one. Strongly bitter coffee and moderately smoky bitterness, it does not taste like bacon...I am so sad right now. But once you get over the fact that this is not liquid bacon you realize that it's a well-crafted smoked stout. The flavors are balanced, the smoke doesn't overpower everything else, the oatmeal adds a velvety mouthfeel and the bitterness ends puts a definitive end to the experience without dragging it out."
"Had this at Deep Ellum in Boston. Served in a tulip and was so good I had two. I wish I could compare it to the infamous Kate the Great by Portsmouth Brewery, but as of yet, I have not had her... Thus this is my gold standard. It was full of flavor; layers of coffee, dark malt, appropriately bitter."
"The smell continues the session with almost equally impressive results.  I get strong scents of dark chocolate and a touch of hops. Before trying as many smoked beers as I've been fortunate enough to have encountered, I may have thought this had a very strong smoked presence.  However, it's actually right in the middle compared to others and is very well integrated and pleasant.  The beer's aroma is really reminiscent of cured bacon and I can easily see where the name comes from.  A touch of campfire, some coffee, and (maybe I'm imagining things) maple syrup round the nose out."
"The mouthfeel is creamy, with both the body and carb working together wonderfully.  It is just a hair under perfection due to just a touch of watery character in finish. However, for a smoked beer, that probably helps to make it not just tolerable but very drinkable. Think of it this way - Mikkeller probably lost a 1/2 point in mouthfeel and gained it in drinkability.  A fine tradeoff if you ask me. This is simply a great beer!  Probably the best smoked stout I've ever had!!!  Seek it out, it is worth the price!  "
"Pours near black with a thing off white to tan head. Smell really brings out both the coffee and the smoke, which turns out to be a really lovely interaction. Taste is about the same, with a great competitive dynamic between the two. Nice amount of roasted malt in the background. Medium body with good carbonation; quite smooth. Drinks incredible well, especially for a smoked beer. Normally, 4oz. or so of something like that is already getting to be a bit much for me."
"Taste isn't too bacon-y but it's certainly smokey and meaty. Very rich and roasty. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Overall a very interesting beer."
"D: Overall, this is extremely pleasing. Best consumed slowly to allow flavors to develop as the liquid warms. Availability and price keep me from consuming more."
"While terribly disconcerted over their hop choice for this otherwise terrific stout, everything else was well done. Still a fine brew."
"D - Wow. It's a good thing this snifter was shared. That's a pretty smokey rauchbier. A little over-the-top with the smoke, it could easily be brought down a notch or two."
"Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice big stout that incorporates smoke very well."
"I thoroughly enjoyed the Beer Geek Breakfast, as well as the Brunch Weasel, so expectations are high for this one. It pours a lovely onyx topped by over a finger of decently dark and rich brown foam. The nose comprises molasses, chocolate syrup, smoked ham hock, charcoal, and a twinge of maple syrup somewhere in there Waldo-style. The taste is very similar, with the charred and smoky flavors accentuated further and some cocoa powder sprinkled all over the proceedings. This stuff is damn tasty, son! The body is fairly hefty, with a relatively light carbonation, which is masked by the thick, chewy feel. Overall, my high expectations were definitely met. Good work, Mikkel!"
"It pours an obsidian black with a rich coarse brown finger of foam to adorn the surface. The aroma is of chocolate and smoked malts. In addition there is the smell of char and I might just be imagining this but the alcohol flavor which is well hidden comes through as oranges. The taste is very much the same. There is smoked malts and cocoa powder with an addition of coffee to add some mild bittering. The hints of orange are also detected as if to complete the breakfast flavor. The taste is not as smokey as I would like, and it should be rated higher in taste were it not for the fact that I don't taste the bacon. The mouthfeel is exquisite. This is one of the smoothest stouts I've ever had, and as an imperial, that's saying something. This does have a higher ABV so it's not sessionable, but I had no problem sipping this all day due to the smoothness. Overall a damn fine beer and a high recommendation from myself."
"Drinkability: Personally, I'd hoped for more smoke as it warmed, but no dice. Still, a tasty treat to sit with down at the pub."
"D: I can totally see what they were shooting for but for my money it's missed the mark. I had trouble choking down the last few sips of this one."
"I love the idea of a smoked oatmeal stout. However, I don't enjoy the smoked flavor so overdone that it's basically ash. It's decent overall and doesn't force you to choke it down; I simply expected a better beer from Mikkeller."
"Poured a motor oil black with a thin head and it did leave some lacing sticking to the glass. The nose was not as smokey as I anticipated but I did spot out roastiness, chocolate flavors I believe were from the malts and I also sniffed out slight underlying hop notes. Like I suspected there was slight hop bitter character on the palate with a mild smokey roastiness, chocolate malts, and burnt grain notes. The brew was medium to full in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a very slight sweet, but smokey, roasty, and hop bitter finish. It drank pretty good but to me is not one of my favorites beers from mikkeller. Out of all the breakfast beer I'd go with the brunch weasel."
"D - Smoky, roasty and astringent. OK, but not more than half of a bottle (shared by Dankbeers619. Thanks!)"
"D- Probably never again. It was a huge let down. Yes, rauch means smoke but you don't get to put bacon on the label and hold out on me in that respect. It may have been easy to drink, but the flavors are nothing to write home about."
"The drinkability is a little lower as it coats the mouth and sticks to it for a while, the briney taste is a little bleh, typical for a super roasted breed but comes out too much here, but drinks well for abv bringing just a little warmth and boost taste."
"I have no problem admitting smoked beer is not my favorite thing. I will also admit this is a good beer. Getting past the smoke is the hardest part, once that is accomplished the drinkability increases considerably. Definitely a beer that deserves a look."
"Notes: Pretty good beer. Like I said, I just wished it was a bit more bacon/meaty smoke flavor than smoked wood. Also the smokiness hides a bit of the chocolate and coffee and oat flavors as well. Overall it is an enjoyable stout and smells wonderful, but I prefer the Weasel Brunch more. That said it is a good beer worth a try, although for the price I might not get another."
"Think smokey stout. This is no where near as good as weasel, no way. its only mildly smokey, mostly roasty, finishes a little dry, medium bodied, its pretty drinkable for a rauch beer but its not as good as i had hoped."
"This is a fairly drinkable stout that really does have bacon qualities. I would recommend pairing it with something sweet to offset the salty and greasy bacon."
"HUGE disappointment in the bottle, does not add to the weasel at all, a little smoke on the nose but just a boring average rauch here."
"D: Pretty good. I really like it. Solid brews. Happy Bday to me. Thanks Bosse for sending this one across the pond."
"D: Very nice overall, a good stout though I would like to have a bit more of the smoked flavor."
"16.9 ounce bottle. Served in a DFH signature glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with an inch frothy tan head. Head retention is good, with a lot of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is excellent, there's plenty of smoke/peat/bacon noticable, along with some dark chocolate, coffee and roasted malt. Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, it's very smoky and roasty! There's also a good lingering smoky finish. Although I think the aroma is smokier than the taste, this is still a pretty tasty brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and coating with low carbonation. This brew is smooth and very easy to drink. It's easily the smokiest brew I've had lately, and a pretty good overall brew in general."
"Super, really enjoyed the totality of this beer. Mikkeller continues to impress."
"Not as good as the standard Beer Geek Breakfast, but still an interesting brew. I'd like to see the coffee tempered to let more of the smoked malt flavors come through."
"Oily opaque black with a thick collar for a head. Burnt bacon aroma, like bacon left in the frying pan for an hour too long; this is tarry, salty and burnt stuff. Tastes better than it smells, tarry and burnt, meaty and smokey. Medium-bodied, thankfully not too syrupy or burnt. Semi-sweet finish with strong roast and smoke. The aroma is fairly offensive, but it doesn't taste bad. Decent."
"D: As with the other Beer Geek Breakfast brews, this one is good, tasty, solid. But at $10 a bottle, I'm not going to come back to it; it needs to knock my socks off for that."
"I also made a burger to go with it, i caramelized some onions with some cane sugar, sherry, butter, olive oil, salt, pepper, and some bacon bits, mixed in some smoked mozzarella, then put a spoonful on an elk burger and covered that with a slice of smoked gouda. The flavor combo was out of this world."
"I bet this would pair amazingly with some eggs and bacon. I have a feeling I'd like a beer from the Beer Geek series no matter what, even if they put shit in it. Wait..."
"Drinkability - So so. An interesting beer, though I really don't think I'd ever pick it up again. Glad I was able to try it."
"Overall enjoyable, a nice smoked imperial stout, though the ""bacon"" moniker had me anticipating something savory and meaty."
"D- Fairly high, a winner. I'm a big fan of rauchbiers and it translates wonderfully to a stout like this. Highly recommended."
"D- A pretty aggressively roasty beer."
"I picked this up in Chicago for $10.49 this week, 1pt .9oz bottle. It pours dark brownish black, completely opaque, a few fingers of tan foam and dried lace on the glass. The beer smells and tastes perfect, this is exactly the way I want a smoked stout to be. Smoked malts and dried meats, like beef jerky mixed with brown sugar, this is so addictive. A little chocolate in the aftertaste too, and a long lasting flavor of coffee in the aftertaste. The body is creamy like an oatmeal stout, nice match for the rich flavors. I want to see this available in OH."
"Drinkability is ok. Way too smokey."
"d - A very interesting smoked stout. I thought it looked amazing and had a great feel to it. It also smelled pretty good, but wish the taste wasn't as bitter. Would try again."
"This beer appears a deep shade of black, with hints of brown only detectable at the crest when held up to the light. The beige head is surprisingly small and recedes quite rapidly, leaving only faint traces of lacing. The aroma is remarkably similar to the non-smoked version, Beer Geek Breakfast, as the smoky aspect is more subdued than I would have guessed. The beer has a nice flavor, with roasted and burnt malt taking center stage. The smoke flavor is a welcome addition, and integrated nicely. The body is medium-thin. There is noticeable bitterness in the finish from the charred malt that lingers in the tongue between sips. This is a good beer and worth trying. It's a nice variation of the original."
"Thanks to the staff at Winchester Wine and Spirits for hooking me up with this bottle. This one pours out completely black, with a large, creamy tan head. The smoke isn't the first thing that leaps out at me with the smell. More dark chocolate, oatmeal, char, and molasses. That smoke/meat character does show up more as the beer gets warmer. The taste kicks thing up a notch, as this is really reminiscent of the campfire. Not so much meaty, as just straight up earthy smoke; Think wood and pine needles. It comes off a little astringent at times, as that smoke taste is very intense, and bitter in some places. Mouthfeel is medium, not quite as big as the regular Beer Geek or Brunch Weasel. I had no trouble finishing off this bottle, though I expect you need to really like smokey beers to fully enjoy this one. Final thoughts are that this is a smoked beer lovers dream come true. This is about as intense as it gets with this style from what I can tell."
"Overall, this is a solid smoked stout. Probably one of the better smoked beers I have had. Lots of different layers to this beer. Great drinkability. I dig it."
"Poured from a bottle into my Zatec Fluted glass. About a finger and a half of dark brown head with not much retention. No lacing to speak of. Smells of smoke and coffee. Not much else. Tastes like smoke. Thought I got a hint of coffee, but then, oh wait, smoke. Very foamy, nice mouthfeel. Finishes very dry. Interesting beer. Not my favorite, but interesting."
"Draft. Poured as Mikkeller Rauch Geek Breakfast. Smoky smell dominates the nose. Dark black pour with a slight tan head. Coffee notes as well. Sweet upfornt with smoke taste that builds as you sip and the beer warms. Medium mouthfeel. Slight bitter ending. Not a huge smoke fan but this one is ok in my book. Glad I tried it but nothing I would seek out."
"D: I was totally in the mood for this and it didn't disapoint in the least. On the contrary. To me it set new standards for what to expect from a smoked oatmeal coffee stout! Phenominal!"
"This is a fantastic beer. I'm a big fan of smoked beers, so this one really hit the spot. Mikkel really knows how to make a stout as I've rarely had a bad one. That said, with this beer, you better like smoked meat!"
"Another solid effort from Mikkeler."
"DB- Very surprised to hear that people think this is overly smoky. It really isn't drastically different from Beer Geek Breakfast, just a bit of smoke on top of what is already one of the best Oatmeal Stouts there is. Coffee + Smoke + Roast Malt = A+."
"D: It seems some brewers just way overdo the smoke in these kinds of beers. While I enjoy some smoke flavor in certain beers (like a porter or stout), this was like sucking down the smoke of a campfire."
" The thing I like about this beer is the level of smoke. It is not overwhelming, but it is definitely there and goes really well with the traditional stout characteristics. Other than that, everything is basically pretty normal, except that this beer is notably smooth and drinkable. I keep on wanting to savor the smoke!"
"D- It's a good stout, but a failure as a rauch beer. I'd order this again if I was in the mood for a stout, but as far as the taste is concerned, this is a rauch beer in name only."
"Overall I was a fan of this beer and thought the smokiness was well done. It didn't overpower the beer and instead augmented what is already a nice beverage. Worth a shot."
