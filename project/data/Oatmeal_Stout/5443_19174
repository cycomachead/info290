3.79,-1,3.75,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Pours a clear, deep brown having a garnet hue at the edges when held to the light, producing 2+ fingers of tan, shortlived, foamy head that leaves a stringy wash of thin lace. Aroma is led by rich dark coffee followed closely by deeply roasted malt & nuts in a background that hints of woody vanilla, chocolate, molasses & a faint touch of dark fruit. Taste is less robust than the nose: coffee & roast, dark malts, hints of char, dark unsweetened cocoa & cola. The lightly dry finish exhibits char, unsweetened cocoa & low cola like sweetness. Aftertaste is dry, bitter chocolate, roast & a more exaggerated burnt note than in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, low-moderate carbonation, creamy but not as chewy as expected from the oats, with a light prickly bite beginning at midsip and lasting through the finish.","mothmanscott","Mar 07, 2015"

4.15,8.4,4,4,4.25,4,4.25,"truly a beauty, and from a brewery i never heard of before this one, its a real pleasant surprise. dark brown pushing black, shiny but not letting hardly any light in, the head is an inch high, settles but keeps stiff peaks like well beaten eggs. great nose too, coffee and roasted unmalted barley meet right in the middle, with the coffee taking the lead on the taste. i get a little sweetness to this, although i dont think its a milk stout, it just has that sweet body and lingering finish, a fantastic medium to transfer these flavors, early bitter coffee, but more balanced than most of its peers. its still a beer, yet the coffee does something unique to this. fresh brewed coffee all the way though, i love how the carbonation rises up at the end and crisps up a medium bodied finish. soft and delicate in feel, but about as robust as they come in terms of flavor. the use of coffee here is as good as any. while the base beer is great and distinct, i think the use of coffee rivals the best in the business, the very best. my first beer from bent river had my palate wet for many more. love this.","StonedTrippin","Apr 01, 2014"

Pours black in color with a very small thin tan head. LOTS of lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma of fresh black espresso coffee hits you right up front with some roasted malt. The taste is pretty much as would be expected with the smell. Black coffee with a hop finish BUT not overpowering at all. This is a great sipping brew and not a 'chugging' type of beer.

4.62,20.6,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer (and Bent River's Jalapeno brew) were the two beers that got me hooked onto microbrews, from the generic, everyday beers that I was accustomed to. I can't help but to stop into Bent River and have at least one pint of Uncommon every time I happen to find myself in the Moline area.","xTrashcat","Mar 17, 2012"
3.88,1.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"As stated, this is a coffee beer. Very coffee, not just a little. So if you don't like coffee, don't drink it. My advice is try it if you can, because if you can, you are probably in the Quad Cities and your options are limited. And some batches seem to hit the spot. And, as an annual visitor, the brewery seems to be getting a grip on the Quality Control and achieving more consistency with their flagship beers, of which this is one.","sprucetip","Jan 15, 2012"

4.2,9.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Notes: I first had this beer shortly after I turned 21. It was one of the first stouts I had (other than Guinness) and helped expand my concept of what beer can be. I thought ""coffee in beer, that's crazy!", but ended up enjoying it. I don't care for coffee itself, so I knew there must be something special about it. Close to two years later, it still holds up as an excellent stout. With the coffee and oatmeal flavors, I can't help but compare it to Founders Breakfast Stout, one of my favorite beers. I'd label it Breakfast Stout's baby brother, but that's still high praise!","Josievan","Jan 30, 2010"
4.12,7.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This beer is for coffee lovers. The Uncommon Stout is very similar to the Oatmeal Stout (in fact, it is their Oatmeal Stout infused with coffee). I thought I could detect a coffee flavor in the Oatmeal Stout, and then I tried the Uncommon. The coffee flavoring completely dominates the beer. That isn't bad as long as you like coffee. I personally enjoyed the Oatmeal Stout better, but this is a good beer too. Get Bent!","Cubsfan1087","Jan 12, 2010"

3.92,2.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"I find it odd that Bent River doesn't inject the word 'Coffee' or 'Mocha' or 'Java' into the name. The one they settled on is still appropriate, though, since Uncommon Stout is uncommonly good. I now plan to 'Get Bent' whenever the opportunity presents itself.","BuckeyeNation","Aug 05, 2007"
4.37,14.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"This beer is a treat. While the coffee was dominant in the flavor and aroma, it did not overpower the roasted malt, chocolate or hop presence. I was pleasantly surprised by the balance in flavors that it displayed. I was also amazed that a beer with such outstanding flavor and body could be so drinkable.","brandtr3","Jan 19, 2007"
4.57,19.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"One heck of a brew pub stout. I'm a bit of a sucker for a nice, strong coffee stout, so I might be a little biased here, but I'd certainly endorse a trip to Bent River for this beer alone!","mynie","Nov 26, 2006"
4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and smooth with a slight creamy aspect. Not overly heavy, but still had enough to make itself known. Even in the oppresively hot sun this was still tasty. I'm hoping to try it again sometime and I could see myself having a few. If you enjoy coffee stouts I'd say give this one a go!","orbitalr0x","May 28, 2006"
3.33,-13.1,3.5,3,3,4,4,"Thats pretty much a big ol coffee beer alll right. Big aroma of roasted coffee, fortunately not too bitter. Clearly the fact that its one of BRs regular brews has meant theyve kept working on it. The brewmaster told me hes had some business types slam three or four pints of this the night before a big presentation, then call back to complain that they couldnt get to sleep at all. So he makes sure everybody knows that this not a ""coffee roast malt"" beer; this is a beer with lots of coffee in it! And its pretty tasty, too.","DrunkMcDermott","Sep 22, 2005"
