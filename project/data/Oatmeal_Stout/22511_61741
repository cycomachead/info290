4.42,3,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Picked this up in a great trade with Evan!  2013 Vintage.  Creamy pitch black pour with a gorgeous two finger caramel-colored head with great retention and crazy lacing.  Big nutty, roasty nose with tons of fresh brewed coffee along with hints of oats, toast, espresso, toffee, burnt sugar, and subtle cocoa.  The taste is also very coffee forward with tons of roasty malt, toasted oats, leather, tobacco, toffee, vanilla, espresso, and cocoa.  The mouthfeel is creamy and mouth-coating with light carbonation, subtle sweetness, and a velvety smooth, dry, bitter finish.  Overall, some of the most intense coffee flavor I've tasted in a coffee stout.  Another great offering from Hill Farmstead.","beerdrifter","Nov 08, 2014"

Flavor is typical of an oatmeal stout, creamy and smooth, with a silky body, and a strong chocolate and malt body throughout. Minimal bitterness, but strong fresh coffee flavor throughout. Much more robust and enjoyable experience than the BA version of Earl.","yourefragile","Nov 22, 2011"

4.58,6.8,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Roasted barley and coffee aromas, luscious malt. The taste confirms and enhances upon the smell. The rich creaminess of the oats is the bed for the roasted flavor to lie upon. Laps of luxury from the glass. Beautiful creamy mouthfeel without any acridness from the roast at all. Terrifically balanced.","dragonWhale","Sep 02, 2011"
4.18,-2.6,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall: Another Hill Farmstead brew..another beer right at the top of its class. Exceptional for a coffee stout. While this is not my favorite style, the coffee is not too bitter but it is highly present. If I were to reach for a coffee stout, this is where I would go to.","tigg924","Aug 29, 2011"

3.97,-7.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"O - Fantastic stout and I'm lucky I got to try this again. Complex, yet exceptionally drinkable. Adds great variety to the HF portfolio.","ChrisPro","Aug 23, 2011"
3.53,-17.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O - Not a huge fan of this beer, it's solid, but not an upper-class brew like I've come to expect from Hill Farmstead. Too much char for me, just didn't care a ton for the flavor profile as much as I thought I would.","AgentZero","Aug 21, 2011"
3.75,-12.6,4,4,4,2.5,3.5,"O - Enjoyable, but the thin body and hints of coffee hurt the overall score of this one. Wishing for more coffee and medium to full body but I guess I can't have everything. Good, not great.","Sean9689","Aug 16, 2011"
4.05,-5.6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"D - It's a nice stout, but not as good as Everett. I think I'd like this if there was more coffee presence.","MasterSki","Aug 05, 2011"

4.27,-0.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a very, very dark brown color with a good off-white head and some really nice lacing on the way down. The nose brings forward some really nice coffee along with some roast and earthy characteristics. A bit of chocolate in the background as well as some hops. The flavor has nice coffee character along with some roast. Chocolate throughout. Mouthfeel is really excellent and the oats come through. No noticeable booze. Really a fantastic stout.","Thorpe429","Jun 03, 2011"
4.1,-4.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Earl look black, blackie, its a black ale with a little bit of sugar on top with small spots of lace. up to light, Earl look black. Earl smell roasty and oaty with a deep sweet caramel scent and oats with chocolate rounding it out. Hops are present in the nose, it's a well rounded scent. Earl is one of the richer oat stouts I've had recently. Notes of cocco/chocolate, mounds of oats and even a mild hop bite towards the end. I get a bunch of roasted coffee with some warming, where did that come from? Like I said Earl is well rounded, but he is not fat with soaring alcohol, 7% is fine with me, it drinks like it should be more though, but that's what I like, a lot of taste with not a bunch of alcohol. Feel is a bold medium with adaquate carb. I coulda drank a pint of this if it was not summer and it was not the beginning of my day. I cant quite place this, it hits many styles in one","BARFLYB","May 11, 2011"
4.33,0.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"An excellent CDA/stout from the brewer at farmstead hill. While I don't believe Shaun Hill's ability as a brewer quite compares to the genius of Shawn Kelso at Barley Brown, he's awfully damn close. Just an excellent beer from Farmstead Hill.","John_M","May 05, 2011"
4.47,4.2,4.5,5,4.5,4,4,"This black as midnight stout beer has a strong coffee aroma. A slight tannish head indicates the beers stoutness. Though it is a stout the mouthfeel is not overwhelming thick. It's thick but drinkable. The coffee flavor is more chocolatey than burnt or bitter. Though hints of burnt coffee peak through from time to time. It went very well with my portbello white bean burger at the Farmhouse Tap & Grill in Burlington VT.","angelogarcia3","May 04, 2011"
4.45,3.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall, a really impressive coffee stout and the second beer from Hill Farmstead I've had that I thought was bordering on greatness, if not there already. Definitely thrilled I had a growler of this. Worth the effort to get.","Gosox8787","Jan 17, 2011"
4.52,5.4,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Growler from Glouglouburp- thanks again Dany! Pours opaque cola with frothy two finger head. Huge delicious coffee nose, slight chocolate, but mostly just unbelievable coffee. Taste- a juicy tart twang from the oatmeal, slight bitterness, and tons of fresh roasted coffee . Fantastic. Drinkability is off the charts. Very light bodied but yet the flavour profile is amazing and the freshness of the coffee really shiines through. HF really nailed this","oakbluff","Jan 10, 2011"
3.97,-7.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"D - Pretty high. I wish more brewery could brew a well balanced stout like this one. I liked it quite a bit but it was just good not great. I would definitely drink it again.","orangesol","Jan 07, 2011"

4.1,-4.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"M/D: Medium bodied with great carbonation. Overall, very nice. I was glad that the coffee wasn't in the forefront. The sweetness from the oatmeal was really nice as was the little bit of hops.","mdaschaf","Jan 06, 2011"

4.27,-0.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Chewy full body with a great balance of roasted coffee bean, silky, luscious dark chocolate, oatmeal, toffee and bitter hops. Slight lactic character adds creaminess and fullness to the body and greatly increases the drinkabilitu. I'm actually surprised how well balanced this is. I was expected it to be more acrid and bitter even though the aroma didn't suggest that. Slight citrus and earthy pine hops add complexity. This is a very well crafted, extremely quaffable coffee beer. Not very extreme but damn good.","corby112","Dec 19, 2010"

4,-6.8,4,4,4,4,4,"a stout with an exceptional nose. Pour is about two fingers. Nose of toasted malt and rose water at first. This fades after the first sip and the true chalk burn coffee grounds comes out. This combines with the hops to leave a dead dry tongue. Beer isn't quite soapy but just a tad smoked acidic.","rtepiak","0"

3.95,-7.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Mmmm oatmeal, you make my beer so smoooth. A light pillow of coffee and dark chocolate with some brown sugar sprinkled on top coats the mouth. The body on this one is less than you expect when you see it, a lot less in my opinion. It works well with this beer though, increasing the drinkability, but I would not think this beer would age well.","naproxen","Sep 09, 2010"
