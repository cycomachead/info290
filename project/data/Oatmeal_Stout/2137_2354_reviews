"Overall : I enjoy the beer but there's a lot wrong with it. First off, there's no oatmeal. If you're going to advertise ""oatmeal stout"" on the label, I should be able to detect it with one of my five senses. This is very much an English Stout, as it's a bit too intense for a milk or sweet stout and is wreaked with kilned malts. Drink it ice cold, because as it warms up its flaws become glaringly clear. It's basically very burnt and charred, mixing with some dark chocolate and dirt and hop. It's decent but not outstanding."
""
""
"Overall: A solid stout beer, very drinkable. I would have it again."
""
""
""
"Pitch black with a small tan head. Smells like roasted malt and coffee. Taste is mostly roasted malts with a little bit chocolate. Has a medium mouth feel, more light than it is full."
""
"O:  Solid beer; probably won't have again, though."
"Overall: I remembered not being very impressed with this last time. True, it's not the smoothest, richest, most flavorful oatmeal stout, but it has a nice balance of fairly subtle flavors and it's pretty drinkable."

"dark pour, decent taste not bad, not amazing."

"Overall:  This is a good, solid, well crafted, oatmeal stout.  Nothing spectacular, but a very solid beer.  Certainly worth a drink."
""
"Dark mahogany colored and nearly opaque, but ruby highlights appear at the edges.  Low oatmeal colored head recedes quickly.  Aroma of toasted malt and cocoa, some leather notes.  Rich flavor of dark malt, some cocoa, subtle charred bark and root beer, leather and roast in the finish.  Slightly watery mouthfeel, finishes tingly, I expected more body.  It's tannic and woody and talcy at the same time.  Seems to straddle the dry stout style.  Drinkable, but off style."
"V - Medium."
""
"Ryan: Initial taste ok. Terrible, bitter, smokey aftertaste. Chocolate flavor absent. Would not drink again."

"One of my very first oatmeal stout's.  Very dark, coffee smell, but not over powering.  For me, the finish was dry and that is how I like it.  It has a low ABV 4.95% for a stout, but is perfect if you want a light oatmeal stout.  The burnt dark chocolate is my favorite note in this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very solid stout. Not very complex, but tasty. Granted this is from the tap at their brewery, so out of the bottle it could be disappointing."
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all, a very drinkable stout."

"I really liked this, most stouts i try end up being to sweet for me, this one was prefect, great dry after taste. nice malty heft with some raisin and pumpernickel flavors ,some dark chocolate but not really sweet, I think this is very good american stout."
""
"Breck's stout is pretty good, though it's not my very favorite beer of theirs.  The oatmeal base adds a nice flavor that's a little different than a milk stout, and it's not quite as midnight black colored, but it's tasty.  Very low alcohol for this style, which means you can have a few if you want without too much trouble.  Definitely smooth and very drinkable."

"This is a very good oatmeal stout. I'm liking it. At just under 5%, it'd be an excellent stout to session on a cool fall evening or in the winter while shoveling or blowing the snow. Well worth trying."

"Creamy sweetness upon first wash of the palate. Slight bitterness more prevalent at tip and along back of tongue as it warms and you drink more of it. A bit thinner than anticipated. Fantastic with grilled sausage. Overall a nice offering in the oatmeal variety. Very nice to see these ales making a comeback. Personal favorites."

"This is a wonderfully opaque black beer with a dark tan head. There ends the good points. Smells of soy sauce, mushroom, green apples, sausage, and brown rice. Tastes like soy sauce, mushroom, oatmeal, sausage, and brown rice. The apple smell does not become an apple taste. Kind of thin feel, almost overwhelming bitterness and acridness."

"O: This seems like a miss. The flavor is off and the mouthfeel is not what I'd expect on an Oatmeal Stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"Still, all things considered, this is still a good enough beer to recommend a try. Keep your expectations at a moderate level and you should like it just fine."
""
""
"O-Nothing offensive about this one. Easy drinker, but missing some of the body and bigger, roasty flavors I might expect."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - not horrible but I would not buy another one. Disappointing on the flavor."
""
""
""
"Pours pitch black with a little ring of white foam. Roasted, espresso oatmeal nose. Hints of vanilla. Taste is rich and creamy, light chocolate, smooth finish. Some coffee grittiness. Oaty. Easy finish. Solid stout. Very nice."
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 2/23/2014. Pours clear nearly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roast, caramel, toast, dark bread, oats, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roast malt and moderate hop notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roast, caramel, toast, dark bread, oats, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Moderate amount of earthy herbal/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roast, toast, dark bread, oats, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/roast malt flavors with moderate hop presence; with nice robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, smooth, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 4.9%. Overall this is a very nice oatmeal stout. All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/roast malt and moderate hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
"Overall – A rather nice tasty stout that is on the lower adb. side. A good session style stout that packs lots of flavor and body even when not nitrogen poured."
""
""
""
"Very drinkable. Not over done in any area. Nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very nice stout. Not as strong as some imperial stouts, but I enjoyed the combination of hops and malts, with a very smooth mouthfeel. I bought a 6-pack of this beer, and it is definitely a stout I will buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, there's a million others that are better. The astringent coffee just puts the whole beer off"

"Pours a dark brown body, head is light tan. Bubbly foam, chunky lacing, nice cascading effect. Smell is of roasted cocoa and oats. Chewy taste, smoke, dry cocoa, bit of charcoal but feels underdeveloped. Feel is quite thin for a stout. Decent but not much more."
"I really enjoy this brew. Although it feels a bit watery, the roasted aspect of it makes up for it. The smell is a solid combination of roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate. The taste is just about the same, except that you're hit with tang on the sides of the tongue. I would probably get this again."

"O: Eh."
"O: A little much actually. I'm all for bold roasty beers, but this is like being beaten over the head with a blunt object. Overstated in the roasted malt department and average in every other way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was expecting, since it's an oatmeal stout, a more fuller feel. It drinks dry and bitter at the end. I'm thinking export stout here. It is good though."

"O: excellent oatmeal stout, I will pick this up again easily"
"Summary - Good. My first oatmeal stout. Seems to be the roasted, and somewhat bitter, cousin of the milk stout."
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Dark hue, slight head, slight lacing. Coffee, wood, and dark chocolate. Bitter and pungent, and roasty, coffee and dark chocolate. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
""
""
""
"Pours almost black in color, tiny bit of a brown head that dissipated quickly, no head when I started drinking. Smells of chocolate, nuttiness. Taste is fantastic, very smooth, I did not smell much coffee but it has a bit of a coffee flavor, along with chocolate, there is a tiny bitterness on the back of my tongue near the end. Very impressive, well balanced stout. A must try"
""
"O - this Oatmeal Stout comes across as a decent and very much within expectations. Not the best oatmeal stout, but still enjoyable."

"Overall: A good session stout. Easy drinking but it is nothing to write home about. I think it does have potential for improvement with altering of the recipe, specifically the oatmeal and chocolate ingredients."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad interpretation of the style, but not anything that I would keep going back to either. Good beer, but that is all it can claim in my view."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A passable beer, but thin for the style, both in terms of flavor and mouthfeel In the end, this one is not one which is worth the calorie count."

"Overall, a well done oatmeal stout, solid creaminess with a touch of stout roast and chocolate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I will certainly buy another sixer of this one. There aren't many oatmeal, dry Irish, or coffee stouts to be found around here (at least not real close) and I like to keep a moderate ABV stout on hand when I can."

"O: Overall, this is decent, but nothing memorable. I'd certainly drink another one if it was nearby, but this isn't a stout that I would purchase regularly. It's a tough market with so many flavorful dark beers out there, and this one doesn't stand out from the crowd."
"D - overall good but only at the right price not worth driving too far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavors of dark roasted malts, dark coffee, espresso beans, bitter grassy hops, minerals. Bigger dark roasted than sweet malt flavor and not that big in body overall, but tasty for its style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I think this beer is a good representation of what a stout should taste like. A nice nutty deep roast coffee and slight caramel are balanced nicely with a slight spicy hop characteristic. I am not sure what the oatmeal brings to this. Perhaps a more mealy type of malt taste? I am not sure. However I will definitely buy this again."

"O - I've been pleased w/ beckenridges full offering except the terrible Vinalla porter )yuk)"
"Two Words: Either ""Easy Drinkin'"" or ""Goes Flat"""
""
""
"O: Very standard for a craft beer. Somewhat disappointing. I've found better quality at a similar price point."
""
""
""
""
"A decent tasting oatmeal stout, something I certainly can see myself drinking again, and several at a time at that. However, it just doesn't taste or feel like an oatmeal stout, and so the scores reflect that."
""
"At under 5% alcohol, it wouldn't make much of a winter warmer, but it's a perfect apres-ski beer in Breck, and a nice roasty stout for any other occasion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Could have used a bit more creaminess but still had great flavor and is very drinkable stout. Solid example of the style"
""
""
"Overall, while not a big flavor it was pleasant to drink and strangely refreshing. Halfway decent chocolate/coffee flavor with some mild malt roastiness, liked the sweetness. Good beer, very drinkable, but nothing exceptional."
"A very impressive oatmeal stout; one that I'd buy six at a time in the future."
""
""
""
"Pours a pitch black, with a creamy tan head. aromas of fresh cocoa powder. Taste begins with some coffee, then a bit of dark caramel, then some molasses, then some earthy, citrusy hops. Mouthfeel is rich and smooth. Overall a nice oatmeal stout that I would get again."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of prickly carbonation. This was an ok offering that sort of missed the mark. The cola aspect was weird and it missed on the expected oatmeal inclusion in both flavor and feel. Its not a beer I would purchase again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The superb taste of this beer outweighs its deviation from the expected oatmeal stout style. This is the second Breckenridge Brewery beer I've sampled (SummerBright Ale being the other) and I've found both to have superior taste and drinkability. Breckenridge is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries. Even with its shortcomings, this is my favorite oatmeal stout and an excellent session beer."
"This is kind of just there. I would drink it again if I saw it, but it won't call my name if you know what I mean."
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent oatmeal stout. It is really like coffee with alcohol in the flavoring. It is less like beer, and more like the cold coffee."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good representation of the style except for the feel. I think the carbonation takes away from what the oats are there for, which is a smoother body. Not bad aside from that. Certainly nowhere near FBS, but this is a nice little substitute if there is none left or it isn't distributed in your area"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I can sum this beer up in just a few words: good, not great. Nothing stands out about it at all. Would I drink it again for free? Sure. Would I buy it? Probably not."
"Overall, this was a decent oatmeal stout. Not my all time favorite, but not bad either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-enjoyable and easy drinking, not my favorite of the style but would certainly drink this again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- not satisfied at all, but I will try this again if I find a fresh one. Again I think this is the liquor stores negligence and not the brewery's fault."
"O - Very good beer. Not as sweet as I thought it would be, but still delicious. If I could, I'd like to taste a little more sweetness, because then it may become my favorite stout. Still, it's a great one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Pretty tasty, the roastyness was a little surprising after the aromas was much sweeter. Still a very nice combination of mostly roasty and some sweet flavors. Quite drinkable too"
""
""
""
"Average stout, missed the mark on the texture/mouthfeel."
""
"Overall, a reasonably decent oatmeal stout, fairly standard. It's not incredibly flavorful or unique, but it's highly sessionable at 4.9% ABV. Balanced well with bitterness and sweetness, just nothing exciting going on, really. A little above average I'd say, but not much to see here."
"O - LIke I said, this is one of my favorites. I think this is one beer that Breck absolutely nails."
""
"Overall, this beer looks and smells more promising than it's taste which is fairly undistinguished. But it still beats water."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This stout is a classic in my book. It has all the characteristics that I desire in a stout. Tasty and robust."
"This is really an excellent Oatmeal Stout. It's rich without being too much; a great example of a below 5% beer with mounds of flavor. Two tongues up!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark with medium head. Roasty chocolate aroma, some sweetness. Flavor follows with big chocolate notes, some nice roast, and mild coffee. Does not finish with much bitter to balance the sweetness, but pretty smooth creamy mouthfeel. Found this to be a very nice stout."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Nicely done, but not going to knock your socks off. A pleasant, inoffensive, and fairly tasty stout. Could be heartier, but as it is it's a nice easy drinker. Fortunately or unfortunately, it's one of the few ""shelf"" stouts available in the area. I've picked it up before and I'll do so again."
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: If this was on nitro-tap I'd prefer it to a Guinness just for the oatmeal quality. While it's not the best of the style it's definitely a good beer. I applaud any beer that can achieve this level of enjoyment while retaining an abv under 5%."
"O- pretty damn good oatmeal stout!"
""
"Aroma of roasted dark malts includes a backbone of roasted coffee beans and dark chocolate. The flavour blends these elements, adding some oak tannins and a nicely dry finish that lingers for a decent length of time. Nice transition in the taste from sweet to bitter."
""
"O - Not the best oatmeal stout I have drank, but definitely a good one; would be happy to drink more of these in the future."

"This beer pours a dark brown with faint ruby tones under light. There's a thin tan head and lasting lace. The aroma is of cocoa, coffee, and a hint of wood. The flavor has oatmeal with maple syrup notes with dark chocolate, toast, and a hint of vanilla. The dark chocolate and vanilla show through more as it warms. It's mouthfeel is full and creamy with a pleasant warmth. Breckengridge Oatmeal Stout is a good brew, recommended!"

"O: Overall this is an excellent tasting, before bedtime beer that has a lot of flavor. If you are new to Oatmeal Stout or experienced in the brand, this is a definite go to!"
""
""
""
"Overall --- I am a huge fan of oatmeal stouts, and have tried several other breweries before this one… I must say, I was not impressed with it. I think it is an okay beer to drink, but would recommend other options of oatmeal stout out there before this one. I have heard good things about Breckenridge, this type of one from them is simply not for me."
""
""
"Beautiful deep mahogany brown with ruby hues, nicely lacing head, much roastier and robust than expected. Lots of cream, coffee, almost burnt toast, and sweetness of caramel with a bit of breadiness. So smooth. I highly recommend this underrated oatmeal stout."

""

""
""
"Overall - This is a nice sipping beer when your watching tv or playing some xbox. Im not sure what you could match it with, but it is great on its own."
"The body is light to medium with nice medium to heavy carbonation. Not bad as a nice easy drinking stout."
"Quite tasty, maybe enhanced by the rains and lower than normal temperature outside."

"O - A nice stout. Good blend of chocolate and coffee without being too much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Body is medium to medium-light with a slight bit of wateriness around the edges. No real faults for a beer with this low of an ethanol content. Carbonation is noticeable, but fairly low, appropriate for the lighter body. Resultant mouthfeel is smooth and mildly creamy, appropriate for the style. Finish is quite dry."

"Overall I'd say pretty solid, well balanced and enjoyable. I'd definitely drink again"

""
""
"It's a good oatmeal stout, very drinkable, very complex, good for those who may not know about them or want something mind-boggling."
""
""
"Okay so I'm kind of biased since oatmeal stouts are my favorite style of beer but this is an awesome brew! Pours a beautiful dark brown, almost black looking. You can't see thru the glass and for dark beer drinkers that's always a good sign lol. A night light lacey cream head to it, very small maybe quarter inch. Has a pleasant smell, kind of sweet but you can smell those nice dark malts. Very easy to drink, extremely smooth for a dark style beer. A nice balanced hop taste at first sip then you start tasting all the toasted malt flavor. This is one of my favorite brews by one of my favorite breweries."
""
"O- Overall, this is a fine oatmeal stout. At under 5%, this is a very drinkable beer as well. Recommended! "
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is very drinkable and borders on being more than sippable. The body is full and robust, allowing the flavors to really hit the palate, while never becoming sticky or coating. The carbonation is barely noticeable but does a great job in helping to move this beer over the tongue and down the throat."
""
"Bottle, pint glass"
""
""
""
"O: good beer, nothing really pops for me but thats ok. Everything mingles together nicely in this beer. Definitely worth a taste."
"Overall, I'm glad i took my time with this one. Dead cold, I disliked this. A bit warmer and I found it to be pretty decent. Not the best of the style, but a pretty good version."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It feels a bit lighter than I thought it would. Medium bodied. A little watery. The lingering hop bitterness is a little off putting but it's better than any other offering I've had from Breck."
""
"Taste is bitter and dry with a sharp and coffee like finish that lingers for a while. Mouthfeel is a bit light and overly carbonated for me. Overall its decent but not special."
"Otherwise, this overly roasty stout will always be a let down. However, if Breckenridge does ever change the flavors of this stout, I will gladly return to it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer with some flaws."
""
""
"O - Overall, It's definitely missing the body and creaminess, and the flavor is a bit too robust for me (may be right up someone else's alley). It's alright."
""
"Reviewed on: 01-19-2011 15:34:23"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I have found another beer I really enjoy. I will definitely have this again. It reminds me of Samuel Smith oatmeal stout. If you like porters or stouts this will trip your trigger."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very nice oatmeal stout. It's hard to find one that I don't like and the ABV is where it should be for this style."
""
""
"Dark roasted malts make for a background and let coffee flavors and a somewhat sweet milkiness spice them up. Hops add a bitterness in the back that is welcome to the style as the malts are not quite as fierce as they could be, but then again it is a pretty light ABV beer, so it makes sense. But still, a bit more of a kick from the malts, not the booze, would have accentuated some very nice flavors here instead of having a light-medium bodied beer. That said, its not a bad beer by any means. A prickly mouthfeel in the middle moves to a dry, more effervescent finish, aided by the balancing hops. I wouldn't turn this down, pretty solid beer here."
""
""
""
""
"Not the most complex stout in the world. It has a lot of charcoal flavor and not much else. It's good, I recommend it, and I will have another. However, I would't go out of my way to find it."
""
""
""
"O: The taste and mouthfeel were a bit of a letdown, but this isn't a bad Oatmeal stout. I did like the Rogue much more."
""
""
""
""
"Aromas include roasted coffee and bitter chocolate. Overall enjoyable because it's beer and would be happy to order it on tap if I saw it somewhere but there are a lot of oatmeal stouts out there. While not bad it's not great, middle of the road."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent and drinkable, but not chewy enough for an oatmeal stout."
""
""
"Pours a beautiful black with a two-fingered sized creamy tan head. There was an artificial sweetness smell that was kind of off-putting. Roasted oats and a little bit of sweet toffee. The taste was pleasing but it's really the feel of this beer that sets it off. Out of the bottle, it taste like a creamy draught. Kind of dry and just enough carbonation. Very on-point and true to the style of an oatmeal stout."

"Last beer for the night is a Breckenridge Oatmeal Stout...whilst wrapping gifts for my hellions. The beer pours dark opaque with thin ecru head that is not leaving a very good lace. The smell is mostly roast. Teh taste is slightly bitter with hints of roast espresso and dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is a medium to light body with good carbontaion. Overall it is a decent stout....but not out of this world. I was hoping for a bit more smooth and creamy."

"Breckenridge Brewery Oatmeal Stout: If you have read my other stout reviews, you know that American style stouts are just a bit too much beer for me. Still, I am cycling through a few stouts this month as a learning experience. The Breckenridge Oatmeal Stout is black, no surprise here, but the head was really thin, as was the aroma. Flavor was a meaty roast malt up front with some bitter coming on near the end. There is a lot of beer here, be warned. It would be hard for me to drink two, but this is the case for any American style stout. Overall, the Breckenridge offering is on par with other American Stouts I have tried."
"Overall, a full-bodied beer, deep chocolatey flavors that keep the beer interesting. The label does deliver; it is very smooth going down."

"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is an extremely dark, blood-red and ruby coloring with a thin, spaced bubble, light brown head that coats the glass. Nose of milk chocolate and bitter dark chocolate, with a touch of bitter dark coffee. Creamy smooth body, with flavors of dark roasted coffee, bittersweet cocoa nibs, and a good roasted feel. The beer has roast coffee and dark chocolate in the aftertaste, with a smooth initial finish, and a slight linger to the sweet characteristics. Tasty stout."

"Decent oatmeal stout, but some improvements could be made in my opinion (see above comments). Did enjoy and always appreciate a beer thats low in alcohol that has flavor."

"Overall this was a tasty beer to have on tap but I wouldn't go running out the door to pick up a 6 pack. More body and mouthfeel are my only complaints."

"This poured out as a deep brownish black color with a decent brown colored head that faded away rapidly. The smell of the beer is rich with burnt roasted aromas giving a light impression of chocolate on the nose. The taste of the beer is heavily roasted as well, there doesn't seem to be much in the way of transition from start to finish though. It's mouthfeel could have been a bit thicker. Overall this beer was decent in my opinion, I wouldn't turn it down if it was offered to me."

"Pours a two-finger light tan head that fades slowly and leaves some lace. Deep brown color, no highlights. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is roasted coffee and flavor is roasted to burnt coffee. 12oz bottle $2.29 from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."

"O - A really great stout, but not a lot of oatmeal-ness to it. I really like the lower alcohol also, as I could suck down a few of these in a sitting."
"Pours a dark, chalky black with minimal cap of tan, dense froth. Scent is of roasted grains with a mild sweet chocolate note and the faintest hint of dark fruit. Taste focuses on the roasted grain with solid chocolate notes, mild milky sweetness. Body is disappointing as oatmeal stouts are supposed to be creamy and not watery. Overall, this beer drinks like a porter in scent, taste and body."
"Overall this beer is pretty good with a complexity of smells and taste, however the mouthfeel seems thin for a porter, let alone a stout. I would still recommend giving it a try though."
"Thin and astringent, deep roasty flavor though. Lingering flavors of bitter unsweetened bakers chocolate, dark roast cafe mocha, graphite. The light body needs some improvement, though the flavors are approaching a bold level. Not a bad introductory stout, but it really left me wanting more."
"O - Its hard to believe this beer is only 5 percent alcohol. Its got some pretty kickin flavors"
"Overall this is a decent oatmeal stout but not one that blows me away. Glad I got to try it."
"O: A nice oatmeal stout. Oatmeal stouts are one of my favorite styles of beer and I appreciate when Oatmeal Stouts incorporate some bitterness into their flavor profile (while also enjoying that others dont). Breckenridge Brewery did a good job with that on this one while also capturing the roastiness and sweet ""oatiness"" I seek in the style. The thinness of this is a bit of a buzzkill and does limit its potential. Overall, it's a good oatmeal stout but won't be confused with the bests of the style."
"Overall, this is my favourite oatmeal stout, hands down. This beer really has everything I ask for: a great appearance, great taste, easy to drink, and low ABV. This beer is a staple in my fridge."
"Full-bodied, smooth...light carbonation. Nothing mind-blowing, but it's damn good and drinkable. I enjoyed it and I recommend it!"
"Overall - A solid, very accessible stout. Thinness translates to drinkability in this case. It’s not heavy, it’s not a tongue punch of bitterness. It’s a very quaffable, sweetened coffee kind of stout. Good for kicking off a session."
"So, after my last run in with Breckenridge (their Vanilla Porter with which I was quite disappointed), THIS was the beer I must have been remembering when I said I liked their stuff. This isn't a lifechanging beer by any means, but it is well worth picking up and trying some (if you're into that kind of thing). Check it out if you're looking for something dark. It's pretty good."
"an absolutely fantastic oatmeal stout. pours a rich burnt black with mocha fluff on top a full inch thick. smells of sticky dark malts, unrefined primitive sugars, and booze. mouthfeel is a little tiny bit thin, a heavier vibe would bode well for this one when its dark out at 4:30pm. taste is roasted malts, toasted dry oatmeal, and a cold bitter strong coffee finish. all of a sudden its gone. a perfectly satisfactory representation of elegance and precision, this is breckenridge brewery's best beer by a mile"
"Tastes like it smells with the addition of charcoal as a lingering, yet acceptable aftertaste. Damn drinkable."
"Great body! Thick, rich, full bodied, creamy and smooth."
"This pours an almost black color with light able to penetrate the edges, there is a nice mocha head with large bubbles which leaves a lacing. The smell is of roasted malts, oats, bread and a little chocolate. The feel is medium. The taste is a little light, but not bad a little more bread than roasted malts and oats, not as creamy as I would prefer."
"D - a nice oatmeal stout that's widely available (at least here in Colorado). Certainly a good choice."
"Overall: I enjoyed this oatmeal stout and would get another one in the near future whether here in Mass or out in Colorado when I go there in December. Easy drinking and has simple quality tastes that make this a well rounded beer."
"Overall decent. I'd have it if available but others out there are prefereable for a stout. (Sam Smith in particular is a favorite) Not bad."
"Drinkability: A very good oatmeal stout. I could have several of these. This is one of Breckinridge’s better beers."
"O - I bought this for being cheaper than most stouts I drink, and I was hoping it would be a good beer to keep on hand when I don't want to reach for the expensive stuff. It's a simple but enjoyable stout, and I think it fits the bill nicely."
"Pours out very dark brown in color. The head is tan and disappears quickly. See just a bit of lacing. Nose is of lightly roasted malts and coffee. Not getting much of anything else. Taste is bitter sweet. Getting a good amount of hops and roasted malts. Coffee is present in the finish. Mouth feel is average. Pretty smooth and a bit lite. Carbonation is higher than usual. Average oatmeal stout. Good but not great. I don't think I would go after this again."
"O: I wrote this brewery off after the 471 IIPA but this may have got them back in my good graces. Nothing mind blowing but a very easy going stout. Not many bad things to point out here, just a simple everyday kind of beer."
"O- I find myself disappointed by this one. It looked good, it smelled good, and then it hit my lips and just fell flat. I'd pass on it."
"O: Great Oatmeal Stout. A very well balanced and easily drinkable brew. I could drink this all day. One of the best oatmeal stouts I have ever had."
"Overall a good stout…. Prob. Have to pick this one up again."
"While writing this review, I keep going back to the glass for more smell and taste and I just notice that this is easily more than half empty now. I am quite enjoying this stout and will have to keep this on the list to watch for in the stores. This came from a Breckenridge sample pack that was on sale."
"12 oz bottle into Sam Adams glass. Pours a deep brownish-black with quickly dissapating one finger head but decent lacing. Smell of roasted coffee, chocolate, and burnt toffee. Coffee seems to be the dominating taste, a bit acrid (in a good way). Mouthfeel is well carbonated, nice and smooth. Overall a solid brew but less than world class."
"The mouthfeel is where I fall in love with Oatmeal Stouts and this one doesn't disappoint. Nice and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation."
"overall: for its intent as an oatmeal stout, it is rather subdued; but for a stout in general it is satisfactory."
"O/D - Highly drinkable. Goes down smoothly. No objections to having a few in a row."
"Poured opaque black (like a stout!) with a small cap of creamy, khaki head. Scents of dark, roasted malts, dark chocolate, oats and grains. Roasty taste, dark malts, dark chocolate, dark coffee, and a touch of smoke. Not much else to say: pretty basic, and pretty good. Full-bodied, smooth, and a quite drinkable stout overall."
"O-Revisit it again probably. It's a decent beer."
"O- I really enjoyed this stout. I liked that it was smooth and all the flavors blended together very well. One of my favorite stouts."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a mostly opaque dark brown with a very thin light brown head. The little head there was did leave nice lacing on the sides of the glass. Aroma reminded me more of a coffee stout than an oatmeal. Large amount of chocolate, medium amount of coffee, with a smaller amount of grains. A very small amount of alcohol could be smelled. Taste was slightly milky, at times was sweet, and other times was a bit bitter. Grains could definitely be tasted on the tongue if allowed to linger. Felt ok in the mouth. Coated nicely, but carbonation was off. Was too light in the main sip, but over powering as it left the mouth. Overall a reasonable stout. The after tingling of the carbonation throws me for a loop and knocks it down a few pegs."
"Definitely worth a try for any oatmeal stout lover."
"O: Light, smooth, and very drinkable. Low ABV rich and tasty! Solid Oatmeal stout."
"Overall the beer was okay, there was just not much too it after the first taste."
"I intend to come back to this when I want a stout that is easy to drink. It is hitting th spot right now."
"Overall: It wasn't bad, I've had better oatmeal stouts, but it was enjoyable. I don't think I would seek it out."
"O: Nice flavor balance, sweet at the start and bitter at the end. Wasn't quite as delicious as it smells, and the mouthfeel was somewhat unimpressive."
"Another good beer from Breckenridge. It's not quite great, but this is something all dark beer drinkers should keep on hand."
"T: its a nice flavour, is not so heavy, kind of sweet, well balanced, the toast flavour is nice, the flavour is good but not exceptional"
"I like the flavor, but not the consistency."
"Pours black like oil, nice brown fluffy head to it. Not too much aroma to it. Taste is medium bodied and very creamy. Chocolate and coffee tasting notes come through. Finishes nice and clean. A little too weak on the taste, it doesn't stay on the taste buds too long, but the creaminess makes up for it and gives it some great drinkability. Not the best oatmeal stout out there, but a very solid one at least."
"O: Overall interesting complexity, a bit sweet but has a smooth easy roastiness that goes down fairly well enough."
"O-Great beer to have every now an again, to change things up."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown color with a 1/2 inch dark tan head that fades to an oily film. Thick broken rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted oats, dark malt, and cookie dough. Taste is exactly the same as the smell. This beer has good carbonation which makes for a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good solid oatmeal stout that I would get again."
"A pretty standard oatmeal stout, though with enough flavor to put it above average."
"Been meaning to try this beer for some time now, and today is the day. Get some. It pours a bleakly dark black-brown topped by a finger of creamy tan foam. The nose comprises toasted wheat, toasted oats, light roasted malts, and light chocolate powder. I gotta admit, though it sounds mild, it's still pretty pleasant and effective. The same, unfortunately, cannot be said of the taste, which is overwhelmingly of charred oats, with some chocolate powder, mild coffee, and black pepper being neglected in some flavor basement. That isn't to say things taste bad, just not as good as they smell. The body is a light-feeling medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a pretty smooth feel. Overall, not a bad oatmeal stout. Not a particularly noteworthy one, but definitely nice enough to drink fairly happily."
"O: Mediocre. Drinkable but there are much better stouts out there."
"It's got the smoothness of oatmeal, but no body! Other than that the flavor is fine, but I've had much better in the style. Great bottle art."
"Overall: this is a very drinkable oatmeal stout with a nice balanced flavor. A few of these can easily be consumed in a session."
"BUY THIS!"
"O= overall this is a great contendor in its class and style. Probably goes well with charcoal broiled steak, also pepper-hot omelets for breakfast or dinner. Grilled burger with mushrooms also sounds great."
"O-Just a solid representation of the style. It would be good if I did not have to wait till GABF to get it."
"Overall this beer was a huge surprise to me! After drinking their Vanilla Porter earlier in the day, I had low expectations for this (I gave the porter a C+). Very solid beer, would drink without hesitation. Like I said, it tries to emulate Samuel Smith, and does a decent job, scoring just a bit lower in each category."
"Overall, decent American stout that includes a nice array of flavors."
"not much to say about this one. wouldnt recommend getting a 6 of it."
"O - Overall, another great beer from Breckenridge. I have never been disappointed with this brewery."
"Overall this is a solid beer."
"This is one fine stout. I like the espresso and rich chocolate smell. Tastefully good as well.With the same taste of chocolate milk with a hint of hops and lots of malt.I could have this one for breakfast lunch,and dinner.What ya mean I'm a raging alcholic.I beg your pardon.This is one tasty beverage,one that will put a smile on your face all day long."
"Overall, creamy stout that needs a little more flavor in my opinion"
"O: Deliciously roasty overall, very tasty. Definitely worth a second buy."
"Very smooth and easy to drink, and an ideal and faithful representation of an oatmeal stout. Superb!"
"This beer was OK but I have had much better oatmeal stouts. Poured very dark with a smell of an oatmeal stout but really not that pleasant. Rather strong taste for only being 4.95 ABV. All around just an average beer. There are much better beers out there."
"Not very impressed with this one. Needs more sweet flavors to balance. Nonetheless, it is drinkable and does have a descent roasted character."
"Overall, reminded me a bit of the Crabtree version. Pretty bland with some off notes. The sweetness and char didn't mix well."
"O-Smooth drinking and tasty stout, it does not wow, but it is pretty good."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. Pours slightly darker than cola with a one inch, tight, mocha-colored head. Head eventually settles into a consistent soapy skim with delicate strands of lacing encircling the edges of the glass. Nose is rather subdued, but a suggestion of cocoa, roast and oats comes out in the mix. Taste consistent with nose, but there's also a slight artificial sweetener character interspersed in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a carbonation that falls just short of lively and a slightly creamy texture. All and all, a pretty drinkable Oatmeal Stout and quite flavorful for the abv. I'd like the opportunity to try this one on nitro if possible."
"D- Easy to drink, good beer. Not in same class as Samuel Smith's oatmeal stout but pretty good."
"o: An amazingly full flavored small stout, I wonder if the bottles are as good..."
"What's surprising about this beer is its modest ABV with some of the substantial characteristics of a stout with a more robust ABV: the beer is fairly full bodied and there seems to be a touch of booziness in the sweetish roasted malts underneath. I would have pegged this for a beer with a much higher alcohol content. It pours a fairly thick, inky black color, not much head or lace. The beer is very deep roasted and has some charred notes, but also some sweeter roasted notes below. The beer is creamy, and a bit oily on the tongue, and maybe has a touch of a metallic flavor to it. There are some molasses chocolate notes here as well. This is a decent stout, the bittering hops do make an appearance, and the beer is quite substantial. I like it but it's not my favorite oatmeal stout."
"An above average oatmeal stout, but my main gripe is that it seems a bit carbonated and the flavors, while there, leave me wanting something a bit more robust. Easy drinking and tasty."
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black. A gritty-looking tan head patches up the glass. Smell is sweet and grainy (re: oaty) and has mildly roasted coffee aromas. Taste is also ""gritty"" like the look, plenty of oats and sweetness. A bit of alcohol feel, some bitterness afterward. Nice. An almost rudimentary stout, but that's good."
"O - Decent representation of the style, nothing more than average. It's a good oatmeal stout. Would be curious to try an imperial version of this and the same with some age to it."
"A decent sixpacker."
"M&D - okay aftertaste as it is a bit thin. Low astringency. Overall drinkable. For oatmeal stout drinkers, give this one a try."
"Overall a decent Oatmeal Stout that had all the right characteristics and went down rather smooth and easy."
"Jet black, oily in appearance. Nice, fluffy tan head that is gone all too quickly. Moderate aroma of cocoa and a tinge of vanilla. Smooth, roasted malt flavors. Again cocoa with an underlying sense of vanilla. Nice hop bite. A subtle earthiness that can't be beat. Good body. A great beer all around and under 5% abv? I could do this all night."
"Overall I found this to be a pretty decent oatmeal stout. Fairly standard but with a nice robustness that goes well on this chilly Northern Michigan night. I am not sure that I would choose this over some of my go-to stouts, but if you buy it you will not be disappointed."
"Poured out of the bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a nice opaque w/ tan head & good lacing. The nose is forward w/ roasted barley, oat flakes make it through, & a bread/biscuit aroma is also present. Picked up coffee & some espresso notes, has a nice tingling bite from the hops. Smooth. Picked up a little chocolate w/ a long dry finish. Light body in my opinion, has moderate carbonation, & mouth coating. Quite drinkable. I love coffee, porters, & stouts which this beer makes my list of regulars that I would have year round. Prosit!"
"DB- The stout aspect of this is nice, good roast malt and milk chocolate cocoa feel. I sense a very early stage infection (or some strange acidity) which is unfortunate because this is probably the first batch to hit my local store. I'll leave this for reference but hopefully can have a fresh one in the future."
"Single, twelve-ounce bottle copped from Total Wine & More. Pours a pitch-black, dark colored hue with slight carbonation visible and a small-to-medium bodied tanned-colored head. Slight aroma of rich, roasted malts and hints of burnt chocolate. Light-to-medium bodied flavor. Easily drinkable, would make for a good dessert beer. A decent stab at the style but nothing above and beyond."
"High drinkability. Very easy drinker, a bit thin though. Great session beer."
"From bottle number 05823B11. Sampled on February 20, 2011. The pour is very dark brown and it nearly goes black. Oatmeal, chocolate malts, and raisins are noted in the aroma. It may be creamy as advertised but the overall texture is thin. There is this bready and dark maltiness in the taste with a tingling hopped ending. It came from a mixed 12 pack and it was probably the best one."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head and considerable lacing throughout. Smell is of oats and malts. Taste is good, roasted malts up front, some oats,bitterness at the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"Another new addition to the beer available in NH. Pours a pretty solid black color with a tan head that dissipate almost immediately. Smells of caramel, chocolate and roast with hints of vanilla. Taste is slightly acridic coffee mixed with caramel and chocolate. Slightly mineraly in taste. Medium body with a semi dry finish. Creamy acridic mouthfeel, medium level of carbonation. MEH. Nothing really objectionable here, but nothing really spectacular either. I would drink one if offered to me, but I wouldn't seek another one out."
"Pours to a decent but thin tan head and opaque ruby-black color. Aroma is roasty, malty grainy and minerally. Flavor is very mild for this style: roast malt, hints of coffee, vanilla and a nice balanced finish with residual hop bitterness. Medium-full mouthfeel and moderate CO2. Overall a decent beer."
"Nose is quite light, mirroring the flavor profile of chocolate malt with hints of coffee. Lesser notes of aspirin, menthol, and citric hops. A little on the light side, but drinkability is definitely there. Very balanced and smooth, doesn't push the envelope."
"Notes: Nose was great, but the rest just doesn't live up to that expectation and is just an average beer. More bitter, roasted, acidic like flavors with coffee and chocolate being there. Body is just too thin and watery."
"Not a bad stab at the style, but not a great one, either. I was reminded of a loud-mouthed braggart: all show but no mojo behind that intimidating, beetle-black color. The hops are too strong, and whatever oatmeal they used didn't really smooth things out. There's a strong tang of vinyl, too, as if they melted a few 33s into the vat. The subdued roasted flavor is quickly squashed by the bitterness. A bit too much sting in the body, too. Worth a try... but only once."
"Drink is pretty good too, sessionable, creamy and rich, a nice light hop bitterness, the only drawbacks are the light metallic taste and the sticky finish."
"Poured dark, of course. Not much head. Smells very much of roasted malts, a hint of coffee flavor. Very light carbonation. Tastes sweet, you can definitely tastes the oats. I felt the aftertaste was a little bitter. Very drinkable stout. I will enjoy this one again."
"I don't like the drinkability rating, what is good and what is bad? I think this is a beer to be enjoyed, you can maybe have 2 in one night. The complete opposite of a light beer."
"A great example of an oatmeal stout. A good beer to turn to on a cold, snowy day."
"D: Very drinkable. Any more sweet then no, but this is well-balanced and delicious"
"Thick and creamy, with all the right flavors there. The oatmeal is background flavor, while chocolate/coffee are predominant. Bitter hops bring balance to the sweetness. I like the bitterness that the hops bring, but I feel like more oatmeal flavor would be welcome."
"D - A very good oatmeal stout. Would consider getting it again."
"looking for something diffrent glad i pick this up. a dark black color , pour like beer you want to drink , not a over powering smell or taste , this beer is not a pounding down beer but a beer to drink and ejoy so pick some up and its much better then their vannila porter. so run to the store and get this"
"M/D - Full chewy body, easy to drink, tasty."
"D- Not the absolute best that's out there, but enjoyable. I could see this being a session beer. Overall, I would drink this again, and am not disappointed about picking this up on a whim."
"D: Average. Its a drier, roasty oatmeal stout. Not the flavors I was hoping for, not bad by any means, but nothing to seek out or buy again."
"This is not a good example of an Oatmeal Stout for a person wanting to experience one for the first time but far from a horrible mess."
"Very generic on Nitro, and the diacety really detracts. Pretty much ho hum with some flaws. Not something I would recommend."
"D- A pretty decent brew that I liked enough to get again."
"Overall I really like this. I was in the mood for a stout and this fit the bill nicely."
"Drinkability -"
"Overall, a delicious and easy going oatmeal stout that doesn't seem to give you the bloated feeling acompanied by msot stouts of this style. The only area that this beer seems to lack in is the head, which is minimal to not present at all."
"A very pleasant straight forward oatmeal stout, offering no challenges. Enjoyable but not exceptional."
"Overall this is a pretty good oatmeal stout. It is very creamy as I've found the oatmeal to be. Nice rich, roasted flavors with a smooth finish. Also at 4.9% ABV this could make for a great sessioner. Great Beer Breckenridge Brewery!!"
"Pours a warm black with a low, white, uneven head that fell fast. Minimal lacing. Smell is very sweet, almost intimidatingly so, full of dark cherry and fresh bread and oats, maybe a hint of chocolate. Mouthfeel is thin and a little underwhelming. Mild carbonation, sort of malty on the front end, with a fruit-tinged, slightly woody middle and a mild, gently bitter finish. This gets the basics right, and it's mellow enough to be highly drinkable -- I'm enjoying mine -- but there's not a ton going on here, overall. In regards to the oatmeal stout style generally, Samuel Smith's, Buffalo Bill's, Barney Flats, Dark Horse - pretty much every other oatmeal stout I've tried, really - is as good or better. I'd probably go with a C+, but the B- that BA tallies the score out as is close enough."
"Wow! This beer has a great color, a beautiful white head, frothy and thick. The smell is beautifully sweet and perfect. The taste is amazing and smooth. The only problem with this beer that I have is that its so good, that I end up drinking a whole 6 pack everytime. Without a doubt one of the best American Oatmeal Stouts I've had in a while."
"Not to mention that this also fits into the category of session beer. It would be pretty easy to have a few in a sitting along with some oatmeal raisin cookies or biscotti and as some have mentioned on here, this is a bit like coffee. No need to pour cream in here though - this can be enjoyed as is and for anyone new to this style, it doesn't get any more easygoing or introductory than this. Not a bad beer for the holiday season!"
"Conclusion: I have never been impressed by this brewery, but this beer is quite good. This beer is worthy of the title, and it is very good in the mouthfeel and taste department. Not quite up to the level of Samuel Smith's (in my opinion, the champion in the style) but surprisingly close. Well done Breckenridge, you have partially redeemed yourself with my palate."
"Medium bodied with plenty of roasted chocolate malt as well as some coffee, oatmeal, caramel, toast and hazelnut. Slight lactic character that add a silky creaminess making this beer extremely quaffable. Complex and well balanced with a dry finish."
"I think with some tweaking this beer could be solid. The flavors could have been bigger and more pronounced. It's a decent beer & I wouldn't mind drinking it again."
"Drink- not very good. felt again like I was drinking coffee and since I cant consume more than 2 cups of coffee the drinkability had a very low rating."
"Overall there wasn't a lot going on with this beer but it wasn't hard to drink. Not worth seeking out but not worth avoiding either."
"Overall, this beer is one to come back to frequently for those who seek a well-rounded oatmeal stout. ABV is fairly low, which aids drinkability."
"This beer pours a dark brown that gives orange lacing when hit with light. Topped by a tan foam that fades quickly. The smell is of a hint of coffee and some flaked oats and a touch of caramel. The taste is a bit absent. There is a bit of caramel on the flavor, hints of roast but not much more. It's not bad just not special. The mouthfeel is a tad too watery for my liking as well to the point where the minerals in the water are the most obvious on the palate. It drinks pretty well, it's good for watching a football game as I am now. Go Bears."
"The mouthfeel does have the silkiness of an oatmeal stout, but finishes with a buttload of bitterness even when warmed up. The uber bitterness becomes too much and opening another is out of the question. Perhaps I'll open an Imperial IPA to wash out the lingering bitterness. ;)"
"Drinkability - I like this beer very well. This wold be nice on those bitter cold afternoons and evenings. I could see myself having a few of these while watching the snow fall. It seems that all Breckenridge Brewing Co. brews I've tried lack with head and head retention. Even with aggressive pours they just don't produce or hang around."
"Drinkability: Wonderful beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium-light with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"M - too light and not creamy enough for a high rating. Good carbonation level"
"D - Pretty drinkable oatmeal stout, medium bodied, nice hop bitterness at the end but smoothed over pretty easy. A brew I would drink again and recommend it!"
"Overall: A very enjoyable beer. Nothing super surprising, but there doesn't have to be when it is done like this. For the price ($8.99 a 6 pack) it is a heck of a deal."
"D - This is kind of a chore to finish. Light mouthfeel and warped taste make for a stout that goes down less than easy."
"Another gift from my trusty midwest connection. Poured into a goblet, pours jet black with little body and minimal head. Has a roasted malty aroma. Taste is lighter and a tad watery than you would think. Has a strong bitter aftertaste. Overall I was not impressed and this beer doesn't stand up to a decent porter."
"D - Definitely drinkable to the last drop, even at less than cold temperatures this beer goes down smooth."
" Oatmeal stout, but decent."
"D- Big body, malty and surprisingly bittered, this is a great mountain state oatmeal stout. Sweet, smooth, big and relaxed. A very solid oatmeal stout, and probably Breck's best beer I've tried to date."
"D: I'd enjoy another one, perhaps when the weather cools a bit."
"Good mouthfeel and drinkability. I reckon this is a good example of the style and not bad for the price...$8.70 a 6 pack."
"I have been seeing Breckenridge around Columbus for some time now and always seem to find an excuse to buy something else. This beer proves I've been stalling for too long. Time to try some more of their stuff..."
"D: This is chocolate city here. Like a dark chocolate bar transformed into a delicious beer. First Breckenridge made me a fan with their Vanilla Porter, now they've outdone themselves with this fantastic Oatmeal Stout. Stick with the dark dark beers with these guys. Super beer, it'll be a shame when my lone bottle of this is gone."
"EDIT: This review was for the ""Thunder Stout"" which is what the beer handles say at their pubs. Not sure if it was always their Oatmeal Stout or not, but I could swear it tasted different last year. Now? Not as much."
"The beer pours a dark brown to black color with a tan head. The aroma is roasted malt with some chocolate. It smells a lot like I expect an Oatmeal Stout to smell. The flavor is roasted and burnt malt with some chocolate and oats. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"All in all the lack of surprises here and unassuming nature seems overly dumbed down for mass appeal. I'd drink another, but only if somebody else was buying."
"Drinkability- Like the beer would drink this again"
"D- A real session stout."
"Very little carbonation makes it easy to drink."
"Drinkability - I like it and would buy it again."
"Does this seem a little perfunctory? Why am I speeding through the review? I'm not, really, I just don't have a lot to say here. It's... decent. Worth drinking, sure. Worth talking about? Not so much. Pretty much just a dead average version of an Oatmeal Stout."
"Drinkability: A smooth, flavorful beer. Nothing over the top spectacular, but a nice session ale."
"D/O- This has 'stop at one' written all over it. Not terrible, but I wouldn't seek it out again."
"Poured a very nice deep brown, near black color, although with just a bit of head and no lacing. Nice scent, some roasted grains with a little extra sweetness, but nothing very deep. Nice flavor; good roasted grains and a nice near coffee taste, with a nice extra bit of sweetness and fullness from the oats. Went down quite smooth, a very nice oatmeal stout."
"Because of the low ABV, its drinkable, but it lacks enough flavor to keep you coming back. I've had this at the pub in CO before and remember it as being better. Could be that it simply isn't as fresh, but the smoke-ness stands out right now. Depending on your tastebuds that could be a bad or a good thing I suppose."
"D - not bad but nothing to write home about. Certainly drinkable but not a first choice."
"D - Could be a little too much on the bitter/dark chocolate/espresso side for me to really session, but this is a simply outstanding brew that deserves a purchase if only for the outstanding nose. Good damn beer!"
"Great color on this beer, almost black, but poured with only a slight brown head. It has an upfront bitterness to it but then you get some chocolate flavors on the back of the tongue. I'm not getting much in aroma, but I have a cold so that may well be a factor. It feels creamy if not slightly oily. the more I drink the more of a bakers chocolate flavor is coming through. Nice beer for cold weather."
"I was very pleased with this beer. I do enjoy Samuel Smiths Oatmeal Stout and Young's but I would have to say this beer easily contends with those beers."
"Pours black and viscous with a creamy tan head. Aroma is strong and full of big roasted coffee aroma. The body is hearty with low levels of carbonation but it could be thicker for such a big flavored body. The finish is gradual and becomes sweeter as it progresses. The flavor transitions from the robust coffee flavor to a sweet chocolate flavor before quickly fading away."
"D - I'm very impressed with this Oatmeal Stout and I feel like it's a bit underrated on BA. I don't know if some people got a hold of some bad bottles or what, but I thought this was a spectacular Stout. Well done Breckenridge!"
"D: smooth beer, it is drinkable and I could drink a few of these, where this style should be and usually is quite filling and after two I usually stop, but this one i could drink a few more than two it is light. however I would buy this one again I think it is good."
"D: This beer is good in the morning on a fall day or late in the evening on a warm June night. For me, this beer is best when enjoying one at a time."
"I sat at a table with 3 other people who all prefer differnt styles agreed that it was the best new beer we have tried for a while."
"Overall - Worthy"
"I will buy this again."
"Sticks around tastewise, doesn't evolve into the tobacco taste some stouts will do. Not a complex oatmeal stout, but its hard to make a bad version of this style. Straight forward."
"D - All this has going for it is looks, and that's not enough to save it. This is one of the few times I won't even bother to finish the bottle. If you want good beer, look elsewhere."
"You could definitely throw down a lot of these easily. Luckily, there isn't much alcohol in these."
"This is a very nice effort from Breckenridge. It's always interesting to see where a brewery goes with a special like and oatmeal stout, and this is a good one. A good flavor, creamy body and low ABV lend some great drinkability to this one."
"Eric"
"Drinkability: Definitly a good oatmeal stout that I will have to try again."
"Only the slightest burgundy hues escape this opaque beer when held up to bright light. The head is attractive but look away and its gone. Lacing is minimal. Coffee notes and woody aromas. Cocoa nibs in the taste, with a little unpleasant bitterness. Way too watery for the style in my opinion. Low abv makes this a fine drinkable brew."
"Not a bad stout, but middle of the road for me."
"Beer poured black with a near perfect tan head. Nose was roasted malts with sweet chocolate lingering in the background. Taste was roasted malts, hints of coffee, sweet chocolate, with a light bittering hop finish. Mouthfeel was light to medium bodied and very smooth. Drinkability was good. This is a smooth drinking stout with plenty of character that would keep me coming back!"
"D: A decent stout overall. Not the most complex example of the style, but pleasant enough."
"Rotation: now that I've had it again, it's sure to be part of the stout/porter rotation again. Tap = hell yeah."
"This is a drinkable brew. It's low ABV & medium body make it sessionable. Just be aware that the flavor & smell are subdued."
"Drinkability: An unexpected surprise from Breckenridge, and a quality oatmeal stout that I wouldn't mind having on hand once the weather starts getting cold when my wife and I move to New York. Then again, I'm sure because I said that Breckenridge may not be available. Though they're hit or miss for me, this is the former all the way. Plus, at 4.5%, you can drink a few of these and not feel bad or like you need to hit the gym right after."
"Pours black with brown highlights with very little mocha head. The smell is malty and sweet, with some burnt characters. The taste starts malty, with some nice sweet chocolate notes, and finishes with a nice burnt flavor. The burnt flavor sticks throughout the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is ok, nice and smooth but a medium body detracts from this stout. I expected a heavy or substantial mouthfeel, but seems watery for a stout. This is an easy drinker, the flavors make up for the lack in body, an overall nice beer."
"Breckenridge Oatmeal Stout pours an opaque black with a tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is mostly coffee and chocolate and a touch of caramel. The flavor is similar, coffee chocolate and caramel meld nicely. Overall, pretty decent, I would recommend it."
"Pours a very dark brown color body, tan colored head, creamy, lastingish. Roasty aroma coffee and dark chocolate. Creamy mouthfeel, roasted and chocolately, milk chocolate. Warming. Bitter as it warms up. Not too shabby, creamy."
"Tasty and smooth brew. Would gladly have again."
"The beer has a medium body, rich, smooth, good carbonation level and extremely easy to drink. Perhaps one of the best Oatmeal Stouts that I have had to date."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a nonic Imperial pint glass. The stout appears a fazed dark brown color with about two fingers of lingering, pillowy foam. Smells and tastes of sweet, caramelized malt, medium roasted grain, milk chocolate, mildly bitter hops, brown sugar, and coffee. Hovering between medium and full bodied, due to the oatmeal addition, this stout is amply carbonated as well. Tasty, accessible, and quite drinkable."
"This beer pours a dark dark brown with a half inch of tan head. It leaves a ton of lacing on the side of the glass as I worked my way through it. Smells of Chocolate and coffee with some oatmeal thrown it. Tastes of chocolate, coffee, and a big does of roasted malt. Mouthfeel was a bit thin, closer to a porter. I drank this was pretty damn quick, a very tasty beer."
"D: Ill have another please. As far as oatmeal stouts goes... this is up there, way up there!"
"i would like to see more alcohol in this that is about the only complain i have just needs more of a kick to it i think but then again this is coming from a guy who really loves imperials and such"
"Drinkability is great. definitely a sessionable stout with a nice oatmeal creaminess. I'm pretty impressed with this one, and would certainly make it one of my regular choices were it available locally."
"this stout pours a nice dark black with very minimal head . slight malt aroma but mostly burnt coffee. just slightly bitter taste with an average drinkability. you can do worse but you can do so much better. overall this is a run of the mill stout the potential is there . i will try another bottle in a few days and maybe it will be better"
"It's not tasty enough to be dreamy, but the idea of pairing it with dry, unsweetened chocolate...or maybe a bowl of Cheerios for breakfast is. The final verdict: a solid stout, but anything more....dream on."
"Future outlook: Decent, but not really worth revisiting."
"A little nutty a bit dry tasting but I thought it was a great beer and will be drinking it again."
"Overall this is a great oatmeal stout, and I will be picking this one up again when I find it."
"Poured this beer into a glass and formed a short lived medium tan head over a very deep brown (almost black) opaque body. Some light lacing remained through to the bottom. The smell is mostly a standard stout mix of roasted and toasted grain and espresso with little if any hops presence and mirrors the taste yet there's a little bitter pine in the aftertaste that's overpowered by espresso in the finish. The feel is a little thinner than I expected but not too bad. Overall not bad, and yet I feel guilty for reviewing this beer. The brewery didn't feel it important enough to mark the brewing dates on the bottles (indeed, only the stout was marked in a mixed case with any dates, yet not marked or notched to indicate the actual bottling date) Perhaps this beer is better fresher but as I know not when it was brewed then I'll review their beers as I drink them regardless of the condition of the beer. At least this wasn't a drain pour."
"This beer pours a deep dark brown, almost black light slightly passes through. About a one finger tan head with some splotchy lacing on the glass. Nose is of chocolate and nuts, malts definitely come through. Taste is of bitter chocolate, malts and coffee - slight hop in the finish. Mouthfeel is rather light, not to say it's a light beer but a little heavy on the carbonation makes it a lighter stout. Overall, an ok beer."
"Drinkability: Although the flavor profile is not outstanding, this is a very nice drinker; quite enjoyable"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sweet, slightly tart, smooth, and slick on the swallow."
"D - This is a very enjoyable oatmeal stout. It's well done and I think it hits the style mark quite well."
"D - I don't hate it, but it isn't something I'd want another of. A somewhat subdued and uninteresting stout. Nothing wrong with Breckenridge's effort, but it just doesn't stand apart."
"A easy drinking session brew. Flavor is pleasant and unified, but not outstanding."
"Overall nothing special here. Decent but wouldn't search it out."
"Mouthfeel was pretty heavy and creamy but not enough to make the beer undrinkable. Not much sign of carbonation. Loved the coating feeling this one had going down. Would definitely drink again."
"Not bad but could use a little work and it would be very good"
"Notes from: 4/16/06"
"D-I've enjoyed drinking this six pack and sharing it with my friends. A decent brew enjoyed by a friend who usually sticks to Coors Light, so it's got to be drinkable. Not anything wild, but a solid session brew."
"Beer is very drinkable despite its appearance. Not heavy at all , could drink more than one at a time. Good flavors would buy again."
"The taste is predictably heavy on the coffee and toasted malt tones with some late breaking hop balance. The finish is dry and very smooth, thanks to a noticeable oat presence. Chocolate tones join the rest in the aftertaste. I'd like to see the carbonation dialed back a notch but that's just a personal pet peeve. Overall, this is a very serviceable oatmeal stout, ideal for winter quaffing."
"Pours a deep, dark brown...near black. 1/2"" of head. Decent lacing. Smell is mostly roasted malts. Taste is good. roasted malts and dark chocolate with a little bitterness. There's also a hint of burnt malt. After taste is mostly of dark chocolate/cocoa. Drinkability is good. Low ABV makes this a great session beer."
"Drinkability: Quite, for such a heavy beer. I could probably drink about three of these in a sitting."
"Pours an opaque black color with a tannish to light brown head. Smells of coffee and chocolate malts. You can smell the oats in it also but then the scent turns metallic. Body is quite thin and the head disappated quickly. But really, who cares, because this was a highly drinkable nice session beer, burnt nutty taste and very easy to drink. I enjoyed it."
"D - Drinkable, but a bit too much roast."
"I remember trying this before I got into craft beer and didn't like it much so I thought I'd give it another go. Still not very good, though I can appreciate it a bit more. It just has no complexity at all. I would much rather drink a Goose Island Oatmeal Stout any day."
"Lightly bodied, well-carbonated. It would be eminently drinkable if I appreciated its flavor more."
"smooth. full body. enough carbonation for style. i could drink these all night. i dig this beer. would buy again. all the beers in the mixer twelve pack are good (pale, amber, vanilla porter and this one)."
"Overall, I was very pleased and surprised at how this was. I would definitely get it again sometime!"
"D- Great flavor and feel make for a good drinker. I could see putting more than a couple of these back on a cooler day tailgating or as a nice fall/winter nightcap."
"Overall a great brew."
"D- this is one that i could drink more than one of without getting sick, but thats about it. definitely wouldnt want more than two of these"
"Pours a black, black, dark black with a mocha that fades to a small ring with streaks down the glass. Aroma is of dark toast and a slight coriander and bitter chocolate. Taste is of Ethiopian coffee and bitter chocolate with an abundance of small soft carbonation. An above average Oatmeal Stout from Breckenridge."
"This is an EXCELLENT beer - if you haven't tried one yet, you need to get off of your ass and get one now. It gives a good name to the (oatmeal) stout style. It's American-made, but still incredibly good. I regret only having one of them."
"Quite nice here - I guess I am surprised. I like this better than many and think it is borderline great."
"Recommended drinking. Will be buying this one again."
"If I'm gonna sit down and have a stout, I wouldn't mind it being this."
"D - A light weight on the stomach. Goes down easy and is not very filling. The flavors would work for me all year round, versus most stouts for me."
"Overall- Another tasty Breckenridge beer. very smooth and definitely sessionable."
"overall, this is truly a very good beer i really enjoy it"
"Tasted on 5/25/08."
"Heavy-bodied with a heavy smoky taste to it. There is some bitterness at the end. In my opinion, not very smooth. The smokiness can be a little over-powering."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style. I've had better beers Oatmeal Stouts but this beer is worth drinking if you're in the mood for the style."
"This was a pretty good example of the style. Poured up inky black with a khaki coloured head that stayed around for a while. Nice sticky lacing on the edges of the glass. Looked good. Smell was dominated easily by a somewhat assertive ""used coffee grounds"" aroma which I found very pleasant. Flavour, too, was dominated by this characteristic with little else coming through save for some very modest tones of toasted malt and oatmeal. This should be re-labeled Breckenridge Espresso Stout or something and have a bit of coffe thrown in the wort to make it so. Mouthfeel is right about where it needs to be for a stout being neither too thin nor cloyingly heavy, but right in between those two. Granted this is the wrong time of year to be drinking something of this calibre, it was a good stout that I will drink in the future. Not bad."
"D: great with grill roasted vegetables."
"D- I am pretty impressed with this. For $2 a bomber, you can't beat this."
"The brew is a little thin at the end but still very drinkable. Probably second best oatmeal stout I have had behind Samuel Smith's."
"Medium body with good amount of carbonation. A good example of the style and one of Breckenridge's better brews."
"Very good beer, smooth on taste, very easy to drink and went well with my ribs. The nitro tap also made for a great show inside my glass. The staff at the bar (Stewart) was amazing, very friendly and I had a ball."
"I love stouts - they are one of my favorite styles, so this one somewhat disappointed me. It is decent but doesn't hold to the true nature of what oatmeal stouts are. I would drink it again, but wouldn't rank it with the better oatmeal stouts out there."
"Fairly drinkable, and enjoyable, a solid example of the style and well worth trying. Would be a good choice when introducing newbies to the style. Glad i got to try this, and its likely something ill come back to at some point."
"Breckenridge brewery are masters at dark beers.This oatmeal stout needs to be served 55 degrees to enjoy the full potential,just like cheese.I first tried it cold from the fridge and the taste was minimal until it warmed up.Very drinkable and sophisticated.Try there other dark beers,you can't go wrong."
"D_Decent but not great oatmeal."
"Flavor is decent, nothing too overpowering or offensive. There's a good bit of roasted malts, dark chocolate, coffee, and oat, but I was hoping that the smoothness of the oats would have pulled through a bit more. The mouthfeel helps out the flavor in a major way, with its medium-thick body, spot-on carbonation level, and excellent bitter chocolate/hop bite on the finish. I'd have this beer again; it delivered a nice complexity and flavor profile without being too overbearing."
"All in all, a great beer to drink on a cool night. I'd definitely drink this again."
"Picked this up last weekend on the way back from Atlanta. It's a decent oatmeal stout. Not the best but pretty drinkable. I loved this on tap at the brewery several years and I'm glad to see them closed to Alabama. Not much of a head but it's tan-dark tan and doesn't hang around much. Typical drier taste as an oatmeal stout should. Opaque and dark brown, looks good in a glass. I enjoy this beer, especially if I'm looking for a stout that's not too heavy feeling."
"Drinkability is pretty good, the richness beckons slower sips (I'd have guessed the ABV was a good bit higher, even though there's really no alcohol taste, just thickness."
"Finish is medium and appetizing for the next sip."
"Beer pours out nearly black with a nice light brown head along with good lacing. Smells of coffee with a hint of chocolate. Taste is mostly dominated by a coffee taste with a burnt edge to it. Beer felt pretty good as it went down, a little thin but overall it wasn't bad. Definitely a drinkable beer."
"I could have a couple of these before I went looking for a better example of one of my favorite styles. Looks like plenty of people dig this one...that's cool, it's just not quite doing it for me."
"This was a decent oatmeal stout, I'd prefer a little more sweetness and creaminess with it, but it gets the job done."
"Pretty tasty overall, and a nice drinkable brew. I could easily see myself going thru 3-4 in an evening."
"Not bad, but definitely not one of my favorite stouts."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. I'd prefer more thickness for this kind of beer. Carbonation is okay. Drinkability is average given its average flavor. Overall, it's okay. Worth a try."
"Pours a super dark molasses with a small half finger tan colored head that quickly dies down to a thin layer of almost nothing. The stickiness is pretty good though for yielding such a small head. Smell is a soapy chocolate malt with a faint toasted oat. Very slight caramel sweetness with a somewhat smoke barley as well. Just not the nose I enjoy in my Oatmeal Stouts. Taste starts off with some brown sugar and wheat bread. Some chocolate and caramel find their way on the tongue. Aftertaste weak smoked oatmeal with a tiny bit of cane sugar. Overall the flavors are pretty weak. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a much too watered down texture. A soft carbonation is present throughout. This beer lacks in just about all aspects. I wish I could say I liked it, but I didn't."
"Pours an opaque black/brown, thick brown head forms, settles to a thick ring, very solid lacing and nice retention, looks like a stout! Smell is chocolate cereal and oats, roast, toffee, some smoke, bit of charred wood, roasty bitterness, nice. Taste is nice and roasty, chocolate, smoke, burnt raisins, some cereal and oatmeal smoothness, milk chocolate finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth, low carbonation, pretty silky, creamy, pretty solid. Thanks Kyoko!"
"This beer pours a black color, with brown around the edges. The head is onw inch in height, and dark tan in color. It recedes slowly into a nice cap of lacing. The aroma is of cream, vanilla, toffee, and roasted malt. The taste is like the aroma, but with the addition of a roasted malt bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a fine Oatmeal Stout. Nothing really ""wows"" me about it, but I would drink it again."
"This pint was black with mahogany edges, covered by fine, dark tan foam. Good head retention and there was plenty of thick, solid foam covering the glass. The aroma was fairly mild, a bit of roast, chocolate and caramel. The flavour was dominated by sweet caramel maltiness, some toffee and milk chocolate. Bitterness was solid, but not quite up to the task of balancing the malt. There was also a pleasant, lingering roastiness and a kiss of hop flavour. Medium bodied with a bit of a creamy texture. Carbonation was a little aggressive in my serving, but the mouthfeel was decent overall. I'd definitely have another one of these if it was available, and it's certainly tasty, but I wouldn't go searching it out again."
"Poured a black body with minimal white head that stuck around while drinking. Looks good and had a coffeeish aroma while smelling. The taste fit the smell-coffee and a little unsweetened chocolate. I enjoyed the taste but there was a mild burnt/roast flavor that gave a little unpleasant harshness on the finish. There were minimal hop aromas to speak of but the hop bitterness added to the burnt floavor of the coffee which increased the harsher flavor. Mouthfeel was fairly smooth and enjoyable. Overall, I thought this was a pretty decent beer but not extraordinary although I would drink it again."
"Nice rich coffee roastiness, with a hearty malty body, but Im not able to taste any strong oatmeal presence. Fair amount of bitterness, and some burnt tastes. I liked the amount of carbonation, which was noticeably more than that of a Guinness or Boddingtons, and the thickness was good. Could use a touch of sweetness, I think, to balance out the taste. Overall, it wasnt bad, but not quite what I was hoping for."
"Its pretty average IMO. Enjoyable, but nothing spectacular."
"Seems to have a lighter body than expected and it is not filling. I probably wouldn't drink another one of these now or later."
"Cheers"
"Pours a dry dark murky brown. No light escapes this brew. It has a nice brownish-red head that lingers and rebuilds with some swirling. Strong coffee aroma and flavor, roasted/dark malts. Low carbonation and almost creamy smooth on the palate. I love the way it looks! Dark and dank."
"Pours close to a pitch black with a fairly thick head that approaches 2 fingers. Leaves a massive lacing as time passes. Nose is distinct with an obvious sweet tone. Taste is deep with extremely thick coffee tones. Mouth-feel is slightly bitter with a thick and frothy feel. Overall a good brew. Worth drinking again and again I think, because of it's even style."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Lighter/thin for a Stout. Cold weather, fireside, ski lodge perhaps . . . definitely sessionable."
"There are just so many better oatmeal stouts out there. Still, I kind of enjoyed it, and Id weakly recommend."
"D: Overall, this is a decent stout. Nothing to sneeze at, this is definitely worth a try."
"Pours jet black with a small tan head. In the aroma, a roasty malt and a small oatmeal presence. In the taste, watery and a small sweet roasty malt. A watery and small bitter mouthfeel with a dry malty aftertaste. Very light and watery, which mellows the flavors. OK, but thin and watery."
"D: Really good. Satisfying and smooth. Full of taste without being too heavy on the palate or stomach."
"Cheers!"
"D - Overall a nice example of an oatmeal stout..I certainly wouldn't turn it down..very good"
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Good balance, smooth creamy mouthfeel that is somewhat coating as it goes down. Certainly a session candidate."
"D - A nice oatmeal stout that is a tinge sweeter and lighter than most in feel w/ a nice flavor. A well balanced stout w/ relatively few flaws, jus not the filling kind of breakfast beer you might be looking for. I could drink this often, I consider it very drinkable."
"This was on nitro at the Breckenridge Brewery/BBQ and had the telltale cascading head. It was black with a light cream colored head, looked like a Guinness. Smells were slight roasted malts. The taste was roasted oats and malts. Nice beer, easy to drink, and went well with the rack of ribs. It smells"
"Coming back to edit. I just finished the last few sips and drank them quicker than the others. This beer does seem watery when you drink it quicker, but it still leaves a very full coating of flavor in the aftertaste. I took half a point off of the mouthfeel."
"This is a pretty mediocre oatmeal stout. Not bad, but not great. There are much better stouts out there, oatmeal or otherwise."
"This could make for a decent session as it's smooth and well balanced."
"This is a really great stout. It has a really strong first flavor a coffee then the other favors come into affect. Also not as heavy as most stouts are (if I didnt' know any better I'd think this was a porter)."
"A decent beer, not the best stout but pleasant enough to try and drink again."
"Very light mouthfeel on the watery side with a slight amount of cloying.Was bland not interesting at all. Not interested in another. Looked really flat halfway through.. My first beer from this brewery,hope this isn't one of their better offerings."
"Pours dark black with choc milk type head that sticks around for most of this session. Smell is of tasted oat malt, and some chocolate. Tastes of the smooth oat malt and a little bit of dark cocoa. Mouthfeel is smooth just like most of the oat stouts. Not my favorite, but a better offering than the last Breckenridge I had."
"Drinkability: Though not exactly what I was hoping, it's still a pretty solid beer."
"Not the most drinkable of beers - some flaws could be characteristic of an aged sample, so could be better brewery fresh."
"Appears a dark black with ruby highlights tan head floats nicely with good retention large bubbled carbonation trail of lacing follows each sip. Aroma creamy dark chocolate roasts really alot of cocoa powder notes and herbal hops in the background a nice straight forward oatmeal stout not as soft smelling as some oatmeal stouts. Flavor creamy chocolate flow dark roasted malts give off a great amount of bitterness with a light herbal hop profile lending some help as well sort of a tart finish on it. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied evenly carbonated. Drinkability is decent kind of a boring cookie cutter oatmeal stout dark roasts with a creamy edge definitely still enjoyable, just doesn't do anything to set it self apart from other stouts."
"Typical well-made stout taste, nicely bitter with roasted malt and coffee notes. Not at all sweet, a plus, makes it quite drinkable and great with food. Though full-flavored it is not a heavy beer. Mouthfeel could be more creamy but does OK. Bitter coffee finish. Nice effort, would not mind having it again, especially on tap."
"Good b]balanced beer with perfect drinkability."
"D: Would not drink this again, as there's nothing to it. Just not really an enjoyable beer by any means, especially when in the market for something with a bold malt presence. They really missed the mark with this one."
"The bitter and stale tastes are all that came through for me and didn't make for a good drinking experience. For lack of a better word, it went down harsh."
"M&D - rough, hard to drink, though not a pour. i am shocked, everything i have had from Breckenridge up to this has been amazing, i need to trade for another one to make sure i didnt get a bad one. if i find that i had a bad one, i will edit this, ut for now, a surprisingly low score"
"D- drinkable and flavorful, complex oatmeal stout, well worth a try, best of all, its sessionable"
"12oz brown bottle with no freshness date. Pours almost black with a three finger head, good longevity and good lace. Roasted coffee aromas mixed with chocolate, vanilla, and a bit of oak. Standard stout flavors here. Nothing special. A quality made and tasty beer just nothing special."
"Overall I'd have to say this beer is a winner. It is a very drinkable and pretty tasty stout. I'll definitely try it again."
"Not bad, not wonderful. Id be up for a retaste some day."
"This is a nice drinking porter, while the burnt acidity is kept low here (definitely a good thing in a beer of this gravity), it could certainly be improved if it was even a bit less. I really like the toasted malt notes in the aroma and flavors though; it makes me think of dry oatmeal that has been left to toast in the oven. I could easily quaff a couple pints of this brew."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a deep brown, forming a very thin tan head that quickly faded, leaving light rings of lace on the glass. The aroma is light, smelling mostly of coffee. Taste is strong coffee, light roasted malt, with no hops detectable. Not exactly what I expected it to taste like. Medium mouthfeel, along with a clean smooth finish. Overall, not a bad stout, but nothing really there to seperate it from the rest. A very sessionable stout."
"Very much drier than expected for an oatmeal stout, but I really liked this. The bold roasted flavor added so much depth and quality to it. Highly recommended."
"This is my first beer from this brewery. I hope the rest of the line-up is as solid as this tasty treat!"
"Very dark brown with a creamy tan head that dissipates quickly. Very little going on in the nose with coffee and roasted barley all at subdued level. Taste is on the light side as well with notes of roasted barley, coffee, toasted oats, and smokey, chalky tones. Hops offers up some fruity and faint spice balance. Medium body and light to medium carbonation is a little much for my liking, but leaves a descent soft mouthfeel. The finish might be the best part of this beer a big oat character with notes that are dry, roasty, and nutty."
"Aroma of soft coffee and caramel. The roasted malt tended to be light as well. Tasted somewhat watered down. Nothing overwhelming, like a dark IPA. Some dry hops at the end. Drinkable, but not great."
"Finish is medium long and slighty sour"
"Drinkability: Great. The thin make up of this wonderful oatmeal stout makes it drinkable any day of the week."
"22oz. bottle shared by Shivtim. Poured very dark brown/black. light brown head. Odor is nondescript, vaguely chocolatey. Taste is a soft chocolate and cappuchino blend. smokey wet coffee grounds and some vanilla. Mouthfeel is too thin and watery. Not a bad version of the style, but not an altogether good one either."
"This one poured with a big, rocky, dark-tan head. The nose had notes of charcoal, chocolate, and licorice in varying intensities. The mouthfeel was full, but not quite creamy. The color was a very dark brown. I experienced a good bit of charcoal and chocolate in the mouth. The finish was more chocolaty with a light smoky presence, especially in the back of the throat."
"Not a bad oatmeal stout from Breckenridge. I like the smoked characterisitc, it adds a very unique detail. Great session beer."
"Plenty good, but pretty darn bitter."
"I think the nitro kind of takes away some from the characteer of this stout."
"12-oz bottle poured in a New Belgium chalice. A fairly pretty pour with a rather dark-tan head. Very coffee-like nose (with the pleasant addition of sugar). Good malt mix in the flavor, with more coffee, together with a nutty, lightly roasted note. Bitterness is moderate. Lingering toasted taste. A tad watery in the mouth."
"Breckenridge Oatmeal Stout was pitch black in color with a tan head. The head stuck around a few minutes before becoming a thin layer that would remain nearly to the end with some lacing left behind. The aroma was roasted grain and dark malt. The taste was roasted grain (burnt coffee) and dark malt with a dry bitter finish. The body was light to medium (light for the style) with medium carbonation. Drinkability was fairly good."
"Thankfully after the vanilla sweetness of the porter dissipated, I was able to fully enjoy this hearty stout. It was full of flavor: roasted malts, almost Cheerio-like oats and expresso. It had all of the thick meatiness the porter did not. It was dry with a slight bitter lingering. This was the perfect finish to a healthy bounty of samplers."
"Had a 2 ounce glass of this draft as part of a 6 beer sampler at the brewery. Pours to an opaque dark brown, with thick tan head that lasted thru all the other tastings (this one was last), and excellent lacing. Aroma was a pleasant blend of oatmeal and malt. The flavor was a good mix of chocolate and toffee, all blended with the malty sweetness. Unfortunately, despite the excellent appearance, the body was fairly thin, which led to a slightly watery finish. This beer could have been better, after the initial start."
"Overall I was attracted by its dark color but was disappointed in its light mouthfeel and smell despite an overall pleasant taste."
"An average Oatmeal Stout, but lacks the complexity to be beyond that."
"A dark brown color, with hints of red at the bottom of the glass. A small caramel colored head forms, but quickly dissolves. The scent of oatmeal is very strong, followed by hints of coffee. The oatmeal has a sweet taste that dominates the palate, with a slight bit of bitterness of hops at the end. A heavy, syrupy texture coats the palate, there is a bit of carbonation at the end. A descent oatmeal stout, good to in a pint glass and just sip through out the evening."
"Color is a dark, dark brown, almost black. The creamy head is of medium height and is a fairly dark brown. Retention is fair. Aroma is of sweet, roasted malt and is a bit on the weak side. Taste is dominated by roasted malt flavors, with an underlying oatmeal sweetness. Balance isn't quite right for the style, too much strong roastiness and not near enough sweetness. The roasted astringency is also a little too high. Still, this is a pretty tasty stout, just not great or quite to style."
"Medium bodied - thinner than you would expect from an oatmeal stout and slightly harsh."
"12 oz bottle pours our a deep black color. A good 3 finger head. It smelled of coffee. The taste had hints of coffee, malt and naturally a little oatmeal taste. It had a very dry mouthfeel. It was fairly heavy but drinkable. I had several over the weekend and enjoyed them all."
"Solid oatmeal stout."
"This oatmeal stout has a bit of a bite to it, roasty flavors stronger than the normal smoothness of an oatmeal stout in spite of chocolate tones underneath the slightly bitter taste. Good flavor, but seems a bit thin and water, though just a bit, with a smell like cold coffee. Overall, a good beer with an almost balanced taste. I would like it on tap to see if it smooths it out. If oatmeal stouts are usually too sweet or mellow for you, try this one out the next time on a buying trip."
"Typical black color, though not as black as some. Not as thick and smooth of a mouth feel as most other oatmeal stouts I've had. A little on the bitter side of oatmeal stouts, but not bad. Tastes burnt an slightly coffee like with hints of metallic flavor. Not the best example of the style, and not good in it's own right so its position is untenable.Change the beer."
"Black color, tan head with a decent lacing left behind. Coffee and chocolate in the smell, nothing overpowering or remarkable. Taste is much of the same, but a little better. I'm just looking for a little more to it. Mouthfeel is slick and smooth, but still a little on the thin side. Pretty good to have once in a while but one is enough. Worthy of trying, you may love it."
"12 oz bottle pours a reddish black color with a decent creamy light brown head that leaves good lacing in my glass, has a chocolate and coffee aroma. Dark roasted malty chocolate flavors, medium body that has a kind of watery mouthfeel, nice bitter and sweet chocolate flavors in the finish, not bad."
"Pours out very nicely for a 2.99 beer. It smells like a good stout only with more flavor than most common stouts. Taste has toasted oatmeal flavor written all over it, with burnt black barley/coffee flavors as well. It has a coffee aftertaste like a dark roast, it's very enjoyable. it's thick and smooth in my mouth. Lovely. I enjoyed this beer very much."
"Still too thin for my taste...a little more ""chewiness"" wouldn't hurt.. I gotta say, I'm a bit dissapointed. It's rough around the edges, and while it looks great (both the bottle and in the glass), it definitely needs some work."
"I have had this beer in the past and this bottle taste better then previous samplings. i enjoyed this bottle pretty good."
"Aroma is of burnt grains/malt and mildly plastic-y. So dark plack it almost has a purple hue to it. Head is a compreseed pinky finger sized affair. Fore is somewhat smokey and toasty. Not at all to style. Palate gets thin and the flavor is watery with a mish mash of weak chocolate, tone down vanilla, cream and coffee. Just doesnt get it right."
"Cheers2Beers"
"This is a very good oatmeal and certainly the best beer I've had yet from Breckenridge."
"The taste is smooth with a lingering burnt malted flavor. There is also some strong hints of dark chocolate. I like the smoothness of the oatmeal stout. A good brew. Merry Christmas."
"Pourer black with light brown head that left a little lacing. aroma, malts and caramel came out 1st than came the molasses and chocolate, with some coffee. flavor got the same as the aroma. a little on the thin side but I enjoyed this one. very easy to drink"
"12 oz bottle pours an ebony and opaque body with a one finger khaki head that retains well. Patch lace is quite prevalent on the sides of the glass. Aroma is subdued for a stout, with hints of sweet chocolate and smoked almonds. Mouthfeel is silky and smooth, with a light medium body and moderate carbonation. Taste is smooth, but lacking richness. Chocolate and coffee flavors are present, but very little dark roastiness. Hops are vague, but add a nice balance. Very average, overall."
"It's your average everyday Stout from a typical microbrewery. Aromas are solid and strong with a good malt base and heavy notes of coffee and chocolate. A toasty, yeasty, hoplike aroma swirls around the roasted malts. Lightly mellow and sweet from lactic sugars. Looks nearly opaque and dark brown with a foamy tan head that persists. Flavors are bold upfront with the roasted grain, chocolate, coffee, and malt with a silky sweetness comming in quickly. The beer quickly falls off of texture leaving a lightly watery and roasted grain texture that gets a bit chalky. Finishes quite the same with a charcoal like aftertaste. Not unpleasant, but a bit weak late in the drink."
"Something isn't quite there ( more malt I think ), but worth keeping around for the holidays & the pending ice age (april??)"
"Poured a dark black with a thick tan head. Aroma is sweet, almost a chocolate fudge smell. Taste starts smooth and light, with roasted caramel and coffee flavours. Finish is a little bitter and dry with almost a burnt wood flavour. Mouthfeel is a little thin. An average stout, but I'd probably drink it again."
"This is a good beer, but not my cup of, er, coffee. I like some stouts, but this one is a bit too heavily pine-hopped, and leaves a bit of an aftertaste. Worth trying, though, I'm just not buying a case of it."
"Poured an inpenetrable black with light tan lace. Some gentle chocolate in the aroma. Smokey, peaty malt, with the barest touch of semi-sweet chocolate. Not acidic, but felt a little thin in contrast with the big malt. A little coffee in the finish. This beer had a lot of potential, but never seemed to put it all together to be better than okay."
"Not particularly thick but passable."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: Overall this is a very drinkable beer. The carbonation does not stop but it adds to the brew. This beer is light to medium bodied in mouthfeel. Not to shabby of a drinking experience."
"This just appeared in local stores, so it must be a seasonal that's fresh from the brewery. Nice silk-screened bottle, but no freshness date. Pours a two finger really frothy brown head. It's the color of light brown sugar. The beer is pitch black and has a hint of mahogeny edgings when held to light. Smell is roasted grains, lactose, and cotton. It just has a milky smooth smell about it. Chocolate became more apparent as the beer warmed. Tastes dry roasted grain. It would be rough but there is a smoothness in the malt sweet and the mouthfeel that tame this roughness. It's like dancing around in a dangerous situation, because you've got safeguards you trust will pull you out should something go bad. The sweet smooth carries some black patent sour/bitter that's mixed with a really nice caramel flavor. The roast wins out in the end, coming across in the aftertaste as a sugar-sweetened richly roasted coffee. I think there is some hop bitter mixed in with the coffee roast. Hop flavor is mildly grassy and comes across as the rounded 'cottony' flavor I associate with Fuggles (or possibly Williamette) hops. Body is only medium, but it's got some silky qualities that you expect in an oatmeal stout. Nothing like Samuel Smith's (for me, the best example of silky mouthfeel), but still a nice feature. As the beer warmed, an alcohol presence became apparent in the aftertaste that was not enjoyable. I'll bet this will settle if the beer is aged. Carbonation is on the mild side of moderate and there is really amazing lacing on the inside of my glass. A nice beer that's helped me realize fall brisk air means that winter is quickly coming. Over the next couple months, I'll probably enjoy a couple more bottle and may set back a bottle to age through the summer."
"A great oatmeal stout. Very smoke like character reminded me of a rauchbier in some ways. Poured out to a black coffee color with a small brown colored head. Medium low carbonation. Lace was thick and vertical, unlike anything I've seen in a beer before. Aromas of coffee, caramel, toffee, smoked malts, roasted earth and grains dominated the nose and implied a treat was waiting in the glass. Taste was great; flavors of grain, malt and earth were in a cyclone of harmony, blending very well. My only qualm with this brew is in the mouthfeel. This was far too weak, lacking the thickness and depth of a good oatmeal stout. Still, it's not enough to take away from the overall enjoyment of this beer. High level of drinkability leads me to believe that this beer will find itself in my fridge again before too long. Recommended."
"This Breckenridge offering poured medium black in color with a huge tan head. Lots of lacing. Aroma was of oats and nuts along with a slight roasted chocolate aspect. Taste began was the roasted malt flavor that wasn't the most appealing to me. Floral elements from the hops underneath along with a lighter coffee base. The flavors get rounded out nicely by the oat precense. The sweeter oat flavor saves this beer. Finish is smooth. This beer is really smooth but a tad thin as well. Decent offering but nothing mind blowing."
"This one pours a dark color with a medium head that falls quickly, but leaves some nice lacing on the glass. The aroma has some chocolate and some roasted malts with a hint of diacetyl. Smells nice. The flavor is much the same as the nose. Some chocolate and roasted notes with a little creaminess. Tastes pretty good. The mouthfeel is a lot more thin than I'd like to see, but it's still a tasty beer."
"Pours black with a finger of tan head that falls to a sparse coating over top. Nose is appealing. Good roasted and lighly creamy aroma, with just hints of chocolate. Flavor is right there with the nose. Good roasted malt upfront, with a creamy oat background. Finish is a little subdued. I'd like a little more of a flavor to hang on. Feel is moderate with a light to moderate carbonation. I'd like a touch more creamyness. Overall, this is a pretty solid brew. I could easily session this one. This may find its way into my fridge a few times this winter."
"This was my first beer of this variety, and I think it represented the style well."
"The nose on this one is the best part."
"The hops bittering is in perfect balance with the sweet malts and the result is one of, if not the best domestic Oatmeal Stout I have ever had. Wow! is this stuff good."
"Pours an oily black, with a tan head, frothy, and dissaptes quickly. laces down. Nose is sweet, malty, and hints of liquorice. The taste is a nice sublte blend of oats and hops. It mixes with malty, slightly smokey-sweet after taste. While the mouth fell is slightly oily, it is a nice, rather drinkable brew"
"Very nice beer here from Breckenridge. Pours up with a smallish one finger head lacing is present but less pronounced than with other stouts. Opaque black/brown with red highlights. The smell is faint but full. A nice malty base with oats and hop blended in. Decent taste full and hopped finish with a burnt middle. This one lacks a little at the first taste, fuller at finish. Very strong moutfeel slight carbonation, rich creamy flow...very nice. Overall a good beer."
"D: A drinkable stout. Worth a six pack."
"Medium bodied, but still somewhat thin. Actually became watery upon warming. A decent stab at an oatmeal, but this one needs some malty push to be a good one."
"D: Not bad, but not worthy of a six pack."
"Appearance is mahogany brown, with a beighe head of foam that leaves long lived lacing. Aroma has sweet macciato and honey. Initial taste contains mocha and malt, followed by indeterminate flavors that mimic roasted meal, and some hops. Very dry finish that leaves a clean palate."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a black malt scent that boasts of patent and chocolate malts along with a dry oatmeal aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a creamy black malt flavor. It goes down easy and finishes dry with an oatmeal feel. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good stout. It really has a nice earthy black malt and oatmeal flavor; a good drinker."
"Drinks down easy enough but lacks some truer Oatmeal Stout qualities I like too see in the style."
"A very fairly priced and decent oatmeal stout. Jet black body, with a tan head that fades to an uneven surface on to of the beer. Very rich coffee and bitter chocolate smell. I would not know this as an oatmeal stout if I didn't see it on the label. Taste is also dark and rich with bitter chocolate and a good hop finish. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side, but not it doesn't detract too much from the beer. A good oatmeal stout at $6.19 a 6 pack (yes, a couple bucks cheaper than Corona, FYI)."
"Breckenridge has pulled no punches with their deeply roasty Oatmeal Stout. It delivers the typical appearance with the exception that the head retention could be a bit better. The nose is quite nice, and roasty black coffee mixes with softer notes of caramel, wet brown sugar, and molasses, welcoming you to take a sip. The flavor, however, is not nearly as sweet as the aroma suggests, but the dense roastiness remains. It's more like burnt coffee than espresso, and it becomes quite dry in the finish. It's full-throttle!... but also slightly unbalanced."
"Medium-full bodied and creamy."
"Comments - I was looking for something to brighten my day and this was it. I think I'll have oatmeal for breakfast tomorrow morning to continue the good vibe."
"Drinkability: A very good stout, easily approachable IMO. Definitely worth a try. I look forward to try additional brew from Breckenridge."
"Pours an opaque black with a fluffy tan head that has brown specks all through it. Smell is mostly of the roasted barley, giving it a coffee-like aroma with a hint of freshly baked, yeasty dark rye bread. Taste is heavy on the roasted barley and malt, a bit of the hops. The oatmeal flavor characteristic of most oatmeal stouts is very much lacking. A bit of caramel sweetness and a hint of papaya. Mouthfeel is well-carbonated and refreshingly light. Smooth, but in an oily way. For a ""stout", this is a drinkable ale, but not extremely so, as more than a few for me would quite enough. This is not an excellent example of the style, in my opinion, but is not an unpleasant ale."
"Not a very good oatmeal stout. I was impressed with the other beers I've had from these guys, but this one is a mess. It's not a horrible beer by any means, but it's a mish-mash of flavors that don't go well together. Pass on this one."
"This looked like it was going to be a great brew. On the otherhand, we don't taste with our eyes. At any rate, it was a pretty black color, with a dark tan head. The head was friggin' fluffy as hell and lasted the whole brew. The smell was of chocolate, hops, some light fruits, and malts. The taste was similar, but a little more in the area of hops. I think that kind of ruined it for me. Althought the hops had some bite to them, they did manage to ""cool off"" as the beer warmed up, but they were still very present. Overall a nice oatmeal stout. I just prefer the Oatmeal Stouts a bit sweeter."
"A new brew that has appeared on the shelves of my local liquor store. It pours a nice black with a thick tan head that stayed for a minute or two and leaves a nice lace around the glass. It smells like coffee and the aroma is heavy on the roasted malt. In fact the dark malts are a bit overpowering for the style, but I still find it drinkable. Maybe they should take the oatmeal out of the description? But it is a nice brew and it makes me want to explore Breckenridge's other brews."
"This is a fine stout. I would say that the oatmeal does not come forth as promenent as it should. I think that it is closer to a sweet stout than an oatmeal stout. I look forward to enjoying more of them in the future and would recommend them all."
"Very dark brown to black look, just a speck of light comes through at the bottom. Tan head rises to over 1/2 an inch in height and leaves laces that last until the end of the glass. Sweetened coffee aromas, a dustiness like confectioner's sugar. Texture is decent, could be more coating as its an Oatmeal Stout, I'd give it medium but a bit sandy. Flavor begins with a malty cocoa impression, but the chocolate tone warbles into cheaper off flavors just a bit. Does dry respectably mid mouth to close, a re-assertment of coffee roastiness, perhaps a speck of hops combining. The mouthfeel and late bittering are more like some Dry Stouts, I'd give this decent drinkability."
"Taste starts off with sweet, creamy malt and chocolate milk. This is greeted nicely by roasty bitterness. More sweet than bitter overall though. Roasted notes have a slight cardboard edge. Finish is briefly roasty and then turns almost cloyingly sweet. Still, a pretty good oatmeal stout."
"Flavor is mild too, with roasted malt and chocolate mixing with some bitter coffee notes. Very nice creamy finish. Nothing too exciting but a decent brew with no glaring flaws, just not outstanding."
"Pours black with a big tan head, mixture of small and big bubbles. Smells is light roasted malts some coffee mostly just to weak. Taste is burnt malts more bitter then needs be, can't really distinguish any hop bitterness over the burnt bitter flavor. Pick up some light coffee flavors not much else just burnt and bitter. Mouthfeell is to light, little to much carbonation taste fizzy in your mouth not smooth and creamy as it should. As drinkability goes bottle says it all ""A Tall, Dark, And Dreamy Stout"" it is tall and dark and right now I am dreaming of drinking a goood Oatmeal Stout instead of this. Don't even think they put oats in this stout just a bitter fizzy mess. To think when I lived in Colorado use to enjoy this hopefully they have changed it in the past 7 years."
"Not a favorite for me. The aroma set the tone for me. Maybe a little hop aroma would have pushed it higher for me."
"Tasted: 07/20/04"
"Drinkability: A decent Samuel Smith clone, and much more affordably priced if this is in your region. FWIW, I think Tröeg's Oatmeal Stout is better."
"A solid, easy-drinking stout."
"I do like this beer, but I myself would probably move on after a couple. Overall, it's a bit above average."
"A small, dark tan, dense head sits over an opaque, black body. It takes some bright light to pick out the slight red/brown highlights. Filmy lacing. There is some smoke in the nose and faint coffee. The smoky front sets up a thinnish middle that's not at all sweet. Hm. Bitter, unsweetened cocoa finish. This oatmeal stout is very light in flavor, with lots of bitter, unsweetened chocolate. There's almost no sweetness at all until it gets quite warm. At temperature there are some nice roasty nuts and a touch of sweetness. This is ok."
"Breckenridge Oatmeal Stout: Not much head, tan, thin skin, does not stay for long, no lace, no rings. Nice rich aroma, nice rich coffee/toffee flavor. Some dark chocolate flavors. Very smooth mouthfeel. Long coffee aftertaste that lasts quite awhile."
"The brew doesn't have a lot of different flavors but it certainly is a decent stout and worth a try."
"very drinkable and sessionable stout while maintaining a very full flavor."
"Overall Impression: A bit too heavy on the chocolate malt, too light on the oatmeal. A solid brew and I enjoyed it, but the bitter took away from drinkability. Also didn’t have that mouthfeel I like in my oatmeal stouts. If you’re a fan of the oatmeal stouts, give it a try, but if you are starting in the style, go for a Samuel Smith’s Oatmeal for a classic example."
"Black as any great Stout it left no head. Smelled hits of burnt chocolate, coffee and honey. Drinking left no lace but did leave a great tast and clean sweet after-taste of chocolate, no Oatmeal taste but still a fantastc Stout as far as Stouts go. Will definitely have again!"
"Beer pours motor oil black and no light penetrates through. The head falls quickly but hangs around the edge of the surface and laces the glass. The aroma is chocolate and coffee. The flavor is bitter chocolate, with a dry dark coffee bitter finish that lasts. The body is medium and a bit thin. No oatmeal in sight."
"Breckenridge Oatmeal Stout is an average to slightly above average stout. I'd never turn one down, but I'll always reach for Mr. Smith's version if given the choice."
"And again, thanks to Bruiser81 for the sample!"
"Well this beer is an almost-black color with some slight red showing when held to the light. A nice but little tan head sits atop it. The scent is roasted/burnt chocolate, maybe a little coffee smell as well. The taste is mainly chocolate, roasted, but has an unusually large hop kick compared to others of this style that ive had. Overall, the beer is fairly bitter, a nice take on this style. I like it."
"The beer as it sets in the glass a deep dark brown to black, ah the way a beer should look IMHO, the head large and creamy, the color a nice light chocolate, and after decomposition the lace forms a sticky sheet upon the glass. Nice toasted malt nose, hint of chocolate and coffee, the start is rich in malt, sweet with the top middling in feel. Finish is lightly hopped, mildly acidic, and the aftertaste dry, a Beginners Stout, quite drinkable when youre not in the mood for a heavy stout."
"Pours incredibly dark with only a small head that dissapated quickly. As for the taste...wow. The first thing that hits you is all the chocolate, with some nice toasty notes. I just wish it had a little more body and a longer finish. It starts off really nicly on the palate...and just ends. I wanted more of that nice dark chocolate! Waa. Ah well, still a nice fall/winter brew for the cold months."
"This may just be the blackest beer Ive ever had. It pours blacker than tar, and like tar, it was completely impervious to light: no photons made it through this babyreflection city A brown head of fairly long lasting foam rode across the top, lacing a bit. The hops could be teased out of the nose a little, but the malts captured most of that sense. The primary aroma was not at all unlike canned Hersheys Cocoa Powder: the kind my mom used to bake with, not the kind you can mix into chocolate milk. The nose even smelled powdery. The medium full body was pretty roasty, with lots of coffee bean flavors and bitter chocolate to boot. A mellow, subtle sweetness lingered underneath a fairly assertive bitterness all through the glass. Obviously some warmth magnified the malty aspects of this stout, pushing the sweetness forward and bringing the beer more into balance with the bitterness. Neither flavor ever really became assertive, letting the beer create kind of a boring memory of itself: just an aftertaste of slight bitterness and slight roastiness to go along with the finish that thinned out more than Id have liked. Im all for balance, and I think this beer achieved that relatively rare attribute (rare for American beers), but at the expense of character. I really couldnt find too much complexity or flavors of interest. Still, it was a solid beer and one Id drink again."
"Like all Oatmeal Stouts I've had, this one looks beautiful in the glass. Completely black with absolutely no light coming through. It has a nice brown head that clings to the glass on the way down. I could smell chocolate, roasted malt, and a even some alcohol coming through. It was a nice chocolate and oat flavor at first followed by a nice hoppy finish. A very drinkable beer that I will look for again."
"This brew poured solid black with a sort of weak head, there was good lacing though. The aroma was of roasted malt and chocolate. A little bit of coffee was also detectable. The taste was exactly like the nose. The front was roasted malt with bitter chocolate following that. The aftertaste tasted like coffee and was much more bitter than other oatmeal stouts I've had. I thought this brew was very good and very drinkable. It went down smooth and wasn't filling at all. The bitterness goes well following that strong chocolate middle. This would make a good session brew."
"This was a good beer, not great, but I would buy it again. It is rather bitter, but the flavor is not quite full enough or malty enough to balance this bitterness. Also, the beer didn't feel thick enough in the mouth. Maybe my expectations were high due to its appearance in the glass, but this brew could have been ""fuller."" But, like I said, it was still a good beer."
"Pours a black ruby color with a creamy tan colored head that quickly fades into a patchy lace. Nose is sweet roasted malts and oatmeal with notes of dark coffee and bitter chocolate. Smooth and creamy in the mouth but is a bit thin. Taste is burnt coffee and is quite bitter. Not a very complex brew but still enjoyable. However, there are definitely better oatmeal stouts out there."
"Comes out of the bottle a real nice dark black, the head was nice and tan but diminished rather quickly. This is a great tasting oatmeal stout, nice mouthfeel and great coffee and chocolate tastes come through. Good stuff. My only complaint is that its a little on the thinnish side as far as texture and taste are concerned. Once you get to the bottom of the glass and it's not as cold it starts to bring out some more of the beers taste. From a non-experts perspective I give it a thumbs up!"
"An overall good outmeal stout. Nice complexity for a beer without a lot of strength.. Finsh could be more rounded."
"Black and opaque, with a thin but persistant tan head. Aromas of chocolate, coffee, and a touch of sweetness. Flavors blend very nicely... chocolate, coffee, maybe just a hint of caramel sweetness, and a very faint, but perceptable hop flavor. It's very smooth and creamy, with a full body and low carbonation. I really can't find a single flaw with this beer. Wonderfully done!"
"Pours a deep sable with a small slowly-developing head, modest lace.  Aroma consists of dark roasted malts, coffee, and bitter chocolate, with a hint of hops.  Taste begins with rich dark malts, coffee, and bitter dark chocolate, a little hops toward the finish.  A slight bitter chocolate note and some nut flavors linger long after the finish.  Not a particularly complex beer, but very good.  Perfect for a cold winter's day."
"Drinkability: Hearty breakfast, warming lunch on a cold winter day, a filling dinner, an luscious desert after dinner, or a soothing night-cap - it's all in here. This is a tasty stout!"
"Pours a nearly black color with a tan head.  The smell is pretty good with a slight burnt malty notes.  The taste, well was not as pleasing.  It has a very crisp hoppy character that sticks out and is not favorable for an oatmeal stout.  Not creamy at all as the mouthfeel is somewhat watery compared to others in this style.  Not bad, but decent at best.  Cheers!"
"Deep amber/near black in color with a short-lived caramel head.  The aroma was roasted malt with coffee and chocolate undertones and a mild hop appearance.  The flavor was big on roasted/coffee and dry in the finish.  The mouthfeel was smooth and the flavor lasted forever.  It is an extremely drinkable stout and I can't wait for the next one."
"Chocolate syrup anyone?  This thick dark brew is one of the heaviest bodied oatmeal stouts I have tasted.  Even the pour looks like you are pouring dark extract.  The head sticks around for a little bit leaving a bold smoky chocolate malt aroma.  The chocolate malt creates a large part of the flavor with a brush of smoke and a quick dash of spice from the hops.  Hands down the best brew bottled by Breckinridge so far."
"Right away this Oatmeal Stout made me say ""Wow!"" A wonderful and fairly strong smell of chocolate and roasted malt burst out of the bottle. This beer is as black as the forgotten banana with a nice tan head. But... this beer only has a fair blend of flavors. I like chocolate influences just fine but it fades to soon and the coffee flavor is not in tune as to what I would deem enjoyable. There is some oats sweetness. This is not a great Oatmeal Stout by any stretch of the imagination. It is a fair attempt. I would not drink this again unless it was free. Smooth to drink."
"Chocolate and beer do not belong with oatmeal. Not even Wilford Brimley would approve. There are other stouts I would rather have if given the choice. I may have gotten a bad batch but I have had much better Chocolate Stouts since."
"Reddish black in color with a distinct coffee - like roasted barley flavor and bitter.  A bit thin in body for an oatmeal stout, but still demonstrates the ""oat"".  After 1 brew,  the bitterness seems to mellow on the palate. Especially tastey when watching the NHL wings beat the avalanche in a game 7."
"pours out almost pure black, with a healthy tan head.  not much in the nose but a bit of the citrusy hops.  mouthfeel  isn't as smooth as you might like it for an oatmeal stout but the taste is pretty yummy.  dark roasted and chocolate malts are present but not too bitter. in fact they tilt toward the bittersweet side which makes this very quaffable, especially as it warms a bit.  a very tasty rendition of the style."
"Thick, tan head.  Just a tad shy of being black, since a deep red hue can be discerned when held up to a light.  Lots of chocolate malt and a coffee - like roasted barley aroma is quite enjoyable.  Roasted barley bitterness is high, and the hop profile only serves to balance the assertive roasted grain flavors, but does it well.  A bit thin in body for an oatmeal stout, but still manages to possess some of the ""silkiness"" that great OS's have.  It finishes fairly dry with roasted malt bitterness.  This is a good beer, but just needed a bit more body.  I think I'll go for a Shakespeare Stout now."
"Pours black with a dense brown head that laces the glass nicely as you drink. Nutty aroma. Chocolate notes also on the nose. Fairly bitter for an oatmeal stout. Nice taste though. Bittersweet chocolate comes to mind. Medium body. Smooth mouthfeel. A slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall, a fairly solid oatmeal stout."
"12-25-01-This is an ok stout..Good bitter chocolate tones..finish is definitely on the dry side..I get an odd off taste on occasion...maybe a tich of caramel, but it is not real strong and hard to detect. Good creamy head...aroma is average with a faint coffee like scent..Not super thick, but certainly not too watered down....definitely worth trying but I've had better (and worse).."
