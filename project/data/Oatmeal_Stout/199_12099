3.54,-7.3,4.5,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,"D - Can definitely drink more, but not a whole lot of taste going on. Easy to drink, 5% stout though.","Kaiser81","Apr 18, 2009"
4.68,22.5,4.5,4,5,4.5,5,"I normally compare all Oatmeal Stouts to Young's Oatmeal Stout (my current favorite). This offering from Ballast Point did exceptionally well. I would love to do a side by side comparison. The relatively mild abv, combined with the excellent flavors make this truly a world-class beer. If only they could bottle this up instead of only being available on tap!","davexisxrabid","Apr 01, 2009"

3.61,-5.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Not my favorite brew from Ballast Point but a solid oatmeal stout that tastes better served this way than when I had it from a growler in the past, would drink again, recommended","Floydster","Mar 28, 2009"
3.93,2.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Pretty solid Stout and quite robust in the taste profile at times. I wish that the body had a touch more depth to it but overall this drank like a champ on nitro!","Kegatron","Mar 26, 2009"
3.82,0,5,3,4,3,4.5,"D: A nice quaffable stout on nitro, a step up from Guinness IMO. I would like to try it on cask or out of the regular tap to see some more nuance and complexity in the flavour that I know this beer would have.","Halcyondays","Dec 30, 2008"

3.83,0.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Sample at Stone. Pours nearly black with a medium and somewhat foamy tan head that diminishes slowly. Small patches of lacing sliding down the glass. Coffee bean and malt aroma. Medium-bodied with a roasted character and flavors of coffee and malt, as well as touches of dark fruit. Light hops are present at times as well. The finish is roasty with a coffee aftertaste. Straightforward yet above average overall.","Dogbrick","Dec 04, 2008"
3.48,-8.9,4,3.5,4,2,3,"D- Not horrible, not great. If they can tweek it to make it feel a little more rich in body then this'll become a really good stout.","MiScusi","Beers"
3.38,-11.5,4,3.5,3,3,4,"Tap @ O'Brien's. Pours black with a 2 cm tall tan head with nice lacing. Coffee, cocoa, brown sugar, with a lot of oatmeal. Taste is disappointingly weak. Roasted malt, the taste of "Whoppers" candy, oats, and a bitter finish. Good, not great.","magictrokini","0"

3.6,-5.8,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"There is lots of fruit in the flavor too; prunes and raisins are the most noticeable notes. A touch of dusty chocolate is noticeable too. The beer feels very smooth as it hits the tongue, it is not quite creamy (it is too light for this, the lightness does make it really easy to quaff though). In body and mouthfeel the beer is quite light. The beer is actually served quite warm, meaning that it has been served a touch north of 60ºF (ºC). A bitter, burnt malt character couples with a hop bitterness in the finish. Overall this beer is quite dry, despite its fruity overtones. This is quite tasty.","Gueuzedude","Jun 02, 2005"

4.11,7.6,4.5,3.5,4,4,5,"It poured a dark reddish brown color with a nice brown fluffy head that stayed till the end. There was not much going on in the smell department, just some slignt smokiness and burnt grain. The flavor was very good with just the right dose of sweetness and smokiness throughout, and the smoothe mouthfeel made this one go down very eaisy. A solid brew and one I will try again.","Dmann","0"
