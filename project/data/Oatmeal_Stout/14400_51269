Moderate carbonation. Finish is dry and roasty, a little earthy and astringent. Some mouthfeel issues notwithstanding, this is a tasty stout well worth sampling. Great ester presence and the roasted elements are balanced out nicely by some sweet special effects. Down with disease.","CalgaryFMC","Mar 22, 2015"

I could definitely taste the harmonious blend of vanilla and oatmeal that elevated your typical stout flavor to a new level. I picked up more vanilla than oatmeal, though neither was overpowering. Overall, the taste was incredibly smooth, as was the aftertaste, which dropped off appropriately gradually. This beer is incredibly drinkable and didn't taste alcoholic to me at all, despite the 7.2% ABV. I would have enjoyed this beer more if it had leaned a bit more overpowering, either in raw flavor or in heaviness, but as it stands, it felt smooth, light, and balanced. My only real complaint is that the carbonation was weak, which contributed to an average mouthfeel in an otherwise very nice beer. Would definitely drink again, and would probably have more than one at once!","jeff12hoops","Apr 04, 2014"

4.03,4.7,4,4,4,4.25,4,"impressive for a number of reasons. i love the dark sleek look, not shiny or flat, but somewhere in between in terms of luster. smallish head, but good retention and white lacing. i smell vanilla, but its still behind the dark earthen barley roast and a touch of carbon ash as well. minimal sweetness in the taste or the feel, which makes this for me. so many of these come across as sugar bombs, and this one is appreciably dry as well as bitter on the finish. vanilla is also only subtle, playing off the body and sweetness of the oats, but contributing only accents. most vanilla beers going right now are so heavy in vanilla that the beer gets lost, not the case with vanilla oatis, which stays dark and bitter and rich, without ever getting sweet or overbearing. well hidden alcohol strength and a long roasted barley finish. fun and well made beer, among the best ive had from ninkasi.","StonedTrippin","Mar 19, 2014"
3.98,3.4,4,4,4,3.75,4,"Vanilla stout, kinda scary after my first encounter with a vanilla beer was something from the Shock Top line of beers. Since then I have had some really good ones and the Vanilla -phobia is gone. This beer is not the best on I have has but I really enjoyed it. It is a very subtle vanilla in every sense. It is barely noticeable in the nose and also on the taste. More of the roast malt character comes out in the beer with notes of coffee and chocolate. The oatis part of this beer gives it a great mouth feel that complements the sweetness of the beer. This is the perfect beer for someone who doesn't want some beer with their vanilla.","i4ourgot","Mar 15, 2014"

There is a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

Tastes surprisingly bitter but finishes with the same Oatis flavors, malted oats, honey, and a bit of sweet coffee. I was, however, disappointed in the lack of vanilla flavor within this beer. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth but the finish leaves very little taste of any kind of vanilla. Overall, i'm pretty disappointed in this beer.","Jellopants356","0"

3.68,-4.4,3.75,3.75,3.5,4,3.75,"Overall - Sometimes, less is more. Such is the case here with Vanilla Oatis. The standard Oatis is a very, very good oatmeal stout: multi-layerd, with lots of flavor. Adding vanilla melds all those flavors together, making a beer that, at best, hits on two notes. Fair to good beer overall, but I'd take the original version everytime over this variation.","TheSixthRing","Apr 25, 2013"
3.73,-3.1,4,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,"Poured from a 650ml bottle. Pours a deep blackish-brown colour with some nice tan head. The smell is big on creamy chocolate notes. The taste is quite rich with the vanilla showing up as a sort of burnt marshmallow flavour. There's a bit of smoke in there as well as some chocolate and coffee notes. The vanilla component is complementary without domination. Nice.","CookstLiquor","Apr 24, 2013"

4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours pitch black with a fine, one finger light brown head with great retention and lacing. Sweet aroma dominated by vanilla with light toasted malt. Flavor is toasted malt, coffee and quite distinct, but well integrated, vanilla. Starts semi-sweet, finishes dry and crisp with bitter coffee and light hops. Medium, creamy body with nice mouth feel. A nicely made oatmeal stout with deft use of vanilla flavoring, nicely balanced. I'll watch for this the next time it arrives.","LiquidAmber","Apr 05, 2013"
