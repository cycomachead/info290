4.5,2.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Had this on tap at Pizza Port Carlsbad when I was there. Poured a dark black color with about half an inch of mocha-colored head. Scent was out of this world with fresh-brewed coffee and molasses. A bit of charcoal as well. Taste was like Starbucks bitch slapped you in the face. Tons of fresh coffee with some roasted malt and vanilla flavors. Mouthfeel was nice and creamy with slightly bitter finish. Drinkability was very high. Overall, if you love coffee...you will love this beer. I had Funky Buddha's Maple Bacon Coffee Porter a few nights ago, and to me these two beers have the best coffee profile. May need to revisit Speedway Stout since it's been a while. My main point is that it's up there with the best of them.","DovaliHops","Oct 10, 2011"

5,13.6,5,5,5,5,5,"Nice black color with a small ring of tiny bubbles. Its pretty thin, but does leave some slightly syrupy traces around the glass as you swirl. Aroma is a massive wave of dark roast coffee, with the flavor following almost identically, except there are a few slight notes of chocolate with the coffee flavors. As I mentioned it is on the lighter bodied side of things, but also very very smooth and easy to drink. Really is remarkable how much it tastes like pure iced coffee. TRULY a fantastic beer if you’re into these sorts of flavors... cannot wait until I get to try it again! And here I thought coffee bender was going to be the closest beer to an iced coffee I’d ever try","funkyaudio","May 12, 2011"
4.32,-1.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall, this is something I could easily drink on a regular basis and something I can recommend without hesitation to anyone who likes medium stouts, though this tastes and feels like a bigger one and drinks like a smaller one.","EricCioe","May 12, 2011"
4.36,-0.9,3,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Got this beer at the three floyds event at the uchicago pub. Really great event. It pours the blackest of blacks, but there is absolutely no head on this. I was expecting a bit more especially from an oatmeal stout in terms of head. Aroma is outstanding. Great coffee mocha aromas dominate, and every once in a while a bit of citrus hoppiness pops up and says hello. The flavor is a great reflection, with overwhelming coffee and coco and roasted malts, and again, when you least expect it, that american citrus hop character makes its self known. Moutfeel was creamy, light and well carbonated. I never expected I would have a chance to try this beer, but I was really happy I did. It was definitely the highlight of the night.","Agold","Mar 31, 2011"

4.7,6.8,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Pours nearly pitch black with a one-finger tan head. Head retention is really good, as is lacing. The smell is unsurprisingly dominated by cold brewed, dark roast coffee and lighter notes of toasty malt and dark chocolate. Flavor is much the same with the delicious Intellegensia coffee taking center stage. The bitterness from the coffee is noticeably absent with only a beautifully smooth roasted bean flavor remaining. The toasty malt and dark chocolate notes provide nice depth along with some light dark fruit flavors that creep in on the finish. This is a whole lot more complex than many coffee stouts. The full-body is presumably assisted by the oatmeal. The finish is fairly dry, but not overly so, and the alcohol is almost non-existant. The drinkability is quite high due to the complex flavors and absence of intrusive bitterness and alcohol. Pretty much unquestionably the best oatmeal stout I've ever tried, and right there with the best coffee stouts I've had. As this was my first beer of 2011, I think it bodes well for the year.","WeisGuy","Jan 09, 2011"

4.42,0.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours black with a slight tan head and a bit of lacing as it goes down plus a fairly-wide collar as the head falls down. The nose is really strong black coffee plus a bit of roast. Really, really strong coffee. Not too much else there but the coffee is really nice and doesn't need anything else to back it up. The taste is quite similar--roasted malt is certainly there as well as some strong, black, high-quality coffee. Really enjoying this. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I would like it, though the coffee comes through with a nice bitter, roasted feel. Good carbonation levels and goes down quite easily--had quite a bit of this without thinking about it. Huge fan of this though it doesn't quite compare to the Bullfrog Double Coffee, which is the brew I hold every coffee-infused beer up against. Still, one of the better coffee beers that I've had in a long time. Thanks again, Alex.","Thorpe429","Dec 15, 2010"
4.47,1.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Wow. It's like drinking coffee only better. Delicious, creamy, alcoholic, effervescent, malty coffee. It's incredibly smooth and manages to pack a huge coffee aroma and flavor without any bitterness at all. It's medium bodies with a clean mouthfeel. Highly drinkable.","readbaron","Dec 12, 2010"
4.77,8.4,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"I drink lots and lots of black coffee. This beer is more or less just coffee. It smells like coffee and tastes like it but goes down even smoother. No need to get into the details except that it is jet black, lightly carbonated and incredibly drinkable. Really wish they would bottle this and send it to ohio.","beerhan","Dec 11, 2010"
4.69,6.6,4,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Drinkability is exceptional. This is most likely the best coffee stout I have ever had and I think most of the tasting group I was with would agree. Great nose/flavor and only 6% ABV. This would give most imperial coffee beers a run for their money and the coffee aspect is actually better than any other imperial sized beers I've had with coffee. Way to go Three Floyds! I highly recommend seeking this out before its gone.","sisuspeed","Dec 11, 2010"
3.44,-21.8,3.5,4.5,3,3.5,3,"D: I'm really glad I had someone to split the growler with. The coffee flavor is just to intense for me to want a lot of this. Overall, a one-dimensional beer.","glazeman","Dec 09, 2010"
3.42,-22.3,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"As far as looks go, this beer doesn't look much different than any other coffee stout - dark brown/black with a tiny head that quickly fades to nothing. No lacing and no head retention. In terms of smell, it is pure coffee with a tiny hint of fig and burnt roasts. The taste is similar to the smell, but clearly dominated by by the coffee. Overall, this is a drinkable beer, but there isn't a whole lot going on other than the coffee.","airohead2001","Dec 07, 2010"

4.54,3.2,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Tastes great, but a slightly thin body prevents everything from tying together perfectly. It's straightforward and delicious: black coffee up front, dry American hops in the back, big, huge bitterness all throughout.","mynie","Nov 28, 2010"

4.17,-5.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Growler shared by Chris at Halloween tasting, thanks! Pours a opaque hazy coffee brown/black with a small mocha head that disappears fast. Smell is pure espresso with a slightly sweet milk and chocolate malt in the background. Big coffee flavors up front, slightly sweet with lots of coffee grounds following and some bitterness. Somehow it is not overpowering for a coffee stout. Mouthfeel is heavy with mild carbonation, coating and creamy. This is one tasty coffee stout, hopefully they will decide to make it again.","nkersten","Nov 01, 2010"

Roasted coffee, creamy, a little vanilla. The taste is more of the same flavors, but its exceedily good and so damn smooth to drink. This is a beer I need to go out and try fresh and I would highly recommend this.","jrallen34","Oct 30, 2010"

4.15,-5.7,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Drinkability -- The Floyd clan really hits the nail on the head with this coffee oatmeal stout. It leans hard on the coffee to accentuate the malt roastiness. Moreover less malt sweetness than in the usual oatmeal coffee stout. Robust, very well balanced - dare I say tempered? Not too much acrid roast/coffee grounds bitterness. One of the better coffee-centric beers I've ever had.","yeahnatenelson","0"
