"Head dissipates immediately- color has a hint of ruby, like a chocolate cherry Dr. Pepper. I wish the smell had more oatmeal but the taste is very balanced. Not too malty, not too chocolatey, and the aftertaste is very pleasant. Chocolate and coffee linger for a while."
"Smells and tastes like cocoa and espresso. Very smooth, and thin. No bitterness."
""
""
"Great looking beer. Love the aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Slight hop presence and good roasted malts throughout."
""
""
"Dark brown with ruby edges. Some roast on the nose.  Decent roast in the flavor profile is accompanied by a touch of chocolate.  The finish is dry and bitter.  The body is spot on but it's more fizzy than I might have expected."
""
"The beer hits of cocoa, light roasted malt, powdery chocolate and a creamy/almost lactose flavor. A good amount of flavor throughout of creamy chocolate and coffee, but in general a medium beer for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap X x x x"
""
""
""
"The flavor is really the showstopper here as it just unleashes mocha, caramel and vanilla along with having a silky (or velvet) smooth mouthfeel. A great example of the style and a wonderful beer."
""
""
""
""
"O.  Nice if your in the mood for a stout and don't wanna reach for the 11%abv+.  Flavor is kinda mild.  Smells was turning me off a lil at first but the flavor didn't carry some of the deficiencies.  Could be a good french press guinea pig to try different flavors.  I'd have to be in the mood to reach for this one but that being said it does have it's place."
""
""
"Very easy to drink and a good creamy stout option."
""
""
"A bit thinner than I like but overall a good stout"
""
""
""
"O-  Very well put together oat stout!  Probably my favorite!"
""
""
"Not much of a nose on this beer? But nice smooth taste. Getting more chocolate than rolled oats"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty dam good stout think I will have another."
""
"Lighter than other oatmeal stouts, with plenty of sweetness afterwards, but the lack of body has me wondering why it is rated so highly"
""
""
"Good aroma, taste fantastic. Over all good"
""
""
"Bottle poured into tulip during #bottlecherwednesdays at Beachwood BBQ Seal Beach. Appearance is clear, dark brown with two-finger tan head that leaves patchy lacing. Aroma is roasted malt, coffee, cereal, slight chocolate. Taste is similar with balancing herbal bitterness in the finish from the fuggles. Medium body, texture on the thin side, average to soft carbonation, and mildly bitter finish."

"Great beer super creamy makes its almost feel like a nitro beer. Lots of great rich dark flavors nice coffee/ chocolate with some sweetness that is well balanced with a subtle bitterness. No over powering flavors just a really enjoyable beer where everything comes together nicely. The aroma while not strong is very pleasant."
""

"Rich&creamy, hints of coffee and chocolate...outstanding"
""
""

"Hey, I like this beer, I just don't go over the moon for it."
""
"O – Very pleasant, traditional version of an oatmeal stout.  Smooth, nutty, a touch of roast… it’s well made and that is certainly worth saying."
""
""
""
"Tastes like a dark Ipa.  Pretty good"
"O - Real nice wintertime beer."
""
""
""
""
"Firestone Walker has recently increased its footprint in the Richmond area and I couldn't be happier about it. This was yummy."
""
""
""
""
"This beer looks and smells like it should, but the taste falls flat. It starts off nicely, but has a burnt finish that overpowers this otherwise pleasant beer. I'll drink it if you're buying."

"Big cocoa and coffee presence. Coffee dominates, and there's a bit of a harsh bitterness."
""
""
"O - A very nice, balanced stout, and a very easy drinker that will not knock you out after just one.  A rich range of flavors built into a beautiful, cohesive whole."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours pitch black with a brown, 2 finger width foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are decent.  Has an oatmeal and coffee aroma predominantly.  The roasted malts are not that strong as other stouts.  There is a hint of chocolate.  On taste, coffee predominates.  The roasted malts are not as strong, but can detect a lighter taste, perhaps the oatmeal.  Slight chocolate aftertaste.  Overall a very good beer but doesn't stack up to many Imperial Stouts I have had.  It is smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not worth the time. Pretty watery and not too much flavor despite the deceiving nose. I would pair it with smoked brisket or a porcini mushroom rubbed hangar steak. I give it a 83.5/100"
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice stout.  Dark.  Choc. Coffee. Smooth. Very drinkable"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - incredible oatmeal stout!"
""
""
"Cheer all"
""

"Very nice oatmeal stout. Let it warm up a bit and it opens up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's OK...thus the rating of 3.0"
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint.  11/13/14 printed on the label.  Pours an inky black with a loose, quarter inch, tan-colored head that sizzles and pops and slowly dissipates towards the shoulders.  Nose expresses roast, cocoa and a suggestion of artificial sweetener.  Taste follows nose - coffee notes are somewhat reminiscent of coffee syrup.  There's also some flaked outs in there; however, the flavor profile all comes off a bit thin.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with a water texture and a prickly carbonation.  Overall, a decent oatmeal stout but I was expecting a bit more.  I wouldn't mind giving this one a shot on nitro."
""
""
""

"O: Smooth and drinkable, muted but pleasant flavors."
"Would definintely have again; worth trying if happened upon.  (4)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smells like coffee and a hint of chocolate. Initial taste was pretty flat but the more I drank, the smoother it becomes. It is really good, better than continental breakfast stout from butchers brewing. The finish is lacking"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Price Point - $1.89/12 oz single"

"OVERALL: Good stuff. A bit over-carbonated perhaps, but perhaps that’s just the case with this particular batch. Color is a touch lighter than I’d expect as well, but that can be forgiven. A solid brew that I quite enjoyed. Cheers for the gift man!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Amazing oatmeal stout. Smooth, rich, sweet and creamy. Smokey undertones."
"O: A light yet complex ale that increases in complexity as it warms. Sets the standard for a session-able oatmeal stout."
""
"The taste has a nice coffee and dark malt character with that oatmeal and the bitterness is mild at the end. It is quite easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Gotta say right off the bat I was disappointed in this brew as I have thoroughly enjoyed all the other Firestone beers I have had.  It could just be a bad batch I presume, but it is hard to say. The beer is very black, almost too black to be enjoyable considering the horrid burnt wood taste.  It is nowhere as thick as other stouts and it took me several weeks to finish this 6 pack off.  Overall I have a very high opinion of Firestone Walker and would rate it as one of the top 3 breweries in the state of California, but I have to say this really was just not that great.  Not terrible, but just not worth the time or money."
""
""
""
""
"A little too boozy for my taste. I would expect an oatmeal stout to be more creamy"

"Overall- Amongst all the high abv stouts the lower abv stouts can be overlooked too frequently.  However, Velvet Merlin is a great stout that does a few great things rather than a bunch of average things."

"Pours dark as the night leaving behind a trace of lacing which remains persitant for the glass. Very mild yet quite on point mixture of coffee and chocolate and roasted oats. A touch of bitterness smoothed out by the chocolate and perhaps a touch of vanilla. The finish is quite sublime. Silky smooth and incredibly easy to drink. Very light yet offering some complexity. Hoping that it improves further with age."

"Overall:  easy drinking stout.  Balanced extremely well.  Great gateway stout for non dark beer drinkers.  Would buy again."
""
""
"Overall - This is a very good oatmeal stout and is true to style. If you're looking for a good stout, try this one. 9/10"
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass."
""
"t/m/o - picks up where the nose leaves off with a really nice full bodied roasted bakers chocolate. Oaty and full. Silky smooth and easy drinker with a decent amount of char.  Worth checking out."
""
""
""
"Pours black.  In a blind taste I would have called this a coffee porter.  Thinner than I expected, more coffee flavor than I expected and more bitter than I expected.  I was expected a thicker mouth feel and a sweeter flavor.  A good beer but my rating will be lower than others."
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"

""
""
""
""
"Solid dark brown black color with a decent sized tan head that shows moderate retention. Aromas of creamed coffee and chocolate dominate. Light earthy hop, cereal grain, and a faint pitted fruit round out the aroma nicely. The flavor is rich mocha with just a touch of vanilla. Light earth and fruit for posterity. Medium body with a creamy silky mouthfeel and a light level of carbonation. I could drink the hell out of these given half a chance."

""
""
""

"A very nice stout. Soft, smooth and balanced. Not a bitter roast bomb at all. Highly drinkable and satisfying. Merlin strikes again! (4.5)"

"After coming here for a few years I made an account specifically to comment on this brew. I hate to trash a beer from a brewery I love but wow this is bad. Watery mouth-feel, caustic scent, absolutely bitter taste with zero other qualities. I don;t think I've ever seen a BA Score (90, currently) I disagree with more. Maybe I just got a bad batch?"

"O: I love it. I'm partial to stouts, especially oatmeal stouts, so the numbers may be slightly skewed, but if it weren't a good stout I would rate it low, so take it at as it is. Because of the coffee/espresso notes, I would consider this a great dessert beer. Who am kidding, this would be great for breakfast or anytime."

"Pours a nice dark brown with a short head that quickly dissipates. Smells nice like oatmeal and very fresh. Taste is suprisingly clean and fresh without any heaviness. Nice and crisp and clean for such a dark beer. Nice carbonation and not syrupy like other darker beers. I really enjoyed this one."

"O: 3.75 A nice drinking stout with good flavors, but there are better examples of the style out there. I’ll probably stick with my one six-pack per season."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A very nice and enjoyable stout that is easy to drink."
""
""
""
"The beer is near black with a half inch of beige head. Scents of bread, roast, chocolate. Smooth on the palate. Flavors include char, roast, chocolate, and a hint of coffee beans. Easy drinking and overall, a solid example of the style."
"The beer pours an extremely light head that dissipates very quickly. Some head is still left and the color is a creamy brown color. The beer itself is an opaque dark brown that is a little bit black and dark. The beer smell has strong oatmeal notes and dark chocolate notes. Some roasted malt smell comes out but not much. The oatmeal smell is pretty nice and ... oatmealy. The beer flavor is very similar to the smell with strong creamy oatmeal notes with a side of sweet dark chocolate. The taste also has an interesting slightly metallic water taste that adds to the eflavor and provides a nice balance. The mouthfeel is heavy bodied with biting carbonation. The beer feels fairly smooth and goes down smooth as well. Overall, a very good oatmeal stout and one worth getting again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I liked the beer, but when I think of oatmeal stout I always think about smoothness and creamy texture, this beer really didn't have a great mouthfeel and brought down the overall score more than mouthfeel normally does. I really don't think this is firestone walker's best brews."
""
""
"Poured a almost black body with khaki head that left some pace patches. Smell is of roasted and sweet malts, akin to some coffee and chocolate with possible nuts (hazel) or toffee, maybe caramel. The oatmeal is noticeable as it smoothes down a light bodied beer (light for a stout) and helps balance a light coffee/roasted malt edge with some minor chocolate and toffee like sweetness. Little bit of woodiness on this beer as well and at times there seems to be a boozy, dry finish."
""
"p.s. Turns out this is a late spring/early summer release (at least here in MD). Still looking for some Easy Jack and Opal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A fairly good but not exceptional brew. For an Oatmeal Stout, I would rather have a Samuel Smiths."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A classic example of a beer that tastes better than it smells. It's not amazing, but it works nicely enough - I think its status of ""that FW beer we DON'T get on the East coast"" propped it up too high on my pedestal. Speaking of...hey FW, bring Pivo Pils to MD, right now!"

"Jet black, not a lot of head going on here. Very roasted nose with licorice and molasses scents up front. First sip comes across very smooth; big time oatmeal graininess, dark roast coffee, anise, very little hop bitterness. Carbonation is appropriate but almost seems a touch too much; a little smoother would have been nicer. All in all a good oatmeal stout, just surprisingly heavy on the licorice and anise undertones."

"Pours a dark coffee black with a tan head that dissipates relatively fast. A lot of roast and black coffee on the nose with subtle chocolatey undertones. The taste is creamy and smooth with plenty of black coffee and a noticeable oatmeal presence. There is some metallic and sour presence on the finish but this is not unwelcome. This is a really smooth stout with about as much to offer as an oatmeal stout needs to offer. Probably the best basic oatmeal stout I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wonderful oatmeal stout, with a sense of chewy depth, and big aromas. Would like to grab this guy in the style often, but it's never around these parts. Glad to finally get my hands on this one."
""
"Overall - A local, cask conditioned Stout in Southern California? What a treat! If this beer had a bit more character, I would have given it fives across the board."
""
""
"The Velvet Merlin poured a deep brown with ruby highlights with a slight tan but effervescent head. The aroma held chocolate and sweet malt roastiness. The flavor followed suit with chocolate, toasted malt and added hints of coffee. It left a slight bitterness on my palate between sips but the roasted chocolate quickly took center stage. The bubbly body was much lighter than the brews appearance and was light and lively. The Velvet Merlin was a top tier Oatmeal Stout."

"O - This is a great oatmeal stout. I would put it right up there with any that I have tried so far."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I love oatmeal stouts, probably my favorite style and this is an excellent one. Very easy drinking, would be great with some baby back ribs. Love the sweetness on my lips after every drink. Highly recommend this one."
""
"Overall, a nice oatmeal stout, but nothing mindblowing like FW's hop-forward and barrel aged beers. There are other lowish ABV stouts that I would likely pick up off the shelf before I reached for this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"no sign of oats used. The beer is much too crisp, thin, and refreshing for an oatmeal stout. Those are attributes I want in other beer styles, not an oatmeal stout."
""
""
""
""
"O: there's no doubt that FW knows what they're doing and this beer shows well the excellent control they have at the time of brewing."
""
"Overall: For a low gravity stout, this is not bad. Reminiscent of a Porter, with hints of flavoring, but not really my definition of a stout."
""
""
"Pours out a deep ruby brown with a thin head. Smells of chocolate, raisins, and lightly burnt toast. Flavor is big on malts, dried fruits, medium roast coffee and chocolate malts. Fruity esters and earthy hops. Finishes really dry. Mouthfeel is fairly light and prickly. I expected fuller from an oatmeal stout. This is a really solid stout. If it were a little lighter in alcohol, I could session this. I love the dryness in this."
"o - solid oatmeal stout, this is a good 'session' stout for sure. i could easily polish of a few of these."

"O: pretty good with just a hint of the alcohol showing through; it came off as closer to raisins with loads of oak-wood notes for me -- others in my party immediately said ""coffee"". none of us detected any chocolate, so it's just a bit darker than other oatmeal stouts but still very much in line with the style."

"super awesome taste. a little sweet, kind of roasty malts, dark fudge (as the last guy said), vanilla and honey (as another guy said), milk chocolate... what an awesome taste! a little tang on the finish, but that is utterly in significant considering all the wonderful flavors going on with this brew. I am really surprised at how much I like this brew. I had the merkin and the sucaba and anniversary, etc.... but never felt I wanted to try this one and I regret not trying it sooner! this is a world class beer! I thought it was labeled a porter but it says stout(?). I have to give this one high marks for every category. I wish I had another one to follow this one up RIGHT NOW!!!!"

"O - Overall, enjoyable stout. Bigger beer than the ABV would indicate. Super thick in feel and a bit heavy. Nice with dessert."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Features the usual chocolate and roast malt flavors but the mix and creamy mouthfeel just makes this a better tasting oatmeal stout. Mild something in the back - orange mint? Bigger body than 5.5%."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The flavor is good but not spectacular or overly complex. I feel the mouthfeel is off for the style and detracts from the beer. This is a very drinkable brew but not a world class beer. Even Firestone Walker hits singles sometimes."
"Overall - Really good. Smooth, easy to drink and enjoy. Balanced really well and nothing is overdone flavor wise. Only gripe keeping this world class is the finish is a little watery, weak. Still solid and worth a drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - an easy drinking stout that reminds me more of a rich, coffee stout, as opposed to an oatmeal stout."
"O: Lighter in body than I was expecting. It seems better suited to its warmer home climate than the dead of winter here in the northeast, where a more robust beer is often preferred. Still a good beer, and it offers enough complexity and nuance to keep it from feeling boring."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An excellent oatmeal stout. Nice and chewy with malty complexity. Great brew for a winter's day. I will look for this in bottles."
""
""
"A great beer from Firestone Walker that gets lost amongst their other bigger beers. Very sessionable, with tons of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice and chewy body with that oaty bitterness. The roasted malts has a dark cocoa flavor and a bit of char. Almost in the favor of burnt sugars, but it's not as sweet as most milk stouts. It still has a bit of that lacticity, in the way that some coffees have a higher acidity. A little nutty. Could use burlier notes. Carbonation is almost ideal, but perhaps short on the light side. A good winter stout with a mild hop presence."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O/D-I have always wanted to try this beer. I was a bit disappointed, especially having Velvet Merkin first. It's a nice, very drinkable Oatmeal Stout. That's it, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very tasty beer that should be allowed to warm so the flavors can expose themselves. Great mouthfeel and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Thick and flavorful, with more milk chocolate and smooth dark malt notes. Dry finish but maintains a quite moderate hop presence. Nicely done and well worth a try if ya see this available in your local area."

"Taste was very one dimensional and flat. I got nothing but roasted bitter notes of coffee. And that was it. It was not accompanied by any sort of sweetness like chocolate or malt, it was just coffee water residue. I clearly must have gotten a dud because I see this is rated a 90, unless I'm crazy or the world is crazy, this was not a good beer and I actually poured it down the drain after about 10 sips. I tried!"

"D - A rock solid Oatmeal Stout (which shouldn't be a surprise coming from Firestone Walker who does everything)... Not world class, but way better than average... Highly enjoyable... Loaded with character and complexity... All with a 5.5% ABV bow wrapped around... All components work well together and the end result is a brew that seems to be a bit more than the sum of its parts... Nicely done..."

"O - A very solid offering into a style that doesn't always bring too much excitement (minus the Imperial and BA versions). Very drinkable, with enough complexity to satisfy the connoisseur as well."
"64oz growler from Top Hops. Pours a dark blackish brown with a small amount of head. Minimal lacing. The aroma is vanilla, caramel, chocolate chip cookies, and hints of light and sweet coffee. The taste is roasted malts and vanilla upfront. Caramel, chocolate, and sweet coffee. Vanilla and caramel finish. A bit light. Moderate amount of carbonation. Overall, decent Oatmeal Stout I'd buy every once in awhile."

"Solid oatmeal stout, for the style it's got an exceptional nose and mouthfeel. The flavour profile doesn't quite live up to the rest of the beer, but it's a solid seasonal six-pack from Firestone Walker. Probably the first one from them I've actually enjoyed."

"Overall: I'm a huge oatmeal stout fan and this has to be one of my favorites. It has it all, smooth roasted, chocolate, coffee flavors, smooth creamy mouthfeel, most of all is the roasted malt flavors and aromas that stand out, great oatmeal stout and one of my winter favorites."

"O - A dangerously drinkable brew from FW. The coffee, chocolate, and oats mesh incredibly well and the smooth mouthfeel make this one of my favorite oatmeal stouts."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a dirty, but rinsed, Delirium glass. medium black with brown head that fades into very light light brown lacing and dissipates medium/soon. Tastes like an old shoe in a good way. Dark, aged fruit (dates, burnt grain) with a high drinkability factor. Alcohol factors too prevalent, considering the only 5.5% and thus cuts down on mouth and taste. Smooth and balanced, but not too excitable. If one was to drink dark ales for hours and hours, this would be the beer. Goes well with tobacco and chocolate, though the flavors are unremarkable on their own. Firestone makes very solid beer, and this is no exception. But, considering, it could be much better."

"Everything clicks here. Inviting aromas, impressive appearance, delicious flavors and nice body. At 5.5 ABV, I may have found my new go-to session brew."

"Atmosphere is pretty nice. Slight head, and light lacing. Nose is roasty and malty, with accentuates of coffee and chocolate. Tastes like it smells... light roasted coffee, components of sweet dark chocolate, the light pungency from the oatmeal, and a bit of bitter. Well balanced collection of components. Overall, this is a really good quaff."

"First review on here, though far from my first beer... Pours pitch black with a thin, off-white head that doesn't linger. Roasty and subtle chocolate aroma. Significantly thinner body than other Oatmeal Stouts I've experienced. Heavy roasted malt flavor, not much sweetness, weak coffee aftertaste. Bitterness from hops is very noticeable, but no hop aroma. Odd, bubbly finish. If you like roasty stouts this may be your thing but sadly it's not mine."
"O - 3.75 - It's a good oatmeal stout. nothing I can complain about too much. If I could change it I'd want it a little bit stronger with a little thicker mouthfeel."
""
""
""
"Bottle courtesy of a BA trade. Pours inky black with tan colored head that went away almost immediately. Good legs, okay lacing. Aroma is faint. I'm only getting deep malt with a touch of brown sugar. Taste is much different, still the heavy malt character, interesting oat flavor, faint hop earthiness, brown sugar/caramel. Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin. Not nearly as syrupy as I was hoping for from a oatmeal centered stout. I'm surprised this beer becomes so damn tasty in the barrels. Merkin is considerably better. Maybe I shouldn't have aged this one. Who knows?"

"Overall: This is a wonderfully great example of what I think an oatmeal stout should be. Not overpowering and boozy, with a nice lingering afterthought that tells you that you just enjoyed a fine beer. Can't wait to try the barrel aged Velvet Merkin. Thanks Firestone!"
""
""
""
""
"The Bourbon barrel influence is quite subtle in the aroma, I wasn’t expecting a whole lot of Bourbon character here, but it is definitely quite reduced from Velvet Merkin. In the flavor it is soft, but it is also noticeable; I do like that it was kept at a very low level here, but I almost feel like it could use a touch more as I almost feel like it is too subtle. That can be a dangerous thing though, as I definitely prefer that the barrel character be kept fairly low. Still, this is a fantastic beer and is something I am quite happy to have a 6-pack of (the $6.99 price doesn’t hurt either); the extra boost of smooth complexity from the Bourbon barrel really adds something to this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I would have it again, though likely won't be scouring the shelfs for it."
""
"Velvet Merlin is a pretty good oatmeal stout all around, but it really wasn't a mind-blowing or incredible experience for me, and there are certainly some options that are more local to me that I'd take over it (New Holland's The Poet, or even Rogue's Shakespeare, as much as I hate Rogue and their business practices... but that's neither here nor there). Really good, but not legendary."

"The flavor profile is acceptable, if unremarkable. The problem lies in the exceedingly thin mouthfeel and excessive carbonation, both of which go contrary to everything I look for in a stout. It's almost like drinking a stout-flavored soft drink, and I say this as one who has great respect for Firestone Walker and had high expectations for this brew. It's drinkable, but far from what I was hoping for. Light and thin does not an oatmeal stout make..."
""

"Overall I am impressed it drinks better than my all time favorite ""Anderson Valley oatmeal stout"" yet its around the same ABV. If I ever get the chance at a case I will be sure to pick it up."

"Velvety smooth mouth. The oats do what they do best really mellowing this beer out. Sweet chocolate kiss, dry bark like taste, finish of vanilla cream. Really a good beer. A well-made treat, that is another I'd love to see around this area. Oh well, thanks for the bottle, Ed!"

"Poured into a Forestinne branded tulip glass. Pours dark as shit - like motor oil with a decent sized tan head that sticks around for a few sips - decent lacing. Smell is smoky and earthy, faint scent of hops, fresh milled grain, dark chocolate and iced coffee. Flavor is much more bright and interesting than the nose suggests - plum, burnt raisin, earthy roasted coffee, vanilla, sweet toffee, cocoa nibs, slight hint of fresh cut grass - absolutely delicious! Medium bodied and perfectly carbonated for the style - smooth and creamy - extremely easy drinker for a stout. Overall amazing stout, that as mentioned, drinks ridiculously easy - could crush a few of these in a single sitting, no problem!"
""
""
""
""
""
"The smell is good overall but a does of phenols is getting in the way, a touch too strong to meld in with the better flavors. Malts are more roasted than I like in an oatmeal stout, yet this beer comes up a little thin when compared to the non oatmeal variety. I think it is a line sitter than cannot quite decide what it wants to be. Still, a tasty effort overall, definitely smooth and drinkable."
""
"Got in a trade with swingracex. 12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 2/21/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear almost opaque dark brown color with a 1 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, oats, toast, brown bread, light coffee, floral, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roasted malt notes with oats and light hops. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, oats, roasted malt, toast, brown bread, light coffee, floral, and roasted earthiness. Slight earthy roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, oats, roasted malt, light coffee, toast, and light earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of roasted/bready malt flavors with oats and light hops; with nice robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish; moderately dry on the finish as well. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice oatmeal stout. All around nice flavor balance and robustness; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"never really cared for this one before, always had a hint of dull, dry, bitter, but tonight i opened one that's been sitting in the fridge for a while, and the hint above is not there, it's picked up a hint of chocolate/licorice, and it's creamy, much nicer feel than before. tonight was straight from the bottle, but in the past, poured in a glass. color is typical dark. one i'll revist . . ."

"O: I believe the label had a ""best by"" or ""bottled on"" date of Dec 2012 - might explain some of the oxidized flavors, if the former.... either way, one of the more solid, somewhat more authentic takes on this style I've come across... I could drink it again"

"I always sit in a position at the bar where I can get a perfect view of this one betting poured. I love the tan head not as dark and sexy as KBS but it is just right. There is something about this beer that takes me back to my childhood when I used to eat half-melted ice cream with a spork from the paleta man. I often imagine myself eating Velvet Merlin with a spork. The aroma is not immediately prominent until you take a drink. That thick head keeps it all in. You inhale slightly when you drink too, right? Of course you do. I enjoy the aroma and the taste very close together with this one. Almost at once. It is nutty, chocolatey, caramely, roasty, and malty and all in a perfect balance. Not one exceeding the other. Like a group of sexy women walking abreast towards you in slow motion. For me? Fuggles is a funny name for hops. I get taken to another place when I'm enjoying this outstanding beer. It is unfortunate that it is not available year round. See you again in the fall!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy dark brown. Thick tan head that dissipates very quickly. Mild aroma of roast grain and cocoa. Flavor is stronger but similar, with moderate roastiness and cocoa powder. Very thin (for a stout) mouthfeel and dry finish. The beer doesn't taste bad but I was very disappointed by the thin mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied with the thickness and smooth flow that one expects from an oatmeal stout. Carbonation is of medium to medium-low intensity, resulting in a gently foamy, slightly medium-heavy overall mouthfeel, well suited for the beer and the style. Closes quite dry, with substantial stickiness lingering upon the palate and lips."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a decent smelling and tasting brew, but I feel let down by the completely lackluster appearance and mediocre feel. Perhaps I got a bad bottle, but thin and watery is not how I prefer my oatmeal stouts. I am also surprised by how this beer's flavor profile blossomed at 65 degrees. In other words, this beer is something of an enigma for me."

"It's not an easy beer to brew because the balance between malt sweetness, hop bitterness, and dark malt acidity is so important; yet Firestone Walker has pulled it off. Quite nice!"

""
""
"O- This big black malt flavor is nice with some inky qualities but the finish and body really get thin a lot as it opens up and there isn’t much to support that big malt flavor. It would be nice to have some alcohol or hops or sweetness to finish what the flavor starts."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a dark, deep near black, moderate cap of grayish tinted tan froth. Scent is dark, roasty with some ash and char, notes of spent coffee grinds, bitter cocoa, some leafy hops thrown in and a touch of dark berries. Taste follows scent... dark and roasty, coffee, grains, cocoa, leafy hops, dark berry. Expected a bit more body and smoothness from style. Decent oatmeal stout, doesn't wow in any particular way."
"Overall: This one is a winner. I definitely recommend grabbing a few bottles if you can find it. It doesn't rank up there with some of the great imperial stouts, but it's certainly one of the best sessionable stouts out there."

"O- A very solid oatmeal stout that packs a lot of flavor into an unassuming beer."

"O - Balanced but generally unimpressive for Firestone. No particular flavor is overwhelming present. Not velvety smooth as I would expect an oatmeal stout to be."

"Very dark, but a clear cola color against the light with a thin tan head with decent retention. Lots of chocolate in the nose with a slight roasted coffee tinge. Caramel also plays a vital role. Flavor is very chocolatey also, but dry like baker's chocolate, and bitter as well. Caramel and somewhat sweet like chocolate milk, this finishes with earthy hop bitterness. Feel is somewhat creamy (would like more cream) ad thin, finish is very dry. Interesting, but wouldn't buy a sixer. Then again, I'm not one to enjoy most oatmeal stouts. Could fit the profile better."

"The Firestone Wqalker Velvet Stout is good. The beer pours an opaque dark with thin, almost non-existent hear that is leaving a very spotty lace. The smell carries waffs of coffee/espresso. The taste carry a nice bitter burst with good coffee and roast. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a great session stout. Perfect for a winter tailgate."
"Overall (4/5): Velvet Merlin is good, not great. Firestone has brewed a very drinkable, though simple and mild stout. I prefer my stouts to be a bit bolder. I know some people (weirdos, all) that would prefer this approach. But if you're an oatmeal stout aficionado, maybe you'll find virtues in Velvet Merlin my palate doesn't appreciate as well. My own stylistic preferences asides, I do think this is still a very respectable beer even if it's not by any means a show stopper."
""
"O - A pretty good effort, more sessionable version of an oatmeal stout than others I've had. I do like them ""stouter"" though...Ipswich outdoes this one IMO."
"O - Good not great oatmeal stout. Typical flavors. Nothing outstanding. For a seasonal release and an oatmeal stout, the ABV should be higher."
""
""
""
""
"O-Some really nice sweet malt character. Tastes like a robust brown ale, missing some of the characters I like in a stout."
"From notes. Opaque dark-brown with highlighting along the edges of the glass. The aroma, unlike the flavor, was fantastic. There are notes of chocolate, coffee, roasty malt, dry oak and a well-balanced bourbon flavor that meshed very well unlike some bourbon barrel-aged beers. The taste had all of these flavors, but they were far more muted. The bourbon flavor became almost watery. The feel may have been the real culprit. It was much too thin for a stout, much less a barrel-aged stout. A cask would likely bring out the creamy lush mouthfeel of the oatmeal stout. At any rate, it was still a good beer, and they get points for not overwhelming a relatively small stout with bourbon barrel-aging. Would be nice to see it in a cask. Edit (12/2/10): Bottle. I’ve been drinking this regularly since six-packs arrived and like it even better now. Excellent chocolate aroma/flavor, little bourbon. Smooth. Tons of flavor for the size. Great stout."
""
""
""
""
"12oz, bottled 12/04/2012, pours dark brown topped with a foamy beige head that holds decent retention. Aromas and tastes are similar with oatmeal, chocolate, faint coffee, background toasted grain, roasted barley, kind of smells and tastes like how a bag of freshly cracked roasted barley smells. Mouth-feel is exceptionally smooth and creamy, while having a medium-to-full body. Overall, not a whole lot of complexity, but this brewery knows how to streamline a good, solid beer."
""
""
"Drinks like an oatmeal stout but ultimately disappointing, lots of burnt, ashy and raw grain flavors get collected on the palate before a nice coffee bitterness and drying take over. FW makes great beers but this is closer to the bottom of their list."

""
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent oatmeal stout. Inexpensive and overall tasty."
""
""
""

"This is an excellent stout with a great nose and wonderful flavor. However, I would have liked it to be more oatmealy and a bit smoother. It is a solid beer and for the price it is hard to beat. Perhaps if I could try it on tap I would enjoy it more. Normally, I enjoy everything I have by Firestone Walker."

"Velvet Merlin pours dark w little head. I like to swirl half the unpoured stout before pouring the rest in the glass to give it more bang. Smells wonderful - coffee and chocolate dominate. Mouthfeel is rather thin - certainly not creamy or velvety. Tastes pretty good though, like how it smells. In addition to coffee and chocolate, there's a hint of caramel note and slight sweetness. Very easy to drink (2 bottles go down like water). Love it with dark chocolate covered pretzels. The stout tastes more complex after."
""
"O: I compensated a bit with the taste score, because this beer should get a 100... out of 5... on the mouthfeel, and I can't do that. One of my top 20, and maybe the best value in that respect. I can get six of these for less than a quarter of the price of some of the others I've tried that are better. Get a six pack when it's available if you like smooth oatmeal stouts. This is the best of it's style (well, the bourbon barrel aged version, Velvet Merkin, is a little better)."

Not too sweet here, all the flavors complement each other nicely without allowing one to become to overbearing; sweet, bitter, toasted, faintness of alcohol to name a few. A great stout overall. Highly recommended indeed."

"This beer was one of the reasons I became a stout drinker. Last evening yet again I came to know just why I love this beer.

""
""
"OVERALL: This is about as much bang for your ABV as you are going to find in a beer. At 5.5% it is rich, big and filling. It drinks more like an 8-10%er."
""
"O: A great, smooth stout for the cold winter nights. Simple and balanced with good drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: as previously stated, this brew lacks complexity but it makes up for it in its balance. there is a bit more of a body to this one than other oatmeal stouts that I have had in the past which is always a plus in my book. decent beer all the way around, but nothing to get to get excited about."

""
""
""
""
"I recommend this beer... if it is distributed to your area."
"A very good oatmeal stout by FW, especially for its budget offering. I could definitely have more of these due to its rich, full-bodied experience at such a good price. Great stuff by FW, and I could definitely have more."
""
"O: From look to feel, a textbook oatmeal stout that seems to border on a milk stout at times. I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
"Overall great beer. Pleasantly flavorful and drinkable for being a lighter brew, especially at 5.5% Definitely one of the better oatmeal stouts. Must try, in my opinion."
"Sets the new standard for an oatmeal stout. Roasty and smooth. It makes me hungry and that's what it should do. Malted goodness layered with chocolate and happiness."
""
""
""
""
"O: It's decent, I'm definitely a little disappointed as FS usually delivers. It's not bad but not great."
"As a non-bourbon barrel aged oatmeal stout, this is excellent and more in line with what I expect from FW not the disappointment when I expected it to be a Merkin. Deleted my Merkin review."

"Overall: I like Firestone, and this was a decent attempt, but the brew lacks the follow through I feel it ought to have. I don't see myself getting up for another bottle."

"I decided to go ahead and have a few tonight, though usually stouts aren't my favorite type of beer, and wow, these were much better than I expected. Usually I prefer reds and other dark ales, but these ones really are fantastic. This beer has a smooth, rich flavor, and after my fourth one, I'm still enjoying the taste of it. I'd love to try this in a recipe to see how it affects baked goods."

"This is a spectacular Oatmeal Stout. Sweet, creamy and easy drinking. Huge coffee notes and nuttiness. The partial blend from the Bourbon Barrels make this really nice."
"O - Excellent oatmeal stout. A flavorful blend of milk chocolate and coffee. A true delight."

""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Nicely balanced with a really good smooth mouthfeel."
""

""
"This is a pretty good oatmeal stout. There don't seem to be a lot of them out there to try really. Nice toasted and malty smoked tones that stay consistent. Been a while since I've gotten a nose like this that I can remember. Smooth, well constructed, even. I like it."
""
"Wooo this is a great stout! Black body with a thick head. Roasty, chocolately aroma and flavor. Ultra creamy, nay, velvety mouthfeel that just slides down your throat. This brewery is on the rise and for good reason. Every new brew from these guys gets me excited and they deliver a surprisingly large amount of the time."
""
""
"The beer is a dark color Oatmeal Stout with a small head. A bit of a tobacco or coffee flavor was the one thing that stood out to me. I love dark beer and the taste was pleasing. The signs claim Firestone is 3x brewery of the year. I can see why - this one I was unfamiliar with but Velvet Merlin instantly appeared in my top 5 favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Tasty, but velvet merkin wins."
"Review from 10/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a dark, dark red amber with a rim of foam and no lacing. Dark and roasted malt aroma. Starts rather thin, with dark, sweet and roasted malts. Finish is quite robust with malts and a nice coffee flavor. Way above average for a low ABV stout. Worth trying again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Comes out of the tap a dark-chocolate brown just a few whiskers above black with a thick tan head. Strong, smoky aroma has rich notes of chocolate, quality coffee and licorice. Mouth-filling, smoky flavor delights the taste buds with molasses, coffee, chocolate and licorice - a liquid feast. Sweet and hop-bitter hints balance each other nicely. Texture has full body and plenty of fizz. Magically delicious. ;)"

"I can't get over how easy this drinks. A somewhat tame flavor profile, I'd like it to be a little more robust in spots, but it would take away some of the other good qualities."
"M/O - Medium bodied. A nice Oatmeal Stout."
""
""
""
"O- this beer is dangerously drinkable. Love it"
""
""
"Pours nice dark brown with a solid sheet of light graham foam. Nose is dry and oaty with a solid stout biscuit and cracker malt profile with hints of cocoa and just the slightest hint of herbal hops. Flavor follows suit with great roasty flavors and simply tastes like a great all around stout. Medium on thin bodied with hi carb for the style. I like mine a little smoother just toning down the carb or upping the body. Good beer, very drinkable and easily available. Happy to have this around and happy to drink when available."

"O: Very, very drinkable. I wish I could of tried it a little fresher since it was bottled 1/24/12, but still good enough to get a feel for what it is. Pretty solid."

"While nothing earth shattering here, it's hard not to be impressed with a beer showing this much flavor with such low alcohol. Pretty impressive really..."

"If you're wondering about the name change, Velvet Merlin WAS formally called Velvet Merkin. They got into some PR trouble (Google Merkin and you'll see why) so they avoided the hassle and changed it to Merlin. I was up at the brewpub in Paso Robles some weeks ago and they've named another beer Velvet Merkin, a sort-of 'big brother' to the Merlin (I think it was the Merlin, barrel-aged, but I could be wrong and I don't feel like looking it up right now). Whatever you want to call it, for a low ABV oatmeal stout, you could do a lot worse. This is widely available here in San Diego and it's become a sort of session-stout for me. Smooth and toasty and tasty."
""
"O. A bit disappointed in this way too dry. Decent flavor. Both this and the bourbon barrel aged version didn't really do it for me. Too chalky."
"Overall - The appearance of this beer once poured was really great. A beautiful fluffy/rocky/foamy head. Oh ya, it tasted pretty good too. Although there are better oatmeal stouts available to me locally."
"O: A very nice oatmeal stout. Recommended. Would have again. Drinkable, smooth, and pleasant."
""
""
"Cheers!"

"Overall a very drinkable stout, one that I will certainly seek out again. Quite tasty."

"Beer takes on typical stout form: black with tan head, which doesn't retain, to describe it more, I have no claim. Smell is fairly faint in the form of the following facets: coffee, chocolate, and roasted malt; however, these characteristics are quite bold, and is best served not too cold. Mouthfeel is creamy and rich; Velvet Merlin seems full bodied, but by alcohol volume it's nary as such. I would imagine quite a night, drinking six of these, and not dehydrate, or overindulge; Velvet Merlin, a single strength stout, I can easily afford."
""
""
""
""
"o: good stout, but to me is more like a milk than a oatmeal. none the less still worth trying."
"O - Damn, this beer had an excellent nose. The flavors and body are just above average for me. I wish I could buy this though, its a nice and simple oatmeal stout that does everything right. It doesn't stand out, but its a safe bet."
"O- Would absolutely buy again. Love this beer."
""
""
"D -GOOD to try."
""

"Lots of roasted malt in the flavor. It's medium-bodied and pretty dry. It's somewhat reminiscent of Samuel Smith's OS, but without the nice, creamy sweetness. Overall, it's not bad, but it's a bit dry for my palate and therefore is far from the best OS I've had. I expect more creaminess in this style."
"Taste is straightforward with all your basic stout flavors and hints of oatmeal. Medium bodied, but definitely too thin for the style. An oatmeal stout really needs more body. A nice stout overall, but give me Breakfast Stout instead please :)"
"Overall: Solid stout. Some rich flavors, but kept in line by punchy bitterness. More depth of flavor than the usual 5.5% ABV American stout, further underscoring the skill of Firestone Walker's brewers."
""
""
""
"Despite the slightly disappointing mouthfeel, it's a quality stout, well worth sampling."
""
""
"Medium bodied with great carbonation, this beer is silky smooth and easy-sipping. The body is a bit light but that does not seem to affect its ability to transfer flavors. This also helps to prevent the beer from being sticky or coating. The carbonation is a bit fizzy but does not seem to interfere with the experience and creates an excellent swallow."
""
""
"A very unimposing, tasty stout."
""
""
"Awesome Oatmeal Stout. Smokey quality is the only thing holding me back from a couple 5's."
""
"Poured a dark brown-black, nearly opaque, with a small cap of off-white head that receded to a patchy layer and left a bit of lacing on the glass. Aroma was heavy with roast: coffee, dark malts, underlying cocoa. More roast on the taste, oatmeal and toasted grains, coffee, cocoa, roasty bitterness, with a definite sugary sweetness in the background. Medium-bodied, creamy, but still a bit on the light/watery side for the style, and not as completely balanced as it should be. Still very good though, and quite drinkable overall."
"Overall, it is very medium bodied and pleasant. I like it. But not an exceptional stout by any means."
"D - Very Chocolaty (like having a large bite of your favorite chocolate ice cream...you can mention your's, mine is Ben & Jerry's!!), yummy beer...Well rounded, starts out dominating with the smokiness and finishes the same way. No complex flavors but definitely a very good beer...just a bit flat in parts, but other than that GREAT!"
""
"O- This is a decent beer. My first oatmeal stout I had was Samuel Smith's and this beer is very much comparable to it. It has a nice rich flavor and it's low alcohol makes it very drinkable."
""
""
""
"On tap at the Cordova Casino in Rancho Cordova. It accompanied one of the shittiest meals I've had in eons, a nasty-ass chicken fettucine alfredo. I should have my head examined for having a stout with white sauce, but the mismatch isn't responsible for the Boyardee impression of the noodles. Anyway, this review is not about the noodles, it's about the beer. And what a beer it turned out to be. One of the best oatmeal stouts I've had. Roasty and subtle vanilla flavors, with a fantabulous sureally smooth consistency. Much better than FW's porter. Really makes me want to try Parabola."
""
""
""
""
"M- Super creamy, a bright and crisp middle that flows around and helps disrupt the creamy nature so it isn't syrupy or gross. The carbonation sometimes breaks things up too much. Full bodied. Finish is a good amount of sticky. Nothing bothersome. Great texture."
""
"If you happen to come across this limited edition stout I would grab a few. This is definately worth having and cannot find one reason why this should not be a big contender."
""
""
""
""
"Pours thickish black with a slow dissipating creamy head. The taste is akin to the St. Ambroise: highlighting the bitterness, bulked up mouthfeel. Though still good drinkability. Leaving a moderate dry and bitter coffee aftertaste. Malty and roast aroma.Trace of bourbon does not add but subtracts."
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very solid oatmeal stout. Low ABV and good flavor. Maybe a little less bitterness and I'd have rated higher but still very very good from FW."
""
""
""
"Cost: $2 for a 12 oz bottle."
""
""

"Nice little number here! Feels like moderate ABV stouts are becoming less & less visible, & glad to see a full-flavored, well-composed oatmeal stout. Wish we got this in my area more regularly."

"spot on oatmeal stout, a great example of the style. i could see myself drinking this again."
""
"This brew I picked up just by chance, I have enjoyed several other Firestone Walker brews so I figured this one would be pretty good too. It poured out as a very dark black color with a nice looking creamy tan head on top. The lacing was very nice on this also. The aroma was lightly roasted but nothing too strong on the nose. The taste of the beer has a really nice, it has a soft roasted flavor to it with a creamy mouthfeel. Overall I can see myself getting this again. Worth trying for sure."

""
"D - Not a bad beer overall, but doesn't have a whole lot going for it."

"Tinny, roasted barley and coffee bitterness up front. Palate fills in with semi-sweet chocolate, hearty soda bread, licorice, peat, wood, and a hint of vanilla. Finish features lingering chocolate sweetness, with minor notes of espresso and cream (think latte). Medium-full body with a nice creamy feel. Very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an excellent beer and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Highly recommended."
""
"Chewy, full body with a deeply roasted dark malt character that's nicely countered by a subtle earthy hop presence. Very similar to the aroma with lots of roasted malt flavor that never becomes overpowering or burnt tasting. Strong dark chocolate, oatmeal and coffee bean presence along with some caramel, toffee and lactic cream. Very complex and even though it's full bodied, it's very well balanced resulting in an extremely quaffable beer."
"Poured into my SA pint glass pitch black, darker than most oatmeal stouts I've encountered, with an inch or so of dense tan head. Smell is dominantly coffee with a nice fudgey chocolate background. Subtle hopping. The taste is like a mocha kind of flavor, nice french roast coffee sort of flavor with the semi-sweet dark chocolate fudge I smelled earlier. Kind of pick up on a chestnut flavor. Very smooth. Earthy roasted and nutty flavors are complimented nicely with slightly floral hops that aren't too bitter or resiny. The feel is a bit lighter than I expected at first, not very dense as the smell and flavors would suggest, but as it warmed up a bit it became thicker. Highly drinkable and very tasty beer, overall. So far, I have not been disappointed with Firestone Walker. Velvet Merlin just made its way into regular rotation with me."
""

"Another good offering from Firestone Walker. Well hidden alcohol and light enough to have more than one."
""

"This was quite a robust and easy drinking Oatmeal Stout, with a good bit of well balanced flavor that didn’t skimp on the oatmeal character one bit. I’m not sure if this one is making distribution yet on the East Coast but it’s definitely one that I’m going to keep an eye out for."
"O: I love how drinkable this is. The aroma and body didn't knock me out but the clean, crisp flavors are incredibly attractive. Nice work from one of my favorite breweries."

"DOA"

""
""
"Overall, a decent oatmeal stout, but a little on the mild and sweet side. I slightly preferred the Slow Elk by Big Sky which is very similar."
""
""
"The medium to thin body and lively, but not prickly, carbonation also put me more in mind of a porter than an oatmeal stout, although the creaminess of the body is fitting to the style. I really enjoyed this one, it’s definitely right up my alley, and would find a regular spot in my fridge along side Union Jack if it made it to stores over here."
"This is a jazzy Morgana King type of beer. Velvety and soft-spoken, yet deeply sexy. More to the traditional side. All polish and depth."
""
""
"Overall good- the mouthfeel is a little disappointing."
"Pours a deep, brown out of the bottle, sitting almost black in the glass. The head is small and tan, leaving streaks of lacing. Aroma is mainly toasted chocolate malt and oatmeal. There are hints of coffee and cocoa powder as well. Taste is more of the same and predominantly chocolate with bitter espresso, with a healthy dose of oatmeal in finish to make it very creamy. The mouth feel is light to medium bodied and feels a tad thin, though it is a low ABV stout. This is a very drinkable. I wish I wouldn't have threw in my other one as an extra in a trade."
""
""
""
"That being said, I would like to see the carbos pumped up a bit as well as an increase in head size for appearance purposes. I also think it's a bit thin giving a washed down feel. As stated previous, I would drink this beer many more times... and with glee"
"Overall: a very enjoyable oatmeal stout. kudos on the taste and mouthfeel. Not the most impressive oatmeal stout I've ever had but up there. Great job!"
"velvet merlin 5.5% one of the better oatmeal stouts out there other than the velvet merkin 8.6% which is only served at the brewery. The difference is merkin is age longer in bourbon barrels which gives it an higher ABV, silky smooth mouthfeel and great oak bourbon smell."
""
"Pours an opaque black with a mocha brown head of a couple fingers. Quite thin in terms of head retention and only a snippet of lacing. Lovely nose for an oatmeal stout, some bitter chocolate, sweet caramel and hints of a sweeter/milkier chocolate. Good roastiness and a hint of molasses. Sweet and bitter in terms of taste, roasted malts, subtle caramel and molasses notes. Modest bitterness with a bit of coffee in the finish. Heavy medium body, with a medium carbonation. Chewy feel, with great flavour. An exceptional oatmeal stout with lots of subtle complexities."

"This beer pours jet black. Has a slightly retaining head. Smells roasty and the mouthfeel is very smooth; medium bodied. Tastes roasty and even a bit chocolatey. Solid example of the style; the oats lending to the smooth mouthfeel I'm sure. Great stout from Firestone Walker."
"16oz mug at f-stop Fitzgeralds in Salem. $3.00 Black as a moonless night with a small but persistent off white head. Great toasty roasty oat aromas..comforting Taste is mainnly roasted oats,dark chocolate and esspresso coffee..the bitter ness lingers. Great mouthfeel and even better aftertaste that goes on for some time after the beer is done. Great beer at a great [price"

"Overall – fairly interesting brew to think about while tasting, and a decent taste in and of itself."
"O: All over the board here on the notes. Definitely a great brew, don't get me wrong. And I payed 5 bucks for a six pack of it, so I am NOT complaining. I'd be really interested to see how this is on tap."
""
"Overall, this is a wonderful stout. It is complex and tasty despite the fact that it is not imperialized, which seems to be a bit of a neglected concept."
"Pours jet black with a light brown head. In the aroma, a light roast and a small sweetness. In the taste, sweet cocoa and a light roast. A smooth and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry cocoa in the aftertaste. A bit thin across the board, nothing really exciting, nice but boring."
""
"O - Pretty solid oatmeal stout. While I did enjoy Velvet Merkin much better, I still think this is a really good beer to pick up a sixer of. Nothing super complex or complicated but well balanced and tasty. I don't always need to be blown away by a beer. I sometimes just need a really good beer that I can enjoy a few off. This beer fits that."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-really good glad I got the chance to try this one if I am ever somewhere they have this I will pick some up"
"Overall: this isn't bad but it isn't anything worth seeking out. If you haven't tried it and you want to give it a shot I wouldn't dissuade you but I wouldn't persuade you to try this beer over another oatmeal stout of the same quality and price. Meh."

"Very tasty beer especially if you like lots of roastiness. One of the stronger roast presence in this style I've had."

"This is a great beer. I've been wanting to try this for a while now. I'm kind of perplexed by the sweet smell and roasted body makeup. At first whiff I was certain it was going to be on the sweet side. Not so fast, mister, this one's a winner."

"Dr: Very drinkable. I quite fancy it. I'd love to try this on draught. Quite a nice flavorful brew. Give her a spin, lads."
"Pours very dark with minimal head; nice sticky lacing. Smells very strongly of coffee with some chocolate. Taste follows the nose, along with some added oaty character. Mouthfeel is medium and somewhat viscous. Overall this is excellent, better than others of the style (Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout comes to mind). Highly recommended."
"15% of the grist is oats! Sucking crawdad heads gives you the real mud bug experience; drinking Velvet Merlin is the real oatmeal stout experience. The oats are palpable in this velvet beer, and they're not polite. They are oily, thick, slightly astringent and grainy, and omnipresent here. Bring it on! This is one of those beers that make me say, hell yah, from recipe to regal pour."

"O- Well, it's official- this is now an always ISO... Hell, if anyone reads this and wants to send a 6 pack my way, please let me know and I'll provide goodies from my neck of the woods. As it warmed, it did get a touch of medicine, but overall this beer is a top notch oatmeal stout!"

"O - Outstanding. A well-balanced oatmeal stout that just comes together perfectly. You can taste the effort that went into making this. My new go-to, non-imperial stout."

"Black like a tar moat with some nice tan one finger fluffies...Sweet cocoa and brown sugar dominate the nose a nice light roasty aroma. Smooth slippery slightly sweet and very roasty, chocolate malts, and and caramel work their way to the front. Creamy light body is easy to put down, feelings of a much larger body is due to the heavy small bubble carbonation."

"Nearly black in color when you pour it into a pint glass. Not too much head or lacing. Looks very appetizing however. Smell of oatmeal chocolate, vague raisin bread perhaps, and a wee bit of molasses? Great smell. The taste is slightly underwhelming at first but as the beer warms, the complexity begins to come out more, and it's almost like the perfect combo between a cream stout and chocolate stout. And the best part of the beer is the mouthfeel. It lives up to the name, feels very velvet, goes down smooth and full, leaving you satisfied. Overall this is a beer I will absolutely come back to again each year around winter."
"O: A really well-styled oatmeal stout that I wish they distributed more widely. It is one of FW's best everyday beers."

"Pleasant drinkable average stout. Not quite the ""velvet"" one might hope for."
"The chocolate bar forward flavor profile is quite nice. Roast is present but not overpowering. A flavorful stout - well constructed."
"We all have our preferences in beers and styles. I have a definite preference for the bigger stouts. The bodies are fuller, the flavors more intense, they simple appeal to me much more than their smaller counterparts. If their were more stouts like Velvet Merlin out there, I may change my mind. Flavors are bold and balanced, the body smooth and creamy. I find it hard to admit sometimes that another state makes a better stout than what is available in Michigan, at least a Kalamazoo boy is responsible for this one. Absolutely awesome beer, fantastic. Big thanks to KevSal for the bottle."
"Poured into a huge Duvel tulip glass. I poured aggressive and got a huge 4 inch tanish head, that fell quickly, leaving a good amount of lacing. A light black color on the beer itself. Smell is dark roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, hints of toffee, and some piney hops. Taste is lots of expresso, really dominates, but it isn't a bad thing. Body is fairly thin, but that is expected for the modest abv. Kind of dry, with a good amount of life. A nice beer, I would drink this a good amount if it was available."
"Overall a great oatmeal stout that's a pleasure to look forward to around the holidays every year."
"D- At 5.5% this is quite drinkable and with the robust flavors I could drink a few without getting bored. One of the better examples of an oatmeal stout that I've had. I enjoy everything I have had from this brewery."
"Deep, ruby brown in color with a nice creamy tan head. Strong roasted aroma with a bevy of graininess. Rich roasted flavor-very coffee like with a nice touch of dark chocolate. Lingering dryness from the heavy roasted flavors. Ok mouthfeel wise-could use a kick in the pants ""stout wise"". Lacks some of the velvety creaminess of an oatmeal stout. A nice stout for the most part. Personally I was looking for more ""umph"" but still a nice example."
"overall this is a good seasonal stout worth enjoy during the winter time nothing to special but easy to drink."
"O: very drinkable and great flavors, despite lacking some smooth oat character"
"Tasty and enjoyable."
"A decent stout overall. Not the most complex example of the style, but pleasant enough."
"O: this is a great Oatmeal stout. Very representative of the style, I love the use of roasted barley and chocolate malt, the flavors really stand out."
"Pours a deep, dark, brown, almost black with a smallish brown head. Head disappears quickly with minmal lacing. Nose is roasty with some subtle coffee notes. Taste is equally roasty with some chocolate bitterness and tofee notes. Mouthfeel is a bit lighter than I prefer. Nice and ""velvety"" smooth (sorry, couldn't resist). A simple but delicious beer."
"M - As you'd expect from a cask, it's extremely smooth. A sweet, chocolate aftertaste that lingers. You can taste and feel the difference between cask and draft. Two very different beers, in a good way. Velvet Merlin is one of the better oatmeal stouts in production. Plain and simple."
"This is seriously a great beer. One of the best simple no frills stouts that I've ever had. Truely impressed."
"O- Really enjoyed this one. I'll continue to seek it out while it's in season."
"D: I really enjoyed this for a year-round stout that isn't barrel-aged.  Tasty and complex enough with a good balance and nice finish.  I wish I could get this on a regular basis. "
"O: Fairly straightforward, very well balanced, a great oatmeal stout."
"O - What a great brew! I'm glad I picked this one up! Highly recommended."
"A very nice sessionable stout, a nice go-to to have during the winter months."
"true to its name, this one if velvet and smooth, pours dark, smells boozy and roasty. mellow looking, with a one inch white head which only resides a little as it warms. taste is bold but mellow at the same time, burnt and bittersweet in the finish, october-like in the body, just right. like this one a lot better than their double jack, curious to try more beers from this crew..."
"A decent oatmeal stout. It hasn't broken any new ground though for the style."
"This oatmeal stout is decent.. but I'm more partial to Mendocino Brewing co. oatmeal stout."
"Overall: A great beer for the price. You can pick this one up on sale seasonally at Trader Joe's. About a $1.20 a beer. Drinkable. I only wish it was available year round."
""
"O - Great beer!! This has been a top want for quite some time, and it didn't disappoint. Just a great beer."
"Pours a nice dark brown with minimal khaki head. Classic stout aroma with lots of roasted malt, chocolate and some coffee aromas. Taste is very nicely balanced a touch of sweetness from the malt and just enough bitterness. The mouthfeel is a touch thin. There is a little bit of the oatmeal body but I wanted to be just a bit heavier. Overall it is a very easy drinking well balanced stout."
"The softness of this beer really stands out. It's rich and drinkable without getting you plastered. Smooth and coating with a semi-dry finish. Darn good"
"I can see why Firestone Walker's reputation is good and improving. This is a good oatmeal stout. Simple, tasty, but not something I had to change my pants over. I bought a 6 pack, but I wish I would have only had to buy four. Especially with an oatmeal stout, I was looking for a bigger mouthfeel. Its an easy drinking beer, I'm glad I tried it, but I'll probably not get it again."
"One finger light brown head, fairly quick dissipation with broken layer of head retained on top of dark brown nearly opaque body with red highlights when held up to light, no visible carbonation. Prominent Cocoa nibs, some coffee in nose, floral hops. Taste is pretty chocolaty, some dark chocolate, cocoa nibs, a bit of roast malt, caramel sweetness, hop profile hard to identify, floral with a bit of citrus? Medium mouthfeel, not a lot of effervescence, the oatmeal really dries out the finish, ultra smooth. Tasty stuff, but what else would you expect from the fertile mind of Matt Bryndelsen? Certainly one of America's best Oatmeal Stouts, really drinkable at this ABV. Recommended."
"Certainly something I'd happily drink again, and something with plenty of dry roasty character that is eminently sessionable. No bad at all."
"O-Did they change this from last year? I remembered it being a lot more bold and rich. This is alright, but I have a sneaking suspicion something is different with the current batch."
"Verdict: Nicely done oatmeal stout, very palatable and easy to drink. I will admit that its not very exciting for a limited release, but very enjoyable nonetheless."
"Overall a really nice version of this classic style."
"O: I think I'll have to stock up on this for the upcoming colder months of winter. Seems like this would be a nice choice sitting next to the fireplace, especially if you want something ""seasonal", but not overly heavy or sweet, since this is on the drier side of things."
"The feel is good, silky and smooth with subtle carbonation. Overall this is a well made beer. I just don't think this is the most exciting of styles."
"Overall: I know this is jedi mind tricks but not really a fan of this when I think about it as an oatmeal stout, but become quite a fan once I view it as an oatmeal porter. For me this drinks more like how I enjoy my porters."
"Velvet is right, the mouthfeel is very smooth. Nice creamy body with just a good bit of carbonation. This beer doesn't have big in your face interesting flavors, but the flavors it does have it absolutely nails."
"O- Very good example of the style, very pleasant to drink."
"A well-rendered California oatmeal stout, the hops eschewed in favour of a good malty, bitter coffee beast, one that I would hope has displaced Guinness from at least a few central coast watering holes..."
"Pours a dark black, but is somewhat translucent when held up to the light. A small, chocolate colored head forms and diminishes rather quickly. A good lacing is left on the sides of the glass. Smell notes of coffee, roasted malts, and small hint of chocolate. Taste roasted malts, peanuts, coffee, and small hint of caramel/chocolate mixture. Carbonation is good, but the mouthful seems a bit thin for my liking, but I think that is just the style. Overall a good Oatmeal Stout."
"Dark black with very little head in my ccb snifter. Very little head but lacing clings to the glass. Ara of coffee and sweet malts. Taste is smooth light with a coffee aftertaste. Mouth feel is surprisingly light and smooth, easy to drink and delicious"
"Very good oatmeal stout, flavoursome, complex, well balanced."
"The aroma was your typical oatmeal stout, though a touch more bitter then what I was expecting. Nice notes of lactose, chocolate and vinous hops. Some light grain notes as well in the finish. Rich, though not terribly filling. Lots of burnt and roasted malt flavors in here. Not as sweet as the aroma would have led me to believe it would have been, still though very solid in both bitterness and malt profile. Light notes of chocolate floating around, but again nothing terribly too swee"
"Nice and thicl and dark with touches of chocolate and vanilla. A perfect example of a solid, RELIABLE stout."
"Deep brown/red as it pours from the bottle, but appears black in the glass. A light khaki head rests atop, but fades quickly and leaves no lacing. Smells of oats, caramel, sugar, dark fruit, and roasted/charred malt. They blend together nicely in the nose, but are a bit more disconnected in the mouth. It tastes of sweet fruit (plum, date), sugar, oat, roasted malt, and alcohol. Mouth is thick, has medium carbonation, and finishes very dry. Overall, an enjoyable oatmeal stout, but there are some better options out there that are just as readily available."
"I really like this beer, but it was much better out of the bottle. I usually am a draft guy, but the taste specifically was better out of the bottle."
"D - My first sampling from Firestone-Walker, a great sessionable oatmeal stout, seems like this is slightly unique in that regard but it reminds me of English brown ales without the presence of dark fruits."
"O- Solid beer, strong oatmeal flavor mixed with roasted coffee notes, really easy drinkability, enjoyable."
"2.5 D: Not impressed with this one. With some crystal malt, this would be a damn good beer as the flavors present are pleasant. However, what isn't there is more important."
"Overall: This is one of if not my favorite oatmeal stout. It is almost perfect on every level. Just another fantastic beer from firestone"
"Overall: better than average oatmeal stout, but I expected alot more from this brew."
"O - Not bad, liked this one enough that I enjoyed drinking what I had and wouldn't have minded more. Good stuff for a 5.5% oatmeal stout."
"Thanks to Snosage22 for the chance to taste this one. I've been intrigued with Firestone Walker, and happy to have the chance to review one of their beers. Bottle dated 2-24-11. Poured into my dfh snifter, pours a light bodied consistency, pitch black color, nice off white head emerges, but recedes quickly and completely. Smell- chocolate, with a watery but enjoyable light scent. Definitely smell the oatmeal here. Light scent of coffee grind. its faint, but its there. taste- nice milk chocolate, met with immediate nice carbonation, and there is the coffee grind in the back. Mouthfeel- its pretty light bodied for an oatmeal stout, but it works well with the tight carbonation. Drinkability- for a 5% beer, this one packs a ton of flavor and is really enjoyable."
"Huge thanks to LuvMtdew420 for sending me this beer. Dark inky black, tan head, looks like a stout should. Smell is oats, stout, chocolate, mmmm. The taste is very rich oats and chocolate, silky almost and really impressive. I really, really wish I could buy sixers of this because it's probably the best low alcohol stout I've tasted so far. Good job FW."
"O: Been hearing great things about Firestone Walker. Had a sip of their Double Jack and was impressed. Got a few of their brews, including the Parabola. Not super impressed with this one. It's decent but there's definitely many better."
"Overall: Not bad, and I wouldn't mind having it again, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way for it. It's got a nice set of scents to it and matching flavors, but a thin and kind of boring body that doesn't really latch on to me; moderately low ABV certainly doesn't hurt it."
"Very well done beer, particularly considering the lower ABV and drinkability."
"A nice little beer. I mostly prefer Imperial Stouts if I am in this category, but from time to time, it’s nice to lighten up a stout a bit. While I don’t like the lactose qualities of Milk Stouts, I enjoy the mouth feel produced by introducing oats into the stout. This is no exception. Nice beer to relax with."
"D/O - Drinkability is high. Oatmeal stouts are one of my favorite styles if done correctly, but if not they can come off as uninspired. Firestone Walker produces a fine representation here, and the quasi-bourbon notes in here only do that much for this offering. This is a beer that I nearly finished before completing this review, as I just wanted to keep drinking it. If this ever comes to Pittsburgh, it will be a staple in my fridge."
"Overall a good beer to enjoy if youre not in the mood for anything big."
" Overall I thought this beer was excellent,maybe my favorite oatmeal stout to date.Firestone Walker just keeps moving up my list."
"O: Good malt character. Nice feel, nice finish. A little filing, ABV good for style."
"D - Interesting tingle feel on the tongue, but low carbonation."
"Overall - I edited this review because I didn't think it was great the first time. Now I think it's quite tasty. I'm beginning to appreciate low ABV stout. They pack a big flavor without being 15% and diabetically sweet."
"Overall, a really pleasant and balanced oatmeal stout. All the flavors are in good balance. A really nice oatmeal stout."
"D- It's drinkable, but not terribly memorable."
"Taste is nice, smooth & mellow but flavourful and balanced. It has fermented prunes, rasiiny bread up front with light oatmeal sourness behind, dry roastiness, hints of coffee and choclate, woody-peppery spicy light bitterness. It has a little complexity and good, solid depth of character, and is highly drinkable."
"O - Enjoyable oatmeal stout. Pretty good example of this style all around, would have no problem putting several of these down."
"Pours black with a 3 finger light tan head. The smell is a combination of fresh roasted coffee and dark malts. Some chocolate now coming through. Initial taste is all coffee and finishes with a decent amount of bitterness from the hops. Mouthfeel is good though I wish it was a bit thicker. Overall, a solid brew."
"Overall - I can't complain and can easily see myself drinking more than one in a session. Beautiful."
"Overall-A very nice oatmeal stout, perhaps one of the best. Why is this no longer Merkin?"
"Overall: A fantastic beer. Highly drinkable and enjoyable, and at a great price."
"Beer provides a good coat for the gullet. Stays away from being anything extreme. A good, dry, sessionable oatmeal stout, nothing pretentious about it, does the job quite well, even if it might seem thin at times for peeps always looking for a RIS or a double/imperial stout. Just the right amount of hopping to keep it lively, but not be astringent or out of style parameters."
"Overall: Very tasty, smooth, and balanced - an excellent example of the style!"
"Overall - a very nice interpretation of the style. I tend to prefer single stouts and porters over the big boys except on really special occasions so this was right up my alley."
"D - pretty solid oatmeal stout. I really enjoyed this the more it warmed. Very rich for what it is. Big thanks extended to BarrytheBear for sending this extra my way!"
"Pours a beautiful black with a lot of nice thick creamy head. Smells very chocolatey. A nice solid sweetness that couples with a touch of dryness. Very smooth and rich on the tongue. A wonderful light chocolatey flavor that is very solid. Overall the mouthfeel is just wonderful. A very solid brew"
"O - Overall I really liked this beer. It reminded me of lots of other great oatmeal stouts Ive had in the past. I think I would have liked a creamy texture but that's just a picky thought I just had. Very very drinkable and a wonderful flavor profile. I'd definitely buy this one again and I recommend this fine brew to any stout and porter lover. Cheers!"
"Such an easy drinking outmeal stout. I like it."
"Overall there wasn’t anything that stood out about this beer besides the mouthfeel but everything worked well together and this is a smooth beer. This beer reminded me of their Reserve Porter but with a heavier mouthfeel and slightly sweeter. Well worth a shot."
"Thanks Dan for this one. Poured a near black with minimal head. No lacing whatsoever. Picked up some coffee and chocolate on the nose. Taste was coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and a nice hop finish that wasn't too harsh. Quite quaffable; I'd do this one again."
"Overall, a nice beer for the style. One of the top ones I'd say. It's not mind blowing, but does stand out in the crowd. Drinks quite nicely as well."
"The taste"
"Pencil thin head with minimal lacing . Coca-cola like look with medium carbonation. The beer itself is stout dark with a tinge of red around the edges. The smell is of chocolate, roasted malt, sweet malt, and vanilla. The taste is heavy on the coffee and chocolate excluding the vanilla almost completly. Mouthfeel is light bodied and drinkability is high."
"D - High. Very high. Nice stout. Cant go wrong here if you can find this one."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a black which looks cola brown at the edges when held up to the light. Two finger light brown head which pretty good retention and leaves a very small amount of lacing on the glass. Aroma is roasted coffee, light earthy hops, and light dark chocolate. A bit of vanilla and licorice comes out as it warms up. I wouldn't have guessed a portion of this was barrel aged, but when you are looking for those notes you can find them. Initial taste is roasted coffee going into light dark chocolate with some hints of vanilla and licorice. The finish has a slight tea-like bitterness. Don't really get any bourbon in the taste. Medium body. Low carbonation. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Pretty standard for an oatmeal stout. Pretty great beer, especially for the cost."
"Big thanks goes out to womencantsail for picking this one up and sending it to me with my Cali haul! Served from bottle into a Warsteiner mug. Poured a deep dark brown with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cream, dark chocoalte, and subtle coffee. The flavor was of sweet malt, coffee, cream, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and dark fruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was excellent. This one went down very smoothly (almost like velvet) on the palate. My only complaint would be that none of the flavors or aroma were very robust, but that is just me being picky. Definitely worth trying and if you're lucky you might get it as an extra in a trade."
"T: Lightly roasted coffee, dark chocolate and some roasted oats. There's a hint of sweetness, but it's hidden behind a lot of coffee/dark chocolate bitterness. The mouthfeel is a little thin for me but there's a nice creaminess to this beer that lets me know I'm drinking an oatmeal stout. Pretty good example of the style."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is jet black with deep brown highlights under light. A thick, foamy, light tan colored 2 inch head. This looks tasty. Aromas of coffee and chocolate are released from this beer. Flavors are rich and creamy on a smooth and creamy body, and tastes are rich of mocha and milk chocolate. The finish is quick and a bit dry, and the aftertaste is chocolaty. Very smooth and easy to drink beer, but lighter than I am used to with Oatmeal Stouts. Tasty brew!"
"Fuller medium body, a bit higher carbonation, dry and tingly on the palate, chewy as well. Pretty solid flavor and the body is pretty full, especially with the lower ABV. If this was available here I'd definitely drink it again."
"Thanks, mrmiles, for the opportunity"
"Drinkability: I would definitely have this again and thanks to alexander for this bottle from Darkness day. I recommend this to those seeking a solid oatmeal stout with a ton of well balanced flavor."
"This was a fantastic oatmeal stout, a style I'm sort of neutral on. But I'd take it again any time."
"This brew is probably not as bad as the score I have given it. I am a Stout (oatmeal, coffee, chocolate, milk, imperial...etc.) any style lover. So for this to come from such a great brewery was kind of a let down.... But still recommended."
"Drinkability: This beer is very drinkable. The low ABV makes this beer enjoyable. Drinking a six pack of this will relax your body and mind!!!"
"D - An excellent stout, with excellent use of the oats to create a smooth finishing, yet complex beer. this coul be a good go-to stout."
" Palate is full of dark roasted malt, with notes of dark chocolate, oats, mocha, and a hint of plum. Finish is alternately roast and sweet, but smooth all the way through. Body is creamy and silky thanks to the oats, which give it a very nice texture. Rarely is a beer so full and complex also so low in alcohol, which makes this one very drinkable. A pleasure to drink."
"A black beer with a thin mocha foam. Really strong heavily roasted malt, chocolate, molasses and coffee notes come through on the nose. The taste is mostly roasted malt and chocolate. The body is light and mouthfeel is dry with mild carbonation. The oatmeal may add some creamyness to it. This is a solid beer and on tap is quite easy to drink rather quickly. Another California brew that I was lucky enough to try on a short stay there."
"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, small fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with a nice touch of chocolate/toffee. The taste is sweet, malty, with some chocolate/toffee. Medium Body. Drinkable, this is a very tasty brew. I wish it was available in Utah."
"A pretty nice example of the style, what I find distracting in the nose actually works on the palate - the lactic finish blends nicely with the light roasted malt notes. It goes down easily."
"Smuggled plums and other phallic dark fruits greet the palate with bold chocolates, black coffee, and roasted malt. A little creaminess from the oat, but acridity is the major player. Body is full and luscious for a 5.5% stout, ending well with a smooth, yet bitter roasted finish. Overall, a tasty beer with a funnier name from the good folks at Firestone. Strap one on and give it a try!"
"With 5.5% ABV you could drink a few and enjoy every bit!"
"Pours a deep, dark brown bordering on black with a 2 inch tan colored head. Lacing is spotty on the glass on the drink down. Smells of roasted malt, oatmeal, and weak coffee. Taste is of dark roasted malt and oats with a slight bitter coffee flavor. Bitterness is slight after each sip. Good carbonation with a medium body. Very easy to drink. A good dark sessionable beer clocking in at 5.5% ABV."
"D: Excellent beer that I enjoyed greatly. I wish I had more!"
"D-"
"An extremely drinkable and accessible oatmeal stout. I would use this to introduce the style to someone. Any coffee or chocolate lover who might also be interested in beer should seek this one out."
"Drink is good, sessionable but a bit to rich and thick to be really sessionable, dries nicely, no real booze, goes down smooth."
"D - A very good stout."
"D - This is in no way offensive, or excessive in any attribute other than its determination to nullify itself into a disappointingly lackluster experience."
"Overall - This is a decent beer, although I did have some issues with it. It's a bit too thin for my taste and there seems to be a lack of punch in the malt. Seems a little weak in the taste and aroma but for a standard stout I think that they did a good job."
"Overall a better than average example of the style."
"I felt this was a good drinkable brew. Pretty smooth with good integration of flavor and a sessionable ABV."
"Black color. Smells roasty and chocolatey. Super light bodied despite the oatmeal. Perfect body that lends to its super high drinkability. Tastes roasty with no oakiness. The bitterness is really smooth. This beer tastes better on tap than from a bottle."
"This is a great morning / early afternoon beer. I would be happy to call this a breakfast stout. With its clean mouthfeel, this beer could definitely pair well with waffles and syrup. Finishes dry but not overly so, I would definitely enjoy washing down my breakfast with Velvet Merlin."
"D- Very solid oatmeal stout. One of the better ones I've had. Could drink one, maybe two more. Flavors aren't overly spectacular, but still make for a very good beer. Thanks Scott for this nice winter's treat!"
"Highly drinkable. Relatively low ABV and incredibly smooth."
"Appearance is good, at first the head looked soda-ish, but now it has settled down and looks frothy and creamy. Body is pitch black. The smell is very interesting, all it says is that it is an oatmeal stout, but it smells more like an espresso stout, all I'm really getting on the smell is coffee and a big roasty malty smell. It smells good, just different. Taste is excellent though, man, this is freaking smooth. The taste is super smooth, super easy to drink, but at the same time it is very complex. You for sure get the coffee and the roasted malt taste, but the coffee isn't quite as present as I thought it would be. Along with those two flavors you also get some chocolate and a tiny tiny tiny bitterness at the end. Super good beer here."
"D: With a 5.5% abv this brew is big on flavor and highly drinkable. I'd drink this often if it was available to me."
"Drinkability is great. This is a very quaffable stout. I could easily put back a few pints of this. If this were on tap at my local bar, it would become a regular for me. A great go to stout. Nice work Firestone Walker."
"Overall I quite like it. Maybe not my favorite oatmeal stout, but it is certainly an upstanding offering of the style."
"Pouring a very dark brown, this beer has the deepest red highlights. A dense, dark brown head is present, receding to a disk leaving no lace. The nose is rather excellent. The oatmeal character is so fresh and so prominent, it smells like I've drizzled some granola with coffee. Rich, beautiful, oatmeal cereal with a little bit of raisin. The coffee isn't the richest or the best, but it works wonderfully well here, despite being rather instant coffee-like. Likewise, the palate opens with a blend of oatmeal, coffee and a little bit of fruit, a little raisin-like? There's also an underlying caramel sweetness that's light, working very well with the oatmeal. A balancing bitterness is provided by a little bit of coffee and a little bit of roast, and I also get a touch of Fuggles in the back, earthy and a little leafy. Drying and roasty on the finish with oatmeal and coffee, this beer is excellent. Medium-light in body with soft carbonation, this has a perfect level of carbonation. As for drinkability, well, I am trying to work on a presentation here, but I just cracked my second bottle of this. Suffice to say, this is one of the better oatmeal stouts I've had in a long time. This is breakfast in a glass with a dollop of happiness."
"Very easy drinking, with a slightly thin, medium body. Flavor is roasted, sweet with chocolate and coffee. Extremely well balanced and smooth. A little sweet for the style, but will definitely seek this out again."
"D: Goes down smooth, great to drink! Especially after drinking a few 10% ABV beers. Then you can drink it right out of the bottle & it still tastes good."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. The oats in this brew imparts a silky smooth feel in the mouth which is exceptional for the style. The alcohol is perfectly hidden and overall this is a fine example of the style."
"D: A really easy drinking oatmeal stout full of mild, well balance flavors. Not my favorite beer, but it does the trick."
"D - Having no problems drinking this one, the amazing mouthfeel helps a lot."
"I am glad this was not a bomber, but it is a good oatmeal stout."
"Final thought - Nice, toasty. This is a great stout, not the best, but great"
"d- Overall I think that this is a really interesting beer and being that it is my first from firestone walker I think I need to try more beer from them."
"Drinkability: I really enjoyed this beer and would definitely drink again. Firestone Walker continues to amaze me."
"I highly recommend this beer. I hope that Firestone starts to make this delicious drink year-round."
"Overall - Solid beer. Will I buy it again? Possibly. There are certainly bigger beers that offer a lot more, but this is an excellent oatmeal stout to have 2-3 of while watching you're favorite football team lose."
"O: The coffee element of the beer is great, and overall it is well done. Glad I got to try this."
"Overall, too roasted for me. Otherwise, it is pretty good. I got no bourbon or oak out of this beer."
"Very solid mouthfeel feeds into the great finish of the malty coffee. Drinkability is excellent. Very good oatmeal stout."
"Firestone Walker is a good-to-great craft brewery. Velvet Merlin Oatmeal Stout is closer to good than great, which is fine with me. Here's hoping this is a year-round release."
"So glad this was bottled, hands down the best beer Firestone has released in six packs."
"Velvet Merlin has a great name and is a solid if unspectacular beer. I have to say that the mouthfeel might actually live up to the name."
"Bottle. Picked up a six pack the other day while in San Diego to give it a try. Poured into a pint glass a dark brown color with a light tan head. Nice aroma in the nose of roasted coffee, slight chocolate, some vanilla, and a tad bit of leather. Nice and smooth medium mouthfeel. The creaminess of this is really its shining star, it just drinks so smooth for me. The flavors are a nice balance as well between sweet and roast bitterness. Starts with a nice sweetness of chocolate and vanilla that is nicely rounded out with some roast bitter flavors along with some subtle muted hops."
"overall a solid beer. perfect on those cold southern california days"
"A trade extra from Loki83. Heard good things about this beer, and it holds up well to its reputation. Color is a medium shade of brown with light gold edges, mead is fine and plenty at first, but doesnt hang around. Aromas are malty and firm, flavors match well, simple but well balanced. Pecan nut flavors linger with a grainy malt taste. Solid Oatmeal stout."
"Finally found this at a local Bevmo and excited I did. Poured into a snifter and I am met with a black ale and a beige foamy head that dissolves to a thin layer. The aroma is of roasted malts, semi-sweet chocolate, tobacco and leather. The taste gives a good dose of chocolate followed by a slight coffee character coming through and then a solid chocolate/cocoa finish. A little spicy on the swallow. Mouthfeel is pretty full though there a little too much carbonation for my liking. Wish it was a tad creamier. Drinkability is still high. At only 5.5% this is very drinkable. Finding it is another story."
"Great drinkability, good example of the style."
"Good beer that is notably for a smoothness even for an oatmeal stout & that strong, rabid nose."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is medium and very smooth. Carbonation levels are low but perfect for this beer. In all honesty I could drink this beer all night long. A straight forward beer that will not bore you during a long night."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a standard pint glass. Pours a really nice deep dark brownish black color with an off white 1 finger head that leaves behind a ring of foam as the drinking session progresses. there is a very distinct raisin aroma coming through on this that reminds me of having oatmeal with syrup and raisins on top. really nice roasted malty aromas coming through as well. the flavor is nice and balanced. really has a good upfront sweetness that lends itself to a balanced, and even slightly dry finish. some astringent dryness on the backend, but the transition from front to mid to back palate is flawless and really gives a nice experience. the mouthfeel is nice as well. nothing crazy and i would have liked it a bit less carbonated. near perfect body on this, not overly thin even for the low abv. Drinkability is right up there with the best. has a nice low abv, sorta, and really easy to go down. perfect for this time of the year and I would love to get my hands on some more. Worth seeking out."
"D: Very very drinkable. I could definitely session these all night."
"Drink- For a 5.5 ABV this is a fine beer. It's as smooth as they come without a burn. Could have a ton of these on a cold night."
"Drinks really smooth and easy, lives up to its ""velvet"" name. Nice carbonation as well. Really approachable and drinkable as well."
"This beer is very drinkable. There is none of the residual bitterness or dryness from the hops/dark cocoa flavors that sometimes appear in stouts that makes a beer less drinkable to me. I could put down several of these without getting sick of it."
"I typically like stronger stouts but must admit I really like this ale, its extremely smooth and but the flavor and aroma are dominated by roasted coffee and light caramel notes. It would be nice if it were a little stronger and provided a more warmth on the back end."
"D: Overall this is a pleasant beer and I have absolutely no complaints for the price tag. This is a solid stout that's simplicity and body make it very easy to drink. That said, I think this brew was a little overly roasted for me which made it seem a bit imbalanced. It also had almost no detectable oatmeal flavors, was a bit astringent due to the coffee and was not as creamy as I expected. There are much better oatmeal stouts out there, but this one definitely was on the above average side. I wouldn't hesitate to drink it again, but I probably wouldn't seek it out."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable."
"D: A fine oatmeal stout, neither challenging nor boring. Despite the one-note smell of coffee, the flavor manages to surprise and impress by being more multi-layered. A nod to Firestone-Walker for packaging this beer in 6-packs; there are few California stouts from anywhere south of the Bay Area being marketed in that format."
"Bottle courtesy of Kevin - Thanks! poured into a NB globe, black liquid with a tan head that quickly fades to a bubbly cap. Smells of dark roasted malts, some coffee, and spicy hops. Taste is very malty and a bit smokey from the roast. Hop flavor to start that fades into a nice balance of hops and roast finish. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not as silky as most oatmeal stouts but a good beer regardless."
"I am finding lots of complexity to enjoy here, without the mammoth abv often associated with Stouts that are considered the best. Smooth and warming nonetheless."
"Overall, I am impressed by the Velvet Merkin. My hats off to Firestone for a delicious seasonal treat. Good work."
"A wonderful holiday beer. Robust, and full bodied. I love the roast coffee taste. I think I would enjoy this with smoked cheese."
"Overall, this is a solid offering from Firestone. If anyone is on the lookout for a well-crafted oatmeal stout, give this a try - you will not be disappointed. ~"
"The smell of roasted malts and an aroma of chocolate coffee filled the nose with a pleasant soft aroma. The taste of this Oatmeal Stout was just what the smell and aroma was, but, without the usual bitterness of a stout. Nice balance of malts and all components involved. Soft, with a nice bitter/sweet finish on the palate."
"So smooth it goes down way too easy but if you hold on for a moment you're rewarded with a good amount of flavor. I don't know, is a Velvet Merlin like a Velvet Elvis?"
"Kind of a bummer. Granted I haven't had an inordinate amount of Firestone, but this is not up to the standard I expected from a great brewery. Plenty of other oatmeal stouts in the sea."
"By Merlin Olsens beard, get this."
"They shoulda kept it Merkin. Why not? Regardless, it pours a straight onyx topped by a finger of rather light ecru foam. The nose comprises smooth chocolate, roasted malts, molasses, and toasted oats. The taste focuses on the roasty and toasty notes, much to the benefit of all involved. (Side note: The racism involved in certain episodes of Peabody and Sherman is priceless. Here is all the proof you'll need that the children of that era grew up dumb as brix.) The body is a strong medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth and nearly chewy feel. Overall, a quaff good enough to present to White's version of the titular soothsayer. Zounds!"
"This beer pours a nice darkness with a beige head. The smell has some dark chocolate and roast coffee notes. The taste has the dark chocolate note to it mostly, but has some light fruity aftertaste. It's a pretty pleasant beer to drink, but I think velvet is a strong term for the mouthfeel. It's not bad, but it's not overall impressive. I don't think that I would ever have a problem having this if it were given to me."
"Overall drinkability is very good. This is one of the best in class i have had this year. I hope to see more of it in the future!"
"Velvet Merlin has a really satisfying, comforting kind of personality. It's a case of every ingredient working in harmony, everything balanced out perfectly."
"Quite drinkable. I'm looking forward to finishing this 6 pack."
"Ridiculously smooth, might i say velvety. This oat stout is extremly drinkable and at 5.5% abv i could easily drink a six pack."
"Drinkability was decent, not great, not bad. I would have another one."
"I give a solid Schlitz for this stout. I'd revisit Velvet Merlin."
"d - A good oatmeal stout full of chocolate and roasted malts mostly. A little bit bitter but I liked it a lot. Would certainly have again."
"D: It's a nice beer, very drinkable, but not my all time favorite. I would drink it again though, but wouldn't seek it out."
"Very smooth and creamy. Medium body. This actually has some characteristics that remind me of a porter. The low ABV makes this very drinkable. Overall, a solid oatmeal stout."
"Above average oatmeal, worth a shot."
"D - a well-balanced, super easy to drink stout that'll having you reaching for a second in no time. speaking of which..."
"Drink- Pretty easy drinking for a stout but more carbonation really would have helped this."
"Drinkability: Split three or four ways and didn't regret it; I guess it has the elements of a bigger beer so I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't; the qualities it showed do not translate well to a lighter style"
"D- Very drinkable, I wish I nabbed a six pack instead of a single."
"O: An outstanding beer that I would buy in bulk to have until springtime. I wouldn't change a thing."
"D: it drank good but to me the oatmeal qualities didn't really shine or pop out; Really tasty beer though."
"D - Very easy drinker. The excellent balance and temperate taste makes this one easy to have a few of. Very good beer."
"D- Highly drinkable. Its not my favorite in the style but it has a very easy, mellow flavor which makes it extremely quaff-able. I think FW did a great job blending the flavors in a way that didnt have any one ingredient slam you in the mouth. I will buy this beer again."
"D - This is the perfect beer right now with the cold weather it tastes very good and is easy drinking worth grabbing a pint if you see it around"
"Pours a burgundy-black with hints of purple in the light. Relatively thin head, dies down quickly to an average bubbly layer; lacing is sparse. Aroma is fairly smooth and mellow, not astringent: rich molasses, bouillon, chocolate, raisins, maybe a hint of grassy scents. Mouthfeel is slightly silky, but a little on the watery side; not much in the way of carbonation or body. Flavor is at first smooth cocoa with vague hints of coffee, then mild burnt oat bitterness, a slight wash of hops, and warming alcoholic presence; finally a lingering grassy sourness. Aftertaste is flat and lightly bitter."
"Drinkability - Quite high. It is a lower alcohol content, and drinking this next to Old Rasputin, this is definitely easier to drink. Now honestly, I don't think I'd pick this up in a six pack just because there are so many other stouts I'd rather drink (read OR). Still, glad I was able to try this."
"glad to have this available in the bottle, one of the nicer oatmeal stouts."
"drinkability - smooth and easy with a slight bite, unique notes for an oatmeal stout, very good and enjoyable"
"O: I enjoyed it overall. However, it doesn't quite reach the level of sweetness and creaminess that I would expect from an oatmeal stout (my benchmark is Samuel Smith). That being said, disregarding style, it's a very pleasant session beer more focused on toasted bitterness than malty sweetness."
"All in all, I have to say I'm impressed. I'm not a big fan of FW brews in general, but this one certainly makes me reconsider my opinion. Definitely highly drinkable, a great session brew with plenty of flavor and a touch of heat. Definitely worth trying. I'm right on the edge of 4/4.5 with taste, and mouth, but something's just not quite perfect. that being said, this is probably going to end up being one of my primary six-pack purchases this season."
"Pours dark, black you could say. No head. Amazing crushed coffee bean/toffee aroma. It reminds of almost of a chocolate covered coffee bean, which is probably one of my favorite aromas. Extremely smooth texture. There's a touch of carbonation and a very smooth finish. The sweetness from the sugars seems to result in a smooth texture, one of the reasons I love this beer. Very nice caramel malt notes. There are notes of roasted malts, but they are very subtle. The roasted malts kind seem to be in a battle with the carbonation. Every sip I take I can taste it, but the bubbles cut through at times, you get just enough to know it's there. The carbonation makes this beer feel thinner than it really is. The funny thing is, there's not that much. This is a very gentle beer; however, I would have liked some more of the aromatics to come through in the taste, it's too much of a tease. This schools Anderson Valley's Oatmeal Stout anyway."
"/Me opens a second one"
"Drinkability is the apex of this beer. Great tasting with great complexity, and not to mention the big flavors for being a 5.5 ABV beer. That is just incredible."
"This is a very drinkable if not very complex stout."
"good beer - basic, but good..."
"The beer pours total black, with a creamy three and a half finger tan crown. The head sticks around for a while, but doesn't leave much lacing behind. Nose is straightforward, but good. Heavy on cocoa, with a solid dose of vanilla present as well. The flavor kicks things up a bit. Chocolate still dominates, along with vanilla as the main supporting player, but now a bit of heavily roasted astringency creeps in. It's a nice substitute for a hop bite, and makes way for a slight oaky finish. Mouthfeel is great, but what I've come to expect from an oatmeal stout. Body is impressively rich, especially for a 5.5% beer, and ultra smooth thanks to the oats. Carbonation is picture perfect understated, it gets the job done but doesn't get in the way of all the malty flavors. Velvet Merlin is the second beer I've ever had from Firestone Walker, and it's almost as impressive as their Union Jack IPA. A very nice winter seasonal."
"Finish is a little weak with a bitter tannic dryness taking over. Glad to be able to pick up a six-pack of this, but it's not my favorite style and doesn't really improve on Mr. Smith's variety. Not bad though."
"I wouldn't seek it out but if it is on tap or around the same price I got it for (7.99) I'd give it a try. Its a good beer but I'd expect a little more from FW."
"Somewhat surprised by the high reviews on this - I guess Firestone Walker's reputation supercedes sometimes, or perhaps I had a bottle from an off batch. Found this to be a pretty straightforward, adequate outmeal stout, but fairly disappointing as I generally enjoy FW's offerings. Both in taste and mouthfeel this came out watery for my taste, with little complexity or creaminess. A miss for FW."
"Very bitter roasted malts on the tongue but doesn't linger. I get a little bit of that acidic dark malt taste. Something I sometimes find in a schwarzbier. Easy to drink. Clean light bitter finish. Seems a little thin for an oatmeal stout though."
"Overall a very smooth and drinkable stout with nice chocolate and malt flavors, I would drink this again."
"D: the brew goes down easily enough, but there's just none of the complexity or fullness I get from the bottle. Cask isn't a format that does Velvet Merkin any favors."
"O - Doesn't quite live up to the hype, but a good beer nonetheless. Worth getting a 6-pack and having once in a while."
"D- High drinkability. The flavor is a bit mellow, but that works to its advantage with the smooth body. I really enjoyed the coffee flavors sweetened slightly by the milk chocolate. Very easy to drink a couple of these at a time."
"D: Good but not phenomenal. Will have again in six pack."
"Excellent aroma, full-flavored and very smooth. None of the individual flavors bowled me over, but this is one balanced, easy-drinking stout!"
"Poured hard into pint glass, 1 and 1/2 inch head light brown in color. Beer is dark in color not quite black. Smells of chocolate and malt. Tastes a bit the same with a little coffee lingering, towards the end a little bitterness which was unexpected yet overall a little sweet. Little bit of carbonation in there at the end for a surpise. Could be a sessionable beer easily. Not at all what I expected, not generally a oatmeal guy, but enjoy myself Firestone as a daily drink so I figured I would try. Not at all disappointed but not enough to make me want to search out every oatmeal on the planet. All in all nice work as per usual FS. Cheers"
"Smell was of bitter chocolate and hints of licorice. It was a semi dry with a nice oatmeal stout bitterness. It had milk chocolate light grain on the dark side and a smooth finish. It was a very solid effort and would buy more of this if it was available up here."
"D: Really, really good stuff. Oatmeal stouts aren't a hyped category, but if you're looking for the best of the style, this should be in the conversation."
"A really session-able and awesome beer for the alcohol content. It tastes like a much bigger beer than it really is. Not in terms of tasting alcoholic, but in terms of being full of flavor."
"Bottom like this oatmeal stout is right on the money, dark to the eyes, roasted coffee, chocolate, smooth creamy mouthfeel, and the drinkability of the best of em."
"Beer tastes like coffee and oatmeal. It has a medium to full body and the sweetness of the stout coats my mouth. Drinkability suffers slightly for me due to the overall weight of the beer but its really good. I would definitely have this again."
"Overall: one of the best stouts I have ever had a great beer man!"
"Pours a very dark brown to almost black color. Nose is rich with roasted malts and wet robusta coffee grounds. On the palate the roasty flavors take center stage, with a bit of sweetness that is present as well. Some gentle woody components are noted, but subtle. The roasty character carries nicely into the finish. Medium bodied and very, very drinkable. Nice session stout."
"Not a bad beer at all. A little disappointing though, Firestone normally hits home runs; this is more of a Double."
"Taste is a bit mellow, very well balanced though. It's creamy and rich and that oatmeal character is coming through quite well. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth. Quite an easy drinker."
"This was a good price and I'll buy this again. But, there are better stouts out there at this price."
"This lived up to my expectations. Definitely worth seeking out. It's hard to go wrong with anything from Firestone. Looking forward to hopefully having this on tap next week at the brewery. Good stuff. Buy it."
"Verdict: Apart from a minor flaw or two, very good and worth tracking down if you can."
"HV"
"Pours a solid black color with a patchy, dark tan head. Minimal but deep malt aroma. Smooth and full-bodied (but without being viscous) with light carbonation. Good malt flavor with some coffee - not too much ""roasted"" flavor, but that lets the cream and oat flavors through. A pretty nice and tasty oatmeal stout, with a fairly low ABV."
"-i was surprised when i first saw that this beer was a B+, but after trying it i can understand. a bit off on style, and i have definitely had better O-stouts. but nonetheless, i can drink it for sure without being mad"
"Overall it's a pleasant oatmeal stout, great for these rainy California winters."
"Overall, a very good beer that borders on excellent. Worth seeking out."
"D- This is great, I love the low alcohol percent and the great flavors. I will be buying this 6 pack a lot this winter."
"D - Good. Clean, dry, full flavored and quite easy drinking."
"D - Pretty drinkable. This is a good beer and nails the style perfectly. That being said I prefer most other styles of stout over this one. I'm really glad I got to try this one though. I wouldn't mind drinking this again but I'm not gonna seek it out."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Pours a VERY dark brown with a thick creamy off-white/tan head. Scent is very roasty with hints of coffee and oats. Very pleasant scent. Taste is just as it smells. This beer has so much flavor for a regular oatmeal stout. I've had imperial oatmeal stouts that didn't taste this good. The coffee, roasted oats, and light hoppiness blend together so well. Very balanced. Mouthfeel is creamy and ""velvety."" Again, was expecting this to be a bit on the watery side due to not being imperial and having this somewhat low ABV, but I was wrong. Even some reviewers before me said this was a bit on the watery side, but I beg to differ. Drinkability is HIGH! I'm very glad they bottled this delicious oatmeal stout!"
"Feel aside, this looks, smells and tastes great. I wouldn't let the dry aspect keep me from seeking this out again."
"There is a very light elegant roasted character to this - nothing special whatsoever in my opinion. No need for me to try again."
"D: This would be incredibly easy to drink all night."
"This is a very drinkable beer, and I definitely plan on picking up some more of this while I can."
"All too easily, Velvet Merlin disappears faster than free corn bread at a hoe down! Highly recommended regardless, of the name, get some now!"
"TASTE: Instantly complex and delicious. A little sharp and bitter upfront which carried through at near full force all the way to the end."
"M/D: Body is a little light on the palate but there's nice carbonation. Smooth as velvet but still a tad thin. Flavors are toned down...I wished so badly to just taste ""more"". But this beer was still enjoyable!"
"Drinkability is this beers strong suit. A tasty oatmeal stout that goes down easy and is not to heavy."
"The name suggests how smooth it is. I guess you can't ask for more carbonation when Velvet's the trademark."
"Overall, my initial impression is the aromas and mouthfeel are the saving grace of this beer; however, I have had it at other locations since Haven's and the flavors are better than what I initially experienced. It's a very good oatmeal stout - exhibiting an excellent balance - but still needs a little more to make it a classic. As of now, it's a good session brew, for me."
"Poured a deep brown almost black and it had a small white head. Nose had some hints of toffee, oatmeal and cocoa. Went down smooth and the ABV was around 5. Taste was smooth with not as much taste up front but through the middle and mouthfeel is where this beer is strongest i thought. Lots of smoothness, oats, cocoa, maybe a light coffee feel and creamy, roasted malts. Very smooth and highly drinkable. Best Oatmeal Stout I have had next to BORIS."
"Good drinkability, and a great beer overall."
"Good beer."
"I'm not a hater of even-handed beers, but I thought this was very run of the mill for stouts, and I tend to expect a little better from F.W. The brewers can take that as a compliment to their other beers."
"taste is of dark chocolate, bakers chocolate, some coffee, and malt in the back, ends dry and somewhat bitter."
"Taste carries forward the roasted malts, a bit of chocolate and a nice oat flavor and body. Smooth feel with a nice texture. Easy drinking for the ABV which is mostly disguised in the structure of the beer. Carbonation is somewhat light yet quite appropriate for the beverage. Worth a try."
"This is always a great brew from FW. Nothing out of the ordinary, just a well crafted oatmeal stout."
"D- an easy drinker, I would get this beet again yo introduce people to the style, but it's really nothing too complex."
"Very filling and enjoyable, however would have benefited more from a lower alcohol concentration."
"D: Certainly a very drinkable beer with very little alcohol presence. I was really excited to get to try this, but a bit let down by it."
"Quite mild...with less alcohol this could be a ""session"" beer."
"On-tap at Beachwood BBQ a few weeks ago at the Firestone 13 party. Review from notes. Poured into a goblet, very dark brown with red highlights. About one centimeter of tan head, high retention, fair lacing. Aroma is bready with oats, toasty, biscuity, fruity, and pops with some chocolate malts to it. Tastes of estery chocolate malts, robust levels of oats, biscuit and dough. Finish is roasty, bready, and cookielike. Feels thick and silky. Good oatmeal stout, better than average, but do not expect anything more than a regular oatmeal stout."
"D-""Velvet"" smooth, with no residual alcoholic burn, long lasting finish."
"Pours with slight head fading rapidly to little or no lacing. Displays a great dark nose with lots of malts and roasted notes. Zesty yet rich on the palate, more dark flavors backing up the nose. In the mouth it is very effervescent and light, lacks stuffing. The finish is lingering, tart and slightly bitter but well integrated. For a stout, it is rather light but with good flavor and aromas."
"Nice sipper - one is enough - the bitter burnt flavor is intense."
"D - Great overall, would love to have again and again."
"Have had this at multiple locations, most recently at the Firestone Night of the Ales, across from the Toronado. It pours a midnight black with no head - some lacing around the edges. The initial smell is of coffee and roasted malt; some chocolate undertones reveal themselves after further sniffing. Overall it is decent oatmeal stout but nothing too remarkable - and considering some of the other FW beers this one falls into the category of 'session beers' but not 'savory beers', like the anniversary and other limited releases in my opinion."
"On tap at Toronado in San Diego. Poured a blackish with no head at all. I could not even generate more than a little tiny bit of tan fizz after major swirling. There was absolutely no aroma on this beer at first smell. I even had friends check to make sure my nose wasn't messed up and they didn't get any smell either. After drinking about half the glass I could get a slight bit of roastiness out of it. The taste was much better though, real mellow overall. A tiny bit of chocolate but mostly a roasted barley type of coffee flavor. Had a pretty good silky mouthfeel. Despite the lame appearance and smell it was still a pretty good beer, and fairly sessionable I would say."
"Ummm....it's black in appearance, the beer leaves some amount of lacing on the glass. What we have here is a very sweet stout. Semi-sweet chocolate all around, rolled oats...what else? A little thinner than I was expecting, but overall, this is a good oatmeal stout."
"Drinkability is pretty good, it goes down very easily due to rounded flavors and smoothness. On the other hand, it's rather boring and lacking depth, and I didn't feel like having another."
"D: Nice oatmeal stout from Firestone, it shows that they don't have to create a big beer when they barrel age stuff. Nice brew all around."
"Evaporative flavor on the slightly dry finish. Not especially complex despite what is written, but very enjoyable to drink."
"Certainly a tasty brew and fans of Firestone Walker will of course love to seek this out... and the should."
"Tap @ O'Brien's. Pours dark brown with a medium tan head. Nestle Quik cocoa, malted milk balls, leather, vanilla, and roasted coffee in the nose. More malted chocolate and oatmeal in the taste, with a strong cherry pop towards the finish. The cherry sweetness came out of nowhere, was out of character for the beer, but kind of nice. Almost like a German chocolate cake taste. Good beer."
"I was excited to try this after having Saucerful of Merkin and wanting to know what those two components tasted like by themselves, this beer is right around six percent alcohol supposedly but it feels even lighter than that at times, would like to drink again, recommended"
"D - This an excellent dessert beer."
