"o: This is up there with my favorite stouts."
""
"Pours rich and thick like a stout should. Very dark appearance with less than expected head. Rich, smooth taste with just the right carbonation. An extremely delicious stout!"
"The flavor is a bit subdued but smooth and delicious. There's a ribbon of sweetness that tastes like marshmallow cream, caramel and toffee. The stout like characteristics then shine through with roast, char, chocolate malt and Graham cracker. All the while I tastes tinges of molasses and dark fruit. Supposedly this was just $5 for a bomber, it was given to me. If that's the case this may be the best deal in craft beer."
""
""
"Nice mouthfeel, coffee and chocolate notes...very good"
""
""
"Toasted marshmallow on the nose, coffee and cocoa on the palate, this beer delivers.  Pours thick, rick, and midnight black.  The alcohol is balanced nicely with the full flavor and sweet malts, with just a twinge if bitterness reminding you to keep drinking.  Smooth and wet, this one makes a great case for the oatmeal stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tasted like a Black IPA."
""
""
""
"O: disappointing, especially given the high ratings on BA.  The discrepancy along with an overly aggressive, frothy head and off-notes make me suspect I got a bad bottle."
""
""
"Solid stout but did not standout among other oatmeal stouts i have had"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Phenomenal Oatmeal Stout. Smell and taste of chocolate and coffee with a very subtle Oatmeal background. The mouthfeel is a little thin but is also very hearty. Great local beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a solid stout. Nice creamy mouth feel.. Don't sit on this on for long it's kinda on the low side in the ABV department."
""
"O: A truly phenomenal brew. For the style, maybe it loses some fraction of a point for having more chocolate flavor than oatmeal, but either way, this is a great beer. Absolutely incredible."

"o: A very good stout, though less sweet than an oatmeal might be. Gives the impression of being a modern American oatmeal stout due to the relative bitterness. A bit surprising from Ipswich/Mercury, which I think of as leaning towards British styles."
""
""
"Pours opaque with a one finger head and a light lacing. This beer smells great. It has a coffee aroma with subtle oatmeal notes. Smooth is an understatement. This beer goes down like a glass of milk. Outstanding flavor. Complex but not overbearing. Its flavor resembles that of a chocolate shake. This is possibly the best oatmeal stout I've ever had. Try this beer."
""
""
"Love the look of this beer. A gorgeous soft, bubbly, light (but not too light) brown sits atop the black brew. Some lacing clings to the glass. The nose brings milk chocolate, roasted coffee, nuts, oats, and a hint of vanilla. The taste doesn't bring as much of the smell to the table. You get hints of cocoa and coffee and roasted malts. Each sip goes down smooth with a silky mouthfeel. Sticky on the lips too. Overall, a good example of the style and can see why it is considered a classic in the area."

"O: A classic for a reason – what a satisfying, drinkable beer. The call-and-response between the creamy sugars and the bitter hops and roasts makes this interesting enough to stay satisfying throughout, and that doesn’t seem too typical in a low-alcohol beer. I thought that there would be some noticeably dull flavors in here due to the age of this bottle…turns out, that’s not at all true. Great beer."

"Overall - I really enjoy this beer. For a non-imperial stout, one of my favorites. @ $10 for a six pack in MA it's a great value. Will become part of the normal rotation."

"O - Not a bad beer at all just that the oatiness was not as prevalent as I would have liked. Would definitely have again."
""
""
"Overall 4.0: Excellent oatmeal stout. Big flavors, relatively big ABV (7+%) and big hype, but this baby lives up to all of it. Pleasant and warming, this would be an ideal beer for a night in front of the fireplace in the Winter. I am drinking this in July, but am married, so I have an active imagination. Regardless, if you are a fan of stouts, you should try out this beer. It is light, smooth and well-balanced. Not an Imperial Stout by any means, it is basic and well worth your hard-earned sheckles."
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Dark hue, fair head, but no real lacing. Char roasted grains, chocolate, and oatmeal make up the nose. Tastes like it smells.... charred malt grains, bittersweet chocolate, and oatmeal. Simple, but well done. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
"It's up there among the best stouts I've had. Wouldn't mind seeing it in six packs instead of the 22 oz bottle."

"Ah yes, it was a rather cold and bitter, rainy day today so I thought I’d indulge in some blood warming beer and Ipswich Oatmeal Stout was the right place to start. Upon moving your nose toward the glass an aroma of roasted coffee and chocolate surround it strongly and you don’t need to smell it twice to know what this beer consists of (though it’s really damn pleasant so you might want to!) The taste brings on a bitterness that’s reminiscent of dark chocolate and coffee beans but the addition of oats gives this beer a balanced sweetness and a consistent velvety texture which makes it very easy to drink. This is a great beer to have alone or maybe with some dessert after dinner."

"Overall- Really well put-together oatmeal stout that has the flavour that I really enjoy in any sort of beer.. especially considering it's a year-round and reasonably priced. It's too bad I don't live in the New England distribution zone but I'm glad to have tried this beer. I'll keep it in mind the next time I go out and visit in Boston. (4)"

"Pours from the 22 oz. bomber a cola-like black with a thick, foamy, fluffy 3 finger beige head that slowly settles to a very thick collar. Aroma brings notes of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, smoke, with a touch of hop spicey-ness! 1st sip brings a medium bitterness of unsweetened chocolate & coffee. The body is on the lighter side, with a somewhat thin texture and a bitter finish. Overall, a very good Oatmeal Stout...i'll be picking this one up again soon!"
""
""
""
"Poured into SA sensory glass. Pours pitch black with dark brown head that dissipates quickly. Not much in the way of lacing or head retention. Smell is intensely roasty with notes of oatmeal, light caramel, coffee, and toast. Taste is full of specialty grains up front with a heavy dry roast quality followed up by a somewhat creamy oatmeal character. Notes of chocolate and coffee come through with a somewhat dry finish. There is a mild bitterness which seems to be more from the roasted grain than hops. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with somewhat high carbonation. Overall, this is a nice full flavored oatmeal stout with a huge emphasis on the roast. This is a nice features of specialty grains, worth checking out!"

"Poured into a dimpled mug. Pours black with a two-finger length tan head. Some lacing is left on the glass as the head dissipates. There are aromas of dark roasted malts, chocolate and coffee. The taste follows the nose. It's very roasty with chocolate and coffee notes. I get some of that oatmeal flavor as well. There is some roastiness in the aftertaste. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The drinkability is fairly high and the oatmeal helps smooth the beer. This is an excellent beer."
""

"overall: A big beer hiding in a 7% Oatmeal. Rich, complex but mellow and drinkable."

"Best oatmeal stout I've ever had."
""
"O: I like this beer. It goes down smooth and after a sip; it leaves you wanting another. The taste is so complex and maybe it is the IBU's (which I don't know) that make it hard too gulp it or drink it any other way than a sip and a sip and another sip. Delicious and I would recommend it."
""
""
"O: Better than the best oatmeal if you ask me, and I am an oatmeal lover. I wonder if this was brewed with apple cinnamon, because it is most definitely a real oatmeal in this tasty pick"
"Overall: Probably my new standard for oatmeal stouts. I really enjoyed this beer and will look for more bottles. This one fires on all cylinders."
"O - This is the bottle I would hand to a neophyte beer-appreciating friend to introduce them to quality American-born stouts."
""
"Overall, a well rounded rich an balanced stout. Recommendable."
""
""
""
""
"O: This has the makings of a Imperial Stout in flavor and body. Its rich. The flavor profile is pretty in your face, a great beer for a cold night. Gets smoother as it warms up, flavors meld much better. An absolute steal at the price. Ipswich rules."
"Overall - Being a really common beer from the area, that doesn't have any sort of cult following, I was surprised at how easy drinking, yet perfectly balanced, yet somewhat unique this beer is."
""
"Mimicking the aroma exactly, with slightly more coffee roast, Ipswich delivers on flavor! I just want to eat this beer! Almost chewy in texture with light carbonation and a beautiful balance of bitterness and sweetness, this oatmeal stout becomes a wonderful sipping beer sure to go well with cheesecake a la mode."
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent, flavorful oatmeal stout. Ipswich hit the nail on the head with this one. At 10 bucks a sixer, it might be one of the most affordable top notch stouts money can buy."
""
""
""
"O: This along with Breckenridge is widely available at my local liquor store down the street. I love Breckenridge much better than this, but that doesnt discredit the beer at all. It is an excellent Oatmeal stout and very much appreciated for those who live in my neck of the woods. Another beer well done Massachusetts!"
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O- I could drink this all night and be happy. really dig the coffee undertones at the end of each sip. An under-the-radar brew for sure!"
""
""
"Mouthfeel: All of medium bodied, probably a little full than that even. Nice low carbonation, and very smooth. Overall, I was honestly extremely impressed with this. One of the best oatmeal stouts I've had, if not the best."
""
"O- This is a great local stout. The flavor is very nice, it finish very smooth, and is very easy to drink. The price is absolutely unbeatable- ~$10 for a 6-pack, I definitely recommend picking some up. A beer that I've tried multiple times and definitely will pick up again."
""
""
"Overall this is a totally smackable beer. I will need to seek this out again at Total Wine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Basically, if you're a fan of good gourmet dark roast coffee (as I am), you will be a fan of this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An excellent oatmeal stout. Unfortunately it's on the abv high end, which cuts down on drinkability."
""
"O: One of the best oatmeal stouts out there. Maybe second only to Sam Smith's (which is divine). It's got nice sharp roasted malt qualities with the creaminess and added complexity of the oatmeal. A must-have for fans of the style."
""
""
"D - It is nice. I don't think it stands out against other oatmeal stouts though. I wouldn't mind having it again."
""
""
"Overall an enjoyable brew!"
""
""
"O- Not a bad beer. it has it's flaws, but I'd say they are in the eye of the drinker in this case. knowing what I'm getting into with this one now, with the large hop character and the dry mouthfeel, I could find myself in the mood for it and would buy it again."
"Mouthfeel is good- a little too tangy/acidic maybe, but not a fatal flaw. Full body with light carbonation, and a little oily. Excellent beer- being from Ohio, I have to say I like B.O.R.I.S. better but this is a great oatmeal stout."
"Black with some tannish foam. Initial nose comes through with good, strong oats and tootsie rolls, graham and some nice, nice cocoa. Nice nose. Slightly dry, coffee toned, grainy, oaty flavor up front with some nice bitterness on the back end. Nice malt character on this beer - so far soo good on this one. Thick and smooth with a lighter carb and semi dry character. Nice beer, really nice surprise."
""
"Smooth-ish and slightly drying. Medium body and light effervescence. Would like more body but a fine brew regardless."
"Cost: $12.99 for a six pack."
""
""
"Truly an impressive beer."

"22oz bottle. Pours a black dark brown color with an inch of dark brown head. Lots of lacing. Aromas of espresso, vanilla, dark chocolate, roasted malts and earth. Flavors of vanilla, espresso, and roasted malts. Sweet, but not overkill. Bittersweet coffee finish. Creamy mouthfeel. Nice amount of roasted malt and smoky flavor to go with the coffee and chocolate. Just the right amount of alcohol burn. Really good Oatmeal Stout worth having again for certain."
""
"Really nice brew. Worth a try for sure."
"Black like oi with a nice thick mocha head. A big rich and roasty aroma of barley, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and a touch of alcohol. Flavor matches the aroma quite well with with the addition of a nice hoppy, bitter finish. Medium bodied and creamy mouthfeel. A freakin awesome oatmeal stout, very very bold for the style IMO. I love oatmeal stouts, maybe my favorite style of beer, and this is my favorite oatmeal stout. This beer is so damn good."
""
"Ipswich makes a very smooth product, and it shows here. Its velvety and slick. Really nice. Just... great. It is a pleasure to drink this beer."
""
"O - This is a great beer, but I just can't get over the sour-milk like flavor which dominates it."
""
""
"Overall – The price tag was left on, and at 3.99 a bomber, holy cow. A fantastic beer for that price. I’m hard pressed to find a better value for a beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: It's fine. Would've preferred a skosh less in the IBU department and just a bit more silkiness in the mouthfeel. Still, it's fine. Fine, fine."
"O: Definitley getting more of this. I'll be goiung to this once I get sick of hops for a while. Awesome beer."
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great beer that I have enjoyed a few 6-packs of this winter, local availability and price (even when not on sale) make this a go-to oatmeal stout for me."
"Overall: The touch of chocolate does help to even out this brew and makes it more fitting to the style. I do prefer this style to be less carbonated and slightly thicker than this brew. Overall rating of fitting to the style would be average in my book."
""
""
""
"Not bad, definetly worth getting again."
"O - Really enjoyable stout. Looks, smells, and tastes very good. Pick some up!"
""
""
"O- this is an excellent beer. Great deal. tastes great. Great representation of the style"
"Very interesting in taste. The thick, heavy chocolate malts are like a brick; concrete and immovable, with coffee, molasses, and chocolate, yet halfway through, the hops kick in. This is unexpected. Medicinal and floral in nature, they teleport this beer, especially the finish and aftertaste, to a different place. Before this, I enjoyed a (very good) black IPA and I'm having a little deja vu. Certainly, this is smooth and tasty, and very well handcrafted, but I'm slightly resenting the hop takeover, as to me that's not what oatmeal stout is about, so to speak."
""
"Overall, liked it a lot. Holds strong, with stand up qualities."
""
""
"Poured a 1/8"" deep mocha head. The body looks dark as coffee. Smell has lots of coffee, cocoa, and roasted malt. Taste mirrors and even exceeds the smell. There's a deep richness and a medium weight. Perhaps a little overroasting but it contributes to the flavors. This far exceeded my expectations. In fact this degree of flavor intensity usually comes from an Imperial Stout, which it's obviously not."
"A good oatmeal stout, but nothing that stands out. There are a handful of other ones I'd rather grab, but its still worth trying."
"o - Overall a very nice oatmeal stout. The taste is very nice and the body is almost perfect; a very nice option if you're in the mood for an oatmeal stout. One of the better ones in the style I've had in a while."
""
""
"O: This was a really solid Oatmeal Stout. I liked it better than the Mendocino."
""
""
""
""
"Strong, smoky aroma has tones of chocolate and caramel and just a hint of roast coffee. It pours a rich, opaque coffee brown with a very thick, mostly fine-bubbled, rather persistent tan head. Flavor has a firm burnt wood overtone and caramel, semi-sweet chocolate and roast coffee notes, plus just a hint of licorice. Texture is a bit on the thin side for a stout, but still has a good fizz to it and leaves a smoky, slightly sweet finish. I look forward to trying more Ipswich offerings."

"22 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with an inch tan head that sticks around for a while. There's also a lot of lacing left behind on the glass. Aroma is nice and strong, it smells like roasted malt, oats, coffee, chocolate and a bit of vanilla. The taste is just like the aroma, it's all roasted malt, oats, coffee, chocolate and vanilla. There's good balance between the roasty, sweet and bitter flavors. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little creamy and coating with good carbonation. I have to say this is a pretty good overall brew, it's one of if not the best oatmeal stouts I've ever had. It's an excellent deal for just $5.99 a bomber, I definitely recommend this one!"
"Still solid. Enjoy."

"Overall a very good beer except for the overly astringent and almost plastic tasting beginning. I don't know if it is super roasted and supposed to be that way or if there was a problem somewhere. if this beer didn't have such a bad beginning it would be amazing. I'll have to try it again and hope for better results"
""
""
"D= I picked this up without knowing much at all about this beer and was very pleasantly surprised. This is a great oatmeal stout, brewed to a slightly stronger strength than I would have expected, but that 7% abv stays well hidden...thus its a dangerous one!"
"O - This is an excellent show of the style. Great flavor and silky body, really fills you up like it should, a little heavier taste would improve it though. The smell is excellent as well. This is now in competition with Samuel Smith's, depending on whether I want a little bitterness or not. If you like oatmeal stouts, I highly recommend trying this out."
"O: I'm incredibly impressed by this. I bought this as a part of a mix six and it sat in my fridge for about 5 months before I rediscovered it. The flavor combination really impressed me. Great coffee and chocolate."
"Overall: A good example of an oatmeal stout, a nice one to buy occasionally to mix into the rotation."
"O - Overall the smell and the mouthfel were both great, the taste was a little bit of a letdown."
"Notes; This is, in my opinion, one of the best oatmeal stouts on the market. Easily the most fairly priced too."
"Big aromas of roast, chocolate and fresh ground coffee beans, with a spike of hoppiness. Smells like a recipe for success, and indeed it is. Exceedingly thick and velvety body makes for an awesome feel. Toasty, roast, burnt and chocolate flavors- we've got all the required stout malt bases covered here. As it warms, bitterness and a citric hop undercurrent become more and more assertive. Both bitter and chocolatey in the swallow, a satisfying finish to a great beer. My favorite brew from a recent trip to the Boston area. Highly recommended."
"Been walking past this guy too many times at the store. Time to take him home. He pours a straight onyx topped by a finger of sienna foam. The nose comprises chocolate syrup, roasted malts, dark chocolate powder, molasses, and a touch of vanilla bean. The taste holds notes of darkly-roasted malts, very bitter dark chocolate (the kind you'd bake with, rather than eat straight-up), vinyl, anise, rubbing alcohol, charcoal, and molasses. Yowza, this stuff is acridly bitter! The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a nearly chewy feel, and a pretty dry finish. Overall, what would have been a pretty decent oatmeal stout suffers from an excess of bitterness and plastic-ness in the taste. My advice: keep walkin' on by this guy..."
"O: Pretty good stout right here. Very drinkible considering its thickness. Alcohol is masked by the coffee taste....would definitely try again..."
"Drinkability: A flavorful and enjoyable drink, that doesn't seem to match with its name. While I enjoyed this, and actually had a 6 pack, it seems more akin to a dry Irish Stout to me, so receives a little down tick."
"Overall: Great Oatmeal stout and a fantastic price point at a 5 dollar bomber! I expected a thicker beer than what it was, that was my only negative thought on this beer."
"A beer on my wants list for awhile all of the sudden popped up in my local store, how about that. This beer pours a very dark brown that looks black when viewed in the snifter. The darker tan foam on the surface is a good indicator that it's got some dark malts in store. The smell is rather muted, but still quite pleasant. I detected most prominently, aromas of coffee, charcoal, oatmeal, and vanilla. The flavor resembles many of the characteristics with adding in some complexities such as cinnamon and brown sugar. The oats helped with the creaminess of the mouthfeel, but not to the point where I really would have enjoyed that part. Overall this is a very good beer. It's nothing special, but I could find nothing wrong with it either."
"O: Very good representation of the style, but just a little over-carbonated. This one might want to sit for a while in the fridge before drinking."
"Overall - one of the better standard oatmeal stouts I have had, this one was spot on and a great example of the style."
"Thinner bodied than expected and surprisingly very hop forward with some dry bitterness that lingers over the roasted malt into a lingering dry finish. Pretty roasty with sme rich chocolate notes as well as hints of caramel, lots of oatmeal, toffee and burnt toast. Slightly bunt tasting and a bitthin for my liking but not bad."
"Truly world class imo - and after all these years, still satisfying to a jaded beer geek that is hard to please. Its a shame that not all beer stores recognize this as one of New England's best and would rather attempt to sell some other stout from far away instead."
"O: Really like this beer, a solid example of the style and one of the best I have had. Extremely affordable in Massachusetts as well. Will have to grab some more next time I am up there."
"The CPJ"
"I had a growler of this early in my beer-drinking life. At the time, I thought it was too bitter and burnt. I guess it is a good thing that I am now making the same observations four years later. This would be a winner in my book if it weren't so heavily charred."
"The mouth feel is rich, but still not as creamy as I would like from a stout. The oatmeal helps to round out the body of the beer so there isn't too sharp a bight from the carbonation."
"Over all my favorite stout. Hits all the right characteristics I look for in an oatmeal stout."
"Appearance is a deep mahognay with a tan cap that left nice lae. Smells of oats, coffee, dark chocalte, slighlty bitter and alcoholic. Very crinkable, with less sweetness than most oatmeals stouts I have had. Really good beer!"
"Pours a very nice black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy/creamy tan head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is very malty, with lots of chocolate/toffee/caramel. The taste is very nice, sweet, malty, very nice touch of dark stuff and some vanilla notes. Medium body. Very Drinkable, this is a very nice tasty brew, which we had something like this here in Utah."
"Pours a nice jet black body, modest one finger head brown in color, nice big ring of lacing remains. Typical porter smells with this one, sweet, dark chocolate, some caramel, maybe bubble gum. Tastes like a stout, sweet carmel, toffee, roasted barley, some earthy hop bitterness, lingering bubble gummy roasty bitterness, some tobacco some where in there too. Creamy medium full bodied, low carbing. I like this one and could easily have a few more. $1.80 a single."
"Overall, super enjoyable. I love this one. Smells and tastes almost like a imperial coffee stout, but drinks much easier. Grab this."
"Excellent drinkability for a beer of the style and ABV. Definitely not a ""session"" beer by any means but a couple pints aren't out of the question (and one will probably make you want two)."
"D- One glass begs for another. So many flavors to examine. Best Oatmeal Stout around."
"I reviewed the bottle version few months ago; everything I said there applies here, plus it gets a higher rating because it's even better on cask. Served at something below room temperature, both the aroma and taste are intensified; you'll find enough dried fruit in here to solve any constipation problem, plus there's enough coffee to satisfy everything you'll need in the morning. The color is black-hole black; the body is dense and heavy; the complexities are deep and wide. Among the finest winter brews I've had in a long time."
"D - Drinkability is low. The first few sips were enjoyable, but as the beer drinks, the bitterness just compounds on itself and it's a bit of a bitter pill to swallow."
"Underated. So happy I tried this."
"Pours a very dark brown that borders on black with a good tan head. Head lasts for quite some time and leaves behind really nice lacing. The nose is really quite nice with roasted malt, toasted oats, coffee, and a good dose of chocolate. The taste carries the same components, but they don't meld and pop as much as in the flavor. Really nice body; creamy and delicious. I love getting extras like this--a brewery I had never heard of before this that brings a really solid offering to my glass."
"Overall, while a stout man, I've not been turned on much by many stouts, including oatmeal stouts. This was, and is, everything one should be."
"Not something I'd seek out again, but glad I tried it at least."
"Kinda lacks the smooth creamy feel I'd expect from an oatmeal stout, not really seeing the oatmeal at all."
"Drinkability- This is good for about one to two bottles per session. Too thick and high of alcohol content to be a session beer."
"drinks wonderfully. not the most attractive stout, and it lacks a bit of body, but its absolutely delicious. I cannot believe I haven't tried this one before. I'm sure I will try it again soon. Reminds me of Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter, but a bit more charred. Well done!"
"Drinkability is good. I could certainly drink a few of these on a cold day or for that matter any day actually. Overall this is a very tasty oatmeal stout that's worth a pint or two or more, very well done."
"I really like this beer-flavorful and smooth."
"D: Very nice malt profile throwing everything from smooth oats to hearty charred malts into the mix with spicy, herbal and citrusy hops made this stout a treat. The 7% ABV has warming qualities all its own but drinks much smaller; re: dangerous stout! Would definitely reccommend and buy again."
"Overall, this is quite nice, and were it local, something I'd keep around more often. Some light tweaks I think could finish off what is initially a velvety smooth pour and give it an improved head."
"D- Excellent! This is a fantastic stout, well worth a try."
"D: Simply put, one of the best oatmeal stouts out there. Huge flavor, pretty big ABV as well."
"D- drinkable, but the bitterness of the coffee could be too much if you're not careful. I'd buy again if I was in New England."
"D: Not too bad."
"Cheers!!!"
"Great deep black coloring to this oatmeal stout. More dark chocolate than oatmeal flavor shines through. Heavy and bold flavor, but smooth and surprisingly drinkable. Sweet and roasted notes compete and the beer which finishes a tad bitter, but very enjoyable."
"Ink black with a slight creamy head, smells of coffee and dark chocolate, mouthfeel is so rich it is indulgence. If price point is of interest, at 7.99 a 6 pack, this beer is a walk away winner. Thank you Ipswich for crafting a winner I can actually afford to drink regularly. I'm getting spoiled."
"D - An excellent example of the style. At 7% this is dangerously drinkable...."
"I must say, I am impressed with this beer, the color on this is amazing, looks almost purple, little/no foam, some tiny bubble persist around the edge of the pint glass. Thick, rich, reminds me of a few of the brown ales I have had recently, but more potent, as it should be. Strong tasting, hints of mocha/coffee present, taste registers strong from beginning to end, stays with you a little after but not too much at all. My favorite Ipswich Ale I have had to date. Solid, I'll be back for more. Definitely worth it."
"This is a great stout. I need to find a case of this. Unfortunately I bought a mixed case and there are a total of 4 of these WTF..."
"D: I wasn't as impressed with this beer as I hoped to be. A nice looking and smelling beer, but the flavor fell a bit short."
"All in all, this is an ok brew. There are many better oatmeal / breakfast brews than this. Not worth hunting down."
"D - I wouldn't want to face this beer in the ring... it would kick my ass. I have sparred with some pretty fierce dudes... none of them have been as intimidating as this monster. Regardless. I love it. This is a badass stout."
"Drinkability: Worth a try but I think there are better examples in the style. I like the chewiness, but the flavor is not as full as others I have had. Still for the price, it is well worth having another."
"Finishes with a clean aftertaste that lingers with a hint of strong, dark coffee. This beer has a lot of body but the carbonation keeps it from feeling too slick. Another excellent style from the Mercury Brewing Company - loaded with body and flavor."
"Medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel is pretty standard as far as oatmeal stouts go. Never felt overbearing or too thick for the flavor profile. Overall this is a pretty nice beer and definitely well made and approachable for its interesting 7% ABV. It also worked well in a batch of beer brownies."
"Ink black with thick and creamy light brown head. Lots of lace. Smells strongly like a mix of coffee and sweet chocolate with a roasted malt twang. Floral hops in the background. The taste does the aroma justice with the roasted malt coming through in a big way and balanced by sweetness. Bitter smokey finish. The flavor is phenomenal and the beer is highly drinkable. I could easily have a few of these without coming close to wanting something else."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on February 19, 2010. The pour is nearly black with about three-quarters frothy head that stays around for the entire time. The aroma is overwhelmed by chocolate and coffee with the oatmeal, a bit of bread or biscuits balancing it out. The mouthfeel is good and heavy. The taste is very nice although not quite as powerful as the aroma lead you to believe. It is full of coffee grinds, chocolate, and a pleasing background of hops. Overall this is a fine oatmeal stout."
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. Pours out jet black with almost no highlights to it. Slight light highlights on the side, but it really pours out dark, thick and rich looking. It had a big dark tanned colored head to it that sticks around for several minutes, and produces some decent lacing to it. It's a hearty, rich looking beer. After smelling it, it could get away with being called a coffee stout. The more I smelled it I realized, it's a very generously hopped beer, especially for a stout. There are no doubt coffee and chocolate aromas to this beer, but the hops are probably the most dominant feature. The taste doesn't mess around, it has a flavor along the lines of an imperial stout. I guess this beer is having a bit of an identity crisis here. Again, very strong traces of coffee, chocolate. Burned malts, grains and oats compliment the coffee and chocolate tastes and has a nice hoppy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good, but certainly could be better. I think this is where all the flavors caught up with itself and all that was going on just kind of complicated the mouthfeel. It could have been a little smoother to help balance out the bitterness of the hops. The drinkability is still pretty top notch. All in all this is probably, the best oatmeal stout I've had. I remember this is one of the first oatmeal stouts I ever had when I first got into craft beer. I didn't remember it that well, but remembered liking it. I think my tastes have changed over the years, but it's good to know I appreciated good beer back then as well. It's a high quality brew, go out and get some!"
"The taste is ash, skim milk, bitter dark chocolate, and hints of caramel. It may be a little too light bodied for an oatmeal stout, but really it goes down pretty easy and is somewhat tasty. Not a standout, but worth trying for sure."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with low carbonation and a lingering, chocolatey feeling finish. The drinkability is good but this is a two and done stout at the most. I'm impressed with this beer and the price (8.99/6 pack) makes it a great value. This might be the best stout from New England."
"Poured a near opque black but for a glimmer of ruby showing through,a thinner but well retained tannish colored head atop.A mix of roasted coffee and mollases stick out the most in the nose.A great mix of heavy roast and softer sweet flavors,dark roast coffee, along with a little wood, meld into molasses and chocolate flavors,there is a softness to the beer wich is nice.A very nice oatmeal stout,you would never know the alcohol content."
"Moderate head, plethora of larger bottles likely contributes to it resolving down to a thin layer across the surface, leaves behind credible thick streaks of lacing. The liquid is blackish brown throughout, nary a trace of any lighter color. Pretty gosh darn powerful nose of dark chocolate, cappuchino, butterscotch and a gentle overall roasted feel, blends in plum and cherry fruit scents, fresh scones and oatmeal, while not present in terms of specific scents, the hops reveal themselves in the erect posture it has in your nostrils. Medium-bodied, dense with a big initial swirl of carbonation which slowly fades off as it progresses through the mouth. More grain-driven and herbal here, produces additional bitterness in the dark chocolate and coffee elements. English muffin, breakfast breads sort of things going on. Here a raw nuttiness develops. Not a creamy sort of stout, has a fizzy mineral water like consistency. Smoky finish, helps it lift into a cloud inside the mouth rather than soak more deeply into the tongue."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is very nice, I could definately have more than one of these. Overall, I think this is a very good example of the style. I can imagine myself sitting in front of a fire with this one on a cold winter night. That is if we had cold winter nights down here is Florida. Skal."
"M/D - Light and creamy in the mouth. Bitterness is a little strong but not too much. Not the easiest of drinking oatmeal stouts, but still rather drinkable."
"D: Very drinkable stout with a nice complex malt profile and smooth chocolate creaminess. Dark chocolate lovers will dig this one!! Highly recommend this beer."
"This is a fantastic beer for sure.. on a nice chilly weekend like this past one this was the perfect beer to be sipping on. Pours jet black with a nice tan head to it.. tons of lacing. Smell is of some dark fruits. Taste is super, super creamy and just full of flavor. Some nice roasted malt flavor, some dark fruit flavor, and even some smokiness flavor all mixed together. Superior drinkability for its 7% ABV.. just all around a great beer and the whole Ipswich mixed 12 pack (for only $14.99) has to be one of the best 12 packs out there, give it a try!"
"Drinkability: Excellent beer. This one's a slow sipper with a complex and well crafted smell and flavor. Big fan."
"Rich, dark, smooth. Like a flannel quilt in your mouth. Huge head of creamy color (at room temperature pour into a pint glass.) Classic stout in appearance, not highly flavored but deeply layered. Too many gave me a killer morning after headache, but that was an error on my part, not the brewers' part. Definitely not a session beer."
"The taste lingers as a bit tart and dry, but somwhat watered-down balance. Somewhat creamy initially, but fades away to nothing."
"Overall Impression: I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and would certainly have it again. However I found it a bit too sweet and would definitely have to be in the mood for something like this."
"Overall not bad, but not the best. The bitterness gets a bit astringent and over bitter with both spicy earthy hops, and the acrid roasted malt going overboard a bit. Chewy, lots of oats, nice chocolate cocoa but a bit powdered, little too roasty overall."
"This is a beer that pays dividends for swishing, swirling and experimenting on the tongue. It opens up easily, revealing a fairly complex, rounded, & motley collection of brewing highlights - on the top of my mouth I feel a warming mix of bitter coffee, oats and dark, dry cocoa. The bitter cocoa highlights hang around and slide towards the throat as a warming bitter and earthy hoppiness takes hold in the finish. My sweet tooth is asking for a more rounded sweetness in the middle... Finishes a little thin - yet filmy - which takes away from the mix of oats and hops that have now fully emerged. It's dry, piney and hot now - no denying it brother. Still, malty sweetness is apparent enough for me to forgive, forget and enjoy completely. The filmy characteristics could use a hand from some better developed carbonation - bubbling is large, sometimes cumbersome in the throat, taking away slightly from an otherwise stellar drinking beer."
"Drinkability -Since this was the first time enjoying a style like this, it took me a couple bottles to get acquainted with it. But since then, I absolutely love how drinkable this one is. Very, very tasty. The flavors in it are very remarkable and pronounced. I could definitely have a few and could possible be a nice session beer."
"Pours black with some red and a nice dark tan thick two-finger head that receeds fairly quickly to a ring around the edge of the top of the beer. Lacing left at the top half of the glass. Smells of roasted malts, chocolate, and some coffee, maybe even some fruits. Tastes of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and a little bit of bitterness/hops at the end. Definitely get some sweetness from the oats in this one. Taste of roasted coffee/malts coats the mouth during the whole drink. Mouthfeel is medium, creamy and good carbonation, seems right for the style, goes down nice and smooth. This is a drinkable stout, not too filling, great taste, good price for the quality, no reason not to pick this one up again. Reminds me of Chokolat but for a fraction of the price, love the roastiness to this one."
"Overall, this is a very good beer, but not a great oatmeal stout. I like it, but it doesn't have the creamy smoothness of some other examples of this style."
"The drink is medium-fullish in body with fine carbonation, and is highly quaffable even given the 7% ABV. Very tasty."
"4.0 D - Very drinkable. One of the most drinkable stouts I've tried. Very filling though"
"can't wait to get more, and thier 12 beer sample pack is a great buy all good beers."
"D= pretty good oatmeal stout. Prolly the most oatmeally I've ever had. Impressed me quite a bit."
"Drinkability - A very unique oatmeal stout, and it was very nice to be able to try. I prefer St. Ambroise, but this one does carve out a niche of its own."
"The appearence is deep black with a nice tan head. Thick lacing as the beer recedes. Smell is dark fruits, roasted malts, soy, and earth hopiness. The taste has coffee bitterness, dark fruitness an d a milky sweetness. Mouthfeel is very creamy and low carbonation. Overall this is a pretty solid stout. Glad I got to try it."
"All in all an excellent example of one of my favorite styles. I'm sorry it took me 6 years to notice this after I had my first Sam Smith, but I'll try to make up for the lost time with another purchase or two. Highly recommended if you like the style, worth a shot if you don't."
"Thanks Steve."
"Pours out black with a thick brown head that stays around all the way down. Lacing is ok. Smells strong with sweet smoked malts. Taste very much like the scent, with the addition of a strong oaked flavor. The oatmeal leaves a rather dry feel. The mouthfeel is a little light for this style, but it doesn't take away from the beer."
"Man this is one good stout, I could have myself more then one of these. Really tasty."
"I am not a big stout fan and I rate this on its style more than my personal preference for this style."
"A very good beer, probably my favorite from Ipswich. Very sessionable stout, great roastiness without being to cloyingly sweet. Tons of flavor, highly recommend."
"A really great stout, this a really great feeling beer with a big feel and big flavor. It is smooth with a slight milky feel and goes down well."
"Overall-fantastic, one of the best stouts I've ever had. Great stuff. Kudos to Ipswich."
"D: again, hard to overstate how smooth this 7%-er goes down"
"Good solid beer with enough interesting characteristics to make it rise above the pack."
"Overall, I truly enjoyed this stout and thought it had great smokey, roasted flavor. Certainly surpassed my expectations."
"D- Excellent! This is a fantastic stout, well worth a try."
"Found at La Boniche restaurant in downtown Lowell, MA, this one poured a pitch black-brown color with a chocolate colored big head and lots of lacing. The aroma brings a tart malt intensity, bitter coffee bean, a bit of sour milk, very nice actually. The taste is a beautiful blend of coffee and mild chocolate, a very pleasant combination of bitterness and modest sweetness. Near full-bodied but quite drinkable for the style. Very likeable with hints of apple and cinnamon, and just a kiss of smoke. Good complexity, smooth, just an all around excellent brew. A great surprise and highly recommended."
"This beer pours a deep, deep opaque dark brown, almost black. There is a very thin head of light brown head, wispy lacing left on the sides. Nose is slightly smoked, with roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate. Taste is great! Roasted coffee is the most predominant flavoring with notes of bitter chocolate interweaved with the chocolate taste, with the finish tasting like a bowl of oatmeal. Mouthfeel is heavier bodied, slightly oily going down, decent carbonation. I found this to be an extremely drinkable beer and could see myself sitting with it for a session."
"Notes: This one I thought was going to be a bit bigger. But none the less a nice and very drinkable oatmeal stout."
"Very smooth and drinkable, at the cost of body. Taste is a less sweet, slightly bitter chocolate syrup. A little bit chalky, but not in an overbearingly artificial or powdery way. Chocolate flavoring lingers nicely. A little bit of bitterness at the end with hop finish, plays in well to offset the sweetness. Carbonation is on the higher side, which is where I like it. Mouthfeel is where this offering suffers a bit, it goes a little weak right off the bat. Would like to see a little more heft, volume, body behind it. Very smooth, silky if not complex. Extremely drinkable. A great session stout, if not the be-all and end-all of awesome. When compared to some other local stouts like Gritty's Black Fly, this will come out on top."
"One of the best Oatmeal Stouts of I have ever had. Very smooth and not overpowering."
"No aroma but the appearance and taste compensate. Not the darkest body but a unique, dirty beige head that sits to rest; full circle thick lacing. Light roast, bubbly carbonation washes the stand out flavors away. A safe dry middle ground with a bit of a tang from the cocoa notes. The tang lingers well after the conservative center. A well balanced ale and a session stout for those with an abused palate."
"Very good oatmeal stout. High abv. for an oatmeal stout which along with lots of flavor contribute to a big oatmeal stout."
"Blipped ""Rare Auld Extra Stout"" by the Bloody Irish Boys"
"Overall this is a tasty oatmeal stout that's worth a shot - very well done. Thanks again to Norica for sending this one along!"
"Via donkeyrunner"
"Overall, an excellent oatmeal stout that I'm glad I got to try. Wouldn't mind several of these a year. Highly recommend and can't wait to try some other beers from them."
"I wish I had more of these."
"D: The alcohol is well-hidden; only the smoothness of the stout comes through. A nice nightcap."
"to me, maybe the best bottled stout. i've never had it on tap, but i reckon it'd be even better."
"Smooth feel of surprisingly tight bubbles of carbonation with a creaminess aided by the oats. Tastes of roasted chocolate and espresso. Alcohol content is nowhere to be found save for a glowing warmth. Leaves a finishing taste of faintly bitter hops and roasted malts. Very enjoyable and highly recommended. Good value too!"
"I found a bottle of this at a friend's house and had no idea what to expect. So to call it a pleasant surprise would be an understatement. It's got some guts, and some very enjoyable traits that make it an effortless quaff. And despite an ABV that could sneak up on one, it's a warm welcome as well. I'll gladly keep my eyes open for other offerings by Ipswich in the future, not to mention this one in particular."
"Pours a solid black with a creamy tan head the dissipates quickly to form a cap. Smells of chocolate, some roasted malts, a bit of licorice some subdued hops. Taste is roasty, chocolaty, bit of acridic bitterness finishing with a nice lingering roast and hop aftertaste. Creamy smooth mouthfeel, medium body. ample carbonation. Great little oatmeal stout. Lots of flavor and easy to drink."
"For a full body it's very drinkable. Truly one of the better stouts around. The finish, I think, is near perfection and the aftertaste is just awesome. It's a little hard to find around me, but it's worth every minute spent searching."
"D - Pretty good though the it would be work to have more than one."
"This is everything I ever wanted from a stout. My heart is aflutter."
"OK. I'm on a stout kick and have had trouble finding much variety in the stores around here. The local brew pub lost their brewer so it's pretty slim pickens, but this just came in to the local liquor store and it's a keeper. It has a nice dark color. The head is nicely colored as well, with kind of a mocha chocolate hue. It get's a bit thin as you drink it, however, especially for an oatmeal stout. The taste is amazing, with a kind of thick, satisfying blend of hops and a rich sweetness including chocolate and espresso. About the only criticism I can think of is the label, which is kind of bland and boring, but maybe that will grow on me."
"Mercury has another winner here. They really make some impressive beer. The only thing not to like about this one is the mouthfeel. Too thin. Other than that, there's loads of win in here. Highly recommended."
"Cheers!"
"This beer isn't going to wow a lot of people like some other more elusive stouts out there, but this guy is an excellent go to stout."
"Easily drinkable very well crafted - recommended on a cold night by the fire, where I am now! Ok, you got my attention Mercury Brewing Company, I'm ready to try more!"
"Pours a pitch black with a small receding brown head. Nice chocolate oatmeal aroma with a heavy slick palate. Beer has some body to it. Flavor is a nice blend of roasted malt, chocolate, oatmeal and perhaps a hint of molasses. Alcohol is well hidden and not a factor in the flavor."
"Overall this is what I am talking about. A nice stout that isn't too heavy on the alcohol but delivers full bore on the flavor. Rich and creamy, subtle and distinct. I would not shy away from this one anytime."
"12oz bottle from a mixed 12pack from Market Basket. Pours a completely opaque black body with nearly an inch of tan/light brown head. Roastiness and Toastiness emanate from the aroma. Toastiness and roastiness characterize the flavor as well. Dark chocolate comes to mind for sure, hints of espresso. Rich full mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. While not overly drinkable by some standards, one sip most definitely invites another. One of the finest oatmeal stouts I've had."
"Drinkability is ok, but this wasn't my taste in the style at all...the bitterness is too acrid, and the sweetness is a malty flavor I don't really care for. Overall it reminded me of a stale, generic milk chocolate bar."
"HV"
"Pours a black sea of a brew that spreads a delicious oatmeal, chocolate covered raisin aroma out into the air. Tastes of dark chocolate, malt, and sweet oatmeal. A delicious stout that ranks among the top dogs in the category. A great masking of the alcohol made possible by rich chocolate malt and oatmeal flavors. A good night cap brew that begs to be sipped fireside."
"A little fizz on the tongue, and very drinkable. This is a dynamite local stout. Another great beer from these guys. Do give it a try."
"The mouthfeel was generally smooth and overall its a pretty drinkable beer. Seems a little big to be just 7%, but a good beer none the less."
"Pours an inky black with a disk of milk chocolate head. Smell is huge, wonderful aromas of bread, bakers chocolate, roasty and nutty with an impressive dark fruit / raisins covered in chocolate dominance. Taste great! Begins sweet, dark fruit, chocolate granola, toast, raspberry. At the swallow left with a roasty, oaty and a very nice floral breath after. Mouthfeel is refreshing, even as roasty as this is it is so easy to drink. Wonderful way to celebrate finally having electricity!"
"A fantastic example of an oatmeal stout. Wish I had many more of these."
"I did pick up some alcohol on the finish towards the end of the pint which might limit the drink a bit. But since the beer was initially served rather cold I think I let the carbonation outgas a bit much given the open time. Next time I'll let the bottle warm a bit prior to opening. Look forward to trying again."
"Drinkability - Definitely one of the better stouts that I have had. well balanced and pleasant. Will definitely buy some more as the colder weather rolls in."
"Drinkability is very nice. There are better oatmeal stouts out there. However, this offering is probably the most drinkable of them all. This is a very above average oatmeal stout, with nothing spectacular to it. If you have a friend who has never had an oatmeal stout, let them try this, as it is a really good example, without being crazy."
"Pours pitch-black, some brown highlights when held up to the light.... vigorous pour produces a massive and glorious mocha-colored head that fades very slowly and leaves nice patches of lacing. Dark roasted malts in the nose, chocolate-covered espresso beans, charred wood. Lots of coffee taste...strong black coffee, bittersweet chocolate, nicely charred edges, and a barely detectable hoppy bitterness. Creamy as hell, full-bodied, tons of lingering bitter coffee aftertaste. I could drink this all year long...and I do! One of my personal favorites, and made locally! Just a brilliant beer, and this is the Oatmeal Stout I use as a basis for comparison for anything else in the style."
"D - a pretty easy drinking stout."
"Thanks to corey0212 for including this one as an extra in a recent trade. What a surprise this beer is! Really delicious! Pours black with a fairly short but nice coffee crema colored head. Roasty aromas with a good dose of cocoa and a touch of vanilla. Beautiful flavor of bitter chocolate that just resonates nicely with the light roastiness and vanilla. There is a touch of cream there at the end as well. Very nicely balanced. Smooth and mouth-coating. Just delicious to drink. The bitterness and cocoa and roastiness really are combined very well. I would definitely buy this if it were local to me."
"D - The only thing that would keep me from drinking a bunch of these is the lingering bitterness. A fine oatmeal stout."
"Overall, a very nice, everyday, stout. Give it a little age first if you dont like hoppy stouts."
"Tastes like it was brewed in the tradition of English-bred oatmeal stouts. The easiest description is that this beer tastes like I imagine Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout fresh. Very smooth milk chocolate with oats (like how they taste in a cookie) and a java edge. The body is smooth and the medium weight. Worth seeking out."
"This beer pours black. The taste is chocolate and coffee. This beer has a full body with a smooth creamy and oily mouthfeel that I began to enjoy more and more as I got toward the bottom of the glass. I am a big fan of Samuel smith's oatmeal stout and they gave them a run for their money. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone that enjoys a good oatmeal stout."
"drinkability is good. this is a solid oatmeal stout. not too overpowering, but just enough richness to sustain the roasted character. a wonderfully creamy texture and a lingering malt character make this one a drinkable and enjoyable stout. cheers!"
"Grabbed a bottle while hanging out with friends at Trident on Newbury tonight. Poured into a smallish beer glass. Very dark brown in color. A very thin head formed, which was a bit of a negative surprise. Smell was good, very coffee like. Taste was excellent. Nice balance of flavor. This is the first oatmeal stout that I've had in a while that actually tasted like an oatmeal stout, and not just a regular stout. Very thick in the mouthfeel. This beer has some substance. A great beer on a rainy night to just sit with and let it warm up and taste all of that excellent flavor. Probably my favorite beer from Mercury."
"D - Drinkability is good for this oatmeal stout. There is a balance of flavor that works well with my palate. It is very, very smooth. The alcohol stays well hidden. Ipswich really did a good job with this one. Recommended to anyone who likes a good stout."
"Poured a deep black with brown around the edges. It looked like syrup as it poured, and left small specks on the mug. Taste and smell both had a chocolate/coffee flavor. It didn't feel as thick as it looked when pouring, and had just the right amount of carbonation. I can't say that I loved it, but I enjoyed it enough that I would try it again."
"d: Big thanks to joepais for this extra. This is one of the best oatmeal stouts I've tried."
"A great melange of coffee, some chocolate. Incredibly smooth and well malted for drinkability. Ice cream mouthfeel. Some vanilla,chocolate in finish full mouthfeel. Superior stout and oatmeal stout. Dark coloured body and some mocha soapy head. Great nose of roast.Only critique is a mid-sip temporary dryness."
"Drinkability is near perfect, despite the ABV."
"I finished the beer pleased, but not blown away."
"Bottle courtesy of JoePais. Thanks for the fantastic extra! Pours a dark black with lots of floaties in it. Nice big brown lasting creamy head with lacing. Smell is dark dry roastiness, ash, coffee, cream. Taste is dark roasty semi creamy bittersweet roastiness. Slightly thin body but just a great flavor. Slightly ashy, burnt and bitter finish that I really liked. Moderate to high carbonation, and this is a really nice oatmeal stout. Thanks again!"
"The hop barrage and the ABV probably disqualify Ipswich Oatmeal Stout as a session beer. That's okay, I rarely session anyway. This expertly crafted ale is a tribute to its brewers and is a beer that I would love to have access to. If you do, consider yourself fortunate."
"Oatmeal stout is a matter of taste, and it has been awhile. The beer pours an inky black with a deep dark head that is very promising and enticing. There could be a thicker, frothier head, and that would have sealed the deal for me. The head is very modest and doesn't retain nearly long enough. The lacing is okay. This is a thick, dark, full bodied ale with plenty of character. The smell as everyone else mentioned is roasted or charred oats, grains, burnt malts, dark roasted coffee or espresso, maybe a hint of chocolate, and a slightly off sweet malt aroma, perhaps a bit phenolic. Thankfully the off aromas seemed to dissipate as the beer settles. The taste is robust and this is a sipping beer for me. It doesn't have an oppressively high ABV, but this is a thick coffee, slightly sweet, oaty, biscuity, deep roated malty ale if there ever was one. I do like this better than an imperial stout because it displays less biting astringency and harsh flavors. This beer is not to everyone's tastes. I appreciate the style, but it isn't my favorite. As for Oatmeal stouts, I prefer Sam Smith's a bit more. There is a creamy, oily, inky mouthfeel and this carries on into the aftertaste. The beer is smooth, deep, and dark and it does make a statement."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D- The very first time I had this I was astounded at the difference between it and other stouts that I had had previously. This is far superior to most of those, though the uncommonly thick body took some getting used to compared to the guinness and other dry stouts that I swore by back in the day. Having since graduated to imperial stouts, I still find each sip of this old favorite to be something I savor and enjoy, going down nice and easy and whetting the pallet for the next delicious sip. There is a good reason why this is still one of my all time favorite beers."
"D: very rich, robust and a full hearty oatmeal that was enjoyable."
"The beer is a little more bitter than I would like for a beer of this style. It is drinkable but its heavy in my stomach."
"Pours a deep brown/black color with a thick tan head that laces the glass all the way down. Great look to it. It has a sweet oatmealy aroma with hints of chocolate in the body. The taste is really good. Very nice sweet malty body with hints of chocolate at the end. Goes down really smooth as it has a nice velvety mouthfeel with the perfect amount of carbonation which makes it a really drinkable beer. A must try for all the stout drinkers out there."
"A used motor oil jet black body is the host to an awsome two finger thick milk chocolate colored head with huge rocky bubbles. Decent staying power as it clings to the glass. You start to get the nose on this one as you pop the cap. Roaste malts and chocolatey oats create a subtle but beckoning aroma. Enters tha mouth with very bold richness that really takes over the entire palate. Lovely darkness coats the mouth with notes of dark roasted coffee, uakers chocolate and a bitterness that reallly hangs on to the tongue. Mouthfeel is super thick like it begs for the next sip. The drinkability is only slightly hampered by the bitter that hangs around. Wonderful brew that is one of my new favorites."
"Thanks to tayner for the extra!"
"Flavors of charred malt, plum, slightly sweet and a little boozy. Aftertaste is somewhat earthy, chalky and dries out the palate. After having several other big beers, my impression was that this was a good stout, but more dry and boozy than what I would normally look for in an Oatmeal Stout."
"Pours like motor oil with a dark tan head that does not really stick around all that long. Nose is nice rich chocolate malts. Flavor is extremely robust with a strong roasted quality to it. Coffee tones are there as well. Leaves a long lasting aftertaste. Feel is extremely thick on the liquid and low on the bubble. Very drinkable. A bit thick which might turn some off, but I have to say this one took me by surprise as I had no expectation. Worth trying. There's a reason why this is one of the top oatmeal stouts."
"Drinkability: easy to quaff this stout as the flavor profile is so big and tasty. Nice beer to have any time of year."
"Another solid beer from the Ipswich line from Mercury."
"D - I could drink this all night if it wasn't for the higher ABV. I had two bottles and enjoyed every last sip"
"Stiffly carbonated, the body is underweight. Ashy; not the feel I was expecting. It itches."
"This was a staple of mine back in my Boston days, so I'm glad to see it on the shelves in NJ. It's full of flavour and well balanced and a nice example of the style. Grab some if you spot it."
"I could do this as a session, although at 7% i might regret it in the morning! It sort of reminded me of a less boozy version of a stockyard oatmeal stout. Thanks to leftmindedrightly for this brew, it is fantastic and i must track down some more soon."
"Poured into an American Pint. Opaque black in color with a generous light, coffee-colored head that dissipated into a thin, intact layer during the tasting. Consistent lacing throughout the serving. Scent of roasted coffee, malt, oatmeal and brown sugar. Slightly effervescent in the mouth, consistency was a little more watery than I remember, but pleasant nonetheless. More flavors of roasted coffee and perhaps molasses. A very drinkable brew for a cool day."
"I really enjoyed this brew- it a wonderfully crafted brew."
"D-This is a very well balanced stout. The well hidden alcohol and rich mouthfeel make this a winner in my book."
"D: enjoyable could have more than one."
"Pours out black with a 2 finger thick chocolate milk head that dies to a ring. Minimal lacing. Smells mildly roasty with the oatmeal apparant. Taste is mild bakers chocolate, roasty and oatmeal. Medium in the mouth and very refreshing for a stout. Off the charts drinkability, does not bog down with thickness. A very tasty brew worth seeking out"
"A solid oatmeal stout. Surprised to discover high abv, as it is well covered. Tasty and smooth!"
"Love the look and feel of this beer but I do wish the flavor was more complex. I could almost bump the drinkability of this beer a half point if there was just some extra nuances to this but there aren't. Still can't say I will never drink this again. I really can't think of a beer with a better mouthfeel this is really a six in that department."
"Overall- A beautiful looking and damn good tasting beer here."
"D - Fantastic. One you want more and more of. Simply amazing for the style."
"Pours an opaque black, red edges, thick dark tan head forms, settles to a solid ring, decent lacing. Smell is amazing, sweet, chocolate and oatmeal, roast, toffee, vanilla, very rich. Taste is lots of chocolate and oatmeal, rich roast, caramel, vanilla, licorice, dark roast coffee finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, very very nice, very smooth. Would not have guessed this at 7%. Very well done."
"Not to be missed."
"flavor has less chocolate and more coffee than the aroma, especially in the aftertaste. herbal hop bouquet is somewhat prominent, but seems to balance fine with the oatmeal. slight acidity."
"Pours a complete opaque midnight black with a nice frothy two finger tan head that slowly dies down to a nice layer. Stickiness is amazing, how it should be for this style. Smell is a very smokey roasted malt with a very mild oat sweetness blended with milk chocolate. Taste isn't as sweet as I usually like my Oatmeal Stouts, but that doesn't matter. Very roasted malt up front with a tiny hop bite that balances it out well. Midway through the toasted oat flavor emerges followed by a nutty-coffee like aftertaste that is very enjoyable. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. I find the 7% abv hard to believe but that's what makes this brew even more amazing. By far one of the best Oatmeal Stouts out there, get a hold of this one for sure."
"Poured into a pint glass, this was an opaque black with a medium tan head and some very nice lacing. It had a dark coffee, chocolate aroma. Espresso/burnt coffee taste, a little chocolate. Both the aroma and the taste were enhanced as the beer warmed. A rich beer, and very nice to drink."
"Pours an opaque darkness with a big tan head that resists fading. Enjoying the 3d lacing. The smell is really faint and obscure until it warms up significantly. I get a little bit of roasted texture and an earthiness from the oat. Full bodied, the mouth feel is first off creamy. Full flavored, the mild roasted malt and oat notes are complemented by the feel and aroma. The 7% ABV is real, but easily well hidden by these stout, no pun intended, ingredients. I will definitely revisit this if i have the opportunity."
"This is a local favorite of mine. Poured into a English style pint glass a pitch black color, with a thin tan lace on top. In the aroma were earth tones, (similar to a dry stout) chocolate cake, oatmeal, and a bit of burnt coffee bean. Flavors that I was able to pick up on included more burnt coffee, dark unsweetened chocolate, and the oatmeal. Mouthfeel was medium to heavy and surprisingly pronounced with the hops, making it more robust than some of the other oatmeal stouts I have tasted. Even with the 7% ABV, this is very easy to drink. Still though, I recommend letting it warm up a bit so that more of the nuances can pull through and make themselves known. Goes great with blue cheese. Cheers"
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich, black and roasted malt scent. It's bold and earthy with some light oatmeal notes. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth black malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and earthy with some mild warming. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking OS, but it could use some more body IMO. It's dry and earthy with an elevated abv. . It just lacks body."
"Highly recommended. Worth seeking out and/or trading for."
"Definintely a good brew!"
"One of the better oatmeal stouts around."
"D: Rich, full-flavored oatmeal stout - my favorite of this style I've tried to date. Heavy coffee and chocolate - this seems ideally paired with smoky meats or a chocolate-y dessert. A sipper, very satisfying."
"Thanks, ClockworkOrange and donkeyrunner, for the awesome treat"
"Aftertaste is like bittersweet chocolate...satisfying yet making you want for more."
"Appears dark, with no head whatsoever, and no evidence of carbonation. Smell was dominated by roasted malt, coffee and chocolate, with a slight hint of the oats. The taste was a strong, full chocolate malt flavor, along with burnt coffee and molassas. The oatmeal made a pleasant appearance in the aftertaste. Also, I could definately detect the alcohol, which unfortunately was one of the defining features of the aftertaste. Still, this is quite a tasty beer, and if stout is the name of your game, I'd check it out. The beer went down heavy and warm, and filled me up, but not so much that I didn't enjoy another beer or two after this one."
"Nearly black with chestnut edges and a fluffy brown head. As the foam settled slowly, spotty chunks of lace stuck to the glass. Nice aroma! Equal parts roast, caramel, and milk chocolate, with just a hint of acidity. Bitterness was solid, but well balanced with the malt. Roast was a little less prominent in the flavour, which allowed the sweeter malts to contribute a bit more overall. Milk and dark chocolate were evident, as was caramel and a little toffee. Hints of vanilla and oats faded in and out. The oats really smoothed out the texture. Not quite oily, but full and even with creamy carbonation. This beer just hits all the right notes in all categories. Very well made and quite an enjoyable drink."
"D- I wish I could give this brew a 4.999. The only reason the mouthfeel is lowered is just since that would take the littlest off the score. I don't think it is a perfect 5 but it is one of the closest beers to a perfect. I wish I could get this here."
"Overall: Excelent oatmeal stout. A little bit less sweet and more complex than that of the standard which is sam smith's. The alcohol is a little more noticable that i would have expected but in no way overwhelming. Certainly a stellar brew."
"I like the roasty bitterness of this brew, although there isn't much else to balance it out which detracts from the overall drinkablility. Worth a try..."
"Poured out a dark mahogany, with a foamy tan head and sticky lacing. The nose offers bittersweet dark chocolate, coffee grounds, cocoa powder, roasted malts. The taste is cocoa powder, sweet dark chocolate, big roasty flavours, licorice, burnt cocoa, coffee grounds. Mouthfeel is medium, slightly crbonated, creamy. Hides the alcohol well, and is pretty drinkable despite all the burnt and bitter flavors."
"Poured beautiful - black with a light brown one finger head. Some retention, lacey. No strong bouquet, but definitely a sense of roast malts, wine, and some sort of chemical. Appetizing and uneasy all at once. This disappeared with the first sip. Mmm.... I wish chocolate ice cream tasted this good. A little mineral bitterness, but mostly creamy oat chocolicioiusness. Yum. Felt good going down, I could drink this til I pass out on the bar. Nice job, Mass!"
"Feels a bit too thin, yet it doesn't let down the flavor. The dryness makes me wonder why this is an oatmeal stout, not very smooth."
"Drinkability - Kinda border line when it comes to a dark beer. Too roasty for me. You need to have a taste to drink these types of beer. Wasn't a bad beer to try, but I don't see myself drinking a 6 pack anytime soon."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my Imperial pint glass. Appears a dark brow, almost black, with two full fingers of creamy, tan head. Smells of raisins, roasted coffee, and burnt sugar. Tastes of deep roasted espresso, bittersweet cocoa, and burnt caramel malts. Rich and full bodied with medium carbonation. Very tasty. If you are a fan of the style, this one's highly recommended."
"A very good oatmeal stout. Quite drinkable with a great smooth taste."
"D - A really nice Oatmeal Stout in all respects, however I suspect that scaling back the alcohol might improve overall drinkability."
"Notes: Glad I picked up a six-pack of this stuff while up in Boston. Really good drinking on a cold winter night."
"This stout is so smooth it feels like you are drinking a frappe. Theres a nice assortment of complementary flavors that achieve complexity without screaming for attention. Another outstanding ale from Ipswich."
"A very nice oatmeal stout, quite drinkable. Stout fans should seek this one out."
"Overall, a well made American stout worth the trip over the border to Massachusetts."
"Nice rich coffee and chocolate roast on the flavor and aroma. Full bodied and velvety with help from the oats I suppose. It was my end of the night beer in a nice, small, smoke-free bar. I would certainly do this again. It's a shame that people are so fooled by the ever flavor-reduced international brands. I guess they're selling notions rather than damn good stout like this one and so many others."
"The alcohol was hardly detectable as I was drinking the beer but it definitely caught up to me by the end. This definitely was not one of the easier drinking oatmeal stouts I have tried, but it was one of the most interesting."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, kind of filling, but this beer is an excellent sipper."
"I would consider this beer drinkable for such a heavy brew. I would probably want to move onto something a tad more sweet or quaint after a couple of these though. Only so much char-ness and burnt flavors you can take in one sitting. This is one helluva manly stout."
"Overall a superior oatmeal stout. One of the best I have had to date. Very quaffable and a very good ABV."
"D: This is a good beer. Much more roasted than your everyday oatmeal stout yet balanced and drinkable."
"Served chilled in a pint glass. Poured an ink black with about a quarter inch of coffee brown head that instantly dissapeared. Very little lacing on the glass. Smelled of roasted nuts, fresh coffee beans, and faintly of milk chocolate. Tasted very bitterly of coffee, chocolate and dark roasted malt, with a somewhat thin , rubbery , bitter finish. Very smooth and drinkable oatmeal stout."
"Heavy as dictated by the style, well carbonated, could deliver a more creamy/frothy palate but still quite drinkable. Mercury Brewing Company continues to impress."
"Drank a lot of this last time I was in Boston/Cambridge for chaduvel's wedding. Good times. Smuggled one nice bottle into Utah. Pours a dark chocolate black with a solid inch of dark cocoa brown head. Looking good! Nose is a nice mix of roasted barley, bitter dark chocolate, and sweeter, milk chocolate candy bar. Taste follows suit, with pronounced roasted bitterness and light peatiness up front and throughout. More pronounced than a ""typical"" oatmeal stout perhaps. I don't mind this at all. I like it. Creamy, frothy, medium-full bodied feel reveals a restrained, dark chocolate sweetness mid-palate. Satisfyingly bittersweet finish that lasts a while. Very good."
"What a damn fine session oatmeal stout. Ipswich continues to blow me away with how simple and yet so tasty their brews are. Nothing that floors me, but would honestly be the first choice for any session."
"drinkability: good less the bitterness"
"I'll take another hit!"
"Richly smooth and creamy, but not heavy, so it goes down easily. Very mild carbonation, with burnt bitterness in its place. Really good beer. I didn't want it to end."
"Poured a deep dark brown, almost black, completely opaque. Head was a deep tan color. Smells of roasted coffee. The first sip has an initial bitter bite that is quickly replaced by a malty chocolatey flavor. Oat smell and taste is strong but not overpowering. The chocolate flavor is enhanced as you let the beer sit on your palate. The beer is smooth and thick. Easy to drink, best enjoyed by sipping!"
"Da. Medium. Not perfect for a stout. This a long-sipper. One or two of these would do you fine. But definitely worth getting."
"Drinkability: Quite good. Very heavy beer, but roasty and tasty and I could definitely have a few."
"thos craftsmen up at Mercury know what they're doing"
"mouthfeel - highly carbonated for a stout which i found suprising. full bodied at the same time. not the most drinkable stout i've ever had, but another very good brew from a very good local brewery."
"M & D: Mouthfeel and drinkability are both very high on this cask offering from Mercury. Love it in a bottle, love it even more on cask. Extra smooth dry finish with a full bodied well balanced beginning. I could have had at least a few of these. Mercury keeps pumping them out! One of the best breweries in New England."
"Musings: This is a very nice stout indeed. A little stronger that other oatmeals that I like, and you know it. As substantial a brew as you will find. The multilayered taste is nice - but not as complex and enjoyable as McNeill's."
"drinkability - 2 - too bitter and burnt for drinking, great for cooking - would make a nice chili or au jus"
"I drink this fine fine stout with spoot129 and wbrown, and it truly is what I think of when I think of stout. The appearance is totally opaque, with a great cremy head, smell is espresso, chocolate, malt, and that distinctive american hop bite. The taste is warm, malty, and heavy, but the hops are not obscured. The finishing taste is incredibly similar to the lingering bite of espresso. The mouthfeel is incredibly viscous and chewy, which is everything a stout should be. The drinkability I have to give a 4.5 because while it is very drinkable for the style, I have to apply force to get it into my mouth and down my throat. Its like a beer-frappe. Great stout from one of my favorite breweries."
"This pours a jet black with a large, foamy, tan head.The smell is not as strong as I would like,but it does have a coffee aroma.The taste is outstanding.Your mouth gets a blast of expresso coffee beans and then a nice malt and hop aftertaste.The m/f is heavy and very well balanced,although not as complex as other stouts.This is a great beer and I will put this high on my ""buy again"" list."
"D: If youre in the mood, or its the appropriate pairing, very good, but not an everyday drinker for me."
"Very similar to the now passed Heart of Darkness from VT, this is a solid all around beer. Not something I'd track down, but something to fall back on."
"Definitely a great winter brew. A very well done oatmeal stout."
"Man this stout is good. Dark, creamy, and richly SMOOTH. This is a real pleasure to drink."
"Most impressive is the creamy, lofty, tall brown eggshell head that compliments the opaque dark cola brew. Lace gathers slight and disappears. Small, continuous bubbles make their way to the cola surface. The nose is small relative to expectation yet big with bittersweet chocolate, coffee, burnt malts. Taste shimmers in a medium-big mouthfeel. Smooth it is not but busy with burnt malt coffee, subtle sweet. The pungency sweeps forward on the palate and lingers. A drying moment allows for the hops to express gently. Unfortunately a metallic essence challenged the tasting throughout. Not quite what I expected but good all the same."
"Ipswich's Oatmeal Stout is a hardy, rich, delicious stout. The look is black..completely opaque....one finger brown head. Real roasted malt, chocolately, dry and smoky, coffee, earthy. This is a great stout, not too boozy, very balanced. Very smoky and earthy is how I would differentiate this from other stouts. $6 for a growler at Harrington's in Chelmsford, MA! Recommended"
"Pours a dark brown to black. Beautiful caramel head forms, remains for a while. Thick consistency results in a nice lace. Smells of coffee, even a bit like chocolate. Tastes a lot like it smells: chocolate, coffee and hops. The mouthfeel is very nice, a thick, full-bodied ale that works on the palate. I feel the drinkability is low, however, due to the thickness of the beer. Be advised though: if you love stouts, you'll love this one. I prefer a lighter ale, and think this one is a bit thick."
"Drinkability and Notes  A good oatmeal stout, nothing to write home about, but few oatmeal stouts Ive had are. It has good balance, but a decent flavor, and oatmeal is good for you so grab some if you see it."
"Pours from the 12oz bottle an inky black with a coffee-colored head of about 1/2 inch that slowly dissipates. Rich nose of roasted chocolate malt, espresso, and a touch of oats. Palate is slightly sweet up front (some lactose almost like a milk stout), deepening to a full, roasted flavor of chocolate malt, coffee, oats, a faint hint of hop bitterness for balance, and the slightest touch of licorice. Nice warming sensation towards the back of the mouth. Body is rich and creamy, but lacking just a shade of the depth that would make it the perfect stout body. A good dessert beer, especially with the awesome double chocolate chunk cookie I'm enjoying it with."
"This beer is as black as black can get. Dark tan head and not a whole lot of lacing. The aroma consists of sweet malts and herbal hops. It creates an almost sour flavor to it. Very nutty and roasted flavor as well. This is a heavy beer, yet very smooth as well. The sourness creates a mouthfeel that I didn't enjoy too much. Drinkability is not that high either, I couldn't imagine stomaching more than 2 of these."
"Thanks to Carmen for the bottles!"
"Note - was awesome with a piece of chocolate cake."
"This is a stout that is not for the faint of heart. Largely bitter from heavily toasted malts, but the hop flower is not ignored. You'll see it in the aftertaste."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew, with floaties visible. Head fades down to an uneven layer of bubbles, and lacing is heavy minimal. Aroma is deep dark malts, with oatmeal presence apparent in the heartiness of it all. Taste is again all about the dark grains, with the bitterness inherent in such a product. Could have been smoothed out a bit more here. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good, but if the coffee bitterness could have balanced a bit more, it would have excelled, in my mind. Worth a try, for sure."
"Had this brew the other night, had not had anything from Mercury Brewing company before; actually this is the first time I have heard of them. Well I must say I am glad that I made the choice to give this brew a try. Brew poured to a jet dark color, Held it up to the light after my wife said that it looked like tar, no light coming through what so ever. Had a nice solid, clumpy dark tan head that had very good retention and left a nice amount of chunky lacing through out. The aroma is all about burnt malt and charcoal, chocolate, coffee and a little hop smell. The first think that I notice about this brew are the burnt malt flavors that seem to hit you up front and then I notice smooth flavors of chocolate and a oat taste. The hop taste builds and mixed with an espresso like flavor seems to be quite acidic (?) but goes well with this brew. Over all this is a fantastic brew and I am glad I stumbled on it, I must get some more of this!"
"Pours a dark brown to black with a reasonable tan head. The head settles very quickly to a sheet of lace that settles further to a streaky residue on the glass. Mild roast malt and chocolate aromas that have a black cherry accent on the finish. More of the black cherry in the flavor along with smoky hints delivered by the malt. Great velvet mouth feel and a reasonable alcohol content make this very drinkable. This is another good offering from the folks at Mercury."
"This impressive oatmeal stout pours a smooth dark brown color and produces a dark tan thin head. Definite black coffee aroma, and roasted malt in the background. Smooth and slightly nutty, very much like coffee. Mouthfeel is rich, but I want to say just a bit watery. If you don't really like the taste of coffee you probably shouldn't drink this beer, but otherwise I thought it was awesome!"
"12 ounce bottle, thanks yankeeheel."
"Cheers"
"Reflection: I am a stout lover and I am adding this one to my list of great local stouts."
"Thanks to the Felonious One for another!"
"Pours a pitch black wiht a generous sticky medium brown head. Deep, rich aromas of coffee, dark roasted malts and a mild alcohol sweetness on the nose. Powerful coffee, and bitter malts dominate the palate. Round, soft finish, thanks to the oats. Mouthfeel is good, but dry and slightly bitter on the finish. Overall, a very nice, easy-drinking dry stout. Nice job. Worth a try for sure if you find this one."
"It poured from the bottle a deep brown in color with a decent head for a bottle pour. The aroma is of haevy malts and oats. The mouthfeel is very rich and heavy on the tongue. The taste at first is of a typical stout, but there is a slight hops kick with the finish. The aftertaste made me think of blueberry, but very ripe and dark blueberries."
"Pours very very black, forming a little rich brown colored head. The smell of roasted malt, a little coffee and vanilla. The taste is classic stout at first, but then there are bitter hops. I was not a fan of the bitter hops, they left an astringent flavor in my mouth. Definitely presents of coffee flavors are in there. The mouth feel is good, more ale style than a pub style. The drinkability is average for me because I could have one maybe two of these per night, the bitter hops really turned me off."
"Very drinkable given the style. This is one that I'd keep in stock at all times. It's an amazing tasting oatmeal stout and one that never gets old. A gem!"
"Missing something, but very good stout."
"I am really enjoying this Oatmeal Stout. I had a growler of this beer several years ago, but I don't remember it being this good. Very enjoyable."
"Wow! What a beer! Thanks to wyllder for this one. This was one of the best I've ever had. Pours black as night...real thick and creamy. Beautiful foamy brown head. Smells great!! Complex body of roasted nuts, chocolate, and espresso comes wafting out of the glass. This brew is mighty tasty! Pefectly balanced malts, a hint of sweetness, nutiness, and a brush of an alcohol finish that leaves you wanting more. Drinkability: Are you kidding me? I had to force myself to only drink one...at a time! This is a great beer. If you can get it, buy it. Buy all of it and enjoy it."
"Wyll-"
"Beer is good. Happy dark beering."
"Black, largely opaque, there is only a slight dark brown highlight. Ideal color. A light brown head of two fingers in height stylishly topped off the beer. The head retention was excellent; a firm, foamy cap lasted for a long while, almost for the entire consumption. The subsequent lacing was sporadic and webby. One sniff and the beer said, Im an Oatmeal Stout dummy! Is there an aroma better on earth then a perfectly crafted Oatmeal Stout? I think not. Succulent sweetness from the oats blends effortlessly with chocolate notes. The chocolate is absolutely lovely! A bit of modestly roasted coffee beans and a kiss of milky sweetness that finds a home with a return of the chocolate. The potency is very sturdy. Inviting. The palate is astringent upfront with more burnt flavors than the nose let on. How sneaky! The hops seem more playful too, herbal and modestly bitter. The sweetness of the oats is a little too soft. The chocolate flavors are more bittersweet than anything. Regardless this is a tasty Oatmeal Stout, it is plenty hearty with subtle graceful qualities. The finish is long, more bitter then many Oatmeal Stouts (a nod to its heartiness); there is also a sweetness then dances with modest chocolate flavors. It is simply lovely. Medium-full in body with modestly low but natural carbonation. The mouthfeel is very pleasant and filling. I really liked this beer, it was much bigger than any Oatmeal Stout Ive had, maybe this is not traditional but it is very tasty and damn drinkable. Thank you drweizen for the bottle in the BIF 5 package!"
"Thanks yankeeheel"
"If you like beer, and you like oatmeal stouts, and you aren't allergic to yeast, alcohol, or malt, then I bet you will like this fine midnight black stout. The taste is a great blend of chocolate, hops, and espresso with many other flavors that keeps me coming back for more. The texture is smooth and creamy with lively yet not overwhelming carbonation. Must drink more..."
"We drink this one a lot. It has a predominant smoky flavour of burnt coffee and yeast. The nose is sweet, like burnt sugar or toffee. It has good carbonation, is medium to heavy bodied and is for sale at the local packy (at least it was when we lived in MA). Honestly, this is a good example of an oatmeal stout IMO."
"A mediocre head when poured yielding an opaque black in color.The head had a coffee color.The aroma was all burnt or roasted malt.Very sweet on the finish.Had like a milk stout finish.The finish was also dry leaving a hop bitterness,coffee taste,and hints of roasted grains.I think this is the first Oatmeal Stout I've ever had so I cannot relate it to anything.Hops become more noticed after a few sips.A good thickness and not watered down which makes for a great stout.Full bodied and also easy on the mouthfeel.Creamy with a slight carbonated bite to it.Leaves a lingering burnt malt and coffee taste in the mouth.I'd prefer one of these to a Guinness anyday when drinking Stouts.Rings of spotty lace left after each sip.A bready aroma is noted."
"ng"
"On tap at Redbones. One of those dark as night pours, the head was gone so fast, I didn't get a good glimpse. Chocolate brownie meets espresso aroma is huge. Taste is similar to all dark roast, with some 70% dark chocolate in the finish. Sheet lacing left through-out the glass. Mouthfeel was a good medium and rather chewy."
"Easily one of my favorite oatmeal stouts, if not my top pick. Nothing weak or restrained about this beer, this is oatmeal stout for serious stout drinkers. If this beer was a person, it would have a huge beard, lots of scars and carry an axe at all times."
"This is a deep, dark, opaque black colour with a rich, dense, head of beige/tan foam. The aromas are all roasty/toasty with hints of dark fruits, rich roasted malts, caramel, chocolate, coffee, and more. The taste is quite smokey, boozy, roasty/toasty, and dry. The mouthfeel is medium bodied>thick with a lovely finish, and the drinkability is superb!"
"Thanks to PBrian for this stout."
"One of the best brews from New England in my opinion."
"This beer pours a tenebrous, nearly black color with a medium thick light brown head. Head retention is not great and the lacing is good. The aroma is very roasty coffee and grain. Rich and satisfyingly tasty, with a pleasing blend of coffee, malt, and chocolate. There is an underlying faint sweetness throughout as well. The deceptively bitter finish kind of worms its way in. The hops are enough to keep this beer very drinkable. Overall I enjoyed this one."
"IMHO, Ipswich makes some really fine brews, and this one is up at the top rung of excellence. Apppearance was almost black with a big creamy head. Coffee and malt aromas are strong and balanced betwen the two. Taste was excellent...as with the smell, coffee and malt flavors were very prominent and blended. Hop element became evident in the aftertaste and further complemented the overall experience. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, and drinkability was good, with a decent smooth quality."
"black with a thin brown head that lessens with a little time. chocolatey and coffee like aromas dominate, slight licorice and fruit aromas as well. dry chocolate and coffee dominates the taste as well, but to better effect than the smell, grainy, slightly buttery, toasted sometimes burnt flavors with a more hops biting at the end than expected, contributing to the dryness. some smoky qualities in both aroma and taste. nice clean mouthfeel for a stout like this. a really nice stout, thats very drinkable due in part to it's nice clean finish."
"The head was small, but was that hot chocolate foam color and consistency that just drives me wild. Body was appropriately dark, even with only two sips left in the glass, it remained opaque except at the edges. Sweet, roasty aroma. A bit of burned marshmallows in the flavor. Hops noticeable but not overbearing, but give the beer a slight metallic flavor."
"The head is modest in size, frothy in texture and a nice chocolate color, the lace forms a nice covering for the glass. Sweet chocolate, coffee, and the marvelous aroma of roasted grain make up the crisp, fresh and clean nose; start is thickly malt, ambrosial and the top rich and full in its feel to the palate. Finish is devastatingly acidic, the hops powerful in their bite, but pleasing to the palate, aftertaste bitter-sweet chocolate dry, a fine beer from a fine brewery, that I see only rarely these days and this bottle was a gift from UncleJimbo, on his recent Whirlwind tour of Phoenix, Sky Harbor Air Port, McDowell Road, and Papago Brewery."
"The smell is more coffee and malt than anything. Hints of chocolate and toffee come through. At first taste, it reminds me off a Robust Porter. Great depth of flavor. A gentle balance of coffee, malt and hops. This is a perfect beer for my night cap."
"Taste is bitter and sweet and oaty. This beer screams oatmeal stout from 6 miles away. Smoky bitter finish. Quite a complex beer. Sweet and bitter with a bit of sourness. Grainy (oaty) but strangely smooth and tasty. Flavors linger on the roof of your mouth forever. It's like drinking a cigar. The flavors are bold and strong. This beer is just damn good. I only wish I could get more of it where I live. A definite must try if you are in MA."
"Served on draft, the Ipswich Oatmeal is quite black and opaque in color, with a moderate lingering brown head. Roasted malt is most prevalent in the aroma, accompanied with scents of coffee and oats. Taste is right on par with the nose, surprisingly roasty with more subltle oatmeal flavor than other oat stouts and definitive cofeeish undertones. Body is fairly full, and finish is fairly dry, leaving a slight toasted malt aftertaste..."
"Big thanks to Xgrigorix for the bottle!"
"Opaque black with generous light brown head. Raisin, coffee, chocolate and toffee notes in the nose. Bittersweet malt flavors with mild flavors of oats and lactose and some . Slightly astringent and complex. Lingering sweet & burnt flavor in the aftertaste. Very nice oatmeal stout. A meal in itself."
"If you like stouts I strongly encourage you to try this one. It is packed with flavor and quite enjoyable."
"Overall this is a nice brew."
"Big thanks to Johnny P for the privledge of drinking this..."
"A man's beer. It's about as dark as Hell when the fires go out and as bitter as the most unpopular kid in school. This is the first Ipswich I've tried and I can't say I was expecting much. But I was surprised by a very burnt, almost smokey taste, and a thick, sweet finish--almost coffee-esque. Chalk up another New England-brewed winner. I guess I'm fortunate to live here."
"Dark dark black with a thin fading dark tan head. Smell is roasted, earthy and a hint of dark chocolate. Smell does not prepare me for the taste. Intense roasted dark coffee bean flavors. Incredibly smooth, and although the bitter chocolate and coffee flavors are intense the phenomenal smoothness mellows and leaves a roasted, toasted bread flavor on the palate. One heck of a beer."
"drink up.."
"Pours a wonderful black with a big beautiful brown head. Amoung the most visually appealing stouts I've glanced at. Roasty smoke flavor is quite strong. Hints of coffee linger. D'oh! Malt sweetness is there, as is hop bitters. Quite a balanced brew. Leave it to Ipswitch to surpass all expectations. This is a quality oatmeal stout that any fan of the style will enjoy."
"Edited on 12/13/05"
"Thick and creamy smooth. Delicious."
"Edit 1/12/04: After much further product testing I have to go back and give this a 5 for taste. It simply crushes most other stouts I've tried."
"Dar, dark mahogany color with a dark brown foamy head. Smells of nice roasted malt, with a bit of hop bitterness coming through. Mouthfeel is round and full as the roasted malt rushes over the tongue. Also nuances of chocolate and coffee. Hints of hop bitterness linger in the back of the throat. Very smooth, pleasant, and balanced flavor that keeps its rich character until the last drop."
"Thanks go to UncleJimbo for passing along the bottle."
"Poured a inky black with brownish edges and almost no head whatsoever. Pretty heavy, viscous consistency. Cocoa was the dominant aroma, with hints of coffee and a slight hop scent. The tastebuds were also treated to the chocolate malt flavors, which was balanced by the bittering of the hops. Mouthfeel was a little high in carbonation, which caused this stout to feel a little watery. the bitterness in the aftertaste was also a little overdone. Otherwise this is a very good example of the style, and I will buy it again (probably in the 1/2 gallon bottle instead of the 6 pack!)"
"This stout poured very dark brown (almost black) with brown foam that settled rather quickly and did not leave much lace. The smell was very nice and long lasting: sweet and malty, with oatmeal, coffee, and bitter chocolate. The taste was rich and full with flavors of roasted malt, chicory, coffee and bitter chocolate. The mouthfeel was smooth and full bodied with low-medium carbonation. There was a pleasant aftertaste of oatmeal, bitter chocolate and hops. This was a very enjoyable stout. Take time to savor it."
" Outstanding Oat Stout. BIG on roast grain and oat character. Yes, Beer IS for breakfast."
"A very nice stout, well-balanced and smooth, yet just a little robust in terms of the burnt, roasted flavors for my tastes."
"Pours black as night with no moon or clouds. Slowly appearing head quickly vanishes. Coffee, chocolate, and and fighting malt duel for supremecy in the nose of this drink and quite fulfill in taste. Unfortunately there is no born on date and I can tell right away... I got an older version of a beer that should be obtained fresh, fresh, fresh. Still a tasty stout, full of rich roasted malt flavor and a mediating hop. A little bitter on the rebound, would be great with a meal!"
"This stout poured from a ½ gallon growler deep black with highlights of red-brown. The head was tan and dissipated quickly leaving little trace on the glass. The aroma was full of roasted and black malt with hints of alcohol. The taste is rich and malty at the start. The finish is dry and bitter with the roasted barley coming to the front. The aftertaste is long and pleasant with the roasted malt bitterness blending with flavors of coffee, oats, and hops. The oats give this stout a nonastringent mouthfeel that rolls off your tongue quite nicely without that charcoal sting. All in all a very nice oatmeal stout that good year round. The growler seems to be the more complex and flavorful recipe than that of the 12oz. bottle recipe."
"This is my favorite beer. Absolutely black with a nice head. Exceptionally smooth on the palate with very noticeable coffee and chocolate. I could drink this stuff all day. My father, who is a Sam Adams fanatic, and not really into stouts, has become a stout-a-holic because of Ipswich."
"Made the great mistake of buying the growler. As I poured it I noticed it blocks out light better than an eclipse. Dark and rich are an understatement. Rich roasted chocolate taste hit my palatte as I dink this. This is my second favorite stout after Smuttynose Black Cat Stout. I am determined to find this on tap."
"A Bighuge thanks to pbrian for the excellent sample of one of my top 5-10 styles of beer."
"Notes: This is one stout I cant get enough of, one of the most drinkable full bodied ales I have run into in a long time. A treat for any die hard stout fan especially if you enjoy oatmeal stouts."
"Pours absolutely black with a nice thick brown head that slowly fades away.  Smell is all chocolate and coffee, huge chocolate aromas dominate.  Taste starts off very dark chocolatey and slowly fades into a nice dark roasted coffee flavor that linger o the tongue for a good amount of time.  The brew is a little thin for an oatmeal and that is the only thing that is holding this brew back.  Extremely drinkable.  A great brew that is just a little short of being absolutely stellar.  Another good one from Ipswich.  Thanks to the Bierman for the brew."
"Good dark head, strong oatmeal nose.  Starts out with a sweet malty taste but gradually goes to a slightly hoppy finish.  Very dark and chewy - a good oatmeal"
"This is a superb meal, I mean oatmeal stout.  The deep roasted flavors are balanced beautifully with a nice hop kick and a wonderful silky mouthfeel.  Nicely done."
"Very smooth with a pleasant, almost perfect balance of grain and ripe fruity sweetness and coffee and subtle hop bitterness. A top notch brew. Took home a growler after a pint at the local."
"Now this is my kind of stout. A stout with some actual flavour going on."
"I think i found a new favourite stout."
