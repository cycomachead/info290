"Pours a clear, deep brown having a garnet hue at the edges when held to the light, producing 2+ fingers of tan, shortlived, foamy head that leaves a stringy wash of thin lace. Aroma is led by rich dark coffee followed closely by deeply roasted malt & nuts in a background that hints of woody vanilla, chocolate, molasses & a faint touch of dark fruit. Taste is less robust than the nose: coffee & roast, dark malts, hints of char, dark unsweetened cocoa & cola. The lightly dry finish exhibits char, unsweetened cocoa & low cola like sweetness. Aftertaste is dry, bitter chocolate, roast & a more exaggerated burnt note than in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, low-moderate carbonation, creamy but not as chewy as expected from the oats, with a light prickly bite beginning at midsip and lasting through the finish."
"TASTE: Very smooth, almost silky, creamy, chewy medium body, fresh coffee overtones, dried grass, mild chocolate, hint of alcohol, black currants, moderate hopping, balance bitterness, roasted finish"

"O:  Excellent non-imperial stout."
"Lives just miles away from the source. Bent River Brewery. Best oatmeal coffee stout imo. Can't get enough. Love it"

"O (4) - I had had this beer in the fridge for a while, and finally got around to drinking it.  It was a solid beer, very respectable.  Didn't blow me away in any category, but good all around."

"Roasted malts are evident. Very watery for an oatmeal stout."

"12oz into a mug.  Wow - the coffee aroma is huge.  Taste is a bit too much coffee, actually.  This is almost like drinking coffee.  Maybe more oatmeal and roasted malt would help round out this beer.  I feel like I should mix this with another stout..."

"just don't like the coffee flavor of this at all"

"Very good!  Best coffee beer that I'm aware of in the Midwest region.  Just as good by the 6 pack bottle as it is by the jug from the brewery.  Coffee connoisseurs this is the coffee beer for you!"

"Good beer definitely get that iced coffee taste with it. Wouldn't complain if it was a little thicker. Good nose chocolate and coffee"

"O: Very good beer. I dont delve much into stouts, especially coffee stouts, but I must say this is the absolute best coffee stout I have had to date. I have heard their Java Stout is better, but I will reserve judgement until I try it at a later date."
"Overall an excellent oatmeal stout and it's always great to support local!"

"truly a beauty, and from a brewery i never heard of before this one, its a real pleasant surprise. dark brown pushing black, shiny but not letting hardly any light in, the head is an inch high, settles but keeps stiff peaks like well beaten eggs. great nose too, coffee and roasted unmalted barley meet right in the middle, with the coffee taking the lead on the taste. i get a little sweetness to this, although i dont think its a milk stout, it just has that sweet body and lingering finish, a fantastic medium to transfer these flavors, early bitter coffee, but more balanced than most of its peers. its still a beer, yet the coffee does something unique to this. fresh brewed coffee all the way though, i love how the carbonation rises up at the end and crisps up a medium bodied finish. soft and delicate in feel, but about as robust as they come in terms of flavor. the use of coffee here is as good as any. while the base beer is great and distinct, i think the use of coffee rivals the best in the business, the very best. my first beer from bent river had my palate wet for many more. love this."

"12 oz. Bottle. Not sure if I got a bad batch or what but when I pour this beer into a glass the head is, for lack of a better word, unmanageable. Takes 10 minutes for the head to die down. So it takes a long time from opening this beer until the time I get to drink any. The head itself tastes like an ashtray-not indicative of the taste of the beer. The beer itself has nice roasted coffee flavor but a little too thin for my liking. It's just ok."

"Poured 12 oz bottle into snifter. It has a cola look and smelled like cheap coffee. Smell is overpoweringly coffee. I did not really taste beer in this at all. Rather, it tasted like cold Folgers. It didn't taste like it was brewed with coffee. It tasted like someone poured a little bit of stout into stale coffee. I won't be trying again."

"O - pretty pedestrian coffee stout. Good, but nothing extraordinary."
""
""
""
"I poured this promising beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer poured a black looking brew with a tan head. The head did not last very long at all. The beer mostly tasted like coffee, cold coffee, cold heavy coffee with a handful of sugar thrown in it. It was cold coffee to me and not beer. I will not buy again."

"O: Really enjoyed this beer. A well balanced flavor that complemented the aroma."

"Sampled last night on 9/18/13. Chilled down to 36 degrees in my beer cooler and poured into a brandy snifter glass from a local brewery. Pours black in color with a very small thin tan head. LOTS of lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma of fresh black espresso coffee hits you right up front with some roasted malt. The taste is pretty much as would be expected with the smell. Black coffee with a hop finish BUT not overpowering at all. This is a great sipping brew and not a 'chugging' type of beer. Overall, a great ""Oatmeal Stout with coffee added"" brew."

"Overall, I'd buy a six pack! This definitely rivals Speedway Stout."

"Notes of deep chocolate and coffee with a little pine. Really, really, really yummy stout flavor -- one of the best domestic stouts I've ever sampled. Mouthfeel leaves a stouty soul wanting; there should be much thicker body here. Mouthfeel somewhat oily. Still, yummy as hell. The middle of the pint is ripe with deep malt flavors. Would totally drink again, many times."
""
"My god, this is one of the best smelling coffee stouts on earth; it smells like a fantastic cup of dark chocolate with coffee. The flavor is a much, much subdued version of this. BUT, don't get me wrong, this tastes good. It's a bit on the thin end of stouts, but nothing too far out of whack. Quite solid."
""
""
""
"Overall: a very good Illinois beer. Fans of heavy stouts will definitely like this one."
"Had on tap at Bistro 101. Very rich coffee taste, was very smooth. Smells like what I would expect from a oatmeal stout. Has an appealing color from the tap. Head was thick and foamy but was not abundant. Has a great mouthfeel. Overall I enjoyed it and would gladly have another pint."

"Highly complex, well balanced and drinkable. One of the best oatmeal, coffee stout I have tasted."

"Drinkability: I was a little leery of buying this because I had never seen Bent River beer bottled and was concerned there would be packaging issues. However, this is decent enough out of the bottle to make me want to have a draft."

"Flavor is big on coffee, mellow and roasty malts, and is smooth and light bodied. Light lingering bitterness from the coffee i'd guess. Wholesome and satisfying, equal parts roast malt and bitter coffee, hints of dark chocolate, smooth and integrated feel. Seemingly simple, yet well crafted and enjoyable. Definitely something to see out, a solid coffee stout from Bent River."

"This beer (and Bent River's Jalapeno brew) were the two beers that got me hooked onto microbrews, from the generic, everyday beers that I was accustomed to. I can't help but to stop into Bent River and have at least one pint of Uncommon every time I happen to find myself in the Moline area."
"As stated, this is a coffee beer. Very coffee, not just a little. So if you don't like coffee, don't drink it. My advice is try it if you can, because if you can, you are probably in the Quad Cities and your options are limited. And some batches seem to hit the spot. And, as an annual visitor, the brewery seems to be getting a grip on the Quality Control and achieving more consistency with their flagship beers, of which this is one."

"I have enjoyed coffee stouts in the past, but this one was a bit too one-dimensional for repeated tastings. Judging from the other higher scores, I may have had a bad pour, but I don't think so."
"Notes: I first had this beer shortly after I turned 21. It was one of the first stouts I had (other than Guinness) and helped expand my concept of what beer can be. I thought ""coffee in beer, that's crazy!", but ended up enjoying it. I don't care for coffee itself, so I knew there must be something special about it. Close to two years later, it still holds up as an excellent stout. With the coffee and oatmeal flavors, I can't help but compare it to Founders Breakfast Stout, one of my favorite beers. I'd label it Breakfast Stout's baby brother, but that's still high praise!"
"This beer is for coffee lovers. The Uncommon Stout is very similar to the Oatmeal Stout (in fact, it is their Oatmeal Stout infused with coffee). I thought I could detect a coffee flavor in the Oatmeal Stout, and then I tried the Uncommon. The coffee flavoring completely dominates the beer. That isn't bad as long as you like coffee. I personally enjoyed the Oatmeal Stout better, but this is a good beer too. Get Bent!"
"This is a great beer to drink when you are eating a sweeter baked items, like muffins or rolls."
"I find it odd that Bent River doesn't inject the word 'Coffee' or 'Mocha' or 'Java' into the name. The one they settled on is still appropriate, though, since Uncommon Stout is uncommonly good. I now plan to 'Get Bent' whenever the opportunity presents itself."
"This beer is a treat. While the coffee was dominant in the flavor and aroma, it did not overpower the roasted malt, chocolate or hop presence. I was pleasantly surprised by the balance in flavors that it displayed. I was also amazed that a beer with such outstanding flavor and body could be so drinkable."
"One heck of a brew pub stout. I'm a bit of a sucker for a nice, strong coffee stout, so I might be a little biased here, but I'd certainly endorse a trip to Bent River for this beer alone!"
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and smooth with a slight creamy aspect. Not overly heavy, but still had enough to make itself known. Even in the oppresively hot sun this was still tasty. I'm hoping to try it again sometime and I could see myself having a few. If you enjoy coffee stouts I'd say give this one a go!"
"Thats pretty much a big ol coffee beer alll right. Big aroma of roasted coffee, fortunately not too bitter. Clearly the fact that its one of BRs regular brews has meant theyve kept working on it. The brewmaster told me hes had some business types slam three or four pints of this the night before a big presentation, then call back to complain that they couldnt get to sleep at all. So he makes sure everybody knows that this not a ""coffee roast malt"" beer; this is a beer with lots of coffee in it! And its pretty tasty, too."
"Drinkability was fine, I just expect a little more substance from a stout."
