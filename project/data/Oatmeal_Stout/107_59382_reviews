"Overall : I'd have it again, and for what a six pack goes for ($8.99 around here), it's worth a grab. The total lack of head really started out this journey a bit rocky down the back road, but by the end the ride smoothed out and it's a pretty decent brew overall."

"Nearly opaque dark brown with moderate chocolate cream head. Moderate to light body for stout. Deep roasty chocolate notes with slightly acidic palate. Decent, but I like more body and less acidity in my stouts."

"Awesome stout for the price, at 7.99 a six pack you can't go wrong. Great Beer! Very Impressed with Iowa Brews"
"Prune, coffee and grain on the nose. Pours bright black under a 1” finely bubbled tan foam cap. The palate starts with grain, chocolate, light coffee, and fruit. The roast is fairly mild and the beer starts with a little sweetness but dries out with a hint of sour on the finish. Above average carbonation and a medium full body. Very easy to drink."

"The smoothness the style is known for is achieved in this beer, with little roast coming from dryness but having enough heft and just enough of a drier aspect to give it the balance and character it needs."
""
""

"This felt more like a dry stout to me. It's packed with dark, welcoming warmth. Plenty of roasted character in the smell and taste and it finishes with a complex offering of delicate malt sweetness and dry hop bitterness and feel. Very nicely done."

"A lighter stout than I expected. Nice deep roast color, with a nice tan head. I predominately tasted coco powder and the oat meal. It's not a ""sweet"" stout by any means. It is light, and leaves a very mild aftertaste on your tongue. I almost taste a fruitiness I can't place after I swallow. A good stout if you're looking something that isn't thick and rich feeling."

"Pours a very dark brown/almost black in color with just a thing beige head seen. Spotty lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma is of dark roasted malts, black coffee with a hint of chocolate. The taste is actually even better with the roasted malts/coffee coming right though that ends with a slight chocolate finish. No bitter or harsh finish on this one! Goes down very easy and is very enjoyable to drink."

"Overall a smooth, creamy and mellow brew that is easy to drink. I like this one. My first taste of Millstreet. Great job."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, although there are others in the style that I would choose first, this is still a solid beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."
"O: sweeter than I'd optimally like but the alcohol moderates. An ok brew."

"Up in Wyoming, MN on business. I always like to try what is local. I was very pleasantly pleased with this beer. Never heard of Millstream Brewing Co. Very good flavor. Nice aroma. Good head retention. Nice color. Smooth, slight sweetness. Good blending of flavors. I'm going to have another."
""
""
"Overall: Tried this on a whim because I like supporting local breweries. I think it’s a good first attempt at the style. I was pleasantly surprised at the flavors. Just wish the texture/mouthfeel was a little more substantial."
""
"Overall --- I figured I would give this one a shot, and was pleasantly surprised. The smell is fairly strong & extremely nice, leaving me to want a bit more from the taste I felt. I would say this is an above average oatmeal stout that I would recommend to anyone that could possibly find/come across it. Millstream did such a good job with their version of it, that I am now curious about their other offerings. I know what I will keep an eye out for, the next time I visit Iowa."
"O: Reasonably decent brew that I am glad I got a chance to try."
"Overall a nice example of an oatmeal stout, I'd buy it again."
""
""
""
"A simple but excellent oatmeal stout, perfectly balanced."
""
""
"D/O- All in all, goes down pretty easily with a few off flavors present in the nose and mouth. Not something I'd recommend but not terrible either."
"This beer pours a very dark brown almost black color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of roasted malt, burnt malt, and hints of dark chocolate. The taste is similar to the aroma, but a bit stronger. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with appropriately mild carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a nice stout that I would be happy to drink again."
"O: A rock solid effort, that is great for what it is. Needs a bit more complexity to be a world class beer though."
"Overall- A very good stout. Easy drinking, balanced, and refreshing. A great way to introduce your Guiness drinker to the wider world of stouts."
"Notes: Slightly thin mouthfeel, although this beer does have some body. Flavors are balanced. Overall a decent oatmeal stout, but not one that I would seek out time after time."
"Goes down well with a nice dose of Paul Bley solo piano music or Pink Floyd. Take your pick."
""
""
""
""
"O- It's a perfectly fine beer, but not a beer that I'm likely to remember. Fairly tasty but relatively pedestrian."
"4/5 Mouthfeel is almost medium or maybe medium. Fairly nice mouthfeel for a stout with a low ABV like this. It's not an imperial stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"Thanks to Crass3000 for this one!"
""
"I gave this a 4.5 overall and 4.0 for smelll taste and mouthfeel but 4.5 on appearance. Overall I really like this. I will probably not be able to drink this again until I, if, ever come back to Amana. If you come to Amana visit the colonies and visit Millstream. They have a lot of other beers for you to try also. THe place has a sample bar as well as a sitting room. You can watch the brewery there. Give this one a try next time ur in Amana Iowa or order it."

"Smooth to drink, which is not surprising for an oatmeal stout. Medium bodied with average carbonation and a bitter finish. I have had better oatmeal stouts, but am always glad to try each oatmeal stout I can find. Worth trying if you have the chance."
"Overall- This is a solid stout in all categories. The biggest draw back is the mouth feel that doesn't quite get it done. And it was a little bit of a let down that the complexity of the nose doesn't translate as well to the palate."
"D - 3.5"
"O: Very pleased with this one. Good flavor and interesting profile. After an afternoon of raking leaves, this is really hitting the spot. Will definitely buy again."
"This is a good stout. I'm liking stouts more, and more. Give this a try!"
"Overall-nice representation of the style and well done. This was one I’d drink again, recommended."
"Poured into,my New Belgium globe. This beer pours a viscous black with a decent 3 inch tan head that quickly turns into a ring around the outside of the glass. No lacing sticks around on the glass. The aroma is astringent coffee mixed with bitter sweet chocolate. The flavor profile is much the same. Bakers chocolate mixed with astringent coffee. Just a little molasses. The mouthfeel is fairly dry. Has a coco-esque dryness. I was expecting something a bit more creamy. Not your normal oatmeal stout. Overall, its. Good beer but nothing crazy. I would have liked it to,be just a bit ceeamier."
"Pours black color with a tan head that thinned to a layer leaving little bits of lacing. Smells of roasted coffee and malt aromas. it has a roasted malty taste, burnt, bitter black coffee flavor on the finish. This beer was medium body and silky smooth. It was a perfect sessionable stout, a nice surpise here."
"O - Average, has a couple things going for it and a couple that aren't. Sum of the parts is something some will like and some will pass on in favor of more exotic beers."
"This stout is surprisingly refreshing without compromising much of the taste. It's roasty and smooth. Overall, I am fairly impressed. It's a good lighter bodied stout. I just prefer more body and creaminess."
"D: This is just a good beer, and I'm quite happy with that."
"This is a very well crafted oatmeal stout. Nice flavor and the feel is textbook for the style. It's also a very drinkable beer. I would have this one again."
"I would pass on this in the future."
"Overall, a very enjoyable stout & one I would seek out again the next time I'm in Iowa."
"D- Decent offering. For some reason I didn't like the first few drinks but after that it was pretty good. Good full flavor."
"Millstream is not trying to innovate here. They seem to be committed to making solid, traditional beers for a very local consumer base. If that's what the people of Amana, Iowa want then Millstream seems up to the task of fulfilling that desire. Back Road Stout is a simple reminded that ""basic"" beers are still something worth appreciating."
"Overall, delectable. Goes great in place of afternoon tea & cookies."
"Drinkability: A solid stout and right down my alley. Loads of body and rich chocolate and coffee sensations. This one deserves a place on the mantel, dear."
"Drinkability - Yeah, not feeling this. The metallic taste is just so distracting I can't enjoy this beer. My drinking it now reminds me that this is how the beer tasted a year ago and age did not improve this (that is why I didn't review it then - I wanted to let it sit for a bit). Oh well...a swing and a miss."
"Taste, definitely chewy, and the alcohol was no longer as omniprescient (sic) as it was in the aroma. Came off as smooth. More coffee and caramel to it than chocolate. The mouthfeel did develop a little more bitterness than usual with the use of oats, but I guess when you have a coffee feel, you're gonna get some bitterness usually."
"Notes: A nice easy to drink stout with plenty of nice stout flavors. Not overly bitter, nor overly complex, but well balanced and tasty. This is a very nice, basic, easy to drink stout. Not outstanding, but good."
"OK, the label is confusing the shit out of me. It looks like a guy putting the moves on grandma at a barn picnic while the dog is watching. WTF is going on in that picture?!"
"Very solid. I would definitely drink it again."
"M/D: Pretty drinkable I suppose, smooth mouth feel - very slick."
"D: Very drinkable. ABV is probably 4 - 5%, making this crushable. The flavor is good but I'd like to see just a little something else... something light to boost the complexity a bit."
"D: The richness could limit the amount consumed, but overall quite nice for an oatmeal stout."
"The taste has a grain and oil mix upfront combined with chocolate. The middle presents a subtle chocolate, giving way to more deep roasted grains and a little coffee. The finish is smooth, dry, and a little bitter from the almost burnt grain flavor. Another good beer I wish was available in Chicagoland, but alas...."
"Pours a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some nice little chocolate/toffee/caramel notes. The taste follows the nose pretty much, with some nice sweetness. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice brew."
"This one's got good flavor, but it's not too well rounded, falls into the realm of average."
"D: a nice easy drinking stout with some nice flavors, I prefer my stouts to have a little more body"
"Tastes of roasted malt, coffee, toffee, caramel, a hint of vanilla and mocha flavors; slight hint of grains, which I assume to be the oatmeal. A very malty and enjoyable stout for those who like coffee since the roasted malt flavor dominates this brew. Has a grainy feel to it where the malt/oatmeal almost feel like it's leaving a residue, yet it's a dry finish. Good tasty stout that goes down easy, like water. It's worth trying this beer."
"Drinkability - 3.0/5.0 - I have a number of other oatmeal stouts that I would rather have. If offered, I would drink again, but not my first choice."
"I rather enjoyed this one - even trying to put the hometown bent aside, I found this to be a very quality beer."
"Well-played, Millstream."
"BOM from June 2009. Poured into a pint glass this brew has a slick oil like color with a thick creamy off white head that dissipated quickly and did not leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma was of chocolate and some sweet raisin. Mild malts and some yeast. The taste falls flat and is not as bold as the aroma would lead you to believe. This is an ok stout, but I have had better."
"This beer was served with a nice transparent black/dark red hue. It was not cloudy, and had a off white head. The first one tasted of the darkest chocolate and coffee I had ever tasted. The second sweetened up slightly with more of an herb character. It was a very smooth beer but not to the extent of some lagers and lighter ales, keeping an adequate mouth feel. I don't know why the first one tasted different but I preferred the first. the second beer I had was probably closer to the actual taste of the beer. Overall good beer, I will continue to drink this one wile getting used to the really dark beers."
"D - Pretty decent oatmeal stout. Don't love it yet certainly wouldn't turn it down if offered to me."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. Poured the color of cola with a half inch khaki-colored head that crackled and popped as it slowly dissipated into a fairly solid, quarter inch skim. Nose is fairly subdued, but suggests molasses, brown sugar and a hint of acidic, dark fruit in the back. Taste follows nose, but there's also a slightly metallic quality towards the back. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied and a little overly effervescent for the style - a little watery and somewhat lacking in consistency. Decent brew, but some of the qualities are a bit off-style. Its not a bad brew, but not what I expect in an oatmeal stout."
"All in all not a bad beer, I've had worse but I've had better."
"Pours black with an amber color along the bottom of the glass. 1/4 inch head of a tan color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of roasted malt, oatmeal, sweet malt, and slight hops. Fits the style of an Oatmeal Stout. Mouth feel is coarse and sharp with a high carbonation level. There is also a strong bitterness associated with the roasted malt. Tastes of roasted malt up front, slight hop background, sweetness of the oatmeal, and slight coffee in the finish. Overall, a pretty good oatmeal stout. The bitterness level is too high and the head retention is negligent, though."
"Overall- Crisp, clean, and chock full of flavors. A solid Oatmeal Stout."
"Mouthfeel is a little too carbonated for an oatmeal stout. Not as creamy as I would have liked, but not harsh either. Flavor is of mild roasted cocoa, some bready malts, and some faint bitterness. All in all this is a pretty average beer. Not bad, but not that great."
"Thanks to akokandy for hooking me up with a couple bottles of this. I've knocked another state of my list."
"The beer is black with a nice tan head. It has a sweet and a bit roasty character to the aroma, but there isn't much else apart from that. The taste is quite different. Maybe the fact that it is aparently lagered according to the bottle? It is definitley very sweet and estery. It also has a nice bitterness to it as well. It is not as full bodied as i would have liked it to be and it has pretty good drinkablility."
"D - easy to drink."
"D: Very drinkable. The lager yeast really makes the beer more drinkable."
"I would recommend this stout to friends."
"Why is this beer lagered? I feel like bottle conditioning an ale would have produced a great complexity and more even-keeled mouthfeel. Not bad overall though."
"Overall: Thanks go out to BuckeyeNation for this generous hook up. The bottle says "" Colony Oatmeal Stout Lager"" That makes absolutely no sense, but whatever. This beer was good. Not like a life changing beer, but definately drinkable, and worth drinking again."
"Pours a solid black with a thin mocha head that dissipates quickly. Smells of roast, chocolate, and licorice. Taste is quite roasty, some bitterness in the middle and a lingering coffee roast in the finish. Smooth creamy mouthfeel. Medium body. Ample carbonation. This is a great little stout. Simple for what it is, but highly sessionable. I enjoyed this one immensely. On a side note, the bottle claims that this is a lager, I wonder if that is true."
"Thanks, BuckeyeNation, for the opportunity"
"D - Good stuff! Nothing to complain about here. This smooth drinking stout does everything right an nothing wrong. I like the cookie dough ice cream notes...I don't think I've ever mentioned that in any other review."
"Pours a dark, dark brown that appears black in the glass with mahogany tints around the edges. The head is small but dense and fades quickly leaving only hints of lacing. The smell is dominated by dark roasted malts, chocolate and burnt coffee. The taste is not quite as distinctive as the smell but does have a little more sweetness in the form of molasses up front. Then it's more of the roasted coffee and malts with a slightly bitter coffee finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and a little thin for the style. This is a very drinkable stout though I'm not sure what the lager label is about. Either way, nothing distinctive but not too bad."
""
"If there was such a thing as a session stout, it would be the Colony."
"M/D - Kind of thin. I would not sit down and drink 2 or 3 of these. This is an once in a while, want a change of pace beer."
"D-a decent Stout for anyone wanting a change from average Dry Stouts,but,not one that I will revisit on purpose"
"Pous a nice dark black with a lasting soft and creamy tan head. Smell is metallic, but nicely raosty and some ash, sweetness, and coffee as well. Taste is nicely balanced with coffee, soft oatmeal creaminess and a medium roastiness and light body. Drinks very easily, but not too thin, still. Pretty good, and I actually liked this one quite a bit more than expected. I felt it was pretty underrated."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is almost black on the pour and appears nothing but in the glass and has a one finger- effervescent head that quickly dies down to just a thin layer around the edge of the glass. The smell is what you might expect from an oatmeal stout, roasted barley, coffee and chocolate, maybe a hint of vanilla. The taste is well balanced, with the slight sweetness of chocolate malt being countered with an unexpected bitterness. Roasted notes are quite prominent and there is a slight oxidation present which hurts the taste score. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and the carbonation is more aggressive than creamy. A pretty decent stout overall, not the best but I've definitely had worse."
"Drinkability: Using a lager yeast for an oatmeal stout, though it could be considered an exercise in creativity, did not serve the final product well at all. Or, hell, it may just be an infected bottle. Either way, this is one poor beer."
"Taste is where it wimped out a bit, solid Oaty of chocolate, coffee and malt  but on the weak side. Still decent and tasty. Good priced at $7.50 a sixer, drink er down !"
"Purchased at Sid's (Dubuque, IA) as part of a sampler-pack"
"This is from a bottle that I got well over a year ago in a beer of the month club. I reviewed it elsewhere and am not comparing this beer to then too. It seems to have smoothed out somewhat. But it's still an opaque black. It poured now as then with a big foamy head that quickly dissipated to nothing; no lace. Nice aroma of black fruit, licorice, dark malts, roasty, and just a bit yeasty. Big licorice in the flavor with some of the other aroma components too. Not bad. finish is a typical stout. Not bad, nothing special."
"drinkability: a-ok"
"A nice, drinkable oatmeal stout. Could easily enjoy a few of these in a sitting. Another nice brew from Millstream, I am impressed by what I have tried so far."
"Update: Tried another one from another location and enjoyed it much better. The downfalls I described before were not apparent. The only drawback is still over-carbonation with active fizzing on the tongue. Much better flavor. I bumped my scores for taste & drinkability. Mouthfeel stays put."
"Pours with a small dark brown head that disappears in a few seconds. Deep dark brown in color, appears almost black. Smells fantastic with a strong nutty, chocolaty aroma. Very smooth to drink with very low carbonation levels. Starts like a dry stout with many different characteristics. Taste like a chocolate covered macadamia nut with dry oatmeal flavors. Finishes with just a small amount of hops to balance it out. The finish last sometime and begins to have a strong earthy, nutty taste. Definitely know this is a oatmeal stout, and a very good one at that."
"Not worth going out of the way for, but then again it's from Iowa. Nothing about Iowa is worth going out of the way for. :P"
"Black color, creamy tan head. Smell is of cocoa and roasty, with some hops perceived as well, nice, but could have been stronger. There seems to be some sort of sourness in the taste, but luckily the roastiness overpowers it quickly and leads you to a tasting of oats and cocoa in the finish. Lower carbonation, nice creamy mouthfeel, medium bodied. I could definately see myself having more of this, could be improved in some areas, but is a pretty good local stout. Worth trying if you come across."
"The stout poured a soda colored black. After a very vigorous pour, I still didn't get much of a head, and what I did get came and went by very quickly. The nose was s ubtle marriage of burnt malts and chocolate malts. The flavor began and danced with a malty chocolatieness with a dry finish. It was a surisingly light mouthfeel with a high amount of carbonation. The flavor saves it, and makes it a very decent oatmeal stout. This is one of the dark colored ales that I could sit and session with but not necessarily spend time amazed by its flavor."
"Pours a deep brown-black, quite opaque, don't see much light going through at all. Good carbonation, a little head around the edge, creamy. Nose was extremely smoky with a lot of coffee up front, a bit too much. After sitting a little bit the intensity subsided and a balance was achieved. There is a bit of alcohol acridness in the nose as well. Taste was the same way, crazy amounts of overly smoky coffee (almost burnt) and then subsiding as it sat for a short time, becoming creamier but still maintaining a hefty coffee toasty flavor. Alcohol peeks through again. Altogether could be quite good, the balance is decent but the alcohols break the flow a bit."
"Dthis is good, a good selection for the winter I think."
"Very deep black color with a very slight head on top. Low aroma-some roasted malt and a slight bitter smell. Mellow roasted flavor with some chocolate going on. Slight bittersweet after taste. Ok enough body. A fairly drinkable beer. I am confused by the label stating its a lager but an oatmeal stout. For me it suffers an identity crisis. A notch above average."
"Solid onyx. Short espresso crema head of medium bubbles that quickly settles to a skim coat. No carbonation streams are visible. Slightly charred oatmeal, both sweet and charcoal, dominates, but is still relatively restrained. An initial smoky roastedness fills the mouth. The oatmeal comes on, but not as smooth or creamy as expected and has trouble standing out against the deep roasted notes. The finish is of slightly bitter roast malt and it is short and compact. The palette is left surprisingly clean. Medium to light mouthfeel with a thin, petite body, this could use just a bit more oomph, but that is just to be picky. Nicely carbonated. Enjoyable and a solid offering."
"Nice drink."
"I know it's not too far and I would give this to friends as a transition beer into other types of beer that are labeled ""dark beers"" by uneducated drinkers."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin and clean, not creamy at all. Is this due to it being a lager instead of an ale? Aside from the only negative, this is a really good beer that is very drinkable. It just isn't an outstanding beer."
"12 ounce bottle. Millstream Oatmeal Stout pours out a not quite black color with a small brown head. Roasted chocolate in the aroma with roasted malt. The flavor is very roasty and smooth, although some astringency comes in at the finish. Lots of chocolatey flavor. Just a touch of hoppiness. Drinkability is pretty good. According to the bottle this is a lager, but I can't taste how this differs from a regular oatmeal stout. Not overly roasty, but this still a decent example of the style."
"Overall this is the best of the Millstream sampler I just tried...I'd slip a sixer of this into my winter rotation if this was availabe in my area...."
"12 oz bottle pours jet black color with a decent creamy light brown head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Chocolate, nutty aroma, chocolate, roasted coffee flavors. Light to medium bodied with a somewhat watery mouthfeel, finishes with a mild sweetness, very nice."
"Final verdict: Enjoyable. Check it out."
"Drinkabillity was good, in fact I planned to bring some bottles home with me from the brewere, but unfortanetly they were out at the time."
"Colony Oatmeal Stout pours dark brown, like any other stout, with a short-lived tan colored head. Its aroma is warm and comforting, with strong hints of coffee and chocolate. The flavor is sweet combination of caramel and chocolate. Nice. A strong coffeelike aftertaste fades quickly, earning this brew above average marks in the drinkability category. -- Overall, this is a decent stout and perhaps an excellent introduction for quaffers new to the style."
"of their best beers."
"it pours totally dark (duh) with a mild tan foam. some hints of brown-tinged light shine though reluctantly. aroma is bready with heavily creamed coffee. mild and certainly not pungent scent. flavor is also very mild and refreshing. reminds me of an iced coffee with most of the ice melted. some mocha notes as well as butterscotch and toffee in the end. warmth brings out carob and date flavors. rich, buttery tastes mix in a mild way yielding a light-to-medium body oatmeal flavor.. not predominant but adds a certain doughy mouthfeel. overall a decent beer and par for course."
"Appears blavk as night and poured a nice head but is leaving no lacing. Smell is somewhat sweet but discreet. Taste has coffee overtones, is smooth, but finishes dry. Mouthfeel is smooth as an outmeal stout should be. This is a nice beer that is worth a try."
"This is good. Perfect beer to help me relax. Pours very dark in color. Kind of like cold coffee. Thin brown head. Aroma is slightly coffee, and just a tad bready. The flavor is very strong in roasted barley. I like it. Nice flavor. Dark chocolate flavor too. The hops are there and bring out a nice peppermint tone. The oatmeal come across in the mouthfeel and I almost want to chew this beer. Other than that, it is fairlyfull bodied (just a tad watery) and full of good flavors."
"Notes: This is a very nice beer. It seems to be a bit thin compared to most stouts, but this may have something to do with the fact that it's supposedly using lager yeast? Regardless of whether it is to style or not, its a very tasty beer. Maybe the lager yeast choices help this beer attain session quality?"
"Tasted: 04/14/05"
"This one says it's an oatmeal stout lager...what the heck is that? Anyway. Pours a dark brown color with a moderate head that has nice retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of chocolate and roasted malts in it. Very pleasing. The flavor is much like the aroma with the chocolate and roasted taking the front. Slight sweetness and the body is thick and creamy. Very enjoyable. Drinkability is great as well."
"Don, you're a champ. This pours a deep, deep brown color with just a hint of light showing at the edges. There is a small head that falls to coat the top of the brew. The nose is nice, with a healthy roasted and slight chocolate character. The flavor is good. There is a nice bit of chocolatey sweetness and a slight burnt roasted quality. The feel is moderate to thick. This brew is rather nice. I like the nose and the flavors. I would have this one again. Very good show."
"overall a lightly carbonated and medium bodied beer--much lighter than i expected given it's rich color. Overall easy to drink and plenty of flavor. I'd even consider eating this with some japanese food. a fine, clean stout."
"On a pairing note, dark chocolate makes an excellent companion for this beer, but only in small amounts, because something too rich could overwhelm the beer."
"A fine lagered stout. One of the best stouts I have ever had. This one easily competes with any stout from Bells."
"A reasonable oatmeal stout. A bigger body would help significantly. The concept of an oatmeal stout lager is intriguing as well."
"Very clean and milky, this defines ""smooth"" in a stout. Full flavored, malty, chocolate, malted milk ball type flavors with just a bit of roasted flavor through the finish. It's pretty straightforward as a chocolatey, milky oatmeal stout with decent carbonation. And it's incredibly drinkable. A surprisingly good treat. Thanks, Don."
"Drinkability: An enjoyable (and highly drinkable) stout. If you're a fan of the style, I'd definitely recommend it. It is a nice fallback session stout around these parts since it is widely available in this area."
"Mouthfeel has a silky smooth creaminess to it with just enough carbonation to make it lively on the palate. This is a stout that I wouldn't mind sessioning with and is a nice suprise as I just picked it up on a whim while I was in Iowa. Recommended."
"I emailed the brewery and they suggested the off taste came from the fact that I had an 8-month old bottle; since they don't pasteurize their beer, that's past its prime. I will definietly buy more fresh beer and revise my review at a future date."
"12 oz bottle obtained from To Your Health (Coralville) in Janurary 2005 and consumed that same evening. Freshness date says November. Pours thick and silent with a half-finger brown head...and with a chocolate smell. Appears utterly pitch black, even when held up to a light. Smell has a nice blend of chocolate and coffee. Taste takes a while to take hold. Chocolate and coffee run around playing tag in my mouth. First one dominates, then the other. What an interesting experience. Hazelnut comes in late and the finish is dry and roasty. Body is medium heavy and carbonation is strong (too heavy for the style IMO). The flavors are really well-balanced in this beer. I find this to be one of the most drinkable stouts I've ever had."
"This is my first experience with an oatmeal stout. I must say, being an Iowa native, I am quite surprised to see that a state with such a strong love affair for sissy yellow beer could produce such a deliciously black nectar. This was my third favorite of Millstream's product line when I took the tour earlier today. It pours quite dark with a small tan head. Tastes almost like a Guiness, but not quite as dry or harsh. While I can appreciate this beer for what it is, it would not be my choice for a medium to heavy session."
"Dark brown body. No light penetrateth. Creamy, toasted-tan head. Nice. Good lacing. Sweet, roasted barley with notes of coffee and chocolate. Smells good to me. Sweetish mocha sweetness unfolds, amidst lightly roasted barley. Full-bodied, and velvety-creamy. Slight homebrew funk. Reminds me of Lake Superior's Sir Duluth. Overall, a very nice oatmeal stout that would make a great session beer."
"This is one of the most drinkable stouts that I've ever had. Sweet malt upfront, not roasted and bitter, just a hint of coffee and toffee mixed with and oaty aftertaste. Really nice, but not very complex or strong. Good mouthfeel, but not great, and, like I said, this is the most drinkable stout that I've ever come across."
"Dark brown with the usual Millstream fizzy and short-live head. The aroma is full of sweet chocolate and roast with a bit of oatmeal. The flavor is fairly big, but comes across as a bit thin. The body is really watery for the style and unsatisfying despite the flavor being pretty good. This brewerys best beer is definitely the Johns Generations, an excellent witbier."
"Thanks to BuckeyeNation for the trade. Pours a very dark brown color that lets a little light through. Thin beige head that dissipated rapidly. Not much lacing until further down the glass. The aroma consists mainly of coffee as well as a touch of malt. Medium-bodied with a milky texture. Roasted coffee, malt and a touch of tart fruit in the flavor. The finish is smooth with a lightly bitter character. Nothing too exciting going on here, just a run-of-the-mill Oatmeal Stout you can find anywhere."
"Taste is far too sweet; it has tart, tangy, tones that aren't doing it for me. Lots of malt and oat sweetness thats becoming uncomfortably close to wine-like for an oatmeal stout. Dark cherry and some charred wood notes actually make a way in towards the finish, but the sweetness here is over the top for me. Perhaps this has gotten past its prime. The smell maybe eludes to what it may have once existed in flavors, but this is a sweetified, tangy mess. No matter how hard I try, I cannot enjoy this bottle. Looked and smelled promising, but the taste promised nothing but an overly sweet twang of undrinkable soda pop syrup."
"Backwash: Quite an interesting beer. Labelled as a lager, you would hardly know it but for the slightly diluted body and perhaps the simple flavor profile. Still, it provides a good deal of flavor and enjoyment in a tight, refined package. A fine local choice."
"Millstream Colony Oatmeal Stout is a good version. I'll have no problem drinking locally after tasting this beer."
"I guess this beer caught me off guard. Just being a beggining beer drinker I haven't had much experience with darker beers. Personally I wasn't a big fan of the nutty taste. It had an almost coffee dark taste to it. If you are a fan of darker beers this one will be the one for you. It's tastes are complex enough for a dark beer fan."
"Call it a stout, or call it a dark lager, Colony Oatmeal Stout is one fine beer."
"This beer is a completely black beer, with a small, brown head on the top. The smell is of clean, lagered water, and of chocolate. The taste is a bit peculiar, clean lagered, chocolate, pretty sweet, a tad bitter, and something else, possibly some fruit. It just seems a bit confused, something about it but this isnt my favorite."
"Dark black color, small head. Aroma is mildly choolate, but kind of weak. A medium bodied Oatmeal stout. Roasted malts, chocolatly and slightly sweet. Mild hops, slightly spicy. Big taste, full flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is very dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice stout."
"Not a bad brew at all, but the lack of top-fermenting yeast did not please this stout-fan's palate at all, only left me yearning for a true stout."
"The beer pours that most lovely of colors A deep mahogany brown to black, the head is plentiful, light chocolate in color, the lace sticky thick sheets that adhere nicely to the glass. Sweet roasted barley dominates the nose, hot milk chocolate also come to mind, caramel and quite a pleasure to Sniff. Front is sweet, the top is middling in mouth feel, with a pertinent acidic bite, hops pleasing to the palate, the aftertaste bittersweet and dry. The beer is drinkable, although a bit ""Watery", would classify it as a ""Beginners"" introduction to the dark side and stouts, so maybe I should temper my criticism."
"This beer is a dark ruby.  It is capped by a fizzy brown head that recedes to and edging within seconds.  Chocolatey and coffee-like on the nose.  Pretty nice.  This stout features some bittersweet chocolate tones as well as burnt malt.  Also present to a small degree is dark fruity tones.  Everything melds together nicely.  Not as creamy of a mouthfeel as I like in my stouts, but drinkable nonetheless.  Not too bad.  Not too great."
"Good solid black appearance, but lacks the oily thickness of other stouts.  Smells of dark chocolate.  Taste is appealing with bittersweet chocolate in the front, more bitter at first and sweet afterwards, and a good maltiness in the middle.  Hops are slightly present, smooth and easy down the pipe."
"Nearly opaque jet black hue, w/ a hint of hazy deep garnet when held to light.  The light brown head settles quickly into a thin layer that leaves sparse islands of bubbles. Sharp, coffeeish roasted barley combined with chocolate malt dominate the aroma... dark caramel malt sweetness is intially subdued but becomes more assertive as the brew warms.  Fruity esters are completely absent.  The flavor is an appropriate extension of the aroma, although w/ a more prominent malt sweetness.  An initial snap of roasted barley bitterness gives way to sugary caramel, then moderate hop bitterness and chocolate malt emerge, lending a bittersweet dark chocolate character mid palate.  Light in body for style, but with sufficient dextrins for a smooth mouthfeel.  Finishes somewhat dry, w/ roasted grain bitterness lingering.  Colony is an enjoyable oatmeal stout, but doesn't possess any outstanding qualities.  Although it lacks the ""silky"" quality of a good OS, the drinkability remains good."
"Thinnish (once again, Millstream) in the mouth. What presents itself is smooth and silky. Boost the body of this just a little, and it is a very, very solid oatmeal stout. Above average as it is. Easily consumed."
"Low carbonation and head as expected, nice and chewy with a chocolate/coffee flavor.  Smooth throughout with the malt and hops balanced.  I see why it is brewed year-round."
"Black and creamy looking, this beer also smelled wonderful.  I thought I could smell the oatmeal.  Smooth ,velvelty and somewhat sweet, this beer was quite nice.  It has an understated richness, but with enough hop presence to not make this too cloying.  I very much enjoyed this brew, even in the summer."
"Notes: Very drinkable and quite clean ... not your usual over roasted character found in a lot of oatmeal stouts, just good easy drinking. Goes perfect with any kind of chocolate."
