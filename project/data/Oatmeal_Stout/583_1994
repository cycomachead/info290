4.42,14.8,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Brew pours close to a pitch black in color with a good 1-finger foamy beige head. Lots of lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of dark roasted malts with some fresh roasted and ground coffee beans. Very nice. The taste is pretty much the same with a nice flavor of coffee that is not strong or overpowering like some coffee stouts I have tried. Very smooth and goes down easy. No strong, no bitter and no harsh aftertaste at all. A great Coffee Stout! Medium-bodied with lower carbonation.","BeerWithMike","Mar 25, 2015"

Very strong taste of burnt coffee but lacked other, complimentary flavors.  Starts strong but finishes rather weak.  It could have used some chocolate. Very light carbonation.  Not a bad stout but cannot be compared to, say, Founders Breakfast Stout.","MacMalt","Feb 16, 2015"

Espresso tends to be watery, flat, and bitter and that's what this was too. If that's your thing, drink away!

The beer is a dark brown color that almost appears like a dark black that resembles coffee. As expected, the beer is opaque. The beer has a very strong coffee smell and dominates the other smells. However, the other smells such as the hint of oatmeal and roasted malts compliment the beer instead of detracting from it. The taste does not quite live up to the expectation of the smell but still works well. Coffee is the dominant flavor and slight complemented by the oatmeal and roasted malts. The beer feels surprisingly light for a heavy bodied beer with biting carbonation. The beer itself feels smooth as it goes down. Overall, a pretty decent coffee stout and worth getting again.","HattedClassic","Nov 28, 2013"

My nose also detected a small presence of oxidation. The flavor has a nice bitter coffee flavor, and as advertised, the 'cold toddy extraction process' does indeed produce a less acidic flavor. It's rather light, no doubt benefiting from the breadiness of the Oatmeal as well. The overall mouthfeel however might be a little too light and carbonated, a bit of a let down compared to the expected velvety softness that one might get with other Oatmeal Stouts, such as New Holland's ""The Poet."" This might not be the best coffee stout ever made, but the uniqueness of the coffee blending and it's resulting flavor are enough to give it merit.","Neorebel","Dec 16, 2012"

The flavors are well rounded and approachable. There is a good amount of coffee with moderate bitterness, baking chocolate, smooth dark malts, obviously some roast, and a light chocolate/oatmeal malty sweetness. It has nice flavor. It drinks on the lighter side of medium in body and leaves behind a nice amount of coffee in the aftertaste. This is a pretty solid beer.

It pours a murky dark burnt sienna topped by a finger of lightly dusty dirty white foam. The nose is dominated by a rich coffee aroma, with some mild molasses, dusty dark chocolate, and lightly chlorinated wheat rollicking behind. The taste embitters the coffee, while simultaneously complimenting it with some rye notes. The chocolate also gets some bitterness (we're nearing cookin' choc here), and the roasted malts seem rather burnt. A hint of light leather hides in the back. The body is a lightly hefty medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a pretty smooth feel. Overall, a nice coffee stout, though the bitterness borders on harshness. I could see drinking more of them, though.","TMoney2591","Mar 31, 2011"

The taste has a coffee taste and bitterness at first, but it dissapates rather quickly. Actually the first sip is very impressive, but as I kept drinking, I lost what that first sip yielded. I've had better coffee stouts but this is not bad. Maybe this is becasue I like my coffee strong. It finishes well, leaving a coffee-like bitterness behind.

The coffee tastes fresh and of high quality. A little roasted bitterness in the finish. If the stout characteristics came through more, this would be a really good beer.

The aroma is wonderful. If you are a coffee lover, this is the perfect fusion of beer and coffee. As you drink the foam clings to the glass. This beer tastes like it smells, balanced, with the taste of coffee and slight hints of chocolate. Best Coffee based beer I have had- I think this is The Saint Louis Brewery's greatest victory.

Poured three shades shy of black with deep maroon highlights around the base of the glass. Two inch, tight tan-colored head with excellent retention that left behinds thick bands of lacing as it receded. Roasted coffee dominates the nose with a slightly vegetal quality detected towards the back. Taste follows nose, but a little on the bland side and some residual espresso roast lightly lingers at the finish. Mouthfeel was somewhat light for the style without much of the chewiness I've come to associate with an oatmeal stout. Exceptional appearance and bold nose gives way to a somewhat muted representation of the style; easy drinking brew nonetheless.","Jwale73","Feb 09, 2009"

There is an amazing balance between all the flavors which make it a great brew. If the coffee was overpowering it would just be coffee and not beer. The mouthfeel was a little thin.

I was hoping the mouthfeel would be a bit thicker seeing as how it's an oatmeal stout, just brewed with coffee beans, but none the less it does have a nice moderate body to it.

The coffee tries very hard to become a fixture in the flavor as it was in the aroma, but it falls very short. A slightly thick mouthfeel, feels alot like skim milk, it finishes dry at the back of the palate.

Poured into a nonic at about 50 degrees, this is a dark cola-brown stout, with ruby-chestnut highlights and a fluffy, somewhat talkative, light tan head. Big roasted coffee aromas in the nose, along with some caramel-chocolate sweet scents and a bit of sour, black-roasted malt. A satisfying bouquet that approaches the sublimity of the noses of other more legendary coffee stouts made by Bell's and Founders. Good beers to emulate. Coffee permeates every part of the taste, with slightly sour dark-roasted grain flavors and a bready, cocoa-like sweetness. The non-coffee flavors are full and soft, providing a suitable contrast to the sharp bitterness of the coffee, which as I mentioned previously, is impossible to not notice. Impressive webby lacing, by the way. The palate is just a bit too thin for a stout with such a bold flavor profile. It's got a medium-full body, but I'm missing the oatmeal silkiness and richness of other coffee-forward stouts. Yes, I know every beer can't be Breakfast Stout, but that wouldn't really be so bad, now, would it? Anyway, this is a damn fine beer, perfect to sip on a snowy Sunday.","orfeu","Jan 28, 2007"

4.03,4.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Well, happy to see this on local shelves. The beer delivers a big aromatic punch of espresso beans and roasted goodness. Its all about the coffee up front. Flavors are dominated by solidly brewed espresso with a supporting stout character. The stout has difficulty standing up to the immense coffee characteristics, but contributes malt sweetness, toffee, caramel, and a hint of vanilla and brown sugar. The oats in the brew round the coffee nicely, but maybe too much so. The beer needs some rough edges to compete with the coffee acidity and strength. Feels full and rich to the mouth and finishes with a velvety slickness. Aftertastes are all coffee in nature. A good beer, but an American Stout backbone would have been better.","BEERchitect","Nov 14, 2006"

4.37,13.5,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"12 oz bottle. The brew pours a deep brown to almost black color with a faint ruby highlite around the edges. The head is massive, working up to 3 fingers tall. It leaves really nice lace as it falls to about a finger over top. There is little to no carbonation working up the sides of my glass. The aroms on this one is all about the coffee. It smells like a nice moderate roast coffee with a hint of sweetness and creamyness from the oatmeal stout base. This one really smells a lot like freshly ground coffee. I like it. The flavor brings the same intensity of coffee that I found in the aroma. This carries all the way through the beer. The aftertaste presents a mild creamy oat character with a mild roasted maltyness, but it definately screams coffee here. Mouthfeel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. It is a little slick from the oats, but nothing bad. I think this is an incredibly good coffee stout, with a ton of coffee in both the aroma and flavor. It is a bit one dimensional, but I think that is what makes this beer what it is. I am happy to have 4 more of these.","kmpitz2","Oct 31, 2006"

This flavor and aroma has been embellished over '05 vintage. I am sending a couple of my California homebrewers some beans along with a cold toddy recipe and am hoping they have the solid oatmeal stout recipes similar to Schlafly's to support the huge coffee flavor and aroma.","karst","Feb 28, 2006"

Taste is where this beer excels. Deep roasted malt flavor. Dark rich coffee. And a bit of a toast taste give this an exceptional flavor. Feels thick rich and crisp in the mouth. I could drink these all day. Of the beers I received in the trade from Dertbert this is the biggest suprise and my favorite so far.

The smell is of roasted oatmeal and coffee. The taste is incredible. You first notice the oatmeal with a coffee taste left for the finish. The mouthfeel is very smooth. Nothing detracts from this brew. The only thing keeping me from driving to St. Louis to get a case is I am kinda tired. But I am thinking of calling in sick in the morning. So you could say I think this is a worthwhile beer. I will cross paths with this brew again.","Enola","Jan 11, 2006"

3.85,0,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"From MJR. Thanks bro'. Super cola-like in appearance. Brown with a small white head that rises up and than dies leaving some nice lacing. Carbonation is big bubbled, and frothy. Aromas are fresh espresso, some lightly roasted malts, and maybe some slight hops. The taste is coffee like, but weak-coffee like with some roasted coffee notes and a subtle hoppiness that is very much in the background. There are also some chocolate notes in the mix as well and maybe some caramel? Mouthfeel is too light and this hurts the drinkability a little bit. This is very light for a stout, and it almost comes accross as more of a coffee porter. I'd love to know the abv on this. A solidly good, but not spectacular coffee-infused beer.","francisweizen","Apr 22, 2005"
3.54,-8.1,3.5,4.5,3.5,2.5,3,"Dark brown in hue, blacker in the middle with some ruby influences around the edges. Even when the liquid is backlit the opaqueness holds-up well. The head was beige in color; at the apex the foam was two-fingers in height, the bubbles faded quickly to a soapy cap with some naked spots in the middle, thicker around the edges. There wasnt much subsequent lacing, just a few short-lived clumps. On the whole, this beer looks like what it should but little more. The nose is, well, coffee. Iced espresso. Day old spend grains. Roasted beans. There are hints of chocolate and a dash of milk-like sweetness. Wow, there is no fooling around here! I love the fact the potency is high and the aromas are allowed to fully explore my olfactory. For a Coffee Stout the complexity is fairly high, I could imagine something more in the bouquet like a tickle of hops or some smoke but Im a greedy dick. For a beer of this sort I really like what I smell. Powerful. Inviting. The palate is far less complex and deep as the nose indicated. This is a major bummer. The espresso qualities are dimmer and the day old coffee flavors move into the forefront. This is always a worry with me when it comes to Coffee Stouts. It really needs to be the other way around. It is so hard to capture the goodness of coffee without turning it into something that you find at the end of a day at a Quickie Mart. You know, stale coffee. The acidity from the roast is way too naked, their needs to be more sweetness, malt depth, and/or hop bitterness. The palate lacks roundness, it is too sharp where is the harmony? Plus the fact the body is so small this really hurts the development of the palate. One-dimensional. Boring. Straightforward. You get the point, right? It is not sophisticated enough to pair with dessert. Medium-light in body, the carbonation is firm, and the mouthfeel is lousy. There needs to be way more body to make this beer work. Skinny. The taste and mouthfeel of this beer reminded me a lot of Spilker Ales XPO Espresso Stout (RIP), that is too bad because that beer had some flaws as does this one. Sure it is drinkable but Im bored with it and one bottle is enough for me, thankfully, I only had one bottle. This was purchased at the Tap Room in St. Louis as part of a mixed six-pack. I say skip it.","bditty187","Apr 14, 2005"
1.44,-62.6,3.5,2,1,1.5,1,"I had one of the best coffee and beer combinations ever. It was Red Hook's Double Espresso stout and it is miles above what Tom Schlafly is calling a coffee stout. The smell of coffee is vaguely present. I often use the toddy method to brew my morning coffee and it is a great method. The method is wasted in this brew. I may have gotten a bad six-pack but I live in St. Louis and grabbed a six as soon as it came available at my local mega mart. The brew had decent color but the nose was sour, the taste spicy in a puckering kinda way, and the finish was lackluster.","sutcliff","Mar 11, 2005"

4.69,21.8,4,5,5,4.5,4,"This beer pours dark brown with a creamy head. The head fades somewhat quickly leaving few laces. As soon as the beer is poured, you are assulted by a very strong coffee aroma. Hidden is a malty aroma, but the coffee aroma is dominant. It tastes very coffee like. I guess that is because it is a coffee stout. It tastes just like cold coffee with alcohol. It is very impressive. Other coffee stouts only have a mild coffee flavor, but this one has very strong flavors. It leaves a coffee taste in the mouth. It is rather pleasent. It is carbonated just right. This beer would be a great session beer. It is very tasty and it doesnt have too much alcohol. If I could get this beer where I live, I would drink it all the time. The rating it has doesnt give it justice.","OStrungT","Feb 23, 2005"

Drinkability is a paradox, the first one, and then the second were outstanding  then its like a 2nd pumpkin ale or a dessert, it starts to become overwhelming. Would be a great after dinner finishing beer.","Vancer","Feb 14, 2005"
