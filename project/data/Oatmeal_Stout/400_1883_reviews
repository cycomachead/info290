"Overall: This is a big, sturdy stout to enjoy on its own or with a good meal. Definitely a good pick-up for fans of coffee stouts and oatmeal stouts."
""

"The taste also brings out the dark malt and oatmeal character with a mild dry bitterness to finish. It is a pretty decent beer from Maine."
"Pours dark brown with a little tan foam on top. and a bit fizzy. Rich roasted oaty nose. Taste is a hearty wall of oats, coffee grittiness, then suddenly a smooth finish. Mild bitter. Good close. A little milky, but not in a sweet stout kind of way."

"o: A tasty stout, although the initial aroma belies the heavy smoky taste. Not terribly easy drinking due to the smoky taste and lingering tobacco ashy flavor. Might be good with a cigar though for that reason."
""

"O: Overall this is a great oatmeal stout from New England area Maine for sure and they know cold weather and hot coffee this is a great substitute for that. I would think about this one for breakfast, very yummy."

"Solid Oatmeal Stout with an emphasis on dark roast malts. Nice cocoa flavor throughout the experience. Flavor seems to thin out just a bit after some time but still nothing wrong here at all."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel takes a hit because of the extra carbonation. Though it's not overwhelming, it's a little too much. It also takes a hit because while it looks thick, it feels a bit thinner than it should be. This is one very drinkable stout. I would definitely recommend this one to anyone looking for a good stout and could easily spend the night drinking these."

"Overall: Pretty solid oatmeal stout. Too bad they have to make it in Portland and not in Belfast Bay. Still an awesome though."

"Yields over two fingers of super-dark brown foam, very airy and loose, fizzing off at a quick pace, plenty of dimpling along the way to a thin surface coating left behind, minimal lacing to be had. The liquid itself is jet black with the vaguest hint of orange at the rims. The nose feels firm and in no way soft, focuses on dark chocolate, coffee, scone, anise seed, no truly sugary component involved, the oats dried rather than cooked or even cookie status, it’s sufficiently densely packed that even the roast doesn’t lift much, mild hoppiness comes through at warmer temperatures. Medium-bodied, noticeably dry and chewy, again the oats and grains seem uncooked and dusty even, comes across as semi-bitter, heavy on the roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate, cocoa and then black licorice and dried orange peels. Hard to truly peg the hops for the pucker factor near the end, maybe yes, maybe no. Carbonation seems low given the density of the material. With each additional sip you can’t help but wish it were a little sweeter with more length. No fruit nor something like caramel, vanilla. In the end, feels “traditional” but not so much a fun style of stout to kick back with and spend an evening."

"Notes: Such a great Oatmeal stout drinkable and very hearty. Cheers."

"Overall not sure where I can pick up some more since this was an online beer but I welcome another at another day down the road. Until then Barley Flats oatmeal stout will have to do."

"A pretty good oatmeal stout. Nothing outstanding, but worth trying for sure."
""
""
"Great brew. Nice, not filling or cloying. Highly drinkable. Glad I saw this."
""
"O: Enjoyable and easy to drink, I could definitely have more than one of these and I would enjoy that. The beer has a pleasant favor and a wonderful appearance. Very nice complexity to the flavor."
"O: not a bad stout. This is more of a dessert beer since the chocolatey tones come out fairly strong. I'd probably have this again depending what was served."
"Not terribly great. Not really too much to say about it. A very boring bland beer."
""
""
""
"O: The medium-bodied nature of this beer makes it quite easy to drink."
""
"Overall pretty good, would be better if they used slightly less black patent malt, or heavy crystal malts, or maybe there is a hint of roast that shouldn't be there. Whatever the light burnt overroasted malt flavor with a light acrid and chalky feel takes away a bit. Otherwise very tasty and done well, a nice full winter beer that won't knock you on your ass after 2 of them."

"Smells roasty and a bit acidic, which carries over into the taste. The usual smooth and easy drinking nuttiness of a good OS is missing. Instead it's somewhat overly bitter, acrid and just plain rough. Maybe too aggressively hopped for the style? Resembles more of a low ABV RIS than an Oatmeal Stout. Found myself wincing a bit with each mouthful and looking forward to the bottom of the glass. Wouldn't go back to this one."
""
"A great beer for the style, and a much more enjoyable one after having recently had Dark Horse One. THis one is a winner really enjoyed it."
""
"It'd be funny to think that the brewer's chose this name over both Muskie's and Humprhey's... Maybe? *ahem* Anyway, it pours a straight onyx topped by a finger of light off-khaki foam. The node comprises roasted malts, dark chocolate, light coffee, and molasses. The taste brings in more of the same, with the roast really getting kicked up, the coffee and chocolate turning bitter and acrid, and some light vinyl and tobacco entering the fray as well. The body is a solid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly dry finish. Overall, a pretty okay oatmeal stout, but one that lacks the smoothness, the finesse, the creaminess, the softness that usually comes with the style. It's still alright, just nothing I would consider great."
"Overall, highly drinkable!"
"Drinkability: I wish I'd have opted for more than a bottle of this. It's a pretty complex one for the style. Glad I had the chance to try it, and would recommend it to those who have a chance."
"The brew pours with a look typical of a nice stout: black with a tan cap, though it is a short-lived head. The nose is equal parts of cocoa, roast, and toffee-coffee-caramel-candy notes, but it is not sweet. It tastes about the same as the nose but it adds a pleasantly acrid roast and smoke hint to the mix. Feel is medium soft and creamy with a super drying mouthfeel, a tad reminiscent of black coffee. Quite nice, overall."
"Very roasty aroma...charcoal, nearly burnt malt, and smoke...plus, unfortunately, a little plastic and band-aid scent. The beer is dry, intensely dry, with the roasted character carrying through from the smell. No malt or hops in the flavor, just a lot of malt and grain. Fleeting alcohol in the taste. Moderate bitterness and a medium-to-light body for an oatmeal stout. Not a bad beer, although the creamy, full texture that I expect from an oatmeal stout was entirely lacking."
"First sip reveals a light body with average carbonation. Flavor is similar to the nose with burnt malt and brown sugar mixing not too complex. Also still find no hop presence or hint of ABV. A pretty easy drinking oatmeal stout that is nice and roasty but the body is a little thin for the style and I would like more with a little mor thickness. Still I could and would drink more than one in a sitting if I had the beer around."
"Poured black with a very thin head. Has a very strong roasted character in the nose. Tastes Bitter/bittersweet mixture of chocolate, coffee and oats. Emphasis on the coffee bitterness. Has a much thinner body than I had expected, a little acidic. Reminds me too much of a strong black coffee rather than a beer."
"O - A really enjoyable sunday afternoon brew on a cold spring day. Wish it was local around here so I could stock up. A lot of flavor for a session brew."
"D - A little bit of sweetness emerges as it warms up, making it a touch better, but it's still not very good and I doubt most people would wait that long. Mike's drain got much of this one."
"D - This is not a good beer, it tastes pour and drinks hard for its 5.1%."
"D: The nose was quite nice, but the flavor and mouthfeel are just a failure. Not a fan of this one."
"D-A good brew overall but there are much better oatmeal stouts out there"
"Black, black, BLACK as it oozes from the bottle into the glass. It's incredible how thick this beer looks, and how utterly black it is. Are there shades of blackness? Decent but unspectacular aroma of toasted stuff, typical for the style, with a sharpness that seems unusual. Rather watery body given the thickness of the beer, with appropriately light carbonation. The first few sips were tasty and toasty and smooth-- very nice. But as it warmed up it started tasting more and more like soap; by the time I got to the bottom of the glass I felt like my grandmother had risen from the grave and was following through on her threats of 40 years ago... washing out my mouth with soap. Have I been swearing excessively lately? Sorry. But soapy beer... yeesh. That's enough to make anyone curse."
"Pours a deep brown, nearly black color with a dense tan head. Strong roasty smell with coffee notes. Creamy mouthfeel with roasted malt taste with just enough sweetness and no alcohol present. Overall good representation of the style and very sessionable at a great price."
"Not world class, but an enjoyable beer I would certainly have again."
"Very drinkable beer. A good session beer, cause you just can't drink one."
"D: I want to sit down to a bowl of this every morning, and every night for dessert. This is such a versatile beer. I'm definitely grabbing another 6er of this asap!"
"I only bought one bottle this time, but I can easily see myself going back for a full 6 pack."
"I have had a few better tasting Oatmeal Stouts including Young's, Sam Smith's, and Founders."
"D: Really easy to put down, low ABV, grab a sixer."
"Jet black with a nice small head at first. Mild espresso and cocoa aroma. Deep roasted flavor-almost to a burnt degree but it is not unpleasant. Some hop bitterness. Lacks the creamy flavor and the silkiness of a good oatmeal stout. Body is a tad thin-again no sign of oats in here. A decent enough stout."
"Their website has a talking lobster."
"Overall: I like this beer...I have always had a soft spot in my heart for Stouts and Maine. Def. worth a try, especially if it is cold outside. That being said, if you want an Oatmeal Stout that will blow your mind, go with the Sammy Smith's. Cheers!!"
"This is a decent beer, pretty much bang on for the style. Mouthfeel is nice, but a tad chewy and thick. Very drinkable, but this beer cloys rather rapidly."
"D: Very drinkable, this is a great session stout for sure."
"Dark Tan head, with slight coffee and roasted barley smell and hints of malt. This starts sweet with smooth mouth feel over the tongue with noticeable bubbles on the tip. Big roasted barley taste that lingers into your next sip the second sip is better then the first, the sweet malt taste and the roasted barley make for a wonderful beer."
"Pours a staright blac with brownie highlights and a nice one finger brown head. The aroma is a nice roasted malt, but pretty astringent smelling coffee with maybe a drizzle of cream. The taste starts roasted creamy and smooth, then gets a little tart and acidic. The finish a slightly vinegarish coffee. Palate goes from smooth to tart. OK oatmeal stout taht could use a litle less tartness."
"Very dark and rich body with a one inch dark brown head that faded to a thin film quickly. Nice roasted malt aroma with some dark chocolate as well as cherry and light vanilla. Flavor is dry and roasted with some burnt malt coming out on the lightly hoppy finish. Very full flavored. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with active fizzy carbonation. Texture is more watery than anything else with a little chalkiness on the finish. Overall, a pretty good beer. Full of flavor, and a really nice surprise. It tastes more like a dry stout than an Oatmeal stout, but very tasty none the less."
"Pitch black in the pour; very volitile in the pour thick huge dark tan head but does not lace as well as head would lead you to believe. On the dry side, very mild bitterness. Very balanced in taste. Hints of dark fuit and coffee. Nice feeling in the mouth, very smooth. A highly drinkable stout."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Without a doubt the best stout that I've had in quite a while. Not quite as good as Samuel Smith's Oatmeal, but pretty darn good. It's just not quite silky enough due to it's thin mouthfeel."
"D: Crazy drinkable, balanced well, very tasty, if you like stouts, this is one to sit with for an evening and a half!"
"All in all, this is a tasty oatmeal stout- I have yet to find one that matches up with sammy smith's but we're getting closer with this one. Cheers"
"Poured into a standard pint glass. The beer is black in color with a slight brown head that settles to skim within a few minutes. There is barely any lace left on the glass. It is extremely opaque; you can't see anything through it. The oatmeal stout smells of roasted grains and malt with some nuttiness. It tastes of chocolate and coffee, with a bitterness at the end. The bitterness and coffee flavor lingers after you swallow. It has a medium body that is strengthened by the aftertaste. It has a normal amount of carbonation, nothing too exceptional. It does feel very smooth going down. This beer is enjoyable but I remember liking it more when I had it on tap at the old Belfast Bay brewpub. The bottle I'm reviewing had been in the refrigerator all afternoon, so it was quite cold when poured, now that it is warming up, I'm enjoying the beer more."
"D: I think I'll have another."
"Overall a good Oatmeal Stout"
"Poured out of 12oz. bottle, this elixir resembles a dark coffe like liquer, with a nice head profile of creamy coffee foam. Aromas are mild, containing sweet oats and malt, hay and roasted porridge. Flavors are nicer than the aromas, serving up a meritage of dark cocoa, roasted gruel, blackened grog and nice sweet oatmeal on the finish. A decent offering for consumers to seek out. This tasted much better as it warmed up, and I recommend bringing this to almost room temperature to enjoy the full palate of flavors."
"Out of a bottle this brew was an opaque black with one finger of tan head. The retention was less than stellar but the lacing was decent. The aroma was rather chocolaty, with some roasted malt, light coffee and molasses. The flavors were solid and robust; starting on a note of roasted malt I then tasted the light chocolate followed by oats, earthiness and a long coffee finish. Pleasantly bitter but balanced. The mouthfeel was smooth and rich, the body was full and the carbonation excellent for the style. Though nothing about the beer was outstanding I really enjoyed it and thought it a good overall example of the style."
"A brew of impenetrable black, it gives off a roasty aroma of burnt vegetables. The taste, however, is of dark coffee grounds, with a bit of oats and soy sauce. It grows on you with each sip. There a sticky mouthfeel that clings to the palate with a bit a dryness. Average drinkability: doesn't wow, doesn't offend, but fails to distinguish itself among oatmeal stouts."
"Pours a deep brown color with a good strong brown head leaving some sticking. Roasty, almost salt sweet malts in the nose. The malt character in flavor is obviously dominant, notes of chocolate and hints at coffee, the subtlest flavor of soy sauce. Smooth drinking, light/medium bodied stout, low carbonation. I could definitely go back to this one."
"D - I could see myself downing a few of these although I would most likely do it after dinner"
" A very nice stout."
"This beer is a real treat. For me it's the definition of dessert beer and something to always keep on hand."
"Drinkability: Probably only one or two in a sitting, not a session beer, but great for desert or a reward."
"D- Not unpleasant. I could drink a few of these. The overall flavor is a little watered down though."
"Notes from 9/18/07"
"Tastes excellent. Sweet and lightly sour porter malts start things off, moving quickly into bitter roasted malt with heavy nodes of hearty grain and dark chocolate. Dry stout hops come in near the end, blending wonderfully with the sour remnants of the malt. Superb."
"Overly fizzy on the tongue & palate, a sharp effervescence. Light-medium body, a touch watery at times. Slightly warming in the throat. Alright but needs some tweaking."
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry earthy scent that has a wonderful oatmeal feel. It's very bitter from the over use of black patent malts. The taste is decent as well. It's quite bitter with loads of black malts. It goes down easy and finishes thin with some lingering earthiness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a good drinking beer, although I'm not sure how they won the silver medal at the World Beer Championships."
"Motor oil black and a little syrupy in the pour; pours a light tan head that's about two fingers and it stays awhile. Sweet malts pervade my nostrils, with minor hints of dry/roasted malts anywhere. A little creamy but definitely smooth, they really polished this beer with the oats. Medium to full-bodied with light carbonation, the mouthfeel is a little fluffy and feeling, but there is still a good sweetmalt taste and it passes down the throat effortlessly and with a dry backbite that complements it perfectly. This is a great oatmeal stout."
"Very good beer to drink, I wish I had some chocolate to go with it."
"Black body with a frothy chocolate milk looking head. Head takes some time to fall and leaves a fair amount of lace in its place. Smells of licorice, chocolate, and coffee. Taste is dry and smooth. Roasted bitterness and some nuttiness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium. This beer is nice and goes down well. If it was available here I would buy again."
"Drinkability: Proteus93 put it best - it's like they tried to do Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout, but just fell a little short. It's good, but it's a little off in a number of ways (the soy sauce note, for instance)."
"Drinkability is nice. This is a good oatmeal stout and I'm pleasantly surpised. Try it."
"D: Hearty rich flavor, decently brewed, but doesn't stand out as an oatmeal."
"Served in a standard pint. Pour was all head; mocha-colored, dense and rocky with a honeycomb of holes visible through the sides of the glass. Brew was cola-colored with some ruby red hightlights around the edges. No lacing adhered during the tasting. Scents of cooca, coffee, malt and a hint of sweetness and alcohol. Taste is consistent with nose, but I'm also picking up a little dark fruit in the mix, as well as a roasted/burnt quality and a bit of hops at the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and a little too carbonated for the style in my opinion, which detracted from the overall mouthfeel slightly. Really nice oatmeal stout. Great nose and flavor profile makes this a solid offering and well worth your time."
"M + D: Decently creamy, and it could even get heavier without hurting things. Typically, oatmeal stouts are nice session brews, having full flavour, rich body, and a low ABV - this takes it up a notch, with an alleged 6.5% - a little heavy. Nonetheless, a decent oatmeal stout, and well worth trying out."
"Wow, this immediately reminds me of the Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout. The roasted and burnt barley flavor only plays a small part while the coffee-like grains and cocoa come together beautifully. The only problem I had was that one of my bottles was overcarbonated. Otherwise, it was a gorgeous black with light brown head and matching lacing with a smooth body. Very drinkable and very tasty. One of the best oatmeal stouts I've tried. Worth finding."
"drinkability - Tastey, easy drinking beer, worth a try.My first from this company, seems they only make a few anyway.,"
"I drank this one down fairly quickly and could've drank a couple more."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Good mouthfeel, but it can get lost in the taste. Not at all drinkable - maybe a bad bottle?"
"Thanks to deltatauhobbit for this as an extra!"
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark black color with a huge tan head caused by the high amount of carbonation. You definitely need to pour this one with care. The aroma is roasted malts, dark chocolate and a hint of coffee. The taste like the aroma is dark roasted malts with some coffee flavors in the bittersweet finish. Overall, this is a pretty solid stout that is recommended. However, due to the excessive amount of carbonation, I did not get to enjoy the silky smooth mouthfeel that is typically associated with oatmeal stouts."
"McGovern's Oatmeal Stout pours an opaque black with an out of control huge brown head. The aroma is nice, roasted malt all the way. The flavor is also nice, once again it's roasted malt, just as I would expect. There is a nice touch of sweetness, but mostly it's just coffee like flavors. Pretty good."
"Poured into a snifter. McGovern's pours a rich solid black color with a nice tan head. The bottle I got was over carbonated, so nearly the whole glass was head on my first pour. After waiting, I poured the rest, and after mellowing out for a bit, the head finally settled at about a quarter of an inch. Mild lacing. Aromas are of chocolate, yeast, and bittersweet malts. Taste was chocolaty, with that sweet malt goodness. No significant hop quality. Mouthfeel may be misjudged due to the high carbonation, but the stout was smooth and slightly creamy. I wouldn't mind getting another of these so I see if the carbonation level differs, but it is a tasty stout, and I did enjoy it after letting it settle."
"M&D - the ending sweetness lends a great smoothness, easy to drink and easier to enjoy, a well crafted brew"
"This is one very drinkable stout and a great stout at that. I would definitely recommend this one to anyone looking for a good stout and could easily spend the night drinking these."
"Pours pitch black with a dark tan head that is pretty big. Nose is roasted malts that have a very slightly smoked quality to it. Flavor is heavily smoked malts. Off the first sip I wonder if it will be too much. We shall see. Interesting. Something just hit my brain. Blue cheese. You know that funky edge you get off some blue cheeses? That is what I just pulled off this, and in a firm way. Feel has a full carbonation and the liquid is good too. Overall a good stout. Definitely well bodied and with a defined character. Worth trying."
"Very drinkable beer for Stout people."
"Extremely drinkable...one of th ebest oatmeal stouts I have ever had."
"Poured into my Guinness pint glass a near pitch black except for just a few highlights of ruby a huge blooming mocha colored head atop,mild milk chocolate and vanilla aromas with a drifting light smokiness.A tad prickly and a little thin in the mouthfeel department,flavors a roasty with some wood and smoke elements quite dry even earthy in the finish with a hint of bitter chocolate.Decent not great with some fine tuning it could be really good as is above average."
"Overall a brawny and raw stout. Easy enough to drink though."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, slightly filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is a good beer to stick with for an evening or just relax and drink a couple of them slowly. To be honest, I hadnt had anything from this brewer and wasnt really expecting too much, but I was pleasantly surprised that this was a pretty enjoyable beer."
"Bottom line with this one - the fruitiness - I've had oatmeal stouts I've enjoyed more with my brunch to have this again."
"Pours very black, with only the slightest bit of reddish highlights at the edges, and a big head from the pour that disappears completely. Aroma of rich, sticky malts predominate, expressed as dark roasted coffee with a bit of cream. A slight, buttery almond note lurks in the background. On the palate, malt bitterness bites immediately, but then things lighten up surprisingly, with a fruity sourness taking over at the mid. Some diacetyl on the finish. Throughout, the mouthfeel is heavier than the flavors would necessarily indicate -- that's helped by the fact that carbonation is almost non-existent. Overall, this is a decent oatmeal stout, and certainly worth a try."
"Overall- A modest sipper here. The flavor bursts through in the end. My 2nd beer from Belfast Bay and both have been very good!!"
"A very pleasant, rounded, and flavorful Oatmeal Stout. One I would certainly try again when in Maine."
"Overall, not bad, but not one I'd go out to get. A tad boring. That said, nothing major wrong with it. Worth a try."
"Pours with a five-finger plus (pour very slowly) brown head that is thick and frothy leaving a ton of lace. Totally black color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is roasted coffee. Starts with a strong roasted coffee flavor, some sweetness and finishes with a roasted/burnt coffee. Nice beefy stout. $1.49 for a 12oz bottle, Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"This stout poured a dark brown/black with red near the edges if held to the light with HUGE light brown foam that would not quit. The foam persisted a long time and clung to the sides of the glass. The smell was mildly malty with perhaps a bit of oatmeal. The taste was slightly sweet and malty with some roasty malt flavors and a bit of oatmeal and moderate hoppiness. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium-full body and medium carbonation. This was a good stout, but not as good as I remember from a sample I had on tap."
"A pretty good oatmeal. Doesn't really rival something like Sam Smith's, but good certainly one to check out if you're in Maine in a colder month."
"The beer erupted from the 12 ounce brown bottle a piceous color, the head Bunyanesque in size, spumescent in texture and a nice chocolate brown color, after several weeks, it evaporate and the resultant lace formed a nice sticky sheet to conceal the glass. Nose is sweet; coffee like with some nice toasted grain aromas, start is sweet, thick with the top middling in its feel. Finish has a moderate acidity, the hops pleasant to the taste buds, quite dry and a decent drinking beer, thanks once again to Carmen for this bottle."
"Pours ink black with a nice tan head. The head quickly settles and leaves lacing along the rim of the glass. Hints of roasted malt in the nose. This beer is quite smooth. Flavors of toffee roast imparting an espresso taste and bitterness, heavy malt all washed down by a milk/cream aftertaste. Quite enjoyable. Theres a lot of complex flavor in this bottle, yet its well assembled leading to a great balance. The beer by mid pint gets a little bit dryer and the bitterness returns. Well crafted for the style and would be a good benchmark for any Oatmeal Stout. This is what an Oatmeal Stout tastes like."
"A satisfying stout."
"Very similar to Harpoon's oatmeal stout, which is definitely a compliment. Wonderful flavors, with a very smooth, creamy texture and excellent balance. Very delicate and subtle."
"Very full bodied and lingers on the palette. This is one of my favorites although it is my first time from a bottle. Right up there as one of the best stouts brewed in Maine."
"All in all it's a nicely done well balanced stout. I'm still looking for a NE brewer to outdo the Ipswich though. That's the standard in my mind."
"This beer pours clear but mostly opaque with a little red/brown black color that seeps through right around the edges with a large dissipating dark brown head. The mouthfeel is firm to oily. The smell is of roasted coffee. The taste is a smokey sweet front with a dry hoppy finish. A very nice smokey flavored stout."
"(source: Gift; ME)"
"This deep black stout presents with a foamy head and a deep roasted malt aroma.  The heavier body justly supports a deep roasted dark malt flavor and i touch of bitterness in the finish.  Very tasty."
"Dark brown, almost black with a wisp of tan foam, not bad for a 4 oz. sample. Nice malt flavor,bitterness seemed more black patent malt than hops. Mouthfeel was smooth with a dryish finish but seemed thin/watery compared to other oatmeal stouts. Overall a good beer, will try to re-sample a larger pour soon."
"Notes: A good accompaniment with anything chocolate, flavours are well placed and true to style without anything trying to rock the boat."
