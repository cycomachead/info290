"Overall it was alright, but with so many great stouts out there I highly doubt that I’d have it again."
""
"Overall:  This is an ok oatmeal stout.  Tasty while you drink it, but completely forgettable once finished.  I wouldn’t pass it up if offered, but I’m not going to look for it either."
""
"Reviewers are selling this one short."
"Overall: pretty bad, even for the amazing discounted price I bought it for. I may sit on this one for a year or so and see if it mellows."

"I hesitate to review infected beers and I am quite sure this is not supposed to be moderately tart and lactic. Hopefully someday I can revisit this beer but it probably won't be anytime soon."

"had this beer at my hidden gem after work one nite.. taste good/ok for an oatmeal stout.. i finished wanting a left hand Milk Stout but was glad i had the chance to try this beer for the location and the time i had to sit and relax with  this beer."
""
"It's okay for an oatmeal stout. It has a floral scent when opened and poured but also carries a slightly bitter after taste."

"O: not sure if its bad bottles or poor beer, but I've recently had 3 of these from Nimbus, crossing 2 styles. I won't be finishing this one."

"T: Light roasted malt with a touch of coffee throughout. Nothing really beyond that that I get. Mouthfeel doesn't really show much effect of the oats. A decent oatmeal stout, but there's really not a whole lot to this one."
""
"Pleasurable if unremarkable. Didn't get the oatmeal smoothness so much; seemed more like a dry stout."
"O: Decent stout – a little too astringent for me."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled in 11/2012. Pours clear nearly opaque dark brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of chocolate, roasted malt, oatmeal, cocoa, caramel, light coffee, floral, mint, and herbal earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with solid balance and complexity of roasted notes with a prominent amount of hops. Taste of dark chocolate, roasted malt, oatmeal, toast, caramel, light coffee, floral, mint, and herbal earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, oatmeal, caramel, light coffee, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of roasted malt flavors with light-moderate hop presence; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice oatmeal stout. Well balance with nice flavor robustness and complexity; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Very nice Oatmeal Stout. Everything one would want in the style, smooth, creamy, chocolaty. Good one."
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thick rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, toasted oats, and cocoa. Taste is much the same with a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but nothing too exciting for the style."

"-Overall, an okay stout for a reasonable price. Good for those beer drinkers who are not used to or don't like stouty stouts. In other words, it's a gateway stout."
""
"O: Overall a pretty good brew. Not a bad stout at all. Enjoyable."
""
"this is a great stout and those who get this year round should feel lucky! luckily, we have river horse's oatmeal stout that's VERY similar to this from what i can remember, but unfortunately it's only a seasonal for us."
"Smoky, earthy aroma has nutty, yeasty and hoppy hints. It pours a beautiful opaque dark-chocolate brown with a fairly thick and persistent tan head that leaves some generous lacing. Sublime flavor has smoky, roast malt, coffee, nutty, earthy and toffee notes of varying prominence, quite tasty. Texture has good body and fizz - not full-bodied, but still impressive. Heartily recommended."

"Drinkability is lower, this isn't a very good stout. Oatmeal? No, the mouthfeel is weak. So is the whole beer, execution-wise. I'm not impressed!"
"O- Average oatmeal stout. Flavors had a burnt taste lingering to them. Not to complex either. Still an ok drink, just not my favorite."
"Overall: A mild, mild-tasting beer that's just plain boring. I wasn't asking for much, I wasn't, but, come on, Nimbus, give me something to work with."
"Drinkability - More interesting than other stouts (such as Guiness) but the olive character (while not bad) is not exactly appealing. I'd call it an off taste that reduces drinkability, unless this was being paired."
"D: It goes down smooth though the aftertaste would grate on me after more than a few."
"From notes at Old Chicago (2001): Poured into pint glass. Pours very dark almost completely black with a 1 finger brown and gray head. Aroma is equally malty and roasty. Flavor is rich and smooth with plenty of malty backbone to balance all the usual dark roasty notes. Medium creamy body. Hop character is hidden but this beer isnt really sweet. It is balanced enough. Very drinkable and hits all the right notes."
"Overall, a good oatmeal stout, though not as rich as I like. Easy to drink a few on a cold night."
"Verdict: A solid example of an oatmeal stout and yet another reason to visit Nimbus if you're in Southern AZ."
"This stout is a great example of how oatmeal stouts should be made, even according to seasoned tasters, so I'm glad I was able to learn to appreciate the type of brew with the Nimbus micro. Being that it is so aromatic and robust, it would be best paired with a hearty smoked steak and a chocolate dessert, both of which will help to bring out each of the individual flavors. In the very end, this is a beer I can most certainly appreciate, but one I most likely won't be drinking unless I have both a nice slab of smoked rib-eye and a fudge brownie with walnuts."
"Drinkability - Not bad complexity, but a little too hoppy for my taste. Good beer in general, and if you like bitter stouts, this one would be fun to have hanging out in the fridge."
"D-one of my early favorites, this one doesn't disappoint after all this time, I should make this one more of a habit"
"Had this one traveling around the Grand Canyon. A solid if generally unremarkable oatmeal stout that got significantly better as it warmed up (best was around room temperature). Coffee, some chocolate, and roasted malt dominated the nose and taste. Overall, worth a look, especially if you like the style."
"Pours an opaque black with ruby highlights. Moderate coffee head falls fairly fast. No lace. Aroma is sweet with a roasted bitterness. Taste is fairly simple, sweetness overlaid with a roasted character. Not particularly chocolate or coffee, just roasted. Finish is bitter and long lasting, something a little off that I can't quite figure out. Mouthfeel is starts thin as it's cold but gets nice when it warms. Smooth and silky."
"I think this is a quality oatmeal stout. It's not an award winner, but definitely recommended for at least a try."
"Overall: A very good bottled oatmeal stout, but could be better with more oats in the nose and on the palate. Could be paired nicely with toasted rye bread and melted sharp cheddar over potatoes."
"I will have another--five more in my fridge now, after all--but although there's nothing exactly wrong with it, there's also nothing that really stands out here and puts it on par with, say, Sam Smith's oatmeal offering."
"D - Not a bad beer at all one of the better beers that I've had from Nimbus and one that I could drink pretty regularly if it was available to me worth a try sometime"
"D: Not earth shattering but good. Glad to review an Arizona beer besides Cave Creek Chili beer. Thanks Tomas for the huge box of beer!"
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my standard shaker glass. This stout appears a dark chestnut color with about a finger of creamy ecru colored foam. The head quickly ebbs, leaving no lace. Nose and flavor are of medium roasted grains, semi-sweet chocolate, earthy hops, and a touch of molasses. This medium bodied stout is a tad chewy from the addition of oatmeal and is adequately carbonated for the style. Worth a try if you are an oatmeal stout fan."
"Very dark almost black color with a very tight head about one inch that slowly faded as the beer did. Smelled faintly of roasted malt and toasted oats. Tasted like a dark stout with hints of roasted toasted oats, fairly consistent with the aroma. Body is pretty good and not too heavy. It was a tasty beer."
"For the climate, this is perfect. However, it does lack some fullness in the flavor profile that prevent it from taking the next step. Considering the climate, this is very drinkable."
"D - Not one I will be craving, but definitely a beer I could have one or two of."
"Pours was weak and watery (watery being a common theme with this beer). The smell had some dry chocolate, maybe a hint of fruit and molasses, but in all honesty, no real smell of note. Taste was much of the same. Watery, watery, watery. Hints of flavors, but no real actual flavor. Just a really bad example of the style. It was watery and perhaps worst of all, just plain boring. Blah..."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0902-MikeM"
"Pours a dark blackish colored body, with a smallish tannish colored head. Has a slight coffee aroma, more chocolately, but not overly strong. Has a crisp watery palate. Some chocolate and coffee taste."
"Drinkability is good. Nice flavorful easy drinking stout. Quite sessionable."
"Bready, chewy mouthfeel. Fairly dry finish, but the acrid bitterness lives on in the finish. I would call the mouthfeel the coup here: not much as far as nose and flavor, but it sure has a nice heft."
"D - it's ok, I'd like to try a fresher one."
"I think that this bottle might have been a bit off as it didn't have the fullness that I would have come to expect of a stout. I would have expected a bit more oatmeal tastes and something more full & thick. I think that I'll give it another shot if I get the opportunity."
"Milky stout. Pours darker brown with a mediocre tan head. Sweet aroma of malts and cocoa, with milk! Taste is like Cocoa Puffs with oats and some coffee. Very thin mouthfeel. I mean, REALLY thin mouthfeel. This is a stout, right? Smooth, but nothing special."
"Pours with a decent viscosity, not too thick and not too thin. Even with a vigorous pour very little foam arises. What little bit does appear instantly recedes back into the blackness. Hints of roasted coffee emerge on the nose, but not much else. Taste is similar, although it tastes like watered down coffee. Very thin, not very interesting, and leaves a lot to be desired. Because of this the beer goes down pretty easily, and thus drinkability is up as well, but for less than ideal reasons. Honestly I'm kind of disappointed with this one."
"Sorry to say it, but this was a let down. Below average. Drinks easily enough due to its completely ordinary profile."
"12 Oz Bottle via footy. Flat cardboard and white toast aroma. Light salted caramels. Faint roast. Spills a deep black-brown, with mahogany fringes and rim of tanned soap. Flavor is a static, wet, plain brown sugar and plum flavor. Old tasting. Bits of ocean flotsam. Finishes in the higher metallic range. Salted. Pretty weak stout base. Body is a nip thin. Soured coffee grains. Does not excel. A bit too still, but more carbonation would have blasted through the empty body of the beer, making it even less desirable."
"Pretty drinkable beer that I certainly wouldn't turn down. Not bad."
"d: Thanks to tayner for a very good oaty stout. If this was local, I could drink these to replace the one Troeg's took away."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this one. Minor mouthfeel gripe aside (and it's far from a fatal flaw, if even a flaw at all, I'd say this one is more than solid across the board. This was my first time venturing into Arizona brews and it was a nice first step. Would like to see and try more from Nimbus. An easy recommendation."
"A serviceable stout with some roasted coffee grinds, drinkable. Dark brown with no head, some coffee grind aroma. Medium mouthfeel. More bitter than sweet. Malt or chocolate flavour quite minimal. Appropriate carbonation.Almost like a nitro tap in a bottle."
"D: All in all, a solid oatmeal stout. Nice aroma and flavor; modest ABV, too - I could see having more than one at a sitting. It's one I'd have again from a beer style I do enjoy. Good job, Nimbus."
"Pours black as coal nearly impenetrable to light. the slightest ruby tones around the bottom of the chalice. nice tan head with awesome lace. smells of dark malt, charcoal, and coffee bean. The first taste is of burnt oak and malt, followed by coffee bean and a little bitter bite at the end. slight bitter chocolate tones. Mouthfeel is good but a touch thin. Drinkability is good and easy. A great brew, the first of nimbus ive tried. So far im a fan."
"Overall, a solid beer that is pretty easy to drink!"
"Enjoyable stout!"
"Pours near pitch black with a tan head that dies down rather quickly leaving a decent amount of lacing. Drinking this the first time I was distracted by a strong astringent smell that also lingered in an aftertaste. The second one I had (the next day) had a more mild astringent taste which i attributed to an overdone smoke flavor. The typical chocolate and coffee profiles are found in this stout. I would have expected a little more head retention from an oatmeal stout."
"Thanks goes to tayner for this as an extra in a trade...always liked the label!"
"Drinkability: A decent oatmeal stout, and the slight sourness adds interesting complexity, but I'm glad I sampled it now as it might detract soon; I suspect the beer might be a little dated as the label has a notch between June and July and it is now December"
"D- I have never been a huge stout drinker, but sine it is winter I am drinking more and more and starting to enjoy them more and more. This is a stout that making me start to enjoy them. I would defentaly have to buy this one again and again."
"D: Not sure if this bottle of past it's prime.. but I really don't think so. Idk, maybe I was expecting a Samuel Smith's. Don't think I'll try this one again."
"Pours an absolute black with a thin half finger khaki colored head that quickly dies down to a layer of almost nothing. Stickiness is pretty minimal with a tiny bit of spottiness on the sides. Smell is of molasses, toasted oat, and french roast coffee. For some reason I detect some alcohol in the nose too, and for a 5.5% abv I'm not liking it a whole lot. Taste is a smokey espresso flavor with a tiny hint of caramel sweetness. Some toffee flavors emerge on the tongue with a woody taste as well. Aftertaste is a dry vanilla flavor with some oak as well. One of the smokier Oatmeal's I've had for sure. Mouthfeel is light creamy body with a subtle but enjoyable carbonation. I really enjoy how this one feels. After the initial appearance and smell, I fell in love with this beer. My first beer from Nimbus and I look forward to trying more. Good, solid Oatmeal Stout."
"Pours a very thick black, but it develops almost no head. This beer resembles more of a dry stout than a full-flavored oatmeal stout. It's not what I set myself for, but it does the job. The overall score suffers because I think it's merely solid for an oatmeal stout."
"Finish is long and caramel sweet."
"D: Good, a good stout, I enjoyed it while watching the movie Stagecoach on TCM, Nimbus had made some good brews, will have to try more of them, didn't have a problem drinking this one."
"Pours black with a respectable tan head that fades to acap and laces moderately. The smell is surprisingly robust and complex, especially given the relatively low abv. Coffee, roasted grains, a touch of vanilla, and oloroso sherry are all present. The taste is significantly lighter, but echoes of the aromas are present. There is also a slight grainy sourness, thin chocolate, and a little roastiness. Mouthfeel is very smooth, slightly creamy, and on the lighter side. Goes down easily, but could be a tad more robust to sustain interest."
"This Oatmeal Stout when poured was so dark brown, that, it was on the verge of being black. The smell of roasted malts and hops filled the nose with a pleasant aroma. There was also a hint of simi-sweet chocolate. The taste was of deeply roasted malts, hops and a hint of dark chocolate. While drinking this stout, it had a bitter/tart dryness in the finish. Not a bad finish, just an interesting one, along with the aroma and flavor."
"OK, but nothing spectacular."
"D: This is a decent example of an oatmeal stout, but the thinness brings it down a bit."
"Notes: Not for me. Lacks a solid body and lacks in depth. A good oatmeal stout to me needs to be easy drinking but not at the expense of character. This is easy drinking but..."
"D- Way to strong in the coffee flavor for me. I prefer a bigger oatmeal flavor in a oatmeal stout."
"Dark, oatmeal stout brown with a dark sandy brown head that laces nicely. Chalky, chocolatey malt notes, with sweet milk, and roasted peat. Nice. Lightly roasted bitterness up front, followed by sweet, milk chocolate, oats, and sugared coffee. Bitterish finish. Full-bodied, creamy mouthfeel that goes down easily. A very nice oatmeal stout."
"Drinkability- If you like dark stouts, this one is for you. Probably worth a try."
"D - Very drinkable, good stuff."
"Good drinkability if you are in the mood for a dark toasted stout. It has some dry irish stout qualities to it. Lots of flavor for its managable ABV level, but it is definately filling me up already so I'd be limited on how many of these I could really have."
"If I had the chance for this out west, Id be first in line. Wish it had a lil ring of goodies on the bottle bottom."
"Pours a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, small creamy tan head, some lacing afterwards. The nose is of slightly roasted sweet malts, some hops, and slight chocolate/coffee. The taste is very nice sweet malty, with some under tone chocolate/coffee. Medium body. Very drinkable, a very nice true to style oatmeal stout."
"Beer poured jet black with a fine tan head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is slightly malty with a hint of coffee. Taste is a fine balance between chocolate malts, oats, and hops. Mouthfeel is very smooth and satisfying from the oats but is not as thick as hoped. Drinkability is very good. I will definitely pick this up in the future!"
"The drinkability is good, a good example to the style. Right on. Prosit MK"
"D- yummy, but more of a stout than an oatmeal stout, high bitterness, but drinkable, though i think it missed the style. also, the carbonation was too high. I wouldn't turn this away though."
"This was pretty darn good. I could drink a few of these for certain. Would even buy it if available."
"A very drinkable classic oatmeal stout. Good session fare, especially for a stout, and would also make a great introduction to the style. Also comes at a great price. If only it was available locally, i could see this being something i kept on hand."
"D- very drinkable for a stout, goes down pleasantly, I enjoyed this one very much and would definitely buy and drink again"
"D: Good offering. Glad I got to try it."
"My first offering from Nimbus and a definite winner. A must try!"
"This beer is dark. There is no light getting through. There is a tan head that quickly tapered off. This beer is thick as well. The smell is very malty. The taste backs this up. There is virtually no hop presence. The mouthfeel is very smooth. No bitterness. The drinkability is good. This beer is heavy and filling. A good beer."
"Some roasted malt and chocolate, but the aroma is mild thought that isn't a problem with the style. Deep black with thumb thick mocha head. Very bitter and acidic in the fore with ample coffee notes. Middle is a lessened version of the fore taste with a touch of sweetness from the finish which is cream and sugar espresso and chocolate. Tasty and fun to drink."
"Pours a very dark color, almost completely black. Head is brown, dark khaki. Leaves a good lacing, and head retention is nice. Tastes very smooth and light although it is a heavy beer. Little texture, little carbonation. Taste hints of coffee which balances well. Overall this is a very mild beer which is very good if you want to drink something with flavor. I wouldn't suggest this as a session beer, but there's nothing (besides the superior taste) that would keep it from being one."
"I think this is my new favorite from Nimbus, at least of their regular releases. I've had it a number of times on tap before this, but never quite took the time to really notice how good it is. I think a bit part of my sudden awareness comes from the glass I'm using...all of the great smells it has simply don't come through with a filled-to-the-rim pint glass."
"Beer is good. Happy black stout beering."
"I'd love this before, during, or after the main course, with dessert, or as a nightcap. Or just by itself on a cold afternoon like today."
"Served on tap in a large mug. Very black in color, mediocre head that is very tan/brown. They filled it to the brim so not sure how much head would show if it were in a different type of glass. Not very overpowering smell, with toasted coffee aroma. Flavor is somewhat chocolatey and coffee-like, with hints of berries and a mild hoppiness to round it out. Its is very dry, and has a decent bitterness. Mouthfeel is great, nice carbonation, somewhat thick, but very smooth from the oats. Its filling, but very tasty. One of my favorite offerings from Nimbus..."
"The nose is predominantly of dark chocolate. The bidder sweet flavors of this stout are balanced very well. Coffee and chocolate along with toasty oat flavors are all present. Rather big and very round, the stout feels good in the mouth. A long dry finish gives it a refreshing character found in good dry stouts."
"A very worthy and drinkable stout. I would have had another, but I decided to try the porter next. I'll definitely have another in the future."
"This stout poured an opaque brown-black color with sudsy, creamy, light brown foam that settled but clung to the glass. The smell was nice and included aromas of oatmeal, roasted barley, and a hint of coffee together with a touch of sweetness. The taste was foremost dark roasted malt with some burnt overtones and a taste of oats. There was an underlying sweetness with a touch of licorice and a trace of coffee. The hops were hidden by the maltiness, but there was some hoppiness in the finish. The mouthfeel was dry and smooth with medium full body and low carbonation feel. The lingering aftertaste was full or dark roasted flavor and was dry. This was a nice oatmeal stout which held up well in the growler, but someday I would like to have it fresh from a tap for comparison."
"A pitch black brew that has a tan to brown head atop of it. Smells of roast malt, and it tastes quite smooth with a mellow roast malt finish. A very silky smooth body to this beer. Lots of malt flavors and a bit of acidity in the finish, a good solid beer. There are no super strong flavors (a good thing) and it is very well balanced."
"What can I say, as I love Stouts, since my first sip of a Guinness at St. James Gate some 25 years ago. Ebony color on the pour, creamy dark chocolate head that is modest in size, the lace a nice glutinous cover upon the glass. Starbucks coffee, bittersweet chocolate, fresh toasted grain, and quite pleasing to the schnozzle is this nose, start is sweet and thickly malt, with the top full and creamy. Finish has a bittersweet chocolate aftertaste, the acidity moderate, the hops purposeful in their spicy bite, and a Terrific representative to the style, and a sure fire favorite for this stout lover."
"Medium bodied, with a slightly bitter, malty aftertaste. This is a very drinkable and enjoyable example of what you can do with an oatmeal stout."
