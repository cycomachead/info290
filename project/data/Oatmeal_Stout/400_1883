3.27,-13.7,3.5,4,3,3,3,"Yields over two fingers of super-dark brown foam, very airy and loose, fizzing off at a quick pace, plenty of dimpling along the way to a thin surface coating left behind, minimal lacing to be had. The liquid itself is jet black with the vaguest hint of orange at the rims. The nose feels firm and in no way soft, focuses on dark chocolate, coffee, scone, anise seed, no truly sugary component involved, the oats dried rather than cooked or even cookie status, it’s sufficiently densely packed that even the roast doesn’t lift much, mild hoppiness comes through at warmer temperatures. Medium-bodied, noticeably dry and chewy, again the oats and grains seem uncooked and dusty even, comes across as semi-bitter, heavy on the roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate, cocoa and then black licorice and dried orange peels. Hard to truly peg the hops for the pucker factor near the end, maybe yes, maybe no. Carbonation seems low given the density of the material. With each additional sip you can’t help but wish it were a little sweeter with more length. No fruit nor something like caramel, vanilla. In the end, feels “traditional” but not so much a fun style of stout to kick back with and spend an evening.","farrago","Oct 23, 2012"

Instead it's somewhat overly bitter, acrid and just plain rough. Maybe too aggressively hopped for the style? Resembles more of a low ABV RIS than an Oatmeal Stout.

Maybe? *ahem* Anyway, it pours a straight onyx topped by a finger of light off-khaki foam. The node comprises roasted malts, dark chocolate, light coffee, and molasses. The taste brings in more of the same, with the roast really getting kicked up, the coffee and chocolate turning bitter and acrid, and some light vinyl and tobacco entering the fray as well. The body is a solid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly dry finish. Overall, a pretty okay oatmeal stout, but one that lacks the smoothness, the finesse, the creaminess, the softness that usually comes with the style. It's still alright, just nothing I would consider great.","TMoney2591","Oct 18, 2011"

4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"The brew pours with a look typical of a nice stout: black with a tan cap, though it is a short-lived head. The nose is equal parts of cocoa, roast, and toffee-coffee-caramel-candy notes, but it is not sweet. It tastes about the same as the nose but it adds a pleasantly acrid roast and smoke hint to the mix. Feel is medium soft and creamy with a super drying mouthfeel, a tad reminiscent of black coffee. Quite nice, overall.","ktrillionaire","Jul 10, 2011"
3.11,-17.9,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,3,"Very roasty aroma...charcoal, nearly burnt malt, and smoke...plus, unfortunately, a little plastic and band-aid scent. The beer is dry, intensely dry, with the roasted character carrying through from the smell. No malt or hops in the flavor, just a lot of malt and grain. Fleeting alcohol in the taste. Moderate bitterness and a medium-to-light body for an oatmeal stout. Not a bad beer, although the creamy, full texture that I expect from an oatmeal stout was entirely lacking.","Suds","Jun 10, 2011"

Decent but unspectacular aroma of toasted stuff, typical for the style, with a sharpness that seems unusual. Rather watery body given the thickness of the beer, with appropriately light carbonation. The first few sips were tasty and toasty and smooth-- very nice. But as it warmed up it started tasting more and more like soap; by the time I got to the bottom of the glass I felt like my grandmother had risen from the grave and was following through on her threats of 40 years ago... washing out my mouth with soap.

3.92,3.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured into a standard pint glass. The beer is black in color with a slight brown head that settles to skim within a few minutes. There is barely any lace left on the glass. It is extremely opaque; you can't see anything through it. The oatmeal stout smells of roasted grains and malt with some nuttiness. It tastes of chocolate and coffee, with a bitterness at the end. The bitterness and coffee flavor lingers after you swallow. It has a medium body that is strengthened by the aftertaste. It has a normal amount of carbonation, nothing too exceptional. It does feel very smooth going down. This beer is enjoyable but I remember liking it more when I had it on tap at the old Belfast Bay brewpub. The bottle I'm reviewing had been in the refrigerator all afternoon, so it was quite cold when poured, now that it is warming up, I'm enjoying the beer more.","ToasterChef","Jun 03, 2009"

3.49,-7.9,4.5,3,3.5,3,4,"Poured out of 12oz. bottle, this elixir resembles a dark coffe like liquer, with a nice head profile of creamy coffee foam. Aromas are mild, containing sweet oats and malt, hay and roasted porridge. Flavors are nicer than the aromas, serving up a meritage of dark cocoa, roasted gruel, blackened grog and nice sweet oatmeal on the finish. A decent offering for consumers to seek out. This tasted much better as it warmed up, and I recommend bringing this to almost room temperature to enjoy the full palate of flavors.","HiAIPA","Feb 28, 2009"
3.97,4.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Out of a bottle this brew was an opaque black with one finger of tan head. The retention was less than stellar but the lacing was decent. The aroma was rather chocolaty, with some roasted malt, light coffee and molasses. The flavors were solid and robust; starting on a note of roasted malt I then tasted the light chocolate followed by oats, earthiness and a long coffee finish. Pleasantly bitter but balanced. The mouthfeel was smooth and rich, the body was full and the carbonation excellent for the style. Though nothing about the beer was outstanding I really enjoyed it and thought it a good overall example of the style.","thekevlarkid","Feb 23, 2009"
3.66,-3.4,4,3,4,4,3.5,"A brew of impenetrable black, it gives off a roasty aroma of burnt vegetables. The taste, however, is of dark coffee grounds, with a bit of oats and soy sauce. It grows on you with each sip. There a sticky mouthfeel that clings to the palate with a bit a dryness. Average drinkability: doesn't wow, doesn't offend, but fails to distinguish itself among oatmeal stouts.","StoutHearted","Feb 16, 2009"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a deep brown color with a good strong brown head leaving some sticking. Roasty, almost salt sweet malts in the nose. The malt character in flavor is obviously dominant, notes of chocolate and hints at coffee, the subtlest flavor of soy sauce. Smooth drinking, light/medium bodied stout, low carbonation. I could definitely go back to this one.","ATPete","Feb 16, 2009"

3.53,-6.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry earthy scent that has a wonderful oatmeal feel. It's very bitter from the over use of black patent malts. The taste is decent as well. It's quite bitter with loads of black malts. It goes down easy and finishes thin with some lingering earthiness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a good drinking beer, although I'm not sure how they won the silver medal at the World Beer Championships.","WesWes","Oct 22, 2008"

Sweet malts pervade my nostrils, with minor hints of dry/roasted malts anywhere. A little creamy but definitely smooth, they really polished this beer with the oats. Medium to full-bodied with light carbonation, the mouthfeel is a little fluffy and feeling, but there is still a good sweetmalt taste and it passes down the throat effortlessly and with a dry backbite that complements it perfectly. This is a great oatmeal stout.","clayrock81","Oct 06, 2008"

3.95,4.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Served in a standard pint. Pour was all head; mocha-colored, dense and rocky with a honeycomb of holes visible through the sides of the glass. Brew was cola-colored with some ruby red hightlights around the edges. No lacing adhered during the tasting. Scents of cooca, coffee, malt and a hint of sweetness and alcohol. Taste is consistent with nose, but I'm also picking up a little dark fruit in the mix, as well as a roasted/burnt quality and a bit of hops at the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and a little too carbonated for the style in my opinion, which detracted from the overall mouthfeel slightly. Really nice oatmeal stout. Great nose and flavor profile makes this a solid offering and well worth your time.","Jwale73","Aug 11, 2008"
4.02,6.1,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"M + D: Decently creamy, and it could even get heavier without hurting things. Typically, oatmeal stouts are nice session brews, having full flavour, rich body, and a low ABV - this takes it up a notch, with an alleged 6.5% - a little heavy. Nonetheless, a decent oatmeal stout, and well worth trying out.","Proteus93","Jul 28, 2008"
4.15,9.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Wow, this immediately reminds me of the Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout. The roasted and burnt barley flavor only plays a small part while the coffee-like grains and cocoa come together beautifully. The only problem I had was that one of my bottles was overcarbonated.

You definitely need to pour this one with care. The aroma is roasted malts, dark chocolate and a hint of coffee. The taste like the aroma is dark roasted malts with some coffee flavors in the bittersweet finish. Overall, this is a pretty solid stout that is recommended. However, due to the excessive amount of carbonation, I did not get to enjoy the silky smooth mouthfeel that is typically associated with oatmeal stouts.","cjgator3","Apr 05, 2008"

The bottle I got was over carbonated, so nearly the whole glass was head on my first pour. After waiting, I poured the rest, and after mellowing out for a bit, the head finally settled at about a quarter of an inch. Mild lacing. Aromas are of chocolate, yeast, and bittersweet malts. Taste was chocolaty, with that sweet malt goodness. No significant hop quality. Mouthfeel may be misjudged due to the high carbonation, but the stout was smooth and slightly creamy. I wouldn't mind getting another of these so I see if the carbonation level differs, but it is a tasty stout, and I did enjoy it after letting it settle.","paulthebeerguru","Mar 06, 2008"

Aroma of rich, sticky malts predominate, expressed as dark roasted coffee with a bit of cream. A slight, buttery almond note lurks in the background. On the palate, malt bitterness bites immediately, but then things lighten up surprisingly, with a fruity sourness taking over at the mid. Some diacetyl on the finish. Throughout, the mouthfeel is heavier than the flavors would necessarily indicate -- that's helped by the fact that carbonation is almost non-existent.

Theres a lot of complex flavor in this bottle, yet its well assembled leading to a great balance. The beer by mid pint gets a little bit dryer and the bitterness returns.
