"Creamy and thick. Flat. Bitter. A little bland."
""
"Enjoyed it a BBQ place in Boston...."
"I had to do it...give it a try.  Who knows if one of my favorite breweries could change my mind or not? If nothing else to reaffirm that nitro is such a waist of good beer.  Maybe there is an actual oatmeal stout lingering somewhere?  I can't tell however, cause there is no character at all."

"Drank this on-tap at the source in Grand Rapids, MI.   Pours dark, nearly black in color.  Small head.  Its a smooth, easy-drinking, tasty beer.  One of my go-to beers when I'm at Founder's Brewery, but I dont think I've ever bought this in bottled form."

"Beautiful stout, but I had issues getting a decent head when pouring."

"All right Oatmeal Stout (or Brown Ale?), a session stout if you will, one of the easiest to drink. Tasty, but it doesn’t expect as much complexity as other of their dark beers, though some is likely masked by the nitro."

"O- a dangerously drinkable beer, though the lower ABV makes for less danger and more enjoyment.  2 pints could have easily become 3 or 4 with more time and less to do in the morning."

"Poured into a snifter a deep cola color with a creamy nitro cascading beige head.Some roast and coffee with a little bitter chocolate in the nose.Dryer on the palate with roast ans earth with just a tinge of vanilla-like sweetness.An easy drinking creamy dryer oatmeal stout,very quaffable."
""
"On nitro at World of Beer Tioga (Gainesville, FL). Pours pitch black with a beautiful creamy espresso head on top. Aroma of next to nothing here, maybe some lightly roasted malts, water, that’s it. Flavor follows incredibly bland, watered down roast with very little else going on. Thin mouthfeel even for nitro--which always comes off thin to me, despite the silkiness--and low carbonation. Overall, I would take this over Guinness, but it’s just not my style. What’s the point? I’d just rather drink water and save the liver."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid stout to pound down for a long time if you’re in the mood for the style."

"Figured I'd grab a quick pint at this new Tap House, and I realized I've never had this particular Founders brew before. Done. It pours a straight murky onyx topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises mild roasted malts, cocoa powder, and a touch of vanilla bean in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, though now the vanilla is replaced by a bit of treacle. The body is a solid medium, with a nice nitrogenation and a subsequently velvety feel. Overall, a nice, by-the-numbers oatmeal stout. Not bad at all."

"01/12/14 On tap. A solid, solid brew. It's all in this glass. Body, flavor, aroma, smoothness and above all satisfaction. If you're looking for anything else...start in the mirror because you need to find out who you are. This concoction has no doubts."

"Overall, this is a good oatmeal stout. The nitro makes it smooth. It was who we thought it was."
""
""
"I had this on a nitro pour and really enjoyed watching it settle. It is black in color but a bit of light will seep through when held up to light. An inch thick creamy khaki colored head caps it off. I smell flaked oats and dark malt. The taste is more about subtlety and I get dark malt and flaked oats. There's a reserved bitterness from the dark malt. The texture is creamy and smooth."

"This is one of the best beers I have ever had. I am lucky enough to be from Grand Rapids so it is very easy for me to access this beer because of being a nitro tap, it is hard to find other places. It appears to be a very dark beer, but because of the nitro, it is very light and smooth with a very rich taste and and a slight taste of oatmeal. It's definitely a good winter beer."
""
""
"O: Tasty oatmeal stout. Enjoyable to drink, slightly heavy. Could easily be a go to for accompanying a steak or burger. The lower 4.5% abv makes this an easily drinkable beer that accompanies food or good conversation."
""

"O - Nice lunch session beer, with mild flavors. I could drink a few of these easy."

"On nitro tap at 2 Bros. Pours a dark brownish black color with over an inch of thick brown head. Good amount of lacing. The aroma is roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and earth. Taste is a lot like the aroma. Roasty and lightly smokey with dark chocolate. Light hints of sweet vanilla and oatmeal. Slight dark chocolate bitterness but it's a sweet beer overall. Caramel and toasted malts at the finish. Has that nice velvety and creamy mouthfeel you expect from nitro. Overall, I'm glad I got to try this on nitro and would like to have a chance to try the regular version. Worth looking for."

"Pours thick black. Nice cascade from the nitro. Clean solid head with great lacing. Wet mouthfeel. Good oatmeal and coffee smell. Front palate is all stout and oatmeal. Like drinking a Guinness with a bowl of Quaker Oatmeal. Smooth creamy mid-palate coffee and toffee taste. Slight bitters and a balance of sweetness on the back palate. Clean aftertaste. Brillantly drinkable. 3.5 out of 5. Good."

"On nitro tap at Proof. Thick, creamy tan head that holds forever. Amazing lacing. I'm more than halfway through the pint and there's still half an inch of creamy foam. Aroma is light coffee, some light sugar sweetness. Taste is slightly vanilla, I doubt there's actual lactose in this beer, but I get some milky sugars. Mouthfeel is next level shit: velvety, little bubbles all over my tongue. I can dig this."
""
""

"Overall: A pretty good nitro take on a light oatmeal stout. Good creamy chocolate notes with some balancing hops towards the finish."

"Never had this one before, so I figured I'd give it a try. Nice nitro-pour, obsidian color with a thick, creamy, tan head that sank to about a quarter inch and held there, lacing the glass as I sipped. Pretty basic aroma, roasty dark malts, toasted oatmeal. Basically the same in the taste, dark malts, toasted oats, unsweetened chocolate giving a light bitterness. A good brew, even if there's nothing here you haven't had before. Medium body, smooth mouthfeel, thanks to Mr. Nitrogen. A pretty basic brew, but still good. Doesn't really stack up to Founders' other stouts, but it's a solid base beer."

"Tastes more like a beefy brown ale than a stout but thats ok. Nice flavors but are pretty weak. Good sessionable stout."

"O) I'm kind of a sucker for nitro taps. This was really nice... Easy drinking, with a nice flavor. You could definitely pound down a few pints of this given the 4.5% ABV. I'd go for this one again."

"Nice oatmeal stout that I will definitely get again if I see it on draft."
" Overall a fine beer. I would recommend this to a stout drinker to at least try. I was disappointed to not have experienced more of the oats factor of the oatmeal stout. That may have just been me."

"Oatmeal stout pours a black color with a large frothy head. The aroma has strong oat flavors, and chocolate notes. The taste has a nice water flavor, with hints of oats and chocolate. The flavor was very watery and fizzy. Overall it has nice flavors, but its too light, and watery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste/feel: Chocolate. Roast. Coffee. Definitely a lighter beer, as the feel is thin, yet creamy. Is that possible? Apparently so. It just has a light flavor that lets you know it's a low ABV, but it still packs a nice little punch. Excellent for what it is. This stuff ought to be bottled or something, because this would be a damn fine sessionable stout."

"any oatmeal stout on nitro gets me off, but this one is better than most, being from founders, the king of great stout in all variations. clean looking shiny obsidian black in color with a fat inch of lacey off white head. it smells bitter for the style, less smooth and sweet, more thin and sharp, odd. maybe the roast is a little heavy or something, but it lacks the cohesive creaminess of others in smell. the flavor delivers though, with a slick feeling rich semisweet stout that finishes with bakers chocolate and bitter burnt barley, its a glorious experience, so smooth in feel, and really light for its color. gentle beer, with a great nitro feel without too much body. long lasting bitterness on the finish defines this one for me, a little different than most, as there must not be too much oatmeal in this or it would be sweeter and fuller bodied, or higher alcohol, I don't know. love the sessionable nature of this with its lower abv. was this ever bottled? I don't recall seeing it, but its one heck of a good beer on the nitro tap. perfect for winter, but I could get into this year round."
"O-it's a good, easy drinking stout from founders. You might not expect more from a typical oatmeal stout, but you'd definitely expect more from a typical founders beer. It's not even something i can recommend to anyone. It made for an enjoyable afternoon drink though."

"Black with a ridiculously thick, creamy and dense brown head, this looks great! The nose is a wonderful blend of chocolate, cream, oatmeal and a touch of caramel. The palate opens with a pleasant roasted malt bitterness, dark chocolate, cream and a little honey. Oatmeal creaminess and earthiness come thru on the mid palate with a mellow fruitiness. The nitro pour makes this super slick on the palate, with the oatmeal only enhancing it. Drying, chocolatey and fruity on the finish, this is very enjoyable. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
"The feel is very smooth, a touch viscous and watery but creamy. This is a very interesting installment from Founders, good but simple and not served as well by the nitro tap."
""
""
""
"The beer's true-to-form Oatmeal Stout is supple and strong, much like those from 17th century London. But its nitrogen creates a heafty appearance and fuller initial taste and texture. But it dulls the aromas and leaves its finish weak. Its a give-and-take on all accounts."
""
"Smooth taste with some mild roast, nutty and earthy with a slight bitterness. Creamy texture, mellow feel, with a fairly light body. Something seems missing, but it's hard to put a finger on. Lacks a little depth, but it tastes good and is very drinkable. Overall it was enjoyable, but I would like to try this without nitro, just to compare. Thanks again Don!"

"Beer is medium-light in body, smooth with the nitro tap, the beer feeling simultaneously feeling smooth, thick, and flowing due to the nitro. Closes dry, with moderate stickiness on the palate."

"Black with a thick, permanent nitro head on the surface. Tons of lacing. Mild aromas of oats, buttery toffee, and general roastiness with a subtle hoppy hit towards the end. Malty, toasty, lightly sweet, and nutty flavors. A little bittersweet chocolate. Smooth and light, this one goes down about as easy as water. Pretty good, though nitro is still almost always a negative in my book."
""
"Serving type: nitro-tap"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I realize that oatmeal stouts can cover a wide spectrum between sweet and bitter. I think this may be the first one I've had that sits this far on the dry, earthy part of the scale. It's not as dry as an Irish-style stout, but it's certainly no milk stout or sweet stout. A very interesting interpretation, but I think I prefer a little more sweetness on the palate (even at the expense of some of the silkiness on the feel)."

"Overall, what we liked best about this beer was its look, and the general roastiness through both the nose and the flavoring. For an oatmeal stout the aroma stayed way roasty, sweet, and happily smoky for the style, while the flavoring showed robustness, but did cheapen a bit along with the feel as the beer warmed. The feel did begin soft and silky, but as the tasting went on it lost that bright effervescence and became a bit watery. Otherwise it is nicely contributory and actually bolsters the creaminess and milk chocolates of the taste. This is a tasty offering, and pleasant on nitro, but be sure to drink it on the cooler side for that full effect."

"T: Don't get me wrong, I love this beer. It's an easy drinker after a night of heavier Founders beers or something you can drink without getting a buzz on (4.5% ABV). For some reason, I can't find anything exceptional about this beer. It has it's moments and it is sure to please for those looking for a simple brew."

"*I was feeling a little under the weather when I tried this beer."
"I'm big on Founders beers and their specialty stouts are among my favorites. Maybe I had high expectations when I finally made the trip up to grand rapids but that hasn't stopped me from being impressed by good beer at other brewery's. That being said I found this to be a very pretty yet bland beer. It had everything going for it but it tasted like a stout for the masses. And, the feel I got from the crowed and some other brewery only offerings was that they were trying to appeal to the masses. Not a lot of flavor I'm sure anyone who's favorite beer is Guinness Draught would think it's great but I'd take a Samuel Smith oatmeal stout any day over this."
"Overall: This is without a doubt my favorite oatmeal stout. I have drank it many times visiting the Founder Taproom and I always look forward to it being at the Taproom! If you love Oatmeal Stouts you better try this. Founders PLEASE bottle this beer!"
"So as I go in and take a closer look I was a bit surprised to be honest. This really did not smell much like an oatmeal stout. At least to me it was much more reminiscent of a Baltic porter, well at first it did. It had that sharp alcohol nose to it and a hint of some dark spicy fruit mixed in. Quite interesting and definitely more then a little unique. I decided to let it warm to really bring out what was hiding in here and then came out the nice sweet notes of chocolate and coffee along with hints of lactose that I was looking for. The flavors followed along with a hint again something sweet, but yet a tart sort of fruit flavor as well. Very nice. Very rich full body on this one with great carbonation that never really gave up any ground at all."
"O- Very drinkable. Could easily stick with this brew all night. Would make a great year round offering as a more introductory brew, but still somewhat satisfying for the more seasoned beer advocate."
"D - A superb stout."
"Easy drinking low alcohol stout. Could certainly enjoy a few in a sitting but it would be easy to become bored. A very solid beer overall but it just a bit boring."
"Fairly drinkable but not enough to rank with the best. I am looking for a little more flavor."
"Pours near black with a fairly-thick tan head with pretty good retention, though nothing exceptional for a nitro beer. A bit of lacing on the way down. The nose brings a good amount of roast plus some chocolate and a slight amount of coffee. The toast is dry and quite roasty. Chocolate and coffee there. Mouthfeel is a bit too roasted and dry; medium body. Drinks quite well and is one of the better oatmeal stouts I've had, though nothing really stands out here."
"Reviewed on 6/27/2010. On nitro tap at Founders. Pours black with a thick nitro head. Aroma of sweet roasted malt and an odd skunk-like aroma (odd in a tap beer, but it was there). Flavor of sweet roasted malt plus the odd skunk (less apparent but still there). It was very bland tasting -- not bad just bland. I was disappointed, as I had expected better from Founders but this is not one of their winners."
"Man, this is tasty stuff! Served with a fine, foamy, creamy, light brown head that lasts a while and lots of lace. Color is an opaque brown black. Aroma is roast, toast, cocoa, malt. Taste is like nose and has a great bitter/sweet balance off set with a little carbonic tang that works perfectly. Body is great and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor and fairly long. Session beer for slower drinking."
"Note: this was not nitro"
"D_Super rich and delicious plus a low ABV make this very drinkable."
"On tap at Founders. Poured into a pilsner type glass. Pours a deep brown non see through color with a pillowy tight bubbled head. This on nitro? Sure f'ing is I'm told. Looks very Guinnessy. Roasted malt type aroma with a nutty type notes. Very creamy mouthfeel. Light coffee aftertaste with the some sweetness. Very creamy. Good lace."
"D: I have always loved this brew, but it's so hard to order it among all of the other, more glamorous, offerings at the taproom. Nonetheless, this is a great stout and is definitely worth a chance."
"(D)- This is something you order a keg of! Has everything great about a stout and has the drinkability of a great session beer. Fantastic flavor, balance, and drinkability?! Just solid stuff. My only complaint is where is the oatmeal? This just reminds me of an Irish dry stout to me."
"D Fair. The style does not lend itself to be particularly drinkable in my opinion. Make no mistake, this is a great beer but the style is not terribly drinkable. 3.0"
"What a great beer. This was had on a nitro tap at the bar. This had really good lasting head and fine lacing all the way to the end. The beer had a black body with a huge foamy tan head. The aroma was roasty. The taste was roasty with a nice smokiness as well. Some very slight hops taste, perhaps Goldings, as I found a slight floral fruitiness to it. Mouthfee was smoooth, very silky, very to style. Yum!"
"On draft at Founders. Pours a dark brown in color with a nice half inch head. Smell is black malt and a little coffee. Nice and creamy on the mouthfeel. A decent beer, but lacking the complexity and bombardment of flavor that you get in most Founders beers. I guess you get spoiled drinking Breakfast and Kentucky Breakfast and truly don't appreciate a well made oatmeal stout like this."
"Nitro Tap @ Founders. A very dark black with tuns of fluffy tan head.Aroma of bitter sweet chocolate,and very dark roasted grains,coffee,and vanilla.Flavoris very dark roasted grain,chocolate,and coffee,some sweet notes and oat type grain hints.Smooth creamy mouthfeel with a dry roasty finish,very good."
"Extra: A very very good stout."
"D- Pretty easy to drink."
"D: Very drinkable. Much like a typical dry/irish stout."
"Poured black in color with 3/4"" of creamy eggshell head, great lacing all the way through with retention that just won't go away. Smells of toasted malt, chocolate, oat, and a slight hint of coffee. Tastes of roasted oat, chocolate malt, and coffee with a dry roasted malt/floral hop finish. Medium in body, smooth and creamy with nice roasted flavors. Goes down easy, great flavors and low ABV make this a quite sessionable beer for stout lovers."
"D: A true session stout! Another excellent Founders beer that really should be bottled."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, This is a good Oatmeal Stout, unfortunately it is a beer that should be ordered for dessert, and I ordered it to start off with. I strongly suggest having this one to end a meal, and not to start one as I did."
"I think this is an outstanding stout. It pours a fantastic brown head that is very thick dense and creamy. This body of the beer is black. It is so smooth. Coffee, chocolate, creamy. I really love this beer. The flavor is not overwhelming or over the top, all the edges are very smooth. Overall, great beer and at five percent you can afford to tip back a few."
"Unbelievably smooth rich and creamy. Dark chocolate prevails, with a vanilla, oatmeal twist. Bold statements of strong coffee. Very delicious and refreshing and drinkable as hell."
"This one is a winner. Pours a midnight black with a dark tan head that fades quickly. Smells a little sweet with burnt characteristics. Taste is similar but amazingly smooth. I have never had a beer this smooth. The only thing close was Murphy's Stout, but this is up a notch. The taste was great as well as the mouthfeel. This beer was like velvet across the palette. I enjoyed it very much. I could drink these at any time, a very versatile beer. Go to founders and pick one of these up! Delicious!"
"Overall, a good ""break"" beer if one is sampling a few things...it's one of the lower ABV beers at Founders and despite that, has a very solid, if not overly distinct flavour."
"This was one of the best oatmeal stouts I have ever had."
"This is a beer to enjoy and enjoy again...at 4.2%, you can drink a few and really appreciate this fine beer...hopefully, with some fine friends."
"My first nitro-tap. Obviously it took awhile for the head to dissipate but eventually I got a dark beer with a creamy tan head. I really couldn't get much from the aroma because of the nitro (i think). The taste was very roasted. Roasted oatmeal, roasted coffee, and more roasted grains (i think i tasted rye). This beer had a definite bitterness to it which I think is from the grains (not a hoppy bitterness). However there was an acidity in the finish that I could've done without. A really good beer that I would like to try without the nitro, but I'm glad I tried it atleast once on nitro-tap."
"This is very good stuff! Another exceptional brew from Founders!"
