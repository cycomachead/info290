"OV: One of the better coffee offerings i've had. A toned down Southern Tier Jahva. The oats are really a great addition. Very enjoyable."
""
"Very dark pour with no visibility. A nice 1 finger head leaves some lacing. Smells is so rich with coffee. Very pleasant smelling. Some grains are also noted. Taste is again full of coffee. I loved this taste. Not much else really going on. Subtle notes of chocolate. Mouthfeel is somewhat full and well carbonated. Overall I loved this. So much coffee. Amazing."

"O: Just when I think the Floyds only know how to rock out with their hop out, they remind me that I'm an idiot by making something like this or the Mushy P. HBI is without a doubt one of the better, I'd say top 5, Oatmeal stouts I've ever had. It's my favorite style, so I'm pretty critical when it comes to oat stouts. Huge oat flavors dominate this beer. I wish I picked more coffee, but then again this beer was fantastic as is. PLEASE BOTTLE THIS BEER ALREADY!"

"O- An awesome coffee beer, FFF + Intelligentsia is definitely a winning combination."
"Overall: This beer had me smiling the whole time I was drinking it. It has a place in my top 10 beer list now. I hope that Floyds ends up bottling and distributing this soon because it is hands down one of their better beers (and that's saying a lot!). If you can get to the pub, if you like coffee, or are in the mood to try something different and new you have to get this beer."

"Pours black in color without much of a head. Nose is loaded with fresh coffee aromas with some chocolate notes. Taste is Pretty much coffee from the start to finish - tons of fresh coffee mixed in with chocolates. Somewhat one-dimensional, but pretty delicious altogether. Mouth has a little bit of carbonation through the middle and smoothes it out. Overall, this is a really nice coffee beer but a good drinking beer."
"Pretty damn flavorful for a regular oatmeal stout. Tons of coffee, roasted malt stouty goodness, caramel, other deliciousness. Could use more body for an oatmeal stout, but that's peanuts. This is an incredible beer that I wish they bottled."

"Overall, a pretty nice beer. I do like my coffee stouts a little less coffee forward, but this well made in the FFF style."

"Overall, this is a pretty tasty beer. I wouldn't say that it was great, but certainly worthy of a try. The low abv makes for a more sessionable stout. It would have been more enjoyable if the flavors that already exist were just more powerful."
""
""
""
"D - Effortless to drink this one and helps remedy my hatred for Chicago traffic at 2 p.m. on a Sunday. Revisiting would be a no-brainer, though it doesn't seem quite as robust in the coffee notes as I recall."
""
"Pairs really well with loud music and a desire to be left alone for some pensive beer snob moments!"
""
""
"Pours darkest brown possible with about a one finger head (not easy to judge with plastic cups!). Strong espresso with chocolate and roasted malt accents on the nose. Just like the aroma, bold espresso floods the tastebuds, is quickly met by slightly sweet milk chocolate and finishes balanced with just a touch of roasted malt. Wonderful mouthfeel on this brew medium body, appropriate for an oatmeal stout, adequate carbonation lends to a creamy and satisfying beer."
"Overall an excellent brew."
""
""
"O - Another good offering from FFF. This has a great nose and looks great but the mouthfeel and lighter flavors really let's this one down and prevents it from being a great beer."
""
""
"Overall, outstanding coffee beer that was totally worth it."

"T: Some great freshly ground coffee and tootsie roll flavor with dark chocolate and raisin undertones. Has a great mouthfeel. I usually don't like thinner stouts, but this one was amazing."
"Had this on tap at Pizza Port Carlsbad when I was there. Poured a dark black color with about half an inch of mocha-colored head. Scent was out of this world with fresh-brewed coffee and molasses. A bit of charcoal as well. Taste was like Starbucks bitch slapped you in the face. Tons of fresh coffee with some roasted malt and vanilla flavors. Mouthfeel was nice and creamy with slightly bitter finish. Drinkability was very high. Overall, if you love coffee...you will love this beer. I had Funky Buddha's Maple Bacon Coffee Porter a few nights ago, and to me these two beers have the best coffee profile. May need to revisit Speedway Stout since it's been a while. My main point is that it's up there with the best of them."
"A near-perfect coffee stout. So far, this is my favorite beer from Three Floyds. This stuff is fantastic."
"Overall: A very good coffee stout."
"O- A really nice oatmeal stout from FFF. Excellent coffee, chocolate and roasted malt flavors combined with a low ABV make this a very tasty, easy drinking beer. Recommended."
"Nice black color with a small ring of tiny bubbles. Its pretty thin, but does leave some slightly syrupy traces around the glass as you swirl. Aroma is a massive wave of dark roast coffee, with the flavor following almost identically, except there are a few slight notes of chocolate with the coffee flavors. As I mentioned it is on the lighter bodied side of things, but also very very smooth and easy to drink. Really is remarkable how much it tastes like pure iced coffee. TRULY a fantastic beer if you’re into these sorts of flavors... cannot wait until I get to try it again! And here I thought coffee bender was going to be the closest beer to an iced coffee I’d ever try"
"Overall, this is something I could easily drink on a regular basis and something I can recommend without hesitation to anyone who likes medium stouts, though this tastes and feels like a bigger one and drinks like a smaller one."
"Got this beer at the three floyds event at the uchicago pub. Really great event. It pours the blackest of blacks, but there is absolutely no head on this. I was expecting a bit more especially from an oatmeal stout in terms of head. Aroma is outstanding. Great coffee mocha aromas dominate, and every once in a while a bit of citrus hoppiness pops up and says hello. The flavor is a great reflection, with overwhelming coffee and coco and roasted malts, and again, when you least expect it, that american citrus hop character makes its self known. Moutfeel was creamy, light and well carbonated. I never expected I would have a chance to try this beer, but I was really happy I did. It was definitely the highlight of the night."
"Overall: A very very pleasant surprise, and one to be savored if you can find it. I'd wanted to try a dark beer (not Robert the Bruce) from 3 Floyds for some time, since most of what we get here is gumballhead and pride and joy. Lived up to anything I could have expected from it."
"There's not much wrong with this one. Not having any opportunity to get out to FFF, I'm very glad to have gotten a shot at this beer."
"D- Sip it like coffee. That's all I have to say"
"Drinkability:This was quite a pleasure to drink, but I'm a big fan of coffee. This is a great mild coffee stout, but with none of the sourness you sometimes get with this style."
"D- Wow oh wow. If you like coffee..you will like this beer. The ABV is very low and adds to the drinkability to this beer. I could have sat down and had many many pints of this beer. FFF just proves once again that they are not just another brewery. Their flavorful beers are worthy of most of the hype they get."
"A very solid Oatmeal Stout, signatured by the silky finish- but with bold coffee character. Though high in quality, you should expect a very coffee-forward beer."
"Drinkablilty - This is crazy good, I really wish they decided to bottle this beer for 2011. It could be such a great gateway beer for people who think they don't like darker beers."
"Poured from a growler acquired in a trade from cheezedawg. Pours thick black with ample tan head. Smells of subtile coffee and heavy chocolate. Tastes the same, and very smooth. Mellow drink with ample carbonation, drinkability is very high. My BMC drinking friend even liked it and we killed the growler quickly. I will turn him to the darkside yet."
"D - It's good, but I'll take a Beer Geek Brunch Weasel over this any day of the week and three times on Sunday. Good, not great."
"Pours nearly pitch black with a one-finger tan head. Head retention is really good, as is lacing. The smell is unsurprisingly dominated by cold brewed, dark roast coffee and lighter notes of toasty malt and dark chocolate. Flavor is much the same with the delicious Intellegensia coffee taking center stage. The bitterness from the coffee is noticeably absent with only a beautifully smooth roasted bean flavor remaining. The toasty malt and dark chocolate notes provide nice depth along with some light dark fruit flavors that creep in on the finish. This is a whole lot more complex than many coffee stouts. The full-body is presumably assisted by the oatmeal. The finish is fairly dry, but not overly so, and the alcohol is almost non-existant. The drinkability is quite high due to the complex flavors and absence of intrusive bitterness and alcohol. Pretty much unquestionably the best oatmeal stout I've ever tried, and right there with the best coffee stouts I've had. As this was my first beer of 2011, I think it bodes well for the year."
"D: Definitely tasty, no booziness to it, as I mentioned it goes down smooth."
"D- Alas, I've got a Sunday to myself full of playoff football and a kickass Stout. Please, contain your tears, I know it's a sob story. Totally going to kill this growler on my own!"
"D: O ya, I would drink this again. FFF strikes yet again with another terrific beer."
"Beer is creamy and finishes with some coffee notes on the ending. It's medium bodied and has a great forward mild sweetness, good body in the middle, low carbonation in the mouth and a strongly bitter but not overpowering finish. I'd have more of this."
"Massive thanks goes out to mikesgroove for sharing this one with myself, Zack, Cameron, Scott and Rich at GBX. Served from growler into a North Coast Old Rasputin nonic. Poured pitch black with a one finger tan head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, dark chocolate, and coffee. The flavor was of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and cream. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this brew was just plain excellent. Very nice flavor and aroma going on in this one. Flavor came on in waves which made my palate very happy. Glad to have gotten the chance to try this one without doubt. Thanks again for sharing this gem Mike!"
"overall a superb offering here one one the best i have ever had in the style by far. simply an amazing beer."
"For the love of God Three Floyds can you please bottle some of your masterpieces so they can be traded for by us out of towners?"
"Bottle this. please."
"Pours black with a slight tan head and a bit of lacing as it goes down plus a fairly-wide collar as the head falls down. The nose is really strong black coffee plus a bit of roast. Really, really strong coffee. Not too much else there but the coffee is really nice and doesn't need anything else to back it up. The taste is quite similar--roasted malt is certainly there as well as some strong, black, high-quality coffee. Really enjoying this. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I would like it, though the coffee comes through with a nice bitter, roasted feel. Good carbonation levels and goes down quite easily--had quite a bit of this without thinking about it. Huge fan of this though it doesn't quite compare to the Bullfrog Double Coffee, which is the brew I hold every coffee-infused beer up against. Still, one of the better coffee beers that I've had in a long time. Thanks again, Alex."
"Wow. It's like drinking coffee only better. Delicious, creamy, alcoholic, effervescent, malty coffee. It's incredibly smooth and manages to pack a huge coffee aroma and flavor without any bitterness at all. It's medium bodies with a clean mouthfeel. Highly drinkable."
"I drink lots and lots of black coffee. This beer is more or less just coffee. It smells like coffee and tastes like it but goes down even smoother. No need to get into the details except that it is jet black, lightly carbonated and incredibly drinkable. Really wish they would bottle this and send it to ohio."
"Drinkability is exceptional. This is most likely the best coffee stout I have ever had and I think most of the tasting group I was with would agree. Great nose/flavor and only 6% ABV. This would give most imperial coffee beers a run for their money and the coffee aspect is actually better than any other imperial sized beers I've had with coffee. Way to go Three Floyds! I highly recommend seeking this out before its gone."
"D: I'm really glad I had someone to split the growler with. The coffee flavor is just to intense for me to want a lot of this. Overall, a one-dimensional beer."
"As far as looks go, this beer doesn't look much different than any other coffee stout - dark brown/black with a tiny head that quickly fades to nothing. No lacing and no head retention. In terms of smell, it is pure coffee with a tiny hint of fig and burnt roasts. The taste is similar to the smell, but clearly dominated by by the coffee. Overall, this is a drinkable beer, but there isn't a whole lot going on other than the coffee."
"Conclusion: If you like iced coffee that is very rhich in flavor you will love this beer. I could drink this all day long. Just be careful you might not realize how much you drink and end up completely drunk"
"D- A nice beer that I'm glad I was able to try. Above average definitely, but if you add to the fact that it's difficult to acquire in this area, I'd say there are better beers to be had at FFF"
"Tastes great, but a slightly thin body prevents everything from tying together perfectly. It's straightforward and delicious: black coffee up front, dry American hops in the back, big, huge bitterness all throughout."
"If you can stop by FFF, you must try this one before its gone!"
"This beer is right there with the Founders Breakfast Stout as the best coffee beers available."
"This is a fantastic beer. It's not complex (in terms of # of flavors), but the coffee notes are second to none. I am jealous of you who live close to 3Fs right about now..."
"D: Overall I could drink this all day. With the sessionable ABV and super smooth flavors this one hits the spot for sure. One of the best coffee forward oatmeal stouts I've ever had."
"Drinkability? I could sip this stuff all day. The ABV isn't out of control like a lot of the other stouts. It was a pleasure to experience."
"Honestly I would drink this in the morning before I would drink Beer Geek Breakfast. This is a Coffee stout that takes coffee seriously."
"She was intrigued enough to ask where the brewery was so she could get more... I think when we make it to Chicago at some point we'll make a detour..."
"And here I thought coffee bender was going to be the closest beer to an iced coffee I'd ever try...."
"Growler shared by Chris at Halloween tasting, thanks! Pours a opaque hazy coffee brown/black with a small mocha head that disappears fast. Smell is pure espresso with a slightly sweet milk and chocolate malt in the background. Big coffee flavors up front, slightly sweet with lots of coffee grounds following and some bitterness. Somehow it is not overpowering for a coffee stout. Mouthfeel is heavy with mild carbonation, coating and creamy. This is one tasty coffee stout, hopefully they will decide to make it again."
"as a fan boy of intelligentsia coffee, i was eager to try this. did not let down. awesome coffee bomb."
"Growler provided by Chris...A few days old so I'm not going to comment on the carbonation but its a nice light black beer...The aroma and taste are both really good and immediately you can pull on the Intelligenstia coffee and the notes and remind me of BCS coffee. Roasted coffee, creamy, a little vanilla. The taste is more of the same flavors, but its exceedily good and so damn smooth to drink. This is a beer I need to go out and try fresh and I would highly recommend this."
"D - Highly drinkable for something with such strong coffee. I drank several glasses of this and loved it, phenomenal beer."
"D: nice that there is so much flavor in a 6% stout-drinks much bigger than it is. listed at 28 IBU. please bottle this-better than moloko, black sun, or alpha klaus."
"Drinkability -- The Floyd clan really hits the nail on the head with this coffee oatmeal stout. It leans hard on the coffee to accentuate the malt roastiness. Moreover less malt sweetness than in the usual oatmeal coffee stout. Robust, very well balanced - dare I say tempered? Not too much acrid roast/coffee grounds bitterness. One of the better coffee-centric beers I've ever had."
"D - This is very drinkable for a coffee beer. It isn't overly bitter or palate destroying like some of its brethren, and there's no alcohol to be found. One-dimensional, but who cares?"
"This thing is incredible. I could sip this all day. Fantastic."
