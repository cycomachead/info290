"Pours nice and dark with a descent head. Taste and smell is a little underwhelming but probably one of the best quality beers for the price, probably going to keep this one stocked in my fridge."
""
""
"Unbelievable beer for the price. Honestly comparable to any breakfast/oatmeal stout. Kudos to Trader Joes."
""
""
""
""
"This is really excellent, alwasys fun to find a good beer in an unexpected place."
"Overall enjoyable and a fantastic value."
"One of the best oatmeal stouts for the price....."
""
"Very good interpretation of the style. I enjoyed it and would buy it again; especially for the $1 per bottle price it fetches at Trader Joe's."
""

"Notes: Black-brown dark mahogany body with ruby highlights. The creamy dark tan head drops to an average collar with minimal spotty and streaky lacing. Medium bodied with a median carbonation level = smooth and almost creamy. Chocolate/fudge and strong golden caramel and toffee notes greet you in the nose. The flavor adds a bit more nuttiness and some yeasty fruitiness to the mix. Leafy and grassy hops add balance along with a solid bitterness. Richly flavorful and satisfying without being overly malty or full bodied. Drinkable, and (bonus!) fairly inexpensive."

"Good taste, very smooth, nice lacing. Can't beat it for the price."
"The color is deep, dark, black chocolate brown with decent tan head and nice clingy lacing. Aroma is very light and faint. Taste is creamy with flavors of lightly roasted coffee, some chocolate. Mouthfeel is relatively smooth, I would guess because it is an oatmeal stout. Slight bitterness, but itall comes together and balances very well. Light, pleasant aftertatste"
""
"Not much to it. Not a bad bargain."
"Very impressed with this one...nice dark brown with quite a bit of a tan head..smell is of chocolate roasted malt touch of coffee and and some sugar coated nuttiness..taste is very good!! Follows the nose almost to a tee with a nice creamy mouthfeel..6 bucks for a sixer...hell yeah...this blows quite a few other porter/stouts and brown ales out the water..."

"This is great. Very pleased with the price and excellent oatmeal example. Would get again."
""
""
""
"I like oat beers, and I like this one. I am careful never to run out at home. I like the unique flavor, and the change of taste across my tongue, from bitter, to oaty, with a smooth finish."

"Overall: The best off-brand beer I've ever bought, and for $6.50/sixer, one I'll consistently buy during the upcoming winter months. Would definitely seek this out if you're looking for a cheap but delicious brew and you have a Trader Joe's nearby!"
""
""
""
"Overall - I really liked this oatmeal stout. It fulfilled my craving for an oatmeal stout in every way. I would go out of my way to try it again. Didn't have a strong alcoholy feel to it so I didn't feel to guilty drinking it rather quickly."
""
""
""
""
""

"O 3.75 - it's been years since I had this one! Great to come back to, great value! I'll buy this on occasion if I don't see anything else more interesting at Trader Joe's."

"Mouthful/taste/Drinkability- great body, creamy texture, massive milk chocolate flavor, tangy hop bitterness which balances the sweetness nicely. Has a nice roasty back notes but the chocolate takes the for front with this brew. Great creamy body from the oats. I would of liked to of seen maybe a little bit more of hop bit. This reminds me more of a milk stout or chocolate stout from all that chocolate flavor that takes the over the remainder of the aroma in flavor. But no complaints it a really great beer and for the price at 5.99 for a 6 pack you can't go wrong. I'll definitely buy this again, I recommend you give it a try."
"BURP: unpleasant, choppy and foamy"
""
""
""
"O> Not a huge fan of TJs beers, but the Stockyard Stout is a very nice stout and a terrific value at $1 per beer."
""
"This is one of the best bang for your buck stouts, I must say. Great in every category."

"Overall, this beer is OK, but was a little too sweet even for me. Reminds me of a milk stout."

"I'm pleasantly surprised by this one. A solid oatmeal stout. Roasted malt dominates with chocolate and coffee accents. Very good on its own; outstanding considering its price."
""
""
""
"O: For a staple beer of an oatmeal stout, this one has to take the cake. Trader Joes has something special here. I don't know how they made such a fine beer so cheap, but please share your magic with the others so that they can step up their crap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a good representation of the style at a great value"
"Ostensibly, this is a cheap beer as its Trader Joe's, but it packs a good flavor and serves it's purpose as a easy to drink stout."
"Overall a very tasty beer and one of my favs from trader joes so far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"For the price, it is an outstanding stout, with a great, almost creamy flavor. It would probably go best with a dessert, chocolate and sweet, than with a meal. This is a good beer to try as you can purchase single bottles from Trader Joe's."

"Overall: I bought a six-pack of this for a beer tasting party, expecting it to be good. I did not expect it to be this good. A great brew for a slow, enjoyable drink, and for the price, a real deal for such quality. I will be buying this again."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a very dark charcoal, with a one and half inch tan head, that coats the sides of the glass with sticky lace. Smell is biscuit, oats, chocolate, worthers, vanilla, and coffee beans. Taste is starts will worthers and vanilla and finishes with coffee and oats really a nice flavor when drank at close to room temperature. Body is medium for its average size, perfect carbonation, a touch dry as you would expect, and easy to drink. This is a excellent stout and a excellent price."

"Been on a stout kick the last week and had to try this one since it had been a few years. Full body with a subtle coffee aftertaste. The flavor does disapate making it a very easy beer to enjoy for a longer duration. This may be my go to stout beer when not drinking an ipa. For the price you cannot do any better for an outstanding stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this is a nice one. More of a sweet stout than oatmeal stout for sure. But a great value at trader joes you can't go wrong for the price."
""
""
"Overall, this is a fine stout and one to keep on hand IMO."
"In typical Trader Joe's fashion, this is a mediocre, economical beer that is easily forgotten. The flavor and mouthfeel just come off too thin for what I look for in a stout. Unless I am hosting a party devoid of beer enthusiasts, I don't see purchasing this again. Also noteworthy, is that it was while opening a beer from this six-pack with pliers while camping that I sliced my hand open and got a delightful trip to the Appalachian ER. I suspect that scar will be there for life...."

"Very easy and smooth to drink wik a medium bitter finish."

"Its pretty thin and not exceptionally smooth, but easy to down for sure, definitely a session-able beer."
""
""
"O: I found this to be a pretty solid oatmeal stout, except that I would have liked if the mouthfeel was a little fuller in body. It is quite easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The oatmeal is also noted in the flavor along with dark malts and a smiley sweetness. Not all that bad but not at the top of my oatmeal stout list."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Not bad. Smoother than many oatmeal stouts, but it could use a touch more raisin flavor and some hops to kick it up a notch. One of the best values for your money if you’re in a stout mood (5.99 a six pack at Trader Joe’s)."

"Mouthfeel: Syrupy with a good amount of carbonation. The carbonation is the vehicle for the chocolate and coffee aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
"D overall this is a REAL WINNER. nice buzz too after months of no booze"
""
"O- Good but this is nowhere near my favorite oatmeal stout. It's pretty basic really aside from seeming to be a tad bit over-carbonated. Cheap but the price kind of makes it self known via the quality (I'm not saying it's poor quality, but it's not fantastic either). I will say that, you can definitely tell that there's an Irish dry stout influence on this beer. It's kinda like the cross between and IDS and an Oatmeal stout. Like I said, it's decent, but I don't think I'll ever end up purchasing this again."

"Huh…it’s actually a pretty good beer… I have to say I’m kinda surprised that it turned out to be a stout, there is a noticeable lack of hops presence in the smell, flavor or feel…Stockyard is exclusive to Trader Joe’s which would normally sound like a cheap beer knock-off, but that’s far from the truth and at $6 per six pack, this may be the best deal in town...it won’t wow you, but you can buy cheap, share openly and your friends will think you’ve got good beer taste…which is all that matters…"

""
""
"I sorta dislike the acidic character, but I also sorta love this, hahah"
""
""
"Very impressive for the source. Good malt complexity and a silky body. The acrid character is offputting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: This was very nice, but not extraordinary."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer poured a very black color with a nice chocolate head. The beer had a deep roasted malty taste and smell but is was way too sweet tasting. The beer had a bit of a burnt after taste. I will not buy again."
""
"Overall: I can definitely say I've had better oatmeal stouts. Not enough punch for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A very well rounded beer with a great balance of harmonious flavors."
""
""
"A pleasant oatmeal stout, albeit a little rough around the edges."
""
""
""
"A creamy smooth full bodied beer with a nice light dry aftertaste that brings with it some of the roasted malt tastes."
""
""
""
"And...one last note...the bottle says the ABV is 5.20%. The site is not accurate in saying that it's 5%"
""
"O: Wow. I'm actually impressed considering it's only $1 a bottle. I hear through the grapevine this was a Goose Island recipe - they did a great job here making a wonderfully drinkable stout while keeping to a certain price point. I'd definitely pick this up again if I ever find myself in Trader Joe's again."
"Definitely worth a try at the very least. At $6 you just can't go wrong, and hey if you don't want the whole 6 pack, Trader Joe's will even sell you these by the bottle."
""
""
""
"Review from 10/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a dark, almost black red amber, slight head and slight lacing. Dark malt and coffee aroma. Dark and roasted malts up front, finishes dry with coffee. Thin bodied. An ok stout, but nothing exciting. Good for the price."
""
"From the look and smell I thought it was going to be blah but the taste is really great and there isn't that lingering gross bitterness that often comes with stouts. This was very good."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Another Trader Joes 6/$6 deal, and one of their better ones at that. This is a solid oatmeal stout. One I certainly don't mind having from time to time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer overall. Nothing too special, nothing too bad. Good mix and drinkable."
""
""
""
"Overall: Not too bad for what I was expecting. For the genre it is very good. I get so used to imperial stouts that I must remember what a good oatmeal or standard american stout tastes like and this certain falls into the ""very good"" category."
""
""
"This beer is ridiculous value for $1 a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Great value, and I could have a few of these without a problem. Might be just a touch too sweet for my liking, but fairly balanced overall."
""
"Notes: I am impressed. It went for a good price and is a tasty beer. Perhaps not a ""stout", but it fits my palate."
""
""
""
"O: A tasty and easy-drinking oatmeal stout. The flavor profile seems a bit too weak and watery compared to other iterations of the style I've had, but the beer isn't bad at all."
"O: Very impressed for such a cheap beer. Definitely served well as an oyster roast beer on the cheap. Will definitely return in future winters. By far the most impressive ""Trader Joe beer"" I have found."
""
""
"O: More like a low-intensity version of an imperial stout than a true oatmeal stout. The smokiness adds an interesting angle. Very drinkable, but not the top of its class."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not impressed. Overly sweet, no roast or oatmeal... Drinkability is low due to lack of flavor - and the lackluster aroma doesn’t help. I’ll stick with the Mission Street stuff at TJ’s."
""
""
"O: Im surprised by some of the higher ratings this beer got. I wasnt completely impressed by it. It had an out of character sweetness, and a metalic finish that i couldnt, in good faith, score above an average 3. I actually like most of what trader joes puts out, but this fell short. However, i would buy this again, for the price of a buck a bottle, its a solid oatmeal stout."
""
""
"Pours an opaque black with a 1 inch foamy beige head that settles to an oily film on the top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowlyy slip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of toasted oats, cocoa powder, and some vanilla notes. Taste is of toasted grain, dark cocoa powder, vanilla, and some coffee grounds. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good solid oatmeal stout that is a fantastic deal at $1 a bottle."
""
"Overall: Honestly, this is a good beer, but it's far too sweet for me to handle."
"O - a good oatmeal stout at a great price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: Just not good, even for a buck a bottle."
"O: this is a flavor packed oatmeal stout, great value and worth a try for anyone shopping at trader joes."
"Overall, I think this is a great beer. Worth buying and drinking it."
""
"The aroma was rich with roasted malts and touches of caramel and molasses. Nice burnt and peat like aroma to it as well and the sweetness really started to come through nicely as it began to warm. Up next though was the show stopper, just a wonderful rush of roasted malt, sweet notes of caramel and a wonderful full bodied stout here. Nice touches of a campfire like roastedness really just out the slightly bitter edge"
"Overall: A very good oatmeal stout. Full flavored and well balanced. One of the better non imperial stouts I've had."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is plenty of coffee and chocolate notes, with a smooth finish and virtually no overly burnt malt taste. Rich and full-bodied. An exemplary stout, this one's worth ""stocking"" up on. A great value and a really superior oatmeal stout!"
"O: I'd buy more of this, for the price you can't really go wrong with this beer. A value as far as i'm concerned!"
"O - Overall, I really dig it. Definitely one of the best oatmeal stouts I've had, and for only $5.99 a 6 pack too! The quality of this one is totally above and beyond the price. This will continue to be a go to oatmeal stout for me."
"D-Overall this beer was ok. It had a nice flavor up front but finished with a weird smokey flavor and was a little thin at times. I didn't expect much from this beer and it pretty much met my expectations"
"Effervescent. The milk stout sour/tartness dominates the finish. More sweet than sharp, this beer misses the mark for strong roasty/dark chocolate flavors but isn’t too bad for a buck."
"Overall: I don't know if I got a bad bottle, or if this is how this one's supposed to be. I was really excited about my first Trader Joe's brew, but this is beef jerky and oatmeal...yikes."
"This brew was not bad. I was not expecting much. It pours a good black color, but a small and quickly dissipating head detracts from its appearance. This beer smells good; raisins, dark chocolate, oatmeal. There is no alcohol in the nose. This beer tastes very good; it is roasty, not too over the top, and leaves a pleasant finish. The major challenge to this beer is its mouthfeel. The carbonation is too much and too tight and it is very thin. This gives the beer a Coca-Cola-like quality that detracts from its impressive flavor. I probably would not buy this again."
"O: A high quality oatmeal stout. I could definitely drink a few of these."
"3.57"
"Overall one of the better beers you can get at Trader Joe's. $7 a six-pack and a very good bargain at that price too."
"Black with faint brown edges and a thin cap of tan/brown foam. Fair head retention, a bit of spotty lacing. Roasty aroma with charcoal and caramel notes, a bit of toffee and cocoa. Low bitterness with more roasty and sweet caramel malts, toffee and bready. Smooth texture, though the carbonation could have been a bit finer. Enjoyable."
"Overall: I could drink this stout all evening. It has an incredible drinkability to it, and I think its due to its balance. I'd be curious to know the quality of ingredients that they use, because I think perhaps that they take away from its intensity. I shop at Trader Joe's every week, and so I think I'll definitely get this one again when I want a good beer that I can get for about one dollar a bottle."
"O: My first Trader Joe's beer, and I'm very happy with it. A home run for $1 a bottle."
"o - decent beer considering the low price trader joe's sells this for, (i think $6/sixer), but really nothing more than average for the style."
"Cheers..."
"Overall it was a good beer, but I thought it was going to be really good, so I was a little disappointed."
"A very nice oatmeal stout, with great roasted characteristics and some nice traditional style features."
"This would a good one for the blind tasting. I would think it would surprise many people with the depth of flavor. Maybe it's just Huber Bock beer from the 70s. It may not be a ""craft beer"" but why can't we have more excellent and inexpensive products from the big producers?"
"O=A very drinkable and affordable Oatmeal Stout; I might buy again in the winter...if I find myself at Trader Joe's, again (about 20 mins. from my house)."
"O - Pretty good. I have had much better but I wouldn't turn down another one of these in the future."
"I was surprised by how good this is, given that it's Trader Joe's brand, and quite cheap. Not the best stout out there, but quite tasty, with great mouthfeel. Hard to beat for the price."
"This IS my go to brew. Anytime I want a cheap 6 pack that I know I will enjoy, this is the one I pick. 6 bucks at Trader Joe's. Better than some 10 dollar sixers I've had. Pours a dark brown. I can catch some light, but not a whole lot. Nice 1 inch tan head. Smells of malt and coffee. Tastes the same way, but the coffee is heavier on the palate than on the nose. Not a very heavy mouthfeel, possibly overly carbonated, but very drinkable. Possibly one of the better 1 dollar beers and by far the best year round beer at Trader Joe's."
"M: nice combination not to strong or bitter but balanced and good stout with some light sweet starting and a long final lasting good enough."
"O: Had higher hopes for this based on previous reviews. If I can ever find a Trader's that sells beer I am going to give this one another shot."
"The CPJ"
"BTW: As a few people here have noted, the ABV is indeed 5.2%, not the 5.0 listed on the webpage."
"I love the fact you can go to Trader Joe's and do a mixed 6pk and get some beers that you would not normally try. I pick up this beer because I am a huge fan of stouts. I remember this also being contracted out by Goose Island. This is yet another good beer at a really really good price. I will be picking this beer up again!"
"If you like oatmeal stouts and you like spending less and getting more, this is a great beer. It's also a great beer to jump in to trying a new kind of beers, because there isn't a lot of $ on the line."
"Overall. This is a great, easy drinking otatmeal stout. For the price (5.99 /6) it's pretty awesome. Will buy again for sure, especially when I'm feeling thrifty."
"Overall / Drinkability: Dessert in a glass. One at a time with this - it's too much otherwise. A great beer for stand-alone after a meal as it's own dessert, but I think it would go great with cookies as well. I wouldn't mind trying this again, just not again in one night. A very good beer for the price."
"O - overall, fairly decent. Definitely not the best stout I've had, but for $1 a bottle at TJ's, the quality to cost ratio is through the roof. This will definitely be a go to for a cheap but decent stout."
"Overall, it's ok. Not sure what she paid for this, but if it's in the $5-6 a six pack range, I might buy it. Otherwise, I'll stick with its better stout brethren."
"O - certainly a good stout, but not so exceptional or adventurous that I'd be excited about having another. Excellent for price."
"Overall: Such a solid beer at such an attractive price is a rare find. However, this is one of the great exceptions to the ""get what you pay for"" rule. For $5.99 you will receive a truly awesome oatmeal stout. Go out and buy this now! You have absolutely no reason not to."
"I wanna say this is finally the last of the beers from my Trader Joe's jag. What a ride. It pours a straight onyx topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, cocoa powder, and a very tiny thrust of maple syrup. The taste follows pretty closely, though the syrup is definitely nowhere to be seen and the cocoa is slightly dryer. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty smooth feel. Overall, a pretty nice oatmeal stout. 'Nuff said."
"Poured this Oatmeal Stout from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.This beer pours true to the style, motor oil black and two finger thick tan head. Head retention was only average and lacing was average. The Aroma of the beer was sweet, full of malt and oats. There was also a hint of coffee. The beer was very smooth, a little thin. There was a roasted flavor and a hint of coffee. Very good example of an Oatmeal Stout- A little unexpected from Trader Joes Brewing Company."
"D/O- Pretty easy drinking oatmeal stout here...I'd say slightly above average per the style. Thanks fdkayti!"
"Overall: This beer definitely tastes like it should cost more than $1 a bottle, which is what I got it for at Trader Joe's. I know this beer is brewed by either Gordon-Biersch or Goose Island. I lean toward GB because the label says San Jose, CA. GB, however, is not typically known for their ales, preferring to stick with bocks and other malty lager styles. This departure is quite fantastic, and I hold to that no matter who actually brewed it. It tastes bigger and pricier than it is, and that's a fantastic beer in my book!"
"Poured a dark black color with a good amount of beige head on it. Smell is very heavy chocolate with not much else. Taste is roasted chocolate, kind of tastes smokey as well. Medium bodied beer. It's relatively smooth although I'm not a big fan of the aftertaste. Overall a decent beer, my wife likes it quite a bit."
"O: I'm simply amazed that I found of beer of this caliber for $5.99 on the shelf at Trader Joe's. I'm still reeling..."
"Overall meh, light oatmeal stout, drinkable but not much body and flavor is fairly light."
"overall - Easy drinking, goes down smooth, or I am thirsty right now, nice brewed would buy it again, worth a try."
"D - Easy to drink but not a favorite."
"A great beer at a great value. Nothing in particular stands out as super exceptional except that its simply a great simple brew-- everything Guinness wishes it could be."
"D: Great beer for the lighthearted & inexpensive too. A great baby step to the dark side. Drink up!"
"D - Good and at a great price point as well highly rated."
"D - I could drink this beer all day every day; A fantastic beer all the way around"
"My only complaint is that I wish this one was a little bigger, but then the value of $6.99 a sixer would not be there. Plus, I doubt the beer would be as good as it is if thy didn't say make the best beer you can with limited resources. So this one could be better, but if they tried it would only come out worse. Grab this one!"
"D: A bit watery and metallic, so not perfect, but still not a bad experience at all."
"Wonderful beer with lots of pluses but a bit on the sweet end, lingering with sweetness. Drank with Rogue Shakespere clone in hand and it was a good comparison of two different style oatmeal stouts. All around a great winter brew - good for a glass, two tops."
"D - Very easy drinking. Nice flavor. This is one to have on hand at all times given the taste as well the price. This may not be Sam Smith's, but at $ 5.99 a sixer...this is a VERY nice alternative."
"Drinkability: Pleasant and tasty and pretty dadgum cheap. Of the various Trader Joe's brews, this is the one I'd most likely return for a whole six'er of."
"D - A really good oatmeal stout. Shockingly good considering the price. I could easily drink this all night."
"I would recommend this beer to anyone, while not phenomenal it is good. Having finished my glass ten minutes ago I am thinking of having a second for fun. A pleasant surprise considering I had never heard of TJ selling their own brews and bought this one on a whim."
"This is a very good beer, very sessionable, and once you factor in that it's a dollar a bottle, it's one of the best buys in the beer world."
"This makes it a kind of lowkey and (dare I say it?) sessionable oatmeal stout: I've only had a bottle a night so far, but it stands up to that, and would probably stand up to the consumption of an entire six-pack in a night if I so desired."
"good day."
"D - Well done TJ's. Next time I hear someone singing the praises of Guiness, I shall recommend a creamy Stockyard."
"D -- Highly drinkable, even for a full-bodied beer. This is smooth, rich, and very satisfying if you're craving a Stout. And from a lager brewer at that!"
"Drink-ability is an everyday beer for me if I so desire a beer that day."
"Pours a dark brown/black with a thin single finger of a head. Loads of bubbles that dissipate quickly. The first and most prominent smell is that of coffee, with some chocolate and roasted barley underneath. Taste features coffee notes rather prominently underneath competing cereals and chocolate notes. This is not terribly sweet; think extra dark chocolate and black coffee instead of milk chocolate and a mocha latte. Varied, multifaceted tastes. Mouthfeel is rather creamy, with prominent effervescence. Quite tasty, but what's this I hear about it being discontinued? NOOO!!"
"12 oz bottle from Trader Bro's. Nice, small tan head. Roasty aroma, a bit of bread and mild leather as well. Lighter palate, with a long, nutty finish. Easily the best regularly-available beer from TJ's, and overall a very solid stout. Try this beer."
"D - Easy drinking. Very reasonable ABV. Flavors are easy going, sessionable. A little filling at times. Certainly hits hard on the astringent taste buds."
"12 ounce bottle from Trader Joe's. Pours a dark brown with a thin tanned head. Aroma is bready with coffee notes. Light body for a stout, slightly creamy and sour. Not much is going on on a flavor side - with mild coffee and some dark fruit notes in the beginning followed by long fruity finish. Not much sweetness. It's an average stout but for the great price."
"Since it's no longer around, I guess it would be disingenuos for me to say it's great and you should get one, but it was darn good. Too bad it's all gone"
"Drinkability is good. Nice flavor, appearance and aroma. At less than a buck a bottle....a very good deal!!!"
"Mouthfeel is very malty and toastA good brew to have with mealtime."
"Color is verging on black with an off white head. A bit of light lacing, though not much. The nose brings some roasted oats, chocolate, coffee, and a tiny bit of light smoke. The taste is less complex with some roasted malt and a bit of light coffee. Pretty good feel and a nice body. Drinks well, especially for the sixer price."
"I'm not a big stout drinker but I really liked this beer. Pours dark, dark brown, near black, with a coffee-colored head. Aroma of dark fruit and cinnamon with other spices. Very enticing. Flavors include coffee and dark chocolate with a rich, creamy mouthfeel. With a modest abv this is a highly drinkable, delicious brew."
"I don't know why this beer is 'retired'. Just bought mine last month...the label is the same. BUT it is brewed by JosephsBrau Brewing Co in San Jose Ca."
" few of these. Definitely a session stout with the low ABV. Also had this one room temperature."
"A really easy to drink and creamy beer."
"Pours a nice, deep, dark brown with a thin but persistent creamy beige head. The aroma is quite sweet, with prominent notes of vanilla, light roasted coffee, and a bit of minerals. The flavor is likewise sweet, with a lot of chocolate, vanilla, and toffee, but also a burned coffee kind of bitterness that isn't entirely welcome although it breaks up the sweetness. The texture is pretty smooth, but the prickly carbonation seems a bit harsh. Overall, this one isn't bad, but it is a bit of a mess."
"Drinkability: A good stout- nothing great, but very good, especially for its price. I'd definitely be willing to have this one again."
"One of the better oatmeal stouts I've had and considerably cheaper than most."
"This is a very dark beer with a brown head that lasts a minute or so before almost completely disappearing except at the very edges. This beer has a rich, toasted, malty smell to it. The taste started a little yeasty but buildt into a strong coffee finish. It lacks enough carbonation to be very big in the mouth, but is still a damned good beer."
"Drink is good, a very sessionable oatmeal stout."
"Edited my scores since they seemed a little too high. I still like this beer but wanted to match the numbers to other good stouts and porters. It's still my reference beer but now there's room for it to be beat."
"Taste, good and chewy. Alcohol not around. Isn't too heavy on the palate, the oatmeal really does what its supposed to here. The best example of a session stout I can think of. So drinkable, $6 a 6er at Trader Joes."
"D - Out-frikin'-standing. This is one of the best stouts I've had in a long time. Actually, I haven't had many stouts lately owing to the heat of the season. This beer had me anticipating the cooler fall weather and the heavier beers that come with the autumn season."
"D: Great drinkablity for this stout, not too over done, but a good one for a stout session beer. A goto for a hot summer day stout craving."
"d - A decent oatmeal stout with a lot of roasted malts in the smell and taste. Could definitely drink a few of these. Would try again."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability: I really do like this one, especially for the price to flavor ratio. This brew is devilishly drinkable for an oatmeal stout and goes perfect with the trader joes 85% cacoa dark chocolate a few isles down. Definitely one of the TJ's highlights."
"D: The beer falls off a bit the more the beer warms. A nice lower ABV stout, but not something I'd pick up again with other options out there."
"M/D - A pretty good brew from Josephs brau, another drinkable oatmeal stout a must try. Found this one again at Trader Joe's but have seen this in other stores"
"Pint glass pour and I am met with an oil black ale with a beige head. The aroma is great. Dark chocolate, cocoa, butterscotch and smoke. The taste is sweeter than I expected. Not in a bad way. Starts off rather fruity followed with a smoke presence and finally a coffer bitterness on the palate after the swallow. A little too carbonated for my liking. A little smoothness would help. Drinkability is good though more than one is not in my future. For the price, this is worth picking up and giving it a shot. Well worth the effort."
"Overall: Overall the beer exceeded my expectations. This is an above average stout that has a great coffee and chocolate flavor. I got this beer for $1 at Trader Joes, so I know I will buy a sixer of this next time I'm there. This and Black Toad are only $1 per beer, so you can't beat that price. Any dark beer drinker will enjoy this one, I guarantee that."
"Very drinkable oatmeal stout. Can definitely drink a few of these."
"A very enjoyable drinkable beer, better than expected. It appears very dark in the glass with a moderately thick head that quickly disappears. The beer smells slightly of tobacco. Tastes of coffee malts with slight sweet edge that makes it a pleasure to drink. A very drinkable stout, one of the more drinkable I've come across."
"TJ's exclusive made by Goose Island and very well priced (almost too cheap for what it offers). Compared side by side with some other examples of the style I wouldn't necessarily pick this one as my favorite but it's definitely in the top three. Appearance is a deep dark brown to black that is virtually opaque until held up to a strong light where one can see tinges of deep tobacco and slight crimson coloration along the edges. Pours nicely as it forms a supple lightish mocha head that sticks around for the duration of the experience. Minimal lacing. Aroma holds notes of sweet roasted malt, molasses, coffee, and evaporated milk. Taste is reminiscent of the nose in every respect: rich and sweet with a lingering bitterness on the finish that dissipates after about ten seconds, leaving a craving for more. Mouthfeel is nice with a carbonation level that is not too forced or abrasive but just right. Drinkability is not necessarily high for me, but the possibility to take in a couple of these in a sitting is very much a reality best enjoyed by those with an appreciation for the finer things in life. All in all, this beer is a fine example of a quality offering without the sticker shock. Well done, GI/Stockyard/TJ's."
"Thanks BigBry for this one."
"D: Despite the robustness, it's quite drinkable (like most GI brews). It's a shame I only have one left."
"D- Nice drinkable beer, holds true to the style, warm and rich, would have a few of these for sure."
"D - After getting over the overcarbonation, I enjoyed drinking this beer. It is a good session beer."
"An odd mouthfeel, as the carbonation is sometimes prickly, and surprisingly so with a lingering carbonation, but some mouthfuls felt too thin and water like. Nevertheless quite a nice stout to sit back and drink."
"I should mention that I'm having a great time drinking this with a stack of oatmeal cookies. It has been a long time since I've last had an oatmeal stout and this beer is quickly reminding me why I love this style. Pours a dark brown that verges on blackness, with a big brown head that is foamy, fluffy, and long-standing. Aromas are roasty and sour, very much like an oatmeal and coffee breakfast. The flavors reflect all the aromas with the added goodness of chocolate notes. Finish is more sweet than bitter but the roasty bitterness and minerally elements definitely support the malts. A very enjoyable beer and a great value."
"Dark brown color with red highlights all around. Browned head is tall and foamy, with good lacing. Solidly powerful nose, with roasted barley piling on top of roasted barley. The flavor is extremely pleasant as well, with peppery hops mixing with the roasted malts to make a nicely bitter brew tempered with a great level of sweetness. Specific tasting notes include coffee, bittersweet chocolate, a hint of smoke, earthy pepper, and iron. The carbonation level is high, but the bitterness lasts into the finish anyways. Very well-made, low-abv stout."
"D - this is pretty decent oatmeal stout, especially for the price. It is very sessionable and enjoyable throughout."
"D: A really good oatmeal stout with classic aroma and flavor profiles. I will pick this up every time I go to Trader Joe's in the future -- it is very good."
"A fantastic flavorful, lower alcohol malt bomb. ALso very inexpensive at Jungle Jim's I think it was around $6-$7."
"Notes: Very nice, especially at a very reasonable price."
"Thanks to Cdkrenz for this brew, which was part of a splendid Christmas offering!"
"Poured a thick dark brown / black color with a small brown head. Aroma was strong malted barley with hints of coffee and soy sauce. It tastes of deep roasted malts, chocolate, soy sauce, coffee, oatmeal and a bit of a dry hoppy finish. Not as creamy as I would like. The body is surprisingly not as thick as it appears, but it is very drinkable. A decent, fairly balanced oatmeal stout for the price."
"enjoyed this one on a cold and dark thursday night...would highly rec. to friends and beer advocates alike...cheers!"
"Certainly a very drinkable beer; in the mouth and in the wallet."
"D: For the price this is one of the best stouts that you can buy in my opinion. At under a dollar the complexity of the palate is great and definitely deserves a try buy anyone who enjoys stouts."
"Taste is sweetish, dark toast, caramelly prunes, some earthiness, but with a dryish finish and aftertaste with lightly bitter earth and hint of coffee, along with vaguely fruity toastiness and black pepper hint. The body and feel are light but full, with faint oiliness."
"Drinkability - Enjoy with coffee"
"Very good, especially considering a 6-pack costs less than most macros. Lots of burnt oatmeal and grains. A coffee-like presence. An enjoyable mouthfeel, even more as it warms. I don't know how soon I'd rush to get this again, but pretty decent overall."
"D: First off - run to Trader Joes - this is $5.99 a six pack! I drank all 6 and I'm going for more. Perfect Fall beer."
"While I regard Mikkeller, Young's and Samuel Smith as some of my favorite oatmeal stouts, I must say that I definitely recommend this beer. Goose Island has made my #1 favorite American oatmeal stout."
"Pours fairly-dark yet a bit cola-like. I suppose its not a double stout or anything so whatever.. A lot of the characteristics are definitely not bad, but nothing wildly impressive either. The flavor has a good balance between some bitterness and the oatmeal sweetness. Aroma is sort of absent with just some sweet malt. Mouth is a bit light and dry, which I suppose other people may enjoy. Overall its certainly not bad for a sessionable stout, but I wouldn't choose it over many things."
"D- It is a very enjoyable stout and hits the ""stout"" standard well."
"Prost!"
"It's very surprising to have such a drinkable, low-ABV beer that really delivers a complex and robust flavor such as this. Very impressive."
"Drinkability: Excellent. With this beer's aroma, flavor, body and smoothness, this is a stout that I could certainly drink again and again."
"D: Got this from Trader's Joe and thought it would just be a throw-away beer to fill up the 6-pack that i created. Greatly surprised that it was so good. could drink a few of these during the night, especially at the 5% ABV rate. Try it when you find it. Well worth your time and effort. Cheers!!!"
"a nice value. is this really by goose island though? i see no indication on the bottle or six-pack holder."
"Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with strong carbonation."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a very cola appearance. It is dark brown hinting at black, a light tan head (not as rich as I would like) and was thin even with an aggressive pour. There was a little lacing, but not much of a cap to show. Larger bubbles rose from the bottom to the brim of this drink. The aroma is of deep chocolate and sweet toffee. A lighter roast smell, not burnt like many others in the style. The taste was a little more on the bitter side, which took away from the nice front of chocolate. Some mild coffee comes after the finish. All in all a nice solid stout, you won't be disappointed."
"Leave it to Goose Island to continually release quality stouts. One of, if not the, best oatmeal stouts I've ever tried."
" ~ Overall, I do enjoy this brew. This is the last of a six pack my wonderful wife brought home to me from a recent trip she took to Northern Illinois. I also gifted one to WJVII in return from his recent beer generosity. I hope he enjoys it as much as I."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into a standard shaker ""pint"" glass. The stout appears a dark brown color with about an inch of pillowy ecru foam. Nose and flavor are of medium roasted grains, milk chocolate, a touch of molasses, grassy, bitter hops, coffee beans. Pleasant, slightly chewy body with ample carbonation for the style. Check this one out if you are a fan of the style."
"Drinkability: enjoyed this oatmeal stout. i'll be drinking it again."
"Very nice."
"Final Thoughts - This oatmeal stout amazed me. Wonderful amounts of flavor that is something I can enjoy quite a bit. My girlfriend brought one over for me to try and honestly I wanted one after another afterwards. I wonder if Goose Island is always this good. Getting this at the Trader Joe's around here is amazing. $5.99 for a 5 pack. Unbelievable!!!! Stands up to Samuel Smith's (that might be better, but the price on Stockyard gives it a run for its money). Try it!!!"
"Poured a dark black with a fair 1/2 inch cream-tan head. Medium low level of carbonation. Nose is sweet oats and grain mix with ground coffee. Taste was solid and slightly more complex that I anticipated, flavors of coffee, oatmeal, roasted malts, grain and dark chocolate kept the palate entertained. Mouthfeel was acceptable."
"D - This is a great session beer. The price point on this cannot be beat (paid $5.99+tax for a six pack). Overall a very decent brew."
"Overall, this was a decent oatmeal stout that has a great price tag."
"Dark brown to black looking, but putting it up to the light reveals a dark mahogany body, capped with a small khaki head that withers away to a thin layer pretty quickly. Lots of sweet chocolate dominates the aroma. Some roasty aromas, and as a consequence, some hints of coffee arise. A bit sugary smelling. Taste is closely reflected by the aroma. Sweet layers of chocolate at first give way to roasted malt, oats and espresso. A bit of roasted bitterness drys it out through the finish. A little high on carbonation, but still smooth. I actually enjoyed this one on the cold side. I feel like you get more of the desert flavors and aromas when it is cold, then it gets more grainy as it warms."
"D: Hell yeah, this is very drinkable. The aroma's and flavor's this stout unloads is amazing. And it's only $5.99/6-pack which makes it even better!"
"Drinkability is high. A very good beer, especially considering the price. My problem with the mouthfeel might be because I typically drink imperial stouts, which of course are thicker. So this feels watery in comparison, but it might be almost average for non-imperial stouts."
"D: Above average. This is an oatmeal stout that would allow one to throw back several in quick succession, should you be so inclined."
"Another great stout, available at Trader Joe's, which of course is a good thing (Beamish or Stockyard this week? Hmmm). The pour on this is a rich dark brown that turn blackish in the pint glass with a thick, light to medium brown head. The aroma has a slight hop twang & dark, burnt malts. A nice molasses flavor hits your tongue with slight hops and a nice hint of smoke. Smooth, subtle and drinkable..."
"A session Oatmeal Stout with a twisty and the date, on this bottle, states 10/08/09."
"Mouthfeel: full body, gentle carbonation, smooth and silky"
"D'ability - no sharp edges, but something in the character of the roasty aftertaste disagrees with me. Aside from that earthiness, a nice, drinkable stout."
"Good, creamy stout. The toasted malt comes forward well, a bit like a mild English porter. Hop bitterness is mild. There are some mineral notes that balance out the caramel sweetness. The malt flavors are biscuity, caramel and roast. The beer looks good, dark, near black, with a beige head. The feel is creamy and smooth. It's a very drinkable stout with a mild yet full and balanced flavor."
"Taste: The initial taste is sort of a smokey oat but more then that a smokey nutty flavor. The smokey flavor is a little bit bitter but it finishes up sort of sweet. The aftertaste is pleasant and not too strong but it hangs around for a while."
"This is really a great oatmeal stout, one of my favorites, especially when you take price into consideration."
"D-a great oatmeal stout for someone who may not have had others that are out there. I good way to turn on those who only think of Guinness when they think of dark beer."
"D: you'll want to get at least a six pack"
"Overall: definitely an enjoyable beer. I'm hoping that a few months of sitting will help the flavor marinate a bit. This is certainly the best stout for the price."
"d: good flavor balance of sweetness transitioning into java, the carbonation helps it go down quicker for a stout. great brew in my opinion."
"Drinkability: Not as spectacular as I remember, but Stockyard is very smooth and tasty despite its simplicity. It's a good brew to sit down and relax with after a day of slaughtering."
"Picked up a six pack at Trader Joe's for $5.99. Poured into an imperial pint glass. Huge tan head. Very dark brown color. Lacing stretching the entire side of the glass. Roasted coffee smell. Light, chocolate milk-like flavor. Very smooth to drink. Not heavy at all, but almost a bit too thin for a stout. When you see how cheap these are at TJ's, one might think this beer is not any good. On the contrary, this has to be the best under $6 six pack out there. A very good beer for the price."
"This is a very good stout. It pours dark and has a beautiful tan head and stays and leaves lacing. Smells sweet. It has chocolate and coffee notes. Mouthfeel is creamy and full. I'm probably not going to pound back a sixer of these anytime soon. Perfect point for a cold winter night"
"Dark stout brown, with garnet edges. Small, tight, light khaki head. Good lacing. Toasted marshmallows, roasted coffee, milk chocolate, and a hint of vanilla on the nose. Roasted malts and light coffee bitterness up front. Smooth milk chocolate and campfire-toasted marshmallows follow. Smoky, peat flavor lasts for a while. More roasted coffee bitterness in the finish. Nice. Medium-bodied and quite drinkable."
"D - Very high! This beer is legendary and is 6 bux a 6 pack which solidifies its greatness."
"D: Easy to drink, medium bodied. Very consistent beer that won't overwhelming. Good for the price, I'll probably pick up a few more bottles."
"Thanks Bryan!"
"D- not the most complex or interesting stout, but a beer thats pretty sessionable. the cost is low, which is great. glad i picked this up at trader joes."
"Otherwise a really solid pickup, will definitely be on the look for more upon my return over holiday break."
"D: Easy drinking. Not as full-bodied as other Stouts representing the style."
"This poured a nearly opaque ruby with a bit of tan head. It smelled like bittersweet chocolate, toasted oats, and roasted coffee with a bit of molasses and cinnamon. It tasted like strong coffee with milky oats and bittersweet chocolate. It was watery with no carbonation, and had a mild aftertaste. Overall this had good flavor but not super great. It was pretty clean and easy to drink, but didn't have enough body. There was nothing offensive nor special about this beer."
"A good, smooth, and well rounded Oatmeal Stout. One of my favorite styles, and this represents it well. Recommended."
"Pours as a stout should, not quite as thick or heady as many stouts, but there's no doubt it's opaque. I took a moment and watched the bubbles rise to form a thin head. Smell is of creamy hazelnut coffee and chocolate. Taste is mainly nutty roast with a tangy finish and alcohol. I've had a slew of brews with moderate carbonation lately, this is no exception. It's a deceptively filling beer for how light it goes down. I said at the beginning that this is my second time purchasing this, and it will not be the last."
"An easy drinking sessiuonable oatmeal stout. Not too big and not too thin."
"For the price, surely worthy."
"A rich dark color with little to average head and light carbonation. There was little to no lacing. A sweet - creamy malt with a slight coffee aftertaste. Full bodied stout with a smooth mouthfeel from beginning to end. Very easy to drink and I would recommend to to those who enjoy stouts that aren't real heavy."
"Drinkability: A very nice surprise, and a brew I'll certainly go back to, especially since fall is finally here."
"I can taste the effects of the oatmeal, but not the oats themselves. A good smooth chewy mouthfeel hits the spot and really makes a great drinker, especially for today, an unseasonally cold spell has hit with snow and 20 degree weather in october."
"Note: Brewed by the Stockyard Brewing Company as per label. Apparently Goose Island's pen name for Trader Joe's offering(s)."
"D: A somewhat lighter and perhaps friendlier stout thanks to the creamy mouthfeel and medium body. Easy to drink and relatively inoffensive, although still reasonably complex."
"Drinkability: Everything started out so nice. Pretty beer, nice aroma, but the taste was approaching horrible. Glad I just got a single."
"Keeps you strong."
"Having a few sips in preparation for football season works well with the rain outside. For a six pack it works okay, but there is better, although its hard to get a good stout in a six pack."
"I bought a six-pack of Stockyard Oatmeal Stout at Trader Joe's in Tucson, AZ, more or less on a whim. I was pleasantly surprised. TJ's beer selection has included some winners and some real dogs. This one is a winner! It's a dark, creamy beverage, about the color of Coca-Cola, and tastes more malty than hoppy. It pours out smoothly, with little ""splash"" and produces a dense, creamy tannish head. Overall taste is a bit on the bland side, and I suspect the (unstated) alcohol content is on the low side. There's not much ""kick"" to it. In any case, I've enjoyed it, and will buy another six-pack next time I see one."
"Drinkability: A pretty enjoyable oatmeal stout, but definitely nothing out of the ordinary. Very smooth but very forgettable."
"Smell of sweet malt and oats, along with a bit of coffee. Nice roasted flavor, not too sweet. Coffee and cocoa, and a nice hops finish. The mouthfeel and body are a bit thinner and lighter than originally expected, but it works. An easy to drink oatmeal stout, not too much sticky sweetness."
"Paired well with pan seared lake trout."
"d: ok but not worth going out of your way for and a little disappointing in taste"
"Pours out basically black with a slight head. Can't see through it. Looks OK. The smell is faint and mostly of burnt coffee. I was disappointed here. The flavor is also somewhat weak, with hints of toast. Dominantly bitter. The bottle mentioned chocolate flavors, but I couldn't find any. The carbonation is OK, but it's overall a little watery. It was at best an OK experience, but I'm uninspired to have one again. Maybe I'm just too jaded by delicious double and imperial stouts."
"Not bad and good on the nose."
"Yeah it is drinkable. More so than many."
"Wow, bought this at Trader Joes for $5.48. Poured a nice dark brown with a nice two finger head. Smell of toasted malts but lighter on the coffee and chocolate than other oatmeal stouts. Taste similar and good. The only thing going against this beer is a somewhat thin mouthfeel. This is one of the few budget priced beers I've genuinely enjoyed and will buy it again."
"Slightly different character than other oatmeal stouts, it's far more sweet than roasty and it has more biscuit than chocolate. I wouldn't recommend as dessert, although it would make an excellent substitute for coffee. Is this my ideal oatmeal stout? No... but it's not too, too far from it. This was enjoyed with special thanks to tpd975 !"
"This is one of those beers that is great at a party--tastes great, provides real sociability, but may not stack up against the big boys of the stout world."
"D-Very drinkable example of the style,delicious."
"D: This is awesome. Love it when a brewer packs all the taste and smells into a tiny beer like this. I wish I had more."
"D- Kicking myself for only picking a single bottle up from a Trader Joe's in Vegas. As Overlord stated in his review, this is one of the best brews dollar-for-dollar"
"Beers like this remind me that you don't have to pay premium prices for good, solid brews."
"The drinkability is good, I do like this brew and would want to try it again. Prosit, MK"
"Clear, dark brown color under a creamy tan head that quickly settles to a thin topping. Some lacing sticks to the glass in uneven patches. Heavily roasted grain aroma...dark coffee beans and a hint of chocolate. Much more chocolate in the flavor, which has less roastiness and is, thankfully, smoother all around. Just a bit of black char mixes with a malty sweetness and bittersweet chocolate. Medium bodied, yet creamy and slightly oily feeling. This is not bad at all, especially for the price. Good to know there's some solid options available when shopping at the local Trader Joe's..."
"The Oatmeal Stout pours a dark brown with an off white/tannish head. There is a hint of chocolate and coffee both in the scent and definitely in the taste. This was definitely a beer wih a crisp taste to it...slightly different from other stouts that I have had in the past. Overall, a drinkable and decent beer!"
"Drinkability: Overall I've been disappointed with the beers at Trader Joe's (stick to the value wines) but this is the one winner I've found. For the price it's a bargain and is an excellent session beer."
"You can't always rely on price @ Trader Joe's to point you to the good beers; this one is among the cheapest they offer ($4.99/6pk). This is a good barbecue brew. A pleasant surprise overall and a sleeper hit."
"Mouthfeel is more like a brown ale, this would be fine it they didn't try and pass it off as a stout, just too thin, and no creamy chewiness from the oats. I am a little torn on this one as it seems a little miss labeled, but I really like it. Not much of an oatmeal stout to me."
"Got this one in a make-your-own sixer at Trader Joe's. Very cool idea at a grocery store. But, to the beer. Poured a really nice deep brown color with a fair bit of amber highlights. Beautiful fluffy off-white head that took its time dissipating. Very nice looking brew. Nose is quite nice; mostly chocolate and coffee, with a good amount of general roasted malt too. Taste is a little lacking. Not bad, similar to the nose, but not quite as strong as I expected based on the nose. Feel is a little thin, but with good carbonation. Overall, a tasty beer, and very inexpensive."
"Mouthfeel was a bit thin considering this is an oatmeal stout. Pretty much dry on the finish. Lots of coffee lingers in the aftertaste. This is one drinkable beer. Certainly a breakfast delight. I would have this anytime, anywhere."
"I didn't know Goose Island made this beer until writing this review. I wouldn't have guessed it."
"At a mere $4.99 per six-pack this is cheaper than Bud or Coors Lite bottles, Wow!"
"D: Not a bad beer, and only $4.99 a sixer at Trader Joe's, it's as cheap as BMC, but vastly superior in flavour. Question: If Goose Island can get this beer to CA, why can't we see some more BCS around these parts?"
"A furious pour yeilds an inch and a half of perfect tan head. Body is pure black letting no light through. A slight lace does develop as the head fades. Nose is of doughy coco and a raw woodsy wheat with mineral laced malt. Taste is considerably thinner than nose would led you to believe but still quite good. This is very drinkable and full of rich and dry characteristics. Includes a sweet candied malt feel upfront quickly mellowing to a nicely developed rich roasty coffee mouthfeel. A long almost wheatbread like feel is there at the end."
"Pours opaque black with a tan head that dies completely. Smells roasty with oatmeal and baker chocolate. Taste is coffee bean, lots of bakers chocolate, lots of oatmeal and much less sweet then I though it would be. Medium in the mouth and smooth. Extremely drinkable."
"Recommended, especially because of its low price, nice oatmeal stout"
"The drinkability is pretty good on this one. I'm not usually a fan of something this heavy, but this is some good stuff here. I will definitely get this again."
"Drinkability: Extra point here considering the 4.99 6 pack price. This is above average for that much money. This is a good beer to have around to use as a beer to round out an evening. Not spectacular, but I would pick it up again next trip to the Trader Joes."
"Overall a good stout I'll be drinking more of."
"If you're looking for an excellent session oatmeal stout, check out Stockyard."
"Definitely worth seeking after. An excellent beer."
"Pours a complete black with a one finger khaki colored head that slowly dies down to a thin layer that lasts. No lacing at all on the sides. Smell is great, one of my favorite smelling oatmeal stouts to date. Smell is almost like Cheerios with a sweet toasted oat aroma. Smokey caramel malt makes itself present as well. Taste starts off with a roasted barley flavor with a subtle sweet oat flavor that emerges. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. Creamy and smooth going down, very enjoyable. Could be a tad sweeter, but still a very nice brew. Thanks again Greg for this trade ""extra""."
"d: a respectable beer at least, but nothing I'd really buy again"
"Stockyard came in bottle with no freshness date. It pours opal heavy on the carbonation with a foam head that leaves no trace on the glass. The smell is roasty with a flavor that focuses on the deep roasted malts and a bitterness finishes long and slow. The mouthfeel was the overwhelming favorite for me in this stout. It had a few components as it enter, stayed and then left the mouth."
"It's been a long time since I had a Goose Island Oatmeal Stout. If I had access to Stockyard Oatmeal Stout (thanks for the extra Talisker), I'd do a side-by-side comparison. GI's standard version is pretty good, but I have sneaking suspicion that this beer would win going away."
"D- A very nice easy drinking Oatmeal Stout. Nice blend of flavors just mouthfeel is lacking a bit IMO. Also the head could of been a lot better especially due to how much carbonation. Overal a damn decent brew."
"Thanks, TheBungyo, for the experience"
"The initial impression is very fizzy. It doesn't start out creamy, but as I move it around my mouth, it foams and builds creaminess. Oatmeal stout blends with coffee porter. Lots of toast, and just a hint of bitterness. The body is a little bit thin in the middle, but there are still some very nice and complex flavors here, which makes this enjoyable and drinkable."
"Drinkability: Nothing too dangerous here.... but then again nothing special. Price is right though."
"Overall: An average stout. One to drink to say you have tried it. Some reviewers gave it pretty high marks so I guess it is the right beer for some. The stout lover in me was not real impressed though. The one positive I see is that it can apparently be obtained for $5 a six pack at Trader Joe's. If this one is your cup of tea it would be easy on the wallet, apparently you get what you pay for and I will continue to spend more on my stouts."
"It has enough taste and a smooth enough mouthfeel to make this a somewhat drinkable stout. I'm glad I only got one though, A sixer might have been a struggle to get through for me."
"A nice, aromatic, brew that certainly has enough good taste to keep me interested enough to grab another."
"Oh, this stuff is great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream - Stockyard float, try it out!"
"D - Well, it goes down alright, but it's a damn depressing effort at an oatmeal stout."
"This beer pours dark but not jet black. Some light gets through the sides and gives it a deep ruby hue. The head falls quickly and leaves a bit on the edges. The aroma is very chocolaty, but not overly bitter like some chocolaty beers. The initial flavor is bitter chocolate and roasted malt, but that quickly fades to a sweeter almost milk chocolate flavor. It is a bit thinner than I like for a stout, about medium bodied, but almost feels lighter on the end though. This is a great beer, definitely on the top end of oatmeal stouts."
"Bomb-ass taste (see ""good"") with oatmeal, creamy malts, and a roasted nut flavor dominating the palate. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth up front with a great bitter coffee aftertaste. Great complexity for a decently cheap stout. Not as thick as most oatmeal stouts, so I could actually see myself both having it again, and having a few in a row. Mad props to Goose Island."
"Overall a nice beer with good roasty, coffee aromas and great mouthfeel but a somewhat one-dimensional taste."
"12 oz. bottle- color of dark brown , with a minimal tan head - nose of mocha , harsh baking chocolate , and some floral notes  taste is weak , minimal chocolate , some roasted notes , and malt - body watery , with little kick aftertaste of coffee , and roasted malts"
"The mouthfeel is a bit light for style, not quite the 'meal in a can' type of beer, but that makes it all the more drinkable. Keep 'em coming!"
"Poured an opaque black with a razor thin head head that quickly diminished into a ring. Aroma was almost nothing but roasted barley, and even that was rather weak. Taste was actually very decent. Lots of roasted barley with hints of chocolate and of course roasted barley. Mouthfeel was pretty much right on par for the style, slight carbonation with slightly noticeable alcohol. This is a drinkable beer, just not very high on my list, it is worth the 92 cents I paid for it at Trader Joe's."
"Worth every penny. This will be part of my regular rotation."
"Overall, not a bad beer. Dark black color, opaque, with a very roasty nose to it. The roast continues in the taste, but one dimensional for the most part, and the mouthfeel is a bit watery, thin. Smooth and easy to drink, it is a very solid stout but is missing some of the creaminess that should come with the oatmeal. Too dry as well with more of a n Irish Stout coffee finish. Not bad."
"Pours dark brown almost black, minimal head and no lacing. Aroma of heavy malt, MAYBE oatmeal. The mouthfeel was a little light for the style. Very crisp. Good for the price. I'd drink again."
"Anyways, this is so cheap and good enough to try for yourself."
"For I believe $5 a sixer I can't say a bad word about the cost benefit margin of this beer. Easy to drink, doesn't push your palate too far in any direction and it fills that need for a stout, a lighter to medium end stout in heaviness."
"D - This is a pretty good oatmeal stout. Not the best but certainly not the worst."
"Very drinkable for an oatmeal stout, and at 5% you can have a little more than others of this style."
"D: Kind of tasty, goes down easy, not as filling you would expect from the style. I drank the bottle that I had rather quickly, but if I’m going to go for an Oatmeal Stout, I would probably go for one that’s a bit more viscous and has a little more flavor."
"Pours a black on the outside, but a bark brown, garnet on the inside. This inner color can only be revieled when you hold the beer to the light. Only then can you see the awesome carbonation that you can defiently feel later. The head is a little lacking for a great looking oatmeal stout. Consistent, but thin. The aroma is strong of oaty malts and mild hops mixed very well for the aroma. The taste is vibrant and envigerating with with its great balance of malts and oats. Plus the great carbonation really heightens the tastes of this beer. I could drink this stuff all day."
"As noted, the mouthfeel is both on the thin and flat side. That hurts the beer the most as the flavor is solid and the drinkability screams session. One of the best value buys I'm yet to find."
"overall: i have only minor complaints about this beer (its mouthfeel), but for $5 per six pack, this stuff is an absolute blessing for fans of stouts."
"Okay drinkability, nothing that stands out too much. I could put a few of these back at a sitting but I'm a one beer kind of guy so I like the one I do have to be more substantial."
"Mouth is just as silky as I would hope a Oatmeal stout would be. I'd also have to say that a lover of stouts should buy this by the crate. A true blessing to devotees of the stout."
"A tasty Oatmeal Stout that is definitely one easy drinker."
"If Bud did a stout, here it is."
"Pours a three finger light tan head that fades to a ring leaving some lace. Almost black color. Light carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Sweet malty nose. Starts with coffee/chocolate flavor, then oats, quiet finish no bitterness. Still fresh after brewed July 2005. $1.00 for a 12oz bottle from Liquid Solutions Tigard, Or."
"D: mellow alcohol content and lots of flavor, easy enough to drink two befre the richness does you in."
"Notes: Can't beat the price per quality ratio here. Cheap and pretty much a decent oatmeal stout in my opinion. A worthy addition to the session beer fridge."
"I have two questions about this beer. First, the Irish have a strong tradition in oatmeal stouts? Secondly, what is Stockyard Brewing Company? Is it another Gordon Biersch contract brew for Trader Joes? Oh, Stockyard is Goose Island (we get those out here?). Dark pour, frothy tan head, leaving a thin layer through the last slip. The nose has coffee, dark chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, and oatmeal. It starts off smooth with sweet malts and chocolate, then roasted malts and coffee lead into a dry, bitter finish. This is mighty quaffable for a sweet oatmeal stout. Totally worth $5 for the impulsive six-pack."
"The beer pours a nice, dark brown color. Not too much carbonation or much of a head to it. It has a good roasted coffee/oat/malt smell, and it pretty much tastes the same way with a good, full flavor. There's a slight bitter coffee aftertaste, but it doesn't last too long. It's a very smooth drinkable beer, looks like I'll have to go to Trader Joe's more often to pick some up. For $4.99, it's a pretty good deal for a good beer."
"Purchased at Trader Joe's in Cambridge. Darrk pour, with an amber-black cloudlike head. Smell is a graet mix of smoke, coffee, malt with a hop undertone. Taste presents a malty sweetness on the front, with and oatmeal/smoky smoothness that finishes in a light smkoy bite. This brew is very smooth and rounded, the aotmeal is there in the right balance. Finish is nice, dry. Mouthfeel has a great chewiness that complements the smooth quality."
"The taste is a fairly decent blend of malt and hops with a nice bitterness in the backend. The burnt malt adds some coffee flavoring. Pretty smooth and typical for the style."
"I wonder why those Geese are trying to hide this beauty of a gander. Picked up a sixer at Trader Joes for $4.99 or so. A steal! I love stout and this one was exceptionally smooth (good ol' oatmeal) and much more drinkable than your average variety of the black stuff. Rich with maltey goodness, but not overpowering in the least. I didn't catch an ABV on the label, but whatever it was, both my palette and my constitution were very pleased after a couple bottles. I actually felt a bit lonely once it was gone. I'll see you again soon, buddy."
"Darkest of brown coloured ale,lovelly looking massive frothy dark tan head. The arma is a bit subdued but the roasty,oaty aroma is detected, very pleasant. Quite a nice taste, nice and toasty, oats detectabel, thick maltiness, flavours of dark semi-sweet chocolate and coffee hints. Nice on the palate, semi-thick and smooth. Best TJ beer so far..very good drinkability and a cracking good price ."
"i'd have this again, but i dont know if i'd buy it (although my wife said it was super cheap)."
"When poured into a mug it came out a dark brown color with plenty of ruby highlights through it. I just got a little skim of tan colored foam that dissipated fast into some lace around the glass. I just got a faint aroma of some dark roasted coffee beans with some malt in the background. The taste was that of bitter dark roasted coffee beans, little dark chocolate, and some oatmeal in the background. I thought there should be a bit more oatmeal in the taste and less bitter, but I can't complain it was still good. The mouthfeel was a bit on the light side. It wasn't too watery and also at the end there was just a slight dry bitter aftertaste. Maybe not the best Oatmeal Stout but had one best prices around. It only cost $5.00 for a six-pack at Trader Joe's. A very drinkable brew!"
"Pours out to a dark black color with a fair 1/2 inch cream-tan head of foam. Medium low level of carbonation. Aromas of sweet oats and grain mix with ground coffee and earth. Taste was solid and slightly more complex that I anticipated; flavors of coffee, oatmeal, roasted malts, grain and dark chocolate kept the palate entertained. Mouthfeel was acceptable; I prefer my oatmeal stouts to be chewy, thick and dense, while this was more light and crisp. Overall this is a pretty drinkable brew. When you factor in the cost (5 bucks a sixer) you can't go wrong."
"Very chewy, a real mouthful. Perhaps slightly over carbonated, gives a bit of a fuzzy edge to what is mostly a very soft sensation. Still, crisp aftertaste and (I am assuming) low to moderate alchol content makes this a good session brew."
"I recommend this stout. It is a good drinking beer, nothing that you have to think too hard about, and at $4.99 a sixer you just can't beat it. An incredible bargain."
"Cheap price at Trader Joe's. I'd like to keep this one in the fridge for those long, relaxing fall and winter evenings. Give me this and a chocolate brownie and I'm in heaven"
"Taste was a smooth with a powerfull taste of chocolate, nut and roasted malts. A rather bitter end and coffee like aftertaste."
"Pours a deep brown-black hue, with little head, but delicate tan lacing. The aroma is intoxicating by itself. Rich roasted malt, with strong notes of brown sugar. Mouthfeel is a little more watery than I was hoping for. That's made up for by a full flavor, where the malt shines and the oatmeal comes through. Not too heavy, but truly rich. A great after-dinner beer."
"Comments  A super-big BA thanks to my good buddy skyhand for bringing this back from her visit to PA."
"I love how this beer looks, opaque brown with an ample beige froth. Head dissapates quickly, though lacing is pretty impressive. It doesn't really have a smell, just a faint hint of chocolate, but the taste is very smooth, a great roasted taste. An interesting mix of bitterness and sweetness. Very easy to drink if you like the style, I highly reccomend if you're looking for a cheap stout. (from Trade Joe's)Could drink a few of them when I'm in the mood."
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, yet malty scent that boasts of oats, chocolate, crystal, and roasted malts. It's earthy with a slightly sweet aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a very smooth, malty flavor. It goes down with a roasted and chocolate malt taste and finishes with a dry oatmeal flavor. It's earthy with a chocolate edge. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a good OS. It has a flavorful malt bill; highly drinkable."
"For 5 bucks a sixer at Trader Joes, this Oatmeal stout cannot be beat."
"This is fine. Went well with KIll Bill part 1 (better than the movie). I'll drink this again, but I'll pass on the movie."
"A good beer except, perhaps, for a little over the top coffee-ness. Pours a proper black body under a thin tan head. Extremely bitter coffee smell and taste. But somewhere in there, I was getting an iompression of toasted marshmallows and capuccino Jelly Bellys. I got this bottle at the brewery, but Its otherwise sold in the Trader Joes chain."
"Pours black with a tan head. Wow. Smells a lot like coffee with some chocolate notes. Tastes like it smells - which isn't a bad thing! Nice bitter espresso aftertaste and not too sweet either, which is a nice change from the bigger stouts. Could be called a porter...the mouthfeel is nice and smooth. Overall this is a very drinkable stout, not too be looked down upon in any way!"
"Drinkability- Not bad at all for an oatmeal stout. The smoky texture and high bitterness caught me off gaurd a bit, but overal a pretty decent brew."
"Tasting: The predominant flavor on the tongue is coffee. There are hints of roasted malts and chocolate as well. This is a rather sweet beverage. It comes across very smoothly on the tongue as well. If one is a fan of coffee, then this beer will be great for a ""session."" I see this beer as having potential crossover potential for people looking to explore the world of stouts. I definitely recommend it!"
"Pours out to a jet black in the glass with a moderate sized head. Aroma is that of roasted malt and grain. The taste is that of coffee infused with a slight dose of bittersweet chocolate. A slight bit on the thin side, but in no way does it detract. Finishes quite easily with a nice does of coffee and chocolate on the way down. For $4.99 a six pack at Trader Joe's, this is a steal. Goose Island, er, uh, Stockyard Brewery, ya done good. While its not a Rogue Shakespeare it is still a very solid oatmeal stout."
"Pours black with a tan head and is leaving a gentle lacing down my glass. Nose is of malts and a mild trace of coffee. The taste was very well put together! When it first hit my tounge it hit with a creamy but roasted chocolate coffee sensation that lingered until the dry hop finale blasted me. This is wonderfully creamy but it is a tad bit thin for the style. Overall drinkability is very good as I would definitely by this again for the price I paid!"
"Pours a deep dark brown, but not quite black, with a tiny, quickly disappating light brown head. Aromas of coffee, chocolate and roasted malts combine nicely to create a nice, inviting nose. Palate is a continuation fo the nose, with mocha and carbonation adding a nice dry component. Slight cola flavors also noticable. Mouthfeel is light, on the dry side, but with a lingering finish. Oatmeal adds a nice roundness and softness throughout. A very drinkable stout, IMO. Good flavor profile and mild finish. Worth trying anytime."
"It poured a dark, dark brown with hardly any foam what so ever. The smell of roasted malts filled the nose. The taste was of roasted malts and chocolate. There was also a slight hint of a spicy nature, but just a slight hint. The overall taste of this stout was just a bit over average. There was just something missing that I couldn't put my finger on. Kind of a lack luster finnish, maybe!"
"Pour dark brown with a healthy tan head. The aroma is filled with roasted malt and oats. It simply tastes as an oatmeal stout should. The sturdy burnt oats floats smoothly into a bitter finish. All in all a great beer. The fact that it goes for $4.99 at Trader Joes' is pure icing."
"A side note: My finace treated me to a sixer of this for my 35th birthday --she couldn't have picked a more pleasant surprise! I'm going to savor a bottle each week for the next six..."
"A very enjoyable oatmeal stout. A bit drier than I expect from the style, with less sweetness, but that really suits me fine. For the price, I'd make this a regular in my fridge. I'd get it even if it were more expensive. Good stout."
"Overall: Pretty decent and tasty offering that is great value for money, worth dropping less than the $5 for a Six-Pack that Trader Joes requested for this. Excellent Value."
"Pours a pitch black color with a large tan head that leaves a nice lace. Aromas are extremely roasty, with a nice coffee backing and only a hint of oats. The flavor to this brew goes right along with the aromas. Initially there is an astrigent roastiness that just dominates the flavor profile. Following there is a just a light oat like flavor that adds just a hint of sweetness but a fairly strong coffee flavor quickly overwhelms it. The finish to the brews is slightly bitter with just a final roasty flavor and a bit of chocolate. The mouthfeel to this brew is fairly medium bodied, with a light carbonation that tickles the tongue. A fairly drinkable brew but just a bit too roasty for me and a little on the one dimensional side."
"This beer was a pleasant surprise. Pours a very dark brown (almost black) that is not quite opaque. Medium thick beige head and thin lacing. Nice coffee and chocolate aroma. The body is not very thick but is very smooth and drinkable. Roasted coffee, sweet chocolate and malt flavors. The finish is lightly bitter with a lingering coffee aftertaste. Easily the best Trader Joes beer I have tried and a pretty good Stout to boot."
"Solid Oatmeal stout at a really good price."
"Overall, this is a decent, if not great, oatmeal stout. It's real nice considering the price of $4.95 a six-pack. A nice find at TJ's."
"A good brew for the price and it's brewed by Goose Island exclusively for Trader Joe's. Hints of chocolate and tobacco come through with further tasting. This would be a good beer to have with dessert. A good stout overall, but it wouldn't be my first choice."
"A nice alternative for a lighter lager or pils, Stockyard's Oatmeal Stout is quite drinkable in record summer heat."
"Pours a very dark brown. A modest beige head is seen briefly before it dissipates. Coffee aroma with hints of burnt mollasses. Tastes largely of coffee and roasted malt flavor with a smooth, thin finish. Maybe a bit bland for an oatmeal stout, but very drinkable, and well worth the 4.99 for a sixpack at trader joe's."
"Drinkability: Not bad. Goes down smooth but again, if you are new to the oatmeal stout world, this is not the one to start with. Sam Smith's is where I would go. This is the ""light"" version of oatmeal stouts."
" Overall, I tend to discount some of the other factors and home in on taste. And I like this one. Perhaps that's because I prefer Porter to Stout... this is close to Porter."
"Great buy at this price when most of my stouts range upwards of $2 for a 12 ounce bottle. Not a great beer, but very good for the money. Super when matched to a piece of Christmas milk chocolate."
"Nice creamy soft mouthfeel. Easy drinking stout. You can drink this one all night."
"It looked solid enough and the aroma was there, but this was an oatmeal stout from trader joe's for 79 cents a bottle. There had to be something wrong with the taste or something. Nope. This was great! Three dominant flavors of oats, coffee, and roasted malts. Not too complex, a bit thin for a stout, and somewhat bitter. But it was still a great beer. I had a few by themselves then a few with some brats and they actually paired well to me. This rivals Arcadia Imperial Stout and Hennepin for the best taste to price ratio."
"Overall, a good beer, but too much bitter coffee flavor for my liking."
"Stockyard: An oatmeal stout from Trader Joes (Hey, Jackndan went to Trader Joe’s). Pure black, with garnet highlights when held to a bright light. A tannish head that disappeared pretty damn quickly. Had a typical oatmeal stout aroma, i.e. lightly browned coffee and caramel. The taste is fairly faithful to the style, sweet malts opening up to dark chocolate. However, the smoothness of an oatmeal stout is missing, and has more carbonation than I would have liked. However, fairly inexpensive, easy enough to drink. If you are in Trader Joe’s I go for this one."
"An excellent oatmel stout available at Trader Joes for 4.99/six. For that price, it has it all over Samuel Smith's...."
"Pours to a very dark, almost black body.  Has hints of ruby red when held up to a light.  Nice thick tan head.  Good retention.  Wonderful aroma of roasted coffee and creamy chocolate.  Rich taste of roasted malt - the oats are really apparent, yet not overpowering.  Also notes of coffee and chocolate.  Good creamy mouthfeel, but not quite as thick as I'd like.  Very pleasant brew to drink.  Wonderful with Sunday breakfast."
"Shiny midnight black color, with a fully stocked rich tan head. Sweet and rich smell combination of chocolate, sweet roasted toffee and coffee hints. Taste was creamy rich, nicely balanced oatmeal taste, slightly more subtle than the Young's or Samuel Smith versions. Crisp bitter bite to the finish. Overall an very nice sweet oatmeal stout flavors. Full bodied, but not as ""chewy"" as the Young's version. This is still a very good version. I think I am really starting to enjoy Oatmeal Stouts, I'll go searching for more......."
"Notes: A very tasty Oatmeal Stout, low-key yet the flavours flow perfectly with the pleasing smoothness. Couple this brew with a fresh baked brownie or another chocolaty delight and you are all set."
