3.68,5.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 12/10/2014. Pours crystal clear very dark brown color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of milk chocolate, caramel, cocoa, toasted oats, light coffee, brown bread, herbal, floral, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted/bready malt and moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of milk chocolate, caramel, cocoa, toasted oats, light coffee, brown bread, herbal, floral, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Light herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, caramel, cocoa, toasted oats, light coffee, brown bread, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and complexity of dark/roasted/bready malt and moderate earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice oatmeal stout style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted/bready malt and moderate earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and easy to drink. Not as bold as some other oatmeal stouts; but still very well rounded and nicely enjoyable in flavors.","superspak","Dec 21, 2014"

The scent is has a nice espresso feel. The taste is a little watery coffee but it is decent. There is a nice sweet toffee after taste which makes one want to keep sipping away. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with smooth carbonation. Overall it's a smooth drinkable stout that is worth a taste.","WoodBrew","Apr 12, 2013"

This beer doesn't have the best drinkability, it went down smooth, but the flavors just couldn't hold my attention and the thin body was a turn off so one is more then enough for me. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma and appearance, they weren't great, but they weren't bad and either and compared to the other aspects of this beer those were the highlights. What I liked the least about this beer was how muted the roasted malt flavors were and how thin and watery the mouthfeel was, they were a pretty big disappointment. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's priced good, but the quality isn't up to my standards for the style and there's many more Oatmeal Stouts that I would much rather be drinking, I wouldn't recommend this beer to anyone, it's just not worth it. All in all I was let down with this beer, it just didn't deliver what a good Oatmeal Stout should and it left me wanting much more, better luck next time guys, this one turned out to be a miss.","StoutHunter","Nov 30, 2012"

Some fairly thick lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, oatmeal, and bitter coffee. Some surprisingly nice aromas with good strength.

The nose comprises roasted barley (as though 'twere fresh from a grain bag), light cocoa powder, and very light coffee. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a small bit of char in the background. Things still taste kinda husky grain-wise, rather than the roasted malted barley that would normally be found in these types o' brews. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish. Overall, a kinda weak stout, one that just doesn't do it for me.","TMoney2591","Dec 11, 2011"

This is a solid English-style Porter, too bad it bears no resemblance to any sort of Oatmeal Stout. Where's the creaminess? Another bag or two of roasted malts and a higher mash temp would go a long way. Not bad beer in the least, but it misses the style mark completely.

At first the taste is very bland however, as it hits the back of the tounge you notice some milk chocolate and a touch of bitterness with some bakers chocolate.

There's more coffee and a much darker chocolate present in the flavor than the nose suggests, and some light fruit also comes into play.

Sweet, dry finish.  I think this may be a decent beer to introduce people to the style as it's flavor profile and is not overly strong, but it still has all the characteristics, albeit subdued.","jreitman","May 13, 2002"
2.43,-30.4,3.5,3,2,2,2.5,""Sweet" stout is one thing but this brew never generated any flavor at any temperature, blandly sweet, less than average mouthfeel for the style...I was pretty bummed by Slow Elk...","ADR","Feb 22, 2002"
2.52,-27.8,3,1,3,3,3,"-Little aroma...watery..little head...more of a brown ale..easy drinking..some sweetness on aftertaste..below average to average stout..give this one to people who are afraid of big bad dark stouts...doesn't taste very dark or much like a stout.  To be fair, this one followed the Bell's Oatmeal Stout in my tasting and didn't come close to measuring up in character or taste..","ZAP","Dec 15, 2001"
