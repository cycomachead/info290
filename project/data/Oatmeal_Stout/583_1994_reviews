"This one has a future in my fridge."
"Tons of coffee flavor. Pretty smooth at first but after having one I don't want another right away."
""
"Brew pours close to a pitch black in color with a good 1-finger foamy beige head. Lots of lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of dark roasted malts with some fresh roasted and ground coffee beans. Very nice. The taste is pretty much the same with a nice flavor of coffee that is not strong or overpowering like some coffee stouts I have tried. Very smooth and goes down easy. No strong, no bitter and no harsh aftertaste at all. A great Coffee Stout! Medium-bodied with lower carbonation."

"Overall: 4.25 -  Overall this is a delightful little coffee stout. It lives up to the name. B"

"Black in color with a thick tan head (caffe crema?).  The smell is intensely espresso.  Coffee beans...highly roasted...some background roasted barley and malt, but the coffee is in front.  The taste is similar...coffee, with a stout bitterness and a lot of creamy mouthfeel.  This is an excellent brew."
""
"Poured into a snifter.  Color was dark brown but not quite opaque.  It rather resembled coffee.  Very light milk-colored head.  Strong smell of coffee.  Very strong taste of burnt coffee but lacked other, complimentary flavors.  Starts strong but finishes rather weak.  It could have used some chocolate. Very light carbonation.  Not a bad stout but cannot be compared to, say, Founders Breakfast Stout."

"O (3.5) - I bought this one on a lark, and probably won't again.  Maybe it's just me, but I thought the coffee taste was too over-the-top."
"Overall I really liked the balance and drinkability of this coffee stout. I’m generally pretty impressed with Schlafly’s. I wish this was a bit thicker and had a higher ABV; but I get what they were going for."
""
"Of you love coffee and stout you can't go wrong. Nice on a cold winters day!"
""
""
"Very drinkable - not heavy at all.  Just wish there was a brighter coffee flavor here."
""
""
"O:  A very nice surprise.  I went right out and bought a sixer.  At only $8, this is a steal.  Recommended for coffee beer fans."

"For coffee lovers only. Thought the moderate alcohol might make for a thin beer, but plenty of roasty, chocolatey coffee flavor with a creamy mouthfeel. Finishes with a bit of tang and bitterness. Good beer from a solid brewery!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Aroma is roasty malt, coffee grounds, a touch of chocolate, licorice, and rounded out by nutty malt sweetness. Flavor reveals strong coffee dominance throughout, accented by dark chocolate. There's a touch of an acrid character initially, which fades in the lightly bitter, roasty finish. Toasted nuts emerge in the aftertaste. Coffee isn't my favorite, but this is a well constructed beer."

"O: Too much of a good thing? This is like coffee with some stout thrown in. I am not a coffee drinker - but I like the smell of it. This would be a great breakfast stout. It is not one that I could drink more than one at a sitting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall- a fine local coffee stout that is balanced quite well. No offensive flavours. Works for me."

"Overall - A good beer, not as much coffee and I was expecting, tastes just like a regular stout. Good nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with thin tan head. Nose is straight coffee. Deep roasted coffee ground with undertow of chocolate and roast. Taste is much a like a chilled black coffee. Nice robust coffee notes along with notes of oats, charred grain, and cocoa. Mouthfeel is on the thinner side with mild carbonation. Overall, very nice coffee character in this beer."
""
""
""
"brown in a pint class, lots of tan head. aroma of fresh coffee beans. flavor is okay, lots of coffee there, more bitterness though. a little bit roasty, some candy-like or syrupy sweetness on the back end. overall good but not my favorite coffee stout"
"O: a delicious coffee stout. Everything is in great balance and exactly what a coffee stout should be"
""
"Overall: This is a great black coffee stout. I get sweetened iced black coffee during the Summer so this is right up my alley. Recommended if you like those flavors."
""
""
"Really liked this stout from Schlafly. Had this poured out of the bottle into a stout glass. Awesome coffee aroma and flavor. Burnt and robust. Nice dark brown color with a tape fluffy head. Great balance, try it with dessert or a smoky pork. Smooth down the gullet. So good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I think I covered it in ""taste"" but I had this on tap a week ago and craved it all week. I manged to find the last 6-pack in one of my local spots and while the bottle isn't quite the experience the tap was, I would still recommend this beer to all lovers of stouts and coffee."
"O- A well done coffee stout considering all of them that have been done."
""
""
"O - If you like oat stouts, this is a good one, just a nice hint of coffee."
"Bottle: Poured a deep black color stout with a large light brown foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of dry coffee notes with light roasted malt. Taste is dominated by dry bitter coffee notes with and almost spicy finish. Light bitter black chocolate notes are also noticeable. Body is a bit light for style with good carbonation. Too bitter for my taste with coffee notes veering into stringency territory."
""
"The mouthfeel is too light for me. I feel it should be creamier. The carbonation bites the middle of the tongue. Finishes with a little residue on the tongue."

"At the alcohol was light here, as there was hardly any booze to be detected as I did ""shots"" of this coffee, er...beer. While I like something that pushes the edge a bit, something was missing here. Maybe it was the oats, some more powder to the chocolate, or some more bubbles to give this some life. Espresso tends to be watery, flat, and bitter and that's what this was too. If that's your thing, drink away! It will save you a trip to the place with the long lines, green aprons, and hum of the coffee machines."
""
""
""
""
"O-One of the few times Schlafly has disappointed me. I was expecting better on this one."
""
""
"O- Not bad. Not great either. One for die-hard coffee lovers to seek out, but if not, I would probably leave on the shelf."
""
""

"The beer pour a light brownish and creamy head that dissipates quickly but still leaves some film on the beer. The beer is a dark brown color that almost appears like a dark black that resembles coffee. As expected, the beer is opaque. The beer has a very strong coffee smell and dominates the other smells. However, the other smells such as the hint of oatmeal and roasted malts compliment the beer instead of detracting from it. The taste does not quite live up to the expectation of the smell but still works well. Coffee is the dominant flavor and slight complemented by the oatmeal and roasted malts. The beer feels surprisingly light for a heavy bodied beer with biting carbonation. The beer itself feels smooth as it goes down. Overall, a pretty decent coffee stout and worth getting again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall I liked this beer and enjoyed the complexities of the roasted coffee and bitter flavors; I love coffee so I’m always slightly biased on my enjoyment and rating of this type of beer, so I would recommend this brew since the coffee flavors were very tasty to me."
""
""
"This is a touch unorthodox, with the earthy pepper flavor, chocolate and coffee but it is quite good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A quality beer that is not particularly complex.  Could use a few more flavors.  I'd especially like to see a bit more chocolate."
""
""
""
""

"Finding this, well, not exactly mediocre, but uninspiring. Has a funny sweetness that reminds me a lot of beers like Southern Tier Mokah and Creme Brulee. Also has some distinct milk stout characteristics, which I wasn't expecting."

"Overall, a pretty nice beer. But this is a bit of a one trick pony, lots of coffee flavors that are nice, but it needs some more stout flavors to balance this out. Still enjoyable though."

"Coffee Stout is a classic combination of a traditional stout and premium French roast coffee from St. Louis roaster, Kaldi’s Coffee. Roasted barley and coffee dominate the aroma, with the sweetness from the stout balancing the acidity of the coffee. We use a unique cold toddy extraction process to brew a less acidic coffee for the beer."

"YUMMY; GRAB A BOTTLE!"
""

""

"O: A really good coffee stout but I kept the Overall score in check because it is pretty one-dimensional -- but it is a really enjoyable dimension they bring in this brew."
"Overall- Decent stout with an average coffee flavor. I would drink it again but there are some better coffee stouts out there."
""
""
""
"Overall if you want some coffee with a tad bit of alcohol, go for this. It was very drinkable but forgetable as a beer because of the coffee-esque thin mouthfeel and one dimentional flavor profile. I've had worse coffee beers for sure but definitely better ones as well."
""
"The beer's appearance is an oily black, with a bubbly, soda-like head. The aroma contains hints of  dark-roasted coffee beans, grains, and a touch of something sweet.  My nose also detected a small presence of oxidation. The flavor has a nice bitter coffee flavor, and as advertised, the 'cold toddy extraction process' does indeed produce a less acidic flavor. It's rather light, no doubt benefiting from the breadiness of the Oatmeal as well. The overall mouthfeel however might be a little too light and carbonated, a bit of a let down compared to the expected velvety softness that one might get with other Oatmeal Stouts, such as New Holland's ""The Poet."" This might not be the best coffee stout ever made, but the uniqueness of the coffee blending and it's resulting flavor are enough to give it merit."

"O: let's just say that this beer made me change my mind about schlafly & as a result, i have become a fan of a couple of their beers. this isn't a complex stout, by any means, but that is part of the charm. it's simple, yet very well done. this stout is one of my everyday staples."
""
"Overall: simple but very good. Not too bitter but yet tons of coffee flavor. Must pair this one with the chocolate cake at the brewpub."
"O: I like this more than their Oatmeal Stout, from which this is derived from. Great seasonal, and tastes amazing on cask. Prost!"
""
""
""
""

"This one pours a medium bodied dark cola brown in color with a one finger off white head. The nose features authentic coffee (sans creamer, just black), almost espresso, mild coffee bitterness, light baking chocolate, and a subtle malty sweetness. The flavors are well rounded and approachable. There is a good amount of coffee with moderate bitterness, baking chocolate, smooth dark malts, obviously some roast, and a light chocolate/oatmeal malty sweetness. It has nice flavor. It drinks on the lighter side of medium in body and leaves behind a nice amount of coffee in the aftertaste. This is a pretty solid beer. The level of coffee is impressive considering this beer is an oatmeal stout registering in at just 5.7%."

"O-Very good stout. Very drinkable with just the right amount of coffee flavor. And for a $8/6 pack you cant go wrong. Solid beer for sure, especially if you are on a budget."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, received in a Beer of the Month 6 pack from Vintage Cellar in Blacksburg, Virginia, into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice pitch black color with a small brownish head that dissipates quickly, but leaves some lacing. Smells of darkly roasted coffee, nothing else. Tastes of coffee and a little bit of malt, but definate dark coffee taste dominates, like there is still coffee beans in it (not actually, but that taste). Beer goes down real smooth for this light/medium bodied beer and is carbonated perfectly. Overall, a very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very pleasant stout. If you like coffee, this is a good one for you as the coffee is prominent without being harsh or bitter."
"Pours black with a small head. Aroma is light, mostly coffee. Tastes like a pretty good stout with a single shot of espresso. The coffee here is not as up front as I expected. I like my coffee stouts strong. It is, however, very smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. The coffee doesn't come through until the middle and the drink finishes out with a slight hop bitterness to it. Overall definitely a good beer, but I'll take one with stronger coffee if I can find it."
""
""
"Overall Impression- After each drink, I thought to myself, is this on-cask? Very creamy and easy going down! Of course it was still full bodied but very nice with coffee character but anyone can enjoy! I'm looking to enjoy my bottle of this within the week as well and compare."

"o - Overall a very nice coffee stout. One of those stouts that smells and tastes like coffee grounds, it's very strong. Would have it again."
"Balanced! This beer's pretty good."
"O- Drinkable, damn drinkable, but not crazy about it. Subtle flavors, almost playing it too safe. Wish the stout body and flavors came in full force and coffee had a big fresh presence. Would drink again, but wouldn't spend much."
""
""
" Perfect: they went exactly where they were headed. They designed a recipe and hit the target. Excellent."
""
""
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. I have to say I'm pretty impressed with this, especially for the price. This is definitely a beer for coffee-lovers so if you can't stand it, then buyer beware. For me, though, this is an example of the style done right, but I'd like to have gotten a bit more of the underlying oatmeal stout."
"(12 oz. into imperial pint) Pours a rich black color with very little head and moderate lacing on the glass. The aroma out of the glass is immediately of the coffee roast, and chocolate malts. It actually smells just like a good cup of espresso. The flavor is exactly the same, with a slight hint of the roast with an overwhelming flavor of espresso. The finish is very smooth and refreshing. Let this one warm up a bit to fully appreciate the complexity and subtlety of all the flavors."
""
""
""
""
"O - I thought this was a solid brew overall with a pretty tasty flavor profile. There's a good amount of coffee flavor without being too unbalanced. This wasn't quite as smooth as some other oatmeal stouts, but the lighter feel of this beer, coupled with the lighter ABV, makes it session worthy. I wouldn't mind trying this beer again, especially when I'm in the mood for a lighter bodied stout."
"Pours a deep brown nearing black. Big mocha-colored head with nice lacing as it goes down. Good retention as well. Thin collar afterward. The nose carries a really nice bit of coffee with some mild cream. Slight roast as well. Flavor has a good coffee and roast combination with a slight creaminess behind it. Medium body with good carbonation. Slightly chewy. Quite good."
"Pours a dark brown with a slight tan head that fades quickly. Nice coffee smell, slight sweet malt. Coffee taste though out that fades slightly. Nice balance and carbonation as with any good oatmeal stout. Just a great coffee stout that is not to filling or overpowering. Certainly could drink many. Wish this was available in this area."
""
""
""
"Would drink again."
"M - Thin to medium body with a little too much carbonation. Relatively clean, dry finish."
"O: A solid coffee stout. A poor mouthfeel holds this one back from being something more."
""
"O: Overall, not bad. Looks nice, and smells and tastes like coffee. The mouthfeel is nothing special considering that this is supposed to be an oatmeal stout. Good nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall the drink feels bigger than the low abv hints at. This however, tastes better than it smells, but it's just another solid beer from this brewery."
""
""
"Overally - not too bad, but I've had much better crafted and flavored coffee/oatmeal stouts."
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: The beer is medium bodied, very smooth and creamy. Overall, I was impressed with this coffee stout. Nice flavors in this."
""
"An awesome coffee stout, with none of the off-putting green pepper flavors that I often find in beers actually brewed with coffee. Enjoying it right now with waffles and it's kicking a lot of ass."
""
""
"O: This was good, but beer like Founders Breakfast Stout and Wake N' Wake beats this with one taste bud tied behind its back."
"I had my second glass with a Snickers and it was AWESOME!"
"Nice, basic stout."
""
""
""
"Overall, I enjoy the abundant coffeeness of this beer. It's a great dessert beer, and it's watery feel makes it go down almost too fast. But if you love coffee then you'll want to try this beer for sure."
"Overall I have to say that I am really enjoying this beer a lot this year. I had it last year and don't remember liking it as much as I do now. Seems richer with more coffee and definitely a stronger all around flavor profile than I remember. This will become a yearly wintertime staple for me I'm sure from now on since coffee stouts are pretty much my favorite kind of beer, it is easy to find in Nashville, easy to drink, tastes great, and is reasonably priced. Another solid product from Schlafly!"
""
"Not a terrible beer but completely forgettable, and not enjoyable enough for me to finish. Nothing I'd ever revisit again unless it's on draft. I do enjoy Coffee Stouts when they're done correctly, and sadly for Schlafly this was not."
""
""
"Overall: I find the thin mouthfeel forgivable as I really like the flavor profile; one of my favorites in the coffee beer style"
""
""
"O: Good coffee beer. Excellent nose and coffee flavor. Very drinkable."
""
"O: Really enjoyed this this offering from Schlafly. Not overpowering just a nice touch of character. Definitely worth a try."
""
"pours black as night and smells just like a cupa joe, rich white head. has a wonderful coffee taste blended with their oatmeal stout and all of its goodness. locally roasted beans gives this a distinct flavor apart from other coffee stouts. not at all acidic as some can be, smooth mouthfeel, good coffee buzz. perfect for a rainy morning with a hangover."
"O - Other than the watery mouthfeel, this was a very nice coffee stout...the flavors weren't overpowering and they weren't non-existent...I will pick up more of this when I can"
"Drinkability: I am impressed. This is truly a coffee stout in the sense it smells like coffee and tastes like stout."
"Overall- This is a very enjoyable coffee stout that needs a little more of the sweet creamer quality in the taste. Otherwise, the nose and mouth feel are great!"
""
"Beer is medium in body and quite bitter, strong from the back moving forward. Interesting beer overall too. Sweetness minimal. A nice little stout for sure."
""
"I guess you could say this might be typical for a stout, but it really made the beer seem flat and dead. There are to many other great stouts on the market for me to rank this any higher."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not terrible, but not looking forward to the rest of the 6-pack."
"Overall: This is one of my go-to beers at Schlafly and its a personal favorite of mine. It could be a true masterpiece if it had a real American Stout backbone to it. Nevertheless, one of the best of its sub-style."
"Pours a brownish body w/ quick dying, large-sized head on top of a beer w/ an aroma of coffee, roasted, burnt chocolaty malts as well as dry bready/oakiness. This is a great example of a stout pulling off a tricky balancing act as at first I found this beer real smooth, almost creamy, w/ sweetness emanating from chococlate, caramel and possible touches of vanilla, toffee and oats. Then an afterfinish w/ a burst of tasty, roasted coffee malt that gives it a strong, dry, hearty finish. Overall, an easy to drink and low-priced stout that is a great beer."
"Could bee sessionable for acidic almost acrid coffee & beer lovers."
"A great offering by the guys at Schlafly. Complex and great looking...well worth the tiny price tag."
"Great balance between bitter and sweet. A very nice oatmeal stout."
"The mouthfeel is a bit thin on this one, being almost more brown ale-esque than stout, but I think it works fine with the coffee flavors. The drinkability is very good, as a coffee lover this one goes down very easily. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. It's not exceptional, but a solid, sessionable coffee beer that'd be a staple if locally available."
"O: Very nice. 4.5"
"D - After a promising start in terms of appearance and smell, this one sort of falls of a cliff... The palette is muddled and a bit on the timid side and the mouthfeel is slightly off putting... Not recommended as I can think of several coffee infused brews that I would put first..."
"Sidenote: I tried this same beer in the tap-room at the brewery, and it was if I remember correctly, loads better. Maybe this particular beer just suffered in the bottle."
"Notes: I do like Schlafly, and some of their offerings are amongst my favorites but here... This is by far the worst I´ve had from them. Maybe it is a matter of taste but while not despicable this is in the bottom bracket of coffee-oatmeal stouts I´ve tried."
"Not sure how the Cards/Pads game turned out, but it was shaping up to be entertaining. Now to this brew here. It pours a murky dark burnt sienna topped by a finger of lightly dusty dirty white foam. The nose is dominated by a rich coffee aroma, with some mild molasses, dusty dark chocolate, and lightly chlorinated wheat rollicking behind. The taste embitters the coffee, while simultaneously complimenting it with some rye notes. The chocolate also gets some bitterness (we're nearing cookin' choc here), and the roasted malts seem rather burnt. A hint of light leather hides in the back. The body is a lightly hefty medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a pretty smooth feel. Overall, a nice coffee stout, though the bitterness borders on harshness. I could see drinking more of them, though."
"Feels a bit thin for an oatmeal stout but you can smell and taste the coffee upfront. The coffee lingers for a pleasant aftertaste provided you are a coffee drinker. Moderate carbonation goes over well."
"Overall -- It's an okay coffee stout. What is a kind way to say 'middle of the pack?' Truthfully, there's a lot to like here. The coffee is pleasant, not stale or burnt, and the body makes this beer especially drinkable - dare I say sessionable? My big nitpicks with this beer are that it's unpleasantly carbonated, thin, and overly sweet. If this were available to me I probably wouldn't reach for it on a shelf, but I wouldn't turn one down."
"D - If you like coffee stouts this one is very drinkable. Would love to try this one again out of the tap."
"drinkable - yep."
"Drinkability: On a positive note, this beer is highly sessionable. Unfortunately, I was looking for something with more substance. I could enjoy quite a few of these, but I'd rather have one glass of a more complex, fuller-bodied stout."
"D: Pretty excellent as far as coffee stouts are concerned. The mouthfeel never becomes syrupy and there's nice balance here for the coffee. Plus, we're only at 5.7%...sessionable in my book!"
"Very dark brown to black in color, and opaque; it looks like coffee in the glass. There are powerful fresh ground espresso bean aromas framed by faint, bittersweet dark chocolate. Flavors are predominantly dark-roasted espresso, with some dark chocolate and cola profiles. Medium carbonation for a pleasing mouth feel, with a very long finish of roasted coffee bean and bitter malt. This is very drinkable because it is not overly sweet, syrupy or alcoholic for its style."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, not a horrible beer, but there are far, far better coffee stouts out there."
"This is a very nice oatmeal/coffee stout. Good drinkability and nice overall characters."
"Probably a good session brew. The rather light mouthfeel, while perhaps atypical for the style, actually adds to the drinkability. An easy drinking beer."
"draft at Lyon Hall, Arlington"
"Drinkability: pretty decent, one for the coffee lovers."
"D'ability - aside from the carbonation, a very gentle and drinkable coffee stout."
"The mix of coffee and a stout is perfect. Other than the fact it was a wee bit thin on the taste the flavor profile was out of this world. Coffee, chocolate, and a bit of bitter hop bite. It's like chewing on a coffee bean and for some this can be a wonderful experience. Great Beer St. Louis Brewery!!!"
"The strong black coffee taste was just too much to drink more than one at a time."
"Dark brown, almost black with a sizable white head. Looks like coffee with a head. The smell is somewhat lacking for a coffee beer. I expected some more coffee aromas since that's one of the most distinctive parts about coffee. It's there, but you have to smell hard for it. The taste has a coffee taste and bitterness at first, but it dissapates rather quickly. Actually the first sip is very impressive, but as I kept drinking, I lost what that first sip yielded. I've had better coffee stouts but this is not bad. Maybe this is becasue I like my coffee strong. It finishes well, leaving a coffee-like bitterness behind. It's very smooth and enjoyable in the aspect of mouthfeel. Definitely balanced well and is not too acidic. Goes down easily, but if I wanted a go to stout, I'd go with something else usually."
"D - Good to drink. I like that there is no doubt that it is a coffee stout. Great looking and aroma. The taste and mouthfeel were fine but not standout."
"D-Very sessionable beer for coffee lovers."
"Drinkability: An easy drinking, straightforward coffee stout. Decent, but minimal complexity and too light colored and light bodied."
"If you go into drinking this as it should be a damn fine nightcap, think again. If you'd like a light coffee stout to start your day or to end your work day with a cup of a Joe meets beer, here you go. Very drinkable and satisfying."
"Drinkability: I was very impressed with this beer and definitely would drink again. A very good use of coffee in the beer."
"Drinkability: This one isn't bad, but there are plenty of other coffee beers that I would choose before going back."
"Very dark brown color with one finger of head that quickly settled to a thin cap. Just a light spattering of spotty lacing. There is coffee in the aroma but it is balanced with some nice dark malt. A solid oatmeal stout lies under the coffee. The coffee is more dominat in the flavor. The coffee tastes fresh and of high quality. A little roasted bitterness in the finish. If the stout characteristics came through more, this would be a really good beer. It just cannot hold up to the coffee. The body is not as ""chewy"" as I would like it. This stout is nicely carbonated. A lower ABV stout that gives a good coffee fix."
"Flavor is, of course, heavy on the coffee side, with a slight chocolate hint. Smooth, muted bite at the finish. Tasty and easy to drink."
"D: An easy drinking beer but just not what I expect in a stout"
"pours a deep deep brown with a creamy tan head. smells like a good coffee with a hit of malt. the taste is really good its exactly what i would want my perfect cup of coffee to taste like if i poured in a good stout. really like the mouth feel and its amazingly drinkable i could drink this instead of my few cups of joe in the am but i dont think work would like that too much... i recomend this to everyone....very good job schlafly"
"is this really a coffee stout or just a coffee brown ale?"
"D- This is probably my favorite beer of Schlafly's. Very strong on the coffee, but more or less well executed."
"A little thin on the mouthfeel based on the oatmeal stout base. But, it does not detract from the overall presentation. A reasonable abv makes this highly drinkable. Way to go, Schlafly."
"I poured this Schlafly's Coffee Stout from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The first thing you notice is great carbonation that explodes into a creamy white head. Decent head retention. The color of the Stout is a shade less then pitch black. This Coffee Stout has an Oatmeal Stout as a base and it is brewed with locally roasted Kaldi's Coffee. The aroma is wonderful. If you are a coffee lover, this is the perfect fusion of beer and coffee. As you drink the foam clings to the glass. This beer tastes like it smells, balanced, with the taste of coffee and slight hints of chocolate. Best Coffee based beer I have had- I think this is The Saint Louis Brewery's greatest victory. The only problem is that this is a seasonal beer. I could drink this year around. Now if I can only get my employer to put this on tap next to the coffee pot! Prost!"
"The near overpowering coffee grind notes can be a little alarming at first, but this is a coffee stout, and in the end everything evens out in the end to create a well-rounded and well-crafted brew that should easily give any coffee and or beer lover their fix."
"This stuff is pretty good. Very tasty and satisfying on a winter night."
"Drinkability - I rather like this beer. Some may be turned off by the abundance of coffee flavors and aromas, but I found it most enjoyable. This would be a wonderful after dinner beer, maybe even enjoy this with a touch of vanilla ice cream on a cold, cold, night. Probably wouldn't want to tackle this on a Summers day however. It's worth a try and I'll pick it up again sometime soon for sure."
"Overall a very nice stout that would pair well with a chocolate desert or as a main course beer, although it would have to be with something rich enough to handle the coffee flavor, possibly venison chili, or beef pot pie."
"The alcohol is slightly noticeable in this brew. It is medium bodied with a modest level of carbonation. Not a bad offering at all."
"D-Stout lovers beware!This beer should be listed as a coffee ale but it is still quite drinkable."
"Overall, an OK coffee stout. There's decent coffee presence but the flavor is a bit off for me."
"Overall this is an awesome brew. Brewed with beans from a local roaster, I believe. Was a little cold when it was brought out, but that happens. Definitely worth sampling; if I lived in St. Louis area, would be picking this up as a good lunch/afternoon brew."
"drinkability is great - if you love coffee beers this beer is a must - the low abv and lighter body makes me wish i bought a whole sixer instead of a single"
"Also, seriously: coffee fans will like this. They really put the effort into getting the flavor in the beer."
"Hi Angel!"
"The taste is sweet and smoky upfront, qualities such as semisweet chocolate and coffee. Feel wise it's a bit oily slick, and pretty much full in body though a mildly placed ABV setting."
"Lighter bodied as everything else has led to believe. Mouthfeel and higher mid level of carb are more similar to a brown ale again. Drinkability is good with this, I just would reach for something else. On it's own this is fine, just wouldn't really consider this a stout."
"Would get this again."
"D - this is a fantastic coffee stout. This is one of the better Schlafly offerings out there, I would definitely recommend it."
"Drinks nicely, mildly filling, but not heavy. I wouldn't give up my coffee or favorite stouts for it though, and in the realm of coffee stouts, it's tasty, but not quite outstanding. A highlight, though, is that it isn't over done, too strong, or too heavy."
"Overall this is a pretty good coffee stout. It has a very nice flavor, rich in body, and some flavors linger in the end."
"D: Nice to sip before a BBQ dinner at Smokey Bones resturant. Not sure I want to session this."
"Overall, a very coffee oriented beer. I really enjoy drinking this one, as I do drink dark roast coffee on a daily basis. If you are a coffee drinker and also enjoy stouts (i don't see how the two wouldn't go hand-in-hand) you will most likely appreciate this beer."
"Overall, an unoffensive, mild beer. I am partial to coffee stouts and found this one just a little lacking in the flavor and body department to make it a home run for me."
"Thin, over-carbonated, and not what a stout should be. Schlafly impressed me during my first experience with their Dry-hopped APA. It has since gone downhill."
"D - Easy to drink. Having one of these by a fire tonight and it is going down very easy."
"D: Drinkability is decent, it would be much better if it were a bit creamier without so much harsh carbonation."
"Not much of an Oatmeal Stout as far as I am concerned. The coffee really takes over everything. Along with the chalky, dry, and acidic feel this is a sub standard coffee stout as well. Not bad, just nothing I will visit again soon."
"Not the most complex coffee stout, and far from the most flavorful, but a nice drinkable, sessionable entry."
"It has a dark black body with a n average amount of dark tan head. It has a strong coffee aroma and burnt sugar smell. It tastes of caramel and coffee with some roasted malt. The coffee taste is very strong. If you like beer and you like coffee this is the beer for you. It has a thick body with average carbonation."
"D - if you like lattes, then you will like this."
"It has a nice quaffable quality, i've been known to drink around six of these at a time. More of the session coffee stout, if you will. I have drank my fair share of this beer and will continue as it's on tap at my weekend pub."
"a very nice coffee stout with huge flavors, lower ABV, and balance. good stuff."
"Drinkability? The abv is reasonable and the taste is very pleasing so I think this is a very easy brew to drink. A nice job by Schlafly."
"The mouthfeel is smooth with a moderate carbonation and a medium body, maybe a little light for a stout. There's a richness to it and the feel stops just short of thickness."
"d-easy enough to drink and overall still a good beer but this one is far better out of a bottle than on tap"
"Drinks pretty easy, although the taste is something overpowering."
"D - A lighter stout but still tasty."
"Taste is very mild with a dry lingering finish. The sweetness doesn't come through in the taste. It's a bit thin and watery as well. Not much like an oatmeal stout, which I expect to be much creamier than this. Very fizzy carbonation hurts the drinkability."
"Unfortunately, the taste does not live up to the aroma for me. It still has plenty of coffee flavor, but seems thin, watery and lifeless. A little bit of roastiness, but no flavor contributions from the hops or yeast and the malts could use some more dextrinous body and sweetness. I am a little disappointed with this beer, but coffee beer lovers should give it a go."
"I should note that the espresso used in this beer is from Clayton/St. Louis-based roaster Kaldi's. Its all free-trade, too (as problematic as that term is, its still nice to see on a beer). Overall, I found this to be more of a porter than a stout. Either way its a tasty beer with a good sense of balance to it."
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 11/18/2008. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. The aroma is pretty straight forward, it smells like coffee and roasted malt. Taste is for the most part just like the aroma, it's mostly coffee and roasted malt, but has a little bit of a charred/burnt malt and smoky taste too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, and it's a bit creamy and slick. However, it does seem to be a bit thin for a stout. Drinkability is good, it is smooth and goes down easy. I think this is a good, sessionable coffee stout. Not bad at all!"
"This is interesting: the roast flavors in the coffee & the bitterness of the hop combine in a sharp way that almost snaps on the tongue. Maybe it's the big bubbles, too, but this has a way of finishing that somehow just ""pops," like Pop Rocks, in a way that's almost abrasive. The mouthfeel is rather thin, otherwise, but leaving a remnant of fresh coffee bean taste. I get thrown by stouts that aren't thick and/or creamy, & this is rather thin & soda-esque, which makes for some cognitive dissonance. Dunno, maybe that's just my hang-up."
"Overall: The mouth feel is kinda creamy and carbonated. The mouth feel is medium full and the finish lingers on the palate for a few moments. This is a pretty good coffee stout. It has a very nice flavor, rich in body, and some flavors linger in the end. You can't get anything beer would be good in the morning. You get your beer and your coffee in on swoop."
"Overall, a good coffee stout, but I've got no reason to switch from Alesmith's Speedway."
"Pours dark brown to black...looks like coffee with small amount of tan head. Smell is of iced coffee, maybe mocha, something I really enjoy! Taste is good, iced coffee, chocolate, and a small amount of hops. Mouthfeel is good although I prefer a little thicker for this type of brew. Really only a one timer per night kinda beer but I do like this for a change of pace."
"Too much coffee for me, but if you like dark coffee and stouts, you will probably enjoy this. The tour guide said that drinking a pint of this has about 1 cup worth of coffee in it and i believe it."
"D - Will I really enjoy this beer, I cannot have more than two at a time. The sweetness tends to linger on my palate and after two of these becomes overpowering."
"This is my go-to beer when I don't want to think about what to drink. I am not a coffee drinker but I love this beer. It looks, smells, and tastes just like coffee. I have had it on tap and in a bottle and it is consistently good. The aroma is deep and and rich. This beer is not bitter, but has a chocolaty sweetness that compliments the coffee flavor quite well."
"One of the creamiest brews I've had on tap.. Its super smooth and creamy and dark and semi-delicious...I've had better coffee stout but this is a good rep of the style...its loaded with dark coffee flavors and aroma... So much so that I'm not sure I would care anything about sessioning this but it was a nice nightcap..."
"Overall: My assumption is I received a mishandled or bad bottle, but that is not a reflection on the brewery as I very much enjoyed the Schlafly Winter ESB. Will retry when I can get my hands on another bottle."
"Good stuff. Tastes of medium roast coffee with faint roast malt in back. Watery sweetness similiar to English brown ales. A tad heavy on the carbonation which comes through in the mouth and swallow."
"D: A sessionable coffee stout. To be honest I would like a touch more coffee though."
"D - I could session this one, easy yet interesting enough to hang on."
"Schlafly is becoming my favorite brewer. This is my 5th or 6th variety, and I'm still haven't had one that wasn't exceptional."
"Thanks to brewczar for the opportunity to try this one. Bottled on 12/5/2008 and served in a nonic. Poured three shades shy of black with deep maroon highlights around the base of the glass. Two inch, tight tan-colored head with excellent retention that left behinds thick bands of lacing as it receded. Roasted coffee dominates the nose with a slightly vegetal quality detected towards the back. Taste follows nose, but a little on the bland side and some residual espresso roast lightly lingers at the finish. Mouthfeel was somewhat light for the style without much of the chewiness I've come to associate with an oatmeal stout. Exceptional appearance and bold nose gives way to a somewhat muted representation of the style; easy drinking brew nonetheless."
"D- I was rather dreading this beer as I was never a big coffee fan, however this stout was amazing. There is a load of coffee flavor, however it really pairs well and tastes amazing."
"A solid offering - and if I were in the mood for a coffee stout, it would be on my list. At the end of the day, I would guess that this particular beer is just missing the body I would desire in a nice warming coffee stout."
"Pours a dark brown, with a thick, creamy, tan colored head that has good retention and leaves some sticky lace on the glass. Strong aroma of coffee as one would expect and a touch of chocolate malt. The coffee flavors are very nice here, not too overpowering, good level of roasted bitterness. Pretty smooth mouthfeel with a good level of carbonation. This is a very good coffee stout."
"Pours a cloudy, dark brown. 5/4 inch head with good retention and good lacing. Smells strongly of coffee (roasted malts). Fits the style. Smooth, bitter from the roasted malts, and average carbonation levels. Tastes of roasted malts (coffee) up front. Aftertaste is less bitter and more sweet (chocolate). Overall, this is a really nice example of a coffee stout."
"M/D - Very creamy and smooth. Easy drinking but the flavors just arent great."
"mouth is slightly grainy and very thick. Medium carbonation, maybe too much carbonation. drinks easy but there's no way I could have more than a few on any given day."
"drinkability: last winter this was my go-to stout, and i would drink a sixer at a time. still like it a lot, but don't think i could handle more than just a few at a time. for someone that likes coffee-dominant stouts this is a must try."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a label describing this as an oatmeal stout flavored with Kaldi's coffee. The beer is dark brown, a little transclucent at the edges. Coffee is the dominant smell, some malt too. The taste is nice, the coffee doesn't seem overbearing or anything, but I'd prefer more a thicker body and maybe more sweetness. Very tasty but more body would be nice for a fit with the flavor."
"D - This is the epitome of drinkable. Light and refreshing with excellent coffee flavor. This one of my favorite session beers. At @ $7.50 six pack it's very affordable."
"Drinkability is high. This beer tastes great, goes down smooth, and could be fairly sessionable. I suppose some might not want to drink several coffee beers in a row, but I certainly could with this beer. Schlafly's coffee is one of my favorite seasonal six packs, and I enjoy it year after year. It's not the best coffee stout I've ever had, but it's tasty and it's local. I look forward to enjoying this beer for years to come. I only wish it were available year round."
"Overall I was floored by how good this one was. One of the best coffee beers i have had and really just a shining moment of the night for me. This was damn good."
"D_The first few sips really let you know there are two competing drugs here, a depressant as well as the introduced stimulant - the caffeine (or if I'm making an ass out of myself and there is no caffeine in here, then just the suggestion of caffeine) was enough to cause some unique feelings in my head. This beer is flavorful without being oppressive and I would have two if only I hadn't bought one bottle as part of a mix-your-own-six."
"Conclusion: If you like coffee (and I mean really like coffee) and you like stout, this is for you. It's the freshest, most ""coffee-oriented"" coffee beer I've yet to try...simple, ballsy, and delicious!"
"The beer is a coffee colored brew with a decent tan head that fades pretty quickly. The nose is over overwhelming coffee/espresso slight malty background to it. Great taste, slight bitter aftertaste. For a stout this is an extremely light body - normally, I would say this detracts from the beer, however the lighter body makes this beer great for a session. I will definitely need to have some of this shipped to me!"
"On draught at the brewpub (as ""Kaldi's""). This beer is a nearly opaque dark brown color with ruby on the fringes. Thin and creamy off-white head that dissipates quickly, and spotty lacing. Aroma of coffee, oatmeal and roasted malt. Medium, smooth body with coffee, roasted barley and malt flavors. The finish is nutty with a lingering coffee aftertaste. Pretty good all around."
"D - The coffee is too bitter for me to consider this very drinkable. One is okay. Two is too much."
"This one poured a very dark brown with a fluffy off white head that quickly dissipated. The smell was amazing. I love Starbucks and coffee altogether so this one is great. There is also some sweet caramel malts and milk chocolate in there as well. The taste is slightly sweet chocolate and a robust espresso. The coffee is not dominate which is good for this. There is an amazing balance between all the flavors which make it a great brew. If the coffee was overpowering it would just be coffee and not beer. The mouthfeel was a little thin. I would have liked this to have a little bit more of a creamy texture. Maybe I should put some half and half in it. Overall I am impressed and would like to have another."
"You hear about a lot of dark beers, particularly stouts, having tastes reminiscent of coffee, typically due to the type of grain used and the way that it is roasted/treated. This, on the other hand, tastes like Mr. Schlafly dumped several buckets of some crazy French roast into the damn fermenter. Whatever. It's interesting, and I dig it. Give it a try."
"The coffee nose is pretty excellent. Fresh, clean, cold-brewed coffee with minimal astringency, plenty of smooth coffee aromatics. The coffee character is just exceptional here. The palate opens with plenty of coffee, smooth, with low bitterness and acidity and mild roast. I wish they'd brew a more aggressive base beer for this, as after the wonder that the nose is, the palate doesn't quite live up to it. Thin, a little over carbonated, the mid-palate is rather weak with a mild grainy bitterness, coffee and a little cocoa. No fucking figs here. Drying on the finish, the carbonation takes away from the oatmeal here. Solid stuff."
"More props to Tilley4... Jason is a great trader, and we need to do it again soon."
"Final Note: if Starbucks made a beer, I think it might taste like this one. Recommended."
"Overall, this wasn't a terrible Coffee Stout but it just didn't do enough in certain areas to make it overly memorable either. Still, the flavor isn't too bad and the drinkibility is still fairly good."
"I really look forward to this beer every winter, its one of Schlaflys best products, IMHO."
"might be me but this one sort of left me wishing for something more by the end of the glass."
"It is difficult for me to say if this beer would be any better had it been continuously refrigerated as recommended by the brewer. I thought the appearance and aroma slightly better but with taste and feel well integrated for a nicely brewed beer."
"Pours black, just a hair shy of opaque. Tan head. Smell is strong coffee all around. Hint of metal peeking through the wet bitter coffee grind smell. Taste is largely the same. Gritty wet strong coffee grind flavor with a hint of sweetness, and ending bitterness. Good strong coffee flavored beer with a nice mildly thick body and appropriate carbonation. Just a touch simple and one-note, but I still liked it a lot. Definitely worth a try if you like coffee beers."
"D: This beer confuses me, I mean it is very complex, and smells fresh and tastes clean but the coffee taste that is there is not as clean and clear as I would have hoped for, complex to be sure but not the coffee taste I was expecting. Still good though."
"Stout pours jet black with an ample 1"" head with plenty of lacing. Aroma of fresh coffee. Crisp chocolate roasted malt with a jolt of hops in the middle. Coffee bitterish aftertaste. Smooth and satisfying. This is the first coffee stout available in Nashville so I don't have much to compare it to but this seems pretty good."
"This one went down so easily. Nice job on the coffee stout, Schlafly."
"thanks again brad."
"This beer poured black with very little head. The aroma is strictly coffee. The taste follows with strong coffee flavors, but some sweet malt is also noticeable. The mouthfeel is somewhat thin. Overall, I'd say this is a good brew that would be great for a session."
"A brownish black body settles into the glass showing hints of light only when held to the bulb. Head is two fingers of fat thick foamy bubbles that leave a large amount of deep tan lace all over the glass. Nose is a soft mix of spicey coffee and fresh chicory and toasty malt. At first sip you get a zesty rich burnt malt feel, sharp dry coffee notes and raw chicory. Mineral notes balance the coffee feel and almost help to showcase the integrity of the coffee. Mouthfeel is quite dry but does show a hint of sweetness. Mouth feel is malty thick. This is a nicely drinkable brew and a solid but slightly thin coffee stout."
"Very dark in color, basically black, with a dark brown 1/2 inch head. Lace strings are left on my glass. Rich smell of coffee, slightly bitter, like a strong cup of coffee and the grounds. Taste follows with more of that rich, slightly bitter coffee. Also some roasted chocolate malt. Mouthfeel was appropriate for the style. Overall, a pretty good slection, might be too strong in the coffee department for some, but I liked it. If it's going to be a coffee flavor, go all out."
"Anyway, I like it and I don't. It's certainly worth a try, so don't pass it up. And don't be afraid to cellar it - not normally a beer I would suggest keeping around without drinking fresh, but I find some of the mellowing with age uncovers the nice base stout underneath, even if it loses in immediacy."
"This impressed me more than the other Schlafly beverages, with the exception of their Saison. A good coffee stout, worth grabbing a sixer."
"This is well balanced for a stout, and I'm impressed Schlafly used local coffee in their brew. This is a step up from Guinness, and is worth the extra few bucks."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Boulevard Goblet. Poured just a shade lighter then jet-black, didnt allow much light to shine through. Head was a slight tan layer that dissipated very quickly. Aroma is of coffee (duh) and sweet oats. Taste is coffee and thats about all, and the coffee taste is pretty weak to boot. The body of the beer is pretty thin. Not much here. Its definitely a drinkable beer, I just dont know if I will seek it out again. Not a bad beer, just nothing very enduring either."
"This beer pours a very dark near black brown. It is supposedly made by mixing coffee with the schlafly oatmeal stout. Taking a big smell of this and you instantly get some roasted coffee and dark malts. A very nice smell. The taste is exquisite, taste just like it smells. A fairly decent mouthfeel, not super thick, but not thin. This is a superb coffee stout, but more than 2-3 would be overboard for me."
"I'm usually skeptical when it comes to these coffee beers but I enjoyed this one."
"Drinkability- Overall pretty tasty. Wouldn't turn one down if offered to me. My first beer from Schlafly scores well."
"Nice, deep chocolate color. Slight tan head that quickly fades. Mellow, roasted coffee aroma. Faint, chocolate aroma as well. Good roasted and grainy flavor. The level of coffee is very well done-not too much or little. Mouthfeel is just a tad thin for my liking but that doesnt detract from anything. Overall a nice, enjoyable, coffee brew. Well worth trying."
"d: With a good balance between the malt and coffee, this coffee beer is quite drinkable. The coffee flavor is pleasant, not too overpowering or acidic. It can get a bit filling though."
"Schlafly Coffee Stout pours a dark brownish black which is similar in appearace to none other than a cup of black coffee. The coffee/expresso smell really comes though which is also very evident in the taste as well. There is a slight bitter aftertaste, not overpowering by any means. I was hoping the mouthfeel would be a bit thicker seeing as how it's an oatmeal stout, just brewed with coffee beans, but none the less it does have a nice moderate body to it. One or two of these is definitely good, any more than that and the bitterness of the aftertaste starts to take presidence over the pleasant coffee taste this beer offers."
"Mellow and rich coffee flavor, roasty and woody. Body is a bit thin, but mimics coffee to an extent. Somewhat bitter and roasty, dry aftertaste. Dry cocoa and bakers chocolate linger. Coffee flavor is clean and isolated, lending a succinct character to define this coffee stout. Maybe not groundbreaking compared to Bells or Founders iterations, but it has a perceptible local following in southern Illinois and St. Louis for sure."
"Cheers to BARLEYWINEO for this one!"
"D- This beer has a smooth creamy mellow flavor with a big coffee bean taste. There are no cold and old coffee flavor but on the other had there are not many bitter flavors from the grain that really make a stout a stout."
"I like coffee stouts in general, but this one was not my favorite."
"D: This beer is quite nice and seems to be exactly what it's going for, but it's nothing exciing or original. Still, this is a solid choice for coffee stout lovers."
"Poured a black opaque color with a two inch beige head forming on top. A strong coffee aroma hits the nose right off the bat, followed by softer scents of chocolate and dark malt. The taste starts with the malt being ever present, with a tad bit of chocolate. The coffee tries very hard to become a fixture in the flavor as it was in the aroma, but it falls very short. A slightly thick mouthfeel, feels alot like skim milk, it finishes dry at the back of the palate. This became a bit of a disappointment, the color and aroma are very endearing, but the taste drags down what those two elements set up. This was just a lackluster beer."
"After pouring what was left down the sink, my buddy and I looked it up on this site. Judging by what's been said by others, we really hope that we had a bad bottle."
"Very tasty and balanced, and balanced is what I look for first in a coffee stout espsically if the acidity is too much which is not the case here. Paired well with a handful of chocolate cover espresso beans."
"Cheers."
"Pretty nice stout here from a local brewery. My first Schlafly."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice small one-finger plus creamy tannish head, lots of nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is of tons of roasted coffee malts. The finish is slightly dry. The taste is mostly roasted coffee malts. Medium body. Very drinkable, a nice coffee stout for sure."
"Prosit Mk"
"D - Poor. This is no good."
"I'm not thrilled with Kaldi's Coffee Stout, for reasons that have very little to do with the fact that I'm not a java junkie. I've given plenty of coffee-dominant stouts high scores if they've deserved them. I guess the moral of this story is that Schlafly needs to use a solid base beer (which Oatmeal Stout isn't) on the back end in order to get a solid coffee stout on the front end."
"Received in a trade from czoch75 -- thanks for this ""extra," Clint! Poured into a nonic at about 50 degrees, this is a dark cola-brown stout, with ruby-chestnut highlights and a fluffy, somewhat talkative, light tan head. Big roasted coffee aromas in the nose, along with some caramel-chocolate sweet scents and a bit of sour, black-roasted malt. A satisfying bouquet that approaches the sublimity of the noses of other more legendary coffee stouts made by Bell's and Founders. Good beers to emulate. Coffee permeates every part of the taste, with slightly sour dark-roasted grain flavors and a bready, cocoa-like sweetness. The non-coffee flavors are full and soft, providing a suitable contrast to the sharp bitterness of the coffee, which as I mentioned previously, is impossible to not notice. Impressive webby lacing, by the way. The palate is just a bit too thin for a stout with such a bold flavor profile. It's got a medium-full body, but I'm missing the oatmeal silkiness and richness of other coffee-forward stouts. Yes, I know every beer can't be Breakfast Stout, but that wouldn't really be so bad, now, would it? Anyway, this is a damn fine beer, perfect to sip on a snowy Sunday."
"The mouthfeel is thin for a stout. And the drinkability is down. One is fine but I can't see having more than one at a time given the potent, bitter coffee flavour. There is no lingering mouth puckering hops bitterness hanging around either. Not a bad beer, but could use some fine tuning."
"My biggest complaint was the lack of balance. There was too much coffee flavor and not enough toasted malty goodness to balance it out. I could enjoy one of these in a session, but that's all. If I were an a.m. drinking man, I could see myself really enjoying this with a plate of greasy fried eggs, bacon, and toast! But I really don't see myself doing that any time soon. It's worth a try, but maybe not a six-pack."
"Pours a jet black with just a slight reddish brown hue when held in the light. The head is pale brown in color and not too thick. Spotty lacing in the pint. The nose is rather powerful ... like cold coffee that's been sitting all day. I don't mean that in a bad way either ... very aromatic and very intense. Espresso and roasted malts. Patale is dark espresso roast coffee, sweet malts, and baker's chocolate. Really quite well done. The mouthfeel is on the thin side, which isn't bad but doesn't seem to match up with the strong flavor profile here. I'd love to see this in a thicker, slightly creamier version. Low carbonation and a dry lingering coffee finish. I truly enjoyed this brew. Very well executed and surprisingly easy to drink."
"An impressively well-balanced integration of coffee flavor into this stout. Poured black, as one would expect. Off white head tinged with tan. A whiff of fresh ground coffee beans in the aroma. Pleasant roasted malt flavor was predominant, with some strong-brewed coffee in the background. A nice fullness to the mouthfeel. Unlike some coffee stouts that taste like a stout with some cold black coffee dumped in, this beer unites the flavors in a very pleasant way."
"Thanks to kmpitz2 for the taste"
"Make no mistakes this is a coffee stout! Other coffee stouts use some really expensive mocha, espresso, starbucks. Not this monster. This smells and tastes like the coffee grinds left in the filter from your local Quick Stop. If youre a die hard daily multiple cup, cheap coffee drinker,then this is your beer. The appearance and mouthfeel was fine, I just didnt like the strength and flavor of the coffee used. Worth a try."
"Soft, low carbonation gives a richer feel to the mouth than is really there. A bit too much coffee to have more than one or two at a sitting, but I still like this quite a bit."
"Smell is a robust espresso coffee flavor, with a tad bit of malt sweetness. Tastes like cold coffee with fizz. Mouthfeel is lighter than what I usually look for in a stout. This would be greatly improved with a bit of creaminess added to it. This seems fairly one dimensional"
"Mouthfeel was lacking stout creaminess. Zesty medium to high carbonation was uncharacteristic. This one was more scrubby than expected. Moderated body."
"D - I really am not a huge fan of coffee (mostly because I don't like hot drinks). I expected the coffee taste to be more subtle. That being said I actually liked the beer."
"D: The ale's espresso-like body is a great change of pace, providing both an acidic strength and an oatmeal smoothness."
"Well, happy to see this on local shelves. The beer delivers a big aromatic punch of espresso beans and roasted goodness. Its all about the coffee up front. Flavors are dominated by solidly brewed espresso with a supporting stout character. The stout has difficulty standing up to the immense coffee characteristics, but contributes malt sweetness, toffee, caramel, and a hint of vanilla and brown sugar. The oats in the brew round the coffee nicely, but maybe too much so. The beer needs some rough edges to compete with the coffee acidity and strength. Feels full and rich to the mouth and finishes with a velvety slickness. Aftertastes are all coffee in nature. A good beer, but an American Stout backbone would have been better."
"Thanks Ric...nice stuff."
"I am intrigued by this stout. It's both flavorful and approachable. It's a sessionable coffee stout. This is the first Schlafly product I've bought, and it's made a good first impression on this beer advocate."
"12 oz bottle. The brew pours a deep brown to almost black color with a faint ruby highlite around the edges. The head is massive, working up to 3 fingers tall. It leaves really nice lace as it falls to about a finger over top. There is little to no carbonation working up the sides of my glass. The aroms on this one is all about the coffee. It smells like a nice moderate roast coffee with a hint of sweetness and creamyness from the oatmeal stout base. This one really smells a lot like freshly ground coffee. I like it. The flavor brings the same intensity of coffee that I found in the aroma. This carries all the way through the beer. The aftertaste presents a mild creamy oat character with a mild roasted maltyness, but it definately screams coffee here. Mouthfeel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. It is a little slick from the oats, but nothing bad. I think this is an incredibly good coffee stout, with a ton of coffee in both the aroma and flavor. It is a bit one dimensional, but I think that is what makes this beer what it is. I am happy to have 4 more of these."

"One of the better products from the nice folks at Schlafley. A very well put together American stout that is a pleasure to sip."
"pint at the brewpub. looks ok. head gone very quickly. black. served too cold to have much odor. taste is really, really bland, at least for what i was expecting. too yeasty and not really coffee flavored at all. tastes more like an oatmeal stout i made where the yeast went wild and overwhelmed the beer. dont need to have this again. no thanks."
"Poured a 12 oz into my 0.4 L rastal tulip stuck my nose into the glass and I was back in St. Louis's Kaldi with Greg - their skilled roastemaster wating for the second crack before emptying the 75 lbs of hot beans to air dry. This flavor and aroma has been embellished over '05 vintage. I am sending a couple of my California homebrewers some beans along with a cold toddy recipe and am hoping they have the solid oatmeal stout recipes similar to Schlafly's to support the huge coffee flavor and aroma."
"If you like your coffee strong, dark, and black, then this one is for you."
"So - give this a try regardless of what you are looking for in a beer - it is an interesting experience worth trying!"
"Pours black. No light shines through. Small brown head that dissapates rather quickly. Moderate lacing. Smells of a rich dark coffee, and maybe some roasted malts in there. Taste is where this beer excels. Deep roasted malt flavor. Dark rich coffee. And a bit of a toast taste give this an exceptional flavor. Feels thick rich and crisp in the mouth. I could drink these all day. Of the beers I received in the trade from Dertbert this is the biggest suprise and my favorite so far. I love stouts and this is an excellent one."
"Wow!! I don't know where to begin with this beer. Poured out the color of a very dark porter. Not totally black but almost. A thin head with little lacing. The smell is of roasted oatmeal and coffee. The taste is incredible. You first notice the oatmeal with a coffee taste left for the finish. The mouthfeel is very smooth. Nothing detracts from this brew. The only thing keeping me from driving to St. Louis to get a case is I am kinda tired. But I am thinking of calling in sick in the morning. So you could say I think this is a worthwhile beer. I will cross paths with this brew again."
"Thanks MJR, for my first two Schlafly brews."
"Poured a dark ruby into my pint glass, with a creamy dark brown chocolate head. The nose was of deep espresso, chocolate, bitter hop and malt. Taste was predominately the espresso and the hops. You know when you drink a coffee, and towards the end of the cup, it becomes kind of cold and slightly sour? That's what this tasted like. But good."
" The taste is pretty good. I find myself liking it more as I progress through the glass. Coffee is the dominant flavor, with a mild stouty profile. Mouthfeel is good, even if it is a bit light. This would make a nice session beer."
"For a stout, especially supposedly made with oatmeal, the body is amazingly light/medium. Drinkability is not bad. Should go well with desserts but it actually worked well with tacos."
"Not the best drinkability or mouthfeel in the world of stouts, but still a worthy offering."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/4"" tan head above the burgundy brown brew. Pillowy head fades very slowly, with heavy lacing. Aroma is of dark malts and coffee. Taste seems a bit light on the dark malts and coffee, and a bit of fruity shines through. Mouthfeel isn't quite as hearty as I'd look for in a stout, but drinkability is still quite nice. Not a bad product, this one right here..."
"Medium body with medium carbonation make it a easy drinking american coffee stout"
"I know I seemed a little rough on this beer, but it wasn't bad. It was actually very quaffable, as evidenced by the fact that the drinkability score is the highest one. I just expect more from a coffee stout than this provided. I think the problem might be that the base stout just doesn't have the balls to handle this assignment. I would like to see them try this again with a beefier brew."
"Nice and solid version with lots of coffee flavors."
"From MJR. Thanks bro'. Super cola-like in appearance. Brown with a small white head that rises up and than dies leaving some nice lacing. Carbonation is big bubbled, and frothy. Aromas are fresh espresso, some lightly roasted malts, and maybe some slight hops. The taste is coffee like, but weak-coffee like with some roasted coffee notes and a subtle hoppiness that is very much in the background. There are also some chocolate notes in the mix as well and maybe some caramel? Mouthfeel is too light and this hurts the drinkability a little bit. This is very light for a stout, and it almost comes accross as more of a coffee porter. I'd love to know the abv on this. A solidly good, but not spectacular coffee-infused beer."
"Dark brown in hue, blacker in the middle with some ruby influences around the edges. Even when the liquid is backlit the opaqueness holds-up well. The head was beige in color; at the apex the foam was two-fingers in height, the bubbles faded quickly to a soapy cap with some naked spots in the middle, thicker around the edges. There wasnt much subsequent lacing, just a few short-lived clumps. On the whole, this beer looks like what it should but little more. The nose is, well, coffee. Iced espresso. Day old spend grains. Roasted beans. There are hints of chocolate and a dash of milk-like sweetness. Wow, there is no fooling around here! I love the fact the potency is high and the aromas are allowed to fully explore my olfactory. For a Coffee Stout the complexity is fairly high, I could imagine something more in the bouquet like a tickle of hops or some smoke but Im a greedy dick. For a beer of this sort I really like what I smell. Powerful. Inviting. The palate is far less complex and deep as the nose indicated. This is a major bummer. The espresso qualities are dimmer and the day old coffee flavors move into the forefront. This is always a worry with me when it comes to Coffee Stouts. It really needs to be the other way around. It is so hard to capture the goodness of coffee without turning it into something that you find at the end of a day at a Quickie Mart. You know, stale coffee. The acidity from the roast is way too naked, their needs to be more sweetness, malt depth, and/or hop bitterness. The palate lacks roundness, it is too sharp where is the harmony? Plus the fact the body is so small this really hurts the development of the palate. One-dimensional. Boring. Straightforward. You get the point, right? It is not sophisticated enough to pair with dessert. Medium-light in body, the carbonation is firm, and the mouthfeel is lousy. There needs to be way more body to make this beer work. Skinny. The taste and mouthfeel of this beer reminded me a lot of Spilker Ales XPO Espresso Stout (RIP), that is too bad because that beer had some flaws as does this one. Sure it is drinkable but Im bored with it and one bottle is enough for me, thankfully, I only had one bottle. This was purchased at the Tap Room in St. Louis as part of a mixed six-pack. I say skip it."
"I had one of the best coffee and beer combinations ever. It was Red Hook's Double Espresso stout and it is miles above what Tom Schlafly is calling a coffee stout. The smell of coffee is vaguely present. I often use the toddy method to brew my morning coffee and it is a great method. The method is wasted in this brew. I may have gotten a bad six-pack but I live in St. Louis and grabbed a six as soon as it came available at my local mega mart. The brew had decent color but the nose was sour, the taste spicy in a puckering kinda way, and the finish was lackluster."
"In summary, still nice; however, although in theory the melding of my two loves (coffee and beer) should be an easy winner, it works less well in practise."
"This beer pours dark brown with a creamy head. The head fades somewhat quickly leaving few laces. As soon as the beer is poured, you are assulted by a very strong coffee aroma. Hidden is a malty aroma, but the coffee aroma is dominant. It tastes very coffee like. I guess that is because it is a coffee stout. It tastes just like cold coffee with alcohol. It is very impressive. Other coffee stouts only have a mild coffee flavor, but this one has very strong flavors. It leaves a coffee taste in the mouth. It is rather pleasent. It is carbonated just right. This beer would be a great session beer. It is very tasty and it doesnt have too much alcohol. If I could get this beer where I live, I would drink it all the time. The rating it has doesnt give it justice."
"Wow. What a dessert, er, beer. The pour looks just like the oatmeal stout, but you can barely detect the coffee under the malt chocolate in the aroma. The taste is outstanding - you start with the oatmeal stout and then finish with an enjoyable cappuccino flavor. Drinkability is a paradox, the first one, and then the second were outstanding  then its like a 2nd pumpkin ale or a dessert, it starts to become overwhelming. Would be a great after dinner finishing beer."
"Poured a dark, dark karo syrup brown with garnet highlights. Head tan and fine. Nice lace. The aroma is good roast coffee. Very faint hops if any. The taste is delicious coffee and chocolate. No harsh bitterness, just the right amount to meet the style. A little thin on the mouth feel, but a nice finish. Extremely drinkable."
"Dark black with a thin tan head; a massive blast of coffee beans on the nose, a comparison to walking into a crowded coffee shop where everyone is drinking dark roasted java. Ok. Coffee beans noted up front; espresso, burnt malts, pretty creamy and just a bit dry. A bit of a watery palate; yet there is a full mouthfeel with the feeling of fresh brewed java on the tongue. Coffee dominated all the way; I need to know right now  Youre in or Youre out? Im in. The folks at Schlafly have once again delivered!"
"Overall, this is a very nice offering, but I'd like to see more aroma in the presentation. Still, I'd go for it again, and again."
"Dark brown almost black in color, has a nice big creamy light brown head, strong roasted coffee aroma. Huge coffee flavor in this one, almost overpowering but very tasty, full, thick mouthfeel with a beautiful burnt bitterness, if you like strong coffee you will like this...I love it."
"A fantastic blend of Schlafly Stout and local coffee-bar favorite Kaldi's coffee. Probably better than the Red Hook / Starbuck's combo -- if nothing else than it's all local. A distinctive brew, though not without it's detractors. I, for one, love it."
