3.8,5,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"a real unique take on the style here. it looks alright, maybe a little thin in body and short on head, not quite as decadent and dreamy as the best ones look, but certainly nothing wrong with it in my wine glass. the nose is what gets interesting. it really smells like fresh canned blueberry jam, true and through, its insane how the dark fruit rises above the roast of the barley and the sweetness of the oats. eyes closed i would think i am smelling blueberry pie or jam, or that stuff they put on your belgian waffle at dennys. flavors i am not used to in a stout for sure, the taste is just like the nose, but i get the stout part too this time. it is indeed a little thin, lacking on the oat richness, but this curious blueberry thing more than makes up for it in terms of the overall enjoyment of the brew. havent had much from browns, so this is a pretty inspiring first impression. more body would make this, its a little too slick as it is, and could dry out just a touch, but a really solid beer, different because of the berry element. i really liked this.","StonedTrippin","Oct 26, 2014"

Pours the color and clarity of cola with a thin fizzy head that effervesces and dissipates immediately off the pour. Nose is not what I expected - cherry notes dominate, followed by the merest suggestion of dark malts and maybe a hint of brown sugar. Taste - not great, tart cherries, acidic, old coffee grounds, metallic notes - it's pretty bad. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a lively, almost prickly carbonation and some astringency. Well - hopefully this is just a bad bottle, but this is one of the worst beers I've had in a while. Definitely infected if I had to guess. The first beer I've drain-poured in quite a while.","Jwale73","Feb 10, 2013"

Aromas of light roast coffee and cream, with a hint molasses and chocolate. Flavors are rich and smooth on a light body. Coffee and hazelnut character come forward first, with a smooth chocolate and caramel malt backbone to keep the brew on the sweeter side of bitter.

Being that I am a huge fan of dark stouts, I did enjoy this beer. However, I found it to be average at best when it comes to Oatmeal stouts. This beer was a bit too fizzy for a stout, lost it's head rather quickly, and had a clear/thin appearance along the edges of the glass. The taste, though with some of that trademark oatmeal taste, was slightly bitter and not as full, rich, or creamy as better Oatmeal stouts often are. I remember enjoying this stout more when I visited the Brown's brewery in Troy, NY and had it out of the tap. I will give this another try, though am not impressed with this bottled effort.","dstanmyer","Mar 02, 2010"

Pours a dark brown color with more than a finger of creamy tan head. Lighter brown color comes through the edges. Fair amount of lace clings along the glass and the head displays minor powers of retension. Roasty nose includes scents of coffee, chocolate and citrus hops. Taste is filled with minerals, coffee and fresh sweet grainy flavor. Feel is smooth, light and a bit low on the carbonation. Lingering taste of burnt grain, chocolate and a bit of bitterness that can be attributed to the combination of hops and burnt grain. Quite warming for 5% as I reach the half way point of my first glass. Alcohol is noticeable in warmth but not flavor. Overall not bad.","stakem","Jan 30, 2010"

3.91,8,3,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"The flavor rescues my short-lived disappointment with the mouthfeel with an interesting balance of sweet, chocolate malts, and neutral hops. Overall this is quite mild. Not bad in the long run.","puboflyons","Mar 12, 2009"
3.87,6.9,3.5,4,4,3,4,"Overall, a pretty good example of the style. The only thing I really don't like here is the carbonation level being so high. Other than that it is pretty good.","mothman","Feb 23, 2009"
4.52,24.9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"This ranks right around the top of the oatmeal stout category for me. It has the whole package - great looking in the glass, killer aroma, and full, delicious flavor. Hopefully they continue to brew and distribute lots of this!","kkosmoski","Dec 10, 2008"
3.5,-3.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured a dark brown with a two-finger tan head. The smell is heavy on oats with some chocolate. The taste is mostly roasted malt with a tiny bit of coffee and chocolate flavors in the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly thick with a fairly small amount of carbonation. This is a tasty little oatmeal porter that is enjoyable if a little one-dimensional.","TheTrevor","Sep 10, 2008"

3.46,-4.4,2.5,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Notes: Adam gave this to me a while ago, and it's sat dormant in my fridge for ages. I saw it today and was just in the mood... to be frank, it could be slightly better in looks and mouthfeel, but it's worthy of a bit more than the credit it gets.","SaucyA","May 23, 2008"
2.78,-23.2,4,3.5,2.5,2,2.5,"Pours a mostly black color with a medium lived light tan head. Smell is smooth lightly roasted malt and creaminess. Taste is lightly roasty with a metallic and dry finish. Medium to light bodied but a bit of a watery flavor. Kind of a dull flavor and a touch tart, almost as if this isn't very fresh. No idea of bottles age, however.","JDV","Feb 29, 2008"
3.54,-2.2,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"M + D: A little on the thin side... I tend to love the rich and creamy feel in oatmeal stouts and this one falls a bit short there. It still manages to have a reasonable feel, though, so not too much love lost. At a modest 5%, it could be a session candidate. Dunno if I'd go about having it that way, but I'd certainly give it another shot. Not too bad at all.","Proteus93","Jan 18, 2008"
3.09,-14.6,2.5,3.5,3,3,3,"D - overall an okay oatmeal stout that I was happy to try but would not try to seek out too much. I do really like the caramel corn smell as it is one of my favorite foods but it is really not to prominent and overall the taste on the beer is average as it does not blow me away nor make me want to run away.","jeonseh","Dec 30, 2007"
3.12,-13.8,3,3.5,3,2,3.5,"Drinkability- Overall this definitely isnt the greatest beer Ive ever had but all-in-all its not bad. If I wouldnt have known what this beer was (Oatmeal Stout) I would have guessed that it was a Porter. Definitely to thin for the style but tasty none-the-less. Big thanks again to drseamus for the opportunity!","younger35","Dec 16, 2007"
3.14,-13.3,4,2.5,3.5,3,3,"Mouthfeel is a bit thin and slightly over carbonated. Couldnt drink too much of this one. Not completely bad, the flavor is ok but drinkability suffers because the aroma is too sweet to overcome.","seaoflament","Nov 04, 2007"
4.15,14.6,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"I was pleasantly surprised to see that Brows has started bottling their beers in 12 oz. Bottles. I picked up a mix of the three that they are currently offering which is the Oatmeal Stout, Pale Ale and IPA. Bottle presentation is very classy, nice looking label. Notes on it say Smooth, silky and rich. Brown's Oatmeal Stout was declared the worlds finest example of th style by the Brewers Association  taking home a Gold Medal at the World Beer Cup in 2004. We handcraft every batch using two-row pale, black caramel and chocolate malts. Willamette hops and a heapin' helping of flaked rolled oats. I have had thee before on tap while visiting the brewery but had only reviewed the Oat before. The oat from the bottle poured to a pitch black color with a think two finger medium colored head that has very good retention and has left chunks of lacing down the side of the glass. The aromas are rich with roasted malts that also give off tastes of chocolate and caramel. The flavor has a little odd tail end to it but not in a bad way, very enjoyable, The feel is very smooth and creamy. For a local brew, this is very good, will be a staple during the winter months.","Stimack","Oct 17, 2007"
3.15,-13,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours an absolute black with a weak one finger frothy head that quickly dies down to a thin layer of almost nothing. Stickiness is pretty weak, hardly anything holding on what so ever. Smell is pretty weak, you really have to put your nose down in there to get much of anything. Some sweet toasted oat, light caramel malt, and some brown sugar. Watered down roasted barley with some french roast coffee and milk chocolate on the tongue. Aftertaste is a charred oak with a tiny bit of molasses. Mouthfeel is pretty light and watery with a mild carbonation. I was pretty let down by this brew, lacking a lot in terms of flavor. I'll have to try this on tap and see how it compares. Next on the list from Brown's, their IPA.","BeerTruth","Oct 08, 2007"
4.23,16.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Very nice oatmeal stout. The beer pours a really nice black color with a nice tan colored head. The smell is of a really malty aroma with hints of a nice sweet aroma. The taste is really good, very subtle and not overpowering. Hints of a subtle hops don't overpower the oatmeal and malts. The aftertaste is really clean with hints of a chocoalte taste. The carbonation is perfect and this is a very drinkable beer, If you are in the Troy, NY area, you have to try this beer. Really Really Excellent. Stouts are my favorite beers and this is definately in the top 10.","erosier","Jun 04, 2007"
3.07,-15.2,3,3.5,3,2.5,3,"On tap at the Man of Kent,poured from the tap an ink black with a very thin almost fizzy almond colored head that was gone very quickly.Highly roasted in the nose and quite dry nearly burnt,very thin boarderline watery mouthfeel led to lesser flavor in my mind it was pretty roasted with a hint of coffee.Not to impressed with this it just lacked alot of depth flavor and mouthfeel wise in my opinion.","oberon","Mar 31, 2007"
1.45,-59.9,1.5,1.5,1.5,2,1,"Zero on the carbonation, it's much like a flat watered-down cola. Slightly tangy, tons of carmel, sticky sweet. Isovaleric, phenolic, and some mercaptan (off-putting defects). Maybe too much roasted barley made it too thick? Undrinkable. Has a sweet roasted porter-type flavor. I don't think this was a very old bottle, and I also think they need to be alot more thorough with the sanitation around the brewery. Hope this helps.","rayjay","Dec 29, 2006"
4.15,14.6,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Had this on tap at Brown's. It pours nice and dark with a small off-white head. There is a good roasted aroma with a bit of sweetness. The taste is really good. It has the classic oatmeal smoothness and a good amount of sweetness and roasted malt too. The slight disappointment is in the mouthfeel. It is a bit thinner than i would like. The drinkability is high though.","drseamus","Jul 14, 2006"
4.28,18.2,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Had this on tap at Brown's last night. Poured a nice black, with a brown head that settled down to a nice lacing. The smell was nice and roasty, with a hint of coffee. Taste was of toasted oats up front, with a bit of typical roasted coffee in addition. Mouthfeel was surprisingly light, a little thinner than I usually like. Overall, a very good and drinkable beer.","TheWhaleShark","Aug 12, 2005"

3.65,0.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet crystal and chocolate malt scent with some roasted notes and a dry oatmeal aroma. The taste is decent. It has an extremely dry flavor that boasts of roasted, crystal, and chocolate malts along with lots of oats. It has a dry, earthy finish. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good brew. It is so damn dry, I'm not sure I could drink more than one.","WesWes","Beers"
3.62,0,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A pretty middle of the road Oatmeal Stout. The nutty character is what makes this one unique for the style. Drinkable but nothing special.","NEhophead","0"
