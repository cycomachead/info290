"Feel: Well chosen low carbonation. Medium-full bodied. Nicely smooth."

"A pretty decent stout, okay flavor, but not fantastic. There are better oatmeal stouts."
""

"Pours a dark brown color with a slightly off white head. Aroma of roasted malt, charcoal, somewhat meaty. Brewed with oatmeal but not nearly as smooth as some of the more famed versions of the style. Thin, boring, not really flavorful. Roasted malt, faint hops, bit of coffee. Thin, over force carbonated mouthfeel. Most American breweries take on this style and are much more inspired. Sub par."
""
""
"Overall, given the fact that Blue Point is a great brewery, this is an astonishing dud."

"Very enjoyable beer. When this brew arrived very little head was left. Not sure if it dwindled down before arrival or what. Loved the nose. Nice chocolates, coffee, roasted. Complimented this brew with some red velvet cake, went very well! The decadent notes in the beer with the decadent flavors of the cake are hard to beat. Nice smooth mouth feel. Definitely something I would drink again."

"Well, this is a weird beer. It looks tasty, the mouthfeel is great, the aroma is solid if perhaps a touch over-roasted, but there's something just a little bit off on the taste. If I knew more about how to catch beers with infections that haven't fully taken over yet, I might be able to describe it better, because I have a sneaky feeling that's what's going on here. There's a tart, slightly fruity flavor in the back that really doesn't fit the beer's flavor profile. It's too bad, because this would be a tasty one otherwise."
""
""
""
"It's an easy drinker. ABV is only moderate at best. There's no alcohol or hop presence. It looks and smells pretty good, but it tastes and feels more like a water down soft drink."
"This wasn't very good."
""
""
""
""
"Strong aroma has firm tones of roast coffee, semi-sweet chocolate and molasses plus a hint of honey. It is sweet but not cloying or repulsive. Pours a deep sable just a whisker or two above black with a thick, fluffy and rather persistent light tan head. Flavor, unfortunately, does not quite live up to the very tempting aroma. It has the mocha and molasses tones that the aroma promised, but these are on the wan and watery side. Texture has watery body and not much fizz. Finish is smoky with coffee, chocolate and caramel notes. OK, not great, but worthy of at least a try."

"O - One of me favorites from Blue Point. Wish this was in a 6 pack."
""
"Overall a dissapointment. There are way too many good stouts around for me to ever revisit this."
""

"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours crystal clear very dark brown color with a 1 finger fairly dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, oats, toast, light char, herbal, molasses, and dark fruitiness. Nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of oats, roasted malt, chocolate, caramel, coffee, light char, toast, bread, toffee, light citrus, and light herbal. Lingering notes of oats, roasted malt, caramel, chocolate, coffee, light char, and herbal on the finish for a bit. Nice balance and robustness of flavors; no cloying on the finish at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice oatmeal stout. Nice balance and robustness of flavors; very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the nose. There were nice fruity and buttery inclusions, adding a big degree of depth, and surprising layer of complexity. The flavoring showed equally as robust qualities, with that huge vanilla off the bat. This both added to, and helped to cut, the sweetness. In the end the balance was set by the malty tone, and the beer is fun to drink."
"o - Overall a pretty decent stout. The beer looks great and smells awesome, full of coffee, roasted notes, and chocolate. The taste is okay, though a bit weak, and the body is a little too thin. Not my favorite oatmeal stout or BP beer, but worth checking out."
""
"O - I've been drinking this beer for years, it's about time I rate it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Enjoyable and very easy to drink with the lighter body and lower ABV. This beer is pretty close to being sessionable and is a great value beer ($3.99)."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I have and you have had better oatmeal stouts, granted for the price it does the job. Not meant to wow, it just enough. Salud!"
""
""
"Easy drinking for a chewy beer, this was above average and more flavorful than a standard Guinness. Definitely worth trying, the low ABV makes it quite sessionable."
""
"Overall this is a well crafted oatmeal stouts but I like mine a touch sweeter. Exceptional session ability since it went down smooth even when it was room temperature (sipped on it for over an hour)."
"The stout poured a magnificent dark brown with a fine tan head. The aroma was of toasted malt. The taste is rich toasted malt with a little bit of sweetness in the finish. The feel is medium smooth and dry. A very nice entry smooth and toasty. This is stout you could sip on all night."
""
""
"Not bad but not as good as I was hoping."
""
"Medium body and medium effervescence. A decent brew but just middle of the pack for style. No sweetness to speak of either. So, nothing special here."
""
"Overall: Decent beer overall. It doesn't taste anything like what I expect from an oatmeal stout. I wouldn't recommend this one."
""
""
""
"This beer is refreshing and drinkable, but underwhelming. It's true to style but there's nothing that stands out for me."
""
""
""
"O – Pretty decent stout. Aroma and taste were weaker then expected but still it’s tasty. Would love to see a more aggressive version of this."
""
""
""
"This beer is poured out a little thinner looking than I expected. The color of the beer was a dark brown and doesn't look too much like a stout to me. The head was thin and basically vanished into nothing. The smell of the beer was a little roasted. The taste of the beer was toasted and a little dry. The mouthfeel was very thin in my opinion. Overall I wasn't super thrilled with this beer, I might try it again but not if it's from a cask."
""
""
"Not a flavorful stout. However it does provide a roasty brew with low abv which is rare. A couple of notches above your standard Guiness (not Foreign Export)."
"Overall I like this beer a lot, somewhat reminiscent of a coffee or a chocolate stout."
"On the thinner side, borderline watery. Very easy to drink though. A warm weather stout."
"Swung by the brewery after work to check things out and it was hopping. Beer was a deep watery black with off white bubbling. Smells great of chocolate roasted malts. Tastes just as nice, but the flavor has a lot more roasted character to ot. This is a really tasty oatmeal stout with a great body and fantastic drinkability. Almost like an oatmeal stout crossed with a porter from the watery porter tingle. Pretty thin for an oatmeal stout."
"Looks decent, black body with big brown head, but dissipates fast. The smell is weak but but chocolate and roasted aromas can be picked out here and in the flavor. The body is very thin. Maybe they should just multiply the recipe by 1.5, because it just seems all around weak."
"o: There is a pretty good stout here, but the cask hinders this one I suspect."
"Just ok."
"C+ / B-"
"D: fine for a meal or by itself. easy to drink aside from a little too much carbonation. Reasonable abv for style"
"Palate is light on body but with too high of carbonation. Still drinkable enough for me to order another."
"Overall, this is an okay beer. Its nothing special so I wouldn't bother seeking it out but if its on tap I'd give it a go. I was honestly a little disappointed with it because I had tried a few stouts at the brewery (forget which) and liked them. Maybe its just because I've been drinking lots of doubles lately but it was thin on flavor."
"Cheers!"
"Draft at Prime 16. Very watery, black with some head and lace. Water tasted clorine. Not working. Some chocolate malt,malting and some roast but not really a sweet stout style. Fairly weak for the style. I could use this for cooking however.Passable."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and packs in a lot of flavor without seeming to be very filling, which makes this one sessionable."
"The key word with this beer is ""light."" Everything about this beer is light. Sure the coffee smell was nice, but I really wanted a thick and creamy stout, not a dark light beer. I can't say I would seek this beer out anywhere."
"On cask at Tap and Table in Emmaus for $6. It went great with the Cahill Porter Cheddar on the cheese plate. The body was light and very drinkable. I'd certainly have ordered more, if the night had allowed. The flavor has a mix of baker's chocolate, slightly sour roasted coffee, and that smooth oatmeal cookie taste."
"Very easy to drink, this is an enjoyable stout!"
"Another welcomed discovery at My Place in Newtown, CT this beauty poured into a pint glass is a dark opaque black with a fair oatmeal colored head and beautiful lacing. The aroma brings mild charcoal and some wheat hints. The flavor follows suit with stronger charcoal and a very nice herbal hop. Medium plus body with a dry finish that also brings some chocolate touches. Very nice and plenty drinkable for the style."
"D - It's so weak and light it'll go down fast but I'm not looking for a stout to chug. If you want to fill up your beer pong cups with a stout - use this one. If you want something with any character at all - avoid this one."
"M/D: Given the dominance of the smoke, by the end it felt like drinking toasted gasoline. I couldn't finish the pint, and I always finish my pints. It was a beer that started off well, and just fell apart completely in all aspects."
"Great choice."
"Had this on cask at Pizza Plant. Poured black with a dense creamy tan head. Roasted aroma and taste to match with subtle chocolate and coffee notes as well and a dry roasty finish. Very creamy - if I hadn't seen it come out of the beer engine I may almost have thought that this was nitro-tap. Quite drinkable."
"6/4/6/3/12 (3.1/5)"
"D: I have had this many times and it really is a great beer on cask. On tap it is ok but on cask it shines. This is a really good session beer for the colder months. Well done Blue Point."
"Really simple, really good."
"Overall - quite impressive. This oatmeal stout has the sweet creaminess and the silky texture of a good oatmeal stout. Definitely one of the better o. stouts out there. I highly recommend it if you're around the NY area and can get your hands on one of these beauties."
"D - very easy drinking brew, low abv makes it even easier."
"I was surprised at how good this one was on cask. The body was light and nutty with roasted malts towards the end. The mouthfeel stayed very light a smooth for the whole drink. The smell was full, rich, and nice. And the drinkability was pretty good as well as it was very easy to drink, light bodied and pleasant. I like this beer cask the best so far. Hope to have it again."
"Drinkability: Great beer to enjoy with a meal, but average overall. A little smokey compared to others Ive enjoyed."
"Thick creamy three finger head with an dark tan hue when Jess pours it from the cask into the plastic Blue Point pint cups in the tasteing room at the brewery. A soft toasty stout aroma with detectable undertones of coffee. Creamy and crisp taste fadeing to a faint coffee flavor with a smooth dry finish thats got something to do with the use of oats. Light, crisp, and silky body with cask creamy carbonation. Delicious beer greatness."
"Not too complex, fairly average all around."
"D: This had pretty good drinkability and would make a great session beer."
"Overall this is the best Blue Point has to offer, and on cask it's even better. If you can find it, certainly try it."
"Beef Notes: I love me some oatmeal stout, and this one is a home run. The perfect dessert or even breakfast beer. It definitely gives Heart of Darkness a run for its money. I just wish it was more readily available around here."
"brew."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easy, just a little filling, this one borders on being a coffee porter, which I like, a good twist on the Oatmeal Stout style. I liked this beer, but Id just like to see a little bit more of a kick to it."
"Easy to consume with the abv @ less than 5%...at $8 for a refill, I'd be all over this one time and time again."
"Because it is not as sweet, it's drinkability is very high. Just an all around great oatmeal stout to be had here. Couple this with the Blueberry Ale to make a great Black & Blue. Mmm."
"Appears with a dark cola ruby brown body it's dark when not held to the light and it forms a moccha tan head leaves behind fine lacing after dwindling slowly. Aromatics have dominant dark roasted malt features like mild coffee and dark chocolate, semi soft oatmeal grains as well, not bad. Flavor has powdered cocoa notes and a blend of leafy hop flavors hitting the palate, as it warms a bit more oats come across with a soft smooth mineral character. Dark roasts provide a mild bitterness with more dark chocolate and mild coffee not as sweet as some Oatmeal Stouts out there but this one does a good job of supporting the other two solid Blue Point brews I've tasted thus far. Mouthfeel is medium bodied even carbonation very smooth but I like more fluffy character and a bit more overall body from my oatmeal stous references to compare would be like Wild Goose's, McClausen's, or Troeg's versions. Drinkability is definitely not an issue here great example of a classic style just so many beers to choose from out there, I'm sure I will revisit this offering try it if you find it draft only in the Burgh."
"A good drinkable stout. A nice American adaptation of the style."
"I'm a big oatmeal stout fan, so I knew I would like it before I even tried it; that being said, I would say this is middle-of-the-road for a beer of this type. It's no samuel smith, but worth the cash all the same."
"A standard of mine at the bar as it is reliable and delicious."
"On cask at the Pizza Plant,poured a near opaque black with just a hint of ruby in the body with a creamy mocha colored top that stuck around till I finished my pint.Unsweetened chocolate and earth dominated the aromas,not very sweet at all flavor wise unsweetened chocolate and earth dominated the flavors almost like a dry stout.Body was a tad thin but it lent to its drinkability as it went down easily.One of the few stouts I have had on cask,a flavorful if no frills oatmeal stout."
"Had this on tap while at David Copperfields the other night. Brew was poured to a opaque black color with a frothy tan head that had fantastic retention and left chunky lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is also fantastic with strong notes of chocolate malt, nice roasted scents mixed with a pleasant oat smell. The taste is very good, a little harsh with a burnt flavor at the start but breaks away to a smooth creaminess of caramel and oat flavors. Does have a hop characteristic and is noticeable but plays nice. Over all this is a fine brew, what I feel a oatmeal stout should be like. Characteristics lend it to a great seasonal (colder months) session brew. If you can give it a try, I dont think you will be upset."
"The beer pours a deep dak black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a dry oatmeal scent along with loads of black patent and chocolate malts. The taste is good. It has a smooth black/chocolate malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry with an oatmeal feel. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good oatmeal stout. It has good flavor and a kick ass aroma; a good drinker."
"Nothing bad about this beer for stout fans. Very solid across the board."
"Sweet tasting with a dry finish. Definite hints of chocolate and coffee, with a burst of sweetness towards the end. Dry finish. Not as thick as other stouts but very rich and satisfying."
"D: A tasty stout to be sure, but gets a little trying towards the end -- probably because it's a bit too sweet for my taste. Still, I would get it again, so I guess that says something."
"Had on tap at some bar in NYC, all I know is it is less than 5 minutes from CBGBs...we just stopped in for a quick one. Deep dark chocolate brwon, frothy tan head. Aroam was the expected roastyness, with an additional tangy quality as well. Malty, a pinch dry, the citrusy finish was unexpected as well."
"In the past I had only tried one other Oatmeal Stout, made by British Superpower Samuel Smith. Bluepoint certainly got something good here. If you are into dark beers this is a must try. The beer is very dark yet not full of the burnt flavor other dark beers posses. I have tried on many occasions to drink this all night, the only problem is I get full first. So I generally brink a Growler to an occasion, let a couple people try .... ??? an oatmeal beer??? but I hate oatmeal.... well so do I! But the beer is a classic"
"A very dark brown nearly black ale with a light brown head that was quick to leave. Big roasted malt aroma with hints of chocolate and coffee. The flavor starts out with that roasted malt bitterness and finishes smoothly with those hints of chocolate and coffee. A marleous robust mouthfeel but maybe too much for multipile drinks."
"It has nice tiny creamy bubbles, but I can't say it tastes all that distinctive: dark malt, bit of wine in the finish, like sherry or port, not particularly oatmealy. A decent stout. The more I drink, the more I think it's like Guinness without the nitro, it's a bit sour, a bit metallic, a bit sweet. But nothing much of anything."
"Cask-conditioned at The Ginger Man, Manhattan. Black in colour with a good tan head and good glass lacing. Aroma was moderately malty. Taste was smooth with roast malt dominating, with dark chocolate notes also in evidence. Dry, clean finish. A good, easy-drinking stout which benefits by being in cask form."
"on cask at the Gingerman NYC. pours black with a dark tan head, good retention andcreamy lace. Nose, roasted malt and and abit of yeast. Medium bodied, roasted malt, licorish, coffee flavors. Light to medium bodied, some what of an oily note in the mouthfeel. Decent stout, was not overwhelmed by this one in general."
"There were too many selections at Mugs to have another of this particular brew, otherwise I would have been happy to stay with Blue Point for the evening."
"I'd like to try this one in the bottle for another interpretation."
"Overall a decent oatmeal stout, but there are better ones out there. Also seemed on the expensive side for a growler ($7.29 at a local beverage store) considering I live only 15 minutes away from the brewery."
"A very dark/black color with a nice tan head that dissapears by the time you have imbibed half the glass. A very appealing smell, sort of a sweet aroma- very fresh to say the least. As for the taste, this is a rich, sweet oatmeal stout, with nice mellowness to it. It's maltiness hit hard in the beginning, but my palate became used to it, so I did not perceive this beer as too sweet. I also do not think this beer is as heavy as other oatmeal stouts, which is a nice balance. I felt I could have had more of them, which is always a good sign"
"pours a deep, deep brown. nearly black. topped with a decent, lasting head. smells heavily of roasted coffee, which is immediately apparent in the taste as well, along with a bit of oatmeal and sloght chocolate sweetness. very bold and hearty, but rather smooth at the same time. not what i expected, but quite enjoyable nonetheless. i'm happy that for the time that i'm stuck on the island, there's at least one local brewery producing decent beers. i thought i'd be hard pressed to find one."
"Pours a light brown, thick, choppy head. It sort of looks like seafoam, but in a nice sort of way. Head remains and coats the glass down as the beer empties. Smells a little sweet, somewhat fruity. tastes light, with subtle flavors, making it very drinkable"
"In all, a highly drinkable beer since it is very smooth and subtle about its oatmeal stoutness. Ain't close to, say, Sam Smith Oatmeal by any standard, but an easy beer to throw back."
