At base, it is a stout, so if you do not think that there was a pseudo-cascade going on, you are deluding yourself. It settled into a dense finger of deep-tan head that acted as a cap above the beer. Nose was very fruity, very blueberry, and while I do not enjoy them quite as much as when I was a kid, blueberry pie remains my favorite. Ah, sweet blueberries ... Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Mouthfeel was full, kind of creamy, dense with carbonation. The flavor was more blueberry than stout, so depending on your preference, it may or may not work for you. At this hour, it was working for me since I am positive that I would not have wanted a regular stout just now. The blueberry flavor was very evocative of summer and my youth and nostalgic drinking is one of my favorite things to do. Finish was semi-dry, since blueberries do not tend to be downright sweet anyway and when coupled with a non-sweet stout, they negated it being sweet. Very nice.","woodychandler","Jul 02, 2014"

I was surprised that the blueberry flavor wasn't sickly sweet, and was well-balanced and didn't have a fake flavor to it. The sweetness from the fruit is balanced out with the toast of the stout. I enjoyed the six pack, and went back to buy more. I found it greatly refreshing on a warm day, and it went very well with burgers. My local didn't have any more, so I ordered it. I was told it was a winter seasonal and that I'd have to wait a few months to get more. I happened to buy the last one leftover from the last batch. When I can find it, it's a mainstay in my fridge.","Jeff_Newell","Feb 07, 2014"

These bottles probably went through a second fermentation because the bottle cap had a lot of force behind it and even with a slow pour there was 5 times more head than beer. The aroma is still sweet with malts and blueberries. There are some robust flavors mixed with sweet blueberries but this is way too yeasty and it almost has more of a Belgian texture.

You have to be into this sort of thing, and I guess you can count me out of that particular fetish group. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a fluid feel, and a dry finish. Overall, this stuff just didn't do it for me. Though things were placid enough in the smell, the flavors clash painfully, and it's unsure whether or not they would have tasted better apart from each other anyway.

Smell is of dark roasted malt, alcohol, and an artificial blueberry aroma. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick and a fake blueberry flavor that is slightly medicinal. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that is drinkable but the blueberry presence is not very well done.","UCLABrewN84","Dec 13, 2012"

I imagined something like oatmeal for breakfast with some bitter chocolate and blueberries mixed in....that's not quit what you get with this beer, but the scents are present...they just don't come together perfectly. The liquid itself is a deep, black-ish brown color with a lasting light-tan head. Ever present carbonation keeps the head replenished and adds some distracting bite to the mouthfeel. Drier than expected, and there's also a solid hop bitterness. This is a better than average stout, and the blueberry isn't as overpowering as the smell forecasted, but its not exceptional by any means.","Suds","Sep 15, 2012"

It's pretty full bodied and pretty smooth with a chewy finish that leaves the tongue a little chalky. The flavor is a little disjointed. It starts with a dark, roasted flavor that's bound to a faceless (but well present) bitterness. That's followed by a sweet artificial blueberry flavor that reminds me of the Dum-Dum that I swiped off someone's desk in the office last week. There's a little touch of something poison in there.

The blueberry dominates the scent, and combines with bready, malty sweetness to create a very blueberry-muffin-like aroma. Mouthfeel is very silky and smooth; drinks nice and easy (particularly for a 7.5% ABV) with less blueberry in the flavor than I'd have anticipated based on the smell. Taste in general is malty and pleasant, a little grainy/bready; there is some mild carbonation spikiness and a wet, creamy mouthfeel on the front end, which overlaps into a contrastingly clean, smooth, almost dry middle; then, the subtle tart blueberry notes become a little more noticeable, along with some mellow but distinct herbal hop bite in the finish. Slight blueberry notes hang nicely in the aftertaste. While doing nothing really wrong, it's somehow not quite mind-blowing; but this is certainly a neatly balanced, very drinkable stout, that doesn't let the sweetness of its theme overpower. In fact, it is much better than I expected it to be, and a stout I would happily drink again. Give it a shot if you see it.","bfflo","Dec 11, 2010"

Not thick like many other double stouts, but not a watery feel. Tastes of blueberries upfront, very slight hop background, and finish is roasted malts. There's a dryness associated with this brew.
