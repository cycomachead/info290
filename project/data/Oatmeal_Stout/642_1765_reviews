"Solid dark brown color with faint ruby at the edges and a smallish khaki head the slowly dissipates. Chocolate and caramel maltiness with a hint of roast. Creamy silky mouthfeel. Nice beer, could maybe use a hint more roastiness though."

"This one is worth seeking out. Exceptionally good."

"Overall - This is a pretty good beer! Condor recommended and approved. For the price it is hard to beat, especially from such a small brewery. Give this a try, you wont be disappointed."

"Pours black in color and you can't see through it. A small beige head is seen that settles down to a thin layer on top and sides. Ringed lacing is seen when sipped that slides back down the inside of the glass. The aroma is of roasted malts with a hint of molasses. The taste has lots of roasted malt flavor with some spice and coffee. A very slight bitter finish that doesn't last long. Perfect carbonation for this type of brew. Overall a very tasty stout!"

"Light black in color and just a touch of light will get through. A solid half inch of light beige colored foam rests on top. Brussels lacing. I smell judiciously used oats and dark malt. The first sip reveals a quick rush of oats that is quickly overpowered by dark roasted malt which leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste. The mouth is creamy and slightly chalky. Straightforward and simple."

"O - a bit dissapointing, not as strong flavor and mouthfeel as I'd like from an outmeat stout.. Would drink another, but not something I'll seek out."

"Overall: There are really some nice flavors here; however, the lightness of the body keeps this beer from being as good as it could be."
"Appearance: pours a deep molasses color. Hardly any head and no lacing. A thin ring of bubbles around the edge. smell: Sweet caramel and toffee aroma, like a milk stout. Taste: Bitter-sweet chocolate, mild expresso, lightly toasted bread. Mouthfeel: medium to light bodied for a stout. Again, very similar to a milk stout or a porter. Overall; Very enjoyable and well worth a try especially if you're a porter lover."

"A good, pleasant stout and would prefer to try it on tap"

"overall, a damn fine stout! looks, feels, smells and tastes great, what more could you want? granted, it's not a special one off or anything like that, but as far as brewery staple beers go - this is fantastic."

"O: As someone that is not well versed with stouts I found this to be very drinkable."

"O: Not a bad oatmeal stout. A bit too heavy on the oatmeal and light on the roasted malt detracts but not horribly so."
""
""
"Overall- Decent enough but not my favorite stout."

"Another beer picked up in Hays, KS. 12oz brown bottle. THe notch for freshness appears to be April 2012 though it's extremely faint and I am not sure this isn't just a scrape. In any event, to the pint glass! The beer pours a dark blackish color with deep brown edges in the light. Small 1 finger tannish/light brown head. Some retention and lacing but not much. The aroma is roasty sweetness with a hint of hop character and a noticeably biscuity malt tone. The beer tastes rich with roasted barley, mild bitterness, a subdued malty sweetness. Feels silky. Lighter end of medium bodied. Overall, not a bad oatmeal stout though not mind blowing, pretty solid though. I could easily put this 6 pack down in an evening ;)"
"Overall:	It was alright with a hamburger at the Flying Saucer in KC."
""
"Overall - This is a very enjoyable beer. I do think if the flavors were kicked up a notch, this beer could be a ""knock it out of the park"" type beer."
""
"Taste is a little less sweet than it smells with a rich, roasty-caramel malt profile. Oats dont go as thick and creamy as some of the style, but it is barely full enough and is indeed pretty silky. Touch of fruitiness in there from the yeast and overall is pretty fun to drink. Id say this is a darn good oaty stout, but not in the top tier for the style. If it were available here, Id probably buy 2 or 3 sixers a yearâ€¦especially considering the lack of representatives in the category sold in TX."
"A slight acidity on the tongue is complemented by good carbonation through the entire beer."
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied with pretty low carbonation, reasonably smooth and a bit slick. Overall, not my favorite oatmeal stout by any stretch, but solid enough."
""
""
""

"Nice, easy drinking."

"Poured into a shaker pint glass. Pours a rich black with a hint of brown when held to the light. A dark creamy pillowy head sits on top, and doesn't dissipate very much, until the end. Lots of nice sticky lacing. Smells of roasted malts and some bitter chocolates. The beer tastes like a good hearty oatmeal stout should: lots of bitter chocolate, a whim of oats, and a slightly dry finish. The mouthfeel is spot-on for a stout. Overall, I'm proud of this beer from my home state. Free State does a great job representing the Oatmeal Stout."
"Pours a dark brown color. 2/3 inch head of an off-tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of oatmeal, slight dry hop, sweet malt, pale malt, hint of roasted malt, and a hint of alcohol. Fits the style of an Oatmeal Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of oatmeal, slight sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, hops, and slight pale malt. Overall, good appearance, aroma, and feel."

"Very dark coffee colored oatmeal stout that is a solid beer. A bit disappointed by the lack of a good thick head on top of the beer. Lacing is there though, from top to bottom. Tast is a little tart, and a little salty; not much smell apart from a hint of coffee with the maltiness. Some acidity; it just lacks a little bit of body and complexity for me, but not too bad overall. Quite drinkable, just not very memorable."
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson-brown with a 2 inch foamy khaki head that settles down to an island of foam on the top of the beer. A nice patterned lattice of lace forms on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, toasted oats, and some cocoa and coffee aromas. Taste is of roasted malt and toasted malt up front with a bitter chocolate and coffee grounds combination in the aftertaste. There is a medium amount of bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. There is a lower level of carbonation with a smooth and somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good oatmeal stout but nothing really all that special. I do need to thank James again for providing me with a Kansas tick though!"
"Drink- Pretty damn tasty. Much more so than I remember. A bit thicker than I remember which helps this one taste that much better."
"Its a decent oatmeal stout....but there are better ones out there."
"Pours a very dark brown in color with ruby red highlights. Smell is rich espresso and dark caramel. Taste is a soft smokiness up front, followed by a milk chocolate middle, finishing with a citrusy, earthy hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth. Overall a very good Oatmeal stout that I plan to get again."
"Overall: Average in every possible way. I wonder if it was an issue of using quality ingredients, because everything seemed really weak for the style. It does not demonstrate anything other than a very safe attempt. It does not stand out in any way really. Disappointed. If I were to see it on draft, I might give it a shot again. But won't be seeking it out."
"Mouthfeel is ok. Has a medium body. Not as smooth as I'd like or hope for. Better then your typical stout w/ a pretty decent dry finish. Drinkability clocks in around medium. I'd really like to see more oats in the taste and a little less hops. Just not quite as smooth as I'd like from an oatmeal stout. Worth picking up but not something I'd hunt down though. Prosit!"
"O: Great brew for temperamental Kansas whether"
"D - interesting oatmeal stot, one of the more hoppy examples I have tried. Pretty good and worth a try for sure."
"Overall, I'm glad I tried it, it fits a niche. I would definitely consider it again when I'm in the mood for a stout on a warm summer day."
"Medium body, the same with the carbonation, I like the smooth mouth feel and I find this Oatmeal Stout very easy to drink. A very nice brew!"
"Mouthfeel has a solid medium body. The oats gives a smooth texture, very easy to drink. This version is a lot lighter than some other oatmeal stouts I've had, which with this warm weather that's not a bad thing. I find that this is a good beer to have on hand while manning the grill."
"This a nice example of the style. I really need to get up to Lawrence & sample from the source!"
"O/D- Average at best."
"This beer pours a thick dark brown color with a little off white head that leaves some lacing as you drink. The aroma is strong with coffee notes. The taste starts with some malty sweetness and then moves to coffee with a slight caramel finish. The mouthfeel is overcarbed and burns slightly. Overall a decent oatmeal stout."
"I haven't had this in about two years, but this is much better than I remembered it being on tap. They could have refined it during those two years, but out of the bottle this is really a great representation of the style. Highly recommended!"
"(12oz bottle). Pours dark brown with khaki head. Aroma of cocoa, dark fruit and caramel. Also, a little roasty coffee notes. Taste is sweet with a little roasted bitterness. Thin to medium bodied with a creamy texture and slightly bitter finish. This is a nice stout and one that I would gladly have again."
"Pours a deep chunky dark brown/ black. Aroma is a typical oatmeal malty stout. Taste was much smoother that I anticipated, very very smooth. Taste was a roasted malt, very chocolaty. Smooth mouthfeel, cant get over how smooth it is, very tasty and very drinkable...thanks Rbald42!!"
"The beer is smooth and enjoyable. Easy drinking and could easily have a few of these without getting bored or to drunk."
"This is a very solid Oatmeal Stout and I'm really glad that I got to this one fresh, as that mildly aggressive hop profile really helped make this one for me. This stayed quite smooth and drinkable though as well. I enjoyed this."
"Overall this beer was better out of the tap than the bottle but at $11 for 3 pints and $8 for a six-pack the 6'er comes first. Not a huge difference comparing the two, but enough to notice for me. Great Beer Free State!!!"
"does not come thru on the taste or the body. Decent but not one I would search out for."
"Pour brings a body that is near black with a mocha head. Head dies quickly without leaving too much lace. Nose is roasted malt with a faint hint of dark chocolate. The taste is quite plain with just a bit of roasted character. The feel is pretty nice and creamy. Drinks well overall but is a bit bland."
"taste is the same, very nice, I have a hard time believing this is an oatmeal stout though. The finish is VERY dry. i think it may be the driest I have ever had... amazing. makes it better to be honest. very coffee and chocolate forward. Too thin for my taste, but for the style, awesome."
"Lightly roasted flavor in the aroma, combining with some dull coffee-ish notes. Nicely creamy, medium body with a nice light roast throughout lending just a touch of bitterness. Cocoa powder mid palate. Good malt profile, a solid oatmeal stout but nothing new or groundbreaking here."
"This is definitely a sold, above average Oatmeal Stout, with a well above average drinkability to go with it."
"Very smooth body maybe a touch too much carbonation. Very drinkable light oatmeal stout. I'm really glad these guys are finally bottling."
"Not a bad beer but I think I had certain expectations of it as an oatmeal stout (more creamy, less dry) that made me like it less. Maybe if it was just called a stout I might have rated it a bit higher."
"12 ounce bottle. Pouring the beer it looks reminiscent of cola, with a nicely building sudsy tan head. You have to pour this beer somewhat aggressively to get any kind of head out of it. You can really smell the oatmeal in the nose, with some chocolate and burnt molasses. The flavor to this beer is an explosion. The first taste is amazing, with lots of bittersweet chocolate, roasted oatmeal, and caramel sweetness coming through. There's some hints of coffee here, though they are muted. The hops profile also adds a light fruitiness to the whole affair. Light mouthfeel, not creamy or thick, but drinkable in it's own way. Honestly, for my money it's right up there with Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout as one of the best examples of the style you can find."
"Nice, light body for a light, session stout. The oats don't thicken the body here so much as they make for a silkier, healthier texture moving across the tongue. The relatively low ABV% helps to make this a nice choice to enjoy a couple of pints of."
"A very good, thick roasty mouthfeel. Was pretty drinkable because it wasn't too hoppy."
"Enjoyed at the brewery. Pours near black with a nice tan head. Nose is very oaty with some chocolate, roasted malts and light hops. Taste is well balanced and easy to drink. Again lots of cocoa, oats and dark malt. Clean body is well carbonated. Good stuff."
"D - This is a very good oatmeal stout. It has a great blend of sweet and bitter."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Tatse is good and alcohol is presumeably low making for a nice session."
"Fine dense black shade. The nose has plenty of coffee with a sweet liquor/scotch ale accent. Light in the front with some fruit and a nice roast at the back with some bitterness (grapefruit?) at the finish. Lighter mouth feel leaves a smoother stout drinking experience."
"D-Decent but this would be served better on nitro. A bit more body umph couldn't hurt either. Not bad but this place has better offerings."
"Both of the Free State Brewing Company beers that I drank with my lunch yesterday have potential. They're already good, but they need more ingredients (especially more malt) in order to be memorable. Although Oatmeal Stout wasn't quite good enough to warrant a growler purchase, I'll probably order it again if I ever make it back to Lawrence."
"Overall: This is a very easy oatmeal stout to drink. I like a lot of the Free State Brews."
"Draught @ Free State: This one pours a very dark, fairly opaque brown with a tan head. It did leave some lacing down the glass. The aroma was somewhat milder. There are hints of roasted malt and chocolate to the nose. The taste is very smooth, with some roastiness and chocolate. A nice stout."
"Recommended"
"This oatmeal stout pours smooth and possesses a small tan head which eventually reduces to a lacey web. The aroma is of roasted hops with a slight hint of chocolate. It hits the mouth with that same maltiness then transitions to an expresso / chocolate follow-through. This stout is easy to drink, and not as thick as some. It definately is not watery, however. This is a good stout, but not great."
"A nice dark brown with some light seeping through. A small head. Aromas of roasted malts most noticable. Nice palate of roasted malts, some coffee and a nice roundness from the oats. Mouthfeel is on the light side, but still very flavorful with a lingering finish. Overall, a very nice stout. Easy-drinking and pleasant. Well worth a try."
"Dark brown, almost black, reddish highlights, smallish brown head, soapy retention, good lace though. Faint nose, hint of sweet-malt... clean. Underlying hop bitterness mingles with the lightly roasted malt. No real complexity or development aside from a sparse hint of chocolate. Thin and lackluster, at best this is an average Oatmeal Stout. Far from great, nothing is offensive, but it is something IÂ’d not recommend."
"Deep clear brown hue. Thin, tight head leaves Belgian lace. Aroma of burnt malt, mild baker's chocolate and dark caramel malt. Clean and underwhelming aromawise. Roasted barley bitterness upfront, mild hop bitterness immediately ensues, leaving an apparent void in malt character. Subtle, dryish chocolate mid palate. Lightly bodied, but quaffable. No trace of silky oatmeal is perceptible in the thin mouthfeel. Finishes clean and dry, w/ fleeting hints of chocolate. Uninspired. The filtration and / or over fining has stripped this brew of body. Good drinkability, but akin to a brown ale in roasted character."
"Dark brown almost black color, decent lasting tan head. Sweet chocolate malty roasted burnt aroma, chocolate roasty sugary burnt bitter coffee flavors, yet has a pretty smooth and creamy mouthfeel, medium body has a nice burnt bitterness in the finish."
"A deep black color sits below a nice creamy tan head.  The aroma is lightly of dark malt.  Initially a mellow sour fruity flavor presents itself followed by a quick sweet malt and a lingering bitterness.  Great body and complex, I enjoyed this brew."
"The roasted oats dominate its taste and it has a wonderfully smooth, silky texture.  Just as Guiness has a worldwide following, many Lawrence, Kansas residents consider this beer to be a nectar of the gods.  This beer grows on you.  Free State Brewery is a hidden treasure in the Midwest."
