"Daaark reddish color. Not real strong on the smell.  Or flavor... Feels a bit too watery for a stout.  Just seems like a slightly darker Moose Drool."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 12/10/2014. Pours crystal clear very dark brown color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of milk chocolate, caramel, cocoa, toasted oats, light coffee, brown bread, herbal, floral, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted/bready malt and moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of milk chocolate, caramel, cocoa, toasted oats, light coffee, brown bread, herbal, floral, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Light herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, caramel, cocoa, toasted oats, light coffee, brown bread, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and complexity of dark/roasted/bready malt and moderate earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice oatmeal stout style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted/bready malt and moderate earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and easy to drink. Not as bold as some other oatmeal stouts; but still very well rounded and nicely enjoyable in flavors."

"Slow Elk is a decent milk/oatmeal stout - worth a try."

"Overall – Not really one I cared for all too much, it was too sweet without enough roast and didn’t really have a great body for the style.  Ah… just OK."
""

"Slow Elk is a pleasant oatmeal stout which is smooth and not astringent. While it is not as flavorful as some others of the style (Anderson Valley's come to mind), it's a good sweeter alternative after drinking all those tongue buckling IPA's."

"It's a very good Oatmeal Stout."

"Maybe just a tad to sweet in the finish.  Though I should not take off to much for that cause many I have had in the style are fairly sweet.  A slightly fuller body would not be a bad thing either.  Again, not a detriment, overall very enjoyable and will put the six pack to good use."

"Decent enough stuff, I do believe I could drink a few of these."
""
"Trying the Slow Elk for the first time as a desert to a long Friday. The beer poured a black opaque with a thin ecru head that is leaving a spotty lace. The scent is has a nice espresso feel. The taste is a little watery coffee but it is decent. There is a nice sweet toffee after taste which makes one want to keep sipping away. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with smooth carbonation. Overall it's a smooth drinkable stout that is worth a taste."
""
"O- Not a bad beer. I like most of what the big sky brewery kicks out, and this is very unique. Oatmeal stouts usually put me to sleep with their heaviness, but this one keeps me awake and has me reaching for another. I'd hang out with this one once in a while. It's a session stout for me."
""

"O - I think this is a solid Oatmeal Stout that I'd enjoy drinking again. Great price, nothing wowing about it but a good representation of the style i think. Worth a try. Cheers!"
"o: A pleasantly surprising brew that offers straightforward flavors and body but done very well."
"Overall: The flavor is fantastic, chocolate and coffee notes blend fantastically with the malt and hops…the carbonation makes a cotton candy like fluff that is very flavorful…I recognize that it’s an imperial stout, but the alcohol is a bit too dominant…it could be toned down a bit and that would create a more balanced, flavorful beer…(3.75/5)"
""
""
""
"O: light body for an oatmeal, nose is pleasant but faint and would like more complexity, the acid-dry taste i guess is from the oatmeal, would like more intense roasted malt flavors. it was worth trying this brew, but next time i might skip it to try a different one."

"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer and I thought it was an average at best example of the style, the flavors were too thin and the body was too watery for the style, that's not what I'm looking for in a good Oatmeal Stout. This beer doesn't have the best drinkability, it went down smooth, but the flavors just couldn't hold my attention and the thin body was a turn off so one is more then enough for me. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma and appearance, they weren't great, but they weren't bad and either and compared to the other aspects of this beer those were the highlights. What I liked the least about this beer was how muted the roasted malt flavors were and how thin and watery the mouthfeel was, they were a pretty big disappointment. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's priced good, but the quality isn't up to my standards for the style and there's many more Oatmeal Stouts that I would much rather be drinking, I wouldn't recommend this beer to anyone, it's just not worth it. All in all I was let down with this beer, it just didn't deliver what a good Oatmeal Stout should and it left me wanting much more, better luck next time guys, this one turned out to be a miss."

"A very mild mannered stout. Easy drinking but sort of boring."

"Overall- Drinkable but I have tried better examples of this style."
""
""
""
"O:  A decent OS that has a nice balance of flavors. I would have liked the sweet nose to transfer more into the taste. The stale smoke flavor almost overpowered the other flavors.  Slow Elk missed the mark for me, but wasn't way off.  A decent attempt but not close to a top lister by any means. I can say its better than many I have had though. "

"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, toasted oats, and some cocoa aromas. Taste is much the same with an acidic flavor on the finish. There is a medium amount of burnt and roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and thin bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that has an unexciting flavor and mouthfeel."
""
""
"M - Light to medium body. Moderate carbonaiton. Too carbonated for the style for my liking."
""
"Overall- Nothing spectacular about this stout but it is very well balanced as far as malt and hops. Could definitely be more there in flavor and mouthfeel though."
""
"this definitely isnt rated high enough on here. its a rich creamy smooth stout with a great oat flavor. it pours midnight black and thick as hersheys syrup. theres an aggressive three inch foamy mocha head that leaves pretty lacing on the sides of the glass. it smells like milk chocolate and oatmeal with brown sugar. the beer isnt sweet, but it is creamy. seems like flavor elements of a milk stout as well as an outmeal stout, with the roasty malts and chocolate notes dominating. the feel is excellent too, velvety smooth and coats the mouth and throat with a layer of goodness. mellow carbonation gives it a nice rich feel. one of the better big sky beers ive had, and this shold get much more appreciation on here. would make an lovely beer float with some hard vanilla bean ice cream."

"Overall - Sweet mother does this not hit the spot. It's like someone took a good oatmeal stout and cut it with half water. What were they thinking? I got excited by the smell, then was completely let down after the first sip. I'll never buy this again."
""
""
""
"O: A enjoyable stout that goes down easy. Nice offering from the Brewer."
""
""
""
""

"Pours a black color. One inch head of a tan color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of slight roasted malt, sweet malt, hint of oatmeal, and a hint of citrus hops. Fits the style of an Oatmeal Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, oatmeal, slight roasted malt, slight hops, and a hint of pale malt. Overall, decent appearance, aroma, body, and blend. No one aspect of the beer is 'great', but still an easy-drinking beer."

"O - Nothing too interesting here. Too watery, which reduces the enjoyment quite a bit."
""
""
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium thick and the finish is medium. This is a very roasty toasty brew good flavors. The only complaint I see is there needs to be more oatmeal. Most Oatmeal beer that I drink are a bit more complex, tad creamy and smoother. Good beer nonetheless."
"O-very good oatmeal stout that is well balnced"
""
"12 ounce bottle, best by 01/12/12 printed on the bottle. ""Big Hole Cologne"" printed inside the cap. Pours crystal clear dark brown color with a nice and fairly dense 1-2 fingers of light tan head with great retention that reduces to a lacing cap that lasts. Some fairly thick lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, oatmeal, and bitter coffee. Some surprisingly nice aromas with good strength. Taste of light chocolate, oats, caramel, light coffee, and roasted malt. Finish is fairly dry, but there is some light bitterness with lingering notes of roasted malt, caramel, light chocolate and coffee. Alcohol is completely hidden as expected for a beer of 5.4%. Medium body and carbonation, with a decently creamy mouthfeel. Very smooth and easily drinkable. Nice balance of flavors. Overall a nice oatmeal stout I thoroughly enjoyed."
"An average oatmeal stout. Smells good, tastes okay, feels inadequate."
"Wanted to delay the mead a bit, so I went in for a nice oatmeal stout. It pours a very dark black-brown topped by about a finger or so of dark tan foam. The nose comprises roasted barley (as though 'twere fresh from a grain bag), light cocoa powder, and very light coffee. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a small bit of char in the background. Things still taste kinda husky grain-wise, rather than the roasted malted barley that would normally be found in these types o' brews. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish. Overall, a kinda weak stout, one that just doesn't do it for me."
""
""
"Poured this Oatmeal stout from a 12 oz brown bottle into a pint glass. This stout produced a tan head only average retention. It poured a dark brown color, left behind a small amount of lacing. The aroma consisted of roasted malt, coffee and hops. Medium body, smooth easy to drink. Tastes of roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate. Not a great example of the style...just not much to brag about with this one. So far my least favorite offering from Big Sky."
"That said...this is a party porter...anybody can drink this...and beer snobs will approve...I think that is what Big Sky had in mind...seasonal beers often end up at parties and especially XMAS parties! FTW"
"Good oat stout. Always one of my favorite styles and this is a great example. Yet another solid brew from Big Sky."
""
""
"Overall- This is a nice little beer! And by far the best I have had from Big Sky. The malts and roast on the tongue are solid, if a little formulaic, but that is not always a bad thing. And this beer has a glorious feel that makes it more than a pleasure to drink."
"Taste is pretty darn good, it does feel a little light for a stout, but flavor-wise they have done no ill. I taste coffee, then chocolate which settles into an oatmealy aftertaste. The aftertaste is very pleasant... almost like after downing a whole sheet of mother's fresh cookies and then lapsing into a comforting coma. I am not a regular oatmeal stout drinker, but I'd be into trying more of them after this pleasant experience."
"Drinkability: It is a good effort, and I think it is on the path toward high quality, but I expected more since it is a limited release."
"Overall, really disappointed as I love all other Big Sky brews. This may be their weakest effort, and it's my favorite style. Just too thin."
"Overall - It's your typical run-of-the-mill stout that plays it safe and sticks to what makes an oatmeal stout drinkable, and that's okay. I would've liked to have a bit more flavor, but in the end it's a drinkable stout that manages to be decent and at least appeasing ."
"Overall: A damn good beer. Great coffee flavor and a very coating, creamy mouthfeel to boot! I loved it."
"Final Notes: This is another one of those ""not a bad beer, just a little lacking"" beers. The smell and taste it has are good, but I just wish there was more substance to it. It happens."
"12 oz bottle poured into Sam Adams glass. Pours a nice two finger head - lacing and bubble action is impressive. Root beer opacity. Aroma is roasted malt and coffee. A little light and thin for the style but very smooth - I'm not getting that bite that you come to expect. Still a decent offering, just not the best."
"Big whiff of Cain's diner coffee from the outset, leading into a caramel and toffee heavy body. Light milk chocolate and more weak coffee with a dash of creamer. A nice burst of earth and meadow comes from the Goldings, while it finishes with a subtle balance of fruit from the English yeast. This is a solid English-style Porter, too bad it bears no resemblance to any sort of Oatmeal Stout. Where's the creaminess? Another bag or two of roasted malts and a higher mash temp would go a long way. Not bad beer in the least, but it misses the style mark completely. I'm just relieved I'm not relying on this to get me through a long Montana winter's night."
"I liked this one, I think this big sky brewery is a good one. One of the lighter oatmeal stouts, but when I want oatmeal, I want a lighter stout experience, so this one delivered to my expectations."
"This is a decent tasting oatmeal stout, but nothing to write home about. It is easy drinking and well balanced, but for me this style is all about mouthfeel and in that aspect this does not really deliver."
"Drinks easy enough, but was hoping for so much more from Big Sky. Glad I didn't by a sixer of this"
"The only thing about this beer that really blows my mind is how much it reminds me of the results of an extract homebrew recipe. After brewing it in 2009, my partner in crime (Goblinmunkey7 here on BA) and I agreed that it was too thin, and decided to describe it as a dark ale. However, after sitting for a few months, it became great. I wonder if this gets better over time, too."
"Notes: Average Oatmeal Stout. It wasn't great and there was a subtle astringency that I wasn't a huge fan of. Flavors aren't horrible but they just didn't quite mesh entirely."
"I would call this a good run of the mill oatmeal stout. It doesn't wow or really stand out, but it is enjoyable and well done. I will certainly have no problem finishing this off in short time."
"O: It is an ok beer, not upset I drank it, but would not go out of my way to purchase again."
"Overall...I would give this to a breastfeeding mother on any occasion."
"O: Meh, not at all impressive for the style."
"O: A nice oatmeal stout, easy-going and smooth. Tried it at a tasting last week and happy to have a sixer and a real review. Will look forward to it returning next year."
"O- Overall it was a decent beer, a little watered down but some fantastic smell."
"Overall: this is a pretty unremarkable beer. It's not bad, but I won't go out of my way to get this again."
"O: Under-impressed. Big Sky usually makes a good push with their brews. Slow Elk is on the weaker side of things. I guess it's a good thing that it's a limited release..."
"O - This is a nice oatmeal stout. The label itself is worth picking one up."
"O: A good oatmeal stout, light on the body but not on flavors."
"starts off kind of light, but hits its stride with notes of sugar, molasses, chocolate and a touch of coffee that carry over well in the flavor. smooth with loads of chocolate and a nice and mellow balance between the rich chocolate and roasted malts. easily drinkable and a nice and solid beer."
"O-A decent beer that I got as an extra in a trade."
"Beer poured a dark brown with an OK tan head. Nose has hints of chocolate and roasted malts. Taste is slight roasted chocolate malts, finishes with a small slightly dry hop. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth but is thin for the style. Drinkability is pretty good, this is a sessionable beer with decent flavor but no overly exciting qualities. Glad to have tried and will have to find a fresh version for next time."
"A very quaffable oatmeal stout and for me that is the problem. I like to sip my oatmeal stouts and to me this is right between and American stout and a traditional outmeal stout. Some more hops would have been good to make it American and more body for an Oatmeal, but hey, not terrible. I just wouldn't guess is was an oatmeal stout in a blind test. But who am I, right?"
"Sessionable, but not particularly impressive flavor-wise. Not Big Sky's shining moment I imagine."
"Overall, it's enjoyable, but in such a solid category and considering other great offerings from Big Sky, I'd probably get something else first."
"Drinkability: Fairly tasty and easy to drink oatmeal stout. Taste is a little bit off for my liking, but would recommend to those macro-drinking friends looking to try something different."
"An easy-drinking oatmeal stout. I've had porters that were more robust. Oatmeal porter? Maybe, even then thin. Inoffensive. A light oatmeal stout, and not bad for that."
"Without categorizing it, it's a solid B+. Simple, but good. However, taking style into account, it suffers."
"Conclusion: Good beer, awesome packaging, just not really right for the style. Slap ""Nut Brown"" on the label and I'd even pay the 8.49 to pick it up again."
"Very easy to drink. Wish I had bought a 6 of these instead of a single bottle."
"D: It's drinkable and because it's light, you can have a couple but there is something funky (just slightly) that makes you not want to go crazy with it; this really doesn't feel like an oatmeal stout and the more I have of it the worse it tastes"
"Drinkability? This is not a very good example of an Oatmeal Stout at all so it isn't all that drinkable for me. I think the recipe for this needs some serious work."
"D-- Lighter ABV and drinkable but needs more of the oatmeal taste. A little too much of the malts."
"D-Fairly drinkable. A standard brew, displaying the characteristics of the style. Quality, above average."
"Very drinkable."
"This was an easy drinking, simple oatmeal stout to me. If the aroma was beefed up a bit this would be a top notch oatmeal stout, and it's still quite nice as it stands."
"Pours a very nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy tan head, nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, very nice toffee/chocolate notes. The taste is malty, slightly sweet, very nice toffee/chocolate notes. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty brew, wish we would get it here in Utah."
"It took some work, but I finally got the seal off the bottom of the cap so I could read what was printed there. And the answer is... 'Nuttier than a Squirrel Turd'."
"Pours very dark, almost completely black with one finger of tan head that quickly settled to a thin cap. Just a little lacing is left on the glass. I smell coffee, mocha, and something reminiscent popcorn. Nice dark malt flavor of chocolate and coffee. Some graininess and a burnt taste is noted on the finish. Not the biggest body for a stout but still maintains a nice texture. A nice approachable dark beer for people that do not want to jump in the deep end of the pool. Drinking a few of these in an evening would be possible."
"Very good drinkability as this brew chose the approachable versus the challenging path. A tasty enough example of the style, and something that would be easy enough to knock back all night long, and at 5.4%abv this would certainly be considered a sessionable brew here in NA. Worth a try for fans of the style, and may be a good choice for those interested in tackling the darker, more roasted styles."
"D_A decent brew that might veer more towards the porter side of the world. As an OS it is lacking but is a decent brew otherwise."
"Poured a deep garnet color, the head modest in size, frothy in texture and the residual lace fine sheets. Smell is lightly toasted grain aroma with sweet candy like tones and is quite pleasant with the start sweet and the top middling. Pretty good brew in my opinion."
"Pours a deep, deep ruby with mocha brown head. Had a six pack and I think everyone had different head. Some had a nice thick one, others it was very thin and non-existant. Smell was enjoyable. Its was a nice mix of chocolate syrup with some dark caramel and a bit of cream to it. Taste was ok but a little bland. This, as with many stouts, is meant to be enjoyed at a warmer temperature. At first the taste is very bland however, as it hits the back of the tounge you notice some milk chocolate and a touch of bitterness with some bakers chocolate. Mouthfeel was far to light and watery for me. I think if this beer had a fuller body I'd be a good B+ brew. Overall good and pretty easy to put a few away in a sitting."
"Clear garnet body. Thin and bubbly light brown crown. Lacing is plenty sufficient. Decent aroma of oats, cocoa, milk sugar and smoke. Lactose and milk chocolate are the presiding characteristics on the palate. This definitely has some Milk Stout qualities to it. The oatmeal is noticeable however, in the taste and in the mouthfeel, which is smooth and velvety. Roasted malts add a little depth, but the charm with this beer is in its simplicity. Good beer."
"Drinkability: Pass. Errs on the side of drinkable, but ultimately, it's a bit thin, and leaves you (or me at least) looking and wanting for more richness, more creaminess."
"Is this an oatmeal stout lite?"
"d: Compared to other Oatmeal stouts this is below average, but that's not to say this isn't a nice, enjoyable beer."
"Overall impression: Drinkable, a bit lighter than most oatmeal stouts, Doesn't have the slick mouthfeel I expect from an oatmeal stout."
"Edit: I am totally perplexed by the animal on the logo. It's a cow with elk antlers. Perhaps after a few beers you actually understand it. I may never know."
"Drinkability is ok. A pretty tasty stout that could use a little work with the mouthfeel. I still won't be upset drinking a couple of these."
"From a 12oz bottle - Pours a dark clear root beer color with small quickly dissipating head. Below average carbonation. Smells of roasted malts and some oats First sip is smooth with roasted malts leading the way. There is a fairly weak malt backbone. Very nice and drinkable. Excellent bitter finish."
"Overall, a solid and tasty stout. A little much on the sweet side for me."
"Go ahead and skip this. If there is oats in here, they sure skimped on them. Volume appears to be the priority."
"D - Not hard to drink. The beer is not weighty by its carbonation or its thickness. The ABV I'm sure is higher than normal, but so far has not affected me."
"EDIT: I was reading the other reviews and realized that my rating was a lot higher than average, and also that I'm the only one that's reviewed it this year. The bottle does say ""Limited Release"" on it, so either my taste buds are pretty different from average, or this beer has improved. I say if you've had this in the past, try it again. And if you haven't had it before, don't let the average C+ rating scare you off. It's a pretty good stout."
"Drinkability  This went down very well, so Im giving the highest rating of the beer in this category. I could drink this all day, really, as a session ale, but its just not what I expect when I buy an Oatmeal Stout."
"A very accessible and tame brew for the stout novice, but lacking the creamy mouthfeel and residual sugars of a typical oatmeal stout."
"Black color, large head. Roasted malt, chocolaty aroma. Roasted malts, chocolate flavor. Full flavor, smooth taste. Chocolaty flavor. Fully rounded Mouthfeel. Excellent taste, slight bitterness. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet, chocolate."
"I kept waiting for this beer to show me something more."
"A rough pour delivers a big-bubbled and frothy light-tan head that holds well over a very deep, almost black, mahogany-brown body that displays clear crimson highlights at the base of the glass when held to the light. Light cocoa, some milk chocolate, a touch of lightly roasted coffee, and some background floral hops appear in the nose. It's creamy and smooth across the palate with a delicate carbonation that accentuates its medium/light body. There's more coffee and a much darker chocolate present in the flavor than the nose suggests, and some light fruit also comes into play. It remains sweetish with an underlying bitterness, but some mild acidity from the dark malts helps to round things out. It finishes with a gently lingering note of mocha and a dull, mild bitterness. It's not overly impressive flavorwise, but it is well-balanced and drinkable."
"Overall a good beer thats worth trying at least once."
"This beer started off good but limped home in the end..a bit of work and this could be a good brew."
"Notes: One breweries stout could be another breweries brown ale  the lightest oatmeal stout I have ever run into. A good drinking ale but there is nothing special that it brings to the table."
"Lacking is the roasty flavor on the palate. that I utterly insist on in an oatmeal stout. Not much bite, and far too light in body. A decent and drinkable stout, but on the bottom rung, as oatmeals go."
"Rich black color with some dark ruby highlights with a tannish small bubbly head that fizzes away quick. Smells of oats, roasted malt with some chocolate and burnt cookie caramel notes. The taste was a little on the light side for a stout that looked so dark, but is pretty good non the less. Lots of solid oats, slight caramel, roasted malts and some slightly burnt chocolate tones. Has a nice smooth feel with a sweet tang, caused by the chocolate and from a very small hop presence. This stuff ain't bad, I actually liked it alot and would drink it any old time. I love the label, the cow with the elk antlers, kinda funny. Reminds me alot of Anderson Valley labels, bears with antlers. Hmmm....I wonder."
"Deep dark brown in hue, black in the middle with a hint of red highlights when held to a light, a tan head of a babys finger in height quickly dissipated to a bubbly collar. There was no subsequent lacing of note. Minimal potency in the nose, sweet oatmeal is the most prominent. Flavorful palate but the sweet oatmeal doesnt mix so well with the roasted malt and the insignificant chocolate notes. The bitterness doesnt complement the sweetness; frankly they clash. Seemed a little off; the thin and watery mouthfeel only compounds the problem. Awful clean on all accounts; lousy finish. The more your drink Slow Elk the less impressed you become, not worth trying, below average."
"slow elk, eh? this is one ""slow stout""! it pours out a black-ruby hue...really fizzy head that died quickly. no lace. slight burnt malt aroma..some cocoa notes. tastes mostly of some chocolate malts and oatmeal overtones....this beer seemed so dead that i busted out the valentines chocolates to help things out. too smooth and ""dead"" mouthfeel. a really disappointing end to this brew. weak and seemingly watery. munching hershey kisses while drinking this brew didn't seem to help. a bad example of any stout. not recommended."
"Deep brown color with ruby highlights. The head is light brown, and leaves a bit of lacing. The roast malt aroma is surprisingly light. Also in the aroma is a malt sweetness, and a toasted graininess. The flavor again is light in the roast malt department, but it has a sweet chocolatey flavor. The bitterness is evident, but subdued. The texture is somewhat smooth and creamy, but it does have a carbonic tinge to it. Overall, not bad, but lacking the roast malt aromas and flavors I would expect."
"The beer pours a deep garnet color, the head modest in size, frothy in texture and the residual lace fine sheets. Nose has a lightly toasted grain aroma with sweet candy like tones and is quite pleasant with the start sweet and the top middling. Finish is pertinently hopped and the carbonation moderate the aftertaste chocolate dry, drinkable but not a great beer, just average I guess or better yet Beginners Stout best, describes it."
"This oatmeal stout is a clean quality brew from Big Sky.  The body is not too heavy, like most oatmeal stouts I have tried, but that does not affect the smooth mouth-feel this beer possesses.  Just a bit of roasted flavor finish off a nice tasting donation to the craft."
"A dark stout with a brief head - low carbonation. Good oatmeal flavor with some malty overtones giving a slight sweet taste.  The ABV is 4.9%."
"Not quite black with reddish hues poking through.  Thin tan head that disappears and leaves no trace of its existence.  Mild chocolate/coffee aromas with pleasant hints of fruity esters.  Flavors are subdued for an oatmeal stout, and there's minimal ""oaty"" existence, no viscosity.  I thought it would improve as it warmed but it didn't.  The fruit flavors seem out of place.  With so many top notch competitors in its class, it didn't impress."
"Deep ruby hue & very clear when held to light.  Well retained beige head.  Chocolate malt, nondescript caramel malt sweetness along w/ slightly tart esters.  Not particularly eniticing aromawise. Thin in body & and the watery mouthfeel lacks the viscous, proteinaceous quality that a good oatmeal stout should have.  The contribution from the oats is imperceptible.  Nothing outsatnding in this brew.  The slightly bitter, generic roasted grain notes along with a bit of caramel malt comprise the malt profile.  Slow Elk is quite bland all around for style and is a weak and ummemorable oatmeal stout.  No outright flaws here, however."
"Dark brown with a decent amount of medium brown head.  Chocolate and coffee flavors are present but subdued.  Burnt character is there but hard to find.  Sweet, dry finish.  I think this may be a decent beer to introduce people to the style as it's flavor profile and is not overly strong, but it still has all the characteristics, albeit subdued."
"""Sweet"" stout is one thing but this brew never generated any flavor at any temperature, blandly sweet, less than average mouthfeel for the style...I was pretty bummed by Slow Elk..."
"-Little aroma...watery..little head...more of a brown ale..easy drinking..some sweetness on aftertaste..below average to average stout..give this one to people who are afraid of big bad dark stouts...doesn't taste very dark or much like a stout.  To be fair, this one followed the Bell's Oatmeal Stout in my tasting and didn't come close to measuring up in character or taste.."
