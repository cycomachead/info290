4.04,0.2,4.5,4.25,4,3.5,4,"Overall: This is a pretty good oatmeal stout, but it does have its flaws. I thought the nose was great, but the taste doesnt quite live up to it. Mostly a subtle chocolatey, hop bite. I also feel that the finish is a bit too bitter for this style. Its still solid and worth the $6 i paid for the bomber, but probably won't go for it again","Bone53","Mar 02, 2015"

3.76,-6.7,4.25,3.75,3.75,4,3.5,"On tap. Pours very dark with a thing,brown head. Aroma is of medium intensity. Roast and mild char. Not very sweet smelling. The flavor is a match to the beer's scent. Low in sweetness. Roast, bittering dark malt, and chocolate. Finished with another layer of hop/bitter. A Stout that leans away from sweetness according to my palate. Body is fairly full. Higher carbonation. Could stand for some more sweet balance.","VelvetExtract","Feb 10, 2015"

The nose is roast dominated with tones of earhty floral hops and a hint of chocolate and licorice. The flavor is very much the same with an initial surge of roasted malt up front with an underlying mild bitterness. The licorice flavor is more pronounced than in the nose. I would prefer to tone it down a bit, but it's not bad. Chocolate really evens the beer out. Creamy and smooth, lingering roast flavor. Well carbonated. Overall, good.

Roasted barley, oats, aniseed, and burnt tobacco. A creamy thin to medium mouthfeel, not much carbonation. I wouldn't have minded it being a touch thicker but I still enjoyed it. Wouldn't have minded if they toned down the aniseed just a touch and can't say the bitter finish was executed well as it has been done in some other oatmeal stouts.

The taste is mostly chocolate-focused with some roasted malt in there as well. A bit of booze coming through in the end, and this takes over a bit in the feel, which consists of a somewhat-low carbonated brew with a pretty big body.

There's the graininess that you get when roasted malts are used in abundance and the alcohol is very well-masked. That's partially because this does not have as high an ABV as most Imp Stouts...it sits at the bottom of the style for that. So you can drink even more of it right? Sure, give it a go.

I believe there may be periods where this goes down too easy but as an oatmeal stout it drinks well and an imperial pint was more than appealing for this type of beer.

The aroma is jumping between a good chocolate milk shake with a dash of espresso and one of those cheap Italian espresso soda things. So, it's a mixed bag but ultimately good. The flavor is also fairly sweet, but it has some bite. There's more to it than I was expecting. The roasted malt flavor is rich and full, a beer that tastes bigger than its size.

Smooth and creamy yet bitter and chewy too. Hides the alcohol well. A good Imperial Stout with nice roastiness, chocolate sweetness, and bitterness of coffee and hops.

Chocolate notes were evident, as well as very light hopping. Very smooth texture, fine bubbles, well-integrated carbonation. Sweet up front, but grassy and light citrus hop flavours melded immediately with caramel, roast and toffee. Bitterness grew into the finish, becoming quite prominent. Just a bit of chocolate appeared mid-palate. The body was just a bit more than medium, a little light for the style yet this made for a more drinkable beer.

As the beer warms up and breathes a bit, it does smooth out some; it becomes more creamy, with the chocolate & smooth coffee notes becoming more pronounced. A rich, dark, spiciness also becomes noticeable; sort of reminiscent of the type of spices used in a black, holiday-type, spice cake (notes of vanilla, perhaps a hint of clove, and a wisp of nutmeg).

The taste was comparable....milk chocolate malts, coffee, fresh rolled oats, and a finish of dark chocolate. The mouth feel was velvety and rich, probably due to the rich oily texture that the oats tend to lend to the body of a beer.

Taste is again a lot of chocolate, some bitterness, alcohol and weak cherry presence. Not particularly complex, but its nice. fairly thick. For the price ($3.99), i'd buy another bomber.","aforbes10","Dec 28, 2006"
4.1,1.7,4,4,4,3,5,"D - As far as drinkability goes, this is amazingly easy to drink for a 7.4% Double Stout. Easier to drink than a lot of session beers to be perfectly honest, and a nice price point that makes it very accessible.","dgfair","Dec 20, 2006"

3.97,-1.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Thanks Andrew! Pours black, with a frothy mocha head, providing good retention and lace. Aromas are big dark fruit(plum, prune), lots of dark chocolate, raisin, and a surprising amount of hops. FLavour is very hoppy and choclatey, bitter coffee, and tonnes of fruit. Assertive bitterness finishes with a touch of chalk and pleasant astringency. Shit yes bitch, this is good!","mrmanning","Dec 14, 2006"

4.57,13.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"22 oz bomber. This brew pours a sinister black color, with only light penetrating at the edges when I tile the glass. There was a 2 finger dark tan head over top when I poured it and it fell to a full coat over top. There is just a light carbonation bubbling up in the brew. Nice looking beer. The aroma is very nice. It starts with a big piney hop, backed with chocolate and deep roasted maltyness. It comes together to give hints of coffee as well. All the aromas are big, but in balance with each other. Flavor is excellent. The hop that smacked me in the nose is much more subdued. The flavor is rich in chocolate, moving to a mild pine and roast character that blends in with the sweetness of the chocolate to finish with a mild coffee and a nice moderate bitterness. I think the flavor on this one is excellent, as nothing is out of line or overly strong. It all meshes well. The mouthfeel is moderate with a very light carbonation that makes it fell nice and full. Overall, this one is a very nice beer. Both the flavor and aroma deliver. As it warms, the body really bulks up to a solid full feel, giving me what I had been looking for. For $4 a bomber, this is an excellent value as far as stouts go. Very nice.","kmpitz2","Oct 25, 2006"

Nose is an invigorating smokey malt that just jumps out of the glass, very meaty. There is a lot going on in the nose of this one. Rich robust coffee chocolatey feel attacks the taste buds at first sip. Eases up in the middle and thins up on the bitter that leads to the finish. Finish is slightly sweet with richness and a bitter bite on the end. Not to heavy on the mouthfeel. Very relaxed and nicely drinkable.","SPLITGRIN","Sep 23, 2006"

The thick black liquid poured a nice thick tan head and very dark, black, not Stone Imp. Russian Stout black, but black nonetheless. Carbonation bubbles clung to inside of the glass and it was overall a very attractive beer. Smells of fruits, nuts and tones of sweetness caught my attention. The taste was excellent. A hit of bitterness up front with a lingering burnt malt and coffee flavor. A twinge of chocolate in there, but much less than other porters I've had. Smooth and easy to drink, and it got even better as the beer warmed to room temperature.","sockeye101","Aug 30, 2006"

And not too roasty either.Chocolate notes with some oatmeal grainess.","Sammy","Aug 04, 2006"

Very mild aroma, but some roasted malts detectable. Very rich and smooth flavour. Delicious strong roasted coffee taste to start with some slight sweetness, but finishes with a dry and bitter chocolate flavour. Higher ABV not noticeable at all. Was lighter tasting then I expected.

Lingering notes of coffee and a light smokiness were present. Flavor starts off a bit sweet before some notes of bakers chocolate and roasted malts take over. Some mild notes of dark fruit and a good bit of smokiness round it out. Roasty chocolate finish. Smooth and fairly thick but could stand to have a bit bigger body. Easy drinking for a big brew. Great all around effort on this one.","meathookjones","May 02, 2006"
