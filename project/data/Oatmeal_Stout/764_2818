If I knew more about how to catch beers with infections that haven't fully taken over yet, I might be able to describe it better, because I have a sneaky feeling that's what's going on here. There's a tart, slightly fruity flavor in the back that really doesn't fit the beer's flavor profile. It's too bad, because this would be a tasty one otherwise.","shand","Jun 02, 2013"

It has the mocha and molasses tones that the aroma promised, but these are on the wan and watery side. Texture has watery body and not much fizz.

Pours crystal clear very dark brown color with a 1 finger fairly dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, oats, toast, light char, herbal, molasses, and dark fruitiness. Nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of oats, roasted malt, chocolate, caramel, coffee, light char, toast, bread, toffee, light citrus, and light herbal. Lingering notes of oats, roasted malt, caramel, chocolate, coffee, light char, and herbal on the finish for a bit. Nice balance and robustness of flavors; no cloying on the finish at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice oatmeal stout. Nice balance and robustness of flavors; very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 11, 2012"
3.79,3.6,3,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the nose. There were nice fruity and buttery inclusions, adding a big degree of depth, and surprising layer of complexity. The flavoring showed equally as robust qualities, with that huge vanilla off the bat. This both added to, and helped to cut, the sweetness. In the end the balance was set by the malty tone, and the beer is fun to drink.","TheBrewo","Sep 09, 2012"

The mouthfeel stayed very light a smooth for the whole drink. The smell was full, rich, and nice. And the drinkability was pretty good as well as it was very easy to drink, light bodied and pleasant. I like this beer cask the best so far. Hope to have it again.","Rudgers73","Dec 06, 2007"

4.68,27.9,4.5,4,5,4.5,5,"Thick creamy three finger head with an dark tan hue when Jess pours it from the cask into the plastic Blue Point pint cups in the tasteing room at the brewery. A soft toasty stout aroma with detectable undertones of coffee. Creamy and crisp taste fadeing to a faint coffee flavor with a smooth dry finish thats got something to do with the use of oats. Light, crisp, and silky body with cask creamy carbonation. Delicious beer greatness.","BeerLover729","Apr 27, 2007"

4.67,27.6,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Because it is not as sweet, it's drinkability is very high. Just an all around great oatmeal stout to be had here. Couple this with the Blueberry Ale to make a great Black & Blue. Mmm.","lehows","Beers"
3.75,2.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Appears with a dark cola ruby brown body it's dark when not held to the light and it forms a moccha tan head leaves behind fine lacing after dwindling slowly. Aromatics have dominant dark roasted malt features like mild coffee and dark chocolate, semi soft oatmeal grains as well, not bad. Flavor has powdered cocoa notes and a blend of leafy hop flavors hitting the palate, as it warms a bit more oats come across with a soft smooth mineral character. Dark roasts provide a mild bitterness with more dark chocolate and mild coffee not as sweet as some Oatmeal Stouts out there but this one does a good job of supporting the other two solid Blue Point brews I've tasted thus far. Mouthfeel is medium bodied even carbonation very smooth but I like more fluffy character and a bit more overall body from my oatmeal stous references to compare would be like Wild Goose's, McClausen's, or Troeg's versions. Drinkability is definitely not an issue here great example of a classic style just so many beers to choose from out there, I'm sure I will revisit this offering try it if you find it draft only in the Burgh.","WVbeergeek","0"

4.22,15.3,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Had this on tap while at David Copperfields the other night. Brew was poured to a opaque black color with a frothy tan head that had fantastic retention and left chunky lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is also fantastic with strong notes of chocolate malt, nice roasted scents mixed with a pleasant oat smell. The taste is very good, a little harsh with a burnt flavor at the start but breaks away to a smooth creaminess of caramel and oat flavors. Does have a hop characteristic and is noticeable but plays nice. Over all this is a fine brew, what I feel a oatmeal stout should be like. Characteristics lend it to a great seasonal (colder months) session brew. If you can give it a try, I dont think you will be upset.","Stimack","Nov 18, 2005"
4.12,12.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a deep dak black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a dry oatmeal scent along with loads of black patent and chocolate malts. The taste is good. It has a smooth black/chocolate malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry with an oatmeal feel. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good oatmeal stout. It has good flavor and a kick ass aroma; a good drinker.","WesWes","Oct 02, 2005"

3.47,-5.2,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Had on tap at some bar in NYC, all I know is it is less than 5 minutes from CBGBs...we just stopped in for a quick one. Deep dark chocolate brwon, frothy tan head. Aroam was the expected roastyness, with an additional tangy quality as well. Malty, a pinch dry, the citrusy finish was unexpected as well.","PatandDavid","Aug 17, 2004"
4.33,18.3,4.5,4,5,4,3.5,"In the past I had only tried one other Oatmeal Stout, made by British Superpower Samuel Smith. Bluepoint certainly got something good here. If you are into dark beers this is a must try. The beer is very dark yet not full of the burnt flavor other dark beers posses. I have tried on many occasions to drink this all night, the only problem is I get full first. So I generally brink a Growler to an occasion, let a couple people try .... ??? an oatmeal beer??? but I hate oatmeal.... well so do I! But the beer is a classic","Biggness","Apr 01, 2004"
3.67,0.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"A very dark brown nearly black ale with a light brown head that was quick to leave. Big roasted malt aroma with hints of chocolate and coffee.

A marleous robust mouthfeel but maybe too much for multipile drinks.","ybnorml","Mar 19, 2004"
3.38,-7.7,4.5,4,3,3.5,3,"It has nice tiny creamy bubbles, but I can't say it tastes all that distinctive: dark malt, bit of wine in the finish, like sherry or port, not particularly oatmealy. A decent stout. The more I drink, the more I think it's like Guinness without the nitro, it's a bit sour, a bit metallic, a bit sweet. But nothing much of anything.","gentlebubbles","Mar 12, 2004"

4.1,12,4,4,4,4,4.5,"A very dark/black color with a nice tan head that dissapears by the time you have imbibed half the glass. A very appealing smell, sort of a sweet aroma- very fresh to say the least. As for the taste, this is a rich, sweet oatmeal stout, with nice mellowness to it. It's maltiness hit hard in the beginning, but my palate became used to it, so I did not perceive this beer as too sweet. I also do not think this beer is as heavy as other oatmeal stouts, which is a nice balance. I felt I could have had more of them, which is always a good sign","AaronRed","Apr 26, 2003"
3.88,6,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"pours a deep, deep brown. nearly black. topped with a decent, lasting head. smells heavily of roasted coffee, which is immediately apparent in the taste as well, along with a bit of oatmeal and sloght chocolate sweetness. very bold and hearty, but rather smooth at the same time. not what i expected, but quite enjoyable nonetheless. i'm happy that for the time that i'm stuck on the island, there's at least one local brewery producing decent beers. i thought i'd be hard pressed to find one.","SixpointJMH","Mar 10, 2003"
4.01,9.6,5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a light brown, thick, choppy head. It sort of looks like seafoam, but in a nice sort of way. Head remains and coats the glass down as the beer empties. Smells a little sweet, somewhat fruity. tastes light, with subtle flavors, making it very drinkable","dwarbi","Beers"
3.63,-0.8,3.5,3,4,3,4,"In all, a highly drinkable beer since it is very smooth and subtle about its oatmeal stoutness. Ain't close to, say, Sam Smith Oatmeal by any standard, but an easy beer to throw back.","nomad","0"
