Pours an inky black with a loose, quarter inch, tan-colored head that sizzles and pops and slowly dissipates towards the shoulders.  Nose expresses roast, cocoa and a suggestion of artificial sweetener.  Taste follows nose - coffee notes are somewhat reminiscent of coffee syrup.  There's also some flaked outs in there; however, the flavor profile all comes off a bit thin.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with a water texture and a prickly carbonation.  Overall, a decent oatmeal stout but I was expecting a bit more.  I wouldn't mind giving this one a shot on nitro.","Jwale73","Jan 13, 2015"

It could just be a bad batch I presume, but it is hard to say. The beer is very black, almost too black to be enjoyable considering the horrid burnt wood taste.  It is nowhere as thick as other stouts and it took me several weeks to finish this 6 pack off.  Overall I have a very high opinion of Firestone Walker and would rate it as one of the top 3 breweries in the state of California, but I have to say this really was just not that great.  Not terrible, but just not worth the time or money.","ronniebruner","Dec 22, 2014"

Medium body with a creamy silky mouthfeel and a light level of carbonation. I could drink the hell out of these given half a chance.","johnnnniee","Nov 03, 2014"

4,-0.2,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours an extremely light head that dissipates very quickly. Some head is still left and the color is a creamy brown color. The beer itself is an opaque dark brown that is a little bit black and dark. The beer smell has strong oatmeal notes and dark chocolate notes. Some roasted malt smell comes out but not much. The oatmeal smell is pretty nice and ... oatmealy. The beer flavor is very similar to the smell with strong creamy oatmeal notes with a side of sweet dark chocolate. The taste also has an interesting slightly metallic water taste that adds to the eflavor and provides a nice balance. The mouthfeel is heavy bodied with biting carbonation. The beer feels fairly smooth and goes down smooth as well. Overall, a very good oatmeal stout and one worth getting again.","HattedClassic","Jun 10, 2014"

Smell is of roasted and sweet malts, akin to some coffee and chocolate with possible nuts (hazel) or toffee, maybe caramel. The oatmeal is noticeable as it smoothes down a light bodied beer (light for a stout) and helps balance a light coffee/roasted malt edge with some minor chocolate and toffee like sweetness. Little bit of woodiness on this beer as well and at times there seems to be a boozy, dry finish.","clayrock81","Jun 05, 2014"

Tastes like an old shoe in a good way. Dark, aged fruit (dates, burnt grain) with a high drinkability factor. Alcohol factors too prevalent, considering the only 5.5% and thus cuts down on mouth and taste. Smooth and balanced, but not too excitable. If one was to drink dark ales for hours and hours, this would be the beer. Goes well with tobacco and chocolate, though the flavors are unremarkable on their own. Firestone makes very solid beer, and this is no exception. But, considering, it could be much better.","Eisen","Dec 14, 2013"

Significantly thinner body than other Oatmeal Stouts I've experienced. Heavy roasted malt flavor, not much sweetness, weak coffee aftertaste. Bitterness from hops is very noticeable, but no hop aroma. Odd, bubbly finish. If you like roasty stouts this may be your thing but sadly it's not mine.","anarchia","Nov 05, 2013"

I'm only getting deep malt with a touch of brown sugar. Taste is much different, still the heavy malt character, interesting oat flavor, faint hop earthiness, brown sugar/caramel. Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin. Not nearly as syrupy as I was hoping for from a oatmeal centered stout. I'm surprised this beer becomes so damn tasty in the barrels. Merkin is considerably better. Maybe I shouldn't have aged this one. Who knows?","mverity","Nov 03, 2013"

In the flavor it is soft, but it is also noticeable; I do like that it was kept at a very low level here, but I almost feel like it could use a touch more as I almost feel like it is too subtle. That can be a dangerous thing though, as I definitely prefer that the barrel character be kept fairly low. Still, this is a fantastic beer and is something I am quite happy to have a 6-pack of (the $6.99 price doesn’t hurt either); the extra boost of smooth complexity from the Bourbon barrel really adds something to this beer.","Gueuzedude","Sep 29, 2013"

Smell is smoky and earthy, faint scent of hops, fresh milled grain, dark chocolate and iced coffee. Flavor is much more bright and interesting than the nose suggests - plum, burnt raisin, earthy roasted coffee, vanilla, sweet toffee, cocoa nibs, slight hint of fresh cut grass - absolutely delicious! Medium bodied and perfectly carbonated for the style - smooth and creamy - extremely easy drinker for a stout. Overall amazing stout, that as mentioned, drinks ridiculously easy - could crush a few of these in a single sitting, no problem!","DeanMoriarty","May 28, 2013"

Malts are more roasted than I like in an oatmeal stout, yet this beer comes up a little thin when compared to the non oatmeal variety.

Pours fairly crystal clear almost opaque dark brown color with a 1 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, oats, toast, brown bread, light coffee, floral, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roasted malt notes with oats and light hops. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, oats, roasted malt, toast, brown bread, light coffee, floral, and roasted earthiness. Slight earthy roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, oats, roasted malt, light coffee, toast, and light earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of roasted/bready malt flavors with oats and light hops; with nice robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish; moderately dry on the finish as well. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice oatmeal stout. All around nice flavor balance and robustness; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 22, 2013"

There is something about this beer that takes me back to my childhood when I used to eat half-melted ice cream with a spork from the paleta man. I often imagine myself eating Velvet Merlin with a spork. The aroma is not immediately prominent until you take a drink. That thick head keeps it all in. You inhale slightly when you drink too, right? Of course you do. I enjoy the aroma and the taste very close together with this one. Almost at once. It is nutty, chocolatey, caramely, roasty, and malty and all in a perfect balance. Not one exceeding the other. Like a group of sexy women walking abreast towards you in slow motion. For me? Fuggles is a funny name for hops. I get taken to another place when I'm enjoying this outstanding beer. It is unfortunate that it is not available year round.

I know some people (weirdos, all) that would prefer this approach. But if you're an oatmeal stout aficionado, maybe you'll find virtues in Velvet Merlin my palate doesn't appreciate as well.

4.04,0.7,4.25,4,4,4.25,4,"From notes. Opaque dark-brown with highlighting along the edges of the glass. The aroma, unlike the flavor, was fantastic. There are notes of chocolate, coffee, roasty malt, dry oak and a well-balanced bourbon flavor that meshed very well unlike some bourbon barrel-aged beers. The taste had all of these flavors, but they were far more muted. The bourbon flavor became almost watery. The feel may have been the real culprit. It was much too thin for a stout, much less a barrel-aged stout. A cask would likely bring out the creamy lush mouthfeel of the oatmeal stout. At any rate, it was still a good beer, and they get points for not overwhelming a relatively small stout with bourbon barrel-aging. Would be nice to see it in a cask. Edit (12/2/10): Bottle. I’ve been drinking this regularly since six-packs arrived and like it even better now. Excellent chocolate aroma/flavor, little bourbon. Smooth. Tons of flavor for the size.

I was up at the brewpub in Paso Robles some weeks ago and they've named another beer Velvet Merkin, a sort-of 'big brother' to the Merlin (I think it was the Merlin, barrel-aged, but I could be wrong and I don't feel like looking it up right now). Whatever you want to call it, for a low ABV oatmeal stout, you could do a lot worse. This is widely available here in San Diego and it's become a sort of session-stout for me.

Smell is dominantly coffee with a nice fudgey chocolate background. Subtle hopping. The taste is like a mocha kind of flavor, nice french roast coffee sort of flavor with the semi-sweet dark chocolate fudge I smelled earlier. Kind of pick up on a chestnut flavor. Very smooth. Earthy roasted and nutty flavors are complimented nicely with slightly floral hops that aren't too bitter or resiny. The feel is a bit lighter than I expected at first, not very dense as the smell and flavors would suggest, but as it warmed up a bit it became thicker. Highly drinkable and very tasty beer, overall. So far, I have not been disappointed with Firestone Walker. Velvet Merlin just made its way into regular rotation with me.","kbanks13","Jan 22, 2012"

Smell of oatmeal chocolate, vague raisin bread perhaps, and a wee bit of molasses? Great smell. The taste is slightly underwhelming at first but as the beer warms, the complexity begins to come out more, and it's almost like the perfect combo between a cream stout and chocolate stout. And the best part of the beer is the mouthfeel. It lives up to the name, feels very velvet, goes down smooth and full, leaving you satisfied.

Flavors are bold and balanced, the body smooth and creamy.

Light scent of coffee grind. its faint, but its there. taste- nice milk chocolate, met with immediate nice carbonation, and there is the coffee grind in the back.

A bit of vanilla and licorice comes out as it warms up. I wouldn't have guessed a portion of this was barrel aged, but when you are looking for those notes you can find them. Initial taste is roasted coffee going into light dark chocolate with some hints of vanilla and licorice. The finish has a slight tea-like bitterness. Don't really get any bourbon in the taste.

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cream, dark chocoalte, and subtle coffee. The flavor was of sweet malt, coffee, cream, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and dark fruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was excellent. This one went down very smoothly (almost like velvet) on the palate.

The nose is rather excellent. The oatmeal character is so fresh and so prominent, it smells like I've drizzled some granola with coffee. Rich, beautiful, oatmeal cereal with a little bit of raisin. The coffee isn't the richest or the best, but it works wonderfully well here, despite being rather instant coffee-like. Likewise, the palate opens with a blend of oatmeal, coffee and a little bit of fruit, a little raisin-like? There's also an underlying caramel sweetness that's light, working very well with the oatmeal. A balancing bitterness is provided by a little bit of coffee and a little bit of roast, and I also get a touch of Fuggles in the back, earthy and a little leafy. Drying and roasty on the finish with oatmeal and coffee, this beer is excellent. Medium-light in body with soft carbonation, this has a perfect level of carbonation. As for drinkability, well, I am trying to work on a presentation here, but I just cracked my second bottle of this. Suffice to say, this is one of the better oatmeal stouts I've had in a long time.

(Side note: The racism involved in certain episodes of Peabody and Sherman is priceless. Here is all the proof you'll need that the children of that era grew up dumb as brix.)

It reminds of almost of a chocolate covered coffee bean, which is probably one of my favorite aromas. Extremely smooth texture. There's a touch of carbonation and a very smooth finish. The sweetness from the sugars seems to result in a smooth texture, one of the reasons I love this beer. Very nice caramel malt notes. There are notes of roasted malts, but they are very subtle. The roasted malts kind seem to be in a battle with the carbonation. Every sip I take I can taste it, but the bubbles cut through at times, you get just enough to know it's there. The carbonation makes this beer feel thinner than it really is. The funny thing is, there's not that much. This is a very gentle beer; however, I would have liked some more of the aromatics to come through in the taste, it's too much of a tease.

Nose is straightforward, but good. Heavy on cocoa, with a solid dose of vanilla present as well. The flavor kicks things up a bit. Chocolate still dominates, along with vanilla as the main supporting player, but now a bit of heavily roasted astringency creeps in. It's a nice substitute for a hop bite, and makes way for a slight oaky finish. Mouthfeel is great, but what I've come to expect from an oatmeal stout. Body is impressively rich, especially for a 5.5% beer, and ultra smooth thanks to the oats. Carbonation is picture perfect understated, it gets the job done but doesn't get in the way of all the malty flavors.

3.76,-6.2,4,3,4,4,4,"D- an easy drinker, I would get this beet again yo introduce people to the style, but it's really nothing too complex.","ETF5000","Dec 30, 2009"
3.58,-10.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Very filling and enjoyable, however would have benefited more from a lower alcohol concentration.","TheJollyHop","Dec 30, 2009"
3.83,-4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"D: Certainly a very drinkable beer with very little alcohol presence. I was really excited to get to try this, but a bit let down by it.","womencantsail","Dec 24, 2009"
3.97,-1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Quite mild...with less alcohol this could be a ""session"" beer.","augustgarage","Dec 09, 2009"
3.86,-3.7,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"On-tap at Beachwood BBQ a few weeks ago at the Firestone 13 party. Review from notes. Poured into a goblet, very dark brown with red highlights. About one centimeter of tan head, high retention, fair lacing. Aroma is bready with oats, toasty, biscuity, fruity, and pops with some chocolate malts to it. Tastes of estery chocolate malts, robust levels of oats, biscuit and dough. Finish is roasty, bready, and cookielike. Feels thick and silky. Good oatmeal stout, better than average, but do not expect anything more than a regular oatmeal stout.","vacax","Dec 08, 2009"
4.22,5.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"D-""Velvet"" smooth, with no residual alcoholic burn, long lasting finish.","slayer3604","Dec 04, 2009"
3.82,-4.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours with slight head fading rapidly to little or no lacing. Displays a great dark nose with lots of malts and roasted notes. Zesty yet rich on the palate, more dark flavors backing up the nose. In the mouth it is very effervescent and light, lacks stuffing. The finish is lingering, tart and slightly bitter but well integrated. For a stout, it is rather light but with good flavor and aromas.","cbarrett4","Feb 28, 2009"
3.36,-16.2,4.5,3.5,3,4.5,3,"Nice sipper - one is enough - the bitter burnt flavor is intense.","ThirstyBird","Feb 12, 2009"

4.03,0.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Have had this at multiple locations, most recently at the Firestone Night of the Ales, across from the Toronado. It pours a midnight black with no head - some lacing around the edges. The initial smell is of coffee and roasted malt; some chocolate undertones reveal themselves after further sniffing. Overall it is decent oatmeal stout but nothing too remarkable - and considering some of the other FW beers this one falls into the category of 'session beers' but not 'savory beers', like the anniversary and other limited releases in my opinion.","JoeySchlitz","Jan 02, 2009"
3.78,-5.7,3.5,3,4,4.5,4,"On tap at Toronado in San Diego. Poured a blackish with no head at all. I could not even generate more than a little tiny bit of tan fizz after major swirling. There was absolutely no aroma on this beer at first smell. I even had friends check to make sure my nose wasn't messed up and they didn't get any smell either. After drinking about half the glass I could get a slight bit of roastiness out of it. The taste was much better though, real mellow overall. A tiny bit of chocolate but mostly a roasted barley type of coffee flavor. Had a pretty good silky mouthfeel. Despite the lame appearance and smell it was still a pretty good beer, and fairly sessionable I would say.","MiScusi","Dec 30, 2008"
3.95,-1.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Ummm....it's black in appearance, the beer leaves some amount of lacing on the glass. What we have here is a very sweet stout. Semi-sweet chocolate all around, rolled oats...what else? A little thinner than I was expecting, but overall, this is a good oatmeal stout.","DoubleJ","Dec 28, 2008"
3.63,-9.5,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Drinkability is pretty good, it goes down very easily due to rounded flavors and smoothness. On the other hand, it's rather boring and lacking depth, and I didn't feel like having another.","ccrida","Dec 19, 2008"
3.92,-2.2,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"D: Nice oatmeal stout from Firestone, it shows that they don't have to create a big beer when they barrel age stuff. Nice brew all around.","Halcyondays","Dec 18, 2008"
4.1,2.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Evaporative flavor on the slightly dry finish. Not especially complex despite what is written, but very enjoyable to drink.","charlzm","Beers"
4.2,4.7,4,4,4,5,4.5,"Certainly a tasty brew and fans of Firestone Walker will of course love to seek this out... and the should.","errantnight","0"
4,-0.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Tap @ O'Brien's. Pours dark brown with a medium tan head. Nestle Quik cocoa, malted milk balls, leather, vanilla, and roasted coffee in the nose. More malted chocolate and oatmeal in the taste, with a strong cherry pop towards the finish. The cherry sweetness came out of nowhere, was out of character for the beer, but kind of nice. Almost like a German chocolate cake taste. Good beer.","magictrokini","Jun 01, 2008"
4.01,0,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"I was excited to try this after having Saucerful of Merkin and wanting to know what those two components tasted like by themselves, this beer is right around six percent alcohol supposedly but it feels even lighter than that at times, would like to drink again, recommended","Floydster","Beers"
