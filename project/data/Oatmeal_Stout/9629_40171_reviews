"Overall: a very interesting beer. I was surprised at the power of the peanut butter. Not for everyone but certainly interesting. I don't think I'd reach for one very often"

"Every time I have had this beer, it tastes infected. Not a bret sour but something way more lacto. Under the sour notes I can smell the peanuts so I can see where it would have potential in a healthy batch. First time I had it was in their first release of six pack bottles when they were still using the gold caps instead of the white with black logo on it. All of that run of uber gubber and pbj were infected and recalled. Maybe I was so affected by that batch I can taste any amount of misplaced bacteria in every newer batch."
"Overall I liked it a lot, but definitely room for improvement."

"Overall: I really enjoyed this. Straightforward but with easily defined and pleasant mild flavors of roasted peanuts and chocolate without being overly sweet."

"O - This was my favorite from the night between the Turtle, Smore and Uber. This had a lot more drinkability and to finish it off, we combined this with Soft Parade to make the 'PB&J'. Another job well done from Shorts, I hope I can find Bottles of this soon."
"O - Definitely one of my favorite specialties from Short's, although some complaints about souring led me to believe it might be an issue with handling. So a fresh growler was in order, and sure enough, no problems. Delicious."

"O: Overall I really did not enjoy this at all. It is very below average. A drain pour for me. I would not seek this out again. 2.5"
"O: I'm a bit torn on this beer. On one hand the nose is quite strong and meets the advertised tones of the beer. On the other hand, the flavor profile indicates something is not quite right. Hard to tell if this is a yeast issue, sanitation issue, oil issue or simply my palate on the intended beer. After I've had half the glass, the tartness has become less evident allowing the peanuts and malts to resurface again. Would I drink again? Yes. Would I prefer on tap? Yes - as I've had less issues with novelty beers deviating from their former selves associated with bottle conditions and dating issues. Worth a peak as a beer."
"O - Wasn't going for a lactic tart stout. Beer has a lot of potential with a very nice roasted peanut. Unfortunately like way too many Shorts beers, this one was horribly infected. They really need to get that under control."
"D - an interesting beer; i would like to see more oatmeal character come through personally; pretty drinkable all in all"
"O: Glad I've tried this concoction... Not sure I am going to be looking for this one ever again except to foist on others. Nevertheless, nice try at it."
"OVERALL: I appreciate the attempt and the willingness to experiment, but this was not my thing. Peanut butter tasted somewhat synthetic and out of place in the beer, while it also masked any other attempt at creating complexity. This is a bit of a novelty that I can see people trying once, but I just can’t imagine drinking this on a regular basis. It was interesting, but it’s a one-and-done for me. Thanks again TheSevenDuffs."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a medium black with a quickly dissipating tan head. Aroma is coffee, light peanuts and...dammit, there it is again. The sour smell that means for the second year in a row I’ve fallen prey to infected Goober. Taste, lightly roasty with subtle peanut butter and yep, a foul, sour finish. Mouthfeel is unpleasantly slick and lacking in body. God, when will I frickin’ learn with Shorts’ oddball releases?"
"Overall – Very interesting beer. Some of Short’s beers don’t work…I think this one does. While I wouldn’t grab a six pack of it in the future, it actually was better than I was expecting and as stated was a great way to cap the night after having such a sweet fruit beer. Tasty."
"O - meh."
"Mouthfeel: It seems rather thin but the taste hangs on the tongue nicely."
"O- Solid for me, I'm a PB freak so I'm definitely in this beers corner."
"I thought this was a well made stout with a nice flavor profile. My friend referred to Uber Goober and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups as ""the adult milk and cookies"". Can't say I disagree."
"O: Another unique idea from a rather unique brewery. I have to say though, I don't think I've found a Short's beer that I've really wanted to drink again. Glad I got to try this once though."
"Overall, well, it works. Interesting mix of flavors. Nothing aggressive or offensive. Couldn't see sitting down and drinking a number of these, but one a sitting is good. Seek it out for nothing more than the novelty works."
"Massive thanks goes out to beeruser for sharing this one with funkydelic and I at an impromptu tasting! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller sampler wine glass. Poured a deep dark brown with a minimal off-white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted peanuts, salty, and slight fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, nutty, and subtle saltiness. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. Nothing too awe-inspring going on in this one at all. It honestly reminded me of eating roasted peanuts on both the aroma and the flavor. More so in the aroma though, as it wasn't as salty in the flavor fortunately. Glad I got to try this one, but doubt I would have it again."
"D: Way too hot for 6.5% I thought it was a RIS. One's enough for me in a lifetime."
"O- Peanut is in your face and authentic. My mouth keeps going back to ash tray though. Overly bitter made this a hard one to choke down. Like the originality but won't be trying again."
"D - I finished the beer, but the sourness was very off-putting. I can't imagine that was intentional. Probably won't seek this one out again."
"O: Just not digging this. The peanuts seem gimmicky and I don't really like the base beer."
"The roasted peanuts bring me back to my childhood, and eating peanuts at the old Tampa Stadium watching the Buccaneers play..well lose with my father. GREAT MEMORIES! When a beer takes you back to a special place in your life, that is how you know this is a very special beer! I will be hunting more of this down!"
"overall - cool ass experiment - A for effort. but i'll stick with this one sixer i think."
"Pours very black with dark red highlights when held up to the light. There is no head but there is an oily film on the top of the beer. Very little lacing that drops down into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smells of dark roasted malts, oatmeal, and peanut butter. Very rich taste of dark malt, roasted oats, and roasted peanuts. Definitely lives up to its name in the taste category. I don't think I have ever seen another beer that is brewed with peanuts. The mouthfeel is what kills this one for me. No carbonation and very watery on the palate. There is also a weird acidity that lingers on the tongue after each sip. Overall, this is another good and interesting beer from Short's that I am glad I got to try. I love peanuts so this was something neat to see. I just wish the mouthfeel was a bit better."
"O ~ an experiment worth a try.. possibly blend this with a strawberry lambic or framboise? I know Short's does a PB&J, which is also interesting. The last one I had held a bit of a soury funk to it...so not sure it was 100% all together.."
"(12oz bottle from rayl101!). Pours near black/dark brown with thin khaki head. Aroma has lots of peanut, peanut shell along with some dark chocolate/cocoa nibs. Smells very rich. Taste is roasty bitter, but the sweet, slightly tangy malts quickly cancel out the roast. Medium bodied with a creamy texture. The finish is dry, but not overly done. This is a well-balanced beer with several things working together pretty nicely. I think they did a good job here."
"O - An interesting beer and one that I would drink again, but not one that I will go too far out of my way to hunt down."
"Overall: This is a very interesting beer that I'm glad I got the chance to try. I don't think it would ever be a go to stout for me, but it will be my go to peanut stout from here on out."
"Pours jet black with a small light tan head. In the aroma, dry peanut butter and sweet oatmeal roast. In the taste, a roasted malt and a sweet oatmeal to a dry nuttiness. A smooth and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry to sweet oatmeal in the aftertaste. Nice dry nuttiness being balanced with a sweet oatmeal."
"O- Interesting brew for sure. Glad I split this one with fiveo2270 I think it would be a little hard to drink the whole bottle myself."
"Overall fairly meh, some off flavors, the peanuts were interesting but not great, the acrid and acidic coffee just kills it, as well as the feel that its lacking some malts."
"Overall- A great stout and a good change from the usual. Personally I really liked the added roasted peanut taste in this one, and would definitely drink it again. A very solid offering from Short's here."
"Pours an espresso black with a dark khaki fingers worth of head. Nose of a slight acridness and metallic quality. Touch of stale coffee roasted stale peanuts as well as some jammy artificial fruit. Taste is a sour fruit, more stale coffee and lingering cigarette smoke on the taste. Also pick up some roasted peanut when searching for it. Easy drinking and well carbonated for the style. Didnt do this much of a favor after just finishing my first breakfast stout, no where even close in quality."
"O: It wasn't hard to split this bottle between my girlfriend, and she definitely liked it more than I did. It isn't too bad of a beer, but just not really my thing. My girlfriend did really enjoy it though. Definitely interesting, and glad to try it."
"O: The idea behind the brew was definitely intriguing, but as it stands, this beer fails on just about every level. My wife (who I attempted to share this brew with) and I both agree: I couldn't imagine anyone liking this beer.... and I've never said that before.."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style, with moderate carbonation. Overall it was a very interesting beer. It really did taste like a roasty bag of peanuts. I got a lot of the salty, earthy, peanut shell flavors to it and not nearly as much of the peanut butter flavor I expected. It was interesting and a cool beer to try but I couldn't drink that much of it. In my opinion, a little more stout flavors coming through would have gone a long way. It also felt a bit salty overall. Very cool beer overall, and they did a pretty good job at getting some real peanut flavor to come through. I just don't think it was for me."
"O:Another interesting beer from Shorts, a lot of nutty flavor dominates this drink with some underlying sweetness. A overall easy drink that is one worth trying."
"Drink and overall: I think its solid. Compared to other oatmeal stouts like FBS and WnB, it falls short, mostly on the mouthfeel."
"Something went amiss here...it could be a problem with my storage or possibly a bad batch from the brewery. The immense carbonation and slight sourness seem to indicate an infection and are forcing my hand in pouring this beer out with more than 3/4 of it remaining."
"D: This one really got the aroma down, but like a few other Short's beers, I feel that the taste is a letdown in comparison. Having this next to the PB&J, I felt this was the worse of the two. However, when I blended the two beers (2 parts Uber Goober to 1 part PB&J), it better captured the peanut flavor that PB&J was lacking."
"While there was certainly no shortage of Short's flair here (the peanut flavor really is well done) but the big alcohol presence and uneven feel kept this one from reaching its true potential. I could have used a little less Uber with my Goober here I think."
"The CPJ"
"Fulled medium body, a bit creamy and smooth on the tongue. This was definitely a little out there, but I definitely enjoyed it. If they wanted to make a beer that tasted like straight up peanut butter, I think they pretty much nailed it."
"The flavor brings mostly peanuts, along with some roast character and a mild funk presence. The beer is well done, albeit another wild idea from Short's. Intriguing and fun, I enjoyed this beer and would have it again. A small sample was plenty for me, however."
"Definitely low. This is a relatively hard to find beer in Indiana, plus you're playing Russian roulette with some of their beers. I really hope the fix their bottling issues as they can easily become one of my favorite breweries. Will definitely try this on tap if I have the opportunity."
"Pours black with an initial faint tan head which fades rapidly to nothing. No lace on glass. The nose is not surprizingly nutty for a beer made with peanuts. Power of suggestion says = peanuts in here. Tastes band-aidishly plastic with a ""brown"" earthy dirt-like finish. Kind of like the peanuts weren't wasted or something. Mouthfeel is bland. In all fairness I do note some possible interference from previous glasses. Overall, this is unique, but would not seek after it."
"Beer is a little thin and finishes with this strong peanut shell / roast taste. It's considerably thinner than I was expecting. It's not as bad as most of the reviews make it out to be, you can definitely tell that it was made with peanuts. Perhaps the roast of the peanuts and the roast of the grain is what is clashing on the palate, the finish is a little rough. I don't think I'll have it again."
"D - Glad to have tried this one once, I'm not sure I would enjoy two or three in one sitting. Seems like the recipe might need a little adjusting to bring out more of the peanut flavor."
"The body is moderately thick with carbonation spritzing it up midway through, then smooths out on the finish. Mild cocoa, coffee char, and the faintest of nuttiness. Sourness is ever-present. Eh. I don't like this. Maybe I'm a little gun-shy with these guys now, but this could have been so much better. Out she goes. Won't have this again."
"D: this beer is definitely worth a try, very unique, I think the base beer needs tweaking to better complement the peanut."
"Drinkability - Although it lacks in some areas, it's a good dessert beer. Not something you drink on a warm summer day. But then again, how many stouts can you?"
"D - This drinks pretty nicely, but definitely a beer I'd rather share as I don't think peanut is something I want in my everyday oatmeal stout. Fun to try, but not a beer I'd ever have back to back."
"Hats off to Short's for their creativity once again. Some of their brews come off as novelty but this is a good beer."
"Drinkability is fine, but slightly hampered by the unusual flavor profile. I'm glad I had one, but I'd choose to follow it with a very different beer."
"A good effort from Short's, but I think I'll stick to their other brews from now on."
"D - Goes down so VERY smoothly for a stout. Be careful with this one!"
"D- It's a really good beer, but I don't see drinking more than 1-2 in a sitting. I'm definitely glad I tried it, and would drink it again, if not seek out. As Short's goes, it's not my favorite ""concept"" beer, but pretty darn good all the same. I'd actually prefer even more ""in your face"" peanut qualities."
"Received this one as an extra in a recent trade. I have been unimpressed with recent short's beers, but this one was pretty good. Deep, rich black color with a smallish brown head. Smells a lot like peanut butter, chocolate and roasted malt. Creamy, medium bodied, with a definite peanut presence, along with roasted malt and chocolate."
"Drinkability: I took a few sips and moved on, thought to my self I was thankful it was only 12oz. I am a bit over these weird shorts beers."
"P.S. On a side note, on my recent visit to the brewpub, i bought a growler of this beer and it was listed as 9%ABV on the beer board, so perhaps this may reflect the most recent brewing."
"D: i dont really want more than a bottle of this. wouldnt seek out again. i would drink it if it was offered, but doubt id pay for it."
"Uber Goober is an interesting stout. It has an oily feel and look. Its very well-balanced and not too sweet or strong. A good tasting and creative beer. Delicious."
"Gotta give shorts credit for experimenting, but this one is slightly off the mark."
"Overall this was one different, kick ass beer. I thought the peanuts worked very well with the roasted malts. I would for sure get this beer again. Shorts continues to blow my mind with their crazy concoctions, keep up the good work guys."
"D: Glad to try it, but one is enough for me."
"I like the shorts beers, they are not for everyone but i like it when breweries are trying different things. This would never be a go to for me but, decent little snack."
"For what it is, it's tasty. I'd drink it again."
"Cocoa, coffee, and pie crust back it up. Amazing. It sort of tastes like a lightly sweetened peanut butter pie, but it is rather meager compared to the aroma. I can't be too disappointed, what do you expect? Legumes aside, it is a good stout. A little molasses, burnt sugar, neutral hops... I don't care what anyone says about oats only being for body, I can taste oats, there is some taste familiar in every oatmeal stout, including this one. That being said, the mouthfeel does not quite have the depth and roundness, but it ain't bad either."
"Pours black. Smells like an oatmeal stout, with the faintest touch of peanuts. Maybe a bit thinner than expected. The taste is ok. Finishes with peanuts and starts with a mediocre oatmeal stout. Would be easily ignored if it wasn't at least interesting. Moderate drinkability, but the peanut flavor just isn't smoothly added to a well made oatmeal stout, instead the peanut flavor sits at the back and unintegrated into a blasé stout."
"Overall: Without a lot of bold, overpowering flavors in this beer, combined with the low level of carbonation, this beer is easy to drink. It finishes clean as well."
"Poured to a one inch head that didnt hang around very long. Had a little lacing going on but not much. Brew itself was almost black in color. Left some settlement in the bottom of the bottle. Smelled of peanuts. coffee, chocolate, and malt. Also was sweet smelling. Tasted of strong chocolate,coffee, malt, and had a peanut aftertaste. No taste of alcohol. Felt good in the mouth. I thought the carbonation was right. Had to much chocolate for me. Actually thought it was a little on the heavy side for my liking."
"Drinkability was great. This was tasty, a little different, but 2 were plenty for me in one sitting as the brew is pretty solid."
"Another brew from the mad scientists of food based beers. I hope to someday travel and visit the brewpub. Very nice job Shorts!"
"I think Short's got what they were shooting for here almost perfectly."
"D - This beer was a treat. Great flavors. Would enthusiastically recommend."
"I found this to be rather enjoyable. I like peanuts. I like oatmeal stouts. I really like peanuts in my oatmeal stout. I would definitely seek this out again."
"Poured black with caramel-colored edges, but almost no head at all, and only a few minor scraps of lacing. Smell is definitely dominated by peanut butter, with a faint note of roasted grains and some malty sweetness supporting it. It's a very enjoyable scent. Mouthfeel is sort of appropriately buttery and chewy, and the oily body feels full in the mouth, but vanishes a little disappointingly quickly on swallowing, causing you to realize it's thinner than it first tasted. The peanut flavors are very present in the overall coating left in the mouth, but they come into the flavor profile late, offering rich, velvety tone instead of bombastic sweetness, which actually impresses me, as I don't necessarily expect that kind of restraint in a Short's. On the downside, it's a trifle watery, and there isn't a whole lot more to the flavor profile beyond some mild, basic stout characteristics: e.g. some chocolate notes, a charred quality, and a very mild, malty-seeming bitterness in the aftertaste that could be a subdued hop bite. Drinkability is exceptionally high, and like most people, I love peanut butter as a flavor, so it's really easy to enjoy this one. It's not quite complex or bold enough to be a full-blown A, but it's probably the most pleasantly drinkable Short's beer I've yet to try. I'd give it a B+ on my own, but the BA calculator tallies it out as an A-."
"D- Once again Short's does it for me. They are the masters of brewing funky beers that deliver what they say they will. The ABV like all their beers are hidden well enough that you don't notice it until it's too late. Super drinkable and putting down a six pack of this is very easy to do!"
"Beer pours nicely into beer mug. the brownish black bodied brew has a thin tan head that has good retention, moderate carbonation and excellent lacing that looks nice on the side of the mug. The smell is very much a roasted smell of coffee, peanuts, and some chocolate. The taste is of peanuts, a little bit of chocolate, caramel, some hops, and the ending taste is of coffee. It has a little bit of bitter in the taste, but mostly has a sweeter taste to it that is well balanced. The mouthfeel is a smooth creamy taste that has a nice medium to full body to this beer. The smoothness of this oatmeal stout makes this a beer that is very easy to drink. Great beer and a must try."
"Worth giving a shot if you like peanut butter, can't say anything wonderful things about how real the aroma is. Just doesn't carry over to the taste, which wouldn't be bad if was tastey itself, but its not."
"Joe Short wants you to think when you drink. He wants you to think about how his beers work when common sense says it never will. He wants you to think about why no one has done this before. Ok, maybe that is just what I am thinking when I drink his beers but I am sure he would appreciate the thought. Uber Goober is a very good beer. Not a session beer but on I would not think twice about a repeat. One worth seeking out."
"Poured from bottle into imperial pint glass. As dark as dark can be with very little head. A dark tan almost copper colored ring hugs the inside of the glass. The smell is what makes this beer in my opinion...its like chocolate covered peanuts roasted in coffee. Taste is not too far behind..malt and peanuts taking center stage as it coats the tongue adequately. No problem finishing the bottle, doesnt cloy or bore , but you better like peanuts !"
"I would recommend this to peanut lovers, and stout lovers."
"Pours a nice medium brown color with a bit of a light tan head. The nose really does bring some peanut character through with a bit of mild bread behind that. Taste is light peanut and not too much else. They hit the concept but it just doesn't do all that much for me. The feel is nice and a bit creamy, really bringing the flavor forward, which is good as there really isn't a terrible amount of flavor there. Drinks fairly well but is one dimensional."
"Poured a very dark brown almost black with a thin tan head that left a little lacing sticking to the glass. The nose was quite nice consisting of peanut butter, slight coffee, chocolate, and booze notes. The flavor caught me by surprise cause it seems like it is infected due to the sour character it has on the palate. It did have the peanut butter and choclate notes but I don't think the tart sourness is intentional. There was also a little booze and coffee notes as well. The brew was medium in body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a sweet, tart, and boozy finish. It did not drink that good due to the sour character on this oatmeal stout. Usaully I expect some creaminess from this sytle. Well too bad."
"Man, this is really too bad. I can *almost* taste a really excellent, incredibly unique beer underneath the critters who've fouled all over the Goober. If Short's makes this beer again I'd be happy to try it - very, very fresh. Right now though, not good. Two drain pours in a row."
"This was a one and done for me, same as many Shorts beers. They try a lot of odd things, but Huma Lupa Licious is the only one I return to regularly."
"I want to like Shorts, but until they get their sanitation under control I won't be trading for any more of their beers."
"D: Goes down alright, mild kick, somewhat balanced, pairs far better with food than on it's own. Not one to sit with for the night, but a beer to have with dinner."
"Pouring black with ample tan head into a tulip glass, this brew smells like roasted malts and roasted peanuts. Tastes slightly sweet, with more peanuty flavor. There is some bitter chocolate in here too. Tastes a bit like the beer version of a Reese's peanut butter cup to me, and that I like. Somewhat boozy for 6.5%, and mouthfeel is fairly thick. Overall, I'm a big fan of this one. Really creative effort."
"D: I am one and done with this one. I love Shorts and always will support...this is one of my lesser favorites. But props need to go to Shorts for inventive style and venture"
"D - I think this one might be infected. HOPE it's infected. Drain pour."
"Overall, a disappointing beer from a Brewery that is usually a sure thing."
"D- The flavor here is just not appealing. I love Short's Brewing for trying something interesting and unique, but this does not do it for me."
"Bottle from the new 6-pack seasonal. Tremendous roast aroma, black with fabulous brown head. Carbonation is right there. The taste is very sour, I cannot imagine that this is intentional. Yes, peanut, yes stout. But sour? Above average mouthfeel, but sour is one step backward for me, one big step backward for the masses."
"Inky black with a dense brown head that sticks around a while leaving no lace, this is solid stuff. The nose is heavy on the lactic sourness, this is quite terribly infected with a blend of nice roast, ground peanuts and the sourness and an ashy character. The palate is intensely sour, undrinkably so (and this from a sourhead). The heavy infection washes out all the other flavors. Drying and fruity on the finish with a lingering bitterness, this is rather awful. Light in body with a high level of carbonation, this isn't even close to good. I'd like to try it fresh, though."
"D: Not quite a drain pour, the sour flavors become more evident the warmer the ale gets. Get it cold and the start and end are good."
"D - Honestly, it's not God awful. I'd have this over a BMC, but two infected beers in a row doesn't reflect well on Short's. Unfortunately for them, the poor review reflects their mistake and I look forward to having a good bottle (hopefully)."
"Lots of tight carbonation up front and it is slightly infected/oxidizes with lots of sweetness and slight tart flavor. There are some nice silky chocolate notes that are slightly roasted. Prominent oatmeal presence along with some toffee and licorice and a smooth slightly creamy roasted peanut favor."
"Blah, sour, tart, and tangy...not what I'm looking for in an oatmeal stout. This is infected and the beer is ruined. Beware. I was really looking forward to trying this...drain pour."
"This beer is fairly drinkable. The mouthfeel and the potency to the taste make it good but make it a little hard to drink as time progresses."
"I guess I shouldn't be too surprised given some of the recent reviews on this one, but I still had my hopes up. This one is definitely infected with a sourness in the taste that seriously limits the drinkability. Need to find a growler of this one to get a better idea of the real intent."
"Drinkability is average. I like what they did here, and appreciate the fact that it's probably tough to add peanuts without getting the beer infected in some way. My advice is to drink this as fresh as possible!"
"If you have this beer already, drink it now before it gets even worse. If you don't have it yet, don't bother searching for it. Hopefully this gets re-released in the future so I can give it another shot!"
"Overall this was not at all what I was expecting. This was simply an excellent stout and something I could drink several of in row with ease."
"Another unique brew from a brewery that does some great different things with beer."
"Got this bottle courtesy of Telix. Pours out dark, almost black with a two finger peanut shell colored head that quickly fizzles out. The nose is exactly what the bottle has promised, an oatmeal stout with peanuts. The peanut aroma isn't overpowering, but it is pleasantly noticeable in the background. Unfortunately the peanuts don't have the same effect in the taste. The flavor of the roasted oats are overpowered by the salty, oily quality of the peanuts. There is only a hint of peanut flavor in the finish. The mouthfeel is thin, oily and overall a little lacking. The peanuts make the beer bitter and hard to drink. I didn't know exactly what to expect with this one but was somehow disappointed."
"Uber Goober is an interesting idea, but I think they flat out used too many peanuts for my particular tastes. I love the stuff when it's used in PB&J, as the Soft Parade cuts the peanut characteristics down to a dull roar and makes the stuff much more enjoyable for me. By itself though? No thanks."
"Overall, this is a decent beer, and well worth the experience. Though I'm not sure if this is a beer that I would keep on hand (would not recommend more than one at a time), it WOULD be quite fun to have at a tasting, and a good example of a strong oatmeal stout."
"Picked up a bottle over Xmas when I was in the Detroit area. This one's truly black, only the faintest of brown edges appears when you really squint. A dense, mocha head appeared during the pour and refused to go away, even after the glass was empty. Chunky lacing, almost streaky, covered the glass. Nice aroma. You can smell the peanuts for sure, pleasant roast, earthy and sweet with a bit of fruit, faint licorice and cherry. Now this is a sweet stout! Lots of lactose and malt, roast, chocolate, nuts, raisins, and a bit of berry sourness in the finish. Bitterness was present throughout, but was fairly restrained. The peanuts are there, but aren't overpowering. Medium bodied with average carbonation, pretty smooth and silky. For such a sweet beer, this didn't feel unbalanced at all. Just enough bitterness and a fruity tartness kept it all in check. Good stuff."
"(D)- Certainly an interesting idea for a stout. Most of it works well together, however, it does get a little disjointed. Sometimes it doesnt quite know what to taste like. Its sometimes boozy, or its really bitter, or its creamy. Certainly dynamic & unpredictable in character, but not necessarily what I would look for in a stout. Good, but it has it quirks. Not very drinkable either due to its ""moody"" character."
"It is apparent that real peanuts were used. There is a big difference between real, whole peanuts and fake, sweetened, oily peanut butter. Unfortunately the drinkability was slightly low for me but that isnt to say this beer shouldnt be tried. The uniqueness alone is worth everything."
"Poured a beautiful silky black with a 6-inch dense tan-colored creamy head that settled ever so slowly. The nose suggests dark roast and sour notes with a strong hint of peanuts and oatmeal cookies. If I had tasted this blind, I would have suggested it was a medium-bodied farm-house ale with a snappy finish. This is tasty and fun; Unexpected but delicious. Very well-developed Belgian lace forms and stays put. The stout lingers with definite peanut, oatmeal and chocolate notes. Excellent at cellar temperature. Chilling further would restrain the expressive nature of this stout. Shorts Brewing is brewing some interesting beer. Must get back to the store to see what else they have made . . ."
"D: Perhaps I'm simply a victim of the ""interesting"" factor, but I found this beer to be very enjoyable. I really love peanut butter and while it wasn't as ""peanut-buttery"" as I would have liked, it still was a nice beer."
"Overall Uber Goober was for me a unique brew. I really liked the aroma of this beer. Glad to have tried it, wonder if some time in the bottle would smooth things out and integrate the flavors a little better. The combo of roasted malt, coffee flavors just didn't go well with the tart finish on this beer for me. Really fun beer to try, high points on creativity, but not a beer I would want to drink too often."
"Overall, a very interesting beer. I loved the peanuts and I can't wait for the pb & j. Pretty drinkable, but I don't know why the label says it is imperial at the abv it has. I am really glad I got to try this one. However, I wish the sourness didn't affect it so much."
"D: Another great new Short's brew. We actually preferred P,B,&J because of the presence of the J but this was excellent in its' own right!"
"Drinkability is nice. This isn't a hokey flavored beer as I feared. It's a great shot at a unique flavor profile and Shorts should be proud of this and their other new offerings."
"Pours a dark brown color but is completely black in the tulip glass with a small head and no lacing. Roasty aromas of blackened malt, some chocolate and just a hint of peanuts. Flavor is very interesting. Tastes roasty at first, light coffee, caramel, and toast, turns to roasted peanuts in the middle, which I must say is perfectly integrated into the beer without becoming too cloying, and a smooth chocolaty finish. Very interesting stuff. Medium full bodied, light carbonation, but who knows, that could be from the bottle freezing and thawing. A good stout, and using peanuts gave it an interesting twist."
"Overall another good beer from Short's - very unique and well executed as expected from this great brewery. Not my favorite beer from them but I certainly hope that they continue bottling it into the future."
" I drank one of these on two separate occasions. Each time I felt this beer had a higher ABV than 6.5. I called shorts and the girl on the phone said the 2009 batch is 8.7 ABV."
"D-It drinks really well, especially considering the 9% ABV. The booze is certainly masked by the peanuts and this makes for a really great imperial stout."
"D: A unique beer to say the least and I think I could only enjoy one in a sitting but I really enjoyed it and cant wait to try the PB&J"
"It's chewy, moderately carbonated, and a pure pleasure to drink."
"Dark chocolate brown body. Small, bubbly, dark sandy head. Some lacing. Nose is an intriguing mix of chocolate syrup, dark fruits, roasted coffee, and peanut butter. They all mix together very nicely, which isn't that surprising. Roasted malts and peanut butter flavors up front. Light roasted coffee mixes in, along with a flourish of sweetish dark fruits. Slightly medicinal/boozy twang as well. Roasted finish with lingering dark fruits and hints of the dark chocolate/peanut butter combo. Medium-full body with a slightly oily feel. The only peanut beer I've ever had that actually showed some peanut butter on the nose and the palate. Nicely done!"
"I don't know about this one. I've had two bottles of it and I just can't like it and I can't pick up the other flavors and aromas others are picking up. I don't know if maybe my bottles are bad but I'll keep trying it and if it gets any better I'll be sure to update my review."
"Mouthfeel is silky and standard for an oatmeal stout. Low carbonation and a tad chewy. Another winner from Short's, but I was slightly disappointed in this one."
"D: This is actually pretty relaxing and drinkable. The recipe could use a bit of tweaking, but who else would even think to make a peanut-based Oatmeal Stout? If it was just a touch sweeter I'd like it more, I think."
"It's funny, these limited edition Short's releases are going to get at least B+'s across the board, but so far are unimpressive."
"D: A must have for any fan of both peanuts and stouts. A one of a kind brew that is both tasty and well produced. Worth seeking out."
"D - I prefer Mystery and Cup A Joe to this one....not bad."
"Very interesting beer in that Short's really did incorporate a peanut butter flavor and aroma, but the booziness and charred malt flavors keep it from being outstanding for me."
"Overall, an interesting beer because of the peanut flavor."
"D: With the smooth mouthfeel this one goes down easy. Not really much alcohol for an 'Imperial Oatmeal Stout' as the bottle claims, but what alcohol there is, is well well hidden."
"Short's really did a nice job with Uber Goober, it comes across as advertised. I have been very impressed with all three of the special stouts that Short's has just brought out: Mystery, Cup a Joe and this one."
"Cheers..."
"This is a solid and creative brew by Short's. Pick one up if you have the chance."
"drinkability is good. pretty well balanced, with just a little alcohol warmth showing through. i like the extra depth from the peanut and chocolate characters. good stuff!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, goes down pretty smooth. Even though sweet it isn't overly sweet. Thanks a ton Derek!"
"D-Quite nice and certainly unique. Would have liked more of a fresh peanut quality but the dry roasted flavour works better with the malts. A very interesting and well done brew."
"Poured a dark black color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of roast, some lighter oatiness, nutty, chocolate, and smokey. Peanuts. Tastes of roast, chocolate, oats, and nutty. I like the way the peanuts were done and presented 'themselves' in this beer."
"This is a one of a kind original. I would encourage anyone to give this beer a try -- it's definitely worth it!"
