"Deep brown almost black color with deep reddish brown head. Warm malty aroma. Bready, slight raisin/dry fruit notes, toffee flavor, coffee notes and  malty as temperature gets warmer. Slight hoppy bitterness lingers a bit in finish. Little to no lacing on glass."

"A little light in the body for an oatmeal and almost nothing in the nose, I nonetheless like this beer for its long-distance drinkability."
""
"o: didn't enjoy this beer, though there's nothing offensive about it.  not liking the dominance of the dark fruits and the lack of chocolatey flavours.  the roast presence borders burnt, too.  not sure how to decipher the code, but since it is ""2014", maybe a fresher bottle would be better?"
""
"Great taste, caramel, oats the right amount of sweetness , smooth and creamy. Easy drinking, I will have more."

"Solar powered brewery!   How cool!"
""
""

"Overall a very high quality product that I will be drinking again."

"O - a strong showing with lots of character. More flavor from the malts and yeast and not just hops like many brews in that area. 4.5"

"This is a delicious oatmeal stout! Kinda low ABV but is a very well made beer! Chocolate, rolled oats, roasted malt.. Just a tasty beer!"
""
""
""
""
"Very smooth Stout. Great taste and an easy drinker"
""
""
""
"Overall it is easy to drink and quite enjoyable, but lacks the rich stout depth and malty aspects that I was hoping to enjoy but should have tempered since it is an oatmeal stout. Sessionable for sure, I had 3 in one sitting and did not feel full or drunk, so this brew was fine for a social evening of watching hockey."

"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint.  Pours an inky black with a loose, 1/8th inch khaki-colored head that quickly disperses towards the edges leaving a residual sudsy slick across the center.  Nose expresses a light roasty presence, a suggestion of artificial sweetener and perhaps a hint of cherry juice.  Taste follows nose - cherry quality is more apparent; however, the flavor profile is missing the roasty/chocolately character I've come to associate with the style.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with a carbonation slightly too assertive for the style and a feint acidity most likely attributable to the cherries.  Overall, a bit lacking - not enough roast or flaked oats presence and the texture could have been creamier."
""
"One of my favorite oatmeal stouts and that's saying a lot."
""
"Good, yes, but seemed to be lacking something in taste."
"Decent oatmeal stout. Not quite as good as Founder's."

"Californians so often brew with the kind of flashy arrogance you'd think they invented the style in question. Barney Flats, however, isn't the kind of stout suffused with richness that pours out of the glass. This won't be an issue for everyone mind you, but it is for me. Pioneers though they are, apparently not every offering in Anderson Valley's lineup is noteworthy."
""
""
""
""
"For all its attributes it should taste better than a skunky guinness.  Beautiful look, smell and feel taste is lacking.  Even gave it a second taste from a different local."

"Poured on tap at The Abbey Brewing Co in Miami."
""
"Very nice oatmeal stout, bready and toasty dark malts, aroma is fantastic. Body is creamy and full with a great complex character, quite dry on the finish. Really enjoyed this."
"Overall: not much to say here, but in this case it's a good thing - super easy drinking, simple clean & pure flavours, doesn't get tired; a great late night sipper"
""
"Better than expected. I would recommend."

"on a side note, if you read the bros reviews, both of them mentioned the price...funny how in 01-02 $9.99/6 was a premium price tag, now to get a 90+ stout for that price is literally stealing. avbc could put this beer in bombers and charge $10/per and people would fall all over each other to get it. is everyone aware that this beer can be had for $9-$10/6 ?? seems like a no-brainer (not to over-emphasize dollars, but...cmon)"

"Pours jet black with a light head.  The aromas I got were mostly of malts and oats, with a smooth cocoa aftertaste.  I was slightly disappointed in the aftertaste, as I expected more flavors to come through.  Anderson Valley is one of my favorite breweries...and this is definitely worth a second try down the road."

"i have a soft spot for this one, its one of the beers that got me into the style, and one i always go back to when comparing and thinking hard about an oatmeal stout. maybe its not the best one out there, in fact, it definitely isnt, but i think its one of the truest to style around thats regularly available, and its a darn fine glass of ale, a good measuring stick. slick black look, and slick roasty viscous going down. medium sized coffee colored head, with cream lighter than coffee, but rich brown and big bubbles and lasting pretty well. sweet nose, almost like a milk stout. thank the oats for that. the flavor is rich with grain character, but the oat sweetness balances bitter roasted barley and specialty dark malts and the harmony is gorgeous and continuing long into the finish. there is even a mild yeast flavor to this, which is uncommon i think is most darker, maltier american beers. its bready and unifying, clean but noticeable. full bodied but i could still happily drink a sixer, in fact i have many times. this beer really made the style for me as a younger beer drinker, and its always a fond experience enjoying one now. emotionally important for me, foundational to my palate."

"Ever o little light tries to peek through this awesome ebony color. Head is relatively normal with little or no lacing. Aroma is of bread, malt and a hint of chocolate. Taste is pure delight, with hints of oatmeal, chocolate and milky creaminess. Bitter ending does not take away from the balance of this beer. Smooth and very very drinkable"

"Absolutely stunning stout. Could not fault it at all. Perfect mouthfeel, full of flavour that opens up as it warms. Not at all tiring towards the end. Beauty in a bottle. Now my only trouble is finding more of it, was the last in the store!"

"Poured out of a 22 oz bomber into a nonic pint glass.  The beer sports a tan head the width of two fingers, which slowly dissipates to a half-finger’s width. The color is jet black—a really nice looking beer. The aroma is a bit subdued, consisting mainly of toasted malt with a hint of raisin. The taste is outstanding and smooth.  The predominant flavors are that of oats, dark chocolate, toasted malt, finishing with a slight malty sweetness. The really is a good balance of flavors.  The beer has a medium to light body with a modest amount of carbonation.  Overall, one of the better Oatmeal Stouts I’ve had."
""
""
""
""
"Poured with a solid dark khaki head that went away quick.  Solid dark dark brown color.  Smells malty and toasty.  Taste creamy smooth malty with a slight sweetness.  Overall it's a fantastic beer that I'd get again."

"super refreshing oatmeal stout. pours into a pint glass thick black. some roasty aromas coming through. flavors are roasty, a bit hoppy, a little sweet . really natural, clean, semi chewy but medium/thin thickness, a real snack in a glass. can easily drink several of these in a sitting"

"Poured out nicely with an aggressive pour. Decent ring of head. Smell is good with malty oats and sweet chocolate. The taste is pretty good. The oatmeal definitely stands out here with some milk chocolate. Mouthfeel is pretty light for a stout. If a touch thicker I would really like this beer."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 12/18/2013. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, oats, dark bread, caramel, light coffee, light herbal, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and oat notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, dark bread, toast, oats, caramel, light coffee, light herbal, and roasted earthiness. Light herbal/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roast, dark bread, toast, oats, caramel, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, oats, and light hop flavors; with great robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy, smooth, and lightly slick/bready moutfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent oatmeal stout. All around great balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/roasted malt and oat flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"It's an excellent beer."
"Good, but not as good as I was hoping. Easy to drink if you don't mind a bitter forward stout."
""
"An example oatmeal stout. Absolutely solid."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a New Belgium goblet. The color is a deep opaque black/brown. At room temperature it makes a huge tan head; from out if the refrigerator it makes a thinner head but beautiful persistent lacing. The aroma is deep and rich--coffee, nutty, and hops. The flavor is full of coffee, a hint of chocolate, a bit smokey, and nicely balanced hops. Mouthfeel is moderately thick and a bit creamy. Overall this is an outstanding oatmeal stout, which is one of my favorite styles of ale."
""
""
"O: Super easy to drink and enjoyable, I could easily have a couple of these in a session. Lighter bodied for a stout and with a well hidden alcohol. Definitely one to grab again."
"Ranked Obsidian the highest, although this drinks more easily, with SN Stout slightly behind in third."
""
""
""
"The beer is deep, dark brown, approaching black. Atop the beer sits a thick head the color of wet sand. Really appetizing. The aroma offers chocolate, bread, roast, malt. Smells nice true to style. Very tasty. Big oatmeal character and everything is well balanced. Oatmeal cookies and chocolate with a mild sweetness. Moderate carbonation and medium bodied. Great feel. I could enjoy a few bottles of this in a sitting. In fact..."
""
""
""
"355ml bottle. Shaker glass. Dark brown color headed by beige froth leaving a thin crown on top. Caramel & roasted malt aromas, hints of oats & forest fruit to the nose. Creamy upfront. Resiny, bitter, slight acidic flavors follow. As well as some chocolate notes. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Mouthfeel is not as dense as expected from oat flakes. Dry bitter finish."

""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours pitch black with a small off white head. Smells of chocolate with a tad bit of bitterness. Tastes of chocolate with some coffee, but a little bit of coffee. Beer is carbonated well, but medium bodied and still finishes nicely. Overall, a nice beer."
""
"Poured from a can into a snifter. Pours a good mocha head. Very dark dirty oil color, but you can tell it is a thin beer which makes sense for 5.7% abv. Aroma is fairly light but notes of coffee and chocolate come through. Taste leaves more to be desired. Seems to have a bit of a cloying mouthfell also which is strange for such a light beer."

"Medium body, silky smooth. Nice carbonation."

"Love me some stouts, dry, sweet, milk, oatmeal, BA, etc. doesn't matter! If they are done right,and this one is(!), they are truly enjoyable and worthy of drinking all year long, however this time of year does seem to make them even more enjoyable. Pick this one up folks! It's a winner!"
"found this beer we dont get many anderson valley beers and at 17 doolars a six pack wow but i found a 20 dollars in the street and let me you tell it was worth it worth it this is the stuff dreams are made of creamy dark goodness great from the frist taste to the last taste thank you puts a big smile on my face just a delicious wonderful beer"

"O: This was damn tasty, with a sweetness that was at the pinnacle of the inverted parabola. I could hardly keep it around long enough to tease out its flavor. Admittedly, I probably poured this brew at warmer temperature than I typically would. Never had Stout from a can so I’m interested to see how/if that affected the flavor. In any event, I highly recommend."
""
"O - Just a wonderful oatmeal stout. Sweet roasted taste followed by coffee and hops, doesn't get much better than that. Every craft beer lover should try this beer."

"The Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout from Anderson Valley Brewing Company tasted a bit sour to me. The mouthfeel was not very full. I like almost a coating mouthfeel when I drink a stout. I poured it into a pint glass from a bottle. I have had it before and remember enjoying it. I hope that this was just a bad bottle."
""
""
"Black stout with a very thick, dark tan head.Head dissipates and settles into a thin layer of foam. Roasty, raisin bread aromas. Very creamy, flavor is dominated by roasty bitterness, hints of figs and some warming from the alcohol. Exactly what an Oatmeal stout should be: Smooth as silk, dark and roasty, dry finish with a long-lingering aftertaste of coffee."
""
""
""
"O- this is a great Oatmeal Stout. Full of flavor but not too heavy."
""
""

"Overall not sure what all the hype is about. Mediocre at best."
""
"O: Oh yeah, now this is the stuff. It's not perfect, but it's damn enjoyable - it would be in the 4+ range if it weren't so thin or overly cola-flavored. I would definitely buy this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours black with a 1 1/2 finger khaki head. Nice aroma filled with coffee, chocolate, and dark fruits. Roasted coffee is the main note. The taste starts off with chocolate in the forefront, then hints of vanilla and coffee start to arrive. It's all a very smooth experience, one of the smoothest stouts I've ever had. On top of that it's very session able and nicely priced as well."

"O: One of my favorite go to beers. I would rank this beer up there with Sam Smith's Oatmeal stout, creamy, smooth, roasted coffee, chocolate, nice dry finish, just a great oatmeal stout. This is a beer I can't refuse to drink, a regular and definitely worth a try and worthy of being a regular for oatmeal stout lovers."

""
""
""
""
"Appearance is a dark brown to black with a half finger of tan head that dissipated quickly. The nose has mild roasted notes. The flavor profile is dry and lightly roasty with a fine bitterness on the finish that appears to come from a well-balanced combination of roasted malt and hops."
""
""
""

"O: Fantastic oatmeal stout. Definitely up there with Sam Smith's and Founder's Breakfast Stout in terms of quality ingredients and taste. Cheers!"

""
""
"Overall - This is definitely one of my top five beers. I had it for the first time on my honeymoon in late-winter in Boston, and it was the perfect beer for that occasion. I had another today and it was still as good as ever, but I feel like it is best enjoyed in the wintertime."

"Food match: Cigars and after-dinner mints."
"I make a point of buying a six pack whenever I can."

"This pours a thick coffee cola black with creamy cocoa colored foam. There’s a cola-cocoa caramel aroma on this. The flavor has a mix of caramel and cocoa with a touch of coffee and a lingering finish. There’s a slight roast and some bittering on a smooth and creamy body. This is a terrific everyday stout."
""
"Overall- Not the greatest stout in the world but still a solid brew. In many ways, it seems like a poor man's Founders Imperial Stout. Definitely worth a try but may seem a little average to many stout drinkers."

"This beer sounded great on the menu, looked great on the pour, and smelled great in the glass. But, the taste fell flat. I was expecting a rich tasting oatmeal stout and what I got was a bit disappointing. The taste was stout but almost like it was water down or missing some complexity. I'm not saying it's a bad beer, but it's not my favorite."
""

"Not overly complex but quite assertive on its flavors, specially chocolate and coffee. Very good oatmeal stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good sized gulp starts out with a velvety slightly carbonated, slightly dry/bitter mouthfeel which slowly turns into this sweet chocolaty oat flavor which finishes bouncing between the two differing flavors. This isn’t a terribly complex brew and that’s what makes it so good… Where complexity applies to the best beers, so can simplicity…"
""
""
"A well done oatmeal stout, the body was quite creamy with a tasty, mild flavor profile."
""
""
""
"Flavors of funky fruit juice mixed with burnt roasted dark malts, oats, white grapefruit rind, cream of tartar. Overall bold but not too rich in malt sweetness, flavorful but not fully tasty."
""
""
"The flavors here are complex but understated, and they would be better served by a heavier body. As is, the mouthfeel is disappointingly thin for an oatmeal stout. With that said, this remains one highly drinkable oatmeal stout, as I'd have no problem draining this in no time."
""

"O: I've had plenty of stouts before, and I'm honestly not too fond of the style. However, a friend of mine told me to give oatmeal stouts a try, and if this beer is a good example of the style, then I'll definitely be on the lookout for more. Definitely a very sessionable beer, if you're looking for complexity, then you might want to look elsewhere, but if you just want some malt/chocolatey goodness, then this is your beer."

"Unfortunately not as much chocolate and coffee as the nose lets on. The mouthfeel is a tad thing, but overall a decent Oatmeal Stout."
"Overall: Pleasant. Lacking in complexity. Palate is the strongest point. Overall a call this a very good exemplar of the Oatmeal Stout."
"O: A well balanced stout with nice oat presence. The flavors intertwine perfectly being interesting but not overwhelming making for a highly drinkable and sessionable stout. One of my cold weather staples."

"Overall: The taste is good, but it’s a bit watery for a stout…the smell is nice and the look is great, but it definitely is missing that something that would make it more desirable…it’s drinkable but not outstanding in it’s field…middle of the pack…(3/5)"

"This Oatmeal Stout pours a deep ruby hue but sits black as night in a pint glass. The head was dark brown, creamy and lasted for some time. The aroma is of malt, coffee and hints of toffee; its very fragrant and I found myself simply enjoying the scent. This stout drinks with the freshness and smoothness of the finest ales, it's flavorful and refreshing which is unusual in a stout. Very smooth and light on the stomach, I tasted a rich maltiness, subtle coffee and chocolate notes. I am so impressed with this stout and rank it amongst the very best ales I've experienced."

"What a magnificent beer!!! It pours a deep black with a nice two finger caramel colored head, some retention, and lacing left over. The nose is fairly subtle with otameal being a prominent note and also some chocolate. Taste is fairly complex. I get chocolate, cola, some coffee, molasses, malt, and some hops. Mouthfeel is nice and thick without much of an aftertaste. Really a solid offereing, although somewhat lesss bitter than Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout, which is the mother of all oatmeal stouts."

"12 ounce bottle poured into my swank Olde Hickory glass. Deep brown with nice retention and a ton of creamy tan lacing. Nose is a 1-2 punch of milk chocolate and roast; it's straightforward yet pleasingly intense and inviting. As a minor complaint, it's a touch thin at the swallow in spite of the smoothness imparted by the oatmeal. Pretty much everything else is spot on, though. A bit of milk chocolate midswallow, but this is more about darker and sharper roasted flavors, which work well with the citric hop bite. Lengthy and satisfying dry finish. This is definitely one of those ""I totally forgot how tasty this was"" brews."

"This stout is refreshingly different."
"Very good oatmeal stout, although I think it may be slightly overrated. Easily drinkable, but there are more flavorable options out there, though this one certainly isn't a bad choice by any means. Worth a shot if you like the style."

"O- A decent stout. If it is at a fair price, this is a fairly good beer to try. I would definitely want more Anderson Valley in the future. As far as stouts go, I would want just a tiny bit more out of this one. Still, not bad at all."
"Not sure if I got a bad batch of this stout! Or that's how it's suppose to be, but it had the overpowering taste of carbonated / seltzer water. At the least, it was bad enough I had to leave myself a note. Otherwise, it may have been a decent beer as it's other characteristics were OK."

Roasted malt, light coffee and chocolate aroma Flavor follows with toasted malt, coffee and chocolate. A nice, well balanced oatmeal stout. Medium bodied. Moderate intensity of flavor, but smooth, lightly creamy and tasty. A very nice stout."

"Overall a great beer! I like most stouts but this one really was better than many others. A good body, good flavor, great balance. If you're looking for a lower ABV stout this is a solid bet."

"O: Because of the mild scent, straight forward flavour and thin mouthfeel this stout is not as memorable as other oatmeal stouts I've had. It's easy to drink and nice to have as an aperitif, I just would find it lost if paired with a hardy stew or grilled meats."
""

"Growler to a pint glass. A decent, dark brown looking OS with a nice mocca head 1+ finger and a little staying power. Smell was a nice blend of chocolate, dark malts, figs and distant grains. A very nice surprise and plesant. Taste was not as pronounced and had more of the sweet, chocolate hit on the front. Again the oatmeal was burried and I wanted that to come through. Some hops on the end, but subtle. Feel was thin and a bit weak. Not a thick stout feel, but more of a brown. Decent carbonation. Overall- A nice take on the style and pretty good. Very sessionable stout which was a bonus. A little off on the oatmeal/malt taste but a solid effort. A definite must try and I will look for another-"
"overall: This is a very tastefull and nicely balanced stout. Actually one of the best i've had from a bottle. It's not as strongly defined like a Guiness, but more subtle in flavors and not as thick. Good combo of sweetness and bitters. Not as sweet and overpowering as a Fuller's. Quite a fresh and easy going stout. Well done!"
"O - Just didn't find this as a top tier stout. Maybe the canned version loses a little bit."

"price point - $2.50/single 12 oz can"
""
"This can was provided by EgadBananas. Poured into a pint glass. Pours dark brown with a tall, creamy tan head that dissipates slowly. The head retains well and leaves some lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma is roasty sweet from the malt and there are smells of coffee and chocolate as well. I can detect some oats as well. The taste follows the nose. There are flavors of dark roasted barley malt, mild bitter coffee, bitter chocolate, and some mild hops. The flavors are creamy and mildly sweet. The body is medium with a creamy mouthfeel. It is smooth and the carbonation is moderate. The drinkability is very high. Overall, this is an excellent beer. It is a very drinkable oatmeal stout that I wish was available in my area."
""
""
"Overall, this is a wonderful beer. In today's era of extreme, over-the-top beers, classics like this tend to get overlooked. It's very reminiscent of Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout. It only lacks a bit of the creaminess."
"O: A solidly made, surprisingly subtle oatmeal stout."
""
""
"The Crack & Glug caused me to wonder if I were about to indulge in a chocolate milkshake! Foam began jumping out of the lip of the CAN and I had to pour it quickly into a glass. I had a lot of deep-tan/light-brown head initially, but it finally settled into a thick finger. Color was a deep, dark-brown with limited light penetration except at the edges. Nose smelled of coffee, dark chocolate and charcoal/wood smoke. Mouthfeel was on the thin side for a stout and it had a taste like fudge - dark, rich, smoky. Finish was equally fudgy and I probably would not want more than one, being that I am self-avowed hophead."
""
""
"4.4/5.00"
"O- Once I let it warm up a bit above 60 degrees, the flavor really came through. Tried it with some Belgian dark chocolate from Trader Joes which is a good match. It has the richness and body of an imperial stout without the alcohol kick. I'll definitely have this again especially at 7.99 a six here in N CA."

"To each his own, lol."

"A very easy drinking stout, this tastes very good regardless if the beer is a cooler temp or a warmer one."

"A fairly pleasant oatmeal stout, the roundness of the body more than capable of talking me into another. The little extra sourness adds touches of a more traditional porter, deftly tempering the potential sweetness. Worthy of seeking out, this one."

"O- Definitely one of the more solid oatmeal stouts out there. I'd keep this around if available to me."

"This is a great beer. It has good body, good flavor, and great drinkability. It's definitely worth checking out."

"I was anxious to try this one, as i have enjoyed several other beers from this brewery. Poured from the can into a pint glass; looks inky black with a thick and creamy off white head of foam, almost like a nitro pour. Smells nice and roasty, exactly what i like in a stout. Taste is much the same, and the mouthfeel is pretty thick and smooth, as an oatmeal stout should be. Nothing here that knocks my socks off, but definitely not a thing wrong with it either. A really nice solid tastey ""sessionable"" stout. I can't wait to crack a few more on the golf course tomorrow. I can see this possibly becoming a go to beer for me."

"O - Pretty decent for a lowish ABV stout. Given my druthers, and without regard for the ABV, I'd rather have a Founders Breakfast Stout. I like this brew but not enough to put a case of it into regular rotation."

"(D)- A pretty solid stout. Easy drinking and a lighter example overall due to its thinner mouthfeel and mellow body."

"An excellent oatmeal stout. Really digging this right now."
"12oz can, pours near black with a tall, foamy light brown head, good retention and lacing. Aromas are milk chocolate, roasted malt, and oats. Tastes are chocolate, oat, char, cream, finishes somewhat dry and slightly roasted bitterness with faint pine in the background from the hops. Mouth-feel is super creamy and smooth, but could be a tad fuller. Overall, great take on the style!"

""
""
""

""

"OVERALL: Nice upfront flavours and although it wasn't weak, it wasn't nearly rich enough, and there was something synthetic in the way that the aftertaste vanished after a couple of minutes. I like a stout to keep busy in my mouth long after finishing the drink."
""
""
""
""
"What a coincidence - I had read fantastic things about this beer and then there it was at the bar unexpectedly that night. It was a bit of a letdown. I think it's a well done beer, very balanced, but it felt restrained almost in that English way of not wanting to be too much of anything. In a way I give it points for English restraint despite its American pedigree, but in another way I really wanted it to open up and give me more. It was also less silky than I was expecting from an oatmeal. I'd certainly drink it again but would pass it over for something with more oomph."
"O: A very solid oa meal stout. Nice toasted oats and dark chocolate made for a refreshing treat."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Excellent, so drinkiable and enjoyable. Perfect balance of sweet, bitter and roasted. The price is insane affordable, which only adds to it. World class, must find more!"
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a black color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of oats, roasted malts. Taste is good, coffee, smoke, oats, malts, no real sweetness present. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall this is a quality beer worth seeking out."
"It seems to be leaving a nice lace on the side of my hotel plastic cup. This is a decent stout in a can and I would buy it again. I am glad that I have one more of these on my road trip."
"Medium bodied with average carbonation. Has a bittersweet aftertaste. Not as smooth as I would expect an Oatmeal Stout to be. Overall a pretty good beer, but there are better Oatmeal Stouts in my opinion."
"A nice Oatmeal stout overall that is rich and roasty with plenty of character to treat the senses."
""
""
""
""
"Deep black, with a thick dark tan head, quickly receeding to leave pretty srong lace. Aroma is lightly chocolate, some roasted malt (coffee, a little caramel), and some decent floral hops tacked on for good measure. Flavor is sweet, chocolate, some caramel, in the middle some roasted coffee, and ends with a good hoppiness. Body is medium, slightly creamy mouthfeel."
""

"O - The best brew at Anderson Valley. An amazing Oatmeal Stout and can't wait to share it with my dad on the east coast."
"Overall, this is an excellent Oatmeal stout. The flavor is complex and well rounded. The beer is smooth and drinks well."
"Deep dark basically opaque color with a big frothing tan head. Aroma has dark chocolate notes, soft oatmeal grains, hints of fresh baked cookie dough and a hint of astringent coffee. Flavor is grade A, possibly the best hands down oatmeal stout in the country, rich balanced semi sweet dark chocolate, hints of coffee from the dark roasted malts. Nice grains, herbal hops blanced things out, a hint of herbal mint things are cohesively tasting great in this glass. Mouthfeel has a creamy smooth texture, with big medium to full body with even smooth carbonation levels. Drinkability overall kicks ass, instant classic in a can as fresh as it gets, one can costs $1.79 find me a case, this is excellent stuff."
"Overall I liked this beer and I thought it was a pretty good Oatmeal Stout, it had almost everything that I look for in a good Oatmeal Stout, this beer was very straightforward and to the point. It had good drinkability, I went through my can faster then expected and if I hand another one I think I would drink it, this would make a good sessionable beer for the winter time. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and the mouthfeel they were both very good. What I liked least about this beer was the higher amount of sweetness, if that was toned down a little this be would pretty much be perfect. I would for sure buy this again when looking for a good priced and sessionable Oatmeal Stout, and I recommend in to anyone who enjoys the style. This brewery is starting to impress me, this was the second really good beer that I have had from them and I have high hopes for their IPA that I have in the fridge, they really did a great job at making a classic Oatmeal Stout that I will for sure be revisiting."

"Incredibly smooth mouthfeel as well, lower carbonation levels allowed me to enjoy the beer for what it was, and the lighter body was also surprising. I love this beer overall."
"It kind of reminded me of Guinness on steroids. I know this isn't an Irish Dry Stout, but at times it really reminded me of one. Either way, this is a pretty enjoyable stout."
"Overall pretty good, nothing wrong, but doesn't really stand out much from other typical oatmeal stouts. Very drinkable, done well, tasty, I could easily drink a bunch of these in the cooler ""winter"" nights or Saturday afternoon."
"Pours an opaque black with a 1 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a small cap. Foamy broken rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, toasted oats, and some slight cocoa aromas. Taste is of dark roasted malt, toasted oats, and some coffee bean and cocoa flavors on the finish. There is a mild roasty bitterness that quickly fades after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a light carbonation and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a solid oatmeal stout and one of my favorite Anderson Valley beers."
"O/D-This bomber was a great price at $4.25. Not a crazy brew but a solid Oatmeal Stout. Worth the price of admission. Could see myself buying this again."

"Could use more carbonation. And a thicker body."
"Wow, tremendous balance here. Full flavors and extremely easy drinking. Top notch stout here.... would be even better if the ABV was a bit higher. Great though none the less."
"O: It makes me happy to drink and enjoy a good beer, and this one certainly fits the bill. It’s well-balanced, with an ABV that allows you to enjoy a few of these bad boys, as Guy Fieri might say. I’m ready for another, but I only bought one; lesson learned."

"Bahl hornin' since 1987! Damn right, thats my birthyear... twas meant to be. Can of this (near 50 F) oat'd stout pours out oil black (suprise!). Creamy brown khaki head that leaving chunks of lacing webbed around the glass. Strong yet sweet oatmeal wafts out of the glass along with dark chocolates & a lactose quality. Slightly nutty in the nose as well. Drinks smooth, wow! First thing that hits is the subtle, yet defined oatmeal quality. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth & carbonation on point. Body is moderate (6/10) & is my only complaint about the brew, just want a thicker feel is all."

"*Upadate- Tasted a sample from a can at a tasting at my local liquor store last night that came fresh straight from the brewery. Definitely tasted significantly sweeter and a lot different. I definitely liked the taste from the can a lot better, definitely more of what they were going for. I increased my tasting rating because of this. Bottle was more of a leathry wine taste, where as the can had sweeter, caramel taste. Definitely get it from the can if you can."

"I wrote a review for this years ago and it's disappeared. It was one of my first high end oatmeal stouts and set the standard. Served at a good temperature and I poured a small to medium sized tan head that settled to a light cover that lasted all the way down and some lace. Color is an opaque black brown. Aroma is malt, roast, cocoa, hint vanilla. Flavor's like nose with just right carbonic tang and some bitterness that all balance just right. Body is full and carbonation is exactly right. Finish is like flavor that slowly taper over a while. World class beer."

"O: above average for an oatmeal. Nice beer."

"Deep oily color with a tall, frothy, tan head. There is a luscious aroma of caramel, chocolate and malts. The flavor follows the aroma nicely- the roasted grains taste nice and rich. There is a subtle undertone of floral hops as well. Oats and chocolate really come out in the finish. The mouth feel is not nearly as thick as one might expect - a few points off for that in my book. Maybe Imperials have me spoiled... At any rate this is an excellent stout overall."

"Overall. Nice oatmeal stout here. Ranks up there with the better ones I've tried in a style I love."
"Poured into a standard pint glass. The beer is a rich chocolate black, like coffee. The fluffy, dark tan head sits on top beautifully for a while, then dissipates to a thin film of bubbles. decent sticky lacing. This beer tastes good, real good. It starts with bitter chocolate and ends with a smooth burnt malt flavor, a slightly dry finish. The mouthfeel is good, albeit on the lighter side. It's very drinkable. Overall, a really good stout. I'm impressed. I have a few other favorite oatmeal stouts I refer, but this one is high on the list."
"O – Decent, would I buy this again? I don’t think so, but I would recommend it to anyone looking to get into bigger stouts from say a Guinness."
"The flavors are quite excellent. A blend of dark chocolate, oatmeal, drip coffee and a mild fruitiness, this is a very nicely balanced beer. The fruit character tastes yeast-derived. There's a mild sweetness, rather sugary on the mid-palate, that seems strange. Drying on the finish with a blend of robust roasty bitterness, a blend of oatmeal and coffee, this beer is medium-light in body and moderately carbonated. Not the slickest oatmeal stout I've had, I find the carbonation a little higher than it needs to be, lending a mild acidity to the finish. Still, this is an excellent beer, and one that I will attempt to drink more often."
"Slainte"
"Back to not how to review this beer. I want more coffee and chocolate flavors in a beer. The hop flavor here dominates, but is squelched before it really gets bitter. Instead it just starts to get a bit sour/citrus and then it does before the oatmeal notes come in."
"Overall, I really like this beer. We had our first solidly cold day this fall and I really enjoyed this bomber this evening. Hit the spot."
"WOW. Obsidian in color and a nice cloudy head. Overlapping lacing as it creeps down my glass. The taste is earthy with no hint of burnt grain as is common with some stouts. Sweet, chewy, with an evocation of sweaty love while driving on the interstate. Smooth and satisfying. One of my favorites."
"Happy International Stout Day!"
"O: Good beer. I enjoyed this a lot. Creamy beer, full bodied with a nice thickness, great smell and wonderful taste."
"Smooth and rich...this is a medium to full-bodied brew that is best had last in a drinking session due to the ""meal in a glass"" nature of it. I would have it again."
"Overall Drinkability - Very plain. Characters are very mild and almost imperceptible. No off characters though."
"I think a blind tasting is in order for this and a couple of other highly-rated stouts to see how it really stands up. I don't really care much for this. The Julian dating is 10336 so that's late 2010, in the liquor store cooler, shouldn't be off too much."
"O: This is an incredibly drinkable stout. It's so rich and delicious but not overpowering in any sense."
"Pours a rich dark brown with moderate cap of creamy khaki froth. Scent leads with notes of moderate roast, backed by bitter cocoa, lightly roasted and ground coffee and hints of dark fruit, light earthyness. Taste follows suit with no one component being the star here, moderate roast, bitter chocolate stronger than other flavors, but not over the top. Medium bodied, lightly earthy and grainy but smooth. A very nice traditional style stout which doesn't overdo any particular component and thus becomes highly drinkable."
"Revisiting this beer to see how my perception of it has changed (if at all). It pours a seemingly straight onyx topped by over a finger of light brown foam. The nose comprises toasted biscuit, light roasted malts, toffee, toasted oats, and a few sprinkles of cocoa for good measure. The taste brings in more of the same, with the cocoa playing a stronger role, the roast darkening, and some light coffee coming into the mix as well. The body is a light-feeling medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth, creamy feel. It seems a bit light and thin, but the creaminess (present in every AV beer I've had thus far) makes up for it, and then some. Overall, a very nice oatmeal stout. The thinness holds it back some, but it remains an enjoyable drink."
"Overall - I would recommend this for anyone who likes a good drinkable stout, or someone who wanted to get a taste of stouts but might be intimidated by a darker beer."
"Not a bad beer. I would like to try this again sober as I was five to six good craft beers into the night when I rated this."
"O: a very good beer, can drink more than just one with the lower abv. Great balance of flavors all around"
"Last beer for this Sunday eveing....and its a good one....Anderson Valley Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout is a very good. The appearance is everything you want in a stout....dark...opaque with tan head...little thin, but lacing. The smell is heavy malt with molassis base. The taste is nice subtlies of very light roast, black licorice, and hop balance. The mouthfeel os this beer is very good for a stout....there is enough body to make it feel like your drinking a stout! The ABV is not out of control so you can drink more than one...and everything comes off the pallet clean so there is no major aftertaste. Overall....this is a great drinking stout!!!"
"Overall - Definitely the best oatmeal stout and perhaps the best stout of any kind I've sampled to date."
"Overall this as about as good as oatmeal stouts get. If you are looking for an easy drinking, non-filling, great tasting stout that you could drink several of in one setting, this is the answer."
"Reviewed from notes. Smell of sour malt & coffee from bottle poured into dimpled mug. Pours a nice dark cola/coffee blackness with a head that dissipates quickly. I get a smell of sour dough bread as well before sipping the full rich body that finishes clean w/a coffee malt finish. A very good example of the style an excellent six for the price, readily found and not too thick n heavy to enjoy as a session. Definitely gotta try more from Anderson Valley Brewing as this is one of my favorite oatmeal stouts."
"o- very good, great taste for a easily available to get stout. never thought about trying until I recieved in a trade. Will definitely buy more of this beer."
"O - Overall, this was my first oatmeal stout, and I'd have to say it's a different animal than the stouts I'm used to. This is milder and smoother. This one would make a great choice on a cold night, or as a dessert/nightcap."
"O: Decent, drinkable stout."
"D - More than the sum of its parts... Quite quaffable... I found myself taking good sized gulp after good sized gulp... The 5.7% ABV does pack a surprising punch... Solid beer all the way around..."
"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a standard pint glass. Great head, pitch black, nice stout smell. I found this beer to be a touch watery compared to other oatmeal stouts (specifically B.O.R.I.S.), but overall a nice stout that convinced me to try other beers from Anderson Valley Brewery."
"Overall: After considering the way others have rated this one, I'm shocked. Not sure if my bottle sat on the shelf too long, or if something was up with this batch. It wasn't a drainpour, but the flavor and mouthfeel were definitely a let-down relative to my expectations. I'd give it another chance in the future, though, to give it a fair shake."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium. Easy drinking, and if you like dark beer, this is a good one. It's not harsh bitterness. it's well balanced and flavoursome."
"Overall – I'm not a huge stout fan but I did really enjoy this one. The chocolate taste was pleasant and the beer was gone in a flash. I'd buy this beer again."
"Not completely satysfating, even in the aftertaste."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, an opaque brownish black, with less than a finger of light brown head. Aroma of roasty malts, dark chocolate, and some mild fruit tones. Taste: roasty malt base infused with chocolate, some cocoa bitterness, and a penetrating fruity sweetness. Heavy-medium bodied, creamy from the oatmeal, but not enough to be considered full-bodied. Quite drinkable."
" This came from a Half Time beer of the Month selection"
"Bottle review dated 12/19/2008. I am not a big fan of things called ""Barney""-anything after having disturbing images seared into my head thanks to a goofy, ambiguously gay purple dinosaur...and the cops, who people also call ""Barney"" sometimes. This Barney was a pleasant surprise, however. Dark brown in color with a one finger tan head. Nice chocolatey aroma. Roasted malts, coffee/chocolate flavors, oaty creaminess. Full mouthfeel. I approve of this Barney, but strongly disapprove of the others."
"O/D: I'm torn with this rating, it's super easy to drink, and has a fairly low ABV. The taste is decent, but can be too hoppy for those looking for a sweeter, maltier stout. Doesn't have the style characteristics I'm used to, but it is pleasing."
"Overall: Not an impressive oatmeal stout but this would make a good anyday beer, I might buy it again sometime."
"Overall: Really good oatmeal stout all the flavors work perfectly together and create a great balance and drinkability"
"Beer is medium in body with a nice, mild malt and oat presence with a finish of mild to moderate bitterness. The overall beer is nice, good flavors, well rounded. I'd have this beer again."
"O-Very nice brew here, balanced and smooth with lots of oatmeal flavor...very drinkable...dessert like beer i would say..."
"The feel is great. Nice and creamy with a nice full body. Overal a great oatmeal stout. Seems to hit the mark on accounts that an oatmeal stout should"
"Overall, this is a very good oatmeal stout, finely balanced and silky smooth, and leaving you wanting another mouthful."
"Overall: Flavorwise, I say it beats Sam Smith. Feelwise, I say Smith has the edge. But either way, these are good oatmeal stouts. Would probably drink again."
"I haven't had many oatmeal stouts and this is not one of my favorite styles - but I imagine this might be about as good as it gets in this category."
"O-I'm not the biggest fan of Anderson Valley in general, but this is impressive. A very nice oatmeal stout."
"Very good example of the style. You won't be overwhelmed with oats, but they're certainly there. Delightful round, balanced flavor."
"Grassy hops, dry oats, and a tiny dab of chocolate that rounds off with a light - almost empty - sweet, soymilk foam finish. The creamy finish seems like it’s trying to make up for its thinner, porter-esque mouthfeel. Too much hops for my liking. I prefer a maltier, more burnt stout."
"M"
"This stout poured out as a deep brownish black color. The head was fluffy and tan. The lacing was decent for most of the time drinking this beer. The smell of the beer has some really nice roasted malt aromas blended with some interesting oats on the nose. The taste of the been is smooth and had a nice earthy roasted flavor to it. The mouthfeel was lighter than I expected. Overall this beer was pretty good. I can't say I'd go out of my way to have it again but I did enjoy it."
"O - Not a huge amount of complexity to this one, nothing really stands out. Overall pretty average"
"This brew pours out a deep black with a finger's worth of head that retains quite nicely. The aroma is also good, if unremarkable. It's the whole chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts thing that's all over the place. The taste is very nice though. The oatmeal comes in nicely, along with some milk chocolate, caramel malts, and roasted coffee. There's also a touch of nuttiness on the finish. It's nothing unique, but refined to perfection. The mouthfeel is nice, it's got a nice amount of body and drinks very easily. The drinkability is very good. Overall, a great oatmeal stout that's always a solid choice."
"Overall - This is damn good stuff. Really drinkable. It lost some points due to the body being so light, but it makes up for it in taste and smell. Buy on sight."
"Pours a viscous dark brown with 1 and half fingers of head. I smell grains and wet cardboard. Smells dusty and metallic. Taste started off metallic at first. I then get a light flavor of coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Finish is mostly coffee with a little bit of hops. Not that bitter. The flavor seems pretty fleeting. The mouthfeel is solidly medium. A little silky, not quite creamy. Not too impressed here. I know this beer is only 5.7% but the flavors aren't really strong enough to keep me interested"
"O - It is a solid beer that just didn't quite live up to the hype. I'd reach for a Sam Smith's if given a choice."
"O: Not the most mind blowing oatmeal stout but a solid brew from a brewery that I can always rely on for a good beer any day of the week."
"Barney Flats pours a typical stout black. The tan foam topping the beer is a shade or two lighter than normal, and comes up to a little bit over 3 fingers in height. It fades a little on the quick side, and aside from a solid ring at the head's apex. The beer almost smells sweet like a milk stout. There's some dark chocolate and some citrusy hops, it almost smalls like a chocolate covered orange peel. The aroma is a touch weak overall though. The flavor has the same general structure as the nose, but it's more bitter dark chocolate and a bit less citrusy. The mouthfeel is a bit of a letdown, given that it's one of the things I look forward to most in a good oatmeal stout. The carbonation is spot on understated. The body though is neither full and rich, nor silky smooth enough to compete with top notch oatmeal stout. All in all I enjoyed my glass of Barney Flats, but given the choice I don't think I'd ever grab this over other beers like Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout or Velvet Merlin."
"This one always impresses... and I for some reason always forget. One of the best deals in a six-pack, when fresh, it's one of the more impressive, hoppy oatmeal stouts."
"D ~ Would love to buy this again. Great beer great value. Might replace Sam Smith as my favorite Stout."
"T: The balance here is pretty well done. As the smell would suggest, the beer isn't very strong, but it has a nice flavor profile to offer. Sweet with a hint of chocolate upfront and then a slightly creamy middle with a lot of roasted oat flavor. Finish has some roasted malts, coffee and a slight hint of hops. The mouthfeel felt way thin for me though. With a thicker mouthfeel, the beer would easily get an A."
"D - Good drink; good mouthfeel & flavor"
"O - The best stout I have ever had. So well balanced it doesn't even seem like a stout, and is the type of beer that people who find other stouts too strong could easily get into. World class."
"Overall a well balanced beer with all around very good characteristics though I wouldn't call it world class. The Bros say it's world class but they haven't review in about 10 years. Rogue is better. At $1.99 it is an awesome value."
"Pours solid black with a brown head that starts off thumbs width in thickness and dwindles down from there, leaving a slight head on around the edges and in batches across the rest of the surface. A rich and sweet oaty aroma from the malts partnered with a supporting chocolate. Absolutely beautiful. Overall, I'd say this falls into the sweeter side of oatmeal stouts. Starts off sweet with some cocoa and coffee flavor, middle you get the characteristic oaty flavor, and finishes off with a great roastiness. A wonderful moutfeel to this; velvet, creamy, and medium bodied. Simply a great oatmeal stout, my biggest complaint is that it isn't more readily available here in Denver. This should be a staple in every liquor store."
"A 'must-try' oatmeal stout, very highly recommended."
"This fell in between the crabtree and breckenridge on side by side. It had a little more going on than the breckenridge. light bitter nut taste (if you like that i think youll enjoy this beer). sweet toasty oatmeal registers strong. not as big bodied as i would like an oatmeal stout. this couldnt be the only thing youre having for breakfast."
"Pours jet black with a tan like head. In the aroma, sweet oatmeal and a coffee roastiness. In the taste, sweet oatmeal, roasted malt and a nice coffee note under it all. A small bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry to sweet coffee presence in the aftertaste. A nice roast and sweet oatmeal with a nice mellow coffee flavor, a bit thin, but great flavor."
"O: This is an easy drinking stout because it’s relatively light-bodied for the style and doesn’t have that much alcohol content."
"O - I love how this beer is so creamy and smooth. The beer has just the right body to where it's thick, yet still easy to drink. I would definitely like to drink this beer again."
"It's a nice stout for those days you just don't want to have one of the high ABV stouts."
"O: Very nice oatmeal stout. Looks good, tastes good, drinks good. Recommended."
"My Favorite oatmeal stout so far"
"Drink and overall: Very enjoyable Stout. First brew from Anderson Valley and it was very nice. Not too complex, bit lots of flavor and a good session stout."
"Overall, good session Oatmeal stout. Admitedly, I've had this out of the bottle before, and it didnt impress me that much, but the tap version surprised me quite a bit. Based on the disparity in my experience from the bottle and this, maybe it was a freshness thing or maybe it was the cold day weather for So Cal (we just came from the snow) but this was really good."
"I have never had Anderson Valley before and thought I'd give the oatmeal stout a shot since I don't have much experience with oatmeal stouts and wanted to try another one(only had probably 1 other) and I'm not that impressed. It's ok, sometimes I think I'm drinking a guinness which is fine since I like Guinness but I was looking for more flavor. I was expecting a huge oatmeal push like Founders Breakfast Stout but I shouldn't be comparing this to founders BS. I guess Oatmeal Stouts aren't my kind of style, maybe I should try more oatmeal stouts before I make any judgments but now I'll stick with my imperial and russian stouts."
"Overall: I enjoyed this beer. One of the better stouts available to me. Will buy again."
"12 oz into a pint glass. Deep black color. They nailed it. Totally opaque. Excellent. Big frothy dark head. The oatmeal comes through in the nose and it's a rush of malt depth on the tongue, and quite bitter too. Awesome. I'm highly impressed that the oatmeal comes through both so strongly and so cleanly. That characteristic is really massive in the beer. This one's a winner and highly recommended if you like stouts that can be made into session brews. I could drink this all day in the winter especially. Ah, the joys of breakfast."
"D- Very easy to drink, and the taste was great."
"D - Very smooth; an excellent and perfect drink."
"Few stouts I have had surpass Barney Flats in balancing drinkability with a good, solid stout flavor. The ratio of flavor to ABV is very good, allowing it to be more of a session beer than most stouts. Also check out their IPA if you have a chance. Overall AV makes good stuff."
"I could have another, and at less than 6% ABV, why not?"
"D- Overall a very enjoyable beer. Many others in this price range are better, but nice to grab for a change"
"Taste-Coffee, chocolate, dark roasted malt, Smooth and creamy with a pleasant hop note that adds balance. Very nice. A killer match with a slice of carrot cake."
"Overall pretty good, but not the best oatmeal stout. Nice flavor but just not very smooth like expected."
"D- Overall a pretty easy drinking beer with a nice flavor. Nothing that stands out but no real flaws either."
"This is an immensely drinkable beer. I'd gladly buy a case of this."
"When the trend right now is to make all stouts monster brews packed with high ABV and intense flavors, Barney Flats surprises, and makes a clear win, by managing to be both subtle and complex. It's definitely a beer to sip and relax to, at a great price."
"Black in body with coffee head that sticks around. Smells of slight prunes, coffee, slight chocolate, and grains. Tastes of chocolate, tang, cola, slight grains, and finishes with grapes and prunes. Medium bodied with light carbonation. A tangy, oatmeal stout that probably does better for breakfast than for a nightcap."
"Notes: Wow! It's been a long time since I had this beer. One of the best oatmeal stouts I have ever tried. Full-bodied, complex, and at the same time very drinkable. A session stout if I ever had one. I'm blown away by it."
"Taste is roasted with a chocolate and coffee taste. The oatmeal adds a grainy and fatty taste which contributes to the body and mouthfeel. The carbonation is light and fits the style. As this is an American style stout, it has little yeast character. I miss some fruity flavors."
"Mouthfeel was nice and crisp for a stout, and left me wanting to drink more, which was easy due to the awesome drinkability. Solid oatmeal stout in my opinion, and better than I was expecting."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with a creamy amount of carbonation."
"Overall: A bit disappointed given the ranking this receives. Not objectionable. Just not a standout. Very middle of the road on all counts in my book. Smell and taste were just lacking. Decent enough but not something I will likely search out or add to my list of regulars."
"http://www.facebook.com/KAJIIsBeerReviews"
"Nothing wrong with this one, but I was tired of it by the end of the pint. Not something I will ever seek out again."
"Overall this is an excellent oatmeal stout for my tastes - probably my favorite as it is more of an oatmeal - sweet stout mix. mmm"
"d: a very drinkable, excellent example of the style. possibly the best stout i've had."
"Drinkability: This goes along with the mouthfeel. The light mouthfeel and the carbonation make this very drinkable; almost scary drinkable for an oatmeal stout!"
"While the light level of roastiness, the smoothly thick body, and overall emphasis on balance should garner it many fans, Barney Flats is not winning me over. Mildly roasted, far from assertive. Hops are buried, but provide a counter-punch. Not quite insipid, but definitely an entry-level stout. ""Well-attenuated"" is a much nicer way to say that."
"D - Very drinkable offering with a nice amount of depth."
"A great oatmeal stout that pours out black with a creamy tan head that has very good retention and some excellent creamy lacing. The smell is chocolate with some floral hops, but the taste is a chocolate followed by some caramel with hops trying to sneak in and than some creamy oatmeal with hints of more chocolate takes over and it melts in your mouth. The aftertaste is a very mild bitter taste of chocolate and the sweetness of oats. The mouthfeel is very creamy and smooth and feels like the beer is melting in my mouth. It has a heavenly feel to it and I will be enjoying this beer for a long time. This is a must try stout, and since it has a nice heavenly feel and taste to it we can all thank God for this great beer."
"D - Wow the only other oat stout that I had that was this enjoyable was Samuel smiths and this one seems more balanced and creamy. I would suggest a six pack if you can find it considering how great it is I would have at least a few a sitting. Solid brew!"
"Pours deep black, with a small amount of lacing. Head dissapeared quickly. Smells sweet with tons of chocolate. Tastes medium bodies, with tons of well balanced flavor. Goes down smooth, with little to no bitterness. An excellent stout, with exceptional chocolate flavor."
"Definitely a lighter stout that allows for multiple pints in a sitting. Not overly complex but it did leave me wishing there was just a little bit more."
"Pours a very dark color, almost black with a thick foamy Light Brown head, leaving plenty of lace. Aroma is coffee, Cocoa, some dark Fruit. Flavor is a nice balance of sweeter chocolate notes and very nice hop bitterness. Body is a ""Little"" thin. There are notes of dark roasted coffee,too.There are notes of dark roasted coffee. This is very tasty stout. Balanced."
"I felt this could have been a bit more creamy, but an very good stout as it was."
"Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout is recommended for dessert but breakfast sounds more like it! I mean really, this beer would be delicious with pancakes and syrup, eggs, and bacon. If a stout for breakfast isn't up your alley (understandable), have breakfast for dinner, or try it with spicy chicken and cheese enchiladas (with an egg on top!?). The creaminess and the oatmeal will help to mellow out the spice. It would also pair really well with a blue cheese such as the Colston-Bassett Stilton that is in season for the winter. The inherent sweetness and heft of the beer will be well balanced by such a cheese. Either way, ""It's bahl hornin," which apparently means ""It's good drinkin"" in Boontling."
"d- not the best oatmeal stout i've ever had but enjoyable and goes down very easily, i just wish it was a bit more rounded out."
"Overall, a very solid oatmeal stout. I think this gives style benchmarks like Sam Smith's Oatmeal stout a run for their money. Much more flavor than I am used to in oatmeal stouts and I love it. Definitely pick this one up."
"Drinkability. You could drink all night until it catches up to you. This goes down extremely smooth!"
"Barney Flat's is an enjoyable Oatmeal Stout. It's not overly complex, but sometimes that's a good thing. ~"
"Overall this is a great tasting beer, it just lacks the body I'm looking for in an oatmeal stout. Everything else receives great marks in my book. I am very willing to try other beers from this brewery. Great Beer Anderson Valley Brewing!!"
"Overall, not bad. This is a fairly good stout. I could see myself drinking a few of these. I would love to get the chance to try it on tap."
"OVERALL: A relatively flavorful oatmeal stout with a decent look and feel. A bolder nose and a bit of lacing would help this one in the ratings, but nevertheless, this one is worth checking out if you're a fan of the style."
"Thick, dense tan head. Dark brown color with faint mahogany highlights on the edge of the glass. Big malty aroma with roasted and chocolate notes. Very sweet roasted body. Mild carbonation. Flavor also has some caramel with the smooth malty sweetness; not much bitterness to this one, would guess that would be th oatmeal at work. mild to moderate dryness in the finish. Overall flavor is mild, but an easy drinker. Wife likes it so I would recommend it for those who don't like a super intense stout that would weigh on the side being very coffee or roasted influenced."
"If you like Oatmeal Stouts, buy this, you will NOT regret it. A clerk at Pancho's Liquor Town in OKC turned me onto this and I cannot let it go....an excellent stout."
"I will definitely purchase this again soon!"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid stout worth drinking for a long time if you're in the mood for the style."
"D: Nice flavorful session beer around the fire, replace your friends Guinness with this, not as bitter and goes down smoother. Many porter fans will enjoy this selection too."
"D: Very flavorful and smooth. Not really filling thought feels like a really big beer."
"drinkability: very drinkable, mellow and not trying too hard to emphasize the oatmeal aspect; it is mellow enough that it could stand to have a bit higher abv."
"Drinkability- This is a very good stout. Definitely like it a lot"
"D- Great showing from Anderson Valley. Nothing beats a Sam Smith's, but this is a beer that holds it's own. I would definitely make this a go-to brunch beer to have with a late breakfast, like pancakes."
"Good oatmeal stout from a bottle. Beer itself was smooth and did not have a major kick to it like some other outmeal stouts have. Had got a sample in a Maryland beer shop for $1.29 was well worth it, would not think twice on buying a 6 or a 12 pack of the stuff."
"This here is one smooth tasting stout.The appearance is black.Smell is chocolatey.Taste is again chocolate,w/a lightly burnt taste to it.Mouthfeel is just fine while its in there.Then right the hatch it goes.MMM.That nice stout.Man I like that and the price was right to $8.99.Thank ya there Ol BArney.."
"One of the best Oatmeal stouts I've had. There was alot of love put into this beer."
"Easy drinking however fruit taste is not that overpowering but dominant."
"M/D: Medium body, very smooth. Overall a pretty good beer. Would have liked a stronger nose and a heavier hand with the oats, but easy to drink and pretty tasty."
"Yeah, mild and enjoyable enough stout. I've had more interesting oatmeal stouts though."
"D : Pretty good oatmeal stout, would make a good dessert, not over the top sweet thanks to the roastiness."
"Verdict: Great stout, but somewhat one-dimensional. Worth trying for sure, though."
"Thumbs up, try it out."
"Side note: Although this is a good beer, I feel it's a touch overpriced at ~$14/sixer; lots of other stout options out there that are as good or better for the price; this one just seems a touch steep. Good beer, though -"
"It's an extremely sessionable stout, which is a property that's often overlooked in the style. It has character to keep it interesting. It might be a little gentle and thin, genre-wise, but it's a more drinkable beer for it."
"A good stout. Nothing out of the ordinary, just an easy to drink stout. There is nothing wrong with that. Something I would recommend."
"Pours a dark black with a bit of a bit of a dark tan head. Nose brings forward a good amount of roasted malt, a tad bit of smoke, molasses, and hints of coffee. The roast really stands out in the taste, which is really enhanced by the really nice and creamy mouthfeel this brings forward. Drinks really well and is one of the best American versions of the style that I have had."
"i would buy this again."
"Pours a pitch black, with a thin tan head. Smells of cooled porridge. Taste is a hint of fresh nutmeg up front, with a sweetened chocolate milk middle, and a raw oatmeal finish. A hint of leafy hops in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is quite luscious, low, lively carbonation. Very good drinkability, I would certainly get this again."
"very good mouthfeel though not heavy at all. very easy drinking for a stout."
"Notes: Very tasty robust and hearty. Cheers."
"Seabright Brewery had a draft Oatmeal Stout that was big,beefy,intense...lunch in a mug,this,is no less but the target was different. The brewer WANTED tasty-smooth as silk-drinkable...and nailed it."
"Anderson Valley Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout - It has a wonderful dark brown coffee pour. The head is thin but a great toffee, caramel color. The nose is bitter but there is still a pleasant smell of coffee and hops. The hops is most certainly where the bitterness is coming from. It has a real bold burnt smoky taste. It has defiantly been Americanized with some hops and bold, robust, over-the-top flavors. I wouldn't mind if it was toned down a little. It's one of those beers that could be drank for breakfast or with some Green & Black Organic Chocolate after dinner."
"Aroma is strong and VERY smoky, almost like charcoal, with hints of unsweet chocolate, quality coffee and molasses. It pours a nice deep sable with a fairly thick, if not too persistent, light tan head. Flavor is rather like a quality mocha, smoky with tones of coffee and chocolate and just a whisper of molasses sweetness. Texture is very smooth and just a little tingly. As has been my experience in most cases, on-tap is better; still, it's pretty good in a bottle."
"Drinkability is fantastic. ABV is modest for a Oatmeal Stout of this flavor. Not to mention it has a great balance of bitterness and sweetness. Good job Anderson Valley"
"D - Very nice stuff here; easy-drinking, substantial, complementary with cuisine; what more could you ask for?"
"Fairly low alcohol (5.7%) for a full-bodied stout. Would make a good session beer."
"D - A simple yet very tasty stout. I'll be buying more this Winter."
"This is my final beer from this brewery so hopefully ive saved the best til last,it pours a jet black as night hue with average carbonation that leaves behind a creamy mocha laced one finger head and a rim of lacing,the smell of this beer is a mix of aromas of smokey chocolate,dark expresso and some underlying fruity bitter hops,it has a nice sessionable mouthfeel which is abit lighter than i expected but netherless suits this brew and has nice tastes of coccoa,mocha,roasty malts and finishes with a beautiful bittersweet taste of caramel fruity hops,overall if this beer was abit cheaper and more readily available to me it would have a permanent spot in my fridge even though its not the most complex or best ever oatmeal stout ive tried i quite like it and could drink it all night."
"T- Just like the scent, the smoke hits the tongue right away and is followed by a coffee sourness in the back. very nice mix. Fine attempt at an oatmeal."
"drinkability: solid...I would have this again. definitly"
"The lower abv of this stout plays to its advantage because it makes it easy to have a few, but I think it might also be hurting it by taking away a bit of the taste that could have been there. A good stout, but not quite fantastic."
"D: Awesome. This is a great beer to keep around. Nothing too crazy just a good drinker."
"D: Very drinkable, definitely would have another and I may make it a point to go back and get a sixer of this. Very, very good."
"D - Wow, this stout was very very good. To me it was almost like a dessert stout with the extremely rich dark chocolate flavors, but it's balanced by a good smokiness as well. Very drinkable, I could enjoy a couple after a long days work. Highly recommended. Cheers!"
"Great oatmeal stout, not too light, not too heavy. Very enjoyable."
"D-Pretty good overall, I just thought it would be a little beefier in body than what I tasted. Still a very nice stout."
"A very nice offering from Anderson Valley. I'll be sure and pick this up again."
"Comments: Excellent, just excellent. Sam Smith's oatmeal stout was a longtime treat of mine in the evenings or for Sunday breakfasts, but this one is just a step above, enough to convince me to review it as a first beer. I still have a lot to learn, but this definitely struck a chord in a way other similar beers in the past two years of drinking haven't. Take that for what you will."
"D- if you like good stouts, this one is definitely a good one for you. Very drinkable...muted flavors that aren't weak, but still tasty enough to get you going. I like this one a lot"
"Pours to a thick, dark tan head and minimal lacing (could be my glass to blame) with a dark, nearly opaque ruby-black color. Aroma is spot-on! Very roasty, with hints of oatmeal, vanilla, caramel, chocolate and butter. Flavor is not as intense as I hoped, but not really bad: coffee, sweet malt and enough hops to balance out what the roasted grains do not. Some chalky-mineral-like quality in the finish. Mouthfeel is too thin and gassy. Overall impression: delivers an intense yet superior look and smell with a less-impressive yet solid flavor, finish and feel. One of the easier-drinking oatmeal dark ales I've tasted. I think they should increase the grain bill, maybe add some more base malt to boost the gravity and add roasted barley--something not mentioned on the ingredient list on the label. Is that an oversight? If it really has no roasted, non-malted barley, shouldn't it be called an oatmeal ""porter""?"
"D: very drinkable beer that has a great chocolate nose and flavor. On the other hand the oatmeal I got was on the aroma but that ok it was still a good beer."
"Almost a meal in and of itself."
"This one is different, with the fruits taking on a life of their own, which creates balance issues, but that's just my opion, so take it for what it is worth."
"Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout is a stout that can be enjoyed anytime--for desert, on a winter evening, or (strangely enough) on a hot active day."
"Good beer, well balanced and a easy drinker. Def worth seeking out and I would do so again."
"Overall - Wow, I feel I am doing this beer an injustice trying to place words to its harmonious grandeur. This is a beautifully crafted oatmeal stout that is well balanced, full of flavor, yet not overpowering; delicate enough to please nearly any palate. This is a beer that can complement a hearty meal's dessert or stand alone. Do yourself a favor and treat your mouth to this gem!"
"D - frankly boring, but nothing actually bad about it."
"Medium bodied, medium effervescence. Somewhat warming. A good solid brew, consistent with their other offerings."
"Overall I was impressed with this offering. Be sure to let it warm and enjoy the experience."
"A good beer, I am more partial to heavier stouts with more coffee taste to them but non the less it is worth drinking. I poured it into a glass from a bottle and it's a black beer with good color with the head. The head has a darker caramel color and is good size, about two fingers. The pouring was easy and smooth. The smell is great it smelled like candy. The mouth feel was hearty and covers the tongue, it fells like how a stout should feel. The taste could have scored higher but I probably just had my expectations a little high. It doesn't taste bad by any means its good and would do well with a desert. I like its slight chocolate notes the aftertaste was a bitter sweet finish that i wasn't a huge fan of.This beer would have scored higher but I am biased and I am particular about my stouts. But overall still a good beer. Thanks Anderson valley."
"With a low abv, this is perfect to enjoy after dinner with dessert and since it isn't as thick as most stouts, you don't have to save room to fit it all in :)"
"The ABV% isn't that strong here and this is one of the most easygoing Stouts of any kind that I've had in a long time. I'd rather have this when the leaves are turning but no matter, this is good choice for someone who likes darker beers that aren't too thin and too spicy or heavy. Once again, having a west coast beer distributed here in the east is the benefit of any beer lover like myself!"
"D: A good tasting oatmeal stout, nice drinkability, good flavor."
"Very easy to drink."
"this is an amazing beer."
"D: A solid oatmeal stout with good flavors and aromas that go down easy. Another good Anderson Valley beer."
"Nice accompaniment for a game of darts when snowed in at a small bar in the mountains."
"This is a great example of an oatmeal stout."
"I'm tasting this side-by-side with another oatmeal stout that I greatly enjoy. Pours black with an attractive brown head. Aromas are predominately roasty, with a dark chocolate element in there as well. This beer is full-bodied and robust, with big roasty flavors up front that slowly unfold into sweeter notes of cocoa and toffee. Barney Flats is superb."
"A mighty fine Oatmeal Stout, a benchmark for this style, at least American interpretations."
"D: Fairly good example of the style, but I was expecting more coffee and oatmeal in the taste. Could easily enjoy a few of these."
"Sessionable beer for sure. Solid, solid example of an oatmeal stout."
"D-easy drinking and nice body, good flavors and a nice blend of complexity"
"The body wasn't overly full, but it was smooth and creamy. The carbonation was light and unobtrusive. The thing that really turned me on to this one was the flavor, at the end of my 12 ounces I still haven't put my finger on it, but it intrigues me and I like whatever they've done here."
"D - This is a really nice oatmeal stout...the flavors work together very nicely and the mouthfeel is great...it never becomes too heavy and the low ABV allows you to have three or four of these"
"Taste is mellow but firm, consistent, and even with good depth and range of character. It has a lot of oatmeal, prune, brown bread, some root-beer hints and anise. A light sweetness just dominates the light bitterness. It has a good feel, slightly on the oily side. It is highly drinkable."
"D-Very good, while perhaps not a session beer, very smooth & tasty. Easy to have more than one in a sitting."
"Haven't had many oatmeal stouts but I really liked this beer. 12 oz bottle to glass. Pours a tall, tan head, good retention. Not much smell when I first poured. Dark molasses color. Very flavorful, but not over the top, there is a sweetness, creaminess, and a little bitter at the end, like cream and sugar in really black coffee. Love the tangy roast flavor, some caramel. The smell starts coming around after it warms a bit, very similar to the taste (rich, roasted, coffee smells). Fairly creamy but doesn't coat, actually finishes somewhat dry. Highly recommended."
"D: Drinkability would be very high if not for the mildly distracting aftertaste."
"Overall, it's weak in terms of taste and the diacetyl overwhelms the true oatmeal stout characteristics that could be there. Easy drinkability but not my favorite oatmeal stout."
"Pours a dark black almost color body, average frothy, diminishing. Sweet oatmeal chocolate aroma. Some dusty hops maybe. Creamy body, some almost burnt coffee aftertaste. Chocolately oatmeal taste. Chalky chocolate mouthfeel. Pretty good. A little cigarette ash taste as it warms more."
"Not the best stout I've ever had, but it's definitely something I would consider ordering on tap if I saw while out visiting the pubs."
"Overall - I would rather drink SwampHead's Stubbies Swamp Stout but not because it's better, because it's local. I would put them to be just about equal with each having different strengths and weaknesses."
"Resonates throughout, never diminishes throughout its life. A very drinkable oatmeal stout. Wanna watch a guy be indecisive, tell me I can only have one, this or Sammy Smith's Oatmeal Stout. . ."
"update: have had this many times since, and i like it more and more. a beautifully balanced beer, can't get enough of it."
"D - kind of a let down after a strong start. not bad by any means, but simply run of the mill for me. light body might help in some situations but this isnt very satisfying for a bitter cold winter night."
"D: not too heavy, so a nice stout for capping off a big meal"
"This was not good, which shocked me. Perhaps I got a bad bottle, as the vast majority of reviews of this beer are very high. I have one bottle remaining, but that could be old as well. Guess I'll have to wait and see if I ever get my hands on a fresh sample and then see what I think."
"D- VERY drinkable and enjoyable, this is a great beer to have a few of with friends."
"Very smooth and drinkable; an accompaniment to Samuel Smith as the best of the oatmeal stouts."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Black as a moonless night, no light shines through. Small bubbly head that quickly transforms into a thin film with very good lacing. The taste I love, not your typical oatmeal stout at all, a sweet flavor with just the hint of bitterness, caramel or toffee flavors. This brew makes my mouth happy, velvety smooth. Highly drinkable. A damn good beer."
"Anderson Valley hits the mark with a stout that should appeal to a wide variety, since it is not overly sweet."
"I wish this was available in bottles in Texas."
"Taste is pretty much as I described in the nose. Lightly roasted malts and some floral hops. Crisp, clean, refreshing, but not really standing out to me. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, very nice for such a low ABV beer. This is definitely a smooth session stout, but session stouts aren't really my thing so I rated accordingly."
"D - This is a big beer with a low ABV. Highly drinkable...I'm glad I had the opportunity to try this one!"
"Drinkability - Very much so. This was an after dinner beer both my buddy and I had and we both thoroughly enjoyed it. I will be looking for this at my local beer store - very impressed with it."
"Appropriately thick, with enough carbonation for emphasis, but not for pain. It's more drinkable than average for a beer of this gravitas, but the important part is to remember that is indeed has substance."
"Drinkability - take it slow and enjoy."
"A little bit lighter bodied than I expected. This is by no means a light bodied beer -- I can still call it fuller bodied, but it has enough thinness to aid in the drinkability. A very smooth brew with sip or mouthful capabilities. I'd return to this again."
"Conclusion: Pretty solid oatmeal stout; it could use a bit more depth of flavor and a more substantial body, but it remains a solid player nonetheless. As a sidenote; this beer on tap mixed with Schlafly Pumpkin Ale was absolutely fantastic: one of the few mixed beers I enjoy."
"Drinkability: a solidly drinkable stout."
" ~ This brew has some really high quality characteristics. I certainly recommend this beer to all stout fans. I'm glad I bought a six pack 'cause I'm looking forward to a few more."
"Dark black with clam shell colored head. Very sweet, roasty nose. Tastes include plain oatmeal, vanilla, cinnamon and a small amount of very dark chocolate. Smooth velvety texture and a very attractive beer from the tap. I would say it stands up there in the upper echelon of low abv oatmeal stouts. If you like this style make sure you try it."
"Drinkability - very smooth. Wow....what a fantastic beer!"
"D: A rock solid brew that is very approachable to all beer drinkers. Not overly complex but extremely enjoyable as an everyday staple beer. I can easily see having a few of these in the fridge if this was a local brew. Not a must try, but certainly a brew you can rely on and one you can enjoy with a pretty wide audience."
"Easily drinkable, remarkably enjoyable. This brew is one that could be enjoyed at any point in the day. Simple and sweet, a shining example of an oatmeal stout."
"Drinkability is exceptional. It is not an overpowering, cloying stou, so having a couple is not a problem."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0908-DanM"
"Pours a dark almost cola color with reddish brownish highlights and an off white two finger head that gives way to nice lacing. The smell is of roasted malts, chocolate, oats, and roasted nuts as well as a very small earthy hop note. The taste is of an oat backbone, the over the top taste is of roasted nuts and of chocolate and a slight coffee flavor. There is a very faint earthy hop taste on the back end of the taste. The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and is silky but not slick. The overall drinkability is very high you can enjoy this beer over and over again."
"D - One of the finest oatmeal stouts around. This made for a great morning brew at 11am while we were waiting for the brewery tour to begin."
"D - A good beer, but there is nothing here that makes me feel like I need more than one of these. The malt character is nice, but not especially interesting and the sweetness in the finish hurts the drinkability because it is not balanced by any real bitterness from malt or hops. Worth trying as a single, but I am glad I didn't get a six pack of this."
"D. Very good. Goes down easy and I could have a few of these."
"WILL purchase again."
"I would describe this beer as somewhat robust for the style. Almost has porter-like qualities. Chocolate and roasted coffee, with oats and molasses. A little on the thin side, but does have a creamy type mouthfeel that coats the palate. A little bitterness in the aftertaste. Didn't quite live up to my expectations, but it was a good beer."
"I tried it twice and the foregoing was consistent both times. (Perhaps I was poured from a bad keg. I don't know. I do know that this beer was less than impressive.)"
"But is it just me or is Oatmeal Stout not supposed to be so dry? I always think about the smooth slickness of the Sam Smith as the standard for the style... I liked it, but it certainly doesn't go down as easy as the SS or the Wolaver's."
"Pours a deep dark brown black with a nice brown tan tight head that falls to a film and laces down the glass. Smell is a pleasant malty, roasty, grainy, caramel, molasses, sugarcane, hops, and coffee. Taste is sweet and malty. Mouthfeel is not too thick and drinkability is good."
"This is as good of an oatmeal stout as I have ever found, and I seek them out."
"Bottle. Pours black with a thick, foamy tan head. Aroma of bitter chocolate, chocolate syrup, mocha, roasted chocolate, and roasted malt. Intriguing. Flavor of sweet roasted malt with some sweet roasted chocolate at the end. Palate is a little weak and the beer is a touch sweet, but other than that it's pretty good."
"A very dark brown color body ,with a medium sized off white foamy head. Aroma is roasty with some coffee and nice dark chocolate notes. Flavor is sweet up front,roasty coffee and chocolate as in the aroma, a slight pine hop finish to balance the sweetness out. Full body and mouthfeel , medium carbonation,lots of jagged lacing left on the glass. Quite drinkable , and a very nice session beer."
"Mouthfeel is creamy smooth as it should be with the added oats. Slight carbonation kick on the finish. I like that. Flavor is of chocolate, breads, Quaker Oat Squares, roasted nuts, and a flax finish. This is a good brew. Glad I got to try it."
"This beer pours an opaque black color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is very strong. Graham crackers, roasted malt, milk chocolate, hints of vanilla....very impressive. The taste is very roasty with graham cracker, and lots of bitter dark chocolate in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with appropriately low carbonation, and a silky texture. Overall, this is a very, very good Oatmeal Stout. I would really love to drink this regularly."
" than the one that I experienced."
"A very good stout, not very sweet but not too bitter. The coffee roastiness is restrained in this beer allowing the oats to shine through. Very nice."
"In cooler weather, I'd drink one after another without complaint. In this heat, the heaviness is a bit much, but I'm the one drinking an oatmeal stout in Florida in June ... can't fault the beer for that!"
"D- I'd call this a dessert beer... too much of this would it's special quality meant for moderation."
"Pours a jet black with a nice fluffy head and a bit of lace on the glass. Smell is roasted oats and barley with hints of chocolate, cocoa nibs and hops. I truly enjoy the taste of this wonderful beer, nice creamy balance of chocolate with just a slight hop bitterness, after taste of dark chocolate. Not much carbonation just nice creamy choclate oat taste. This was my first offering from Anderson Valley and it really blew me away, a nice highly drinkable stout."
"taste is semi-watery, bitter sweet chocolate, some coffee, a touch of roasted nuts, slightly sour, oats, and some vanilla, end is somewhat dry and nicely bitter."
"Pours very thick dark brown. Aggressive pour leads to an absolutely massive head. Not a ton in the way of lacing though. Smells pleasant, big yeasty smell, lots of sweetness and a touch of coffee. Taste is a pleasant balance between roastiness, sweetness, and a touch of coffee. Roastiness doesn't overwhelm, and it's more sweet than anything. Normally sweet stouts aren't my thing, but it works here. Nice and creamy, but I would like a little more heft behind the body. Not quite watery, but not as much gravity as I would like. Very drinkable, though. Excellent for a hot day when you don't want a very thick stout."
"The lightness combined with great flavors that open a bit as the beer warms, combined with the lower ABV, makes this a great (if not one of the best) sessionable stout that I would definitely drink again. Cheers to Anderson Valley!"
"Pours a dark brown color but is black in the glass with dark mahogany highlights. Nice cascading tan head that had excellent retention. Nice roasty aroma, light chocolate and caramel comes through, especially as it warms up. Taste is a very smooth mixture of roasty malts and dark bitter chocolate, light hopping. Creamy, silky mouthfeel, perfect carbonation. Very easy drinking dark stout. This was a great extra sent my way by washburnkid. Thanks Judy!"
"I decided to rank this one higher. Having tried some of the other oatmeal stouts, I definitely have a better understanding of what this beer style is all about, and it meets the criteria beautifully."
"Drinkability is very high. I would have no problem sessioning this beer, and given the availability and price, probably will in the near future."
"D: Easy and filling. I want to drink this for breakfast...over and over. This brewery is excellent."
"M/D: smooth and lightly carbonated with a refreshing feel. Easily drinkable."
"D- Oh of course. It goes down so easy. Really a tasty beer that I'd recommend to just about anyone."
"Mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied. Very good. I could drink these like crazy."
"HV"
"poured into a pint glass. very thin tan head, that disappears quickly. very dark letting very little light get through hint of cherry color. smells of smoked molasses and oats. tastes like sweet molasses (which I enjoy), oats(of course),chicory possibly. mouthful is dry not really syrupy, mildly carbonated and acidic. I could drink my normal 2 in 2 hours."
"Drinkability: Nothing too impressive here. Overall, very bland and watery. And I was really looking forward to a proper stout this evening."
"D: I could easily drink these all night. Nice moderate abv. Really a fine beverage."
"The beer is very smooth, maybe a touch watery, but it has that unmistakeable silkiness that comes from the oatmeal. There aren't any burnt or charred flavors in this stout, it is all about fine roasted malts, some chocolate malts, that chocolate cherry flavor that is so enjoyable, and a touch of hop in the finish. The beer does not have any prickliness to it, it is all creamy and smooth. At 5.7% ABV, this is eminently drinkable beyond the first. The beer has some carbonation, not much, but it isn't overly flat or lacking any efforvescence. This is a really nice beer worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"Drinkability is ok. I am not a huge fan of the flavor profile of this beer, so the drinkability factor drops considerably for me."
"Lots of coffee flavors. Thin for an ""Oatmeal"" Stout. The flavor is extensive and makes up for any lightness in the body. The aftertaste is almost chewy--like the aftereffects of a coffee ice cream."
"Overall - One of the best stouts I've ever had. Super complex and sophisticated in taste and texture."
"This beer pours a deep, opaque black with a very thin brown head,thin film of head is retained throughout. Lacing at first was minimal and then left a nice coating on the side of the glass. Nose is of chocolate, roasted malts, some bitter coffee/espresso and on the tail end some sweetness - caramel malts. Taste is very inline with the nose - bitterness of the coffee/espresso is up front, definite roasted malts on the tongue. Finishes up more sweet, here come the caramel malts. Mouthfeel was medium bodied but with high carbonation. If I could make one change on this beer - it would be to lighten up the carbonation. This is a nice beer to sit with, certainly for a session."
"I tried this one out since it knocked off one of my favorite stouts, Bell's Kalamazoo, in the Washington Post Beer Madness. Not sure whether I'd pick it over that one, but still a fine specimen."
"relatively viscous at first, then perked up by mild acidity and prickly carbonation that then quickly backs off."
"Great stuff! My top oatmeal stout. This is always in my fridge, without exception. I can't suggest it to people more strongly."
"Very good carbonation and a nice smooth body. Very representative of its style. I think Anderson Valley hit this one right on the head."
"More sweet that bitter, it tastes of vanilla with mild sugary roast. Odd sour hop oil notes here and there that don't really fit. Mouthfeel is silky smooth and full."
"Drinkability- This is actually one of my favorite oatmeal stouts. Being available individually for around 4.00 a bottle at my local bar, it's one I turn to when I'm in the mood, and could drink a few of before I'm through."
"D- im glad i was sharing the 22oz bomber because it wasnt good enough to me to finish. but it was somewhat pleasant."
"D: Nice sweet stout, overall. Wouldn't mind another and I'm willing to bet this is hella better fresh."
"Overall: Great stout. This is my favourite type of stout. Smooth, well-rounded and chocolaty. Excellent."
"drinkability: Easy. Split a 6 pack with a friend. Would pick it up again sometime..especially if it were on sale."
"Taste matches the nose to a T. Some mild floral hops make an appearance on the back end, It's creamy and highly sessionable. I like it! One of the best oaty-stouts I have had."
"Overall, an absolutely delicious beer. I was very pleasantly surprised, and am extremely glad that I decided on a whim to pick up the sixer that I did. I think I might have even mistaken it for something else when I went to buy it, and I can unequivocally say that it was a fortunate mistake because I have since discovered one of my favourite beers, as of this writing."
"Taste is of roasted malt, slightly tart dark fruit, nutty, molasses, and mocha. Mouthfeel is full bodied, very smooth and creamy. The finish is somewhat dry. Drinks real easy, though the price tag means I wont drink it much. Pretty decent oatmeal stout though."
"D: Awesome beer! I got this as part of a pick your own 6 6-pack. Just grabbed it because I saw it not knowing what to expect. WOW! one of, if not my favorite oatmeal stout"
"It is not too full bodied for a stout but it has a good consistency to it. It def is not too thin. But I could see myself enjoying two or three of these and not getting too full. I'd def recommend grabbing a 22 oz. if you can."
"Good drinkability and highly recommended."
"D - This is a fine example of a lighter weight stout. Although low alcohol stouts are not my style, I could definitely be happy with this one for a night."
"Future outlook: Yeah, I'll gladly give this stuff another whirl at a future date."
"Drinkability- Relatively smooth, yet packed with flavor for a low ABV. Quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"Full bodied, creamy smooth and easy to drink. A nice mellow example of the style."
"Pours a dark black color. 1/3 inch head of a tan color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet chocolate, roasted malts, and a hint of oatmeal sweetness as well. Fits the style of an Oatmeal Stout. Really smooth and thick mouth feel. Carbonation level is average and the bitterness level is average as well. Tastes of a sweetness up front, from the oatmeal and chocolate. The roasted malts come through in the middle of the brew. A very slight hop bitterness is apparent in the finish. Overall, a smooth beer with multiple malt flavors throughout."
"Too expensive to buy if you're not in California. This is a very drinkable oatmeal stout, but it's far from exceptional. Pony up for Sam Smith if you're really into oatmeal stout, or try something else. Flavors are kind of thin (not as thin as Left Hand Milk Stout, though; this is a legit oatmeal stout), smell is average. Like others, I found this slightly sweet, which was off-putting. The sweetness, though, like so much about this stout, was unobtrusive. This is a beer that's hard to dislike, but hard to really get excited about. The price will definitely prevent me from buying it again, but if you're local and it's cheap, it may be worthwhile to pick up -- but if that's the case, then it means you're passing up Deschutes Black Butte Porter or Obsidian Stout, both of which are superior beers. Go with those. This beer is just OK."
"d: I've tried these 3,000 miles and 6 months apart. Not for me."
"its very smooth, but possibly a little over-carbonated. not as thick as i would like it to be. the drinkability, as a result, is way up there."
"Not my favorite style of beer, and also not one I would like by itself, but with a meal I would drink it again."
"D - this is a good oatmeal stout. I was pleasantly surprised and can foresee myself picking this up again."
"Drinkability: very nice for session"
"Plenty of mellow coffee flavors and a blended taste with a malt base and a late kick of hops for an exemplary closing balance. Carbonation is suitably low. The texture is very smooth throughout and makes sipping extremely effortless. This is a stout to seek out."
"This is one of my new favorite stouts. There is a perfect balance of flavors here. The dark chocolate sweetness balances well with the coffee and roasted malt flavors. The slight bitterness is the icing on the cake. I could definitely drink more than one of these in a sitting and at 5.7% abv. I should be able to walk home."
"Bubbly one to two finger head, more large bubbles than small, when they pop the head recedes swiftly, attractive brown color. The liquid is jet black, only hint of brown or orange comes at the outermost rims. Dark roasted coffee, chicory and bitters and then dark chocolate dominate the nose, fair amount of grape, apple, cherry fruit too, with time more butterscotch, oatmeal, while not complex grows in stature with each sniff and resists vacating the premises. Full-bodied, the high level of carbonation plus the overall lack of sugariness relieves a lot of downward pressure. Not that if ""lifts"" per se, but forward movement is not a problem. Flavorwise, the roasted coffee, heavy cream, dark chocolate, toffee, oatmeal elements charge right up on you. Taking this into consideration, isn't malty in an obvious way. Likewise, the hops act more like a sponge at the end as anything else. Loses thrust and follow-through at the end or chooses a more restrained path, choose your own description. But you do want to fill the void with another sip."
"above average drinkability."
"Pours out a deep black color. There's a kind of thin tan head that sits around for a little while leaving some lacing. Looks about normal. The smell is a bit subdued. You get a subtle sweetness and roasted smell that come to the nose. The taste is really great. There's a great sweetness from the oatmeal but its not all sweetness, there's a great roasted bitterness. There's kind of a Coca-Cola taste, but a bit more complex. It's what I like in an Oatmeal Stout. The mouthfeel is good, very smooth, good carbonation, good balance. Everything worked out just fine in this beer. I enjoyed drinking it and loved every sip. Everyone should get this if they can."
"D: keep'em coming. This one is easy! and a go to beer for me. One of the tastier oatmeal stouts I have had in recent. I would not have a problem sipping these all night long...."
"Poured a dark brown body, almost black, with a light brown head and minor lacing. Sweet malts in the smell but very light and rather airy, bland smell. Thick, medium-body with minor creaminess but good smoothness. Roasted malts along with some sweet malts for a good balance and the oats really make it pass easy but there's still a good, dry backbite so its not watery. I could keep drinking these as it is hard to put the glass down when the beer is so pleasantly smooth and packs a nice punch."
"A very dark pour with a small head. Very sweet tasting but also extremely delicious. I really enjoyed this beer. The oatmeal stout has become of my my favorite styles and this would rank up there with one of the best I have tasted. Would recommend as either a dessert beer, or if you are like me it's a nice beer to drink while relaxing and watching a hockey game in the winter."
"Drinkability: This is a gorgeous oatmeal stout! Maybe the best I've had. Kind of reminds me of an English RIS. Way more flavorful than all other oatmeal stouts I've had. Will buy again."
"poured out of a 12oz bottle from fridge. nice black color with pale tan head of about 1 finger. aroma was ok, a bit of roast a bit of oats, kinda grassy with the oats and roast growing as it warmed. mouthfeel was a bit on the light side of what i think of in an oatmeal stout chilled, as it warmed it felt thicker with an acceptable feel at about 55f. cold it was kinda meh, not much there in the way of oats, just a good stout. as it warmed the oily viscosity and taste from the oat appeared, but alas they clashed with the roastyness. i think the roast was a little strong and it clashed from my thoughts on an oatmeal stout it was a bit rough around the edges and not a creamy rich beer i would want to drink over and over again on a cold night. perhaps a sample on tap would provide a more positive read on the actuality of this beer."
"A very sweet version of a stout, with a nice chocolate coffee flavor with a malted smell and a decent hop presence on the back end. One of the few great sessionable stouts due to the very low alcohol content, it's refreshing to find one so smooth and kind of low-key."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin for an oatmeal stout. Still smooth and a mild biting carbonation. Fairly solid."
"The oats make themselves known from the outset, lending an incredible maltiness that cannot be matched by malted barley alone - sweetness grows from beneath the tongue, becoming just a bit syrupy, but not so much that it's a distraction. Other notes of dark cherries, currants, and of bittersweet chocolate round out this beer, making it a wholly enjoyable and exceptional example of the style - this is a really great beer, and one that I would love to enjoy the next time I'm here."
"D: Drinkability is very high, I'd liked it so much that I am not sure if it could get much better than this."
"Overall: Got to be one of the better oatmeal stouts that I have tried. This beer has a good malt backbone with some nice smokey light burnt sugar overtones. The mouth feel is creamy with a bitter finish that linger very nicely on the palate. I really like this stout, it is well made."
"Taste was very creamy. I didn't get much roasted flavor from this one. Hint of chocolate. Nice mouthfeel and a very easy drinker. Smooth and goes down easy, but might be a little too sweet for a session."
"It's not overwhelming or rather complicated. However, Barney Flats is a good, solid, tasty oatmeal stout. Smooth with ample effervescence, this is quite enjoyable. I wouldn't put it with top-shelf offerings such as Samuel Smith's outstanding version, but this is no slouch. Good."
"D-Too expensive for what I've been getting so far its ok."
"mouth is thick but not very rich, drinks easy but I'm not really sure that's a good thing for an oatmeal stout. I liked this beer but I come to expect more from such a highly rated beer."
"drinkability- very good easy to drink oatmeal stout overall. I thought it could have been a bit heaver body."
"Really nice beer. There are certainly bigger oatmeal stouts out there, but this was just relaxing and really nice."
"As a quick aside... let this one warm up a little bit, really brings out the flavors. As the bottle suggests, serve at 40-45F!"
"D: A good tasting beer. Being lighter than other oatmeal stouts I've had, this beer went down easy."
"I heard from others that this was an excellent oatmeal stout, and they were right. Dark brown pour with a small, thick tan head. Aroma is semisweet chocolate and oatmeal, with some toasted malts. The taste is very smooth, with a creamy mouthfeel. Lots of caramel, some chocolate, and full of oats and malt. Definitely will finds its way into my fridge again."
"D- I am impressed by this beer. IMO the drinkability is much higher than other beers from this style. Great brew from a reputable brewery. Well done."
"D: A fair, slightly above average oatmeal stout that is easy to drink."
"Pours a deep brown. A little more watery looking than I'm looking for in a stout. Smell is sweet sugar, chocolate and maybe a hint of coffee. Taste magnifies the sugar and chocolate, not as much coffee in the taste. Slightly bitter in the aftertaste. The silky-smooth mouthfeel is the best part of this beer. Moderate carbonation and good drinkability."
"Very good brew."
"D: Nothing remarkable or multi-dimensional. The oatmeal is there, the qualities of a good stout are there. Well done and thought out, nice to see one that plays more on the oatmeal flavors than going the coffee route."
"D: Fairly drinkable, pretty solid, but not great."
"D - A great oatmeal stout. Very easy drinking with no bitter aftertaste."
"Aroma was great - lots of chocolate and good malty smell. Flavor was similar to the smell - it was great. Definitely one of the better stouts I've had."
"Notes from 11/12/04"
"D- Its ok. I haven't been too thrilled on the taste of some of the Anderson Valley beers."
"At $10/6-pack, Barney Flats is not particularly cheap. However, it is better and not as expensive as Samuel Smith's version. This is one of the best beers that I've had recently, and I would highly recommend it."
"12 oz bottle. Very dark black with a brown head. Very inviting roasted aroma of chocolate and coffee. Taste follows the nose with a nice sweet maltiness with roasted edges. Slight mineral graininess and astringency. Definately some cold black coffee and dark chocolate notes. Very well rounded and tasty, more integrity than many oatmeal stouts I've had. Decently filling which affects the overall drinkabilty. Smooth creamy mouthfeel. Overall, a tasty stout that I will be having again."
"Very enjoyable and easy to drink. Overall a very decent brew."
"D_A decent beer, but as an Oatmeal it just doesn't stand out. The thicker mouthfeel is absent and the overall complexity is lacking. A shame as I have enjoyed other beers from the brewery."
"This was an exceptionally well-balanced stout that was very smooth and enjoyable to drink. It would be well-suited to meals as well as cold winter months. Definately worth a try!"
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a medium size foamy head with average retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of black chocolate with some light dry roasted malt notes. Taste is also a well balance mix between some dry roasted malt notes with some nice black chocolate notes. Creamy texture is really enjoyable with some good carbonation. Very well done and well balance while still being easily drinkable."
"Overall a tasty and complex oatmeal stout."
"D: Yep"
"D: Very good, can definitely down a couple of these no problem. Six pack worthy and a great example per style that should bring many a future enjoyment."
"This beer arrive opaque in color with a very thick and creamy head. One smell of soft and sweet milk choclate lured me into drinking the beer in no time....wow! Exceptionally smooth and creamy, this was like drinking chocolate cake batter. Surprisingly easy to quaff. I'll have to try the non-nitro version sometime, but on nitro-tap this was a pleasure!"
"Very Solid Oatmeal stout, easy to drink, but still had plenty of flavor."
"A very nice oatmeal stout. Very smooth and flavorful. Recommended."
"Silky smooth stout - what I would expect from an oatmeal stout. An amazing stout, very sessionable. This is almost like a more refined version of Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout."
"Poured a light black color, nice head and carbonation.Nose is of brown sugar,and molassas. Body is thick and rich. Taste is good, oatmeal, light cocoa, light chocolate and roasted malts. Mouthfeel was nice and creamy, really smooth and pleasure to drink! Would drink again."
"Overall, Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout is a good oatmeal stout that is definitely recommended. However, there are many more oatmeal stouts that I prefer over this one."
"D. This is a robust Stout. Lots of flavour and a good mouthfeel."
"Anderson Valley makes some great beer, if only it was at a better price point..."
"D.I could drink a few of these and be happy."
"Sampled this big ole birthday beer out of a bomber, a gift from my girlfriend (thanks cupcake!), Poured an opaque black color with a creamy, one finger khaki head. Nice lacing and good retention. All apropos for the style. Strong coffee and roasted malt aroma. The flavors were bold, chocolate and coffee first, then roasted malt and some wet grains followed by oak and a long bitter finish. The finish reminds me of coffee grounds. Full bodied and low carbonation with a good but not particularly smooth mouthfeel. Solid and enjoyable, California does it again."
"D- A very solid brew and incredibly easy to drink."
"D - easy drinking, very tasty brew."
"Pours near black with some deep mahogany trimming out the edges of this extraordinary looking Stout. The head is a creamy,thick,four fingers of espresso looking froth,that leaves curtains of lace as it shrinks slooowwwlllyyyy. The nose is sweet and full of chocolate brownie,backed up by some dry oats aromas,and hops. Barney Flats tastes milky and soft with lots of coffee and burnt malt flavors,along with some leathery tuffness that makes this a flavorful Oatmeal Stout that seems like a full course meal . The body is full and just the way I like my Stouts. I poured this 12oz bottle in my Beamish pint glass,and damn I wish it had filled it up. This brew is winner,ya digg!"
"D: A decent Oatmeal Stout, but my bottle wasn't the cream of the crop. Hopefully mine came from an off batch that didn't get caught before being bottled. Light body makes this a nice session beer."
"D - With roasted/smoky flavors balancing out some sweet notes and a great black coffee bitterness hitting in the finish combining with a big, dense feel this is a nice one to sip on."
"D: Even though they claim ""it's not just for breakfast anymore"" the beer would be good at any time of the day. Perfect for casual shindigs, or just relaxing. I'm still working on a dish it would pair nice with. I made a beef stew with it as the base and it turned out phenomenal."
"D: No complaints here. I'm so used to double stouts that regular stout often seem weak and pathetic, but this one is quite good."
"D - A tad heavy on the stomach, but not hard to drink. Find it as a nice change of pace to other more hoppy beers."
"Drinkability> very drinkable, though the chewiness tricks me into feeling full by the end."
"D: This is an excellent oatmeal stout. Just enough bitterness, which is standard for a stout."
"Fairly drinkable. None of the beers from Anderson Valley knocked my socks off, but this one was definitely my favorite."
"I could drink em all night!"
"This is a very enjoyable oatmeal stout. It is very dark in color and smells chocolatey and rich. The taste wasn't as thick and creamy as I would have liked. You could sense the oatmeal, but it didn't leave that silky smooth mouthfeel that some oatmeals do. The beer has a little bitterness to it, but it is well balanced. My preference for an oatmeal stout is a lower ibu bitterness and maybe even lower abv to give that smooth and undescribable taste. But that is just a preference, overall this is a good beer! Drink one!"
"The drink settled with a dark black chocolate color appearance. Also, the head was pretty thin but included some patchy lacing. Aromas had a medium-strong chocolate flavor wrapped around biscuit flavors. Taste had a decently mocha flavoring with a thick, breadyness to it. Excellently creamy for an oatmeal stout, but light enough to enjoy without having to unbuckle the belt. Overall, a desert-like treat."
"D: Average ABV, good taste but a bit on the watery side. Flavors are also not as complex and engaging as compared to Samuel Smith's offering. Would drink again, but probably bomber in a sitting will do me fine."
"Very smooth and easy to drink, probably my favorite Anderson Valley beer so far."
"This is some good beer. But I have to say I am partial to oatmeal stouts,i.e., Goose Island Oatmeal Stout. This is a dark beer, with a lacey head on it. Smells good and tastes even better. If you ever have the chance to try this brew, go for it. You won't be disappointed. Nice burnt coffee taste with a nice kick."
"Mouthfeel is great, plenty of body but not too much, a nice solidly built brew. I could certainly have another or two of these."
"Black as night with a quickly disappearing tan head. Nice to look at. Smell is also very nice, typically roasted smell, some chocolate, some hops in the back. Kinda reminds me of some of the Bell's beers. On the tongue, comes across as slightly overcarbonated. Initial pretty sweet with an almost rootbeer like taste, though not THAT sweet. Some chocolate and coffee in the finish. Quite a nice beer."
"you could finish off a 6 pack easily, a very good rendition of an oatmeal stout."
"Bottle. Deep dark brown color, with a medium sized tan head. Great initial smell with roasted malt flavors and almost a slightly bourbon/oaked aged flavoring(?). Bourbon/oak flavoring vanishes, giving way to roasted chocolate malt aromas. Flavor is well balanced between roasted, chocolate and hop flavors and slight oat-like finish. The mouth feel is slightly lighter than I prefer for an oatmeal stout. Overall a very drinkable beer with good balance."
"Mouthfeel is good; so is drinkability."
"Poured into a glass and got a nice looking head that settled into a thinner lacing. The color was a dark brown/black that looked almost like coffee at times. The smell had a fruity and maple scent that I picked up. The taste was very smooth something that I was not expecting. The mouthfeel was kind of thick after a couple of sips. This is s stout that I could enjoy for an hour or 2 but after that its too thick on the palate for my taste. Overall a very good one here if you find one give it a try."
"Overall, a decent oatmeal stout. Very drinkable."
"D - With smooth rich flavors and velvety finish this is over the top easy to drink, way to go AV!"
"Dark brown color with a mocha head of about a finger. Leaves some solid lacing on the glass. Chocolate and roasty aromas emanate from the foam. Flavor is hearty chocolate malt with a little fruity hop character. Too much carbonation hurts the mouthfeel and disrupts the richness of the body."
"pours a beautiful dark brown. a fantastic tan head - it didn't stick around too long - but nice none the less. no lacing on the glass. had a dark chocolate malty smell - a bit smoky as well which is very nice. almost a burnt smell. i let it warm up before trying. this is one fantastic tasting beer. one of the better oatmeal stouts i've had. the mild smoke smell comes through in the flavor as well. well balanced."
"Drinkability - This is most likely very drinkable if you are eating but as a stand alone i would only do a few because the sweet maltiness totally dominated my mouth."
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Appeared to be bottle conditioned. Poured an opaque brown/black with a good finger of tight bubbled tan head. Chocolate aroma with a bit of molasses. Very creamy mouthfeel. More chocolate in the flavor along with a slight tang. Some hop bitterness in the finish along with dry chocolate malt. Very smooth and drinkable."
"D - This is a great stout! It has enough bitter coffee and dark chocolate to earn the stout moniker, but it's sweet and creamy enough to keep it from being too burnt and bitter. I like this a lot!"
"Pours black with a tall tan head. The aroma is of candy, nougat, and cocoa. Smooth milky chocolate with a hint of oats and espresso. There's a slight sour tang from the oats, I guess, but it's nice and approprite for the style. The body is medium weight and very smooth with low-medium carbonation. The aftertaste is a little toasty and meaty, but reminds me of a cookie somehow. I guess I'm not quite sure what's going on here, but it's a very drinkable and very tasty mix of flavors. A top beer in the style."
"Black, opaque color with a small light tan head. Very nice aroma of roasted malts and a little bit of chocolate and coffee. Great flavor. Very rich and thick. Creamy mouthfeel with a slight bitterness. Great all around beer and a great representation of the oatmeal stout style."
"The pour is a deep brownish black with a creamy chocolate milk colored cap. The nose is very nice; good strength for a lightish (abv) brew. Dark fruits, roasted malts, and bittersweet dark chocolate with some residual oat sweetness. Medium bodied with an oaty, oily smoothness to it, while retaining a carbonated creaminess. Oats bring the sweetness to the palate along with dark chocolate. Very light roasty bitterness follows. Barney Flats has a great nose to it, but the flavor doesn't quite keep up and tips slightly toward the sweet end of the scale. Still, a very enjoyable and easy drinkin' oatmeal stout."
"D: Because it is an Oatmeal Stout that is mellow and balanced, the cream is light enough to have more than one in a session. At 3.99 a bomber it is also reasonably priced. I see more of these in my future."
"D: This is an understated, mellow stout that gets you with its dedication to strong but rational hopping combined with toasted malty smoothness. A great stout at a fairly reasonable price ($10.49/6 pack)."
"The taste has notes of roasted malt, some coffee, and a bit of chocolate. Nice medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation and it finishes with some hot cocoa bitterness. Nice and tasty, easy to drink...one of the better examples of the style that I've tried. I'd have no problem drinking a couple or 3 at a session. Good stuff!"
"Drinkability- Very high drinkability on this one. I would be happy to have one or five and due to the 5.7% ABV, I could handle either or. Excellent with hearty dishes such as chili or steak."
"Poured a nice opaque color with good (if a bit fizzy) head and decent lacing. Had a nice coffee/oatmeal scent, but a little weak. What was there was nice, but it wasn't as full as it could be. Good taste, nothing great, but it is a decent stout with a nice oatmeal taste, just a bit timid. Goes down fine, a little fizzy, but nice. Not the best oatmeal stout, but I would still get it any day, considering their green methods of brewing."
"D - Definitely a good beer, but less dryness would be lots better."
"This is one of the most drinkable stouts I've ever had. Smooth, complex flavors without being too strong. I'm a big fan all around. Glad I have five more bottles!"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is black in the glass and has a thick, tan, two-finger head. The smell is enjoyable; milk chocolate, marshmallow and slight coffee are present. Perhaps a bit of butteryness. The taste is not nearly as sweet as I had expected, but I guess I was expecting a milk stout from the smell, not a typical stout. The taste is malty with a bitterness from the roasted notes and slight, unidentifiable hoppiness. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a creamy carbonation from the oatmeal. Overall, a very drinkable beer; not the best oatmeal stout ever, but a very solid one."
"Pours basically black with a big big lasting light brown head. Roasty bitter smell, but it was quite light for a stout. Taste is rich, smooth, creamy, and roasty, with a traditional oatmeal stout like flavor. Very indicitave of the style, and even though it wasn't bad at all, I like the other 3 oatmeals I've had a bit to quite a bit better. Not too strongly flavored, and it is lacking a bit of needed sweetness, I think. A decent beer, but nowhere near as good as Samuel Smith's Oatmeal."
"This is probably the best oatmeal stout that I've ever had. Great flavors and not one aspect is too over powering. I tip my hat to the brewers of this beer."
"The taste is 4-sugars coffee sweet, but balanced nicely by a light hop bitterness. There's really not a ton going on here, but there doesn't need to be. This is a very good oatmeal stout. Very drinkable."
"I was really impressed with Anderson Valley's Winter Ale, so I had high hopes for their Oatmeal Stout, which I heard a lot of good things about... this one didn't disappoint... poured a beautiful jet-black, ebony hue with a reddish and tan frothy head that exhibited some staying power... smell was as expected of the style, with dark and rich cocoa and latte notes pouring through... taste was absolutely superb for the style... very different, distinct, and unique, with a sweet, non-cloying, caramel and dark sugar flavor that was really pleasing and satisfying without being overwhelming... the flavor was really great on this one... a top-notch brew and an excellent depicition of the style... great stuff... with an ultra-creamy and super-thick mouthfeel... drinkability was equally good with a relatively low ABV that surrounded a terffic taste... Definitely recommended..."
"D. A nice change of pace. not too heavy but not too light. one or two would be pretty good but after that???"
"Got this one on tap at my local overpriced beer joint for swells. Can't say too much about the appearance do to the dark lighting. Nice head that sticks around for a while. Coffee and caramel flavors with a bit of roasted smokiness, but none of that ash-tray over done the roasted malt problem so many stouts suffer from. The hops hang around in the background nicely balancing the character without announcing their presence unless you look for them. The oatmeal provides a nice smoothness that doesn't require you to wait between sips. A great example of what a stout should be."
"Another of a dozen brews from the very generous tayner. Thanks!"
"D: While, in terms of alcohol, it's kind on the brain, it's pretty big. However, I do find myself taking it back pretty quickly, if only for that rich, mouthful sensation. An excellent stout... recommended."
"A smooth beer that goes down easy. Worth picking up."
"Very tasty and a spot-on body.. what I want in an American Oatmeal Stout.. Pretty pricey, but a dime a bottle, this brew is worth every sip."
"12 oz. glass bottle- color of India ink, with a thin light head - nose of, iodine, salty, malty, slight bitterness, some sweetness and coco  taste of coffee, dark chocolate, milky, and clean - body is medium high, milky and with low carbonation  aftertaste of, coffee, dark chocolate, milky and some chewieness"
"I liked this brew. It is a very solid example of the style and extremely easy to consume. It has a good depth to the flavor and is appropriately balanced toward the malts. I would certainly welcome another."
"Pours pitch black with a massive dark tan head. Nose is thick with chocolate. Not overdone by any means. Flavor is thick with a mild coffee edge. The flavor doesn't really live up to what has preceded it. Overall quietly sweet. Feel is pretty thick as you'd expect from the style. Very drinkable. Upon my first sip, I probably downed 1/4 of the bottle because it was so smooth and I couldn't help myself. Overall a pretty darn good oatmeal stout."
"This is the best oatmeal stout I have ever had."
"D: Yes may I please have another, as this was a wonderful stout."
"The strengths of this beer are the mouthfeel and drinkability. The oatmeal provides an incredible richness and smoothness. This one goes down very easy. A great session beer and a nice easy sipper for the cold weather."
"Notes: A great session stout. Not exceptionally complex, but nicely balanced and very flavorful."
"D: Not too bad. Served better chilled than room temp."
"This is pretty damn dark. Almost as dark as Victory's Storm King I delved into when I jumped the gun 30 or so days ago but really, I don't recall ever seeing something as dark as those. Colorwise it's right on hue with any previous oatmeal stout I've tried and a peanut butter colored head that faded fairly fast. A very roasted scent reminding me of an ealy winter bonfire. Warm and mellow caramel, oats and coffee flavor on the front end. Like breakfast on a cold morning where ya need something to warm your bones before you go outside to dig the car out of 8 inches of snow because even though the kids got a snowday ya have to go to work. Granted, one has to wait to the workday is done and the chillun' are in bed before relaxing with a laid back yet hearty brew but this one is a great reward. A slight bit of hops shows up in the aftertaste but it's not at all bitter because it's balanced by a smokey molasses and malt tinge strolling around through it."
"Thie bottle cap boasts ""solar-powered brewery," which is entirely awesome if true. It looks entirely opaque and nearly black with a lingering caramel head. It smells strongly of roasted coffee and dark, dark, bitter chocolate. This beer is delightfully smooth and rich. The roasted malts and sticky, sweet coffee/chocolate come through heartily, but are not too dense to where they impede upon the hoppy elements at the end. The mouthfeel would showcase the oatmeal element if the beer didn't get so sticky at the end."
"Smell is chocolately and roasty, taste is similar at first, but has a nice bitterness near the end. Medium/full bodied, very smooth. This is a very good and very drinkable late night beer. It isn't going to melt your face with flavor, smell or alcohol but it might blow your mind with its balance of smoothness and complexity--very good."
"This is a good beer that i will pick up again on occasion since it can be had locally, but not one i will make a special trip for."
"This was the second of 4 beers my wife brought back to me from Seattle. Poured it into a pint glass, and noticed the ruby red/black color, an excellent shade. Smelled of chocolate, coffee, and oatmeal. The taste was very good, a nice example of an oatmeal stout. The only issue I would have with this beer would be its thin consistency. For a stout, it was a bit on the watery side. A good beer, but there are much better oatmeal stouts out there."
"Rich, smooth and chewy. Thick and full-bodied - coasts the mouth, but it's cloying. Well balanced by by the mild hop and roasted bitterness. So smooth and easy to drink. Flavorful with a relatively low abv make this stout very nice."
"Overall, it's actually kind of bland, I think, as much as I want to like it, I find myself wishing for a Russian Imperial stout. I have a case and I probably wouldn't buy it again. It's not offensive in any way, but nothing special either."
"Taste is mildly chocolate, very little sweetness or fruity notes. It's good but not outstanding. Seems to be a one note beer, chocolate, and not much else. Feels rich as an oatmeal stout should. Easy to drink as it's not offensive in any way."
"A good stout. Borderline sipper. Somthing seems to one dimentional on the tastes. I would like this again some day."
"D: Drinks very well for the style. I could hammer a couple of these pretty easily. Not painful to drink slow either."
"Pours almost black with a thin tan head. Very good retention,and a nice lacing. Aroma is of brown sugar,and molassas. Body is thick and rich,with little carbionation. Taste is like an oatmeal sugar cookie,with a roasted edge.I would highly recommend this beer!"
"Poured into a tulip pint glass. Color was a dark brown with a caramel brown head. Smelled like a sweet brown sugar. Taste was definitely like a sweet oatmeal cookie. No complaints about mouthfeel. Lingered just long enough in the mouth, but didn't cause to many problems with being overly sweet. Very drinkable, was even better when it was warm."
"Not overpowering, and very drinkable."
"This Anderson Valley offering poured a pitch black color, with one finger worth of brown heading. Smells I picked up on were fresh oatmeal, chocolate, milk, and a faint hint of raspberry. As I let it explore the palate, I detected more oatmeal, a bit of charcoal, and a slightly metallic twang in the end. Mouthfeel was slick and on the medium side, bordering on heavy. Drinking this beer is incredibly easy. It doesn't feel like a meal in a bottle, yet still has a rich character about it. This is by far one of the best Oatmeal Stouts I have ever had. Unfortunately this is my last bottle in the six pack. Cheers"
"Pours a near jet black color, a good bit of tan head and lacing that sticks around as the beer drains. Nose is sweet roasted malt. A nice smash of chocolate as well. Taste is smooth at first. Malt shows up strongest, then coffee and chocolate. Maybe a hint of dried fruit. A touch of hops stick with the dry, roasted coffee flavors at the end. Taste is quite good, although not necessarily particulalry complicated. Feel is maybe a touch thinner than I'd want - more porter-like than stoutish. I really like this one; very tasty and filling. A solid stout."
"The feel of the beer was extremely smooth. I will have to buy a sixer of this one. I am glad the brewery is not up the street. 2nd beer of Anderson's that has been money."
"Pours an opaque deep brown/black with a hearty huge head that sticks to the glass. Smells of a hint of coffee, chocolate, caramel, maybe roasted nuts. Taste is just as the smell suggests. Nice and full in the mouth with little carbonation. A delicious oatmeal stout indeed."
"D - A great oatmeal stout with lots of malt character, but a very balanced beer. The sweetness is kept in check by bittering effects of the hops. I consider this to be a premier example of the style and recommend it."
"D: The interesting flavors and aromas, coupled with a relatively low abv, make this session worthy!"
"D: A very good stout from Anderson Valley. Drinkable, sessionable, a great offering."
"Pours a deep brownish-black with a thick cocoa-colored foam. Rich aroma; chocolate, burnt sugar, and oatmeal. When I have an oatmeal stout, I want to smell and taste the oatmeal, and this one doesn't disappoint. Solid oatmeal scent and taste. Taste isn't dominated by the oatmeal though; chocolate, burnt caramel, a little charcoal, followed by the solid oatmeal aftertaste. It's good to see a beer deliver taste as described on its label. An excellent option for those seeking an oatmeal stout that carries an oatmeal taste but isn't too filling."
"Pretty much a black brew with a decent head that breaks pretty quick. Aroma of chocolate and oats, a little vanilla. Nice velvetty charcoal with oats to the taste buds. A little sour to the back of the tongue. A bit fizzy but very drinkable for such a solid flavored beer. I liked it and could drink a few at one sitting gladly. Pretty unique I think."
"States on the bottle it uses Boonville mineral water, hmmm. Pours a dreamy black with a two finger fluffy tan head that slowly dies down to a nice layer a while after pour. Stickiness is here and there, expected more for this style. Smell is very sweet. Choclatey goodness with a sugary caramel malt. Flavor is of toasted oats up front with bready malt flavors going down. Hops actually appear quite a bit in the aftertaste, somewhat bitter. Mouthfeel is full bodied, smooth, creamy, with a low to medium carbonation. I could drink more than one of these easily in a sitting, which is uncommon for this style. Shoulda saved this one for breakfast in the mornin'."
"although the taste is more intense than other oatmeal stouts, the aftertaste is rather pleasant. worth a try, but a repeat six-pack might not be in the future."
"I like oatmeal stouts and the label looked fun, bear with antlers. Brownish black pour. Smell is chocolatey with little fruit. Taste is chewy, malts and I can pickup the oatmeal, it lingers in the mouth until the next drink, very nice. Good stout, would love to try somewhere on tap."
"This beer poured pitch black dark with an inch or two of light chocolate head. I was disappointed in the aroma- I wasn't getting much but a light, malty odor. The taste proved to be much more impressive, as strong bursts of chocolate and caramel flavor were prevalent. It has a hoppy, bitter taste that is not overpowering, but holds to the tongue. This is not a dry stout, but has a milky mouthfeel without any heaviness that slows down drinkability. I imagine this as a nice sitting-around-at-home beer."
"D- easy drinking, complex, and tasty, seems like something is a miss between this and great oatmeal stouts, but drinkable and recommended"
"Pours a dark brown/black with dark brown head and medium to light carbonation. Not any hops or aroma malt to speak of ad taste is slightly sweet with little hops up front or in the finish. Mouthfeel is oily,silky, and medium. Drinkability is very high and though it is 5.70% I could easly drink this all night and not get tired of it."
"I love this beer. Definetly worth seeking out and buying."
"I remember trying this straight from the bottle, and of course, not being overly impressed. Now that I have a chance to savor it, I can see it's high points. Completely lacking in bitterness, and a nice silkiness to it. An excellent stout."
"What a great stout! Black, with a sticky cocoa head. The smell is subtle, but inviting, not much more than roasted malt present. The flavor is complex, and immensely satisfying, introducing dark chocolate first and later a hint of espresso. Nice litte hop bite at the finish. Mouthfeel isn't quite as creamy as would be ideal, but damn good. One of the best stouts out there for sure. None more drinkable."
"Overall it was a bit less than expected, the appearance was terrific, but belied the beer's actual taste"
"D: This beer wasnt made to be very drinkable. Just the one beer is hard to finish."
"Not as good of a beer as I expected."
"D: This is a great beer from Anderson Valley, a very easy stout to drink. This beer has a lot of flavor it is rich and complex without being too much. This beer has earned a solid spot in my fridge. I would recommend this one to any person who has not yet had the pleasure."
"D: A nice oatmeal stout that is full bodied and very drinkable. Soft floral presence adds a different element to this brew. Reommended."
"Easy to drink but a little too thin for my tastes."
"D- I think it is very tasty. Easy to drink and nice balance to it. I wish we could get these in Vegas."
"The only oatmeal presence is in the mouthfeel. Nice and creamy. Somewhat chewy and creamy but could be better. For some reason, Im getting a bit of abv presence but I dont think that is possible. Certainly doesnt detract from the overall experience. Quite an enjoyable brew. Breakfast beer of choice?...."
"Head was very impressive, a thin film rested itself atop the brew almost the whole way down, bravo AV. Very drinkable. Such a respectable beer in so many ways. I'll have another, please."
"Very enjoyable oatmeal stout. A bit easier to drink than most, but that doesn't really count against it. A very solid beer; I'll certainly get this again! Recommended."
"Poured a deep brown/black, thick and opaque, no light getting through on this one. A nice one inch head faded somewhat quickly to leave a nice quarter inch layer of lace on the top. Very nice streaking down the glass at first, but as it warmed this ceased. Smell was very sweet. First hints are of roasted coffee, rich and very full. Nice aromas of sugar, caramle and the slightest bit of chocolate are up next.The taste was wonderful, albeit a little thin for a stout, but still the flavors themseleves were great. Coffee the biggest flavor here, followed by caramel and chocolate rounding the corners off, maybe even a touch of a smoked scent in there, very nice. Good carbonation, however looses a couple points for the thin feel. Very nice smooth finish, not dry at all. This one definatly asks you back for another try. This is very sessionable, goes down almost too easy, could drink it in a gulp almost, good call IMO."
"This poured thick and almost jet black. Thin but resilient head. Light aroma of espresso. Has a smooth roasted flavor to it, a little hoppy as well. Honestly, what I'd expected from it, nothing crazy about this one. A good all around beer, but not something I'd crave."
"Drinkability: Intensely drinkable, and a good reach-for when you just want a nice stout stroll, so to speak. However, I do not think this is appropriate for its style."
"I only have one of these and I'm very disappointed in myself. The full flavor, creamy mouthfeel and relatively low abv makes this a very attractive option for winter sessions."
"Excellent oatmeal stout. Highly recommended. Go and pick up a six pack, you won't go wrong."
"updated 2/13...after some more ""research"" I think I understand the style better. And this is one of the best."
"I bought a 12oz bottle due to a recent interest in oatmeal stouts and tried it right after Goose Island Oatmeal Stout. Barney Flats was slightly better overall, definitely better appearance with a creamy looking foam and more opaque liquid. The smell had a little more chocolate too, but was mostly roasted malt aroma. The flavor was roasted malt and as per spec the mouthfeel was a creamy texture. Nice, now onto Samuel Smiths."
"Yes I must agree with the last reviewer, but this is my first time trying this one, and damn, I wish I had more than one. Nice chocolatey malts with slight twingy hops at the end with of course an oatmealish background, and maybe a slight bit of coffee. Pours a nice tan head with a very black colored beer. Just an outstanding stout and I cannot say this about many stouts, but I could make this a session brew."
"D - A great stout to have anytime. Very enjoyable and drinkable."
"Another good beer from Anderson Valley. Keep up the good work!!"
"Drinkability-If you don't like stouts, and especially oatmeal stouts, you may not like this one. But as an oatmeal stout; WOW!! Not overly heavy, but heavy enough to be interesting."
"Brown sugar sweet with a chewy oatmeal presence, this may well be the best sweet stout beer on the planet. How's that for a review? I dig it. If you haven't had this beer yet, stop reading this immediately and go get some. 'Nuff said."
"It's not a bad beer, so I'd say it's pretty drinkable, it just doesn't live up to what I think is a very good oatmeal stout. It really reminds me of a porter in both mouthfeel and taste. After reading the Alstrom bros' reviews from a few years ago I really think they must've dumbed this beer down lately."
"Where were the oats? Made me think more of a baltic porter with coffee and a touch of sourness. Dark, botter chocolate too. Minty hops more than anything else. Not smooth or rich. Not soft. Mostly biting. No real lingering flavors. Boring and disappointing because I have enoyed most of the other offerings from this brewery."
"Drinkability: I'm not necessarily all about the smokey finish but I have had several bottles because overall it is quite delicious."
"D - Good drinkability. Solid stout."
"I'm not an oatmeal stout guy, and this one hasn't changed that."
"This isn't a stout that is going to blow you away, but it's very session worthy. Good stuff."
"Notes: This stout tastes dont truly come out until it warms up a little."
"A refreshing change from ever bigger and bolder stouts."
"Mouthfeel is outstanding, good even for an oatmeal stout. Smooth, full, and creamy without being slick or overpowering. Drinkability is very good, a few more of these might disappear tomorrow night."
"Drinkability: If there is a more drinkable outmeal stout, one would be hard-pressed to find it"
"Drinkability - this is good beer and very sessionable."
"Beautiful beer! Pours a very dark black with a foamy, small tan head. Fair amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is delicious -- sweet, dark chocolate, a hint of licorice -- very solid smell. The taste is also sweet, with a bitter semisweet chocolate aftertaste. So nice. For a sweet, bitter beer, the mouthfeel is smooth and the drinkability is high. I would love to drink these all night. Great beer!"
"Great at any temperature."
"Drinkable? ABSOLUTELY! I could easily take down an entire sixer of these babies in the cold winter by a nice warm fire. Despite, it's heaviness, the drinkability is outstanding. It's so damn tasty, you don't want to stop drinking them. Absolute stunner right here. Anderson Valley are masters of their craft."
"Extremely drinkable big stout. It's not an RIS so it doesn't just wallop you with hops or roast. It all comes together nicely and makes a good sipping beer or a great food beer. It's actually smooth enough that you might get people who ""won't drink stout"" to find some common ground here. One of my favorites of this style."
" This is my first time trying anything from Anderson Valley. If this is typical of their other products I will have to make more of an effort to track down their other offerings."
"Overall, my taste for this beer is lower than my ratings. It's a well done stout but not my style."
"Overall: Definitely worth a try if you're a fan of the style. Might be a little too strong for someone just starting out, but you'll never know unless you give it a shot."
"Pours a deep black with very few highlights. Dense coffee-foam head that fades to a dusting, then a ring, leaving no lace. Exceptionally volatile aromatics here -- I can smell this from 3 feet away. Bitter chocolates, sugared blueberries and subtle vanillas present themselves in the nose. On the palate, the hops bite first, followed by juicy fruits underlaid with not-very-bitter roasted malts. The hops and malts combine for a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is slick and only medium bodied, not heavy. Easy quaffed, this brew is something that offers an interesting flavor profile in a very easy going package -- which means I could put back many, many bottles of this in a night."
"The pour into my Sam Smith impy pint raises a one finger tan head with viscous lacing over an opaque black body. The head falls, over the course of a few minutes, to a thin glass ring. The nose is rich with caramel and hop scents, along with a sweet roasted aroma. There's also quite a bit of molasses in there, too. Taste is sweet and roasted, but without much bitterness. Finishes with a distinct mocha coffee note. The mouth is fairly heavy, and the low carbonation affords it an elegant smoothness. This is a fun oatey, not too complex, but very tasty."
"I would expect more flavor for a beer this dark."
"D: Good tasting, robust oatmeal stout. Probably awesome on nitro-tap--damn good in the bottle. I'd grab this again."
"This was my first Anderson Valley brew, and it did not disappoint. 22 oz bomber poured a deep, thick, black with a firm tan head that lingered a while and settled as a small ring where the liquid meets the glass. Nice lacing left throughout. Aromas have a roasted chocolate malt flavor and bit of sweet dried fruit. Flavors are heavy on the roasted chocolate and coffee end, with a nice balance of hop bitterness up front that then gets blasted by the deep roasted malt characters, a bit of earthy, bready grain flavor is also present on the back end. Overall a great stout with a thick, creamy mouthfeel and just smooth, smooth, smooth...outstanding."
"Pours a midnight black hue topped by a tall, thick, creamy brown head that takes its time receding. Aroma is lighter than you would expect from such a dark beer - light roasted malt, some sweet oats, and a touch of milk sugar. Palate is nice and rich - roasted malt, lactose and oatmeal sweetness, and just a mild hoppy bitterness towards the finish. Body is rich, smooth, and creamy - just wonderful. A very drinkable stout."
"Pours a jet black with a giant tan foamy head and leaving good whispy lacing. Very impressive looking. The smell has chocolate, coffee, with some malt sweetness. The taste is very rich with chocolate,coffee,dark fruit,and some smoked wood flavors. This is absolutely great tasting. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing very well. I can see why this is an award winner. This is a great beer and if you see it buy it."
"Highly drinkable stuff, love the style."
"Overall, it's quite nice and very drinkable. It's not overly complex, but it doesn't really need to be. There's enough going on within the play between dark malt and yeasty fruit to keep you interested; and it's rich enough to keep you coming back to it without overwhelming you beyond one serving. Nicely done!"
"12 oz. with a blurb on the back and no freshness date. It pours quite black with a half-inch of khaki head that leaves light lacing and smells of sweet oats, dark chocolate, and green/floral hops. On the palate it's slightly creamy and has roasted, coffee, milk chocolate, and burnt/charred malts combined with oats, leather, and green/grapefruit/pine hops that leave a medium bitterness on top of a light to medium body that is smooth/slick and fairly carbonated. Overall very nice - good malt and hop fix here."
"-Oelergud"
"D: I could drink quite a few of these. This is a wonderful beer."
"Drinkabillity: The first few sips go down way easy, but the hops and carbonation hold it back after awhile. I think this would be much better on tap, and I can't imagine how great it would be from a nitro-tap."
"Overall, this is a very good stout. The flavors are rich and hearty, with a nice level of hop character (something I personally feel most stouts lack, notwithstanding the style reputation). There is almost no alcohol presence, and it is very creamy. Highly recommended"
"This beer pours pitch black with a nice creamy off white head that dissipates to a thin film leaving a little lace behind. The smell is dark roasted chocolate and coffee but with some added sweetness that comes from the oatmeal. The taste hits you first with its roasted qualities. The chocolate and coffee flavors shine through. As the taste lingers in your mouth, however, it is taken over by its rather sweet qualities. This is quite enjoyable. The mouthfeel is nicely thick. It has a smoothness about the carbonation that complements the body well. Overall, a highly drinkable stout. A good one to pick up."
"D: Decent drinker."
"Recommended."
"Overall, a decent stout. More bitter and roasty than I was expecting from an oatmeal stout. This is a good beer, but nothing too special and a bit overpriced."
"Thickish and boldly roasted stout. Fine to share at end of meal, but was too much for earlier in the day or even with anything but dessert. Coffee in there. A tad sourish. Very dark. Bittersweet chocolate and nutty. Smooth but some grain on tongue.Dry finish."
"D: I don't consider this to be a stellar beer, but overall is very drinkable and enjoyable. Great taste and mouthfeel make this a nice one to keep around."
"Cheers!"
"Very drinkable."
"This beer pours a dark, dark brown color that is slightly translucent. Smell must be teased out, but it hints at sweet malt and dark grains. A slight tinge of alcohol as well. Taste is very surprising and refreshing for a west coast stout. Too many these days try to knock-you-off-your-feet with HUGE flavor, but this really appreciates the finer subtleties of taste. The dark grains leave a lingering taste in the mouth that is both sweet and bitter (sweet towards the middle of the tongue, bitter on the sides). There arent many complexities to the finish, which is why it loses points there. Overall a very solid stout."
"Really good drinkability; strong flavor that I look for in a stout and sits light on the stomach while still having a solid feel going down."
"Enjoy"
"This beer was a pleasant suprise for me because I was expecting a sweet stout which I am not crazy about. Instead what I got was a very well balanced beer with only the slightest hint of sweetness and a nicely balanced bitter finish (but not too bitter). Even my girlfriend who *hates* dark beer said it was ""not bad""."
"All in all a good sweet stout. Not necessarily a perfect example of the Oatmeas Stout style, but a good, drinkable stout nonetheless."
"D - Drinkable. I really enjoyed this brew, but the first sip was quite different after a few more sip's I loved it."
"Drinkability. It was a decent stout, but pretty much middle of the road. I could have a few but there are many better examples out there."
"Looks good. Nice and dark with a tan one finger head. This smelled and tasted very strongly of soy sauce. It was creamy and sweet but salty, which was distracting. Nice and smooth mouthfeel though! Very drinkable. However, there's other oatmeal stouts I prefer over Anderson's."
"overall very good, and thats coming from one whose favorite stout thus far is young's double choc:)"
"drinkablity: goes down a nice medium pace. it's not a fast drinker. Hands down the weakest of the anderson vallye regulars, and yet still very good. the anderson valley porter kills this beer however, and should be avalable year round in six packs. i don't think i'll get this one too often and then only a bomber from now on."
"Pours black with a brownish foamy head. Smells like natures heaven, roasted coffee, malts, even hazelnuts. The taste is exquisite. Has a rich roasted flavour, with a hint of caramel and coffee. This is a very robust stout, very smooth packed full of flavour. This brew is all good."
"Overall, I thought that it was good, but know of oatmeal and other stouts that are just as good or better for less the cost."
"Pours a near-black color with somewhat lacking head amount. Aroma is not exceptional, but has some roasted sweetness. Taste is good, sweet with a roasted bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is nice with good body and a clean feeling at the finish. A pretty drinkable oatmeal stout that's not too strong and has a pleasant taste and feel. Nothing that special really, though, either."
"Notes: I don't know man, this was just OK to me. I love a good stout and this one to me seems run of the mill. Pretty rich bodied, kinda milky yet the hops sharpen it up in the end west coast style. ehhh decent but for the style fairly forgettable."
"Black in colour with slightly lower than average carbonation. Very nice milk chocolate aroma, along with secondary notes of coffee. More of the chocolate and coffee thing in the mouth, along with some nice dark crystal malt notes and a touch of oatmeal sweetnes... although everything was a bit more muted than anticipated. Only medium bodied, which again, was a bit of a surprise. A solid beer, but not quite in the same class as some other stouts that Ive tried."
"Without a doubt this is a very drinkable oatmeal stout worth enjoying time after time."
"Pretty sessoinable. Great example of the style that really works. One of the best oatmeal stout's I've had, yummy& reccomended"
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable. Great malt character as well as hop profile. Fairly easy consumption. Kudos."
"a lovely full bodied and very flavorful stout. a definite must have."
"Lots of flavor and a healthy bit of body give it a full, creamy, with a bit of a twangy mouthfeel. Although it's easy to consume, this is a stout that fills you up, a nice after dinner kinda beer."
"drinkability: very drinkable stout"
"Poured a very deep brown color with reddish highlights. Nice creamy tannish head with modest lacing on the side of the glass. Smell is an enjoyable combination of roasted malt, coffee, bitter chocolate and caramel. Maybe a hint of molasses. Taste is very pleasant with strong coffee and chocolate notes, some dark fruitiness, and a bit of hop bitterness. Excellent combination. Very creamy mouthfeel, with a nice bitter chocolate finish. A very weel-done stout. Very enjoyable."
"D - Good, I wouldn't mind drinking a few of these. Easily sessionable. A great, fairly sweet, oatmeal stout."
"Rich and roasty. I wish the aroma was less burnt, but maybe its just the bottle. Very tasty...not the very best, but it's hard to find a really good oatmeal stout."
"My new favorite stout."
"Drinkability: This is a good rainy day beer - rich, creamy, and fortifying."
"Overall: A very nice stout, one I'll try again."
"Is that to say this is a beer you shoudl avoid? No. This is a solid beer. But there are better examples of the style out there that you may want to try first."
"Looks quite thick during the pour and ends up with only a slight dark tan head that dissipates fast. The overall color is quite black. Smell is strong. Very sweet like a mocha latte with a robust toasty aroma. Taste is much less sweet than anticipated from the smell. It starts out slightly smokey and toasty, with only subtle hints of the coffee and chocolate flavor. Finish is dry and only slightly bitter. Alcohol seems well hidden. The brew carries a nice thickness, but remains smooth with nice carbonation. It was easy to drink, although the flavor could have been a touch sweeter. This was not like most oatmeal stouts in this respect. I found it more comparable to a double stout, or imperial stout, yet not as strong. I definitely liked it though..."
"Musings: This is a great oatmeal. It's a little on the expensive side - but is substantial and filling. The taste is the thing here. You will be rewarded."
"Drinkability- Not liking this one as much as I thought. Much better oatmeal stouts out there in the market IMO."
"A very drinkable stout. Dare I even say this is ""mild""? Could possibly have a big crossover potential for Guinness fans."
"Drinkability: More more more!"
"Overall- A very robust Oatmeal Stout. This 1 has some balls to it. Very good- just wished it could of been a tad smoother."
"dark mahogany-tinged beer.. mocha colored ring around the edge. continental haze patterns on the surface. as i stare, i notice a dirty malt smell coming from the stout. earthy with unwashed, still-on-the-vine hops and balanced somewhat something creamy and nutty in the nose. taste is borderline excessive in its hoppiness and less creamy than i usually care for in an OS. although, the body is light and bubbly which is a decent compromise. weak coffee flavor and off botanical sourness in the finish. overall wish this was a fuller beer. not my favorite but still rather clean and flavorful. probably wont revisit."
"Aroma is mild chocolate, but it has some depth. Deep black. Pours nice, but the head fades too soon. Flavor is pretty big. Some tobacco in the fore followed by bitter bakers chocolate and medium roastiness throughout. Never gets around to being sweet really. Definitely more in the Foreign Stout side of a Sweet."
"Tasty and very drinkable; not only a great example of the style but probably Anderson Valleys best brew (of the ones that Ive tried anyway). Highly Recommended."
"On tap at the Toronado. Pours a dark, black stout with frothy tan head, good lacing. Rich, smooth, creamy and full bodied. Has some coffee and chocolate flavour. The oats give it a nice fluffiness. A mocha sweetness coats the tongue, and it finishes with tonnes of roastedness. A beer that drinks like a meal. Tasty."
"This beer has an interesting assortment of flavors, but there's more burntness than I like."
"This is stout the way I like it. It's rich and malty first, with a roasty-toasty backbone. The hopping level is restrained as it should be. It is bit of a surprise, though, how it can be so very, very dark without overtly bitter roast character. I have had this beer several times over the years and right now, it's not coming off as dry and sharp as I remember. This is not a bad thing, mind you. Comparing Barney Flats to the classic stout, Guinness, this is more malty, nowhere near as dry, less roasty-bitter and more fun to drink, nitrogen slow-pour be damned. That's simply not necessary here. I'd recommend it to stout drinkers anywhere."
"Overall, a fairly drinkable stout. It seems a little less ""oatmeal stout"" than I was perhaps expecting and more ""imperial"" or just ""stouty"". Still a very fine beer and definately recommended."
"A very friendly and satisfying stout. I like it a lot, its got all the right stuff."
"kick ass!"
"I really like this beer. It reminds me of a less sweet, slightly smoother Kalamazoo Stout. If we're talking about the first bottle, this beer is extremely drinkable--the flavor pulls you back until you're looking at the bottom of the glass. At a slower pace I could drink this all evening. Although the brewers suggest it, I find it a bit dry for dessert; I'd use it to replace your after-dinner coffee instead."
"Pours almost black but not quite. More like a super dark brown that only lets a shade of light in. The head was very dark but it fell very quickly. Smells like a sweet barley wine that has been roasted dark along with a slight brown ale sourness. Tastes of dry caramel, coffee, and chocolate. The overall flavor is dominated by the dryness. Mouth feel is dense and a bit lingering with a medium carbonation."
"Drinkability: The unaggressive nature, and overall smoothness of the oatmeal stout style certainly lends to an ease in drinkability. Do I ""love"" the beer? No, probably not. I do like it a great deal, though, as well as recommend it to others. Enjoy!"
"Cheers!"
"All in all, mouthfeel aside.... quite a good brew... maybe the thinness adds to the drinkability? I dunno... but I could see myself purchasing this many many times in the future."
"D: More of a nightcap than a session beer."
"This beer doesn't let any light through. It poured with a thick head. It had four finger potential but I was ill prepared and had to quickly sip some of it away. The smell is of roasted grain.. It also has a fairly bitter taste. It left lots of lacing. I would recommend this beer to anyone who likes dark beer. This would have to rank second in the Oatmeal Stout category for me. I will buy this beer again."
"Very dark with rich, brown highlights. The head reduces to a thin lace of fine bubbles quite quickly, leaving delicate lacing behind. Nice combination of roasted and chocolate in the nose, and there's a little bit of oat character as well. Malty sweet flavour with low bitterness, but a bit of hop flavour that creeps through at the mid-point. Dryish finish with some chocolate malt sweetness and some lingering acidity. Moderate carbonation and body that's a little on the thin side, but not watery, and a little bit slick. A tasty oatmeal stout, easily drinkable."
"The beer is incredibly easy to drink and quite flavorful. Quite a nice beer."
"overall: excellent oatmeal stout. i prefer this over samuel smith's version. tonsa flavors and complexities."
"Drinkability and Notes  This is a new favorite oatmeal stout for me, really solid in everything but the mouthfeel. If this was just a bit thicker I think it would be a true topnotch beer particularly for the price."
"Brown on top of brown. Fluffy tan head that flattens out to some pond scum after a brief hoorah. Scattered projections of lacing ensue. Smells of chocolate, cream, and ash. Taste is bitter chocolate and milky. I taste a smoke presence that adds some depth and a bit of dark fruitiness develops in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium. More than sturdy enough to support the flavors. Drinkability is good. This is a solid beer. It really improves as the glass gains some warmth and the flavors come out."
"Have some; any season (would be good by the fire watching football)."
"Definitely a good stout at 5.7 abv. and a very drinkable Oatmeal Stout, a variety I'll have to keep an eye on, for now this is a good version."
"Ummm, Ummm, ummm. Tasty! This has all of the appearances to rate it 4.5 - 5.0. It looks nerly perfect in its black color, dense lasting head, and low carbonation. nlocks aromas of sweet cocoa, roasted, toasted grains, dark rich fruit, mild lactic tartness, and moderate coffee aromas. Tastes even better. Silky smooth chocolate and roasted malt. Just enough coffe flavors to give it some testicles. The oats really milds the flavors and texture. This has a big rich body, just short of putting it into a Imperial Stout category. Nice nutty flavors along with slight cherries woven into the alcohol. Finishes long, sweet, and modestly bitter. I beleive I'll have another."
"This is a good drinkable stout. Recommended if you can't get an even more drinkable stout for the price, such as Sierra Nevada."
"If one likes big, flavorful stouts, this is very drinkable. It might be a tad filling for repeated pints however. Nevertheless it is a tasty treat. Probably ideal for a dessert beer, as it's bitter aspects are perfectly matched by sweet chocolate flavor."
"-Perfect Oatmeal stout...thick, rich, creamy and sweet...a unique taste I can't identify(maybe the oats?)"
"Drinkability - Very smooth. A pretty solid stout. I like Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout a little bit more, but I would drink this one again."
"Thanks to my wife who knows that I love stouts, she saw this one at the store, and didn't remember that I had ever had it around so she picked up a sixer for me. I think I will rate her BETTER than Good !"
"A highly drinkable stout. Give it a try."
"This is a big, roasty stout, yet very smooth and drinkable. Had it on tap at the new Hop Devil Grill. As it warmed the roasty flavors made themselves known, and there was a lot of hops to balance out the malt roastiness. Finishes smoothly, with roasted malt aftertaste. Maybe the best oatmeal stout I have tried yet."
"Pitch black body with a huge caramel head. The head really stuck around and was impressive, very dark and rich. There was some good lacing too, very nice to look at. Malty aroma with sweet, date like qualities too it. Pleasant, but not outstanding. Incredibly smooth and creamy. Lots of milk and toasty flavors. Mocha and toffee come out as well. I didn't get a lot of hop flavoring here, but that's fine. Very smooth, tasty, drinkable stout."
"Overall Impression: Mmm hoppy oatmeal. Easy to drink, but not earthshaking. A good quencher. Thanks to Pegasus for sharing the bottle."
"Thanks to Sebastian for hand carrying this from California."
"Pours a solid black, with no light penetration, and a thick brown head that retains nicely, you can tell this one's gonna be good. Smell is thick and ripe, big coffee, chocolate and roasted malt overtones with hints of dark fruit and molasses. Taste matches the aroma well, big coffee, dark chocolate and roasted flavors come through with a dark currant background and a light molasses flavor. The mouthfeel is thick and very smooth, a nice oatmeal stout for sure, the finish is slightly sweet and lingering. The drinkablilty is pretty high despite this being an oatmeal stout because of the extremely smooth mouthfeel."
"Overall a solid American representation of this style. Absolutely one of the freshest and appetizing scents of any bottled stout I've had to date. Very well constructed and sturdy from one of the cornerstone micro's out west. Hats off to another fine ale from AVBC!"
"This is the best oatmeal stout I have had, and I have had quite a few. While this is not as smooth as many, it has such a pronounced flavor while still maintaining the silky smoothness indicative of the style. For a hophead this is also a satisfying oat stout. Killer beer, I can session these all night long and feel decadent as hell."
"Your typical oatmeal stout. Nothing special here, but a pretty good representation of the style. Poured out to dark brown coffee like color with a caramel colored head. Odors of coffee, malt and a touch of sugar, all very light. Flavor is that of cocoa, oats and an overall roasted tone to the taste. Finished slightly sweet, and quite thick. Not bad, but I would go with Samuel Smith. Worth a try."
"Pours a very black color but certainly not the ""pitch black"" you find in some stouts. Decent head that quickly receedes. Low aroma-some roasted malt and what I can only assume is a copious amount of oats. Almost cookie like. Nice roasted flavor with a slight bitterness. Some coffee flavor. Velvety smooth though just a tad thin. A fine example of an oatmeal stout."
"Pours dark as night, with a good head on it's shoulders (although it diminishes quickly. Smell is good, some buttery aromas are there, but it's mostly sweet chocolate aroma. Taste it full, mostly chocolate malt, some butterscotch as well. Nice, thick and just the right level of carbonation in my book. This one is a solid beer."
"NIce very dark brown short lived head. Almost black in color. Nice aromas of coffee, earthiness, and chocolate. The carbonation in this beer is done well. Nice smooth, almost silky mouthfeel. Nice flavors as well. Flavors of coffee, soil like earthiness, oatmeal of course, and the perfect touch of hoppiness. I really like this oatmeal stout."
"I always enjoy an Anderson Valley beer. This one was no exception. Pours a deep dark black with shades of brown and red around the edges. Nice puffy brown head. Smells like singed barley and malt. Taste is equally roasty and malty. Lighty hopped too, with some buttery flowery statements. There's a really nice milky creamy quality to this one, which I love. Real smooth medium mouthfeel, lighter and not as thick as most stouts. Definate plus. And as a result of the more medium mouthfeel and texture it's less filling and super drinkable. I actually finished the whole sixer last night. I meant to save half for the Red Sox opener tonight, oops. Guess I'll have to scrounge between the cusions for change and go buy more goodness."
"This brew poured to a deep dark brown to almost black color with a fair sized dark brown head that had fair retention and lacing. The brew had aromas of roasted malts, caramel, chocolate and coffee. Nice smelling brew but I am having a hard time picking up much in the way of an oatmeal essence. The taste is very nice, roasted malts and chocolate are the first thing that I notice with highlight of caramel and coffee. Also notice the up front tastes breaking to a hop-ness that goes well with this brew. Not the best oatmeal stout or even stout I have had but a solid offering."
"This beer pours a dark mohogany. The head is slightly dark tan. It fades fast leaving minimal laces. From the second I opened the bottle, I was assulted by a strong malty aroma. It smells of roasted malts and chocolate. Slight coffee smell also. Maybe a hint of caramel. It tastes sweet. Malty with a good coffee flavor. It is rather creamy. It coats the inside of my mouth with a creamy, sweet layer. It goes down smooth. Good carbonation. This beer would make an excelent session beer because it is low in alcohol. Also, the flavor is not overly aggressive, but it is not too bland. If you see this beer, you should at least try it. I will buy it again. Good oatmeal stout."
"This is a rather good oatmeal stout. Pours from the bottle pitch black. A beautiful foamy tan head forms and lasts for a resonable amount of time. The smell is mild, with just hints of the mixture of sweet malts and bitter hops containted within. The taste is good but not exceptional. Mouthfeel is certainly smooth but seems somewhat thin. A stout worth checking out if the opportunity arises. Enjoy."
"Lacked the body I was searching for, and the carbonation seemed slightly off. It is good, but I was unfortunately unimpressed. This beer lacked something that would make you say ""ah!"" which is what I think really matters."
"Bottle. Really liked this one. Heaps of flavour. Malts are porridgey, cooky-ish, roasted, sweetish to start, finishes bitter and slightly off-dry, long finish, tasty stout. Re-rate:Didn't like it as much this time, not as much flavour as i remembered the first time round. Still nice."
"Darkness imprisoning me all that I see absolute horror, whoops - that's another song...Darkness descends into the glass, it appears black, held against natural light I can see dark brown tones. The head is a pleasing tan foam which leaves a lace trail on the glass as I drink more. This stout smells great, lots of java and dark malt in the nose. The flavors that register first are roasted malts, with traces of dark chocolate and coffee. The hop bitterness shines through the more this sits in the mouth. I enjoyed this Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout on a cold overcast Saturday afternoon with a small dish of coffee ice cream with fresh banana slices."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Well balanced all around. Easy to go for a second pint."
"Drank one of these babies after a North Coast Old 38 Stout, there's no comparison. It's black as midnight with a rocky milk chocolate colored head that has remarkable retention and leaves some patchy lace. Succulant malty aromas of dark, toasted grain, creamy caramel, dark fruits (cherries, plums), and chocolate. Taste is all that and then some! Lots of creamy caramel and chocolate flavors, buttery and bitter-sweet. Notes of dark, pit-fruits, creme-brule, figs, and raisens. There's the requisite oatmeal creaminess and texture. Mouthfeel is big and chewy, body is big. Oily and thick, just the way I like it. Finish is creamy, silky, and lush. Overall, a super stout. I'd love to see it on nitro-draft."
"The taste is certainly the best thing about this brew. The appearance and smell are nothing special. But it has that oatmeal stout look which makes it somewhat appealing to me. I like this beer though. It's one Anderson Valley's better ones. And it's good not pay $9 a six-pack for it (goes for no more than $7.49 around here). All in all, in conclusion, to wrap it up, I've bought this beer many times in the past, and I'd buy it many more times in the future."
"Pitch black with a creamy sticky brown head. Smells like sweet coffee with a little hops. Oh my God, I love the taste of this beer. It has a thick and creamy (almost chewy) chocolate and roasted coffee flavor. The sweetness is blalanced well with some spicy hops. I love this beer that is all I have to say! Expensive, but well worth it! I could drink the beer for breakfast!"
"Final Thought: Yummy, one of my favorite styles shines in the tasting spotlight, this is a damn good beer."
"Still, if this were available more readily in NYC, I'd have it on hand all the time."
"Sampled off tap last Wednesday. The beer came a nice black color with a finger of tan head that sticks around nicely as I drank the beer. The nose had a lot of chocolate and creamy oat character and a touch of coffee, though a touch too weak for my taste. The flavor was creamy chocolate and a bit of coffee on the finish, though all together a bit light. The feel was thick and creamy and smooth. Nice all around. Overall, a very solid offering from Anderson Valley, though maybe just a touch too thin for my senses on the flavor and nose."
"Barney Flats may very well be the best oatmeal stout I have ever tried. Solidly balanced with lots of flavor, yet smooth and drinkable. Wow!"
"Beer is good. Happy American West coast Oatmeal Stout beering."
" My first oatmeal stout so I dont have a comparison to make. I do like this . Even with oatmeal and coffee, Im not sure its breakfast food ."
"12 ouncer sampled, looks like a stout, just a glint of light on the edges, tan head, moderate lacing sliding down the sides of the glass. Nose is malt and burnt malt. Nice roasted flavors, slick oily mouthfeel. Drying hoppy finish with more burnt notes, decent OS, good sessioner for stout lovers."
"12 ounce bottle. Pours out very dark with a small brown head. The aroma is sweet, like brown sugar and molasses. Flavor is roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee. Sweet, but not too sweet. Some hop bitterness and flavor as well. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. This beer doesnt taste like oatmeal, but oatmeal stouts rarely taste like oatmeal to me. Nevertheless, this is a good example of an oatmeal stout."
"I had this on tap at the Harmony Inn in historic Harmony, PA. Very dark beer, wint some reddish color around the edges. Had a nice brown head, that fell after a few minutes and left minimal lacing. The smell was of chocolate, coffee beans and roasted malts. The taste was of dark coffee and some chocolate. The mouthfeel was rich and creamy, and very drinkable. This is a fine example of an oatmeal stout."
"Not very complex, but damn good. Overall, a very dark and burnt tasting stout. Good stuff."
"you wont be dissapointed by this beer, big flavor if not ""full feeling"" enough compared to others of this style, but a very tasty brew anyway you cut it."
"Drinkability: I could handle a couple of these in one sitting."
"Poured a black as night color but has a dissapointing head. Nose is of traces of coffee and chocolate. Taste is very solid, starts with a creamy chocolate coffee flavor and it finishes with a chocolate coffee dry hopped finish. Mouthfeel is good for it's style, creamy smooth and reasonably full. Drinkability is near perfect for it's style. I can enjoy a few more of these but unfortunately I am out. Will have to try this again!"
"Pours a midnight black with a tiny brown collar of a head. Smells very fresh and bobust. Nice malted notes shining through predominately. Tastes like caramel and chocolate made love and this is their love child. Great. Smooth and clean and robust. Strong and ass-kickingly delicious this is not a beer for the meek. Once again Anderson Valley has represented a style very well. A very dark, very heavy, and very profound tasting beer. This will put you in your place and teach you a thing or two before the glass is finished. And thats good."
"A very nice balance of roasty chocolate malts, hop bitterness, and sweetness. Very smooth, probably thanks to the oatmeal. Finally, that bittersweet aftertaste. Quite enjoyable."
"A fantastic stout, especially for sessions."
"A bit on the thin side I thought for an oatmeal stout, but developed to have some tenuous body. Something tangy and not too together."
"poured black with a very little head that didnt last long so no lacing. aroma, molasses, chocolate, malts, alcohol,hints of coffee. flavor malts, dark fruits, raisins, molasses, cherry hints a caramel and honey. not like other oatmeals I have had not bad."
"Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout is a polished, well-rounded stout that, as far as I'm concerned, gives Samuel Smith's version a run for its money. It isn't quite flavorful enough or distinctive enough to be considered truly great, but it disappeared with frightening ease. Good stuff."
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy dark brown head that slowly fades. The aroma is good. It has a nice toasted scent that boasts of crystal and chocolate malts. It is sweet smelling with a touch of hops. The taste is good also. It has a dry dark malt flavor that is slightly sweet and has a bit of hops in the aftertaste. The oats add a bit of texture to the flavor and mouthfeel. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine oatmeal stout. It has excellent taste and aroma; good drinker."
"My expectations were high as I waited to try this stout last in a flight of 5 5 oz. tastes. Maybe I was hoping for too much but I was not disappointed. Fantastic sensations of flavors in the mouth and rather easy to drink (although not all evening). Appeared not as dark as some traditional stouts. Hints of chocolate and caramel more noticeable in the smell than in the overall taste. Enjoyed it but would like to compare to other oatmeal stouts."
"Pours a deepest brown color with a thick, light brown colored head. Lacing is minimal. Aromas of chocolate and black patent malts, rolled oats, semi-sweet dark chocolate, toffee and a hint of meadowy hops. Roasty assault up-front, followed with a mellow malt smoothness that's enriched with clean flavors of oat and finishes off with the combination of drying hop bitterness and the bitterness of scorched malts. Mainly sweet, overall, but dry enough in the finish that it makes it drinkable. Oat seems used in this beer not as a flavor profile, moreso an agent to mellow and smooth out the whole experience which would come across as just a hoppy stout. Well done."
"this is one tasty treat of an oatmeal sout. it was my first sampling of an anderson valley brew and now certainly not to be my last. let's hope all their brews are up to these standards. it pours an awesome near black colour with a hearty, though mid-sized, head on top. the smell is mainly sweet (oat, chocolate, caramel) anlong with some roasted noted here and there. very well done and nicely balanced as well. the flavour is fairly close to the smell, though i think the roasted malt may come out a bit more here. it is still predominantly a sweet tasting brew, with creamy chocolate and caramel throughout. the finish is of the slightly dry earth kind. very tasty. the mouthfeel is a bit thinner than many of the oatmeal stouts that i have sampled in the past, but still nothing to scoff at and still well done, just worth noting. yum."
"This poured out with an opaque black body and a dark tan smallish head. The head quickly died leaving little lace in its wake. Smells of roasted malt and dark chocolate fill the nose. Taste is similar with a bitter dark chocolate flavor backed by a slight grainy taste and some caramel. The finish is bitter with a roasted hoppy flavor that is dry. The body is medium to full with a slick mouthfeel. This went down fairly easy with a very filling quality about it that would discourage me from having another in the same session but I would definitely pick this one up again. Its a good oatmeal stout but not one of my favorites."
"Very drinkable for such a heavy brew."
"Nearly solid black liquid with a thin and creamy brown head. Roasted barley and hop aroma. Smells of coffee, smoke, and touch of hops. Some oatmeal stouts have a notable oat smell. Although that quality is present here, it is very subdued. The beer is grainy and rough-edged. Roasted barley flavors follow-through. Oat sensation, again, is muted. Chocolate and grain are prominent. Moderately bitter, with a lingering finish. The beer is full, with considerable heft and richness. Medium carbonation. This is a very drinkable, solidly good stout."
"Beautiful onyx in it's color capped with about a finger of beige head. The smell was of roasted almonds, coffee and hints of chocolate. The taste was fantastic. Deep chocolate, vague hints of malt and coffee with a gracious settling of hops - very little. Slick creamy and chewy this had a nice way of coating with residue. Extremely dinkable, I can't wait to pair this in the winter with a nice roast or steak."
"Overall: outstanding oatmeal stout. A must try for this style and for stout lovers all over the planet!!"
"A very tasty, robust stout. The oatmeal is barely noticed except for contributing a pleasantly smooth drinkability. One of the better American stouts that I've enjoyed."
"Drinkability: This is a great oatmeal stout and very drinkable for a beer of this style"
"Drinkability: I love this style...but the more I drank of this bottle (and the warmer it got), the less I liked it. serve it cold...and keep it cold!"
"Black with a small light brown head that doesn't ever fully leave. Sweet smelling with a touch of coffee. Earthy flavors up front. I even get a hint of alcohol. Coco, dirt and oats start our smooth then turn bitter leaving me with a coffee like after taste. Oatmeal stout like mouthfeel, nice and chewy. Glad I tried it, but I don't see myself seeking it out in the future."
"I don't know. If you haven't tried this, it's definitely worth a chance."
"Drinkabillity: Pretty good beer, nice to drink good job."
"Poured out a black color with a little carbonation. Smell consisted of coffee, some hops and a little bit of alcohol. Taste was a little too hoppy I thought for an oatmeal stout. There's nice roasted flavors in this beer, but there wasn't enough of sweetness to this beer. It's almost like a mini-imperial stout. But all in all, not a bad stout, but I'll take a Sammy Smith oatmeal stout any day."
"This has got to be the first beer I've actually smelled the alcohol in. Or maybe my nose and palate are becoming more refined ;) Beer is an inky black/brown, completely opaque in my glass, which for me is the first sign of a good beer. However, for a stout, I found this one to be just a little too hoppy (not bitter, mind you, just hop-flavored) for my taste in a stout. Head was little to non-existant, but I'm not good at pouring beer, so I try not to hold that against any brew. Overall, I'd buy this one again for variety, but it's not on my top favorites list."
"Talk about balance -- this beer has it down."
"IMHO: A much better balanced stout than I expected. Not an over-the-top-hop experience."
"The mouthfeel was smooth. The roasted malts and oatmeal lasted on the tongue for 20 seconds after swallowing. This is a medium bodied stout as it it slightly thinner than others but has a great flavor. Nicely drinkable and you won't get bored with this."
"This beer is described as being full-bodied, but I'd step it down a notch, just about medium-bodied. Quite smooth and refreshing, I could easily drink a few of these in a night. I really enjoyed this beer as it stands out in front of many other stouts that lack the complexity that should be present. Makes the front page in my stout list."
"Very drinkable for a stout."
"Beef Notes: I'd say this is a good example of a bad use of smoke flavor in beer. If it wasn't for that, this would probably be a fine beer. Since it is for that, I will not be drinking this beer again any time soon."
"Medium bodied with a smooth, creamy mouthfeel and great carbonation. Excellent drinkability."
"The roast carried over directly to the flavour, with a tad of hops and malt to go along for good measure. Though the mouthfeel was good and thick the flavour was more mild that I'm used to for a stout, which I partially attribute to the low alcohol content while the drinkability was solid all the way."
"Not much of a head on this particular pour--fades to swirling, spotty, khaki residue with a tiny collar that leaves a bit of an oozy cling and faint lace. (Disclaimer--I have, with previous servings, encountered rich, billowing heads on this beer that really make for a handsome sight.) Color is near opaque black, but the tiniest of ebony highlights are in fact there. And then--chocolate syrup and malted milk flood the nose! with a nosefeel of light, frothy cream--Milk Duds! Somehow, it doesn't cross the line into cloying, because halfway through, these aromas turn raisiny as delicate bitternesses of hops and roast coffee come to weigh in against the extravagant chocolate and malt. More chocolate-covered raisin flavors up front become a bit smokier and more bitter at point of swallow, with a bit more hop in the aftertaste, softly. Where's the oatmeal, you ask? Patience... for with time and warmth, the flavors almost... ""settle"" into oat, dark bread, even a bit of peanut. Quite a smooth transition between these elements. Mouthfeel is lightly milky with a good deal of carbonation, but less chewy/mealy than some other Oatmeal Stouts. This is quenchy rather than coating, with a less residual character. However, this boosts the drinkability. I can (and did) spend the first bottle exploring and the next five bottles quaffing! A superior brew all around, I would highly recommend this to newcomers to the style."
"This is one I've been meaning to review for a while, and fortunately got my chance. A good oatmeal stout, and if not my favorite in the style, is still up there, and one I'd have again."
"Holy Lord, this is one kick arse stout! I was simply amazed with the smell and taste, as well as everything else. The only prob with it, is that it's a little on the heavy side, so it fills you up rather quickly, but then again, isn't that what a Oatmeal Stout is all about? Hell Yeah! When I drink stuff like this, I just want to lock myself up in the house and drink it all day long. That probably wouldn't be too healthy, but oh well, you only live once. The appearance was super dark, with a tan head that stayed around the whole beer. The smell and taste had caramel and chocolate hints to them, which matched up perfectly. The alcohol was barely present in the taste, which made it even more enjoyable. This was really smooth and coated your throat like whiskey and honey. If you have a shot at this stuff, don't let it get away!!!"
"This was one well crafted oatmeal stout. The texture was very silky and creamy. The flavors were balanced and no one flavor was overbearing. Espresso was probably dominant but chocolate and oatmeal were both there as well as some earthy flavors in the background. This was also slightly roasted which provided a nice added element to the beer. Simply world class quality brewing."
"This beer poured an almost pitch black/brown color; no light penetrated the glass that I could see except on the pour. The head that was produced was a light to medium brown color, that was pretty dense and thick. You could stick your finger in it and have a small peak present. It was sticky and full, as well as the lace that was formed, when dried on the sides it had to be scrapped off the glass. The aromas that came from the glass were of roasted and sweet malt, oatmeal and oat grain, black coffee, toffee and chocolate. The taste that was dancing across my tongue were of roasted malts and coffees, light hops (which I swear were toasted) were on the bitter side, sweet chocolates, oat grains, and it ended with a combination of sugar coffee (black), some cocoa, and more roasted flavors which was dry in the finish. The aftertaste was mostly of a roasted grain and coffee. The body was on the heavy side, and very enjoyable. The mix of sweetness, roastiness and dryness was very pleasing. It was creamy on the tongue and quite smooth and easy going down. I like the way they combined the coffee, the chocolate flavors and the light oatmeal flavors to create this enjoyable beer. Very drinkable for the season."
"On the darker side. A good tan head stays in control, but isn't too small. Really tight bubbles. The aroma is surprisingly dominated by lemon zest hops under which lurks dark malt aromas. The flavor is dry, fairly light and while some roast is apparent up front, in the back a mild hop bitterenes lingers with a pale malt flavor."
"Great stout! Beer poured opaque with a brown head, which didn't hold long. Creamy, thick mouthfeel with tastes of espresso and bittersweet chocolate. Great dessert beer, probably too rich for many more than one. If you like stouts, you will not be disappointed with this one!"
"The flavor is very smooth and chocolaty and layered with the pleasant bitterness from the roasted malts. The body is velvety and light to medium in texture. Not as chocolaty as Rogues CS, this one is more mellow. Overall, this is a beautiful looking and great tasting stout. Not too sweet or dry or overbearing in any way. Its just right. Highly recommended."
"Pours a dark leathery brown, settles opaque black, medium cocoa brown head fluffs up from a vigorous pour and subsides some to a thin haze and a fluffy sponged collar on top, lace in inkblots. Smell is quite mild and subdued of light chocolatey sweetness with a bit of roastyness and oat tangy sweetening. Taste is very mild with a persistant chocolatey sweetness that sets the overall tone with small notes of oats and roasted malts and faint touches of coffee. Finishes with a bit of drying roastyness and cocoa and a clean milding crispness. Feel is a solid medium body with no real characteristics of sweetness lingering or standing out any where, overall just a smooth somewhat creamy, chocolatey pensive quality. The chocolate tones are very nice; its a fine drinker, quite smooth and easy with a nice chocolateyness. Right up there with Black Widow."
"paid $3.49 for a bomber."
"A very fine looking stout that is rich tasting and has a great aroma. The very dark body is crowned by a voluminous beige head that lasts very well and creates some nice lacing. The nose is full of fine chocolate aroma gives a very rich sense. The flavor is very heavily dark chocolate with subtle roasting notes and a very fine bittering added to the sweetness from the rich malt base. The feel is just a bit thin but very appropriate to the style. This is one fine oatmeal stout with good drinkability."
"A nice sweet stout. Its very dark in color with a large foamy head that doesn't really dissapate very quickly. There is a nice bitter sweet smell which complements the taste nicesly. Nice and thick body with a good bitter aftertaste but the initial taste is sweet moving toward tart and then ending bitter. Overall a very nice oatmeal stout."
"Black with ruby edges when held up to light. Thick creamy dense head that diminishes quickly but lingers. Has a nice cookie dough aroma with roasted malt. Body is smooth and medium to full. Flavor is a bit weak with roasted malt in the foreground. Has slight bitterness and finishes dry. Not as sweet as I'd like it to be. Overall a quality beer though."
"I wished for a little more oatmeal flavor and texture to the beer."
"On tap poured into a pint glass. It pours a deep black color with two fingers of caramel colored head. There is lots of lacing left on the glass. The smell is sweet and malty with caramel and toffee. Just a hint of coffee aroma as well. The taste is fairly sweet with coffee and chocolate. There is also some toffee to the taste, and a tiny bit of hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is very thick and strong, but super smooth. The drinkability is also very nice. A darn good oatmeal stout!"
"Pours very thick with pitch black color and small tan head. A very faint hoppy aroma is detected. Taste is dark chocolate malts and hops. It seems that there is someting missing, and I think it's sweetness to balance the hops. Overall the flavor, like the aroma, is weak. It's kind of like a hybrid between sam smith's oatmeal and rogue shakespeare, but not nearly as good as either. The mouthfeel is like liquid silk, and drinkability is pretty stellar as well. It's got potential but needs a more interesting and complex flavor."
"Completly black, even to the light, with a huge dark brown head topping it off. Smells great with a nice roasted malt scent. Very smooth feel, with some roasted malts dominating the scene. Nice hop balance, pretty subtle. Nice amount of lacing here. This is a solid oatmeal stout."
"Smells weakly of dark malt, coffee, and a hint of licorice. The taste is very smooth. You get the dark barley/malt and coffee up front with a nice creamy sweet oatmeal/hop finish at the back. Not a bad brew, but definitely not worth the 8-9 dollar a six price. Thank God for singles."
"Notes: Growing on me."
"Poured almost black, showed very little head retention,aroma was much weaker than I expected,but then it hit me, a strong thick chocolate and roasted malt taste, the second taste was equally glorious,with a wonderful, wonderful aftertaste. Top notch, will be permanently stocked"
"i poured an opaque black with a tan sandy head. nice retention, but very little lace, they were there but drifted on down back to the head, it was cool so no points off (could i give it a 4.3?). i noted very vibrant scents. very floral and rosey hop scent that goes very well with the 'darker' scents of this beer. the darker scents are complex for me and i'll describe them as slightly bready and with a great oat smell, some nuttiness and a hint of leather. also i'd like to sight some orange and grape in there somewhere. i smelled this beer for a long time but it never did anything but bewitch me. on the flavor i'll have to say it's straight ahead and top flight! a very nice black coffee and cocoa with a nice dry toastiness. the finish is electric tasting and there is only a bit of sweet on the end. the mouthfeel was sturdy but also light (yes). i can't describe how many of these i'm looking forward to drinking, i'll say it's going to be a new staple of mine but for who knows how long, with a beer like this i may just retire right now. the amazing thing for me when i was considering drinkability was the great balance this beer has. i'll be back!"
"Pours a rich, dark brown, with an appetizing light brown head. Smells of sweet, oaty, malts, figs, and a little alcohol--not too aromatic. Taste is semi-sweet buttery malts, with an increasing chocolatey roastiness, and a slightly bitter finish. Very smooth. A good session stout!"
"Overall, not too bad but going off too far toward a burnt taste that was off-putting. Not one I'll hurry back to."
"Egad..I think I'm becoming a stout fan (especially good stout like this one). Almost black appearance with an ample creamy head. Great aromas of malt, coffee and smoke followed by a full-bodied smooth taste....coffee, with a hint of tang from the roasted malt. Good mouthfeel....smooth and full. Very drinkable. Stout lovers...definitely try this one."
"A nice drinkable Oatmeal stout..will buy again."
"Highly drinkable with interesting combination of flavors, kudos to Anderson Valley for holding back the hop bitterness which is probably hard for them. So easy to drink which is surprising from a company that typically uses strong hop flavors."
"This is one of the better sweeter stouts I have had in a quite awhile,pours a deep brown not quite black with a nice looking almond colored head.Aroma is very earthy and of bitter chocolatetaiste is lightly sweet but not overpowering by any means with some nice earthiness and french roast coffee.A real nice brew on a cooler day like today,very nice."
"A pitch black beer with a brown quickly dissipating head. Quite a roasted aroma to it, coffee and notes of biscuits. Quite smooth, finishes with a hint of acidity. A very smooth roast character, the brewer left out the astringency that can often be found in roasted beers. Not as thick bodied as some examples but still quite nice. As this beer warms up it develops some malty complexity."
"This beer pours a very dark color with a moderately fluffy tan head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is a burned malt and coffee smell. The flavor has a very unnecessary hop character with the most prominent flavor being the roasted malts and coffee. I really did not enjoy this beer because it reminded me more of a porter than it did a sweet stout. The hops gave it a bite where it should have been smooth and easy to drink."
"Black in color with a nice well-retained head. Aroma is very chocolatey with a bit of roasted quality. Taste is very sweet. Chocolate stands out the most. Slight floral hop taste in the finish, but overall a very sweet brew. There aren't many oatmeal stouts out there, but this one rivals even the most well known of them."
"Cool."
"Dark brown almost black color, decent size light brown lasting head, chocalate and burnt coffee aroma. Dark roasted malty chocolate- burnt coffee flavors, medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel, starts sweet and ends with a nice bitter roasty finish with a noticable hop bite, good stuff here."
"A very well crafted and thoughtout stout."
"Increadibly rich, creamy, and smooth with a slightly light body for a stout, but great non the less. Tastes of sweet malt, bitter coffee, and hops. Finishes slightly dry and bitter and goes down very smooth."
"Oh, Barney Flats, he was a good man....oh wait, that's Barney Fife, anyways on to the beer. Pours out into a nice black stout with cappucino colored head standing about 1/4"" thick. Roasted malts and chocolate dominate, but I also pick up scents of the oatmeal and coffee. Pick up scents? What am I a trail man? Concentrate, dang me. Nice, smooth, and boy there are some hops to be tasted at the end. Initially, the caramel and chocolate malts are all I taste but as the brew works back, the coffee undertones chime in nicely, and then, out of nowhere a little hop bite at the end. A good combination. A smooth beer, not outstanding, but good. The sweet chocolate, creamy feeling comes crawling in after a feel sips, now I am hell bent on Dairy Queen. Ah, beer and ice cream, I wish there was a planet of thee just for me."
"Note: 3 cheers to fellow BA PhantomVoDoo (he know about the whole ""VoDoo"" thing already...) for this one."
"Drinkability - It's only 5.7%, and until the novelty wears off, I'd drink the hell out of it. This beer represents, in a bottle, why I like to try new beers. I like to find the ones that are not necessarily the front runner of the style, but are certainly the most unique."
"Dark black color, medium head. Slight caramel aroma. Deeply roasted malts, slight chocolate and coffee flavor, not very oaty. Smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Lighter bodied Oatmeal Stout. Very drinkable."
"Pours a pitch black with an evaporating head, excellent lacing. Some chocolate and coffee beans aroma are present here. Initial taste of some chocolate, chicory, light coffee taste are delicious. Some dark roasted malts are noted, towards the end some carbonation is detected, but does not take anything away from the quality. A pleasant dry and charcoal like finish make this an appetizing oatmeal stout."
"Luckily, the sourness dimishes as the beer warms, and it becomes much more drinkable."
"Wow, big flavor in this one. Pours jet black with a wispy tan head. Mild, sweet coffee aroma with some chocolate. Taste is both tangy and sweet. Roasted flavor with hops. Finish is tangy. This stuff is brutal. Definitely good for a nightcap, but there's no way you can pound down any more than two of these (if that). Still, this is good stuff."
"The prodigious, creamy, dark tan head sits upon a beer which is utterly black in color. Its one of those heads where you can tell, just by looking at it, that its not going anywhere  itll lace your glass all the way down to the bottom. The aroma is coffee-like, with the standard roasty malt notes, and a somewhat bready scent. The flavor is smooth, hearty and dominated by a roasty graininess. An extremely pleasant chocolate sweetness develops mid-palate, but is more than balanced by a coffee-like roastiness, and a bittersweet, dryish finish. A wonderfully balanced beer, and eminently drinkable."
"I could come back to this beer again and again. What a stout!"
"Artistic label with background info on back label. Pours deep and dark with little carbonation and a dark tan head that quickly disappears. Aroma is mix of chocolate, caramel, and roasted barley malts. Starts like a dry stout then the chocolate and caramel malts kick in on the back of the tongue, dries out a bit, again and finally leaves a roasted malt/licorice like aftertaste. Mouthfeel is dry for a stout at first, then hits you with body. I like this because it's a good balance between dry/bitter and malty/full flavored."
"Barney Flats poured a flat dark with a very dark tan head and a clingy lace. The smell abounded with aromas of sweet chocolate, burnt wood and smoke. I was expecting a more oatmeal flavor, however, but all I got was a bitter coffee some toffee and more of the chocolate and smoke flavors. The mouthfeel was thick. If the taste can be worked up to where the smell is now this will become a much better beer, but for now I will stick with Heart of Darkness or a Sammy Smiths."
"A deep, dark pour, with very little head, and no lace. Nice subtle, sweet aroma, with a hint of alcohol, and a lot of bubbles on the side (much carbonation, it appears). On first drink, carbonation is very evident. The taste of the hops is evident throughout, from beginning to end. Not very complex, this is a consistently nice tasting brew, with a pruney aftertaste. On final analysis, its not terribly complex, but definately worth a taste."
"Pours a beautiful deep black, with a thick dark tan head, quickly receeding to leave pretty srong lace. Aroma is lightly chocolate, some roasted malt (coffee, a little caramel), and some decent floral hops tacked on for good measure. Flavor is sweet, chocolate, some caramel, in the middle some roasted coffee, and ends with a good hoppiness. Body is medium, slightly creamy mouthfeel. Maybe more hops that I expect from a stout, but being a hophead, I welcome them."
"Poured it into a glass and it looked like the black hole of beer ... no light could escape this liquid. As I got to the bottom it turned to a nice deep reddish brown. The head was tan and creamy but it went away rather quickly much to my disappointment. Nice rich stout taste which stayed around for a while after each sip. I would not call it an aftertaste as much as a warm feeling in my mouth. This stout was also nice and smooth. I drank one while I ate a few small pieces of good german chocolate, which improved the already wonderful taste of both."
"This beer poured a jet black color with obvious viscocity and a thick brown head with medium retention and lace. The smell was mainly of chocolate malts, with other usual stout characteristics. The taste is absolutely awesome - a combination of sweet, creamy chocolate and a touch of bittering hops at the end. The rich, velvety mouthfeel simply added to this luxurious taste. A definite must buy for dark beer fans. As the label says, ""It's not just shy sluggin' gorms neemer!"" I would have to agree."
"Big, thick, cocoa brown head, and a color as black as the night. Aromas of chocolate, and espresso. Texture and mouthfeel are ideal for this style, one of my favorites: luscious, rich, and wonderfully roasty! Dark and bitter finish, but alive with hoppiness. Excellent balance, smooth and tasty, absolutely delicious. Beautiful and rewarding finish that goes on and on... This one is my #3 American oatmeal stout, behind Rogue and Bell's. Good job, AV!"
"Pours very dark with a bit of head. Roasted/burnt flavor is the champ in this brew. Not a bad thing persay. This is a big stout, no pulled punches here. This stout talks the talk and walks the walk. I don't like the aftertaste too much. I can ger better Oatmeal Stouts for less money so I will."
"I just tasted this tonight next to a bottle of Shakespeare Stout just for kicks. I'd never had it, but it's quite good. Rich, deep, and thick like a cake. Nice complexity and interesting mouthfeel as the smoothness dissipates slightly to be replaced by a tasty and lingering hop bitterness. Very subtle though. Just an undertone. The bitterness with the flavor yields a sort of bittersweet chocolate flavor. Very nice. A little hard to down a lot of, as with anything so rich and full-bodied. But a great brew."
"I am from Mendocino County and lived about 45 minutes from where this beer is brewed. I love almost all their beers-check 'em out."
"Readily available in 6 pack bottles and 22s. However, the Empire Tap Room in Palo Alto, California has it on tap during the winter. A real treat."
"Opaque ink-black brew with moderate carbonation forms a good-sized tenacious dark tan head that hangs around until you finish the brew. Really nice looking. Aroma is of fruity cascade hops, vanilla, chocolate syrup, black cherries and dark coffee. Taste starts out with a very nice, fruity, tangy hop crispness (Similar to a Sierra Nevada Stout), melds into a dark coffee, oat sweetness with a nice mildly-chalky mouthfeel, and ends in a lingering bittersweet chocolate note with a large bittering hop finish. As it warms, an isopropyl astringency appears, but adds an interesting character over time. Moderately dry finish, and a clean ferment. Quite tasty, but also quite rich which limits its drinkability just a tad. Best enjoyed in the 12oz. bottle, not the 22oz. bomber. Well done."
"Drinkability: Good. A very tasty stout! The taste really stays with you."
"Pours an opaque brownish black with a small amount of brown head. Aroma is of dark roasted malts, chocolate, and citrusy hops. Taste comprised of dark roasted malts that show with a slightly sweet chocolate, mocha flavor. Sweetness is very subdued. Generously hopped for an oatmeal/ sweet stout. The hop presence is noted and really adds to the character of this beer. Finishes well due to not being overly sweet and the noted presence of the hops. Good mouthfeel. Smooth and very easy drinking with a nice balance between sweet and bitter. Overall, a very good beer and one of my favorites in the style."
"Old Barney Flats: Coming in from the 10 degrees, with a whipping wind, I was in need of a hearty winter warmer, and this beer hit the spot. Very rich in appearance, with a deep dark color and a spongy tan head (unfortunately, not much head retention, but decent enough lacing down the sides). The aroma was nice, dark hot chocolate. Very smooth taste, easty to drink and warming. Very impressive complexity, with the aforementioned dark chocolate, hints of espresso and rich malts. Good beer, perfect for the situation."
"Cheers"
"Typical dark, opaque black. Dark brown layer of creamy foam. Aroma is layers of dark roasted malt, chocolate milk, medium roast coffee. Semi-sweet notes swirl around creating layers of flavor accompanied by a medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is moderate. Very solid brew. As oatmeal stouts go, there's nothing outstanding here, but this is an enjoyable one and certainly worth a try."
"Backwash: Barney Flats is not my favorite oatmeal stout, ranking below Samuel Smith’s, McAuslan-St. Ambroise, Maclay’s Oatmalt, and Young’s on draught; but it is a very good effort. I think it is probably the equal of Young’s in the nitro-can, although on tap the Young’s is sublime (which this might be as well). Definitely worth trying."
"Deep dark 'cola' like color. Hints of chocolate and carmel in the flavor. Roasted barley in the aroma. A pleasent surprise with this stout. Not thick and filling like the other stouts I've had. Nice to know there will still be room for dinner after drinking one of these."
"The color a deep brown to black, the quintessential Stout color, the head mightily in size, creamy in texture and the lace sticky sheets to cling mightily to the glass. Toasted grains, caramel, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, espresso also comes to mind, a great stout nose. Front is ambrosial, the top full in its mouth feel, with a meaningful spicy hop bite, moderate to light on the carbonation, quite dry aftertaste. Not the best stout Ive tasted, but a good representative to the style and worth the try at any rate."
"My only problem with this beer had to do with the wonder mouth feel. If you drink this beer slowly the carbonation will soon disappear, changing the beer from one thats creamy to one thats quite watery. Buyer beware."
"Pours dark, dark, dark with a pretty substantial bronzish head. Nose is roasty and carmely, though not nearly so strong as the taste. Speaking of taste, this stout is more complex than one sometimes finds. Smooth roasted tastes mingle with a degree of hops bitterness that surprised (but pleased) me. This contributes to a very favorable mouthfeel and better drinkability than one sometimes finds in a stout."
"This beer pours almost black brown with a dark brown head that lasts. The smell is of oatmeal, coffee and cocoa. The taste is great, I really can taste the Oatmeal in this brew, whereas I sometimes find myself searching for it in others. The only problem I had was that I would prefer this stout to be stouter, i.e. it was not as thick as it should be IMO. It just seemed thin. Overall, this is is a solid (but not thick) stout."
"This stout had a good head that disipated quickly, but the color was black as tar and appealing. It had a great smell of toasted malt and coco. The taste was not as complex as It seemed it would be after getting a look at it in the glass. There were notes of toasted malts and semi sweet chocolate and not to sweet. It had a dry and roasted coffe finish and a light effevesant feel on the mouth. Some oak flavors and port wine qualities were present. It has good drinkability because of its somewhat light feel and taste. I may buy this one again but not if I were looking for a ""big"" oatmeal stout."
"Dark, oily color with a thick but quickly disappearing brown head. Great roasted coffee and cinnamon aroma. Flavor is creamy and sweet from the get-go, which is just how I like my Oatmeal Stouts. The coffee and chocolate flavor had a nice light hops and raisin finish to balance it out. Not the best Stout I have had but it is definitely up there, and is not very expensive either."
"Dark brew with mahogany highlights that pours with a decent tan head.  The head slowly fades to leave a ring around the top of the beer with a nice trailing lace on the glass sides.  The aroma is one of roasted coffee and sweetness, with a slight hint of alcohol.   The mouthfeel is light for a stout, but very smooth.  The flavors are very good in this beer.  Coffee, roasted malt, chocolate, a little fruitness, and a hint of nuttiness make this a really complex beer that is topped off with a good dose of hops.    I believe the hops help create the relatively clean finish.  The flavor develops very well as the beer warms.  This is a very good beer that could be great, but it lacks the ""chewy"" mouthfeel that many good stouts present."
"A great catch from Mendocino County."
"First time I have had this since becoming an advocate. I like AVBC beers so I thought I'd try it again.   Very dark with a malted milk ball colored head (inside filling) Head stayed pretty well but lace was only sparse.  Smell was mellow and sweetish.  First sip was very roasty and burnt toast like. As the glass was drained the taste smoothed out a bit.  Good solid oatmeal stout from one of my favorite domestic breweries."
"As they say on the bottle ""recommend as a nightcap.""  I could prob drink a few but certainly not a session beer as I like in most oatmeal stouts."
"Black with creamed coffee-colored head. Nose is shy with notes of fresh roasted almonds, hazelnuts and chocolate. The deal with this beer is that it is so velvety smooth while it delivers subtle layers of coffee, nuts, cocoa, blueberry and eggplant flavors. Liquid velvet I tells ya. Nothing exotic, but then again, a stout is prose, not poetry. Drink more than one."
"A really dark black beer, just about opaque. Thick brown-tan colored head, which only started to form half-way through the pour. Huge head at first, but it does not last long and soon settles down, then dissipates completeley - leaving almost no lace at all on the glass sides. Massive roasted malt tastes explode in the mouth, with a hint of coffee, burnt caramel and some whisps of chocolate. But the burnt caramel and roast tastes are far from pervasive, which is good, and soon make way for a nice roasted bittersweet finish. Lovely rich dark stout with a well-balanced roast and hop character. This beer gets better as it warms up. One of the best US Oatmeal Stouts I have tried to date. I will definitely buy this again, but next time let it warm up a bit more before supping it !!!"
"It pours black, with a tan brown head that works its way up the glass.  It smells roasty with a good nose full of hops.  The strong roasted flavor also comes through nicely but doesn't overpower the hops.  It has a great, chunky mouthfeel."
"This beer poured almost pitch black with no light getting through it.  The head was a bubbly dark tan that subsided quickly and left little lace.  Very little aroma present, with hints of malt and coffee.  The flavor was of malt, coffee and chocolate.  The body was a bit light for a porter.  The finish had a bit of a sour aspect, but nothing to ruin the beer.  An alright oatmeal stout, but for price, I think Goose Island does a better job and of course it can't touch a Samuel Smith's."
"This is definitely worth a try if you haven't already.  The head is a very dark tan which is always appealing to me.  The taste is fairly uniform throughout the entire pint-Oats.  Some may describe this as simple or mediocre but I enjoy that in a beer if the taste is good.  Not my favorite of Anderson Valley but definitely a good choice."
"After one taste, (maybe two), I poured the other two bottles down the drain. For sure I promise not to rate any Anderson Valley Beers. Because I'll never buy another one of there beers again. Five tasted and not one rated above 2 (average)."
"Pours a deep dark brown/black that doesn't let any light in and a nice creamy brownish head.  The smell is roasted malt and oats.  The flavor starts off with the roasteds but then goes through oatmeal, coffee, chocolate, and more roasted.  The brew is nice and creamy across the tongue and highly drinkable.  Yet another very good beer from Anderson Valley.  I haven't had anything from this brewery that wasn't great."
"Pours a thick brown head. Opaque appearance. Smell is roasty and a bit sweet. Very creamy mouthfeel. Velvet-like. Coffee tones present on tongue. Bittersweet chocolate and toffee also present. Sticky sweet tobacco. A nice lingering bitterness. Very well put together Oatmeal Stout. One of my favorites."
"No doubt this is an oatmeal stout, strong roasted malt flavor.  Black, thick and chewy, very smooth and creamy.  The ABV is 5.7%."
"Hard to lay down $9-10 for this one though it is worth it. This is a kick ass stout with a long roasted finish."
"Beautiful!  This brew is absolutely delicious.  Superb silk texture.  Strong roasted malt, cappucinno.  Potent roasted malts on the nose.  Super dark brown head, with a tint of peach.  Anderson Valley Brewing Co. hasn't failed me yet.  Excellent craftsman."
"Yeah, this is an all-timer. Pour it in a cognac glass to get the full effect My beer is bigger than your beer type of bragging rights. The oats! Roasted oats are yum-yum good. Big warm fuzzy beer that you just want to curl up with. The smell alone will drive 'em crazy. Always reliable, always on, always a joy to drink. And I don't even really like stouts..."
"One of the great Oatmeal Stouts.  Sweet, yet doesn't fade."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this oatmeal stout. Very robust, complex, extremely flavourful and textured. In a market of wimpy and nitro'd stouts, this one stands out. However, the $9.99 a 6-pak price tag stood out the most. As much as I liked it, I would not drop that kind of money a second time."
"The sweetness and hops of this stout seemed more like a strong porter, but overall it was well done."
