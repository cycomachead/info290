review_text
"Bottle.  Started at 54 degrees.  Dark, dark brown to black, nice medium tan/camel foamy head with some staying power; smell is malt, slight oats.  Something dark and well-roasted, as it warms.  Taste is straight forward at first, nothing distinguished, no chocolate, sweetness or even heavy oats, but then gives way to a rising bitterness that just lays there persisting on the tongue.  Maybe the beer is turning bad, but it smells ok.  Maybe it's just not my cup of tea.  I think it is just a burnt/bitter, slightly acidic taste. Mouthfeel is light to medium but finished thin on the tongue, giving way to that bitterness that lingers (oh yeah, I already covered that part).  I could say something predictably silly, like, ""it's a crime to recommend Convict Hill"" but that would be pushing the rules and there are many raters who seem to like it well enough."
"It was ok hard bitter taste not in a good way."

"Overall: A well put together beer. Hts all the right taste profile buttons, but keeps everything drinkable yet interesting. Recommended."

"Pours a dark brown color with little tan head. Oats, roasted malt, some coffee, and some cocoa on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with some roastiness."

"Feel: Foamy, tangy"
"Lots of chocolate, some coffee bitters. Bitter aftertaste lasted longer than I'd like in a stout."

"O:  solid, good, not great ... the lack of sweetness hurts it a bit for me, but otherwise it's got some good dark malt notes, especially the dark/semisweet chocolate and coffee.  absolutely NO alcohol present in the nose or taste, which makes it damned dangerous because the 8% ABV (as posted on the brewery's website) is not a joke."

"O: the perfect breakfast stout. Tons of coffee flavor, followed by just the right amount of chocolate."
"O: I'd say this was good, but definitely not great. My biggest gripe might be the smokey burnt coffee seemed to take over the entire beer. I think coffee can be great in stouts, but this one just went too far with it."

"Pours an almost opaque super dark orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, toasted oat, and cocoa aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, char, and oat flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice cocoa and char combination going on in the flavor."

"While certainly not a bad beer, just seemed to miss a little for me on several levels. A little more texture and a little richer and less astringent malt bill would push this beer up considerably. Overall, the alcohol is well integrated for such a big beer."

"It pours a thick black with a nice tan head with hints of chocolate in the aroma. The taste is of dark chocolate malts and oats with a slight sweetness on the back-end. It is a very smooth medium bodied stout that is excellently balanced. It clocks in at above 9% ABV and you can barely tell. This is a very high quality local Oatmeal Stout from Independence Brewing."

"I got this one in a trade with Cyde. 12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 11/4/2012. Pours pitch black color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense dark khaki head with good retention that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Some nice spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, oatmeal, caramel, molasses, light coffee, dark fruits, roasted malt, and roasted earthiness. Very nice and balanced dark/roasted malt aromas; with good strength. Taste of big chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, molasses, coffee, oatmeal, slight dark fruit, and roasted earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, coffee, molasses, and roasted malt on the finish for a bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of roasted/dark malt flavor; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and chewy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden at 9.2%, with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial oatmeal stout! Great robustness and balance of flavors; and very smooth to sip on. Really enjoyed this one."

"A gift from my nephew that has been in the cellar for about a year. Oily black in color, but an aggressive pour yielded a few carbonation bubbles with almost no head and some spotty lacing. Very subdued nose with some subtle roastiness with hints of oats and coffee. For what this lacked in appearance and smell, it more than makes up for in the taste. Very rich and flavorful with great roasty notes. Lots of fresh roasted coffee along with hints of oatmeal, caramel, dark chocolate, and molasses. The mouthfeel is rich and thick and extremely smooth with a nice subtle bitter finish. The alcohol is extremely well hidden making this scary drinkable, but it's rich enough to be a sipper. Overall an outstanding interpretation of the style!"

"O – I do recommend this little lady. I mean, if you are staring at Samuel Smiths Oatmeal Stout and this, obviously side with the former, but this is definitely worth a try. It is a very good oatmeal stout and deserves recognition as such. Job well done…After all this I JUST saw that it is a 9.2% ABV beer. What? This is incredibly well disguised. That’s going to get a good .5 added to the flavor for sure. Nice job indeed."
""
""
""
"O: one of my favorite stouts. Nice bold flavors and great when it is cold outside. Perhaps the only negative was there appeared to be some sediment at the bottom of the glass when I got to the end. After I drank the first bottle I left a few swigs in the 2nd glass because I didn't want the sediment. It made the last drink a bit strong and bitter."

"O: Pretty average. The booze is maskd very well. i would have never guessedthis beer was 9% ABV"
""
"O- This was a nice oatmeal stout. Nice flavor, decent mouthfeel, a fairly nice aroma. I definitely enjoyed drinking this however I wouldn't say it's the best oatmeal stout I've had. Definitely glad I got to try it, thanks again Sam! Thanks a lot for sending this, definitely appreciated!"

"O - solid oatmeal stout... Cut down on the carbonation a bit by swirling it for a few seconds and you have a winner"

"Overall, this is not the absolute greatest example of an oatmeal stout, but still a pretty good effort from Independence Brewing and one of the better products I have tried from this brewery."
"O - This is 9%+, no way. Delicious, very well done. As hot as I am I find myself quickly going back for another drink of this. Very impressed with this oatmeal stout."
""

""

"O - Pretty easy going oatmeal stout. Hides the ABV fantastically well for a beer this big. I'd pick some up every now and then if it were a local."
"Pour is viscous opaque black with tight dark tan head. The nose is heavy on the roast, a touch chalky, bitter coffee, and a bit earthy. The taste is big, roasty, earthy, chocolatey. The finish is bitter coffee and lingers, the body is thick, creamy, highly carbonated. Not bad, a touch on the roasty/bitter side."
"This is medium bodied with a smooth feel to it. It is moderately carbonated and the alcohol is not hidden despite being aged for quite some time. I cant help but compare this beer to stone's 12th anniversary bitter chocolate stout. There is a lot of similarities here but I think if given the choice to pick between the 2 I would go with this one. Not a bad brew at all, it is worth checking out."

"Overall a good strong stout. Perfect for a slow sipper on a cool night."

"Thanks to Tim from Houston for adding this into the beer trade..."
"O - i just realized how heavy of a stout this is and am shocked at the lack of alcohol smell! well done! a very nice light tasting stout, well balanced in every aspect."

"O: Very tasty stout with about everything you'd like from a beer of this style. Recommended if you can find it."

"This beer is definitely hitting the spot right now, significantly roasted, with lots of dark chocolate notes, sweetness and bitterness in balance as well as a richness that is just hitting the spot on this cold December evening in Tucson."
""
"This stout pours a dark brown with cocoa-colored foam resting atop it. There’s a light roasty aroma to it which turns sharp and bold on the palate. Dark chocolate bitterness dominates with a smooth, dry finish. Not bad but not one I’d break out of jail to drink again, either."
""
"O- Delicious. One of my favorites of the type."
""
"Thanks to texasfan549! The pour is viscous, slight tan head on top of a oily,black liquid. The aroma is burnt coffee, dark chocolate. The flavor is full of dark roasted notes, burnt coffee, slightly bitter finish. The body is full, light carbonation, no discernable booze. Solid stout, a tad too heavy on the roasted notes, but very enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is good. Dark intimidating appearance, but no real head, and not much lacing. Nose is heavy and hearty combination of grains and coffee and dark chocolate all charred together. Flavor is woody and malty with a pungent balance of fermented grains. Roasted malt and coffee. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
"Full body beer, silky and creamy as expected from an oatmeal stout. Very easy to drink. Glad the brewery brought this out to SF for the awards."

"Pretty solid although nothing extra special. The roasted malts can be overpowering a times although the oatmeal gives it a good creamy texture."
"Overall: A decent oatmeal stout with high ABV. I don't like it as much as lower ABV Summit, or higher ABV Southern Tier Oat. I'd enjoy it in Texas, but not sure if I'd want to seek it out again. Great to try!"
"O - Not too bad. It was fairly well balanced and easy to drink. This one really hit the spot on a cold night like tonight."
"Overall I would definitely recommend trying this, especially if this is the kind of thing you like. I am sad it is not available in my area (yet...?), and will long for more when it is gone. Check it out and enjoy."

"O - This is a pretty good stout. I have never heard of it or the brewery and am really pleased with this extra. Its a high quality, highly drinkable and very well balanced/crafted beer."
"O - Perfect for a cold night like tonight. This beer is pretty unrelenting in oatmeal and malt, giving a dry but heavy stout. Given another 30 degree night, I would have another."
"Thanks to FreeVerse for the initial opportunity and to duff247, for the opportunity to re-visit"
"Received a few bottles of this in a trade. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. I initially started pouring this down the side to keep the head in check, then poured straight down the center for the last 3rd of the pour to get the desired crown. However, this beer generated but a few columns of fizz. Otherwise, it's perfectly opaque like just about every other stout on earth. The smell is the best part of this beer by far. Chocolate, a bit of tofffee and/or caramel, and a roasted grainy scent that is just terrific. The taste isn't quite up to par with the bouquet, however. It's quite bitter with a heavy dose of black coffee dominating the flavor profile. Charred oak with a bit smokiness as well. The mouthfeel is the low point. It's very very thin, and heavily carbonated. It doesn't have the dense creaminess I prefer in my stouts. Letting it rest on your tongue is like having an 9-volt battery in contact with its tip. Not a pleasant feel at all. Overall, not a stout I plan on revisiting. I'll give the remaining bottles away as extras so others can tick this and form their own opinions."
"O: Not bad, not my favorite style, but this seems about average from my perspective of the style."
"O - This is a diamond in the rough that totally deserves more credit than it gets! Awesome oatmeal stout that comes in a 4pk for the same price as a bomber of something comparable."
"D ~ Great to see a high ABV Oatmeal Stout readily In available in 4-packs. Thanks to Brad for hookin' up one of my wants. This'll be a great Wintry brew."
"Overall this is a solid offering from Independence Brewing Co. I'm not familiar enough with Stouts to offer improvements, but with the exception of it's superior drinkability, nothing really stood out to me as exceptional. I would still take this over a regular Guinness any day. Cheers!"
"O: This beer is solid, but uninteresting."
"O - it's not that bad but it lacks complexity that makes good beer what it is."
"Toasty smell. Smooth, easy to drink, dark chocolaty yet creamy, hint of banana and orange peel. Best Stout I've had, I will seek this beer."
"O: A solid beer and the perfect relaxer for the end of a hard day. Beer really is an amazing beverage and I feel this one adds character to the quickly expanding selection."
"O- Awesome oatmeal stout. Though the nose was a bit light, the beers taste was intense and enjoyed. Also this thing is 8.5%?! I could drink these all night having no idea... Definitely want more from this brewery now"
"Overall, a pretty decently drinkable little beer. Not blowing me away, but pleasant enough to drink again."
"O- I really enjoyed this stout and the price is great. This beer has a lot of flavors. Roasted malt to a chocolate after-taste and then the oatmeal moves in."
"O: Probably my favorite locally made stout. Glad it's available year round."
"SilverX's bottle."
"The beer almost jumped out of the bottle when I opened it the color is opaqui dark brown, there was a lot of sediment in the bottle and in the glass, the head was huge light brown and was huge. It smells of roasted, dry, dark chocolate with a tmall amount of sourness. The taste has some dark fruits, molasses, dark chocolate, and a roasted bitterness. It feels thick, warming, and slightly dry. I cant help but think that there's something wrong with this bottle. I need to try it again, there were clumps of foamy sediment and the smell and taste was a little off."
"Pours a beautiful opaque near black, no light passing through, with a thin, quickly dissipating tan head. Smell is rich and almost briny, n a good way, and flavor matches almost note for note. Nicely carbonated, not quite chewy. I'd drink this again."
"Sticky sand colored foam on a dark, almost black beer. The nose was very chocolately with a fair bit of grain. The beer tasted like dusty cocoa powder with a little bit of licorice. The beer was surprisingly thin and with a dry finish. Not the best, but certainly a solid beer."
"Big thanks goes out to Exiled for sending me this one in a past trade as an extra! Served from bottle into a Spaten Optimator mug. Poured pitch black with a two finger brown head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, caramel, cream, and very subtle oat. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, cream, oatmeal, and alcohol on the followthrough. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. A little much for outside in our current weather but still quite tasty. The flavor on this one is much better than the aroma in my opinion. But that wouldn't be saying too much in this case if I'm honest. Worth trying for sure but that is about it."
"I'll take another,BA Texasclimber. A simple stout that possibly caught me off guard tonight. Good stuff from TX."
"O: Something I will go back to in the future. very much exceeded what I had expected from Independence."
"Poured into my DFH snifter, pours a pitch black motor oil color, but appears to be pretty medium bodied. A full off-white/tan head fills the glass and the recedes, leaving no lacing. Decent alcohol legs. Smell- dark chocolate, molasses, maybe some faint coffee. Taste- a roasty burnt bitter flavor at the back of the throat, rich carbonation, dark chocolate, and molasses. Mouthfeel- this one is fresh, has awesome thick and rich carbonation to it. Drinkability- for 8.5%, it is amazingly drinkable, with not much detected alcohol warmth. This is also 6$ for a 4 pack, which is an awesome price for a beer this good."
"d - A pretty drinkable oatmeal stout that is heavy on bitter chocolate in the taste. I enjoyed the smell but wish it had been more carbonated. Would be willing to try again."
"Overall: Decent, didn't blow me out of the water but it was certainly solid."
"Big thanks to twiggamortis420 for knocking off this want! Pours very dark brown, but completely impenetrable by light, with a small khaki head that left light wisps of lacing. Aroma has nice notes of roast and chocolate, a bit of coffee, and slight bitter aroma. Taste is right on par with the nose. Roast is in full supply, and pretty much dominates everything else, although it's not astringent nor bitter. There is a slight bitterness on the back end, but I would contribute it to the hops rather than roasted barley. Chocolate plays second fiddle to the roast, as it's very light, and there's also a touch of dark fruit/raisin peeking through, but only momentarily. Nice, full body, low carbonation, slick and smooth, with a bite of bitterness on the very dry finish. Overall, a really good oatmeal stout, although maybe I wold like just a touch more sweetness to balance out the strong roast. Good stuff. Thank again, Greg!"
"Notes: Convict Hill is one big-ass oatmeal stout! You don't drink this beer. You chew it. Full bodied, with robust flavor and yet, still manages to hide the alcohol. Silky mouthfeel and a dry finish balance it out in perfect harmony. This is one of my favorite oatmeal stouts to date, and with I had more."
"A nice locally produced Oatmeal stout here in Austin. Good to see. Pick this baby up if you see it."
"O - A solid stout. Smell by far is great in my opinion and the taste does not disappoint."
"12 ounce bottle poured into an Efes tulip. Quick, beige head with clear, slippery lacing. Aroma includes coffee, roasted malt and maybe a touch of yoo-hoo. Interesting. Taste is deliciously smooth with no traces of alcohol. Some malt sweetness noted (yoo-hoo), light flavor of coffee. Tastes more like a milk stout. Either way, amazing for the high abv. Excellent."
"Big thanks to lnashsig for sending this one. Poured into duvel tulip. The beer pours with about 1/2 inch of beautiful brown head with good lacing. The aroma is coffee, chocolate, and a bit of caramel sweetness. Really great start for this one. The flavors are great as well, although they are not quite as robust as they are in the aroma. The beer has a great creamy mouthfeel with a very fine quality to the carbonation. It is very pleasant to drink. I am a sucker for stouts and this one delivered."
"For someone not so big on stouts, I have to say this is the second stout that has blown my mind in the past year (heck even exactly one year after the first, the DFH-WWS), and for my first (or among the first) texan beer, I certainly will hunt this treat down in the lone star state or beyond its borders because, I tell ya, it's worthwhile."
"D - fairly drinkable but the bitternes"
"Picked up a single from Whole Foods. It's basically a big roasty stout with a mild oatmeal edge. It's not overly thick and you could easily mistake it for a ~6% beer. There's a classic malty dark chocolate and java taste with a little dark bread crust taste and sweetness. Not a bad for a winter day, but also not a standout stout."
"D - well, it's ok, but surprisingly hot."
"Drinkability is pretty good here. It's a slightly different take on an oatmeal stout, nothing too out there, but a bit different nonetheless. Definitely an enjoyable beer that I'd like to see again."
"Super smooth, very oatmeal and coffee tastes, flavor really resides for a long time. For an extra, a really good beer. Not a whole lot of different flavors, but does what its name says very well."
"Overall drinkability is good. A nice and tasty stout, slightly filling, but multiples wouldn't be too hard to put away."
"This beer is certainly over carbonated and i was worried it might be infected, but i didn't really get an infection. That said, the carbonation is distracting and takes away from the beer a bit."
"Not as much oatmeal presence as I would like but still decent."
"Drink is OK, some warming booze, the sticky finish and mouth coating makes it a little tougher, and just the heavy beer feel, but otherwise not bad."
"D - This is one of the most in-your-face oatmeal stouts I've had. However, it lacks some of the outright oaty uniqueness of other oatmeal stouts (say, Samuel Smith's). It's still a great, if big, brew."
"Quite drinkable thanks to the balance of flavors. Best served lightly chilled, this makes a great ""breakfast stout"" even without the direct addition of coffee."
"Medium, very drinkable and not overly sweet and non noticeable alcohol which amps up its smoothness."
"Drinkability: A very easy drinking imperial stout. Would love to have more of this."
"drinkability great. it's a very enjoyable oatmeal stout, and definitely fresh- it's brewed a few minutes from here."
"Drinkability is decent. This is an ok stout, but it's kind of messy, and with some obvious flaws."
"Pours pitch black, too much head- filled the pint with less than and inch of liquid. Smells like berries, coffee, cherries, slight earthy must. Tastes like cherries, coffee, dark breads and more fruit. The carbonation is a bit excessive, it has been 5 mins and the bubbles are still going strong. Some cola and toffee flavors, I also get some bell pepper in the after taste. Mouthfeel tries to be smooth and creamy, but this carbonation is waaaay too much for this. I don't want to say infected, but there is something up with this bottle. Still good, but not in the capacity that it could be."
"8.50%! I was thinking more like 5%, especially after I killed the bottle in about 6 minutes. Despite my obvious gluttony, this Texan Oatmeal Stout packs a ton of flavor in each sip. I could see it working just as well when gently quaffed from a snifter as it did getting slammed from a nonic."
"Overall, this was a very pleasing oatmeal stout. Given the chance, I'd happily have it again."
"After a second bottle was sent to me from injured reserve, that wasn't infected/overcarbonated I resubmit my score for the beer the way it was intended. As overall I would say a fairly solid oatmeal stout."
"Drink ability was good. Nice beer for a cold night. At 9 percent alcohol, it goes down smoother than most imperial stouts. Just wish there was more sweetness to the flavor and a little less bitterness. Gonna age one for a year and see if that helps"
"Drinkability: Though not the most attractive brew around, it's still a soundly sweet, mighty tasty stout and a nice surprise, as I had yet to try anything from Independence Brewing."
"D: Good, solid brew"
"D: There's nothing wrong with it to take away from drinkability, but it is a bit strong for a session beer."
"Overall a really solid shot here from them. Served as a well placed night cap and I really could have easily had another when I was done. Good job all around."
"D: Low. The first sips were great, but CHOS is too acrid for drinkability."
"Overall, a bit above the average oatmeal stout. It is a bit too roasted for my liking. Somewhat drinkable. No alcohol showing in it which surprised me for how high the abv is."
"Bottle. Pours a dark brown almost black color with a slight tannish head with crimson highlights. The head settles to a nice color. The aroma isn't really overly strong in any way but rather a subtle roasted malt and coffee note. Leather, dark chocolate, and roasted coffee are the dominate flavors in this one. I think the oats in this provide for a nice medium velvety mouthfeel that is rather well done. Even at the abv %, the taste really doesn't have that over alcohol note that some bigger beers can have. Not overly roasted either because I really don't get that overly bitter aftertaste."
"d - A pretty drinkable oatmeal stout that is heavy on bitter chocolate in the taste. I enjoyed the smell but wish it had been more carbonated. Would be willing to try again."
"Pours a very nice rich black brown color with a huge mocha colored head that leaves nice lacing and has great retention. The aroma is very nutty, some vanilla and tons of milk chocolate. Big roasted malts, just a hint of dark chocolate, but all milk chocolate on the palate. Big flavors of raisins and winter stone fruits masked by rich marshmallow like sweetness that blends all of the flavors together. Mouthfeel is spot on for the style. Really couldn't believe this was 8.5 percent abv after it's big silky texture and no alcohol burn. Really a nice made stout and perfect example of the style."
"12oz bottle into my Westmalle goblet. Awesome name and bottle, looking cool...Dark brown pour with light carbonation, disappointing for an oatmeal, love to see this on tap...An alluring sweet aroma, surprised at the sweet chocolate, vanilla, and oats coming through without alcohol on this 8.5% beer. Vanilla really shows more than anything, really nice...The taste bores me, most of the sweetness is gone leaving a plain stout with a little roastiness creeping in. Not bad, just boring, however at the abv super easy to drink."
"D- My favorite Independence brew to date but the only other one I remember was Austin Amber which was over-carbonated"
"Mild carbonation, no alcohol in the taste, solid and enjoyable beer."
"Thanks to wagenvolks for the trade. 12oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass pours a deep opaque motor oil black with a thin quickly diminishing tan head. Aroma is a nice amount of roasted malts with some bitter cocoa. The taste is a nice amount of smooth roasted malts with a nice blend of bitter cocoa and subtle espresso. The beer is medium bodied and quite smooth with well hidden alcohol. This is a very enjoyable strong stout, one I would likely keep on hand all Winter if it were available here."
"Nothing illustrates the oblivion of convict life quite like a deep stout. This one pours a straight obsidian topped by about a half-finger of somewhat resilient light tan foam. The nose comprises coffee, roasted malts, dark chocolate, and a touch of burnt oats. The taste is quite similar, with some blackened biscuits, charcoal, cocoa, and a hint of vanilla (in the background) thrown in there as well. The body is a solid medium, with a light carbonation and a heftily smooth feel, bordering on chewiness. Overall, a very nice, black stout, another brew I wish they carried around here so I could have it whenever the urge hits me."
"Notes - I would call this more of an export stout than an Imperial stout. Which is good, because we need more of them. I have a couple of issues: an oatmeal stout should have a thicker mouthfeel. Also, I'm not a fan of the bitter alcohol-syrup aftertaste. Otherwise, though, it's well balanced between bitter and sweet. Not the best stout ever, but it's a decent stab at it, to be sure."
"Pours pitch black with a thin layer of brown head. Pretty big aroma here; oats, black strap molasses, and dark chocolate liqueur. The flavor has an added note of smoke to go along with big, fairly dry, chocolate flavors. The rich, creamy mouthfeel is the overall highlight to compliment the flavor. This is a big ol' oat stout that's worth trying at least once."
"D: simple and straightforward, a great example of a well balanced oatmeal stout."
"D - I would drink this frequently, if it were available to me."
"D - Overall this is a pretty decent beer that I'd drink again and for an Independence beer that says something"
"It is thin in the mouth with very little creaminess, but this is a relatively easy drinking beer with little hint of the ABV. I enjoyed this but wouldn't go seeking it out again."
"Dark, dry, and bitter - this is a stout to reckon with and a joyous offering from Independence. (It's the only beer listed on BA containing the name convict.)"
"D: Simple, yet elegant. Yes."
"Overall- Interesting take on oatmeal stout. Big complex flavors, but not as perfectly balanced and smooth as it could be. I enjoyed it quite a bit, and will repurchase on tap and wouldnt hesitate to pick up a four pack on ocasion."
"a great brew... with a nice head that grows a few seconds after the pour like a good stout. opaque in color. the nose lack a little in definition. its mild at best of chocolate and maltiness. the palate has a wonderful body. with malt, smokey bitterness, and chocolate. the malt is there. the beer as the mild sweet finish of a oatmeal stout. not particularly on the ridiculously sweet side. so it was balanced. great texas brew."
"For all of its bold flavor, very drinkable. I finished mine quickly, maybe just because it tasted so good."
"Roasty, dark coffee notes blend with Baker's chocolate and a grainy oat note. Mocha bitterness lingers into the finish and clashes with the hops nicely. Alcohol is well-hidden until the very end (plus that familiar warming sensation below). Mouthfeel is velvety smooth at first, but the carbonation picks up mid-sip to add a bit of kick to the finish. The medium-thick body is near perfect in consistency: luxurious on the palate, but never too heavy. This stuff is really good--maybe even better than on-tap, which is a rarity. Independence had never really impressed me until I tried this beer almost a year ago. I just might have to start revisiting some of their other bottled selections, because Convict Hill is one excellent Oatmeal Stout."
"I was not really impressed with this. More acrid coffee that I want for the style, and not nearly as creamy and smooth as I was expecting. Oatmeal Stouts should be incredibly smooth and creamy with a bit of sweetness. This is not. Not bad, but poorly made for the style IMO."
"Taste is pretty smooth with a nice balance between roast and sweetness. There are hints of Irish dry stout sourness that are not all that uncommon in an oatmeal stout, I kinda like it. It's a tad thin and does not have the viscous creamy feeling many of the best display, but this is easily and hands down the best beer from Independence, not even close. With all the new upstarts in Austin, they will need some firepower like this to compete."
"drinkability: cant really go wrong at 5.99 a four pack. the alchohol is very well masked and the beer is full of flavor. it just smells weird in my opinion. it is also very fresh right now and i cant wait to see how this tastes after a few months. this and stash are becoming my go to local grab."
"Verdict: A solid big American Stout, Convict Hill is probably my favorite beer from Independence. I'm looking forward to what these guys brew up next."
"Pours dark brown with a cream-colored head. The aroma is roasted malts with some chocolate. The flavor is roasted malt, coffee, cream and some chocolate. The mouthfeel is medium to thick and is pretty creamy. Low carbonation."
"Got this on-tap at the draught house. Pours with a black color, minimal head, it looks almost oily. Smell was very creamy, hints of chocolate and coffee. The taste was creamy as well. Compared to other stouts, this was an easy drink. Even with a higher ABV, the blend was done well enough where it was hardly noticeable. Great beer from start to finish. Definitely worth a try if you enjoy stouts."
"On tap at Ginger Man in Austin on $3 Texas pint night. From notes. pours black, thin mocha head fades to flim and ring. Spotty lacing. SMELL kinda faint roasty, some heat. Later some rich caramel maltyness, sweet maple syrup. TASTE licorice, roasty, lightly boozy, vaguely molasses, caramel malty. FEEL rich, smooth, some warming, full body, clean finish. OVERALL very easy drinking for a big beer. Alc well hidden."
"Mouthfeel is full but not too heavy. Again, nicely balanced. Independence have really hit the nail on the head with this one."
"Over all, I was more than impressed (if you couldn't tell!). I am a huge lover of Stouts and Porters, Stone's Imperial Russian and Oatmeal Stouts in particular, but this impressed me. Hidden away in the heart of Texas' capital, a gem of a brewery awaits those that are willing to seek it out. Not sure what the ABV is, but seems around 7-8%. Paired nicely with the chicken wrap, chips and queso I had for lunch."
"Well Done!!"
