"Solid roasty, toasted oat goodness."
""
""
""
"O: I would recommend or drink again"
"Great roasty aroma. Nice brown head. Isn't as black as I prefer but has a nice dark color. Incredibly smooth. Bigger end of a medium body. Tastes pretty dam good."
""

""

"Basic stout appearance, dark brown-black, translucent around the edges, with a thin off-white head. Roasty aroma. Not much else to say there. In the taste, dark roasty malts, cacao, underlying milky sweetness, hints of anise. Body was a bit on the weak side for a stout, especially an oatmeal stout. This might make for a good nitro beer, but as is, it didn't do too much for me."

"Good mellow oatmeal stout.  Chocolate malts countered by hops nicely.  I'd have it again!"
""
"O: Some inconsistencies, not really smooth.  Takes you on a journey, but its more like a dark cold road than pleasant meadows.  It grows on you though, and is nice in the end.  Bought and drank in Chiang Mai, Feb 24th, 2015."

"This is one of the 2 or 3 best grocery-store 6-pack beers in my area. It is smooth, robust, and filling...it feels more like food and less like liver poison. The BA score here is deceptively low in my opinion, although the verbal descriptions I see here are quite accurate."
""
"Overall: Not a bad stout, the oatmeal mellows it somewhat, but it's pretty tasty."
""
""
""

"Good and dark.  Sweet roasted malt nose. Rich roasty flavor with a light sweetness followed up by some hop bitter that might be a bit more than I like in my oat stouts. Feels medium in body. This is one of the better oatmeal stouts you can get in a 6 pack in my area."
"O-This is a pretty good take on an oatmeal stout. It may not be the most complex or intriguing beer in the world, but the oats are well done (if a bit heavy handed) and the beer drinks like you think an oatmeal stout would drink. Its a filling, tasty example of the style and a good first exposure to Ninkasi for me."

"I'm wondering if I got a bad batch given other reviews. Not horrible, but definitely a lack of fermentation control. Very apparent isoamyl acetate (banana) flavor. Light body. Pretty standard oatmeal stout otherwise. Slightly roasty. Tastes like a smaller beer than it is, pretty sessionable given the abv. Overall, reminds me a lot of some of the kit-based oatmeal stouts I've had from beginner homebrewers. Drinkable but not terribly exciting, and a few glaring flaws."

"Pours a nice dark brown color, with a light tan creamy/fizzy head, which left not much sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty with some nice chocolate, toffee, slight coffee note, and some vanilla. The taste is very nice sweet, malty, with some dark stuff thrown in, nice little vanilla note. Medium body, with a slight dry/bitter finish, ABV is hidden pretty well also. Overall a very nice oatmeal stout, would buy again, nice to see Ninkasi in UT."
"D - Not a bad stout; I prefer beers that are a bit sweeter, but this one didn't overwhelm me with bitterness. Overall, a good offering that I would partake of again given the opportunity. Would like to try Ninkasi's vanilla version of this brew someday."

"That was surprising flavorful fruity Stout. Complex with an excellent depth in flavors and a unique taste. Recommended."

"Pours pitch black with a creamy 1 finger tan head that faded and left excellent foamy lacing coating the sides. Smells of oats, chocolate, vanilla, coffee beans, toasted grains, cocoa powder and brown sugar; it smells sweet but not overly sweet and has enough milk stout qualities that it stands out as a deep, rich malty stout nose. Tastes like it smells with coffee, espresso, cocoa nibs, charred wood, vanilla beans, oats, roasted/burnt grains and mild floral hops. Tasted and smelled very good for a stout, it was super easy to drink and damn enjoyable. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with really solid roasted notes, a medium body and an almost watery feel that went down smooth. A really great oatmeal stout, this was smooth and tasty with just enough hop bite to mix well with the malt and oat base and limit the bitterness."
"Poured a deep, blackish brown body with red highlights and a one finger tan head that quickly dissipated to a ring of foam. A pretty good looking stout, though not the best. Scents of rich roasted malt, dark roast coffee with cream, bittersweet chocolate, a light, earthy oatmeal aroma and light dark fruit. Overall impression of aroma is of a classic, enticing, true-to-form oatmeal stout. It is very well done. Flavor begins medium sweet, with notes of bittersweet milk chocolate, sweetened dark roast coffee with cream, a slight earthiness from the oats and light roasted malt. This moves into a medium sweet middle with more pronounced roast malt, and the previously mentioned flavors still present. Finish is medium sweet with strong notes of roasted malt balancing, along with sweetened coffee with cream and bittersweet milk chocolate flavors, with very light alcohol flavors discernible. Aftertaste is medium dry with notes of roast malt, cocoa powder and dark coffee, a welcome end to the medium sweet sip. Overall this is a pleasant oatmeal stout flavor profile. It has all the welcome flavors of the style and balances them well. The slight alcohol warmth on the finish is a tad bit unwelcome, but not overly so. Very nice. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, with medium carbonation and a smooth, slick, creamy feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a very true to form oatmeal stout that is quite pleasant to drink. Overall this is a fine example of an oatmeal stout. It hits the aroma, flavor and mouthfeel quite well and is very enjoyable to drink. A very nice offering and a good year-round alternative to Velvet Merlin."

"A rather interesting stout with a strong vanilla overtones. Rich, heavy, and decadent on many levels and very satisfying."
"Amazing beer. Smooth and heavy at the same. I'm not sure if I like it better in the bottle or a icy cold glass. I guess a few more cases will tell. Cheers"

"The Verdict: Good beer. Well balanced and very smooth, but a bit bland overall. Nothing to really complain about, it is a good solid stout but there’s nothing to really make it stand out from the crowd."
""
""
""

"Sweet, smooth sipping brew. Sweet malty, chocolaty entry and flavor. Slight hints of cocoa and coffee. For 50 IBU's, the bitterness is very, very mild, pleasant and welcomed. Cooked brown sugar and cooked caramel in the finish. Very slight earthy hoppiness detected. Superior mouth feel, silky smooth. Light carbonation melds well with silky mouth feel. 7.2%, but drinks like a 5% session ale. A must grab if you are entering the stout game."

"On-tap poured into a pilsner. Color is very dark brown to black, little head, very nice lacing. Aroma opens up after you let it sit for a half hour--caramel malt, a bit if coffee and mild hops. Flavor is rich dark roasted malt with coffee, a hint of oatmeal, an mildly bitter hops. Mouthfeel is medium thin and foamy. Overall this is a very good and enjoyable oatmeal stout--one of my favorite styles.d"
"A truly rich beer for those who don't have to break the bank for it. . . Ninkasi is a brand that puts the Pacific Northwest on the map, and their stout only bolsters their name. . ."

"Oh my god! this is the best beer I ever tasted. Chocolate and coffee notes give way to ab absolutely heavy mouthfeel. Very little bitterness. This is what I drink every day, I accept no substitute. I always pour it a little fast so the tan head is nice and thick. There is nothing light and watery about this beer!"

"O - A quality choice in the Oatmeal Stout world. Good flavor."
"Pours a solid dark brown/black with a decent sized bubbly tan head that quickly dissipates to a small cap on top. Aromas of coffee and chocolate with bits of caramel and cereal grains and hints of fruit. The flavor is what I expected from the aroma. Roasted creamed coffee with a touch of chocolate and caramel and a hint of lactose? Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Decent brew, but seems a bit lacking in body and mouthfeel."
"O: Good beer, not particularly memorable but a good specimen of its class."
""
"Overall I do like this oatmeal stout, as I think its on par with 8 ball stout and some others, pretty good."
"O: A delicious stout. I'd love to have a bourbon barrel aged version of perhaps an imperial Vanilla Oatis."

"Pours opaque black with a light brown head which quickly dissipates into almost nothing. Aroma is very sweet--milk chocolate, vanilla, even bananas--with a hint of espresso and roasted barley. Velvety smooth in the mouth, thick as it should be, sticks to your tastebuds but goes down easy. Bitter hops & roasted barley followed by a sweet, lingering finish of bananas and chocolate. Taste sticks with you for awhile. Lots of necessary hops to balance out what I'd consider a (delicious) dessert stout."
""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a charcoal almost completely black with s two inch dark tsn head that leaves plenty of lace behind. Smell is vanilla, chocolate, coffee, and biscuit. Taste is dominated by vanilla and roasty expresso. Body is maybe medium, plenty of carbonation, a touch dry, and goes down plenty easy. This is a very nice porter, with a vanilla twist."

"Not a huge stout or porter guy, really dig dipa's and ales but this brew got me. Pours a dark brown/black with a tan/khaki head. Chocolate and malt notes come to the nose. A nicely balanced stout that tastes of chocolate, coffee, and toffee and with a nice malt backbone. My favorite stout for sure."

"Overall, A highly well balanced stout. The only thing wrong might be the thin and burnt tastes, and also nothing makes it stand out. It's a good example of a stout, one that I would love to have again. It just doesn't do anything exceptional or exceptionally different. Definitely try this one though, it could turn out to be a favorite."
"The first words that come to mind upon taking a sniff and a sip of Oatis are ""milk chocolate truffle"" and ""malt-tastic", respectively. But this delightful beer's not all sweetness--they made sure to add a little hoppy bite to balance everything out. Aesthetically, Oatis is a dream--It looks and feels like cold carbonated molasses. Rock on, Ninkasi, rock on."

"Overall - This is a very good oatmeal stout, especially after it's warmed a bit and is drank with a fair pace. Drinking it with leisure is not recommended, as the true nature of the bitterness is hidden when sips come several minutes between, but even then it's a very solid brew. This is definitely an oatmeal stout I will be returning to in the near future."

"O: Overall, a great beer, quite delicious to enjoy in the winter, does a great job of warming the body in the middle of a New England winter."
""

"Doesn't really hold up as an imperial stout here, yet strangely, even with all of the coffee characteristics and lightened body, it doesn't quite remind me of a porter or a brown ale as well. This is most definitely a hybrid, and sadly, all of the flavors and thin body don't meld well together to me. The burnt notes definitely become distracting after some time. I tried a bottle from the same six pack as this over a month ago and it seems it doesn't seem to improve very substantially in the bottle, despite the higher ABV. I expected better from Ninkasi. Hopefully they can tweak this recipe or throw out a new one that I'll enjoy in the future."
"Ninkasi has more top shelf beers than any other brewer. This one is one of my favorites"
""
""
""
""
"This tastes like delicious food. Cocoa oatmeal is the wave of the future. This isn't the best oatmeal stout out there, but it's definitely the most like food. Bonus points for food."
"O: A decent oatmeal stout, I think i will stick to the hoppier Ninkasi beers though."
""
""
""
"A slightly different oatmeal stout that I'm used to in that it favors the bitter more than the sweet. This gives it layers and complexity and makes it pretty yummy. Overall, an easy drinker, despite the hoppy bitter finish and moderate alcohol, which you can taste."
"Overall a very good stout. I would have this again."
"O: It's an okay, oatmeal stout but it just doesn't quite come together"

"I liked most aspects of this together but on thier own each of them lacked just a certain ""something"". A case of the whole being better than the sum of its parts for me. Nothing ground breaking but still enjoyable."
"It is hoppier than most stouts and features black coffee and unsweetened cocoa - these characteristics combine to make this far more bitter than one might expect. Not necessarily a bad trait, just an advanced notice!"

""
""

"O- This is a generously hopped stout, very assertive bitterness from the hops and also bitter charred notes. Easy to drink, this could be Black IPA, but it does not really have the chocolate and roasted coffee notes I really like in a stout."
""
"Overall/Comments: A very solid stout with good flavor and drinkability. Classified as an Oatmeal Stout at 7.2%."
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. A foamy lattice work of lace forms around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, toasted oats, and cocoa. A slight soy sauce aroma comes out as the beer warms up. Taste is much the same with the slight soy sauce flavor and a mild alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that tastes better than it smells in my opinion."
""
""
""
""

"Pours a pitch black with a super creamy light brown head. Smells of freshly ground espresso. Taste begins with a bittersweet chocolate flavor, transistioning to some light caramel, and some juicy stone fruit in the finish. A leafy raw hop flavor at the very end with some matching bitterness. Mouthfeel is rich, nice low carbonation. Overall an excellent Oatmeal stout, I would love to have this again."
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown/ black with brown head that retains nicely. Opaque appearance and decent lacing. Nose features delectable roasted barley and oats as well vanilla. Taste is very chocolatey with heavy oat quality that also leaves a bready aftertaste. Nice all around stout flavor with great balance. Mouthfeel is smooth and moderately carbonated. Overall, nicely balance oatmeal stout that is more than worth a try."
"O: B+"
""
"Review from 1/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a very dark brown. Medium brown head and lacing. Aroma of roasted and sweet malt, coffee. Roasted malt up front, with light hint of coffee and a slightly hopped finish. Medium bodied for an oatmeal stout. Not remarkable, but solid and tasty. Worth a revisit. Great price point."
"A pretty decent oatmeal stout. Touches on some nice character, though it skirts the borders of being a ""good"" example of the style. The flavor character seems to be less rounded than I would like. Seems to follow suit on the other beers I have tried from this brewery, though this one clings to style parameters a bit better than the others. Well, a lot better."
""
""
""
""
"The taste follows the nose, roasty and warm. Smoothe oats, and a little bit of hop bittering to balance it out. A very well executed and nicely balanced oatmeal stout. I am a very big fan of this one."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours pitch black color with a nice 2 finger dense mocha head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of milk chocolate, caramel, toffee, roasted malt, coffee, toast, herbal, oats, nuttiness, and light dark fruits. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, coffee, oats, toast, toffee, herbal, nuttiness, and light dark fruits. Low amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, coffee, roasted malt, toffee, oats, herbal, and light dark fruit on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of roasted flavors with malt sweetness; and quite robust with no cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed at all after the finish. Overall this is a very nice oatmeal stout. Very nice balanced roasted and robust flavors; and very easy to drink. Maybe a touch too fruity, but still very enjoyable."
"O- every once in awhile I need to have a stout, and this is my fav stout out there. Quite good."
""
"Maybe I've just eaten too many oats lately, or maybe this just has a lot of oats in the grain bill. Did I mention there are a lot of oats in this? It's definitely good, but not epic."

"O: A great oatmeal stout with loads of flavor and complexity."
"Serving type: bomber bottle poured into imperial pint glass"
""
"Overall, this is a fine example of the style, with perhaps just a little bit too much bitterness for my tastes. With a few tweaks this could be up there with HBI for me, and that's high praise."
"O-a good oatmeal stout with a good array of flavors"
""
""
""
"Favorite beers (for comparison, after all taste preferences are subjective): Elysian's Daedalus Irish Stout, Rogue's Hazelnut Brown Nectar, Allagash's White Ale, New Belgium's 1554, Full Sail's Wassail, etc. Beers I don't like: IPAs (with few exceptions)"

"I love it that the beer doesn't make compromises. It doesn't try to give lighter impressions to gain the consumership of timid beer drinkers. Nor does it propel into imperial status in a showy kinda way. It's a strong Oatmeal Stout- take it or leave it. I take it! Thanks a bunch Steamhead!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely a nice beer, I was expecting a beer that was a little bigger at this strength; some extra malt would actually help to balanced out the ample roast character and would help to accentuate the viscous character one expects from an oatmeal stout."
""
"This is quite a nice Oatmeal Stout. The aroma lacks a bit (but is growing on me as I work through the bottle). Nice appearance, flavor and especially mouthfeel. Has some Sweet Stout characteristics as well. Good stuff!"

"definatly an enjoyable beer, if this was local to me, i could see drinking this again."

"O: This beer is not a good example of an oatmeal stout. could be the bottle, but I won't know unless somebody else gives me some of their bottle, because this is shite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
" ~ This is a good beer and one I would certainly recommend to my friends. It's not necessarily something I would seek out again if I make it back to the Pacific Northwest but if it presented itself I would take advantage."
""
"O- Nothing really that got me to excited. A nice drink, but could have more flavors come through. Glad I got to try, thanks Scott!"
"I've had this beer multiple times and it is a go to stout for me. It pours a nice, dark body with reddish tones. The head is khaki with a little lacing. The flavor is what draws me to it. It is a little on the sweeter side for a stout but not too sweet to be a porter. The smell is very nice, full of malts, a little bit of chocolate and coffee. The nice thing also is the hop characteristics. I enjoy a bit of a hoppy stout every now and then and this has a great balance to it. I'm not a huge fan of Ninkasi, but this beer is very delicious and as stated before is a great go to if there isn't anything new to try."

"Overall, a decent, enjoyable take on the style. A bit thin but it really doesn't detract from the beer as much as it normally does for a stout. Not the best but certainly not the worst example."
"O- Good beer, not a great one. Nice flavor and smell, but not complex with either one. Mouthfeel leaves much to be desired. Looks awfully nice though."
"This is my 2nd beer from Ninkasi and it's another good beer. I look forward to trying more of their lineup."
"O: This is a very thin beer, not the overall experience I expect from a stout. Aroma and taste leave nothing exceptional. Not bad for under $4, wouldn't try again."
"O: Not the best in it's class but it's tasty and the feel is spot on. The hops seem to balance this one out so it's not too sweet and not too bitter."
"Not my personal favorite stout, but I have to say at $3.99 a 22oz. Bottle, pretty good deal."
"The mouthfeel is a standout, but the flavor’s a little too subtle. Smooth and drinkable, but not big enough for me."
"Overall – A solid stout. One that went down quickly without me realizing. Glad I was able to try this."
"We liked this stout but were not overly impressed. Poured very black with a thin beige head. Not much aroma evident. Taste was very good. Malty, bready and smooth. Nice creamy mouthfeel. Not the best stout out there but we definately wouldn't mind having another."
"Black as night with a dense brown cap. Good head retention with thick, chunky, sheets of bubbles coating the glass. Chocolatey, roasty aroma, bittersweet and milk chocolate, malted milk. Strong grassy bitterness and roast up front, less sweet than the aroma would suggest, semisweet chocolate, light fruitiness. Medium to full bodied with low carbonation, smooth. Pretty good, but the flavour didn't quite live up to the promise of the aroma."
"A really nice balanced oatmeal stout. Big flavour and very nice."
"Overall this was a nice beer. It was better the first day out of the growler then the second but most beers are this way for good reason."
"Ninkasi can evidently do dark beers as well as they can hop bombs - who'd have thunk it? This oatmeal stout is as thick, sludgy, and flavourful as any I've had from the good ol' U.S of A. and I'm sure that's something the brewery would have known before ever even releasing it commercially. These guys know what they're doing and they don't mess around."
"Poured into a Deschutes tulip. Dark brown, not quite opaque, with a thin, light head. Light roasty smell, with a similar but stronger roasty flavor, almost coffee-y aftertaste. Nice level of carbonation, although a little thin, overall a tasty oatmeal stout."
"oatis is a reliably good (bordering on great) oatmeal stout."
"Pours an opaque dark-chocolate brown with just a hint of a light tan head. Smoky aroma has quality coffee, semi-sweet chocolate and molasses tones plus hints of licorice and toffee. Mouth-filling flavor has a firm smoky overtone and molasses, quality coffee, chocolate, licorice and toffee flavors - delicious! Smooth yet lively texture leaves a smoky and fizzy finish. Recommended!"
"Is there such a thing as dry graining? The nose is all grain here, with no beta acid detectable, and a relatively high portion of alpha for the style."
"D-The roasted character in this one is way too much for me; I much prefer the sweeter examples of oatmeal stouts."
"O - An oatmeal stout, nothing spectacular but certainly above average. A solid brew by Ninkasi who has yet to truly dissapoint me."
"An enjoyable stout for what it is, however it strays liberally from anything I'd recognize as an Oatmeal Stout. Would have scored it higher than I have if going by the brewery's listed style, but still high marks for what it is regardless. More like an American Oatmeal Stout?"
"O: Seems like a real good beer to me. Head and lacing could've been better and so could have the mouthfeel. Smell and taste were great. Will definitely purchase again."
"O - I enjoyed it."
"Overall, its really good. I would say that splitting the bomber is best as this could become cloying in the near future."
"Overall a top notch beer. Just about ideal for the style."
"Thin bodied and sweeter than expected with a prominent chocolate flavor that compliments the dark roasted notes. Lots of oatmeal as well as some coffee bean, toast, caramel, toffee and nut. Very hoppy for the style with dry bitterness and earthy pine notes that overpower the malt character a bit too much for my liking. Dry finish."
"Overall i like the flavor of this beer, a little outside the style of a classic oatmeal stout but very tasty nonetheless."
"O: I've had this beer several times before, and I will have it again many more times. It's a good beer to split with someone else, but I think 1-2 of these in an evening would make most people pretty happy."
"Overall this is a GREAT beer at an even better price. Ninkasi isn't big around here, so it's super cheap at my local. Don't know how long that will last though. I hope their other beers are just as good."
"O: I have never tried an Oatmeal Stout before and this is great! I absolutely love this. I WILL be buying this again. Everything about this craft beer is at least 'nice' if not good. Definitely give this a try if you see it."
"The mouthfeel feels on the thicker side with some excellent creaminess for the style. Overall I really liked this beer, I love the style and this one really showcased the oats nicely. The big chocolate and roasty were really nice in it too. Very enjoyable beer overall and a very good beer of the style."
"Hmm... time to pick up some BORIS now to make me feel better."
"Pours a big two finger head, the majority of the bubbles are big, some are smaller underneath, we'll see how long it hangs around for. The head is light brown in color, it looks like milk chocolate, and the body is completely pitch black, no visibility through this at all, maybe some hues of brown when held up to the light. The head has faded a little bit, but the bubbles and overall look see to be more creamy now. Overall it looks ok. Not too much of a complex smell on the nose, you get that big malt note up front, smells like chocolate and roasted malts, then you get maybe a little bit of oats, not much else though. You can actually smell the alcohol, which is a little off putting. First thing I notice when I drink this beer is the mouthfeel, it' pretty awesome, nice and thick. The second thing I notice is the smoothness of this, it just glides down the throat, all the flavors mixing in nicely, frankly I'm liking this a lot more than I thought I would. As far as flavors go, they are just all mixed in so well, so they are hard to pick out and identify, but I would say the first thing I notice is the nice big malt flavor, then the roastyness and chocolate flavor, polished off with the slightest hop bite. There is a nice crispness too, which I usually am not a fan of in my stouts, but it works in this beer for some reason. For as many flavors I'm getting, and as for how much flavor it has I'm surprised that it is this smooth and this easy drinking, but it just goes down like nothing. Overall I'm much more impressed with this beer than I thought I would be, good beer, well done, tasty, and easy drinking!"
"Overall: A nice treat ...good for a try.."
"Yes drinkable. But not memorable. Best thing about this beer was the dryness of the hops, and lack of any soy-like maltiness, however it really lacks what you're seeking in a ""stout", I think."
"overall, this is a good oatmeal stout - would definitely get this again"

"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is just below medium bodied with pretty fine carbonation. Reasonably smooth drinking. This beer is quite drinkable. All of the flavors are on par with the style. Nothing off-putting at all."
"Drink- Pretty good but was expecting a bit more. Very drinkable and had a nice blend of flavors that were palatable and tasty."
"Can't say I'm overly impressed with this offering from Ninkasi, especially if you compare it to the level that Portsmouth has for their Oatmeal Stout."
"Final Notes: This beer was pleasing in every way. I would definitely drink this again and I hope to add it to my rotation. A bit pricey and pretty alcoholic, but worth it."
"D: Great beer, well balanced. Nothing to complain about here."
"D: This one's very easy drinking but nothing really stands out here. An overall middle-of-the-road offering. Worth a try but nothing much to say about it besides that."
"Pours a jet black with medium tan head that diminishes fast. Awesome chocolate and toasted malt aromas coming from this beer. I also get coffee and biscuits. Taste is a nice amount of bitterness and huge oatmeal flavor. The oatmeal goes great with the coffee and chocolate flavors. I also get slight vanilla and caramel flavors. Mouthfeel is a bit on the light side for an oatmeal stout. Alcohol is hidden extremely well. Drinkability is very high."
"Pretty hoppy for an oatmeal stout leads to the linger being way too long. Malts really do taste burnt at first and the bitterness really takes over. Although I may have been spoiled by some very good oatmeal stouts lately, the chacteristic mouthfeel of an oatmeal stout isn't quite there, possibly thrown off by the hops. In the end, it was a bit of a chore to finish."
"D - Easy to drink. Enjoyable overall, but not a great beer. A fairly plain stout. Goes down smooth and disappears quickly."
"D - Very drinkable. Goes down smooth and the taste makes me want more. Not my favorite oatmeal stout, but definitely good and would get it again."
"D- This beer is quite tasty. Not sure I could do more than a bomber at a time, but very enjoyable."
"Verdict: Although not trying to dazzle you with tricks, this is one of the most well-done stouts America has to offer as a regular."
"MF: Texture is sweet but not the typical full-body that you might expect in an oatmeal stout. I wish it was a little more creamy, but it drinks like a little like a porter. Pretty deceptive in its ABV, and definitely a delicious beer."
"I thought this was quite nice for what it was."
"Powdery cocoa on the front palate. Nice and slick. Some pleasant earth and oat dust on the tongue. A return to cocoa on the finish with a touch of anise. Mouthfeel is slick, a tad thin, not as full and creamy or smooth as I'd like for the style. Still a tasty beer though. Fairly bitter and too roasty for the style in my opinion; this really craves some mouthfeel/body thickening maltiness which is key for an Oatmeal stout to keep in in balance."
"drinks pretty well. alcohol is almost non existent. balance is well done, but a heavier body would accentuate the maltiness better."
"Drinkable but not highly so. It is a good beer but not an extremely complex beer."
"There is an oat creamy ""soft"" character to the beer but, while the flavors are not bad, there is a ""thin"" character - flavors are assertive but taste watered down a bit. Again, not terrible just really tastes a bit like carbonated black coffee."
"Poured near jet black except for some ruby highlights when held in the light,a creamy toasted almond colored head atop.Heavy roast in the nose along with faint smoke and wood,light bitter chocolate shows thru just a little.Roasty and raw on the palate,very dry with faint smoke in the finish,just a very light chocolate sweetness.This is one no holds barred hoppy stout,its big and roasty,I liked it."
"Good medium-bodied mouthfeel and easy drinking. Nice and smooth and creamy."
"Well I couldn't wait any longer and went for the reveal. Answer is Ninkasi Oatis Oatmeal Stout. I like it, good drinkability. I've had a few Ninkasi's, I loved Maiden the Shade (sweet artwork as well) and this is another solid offering from them."
"This Oatmeal Stout, when poured was thick and the color was very dark brown. The smell of roasted malts and cocoa had a pleasant aroma. Now, the flavor was a little more complex. I could taste dark roasted malts, cocoa, smoked coffee beans, that finish with a semi-sweet/tart and bitter feel on the palate. Very pleasant Oatmeal Stout, not overlly bitter like alot of Stouts."
"D: Mouthfeel was the best thing about this beer. Goes down very easily for being fairly high ABV. This is a great oatmeal stout."
"D - Very drinkable. This is a good stout, solid taste and easy drinking. The only (slight) letdown is the body. A little creaminess or softness is what I expect in an oatmeal stout and it was not there."
"Very solid overall. It's not really incredibly exceptional in any particular way, but it's executed well in every area."
"A very tasty oatmeal stout. Indeed, it's probably one of the best examples I've tasted. Lovely flavours, pleasant texture, great drinkability. A great drop of beer. Ninkasi have done it again."
"drinkability - very flavorful, dessert-like, excellent oatmeal stout, could easily be a go to brew"
"D-mmm 4"
"Pours a rich black with a nice tan/mocha head. Medium roast and dark chocolate aroma. Very pleasant. Medium-thin texture. The roasted malts are definitely present in the taste. It almost can't wait to attack your pallet. Dry finish. This is one of the few stouts that I cant get some of that hop flavor, I usually can't taste it. Actually, after a few more sips they hops become more apparent. The malt and hops are perfectly balanced. The coalesce to great one great taste. The hops do not over power, but back up the dark malt for a complimentary boost With what I am tasting the texture is right on (although I am in favor of fuller body stouts). Any thicker and it would probably be too sweet. The over all experience ain't too bad. Definitely better than Anderson Valley's. This may not be the best, but definitely good to have around."
"More like a porter than a stout in some ways - but a nice flavor profile. Rather sessionable despite the ABV. Would love to try the vanilla version of this..."
"O - Flavors are good enough, and the price is right. Solid buy, but probably no more than one a day."
"D-This is decent oatmeal stout, but not quite on par with what I have come to expect from Ninkasi. Good value at $3.99 a bomber compared to other breweries."
"Drinkability is also great, this is a very pleasant and easy to drink oatmeal stout, well done Ninkasi."
"Drinkability: overall, this is a damn solid stout. The hops seem a little rough around the edges, especially in the aroma, but the malt characteristics are basically spot-on for the style. Additionally, this thing drinks like a 5% beer, not like the 7.5% at which it's listed. I'd gladly quaff this again; indeed, I'd love to try it on tap sometime."
"D: Yes for sure, but not every day."
"Drinkability is pretty good. It's a smooth typical oatmeal stout that drinks fast and is nicely refreshing. Recommended as a good cheap stout to pair with food."
"The taste is similar, with very strong, sweet roastiness of heavily toasted brown bread and caramelised barley, singed-caramelised prunes, a definite oatmeal character lightly noticeable. It has strong sweetness throughout, but also a strong burnt-woody bitterness that just barely takes over at the finish. However, it lacks depth and complexity and alcoholic strength is rather noticeable. This, combined with the heaviness of the traits noted above, brings down the drinkability."
"D - Smells and color great but sadly a bit overly bitter and under-flavored."
"Poured a thick brown/black into a pint glass with a finger of quick-receding coffee-colored head. Strong toasty aroma of chocolate, coffee, and oats. Moderate carbonation and a fairly light mouthfeel. Lots of oats up front followed by coffee and a lingering milk chocolate finish with hints of hoppy bitterness. Very tasty and easy drinking -- the lightness achieved is impressive given the style and relatively high ABV."
"D: this beer actually lives up to its name with great oatmeal flavors and nice chocolate presence that really goes down nice and creamy. Hopefully I can get more of this stuff."
"Dark brown opaque body no visible carbonation, one finger brown head medium dissipation with significant lacing. Nose is a pretty big chocolate hit with good grassy hop presence. Taste features chocolate up front, pretty sweet but not much coffee notes, very smooth. Full mouthfeel, above average effervescence, not sticky despite sweetness. Dangerously drinkable. Not sure I pick up the oats, but this is one very smooth beer."
"Drinkability- really good stout, perfect for an overcast day which was when I was drinking it. Very nice"
"All told, I'd give the beer a B-. That is to say, the flavor is pleasant, though not pleasant enough to make me want to buy another one."
"D - A 22oz'er went down easy enought. No alcohol presence. A good beer, but not great, and not one to rush back to for me. Good value, but needs more oat presence."
"Overall: The mouth feel is creamy, rich, robust, and deep. The body of the beer is medium thick and the finish is medium full. This is a wonderful brew. Lots of flavor, character, and very easy to drink ."
"D: A solid oatmeal stout, doesn't get real sweet. Just the roasted big malt flavours, almost like an Irish Dry. A nice introduction to the newly in CA Ninkasi, let's see what their other beers have to offer."
"Pours a thick brown head that dissipates quickly leaving behind a bubbly lilly pad on top and rim. Deep toasted, chocolate and coffee malts are present. Sharp coffee note at first which staggers into a roasted malt after taste mixed with a bitter and astringent flavor. This is a well rounded beer that does not fill you up. I could drink many many of these here beers, too bad I only have the one."
"From a 22 oz. bottle purchased locally. Aroma is roasty with a coffee note. No noticeable hops. Jet black with a tan head that dissipated to a thin ring of tight bubbles around the top of the glass. Flavor is assertive in the roast with a large bittersweet chocolate note in the finish. Just enough sweetness to round out the roast. Some hop bitterness, but no real hop flavor. Some biscuit notes once it warms up. Thick mouthfeel, very chewy, and a little slick from the oats. A good stout, balanced to the roasty side, but improves as it warms up. Like liquid bittersweet chocolate."
"Drinkability: Loved it! This is the quintessential oat stout. Bold, flavorful, full, and addictive. Can't wait to try this again!"
"Bottle, home. The mouthfeel works against this otherwise great beer. It's just a tad too thin to support the roasty, coffee bean fruitiness of the malt. I think more chocolate flavor would come out if the beer had a creamier feel. There's cocoa, roast, raisin-sweet malt and a touch of hops, though less than expected. The beer is somewhat acidic and of moderate sweetness. It's an excellent value, better than many similar stouts. Thanks for starting distribution here, Ninkasi."
"This beer pours a jet black color with a pretty looking khaki one finger head. There is minimal carbonation activity after the pour. I am picking up smell notes of the oatmeal backed with chocolate and roasted malts. The taste of the beer goes hand in hand with the smell characteristics of the beer. It finishes very smooth which makes it very easy to drink. Overall a nice tasting beer with a good look and smell. I recieved this beer from madhombrewer as an unexpected thank you package. A nice beer that I am glad I have tried but I would like to see what else is out in the Portland scene when it comes to stouts."
"Overall, an all-around solid beer. I'll have to seek out some other stuff from Ninkasi."
"D - impressive oatmeal stout, just missing a touch more body to take it to the top...still one of the best that i have had. robust and complex, treating me quite well after a couple hours of snow shoveling."
"Appearance is a dark rich brown with a nice pillowy light brown head that sticks around awhile leaving nice lace. Smell owns a slightly sweet dark roasted coffee aroma. Taste has the roasted malts, coffee and more bitter than sweet chocolate, could use a little more malt to balance the hop. Mouthfeel is a good hearty solid stout with the right amount of carbonation."
"A rich stout with full flavors. My first from this brewery and I am impressed."
"It is disappointingly thin for an oatmeal stout, and here, coffee takes center stage, and soon, left and right stage, virtually pushing any other contenders out. Unidimensional, and not that pleasant."
"Other comments: A really tasty oat soda. Well-balanced and more-ish."
"Doesn't stand out much from other oatmeal stouts, but it doesn't disappoint either. A solid and drinkable beer that lacks the smoother, thicker mouthfeel found in most other oatmeal stouts."
"Drinkability- Overall this is a pretty darned tasty brew. I like the nice malty chocolatyness a lot but I really wish the oatmeal lived up to the name. The carbonation is too intense to fully get the oatmeal goodness. All in all though, tasty beer. Thanks Jason!"
"One of the finer Oat meal stouts I've had. All flavor nodes well balanced, and an extremely drinkable mix. Bought a bottle of this the very next day to add to my collection. Ninkasi is one of those breweries to keep your eye on. Have some GREAT beers out right now."
"Overall good stout, wasn't picking up on oatmeal, but a delicious stout none the less."
"Awesome!!!"
"Overall a very fine oatmeal stout, and one i will surely be purchasing again soon. Nice and drinkable, yet packed with flavor and substance. A very nice beer, and one i would dare say is my favorite so far from Ninkasi. (although the only others ive had are the IPA and DIPA, haha)"
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for a stout. All of this combines for a good, easy to drink stout."
"This is a nice stout with lots of substance and serious drinkability. It's definitely not just for breakfast."
"D: Damn drinkable. Really is a drinkable tasty stout."
"Pours a smooth opaque black with a thin khaki head that leaves a heavy ring around the glass as well as thick lacing down the glass as this beer is drank. The nose is chocolate and espresso dominated but has some vanilla and some roasted aromas in there as well. The flavor is sweet chocolate, toffee and vanilla that finishes bitter and dry. Its a full bodied beer that is velvety smooth. This stout is an easy drinker and has some nice subtle complexities."
"Had this on tap and in bottles and there doesn't seem to be that much of a difference. It's definitely a winter-time type of beer, just because it's pretty heavy. Poured out it's thick and black with a satisfying brown head. The smell is fantastic - mainly of coffee, but also some chocolate malts and the oats themselves. Tasty tasty - lots of oaky oatmeal flavor. Not a KBS, but pretty close. It's a heavy beer - unless you haven't eaten for a while you might only want one of these. Good stuff as always from Ninkasi."
"- Super drinkable and not too creamy think... slightly warm, but no taste of alcohol at all.... a great sessionable stout."
" Oatmeal stouts should be thick and strong, not easy drinking. For an easy drinking stout, try the Dry Irish versions. Worth trying if you see it, not worth seeking out."
"D: A very straightforward oatmeal stout. I liked it but wasn't blown away by it."
"Ninkasi comes through yet again. Oatis is good beer that is a barley boost away from being great beer. I could definitely waste some time sitting on the dock of the bay if I had a few bombers of this tasty oatmeal stout to keep me company."
"Ninkasi is one of my favorite breweries that I've had the pleasure to discover after moving to Oregon. I've had Oatis on several occassions, and wish I had taken notes on the Vanilla Oatis that I had a while back..."
"Overall, a very good Oatmeal Stout that was perfect on a dark and windy day here in the Land of Hops!"
"Drinkability- Light and dry, especially for a 7.5 ABV. If oatmeal stout is your brew, you could do this brew all night, but you'd probably get as roasted as the barley."
"Drinkability is good, this one is super smooth and balanced,with the alcohol DANGEROUSLY hidden. Still, it's always been much more enjoyable on draught then this bottle, which I admit is probably a few months old and has been stored at room temp (at least in the dark!) for about half that."
"This is a very good beer. I'll have to pick up another bottle or two of this. If you see it, buy some and enjoy. I can't wait to try more beers from Ninkasi."
"Overall: Not a session oatmeal stout, very strong alcohol at 7.5% Very balanced for a strong stout. smooth non tannic finish for amount of dark grains going into this brew. Best Oatmeal stout ive tried thus far."
"Pours a dark opaque brown color with a small fizzy brown head that leaves some sticking. Sweet roasted caramel malt nose, slightly smokey with some hints at chocolate and subtle fruity hops. Sweet malts upfront, smooth and balanced with a dry and bitter finish followed by a long smokey, chocolate malt aftertaste. I wish the flavor didnt drop off so quickly at just about mid-palate, add another notch or 2 to the body and heres an absolute winner."
"All in all, a solid, straightforward brew. Balanced, almost subtle flavors should make this beer pair with a wider range of food than many other stouts, in my opinion. My biggest complaint is the price, as reflected in my drinkability score. Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout is my benchmark for the style, and I could have bought almost two for the price of one bomber of this."
"A grower, basically. Give this one time and warming--its charms are not immediately apparent. So many of us, myself included, want knock-you-over-the-head and send-you-under-the-table action from our stouts--you know, those enormous monsters--but this isn't trying to be that at all. It's a refreshing change of pace from my usual stout fixations, and a quality brew by any standard. Sent by the ever-gracious msubulldog25, my Oregon connection. Keep 'em comin', 'dog25!"
"D - This is a really good oatmeal stout. I really want to try more stuff from Ninkasi."
"Poured a deep dark black with a good size tan head that faded fairly fast, great lacing the side of my pint glass was covered. Smells of chocolate, oats, maybe a hint of coffee in there. Tasted great, chocolate, oats, nutty flavor, coffee. This is a thick and creamy beer. First I have had from Ninkasi and I hope I can get a hold of this again."
"Overall this is a quality oatmeal stout. Definitely a good beer to keep around at all times, especially on a lazy sunday."
"taste is smooth, of milk chocolate, coffee, roasted nuts, vanilla, a touch of sour malt, ends slightly dry and a little bitter."
"D: Get and try it! One of the best examples of a oatmeal stout I have had in a while. A valiant and bold brew. Do I dare say that a little more malt backbone would help things out a little, maybe I am just being picky? Good stuff"
"Received as an extra in a trade from a generous BA. Pours a dark black with a very small brown head, no retention and some lacing. Smells like coffee and oatmeal, some sweet malt. Taste is of bittersweet chocolate, black coffee, cocoa beans, brown sugar, and oatmeal. Alcohol is hidden within the rich and complex flavors. Full bodied and carbonation is low. I'm happy to see another bottle offering from Ninkasi and this one is well done."
"4/4.5/4/4/4"
"The aroma was great of roasted malts with a hint of chocolate. The taste was really smooth and full of malty goodness. It had a tiny hop presence on the finish which rounded it out nicely. In the mouth it was creamy and lathering over the palate. Having an oatmeal stout like this one makes me remember why it is one of my top 5 favorite styles. This was an excellent brew and I will definitely be buying this one again."
"Drinkability is really high on this one, and when the bottle was empty, I was disappointed. The abv doesn't seem all that apparent to me, and the flavors were impressive. I feel that the mouthfeel suffers a bit out of the bottle, as can be expected, however one of the highlights of Oatis on tap is the impressiveness of the mouthfeel, which doesn't quite come across as well out of a bomber. Still an impressive brew with some incredible flavors. Definitely worth a shot."
"Taste is mocha with a mildly bitter finish. The cocoa and coffee are very well balanced. The oats give the beer good body and make it very smooth. Drinkability is good if you don't mind the 7.2% abv. Very nice seasonal."
"Overall a drinkable OS, good but really could have been a great one if the mouthfeel had been thicker."
"Drinkability - Not a session beer, but one to try again on a cool eve. Stout fans should definitely give it a shot."
"Everything else was full-on, bold, uncompromised, and entrancing."
"drinkability - well, the keg was gone by the end of the night. what more can i say?"
"D: One of the best Oatmeal Stouts I've had the pleasure of tasting; I'll be happy if this is available year-round. Excellent balance and pairing with lunch, and certainly one I'd have again. I hope that it's brewed often."
