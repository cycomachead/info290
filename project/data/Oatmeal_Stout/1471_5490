The taste was very strong, tasted of roasted malts and coffee with hints of chocolate.  The finish was a little on the bitter and smoky side.  Left my mouth feeling a little dry.  Not a bad brew, but I prefer others in the Dark Horse series.","JPowell712","Mar 16, 2015"

Bubbly head dissipated quickly, revealing a viscous, glassy top. Smell is roasted malt, coffee, some bitterness or sourness. Pretty big nose, even when cold. Taste is tangy sweet up-front, reminiscent of berries. This immediately leads to a strong roasted malt flavor: coffee, dark chocolate. Farther back some sweetness, more roast, LOTS of roast. Finish is lots of lingering roast, some hop bitterness too. Mouthfeel is full, way thicker than I would expect, and decent carbonation. I haven't had this beer in a long time, and it exceeded my recollections. It's super-roasty which is this beer's calling card. There is sweetness and bitterness too that gives some complexity, but nothing over-the-top. I need to buy more.","foobula","Jun 19, 2014"

Nose smelled like someone had melted a milk chocolate candy bar and poured it into my glass. Color was a deep, dark-brown allowing ZERO light penetration (SRM = 44). Mouthfeel was big and chewy, like a dollop of fudge atop my tongue. Phew! The taste was smoky, more towards campfire than house fire, with a chocolaty sweetness that left me wondering what had possessed me. I like hoppy beers, not malt-driven ones, but even so, I will give this a fair shake. Finish continued to be fudgy, sweet and not really my cup of tea. I do not mind bitter stouts, but sweet is never going to make it into my wheelhouse.","woodychandler","Jan 22, 2014"

Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, light char, oats, toast, toffee, dark bread, light vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt notes; with great strength. Taste of dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, light char, oats, toast, toffee, dark bread, light vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, light char, oats, toast, toffee, dark bread, and light vanilla on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt flavors; with great robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy, moderately slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent oatmeal stout! All around great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 18, 2013"

The beer's nose is mildly sweet, with chocolate and cream notes, and a hint of coffee highlights. Flavors are rich, with a more bitter dark chocolate character in the forefront, balanced with a toasty, almost charred, balancing taste. Coffee grounds make an appearance on the tongue, as well as a subtle hint of hops in the background. The flavors blend together well, but are a bit abrasive overall. Good, smooth body despite the bitter characteristics, with a good lacing left along the glass. The aftertaste is a mix of bitter dark chocolate and day old coffee, with a bitter twinge left on the tongue and in mouth. The finish lingers on quite a bit, although not entirely unpleasant. There is a slight drying in mouth that begs for another drink. Flavor profiles and mouthfeel lean me more towards an Irish Dry stout versus Oatmeal, but a decent brew, regardless.","GarthDanielson","Dec 28, 2011"

Mild roast/burnt/bitter/astringent taste lingers on the palate after each sip. This is pretty thin and slightly watery for being an oatmeal stout. Decent carbonation but the mouthfeel is off.

This beer was pretty on point with only a couple minor tweaks this could be one of the best Oatmeal Stouts on the market. In terms of the stout series I thought the Tres was the best with too and one tying for second and fore being the one I liked the least, overall Dark Horse did a pretty good job with this series, now I have to try and track down Plead the fith, you would think that living in Michigan it would be easy to find, but it isn't.

Very good.","BieresDesMoines","Mar 23, 2011"

It smells of very sweet milk chocolate and has decent roasted notes. The coffee is pretty subdued and it also has almost a vanilla accent. The flavor is pretty solid. It's slightly smoky and has a little oak to it. It definitely has a lot of dark roasted malt and has a solid bitter chocolate flavor that follows into the aftertaste. It's pretty solid but the more you drink it you get this sweet/sour lactic acid flavor that kind of gets a little old. It drinks pretty smoothly and is in between medium to heavy in body. The alcohol is barely noticeable. The first time I had this I never knew it was 8%. I would've guessed between 5-6%. It's a very solid beer.

The smell is not too strong, but I detected cocoa, oats, and some vanilla. The taste had a bold cocoa and oat taste combined with a strong coffee/roasted flavor. There was also a bit of whiskey in the background. The carbonation is alright on the palate, but it was just a bit too watery for my liking.

4.12,9.9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours pitch black completely opaque body does not let any visible light pass through, nice deep mocha tan head leaves speckled lacing behind all of their beers so far have had a peculiar sort of fizzy carbonation when you first pour the beer. However, when you go to sip it the excess carbonation doesn't come through on the palate. Aromatics offer up deep fruit notes amongst the dark roasts with a creamy cereal grain breakfast brew approach from the oatmeal additions. Some coffee and dark chocolate from the darker roasts with a layer of caramel/toffee flowing, minimal hops going on here. The fruit tone has some deep plum mild tartness and a noticeable alcohol nose not much going on in the way of hops maybe some faint herbal additions. Flavors meld nicely the soft oatmeal with the dark bitter roasts and fruit tone background. A bit of coffee and the dark chocolate but the toffee burnt caramelized sugar note really shines through, ample herbal hop bitterness and alcohol burn from the 8% abv. Mouthfeel a bit of ticklin' from the carbonation but overall a fuller bodied offering with the oatmeal additions keeping it soft and velvety on the palate bitter dark roasts and a touch of alcohol burn stay on the palate with each sip. Drinkability overall is solid a beer that inspires me to want to search out Too, Tres, and Fore from the same series of stouts. It's true I love dark beer from the state of Michigan this one is no different go try some.","WVbeergeek","Dec 13, 2009"

Strong aroma of roast malt, toasted grain, mild chocolate and burnt coffee. All malt in the aroma, no hoppiness. Smooth and silky medium full bodied with minimal carbonation resulting in a lingering aftertaste of burnt malt and sweet chocolate. Flavor is supported by strong roasted malt presence and a balance of burnt coffee and sweet chocolate. Oats provide a light grain texture, but not as strong as expected for the style. Overall sweetness is mild and there is no hop presence. The 8% alcohol makes a fleeting appearance in the finish. Maybe not the best Oatmeal Stout, but in general fits nicely with this series of stouts from Dark Horse, Tres is still my favorite though.","yourefragile","Dec 03, 2009"

Not a bad stout.","Wildman","Nov 25, 2009"
4,6.7,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch brown head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, oatmeal and a bit of coffee and a smoky aroma. However, the aroma is mostly sweet. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like bittersweet chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, charred/burnt malt and some oatmeal. The taste is a lot more bitter than I expected it to be, at least compared to the aroma, anyway. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's rich, creamy and well carbonated. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and easy to drink. Alcohol does hit you after drinking it, but you can't tell it's 8% ABV in the taste at all.

There is a coffee bean astringency in the mix but not out of proportion. Creamy, layered mouthfeel, again more hop astingency, nicey balanced and tasty.

3.69,-1.6,3,4,4,2.5,3.5,"Pours a very beautiful black color. I mean, really black, even the thinnest part of the pour is as dark as some completely poured stouts. However, the head is kind of thin, very thin actually, and dissipates in about 10 seconds. The color has it, but the head does not. The smell is full of roasted malts and sweetness. A bit of that oily sweetness that oats seem to lend. There's a bit of a toasty bread, caramel body in there, but the roasted malts win. The taste comes out with chocolate and incredible dense, grainy, husky, oatmeal sweetness. The sweetness though, isn't very sugary, it's just like heavy burnt syrup. You get to this deep roastiness next, not exactly full of coffee, probably because of the burnt toast kind of hides it, but it comes through nicely. The taste surpasses most oatmeal stouts, but I think I can see some room for improvement - the raw graininess is interesting, but it does too much to hide the roasted flavors. The body is s o incredibly full I can hardly swallow it. I like some body, so that isn't too bad, but the carbonation just stings, which is kind of strange. I'd say that the mouthfeel isn't too impressive. The drinkability is pretty good though. The ABV is pretty high (you don't exactly notice it in the taste), but I actually find myself enjoying this. It's definitely interesting and worth a try. I can actually imagine buying this again.","taylorhamrick","Sep 15, 2009"

Tastes are simple - roasted malts, somewhat oaty, faint alcohol (which is well concealed given the 8% ABV), coffee, and chocolate. Finish is dry, but not overly.

Smell is slight coffee, some deep black malt and a good amount of dark chocolate. This smells very promising. You get a bit more of the roasted coffee in the flavor, but it's not dominant or obtrusive. There's just enough dark chocolate to balance it out. Mouthfeel is pretty decent and fairly smooth.

Aroma is burnt malts with espresso and licorice. There is also a bit of sweetness in the smell as it warms with milk chocolate and vanilla. The taste is also big of the roasted/burnt malt character. The first taste is a sweet chocolate and vanilla blast which gives way to coffee and roasted malts. The sweetness of the malts lingers through the finish with a slight coffee bitterness. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a little carbonation which just coats the mouth with the massive malt flavors. This is a good, if fairly one-dimensional (roasty) stout and I look forward to the rest of the stout series.","gford217","Sep 06, 2008"

Half-inch mocha-colored head dissipated into a thin skim of foam. Lacing was somewhat thin and watery, but left behind a few meandering bands. Scents of coffee and milk chocolate abound; very sweet nose. Taste similar to nose, but sweetness is somewhat cut by a noticeable, but not unpleasant alcohol presence. Mouthfeel was somewhere between light- and medium-bodied, but there was a pronounced slickness as well as an effervescence and light burn throughout the mouth and back of the throat. Excellent stout, but somewhat sweeter than than the oatmeal stouts I've tasted lately. Great drinkability; finished it in under 5 minutes.","Jwale73","Jun 03, 2008"

The nose is extremely roasty and piny from hop. Taking a more deep inhale over top brings a little of the mild oat character. It feels a little focused towards the roast and hop for an oatmeal stout. Taking a sip, I find an initial smooth and creamy oat character overlaying a nicely balanced chocolate sweet and roasted sharpness. This fades to a very nice creamy chocolate finish with just the lightest hint of coffee. Throughout, there is a very green pine hop just laying in with the other flavors. I like this one. Mouthfeel is really nice. There is a solid moderate body that is very smooth. Only a slight carbonation comes through, just barely breaking that feel up. I do enjoy this brew. The aroma seems to be a little skewed towards characteristics that don't come through in the flavor and are not necessarily what I would consider to be dominant in an oatmeal stout. This is one that I would certainly visit again come winter if I could find it.","kmpitz2","Aug 18, 2007"

Starts off with a tiny bit of sweetness from the oats but is then dominated by the roasted barley. In the aftertaste you can sense a little bit of caramel malt but not enough to make it enjoyable.

3.57,-4.8,3.5,4,3.5,4,3,"Pours out to a deep coffee black color with nearly no head. Very low carbonation. Aromas of thick coffee and dark chocolate. Taste is full bodied and dense; flavors of roasted malts, cocoa, coffee, some dark fruits and hop bitterness on the finish. Powerful flavors. Mouthfeel is good, thick and heavy like a oatmeal stout should be. Drinkability is average. I feel like there is a brick in my stomach... Worth a try.","Frozensoul327","Dec 09, 2005"
3.83,2.1,4.5,4,4,4,3,"Inky brown. Beautiful aromas of patent leather, machine grease and roasted, sweet seeds. Faint lemon zest scents intermix with a wallop of blue fruits and espresso. Fleshy, fatty nuts bob merrily through the black broth. Burnt grape bubblegum. Surprisingly juicy, with blood orange flavors rising on the finish, though they never offer serious competition for the mass of roasted cocoa and coffee essences.","putnam","Dec 08, 2005"
3.94,5.1,5,3.5,4,4,4,"from the bottle. the last of the 3 stouts that I bought and this one did not disappoint me. poured black with a brown head with some lacing. flavor sweet, malts, chocolate, coffee. flavor the chocolate and malts where right on for me got some dark fruits and berries. very good.","walleye","Nov 11, 2005"
4,6.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours opaque black with a minimum khaki colored head. Smells of raw oatmeal and roasted grain. Taste starts off a little acrid before the oatmeal smoothes things out. Roasted grain matches smooth oatmeal in a filling manner. Smooth malt finishes the falvor with a hint of alcohol. A decent oatmeal stout.","BeerFink","May 13, 2005"
3.85,2.7,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"The dark appearance, the scent of the oatmeal, chicory, and boozy. Bit of metallic and sourness, not all that smooth, as bitter cocoa powder grains, however quaffable. Cream, malt, coffee, good not outstanding.Thanks for fulfilling my requests Wohlfs","Sammy","Apr 16, 2005"
3.75,0,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" dark brown head over the opaque black brew. Head quickly fades to an uneven layer of bubbles, and lacing is minimal. Aroma is dark roasty sweet oats, and that's about it. Taste is sweet burnt oatmeal, with a slight tang in the middle, and closes reasonably dry on the tongue. Mouthfeel is smooth due to the heavy oat use, and drinkability is is down a bit due to a preponderence of the dark malt giving it a slight bitter bent that seems out of place.","ppoitras","Mar 26, 2005"
3.7,-1.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"This is a really good (dry) stout, but not exactly what one would expect an oatmeal stout to taste like. Tastes more like Bell's Kalamazoo than it does Samuel Smith's Oatmeal.","ypsifly","Feb 15, 2005"

2.89,-22.9,4,2.5,3,3.5,2.5,"Not much of an Oatmeal Stout and a bit hard to finish. A bit too robust and not as subdued or clean as one might expect. Definitely a bit oxidized, and the linger is not very appealing.","Todd","Jun 19, 2004"
3.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Thank you to trbeer for the bottle. This is an odd oatmeal stout...sweetness seems a bit out of place. It's enjoyable though, and I might well have one again.","beergeek279","Jun 10, 2004"
4.16,10.9,5,4,4,4,4.5,"The beer as its ejects from the 12 ounce brown bottle pours a pitch-black, the head portly in size, the texture spumous, and the lace a fine curtain to conceal the glass. Nose is that of toasted grain, sweet chocolate, fresh and pleasant to the senses, start is sweet, nice malt profile, the top middling in feel. Finish has a spirited acidity, the hops delightful, dry and lingering aftertaste, drinkable stout tis true.","Gusler","Apr 30, 2004"
4.4,17.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Not quite up there with Kalamazoo in sheer drinkability, but a very good ""monster-of-a-stout"" worth searching for. This is one heck of a beast but is easy to drink and oh-so-smooth. Highly recommended. A meal in itself.","Mitchster","Nov 21, 2003"
3.66,-2.4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This one poured darker than a black hole. No light passing through it. Head was small tan colored. Aroma was of a strong oat presence along with some lactic characteristic. Taste was definite oat. Lots of oats partially roasted. Not too sweet though. More of a bitter stout. The oats could've used more companions.","granger10","Oct 11, 2003"
4.08,8.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Blacker than last weekend here in Detroit during the big blackout. Dark tan head is sponge-like in appearance. Fairly strong chocolate and caramel aromas that sloppily cover a hint of roasted sweets, s'more like. A great sweet start. Pretty bitter finish for an oatmeal stout. The texture is milky, creamy, satin. These guys have stouts nailed.","marburg","Aug 18, 2003"
