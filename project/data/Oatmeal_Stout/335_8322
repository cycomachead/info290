The head turns richer and creamier as it begins to settle a bit...  The color is not black, but rather a deep rich mahogany brown that allows some light to leak in around the edges...  Mostly still with just a stray carbonation streak here and there...  Sheets of lacing cling to the sides of the glass...  The nose is spot on for the style...  Roasted malt...  Coffee...  Milk chocolate...  The three aromas ebb and flow in prominence, but never completely disappear...  The palate is exactly as expected...  Brownie batter...  Roasted malts...  Baker's chocolate...  Simple, straight forward and uber effective...  Sturdy and medium bodied...  Lightly carbonated...  A bit chewy...  Lush and sleek...  Goes down easily sip after sip...  This is a rock solid teetering on world class Oatmeal Stout...  Tons of character and depth for a modest 5.2% ABV...","philbe311","Feb 15, 2015"

It's aroma is roasty, with an inkling of sweetness... very inviting indeed. The restaurant I tasted this at had it incorrectly labeled as a standard stout, and for a moment I thought to myself... 'This is the most soft, bready, and grainy stout that has ever traversed my palate.' The fact that it is an Oatmeal stout makes a lot more sense, as I am typing this review from my notes and looking upon the stats. It's quite the fine example of said style, and surprisingly full flavored for only 5.2% ABV. Some bittersweet baker's chocolate was a delightful nuance within the flavor as well. The mouth feel is somewhat syrupy, but overall would be best described as extraordinarily creamy. The Poet, you and I shall certainly meet again.","Neorebel","Nov 02, 2014"

Most everything you'll see in your average Stout's aroma is here. The taste is sweet oats. Remarkably silky. Subtle roasted chocolate and coffee, as well as nuts. A good amount of bitterness. Smoked wood. Due to the low ABV this one goes down silky smooth.  Medium bodied. Strongly recommend this one. Easy to drink and not hard to knock three of these back.","majorbase2","Nov 01, 2014"

I smell bitterness and some alcohol notes. I can definitely smell the oatmeal as well. So far, not my favorite aspect of this beer, but still very nice. Taste/mouthfeel: Bitter, but combined with the oatmeal flavor the taste is quite pleasant. Very creamy with oats and malt; wonderfully easy to drink. Smooth and enjoyable, but not monumental flavors. From initial taste to aftertaste, it is quite subtle and does not call attention to itself. From someone who loves milk stouts, this is an excellent beer.","sheeley","Aug 05, 2014"

4.03,2.8,4,3.5,4.25,4,4.25,"This is my favorite oatmeal stout. Has a beautiful dark mahogany look to it and pours with a a nice two inch tan/cream head. Extremely smooth for a dark beer and very full flavored. Nice roasted malt flavor. The smell isn't as impressive as the taste of the beer but hey taste is what matters in my book. I've had many oatmeal stouts as it's my favorite style of beer and this is by far my favorite. Just got lucky the liquor store got a fresh batch in this week. The downside is if you find it and, since it's not dated, you get an out of date bottle you will loose that nice head and it will have kind of a flat taste. Make sure you buy this from someone whos beer move. :)","MIchelle","Apr 09, 2014"

The nose is dominated by roasted coffee beans and milk chocolate. The mouthfeel is superbly creamy and smooth, it just begs for another sip. The flavor surpasses the aroma with a gentle sweetness that balances the bitterness of the roasted coffee notes. There is also vanilla, chocolate, and s little English toffee present. It really is a delicious and easily drinkable lighter stout. This is definitely one of the better offerings that I've had from New Holland. Good work!","lochef81","Mar 17, 2014"

Nothing really stood too far out, but rather all the notes, characters, and nuances blended together for an easily appreciated final product. While each sip gave decent froth and cream, this, coupled with the chalky dryness left around the mouth, proved to show a lacking of that soft, silky mouthfeel that you might have come to expect from the style. This slowed drinkability a bit, but the general ease and inclusiveness of flavoring helped to push through it. In the end, although the beer may not live entirely up to the ominous tone set by its name and label, it keeps the drinker interested long enough to enjoy it to the last sip.","TheBrewo","Aug 09, 2013"

The aroma is potent, a trait that carries over to a flavorful oatmeal stout with heavy caramel sweetness and dark fruits in each sip. The body of this beer is a solid medium with a modest sweetness from start to finish. I would have preferred more body. Each sip is quenching considering the beer is borderline cloying, but I don't think it qualifies as having a dry finish. That doesn't make much sense to anyone except me. There is very little bitterness in each sip except for a very slight residual bitterness following a large gulp. This is a drinkable, near-session stout with lots of unexpected flavor.","ThePorterSorter","Dec 29, 2012"

The head was a solid two fingers high and a deep tan color. The head also had good representation of lacing. A bold malt aroma with a hint of tobacco made my taste buds anxiously awaiting the first draw from the glass. The tast was that of a bold oatmeal stout. A very smooth full flavored beer that made me want to drink some more. This beer goes down smooth and has a pleasant after taste. The label is a nice touch paying homage to a great story. This is a great beer to pair with great friends and a great steak. I would highly recommend this beer and I look forward to buying more.","PADIV","Nov 25, 2012"

Wish it had a stronger oatmeal taste, but it has a good stout quality and a nice dark fruit finish. Feel is outstanding. Nice silky and creamy, full feel that wakes up the tongue with adequate carbonation. Overall- A very interesting take on the stout, with a hint of oatmeal and nice chocolate quality. Wish it was more complex in it's oatmeal. Comes off as more of a milk stout, but still decent. A pleasant surprise that is easy to drink.

About the same in the taste, big on the roast, dark malts, grains, a bit nutty, and a touch of sweetness with a counteracting touch of bitterness in the finish.

The nose is a pleasant blend of roasted malts together with prominent sweetness, but not overly so, and a hint of the oatmeal. The flavor also starts with the roasted malt immediately on the tongue. As the beer develops a biscuity malt base becomes more prevelant with a mild bitter and earthy mild hop character, chocolate hints, and again a malty sweetness. The oatmeal provides a nice full body. Medium carbonated. Overall, this is a good beer! A treat to have sampled, wish I had more.","hopfacebrew","Apr 03, 2012"

3.88,-1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled 08/25/2011. Pours crystal clear almost opaque dark brown color with a nice 2-3 finger dense tan head with great retention that reduces to a nice cap that lasts the whole glass. Some spotty lacing on the glass as well. Aromas of caramel, chocolate, molasses, roasted malt, oats, nuttiness, light coffee, and a bit of spicy hops. Nice and well balanced aromas here with decent strength. Taste of chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, light coffee, oats, and spicy hops. Good amount of spicy hop bitterness on the finish. A bit on the dry side; but there are some lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, light coffee, and spices on the finish for a bit. Medium body and carbonation; with a fairly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel that drinks extremely easily. Nice balance of flavors and bitterness; with a fairly robust flavor profile. Pretty much zero alcohol presence noticed. Overall this is a damn nice and straight forward oatmeal stout. Nice robust flavors, balance, and easy drinking make this a session beer I would get again.","superspak","Jan 04, 2012"

The nose was pretty subtle to me, I smelled a lot of coffee, oats, and subtle hints of booze. For taste, I got a lot of caramel and spices and a soft rye on the very back end/aftertaste. It's somewhere between medium and heavy bodied and left me with a bit of a syurpy mouth.

4.08,4.1,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"This pours dark, dark brown, light just penetrating at the edges, with a two finger maple head that leaves great lace. On the nose the oats are very apparent, but underneath them is some coffee and a hint of chocolate. The chocolate comes out a good deal more when agitated, sort of a dry or bitter chocolate rather than sweet. Underneath all of that is just a hint of dirty hops. In the mouth the oats and roasted malt form a base that the bitter chocolate and the small hint of bitter hops that mixes really well in a just slightly bitter, long finish. The feel is medium at best, really easy going down, not coating the mouth at all. Overall this is one of my favorite regular stout, a testament to the idea that lower alcohol brews can pack all kinds of flavor. Highly recommended.","EricCioe","Mar 30, 2011"

3.8,-3.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a rich midnight black with a busy, off-white head. Mild smooth lacing. Smell is mild but nice, seeming like chocolate and oats with some cinnamon, dark fruit notes and a mild, grassy pungency in the background. Roasted notes. A mellow marshmallowy sweetness starts off the taste, after which a pleasant, silky mouthfeel takes over, coasting unobjectionably - almost soothingly - across the palate for an easy if vaguely syrupy finish, with a drying effect, despite relatively low bitterness. In fact it reminds me a little of an Irish Dry overall. The mouthfeel of this one is nice, but all in all it's closer to a Breckenridge or Barney Flats than a Samuel Smith, say - meaning, that while very drinkable, it's sort of thin bodied and not super memorable. But you could do worse; it's enjoyable, and like a lot of oatmeal stouts, probably a good pick for someone who is curious about stouts but not ready for the harder hitting stout styles.

Complex nose is roasted barley, charcoal, table cream, dark fruit, baker's chocolate, very mild coffee note, oak wood, leather, and a touch of whisky. Kinda resembles a toned down, barrel aged RIS, which really surprised me. Flavour is chocolate and roasted malts, slight char, coffee grounds, clean rum-like fruitiness, dry oaty finish with some hop bitterness to end. Mouthfeel is slick and chocolaty upfront, medium carbonation, creamy-foamy middle, parched and toasty flaked oat aftertaste. A nicely layered contemplative stout with solid drinkability.

The nose comprises chocolate syrup, roasted malts, molasses, sharp coffee, and chocolate-covered black cherries (I can't seem to separate the two here). The taste holds notes of dark fruits, dark wheat, and very bitter cocoa powder. The latter pair dominates, and a vague but strong sense of chalk underlies everything. Something here doesn't compute, especially when the smell is accounted for. The body is surprisingly light, with a lightly moderate carbonation and watery feel. Overall, I'm marking this down as a fairly large disappointment, given the good things I've heard. Something just seems very bland in the taste, and the beer as a whole seems too watery and thin.

There is a sweet smell of caramel with a little bit of alcohol nipping at the back end. This has a nice smokey flavor and a fully, creamy body. There's no alcohol taste here and it reminds me more of a porter than a stout. Huge drinkability here, might be a nice winter session beer. Great beer.","billyzoom666","Feb 14, 2010"

I would compare this to a light beer, only in stout form. Much like actual light beers you could probably drink a few of these without feeling overwhelmed.

Finishes dry thanks to some roasted malts which also balance the beer and there are hints of some fruit flavors and hop bitterness on the backend. A quality oatmeal stout that is a definite must-try if you even only like this style a little bit.","clayrock81","Mar 23, 2009"

The taste is not what I expected, it does have your typical smokey robust notes with dark malt backgrounds like in most stouts along with a good amount of oatmeal, BUT unlike a lot of stouts in this category it is very smooth and easy to drink.

4.55,16.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"A very nice stout. Beautiful, dark chocolate color with a dark tan head that sticks around until the last sip is gone. Lacing is also quite nice. The nose gives you what you would expect - roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, some almond, hints of toffee - but there is also a nice hop aroma that lingers beneath the malt aromas. And on the taste, the pattern remains. The malts come at you first, but then the hops come in and keep the beer in (I would say) an almost perfect balance. Indeed I would say that this might be the finest aspect of this brew - that it is extremely well balanced. This also makes it very drinkable. On the flip side of that coin, if you are looking for a little more body and depth in your stouts, you may find this one not quite satiating. It is a touch light. But for an everyday winter drinker, The Poet does not let you down. Another fine brew from New Holland!","sudsface69","Dec 05, 2008"

Typical stout smells, chocolate, coffee, nuts, nothing wrong with those smells. A little sweet on the taste, but a sweetness that didn't linger so long that it made it sickening. Whereas some stouts are like a chocolate torte, thick and gummy, I'd describe this one as being closer to a chocolate mousse, a little bit airy. For such a dark stout, pretty darn drinkable.

Taste is a fuller version of the aroma but with an added hop kick. Roasted flavors dominate to be sure. Rich, almost smokey malts mix together perfectly with the creaimer aspects of this beer. Hop character adds a nice bit of fruitness to an otherwise dry beer. Feels on the fuller side of medium bodied and very chewy, leaves a nice drying sensation on the tongue and roof of the mouth.

Oatmeal comes across in mouthfeel, which is md-light. Fine carbonation stings strong on the papillae, but the beer is not overcarbonated.

Its very creamy and full bodied in the mouth. There is no hint of alcohol in the taste nor is there any alcohol warmth which is impressive for this abv. This is a dangerously drinkable beer.

It is very easy to produce a decent size head which does dissipate to more of a brownish film after a few minutes. The beer is sweet and very appetizing through most of the sip with very strong roasted to burnt malt flavors coming through in the finish. I think this is probably good because it is easily one of the most drinkable beers I have ever had. If it was inviting from start to finish I would have a very serious problem on my hands.","StonedRugger","May 27, 2008"

The oats are a major player in this one, serving up a soft but grainy character. Fruity hops add a note of ripe orange. Nice roasty coffee bitterness on the finish.

Excellent if you really prefer the oatmeal flavor in an oatmeal stout (which I do). Goes down smooth, but a little bitter in the aftertaste.","JamesS","Oct 13, 2007"

Smell was of butterscotch, flaked oats, licorice and spice. Almost like an oatmeal cookie, but with some maple syrup. Taste was a bit bitter up front. Short notes of butterscotch, maple, oats, with maybe just a touch of chocolate. Flavors complimented eachother nicely. Mouthfeel was a bit on the thin side, but thickened a bit as the beer warmed.

The aroma is bold and upfront. Chocolate, caramel, and coffee are all fighting for your attention in the nose. Very appealing. This beer is a real treat on the pallet. Well balanced and very tasty. Roasted, chocolate, and crystal malts take the stage, as the oatmeal backs them up quite nicely. I love the sour-sweetness that oatmeal brings to a beer.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a silky texture. The carbonation is perfect, with small fine bubbles. Overall, this is a very good oatmeal stout.

Hop bite is noticable about midway down. Ends with a nice espresso/coffee flavor that stays on the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a mild carbonation.

Roast flavor develops as it moves back through the mouth, finishing with a taste that's almost too bitter.

Scorchy chocolate, crystal and black patent malt aromas including some maple toffee and chicory notes. Lightly sweet upfront, and then the roasted character makes its way through. Oatmeal is more evident nearer the finish as some residual sweetness returns. Very tasty. Medium-bodied, yet creamy, without weighing the drinker down.

There are subtle notes of chocolate and coffee maybe even caramel or toffee, its like a really aromatic sweet smelling piece of bark, great stuff. Taste is very pleasing lots of subtle complexity, grain and malt flavors all over, with very light bitterness, but enough to keep it interesting. Alcohol is just at the right level to let this be a nice drinking beer. The bottle suggests pearing with earthy food like mushrooms and beef. Personally I think the mushrooms sound far more interesting to eat this with.

Flavor lacks some omph, bitterness like weak instant coffee. Finishes with a twang and a slight raggedy sense as the mouthfeel decomposes a bit. Actually, a good bit of a chocolate overtone at the end and lingering into the aftertaste. Pretty serviceable example of the style, but not among the more elite that I have tried.

Extra dry aftertaste, bitter coffee dry hop-bitterness and roasted malt balance the flavor very well. Low carbonation and med-full body allow a very creamy and smooth mouthfeel, packed with sweet and burnt flavor.

Nice chocolatey aroma is first to the nostrils, followed by a heavier scent of molasses and roasty black coffee. Some subtle citric hop notes are also in the nose, always a pleasant touch. True to the nose, the flavor is big on chocolate and coffee flavors. Definitely an abundance of chocolate malt in this one - lots of roasted character here. There is a lingering toffee-like sweetness under it all, and some hops in the finish. The hops have a little orange peel bite to them, which is a nice foil to the big roasted coffee flavors. Some oatmeal comes into play in the end to even out with the hops and dry roasted flavors. Nice touch. The mouthfeel is about right for the style, but the moderate carbonation lessens it a little.

Aromas were a bit on the light side, but traces of coffee and cocoa were present, with hints of earth and wood. Very nice, but way too light. Taste was a five. Amazing. Flavors of cofffee beans, roasted malts, medium pepper, rich wood, thick caramel and hidden hop bitterness make the taste astounding. Quite possibly the best stout I think I have ever had.

4.11,4.8,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"12oz. bottle poured into a thistle glass. It pours a deep black color with three fingers of dark tan head. There is a good amount of lacing. The smell is a little faint, but has some roasted malt and chocolate aromas. The taste is malty and sweet, it has lots of cocoa powder and molasses flavors that just meld together. There's a little bit of honey on the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and smooth, and the drinkability is good as well. A darn nice stout!","SheepNutz","Oct 18, 2004"
3.63,-7.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,3,"Pours a very dark color with a tall off-white head that sticks around and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is very pleasing - chocolate and lots of coffee with some dark malts. The flavor is very much like the aroma - very strong coffee and roasted flavor with hints of chocolate. Very well-made stout, but I would have prefered a stronger chocolate character.","clvand0","Oct 03, 2004"
4.05,3.3,4,4,4,4.5,4,"The beer pours a deep black color, with a finger of head that falls to just cover the beer. The nose is a nice balanced mocha, full or roasted goodness. The flavor is nice...its mostly coffee, but its not bitter. Its nice and roasty and full. The mouthfeel is full and thick, just what a stout should be. Drinkability is good. I could make this a session stout in the winter months.","kmpitz2","Oct 01, 2004"
3.83,-2.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"A very dark body is surmounted by volumes of tan head. The nose is lighter than expected but gives faint scents of coffee and chocolate. The feel is a tad thin to my taste, but a bit creamy nonetheless. There are flavors of coffee and chocolate to be enjoyed here and this brew is easily drinkable even in the summer.","AtLagerHeads","Sep 21, 2004"
3.98,1.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured (carefully) into an imperial pint glass, and we still got a full inch of tan head over a barely translucent mahogany brew. Lacing is good, and of the heavy foam variety. Aroma is full of deep dark malts, coffee and chocolate stand out. Taste is also of the coffee and chocolate malts, in reasonably good balance. Mouthfeel smooth, with some coffee bitterness, as expected. Drinkability is good, and overall this is a pleasant stout. A nice ender to a long day.","ppoitras","Aug 18, 2004"
3.75,-4.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"The flavor was sweer with a bit of malt. The biggest flavor that I could pick out was a milk chocolate or a truffle flavor. Very good beer.","BrewMaster","Aug 11, 2004"
3.68,-6.1,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer is an opaque dark brown (almost black) color with a medium beige head that dissipates slowly. Thin curtain of lacing throughout the glass. The aroma is very roasty, with coffee and dark chocolate. Medium-bodied and closer in consistency to a Porter than a Stout. Roasted coffee at the forefront, with molasses, chocolate and some hops in the flavor. The finish is mildly bitter and roasty. Overall this is a pretty good Stout, but it is lacking richness.","Dogbrick","Jul 20, 2004"
4.35,11,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The Poet is yet another wonderful beer from New Holland and, along with Snake River Zonker Stout, is my favorite 'just plain ol' stout' to date.

3.8,-3.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Dark brown with a tan head that has a yellowish tint. The head soon fades completely. Cocoa powder and coffe are the major aspects of the aroma. Along with the powdery chocolate and coffee in the flavor, theres a bit of nuttiness mixed in. Its kind of like a liquid candybar except for the whole sickeningly sweet part.","aracauna","Jun 27, 2004"
3.98,1.5,3.5,3,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours dark brownish black nice smooth light tan head that laces well. Smells overwhelmingly of coffee and chocolate. Nice roasted malty nose as well. Tastes of roasted malt and coffee with a chocolate finish that smooths very well. Very creamy feel to it. Kinda light for a stout, but not at all lacking in flavor. Very smooth drinking stout, one of the first from New Holland that I've been impressed with so far. Very well done.","abents","Jun 11, 2004"
4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"Appearance: Deep dark roasts form a black body with ruby highlights nice even intricate and even lacing. Aroma: Frivilous chocolate and coffee like deep roasted malts along with fruity over-ripened undertones. Taste: Coffee, chocolate, and with the touch of fruits thrown in very soft and nice on the palate definitely a session stout all the way nice beer very happy with this New Holland offering. Mouthfeel: Full bodied chalk full of flavor great stuff even carbonation brings out a silky smoothness. Drinkability: Amazing creamy texture along with impeccable balance can't go wrong with this gem.","WVbeergeek","May 24, 2004"
3.65,-6.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured black and no light is getting through this one. It formed a small medium tan foam head that left trace lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt, chocolate and coffee is present. A flavor of malt, coffee and a touch of chocolate. The body is fairly thin for this style and the finish is a bit bitter. Not a bad stout, but Bell's versions still beat New Holland's stouts/porters easy.","Wildman","May 23, 2004"
3.37,-14,3,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Mouthfeel is thin and watered down. Carbonation level is all this beer has going for it, but even that's not enough to pull it out of the hole.

3.18,-18.9,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Pours near black in color with auburn highlights. Thick foamy tan head. Light aroma of chocolate malt, sweet cocoa and molasses. Medium-bodied, smooth mouthfeel. Choclate malt flavor dominates the front. Hops quickly add balance to the sweetness and a dryness to that lingers into the finish. Almost sucks the sweetness right off your tongue. Slight alcohol taste can also be detected toward the back. Unfortunately, my third beer from this brewery wasn't quite the "charm" I was expecting.","Winter","Apr 01, 2004"

4.1,4.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"My first New Holland offering, many thanks to CRJMellor, for the Michigan sample. The Poet is just as the name would suggest, smooth and flowing. The beer pours very dark in the glass with a nice soft pillow-like tan head. The aroma of roasted malt and cocoa greet you. Lace is left in puffy rings of tan on the glass. The taste is a rich, roasted chocolate malt as if sprinkled with a hint of pepper. The mouthfeel is good, not over-dry, but a semi-sweet finish is left. I agree with other reviews, a delicious stout. I'll look for thisone when I can, to bad its only a seasonal.","chilidog","Mar 21, 2004"
4.1,4.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"A highly solid, if not excellent offering from the good folks at New Holland on the west side of the state. This stout pours out to a dark black as a good stout should, with aromas of roasted malt. The taste is very good, with afforementioned roasted malt present. Its drinkability is where it shines. It is delicious and easy to drink and would be a easy stout to have more than one, or two, or three...","proc","Feb 29, 2004"

3.63,-7.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours midnight black with red highlights. Smallish dark tan head forms which is very sticky and stays on the side of the glass throghout. Aroma is dominated by by heavy coffee and a faint chocolate smell. Taste is a little bit lighter than aroma would indicate. Starts with powerful coffee flavor then hits a slightly bitter note, then finishes with a sweet toffee, chocolate taste. Mouthfeel is a little bit light for a stout but warms as it goes down although no alcohol flavor is present.","CRJMellor","Dec 18, 2003"

The flavor was of a chocolate and vanilla yogurt with some sliced nuts on top. The base of the flavor however was very roasted and the roasted flavor stays all the way until the finish. Leafy hops became more noticeable towards the end of the drink and at the finish. This beer's a little thin in body and the flavors aren't the strongest on the tastebuds but all in all this is a very good beer.","granger10","Jul 14, 2003"
