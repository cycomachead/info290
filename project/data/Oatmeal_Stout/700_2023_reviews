"Overall: This is a pretty good oatmeal stout, but it does have its flaws. I thought the nose was great, but the taste doesnt quite live up to it. Mostly a subtle chocolatey, hop bite. I also feel that the finish is a bit too bitter for this style. Its still solid and worth the $6 i paid for the bomber, but probably won't go for it again"
""
"I`ve been looking at this one for a while on the shelf and I`m glad I finally pulled the trigger, solid brew that`s well worth a try"
"Decent low-key stout. The bone dry finish almost recalls a dark lager, although there is some complexity in the ashy/dry versus sweet contrast."
"O: [3.50] This beer is very unremarkable.  I had been saving it for a while - expecting it to be a really nice one.  I wouldn't seek this out.  There are way better stouts - even at lower ABV."

"On tap. Pours very dark with a thing,brown head. Aroma is of medium intensity. Roast and mild char. Not very sweet smelling. The flavor is a match to the beer's scent. Low in sweetness. Roast, bittering dark malt, and chocolate. Finished with another layer of hop/bitter. A Stout that leans away from sweetness according to my palate. Body is fairly full. Higher carbonation. Could stand for some more sweet balance."
"3.86/5: So dry yet so delicious"
"One of my favorites. Get it a lot in Longview at http://www.PorkysPublicHouse.com/."

"Super smooth, best stout I've had"
""
"Very dark, thick as a stout should be. Not a lot of taste."
""
""
""
"This looks black as night.  Kind of weak on the smell.  A robust burnt, toasted, roasty flavor is the first thing I noticed.  Next comes that oatmeal sweetness I'd hoped for followed up by a coffee aftertaste.  Thick, but not Russian thick.  Overall, this is freakin' great!"

"Overall, in my opinion, I'd say this is a wonderful oatmeal stout when I sit back and look at its qualities. It works straight up by Elysian."

"O: This one had loads of bitterness. It was completely unbalanced. The flowery hops really did not go well in a stout. This seemed more like it was trying to be a thick CDA than an oatmeal stout. It was poorly executed. This was a drain pour with no guilt."

"O - I thought this was great, the mouthfeel in particular."

"O: Complex, tastes very toasted. I like that the oatmeal comes distinctly through which it doesn't often for the style"

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Darn. Good beer, but a bit too tame for my taste to call it great. I don't know, maybe the Rogue Shakespeare has spoiled my taste and expectations for all other big oatmeal stouts. In any event, glad I got to try it."
""
"Overall, I'm happy with this outstanding beer from the Left Coast. I like the dark stuff and while it is bitter, it's fairliy smooth."
""
"Light conversation with friends, or simply relaxing, this beer is best with a meal."
""
"pretty incredible stout, so smooth creamy, sweet, chocolatey. really drinkable and pretty nice at 7.5 abv nearing imperial range, definitely has big bold flavors and thick imperial stout feel with creaminess and sweetness of oatmeal stouts. very nice"
""
"Overall, one of the better oatmeal stouts I've had. Luscious and rich, but not overpowering and hard to drink. A great blend of sweet and bitter helps maximize drinkability. If Elysian were easier to obtain in my neck of the woods, I'd likely buy this one with some regularity."
""
"Overall - An A+ imperial oatmeal stout by Elysian. Excellent roasted malts and bitter cocoa nib flavour that sets the bar in this beer category."
""
""
""
""
"This is alot better than samuel smith oatmeal stout, just what I think."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very easy drinker for an Imperial stout, a low abv makes this super easy to drink."
""
""
""
"O- Epically drinkable. Smooth and sweet. Not as strong as most stouts with this much flavor and feel. The oatmeal has to do with that, I'm sure. Really tasty and I could drink a couple bombers in a sitting and not feel full, or wiped out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice but sweet stout with a good ABV. Will definitely seek out again on a cold NY night."

"Beautiful looking beer. Chocolate brown with a massive three finger head that leaves full lacing around the glass. Nose is heavy on malt with notes of nuts and wood. Malt hits first, followed by chocolate, smoke and wood flavors. Lingers long and begs to be consumed slowly and appreciated. Stellar brew."

"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and char aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa and oat flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but gets much better as it warms up."
"A rock-steady oatmeal stout that'll never disappoint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"M&O: softly carbonated on the mouthfeel, the body remains medium against a rather rich but not heavy flavour profile; this “Imperial Oatmeal Stout”, to me, is a lovely twist of the older concept of rich and oily export stout that benefits from good craftsmanship and skilful manipulation of aromatic American hops. Absolutely lovely…!!"

"I completely agree with KangarooAdem59, he nailed it. Not time for it in Texas yet but here in Seattle it could not be a better night for a Stout. Light the fireplace pour into a fine beer glass and kickback and enjoy every taste of this fine beer. Tonight I decided to make sure to drink at least one Stout of the quality every week"""

"The roasted malts impart an acrid bitterness immediately out of the bottle, but this eases with each sip. The higher alcohol content is noticeable. There's chocolate later, with citrusy bitterness in the aftertaste. There's nohing extraordinary going on. This is a typical stout, wth medium carbonation and medium creamy body from the addition of the oats. For this abv, I prefer the taste of Ipswich much more, but this is definitely serviceable. A good example of the style, hence the generous rankings in taste and mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall quite impressed by this one. Price point was cheap so i didnt know what to expect but after having it ill definitely be having it again. This is a top of the line oatmeal stout."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"A thick, black stout...obsidian and as dard ans a coal mine. The head is a brownish tan, full and thick ,with serious staying power. A complex and boozy brew, the smell is a wild mix of alcohol, smoke, grain, oats, peach skins, hay, and charcoal. Interesting and intense. Full and medium sweet taste. If anything, it has a bit too much warming and high alcohol scent and feel.m it would be a great winter brew. Full in body. Substantial in all respects."
""
""
"This is a great example of a thick and powerful stout."
""
""
""
""
"Pour is black with burnt edges and a coffee colored tight head. Nose is light, charred malt, faint milk chocolate, and a hint of roasted coffee. Taste is a hint brighter, charred malt, light chocolate and coffee. Medium to light body with soft carbonation and a fairly dry finish."
""
""
""
""
"Is this a stout? Yes it is, and boy is it one. I can't think of any other way to put it. Poured it into a pint glass and was rewarded with a rich cola-colored head, a rich dark brown body, and the dark roasted malt characteristics of a stout. By itself, a wonderful drink, and just as well made for a good black-and-tan, if that's your taste."
""
""
""
""
""

"Sheryl just said she was impressed with the aftertaste, too. She’s not supposed to talk to me about these beers… BUT I will let it slide. (Note from Sheryl: What?? That was never a rule!) We only have one more beer to review from them, but I plan on ordering a flight when I’m done with that. They have a blood orange pale ale called Superfuzz, a double IPA called DIPROHOPUS, and a red called Men’s Room Red. I want to try them all! I’m only a few bottles in, and I’m impressed!"

"Overall a simple, straightforward, well-built stout."
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Medium to full bodied with very fine carbonation. Very creamy mouthfeel. Overall, a very roasty stout that doesn't have any other defining flavors. Very good mouthfeel though. Worth a try if you have the chance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Scored this via Let's Pour. Inky black with a densely packed and well-retaining dark tan head. Chocolate, molasses, and coffee all intrigue the nose. Big roasty malt complexity also includes some smoke and burnt toast. Black licorice, smoky, dark toast, and espresso all making their presence known all the palette. Bitterness is medium-high. Hop flavors seem secondary here though perhaps a bit earthy. Medium-full in body, slight creaminess is notable and pleasant. Carbonation seems appropriate for the style and is moderate/moderate-low. Overall this is a rich, roasty beer with deeply hued dark malt bill atop a luxurious lush silky body. Well done."
""
"This poured out as a thick black color with a thin tan head on top. The retention is thin, but the lacing is sticky. The smell of the beer is slightly hoppy, roasted and malty. The taste of the beer has a pretty strong bitterness, lots of dry chocolatey roasted malt. The mouthfeel is thick, nicely carbonated with a dry finish. Overall this is a pretty good brew."
""

"Overall- a very nice stout, one for the books. This thing is made to chew on for dessert."
""
""
"This is a solid oatmeal stout. Not the best I've ever had, but the oats are used quite well. Sadly not as memorable as some of the Elysian pumpkin beers."
"A stellar take on the oatmeal stout. Lots of malt character with a subtle hop influence. Crazy amounts of chocolate and roast. Worth seeking out and drinking when you're looking for a truly great example of the style."
""
""
"Overall this is certainly one well crafted oatmeal stout. Great balance and incredible mouthfeel. Keeps a rich taste without being overly packed with alcohol."
""
""
""
""
"The beer is near black with a thick beige collar. The aroma is perhaps a bit weak, but what's there is nice. Roast and chocolate with a healthy grain presence. Thick, robust body with warming alcohol in the finish. A nice beer to share at a tasting, or savor over the course of an evening."
""
"O - This is sort of like a hardcore spiked cup of joe- not for the faint of taste buds nor session-seekers. This stout demands your undivided attention, and the longer you enjoy it the more it will reward you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium to lighter bodied brew which was unexpected for the proclamation of this being an imperial oatmeal stout. It was modestly carbonated but overall not wowing and lacked the feel associated with the style. The price point on this is set low enough that you should try it but chances are you will feel the same and desire no need to revisit."
""
""
"Purchased at Safeway. Dark brown black in color, like oil. Tan head that doesn't last too long. Smells are bitter and coffee like. Taste is quite heavy. Coffee and just a hint of dark chocolate. Lightly sweet but very lightly. Strong warming presence. This beer is a meal. Took me over an hour to get through a 22oz bottle. Enjoyable but I think I'd only have this every once in a while."
""
"Thick full bodied with a bit of a chewy texture. mellow carbonation with a very dry finish."
"22 ounce bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense mocha head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, char, coffee, orange zest, pine, grapefruit, floral, oatmeal, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of dark roasted malt and hop notes. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, char, coffee, orange zest, pine, floral, grapefruit, oatmeal, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of piney citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, char, coffee, citrus zest, pine, floral, oats, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic robustness and complexity of roasted malt flavors with hops; with a great balance between malts and hop bitterness; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent export stout! Great balance and robustness of dark roast and hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

""

"O: Awesome stout. A nice sipping beer @ 7.5 % alcohol by volume"
""
"O: This beer hides its alcohol very well and is rather easy to drink. It's quite hopped compared to other beers in the style so this helps to cut through the malts and improve its drinkability."
"p.s. i did not truly observe colour and a few other non essential traits, so i this will factor into my rating score. ( colour being the main one, as i was drinking in poor light from a non translucent stein. peace out. )"
"O: A good brew, nice for the winter months, very tasty and pleasant."
""
""

"very hearty with flavor and bitterness that needs respect. Highly recommend for splitting or accompanied by food."
""
""
"O- nice oatmeal stout. Good amount of roast and chocolate along with very smooth finish."
""
"O: Excellent oatmeal stout. Extra oatmeal really brings that flavor to the forefront. Some hop bitterness adds some nice complexity. Overall I really enjoyed it. I just didn't give it amazing scores due to the relative simplicity of the brew. For an oatmeal stout it is one of the best."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a solid beer. This category is great for dessert or fireside chats in my opinion, not for refreshment of course. Or maybe with breakfast before a long snowshoe?"
"O: I'm really impressed with beer I wasn't expecting this much from a low alcohol content for an imperial oatmeal stout. There is a delicious smells, near perfect taste, good looks, and a solid well balanced mouthfeel. A really good beer I would definitely try again."
""
""
""
""
"Not bad. Liked it more than I might have anticipated. Would drink again. 3.5"
"O - A great oatmeal stout with a hop bitterness presence on the finish that makes for a unique and tasty experience. The ABV is very well hidden and offers up a touch of sweetness to complement the chocolate and cocoa notes."
""
"Overall this is an excellent example of the style that doesn't hold back. Will be enjoying this many more times over the winter months."
"O Weighing in with a 7.5 abv I can't tell. One of the creamiest, flavor balanced yet still rich, non imperial, oatmeal stouts I've enjoyed. Good job."
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid, solid, solid."
""
""
"Full bodied with a deeply roasted, robust dark malt flavor that's countered by lighter malt sweetness and faint earthy hop bitterness. Pretty dry and almost burnt tasting up front without becoming acrid or overwhelming. Hints of burnt toast, roasted gourmet coffee, dark chocolate and of course oatmeal followed by toffee, chocolate cake and resinous hops. Lots of dry bitterness yet this big beer remains well balanced and pretty easy to drink considering it's complexity."
""
""
"Overall an enjoyable stout."
""
""
""
"The flavor of this ale is rich and complex: sweet, tart, bitter, and savory in a much higher quantity than I usually experience in a beer. Savory is not a flavor I typically associate with beer of any type, even the dark ales and lagers, but this is a welcome exception."
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice oatmeal stout. The smoothness from the oatmeal is present and it goes down well. My wife, who doesn't drink beer, choose this off the shelf for me. I consider myself lucky."
""
"Quite enjoyable stout. Definitely agree with the bottle in that this is an ""Imperial Oatmeal Stout"". Bold, rich flavors, pleasant boozy notes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a very nice stout but its simple. the coffee presence would satisfy the coffee lover and those that like to have coffee as a note or in the background. A nice middle ground from a traditional stout and oatmeal stout."
"D - a better than average oatmeal stout. This beer has a sweet, thick body but also the complex, dark roast of an imperial stoutl. Really a hybrid between the two styles it is more drinkable an your average imperial and more complex than an oatmeal stout, which makes for an enjoyable experience overall."
""
""
"The beer pours a black color with a tan head. The aroma has a lot of roasted malt and chocolate malt. The flavor is a little more complex. I get quite a bit of heavily roasted malt and chocolate, as well as some oats and cream notes. There is also a hint of smoke. Thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
""
"Review from 4/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark, dark brown amber. Small medium tan head and lacing. Aroma of dark and toasted malt, dark fruit. Very nice, calm stout, slightly understated, but well balanced. Dark toasted malt and dark fruit flavors up front, smoky malt middle and a toasted malt and hop finish. Very well done. This has been one of my favorites for years and it's very inexpensive."
""
"O- Good, but not great, there are other impy oatmel stouts I will reach for before Dragonstooth."
""
"Surprisingly good beer from one of my least favorite breweries. From the 22 oz bottle bought at Mayfair Liquors, my second favorite store in Denver."
"finally picked this beer up. at frist i didnt like it but the more i drink the more i liked it pours blacks which i like. it smells like it would be too much alcohol in it but it doesnt and the taste , it taste better then it smells your thinking its gonna gag me and stick in the back of my thoart but it doesnt , its a beer to drink but notall the time but give it shot if havent tried it glad i did"
""
"O – A good oatmeal stout, I like the minimal sweetness with moderate bitterness, pretty complex and it goes down surprisingly easy for a bigger beer, a high 4"
""
""
""
""
"Really nice Foreign Stout/Imperial Oatmeal Stout. Really rich flavor, a lot of chocolate and supporting cast, creamy mouthfeel from the oats. I can dig it."
""
""
"O - A decent stout, nothing I'd go out of my way for... but good."
"C-"
"Viscous, smooth body delivers flavors directly to my palate. Finishes a touch sweet as malts meld with bittersweet chocolate. Love oatmeal stouts, and this is a good, straightforward example of the style."
""
"O: A nice hoppy twist on a stout. I just wish this hop fad would calm down a little bit and leave my stouts alone...almost a nice twist, but just a little too much."
""
""
"Overall, very good. Nothing revolutionary, just really solid, well done, and tasty."
"a good stout, nothing amazing. this beer pours a thick sludgy oil black color with a lively tan head a couple inches high, some retention. there are some yeast floaters in there as well. smells like coffee and licorice and booze. flavor is more malty, not burnt, but very very dark roasted. some mild sweetness in the flavor, plenty of coffee, and maybe even a touch of milk chocolate. feel is alright, low carbonation makes it feel heavier than it is, but it definitely full bodied. i didnt love this, and a bomber would be a lot, but i did use about half of it in a pot of buffalo chili, where i usually use porter and it imparted a ton of rich flavors which made this my best chili yet. for that application it was fantastic, for a drinking stout it wasnt my favorite."
"Overall - In many ways this beer drinks more like a lighter hopped black IPA. It’s dryness and bitterness are quite heavy. I was expecting something a bit more smooth in transition and flavor, but this it was not. It left some rather unpleasant flavors in the mouth at the end making this a beer I would likely not do again."
""
"Poured from bomber to pint glass the beer pours a deep dark brown, nearly black color. 1 finger head with good retention and lacing. The nose is roast dominated with tones of earhty floral hops and a hint of chocolate and licorice. The flavor is very much the same with an initial surge of roasted malt up front with an underlying mild bitterness. The licorice flavor is more pronounced than in the nose. I would prefer to tone it down a bit, but it's not bad. Chocolate really evens the beer out. Creamy and smooth, lingering roast flavor. Well carbonated. Overall, good. It would be better with by reeling back the licorice flavor, in my opinion. but still very enjoyable."
""
"Overall a great os. Would have more in the fridge or cellar if I could."
"O Very impressed with this brew. Would def seek out again."
"O - I love it!"
"O: Recommended. I liked it a lot, an Imperial Oatmeal, but not over the top, still approachable and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Full bodied feel, a bit slick, well carbonated and smooth. Leaves a lingering cocoa/coffee malt flavor in the finish. Overall, an incredibly tasty, well made stout. Well hopped which is always welcome."
""
""
""
"A dark brown with a nice, thumb and half width brown head. Okay lacing. A great sweat and roasty aroma of barley, oats, coffee, and chocolate. Flavor starts off quite roasty and sweet and finishes bitter and hoppy, more typical of a black ipa hoppy finish than the bitter coffee finish I love in my favorite oatmeal stouts. Roasted barley, oats, aniseed, and burnt tobacco. A creamy thin to medium mouthfeel, not much carbonation. I wouldn't have minded it being a touch thicker but I still enjoyed it. Wouldn't have minded if they toned down the aniseed just a touch and can't say the bitter finish was executed well as it has been done in some other oatmeal stouts. Still, a nice oatmel stout that I'd be happy to drink again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: From the appearance and smell, the beer promised a lot. I feel like while the burnt flavours round the beer off, they're a little too harsh and they left me feeling dry and unsatisfied."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers LampertLand"
"Overall I like it, but it has a few shortcomings to style for me. I like the strong oat presence though. I think I would have again though."
"Overall, it's enjoyable, quite good. However, the dry aspect doesn't seem to grab me. If ripping dry grain and char and roast is your deal, you will love this beer to death. Do enjoy, I could have another."
"O: An average oatmeal stout. Less thick than I'd like and a standard, slightly boring flavor profile."
""
"Overall definitely something I would not get again. Kind of hate hoppy stouts truthfully but this is only average at best."
"A very good stout. Has many of the deep, dark goodness I look for in this imperial style. Interesting interaction with the hop bitterness and the alcohol: they seem to complement each other nicely for a big beer. I would have liked a better, thicker head, but otherwise everything else comes together for this one."
""
""
"O - The tobacco is a huge put-off for me, so I'm not the biggest fan. Plus there is no sweetness to balance things out. Looks so good, but dies down after that."
""
""
"Easy to drink and definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"poured from a 22oz bottle into a DFH goblet. It pours a dark black with a tan head about a fingers thick that fades fastand leaves minimal lacing. Smells like a sweeter heavy roasted stout with a hint of chocolate. The taste is a thick bread like roasted malt and little bitterness from the hops but the creamy bitter chocolate has a nice compliment. For just under 8% this brew is very enjoyable and tame on the carbonation which is unique and in a bad way. I enjoyed this stout, and for then less that $4 a bottle I consider it a steal."
""
"Excellent, chocolately, caramely aroma. Medium level of carbonation, with head clinging to the sides. Head lingers long after pouring, with Brussels lace. Rich, dark brown pour, hard for light to penetrate. Flavors of coffee and caramel. Overall an excellent beer that I enjoyed."
""
"OA: SBA Brew (SBA= Super Bad Ass)"
""
""
""
""
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a solid stout to drink for a while."
""
"o - Overall I thought this was a really nice oatmeal stout; one of the better ones I've had in recent memory. Ton of roasted notes and chocolate, and very easy to drink. Very glad I bought this, and would buy it again."
""
"I purchased a bottle in 2010 and have been aging it in my cellar until tonight. Poured into a Brooklyn Brewery oversized snifter. Dark brown colored body. Thin white head, meaning some carbonation may have been lost over time. Spots of lacing here and there on the glass. Smell was faint; mostly coffee but just a slight hint of butter. Taste was enjoyable. Lots of layers of coffee, roasted grain, cocoa, and maybe some cereal. Mouthfeel was smooth but there was a slight bitterness at the end on the palate. The abv was toned down well, and not overly noticeable. The label calls itself an Imperial Oatmeal Stout, and the phrase applies well. It's much more potent in flavor than other regular oatmeal stouts that I have had in the past."
""
""
"Overall: Complex well balanced and easily drinkable. Nice roast malt and bitter hop balance."
""
"Overall. Great tasting oatmeal stout. Enjoyed it."
""
""
""

""

""
""
"Easily one of the best Oatmeal Stouts in resent memory. Excellent, down right near perfect example."
"Taste is sweet, creamy mellow and lots of chocolate, roast coffee and a nice light bitter finish, Mouthfeel is a bit watery but still good."
"A pleasant quietly unique example of the style."
"The last couple of imperial stouts I’ve had have all been fairly hoppy (rasputin, storm king, etc.), and this is no different. Personally, hops ain’t what I look for in a RIS, but this isn’t a bad beer."
"O: A very enjoyable stout with powerful flavours. The name fits it perfectly."
"The middling sourness of this offering may be a tad suggestive of a generic porter, but everything else screams out lovely, amped up oatmeal stout, well tempered all PNW-style, with a bit of a dialing down of the IBUs-from-hell that I'm starting to see as the trend 'round these parts. Enjoyable, and drinkable, at least until that alcohol starts to claim its pound or so of flesh."
"All around a great beer; a strong oatmeal stout and a finely balanced one at that. None of the flavors overwhelm, only enhance."
"Pours pitch black into my Kona Brew pint glass. Smells of oatmeal and alcohol. Tastes of oatmeal and chocolate which is a nice combination. I don't taste much alcohol. The oatmeal and the chocolate don't overwhelm you it's very subtle in after taste. This is my first offering from Elysian, I always see their beers everywhere and their label is catchy. I have been to Seattle twice and haven't been to their brewery but I will go next time I'm in town."
"O: A very good Oatmeal Stout. Great roasty/toasty notes. Not an overpowering coffee flavor. Definitely will purchase again."
"O - Liked this despite the heavy smokiness. very drinkable, enjoyable mouthfeel, B++ would drink again."
"O/D: I could put back a bomber of this no problem. A nice winter or bad-weather beer. I think it used to be higher ABV though."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being moderate for the style. Overall it was a very good beer. I usually don't a lot of hoppiness in my stouts, but this one managed to really integrate the flavors nicely. The juicy citrus really meshed with the smooth oats for me. The bitter-sweet chocolate and roasty, bitter, coffee flavors were an added bonus. Delicious beer overall."
"O: Easy to drink and robust. It's bit too roasty and untempered for me but is too easy to drink with its light, playful body."
"Appearance is a dark brown ale with a dark tan head leaving nice lace. Smell of rich roasted malts, coffee and some dark fruits in the back. Taste has lightly sweetened roasted malts, coffee, dark bitter chocolate with a nice balance of hops. Mouthfeel is full bodied and very creamy with just the right amount of carbonation. A very enjoyable full bodied Stout."
"O: Subtle and smooth, but still interesting. Easy drinking, but at the same time its definitely something that's better suited for slow leisurely drinking."
"The mouth starts out quite creamy, but doesn't finish well. Thins out considerably. For a big stout such as this, the mouth needs to hold its ground. This one does not. The thinness carries over to the flavor as well. Weak flavors of mild roast, alcohol, and chilled old coffee. Meh. This one was alright. Nothing that would cause me to seek this out again, maybe on tap if I ever saw it. But most likely pass on this one in the future."
"This is my second beer from Elysian and I'm still pretty happy. I'll have to seek out some more of there brews."
"I've discovered one of my favorite stouts."
"An American Imperial Stout with a very light chocolate aroma. A very clean taste with hints of bittersweet chocolate. A very small head with a beautiful dark color. A slight bitter aftertaste. A very good beer that went well with Sapsucker's Decadent Dog. Definitely a beer I would like to drink again."
"Drinkability is good for a stout of this caliber. It's clean and well-done, with a tempered alcohol content that'll eventually catch up with you, but for about $5 a bomber, you really can't beat value like this. Not a bad brew at all from Elysian."
"Pours very dark and black with a bit of light brown head that sticks to the corners of the glass. Decent lacing. Smells very roasty and malty. A strong scent that is really pleasant. Tastes very roasty. Almost no flavor on the front of the pallette. Bitter roast on the finish. Feels a bit thin. Not the same thick body that i would expect on an imperial stout but very drinkable"
"Less abv than the style usually calls for but is delicious none the less"
"Full body, decently carbonated, very smooth and pleasant on the palate. Surprisingly solid drinking, nice smoky flavor with tempered sweetness, and the ABV is masked well. This is the best one I've had from Elysian yet."
"Beer is medium in body and lead off with a nice sweetness that gives way shortly to a nice roastiness like coffee beans. There is some chocolate like bitterness in there as well. Beer is a little....hot....perhaps, but it's not very distracting, the heat gets mostly lost in the forward malt syrup sweetness. Beer is pretty easy drinking for as big as it is, decent big stout in my opinion. I'd have it again."
"Great feel and fine taste this is a great drinking Imperial Oatmeal Stout.Nice subtle yet clear flavors intertwine nicely. It never loses the clarity and no single flavor becomes dominant as is frequently the case. Excellent overall beer."
"Pours black with a single-finger tan head with moderate retention. This falls down to a collar around the edges. The nose is pretty sweet to start with a good amount of chocolate as well as some sweetness, coffee, and maybe a hint of black licorice. The taste is mostly chocolate-focused with some roasted malt in there as well. A bit of booze coming through in the end, and this takes over a bit in the feel, which consists of a somewhat-low carbonated brew with a pretty big body. Drinks well enough, but not a standout among the style."
"Good drinkability. Very tasty, the alcohol is low enough to warrant drinking multiples."
"I think its a pretty good Stout. Alcohol sneaks up at the end but you barely noticable in the beginning. It gives a warm sensation as it goes down, probably from the decent amount of alcohol, which 7.45%. You really can notice the aroma of yeast towards the bottom of the glass."
"Overall: I really liked this brew. It checks in on the low side of Imperial/Double Stouts, which gives you the best of both worlds: robust flavors, but a smoother, easy drinking body."
"This brew comes across almost like a milk stout -- on the sweet side and dominated by chocolate, but there's just enough espresso character to balance (the alcohol is hard to detect). Very flavorful and easy-drinking overall."
"D: The lack of alcohol hotness helps with the drinkability but I find it too sweet to have more than a heathly tasting pour."
"Overall great beer, true to the spirit of the style and packing a well hidden punch. This is a beer I will be returning to when I'm in the mood for a bigger stout with year round availability."
"D: I'm normally not one for stouts but this is really good...I would buy this one again for sure. One of the best Elysian beers I've had."
"As far as bitterness goes this doesn't have as much as most Imp Stouts, even when cold. There's the graininess that you get when roasted malts are used in abundance and the alcohol is very well-masked. That's partially because this does not have as high an ABV as most Imp Stouts...it sits at the bottom of the style for that. So you can drink even more of it right? Sure, give it a go. After it settles a bit the graininess is mitigated and the beer becomes really silky smooth. This is one nicely crafted stout."
"D: Yeah, try it! Drink it."
"Drinks like a nice creamy stout latte. Creamy and rich with toasted oatmeal flavors dominating and giving way to a light chocolate sweetness and a dry finish. I believe there may be periods where this goes down too easy but as an oatmeal stout it drinks well and an imperial pint was more than appealing for this type of beer. Would be a perfect beer breakfast because it is so rich and creamy (over using this word I know) but this is was both my appetizer and dessert at Elliot's."
"Caramel malt undertones, creaminess from oats, velvety, dark fruits, roasty dry finish that lingers with a moderate level of bitterness. Tongue drying but not moisture zapping, dark chocolate-like finish. Solid but nothing to write home about."
"When I rate a beer I like to use a pilsner glass to note the color, head, and lacing. The color ranged from dense black, the color of a hole, to dark mahogany when held up to light. Great tan head and lacing expected of a fine brew. The taste was sweet Sulawesi. It poured thick over my tongue as it slowly sought the lower elevations of my mouth. Drinkable...I'm not sure **wink wink** ...better have another!"
"I throughly enjoyed this beer, but I wasn't all that satisfied. It is a dark chcolate color with minimal light brown head. Tons of lacing though which makes me want to enjoy this beer. It smelled really malty, and my nose twinged when I got that strong chocolate aroma. Thanks again to Market of Choice for having this beer in stock."
"Elysian Brewing Company--ELYSIAN Dragonstooth Stout--2008 22 oz. Bottle. 7.45% ABV 36 IBU's. (3.5 / 5.0) Thick tight pellicle. Thin lace thin espresso head. Opaque dark black color. Smoky plum fig mild hop front. Sweet smooth chocolate roasted dark fruit creamy smooth rich Stout body. Mild hop spice EtOH hint clean dry chalky rich chocolate end. Aged mildly fruity. Sampled 8/8/2010. 4 @ $3.99 Each. 3 remaining to trade."
"D - A great all around beer, and one to go back to for sure. ABV is well hidden."
"Very smooth with terrific carbonation. This is another stout that doesn't push any envelopes with the style but it's still enjoyable because of the bitter hops. I was glad to try it but don't need to revisit in the future."
"Drinkability: quite drinkable, especially considering the ABV. I would definitely have this again."
"All in all, this is ok. Not phenomenal, but ok. Good to try once, but not worth hunting down."
"D- very drinkable, especially after a hard day on the mountain."
"Pretty good stout! Medium body, smooth/velvety and rich mouthfeel. Lots of semi-sweet chocolate, roasted barley, toasted oats, and slight booze. The warmer it gets, the thicker it feels in the mouth. I've never seen, nor heard of this beer before...and it was just a random pick-up today. I have to say, I'm pretty pleased, and not let down at all."
"Drinkability is also good. I enjoyed reminiscing of my trip with this souvenir. Great job Elysian!"
"D - This one definitely falls between the classic oatmeal stout and over-the-top imperials that are all the rage these days. A restrained, balanced effort that is worth seeking out."
"A very solid oatmeal stout, a lot of bold flavors that compliments the creamy mouthfeel beautifully. Probably my favorite from Elysian so far."
"This is quite a tasty brew."
"D: Beautiful. A bit lower on the ABV, and this would make a killer session beer. As it is now, I'd call it dessert!"
"I like it better than FBS!"
"- Overall this is a fantastic stout, and and quite pleased with it.. one I would certainly purchase again. Smooth, not too sweet, and tasty!"
"Mouth: Thicker than it looks, is the first impression. Healthy roast flavors and lingering burnt toast. Some of that burnt sugar again, an acrid finish. Fore flavors are better than hind flavors. Goes well w/ my burger though. Mouthfeel is thick yet highly carbonated... think the body could stand to be a little thinner (lower in alcohol) but it's quite alright."
"Drinkability- A big brick, one bomber is enough, maybe too much for a session."
"Drinkability overall is solid, I have no gripes with the beer or the flavor and I enjoyed my opportunity to try this PacNW offering from Seattle. I haven't had many brews from that region and I'm glad that this one came my way to further my horizons. Very enjoyable up there in the realm of Breakfast Stout, Wake and Bake, JavaHead, and other big beers within this vein."
"Drinkability: The 7.4% ABV makes this a very drinkable imperial stout, but the tartness of the taste and the mouthfeel make this a one-and-done for me. If the beer is allowed to warm, it becomes far more drinkable in both categories, but overall, this beer just leaves me feeling sort of ""meh."""
"The body was full and coating without being overly heavy. Drinkability was very good for such a big, full beer. Overall, a very good beer worth trying when you see it and perhaps some effort to obtain."
"This stout pours dark brown with a nice lasting tan head. Aromas are of roasted malt, chocolate, and some oatmeal. As this stout warms up - so do all the flavors. The hops are under control, so this treat went down way too damn smooth. I felt this was just a little on the light side for a beer of this magnitude, but hey, I am not complaining. It is so civilized. At a little more than 7% ABV, I feel I could drink this all day long. A truly unexpected surprise! ~"
"Definitely recommended."
"Out of a 22 ounce bomber bottle and into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The stout appears a dark brown color and nearly opaque, with about two fingers of creamy ecru colored foam. Nose and flavor are of rich roasted grains, bittersweet chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, sweet caramelized malt. Between medium and full in body and amply carbonated for the style. Certainly decent enough to have again another time."
"D - Good drinkability. Leaves you thirsty for more. I can't explain it, and my beer is just sitting here waiting to be drank."
"For me, this stout was way out of balance, not a beer I would pick up again."
"This is an excellent stout with a great combination of roasted malts and big sweetness. It's complexity and heft put it on the border of impy stout status. Very, very tasty."
"Very good stout, label art aside. It's a good stout with a rich, sweet chocolate, coffee roasted stout flavor. The beer pours dark and looks thick (and I mean that as a compliment). The aroma is jumping between a good chocolate milk shake with a dash of espresso and one of those cheap Italian espresso soda things. So, it's a mixed bag but ultimately good. The flavor is also fairly sweet, but it has some bite. There's more to it than I was expecting. The roasted malt flavor is rich and full, a beer that tastes bigger than its size. Feel is smooth with a mildly acrid finish. Drinkability is good, but it's a fairly light for the category."
"Overall - I have to say this was pretty darn tasty. Not quite up there with the big boys but definitely something I would not mind going towards again, I could see myself trying another one for sure."
"D. An overall good stout. Nothing over top, just an all around really good/balanced ale."
"This is a very nice beer and very easy to drink - recommended!"
"Drinkability= Abv. is not detected, flavor is good, finish is thin. Overall, I would say it's highly drinkable."
"Pours a deep black with a one inch cocoa colored head that slowly dissipates into thin head that stays. As you drink this it leaves thick lacing down the glass. The aroma is strong with roasted malts and bitter coffee with a touch of chocolate that adds a sweetness to the scents. This flavor of this beer is dominated with semi-sweet chocolate and has a bitterness that lasts. It has a heavy to medium body that coats your mouth with every sip. I really like this beer, its highly drinkable and extremely enjoyable."
"Drinkability is high, this is an awesome stout for sure. Wow, loving it. More impressive then I recall the oatmeal version, although it's been quite a while since I had that one. This one gets extra points for being a decent value and year round staple."
"This was a surprisingly good stout and it is relatively inexpensive (I believe around $4.69/bomber). I do not believe Elysian has distribution much further than the pacific northwest, so I recommend to give it a try if you can get it."
"Medium bodied, with a nice overall taste but lacking some complexity and power. Again, a good stout, but not so good as ""imperial""."
"D: It's too bad ramnuts is just gifting me these and I can't evaluate value here. Thanks again buddy. Anyway, I really like the flavor of this one, but all things considered, I'd probably pick something else as my go-to stout, unless this has an attractive price (below $5 or so)."
"Pours black with a fluffy and off color head. The aroma is sweet and slightly chalky. The flavor is sweet, milky, rich and dry. It is roasted and slightly chocolatey, with a hint of wood and coffee. Mouthfeel is thick and rich. Quite tasty and quite drinkable."
"This beer is one of those ultra black, oily stouts. The mouthfeel is probably the most extreme trait- this sorta rolls out on your tongue. The flavor itself is bold, malty, chocolatey. Very drinkable- not the strongest stout out there (read: you can easily drink one of these without feeling bombed) but by no means a pushover. This is a solid stout that deserves your attention and will reward you back! Grab this one when you see it and dig in!"
"Sample at the Pike Street location. Pours black with a medium dark beige head that dissipates steadily. Patchy lacing on the glass. The aroma contains chocolate, malt, anise and coffee. Rich and smooth body with flavors of chocolate and roasted coffee, plus some hops and spices. The finish is roasty with a chocolate and espresso flavor that lingers awhile. Very enjoyable from start to finish."
"D - This was an exceptional Stout by Elysian, everything was there, and I can wait to try more of their beers"
"Pours a straight black slightly viscous syrup. Their is a little, light Bosco syrup cling after ever swirl. Barely any head after the pour, and none after the first sip. Heavy mocha aroma, French roast coffee grounds and some faint milk mixed with bitter chocolate. Very roasty. The taste starts creamy and syrupy. The milk chocolate and espresso slowly strenghen towards the finish. Well integrated mix of flavors and faint alcohol in the mouthfeel's finish. Very glad I ordered this beer."
"This beer exceeded my expectations flavor-wise, but I have trouble seeing it as an imperial stout. It's more like a strong american stout, comparable to the Cadillac Mt. or Shakespeare stouts, I'd say."
"d - this is my desert tonight. with a little blue cheese."
"Pours a rich black color with a nice looking medium sized brown head. Lots of roasty toasty grain in the nose, sweet chocolate malt comes through as well as subtle notes of ground coffee. Good flavor, surprising bitterness which i really enjoyed. Medium bodied for an Imperial Stout but that factored with the moderate ABV make for a very drinkable brew. Well done, by far my favorite offering from Elysian so far."
"A highly enjoyable Imperial Oatemal Stout."
"D: sometimes I struggle with the idea of giving 5's for scores and this beer challenged me quite a bit. I have found, yet another, great stout since my move to the west coast. It does not get much better than this: rich, malty, complex, and smooth. Has to be a 5!"
"drinkability: good"
"Notes: I could see this becoming a go-to, middle of the road ""everyday"" stout if it were reasonably priced and more easily found. . . ."
"Sometimes a stout is just a stout, and when it's this tasty, just being a stout is a good thing. It's got all the right parts put together in a fetching way. It's bold but mannered. The ABV is north of average, but even with that, it drinks smooth and well. It's not double imperial, cave-aged in Amontillado casks with vanilla and premium espresso tossed in. No, instead, it's a good, gracious, enjoyable stout that I'll pour gladly any day."
"Dragonstooth (one word, apparently) is elegant in multiple capacities: the plush creaminess, forward leaning mocha mojo, and overall graceful contours. The beer also shows a dark tan head with exaggerated lace and a dark, placid body. Though its gentle malt aroma doesn't factor strongly, Dragonstooth's initial sweetness and approachable complexity make it easy to return to year in and year out."
"For a stout it's not that heavy, more medium bodied and quite enjoyable. Therefore, I think you could drink a little more becasue it doesn't fill you up so much"
"Medium-bodied appearance: dark but not black, head showed some froth at first but quickly dissipated. Smell & taste feature strong and richly varied malts, from toffee to biscuit to even a bit of chocolate. Superbly creamy and drinkable, yet pleasantly strong (7.5%). Can't wait to return to this one another night."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a rich, chocolatey scent with a dry, coffee-like earthiness as well. The taste is good. It has a smooth black and chocolate malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry with an earthy feel. It's only slightly warming in the finish. The chocolate malts really make the flavor with this one. The mouthfeel is awesome. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a trendous beer. It's rich with malt complexity and has a lovely mouthfeel."
"D: One of the most drinkable IRS I have ever had. Great beer with a small price tag. If avaliable would be one of my go to winter brews."
"Roasted oaty maltiness with a dash of coffee flavors to balance it all out. One of the easiest drinking stouts I've ever had, a guy could easily drink two or three 22 oz bottles and not realize it until the alcohol hit. Not that I'd know anything about that..."
"D: A very good tasting beer, but the mouthfeel seemed a little filling. While they did well to complement each other, the thick mouthfeel made it difficult to drink later on."
"6/4/7/4/14 (3.5/5)"
"A: Ebony espresso, thick brown, wonderful lacing - 4.25, S: Hints of oatmeal, heavy on the grain - 4.25, T: Extremely grainy in a good way, loads of chocolate malt, some nice bittering, on the mild side in terms of an Imperial Stout - 4.25, M: Nice and creamy - 4.50, D: This is a solid stout, nicely crafted and quite flavorful - 4.25"
"Drinkability: Really, really wish I had another bomber of this. Flavor and mouthfeel are superb. Goes down very smooth, and creates a nice, friendly, warm spot in your belly. A top notch imperial stout that I'd recommend to anyone!"
"This is a solid beer, easy to drink and enjoyable at that. There are better but many more worse."
"Pours a deep oily black with 2 fingers of foamy chocolate milk tan colored head. Great lasting retention leaves behind nice lacing lattice work. Smells of chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, dark fruits, and a touch of citrus. Tastes of milk chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, lactose, raisins, and plums with a nice bitter finish of coffee, citrus and floral hops, and bakers cocoa. Medium in body with good carbonation. Smooth and creamy yet bitter and chewy too. Hides the alcohol well. A good Imperial Stout with nice roastiness, chocolate sweetness, and bitterness of coffee and hops. Definitely has all the characteristics of a RIS, though a little more on the mild side, but very drinkable, and definitely worth opening a bottle for that RIS desire without having to drink a bottle of one of the rarer brews."
"Rather thin for the style. That aftertaste really hurts this one. Aside from that, this would be a great beer. But, when the last flavor in your mouth is medicinal and pungent, everything before it doesnt really matter."
"D: A nice sipper. Well balanced with all the elements you want in a stout. The lack of body makes it easier drinking. Would love to try this on tap."
"Picked this up for under $4 for a bomber. What a great deal on an insanely drinkable RIS! Price often factors into my drinkabilty score, when coupled with the great tastiness without a punishing ABV makes this the closest I've ever come to seeing a session RIS. Of course, you'd be better off savoring this one slowly to appreciate it."
"poured into my duvel tulp glass, poured a heavy black that cant be seen through with a heavy one finger darker tan head that quickley fades to a lacing around the rim, the taste is sweet with hints of mollases, coffiee, rich dark malts, a hint of hops, fine belgan dark choclate. this is smooth from start to finish. this one hides the alchoal well. the second pour is so much better than the first, this is a world class beer for sure."
"drinkability is high. This may be one of my favorite regular stouts. Definitely can't really session this one, at it's higher abv and thickness/full flavorness. But this is definitely one of the ones I'll turn to when I'm craving stout next time. Definitely worth a try."
"Pours black with a tan head. Nose is molasses and malty. Though I have to confess it's hard to smell anything after walking out in the cold. Flavor is thick with malts and a molasses. Thick almost tar thing going on mildly. Smooth. Same goes for liquid feel. Carbonation is low but bites a bit. A very easy drinking double stout."
"Pretty much black in colour with dark brown edges. A dense, frothy two finger cap of brown foam appeared after a hard pour, leaving behind chunky, clinging lace as it fell very slowly. Very malty aroma, a combination of caramel sweetness and roast. Chocolate notes were evident, as well as very light hopping. Very smooth texture, fine bubbles, well-integrated carbonation. Sweet up front, but grassy and light citrus hop flavours melded immediately with caramel, roast and toffee. Bitterness grew into the finish, becoming quite prominent. Just a bit of chocolate appeared mid-palate. The body was just a bit more than medium, a little light for the style yet this made for a more drinkable beer. As did the near lack of noticeable alcohol. Not bad at all, not bad at all."
"Not the most memorable high tests stouts I've tried, but would be interested in making the trip to try it on tap in Seattle."
"D-Be careful. I want more, but only have one."
"As rich as it is, it drinks incredibly well. Alcohol is dangerously disguised. Malty, but balanced. A very nice stout to say the least."
"An excellent choice that's definitely recommended. Just another reason why it's wonderful to be a beer fan in Pennsylvania."
"D: This exceeded my initial expectations. I would have liked to see it increased a couple percentage points on the ABV but regardless this drinks like a nice dessert. I can see myself picking this up quite regularly through the fall and winter."
"D: Smooth and silky on the tongue, yet didn't really make the taste buds dance. A moderately decent drinking stout."
"Without doing my homework I had expected a dry stout. Sitting down to review it I discovered it listed as an American Double. The truth is it lay somewhere in between. It has the rich cast of character like an Imperial, but the drinkability of an average stout - the already empty glass in front of me is proof of that. Fortunately for me, that glass only held half the bottle!"
"D: Decently drinkable and midlevel ABV. Tasty brew. Thanks for the bottle, torchednoodle!"
"O - very good example of the style."
"Mouthfeel is smooth with a little carbonation."
"Drinkability- I'm between scores on the drinkability because of the complexity. This beer is a prime example (much like Samuel Smith's IS) that an Imperial Stout doesn't have to be loaded with alcohol to be great. I took my sweet time enjoying this beer trying to pick out every flavor and let it coat the mouth. However, after I was done with the bomber, I was ready to move on to something on the lighter side. Give it a try!"
"Recommended..."
"No big surprises - there are typical notes of chocolate, molasses, and coffee. Somewhat creamy mouthfeel, which I always appreciate."
"Overall- Very tasty and incredibly smooth. Excellent stout!"
"This is a tasty stout and one I'll seek out again. Borders on the Imperial category. Full complex flavor."
"This is a stout that pulls short of being a RIS and that is not a bad thing. The beer pours black and full headed with the roasty hoppy notes on the nose. When you get to drinking you realize that drinkability is key for this beer though the ABV approachs 8%. The finish is long but almost Oatmeal stoutlike in style. Don't expect the vinous RIS notes but rather enjoy a great drinking stout."
"I've seen this one in the stores and passed it by many times, so glad i decided to try it this time and this will certainly not be the last."
"Pours a complete midnight black with a full three finger brown head that takes its time to fall to a fluff layer of bubbles. An amazing thick wall of lacing is left behind on the sides of the glass. Smell consists of smokey roasted malts, chocolate, molasses, and coffee grinds. Hops make their presence known in the aroma as well, very nice nose to this one. Toasted grains, smoked barley, and bitter hops up front in the flavor. Sweet caramel and chocolate malts midway with more bitterness. Aftertaste is full of molasses and touch of vanilla. Medium to full body with a bit of a watered down feel. Carbonation is subtle but fits the beer well. A very enjoyable impy stout for sure, one worth seeking out."
"Overall - Enjoyable beer."
"I enjoyed the beer, but it wasn't much of an imperial. No alcohol sting to it at all. It was well-balanced and highly quaffable, but I doubt it will age well. Frankly, the pleasure was too much in the balance, and with age that would get muddied. So I guess I'd say a good but not special beer"
"Drinks a bit slow, but maybe to be expected on a warm summer's evening. Not a bad IMP stout, a bit off-style; more on the restrained side, think Odell IMP for instance, so far nothing but winners from this brewery!"
"D-A solid RIS. Very full flavoured and well rounded. I would happily drink this again."
"D: Around the middle for an IS, but I like that style a lot so its above average overall."
"D: It's too much beer for a long session but I could enjoy two or three bombers before the sweetness and big body would overcome my lust."
"Drinkability: A fine, tasty stout from Elysian."
"Pours black with a nice tan head that sticks around as a ring. Roasty and creamy aromas are nice, but a little light. The taste is nicely balanced with a medium roastiness, creaminess, a bit of licorice and chicory, and a slightly bitter finish. Smooth and relatively creamy mouthfeel, this is an easier drinker and well crafted."
"Pours black with a short lived tan head. Smell is mild dark roastiness and a hint of cardboard. Taste is dry burnt roastiness. Medium bodied with similar carbonation. A bit ashy and slightly bitter from the nice sharp hops. Could use a touch more body, but the dark, burnt flavor is nice."
"22oz bomber poured into an imperial pint glass. Pours a thick pitch dark black with a tan head. The aroma is dark roasted malt and a lot of roasted coffee flavors explode from the aroma as well. The taste is dark roasted malts up front with some bitter coffee flavors in the finish and a good dose of lingering hops. This brew is definitely on the hoppy side as far as stouts go. The mouthfeel is heavy and thick and slightly chewy. Overall, this is a very flavorful stout that is recommended."
"[edit: revisited review 6/26/2011, bumped taste 3.5-->4.0 and overall 3.5-->4.0]"
"D_This is a delicious stout. Went really well with an oyster sampler at the Brooklyn. I could down a few of these and would if I lived in Seattle."
"Overall: I went to lunch not expecting much of a craft beer selection but this was a very nice surprise on the Brooklyn Seafood-Steak House menu. A very solid beer that I would make a staple in my fridge if I could get it locally."
"Hard to improve on the drinkability of this one. It is very drinkable for a 7+ ABV brew. The alcohol is masked nicely, the bitterness is not overpowering. A very drinkable stout indeed."
"Draft at Elysian Fields in Seattle. I had this beer and the porter, and this was definitely the better of the two. Poured a midnight black with a large, well-lacing tan head, that showed good retention. Very rich, roasty nose, but every now and then it seemed more subdued and fainter. Flavours included chocolate and caramel, and there was a pleasant bitterness from deeply roasted coffee grinds. Full, creamy body. I could drink this all night long!"
"This bottle is better than I had remembered dragonstooth. Pours jet black with a nice one finger tan/brown head. The head dissipates quickly with a bit of lace. The nose has some alcohol tones but is mostly of bitter chocolate. The first taste is much richer and more chocolaty than i had expected. Great dark chocolate and mocha type flavors. The finish has some alcohol with a little hoppy bite. This is an interesting brew, and more complex than i had expected. At 7.4 it is slightly on the weak side for an imperial, but is thick and chewy like one, with the finish and smoothness of an oatmeal stout. I like it. I think it is an interesting beer. Unusually refreshing and drinkable for a stout of its kind. A solid beer, nothing incredibly extraordinary, but a solid brew."
"d - nice sipper and my girlfriend and i really enjoyed this one."
"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy tan head, some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, good dose of toffee/coffee/caramel. The taste is slightly sweet/bitter, malty, some nice tones of toffee/coffee/caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty double stout, recommended."
"It's understandable why this one costs a little extra."
"Drinkability is good. This one scores points for being interesting and unique, and it's certainly worth a try."
"A pretty good example of an imperial stout."
"Overall, recommended. An altogether tasty RIS."
"I taste the malt right off and the higher abv is apparent. The chocolate flavor arrives in the palate and the end. The mouthfeel was good and the chocolate lingers for some time. Since I started reviewing this is the first American Double Stout and it is definitely a little more bold than a normal stout."
"The stout poured a nice thick dark dark brown in color with no foam. The smell of roasted malts and chocolate filled my nose. But the taste of all the components in this stout was great. You can taste the roasted malts that had chocolate, with a hint of coffee. Not overly sweet and not overly bitter either. Nice balance of all the components when put together! A very nice surprise and a wonder experience in a great stout!"
"Drinkability- The best tasting 7.4% stout I have had. Can't believe it's that low in alcohol with all the massive flavors. Maybe the best price for a great beer I have had as well. Only $3.29! For a bomber of very quality double stout."
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly lush and pillowy, giving purpose and life to the oily flat slick to which I erroneously feared this stout would succumb. On the pour this drooped like a Dali pocketwatch, but in the cheeks and jowls it dances like a Rockette. Covered in caramel, dark chocolate, coffee feans and whipped cream as it were. Now there's a thought..."
"I have had this beer a few times over the years & it is always an enjoyable tipple, I seem to enjoy it best when sampled fresh from the brewery (despite this being a strong beer). It does hold up well in the bottle, but seems a touch to bitter and acidic from the roast malt (though only just a bit). As the beer warms up and breathes a bit, it does smooth out some; it becomes more creamy, with the chocolate & smooth coffee notes becoming more pronounced. A rich, dark, spiciness also becomes noticeable; sort of reminiscent of the type of spices used in a black, holiday-type, spice cake (notes of vanilla, perhaps a hint of clove, and a wisp of nutmeg). All in all quite an enjoyable beer."
"D - Smooth and malty with alcohol well hidden with no cloying sweetness or overly bitter flavors. A good strong stout with flavor to spare"
"it tastes just great... this nutty flowery slightly carmely general festival on the tounge. i find myself wanting to just suckle a mouthfull until it all slowly drips down the back of my throat... this beer is a must have, especially if you find it on tap. you will be the envy of your friends... or you can be the hero of the day and bring them a whole pitcher to share!"
"A pretty tasty stout, and more interesting than I expected. I've never been terribly impressed with the Elysian beers I've had, though not let down by them either. This one moves to the front of their pack for me. With a bit more body this would be a world-beater."
"Came in a pint glass, a beautiful deep opaque black with a thick dense brown head and great lacing. Nose is malts, coffee, and a small hint of hops. Nice and toasty. Taste is roasty malts, some smoke, and slight alcohol on the finish. Mouthfeel is good and seems to improve upon warming. Drinkability is pretty good too. Good job, Elysian."
"D: Very smooth and drinkable with a nice robust body. A nice stout and one that needs to be had. I've enjoyed this brew."
"I actually drank this beer from the bottle while tailgating at Quest Field for the Seahawks home opener. All I had was plastic cups, so after viewing the color, and getting a second perspective on the nose, I opted to enjoy the rest against the glass it came in! The color was a deep espresso hue, with the foamy light brown head that would accompany it. The nose had fantastic hints of chocolate, caramel, and subtle coffee tones. The taste was comparable....milk chocolate malts, coffee, fresh rolled oats, and a finish of dark chocolate. The mouth feel was velvety and rich, probably due to the rich oily texture that the oats tend to lend to the body of a beer. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer with Italian bread, fresh ricotta cheese, and thinly sliced cappacola...would fare well on its own as well...Enjoy"
"Dark brown almost mahogany with a lovelly large l frothy/thick lighter brown head. bitter dark chocolate type aromas, some alcohol too, slightly spicey. Some hops. Very nice taste, dak ,bitter yet smooth and chocolaty. Milky, slightly sour, alcohol detectable, some black coffee in the finish. Nice palate, I believe the oats add to the pleasurable mouthfeel, giving a luxuriant thickness. Overall a good drinking stout, not the best but good enough."
"Poured a jet black with a well formed tight creamy-like mocha colored head that had great lasting power,mild molasses and bitter chocolate notes mainly with a hint of raw earthiness as well.Nice velvety smooth creamy mouthfee it glides and coats very well,nice balance of sweetness and dry earthiness notes of molasses and licorice with chocolate tones thruout as well as underlying cola notes,a nice drying subtle earthiness comes thru late making it very drinkable.A damn good double stout to be had very flavorful and pretty complex,recommended."
"Dark, big brown head, some sediment. Odor is chocolate with some cherries, sort of plum and sherry like as well. Taste is again a lot of chocolate, some bitterness, alcohol and weak cherry presence. Not particularly complex, but its nice. fairly thick. For the price ($3.99), i'd buy another bomber."
"D - As far as drinkability goes, this is amazingly easy to drink for a 7.4% Double Stout. Easier to drink than a lot of session beers to be perfectly honest, and a nice price point that makes it very accessible."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer has a very smooth and creamy medium body. The beer has a dry finish. This is an easy beer to drink. I could polish off a couple bombers of this one by myself. A dam sham I cant get more in Cincinnati. Oh well, I will always be able to go to Chicago."
"Thanks Andrew! Pours black, with a frothy mocha head, providing good retention and lace. Aromas are big dark fruit(plum, prune), lots of dark chocolate, raisin, and a surprising amount of hops. FLavour is very hoppy and choclatey, bitter coffee, and tonnes of fruit. Assertive bitterness finishes with a touch of chalk and pleasant astringency. Shit yes bitch, this is good!"
"What a wonderful Stout this is."
"Fluffy darker head that slips away and the first swallow is a winner. Makes me think duh, why haven't I tried this before. It's terrible when we missout on tasty beers just because they are easily availible. I'm kicking myself over this one. Wow...tasty and well worth it."
"Starts thick, thins by mid-bomber, but still a very quaffable brew. If you dig stouts, be sure to sample one or two bottles of this goodie."
"drinkability: well getting though the bomber was easy enough. I nice enough Sunday drinker, but lets just say I'm not terribly depressed that I can't get this beer in California."
"D- This beer has a nice drinkability but there is not much depth so it gets a bit boring for more than one bottle."
"D: Good drinkability."
"22 oz bomber. This brew pours a sinister black color, with only light penetrating at the edges when I tile the glass. There was a 2 finger dark tan head over top when I poured it and it fell to a full coat over top. There is just a light carbonation bubbling up in the brew. Nice looking beer. The aroma is very nice. It starts with a big piney hop, backed with chocolate and deep roasted maltyness. It comes together to give hints of coffee as well. All the aromas are big, but in balance with each other. Flavor is excellent. The hop that smacked me in the nose is much more subdued. The flavor is rich in chocolate, moving to a mild pine and roast character that blends in with the sweetness of the chocolate to finish with a mild coffee and a nice moderate bitterness. I think the flavor on this one is excellent, as nothing is out of line or overly strong. It all meshes well. The mouthfeel is moderate with a very light carbonation that makes it fell nice and full. Overall, this one is a very nice beer. Both the flavor and aroma deliver. As it warms, the body really bulks up to a solid full feel, giving me what I had been looking for. For $4 a bomber, this is an excellent value as far as stouts go. Very nice."
"A very fine double stout that I would recommend to all NWers and anyone visiting the area. CHeck it out!"
"Cheers"
"Beutiful like a stout should be. Jet black body with a huge chocolate brown head with huge fat bubbles. Nose is an invigorating smokey malt that just jumps out of the glass, very meaty. There is a lot going on in the nose of this one. Rich robust coffee chocolatey feel attacks the taste buds at first sip. Eases up in the middle and thins up on the bitter that leads to the finish. Finish is slightly sweet with richness and a bitter bite on the end. Not to heavy on the mouthfeel. Very relaxed and nicely drinkable."
"Highly drinkable for a beer of its strength. This is a smooth and rather mellow strong stout. It may not be the best of Elysian's beers, but it's still worth a look."
"I got a slight bit of toffee on the first sip, but later in the glass I am getting just the light sweet/roasty flavors"
"I've passed over various Elysian brews at my local grocery store for a while now, and I thought I'd give one of them a go. Wise choice...indeed. The thick black liquid poured a nice thick tan head and very dark, black, not Stone Imp. Russian Stout black, but black nonetheless. Carbonation bubbles clung to inside of the glass and it was overall a very attractive beer. Smells of fruits, nuts and tones of sweetness caught my attention. The taste was excellent. A hit of bitterness up front with a lingering burnt malt and coffee flavor. A twinge of chocolate in there, but much less than other porters I've had. Smooth and easy to drink, and it got even better as the beer warmed to room temperature."
"Thanks to TheBungyo for the trade. Surprisingly smooth and balanced stout. Neither on sweet nor bitter side, thick mouthfeel and not overally creamy. The little I allowed my office mates to drink they loved, and one hates stouts! A tad oatmeal matter. Very good, black with lots of lace and creamy, obviously quite fresh. And not too roasty either.Chocolate notes with some oatmeal grainess."
"D: Good stout. Fairly complex, takes the drinker on a journey of flavors. From the sour to sweet to roasted to bitter, I'd recommend to all stout drinkers."
"Dark black in the glass, a black hole for light. Head was very thick and frothy with a dark tan colour. Foam dissipated slowly and left some nice lacing. Very mild aroma, but some roasted malts detectable. Very rich and smooth flavour. Delicious strong roasted coffee taste to start with some slight sweetness, but finishes with a dry and bitter chocolate flavour. Higher ABV not noticeable at all. Was lighter tasting then I expected. A fantastic and very drinkable stout."
"Drinkability: this could be considered a meal. But this is a solid double stout in my opinion."
"Pours a two finger brown head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Color can't get any blacker. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Roasted coffee nose. Starts almost sweet with a roasted coffee/chocolate flavor, smooth, finish has hints of burnt coffee. Nice stout. $3.49 for a 22oz bottle from John's Market Place Tigard, Or."
"Very good...I'd like to get some more."
"later on in the bottle I got the more pronounced hops.. it still is not as hoppy to me as say the Smuttynose imp stout.. but it was better, but still not better than a 4"
"Pours black with a tall tan head that leaves a nice coating of lace as it dwindles down. Aroma is full of roasted malts with some bitter dark chocolate backing it. Lingering notes of coffee and a light smokiness were present. Flavor starts off a bit sweet before some notes of bakers chocolate and roasted malts take over. Some mild notes of dark fruit and a good bit of smokiness round it out. Roasty chocolate finish. Smooth and fairly thick but could stand to have a bit bigger body. Easy drinking for a big brew. Great all around effort on this one."
"A fullbodied, thick stout. Decent head retention with a nice lace left all the way down. Smells like chocolate and roasted coffee. Tastes likewise with a burned malt. Can detect a slight hop presence also. A very full mouthfeel, this is one thick, filling brew. Thickness hurts drinkability a tad but still excellent. A very good almost great stout."
"Being an enthusiastic fan of Elysian Brewing Company beer, I had every confidence that this would be a humdinger of an American Double Stout. I'm still surprised, however, by just how good it is. I don't remember every detail and haven't memorized the scores of my favorites, but there's no doubt in my mind that Dragontooth stands proudly among them."
"A big thanks to a fella in Washington named Corey - for helping me get behind the source of this story."
"Roasty malts and bitter chocolates are revealed by the aroma. Deep impenetrable black body holds a firm thumb thick and lasting mocha head. Fore is full of bitter bakers chocolate and roasty malts. There is a bit of smooth and creamy roundness from the oats, but this isnt your standard sweet stout. Its much bigger and more bitter...an fairly big Stout really."
"Thanks to Mickey for the trade!"
"This beer poured a dark black with a creamy tan head that left good lace. Smelled of heavy roasted chocolate with a slight sourness. The flavor began with big initial roasted malts but then shifted into a nicely paired citrus, almost cola-like sourness and sweet prunes. Finished with a blast of espresso. Mouth feel was medium bodied with a light lingering carbonation."
"Last swigs: Bitered with Magnum, Cascade and Centenial. $3.49 is a steal!"
"Had on tap at the Elysian bewpub in Seattle. Poured a pitch black with comparitively dark brown head. Aromas are definitely roasted malts through and through with very strong black coffee taking the forefront. Taste is how it smells, coffee coffee coffee, Definitely a coffee lovers stout. Really bold and flavorful but for me a little too much emphasis on coffee, somewhat lacking in the other roasted flavors i enjoy such as chocolates. A delicious beer nonetheless, just a little unbalanced."
"Overall, a decent stout. Certainly not great, but solid."
"I was planning on sampling a couple of the NW beers on tap this night. But as soon as I got my lips on the first pint I knew I had found a home for a while and was not going to stray to any other beers."
"This is seriously tasty stuff. The fact that it's ""only"" 7.4% makes it all the easier to down in my opinion. I will definitely keep my eyes peeled for more of this stuff."
"One negative comment - the serving temp was too cold."
" A very easy drinking stout."
"Finger licking good!"
"Pitch black in color with a very nice,deep tan head that lasts a good while. Nice lacing on down the glass. Very subtle aroma-slight roastedness with a great chocolate backround. Wonderful flavor-big roasted malt and a slight coffe-like taste. Somewhat sweet almost could be a milk stout. Nice dryness in the finish-not as harsh as some double/imperial stouts can come off as. Excellent body. Overall really well balanced between the aroma/flavor/body mix. A fantastic beer. Thanks to Art ""the man"" for bringing this to me from Olympia. Get some!!!"
"This beer pours a dark body with a thick dirty brown head. Aroma is of citrusy, piney hops with a hint of roasted malt. The taste is smooth with just a hint of coffee taste and sweet malt. The taste is balanced with piney hops and has a citrusy hop aftertaste. The mouthfeel of this beer is thin, drinkability is good. The alcohol content is well hidden."
"Drinkability  This is one of the few good Stouts that are produced here in the PacNW. The label says that its a winner of the gold medal in 2001 & 2004 at the GABF, and I certainly see no reason to doubt that claim."
"d: 4, its strong and rich, but very enjoyable."
"This stout poured an almost opaque black color with brown foam that left nice lace on the glass. The smell was slightly sweet and malty with an almost vinous, fruity quality. The taste was mainly dark roasted malt and barley but with some sweet oats and a slight fruitiness. The hop bitterness was mildly noticeable in the finish. This stout was smooth but a bit sharp on the tongue. Overall it was tangy and malty with a dry finish. The body was full with good carbonation. This was a very nice and enjoyable stout."
"This is one of the most raw stouts I have tasted in a long time. A nice dark ruby-brown color with no head, the aroma is very light with some hint of malt. The primary governing characteristic here is the bitterness. The bitter quality of teh stout, while not completely unwelcome, accentuates the thin body. The malt presence isn't too bad, but all together not a favorite."
"I had this beer on tap at the NW Dinner at Redbones this week. Solid black body with a fluffy tan head that lasted. Malt, oats and a hint of sweetness are the flavors that came through. Well balanced stout as no one flavor pushed through. This beer has a higher ABV so look out. This is the second beer that I have had from Elysian and I am once again very impressed."
"Thick and flavourful, a perfect beer to pair with a dessert or chocolate none the less."
