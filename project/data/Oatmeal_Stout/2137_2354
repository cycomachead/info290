3.65,0.3,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.5,"Overall : I enjoy the beer but there's a lot wrong with it. First off, there's no oatmeal. If you're going to advertise ""oatmeal stout"" on the label, I should be able to detect it with one of my five senses. This is very much an English Stout, as it's a bit too intense for a milk or sweet stout and is wreaked with kilned malts. Drink it ice cold, because as it warms up its flaws become glaringly clear. It's basically very burnt and charred, mixing with some dark chocolate and dirt and hop. It's decent but not outstanding.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Mar 21, 2015"

Pours clear nearly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roast, caramel, toast, dark bread, oats, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roast malt and moderate hop notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roast, caramel, toast, dark bread, oats, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Moderate amount of earthy herbal/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roast, toast, dark bread, oats, light char, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/roast malt flavors with moderate hop presence; with nice robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, smooth, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 4.9%. Overall this is a very nice oatmeal stout. All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/roast malt and moderate hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 14, 2014"

Hops add a bitterness in the back that is welcome to the style as the malts are not quite as fierce as they could be, but then again it is a pretty light ABV beer, so it makes sense. But still, a bit more of a kick from the malts, not the booze, would have accentuated some very nice flavors here instead of having a light-medium bodied beer. That said, its not a bad beer by any means. A prickly mouthfeel in the middle moves to a dry, more effervescent finish, aided by the balancing hops. I wouldn't turn this down, pretty solid beer here.","chodinheaven","Jan 13, 2012"

Still, I am cycling through a few stouts this month as a learning experience. The Breckenridge Oatmeal Stout is black, no surprise here, but the head was really thin, as was the aroma. Flavor was a meaty roast malt up front with some bitter coming on near the end. There is a lot of beer here, be warned. It would be hard for me to drink two, but this is the case for any American style stout. Overall, the Breckenridge offering is on par with other American Stouts I have tried.","iSip","Dec 17, 2011"

Large amount of chocolate, medium amount of coffee, with a smaller amount of grains. A very small amount of alcohol could be smelled. Taste was slightly milky, at times was sweet, and other times was a bit bitter. Grains could definitely be tasted on the tongue if allowed to linger. Felt ok in the mouth.

The nose comprises toasted wheat, toasted oats, light roasted malts, and light chocolate powder. I gotta admit, though it sounds mild, it's still pretty pleasant and effective. The same, unfortunately, cannot be said of the taste, which is overwhelmingly of charred oats, with some chocolate powder, mild coffee, and black pepper being neglected in some flavor basement. That isn't to say things taste bad, just not as good as they smell. The body is a light-feeling medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a pretty smooth feel.

Head eventually settles into a consistent soapy skim with delicate strands of lacing encircling the edges of the glass. Nose is rather subdued, but a suggestion of cocoa, roast and oats comes out in the mix. Taste consistent with nose, but there's also a slight artificial sweetener character interspersed in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a carbonation that falls just short of lively and a slightly creamy texture. All and all, a pretty drinkable Oatmeal Stout and quite flavorful for the abv.

I would have pegged this for a beer with a much higher alcohol content. It pours a fairly thick, inky black color, not much head or lace. The beer is very deep roasted and has some charred notes, but also some sweeter roasted notes below. The beer is creamy, and a bit oily on the tongue, and maybe has a touch of a metallic flavor to it. There are some molasses chocolate notes here as well. This is a decent stout, the bittering hops do make an appearance, and the beer is quite substantial. I like it but it's not my favorite oatmeal stout.","albern","Mar 28, 2011"

The hops are too strong, and whatever oatmeal they used didn't really smooth things out. There's a strong tang of vinyl, too, as if they melted a few 33s into the vat.

Smell is very sweet, almost intimidatingly so, full of dark cherry and fresh bread and oats, maybe a hint of chocolate. Mouthfeel is thin and a little underwhelming. Mild carbonation, sort of malty on the front end, with a fruit-tinged, slightly woody middle and a mild, gently bitter finish. This gets the basics right, and it's mellow enough to be highly drinkable -- I'm enjoying mine -- but there's not a ton going on here, overall. In regards to the oatmeal stout style generally, Samuel Smith's, Buffalo Bill's, Barney Flats, Dark Horse - pretty much every other oatmeal stout I've tried, really - is as good or better. I'd probably go with a C+, but the B- that BA tallies the score out as is close enough.","bfflo","Dec 16, 2010"

The smell is mostly a standard stout mix of roasted and toasted grain and espresso with little if any hops presence and mirrors the taste yet there's a little bitter pine in the aftertaste that's overpowered by espresso in the finish. The feel is a little thinner than I expected but not too bad. Overall not bad, and yet I feel guilty for reviewing this beer. The brewery didn't feel it important enough to mark the brewing dates on the bottles (indeed, only the stout was marked in a mixed case with any dates, yet not marked or notched to indicate the actual bottling date) Perhaps this beer is better fresher but as I know not when it was brewed then I'll review their beers as I drink them regardless of the condition of the beer.

Looked good. Smell was dominated easily by a somewhat assertive ""used coffee grounds"" aroma which I found very pleasant. Flavour, too, was dominated by this characteristic with little else coming through save for some very modest tones of toasted malt and oatmeal. This should be re-labeled Breckenridge Espresso Stout or something and have a bit of coffe thrown in the wort to make it so. Mouthfeel is right about where it needs to be for a stout being neither too thin nor cloyingly heavy, but right in between those two.

Just not the nose I enjoy in my Oatmeal Stouts. Taste starts off with some brown sugar and wheat bread. Some chocolate and caramel find their way on the tongue. Aftertaste weak smoked oatmeal with a tiny bit of cane sugar. Overall the flavors are pretty weak. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a much too watered down texture.

Bitterness was solid, but not quite up to the task of balancing the malt. There was also a pleasant, lingering roastiness and a kiss of hop flavour. Medium bodied with a bit of a creamy texture.

There were minimal hop aromas to speak of but the hop bitterness added to the burnt floavor of the coffee which increased the harsher flavor. Mouthfeel was fairly smooth and enjoyable.

3.91,7.4,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This just appeared in local stores, so it must be a seasonal that's fresh from the brewery. Nice silk-screened bottle, but no freshness date. Pours a two finger really frothy brown head. It's the color of light brown sugar. The beer is pitch black and has a hint of mahogeny edgings when held to light. Smell is roasted grains, lactose, and cotton. It just has a milky smooth smell about it. Chocolate became more apparent as the beer warmed. Tastes dry roasted grain. It would be rough but there is a smoothness in the malt sweet and the mouthfeel that tame this roughness. It's like dancing around in a dangerous situation, because you've got safeguards you trust will pull you out should something go bad. The sweet smooth carries some black patent sour/bitter that's mixed with a really nice caramel flavor. The roast wins out in the end, coming across in the aftertaste as a sugar-sweetened richly roasted coffee. I think there is some hop bitter mixed in with the coffee roast. Hop flavor is mildly grassy and comes across as the rounded 'cottony' flavor I associate with Fuggles (or possibly Williamette) hops. Body is only medium, but it's got some silky qualities that you expect in an oatmeal stout. Nothing like Samuel Smith's (for me, the best example of silky mouthfeel), but still a nice feature. As the beer warmed, an alcohol presence became apparent in the aftertaste that was not enjoyable. I'll bet this will settle if the beer is aged. Carbonation is on the mild side of moderate and there is really amazing lacing on the inside of my glass. A nice beer that's helped me realize fall brisk air means that winter is quickly coming. Over the next couple months, I'll probably enjoy a couple more bottle and may set back a bottle to age through the summer.","mentor","Oct 24, 2005"

Aromas of coffee, caramel, toffee, smoked malts, roasted earth and grains dominated the nose and implied a treat was waiting in the glass. Taste was great; flavors of grain, malt and earth were in a cyclone of harmony, blending very well. My only qualm with this brew is in the mouthfeel. This was far too weak, lacking the thickness and depth of a good oatmeal stout. Still, it's not enough to take away from the overall enjoyment of this beer.

3.14,-13.7,4,2.5,3.5,3,3,"Pours incredibly dark with only a small head that dissapated quickly. As for the taste...wow. The first thing that hits you is all the chocolate, with some nice toasty notes. I just wish it had a little more body and a longer finish. It starts off really nicly on the palate...and just ends. I wanted more of that nice dark chocolate! Waa. Ah well, still a nice fall/winter brew for the cold months.","queenboadicea","Mar 16, 2003"
3.16,-13.2,4,3,3,3,3.5,"This may just be the blackest beer Ive ever had. It pours blacker than tar, and like tar, it was completely impervious to light: no photons made it through this babyreflection city A brown head of fairly long lasting foam rode across the top, lacing a bit. The hops could be teased out of the nose a little, but the malts captured most of that sense. The primary aroma was not at all unlike canned Hersheys Cocoa Powder: the kind my mom used to bake with, not the kind you can mix into chocolate milk. The nose even smelled powdery. The medium full body was pretty roasty, with lots of coffee bean flavors and bitter chocolate to boot. A mellow, subtle sweetness lingered underneath a fairly assertive bitterness all through the glass. Obviously some warmth magnified the malty aspects of this stout, pushing the sweetness forward and bringing the beer more into balance with the bitterness. Neither flavor ever really became assertive, letting the beer create kind of a boring memory of itself: just an aftertaste of slight bitterness and slight roastiness to go along with the finish that thinned out more than Id have liked. Im all for balance, and I think this beer achieved that relatively rare attribute (rare for American beers), but at the expense of character. I really couldnt find too much complexity or flavors of interest. Still, it was a solid beer and one Id drink again.","TXHops","Mar 13, 2003"
4.45,22.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Like all Oatmeal Stouts I've had, this one looks beautiful in the glass. Completely black with absolutely no light coming through. It has a nice brown head that clings to the glass on the way down. I could smell chocolate, roasted malt, and a even some alcohol coming through. It was a nice chocolate and oat flavor at first followed by a nice hoppy finish. A very drinkable beer that I will look for again.","darklager","Feb 02, 2003"
4.25,16.8,4,4,4,4.5,5,"This brew poured solid black with a sort of weak head, there was good lacing though. The aroma was of roasted malt and chocolate. A little bit of coffee was also detectable. The taste was exactly like the nose. The front was roasted malt with bitter chocolate following that. The aftertaste tasted like coffee and was much more bitter than other oatmeal stouts I've had. I thought this brew was very good and very drinkable. It went down smooth and wasn't filling at all. The bitterness goes well following that strong chocolate middle. This would make a good session brew.","Bruiser81","Jan 31, 2003"
3.86,6,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This was a good beer, not great, but I would buy it again. It is rather bitter, but the flavor is not quite full enough or malty enough to balance this bitterness. Also, the beer didn't feel thick enough in the mouth. Maybe my expectations were high due to its appearance in the glass, but this brew could have been ""fuller."" But, like I said, it was still a good beer.","Quaffer","Nov 28, 2002"
3.53,-3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a black ruby color with a creamy tan colored head that quickly fades into a patchy lace. Nose is sweet roasted malts and oatmeal with notes of dark coffee and bitter chocolate. Smooth and creamy in the mouth but is a bit thin. Taste is burnt coffee and is quite bitter. Not a very complex brew but still enjoyable. However, there are definitely better oatmeal stouts out there.","Morris729","Beers"
4.23,16.2,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Comes out of the bottle a real nice dark black, the head was nice and tan but diminished rather quickly. This is a great tasting oatmeal stout, nice mouthfeel and great coffee and chocolate tastes come through. Good stuff. My only complaint is that its a little on the thinnish side as far as texture and taste are concerned. Once you get to the bottom of the glass and it's not as cold it starts to bring out some more of the beers taste. From a non-experts perspective I give it a thumbs up!","alittlehazy","0"
3.58,-1.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"An overall good outmeal stout. Nice complexity for a beer without a lot of strength.. Finsh could be more rounded.","nathi","Oct 06, 2002"
4.37,20.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Black and opaque, with a thin but persistant tan head. Aromas of chocolate, coffee, and a touch of sweetness. Flavors blend very nicely... chocolate, coffee, maybe just a hint of caramel sweetness, and a very faint, but perceptable hop flavor. It's very smooth and creamy, with a full body and low carbonation. I really can't find a single flaw with this beer. Wonderfully done!","zerk","Oct 01, 2002"
4,9.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a deep sable with a small slowly-developing head, modest lace.  Aroma consists of dark roasted malts, coffee, and bitter chocolate, with a hint of hops.  Taste begins with rich dark malts, coffee, and bitter dark chocolate, a little hops toward the finish.  A slight bitter chocolate note and some nut flavors linger long after the finish.  Not a particularly complex beer, but very good.  Perfect for a cold winter's day.","Pegasus","Sep 29, 2002"

3.68,1.1,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a nearly black color with a tan head.  The smell is pretty good with a slight burnt malty notes.  The taste, well was not as pleasing.  It has a very crisp hoppy character that sticks out and is not favorable for an oatmeal stout.  Not creamy at all as the mouthfeel is somewhat watery compared to others in this style.  Not bad, but decent at best.  Cheers!","BeerAngel","Sep 04, 2002"
4.42,21.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Deep amber/near black in color with a short-lived caramel head.  The aroma was roasted malt with coffee and chocolate undertones and a mild hop appearance.  The flavor was big on roasted/coffee and dry in the finish.  The mouthfeel was smooth and the flavor lasted forever.  It is an extremely drinkable stout and I can't wait for the next one.","ryanocerus","Jul 19, 2002"
4,9.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Chocolate syrup anyone?  This thick dark brew is one of the heaviest bodied oatmeal stouts I have tasted.  Even the pour looks like you are pouring dark extract.  The head sticks around for a little bit leaving a bold smoky chocolate malt aroma.  The chocolate malt creates a large part of the flavor with a brush of smoke and a quick dash of spice from the hops.  Hands down the best brew bottled by Breckinridge so far.","beernut7","Jun 19, 2002"
2.95,-19,4,4,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Right away this Oatmeal Stout made me say ""Wow!"" A wonderful and fairly strong smell of chocolate and roasted malt burst out of the bottle. This beer is as black as the forgotten banana with a nice tan head. But... this beer only has a fair blend of flavors. I like chocolate influences just fine but it fades to soon and the coffee flavor is not in tune as to what I would deem enjoyable. There is some oats sweetness. This is not a great Oatmeal Stout by any stretch of the imagination. It is a fair attempt. I would not drink this again unless it was free. Smooth to drink.","bditty187","May 31, 2002"
2.48,-31.9,4,3.5,2,2,2,"Chocolate and beer do not belong with oatmeal. Not even Wilford Brimley would approve. There are other stouts I would rather have if given the choice. I may have gotten a bad batch but I have had much better Chocolate Stouts since.","Dogbrick","Apr 04, 2002"
4.2,15.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Reddish black in color with a distinct coffee - like roasted barley flavor and bitter.  A bit thin in body for an oatmeal stout, but still demonstrates the ""oat"".  After 1 brew,  the bitterness seems to mellow on the palate. Especially tastey when watching the NHL wings beat the avalanche in a game 7.","stoutman","Mar 26, 2002"
4.24,16.5,5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"pours out almost pure black, with a healthy tan head.  not much in the nose but a bit of the citrusy hops.  mouthfeel  isn't as smooth as you might like it for an oatmeal stout but the taste is pretty yummy.  dark roasted and chocolate malts are present but not too bitter. in fact they tilt toward the bittersweet side which makes this very quaffable, especially as it warms a bit.  a very tasty rendition of the style.","budgood1","Mar 22, 2002"
3.9,7.1,4,4,4,3,4,"Thick, tan head.  Just a tad shy of being black, since a deep red hue can be discerned when held up to a light.  Lots of chocolate malt and a coffee - like roasted barley aroma is quite enjoyable.  Roasted barley bitterness is high, and the hop profile only serves to balance the assertive roasted grain flavors, but does it well.  A bit thin in body for an oatmeal stout, but still manages to possess some of the ""silkiness"" that great OS's have.  It finishes fairly dry with roasted malt bitterness.  This is a good beer, but just needed a bit more body.  I think I'll go for a Shakespeare Stout now.","marc77","Dec 25, 2001"
4.27,17.3,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours black with a dense brown head that laces the glass nicely as you drink. Nutty aroma. Chocolate notes also on the nose. Fairly bitter for an oatmeal stout. Nice taste though. Bittersweet chocolate comes to mind. Medium body. Smooth mouthfeel. A slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall, a fairly solid oatmeal stout.","Bighuge","Beers"
3.03,-16.8,3.5,3,3,3,3,"12-25-01-This is an ok stout..Good bitter chocolate tones..finish is definitely on the dry side..I get an odd off taste on occasion...maybe a tich of caramel, but it is not real strong and hard to detect.
