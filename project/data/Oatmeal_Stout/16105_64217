The beer leaves a lacing that is light and slippery, leaving very little to look at on the glass. On the nose, the beer smells wonderfully rich with coffee and oatmeal tones. Roasted barley malts also come through on the nose slightly. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet and drying with a nice roasted bitter flavoring. The beer begins with a little watery roasted malt before opening into big roasted oat flavors with touches of coffee, toffee, and char. The finish brings to mind sweet oatmeal bread, and is very appealing. The aftertaste is tingly with roasted oatmeal and slight coffee. On the mouth, the beer feels medium bodied, with a medium carbonation that lightly prickles the tongue. The mouth is left dry with a light wet sheen of saliva on the sides of the mouth. Overall, this beer is delicious and sessionable. There is a lovely roasted oat flavor that reminds me of winter and a warm stove for some reason. This stout will not blow you away with flavor, but it is solid and tasty and fully deserving of your taste buds.","Maxwell","Feb 18, 2013"

Aroma provides a little smoke, powdery oats, peat moss, and a touch of chocolate. The taste is nice - chocolate and oatmeal are definitely there. Charcoal and Peat moss is brought to mind again on the flavor profile but chocolate milk is what lingers on the finish. Mouthfeel is unfortunately a little flat with lower carbonation...slight oily slickness to it. Again, I wish this felt creamier. But overall it's a tasty oatmeal stout that excels in flavor...if it didn't just lack on the looks and mouthfeel department it would be perfect.","jbertsch","Apr 02, 2012"

I do really like the beer, but the oatmeal is a bit lost in the other malts. 6% ABV is apparent. Much, Much better served warmer. good sixer for the winter.","mlazzaro","Dec 17, 2011"

I hate to say this for fear of being a typical extreme beer nerd, but I'd like this beer to be bigger with more unfermentables and a heavier body.

3.95,0,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The aroma deep with notes of coffee and cocoa, almost bittersweet with a light hoppiness undercutting the deeply roasted malts. Slight peat like aroma as it warmed up. The flavor started out a little off for the style with a health dose of smoked and roasted malts, not exactly at all what I was expecting out of it, but none the matter it was still very good. Rich notes of cocoa overlayed with a hint of dark bakers chocolate and an almost molasses like flavor swirling around in there as well. The finish though was coated with licorice like flavors and very wet, leaving you almost drooling, waiting for another sip to come through. Decent feel on this one, though if I am being honest, towards the end of the session it did start to feel a little bit flat on me, but maybe it was me. Still though, more then decently sessionable and I would have no issues with drinking this again.","mikesgroove","May 27, 2011"

3.82,-3.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"On tap at Cornwall's in Kenmore Sq this past Saturday night. Served in a standard pint glass. Dark brown color, with a very minimal head. Lacing really only at the top of the glass. Smell was very nice, with some coffee aroma really standing out. Flavor was quite good also. There was a great mix of wintery spices from a winter warmer that mingled nicely with the hearty flavors of a stout. Liked the combination a lot. Mouthfeel was a bit thinner than I'd hoped for, and the alcohol was a tad noticeable. A beer that I surely enjoyed, but it's not a beer than I'd stay with all night.

4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"The taste is very nice if for no other reason than the brewer is not trying to jam way too much ABV into a beer that doesn't warrant it. The beer is fairly full bodied, has a nice smoked oaky and molasses character. The oatmeal comes through on the silkiness on the tongue, but it doesn't quite live up to expectation in that there is too much foreground with the slightly burnt flavors, and not enough real chocolate and dark malt qualities where they should belong. As the beer warms, there is a touch of spice hidden away and this adds some complexity. The aftertaste carries on with a bit too much cherryish oaky quality and it just lingers a bit too long. This is a nice beer though, very drinkable for sure.","albern","Feb 10, 2011"

4.1,3.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Always looking forward to new stuff from the people at Mayflower. This Oatmeal Stout pours out a dark brown/almost black with ruby hues on the side. Not much more than a small amount of lacing serves as the head, though it is much darker than I was expecting. Notes of char and smoke begin the smell, followed by some dark fruit, metal and cocoa. Bitter coffee, chocolate, smoke and charred grain are at the center of the flavor profile, which is complex but not overkill. The mouthfeel is pretty light for this style, but it adds to the drinkability in a big way. This is definitely a dark beer that is not a meal in a bottle, and is sessionable too. This is some good stuff here from Mayflower. It nails the English smells and flavors found in the real thing. Cheers","jamie2dope","Dec 22, 2010"

3.49,-11.6,3,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Very dark, no apparent edges. There was a short-lived cap of brown bubbles, but it disappeared quickly leaving only a meager collar. Nice aroma, plenty of roast with chocolate and nutty notes, caramel and toffee, slight charcoal with a hint of licorice. Bitterness was prominent throughout, perhaps a bit higher than needed to balance the sweetness. Roast, caramel, cocoa, and flash of grassy hops towards the end. A little spicy in the finish with lingering sweetness. Medium plus bodied with a slightly silky texture, but the mouthfeel suffered due to the coarseness of the carbonation. Not sure what happened there, but is just didn't have the smoothness I associate with the use of oats. Even with that, it was a pretty tasty beer and I enjoyed it.
