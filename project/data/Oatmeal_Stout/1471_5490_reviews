"This has a nice dark pour with a brown head to it.  Immediately I could pick up the aromas of chocolate and coffee.  The taste was very strong, tasted of roasted malts and coffee with hints of chocolate.  The finish was a little on the bitter and smoky side.  Left my mouth feeling a little dry.  Not a bad brew, but I prefer others in the Dark Horse series."

"12oz bottle poured into stout chalice. Black and opaque with a two finger tan head that leaves a little lacing. Aroma is molasses, cocoa, coffee, and roasted malt. Taste is bittersweet chocolate, coffee, malt, and chicory bitterness. Medium body, thin texture, lively carbonation for a stout, and an astringent finish."
""
""
"This is a well made oatmeal stout. I gave it decent numbers.. Jet black.. Nice aroma, nice taste! I think this stout should get better scores. But everyone's taste is different."
""
""
""
"From the first sniff it was clear drinking would be a chore.  This beer tastes like Hopsy Cola.  Almost a painful feel in the mouth.  As someone once said of a basswood telecaster I will repeat about a highly hoppy stout--'It ain't right, I tell ya.'   I will definitely try other stouts in Dark Horse's series, but probably won't be going back to square one."
""
""
""
"This is a good beer. Out of the five seasonal stouts by Dark Horse I prefer the Fifth (obviously) and Thres. I'm glad I tried this though. A good oatmeal stout."
""
""
""
""
"Just not a fan of this one...and im a stout kinda guy"
""
""
""
"O: I didn't let it sit long enough and the coolness impacted the first impression. As it warmed, the profile also expanded - the roasted oats and trailing bitterness softened (though not entirely) and blended fairly well. With the exception of the head retention - which would have helped expand the profile - and the bitterness, this held true to the basic style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Well done, Dark Horse."
""
"A good Oatmeal stout with bitter coffee, dark chocolate, and caramel flavosr, but lacks the sweetness found in Founders Breakfast Stout - the standard by which I measure oatmeal stouts."
""
""
""
"O: The smell was great but the taste not so much. It didn't have the sweetness I wanted from an oatmeal stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep inky balck with a dark brown and fizzy head. No retention beyond a thin ring around the circumference but it still manages to leave a smudge of small soapy lacing. The aroma is deep malt with hints of cocoa and coffee. The taste is equally robust with more emphasis on the roasted malt. The body is a little lighter with the addition of the oats and has a nice silky feel."

"Giving it a 3.25 just because I keep trying to figure this one out. It tastes like the Marlborough mans leather jacket with some dark chocolate dropped on it. This one needs some sweetness to make it work. I appreciate the smokey note but the bitterness is fighting it in a bad way. But, I keep drinking it. Not a repeat buy, but a happy try. Overall? I hate to be an 8th grade girl, but, ""meh..."""

"Very enjoyable oatmeal stout....had an 8oz draft.  Nice, full flavor....would happily order again."
"Decent oatmeal stout"

"Overall - I dinged it here because it drinks a lot more like a porter than an oatmeal stout. A drinkable beer, but not real good."

"Overall, a pretty simple stout from the Dark Horse crew. I would have liked a fuller body and more creaminess from an oatmeal stout, especially one clocking in at 7.00%. Regardless, this beer is full of flavor and I will have no problem finishing off the four pack!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Dirty. Harsh. Not a fan."
""
""
""
"Solid oatmeal stout - a bargain at 8 for a 4 pack.  Good malt profile with a creamy mouth feel just as you would expect.  Only knock on it is a slight initial wateriness of flavor - it could do with a bit more roast to kick things off."
""
""
""
""
""

"roasted malt bomb, very robust for an oatmeal stout, but I like it.  7% is nice too."

"Not quite as oaty as some, but a nice balance of roast and cocoa. Very drinkable. The chocolate and cherry meld well together."
""
""
"This beer is fantastic"
""
""
""
"O: Not as smooth as I expected for an oatmeal stout, though that might be due to the higher ABV than I normally find in the style. There are lots of complex malty flavors and a decent amount of bitterness though the taste of alcohol is very well hidden. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is dangerously drinkable and quite tasty."
"Bottle is undated, probably 2.5 years old (late 2011). Bottlecap & seal are in great shape. Pours pitch black with a 1/2 finger dark brown, rusty head. Bubbly head dissipated quickly, revealing a viscous, glassy top. Smell is roasted malt, coffee, some bitterness or sourness. Pretty big nose, even when cold. Taste is tangy sweet up-front, reminiscent of berries. This immediately leads to a strong roasted malt flavor: coffee, dark chocolate. Farther back some sweetness, more roast, LOTS of roast. Finish is lots of lingering roast, some hop bitterness too. Mouthfeel is full, way thicker than I would expect, and decent carbonation. I haven't had this beer in a long time, and it exceeded my recollections. It's super-roasty which is this beer's calling card. There is sweetness and bitterness too that gives some complexity, but nothing over-the-top. I need to buy more."
""
""
"O: This is just okay. Nothing sticks out to make it worth repeating. I bought several Dark Horse stouts at the same time and so far none of them have been noteworthy."

"Falls a bit short compared to other highly regarded oatmeal stouts, probably wouldn't get again. That being said, I still enjoyed it."
""

"Overall this is a solid offering from Dark Horse and a good start to the holiday stout series. Very robust and rich flavor that proves to be one hell of an oatmeal stout."
""
""
"O: Label says oatmeal, but doesn't have the character of an oatmeal. The beer looked awesome coming out of the bottle. But, then when you get it into it, it is just too robust, with some very bold aromas and flavors, especially the tobacco character. Nothing is subtle in this brew. Something is off. It isn't terrible, but it isn't really very good either."
""
"O: This would be a nice beer if it wasn't for the bitter finish. It had everything going for it up until then & I would likely be all 4's but the finish is all you remember and rather disappointing"
""
""
""
"I've had One, I have Two, and will need to get myself Tres and Fore to try out when I head back to the store. This is a very respectable oatmeal stout. It's not a fantastic one, but a damn tasty beer that I'd seek out again."
""
"Pours a dark brown color with a foamy tan head that disappears quickly. Aroma is oats and malts. Flavor has a nice, complex combination of flavors that includes sweet oats, roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, and a finish that is mildly bitter. Has a full body feel. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Pours ink black with a quick to form and quick to fade mocha colored head atop,aromas of char and vanilla stick out but honestly are pretty light in my opinion.Low carbonation with a slick feel in the mouth.Flavors of char and vanilla stand out most with roast underneath,a bit of molasses-like sweetness is there as well.I expected a little more with this beer but there are many others to seek out ahead of this...in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"Not what I would call a great oatmeal stout, I finished it, but it took awhile."
""
""
""
""
""

""

"I went with a heavy-handed pour to keep things progressing. This resulted in two dense fingers of deep-brwon head with excellent retention. Nose smelled like someone had melted a milk chocolate candy bar and poured it into my glass. Color was a deep, dark-brown allowing ZERO light penetration (SRM = 44). Mouthfeel was big and chewy, like a dollop of fudge atop my tongue. Phew! The taste was smoky, more towards campfire than house fire, with a chocolaty sweetness that left me wondering what had possessed me. I like hoppy beers, not malt-driven ones, but even so, I will give this a fair shake. Finish continued to be fudgy, sweet and not really my cup of tea. I do not mind bitter stouts, but sweet is never going to make it into my wheelhouse."
"Overall: A solid stout. Full bodied without being anything over the top or to heavy. Not a ton of the oatmeal flavors but some smooth creaminess is picked up. Looked at this line of Dark Horse stouts for a while, glad I finally tried this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a terrible stout, but not a great representative of an oatmeal, which should have a degree of smoothness and long-lasting head this one lacks."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An underrated shelf stout, especially for what it costs and its availability. I definitely enjoyed the flavour profile and mouthfeel, even the smell has some dark fruits to it which I don't get in a lot of shelf stouts. I'm looking forward to the Two Cream Stout which I'll probably crack tomorrow."

"A pretty solid stout with good flavor and aroma. It's not anything special but it's quite a good representation of the style and certainly worth trying."
""
""
""
""
"D: This was a decent oatmeal stout, with simple but enjoyable scent and taste and body. The finish was a bit harsh, but it wasn't difficult to drink. Nice to try once at least, but nothing special."
""
"Overall: I love most Dark Horse brews and while this isn't a favorite, it's not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium-full body with a pleasant flavor. There is some sweetness and roastiness from the malt and a smoothing, grainy, earthy note from the oats. A pretty middle-of-the-road oatmeal stout, neither too sweet nor too dry. Not much of a hop presence. The feel is smooth and silky, but a bit thin for the style. Not much to complain about with this brew, but not much to write home about either."
""
""
"The feel is really smooth with nice thickness, low carbonation and a silky viscosity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not as good as I was expecting, though not a bad beer by any means. Subdued flavors and slight lack of body really detract here. Hopefully the rest of the DH stout series are better. Would have again in case my taste is simply off tonight. DH does know what they are doing when it comes to stouts, after all."
""
""
"Overall a combination of flavors that just doesn't work for me - I like the creamier, lower ABV, and less hoppy oatmeal stout made by Founders better."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/18/2012. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, light char, oats, toast, toffee, dark bread, light vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt notes; with great strength. Taste of dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, light char, oats, toast, toffee, dark bread, light vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, light char, oats, toast, toffee, dark bread, and light vanilla on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt flavors; with great robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy, moderately slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent oatmeal stout! All around great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Overall: This oatmeal stout is very straightforward and simple but is very enjoyable. For the many years that I’ve been buying this, #1 and the Plead the Fifth are my favorites of the 5 seasonal stouts they release from Oct. to Feb."

"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body with medium-low levels of carbonation. Together with the oats, the beer has a substantial smoothness, heaviness, and creaminess, giving this an impression that it is far larger of a stout than it is. Closes dry, with moderate stickiness on the palate and mild astringency from the roasted malts."

"A mighty fine Oatmeal Stout. Extremely quaffable."
""
""
""
"Solid black pour, with a small tan head, that sank to a ringlet. Roasty stout aroma, dark malts, toasted oats and barley. No surprises. This followed into the taste, roasty dark malts, toasted grains, slight coffee bitterness, ash. The body was about medium, kind of weak for an oatmeal stout, but I'd bet it would work well on nitro. A pretty basic but solid oatmeal stout overall."
"I finally found an oatmeal stout that rivals The Poet from New Holland. This has an exceptionally clean finish and a great flavor. Unfortunately, I can't find it close to me but I did find it in Traverse City, MI and I'm glad I did. I'm saving a couple bottles from my 4 pack to let friends try it. I never have a fridge without Poet in it but if I am able to find One Oatmeal Stout nearby, I will make sure that it fills any potential void. Great flavor, great mouthfeel and overall a fantastic brew from Dark Horse!"
"This is a nice offering. The flavor has incredible depth. The chocolate and dark fruit notes are impeccable. But the nuances such as the black licorice add tremendous character. The lightening touch of the oatmeal thins the body just enough to make this incredibly drinkable. This is definitely a stout that is worth trying."
""
"One of my fav. beers to age changes a little but 1 1/2-2 years this beer is fantastic. I usually try to buy a case drink some and then age some. good stuff."
""
""
""
"Thick black beer with a one-finger light brown head that fades to a respectable ring. Smells of sweet caramel and roasty dark malts with hints of marzipan and vanilla. Sweet caramelly maltiness thats almost immediatley balanced by a bitter hops. The finish is a bit rough with the substantial hop bitteness and dark malts amplifying an astringency. 8% abv beer with medium-full bodied mouthfeel that doesn't come of sticky or filmy."
""
""
"O: Nothing amazing, but it's a solid offering. It kind of reminds me of a mediocre imperial stout, and that's actually a compliment in this case."
""
""
"O-The sweetness of an oatmeal stout is not present at all. A tad too burnt as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: thought this was a pretty decent decent beer to be honest, yet quite interesting... its sweet in smell yet pretty bold in flavor in a decent amount of complexity for its style."
""
""
""
"Sweet aroma dominated by a nutty chocolate smell. Pours almost completely black with a nice dark brown head. Has a decently thick, syrupy texture. Creamy and softly carbonated. Has a pleasant sweet, burnt oat, coffee taste with hints of chocolate. Overall, a good stout. Not a big wow factor in terms of taste, but a solid porter nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Solid, flavorful, tasty and easy to drink. Right on for a good oatmeal stout. Really malty and smokey, and coffee bitter. Worth a drink for sure."
"Overall: A pretty solid oatmeal stout. Lots of roasty taste with a nice creamy smoothness. Its what you expect for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is one of my top 3 oatmeal/milk stouts I've ever tasted. I acquired it in a trade and am going to assume that Dark Horse went back to the drawing board over the past few years and changed it up. Its soooo smooth and the balance is uncanny. I am going to trade for this again..and soon."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, pretty solid, although a bit one dimensional. I'd have again."
"Very good oatmeal stout. One of my favorites for the price. However I can see how some people many not like it. The roasted malts used by Dark Horse in their stout series have a much more dark, black coffee taste."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, nothing special, but pretty good. The best aspect of this one is how smooth it is going down. It is creamy and smooth, and despite having only a slightly above average flavor profile, the scent is pretty good."
""
""
""
"Pours a black color. 1/4 inch head of a tan color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, hint of oatmeal, and a hint of hops. Fits the style of an Oatmeal Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, alcohol, sweet malt, slight oatmeal, and a hint of hops. Overall, dominated by alcohol in aroma and body, even though it is only 7% according the the bottle."
""
""
"my first sample of Dark Horse. I'm impressed."
"O: A very good beer. They hit on most of the great qualities that this style can have."
""
"O: This is a nice stout if you like lots of flavors of roasted malts, although I didn't notice any smoothness from the oats in the mouthfeel. No traces of alcohol are perceptible in the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the better oatmeal stouts I have ever had. The beer looked great but lacked in aroma. The taste more than made it up for it. Smoooth and if a beer can be too drinkable this would be it. I could have drank that beer all night. Recommending this to everyone and I hope I can find it in 6ers."
""
"Just about black, with a milk chocolate like brown head. Good retention and great lace. Nose has roast on the front end, with some sweeter caramel and vanilla notes in the middle. Sweeter chocolate as well. Roast oats upfront on the palate, moderate chocolate and drys/thins out on the back end, finishing with roast again. Body is thinner than I appreciate for the style, but alcohol is hidden. A nice oatmeal stout for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep black color crowned with a fat, cocoa head that fades to a slim ring. Thick, rich roasted malt, smooth chocolate, oats, and underlying toffee. Loads of heavy, chocolaty malt over some dark fruit, vanilla bean, and coffee. Some char and bitterness add an edge to an otherwise silky stout. Medium bodied, but pretty velvety and oily which fluffs it up a bit. Very nice! A bit over-roasted perhaps, but delicious nevertheless."
""
""
""
""
"O - A well crafted Oatmeal Stout that is slightly muddled and off in the finish for the style. I get the oats but its finish is not quit what I look for in a oatmeal stout. Not a bad beer at all, but one I will not be in a rush to go back and get. Still enjoyed it though, Cheers!"

"Poured into a pint glass, this is a thick dark color with light tan head. Smells are sweet dark roasted malts, molasses, and cocoa. Taste is heavy on dark cocoa, oatmeal, marshmallow, and roasted malt with some smokiness. Alcohol is somewhat prevalent. This is a decent tasty stout."
"Where the beer far exceeds any expectation of oatmeal stout, it's larger-than-life character causes the beer to register with the palate and tongue as an imperial stout. Though the beer refuses to take sides, it captures the essence of both masterfully."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Just a touch more malt sweetness would have improved this one just a bit, but overall I enjoyed it. Not sure I need to have another in the future, but I wouldn't say no if offered."
""
""
""
""
"Overall. Nice big oatmeal stout. I enjoyed it."
""
""
"Looks alright. Could use a bit more head. Nose is okay as well. Lots of molasses. Flavor is thick. Mostly in body though. The flavor character is constant and robust with a thick kinda thing going on, but there is nothing that really strikes me as unique or interesting. Or nothing that strikes me as an oatmeal stout, to be honest. Oh well. It's still a nice beer."
"O - A pretty standard stout, but the taste really stands out as everything comes together."
""
"Taste-Smoky,charred meat, dark roasted coffee, burnt hops. A definite sipper with big bold flavors, not smooth like a traditional oatmeal stout. Strong tastebuds needed."
""
"O: A super burnt oatmeal stout. Loads of char and smoke everywhere makes it quite bitter despite oatmeal's usual smoothing effect. Better once it warms, flavors meld a bit better."
""
""
""
""
"This has more dark chocolate flavor that any beer I've had in recent memory. This is interesting, but I must note that this beer is lacking some of the attributes I look for in an oatmeal stout. Like, where's my chewy mouthfeel? Regardless, it's worth a try."
"O: Recommended to round out the Dark Horse stout trio. I like them all but I enjoyed three the best with the blueberry addition. This has a dry roasty finish as an oatmeal stout should have, just not my favorite stout style."
"Eh, this was just ok and I find the other stouts from DH much more appealing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Feels slightly creamy, but overall leaves a nice roasty presence late. reminiscent of dark roasted coffee. Best Oatmeal Stout that I've had."
""
""
""
"Overall I was very exited by how it looked and smelled, but it didn't come through where it counted. Certainly not a bad beer but nothing too spectacular either."
""
"Overall- I appreciate the multitude and subtlety of the flavors, but the roast is overdone. I also would prefer it if the nose was stronger in conveying all the subtleties. And the mouth feel could stand to be a bit thicker. Otherwise, this stout is good, and is one I would have again."
""
"O: Bravo, encore! I love a good oatmeal stout, and this one is right up there with the best of the style. Near perfection. A little over-the-top with the roasted malts, but that's right up my alley. I really wish I had bought more than just a single bottle."
""
""
""
""
"black with a small, tan head that dissipates quickly and doesn't leave much lace. nose is roast, chocolate, maybe some dark fruit and... oatmeal? i usually don't actually detect oatmeal in oatmeal stouts, but here i do for sure. taste is a good balance of all of the above, but just lacks something for me. maybe has too much of something. alcohol presence and oat? body is full. a bit of bitter from the roasty malt. warm booze finish. overall, a decent oatmeal stout, but i think a bit too big for my liking and needing some fine tuning to be very good."
""
"Beer is medium in body and relatively sweet, not cloying though, nice finish, mildly bitter with the roast, a decent beer but probably not a repeat."
""
""
""
"O: a decent effort from Dark Horse, but I would have liked a bit more body and some more pronounced coffee notes. It's an oatmeal stout, so perhaps some more evidence of that is in order too."
"A nice oatmeal stout, brought down by the lack of balance in the taste. The heavy bitter over-roasted malt flavor isn't something I like, and it really drags down what would otherwise be a very impressive beer."
""
""
"Overall: Another nice compliment to the oatmeal stout style. Will be enjoying more of these in the future and hopefully on draft too."
""
""
"One of the darkest beers I have ever poured ... deep black ... but that's where the excitement ends for me. I hardly get any smell, even after burying my nose in the tulip glass. The taste is quite mundane. There is a rather nondescript roasted flavor and slight hop bitterness but that's it."
""
""
"thanks redliner8??"
"I'm a big fan of Dark Horse stouts, and the first in the series (One) is a hit. I'd recommend giving this one a try."
""
""
"Overall - A nice oatmeal stout. Not really remarkable, but solid. I enjoy really roasty stouts like this, but there isn't much that distinguishes it from others in the same category. That said, I wouldn't turn down another."
"Overall I think this is a pretty smokey or roasted and not sweet enough for the style but I did enjoy this. Pick one up if given the chance. Thanks to McNuts for this extra."
"M: Soft, little carbonation bite."

"Pours a dark knight of oil into a pint glass. Lacing is for naught. Head tottaly absent. This beer is dank and dangerous. Taste is rich from the oats and malt profile. Any hops were an afterthought in this beer. It mocks me with a 6"" monolith of darkness in my pint glass. Taste is of wet malt goodness with subdued smoke and a hint of peat and mineral. Slick and wet throughout with amost no carbonation. Overall pretty good and solid."
"Overall I am glad I picked up a second of these and maybe even might go back for a four pack if supplies last. A very solid oatmeal stout."
""
""
"I was a bit underwhelmed by the mouthfeel and drinkability. Body is much thinner than I expected, but I guess the carbonation level is ok. No real bite from the alcohol, even though it's high for the style. Strong bitter finish, far stronger than it needs to be. Not all that pleasant which brings down the drinkability. Too bad, I really thought this beer was going somewhere special until the mouthfeel. Still a good beer from a great brewery in my opinion. But I do feel spoiled when it comes to oatmeal stouts having Ipswich almost always fresh and ready to be consumed. Glad to have finally given it a try though. I'll certainly be going back for more."
"O- I like the beer, but I would have a hard time picking it as an oatmeal stout if I hadn't seen the label. If you like big stouts that aren't quite ""Imperial"" this would definitely be a beer to try."
""
"Poured a 12 oz. Bottle into a pint glass. Poured a very dark brown with a very small toffee/caramel head that dissipates quickly. A decent amout lacing that really stick to the glass. A nose full of malt and oats. A slightly thick to heavy body that has very little carbonation. Very smooth. Nice malt and oat flavor with a faint chocolat taste. Enjoyed this beer very much. Will look for more."
"Dark Horse knows their stouts.."
""
""
"O- an enjoyable Brew! Deffinatley not upset I grabbed a 4pk... Deffinatley could see myself grabbing some more!"
""
"Overall - This is a realy nice and well balanced oatmeal stout. Flavors are pretty nice, would like a little more boldness, but the low carb and creamy mouthfeel nearly make up for this. Let this one warm up a bit and enjoy."
"O - it's good but I don't like the lack of carbonation."
"D - Excellent brew here folks... The nose is sweet, but the flavor is more traditional roasted malts... Excellent appearance and mouthfeel... I could enjoy multiple of these in a sitting if it weren't for the slightly heavy 8.0% ABV... Further evidence that Dark Horse knows how to make an excellent stout..."
""
"O: I like this beer and it certainly stands tall amongst the other oatmeal stouts I've had."
"O/D-Not bad. Tried a single for close to $3 so I wouldn't call this much of a bargain (although singles rarely are). Pretty solid, but not spectacular in any one area. Worth a try but I have had a few of Dark Horse's other Stouts that I enjoyed more than this."
""
""
"o: this stout is a bit disappointing. the smell is there but the taste leaves something to be desired. will pass on this one next time."
""
""
""
"Poured on tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is jet black, with a steady carbonation bubbling along the glass, and a thin, creamy, dense covering of chocolate milk colored head. The beer's nose is mildly sweet, with chocolate and cream notes, and a hint of coffee highlights. Flavors are rich, with a more bitter dark chocolate character in the forefront, balanced with a toasty, almost charred, balancing taste. Coffee grounds make an appearance on the tongue, as well as a subtle hint of hops in the background. The flavors blend together well, but are a bit abrasive overall. Good, smooth body despite the bitter characteristics, with a good lacing left along the glass. The aftertaste is a mix of bitter dark chocolate and day old coffee, with a bitter twinge left on the tongue and in mouth. The finish lingers on quite a bit, although not entirely unpleasant. There is a slight drying in mouth that begs for another drink. Flavor profiles and mouthfeel lean me more towards an Irish Dry stout versus Oatmeal, but a decent brew, regardless."

"O-a decent if not spectacular stout"
"O. A very yummy beer for anyone that likes a nice smooth drink loaded with bitter chocolate flavor."
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Not bad, but definitely packs a more robust malt profile than expected. Smooth and easy drinking, but the weird corn/cardboard flavor gets distracting."

"D - Wow. I don't know how this has such low ratings. This seems like it should be an A+ in my book. A heavy, truthful chocolatey stout. It doesn't get much better than this. Founders Breakfast is the only one in this vein that I've tried that does what this beer is attempting any better. This is a great beer. Will be getting this again. Excellence."
"And not holding this against the beer, but one ugly and seemingly meaningless label."
""
"Overall, it's enjoyable, but I don't think I'll be revisiting this one for a while."
""
"Nothing truly stands out regarding this oatmeal stout but nothing terrible either."
""
""
"O: I think is a good beer. It smells fantastic, but the taste and mouthfeel leave something to be desired. It's not terrible, but I don't think I'll be returning to this beer when I'm in the mood for an oatmeal stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I found this to be quite pleasant."
""
""
"Overall I liked this beer a lot. I didn't detect any oatmeal in the smell but found it more in the taste. I would have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Side note: My bottle has the same configuration as the bottle pictured here but does have some additional graphics added to the label. There is a ""star"" behind the dark horse insignia. Updated version?"
"A good beer but perhaps one dimensional in taste."
""
""
""
"Found some notation on a page reminding me of this beer at a tasting a little while ago. It pays to keep notes. This stuff pours a straight obsidian topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, toasted oats, light coffee, and light chocolate powder. The taste brings in more of the same, with the coffee and roasted malts raising a bit of bitterness for the sake of it. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a generally smooth feel and a kinda dry finish. Overall, a solid oatmeal stout, if a bit on the bitter side for me. Good times."
""
""
"Overall not really that exciting, kind of a one dimensional roast burnt stout with not much depth to it. Very wet too. I would probably pass it up, the brewery has certainly made better."
""
""
""
"Big flavors of dark chocolate, more specifically Hershey's chocolate syrup. Dark roasted coffee notes, possibly espresso. There is also a sugary sweetness to the sip. The finish features a hoppy snap bite, but rather subtle overall."

"O: A decent overall oatmeal stout. Was suprised by the amount of leather and tobacco present. Would like to try this on cask."

"O: All the backbones are there, just the taste is a little off. I really like this series from Dark Horse,"

"Big thanks goes out to my boy aasher for this one! First in the series and first on the day! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured pitch black with a minimal brown head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, cream, and subtle roasted malt. The flavor was of sweet malt, cream, caramel, dark chocolate, subtle roasted malt, and oatmeal. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. The flavor on this one was really quite nice and interesting. I really like how it incorporated a character of dark chocolate and cream in this one to help balance it out. The mouthfeel was probably the best part of this one in my opinion though. It reminded me of a really nice RIS. A definite must try if you get the chance."
"Overall, tasty oatmeal stout that is another good offering from Dark Horse. Maybe a smoother and thicker mouthfeel would amp it up a bit."
"I had this ale on three separate occasions because I was convinced I just was not getting it, you know missing something. Also at different temps ranging from cold from the tap, to room temp. That being said if it’s here I can’t find it. A good experience none the less."
"This is a very drinkable oatmeal stout ale. Alcohol is not detectable. Very good aftertaste which makes the mouthfeel extra fine. Great beer!"
"Nice mouthfeel that you'd expect from an oatmeal stout. Not quite the silkiness I'd hope for. Maybe a little astringent."
"O: the beer isn’t bad… but it might be the worst I’ve had from dark horse. I don’t know if it could be the possible age problem or what but this beer really wasn’t doing it for me."
"O: I really like it for the heavily pronounced oatmeal flavor. Other than that it's ok. I don't hate it or love it. I'd recommend it to someone looking for an oatmeal stout with robust flavor."
"After some of my previous reviews, I'm coming to the realization that Dark Horse stouts may just not be what this jive turkey prefers to spend his scratch on."
"O: This is very tasty stout, creamy and smooth. As usual, a good offering from the guys at Dark Horse."
"Pours an opaque black with a 2 inch super dark khaki head that fades to a thin cap. Thin rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smells of toasted oats, dark malts, cocoa, and slight coffee. Taste is of dark roasted malts/oats, bittersweet chocolate, and coffee, but all very diluted in flavor. Mild roast/burnt/bitter/astringent taste lingers on the palate after each sip. This is pretty thin and slightly watery for being an oatmeal stout. Decent carbonation but the mouthfeel is off. Overall, this is a pretty good oatmeal stout and would be much better if the mouthfeel were tweaked a bit."
"O: Decent oatmeal stout and one I would drink again if I was offered one. Glad I got to try this brew."
"O: Pretty standard oatmeal stout IMO. That being said, I would drink it again. I think if they increased the hops on this they would have a pretty solid ABA."
"Skal!"
"Overall I thought this was a pretty good Oatmeal Stout. A lot of Oatmeal Stouts tend to be lighter and more sessionable, but this was was heavier, roasty and robust, I liked that because theres a lot more lighter oatmeal stouts on the market so it's nice when a brewery uses the Oatmeal stout base for a bigger beer. This beer was pretty on point with only a couple minor tweaks this could be one of the best Oatmeal Stouts on the market. In terms of the stout series I thought the Tres was the best with too and one tying for second and fore being the one I liked the least, overall Dark Horse did a pretty good job with this series, now I have to try and track down Plead the fith, you would think that living in Michigan it would be easy to find, but it isn't. I could see keeping this around in the fridge but I think I liked Short's Mystery Stout a little more. If you are stout lover then this beer is for you. This was another good stout from Dark Horse and part of the best stout series around."
"D - Drinkability is moderately low. This beer looks good in the glass, but it's downhill from there. Mundane flavors that bring out a bit too much roast and not enough tantalizing qualities to keep me coming back for more."
"O - its an alright beer. It was just a little bland."
"Poured into imperial pint glass. Color was a completely opaque black with a thin light mocha brown head. Aroma was ok. Slightly fake smokey, with a tad of alcohol aroma. A bit of burnt brown sugar as well. Taste started off as smokey burnt coffee. Progressed into an acidic bitter. Felt ok in the mouth, coated decently, and was nicely carbonated. Overall was just ok, not a good example of the style."
"Mouthfeel is as smooth and velvety as I've ever had in a beer without it being too viscous. This beer just flows effortlessly. It's perfectly bodied, as it never feels close to watery but never feels too thick either. The acidity offers good contrast and the finish is softly bitter. Drinkability great for all those reasons along with the clean and crisp oatmeal flavor. Love this beer, it's an oatmeal stout done right."
"O: This whole series of stouts has been pretty solid. I enjoyed this one."
"D: This was a good but not great oatmeal stout. Would have like a bigger oat flavor. Also some sweetness to balance things out some. Guess I would drink again if it was available"
"These guys just can't seem to make a bad stout. Poured almost still and almost black, I saw a little bit of head in others glasses though so I guess we'll say it can have a small head. Aroma is bacon like and smoky but still roasty. This one packs in some nice coffee flavors with a deep roasted malt and some burnt toast character, just slightly fruity with some raisin and dark fruit character. Very good."
"based on the other offerings from this brewery, I was a bit disapointed. As their stouts go, this doesn't stand up to the Special Reserve Black Bier."
"This beer pours an opaque black color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of roasted malt, graham cracker, and a hint of chocolate. The taste is similar to the aroma. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with a velvety texture, and low carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer. I would, however, choose any of Dark Horse's other stouts over this any day."
"D: I don't want to drink very much of this one. The flavors are decent but I'm just not digging it."
"D - This is a damn fine beverage. I'll put it up there with Sam Smith's."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Very smooth for an oatmeal stout. Absolutely delicious the entire way through. The alcohol is present, but subtly delicious. I think I prefer this over the Dark Horse Tres Blueberry stout."
"Poured with one fat finger of tan head. Subtle smells of malts and chocolate. Initial tastes of bitter sweet chocolate that transitions nicely to malty creaminess. This beer is well balanced and has no hint of heat. I would love to try this again, especially on tap, but wouldn't move mountains to get it again. Overall solid representation of a refined Oatmeal Stout. Well done Dark Horse!"
"Drinkability: This one is a bit too bitter and dry for an oatmeal stout. It is not a bad beer, but there are better examples in the style. While Too and Tres were amazing, One is moreso just middle of the pack. Would not pass this one up if given, would not seek it out again either."
"Drinkability -- Lots of interesting things going on in the flavor, but the feel leaves some to the imagination. I tend to associate oatmeal stouts with great mouthfeel and this didn't make the grade. Still good, though."
"Pours Black with dark brown edges and thin tan head. The aroma is roasty, mildly burnt, oatmeal sweetness, black licorice, some vanilla and some chocolate. The taste is rich, smooth and tasty. I get roasty and Smoke. I also get chocolate smoothness, coffee and sweet caramel. Wow, everything comes together nicely. Very very tasty brew."
"d - A nice oatmeal stout. I liked the smell a lot, and the taste was fine, but seemed a little watered down. Would have again."
"One is an easy-drinking, perfectly serviceable rendition of the style. All the better that it starts to gel as it warms up."
"D - This one is highly drinkable. I'd recommend it to anyone who is a fan of stouts and oatmeal stouts."
"D: On a positive note, the beer is very drinkable. It goes down easier than expected, especially with 8%. I wouldn't down one of these, though- it's meant to be savoured."
"Another nice beer from Dark Horse. One of these would suit me just fine. The roast really is big and doesn't really leave room to want to consume another. A fine, fine stout though and worth picking up."
"This beer poured a midnight black with a beautiful dark khaki one finger head which quickly dissipated to lace the glass. It smells of very sweet milk chocolate and has decent roasted notes. The coffee is pretty subdued and it also has almost a vanilla accent. The flavor is pretty solid. It's slightly smoky and has a little oak to it. It definitely has a lot of dark roasted malt and has a solid bitter chocolate flavor that follows into the aftertaste. It's pretty solid but the more you drink it you get this sweet/sour lactic acid flavor that kind of gets a little old. It drinks pretty smoothly and is in between medium to heavy in body. The alcohol is barely noticeable. The first time I had this I never knew it was 8%. I would've guessed between 5-6%. It's a very solid beer. I'm not a huge fan of Dark Horse but this one is better than I remember it."
"D: Very easy drinking COS - another good offering from Dark Horse."
"So Dark Horse does it again. Another good one that you can really enjoy."
"Good flavor in this stout but I felt the drinkability was a tad rough. This was hard for me to finish."
"D- a very nice oatmeal stout for sure. I've like this whole line from them this one is good but some of the other have been better. That doesn't stop this from being enjoyable and true to style."
"Pours a deep pitch black with a thin russet brown head with a fair amount of lacing. Smells of coffee and malts. Tastes of coffee with undertones of chocolate and toffee. Mouthfeel is medium and there is very little carbonation. Drinkability is fairly high on this one."
"Mouthfeel is really smooth, yet there are some small but furious bubbles that emerge on the back of the tongue on the way down. Very very drinkable, another overall success from dh."
"Not bad, but nothing special."
"I've had this one before and will have to go through my old notes to see, not sure if its on BA yet for me. I don't remember it tasting this roasty coffee goodness. Decent brew that I wouldn't mind drinking again."
"D: Goes down pretty easily, somewhat tasty, nice kick, ok representation of style. This isn't a bad beer by any means, though I think that I would opt for others of the style if given an option."
"D - I could drink a few of these."
"Wow, what an amazing oatmeal stout! Dirty roasted, earthen tastes, perfect oat smoothness and chewiness. Almost no hops explicitly present, just tons and tons of hearty roasted malts. Delicious, fantastic beer."
"D - There is a little lingering bitter from the expresso, so for me it'd be something I'd pair a dessert or something with. I love the dark horse stout series, but I think this one might fall in bottom of the 5 for me."
"Drinkability: Not as smooth or complex as expected for an Oatmeal Stout of this abv. Pretty good, but not a stand-out."
"Pours a black color, nice carbonation, little fizzy dark tan head, with some very nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is big on malts, with some very nice chocolate/toffee/caramel notes, with some licorice thrown in. The taste is malty, sweet, lots of dark stuff. Medium body, with a nice slightly dry/bitter finish. Drinkable, this is a very nice Oatmeal Stout, one of the best I've had."
"highly drinkable."
"Overall it is not my favorite from the Dark Horse stout lineup, that would be Plead the 5th, but this is yet another solid offering."
"This beer pours a DARKNESS...Imprisoning me, all that I see, absolute horror...sorry I couldn't resist, how many dark beers are named One. Well, as I was saying the body is black with a thick brown head that looks damn sexy if only it laced better it was almost a 5 in my book. The smell is not too strong, but I detected cocoa, oats, and some vanilla. The taste had a bold cocoa and oat taste combined with a strong coffee/roasted flavor. There was also a bit of whiskey in the background. The carbonation is alright on the palate, but it was just a bit too watery for my liking. This was still a highly drinkable beer and got even better as it warmed up a bit and became smooth. This is definitely one of my favorite oatmeal stouts."
"D - A very tasty brew and a welcomed seasonal from a brewery that seems to do no wrong in my book! So what if it's more of an 'imperial' style, this is way too tasty to pass up."
"This is a miss from Dark Horse. I usually love their beers, but not one that I am going to come back to any time soon. To much acrid, burnt, and astringent flavors going on. Not the worst thing ever, but nothing I would really recommend."
"Where's the oatmeal? This is closer to a Double Stout. It's kind of a mess."
"Drinkability is good, perhaps too good for a beer of this strength. Definitely worth the try!"
"D - warms the mouth and the body. a fine oatmeal stout with a ton of flavor and personality. fitting for this brewery and the stout series. i can picture myself (and many others) sitting at the brewpub, sucking these down en masse on a cold Michigan night."
"The beer is well carbonated for the style, has a nice full body and hides the alcohol well. The flavor isn't outstanding, but it is good, and the beer has a nice dry finish. This is a good stout, not a great one, I will buy it again depending on the price."
"DB- Very nice use of roast malt and oatmeal. A drinkable stout that goes down smooth. I can't even believe it is 8%, it drink's like 5-6."
"A good oatmeal stout. One of the better one's I have had lately."
"It hits all the right notes, and improves on most of the ones your average oatmeal stout falls on."
"A really schizophrenic beer: I liked everything but the taste. Too roasty for me, a little abrasive. I kept waiting for it to warm up & the malts to gain some steam, but that dark, burnt character still dominated."
"Pours jet black with a light brown head. In the aroma, sweet oatmeal, roast and coffee notes. In the taste, roast malt and coffee, and nice sweet oatmeal, and a some heat from the alcohol. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry coffee and just a hint of caramel in the aftertaste. Easy to drink and nice dry to sweet complexity."
"D: I'm not sure if this beer is actually 8% alcohol, but it definitely drinks like 4%. Very nice for the style, but the body could be a little bit lighter."
"Go Lers!"
"drinks pretty well. not terribly complex, but tasty and with the 8% ABV well integrated. not one I would go out of my way for, but one I wouldn't turn down either."
"Drinkability is somewhat meh, with some boozy flavors, that briny salty taste, the coffee grinds and acidic flavors, and overall heaviness. The only thing helping it is the smooth oatmeal feel. This beer is much bigger than it should be for an oatmeal stout, and closer to a RIS. Way too much roasted and chocolate malts. The bit of smoke is nice, but there are too many other flavors pounded into this one beer."
"The best beer I've had yet from this brewery."
"This is a pretty decent stout with some nice robust flavors, but I was really let down by the mouthfeel. I like my oatmeal stouts to be silky smooth. If you are looking for a rich and robust stout, this one will definitely have you covered."
"D- Not a great flavor, it's fine. Did not enjoy drinking and would not purchase again."
"Drinkability is not great with the combination of the intense roastiness and the carbonation."
"Drinks fairly easy, but the ABV does assert itself a bit. I could still pound a 4 pack on a winter's night with some fudge or brownies no problem!"
"Drinkable? I want another. NOW...dammit !"
"D - This is quite drinkable for a stout. I like how they come in 12oz bottles. If only I could only get them by me."
"The mouthfeel is on the thicker side and somewhat creamy. Carbonation is moderate to below average. Excellent mouthfeel for my taste. Drinkability is good, it was a very taste and enjoyable beer."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. Maybe my favorite in the series. Recommended for sure!"
"D- Not bad. Still a decent stout, but not as much flavor as some other stouts I've had. I'd still drink a couple of these on a chillier night!"
"Quite a nice relaxing brew, I recommend trying this one if you see it. Another winner from this brewery!"
"I'm becoming more and more impressed by Dark Horse's Stout offerings."
"D - Not too bad for an 8% beer. I don't think I could do more than one or two in a sitting however."
"D: Definitely worth a try, especially if you like your stouts chocolatey."
"Drinkability is relatively low for the style - it really drinks like a much fatter beer than the 8% suggests."
"Thanks to walt for sharing this bottle. The beer pours a black color with a tiny brown head that quickly dissipates. The aroma is chocolate with some soy and alcohol. The flavor is chocolate, tobacco and leather. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D - Despite the high ABV and the basic nature of this type of beer, this one is very drinkable."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is watery and thin. The weak mouthfeel makes this a very easy drinking beer. But there are many better oatmeal stouts."
"All in all this is a more than solid oatmeal stout and a beer I would certainly try again."
"Amazing drinkability (for lack of a better adjective) for a hefty stout such as this. This is a great brew. Great stout flavor with a complexity that rolls from one end of your tongue to the other. Well-balanced with prominent roastiness and coffee flavors. Very nice stout with a nice little kick. I would definitely drink this again, if I can find it. They've got a winner here, in my books."
"a nice enough beer."
"Summary: A bit disappointed with this one."
"Not bad. Some more sweetness would have been welcome to help balance out all of that dark biterness but the oatmeal saved the day in the end, helping keep this smooth on the palate."
"Dark Horse always has great ideas with their stouts, but I wish they would have taken a little more time or care with their products. Better ingredients or more time to refine these beers is really all they need. Until then, it's fun while it lasts, but never again."
"D-This was a fairly good beer, but I personally expect more richness in a stout. Maybe I'm just spoiled."
"A decent oatmeal stout overall, but not quite as good as I was hoping it would be. Drinkable at least."
"D- Very drinkable beer. Dark Horse has this problem with making great beers all the time. I have yet to have something from them that I didn't like. Nice stout that I could drink a entire 4 pack of no problem."
"Na Zdravje!"
"d: Definitely an enjoyable stout, glad I tried this one."
"D: A good stout that losses its oatmeal persona rather quickly. I like the fullness of the finish."
"D - Without being too roasted and bitter, One is a smooth, delicious treat that's a good drinking Oatmeal Stout. The nose could use some bringing up though. I'm even more excited to have the Tres now!"
"D - A fairly good stout, not the best oatmeal stout I have had, but I found it fairly easy to drink for the strength and would just prefer more balance with sweet and roasted elements"
"Also, I just won $4 on a Lotto scratch off, awesome."
"Ho boy, this is one tasty beer. Poured with smallish burnt sugar colored head that mostly subsided and no lace. Color is an opaque brownish black. Aroma is very rich, roasty, malty, sweet, cocoa, hint of coffee, hints of vanilla, caramel, burnt sugar, and toffee. Flavor's about the same also with nut skins, Good body and carbonation. Finish is like flavor and fairly long. Just a hint of alcohol at the end. Very nice beer. Could be a session for slow drinking. Would go great with very rich powerful foods like game, dark meat fowl, and spicey sausages."
"D - This felt more like a flimsy RIS without the aggressive bitterness on the palate. However, this bottle had a bit of age under its belt (about a year and a half or so). I look forward to trying Too, Tres and Fore in the near future."
"OVERALL: This one was a bit of a let-down. Not quite what an imperial oatmeal stout could be, and the look and feel were just not up to scratch for a stout of its size. A little more boldness in the nose and taste would help too. A relatively sweet Imperial Stout, though the sweet milk sugar notes were probably the most interesting aspect of the beer. Re-name this an Imperial Milk Stout and beef up the palate, then you'd have something perhaps. For now, I'll pass on this one."
"Future outlook: Old bottle? Perhaps...though, even if, I'd hope an 8% stout would hold up a bit more pleasantly."
"I've had this a few times before. Its good, but there is something missing... maybe its the heavy carbonation. 8% is pretty high ABV for this type of stout. It doesn't seem that high though. I would probably get this again as it is my second 4 pack of this stuff I have bought this winter."
"Overall, this is a decent stout, but nothing outstanding. Worth giving it a taste, for sure."
"Notes: This is a really satisfying Oatmeal Stout crafted by the masters at Dark Horse, one of my favorite breweries. It has the presence of beers that get a LOT more attention here on BA."
"D: Descent Dark Horse offering, but there is something about this beer that lacks serious complexity and the finish is a little rough."
"Like all oatmeal stouts, the body on this is creamy and smooth. Carbonation level is hidden well as this is just a velvety beer. Alcohol presence gives a good bit of body on top. Good mellow flavors come out with oats, chocolate, and dark bitter coffee aftertaste. This is a good stout right here. It's a little on the heavy side, so I wouldn't have many at a time, but it's a good treat when I do."
"D- I can feel all 8% even after half of a glass. Not a sipper, but a bit too cloying and fruity to want more than one."
"D= Very drinkable, but the weak point is definitely the finish and aftertaste. Still, it was tasty enough for me to have two in a sitting without complaint."
"Next review!"
"One is kind of smooth and somewhat milky. The body is medium and could use a boost as a bit of a watery feel is on the end. Carbonation is very low and kind of makes this stout a bit dead in the water. The chocolate is what stays with me the most. I'm glad I bought one bottle as I did not want another one afterwards. The alcohol is a bit high but it's not that, it's just that I need more oats. This is good for a whirl though."
"Pours pitch black completely opaque body does not let any visible light pass through, nice deep mocha tan head leaves speckled lacing behind all of their beers so far have had a peculiar sort of fizzy carbonation when you first pour the beer. However, when you go to sip it the excess carbonation doesn't come through on the palate. Aromatics offer up deep fruit notes amongst the dark roasts with a creamy cereal grain breakfast brew approach from the oatmeal additions. Some coffee and dark chocolate from the darker roasts with a layer of caramel/toffee flowing, minimal hops going on here. The fruit tone has some deep plum mild tartness and a noticeable alcohol nose not much going on in the way of hops maybe some faint herbal additions. Flavors meld nicely the soft oatmeal with the dark bitter roasts and fruit tone background. A bit of coffee and the dark chocolate but the toffee burnt caramelized sugar note really shines through, ample herbal hop bitterness and alcohol burn from the 8% abv. Mouthfeel a bit of ticklin' from the carbonation but overall a fuller bodied offering with the oatmeal additions keeping it soft and velvety on the palate bitter dark roasts and a touch of alcohol burn stay on the palate with each sip. Drinkability overall is solid a beer that inspires me to want to search out Too, Tres, and Fore from the same series of stouts. It's true I love dark beer from the state of Michigan this one is no different go try some."
"A very nice Oatmeal Stout from Dark Horse. Not the best one I have had, but very good and well worth seeking out. This quality beer only makes me even more pumped to try the other four beers in the series. Next up is their Sweet/Milk Stout."
"Overall, another solid stout from Dark Horse. I've now had 1 and 5 (one and fifth), so I need to see out 2, 3 and 4 (too, tres and fore). I liked Pleading the fifth a little more, but this is still a great beer."
"All in all, this is a decent oatmeal stout if you like it a little heavy with some good boozy flavors."
"The first thing I noticed was the nice smell of sweet milk chocolate emanting from the fresh pour. Had a definite taste combination of roasted oatmeal and coffee with slight lingering hints of chocolate. Warms you like a good winter warmer but without the abundant presence of alcohol taste. A robust beer that lingers nicely on the palate but is surprisingly smooth going down. Very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability is great. Bought another 4, great beer!"
"Opaque black color with a dark tan/mocha head. Starts off looking very pretty, but quickly recedes to a ring with little lacing. Strong aroma of roast malt, toasted grain, mild chocolate and burnt coffee. All malt in the aroma, no hoppiness. Smooth and silky medium full bodied with minimal carbonation resulting in a lingering aftertaste of burnt malt and sweet chocolate. Flavor is supported by strong roasted malt presence and a balance of burnt coffee and sweet chocolate. Oats provide a light grain texture, but not as strong as expected for the style. Overall sweetness is mild and there is no hop presence. The 8% alcohol makes a fleeting appearance in the finish. Maybe not the best Oatmeal Stout, but in general fits nicely with this series of stouts from Dark Horse, Tres is still my favorite though."
"D - This is a decent beer that could be quite good with a little less alcohol present on the palate. Otherwise, very nice."
"Drinkability- Warms you up but is a bit of a let down in flavour. The first handful of sips were interesting and but by the time I reached the end of the bottle the flavour had gotten a bit boring"
"G- Good flavor and an easy drinker. I'd put it up there with my favorites in the category, The Poet being one of them. WHile not as smooth as some others, the flavor profile is just great. I'd definitely drink it again if the opportunity presents itself."
"One is another fine beer in the stout series. Let there be no doubt, this is very good beer. I can't help but think of how good this would be with a bitter hop kick. That missing element would drive this beer to the next level. Even though it's not here, it's still very good. I'll enjoy every last drop. If you haven't checked out this series, you should. I still need to find a bottle of Tres to complete the lineup. But, I'm extremely impressed thus far. Thank you, Dark Horse, for finding your way into Ohio. We're incredibly happy to have you!"
"This beer poured an almost black color and formed a nice solid foamy dark tan head that coated the glass with lace as it slowly subsided. An aroma of malt, coffee, cocoa and a hint of anise. The flavor was of malt, chocolate, and a hint of coffee. The body is medium light, with a bit of richness to it. The finish is slightly bitter. Not a bad stout."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch brown head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, oatmeal and a bit of coffee and a smoky aroma. However, the aroma is mostly sweet. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like bittersweet chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, charred/burnt malt and some oatmeal. The taste is a lot more bitter than I expected it to be, at least compared to the aroma, anyway. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's rich, creamy and well carbonated. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and easy to drink. Alcohol does hit you after drinking it, but you can't tell it's 8% ABV in the taste at all. Overall I think this is a good brew, I liked it and would buy it again."
"Thanks Dark Horse. Anxiously awaiting the arrival of Too through Plead the 5th in the up coming months."
"One of the best oatmeals I've had the pleasure to try."
"Drinkability: I would have this again and recommend this to those who enjoy a stout with a mild open and smooth enjoyable bitter finish."
"D: Highly drinkable and enjoyable. This is kinda like Sam Smith's oatmeal stout with a creamier and fuller mouthfeel."
"I loved this beer."
"Overall this is the best oatmeal stout I've had; great aftertaste, and I immediately wanted another bottle after I finished this beer."
"Tall two finger choco-latte head, thick and foamy. One is opaque, black ink, motor oil black. Thick sheets of lace. Beautiful looking stout. Smell is chocolate biscotti, wafer, tiramisu, chocolate milk. Tastes wonderful, rich, full body, vanilla bean impressions with chocolate, roast, chocolate milk, esspresso. There is a coffee bean astringency in the mix but not out of proportion. Creamy, layered mouthfeel, again more hop astingency, nicey balanced and tasty. Overall, this is quite possibly my favourite of the first four Dark Horse offerings I've had the pleasure of sampling. Heartily recommended!"
"Pours a very beautiful black color. I mean, really black, even the thinnest part of the pour is as dark as some completely poured stouts. However, the head is kind of thin, very thin actually, and dissipates in about 10 seconds. The color has it, but the head does not. The smell is full of roasted malts and sweetness. A bit of that oily sweetness that oats seem to lend. There's a bit of a toasty bread, caramel body in there, but the roasted malts win. The taste comes out with chocolate and incredible dense, grainy, husky, oatmeal sweetness. The sweetness though, isn't very sugary, it's just like heavy burnt syrup. You get to this deep roastiness next, not exactly full of coffee, probably because of the burnt toast kind of hides it, but it comes through nicely. The taste surpasses most oatmeal stouts, but I think I can see some room for improvement - the raw graininess is interesting, but it does too much to hide the roasted flavors. The body is s o incredibly full I can hardly swallow it. I like some body, so that isn't too bad, but the carbonation just stings, which is kind of strange. I'd say that the mouthfeel isn't too impressive. The drinkability is pretty good though. The ABV is pretty high (you don't exactly notice it in the taste), but I actually find myself enjoying this. It's definitely interesting and worth a try. I can actually imagine buying this again."
"Smooth, full, creamy feel. Slides over the tongue with little carbonation. The texture is as thick as it looks. Taste is a little subtler than expected, but this beer does not disappoint. This is one big oatmeal stout! A perfect offering to try on a cold rainy day!"
"D: I love that Dark Horse does their 5 stout series as I am a big fan of the styles, I personally like the plead the 5th the most. This one is a solid beer, but I was wishing for a little more balance. The sweetness effectivley masks the high alcohol content. Definitely worth a try every now and then considering how affordable it is, but nothing earth shattering here."
"Poured a dark brown, almost black with a modest tan head that quickly faded to a collar. The aroma of dark chocolate. The taste chocolate first, then coffee. Feel is full bodied and oily, with enough carbonation to give the tongue a workout. Drinkability was OK for a heavy, 8.00 ABV beer."
"[1x-BOT;tap1x]"
"Drinkability: With well-hidden alcohol, this beer is a first rate oatmeal stout that verges on the double stout category"
"Bottle. Pours an inky black with hardly any head. Aroma of rich roasted malt, bitter chocolate, molasses, toffee, graham crackers, and booze. Flavor is sweet initially with oatmeal, graham crackers and roasted malt in the finish. Nice, robust palate. Seems a bit strong to be classified as a stout rather than an imperial stout but oh well. Very nice."
"RBSG09 bottle at the grand tasting. Pours black with a huge fluffy brown head. Aroma is coppery; smells like a penny tastes. Underneath that there are notes of roasted malts and dark chocolate. Flavor is dark chocolate with a fat roasted character. A little astringent. Definitely the weakest of the DH seasonal stout series."
"D - This is one of my favorite Oatmeal Stouts, great balance and body that makes me wish I had a lot more of these great beers"
"(D)- Despite how lighter in body it is, it is still a sipper beer. There are nice complexities that deserve attention with each taste"
"This beer is decent, but it's probably my least favorite of the stout series. I'd buy it again maybe next year when they come out again, but it isn't something I'm going to spend any effort considerable effort seeking out."
"Taste is quite smooth and mollow, a present degree of malt is present, followed by a hoppy bitter taste with hints of roasted coffee, vanilla and shy alcohol presence. Vanilla and cherry flavours are present and tickle the tongue."
"D: Quite tasty, filling, warming. Without knowing the ABV, this 'feels' like +6%, and as such would be a beer to respect before getting too carried away. A 12 oz. bottle seems just right...would gladly have this again!"
"overall a nice oatmeal stout...not the best but far from the worst that ive had...glad i got to try it..."
"Despite how I sound kind of negative about this, I find it to be pretty drinkable. If it were on my local store shelves, I'd buy it. I've seen a couple of reviews stating that it's got 8.0%ABV. If this is true, it's beautifully hidden. I'd have guessed it in 5% and below range."
"Very drinkiable brew, with plenty going on inside. Why can't you get this stuff in Massachusets??"
"Barely produced any head, but the head that there is is a nice brown color. Body is of course black, as one would expect. The smell is like molasses and chocolate. Very dessert-like. More roasted flavor than I was expecting."
"A dark black color pour with a medium,lasting coco colored head. Aroma of chocolate,smoke,burnt malt,and coffee. Flavor is rich malty and sweet,chocolate,coffee,dark fruit,tobacco and a light bitterness that seems to be more from the chocolate and coffee than hops. Full body with a creamy mouthfeel,and a espresso type lingering finish. Very very good stout, Dark Horse makes some damn fine stout !"
"Pours unspectacular but still attractive dark, with minimal head that disappears quickly. One whiff and you can already smell the oatmeal in it, which comes over pretty sweetly. Taste is definitely good, with a strong prevalence of oatmeal and hints of licorice and dark coffee. Has decent, smooth mouthfeel, but nothing spectacular. An incredibly drinkable beer, of which I wish I had many more of."
"12oz. Poured black with no transparency. Zero head to speak of initially until I poured from almost a foot above the glass. 2 inch head eventually appeared following the pour - chocolate in color, actually not bad considering I wasn't expecting anything, but it did eventually rise up, but leaves minimal lacing on the glass. Aromas are of dark roasted malts, with hints of alcohol, coffee, and cocoa. Mouth-feel is silky smooth and gets smoother as the ale warms. Tastes are simple - roasted malts, somewhat oaty, faint alcohol (which is well concealed given the 8% ABV), coffee, and chocolate. Finish is dry, but not overly. It appears I enjoyed this more than most according to its overall score. As I was drinking it, I was thinking it might be one of the better oatmeal stouts I've had to date."
"This one actually finishes much better than it starts. Pours from the bottle to a jet balck-used motor oil color, with very little head from the outset and no lacing. Likewise, the nose is very faint and almost indistinguishable, but things get better from here. Mouthfeel is full and sweet, and the taste is a pleasant blend of chocolate, vanilla and toffee. 8% alcohol is very subtly pleasant in the taste as well, and this all blends to a finish that is long and just sweet enough."
"D: Definitely drinkable, especially for the style. The lighter body makes for a beer you can definitely have more than one of at each sitting. I'm becoming more and more impressed with Dark Horse brews. This is yet another I'll have to plan on picking up a four-pack of."
"D- Not sure on the ABV on this but I'd guess 6%. Quite a nice drinkable and semi-complex Oatmeal stout."
"Smooth, but better carbonation could have really knocked this one into a higher category. Has the consistency of flat soda."
"Delicious."
"This is a standout brew."
"Dark Horse One Oatmeal Stout Ale poured a dark brown, almost black, with a full brown head, thick looking. The smell was of dark roasted malt and a hint of hops. Taste was slightly sweet and hints of hops. Roasted Coffee. Mouthfeel was good, thick. Drinkability was ok, seemed a bit filling. Overall this was a decent Oatmeal stout. Seemed a thicker less sweet version of the style."
"Medium-full bodied with a somewhat thin mouthfeel and decent carbonation."
"This is not a knock-the-socks-off stout, but One is really good, solid, and delicious. I'd like it to be a little more brash, but it's difficult to complain when it's tasty, smooth, and original. Very good stuff yet again from Dark Horse, a go-to brewery."
"Pours a solid black color which lets no light pass. Vigorous pour could barely muster up any head at all. Smells vinous, a bit of dark fruit and roasted malts. Taste is of roasted malts, chocolate and a lingering coffee in the finish. Finish is a bit dry. Creamy smooth mouthfeel, medium body, low but ample carbonation. Great tasting brew, very creamy. I thought it finished a bit dry for my taste, but good just the same. Someone send me a fresh one please :)"
"Notes: similar to The Poet by New Holland in most respects with a slightly smoother aroma and taste"
"Overall, very drinkable, very good, and just a delicious beer. I would be happy to drink more than a few of these just about anytime, but especially on these cold, Wisconsin nights. Cheers!"
"Got a four pack of these to split with a buddy one morning (oatmeal's legit, right?). A solid beer sure. Appearance was mediocre - small head that dissipated to absolutely nothing over a deep brown brew. Not a hint of lacing. Nose and flavor were solid - sweet chocolate, a touch of caramel, and then a heavy dose of roasted malt and coffee. Body was solid, medium to thick and appropriate for the style. Overall, another nice one from Dark Horse, definitely still one of the better MI breweries."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my Lancaster shaker glass. Appears a dark brown color with about a finger of caramel colored foam. The foam quickly dissipates to a thin layer. Smells of roasted grains, and faintly of sweet caramel. Tastes of bitter cocoa powder and rich dark roasted malts. Creamy body with medium carbonation. Finish is dry and bitter. Worth picking up if you see it."
"D - This is a pretty good oatmeal stout. Another solid offering from Dark Horse."
"D-Strong drinkability. Enjoyable throughout, smooth and tasty. Although not perfectly, it fits nicely into the oatmeal stout style. Left me satisfied and wanting to try more from Dark Horse, including perhaps another bottle of this."
"Very nice overall. Smooth, balanced, creamy stout. Well done. Looking forward to trying the others in the series."
"Full bodied, silky-smooth and creamy. Alcohol only shows as a welcome warmth. Goes down easy and is finished too soon. A delicious oatmeal stout for morning, noon, or night."
"Of the two Oatmeal Stouts I have tried so far, I enjoyed the Poet more."
"Nice opaque pour with an off whitish head. roasted aroma from a nice tan head. Good roasted malt, just a hint of dark chocolate. Dark Horse likes to hop their brews, this has a hint of that, not too much though. Very good representation of the style. Worth trying along with their other number brews."
"Full bodied. Creamy texture with a nice warmth to it. This is a nice morning sipper, if you're into that sort of thing. Good beer Dark Horse. Thanks, Tristan!"
"Just a quick, dark brown foam of head after great pour. The perfect pitch black color though. Very interesting smell of oatey peanut butter. Plus some savory, dark rasted coffee and a small wedge of baker's chocolate. Faint chesnuts in a delicious french roasted coffee. Just the way I like it too....black. Then the dry powdered, dark chocolate slowly makes itself known. But only in the most subtle of ways. Smooth, oily slick, yet also dry palate. The thick roasted malt flavors just coats the tongue."
"A solid all around stout. It has the great flavors associated with a good dark beer and they are nicely balanced. Very enjoyable drink that I am thankful for having after a wonderful thanksgiving dinner. What a treat."
"D - Not really as good as many of these guys other beers. Not really one to seak out, but drinkable..."
"Very full bodied in it's silky texture with a whole lotta flavor in the mix. A robust toasted malt is the first thing noticed with a bitter dark chocolate flavor backing it up. The oatmeal sweetness surfaces next not muting the bite of the bitters but balancing them just right. The finish is warm with very laid back/almost hidden hop presence which is a good thing in such brews because it let's the oatmeal and malt characteristics do what they're suppose to do instead of getting stepped all over in the end."
"D: I'm really enjoying this. DH do know to make a good stout! And paired with chocolate cake, this really is a treat."
"D- Easy to drink and overall pretty solid. Worth a try for sure."
"It pours a dark black with a small creamy brown that quickly recedes and moves to the edges. Decent lacing on the glass. This is odd but there is almost no smell, maybe some roasted malts but there is almost nothing there. The flavor makes up for what the smell is missing. There is a nice bite to it and it's just right for the cold day I was drinking it on. It was served very cold but warms you up great. It is sweet but more of a roasted sweet than chocolate sweet. The 8% abv is there but is well masked by the flavors of vanilla and coffee. The flavors just dance in you mouth and the finish just leaves you wanting more. By the look of this beer you would think it would be a sipper but it's surprisingly drinkable. I was waiting for a take away order and this was pretty much gone after 10 - 15 mins."
"D- Slow drinker but good very nice overall."
"Leaves me wanting more of it. Great representation of an oatmeal stout."
"D- not dark horse's best offering, but certainly not a bad beer. one is enough, and i probably wont pick any more of these up. cant tell that this one is 8%ABV"
"Drinkability- Overall this is a damn tasty Oatmeal Stout. I love how they let the malt do the talking and would actually be surprised if a hop touched this beer. Also, if I didn't know better, I'd swear that chocolate nips or something of the sort was in this brew. Good stuff."
"M - Medium to a little thin. Lightly carbonated."
"This beer pours dark black with an off white head that quickly disappears and leaves some decent lacing on the glass. Smells of bitter chocolate and dark malts. The mouthfeel is creamy but a little thin, not as much body as I would like. Tastes of burnt malts, chocolate and molasses. Drinkability is not great, It wasn't difficult to drink one but it didn't leave me wanting another."
"Easy to drink. I don't find there to be anything offensive about any one particular part of this brew. While I did enjoy this, it isn't my favorite oatmeal stout. Body seem more porter like than stoutish. Would not turn this one down, would buy a single again, just not the top of my list."
"Overall, a decent brew but I wouldn't consider this to be particularly drinkable."
"Pours a very dark brown almost black in color. There is a very short lived frothy head on the pour. But alas, it is gone before I get to my chair. Smell is slight coffee, some deep black malt and a good amount of dark chocolate. This smells very promising. You get a bit more of the roasted coffee in the flavor, but it's not dominant or obtrusive. There's just enough dark chocolate to balance it out. Mouthfeel is pretty decent and fairly smooth. There is a bit of bitterness from the roasted barley, coffee. A very solid, good offering from Dark Horse."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The mouthfeel is fairly full. A bit of creamyness is noted to the moughfeel. The flavors linger in my mouth for a long time. This is dam near perfect. The only negative thing about this beer was I drank it too fast."
"Pours oil slick black out of the bottle with a small dense mocha head that lingered for a while as a cap and then left a ring with a little lacing. Aroma is burnt malts with espresso and licorice. There is also a bit of sweetness in the smell as it warms with milk chocolate and vanilla. The taste is also big of the roasted/burnt malt character. The first taste is a sweet chocolate and vanilla blast which gives way to coffee and roasted malts. The sweetness of the malts lingers through the finish with a slight coffee bitterness. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a little carbonation which just coats the mouth with the massive malt flavors. This is a good, if fairly one-dimensional (roasty) stout and I look forward to the rest of the stout series."
"pours super dark brown (almost black) with a big chocolatey head. the nose is chocolate, deep dark malts, subtle sweet vanilla. the taste is chocolate, deap roasty malts, some wood, subtle sweet vanilla. full bodied, medium carbo. very delicious and complex beer!"
"Prosit, und Zum Wohl, MK"
"Oddly enough to me, the mouthfeel of this beer was very Iight with a semi-dry finish. This is my favorite offering from Dark Horse so far (I found the other couple I tried either watered down or unbalanced). Nice work on this one, I wasn't blown away, but I'd have it again."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and a bit milky."
"Pours black and thick from the bottle, slight mocha head rises and fades, leaves a few rogue patches of lacing. Smell is roasted coffee beans, some nice dark chocolate aroma, maybe a trace of cookie dough. Taste sweet, some dark fruitiness, plenty of burnt coffee, some milk chocolate. Pretty active little bubbles, with a slightly drying effect. Overall, a tasty brew."
"had with stumac and melanie ... second session ... quite smokey and a bit meaty, bold for a oatmeal/sweet stout ... dark as a struck match in a box wearing a diving suit under water ... slick and oily, chewy stuff here ... sweet vanilla notes ... what did stu spill again??"
"Overall, it's really not that good for an oatmeal stout. It's a bit harsh on the roasty side, which makes it less drinkable. It was on sale though, so I'm not really complaining."
"Received in a trade with iceicebaby (thanks Sean). Served in a nonic. Poured a dark, cola brown, with deep red highlights detectable during each tilt of the glass.. Half-inch mocha-colored head dissipated into a thin skim of foam. Lacing was somewhat thin and watery, but left behind a few meandering bands. Scents of coffee and milk chocolate abound; very sweet nose. Taste similar to nose, but sweetness is somewhat cut by a noticeable, but not unpleasant alcohol presence. Mouthfeel was somewhere between light- and medium-bodied, but there was a pronounced slickness as well as an effervescence and light burn throughout the mouth and back of the throat. Excellent stout, but somewhat sweeter than than the oatmeal stouts I've tasted lately. Great drinkability; finished it in under 5 minutes."
"Pours a oil black color with thin burnt orange/brown head, average retention and some lacing. Smells of roasted oat, burnt malt, chocolate, and coffee. Tastes of burnt roasted malt, oat, smoke, and dark chocolate, with espresso in the finish. Medium in body but a little thin, very burnt and roasty flavors make it not very smooth but there is some creaminess deep down. An easy oatmeal stout to drink if you like lots of burnt flavors, hides the alcohol well."
"Finishes with a tongue-wrapping amount of choco-roast, and hints of residuals and drying char."
"D - Difficult."
"No problems here. Goes down smooth with nice flavors that run over the palate and develop a bit on their way down. As the abv kicks up the flavors lose their boldness, but otherwise no complaints. This will will be my new go to when I have a hankering for a staple oatmeal stout."
"Overall: A nice oatmeal offering by dark horse. Pretty nice flavors and aromas. Enjoyable, and light enough to drink all summer long. I wish I could get it all the time."
"Drinkability - one and done man."
"D: It was watery and lacked balance. However, none of the flavors left an adverse impression. Not a good session beer."
"Pours a rich dark black color with the darkest brown head I've seen on any oatmeal stout. Smell is lightly smoky, stale wet cardboard and roasty malt. Rather unimpressive nose actually. Taste is rather smoky for a sweet stout or oatmeal with decent roasty character. Mouthfeel is just average with light carbonation. Overall, disappointing like the other 2 beers I've had from Dark Horse. I expected more, and this seems to have a smoky presence that doesn't fit the style and is a bit offputting despite the fact that I enjoy smoked beers."
"Overall, I thought this was excellent. Certainly, a more then worthy stout, and a great introduction to what they can do at Dark Horse with well, a dark beer. It was a little more of a hybrid style for me, but I guess and imperial oatmeal stout would be anyway. Could have been a little sweeter, but this was still excellent by all means. A very good beer here and I anxiously await trying the rest of the series."
"D - Another solid beer from Dark Horse but the burnt astringent taste would keep from from having more than 1 in a sitting."
"D_Was not expecting to like this one as much as I did. From the full winter of stout overload to the mediocre appearence, I just was not expecting much. This is just a really nice stout, which is hitting the spot."
"D-An ok beer, but not for me."
"D- I'm sad to say that this one has let me down. I love Dark Horse and I love Oatmeal Stouts so needless to say I was excited for this. Glad I got to try it just ashame it let me down. Don't think it's much of a oatmeal stout."
"It's by no means a bad oatmeal stout. I do feel betrayed by the looks and initial smell that led me to think it would be extraordinary. After that it became incomplete."
"So dark the pouring stream is opaque. Generates a nice fluffy dark tan head that fades fairly quickly to spotty patterns of lacing. The smell is timid yet discernible; lightly roasted barley and hints of chocolate and coffee. Very lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is heavy and smooth without an aggressive coating presence. The flavors is also somewhat reserved. There is a tang of bitterness, but mostly a nice lightly roasted malt and chocolate with a spot of coffee that lingers nicely. A really good drinker. Shout out to BigDaddyWil."
"Would seem to be an Imperial Oat and a pretty good one....I would drink this again..."
"Tried this oatmeal stout from Dark Horse, I'd never seen it before. Not as sweet as I like my oatmeal stouts, not bad but not that great. Decent to try once."
"D: Drinkable but quite mediocre overall. I'll pass next time."
"I kinda felt this was disappointing - very watery and bland. No carbonation, heavy bodied though. I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone, but it's not bad in any way."
"A vigorous pour of thes oily black hole bodied brew only produces a half an inch of milk chocolate colored head that fades to a skim in a couple of minutes. Nose has notes of waxy malt and earthy oil tones. it is rather soft though. The initial sip yields musky alchol, and spicey malt hues. It is thinner in body than I would expect from the style. The end of the palate develops a dry mouthfeel that almost resembles dark chocolate. The musky mouthfeel is really a dominating point to this beer. Not bad but not my favorite of the four in this series."
"Slightly lacking in feel, more like an English Porter than stout. Light, with some very mild lactic character, overall a cinch to drink."
"This is a pretty good Oatmeal Stut from Dark Horse. Easy to drink and enjoy."
"*Shrug*"
"D - A real pleasure to drink due to the oats' added smoothness. Full flavored with an alcohol content that doesn't make waves. Recommended."
"A pretty solid Oaty Stout with a calmingly easy, milky smooth drinkability."
"pretty Drinkable. I bought two 4 packs and the older it gets, the less I like it. Good beer but not anything to wow about."
"D: Nice stout, tad off balanced but still a good time. Good use just a smidge of sweetness to help the off center dry charred flavors."
"D - What you want in appearance and mouth feel, but lacks in taste and smell. Was this too cold? No, it was right around 55 deg. Meh, not bad in anyway, just not the whole picture."
"A solid stout, easy to drink, and a bit on the bitter side."
"Pours an opaque black, thin brown head forms, some lace spots, settles to a thin layer and ring. Smell is nice, chocolate, some roast, coffee, toffee, oats, very rich aroma. Taste is chocolate milk, roast, coffee, lacto sweetness, toffee, more chocolate, oats, light sourness in the finish, very nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, silky smooth, nice stout."
"The bottom line: Dark Horse has put together a nice take on the oatmeal stout style here. The roasted coffee show is here, and adds a touch of hops to the performance to liven things up. Worth giving a try if you run into it."
"Last year I got my hands on Tres stout (blueberry). This is my first sampling of the oatmeal and it is damn fine. From my expierences Dark Horse makes some tasty stouts and I hope they keep them coming."
"Good stout from Dark Horse. Pitch black with some brown head, no lacing. Smells roasty, with coffee and dark chocolate. Taste is rather sharp and bitter. Tastes good, but drinkability suffers since it is so bitter. Only real problem is that it doesn't have that creamy oat flavor."
"12 oz bottle. The brew is solid black, letting no light through. A finger of tan head forms and quickly falls to a full coat over top. There are a few bubbles coming up as well. The nose is extremely roasty and piny from hop. Taking a more deep inhale over top brings a little of the mild oat character. It feels a little focused towards the roast and hop for an oatmeal stout. Taking a sip, I find an initial smooth and creamy oat character overlaying a nicely balanced chocolate sweet and roasted sharpness. This fades to a very nice creamy chocolate finish with just the lightest hint of coffee. Throughout, there is a very green pine hop just laying in with the other flavors. I like this one. Mouthfeel is really nice. There is a solid moderate body that is very smooth. Only a slight carbonation comes through, just barely breaking that feel up. I do enjoy this brew. The aroma seems to be a little skewed towards characteristics that don't come through in the flavor and are not necessarily what I would consider to be dominant in an oatmeal stout. This is one that I would certainly visit again come winter if I could find it."
"Pours an opaque motor oil black with a one finger light brown head that quickly dies down to a thin layer. Stickiness is pretty good. Smell is of dark fruits and roasted oats. Toasted barley is very noticable as well in the nose. Taste doesn't seem to be much of an oatmeal stout, a bit too smokey. Starts off with a tiny bit of sweetness from the oats but is then dominated by the roasted barley. In the aftertaste you can sense a little bit of caramel malt but not enough to make it enjoyable. Mouthfeel is pretty creamy and full bodied with minimal carbonation. Don't think I could have another. A bit disappointed in this beer from Dark Horse."
"drinkability is not as good due to the very rich and thick character of the brew. the complexity and balance of the aroma and taste is only heightened by a full body and a rich texture. very well crafted brew."
"drinkability - Not a bad stout. I don't think I taste any oasts though."
"Pours out basically black, with a minimal amount of head that is very brown. Looks OK. Not much aroma, mostly ""stouty"" - dark, bitter smells like coffee and chocolate. It's mostly a coffee flavor upon the first sip, with some ripened berry flavor too. Decently balanced, with a suitable aftertaste. Nice in the mouth, plenty smooth, but maybe a tad watery. For the most part, went down easy, as stouts go. Overall, pretty good."
"My favorite of the Dark Horse stouts. Very solid."
"Thanks to Blankboy!"
"Black as midnight. Thin dark brown head. Lace is moderate. Slight roastiness and a little bit of a tannic edge to it on the nose. The flavors please me more than the aromas did. It's got some nice stout qualities...like the roasted malts and some definite ""char"" characteristics. Some dark, bitter baker's chocolate. A little anise and some blackened berries. Nice velvetly feel to this beer and very easy to drink. Too easy. Give me a Mexican mole dish with this and I'm smiling :>)"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is very dark, black even, with a tiny brown head that quickly dissipates into the black abyss, leaving a micro-ring around the edge of the glass. Smell is very enjoyable and defined, semi-sweet chocolate, burnt coffee and perhaps a hint of vanilla. The taste is much the same, with the charred coffee flavor coming to the forefront, but it is well balanced by the slight sweetness of the oatmeal and finishes very smooth. I read from another BAs report that this has 8% and I believe it, but I can't taste it. Well done. The mouthfeel is great; viscous and creamy, incredibly smooth. This is a very drinkable and enjoyable oatmeal stout, I will have to make a point to pick up the others in the series (which I was previously unaware of)."
"D: Way more roasted, smokey, and bitter than I expected this Oatmeal Stout to be. Regardless, this is very enjoyable. Dark Horse needs to come to IL!"
"Recieved in a trade from plucier. Served at cellar temperature in a pint glass. Poured a deep brown that turned black in the glass. About one good finger of tan frothy head rose from the glass. Head dissipated quickly into a small ring of lace. Smell: Nice roasty toasty aromas of sweet malt, chocolate, and some bitter roasted coffee. Taste: Bitter burnt coffee. sweet chocolate, roasted malt, black licorice with a nice oatmeal flavor. Very smooth at first with a nice bitter coffee finish. Not too bad. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and dry but is a very drinkable beer."
"D- Very well done. Too bad I don't know the ABV on this- but I could definitely feel it. I am really going to be getting this again."
"Thick, full, milky mouthfeel reveals slightly tart, toasted-roasted coffee malts. Dark chocolate/cocoa sweetness comes in, backed by peat and mildly astringent bitterness. Herbal hops back up the meaty finish. A keeper. Another nice DH stout. Man, can these MI breweries make some great stouts or what?!"
"Overall a solid brew, the unbalanced bitterness keeps it from being great."
"I've been looking for Dark Horse beer for some time now and was lucky enough to run across the entire Holiday Stout Series several days ago. If One is any indication of the quality that I can expect from Too, Tres and Fore, then it will be all I can do to restrain myself from drinking them all today."
"Quite possibly the best beer from Dark Horse. Very, very nice. Highly recommended!"
"This beer had a black pour with a coffee colored head sitting on top. Taste is a little oatmeal and slightly roasty but nothing special. Drinkability wasn't great due to the taste not being very enticing. Oh well, I was still glad to have had the chance to drink this midwestern brew."
"dark horse's winter stout series is one of my favorite things going in american craft beer. it's subtle, creative, local (for me), and it's all high quality."
"drinkability: highly drinkable"
"D- This beer is smooth but there is no real depth and no oatmeal qualities. The dark malt flavor do have a nice flavor that makes it go down quickly."
"Black with a thick, brown head. Great appearance. Aroma is sweet and loaded with roasty malts, cherries, and chocolate. Nice balanced sweet fruitiness and bitter oats and coffee. Simple but yummy. Balanced feel, light to medium bodied. Slick. Very nice. Exceptionally drinkable,"
"Dark black pour creamier foam head. Almost a shot of espresso with barley and vanilla and licorice injected. Very rich and a quick bitter sweet finish. Good finish that does not last too long. A good complex blend for the not so complicated stout and is a pleasure."
"This is a decent oatmeal stout, but it lacks something in overall depth of flavor. Isn't quite as smooth as others I've had. Nothing I'd certainly turn down, but it just seemed to be missing something that the aroma alluded to and the taste left out."
"And thanks to trbeer!"
"D: A damn fine stout. Easy drinking with a nice bold body. A perfect offering for those cold winter eves. Glad I had the chance to try this."
"Overall an awesomely balanced and hearty stout to say the least. Halfway through the bottle when the temperature warmed up a bit, the flavors all became rounder and softer, again making it more 'truer' to style. The dry, sweet & bitter all danced effortlessly together. What a fantastic stout."
"I don't know what to think about this one. Robust malty, coffee flavor but has strange lingering aftertaste. I say give it a try and see what happens!"
"Mouthfeel is quite smooth with plenty of body that really grabs on as you drink. I could see myself having a few of these with no problem. Another good brew from Dark Horse...I haven't had a bad one yet! Thanks to hoppymeal for the bottle."
"Last swigs: All Jello pudding skin. Needs a clutch hit in the midle to ring out a song. Dug it for the most part and I do thank HoppyMeal for the bottle."
"This stout kicks ass. Really. Though it lacks pretty much any head whatsoever (and I mean, basically NO HEAD), it is a mesmerizingly pleasing deep caramel/nearly black color. And the aroma, oh boy! A treat in itself! Caramel, chocolate, here I come! The only thing this was a bit weak in was the mouthfeel, but only in comparison to other Oatmeal Stouts--it was surprisingly light for it's type. This is simply one of my favorite Oatmeal Stouts."
"Black with a very thin skim of fine, dark brown bubbles that form a slender ring around the glass. Some lacing, particularly after some agitation. Rich, malty aroma, plenty of roast, milk chocolate, and a hint of caramel. Moderate bitterness, burnt and roasted especially towards the finish. Bittersweet chocolate, toasted oats. Some acidity in the finish. Very low carbonation, thick and viscous, a bit of creaminess, fairly smooth. Quite tasty. Almost a meal in itself!"
"Add a few bubbles and this would really be good. It is still a good mellow stout. Very similar to a milk stout in flavor this is more or less a stout milkshake, add Ice cream and make a float!"
"A pleasant brew with a good deal of roasted grain complexity. Despite the fact that the body could have used a bit more substance, there is a great showcase of flavor packed in here. A enjoyed this ale, but then again if I was going to go for a Dark Horse sout I'd reach for their Special Reserve Balck Bier over this."
"Aroma is burnt and toasty malts with hints of chocolate. Pours deep black with a diminishing dark brown/mocha head. Fore is sweet cocoa/chocolate/coffee with hints of vanilla and a nice smoothness from the oatmeal. Hints of dark fruits and a kick of hops in the finish. Very tasty brew."
"This One does not Win, Place or even show me much!"
"Pours out to a deep coffee black color with nearly no head. Very low carbonation. Aromas of thick coffee and dark chocolate. Taste is full bodied and dense; flavors of roasted malts, cocoa, coffee, some dark fruits and hop bitterness on the finish. Powerful flavors. Mouthfeel is good, thick and heavy like a oatmeal stout should be. Drinkability is average. I feel like there is a brick in my stomach... Worth a try."
"Inky brown. Beautiful aromas of patent leather, machine grease and roasted, sweet seeds. Faint lemon zest scents intermix with a wallop of blue fruits and espresso. Fleshy, fatty nuts bob merrily through the black broth. Burnt grape bubblegum. Surprisingly juicy, with blood orange flavors rising on the finish, though they never offer serious competition for the mass of roasted cocoa and coffee essences."
"from the bottle. the last of the 3 stouts that I bought and this one did not disappoint me. poured black with a brown head with some lacing. flavor sweet, malts, chocolate, coffee. flavor the chocolate and malts where right on for me got some dark fruits and berries. very good."
"Pours opaque black with a minimum khaki colored head. Smells of raw oatmeal and roasted grain. Taste starts off a little acrid before the oatmeal smoothes things out. Roasted grain matches smooth oatmeal in a filling manner. Smooth malt finishes the falvor with a hint of alcohol. A decent oatmeal stout."
"The dark appearance, the scent of the oatmeal, chicory, and boozy. Bit of metallic and sourness, not all that smooth, as bitter cocoa powder grains, however quaffable. Cream, malt, coffee, good not outstanding.Thanks for fulfilling my requests Wohlfs"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" dark brown head over the opaque black brew. Head quickly fades to an uneven layer of bubbles, and lacing is minimal. Aroma is dark roasty sweet oats, and that's about it. Taste is sweet burnt oatmeal, with a slight tang in the middle, and closes reasonably dry on the tongue. Mouthfeel is smooth due to the heavy oat use, and drinkability is is down a bit due to a preponderence of the dark malt giving it a slight bitter bent that seems out of place."
"This is a really good (dry) stout, but not exactly what one would expect an oatmeal stout to taste like. Tastes more like Bell's Kalamazoo than it does Samuel Smith's Oatmeal."
"Good beer. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good."
"Not much of an Oatmeal Stout and a bit hard to finish. A bit too robust and not as subdued or clean as one might expect. Definitely a bit oxidized, and the linger is not very appealing."
"Thank you to trbeer for the bottle. This is an odd oatmeal stout...sweetness seems a bit out of place. It's enjoyable though, and I might well have one again."
"The beer as its ejects from the 12 ounce brown bottle pours a pitch-black, the head portly in size, the texture spumous, and the lace a fine curtain to conceal the glass. Nose is that of toasted grain, sweet chocolate, fresh and pleasant to the senses, start is sweet, nice malt profile, the top middling in feel. Finish has a spirited acidity, the hops delightful, dry and lingering aftertaste, drinkable stout tis true."
"Not quite up there with Kalamazoo in sheer drinkability, but a very good ""monster-of-a-stout"" worth searching for. This is one heck of a beast but is easy to drink and oh-so-smooth. Highly recommended. A meal in itself."
"This one poured darker than a black hole. No light passing through it. Head was small tan colored. Aroma was of a strong oat presence along with some lactic characteristic. Taste was definite oat. Lots of oats partially roasted. Not too sweet though. More of a bitter stout. The oats could've used more companions."
"Blacker than last weekend here in Detroit during the big blackout. Dark tan head is sponge-like in appearance. Fairly strong chocolate and caramel aromas that sloppily cover a hint of roasted sweets, s'more like. A great sweet start. Pretty bitter finish for an oatmeal stout. The texture is milky, creamy, satin. These guys have stouts nailed."
