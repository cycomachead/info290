Smells of cocoa, dark roast malts and some coffee with maybe a light floral hop scent.  Dark chocolate and roast coffee emerged as it warmed up. Tastes of coffee, dark chocolate and cocoa powder, sweet malts, moderate hop sweetness fading to piney.  The medium to heavy body itself was excellent but it was very heavily carbonated which took away from the flavor and feel, not sure if it is always like that or just this batch.  Flavor and smell really popped once the beer warmed and the carbonation dissipated.  Left with pine resin on the palate and lips as well as a lingering dark roast flavor.  Despite the heavy carbonation it was still an excellent beer.","GregJ","Nov 18, 2014"

The aroma is rich, deep roasted malts hints of coffee, toffee, and oat. The taste is delicious, with all the aroma notes present and mixing together with the nice addition of the hops to add a pleasant twist on the style. The body is slick and there is a little bite on the finish. A great big stout.","delta490","Oct 07, 2014"

Coffe and hops come up front, with a HUGE blast of roasted bittersweet chocolate. Lingering cocoa and sweet fruit left on the palate. Relatively high carbonation for the style, bur still retains a nice silkiness. Bitter really lasts. Nice stout that sits somewhere on the flavor profile scale between Plead the 5th and Darkness, with focus on the bitter cocoa and with less chewiness.","BMMillsy","Oct 09, 2013"

However, to those BAs who love extremely intense coffee flavors, I'm sure this beer is a Godsend. Myself, I like more sweetness for balance and more complementary flavors as well. For example, sweet malt and chocolate flavors to help offset the bitterness of coffee and add a little complexity. This beer reminds me a lot of Bell's Java Stout, except that it's nearly 6 times the price. But hey, don't listen to me.

Those big coffee flavors are there, but are greatly complemented by the dark roasted malt and the smoothness to the mouthfeel the oatmeal brings. Still, this is a very coffee forward stout with only some chocolate flavor. With the smooth mouthfeel and light carbonation, the beer drinks pretty well.

4.25,3.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.25,"The beer pours like pitch black oil. Thick and sludge-like, this beer looks like the dregs of French press coffee. It pours with a small, dark khaki/light brown head of bubbles that fizzles away to leave a scrim moving up the sides of the glass. The body is too dark to see through, and the head leaves no lacing on the glass. On the nose, the beer smells of middling roast malt and coffee with a slight vegetal/dark fruit smell that seems to be coming from the coffee. Grainy oats also bristle over the nose like hot oatmeal and blend beautifully with the roast coffee. I was a little concerned when I first sniffed this beer, but as it sits in my snifter its scent exponentially rises in enticement. On the tongue, the beer tastes of big coffee bitter roast with a light sweet hint from the malt and coffee beans and a slight bite of acidity. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet dark fruits which immediately explodes in roasted coffee with a nice bitter bite that dries the beer out and brings layer upon layer of coffee flavors to the tongue, running from dark fruits, to chocolate, to roasted malts. This beer’s flavor profile is perfect for the morning. In the mouth, the beer is creamy and medium in body, which is surprisingly light for a stout of this size but must be due to the added coffee. The beer’s carbonation is light, and just gives a faint prick to the tongue, allowing the coffee and malt flavors to dominate the mouth. The mouth is left bitter dry with a bit of stickiness and a decent amount of acid neutralizing saliva running through the mouth. Overall, this is a beautiful stout that really hits the coffee lovers sweet spot. The coffee flavors are brilliantly represented in this beer. Unlike Founder’s Breakfast Stout, this beer showcases the coffee as the center of your palate, instead FBS’s beautiful balance, but this beer’s coffee is perfect on the tongue. I would love to knock this beer back in the morning, as it has the perfect amount of coffee roast flavoring to start the morning. This beer is great, do yourself a favor and try it.","Maxwell","May 31, 2013"

3.95,-3.9,4.5,4.5,4,3,3.5,"Pours a black color with a rocky brown head with large bubbles. Medium retention and lacing. Aroma is a nice blend of strong coffee, toffee, chocolate and piney hop. Real coffee comes first in the taste (title is not a lie!). Fresh character from malt and hoppy notes. Palate is smooth but unfortunately the body is on the light side. Some astringency from the roasted character and a dry finish that lingers well along a medium bitterness. Really good beer but it frankly didn't impress me more than that. Perhaps a bit too straightforward...","duracell","Oct 19, 2012"

Runs the gamut of tastes, can be bitter and burnt early on, then can devolve into a nicer smoothness while still allowing the coffee to be the primary flavor going on. But its not simply a one trick pony, there's actually plenty of that dark chocolate and caramel going on as well here. Nice chewy mouthfeel, hides alcohol decently, this is another winner from Mikkeller. Only real downside is the price, but its not out of the realm of another purchase down the road despite the price, because its good enough to justify it.","Beerandraiderfan","Aug 01, 2012"

BLACK, maybe a bit of dark brown in there, let's say coffee bean coloring, with serious sediment resting on the bottom of the glass, to be enjoyed at the very end. Smell consists of light oats, bitter coffee and chocolate. Taste follows suite. However, for some reason, a metallic flavor that I do not particularly enjoy, but can tolerate and even overlook, is present (I believe this is down to the age of the beer, it has been sitting for some time, but this is only a theory as I have yet to test it multiple times. This is the second time I let one of these beers "sit" that it's had a slight metallic flavor). Mouthfeel is relatively smooth with mild carbonation. Some bitterness on the end, which is expected.

The oatmeal helps with the mouthfeel especially. Perhaps it could have a tiny bit more coffee flavour and depth through that, but there isn't really much to improve on here.

A little carbonation. Quite right for a stout. Aroma - sweet cream, roasted malts, coffee bean, oats, a hint baker's chocolate, and a very subtle woody/smokiness. At first when hitting the palate, there is a sense that it is not as strong as expected - the smoky flavor comes right in, with the middle being oats and roasted malt... then, there is a delay and in the fantastic finish a strong wave of bitterness/chocolate and coffee rushes in. perhaps a hint of hops in the outskirts somewhere.

Dry, not sweet which adds drinkability but leads to a slightly harsh finish. A serious stout with a big punch of flavor, but I appreciate the below average ABV for the style.","bump8628","Mar 29, 2012"

4.03,-1.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a tulip glass. Color was a nice dark brown/black coffee color that was completely opaque. A nice thick head faded away to a thin layer that clung to the sides very well and was a light brown in color. Aroma was a sweet oatmeal bread, mixed with a sweet cocoa mocha smell. Subtle, but nicely pleasant and balanced. Taste was slightly lactose sweet up front, then shifted to a mild coffee flavor. Not overly acidic or bitter. Felt good in the mouth. A bit chewy and nicely thick, coated well, with just a hint of carbonation. Overall a very well balanced stout. Not overly acidic like some, and it reflected the flavors and name nicely.","mountdew1","Mar 17, 2012"

Some very nice lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of chocolate, roasted malt, herbal hops, coffee, oak, biscuit, and some dark fruits. Decent aromas with good strength, but they are a bit of a let down. This bottle is probably past prime. Taste of big coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, molasses, herbal hops, and some earthiness. Fair amount of coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, and biscuit on the finish for a bit. Medium carbonation and body; with a very nice creamy, chewy, and lush mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is a very nice stout, with good flavor and balance. This was definitely past prime, so I will have to pick it up again in the future and not cellar it as long as I did with this one.","superspak","Feb 26, 2012"

3.46,-15.8,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall, I do like this beer as a stout but it's not really doing it for me from the coffee standpoint. As I said at the beginning, maybe I have been spoiled by things like FBS, Wake N Bake, and Bell's Java which bring the coffee in force. Or maybe I should have opened this earlier. I would drink this again but I can't say that I would necessarily actively seek it out over others from the style.","bcostner1","Nov 06, 2011"
4.19,1.9,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Overall – Overall this is a really good beer that actually surprised me quite a bit. Maybe because I just wasn’t expecting very much from this beer since it’s not a limited release barrel aged beer. Then again, I find myself thinking throughout the course of this beer that I could probably be fooled into thinking this was a partially barrel aged stout with coffee added in a blind taste test. In any case, this is a superb beer, in my opinion. Really going to have to try to the bourbon barrel aged version to see what that does to this beer. Seek this one out!","matttttYCE","Nov 04, 2011"

The head never really dies on this beer- even after going down to a sliver, and the lacing sticks around forever. Excellent looking brew. The nose is fabulous, and exactly what you'd expect from this type of beer. Coffee, bitter chocolate, roasted malt, and a hint of vanilla and oak. It doesn't get a whole lot better for the style. Wow. The flavor literally explodes in your mouth on the first taste! Incredible blend of the nose profile, and perfectly balanced flavors. Not sure I would change anything on the taste. Hops make their way in there as well. Feel is full bodied, w/ an amazing malt vs. hops thing happening. Malt wins in the end. Overall, this is an amazing beer that I will pick up whenever I see it. It would be easy to change a couple of my scores to 5's and still feel good about it. Highly recommended!","jayhawk73","Oct 07, 2011"

Pours a dark brown, nearly black color. Smell- bourbon, molasses, espresso notes, some alcohol is present. Taste- roasted coffee hits first, followed by a molasses/bourbon flavor, ended with a roasted bitter coffee and chocolate finish. So much going on here- and this will probably change a lot as it warms (served at 55 degrees). Mouthfeel- the oatmeal in this brings some nice thickness that reminds you its a stout, but it is nice and syrupy, with chocolate and coffee notes in tandem in every sip, and it is perfect for the style. Drinkability- this is a sipper, but it is well balanced, and the flavors complement each other well, so I could drink this many times over (and yes, I could have this for breakfast).

Delicate malt on the nose with rich coffee notes and hints of milk chocolate and alcohol. Rich and silky mouthfeel, like thick hot chocolate. Full bodied but not too syrupy. Carbonation is too low. Soft flavors on the palate. Everything is mildly blended together and comes together perfectly. Nothing overpowers so everything can be enjoyed. The malt has a kind of spicy quality on the palate that is different. Coffee and dark chocolate come to dominate and linger with a touch of honey in the finish.

This head has staying power, and the beer itself leaves a fantastic, lovely lacing along the glass. Aromas of milk chocolate, coffee, nut and alcohol are emenating from the glass throughout the pour. This is a smooth and creamy MFer of a stout. Chocolate hits your tongue first, but coffee is hot on its heels. There are some grainy/cereal type flavors in there, as well, which help balance the sweet and the bitter. The beer's body, as stated before, is creamy and smooth.

4.12,0.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours an opaque dark brown color, close to black but not quite there. The head is a huge decadent layer of light brown foam, almost looks like nice crema on an espresso. The beer smells of sweet chocolate milk, dark coffee, vanilla, and an earthy, nutmeg tyoe spice. Very complex once it warms. The taste is dark roasted coffee with sweet cream and little backbone of hot cocoa. There is an ever so slight earthy hop presence that really helps to balance the sweetness. Very dry on the finish and leaves your mouth feeling like you just finished a cup of coffee. Very smooth in the mouth with the perfect amount of light carbonation and goes down very easily while staying very complex for a 7.5% stout. Overall, this is a very good beer from Mikkeler, albeit a bit on the pricey side. I will revisit this one, but it's more like a once a year beer than a regular offering.","dgfair","Jan 10, 2011"

Pitch black hue in the body absolutely captures all bands of the visible light spectrum. Dark tan mocha head visually all appealing as I pour it into my DFH chalice. Fine layers of delicate detailed lacing match so well with the style. Aroma has layers of creamy dark chocolate with slightly acidic big dark coffee roasts, earthy herbal slightly woody coffee roasts. Flavor is the closest to a dark cup of good coffee I've come to know, the acidity really captures the essence of a nice cup of strong coffee. Creamy edges dark chocolate blends hints from the dark roasted malts, the American hops used provide herbal earth notes in the background this is nice well made coffee stout. Mouthfeel has dry dark roasts with bitey hints of acidity, carbonation is upfront sturdy but not overdone. Fuller bodied but not too thick or cloying. Drinkability this stuff is tasting fantastic, true coffee beer experience here, I hope to find more of the Mikkeller offerings.

The nose comprises a healthy dose of cofee, some darkly roasted malts, and some burnt caramel. I was kinda hoping for more...shall we say, variety?...but what's there works and smells good. That's all ya really need, people. The taste tones the coffee down a ways, allowing the roasted malts to come through a bit better. The caramel is now a complete pile of cinders, as though 'twere left on the cast iron griddle a touch too long. So, basically, this thing tastes of coffee and overly cooked/burnt grains and sugars. It still tastes alright, but not quite what I was expecting, especially after Brunch. (I know, breakfast after brunch sounds goofy, but, dammit, I haven't slept normally in some time, so go to hell!) Now, maybe if the coffee was shit out by some sort of stoat or varmint... The body is a light heavy, with a sorta moderate carbonation and a straightforward feel and finish.

Not a very great initial taste, but the chocolate comes next, followed by a STRONG coffee/espresso taste. Very delicious. The mouthfeel is very full bodies, but a bit overly carbonated IMO.

The flavor is wonderfully intense with notes of roasted malt mingling with espresso and dark chocolate. Unfortunately, this is a wham, bam, thank you ma'am sort of brew and the robust flavor quickly fades to just a burnt, bitter aftertaste in my mouth.

Just leave the glass on the counter, forget about it and eventually it recedes close to the surface, the glass sides about half coated in thick lacing. Pure black liquid, just as the kids like it today. The nose is the quintessential "fist in the velvet glove," a haymaker of dark chocolate powder, cocoa, roasted coffee beans, chicory, black licorice, never too sweet as the oatmeal and general hoppiness, does not lack a bitter aspect to cancel out excess sugariness. In the mouth it is full-bodied and tilts further towards the bitter, tart side of things. The roast in the coffee more obvious, espresso-like, the chicory and roasted grains get your mouth puckering big time. The dark chocolate, carob, brown sugar more makeup than substance. Carbonation is low but steady at its chosen level, does not feel sluggish on the palate. Suggestion of lemon peel and flowers near the finish.

Sweetness and dry, husky taste mixed, almost evenly balanced, yet the beer overall is probably best described as medium body and chewey with a silky smoothness. One can really taste the coffee and roasted malts and there is an underlying sweetness there as well. To really show off there is a tad bit of a fruity hop presence and something like black cherries as well. The finish is sticky with both sweet caramel, bitter hops, bready malt all in there for a dry yet complementary backbite.

The hops add a harsh bitter which is also a bit lemony hoppy. The oats give the beer a slight oily taste.

Coffee stands out as the primary flavor IMO...but with the sweet up front flavors, a great complimenting bitterness takes over the back end. The aftertaste, minutes after being drank...leaves an awesome coffee flavor lingering on the tongue. Carbonation was low and decent for a stout. This is a very tasty stout! I'd have to say though, whereas most beers...stouts included...get tastier as they warm up, this one stops getting tasty at solid room temp. It turns to mostly bitters.

Seems to have good retention with the head staying till almost the last drop, though leaves little lacing on the glass. The smell threw me off at first as I got a good scent of chocolate when I was expecting more of a coffee smell. The coffee however is there and is upfront with a nice roasted smell. The taste is similar, nice coffee taste with some chocolate in the background. Has a nice roasted taste. Has somewhat of a different coffee taste than other coffee beers I've had but I really like it, might be espresso I'm getting. Whatever the case it goes down smooth and fast, pretty good stuff. The ABV isn't huge by any means but at 7.5% I don't taste it making this one way more easier to drink. Overall this is one I've been wanting to try for a while and now am glad I did. I don't know how fresh this one was as I believe it's been on the shelf a while making me think a fresh one might have more of a coffee flavor (not that it really needs it or anything). I wish I could start my day off with this more often but as a review said earlier the price tag makes me rethink that.

4.24,3.2,4,5,4,4,4,"D - The aroma of this beer is striking and nothing short of spectacular. The combination of dark malt character presents the nose with a balanced and beguiling sampler of everything one could want in an imperial stout. This sets a high bar for the flavor qualities to get over and, sadly, they can't quite make it. Contrary to the rich layers of espresso and toffee in the aroma, the flavor is plagued by a recurring watery cola character. While I would like to overlook this flat flavor note, it is somewhat dominant in the flavor profile and genuinely hurts the complexity of the beer. Nevertheless there are some echos of the dense aroma in the chocolate and coffee notes of the finish and the aftertaste nearly redeems the flavor with its smoky, acrid charm. Overall it is a very nice beer, but I really expected it to be thicker and I think if is had been, it would have helped the overall impression of the beer, and the complexity of the flavor, immensely. If this beer tasted like it smelled, it would be world class; as it stands, it is good, but leaves me with an aching sense of unfulfilled promise.","nickfl","Jan 09, 2010"

Full bodied but seemed thinner than expected, soft carbonation, finishes with a roasty bitterness and slightly tart. Big coffee aftertaste. ABV well hidden. This is a very bold brew, huge coffee flavors. The tart/sour flavor is a bit odd and the coffee flavor at the end can be a bit much.

The density of the head was such that my sip's residue would run back down through the head like a vein. The taste was coffee, chocolate, but in a no-playin'-around way.

Tastes of coffee, roasted malts, a weird smokey taste , no alcohol in the taste really and sweet oatmeal flavor, good stuff. Mouthfeel is extra thick like cream, very creamy with little carbonation, very very thick stuff here, awesome mouthfeel for sure.

The flavor is rich and full with big roasted malt, chocolate and coffee notes. There's also a clear hop bitterness in the finish. The coffee flavor is not artificial like some coffee stouts but dark, complex and rich. The feel is smooth despite the bitter rich flavors.

Even with a soft pour of only half the glass the head deceptively slowly rose up, and poured out of the glass. Very annoying. I like a good head on a beer, but not this much from a stout. The aroma is of graham crackers, dark chocolate, and maybe a hint of coffee grounds. It is a pleasant aroma, but I barely detect any coffee which is really weak for a so called coffee stout. The taste has a little bit more pronounced used coffee ground flavor. Not the most pleasant coffee presence I've encountered in a beer. This makes it a good thing that most of the taste is of dark chocolate, roasted malt, and graham crackers. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a carbonation level the is higher than more stouts, but not overly high. The texture is silky. The mouthfeel is by far the aspect of this beer I like most.

That said, it seems like the first bottle we had wasn't tainted, because the second had the same qualities. Certainly drink this at room temperature to maximize the roasted flavors, but even then I wasn't terribly impressed.

3.54,-13.9,5,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Been thinking about trying this for a long time and finally put down the $11 for it. This is a beautiful looking stout, a non aggressive pour yields a huge 5 finger light brown head with serious lacing. Aroma is of dark chocolate with earthy/woody undertones even a hint of sawdust. Taste is a bit of a disappointment, dry and bitter, strong hops &oatmeal. There is a burnt taste a la blackened catfish (is this a good food pairing, I wonder?). Some french roast coffee and black pepper flavor comes in at the end, and does linger in the aftertaste. The bottle claims this is well balanced and full bodied. I find it lower on malt than some of my favorite stouts. I find that the mouthfeel is medium, not watery for sure, but not real chewy. There is some creaminess felt on the front of the tongue, but it is mostly a dry sipper. Drinkability for me would be low. Alcohol is present despite only being 7.5%. While my review seems negative, this is a quality brew and perhaps my expectations were too high. This is no beginners stout and even 2-3 years ago, I might not have even finished it. My tastes are evolving and I might revisit this some day. Overall it is a nice representation of the style but not at all worth the coin. This reminds me somewhat of Ipswich Stout (Mercury brewing).

4.11,0,5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Original review: One of the darkest streams of liquid I have ever seen splashes into my glass and kicks up a huge mocha coloured head, which takes a long time to dissipate to a finger of foam, and leaves lots of lacing on the way. Held up to the light, the beer is not as black as it originally appeared, and veers more towards dark chocolate colour. The aroma is full on espresso, with a bit of chocolate. The flavour is high on the coffee, and lacks the balance of peche mortel. I can sense some really good roasted malts and stout characteristics, but the espresso flavour is perhaps a little too dominant. Nonetheless, a damn solid stout. The bitterness of the coffee hits hard in the first sip, but mellows out once the palate is used to it, allowing some of the malts and bitter chocolate to peek through. I feel there is something lacking though, and it could do with a creaminess or caramel flavour to offset the bitterness of the espresso. The mouthfeel is medium (in part due to the presence of very fine granules of coffee), and with decent carbonation. Drinkability is a tough one to measure - its decent, but something I find hard to drink unless its slowly over the course of an evening. Decent, but in my opinion a bit overrated.","bobsy","Mar 10, 2009"

3.75,-8.8,5,5,3.5,2.5,3,"Motor oil black with a three to four finger mocha head, tons of lacing and small bubble carbonation look very promising. Ditto with the smell - a nice latte, malted milk chocolate smell with sweetness and nicely understated espresso aroma. The taste is comprised of a roast coffee first impression that is quite nice but then it takes a turn for the worst with a harsh middle and an astringent, too dry, cloying finish and aftertaste that seem strangely out of place. The mouthfeel is like a burnt coffee drunk cold, coarse and abrupt, but with a sand-like quality, gritty and not very pleasant. Too bad about that, it started out quite well and kind of went downhill after that. This is like a Jekyll and Hyde stout that shows much promise to begin with and then takes on a different personality. Well worth trying but it could be much better was my impression.","ThatWineGuy","Mar 04, 2009"

Without much of the traditional rich stout flavors to balance it out, this was a bit one-dimensional for my tastes, though I was surprised by the intensity of the coffee after about 10 months in the cellar.

There is kind of a fruity smell, kind of like floral hops or even a tiny bit of ester. The sweet oatmeal comes through in the taste. There's also a coffee and dark malt bitterness. I can even taste a bit f hoppiness, like a faint taste of grass clippings. It's actually a very complex and nice tasting beer. Though I think a bit more deep, malty sweetness with the slight floral taste dialed down could make it better. The mouthfeel is wonderful. Firstly, there's so much to seek out. But it's not astringent at all,well balanced, no alcohol harshness. The only thing that gets me is a little bit of slickness. This one gets to me quickly.

The initial smell is very mild, holding only the faintest hints of oats, cocoa, coffee, and a mild sweetness. A little agitation releases a deeper fresh-brewed coffee aroma that made my mouth water. Yes, I'm being serious here. That fresh-brewed coffee smell is a trigger. Or, if you'd like, it smells like a freshly opened bag of espresso roasted coffee beans. My mind is kind of fuzzy. The first sip is like the first smell, mild. There are coffee, cocoa, and cream notes in there, but they don't really jump out. It's a statement in subtle power. So many things are going on with those flavors, but none of them are powerful enough to stand out. It's like a quiet intro in a great song. It is complex, but you have to strain to here it. A few more sips and the true nature of this as a breakfast stout becomes apparent. The roasted malts are everywhere and the slightly burnt nature of fresh-brewed coffee rises to the front. A touch of cream sweetens the whole thing in the long run, but still leaves a pleasant bitterness in the end. Some very heavy lace notches mark the glass as I drink it down, which lets me know some hopping has gone on, but I really can't taste it. Some warming brings it all together, amplifying the coffee flavors and enhancing some of the underlying cocoa notes. All around, this beer would be more than spectacular with some chocolate cake...for breakfast. In all honesty, this is the first beer that I could picture drinking for breakfast. It's subdued and powerful at the same time. The perfect compliment to chocolate cake or chocolate chip cookies, or if you're looking at breakfast, a chocolate chip muffin.","Goblinmunkey7","Jan 10, 2009"

Taste is reflective of what the cover of the bottle shows; bitter beans of coffee. Starts off tasting sort of cola like, but then settles in with lots of roasted coffee bean, earth and a bit of milk chocolate. Mouthfeel is surprisingly carbonated, which I suppose lends itself to the coffee aspect of the brew, but doesn't strike me as being characteristic of the style.

Smooth espresso right up front on the taste. Very faint sweet smoothness before getting smack around by the coffee taste the rest of the way. Not as layered as I had hoped. Just a smooth burnt coffee taste with a sweetness around the sides. Hops sneak through the back door in the end. An enjoyable brew, certainly pleasing to the eye.

Lots of coffee and roast in the aroma along with a malty caramel base. Notes of licorice and chocolate also appeared as it warmed. Moderate bitterness was mostly overshadowed by the rich malt sweetness and roasted coffee flavours. Again, chocolate and licorice were mild, but added depth and complexity.

The nose is a fairly straightforward mix of standard American/Impy stout with some extra coffee notes thrown in, but there is a particularly nice warm, doughy note hovering in the background. The palate is where this beer separates itself from the pack. Things start off sweet, like rich coffee with sugar and a touch of cream, with plenty of roasted barley to rough things up. Significant hop bitterness comes through next, along with some acidity that sets the sides of the tongue alight. At the finish, the roast comes through again, dry and evocative but never acridly bitter. Everything on the palate is seamlessly integrated; it's a big beer that's never unbalanced in any way. Mouthfeel is excellent; a lot of beers would go for more body here, but I feel that the medium-heavy body is enough to convey the necessary flavors while also being spare enough to enhance drinkability.

As I take more sips, I begin to notice that the roasted malt takes on more of a burnt malt flavour and that works out just fine for me...err..the strange thing is, each sip I take seems to be slightly different from the previous sip; it's almost like the flavours are on rotation.

Like a classic stout it features deep-roasted dark malts, only BG Breakfast has 2000 times more flavor..plus a its sweeter stout definitely on the palate. No odd flavors, or too hot taste.

Cool bottle, lots of mystique built up around this beer, so we'll see how it holds up. Pours black with a khaki head that looks like foamy chocolate milk. head is prety short and fades to nothing rather quickly. Odor much more chocolate that coffee-like. Some tin-like smells as well and some dark malt. Taste is a huge mix of chocolate and coffee. Almost like a mega-expresso version of an iced coffee with added cocoa powder, milk and alcohol. Bitterness from the coffee is intense and lingering to the point where im wondering how caffinated this is...am i drinking beer red bull? My only complaint is that the overwhelming coffee lends a slight metallic hint to the beer. Mouthfeel is creamy and coats the mouth, making it almost cottony. Appropriately full bodied. So yeah, its pretty good. Those Danes make a big and tasty beer.","aforbes10","Nov 17, 2007"
4.2,2.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours very black and slightly viscous, and with a decent initial head that fades rather too quickly to a thin ring. The nose has notes of roasted grain, smooth coffee, and cocoa. The taste is very balanced and smooth- mmore so than some other breakfast stouts but it also lacks power. Silky notes from the oatmeal, rounded slightly sweet cocoa notes, a tad of cream and very nice gentle coffee flavors. Mouthfeel is very smooth and well integrated, but could be a tad creamier and could have a longer finish. Maybe the easiest drinking of the breakfast stouts but in some ways the least interesting. Quite good, but it didn't blow me away. I prefer a little more power- but not burnt coffee which some get wrong. This one didn't.","Georgiabeer","Nov 15, 2007"

The aroma is strong coffee with roasted to burnt malt and a little smoke. The initial flavor is moderately bitter malt that has the coffee but not as much as you expect from the smell. The coffee flavor increases in a smooth transition to a burnt malt/coffee/bitter hops aftertaste. It is very full bodied and smooth with thick creamy texture, lively carbonation, and slightly metallic finish. Overall, it is a tasty stout that is surprisingly well balanced considering the strong coffee aroma. The taste is pretty strong coffee and ot overly complex otherwise.

Flavors of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and hops are all present. All in all the beer manages the smooth texture and flavor of an Oatmeal Stout while toying with the robust body of an Imperial.

Taste is a burnt marshmallow with a strong espresso sting. That is followed up by a quick sweet caramel malt that is then dominated by the smoke flavors again. Big bad coffee beer, I see why it should be for breakfast. So light for this style, almost too watery...but the flavor fits it so well. If you like your mornin' cup o' joe, this brew's for you.

So anyway I dove into this one last night. Poured a very dark black, with a nice two inch tan head of lace and a great side glass contribution. Very thick looking. Huge chocolate and coffee aroma coming off of this, almost a vanilla like coffee, very sweet and rich aromas. The flavor was very full. Lots of roasted coffee mixed in with a light chocolate mix and a hint of a hoppy back, but just a hint. Very rich and creamy, this served up perfect for a dessert brew. It was a bit rough finishing the whole bottle as it is quite thick and very filling. Overall this was a great brew. I compare it to the Wake and Bake and it will definitely hold its own, though this one is definitely not as strong.

Big, luscious mouthful of sweet, roasted chocolate malts and bitter, dry roastiness of the coffee that lingers towards the end. The lightness of the carbonation and its smoothness make it seem really full bodied, but it really floats around in the mouth. My glass is empty already dammit. If I found this at a bar, it would be very hard not to order another.","wedge","Sep 06, 2007"
4.45,8.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer pours a thick murky deep black with a decent dark tan head that slowly diminishes. The aroma is a great blend of roasted barley, espresso, and very dark chocolate. The taste is also a blend of these same things with a slight edge going towards the roasted barley. the espresso is not far behind, however. The beer is on the low end of heavy bodied with plenty of warming alcohol that is fairly well hidden. This is a without a doubt a wonderful stout, I can't wait to try another bottle in the dead of winter.","atsprings","Sep 02, 2007"

The pour is a not surprising inky-black with a dark brown head that reminds me of Bells Expedition it is so dark. The smell is heavy roasted coffee with oats lurking at the edges. The smell is really good if you like coffee. The taste seems to be more oat than coffee with some bitterness like dark chocolate at the end and then the coffee coming back to slap you in the face! The mouthfeel is neither too thin nor too syrupy, just right and the alcohol is well masked by the flavors of the beer. In my opinion this beats Founders Breakfast Stout by a hair or two. This was worth the price of admission but only for one viewing. If you are a coffee-beer fan then you should probably seek this one out.","ArrogantB","Aug 25, 2007"

4.3,4.6,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Served at cellar temperature, into a snifter, from a twenty two ounce bottle. Poured a deep midnight black, with about a two finger, thick, coffee brown crown on top of the beer. Head dissapated somewhat slowly, and left plenty of thick sticky lace behind. Smell: Very thick roasted coffee aroma hits you right in the nose. The coffee aroma was mixed with cocoa, almond, vanilla, and charred wood. Taste: A rich shot of bitter espresso, dark chocolate, a touch of vanilla extract, and some more smokey tones, with a bit of noticeable hops in the rather smooth finish. Very little of the 7.5% alcohol was noticed. Lightly carbonated. Was pretty smooth, clean, and full bodied. Had a bit of a creaminess to it. Nicely balanced with great drinkability.","jaxon53","Aug 10, 2007"

4.03,-1.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall impression: A bold, balanced coffee-flavored oatmeal stout. The coffee is pleasant but not overpowering like many other examples. A good beer but too overhyped.","mattcrill","Aug 06, 2007"
4.08,-0.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Black as demon blood with an imposingly large cap of dark khaki foam, all thick and frothy. Underneath an initial vegetal fresh hop bouquet lay aromas of black roasted grains, baking cocoa, coffee, burnt chicory root, and vanilla. The taste is largely composed of bitter, slightly sour flavors at first, with piney-leafy hops swirling around blackened malts and unsweetened cocoa with a noticeable coffee presence at the finish. Sharp mineral twang upon swallowing, with a decidedly bitter-sour, "green" hop character in the aftertaste. As this stout warms, its initially angular edges begin to soften, with sweeter, more chocolatey malt flavors emerging, particularly at the beginning of the sip. Very smooth, velvety mouthfeel; substantial and full on the palate with an expected silkiness from the oatmeal. At present this is an interesting coffee stout, but the hop presence is a bit much for me as is. I'd like to get another bottle to cellar for about a year so that the hops would fade, allowing the darker chocolate and vinous fruit notes that surreptitiously linger to come forward a bit more. However, at $14 a bottle, I don't know how likely that will be.","orfeu","Aug 03, 2007"
4.26,3.6,5,4,4,5,4.5,"22 oz bomber. This beer pours viscous and black as any beer I have ever seen. There is a dark brown head a finger and a half tall that falls to a full coat over top of the brew. Light has no chance to penetrate this brew; it is sinister looking to say the least. I don't see any bubbles in the brew, but that may be as much due to the viscosity and color than anything else. The aroma is focused towards a dense pine hop and a background of deep roast and dark-roasted coffee beans. It is an interesting combination of the three. Taking a sip, there is a big dose of pine and very green tasting hop to start. This moves to a chocolate and roast, finishing with a mild sweetened coffee and a second coming of the green quality of the hop. The bitter from hop and coffee blend well on the finish and neither is overpowering. Letting it sit on my palette a little, there is a cream-laced coffee flavor that comes through more as the lingering flavors recede. It is interesting. I would like there to be more of a coffee focus, as I feel that the hop plays too central a role in the flavor for what I was expecting with the name and the coffee beans on the label. Mouthfeel is incredible. I almost feel like I am chewing this beer before I can swallow it. Thick is not even close to describe the feel of this one. There is a very mild carbonation in there that just barely stings my tongue. I do not recall any other beers that are this dense. For the big flavors and the massive body, this one has very good drinkability. The ABV is a little lower than I might expect for the style, but I think that helps out and it certainly keeps the body as thick as it is. I'm a happy man to be drinking this beer right now.","kmpitz2","Jul 29, 2007"

The smells of coffee and almonds were very potent, as to be expected. I let this beer warm up a little before drinking it because I though the cold work mask some of the flavor. It goes down easy and lasts a long time after swallowing. It has the perfect blend of malt to go down smooth and then hit you with a ton of the coffee and sugar flavor. Defiantly had some really bad breath after this one. Its a great blend of ingredients. Not to much one way or the other. A really good beer.","RoBotGod","Jul 11, 2007"

4.04,-1.7,4,5,4,3,3.5,"While the flavor is quite nice, I think that the aroma is better; it is richer and fuller, with a better complexity to it. If the complete beer lived up to the initial aroma this beer would be just about perfect. The mouthfeel of this seemed to fizzle a bit after the first couple of sips. Ultimately this is a great beer, it is just that after the first couple of sips this promised to be a stunning beauty of beer; or perhaps better said is started out so decadent and rich, but then took on a lighter tone. As most beer geeks know, it is better to have the lighter less powerful beers first in a session and move one's way up to the more powerful brews; not the other way around like this brew seems to do. As it is though, it is still a great beer, one which I would be happy to have easy access to.","Gueuzedude","Feb 23, 2007"

Body is very slightly brown tinted black and the head is a full three fingers thick, creamy and bubbly, mocha affair that is quite lasting. Fore is tart and acidic then strongly bitter with a blast of coffee. That fruity sweetness from the aroma appears int he middle, but it is more sugar sweet than blueberry/fruit sweet. The coffee notes dominate and while this has a certain smoothness it doesnt immediately strike me as an oatmeal beer. The finish is a blast of dark chocolate and VERY bitter strong dark cofffee.
