"On nitro which may have a slight influence."

"The beer itself tastes creamy with a bit of roast and a mellowed dark chocolate. Best part is the (heh) mouthfeel."

"Taste- Lots of Chocolate, slight hop bitterness, the beer almost tasted like a mocha with its soft coffee finish"

"The beer is dark brown, nearing black, with a thin beige collar. Aromas of chocolate, dark malt, grains, bread. Some dark fruit and raisin notes in the flavor. Really smooth on the palate due to the serving medium. Well balanced and easy to drink. Good stuff."

"Draft at Winberie’s. Dark chocolate pour with minimal head. Thick, chewy oatmeal/chocolate/raisin mouthfeel. One of the first where the oatmeal plays a strong starring role against the other flavors here. Creamy, smooth and delicious. Need to find more of this."

"Solid unsweetened cocoa powder forward and nice oat feel. Roasty grains with some fruit. Nitro doesn't really enhance it all that much for me."

"O - So it's not a rich or robust stout but it's definitely drinkable and enjoyable. Wouldn't grab it if you're looking for a kick in the mouth."

"A one dimensional beer, not much complexity , alot of lighter spectrum stout character and flavors but really this beer that flaunts body and feel over taste. Very easy to drink, the oatmeal does it's job to create that creamy texture."
""

"I had this on tap at Ballast Point. It pours a very dark cola brown and opaque. The head is a light taupe color. The head fades to a thin cap quickly. Coffee nose. Silky smooth mouthfeel. Creamy to the finish. Standard stout. But, miles better than Guinness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A good effort by Ballast on their oatmeal stout, but it ultimately falls a bit short. Boring, simple flavor profile redeemed by it's creamy, nitro'ed mouthfeel."
""
""
""
"Moderately thin bodied; smooth carbonation; creamy nitro feel. I didn’t hate this beer but there just wasn’t much to it at all. The oatmeal was pretty much undetectable in flavor or mouthfeel. I’d like to try this again sans nitro and see how it fares."

"Overall one of the best session stouts I have ever had...I really wish I could get this more often"

"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a dense khaki head that settles to a thin cap. Foamy chunks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, toasted oats, cocoa, and coffee. Taste is pretty much the same with a nice roasty bitterness after each sip. This beer has a thick and creamy mouthfeel due to the nitro treatment. Overall, this is a solid oatmeal stout that is tasty and easy to drink."
"Pretty solid."

"On Nitro at Capone's Black Friday event. This was poured out as a nice looking dark brown color with a creamy white head on top. The lacing and retention on this beer was great. The smell and taste reminded me a lot of Guinness Draught which I was really enjoying because for me it's so easy to drink. There was just a little extra coffee on the nose here. The mouthfeel of the beer was ultra smooth and went down very quickly. Overall it's a good drinkable brew and I would drink it again in the future."

"O - A decent oatmeal stout, but I didn't find it anything that stood out over the others available. Worth a try, especially if you enjoy Ballast Point."
"O: Has potential, but I'd prefer to see it on draft rather than on nitro."
"Overall: A really nice Oatmeal Stout. Well balanced and drinkable. Recommended."
"D - Very good oatmeal stout that reminded me of a milk stout but with some hoppy balls behind it."
"Skol!"
"Sampled this one on the nitro tap at the Ballast Point Brewery/Home Brew Mart in San Diego. Poured a very dark brown color, with a tight, creamy, off-white head. Aromas of fresh coffee, medium chocolate and roasted malt. On the palate, this one is light to medium bodied and creamy, with flavors of roasted malt, cocoa and coffee."
"I think this is a good drinking stout but it could use something a little extra for me. Raising the ABV's a bit would actually help bring something a little more robust in my opinion. Definitely better experienced off of the nitro or even cask perhaps."
"Drink- 1st tap of nitro. I liked the feel, I liked the beer. Nice combo. Ill have this one again."
"Served from nitro-tap into a sampler shaker. Poured black with a red hue around the edges with a minimal light tan head. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, milk chocolate, and very subtle coffee. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and subtle sweet hop. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. It was very light and easy drinking. Not a whole lot of robust anything going on in this one, but the flavors were quite complex for a nitro-tap brew. Really glad I got to try this one and suggest you do as well at least once."
"A delicious, velvety, easy to drink, tasty oatmeal stout."
"Update 11-02-2011: Also on nitro at Sessions Public, but this time really creamy. Makes a nice quaff with the hint of caramel sliding over to charcoal."
"O: The beer is very flavorful, although I’m not sure if I could drink more than one of these in a sitting."
"Overall, the mouthfeel makes it. Its good, but worth a taste."
"on tap at The Ginger Man. Black body, very roasty aroma and one-eight inch of head. Very smooth mouthfeel,creamy. licorice.Real coffee, though I am an ex-coffee drinker. Hoppy.Dry finish,and acid affects drinkability unfortunately for both these characteristics."
"Aromas are mild but pleasant notes of coffee and thick chewy oatmeal. Taste exactly follows the nose with mild java and grainy oats. Mouthfeel is full and delicious; exactly what I want in an oatmeal stout. Mellow yet enjoyable subtle finish. Ratings should be much higher for this beer. Not the greatest but very good."
"D - While I wouldn't have them throughout the night this is a great beer to have one or two."
"D - easy to drink. A good fine oatmeal stout but not an A"
"On tap at the Dive Bar in Worcester. Served in a standard pint glass. Dark as black body, with a contrastingly pearl white head. Smell had a great scent of oats and coffee. Flavor was very impressive, with lots of notes of chocolate and cappuccino. Light on the flavor side, which is what I enjoy in an oatmeal stout. The mouthfeel from the nitro really enhanced the overall experience of this beer. It was one of the more silkier beers I have had lately. Never would have guessed over 6% abv. Could have drank these all night. A world class example of the style."
"Ballast Point has been really consistent with quality beers. This one continues that trend."
"On tap at the Hulmeville. Pours opague black with a nice inch light brown creamy heading that only a beer on nitro can give. Kept about a half inch head until the last gulp. Nothing to fancy with this beer. Some coffee bean aroma's with a touch of chocolate malt.Some powdery lactic grittiness left in the mouth in the finish. Not bad but nothing earth shattering."
"d - A very good oatmeal stout; would like to have again. Very easy to drink."
"I might have to try this on CO2 or cask, because this beer just doesn't seem very flavorful to me."
"D- Not a stout person, it's a ""mood"" for me. This is an easy drink for me though. I definitely could have another which I normally won't say about a stout. It went well with what I was eating- sweet potato fries with a beer mustard dip."
"D - easily drinkable all night, but lack I'd feel might get boring."
"Thoroughly delicious, order it if you see it"
"Perhaps I've overrated the look and feel, if you consider nitro ""cheating," but for some reason the artifice really worked for me the evening I sampled this."
"Notes: Sextant is one of Herbie Hancock's lesser known albums, you either love it or you hate it. I'm kind of indifferent on the album, but not the beer. Check out both if you have a chance."
"D - Can definitely drink more, but not a whole lot of taste going on. Easy to drink, 5% stout though."
"I normally compare all Oatmeal Stouts to Young's Oatmeal Stout (my current favorite). This offering from Ballast Point did exceptionally well. I would love to do a side by side comparison. The relatively mild abv, combined with the excellent flavors make this truly a world-class beer. If only they could bottle this up instead of only being available on tap!"
"D: Not the most drinkable to be honest, pretty good overall though."
"Not my favorite brew from Ballast Point but a solid oatmeal stout that tastes better served this way than when I had it from a growler in the past, would drink again, recommended"
"Pretty solid Stout and quite robust in the taste profile at times. I wish that the body had a touch more depth to it but overall this drank like a champ on nitro!"
"D: A nice quaffable stout on nitro, a step up from Guinness IMO. I would like to try it on cask or out of the regular tap to see some more nuance and complexity in the flavour that I know this beer would have."
"Overall: A very good beer. A try it beer. Cheers!"
"Sample at Stone. Pours nearly black with a medium and somewhat foamy tan head that diminishes slowly. Small patches of lacing sliding down the glass. Coffee bean and malt aroma. Medium-bodied with a roasted character and flavors of coffee and malt, as well as touches of dark fruit. Light hops are present at times as well. The finish is roasty with a coffee aftertaste. Straightforward yet above average overall."
"D- Not horrible, not great. If they can tweek it to make it feel a little more rich in body then this'll become a really good stout."
"Tap @ O'Brien's. Pours black with a 2 cm tall tan head with nice lacing. Coffee, cocoa, brown sugar, with a lot of oatmeal. Taste is disappointingly weak. Roasted malt, the taste of ""Whoppers"" candy, oats, and a bitter finish. Good, not great."
"Very drinkable, I would reccommend for anyone who likes dark roast flavor in their stouts. Too bad we can't get this here in OR...."
"Roasty, dry and satisfying. A very enjoyable brew. A little less carbonation would make it even better."
"Decent."
"Not the revelation we all hope for when we hoist an unfamiliar beer."
"There is lots of fruit in the flavor too; prunes and raisins are the most noticeable notes. A touch of dusty chocolate is noticeable too. The beer feels very smooth as it hits the tongue, it is not quite creamy (it is too light for this, the lightness does make it really easy to quaff though). In body and mouthfeel the beer is quite light. The beer is actually served quite warm, meaning that it has been served a touch north of 60ºF (ºC). A bitter, burnt malt character couples with a hop bitterness in the finish. Overall this beer is quite dry, despite its fruity overtones. This is quite tasty."
"Overall: quite an accessible oatmeal stout. My girlfriend loved it."
"It poured a dark reddish brown color with a nice brown fluffy head that stayed till the end. There was not much going on in the smell department, just some slignt smokiness and burnt grain. The flavor was very good with just the right dose of sweetness and smokiness throughout, and the smoothe mouthfeel made this one go down very eaisy. A solid brew and one I will try again."
