"Makes for a great breakfast beer!"
""
"Black pour into SAPP, creamy tan head and thereafter good lacing. Whisper of roasted malt. Cereal and semi sweet malt. Lite mouthfeel. Overall, ok."

""

"Again, nothing exceedingly memorable about this brew."

"One of my go to stouts. You can find it in a 6 pack or by the pint for a great price ($3) great flavor, smooth, love this Stout"
""
""
"I loved all the characteristics of this beer. The only derogatory mark was it didn't finish as smooth as I would have hoped. It finished on the boozy side and not as thick and creamy as I had hoped for. Very good. Will search and buy more of this definitely."
""
""
"A little thin on the mouthfeel - like a porter - with roasted malts. Not much depth or complexity."
""
""
""
""

"Strong bite in the beginning, tastes more like an IPA then a stout. Disappointing because I was wanting a stout."

"Nice stout. Good straight clean stout taste!"

"o: a delicious stout with a great roasty character. wouldn't mind picking up a few more of these from the LCBO.  i'm glad they bring this beer in"

"Overall:  Pretty solid oatmeal stout.  Surprised to see it here in Orlando, but happy to have found it."
""
""
"Not a bad brew, there's a slight burnt smell upon first sniff, but it's not off putting. It goes down well, and is very sessionable. Overall, it's an A-."
"Overall - Big and bold with a slightly bitter finish. Dark yet chugable. Another great California ale!"

"8 Ball poured a very deep brown colour verging on black, with about 1/2"" of creamy tan coloured head produced. The head faded to a thin cap of foam after 3 minutes, and left considerable spotting and some modest lacing all down the glass. Its aroma was of dark coffee, dark European chocolate and earthy/herbal hops. 8 Ball's taste very much followed the aroma, with the addition of a certain sweetness which gave way to a mildly bitter dark coffee finish and aftertaste. As the beer warmed there was a bit of booze in the finish...which was surprising given its 5.8% alcohol content, but by no means unpleasant. The only weakness of this beer was its slightly thin mouthfeel, which contrasted noticeable with the creaminess of the head. Carbonation level was moderate, fully in keeping with the style. Overall this is a solid, flavourful stout and not overly hoppy in the finish...well worth a try. Currently selling for $4.80 per 650 ml bottle."

"Poured from the bottle into a shaker pint glass. Impressively dark and opaque, pitch black with just the barest hint of a red halo at the bottom of the glass. Aroma is surprisingly sweet, I get considerable caramel initially and then the more expected dark roast coffee and milk chocolate notes, along with a sour fruitiness that couples with the dark malts to yield a pomegranate molasses effect. Smells pretty fantastic if not a bit sweet for the style. No real hop aroma. Tastes similarly sweet and rich, with some diacetyl apparent and an ultra-smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Quite chewy but not heavy and very drinkable, with considerable residual sugars noted and moderate to high carbonation. Very nice tactile translation of the oatmeal stout style characteristics, although less dry and earthy than some (e.g., Rogue Shakespeare Stout, Samuel Smith's iconic example). The main flavors seem to be coffee with a little cream, light chocolate, butterscotch, and the tiniest tinge of dry ash. The booze is very well-concealed. Finish is roasty and sweet but here some floral earthy hops become apparent, cutting the sweetness and providing a contrast to the main show. I like this a lot, has some sweet stout character and the oats really do add an amazing smoothness. Then again, I have a soft spot for the sweeter side of dark malt and others may prefer something more dry."

"a straight forward oatmeal stout. 5.8% abv. Dark black in appearance with a nice off colored white creamy head. Taste of toasted malts and faint hints of chocolate. A super smooth stout, one of the lightest oatmeal stouts I have tasted, very drinkable. We finally got some rain here in San Diego and I went with this brew for our ""cold"" weather stint we have going over here. Lost Coast keeps it pretty simple and straightforward, this isnt the most complex beer out there, but its still damn good in its simplicity."
""
"Bottle: Poured a dark color stout with a medium light brown foamy head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma consists of light dry roasted malt with light bitter notes. Taste is a mix of roasted malt with light dry bitter notes and some residual sugar notes are also noticeable. Body is about average with good carbonation. Enjoyable and easily drinkable but a bit short on the complexity level."
"Enjoy!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I haven't had an oatmeal stout for quite some time, but this one is quite good. I'd be more than happy to drink this again and again. A nice after-dinner brew...or maybe breakfast!"
""
"O- outstanding. Seriously, buy this beer."
""
""
""
"There's nothing aggressive about Lost Coast 8 Ball Stout - it's one of the few Californian offerings not to make an extreme example of this potentially dark and decadent style. Instead it is a wonderfully approachable, agreeable rendition. It's an easy one to recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: If you don't mind a thinner body stout I would give it a shot. This one isn't very complex and wont be one that I will be returning to."

"PS - after reading other reviews, I wonder if I got a bad batch, as everyone else seems to be having vastly different experience (and I share my bottle with a friend, and we both didn't enjoy it)"
""
"Perhaps my review lacks the sophistication of others, but after tasting many porters and stouts- 8 Ball Stout is my number #1 because of it's dark, smooth, rich flavour. To be sure, this stout has alluring, complex tones in smell and taste and for all its boldnes-its dwell gently within."
""
"Overall, I liked the sessionable and tasty aspects on this stout and thought they were worked quite well. Hop character could be more interesting and forward I thought, and sometimes they struggled to cut the sweet chocolate notes, but this resolved itself. I think this is definitely worth a try for a well-made stout, not the most interesting stylistically, but it does drink quite nicely, and is certainly well above-average. 4"
""
"An excellent stout."
""
""
""
"This was a real shock as I picked it up in a mixed six pack but it really holds all the components I look for in a stout."
""
""
"Overall - Quite a good beer, and seeing that I had never seen in stores, thought it was worthy of a try. Glad I did because it's quite tasty and is a nice bridge in the stout world between the lower ABV stouts and the more serious Imperial Stouts."
"A decent stout. Lots of dark malt and roasted barley flavor with a light body to make it quaffable. Could be a bit heartier in the malt profile and the hopping rate, but still good stuff."
""
""
""
""
"Good brew for a good price (under $5, at least in Ontario). There are some more distinct brews to be had of this style, but this one was certainly enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, pretty good, but there are certainly better oatmeal stouts out there."

"SOLID; NOT MUST HAVE!"

"Looks good, smells and tastes OK. Overall its a big meh. It doesn't really excel in any category. The taste is just not much of anything. Very boring. Tastes like something you would get at a brew pub 15 years ago. Its just not big enough for today...or at least not for me."
""
""
"Overall this was a good oatmeal stout, needs a little more body and a touch more bitterness for balance."
"Pours nearly black with a very tiny tan head that hangs around the whole time. Lots of lacing is seen actually that settles ever so slowly back down. Very nice aroma of coffee, roasted malts with a hint of bitter chocolate. Taste is the same with just the right amount of carbonation for a stout. LOTS of black coffee flavor right up front on the tongue. Very pleasant overall with just a slight bitter finish."

"O: Very good but not outstanding across the board."
""
""
""
""
"My biggest gripe with oatmeal stouts in general is that they usually have a very watery mouthfeel with minimal flavor to back it up. Here, the mouthfeel is for sure thin, but there's enough going on that it's not bothering me. While it would probably be a stretch to call this beer ""complex," it has enough subtle, mild flavors working together that ""delicate"" might be more apt. Well done."
""
""
""
""
"O- Good oatmeal stout, Very easy drinking, not too sweet, balance is very nice"
"Had it with grilled turkey caesers salad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-An extremely pleasant stout to drink (and to look at!). Mediu Lacks any sort of harsh bitterness that sometimes overwhelms the palate. Not a complex ale, but an excellently executed one."
""
"O - I'll probably get this again. Its cheap and a very pleasant beer. Very drinkable. Could session this pretty easily."
""
""
""
"O- as i said. a really pleasant surprise. I wasn't expecting much out of this. It was kind of a blind pick during my bi weekly craft beer spree at Total Wine. But this is the type of beer that makes those leaps of faith worth it."
""
""
"Well, its not the best stout in the world. Making irish stout stew for st pats dsy and this wss the least expesive single at the store. Looks pretty nice in glass, nkce dark black with crothy tsn head. Sme, ls metallic and a litgle plasticy. Flavors are not off, just underwhelimng. I love stouts but this is a de ent stout at best."
"Good cocoa and fruit driven stout. The body is just a bit light for me but it is flavorful and that keeps it solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a ruby black with good amount of tan head and good retention. Hard to go wrong on stout appearance. Aroma is roasty with chocolate. Taste follows with roasted malts and definite chocolate dominance. Nice and dry with excellent balance. Mouthfeel is smooth and silky. Surprisingly refreshing for a heavy beer. Overall great!"
""
"Mouth feel is medium to slightly creamy light bodied. Moderate carbonation. A bit watery. No astringency with good drinkability."
""
""
""
"Way thinner than I want right now. smoothe enough with the oats. I like Lost Coast as a brewery (both most of their products, and the brewery/people who work there as well), but this stout just doesn't do anything for me. There are infinitely more appealing options available in my area (many of which are even more local than LC), although it's not an atrocious fallback if the only other options are BMC status"
""
""
""
""
""
" Overall a solid Stout, definitely a buy and taste for yourself!"
""
""
"This makes for an easy to drink stout by Lost Coast. I would definitely pick this one up again next time I see it on the shelf."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into stout glass. Black/brown that shows clear deep garnet red in light, with thick tan head that dissipates after a bit but leaves nice lacing. Smell is roasted coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Taste follows smell, almost so sweet I'd swear it was a milk stout. Mouthfeel slightly fizzy but overall nice and creamy. One of the better stouts in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I love this beer. If you are looking for a ""drinkable"" stout, this is it. As a stout lover, I also like that it is lower in alcohol which makes it a ""more than one"" stout."
""
""
""
"O - Enjoyable stout. Nothing earth shattering, but definitely something I could see myself drinking again. I'd like to try this one again on draft, because I bet it's a lot tastier."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"0- A decent, albeit run of the mill stout (I am sampling this after a Founder's Breakfast Stout though.)"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I really enjoyed this stout.... Not the best stout I've ever had, but I certainly liked it just like most brews I've had out of the Lost Coast Brewery there in good ol' Humboldt County."
"Pours dark black, smells of oak and wood. Taste of very high carbonation it needs to age a lot more. Bitter burnt coffee beans. Not good. Aroma- slight roasted notes, chocolate, metallics pitch black, no real head Taste- lactose, cream, slight chocolate, roasted notes Palate- decent body, nice mouthfeel,but not special either."
""
""
"O: This was a really nice, tasty stout that I'd try again... even in the summer."
""
""
"O - characteristic are more porter than stout, tasty none the less and worth a try but not something i would drink regularly"
""
"OVERALL: A solid, flavorful, and enjoyable stout beer. Something definitely worth checking out if you come across it somewhere. Glad I found this one. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A delicious oatmeal stout full of flavor and a pleasant aroma. Satisfying."
"12oz bottle with 04/17/12 on the neck written in super hard to read black ink. Pours a very dark brown, basically black color with a thin layer of tan head. Minimal lacing. Aroma is sweet, almost like an oatmeal cookie. Caramel, malts, chocolate and coffee. The taste is sweet malts with some chocolate and coffee. Earthy. Mouthfeel is a bit light for the style. Overall, decent Oatmeal Stout. I'm interested in trying the Imperial version now."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown appearing black, Light tan dissipating head that leaves light lacing. Light aroma of dark and roasted malts, chocolate. A dark stout, but light on flavor. Flavors that are there are very nice and well balanced with nice toasted malts, but the taste is very light and tame. Mouth fell is surprisingly light, but still has some creaminess. A pleasant, but not remarkable low ABV stout."
""
""
"O- It had the makings of a great stout, but a few trip ups downgrade it to merely good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It seemed that it just didn't quite add up, as if the brewer started out to make a stout, but changed his mind and tried to make an ale halfway through. It was neither creamy nor complex. I didn't finish even finish it, so I'll pass on this one in the future."
""
""
""
"In the land of stouts it isn't exactly complex. But it is a simple, to-the-point beer with admirable qualities. I'll definitely pick up more when I'm looking for something sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It's a solid stout offering but provides little depth; not much is alluded to but, still a fine beer regardless. 8-Ball Stout's real short-coming keeping it from greatness is the higher level of carbonation, obstructing the oats from fully participating in the mouthfeel. The creaminess is there in the nose but doesn't carry through to the palate."
""
""
""
"Roasted coffee up front, light maltiness in the finish. Very light in terms of the typical stout, light carbonation which adds to the drinkability. Not the smooth texture usually associated with oatmeal stouts, but an overall pleasurable experience. Rich, roasted malt flavors give way to an effervescent texture from the carbonation, and a smooth dry finish. Very drinkable as a session stout to those used to higher alcohol content Imperial stouts."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of coffee and roasted malts. Taste is strong coffee up front, roasted malts, a touch of chocolate. I did not detect the oatmeal in either the smell or taste. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not bad. Very drinkable. For me this beer is a little on the light side for me to actively seek it out again. This one can just be ranked as ""good"". As a side note, I've been fortunate to have also had Lost Coast's Bourbon Barrel Aged 8 Ball on tap, and that one is a superb imperial stout."
""
"Overall - Lost Coast plays it safe with a very traditional oatmeal stout; really no originality or creativity with this one. It's a good stout, but I can't call it great, not when it does nothing to distinguish itself."
""
"Overall: a tasty stout, this could easily be a go-to stout for me."
""
""
""
"Very drinkable stout."
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, and is expectedly smooth. Carbonation is surprisingly modest, leaving this feeling decent, but a bit slow/sluggish moving on the palate. Finish is dry."
""
"Overall, this is a very nice oatmeal stout. Definitely worth a shot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Clear and dark colour only shows ruby highlights at the edges of the glass when held up to light. Coffee-coloured head dissipates quickly and leaves no trace. Aroma of dark roasted malts with some barrel tannin undertones. Taste is well-balanced, with flavours of roasted and toasted malts blending nicely with the cooked oats and some smoky oak notes, all with an underlying dry backbone. The aftertaste is sweet and lingers for an impressively long time."
"I did like this brew but its quite overpriced here in Alberta at 18$ a 6er, with St Ambroise on the shelf for 12$ I doubt I'll drink it again"
"Stouts are my favorite. And this stout was surprise. On sale at Albertson's for only $2.99!!! Dark enough to to use for protection while watching a solar eclipse. Nice head...three fingers on a rapid pour. Nice lacing. Chocolate. Not as bitter as many stouts. Not as smokey either. Very enjoyable. Mouthfeel is such that you are in no hurry to swallow. Swish Swish Swish...enjoy...swallow - only if I have to. Ahhh...tasty! I can't think of a better bargain."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson brown with a 1 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a thin cap. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt and some slight cocoa and coffee aromas. Taste is of dark roasted malt, toasted oats, cocoa powder, and some ground coffee bean flavors. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good solid stout that is very easy to drink."
""
""
"O - Decent Oatmeal stout, but I want more toasted flakes and more oatmeal flavor."
""
""
"O: agood off-dry stout, good price point i would buy again"
"I wanted more malt and creaminess, instead a little more carbonation and hops were found here. Never the less you are left with a very sessionable good dark brew here. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very tasty brew from a company that I didn't like before. Makes me want to try others things from them."
""
""
"Pitch black with a khaki head. Nice looking pour with good lacing. Big carbonation bubbles in the head. Subtle coffee and roast aroma, nothing crazy here. This brew tastes great. A nice balance between coffee and dark chocolate. Some bitterness at the end. Feels kind of watery and doesn't have a mouthfeel that matches the great taste. Quality stout, but doesn't seem very 'stoutish'."
""
""
""
"Don’t really notice the oatmeal under all that roast. A bit simple and too thin. Still an easy all-arounder, though."
"This is an easy drinking very approachable stout. The flavors are well integrated and the beer is a serial repeater. Well done!"
""
""
"Overall, very tasty and drinkable, balanced and subtle. Slightly on the roasty side. Nice and drinkable."
""
""
"O the taste is good but it really needs some more body. Bottom line: Average. wouldn't go out of my way to drink it, but if it was my only option it wouldn't be a terrible one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very solid Stout. Great taste. With a little addition to the body could be outstanding. Easy drinking for a stout."
"O: tastes like a higher quality Sam Adams chocolate bock. Not my favorite, but it's drinkable, available, and on par with similar offerings in price."
"O: nice stout, heavy on the roast, nice drinkability"
"Overall a nice and easy to drink Stout with a nice rich smooth coffee flavor."
""
""
"O: This is a poor example of an oatmeal stout IMO, much less a stout. Too chemical, too thin, too much carb, little on the nose worth desiring."
""
""
""
"Trying Lost Coast 8-Ball Stout....and it is good. The beer pours a opaque dark with off-white head that isnt not lacing that well. The smell is very good....roast malt with slight smoke assistance. The taste is a roast malt with espresso boost...with slight Chocolate hints. The mouthfeel is medium...usually I like a bit more body. The carbonation level for this beer is good. Overall it is a decent stout....but not the best."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a standard pint glass. Pours a coffee-black color. A dark tan creamy head sits on top. The head eventually recedes to a wisp of cream colored bubbles. Random lacing. Smells of bitter chocolates and a hint of oats. This beer tastes pretty good, surprisingly to me. The chocolate bitterness is there as well as that sort of bitter Oreo cookie note. Burnt malts also. The mouthfeel is slightly more watery than I would prefer. Overall, not bad at all. I only bought one bottle o this, but it was worth it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is another stout I enjoyed, but I'm not sure if I'll seek it out again."
"This is a delicious stout from the folks @ Lost Coast up in Eureka."
"This black beer was poured for me at Tap & Mallet in Rochester. This oatmeal stout beer was poured in a pint glass. It came with a thin dark head and aromas of chocolate cordials, and vanilla on the nose. My first sip is creamy and thick with flavors of chocolate, cream soda, and a hint of malt."
"O: Excellent stout! Very smooth and easily drinkable."
"I bought this at my local Trader Joe's and for the price and overall taste, I think I'll buy more."
"O: Great oatmeal stout. Not super complex or fancy, just a smooth, creamy, easy drinking stout. I could drink about 50 of these."
"Thin bodied and above average carbonation starts off the taste. The flavor reminds me of iced coffee, both in taste and consistency. This is a weak stout, but it has the elements of a darker and drier dark beer."
"Surprizingly disappointing, since the ingredients are fully listed on the bottle and they should yeild an otherwise remarkable stout!"
"O: Really solid oatmeal stout that isn’t the most complex, but doesn’t have any outrageous flaws."
"Overall. Bottom line is that this stuff tastes good. Could drink more than a couple pretty easily :-)"
"Overall – One of the better beers I've had from this brewer. I'd drink it again for sure. Only needs a little improvement in the mouth feel department."
"Overall a good beer and decent stout that i might be inclined to try again."
"Will try again anyway."
"A decent though lightweight stout. There’s a bit of flavour here but it falls just a touch flat on the palate."
"(Bought in Manhattan, Kansas. Enjoyed at home in Oklahoma City)"
"Overall: Everything about this beer is just ok"
"O - Well, it's not expensive, if anything. For it's price, you could do a lot worse. I just can't see myself actively going out and getting a larger quantity. I think I'm just not an oatmeal stout person, so them's the brakes I suppose. Don't get me wrong, it's still good. I'd order at a bar if they had it cheap."
"The aroma was your typical oatmeal stout, though a touch more bitter then what I was expecting. Nice notes of lactose, chocolate and vinous hops. Some light grain notes as well in the finish. Rich, though not terribly filling. Lots of burnt and roasted malt flavors in here. Not as sweet as the aroma would have led me to believe it would have been, still though very solid in both bitterness and malt profile. Light notes of chocolate floating around, but again nothing terribly too sweet, more or less just enough to give a slight hint and a nudge in the right direction."
"Overall: A really nice oatmeal stout. Drink it warm, like in the old country and appreciate the flavors."
"O: Not impressed in any way. Maybe the OE 800 (8-Ball) of Oatmeal Stouts. For $1.49 I gave it a shot. Won't again tho. All together light in the ass."
"This beer pours a dark brown nearly black color. The head is one inch of light tan foam that recedes slowly into a nice cap of lacing. The aroma has hints of roasted malt and cream, but it is very faint. The taste is similar to the aroma. That is to say there isn't much there. I understand that oatmeal stout is one of the lightest stout styles, but this beer is too light in both flavor and aroma even for an oatmeal stout. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a somewhat watery texture, and low carbonation. Overall, this is a bland beer that I will not drink again."
"O: Excellent and luxurious beer that seems to get better as it warms up. One of my favorite low alcohol stouts and a great way to end an evening."
"Pours a kola hue with average carbonation that leaves behind little head or lacing,the smell is cocoa,oats,alcohol and spicy hops,the mouthfeel is light-medium bodied and has tastes of cocoa,bittersweet dark chocolate,bran and finished with a spicy,herbal hoppiness that counteracts the sweetness perfectly and overall even though ive had better this is still worth a taste as its very sessionable on a cold day like today."
"Got this in a trade. Aroma is rich and strong, smoky with a firm molasses component and tones of coffee and miso. It pours a deep, opaque sable almost as black as an 8-ball with a thick, if not persistent, tan head. Smoky flavor has coffee, unsweet chocolate, nutty, and toffee tones with hints of molasses and caramel. Texture is on the thin side for a stout, but still pleasing, smooth and subtly fizzy. Don't get behind the 8-ball - get this one in your belly!"
"Always fun to ask people if they wanna share your 8 Ball, am I right? It pours a straight onyx topped by a finger of dusty tan foam. The nose comprises cocoa, light molasses, roasted malts, and the lightest possible touch of mild charcoal. The taste brings in more of the same, with a bit more roast character, the addition of dark chocolate (which goes pretty well with the already-present cocoa powder), and without the charcoal, making for a slightly less complex but nevertheless tasty stout. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mostly smooth feel. Overall, a very nice stout. My only real complaint is that it's a touch thin, but not overly so, allowing this thing to still drink easily and be quite enjoyable."
"O-Not a fan. Being a stout I would expect much more in the flavor and more body. The flavor falls behind the aroma."
"Overall a nice stout, smooth, perhaps a little too straight forward, but decent enough as a go-to beer."
"This pours out as a black color with thick tan head. The smell has a nice chocolate and roasted malt aroma. The taste is of smooth dark chocolate and a slight burnt taste but creamy also. The mouthfeel is smooth and fairly light. The overall of this beer is that it's a pretty good stout and it has a good lacing too."
" O/A- Decent but I've had better. Its a little too sweet and thin for me, but it sure does look pretty and the roasted character is yummy. For the price it's hard to beat ($8/six pack in my area)"
"Overall - An okay stout I'd rather have rogue or samuel smith but a big step up from most other oatmeal stouts. That said go grab one and see for yourself."
"Overall i think this is a pretty good Sweet Stout, but the hollow mouth hurts it's overall score. I do though recommend you pick this one up if given the chance."
"D – This is a pretty decent oatmeal. It lacks a little to be upper tier but solid nonetheless. Definitely worthy of a few drinks."
"O: If you ever see one an old one covered in dust, buy it, they get slightly better, even at 6 years. Make sure it wasn't sun tanning the whole time though."
"pours dark very, small amount of tan head that fades quickly. smell was coffee, chocolate, malt, bit of hops. had a bitterness to it and a coffee aftertaste. good carbonation and great drinkability. quite enjoyable and overall decent stout."
"O: Not too shabby. At a buck a bottle at TJ's (I think that is what I paid)....this is pretty drinkable. I may need to try this again to get a better long-term feel for this one. But; this was pretty good today."
"Overall I would say try another Lost Coast beer, this one is ok, but I must admit the cool tap fooled me!"
"D - Not bad, it is a bit one dimensional but nice. I expected more complexity, especially in the flavor which is kind of weak. Still, it manages to develop a decent level of roasted malt character by the finish and there are no major flaws."
"D: The bottle actually has a sticker marking it at 7.1% Abv. instead of the 6.3% on BA. I really enjoyed this beer. Tons of chocolate in the taste would make this a great dessert beer."
"Dark brown, tan head, clumpy. Aroma was of heavily roasted chocolate malt. Doesn't have a distinctive coffee or chocolate bend to the flavor profile, nor is it hoppy. It is decently chewy, but a tad too thin. Has an off bitterness to it, paired with a gritty texture. Could get away with it moreso if it had a better viscosity, or thicker I guess would be more accurate. Decently priced at least."
"Overly carbonated for best mouthfeel and drinkability. Definitely easy to sip, but you do like to see more body and silkiness from a stout. Some citric hops add to the flavors from the nose. Dextrin as well. Nothing to sneeze at but a little undercooked. Give this a shot for a good price on a good stout."
"An Stout that leans more towards a Porter, lacking the roastiness but providing a decent amount of other dark malt character. Overall mocha characteristic to it. Would make a good local go-to stout, however not noteworthy enough to justify the import price on a regular basis."
"D: Not a bad stout, but it doesn't really come off as a good one or an Oatmeal stout. Wouldn't try it again - nothing special."
"Drinkability- A decent session stout. I can drink a few. This is ok but I was expecting more. Maybe a good beer to ween someone into stouts with out making them feel 10 lbs heavier. I will take a RIS anyday."
"D: Nice enough, not terrible, but nothing to rush out and by. A B stout which is fine at its price point."
"D- Yes, I would gladly have another one of these again."
"smooth body, lower carbonation. nice ""everyday"" stout, I imagine would pair great with food."
"Truthfully, there isn't anything to dislike, but there isn't anything that knocks me off my feet, either. But a knock-out is only worth a damn when you're in the ring, and this is a friend you can rely on anytime."
"I could drink this one again, and again. Overall a real good beer, could have some more coffee flavor to it"
" Drinkable but not a very robust representation of the style. There are better."
"Decently robust in flavor and not a bad oatmeal stout overall."
"D- Pretty easy to drink."
"D: I have to say these lost coast beers have definitely surprised all around and are better than I remebered. Real tasty and and drank good."
"Overall, above-average, but not necessarily something I'd seek out again. It is easy to drink, but not the most interesting."
"D: It is a drinkable beer, but there are better stouts out there."
"D-Besides the feel of the beer this one was right on par with what I was looking for, a fantastic beer that I'll most certainly try again"
"D: Meh. A decent oatmeal stout, but definitely not anything special."
"D: Best American Stout (this should not be an Oatmeal Stout) I have ever tasted (and I have consumed Rogue's Shakespeare, Sierra Nevada's, and North Coast's American Stouts). Just right!"
"Drinkability: There is a good balance with the tastes here, but the mouthfeel is more bubbly than I like. Although I can't put my finger on it, there is something that just comes up short here."
"D - A great stout. Great drinkability even for the higher ABV for an oatmeal stout. If you want a session stout this is it."
"An enjoyable enough oatmeal stout, the slight astringent sourness kind of adding a bit of complexity to the whole deal. Very dessert-ready, this 8-ball will satisfy your sweet-tooth, yet won't leave you in a sugar coma."
"Jet black with a very nice cocoa head on top. Good aroma-somewhat of a roasted and toasted malt scent with a very mild though nice espresso tinge. Killer roasted flavor-dark chocolate and coffee like flavors abound. Great roasted graininess with a soft, velvety oatmeal tinge. Nice, soft and smooth body. A damn killer oatmeal stout. 6.3%? this could be a very nice session beer for the likes of me! Great stuff..."
"Pitch black colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is hops and chocolate malts.Taste is cocoa,coffee,and light sweetner.Smooth and easy going down.Overall a decent beer that is solid but isn't going to wow you.I would recommend to try at least once and probably would buy again."
"Great sweet stout. Thankfully not oversweet. Poured with a fine, foamy, almost creamy light tan head that lasts and good lacing. Color is an opaque black brown. Aroma is an almost cloying sweet, cocoa, coffee, malt, toffee, tiny bit roasty. Flavor is not as sweet as nose might have me think. Body is great and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor and of short to medium in length."
"This beer is a great find for me. I love espresso and coffee and this beer has it down to an art. It is like drinking a cold, carbonated espresso!!!! Taste is a bit bitter on the finish, but matches the taste perfectly. Will definitely be having this one again. GREAT BEER LOST COAST BREWERY!!!!"
"D - This is a pretty tasty stout with some nice chocolate flavours, but it could be a bit sweeter. Definitely worth a try, but I do have a couple others that I would prefer over this one."
"Pours an unimpressive deep brown with a small fizzy head that laces a bit, but this is a stout. It should be big head and great retention. Aromas are muted, primarily of molasses and a bit of roast. Taste continues in the same manner, just overall an unimpressive and uninspired stout IMHO."
"I'm not much of one for darker beers, but I had heard good things about this beer. It pours a very dark brown as the scent of cocoa comes from the bottle. Upon tasting it has a fairly mild cocoa taste as well as a slight hint of coffee. It has a good thick texture that makes this an excellent beer for the winter. Definetly worth a try!"
"D- Decent stout and I certainly will return to, just wish there was more complexity and a bigger body"
"D - Easier to drink than other beers in the same style, not a bad thing if you ask me!"
"D: Average. An ok beer. There is much better in the style making this one less desirable."
"D- Very good on my taste buds. Would make an excellent pairing beer. One of the better stouts I have poured lately"
"Smooth, but a little thin when cold and when it warms it almost becomes slick. Not a bad beer, but fairly pedestrian for what it is. This would make a great starter to craft stouts."
"Verdict: Worth the price, but not elite."
"Drinkability - not terribly complex, but not bad for this type of brew. Aftertaste is manageable."
"Notes: A pretty good oatmeal stout, fairly typical for the style. Tasty beer worth a try although it wasn't quite as oatmealy or creamy as I was hoping."
"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a pint glass. The 12 oz bottle has a big 8 Ball on it, which I'll admit was the reason I bought it. The beer comes out of the bottle as a very dark brown liquid with a large head of tan bubbles, ranging in size from big to tiny. It beer smells chocolaty-sweet, and a bit powdery, like chocolate milk or hot chocolate mix. I can also detect the aroma of alcohol and dark roasted malts. The flavor includes notes of chocolate, both milk and dark, but I certainly wouldn't call it a chocolate stout. It's more noticeable as hints of sweetness and bitterness as opposed to actual cocoa flavors. The bitterness and alcohol are strongest as I swallow and both linger on. The malts have a slightly burnt quality to them; it's not quite roasted but nor is it outright charred. The body is on the lighter side of medium and is slightly creamy. Carbonation is low. A coating is left behind, but it isn't too significant. Some stickiness remains on my lips. Overall, it is a very drinkable stout. I could easily have a few rounds of this beer, especially with some burgers or steak. It would even go well with dessert! It's too bad this is the only bottle I have; if I ever get a chance, I certainly order this one again."
"6pak was gone way to fast.would like to see what else Lost Coast has to offer. something to drink all year long. would like to try and brew my own."
"D - easily drinkable but there are much better options out there"
"D - A very good stout with around average quaff-ability. It offers up great roasted malts in the taste although the aroma is quite soft. The price is excellent in my area of CA, 5.99$ a sixer! With that price I'd probably buy it again. Worth a try I'd say. Cheers!"
"d: A little too carbonated, that's my only gripe. Flavors are right on. I could drink a bomber of this over the period of an hour to an hour and a half. Solid oatmeal stout."
"D - Good flavors and delicious but could be better."
"Two fingers of rich brown color with a full range of bubble sizes and a slow dimpling down to a solid blanket across the surface, gives you some short but fat lacing streaks too. Full-on black liquid with a thin band of orange-yellow around the rims. More toast than roast in the nose, carob, mocha, milk chocolate chips, cookie batter, licorice before a brush of minerally earthiness, the hops present a pinch of pine sap and mixed white citrus, nothing major, fruit scents close to nonexistent. Medium-bodied, muscular and sets itself firmly in the mouth, the carbonation fine but persistent, keeps things on the straight and narrow from start to finish. More of a roast here, blending in coffee and dark chocolate with carob and molasses. Floral dimension spreads wider. This may spark the plum, cherry fruit some. More tar than mineral inside the sprinkle of earthiness. I don't have a problem with its moderate body per se, would like more flavors intensity at the end, though."
"Bottle. Pours a dark brown with a slight tan head. Had to pour pretty aggressive to get the head. Coffee and chocolate notes in the aroma maybe even some coconut but pretty faint to me. The taste is ok. Roasted malts are the first flavors that make an appearance followed by some bitterness from either the roast or the hops. Pretty smooth and velvety. Medium mouthfeel Not bad but somewhere in the middle."
"Fairly high carbonation and a light mouthfeel. Toasty oatmeal flavor up front followed by more dark chocolate and slightly bitter coffee. Long, smokey finish that grew more dominant as the beer warmed. Easy-drinking and somewhat reminiscent of Alaskan Smoked Porter (that's not a bad thing!)."
"D: A superb American stout, loaded with cookie sweetness and all the coffee and chocolate you expect with a complex hoppy bitterness that really rounds out this exceptional brew from Lost Coast, easily the best in their lineup."
"MF/D: an initial sizzle of light carbonation that fades into a very smooth finish at the tail-end of each sip. a decent stout."
"d-it's good, not great. doesn't make any mistakes, but doesn't really distinguish itself. either way, a very solid beer."
"D: Highly drinkable, this bomber didn't last long between two of us. Most stouts that I have had were considered RIS so this is a nice lower abv and lighter option."
"This one was very promising to me at first. Good aromas and flavor up front but the pale malts became overwhelming in both. I liked the aroma so much at first I kept the score a litlle higher but the taste was killed to the point I thought I was drinking a dark colored pale ale."
"A very good stout that begs for another sip"
"Not unpleasant, but a bit unbalanced for my palate."
"The flavors I describe should warrant a higher score, but the way they were exceuted and blended could have been better. I still think Winterbraun is the best beer I've tasted from Lost Coast. That being said, 8 Ball Stout is pleasant stout and fairly affordable."
"This was a single bottle the GF brought home from Trader Joes, after never having heard of the brewery. I'm surprised how great this beer is, and will definitely drink again."
"Drinkability is very good. Very well-rounded stout."
"Drinkability: great, abv is probably all that is going to slow you down here. Slightly filling."
"veru great beer, usually found at a lot of places in southern oregon/nor cal so its a great pick when choosing a very decent beer."
"Overall - I find this beer enjoyable, but to really stand out with a stout, the flavor has to blow me away. This is a good stout overall, but I need a little bit more to push it to the elite."
"D: decent."
"D - A good overall stout, but not one that I would buy over and over again."
"Pours black with an attractive brown head that retains fairly well. Aromas are similar to, but sweeter than, and more milk chocolatey than many oatmeal stouts. Very roasty. The flavors align with the aromas and linger long on the dark chocolate notes. Bodyweight befits a beer of its austerity. Excellent stuff. I've been buying 8 Ball for over 4 years now and plan to continue with it."
"It's not an Anderson Valley oatmeal stout (heh), but it is quite drinkable, ABV being the limiting factor...I'll easily finish my sixer in a day or two."
"Picked this brew up along with a few other things from Lost Coast this weekend. After my first try of one of their brews I was not sure what to expect with this Stout. This brew poured to a deep black color with a thick frothy light tan head that had great retention while leaving a lot of lacing, the look of this brew is good. The aroma here is nice, coffee comes immediately to my mind. Also there is a nice roasted to slightly burnt malt aroma there and a slight hop presence. The flavor is very nice, this is one easy drinking brew. The coffee and chocolate notes from the malt are very inviting. The astringency and slight smokiness is very light and serves this beer well. Somewhat sweet flavor that goes well with the slight hop end. Now I really like the flavor here but do think if it is based on a American Stout there would be a larger hop presence at the end but I am unsure on the age of this brew. While I do not feel that most people would think that this brew is complex it has the flavors that I really hit the mark for me as a stout. I would get this offering again from Lost Coast."
"Buy Again? Yes"
"A malty, yet well-balanced smooth easy-drinking stout with nice chocolatey notes."
"This poured a dark black with a very thin tan head that faded fast to just a ring. The nose is slight java, I can't pick up much anything else. There is a good roasted malt flavor with some java and chocolate. It does seem like it is missing something. It has a smooth but not heavy mouthfeel. All in all, not bad but not great."
"This 8 Ball stout has a dark color with a striking resemblance to a mug of A&W Root Beer. It has a slight nutty aroma, not overpowering. Wellbuilt beer with a smooth, chewy taste. I was very impressed with the great taste considering the weak aroma. One of the better Stouts I've sampled, I would definitely buy this again."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a deep dark oil color with a 1 finger creamy off white head that settles into a nice quarter inch cap. Very creamy consistency present. The aroma is very faint. There is some bread and yeast aroma along with some light roasted malt notes and a mild burnt caramel smell. The taste is creamy and has a decent balance to it. A little roasted malts, some chocolate, and a hop finish to it. The feel is creamy, but a presence of carbonation in the back of your mouth. This is an OK stout, but I have had some that have more complex aroma and taste. Worth a try."
" ~ This is one of the better stouts I;ve had the lurury to enjoy. My thanks to Lost Coast Brewery and even more thanks to my ""brother", Tim, for this great Christmas Gift."
"D: Pretty drinkable for a stout, but not overly heavy. I could have a few of these."
"M: Not at all bad, just a hair watery and grainy for what I expect from an American Stout."
"D: This is a great beer on tap - nicely blended, some sharp flavoring, somewhat filling. I'm a fan of this one."
"salud!"
"I can't think of too many situations where I would crave a stout as mild and watery as this one."
"Simple and tasty works every time."
"It comes with a nice dark body and pours with a minimal head. has aroma of malted hops and coffee, but surprisingly enough, i never really get a chocolate taste or smell. the aroma is weak at best for a stout. its easy on the mouth with a really silky feel, and swallows smooth. definately a good one to have a few of, and of course me being a local to the brewery, i for sure have had a few!"
"Drinkability is good. It goes down smooth and has a nice taste. I could have a few more, however its not as complex as others I've had. Not bad, but not amazing."
"Poured a great deep brown/black color, although with just a bit of initial head and no lacing. Great scent, a wonderfully deep burnt malt aroma with nice hints of coffee. Very nice deep taste, excellent coffee/burnt grain with a slight hoppiness; just a bit of alcohol tinge. A bit rough going down from the cloudiness, but still nice. Excellent stout."
"D-This is a very drinkable stout. One of Lost Coast's better offerings and will be enjoyed often this fall and winter."
"This beer is very drinkable. I will definately have another in the future. Sadly, it was my last one."
"I don't know. Decent ... certainly a good price ... but nothing to write home about."
"Drinkability: This is a good beer, but feels slightly misclassified. Enjoyable, but a bit too sweet and tarty for my taste."
" and mild carbonation."
"12 oz. Black pour, light cream head. Aroma is subtle roast and dark chocolate, a little lactose. Tastes coffee and slight chocolates, pretty balanced with carbonation. Almost medium bodied. Don't remeber this one registerig in above 6%. Real drinkable and pretty sure abv is lower than listed. Good for the style. Nothing real extreame here, may be good for someone just adventuring into dark beers or someone who prefers lighter styles."
"Poured into a glass. The beer is Dark Brown almost black With a thin brown head that fades quickly with no lacing. The tiniest bubbles come up from the bottom. The pungent sweet smell of molasses mixed with the tanginess of alcohol rises up from the beer to meet your nose. Creamy and nutty up front with roasted malt. Followed by the sweetness of alcohol and a long moderately pleasant bitter aftertaste that reminds one of over charred food. Pleasant in the mouth with full body. A decent stout, but too sweet for me. A fan could easily put down a few of these in a session."
"Overall: Got this on special as a 6-pack. I'm glad I did. It's got enough body and flavour to make it a sipper that you could sip a lot of."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into a nonic pint glass. The stout appears a clear dark brown color with about two fingers of frothy ecru foam. The head lingers for a bit before settling to a thin layer. Nose and flavor are of dark roasted grain and malt, bittersweet chocolate, medium roast coffee beans, pleasantly bitter. Somewhat light carbonation, but still a notch better than medium bodied. Tasty stuff, worth checking out."
"A good stout but I would buy something else for the price."
"Damn...wish this was slightly more affordable as it is very nicely done."
"This is a cery clean stout slight coffee taste, but not too over-powering. Slightly sour taste stays with me, but I don't exactly count that as a downgrade. Basically this is what guinness would be if it were a much better beer. This might be my favorite lost coast brew, and this might be my current favorite american stout."
"-Bye"
"This is a tasty stout with a little bit of the roughness to challenge the tastebuds. A drinking stout for sure but the roasted malt and the finish is big and pronounced. There is a chocolate side to the beer but the main flavour is roasty and toasty. I liked the fact that the flavour profile is big and the beer stays in your mind after it is gone."
"D. A really good stout. I like that it is not very sweet. The taste lasts a good while. It is slightly filling."
"M/D - light bodied for a stout, a bit of dryness that makes it not as smooth as I like. Overall not bad, but there are better."
"Mouthfeel & drinkability - Seems a little bit oily on the tongue. Creamy mouthfeel with a medium body. The relatively low ABV helps make this even more drinkable. I'm pretty impressed by this one. The 8-ball on the label made me second guess before picking it up...I'm glad I didn't judge this book by its cover. An excellent example of an American Stout!"
"It has a nice flavor and while not sessionable, goes down well."
"I'm enjoying drinking this but I don't know if I'd seek it out. Good but not great"
"One of my favorite stouts for a while, had another one last night, so thought I would review it. Poured a pitch black in my tulip glass, like well, and eight ball. A frothy tan head floated on top. Smell was a little chocolately malt. This brew really shines with its complex and ever changing flavor. First poured, its rather coffee dominated with a little bitter chocolate and a litte sweetness. As it warms, the chocolate starts to dominate and a raspberry or blueberry note comes into play. Nice creamy mouth feel and a smooth drinakble brew with all the roasted malt goodness going on."
"Poured very dark almost black. The initial taste is a pleasant blast of coffee and roasted malt, it also finishes off with a very pleasant and balanced blast of hops. I was pleasantly surprised with this brew. I find their other brews generally unimpressive but Lost Coast stepped up their game on this one. It's a nice, cheaper, alternative than the ole classic ""go-to"" oatmeal stout-Sam Smith. Overall, I will definitely buy again."
"Felt that the taste waned too easily for a stout"
"D - Tasty straight-up American Stout from Lost Coast with a pleasant chocolate and nutty characteristics. This would be nice on nitro!"
"Mourhfeel is full and creamy, one of the best in an American Stout I have had yet. Carbonation is spot on and makes the beer smooth and thick, chewy and creamy....excellent."
"Pretty good stuff. I liked the thick mouthfeel and drier finish. A nice, solid stout that I would certainly purchase again."
"D- Not bad, something that I wouldn't mind enjoying again."
"Somewhat light for a stout, but a good solid drink. Pours nice and dark, smell isn't all that strong, but the taste and drinkability make up for that. Not my favorite, but one that I would never turn down. Carbonation seems a bit lacking to me sometimes...much better from the tap then from the bottle in my opinion."
"D: not the most complex stout and somewhat mild in regards. Still, just a great drinker all around and a solid showing"
"Other comments: This is one of those that takes you by surprise. By sight and smell, it's a bit pedestrian. Then you taste it and you go ""Ooh!"" and your eyes kind of widen. Sip, sip, sip and suddenly the beer is gone and you feel a little sad."
"a pretty decent stout. nothing really stands out about it but it's full in flavor and in body. a strong, simple example of an american stout."
"Pours a dark brown with caramel edges, a cocoa brown cap leaves some stringy lacing as it slowly recedes. The nose is semi-sweet chocolate with subtle coffee notes. This is a surprisingly complex Stout. Tootsie rolls and vanilla pudding with small amounts of hazel-nut coffee and citrus hoppage, this is a winner. The body is full of life,creamy, bitter and tickling the taste buds from start to finish. Damn close to the most drinkable Stout I've ever had."
"Pretty good stout from a great brewery."
"Pours an attractive black color with decent tan head that dissipated fairly quickly leaving a thin film along the top. Pleasant aroma of chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts. Flavor is the same and very balanced. Mouthfeel is good. This is a very nice stout."
"Oily black pour with a miniscule tan head. Not really all that sweet for being a supposed sweet stout, but rather very malty and flecked with tastes of chocolate and coffee. Everything just runs together perfectly in this one, and I could drink the hell out of it because of the low abv. And on many nights I have done just that."
"The milky and smooth feel is almost TOO drinkable for a stout. This is a smooth, sweetish drinkable stout. Milky and very pleasant."
"(rated Aug 5, 2008)"
"A terrific stout. Dark black pour with no head. Aroma of chocolate and caramel with some burnt coffee. Taste is smooth. Chocolate and roasted malt and strong, but with a bitter finish. Not too heavy to border on the Imperial A sweet stout that keeps to its roots as a stout instead of being a weak Imperial"
"Out of bottle that was a lovely birthday gift this beer was a deep, opaque black with a tan head. Short on the retention but some scattered streaks of lacing from the thin ring. The aroma was dry, roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate and coffee. The flavors were very similar with the addition of some alcohol heat and a bitter, slightly acidic finish that lingered on and on. Classic. The mouthfeel was a little off for me because I though the med/high carbonation a little too much for the style. Otherwise, however, it was full and on point for the style."
"8/4/8/4/15 (3.9/5)"
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/almost black with a half inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both OK. It smells sweet and malty, like chocolate, roasted malt and some coffee. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and a bit of hops noticable in the slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth and has average carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and easy to drink. It's quite sessionable for a stout. Overall I think this is a decent stout, I'd buy it again in the future."
"D: Pretty drinkable for a stout, probably will get again. Not the best to warming up, but I guess I'll just have to drink it quicker."
"Beer poured black as night with a nice long lasting tan head. Nose is of malts with a hint of mocha coffee. Taste is of roasted chocolate malts and coffee complimented by a mild dose of west coast hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and quite smooth from the oats. Overall drinkability is good. This is a nice little stout that I could definitely see myself sampling more of in the future!"
"Nice chewy feel and still a light easydrinking stout."
"Appearance is an inky-like black-brown with a frothy tan head. Good lacing. Aroma is full of yummy roasted dark malts, bitter chocolate and a hint of smoke. A bit low on hop aroma which is a signature of American stout. Taste is a wonderful mix of roast malts, dark bitter chocolate, and in the background some notes of red wine like a cabernet or merlot. Medium hop bitterness but low hop flavor. Nice full mouthfeel finishes somewhat dry leaving you yearning for more of those wonderful flavors. Watch out for this big boy at 6+% ABV. This is an very tasty stout and if they ramped up the hops a bit this would be a picture perfect American stout."
"Easy drinking stout, not overpowering so if you are looking to drink many and want something more than a Guinness this is a nice choice."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this stout doesn't overload you with sweetness or heaviness, which makes it more poundable than most stouts. It's worth drinking for a long time if you're in the mood for the style."
"The beer poured an opaque black with a tan single-finger head. The smell is some very heavily roasted malts with a bit of coffee. The taste starts off with a sweet/slightly bitter mix between milk and dark chocolate and ends with some coffee flavor. The mouthfeel has some nice thickness with surprisingly fine carbonation. This is a pretty drinkable stout, it would probably be a good intro beer to someone who doesn't think they like dark beers."
"Not a bad stout, but a little above a good session level. A good mix of the burnt malt and roasty coffee flavors. Very enjoyable if you like stouts."
"12 oz bottle. Pours opaque pitch black with 2 cm tan foamy head that is mostly diminishing. Aroma of sweet fruit and coffee mostly. Initial flavor is malty and fruity, turning to dry bitter chocolate with a hint of coffee and oats. Moderate aftertaste. Light lacing, light carbonation, light on alcohol, and medium, creamy body. Overall, a pretty decent beer and a great choice if you like a tasty, creamy stout."
"My uncle had a suped up Chevy Chevelle when I was a kid with an 8 ball on the shifter. I thought he was the coolest. He was. So is this delicious stout from Lost Coast."
"Well done beer. Similar to a Rogue Chocolate stout but backs off alot on the IBUs."
"2	D too tangy. if I'm in the mood for a stout i wouldn't reach for this. if I'm in the mood for 	a good ipa or apa I'll go for a good ipa or apa."
"One of the best domestic craft stouts on the shelf."
"Pours a dark brown with a dense tan head. Arome is medium sweet roasted malt and chocolate. The Flavor is mildly smoky and has a nice roasted malt base with light chocolate smoothness and just the right amount of bitterness. Finishes long, slightly acidic and smooth. Medium bodied, slick texture."
"Slightly warming, fairly smooth with a medium full body & light effervescence. Good stuff, not great, but quite good."
"Pretty good stout. I'd drink it again."
"Drinks easy, not a great stout, but worth a few pints"
"the drinkability of this beer is pretty good. nothing offensive about it at all and it goes down easy. at just over 6%, i could drink a few. i'm glad i got to try it, but wouldn't seek it out."
"Dark coffee brown as it pours into the glass with a quickly dissipating creamy tan head. Not much aroma at all, just a bit of toasted, not quite burnt barley. More carbonation than in many oatmeal stouts; I look for oatmeal stouts to be creamy, this one isn't. Taste is decidedly non-sweet--in fact, it's almost savory/salty. Not especially bitter, either. The finish is nicely dry and the aftertaste is nicely roasty, making the best part of drinking this beer the few seconds after swallowing. I love stouts and while this isn't a bad beer, I wouldn't go out of my way to have it again."
"Drink em if ya got em..."
"Very easy to drink, but I'd like to drink something that pleases me more. (But, thats's just me.)"
"I would recommend this beer; I bought this bottle at 3 Cellars in Franklin, WI."
"M + D: A little lighter bodied, carbonation is also tame. Maybe a better cask performer, not much going on. Decent overall, and I like it... but not often. Mediocre, but not bad."
"The taste is malty but very dry, like unsweetened caramel. The carbonation is subtle, with a smooth mouthfeel. This would be an amazing session beer. More please."
"Excellent interpretation of a stout. There is a little bit of everything, but it all works together. Body is light and narrowly avoids becoming watery. I'm not saying it's mind blowing or expanding new horizons, but it is very enjoyable and recommended."
"Nice but unidimensional, roasted malt aroma opens to a medium bodied brew with a pleasant but not very deep or complex taste mainly composed of roasted malts, some bittersweet chocolate and coffee. All in all a decent stout."
"Tastes of roasted malts, chocolates and a pretty noticeable bitterness (in a good way). I found it a little thin, but still creamy (if that makes sense). Very drinkable."
"Medium to thick body, with lowish carbonation add to the smoothness that the flavour brings. Definitely an easy drinking stout, no complaints when this is in my glass."
"D - Kinda bland in a wierd way. Not even sure how to describe it... I wouldn't even think a stout could be made to taste this little."
"Very drinkable, a good stout. seemed to be easy to sip, or have a couple without much trouble. its been a long while since i had a good, solid stout. i am quite pleased with this offering and hope to try again soon. enjoy."
"Pours a deep black with a nice dark brown head. Aroma is of dark chocolate notes and minimal hops. Taste prunes? Dark chocolate with currants? Cadberry's? Rich lush silk mouthfeel. Drinkability-Guinness? No thanks-give a pitcher of this brew and call it a night"
"An easy drinker."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. The color is dark brown with a creamy tan head that sticks around for quite a while. The nose of this stout is sweet, figs and molasses, followed by nice espresso aromas. The taste is toasty malty and sweet followed by nice balanced finished. It is medium to full bodied and has a slightly creamy texture, but less than some stouts, this can still be refreshing. This is not a bad offering from Lost Coast, a stand up stout"
"Medium in body, silky smooth, creamy, and rich. Alcohol is not at all present, though you are expecting it. Almost like a ""baby"" RIS. Incredible drinkabilty - wonderful flavors and complexity, but still sessionble at 6.3%. Quite refreshing as well. Gets just a little cloying by the end of the glass. Top notch - if this was available in my area I would try to always have a few on hand."
"I had this in Portland, and didn't think anything good--nor bad--of it at the time. Maybe this bottle is a fluke. If I have another opportunity to try it out, I will. And if my future experience is different, I'll update it. Otherwise, it stands."
"D: There is nothing really limiting the sessionability of this beer, although it didn't really ""wow"" me."
"d: If this was a local offering, I'd drink it often. Thanks to tayner for this one."
"This poured opaque black with only a bit of light tan head. It smelled like sweet molasses and dark bitter chocolate malts with some toasted oatmeal sweetness. It tasted like a good mix of dark chocolate and robust roasted coffee, although the flavor faded some as I drank it. It was watery with a bit of carbonation and a bitter but short aftertaste. Overall this was a solid stout that was very clean and easy to drink. I would love to try a thicker and more powerfully flavored imperial big brother to this beer."
"Not a great stout by any means but decent."
"Enjoyable brew if you like the chocolate stout taste."
"Overall: This would be a more drinkable stout if it weren't more than six percent alcohol. A more vigorous pour would probably have smoothed out this brew. I imagine a draft version might be more impressive. In the bottle I think this compares to Trader Joe's Stockyard Oatmeal Stout which can be for $3 less a six-pack in my area."
"Pretty disappointed in Lost Coast's Oatmeal Stout - sorry guys."
"Nice black opaque pour, with a medium lasting tan head. Smell wasn't the strongest but was nicely of roastiness, some coffee, and definite sweetness present too. Taste was roasty, light coffee flavor, and fairly sweet overall, with a light bitterness and light chalky, drying finish to it. Medium to thick body, but medium to high carbonation as well. Mouthfeel is good, even though its more carbonated that expected. A really nice sweet stout worth getting."
"Mouth feel is rather disappointing considering the ""thick"" look when poured and the very dark color. I guess I made an assumption. There is a slight amount of carbonated bite but not alot of complex flavors. Drinkability is pretty good but I found this beer a little watery despite all the other characteristics."
"Overall, an excellent easy-to-drink stout that is full of flavors, but not overly harsh."
"Black and tan body and head. Roasted black malt and bitter chocolate malt nose with some sweet vanilla. The same in the taste, along with a light fresh ground coffee bitterness that finishes a bit dry. A watery medium body has some large bubbled carbonation. A decent offering of the style."
"12 oz. stubby... brewed with pale malted barley, chocolate and roasted malts, oatmeal, and Pac NW hops. It appears jet-black with medium carbonation, and an inch of yellowed-cocoa head that delivers nice lacing. The bouquet is roasted, chocolatey, and hoppy, but is a bit subdued. Not too flavorful when cold, but as it warms it reveals notes of citric hops, backed by charred and chocolate malts, hints of coffee and dark fruits. However, it is a bit watery and seems fully attenuated - needs a bit of sweetness for balance. The body is light - too thin for the style I feel - with high carbonation, quite dry, and imparts a medium finish. Overall it's not too bad, but is a bit rough around the edges and almost harsh when served cold."
"Pours thick and black into a pint glass. No head whatsoever, very little lacing. Smells highly of roasted barley and coffee. Taste is refreshing and with only slight bitterness. Carbonation is quite low and the mouthfeel is smooth but dry. Very drinkable even with the somewhat high alcohol, which, by the way, is not obvious from the taste."
"Pretty good. Definitely will be a go-to beer if I'm in he mood for a nice, thick, flavorful stout. The 6.3 ABV also means that one will do ya, but one or two more aren't going to kill you. I like it."
"I would definitely want to have this beer again and would recommend it."
"Dark black body with ruby notes at the edges. There is a bit of tan head on the top. Where the light shines through at the edges there are visible flecks floating around. The smell is decent but isn't strong enough. There is a touch of roasted malt and maybe a touch of caramel in there. Not a bad flavor at all. There is a good caramel sweetness with a nice complementary roasted malt. Medium bodied and decent drinkability"
"D- Very nice stout. I tend to like things from lost coats. It was very drinkable not to heavy but enough flavor to make it enjoyable."
"Overall a great oatmeal stout, very drinkable for this style, certainly wont have any trouble getting through this sixpack, and will buy again in the near future."
"Pours very dark with a thin, coffee-colored head. Lots of big bubbles and almost no lacing on the sides of the glass this time around. It usually shows off a nice thick head. Smells starts of a roast malt and finishes with a fine smell of chocolate and coffee. Great mouthfeel, with a good amount of carbonation. Definitely not a ""smooth"" stout. Taste of chocolate, roasted walnuts and a bit of coffee. Aftertaste is of dark roasted malts and almost a yeasty finish."
"D: This is one bitter stout. It is one dimensional and uninteresting. I will leave it on the shelf for someone who likes a bitter brew."
"D: Pretty easy to drink..."
"D: Will be buying again and recommend as a good stout."
"650ml bottle. Pours an opaque black with an ample tan head that fades moderately fast. Some lacing observed. The aroma is of roasted coffee with a bit of molasses. Flavor featuress burnt toast, coffee, walnuts, dirt and some bittersweet chocolate. Moderately hopped. Mouthfeel was full and satisfying. Finish was long and glorious. This is one very nicely well balanced stout. Recommended, I will drink again."
"Drinkability: I'm done trying this beer....the grimyness and overly burnt taste pushes me away from this"
"I bought two bottles of this in Indiana last year. This is the first I have opened. Looking forward to the 2nd."
"D - It isn't awful, but I don't think I will have this again, the mouthfeel is really bad. It is an okay beer, I could see someone else liking it, but it is definitely not for me."
"Overall, a pretty good beer. Its refreshing to see a brewer (especially one on the left coast) to still be making a stout without ""imperializing"" it. Definitely one of the better beers I've had from Lost Coast.... but they need to clean up the ferment a bit. Those fruity flavors have got to go! Without them, this could be a damn good stout I think. I'd buy it again, but I won't be rushing out for more"
"Dark brown/black color with a whispy & fizzy tan head and good lace. The aroma suggests charcoal/smoke, malt and brown sugar. It has a smooth feel with light carbonation and a cherry/raisin flavor that often masks the malt qualities a bit. It finishes with a pretty heavy bitterness but remains fairly drinkable for a stout. I detected some buttery hints despite the tangy overtones. It's kind of different, definitely recommended for a try."
"3 Finger brown head quickly disapating. First one I had was warmer than what I normally sample at. Roasted chocolate and oatmeal aroma. Opaque black, one of the most ever opaque. Thin/light mouthfeel. Some spotty lacing. Leaves a slick palate. Alcohol warming effect. Slight sting on conditioning, not bloating though. Toasty porter at the end and aftertaste. Drinkability is high altogether. Perfect balance between hop/malt/chocolate/oatmeal. Had 2 cooler ones later on with my lovely friend. then finished the final 3 later at home... Definitely NOT one-dimentional. A little astringent."
"D - Could anything be more drinkable? This is mellow, creamy, complex, and it doesn't tax your taste buds over the course of a session. Not the heaviest hitting stout, but one of the most tasty and drinkable IMO."
"The mouthfeel hit the roof of my mouth and didn't stay long."
"This is a delicious beer. I love it. Good, solid sense of roasted malts. Perhaps the most striking thing is the coffee tones that it delivers. There is a fairly faint sense of chocolate, more noticeable in the aftertaste. It pours a thick creamy head, smells nice, not as strong as I might like, but good. This, I believe, is the first beer I have had from the Lost Coast Brewery & Cafe. They have certainly earned themselves onto my list of breweries to look out for."
"Pours an opaque black with deep orange edges and a half inch tan head. The smell is of coffee and dark chocolate bitterness. Tastes of roasted malt and cocoa bitterness with some hop notes in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is velvety from the oats, although a little on the thin side. Very smooth and stays on your tongue. Overall, a tasty and robust stout I'd have again."
"This was an oily black pour with a thick tan head. The aroma is malty and slightly smoky. The taste is sweet and smoky, which works well for this brew. The mouthfeel is heavy and a bit chewy. Overall, I think that the taste is interesting and compelling. I prefer heavier beers and consider this to be very drinkable."
"Pitch-black motor oil in color, with a 3/4 inch off-white head that quickly dissipates into a slight collar. Missing some of that big creamy cap that I see with other stouts. A big sniff presents brown sugar, molasses, a touch of butterscotch, and a tad of bittersweet chocolate. Though I am no stout pro by any means, it strikes me as a bit of a departure. First sip: right off, I get some of that brown sugar and toffee-like characteristics, but the middle is a strong fruitiness, some berry and (am I crazy, here) some raisin? Finishes with a quick slap of liquorice and the faintist hint of chocolate. I'm stumped, honestly. It seems to have more in common with a dubbel or quad than a stout. All of the quintessential things I would look for are absent. And then to compound the crime, it resembles a Belgian, but not a very good one either. Body is medium, with not much in the way of carbonation or hoppy tingle. A bad bottle, maybe? I can't tell. But I am very much underwhelmed."
"This is the wimpiest stout I have ever drank. If you are a wimp beer drinker and go for the girly drinks, you'll love it. I had to stop and double check that I wasn't drinking Bud Light. For my stout taste, nothing compares to Guinness. Don't waste your money on this one."
"D - a good drinking stout, goes down smooth and easy."
"D - A wise choice for those who like a dry roasty stout. An extremely smooth roasted and drinkable stout in every sense."
"Black in color, almost no light gets through the mug. Cream colored head which dissapates fairly quickly with very little lacing. Smells of roasted malts, coffee and hints of spiced fruits. The taste starts out with a strong coffee flare followed by a slightly bitter hoppy kick. There is quite a bit of carbonation and it is fairly thick. It is a decently drinkable beer, easy to sip on but 1 bomber seems to be enough."
"I would think that Lost Coast has better offering than this stout."
"D: Fantastic.For all the reasons I mentioned. In a word smooth."
"D - This is a very good stout. Great sweet chocolate and malt taste."
"D - all in all, a good stout. I will probaly drink this again. Ranks slightly above average in the category."
"Good carbonation that works in an interesting fashion with the almost fruit-like/yeasty qualities in the finish. Pretty good throughout. Different and unexpected but likable."
"this is a nice stout. the drinkability as with any stout grows with warming. at low temps. this beer is good yet not outstanding. After warming a bit, like any good stout it grows in flavor. With very heavey malt flavors n some oatmeal flavors with a touch of chockolate it is a good change up in stouts. Once again when it comes to good beers you get what you pay for. this is a very good beer that pours up thick with a small head and very dark. The smell of the beer is great. the mouthfeel is very smooth and drinkability is wonderful. A must try if you like stouts."
"D - Decent taste, but too Acidic to drink a lot of"
"D: Very easy to drink. Smooth."
"D: Extremely complex for a smaller stout. Drinkibility is high and has a medium body for a stout. I lliked this brew but it lacked in the finishing department. Recommended."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark brown/black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tannish head, which leaves some nice sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is of nice roasted malt, chocolate, and toffee/caramel. The taste is malty with a slight roasted feel, and mostly toffee/caramel with a nice touch of chocolate. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a exceptional stout, very true to style."
"A medium bodied stout, but it has so much going on. This is one of the most perfectly balanced stouts in my opinion. Very enjoyable. Very drinkable whatever your drinking speed."
"Poured into a pint glass, pours a black as hell pitch black with a fluffy carmel colored head that leaves thick lace on the glass. Smell is of bitter bread with hints of choco in the whiff. Taste is very malty and bready with a bit of a alcohol burn. This is one fine tasting has a coffee aftertaste which I enjoy greatly. This is my favorite brew from Lost Coast and savor each and every time I enjoy this american classic."
"The flavor is sweet and as creamy chocolaty as the smell. The 6.3 ABV is well hidden. A good drinker."
"Thanks to Wsatch for this sample!"
"Heavy carbonation masks the taste initially but eventually a roasted, well balanced flavor emerges but this beer could still use a kickstart. Aftertaste is dry and warming and certainly saves a bit of face for this otherwise weak, anonymous stout. Mouthfeel is thin but smooth. I'll give this another shot in a few months or so but a bit disappointing."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Drinkability - Very drinkable beer. Nothing outstanding but quite quaffable."
"Musings: A nice stout. The smells and the tastes are full bodied - but the mouthfeel doesn't match up."
"Though not what I'd consider a typical stout -- taste-wise -- this is still an enjoyable one. I think it's quite accessable and would especially appeal to those not as keen on the heavier stouts. Plus it's a thoroughly enjoyable beer for those of us who do like all kinds of stouts..."
"Very tasty and drinkable stout. Quite sessionalbe, even at 6.3%."
"Pours pitch black with a nice 4 finger rocky light brown head. Aroma of molassas, pine, oak, raisin, and smoke. Taste is mostly the same but with chocolate and coffee notes coming through. No fruity or floral type notes at all, this is strictly a heavy dark beer. Carbonation level is good, alcohol is only mildly apparent, mouthfeel is somewhat slick. Very enjoyable."
"This is a very nice American Stout. Not really heavy, and that lends this one to being very drinkable and session worthy. This isn't going to wow you, but it is good, and enjoyable."
"D: I've had quite a bit of imperial and double stouts of late, so it is nice to have a subtle, well-roasted stout that doesn't knock me out."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkabilty: This beer is very smooth. The beer has no over the top flavors or smells. This is a very fine stout and if I had access this could easily become a regular. This beer is very easy to drink and is a solid offering."
"A very good but not great stout in my view. A little too sweet for me to want to go beyond one."
"Same very dark, and very thick look. Not much head, but then that is a problem with draft pours....they try to give your your money's worth so carefully fill it to the brim. Nose of chocolate and coffee. A little fruit there too. Mouthfeel is very rich and silky. The flavor is mostly dark malts with a hint of hops. Really tasty and I cannot tell any differerce between this and the bottled brew."
"Meh. Not too hot and a little too much of a sting for me."
"Drinkability: Bold... but that's about it."
"the carbonation the amount of sweets and the slightly strange finish are my big cons.. my pros are that this is a fine lil stout wich should give no one any reason to pout."
"Good, good, good, better, good."
"Not bad, but this is a fairly straightforward stout. Decent but disappointingly unremarkable."
"A fine beer. Moderate carbonation, with a smooth drinkability."
"I love this beer."
"D: Smooth and tasty, this one is a winner. I've never thought of stouts as a sessions beers, but this one could pass as one. Recommended. I'm glad that Faro sent two."
"D- Not too strong, very drinkable. Good beer."
"Pours an absolutely obsidian black, with a small, contrasting white head. I was actually expecting a dryer stout, but this one was pleasantly sweet in both aroma and flavour, without taking on some of the cloying aspects of some strong milk or Caribbean extra stouts. Definite dryness in the aftertaste, though, with some good, unsweetened chocolate and roasted grain elements. Super easy to drink. I could easily have polished off a bomber of this on my own."
"D: Eh. As stouts go, it's not very, um, stout. Has a strange fruity hoppiness that doesn't really match up well to the rest of the beer. I'll give it another try at a later date, but I was pretty underwhelemed by this one."
"Drinkability: An agreeable light, easy drinking light stout."
"Certainly not jawdropping in my book, but it's a decent stout overall."
"D: Very drinkable stout this one is. Almost on the verge of being a RIS--there are spicy notes in there that make me think this. This is one fine stout, with one fine mouthfeel. Highly recommended."
"I liked this a lot."
"Mouthfeel is just about spot on. Perfect levels of carbonation up front and in the finish to balance the thick body. Leaves my mouth clean; not cloying. Has ample body to let you know you've graduated from Heineken to a real man's beer, but balanced enough that you can drink it after a hot day mowing the lawn (what I just got done doing), or all night long out with your boys. Really a terrific stout, I will certainly be buying this one again."
"D: This has won me over as the best stout in the world. I didn't think it could get much better than obsidian, but this one blows it out of the water. I could drink these all day. If you are a fan of Stouts than this is a must have."
"Carbonation only medium, and the strength of the beer was pretty impressive. One or two bottles will keep you rather happy for an evening, especially since it goes down very smoothly."
"Drinkability- Didnt like it much at all. Way to much of a coffee flavor for me."
" Enjoyable, not overly heavy, and very drinkable."
"Appearance is very dark w/ a brown head. Smells kind of sweet w/ a coffee type smell behind it. Tastes very malty w/ some chocolate aftertastes. Overall, this is just above average in my opinion. Its not bad, just nothing special. The chocolate is a bit much for me I think."
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Smooth & creamy mouthfeel. Well balanced, but this sample seems a little mild. Was expecting something much roastier...this example just seems subdued."
"Taste- Pretty half-and-half like malts to start with teh middle allowing more coffee, mocha, chocolate, and spent grain flavor to hit. With the finish bringing all these flavors together and a well maintained hoppy finish."
"This is a really good beer. Chocolate barely loses the battle to the hops at the finish. Black color. Sweet aroma with good maltiness, nuts, coffee and salty licorice. The taste is dryer but still full-bodied with coffee, licorice and hops. The finish is charred-roasted with hints of nuts, not as good as the initial flavor on the palate, but still excellent."
"pours dark brown with thick dark head. rich aroma with hints of chocolate, espresso and roasted malts. taste is similar to the aroma but is quite sweet. a very smooth yet bold stout that i could drink any time. if you haven't already, pour one of these over some vanilla ice cream for an 8 ball stout float. lost coast recommends this on the bottom of their six packs, and for good reason!"
"The nose is full of heavy roasted malts, sweet coffee, and a light caramel essence. The taste is of rich and sweet espresso. It is also very smoothe for a stout and doesnt have the common bitterness. The mouthfeel is overall pleasant and since it isnt too rich it is possible to enjoy of small session of these without worrying about that heavy stout buildup."
"A rich, flavorfull, complex stout....not an imperial, but in the realm of single stouts, this one is very good."
"Good session stout! This is a fine beer!"
"I hope I get to revisit this beer again. Its an excellent Stout."
"Black in colour with medium carbonation. Aromas are a combination of dark and milk chocolate, with touches of dark fruit and the slightest hint of molasses. Some mild chocolate flavors are present, along with some assertive roasted malt and a bit of dark crystal malt. Medium bodied, and very drinkable. No surprises"
"D- very interesting to taste a stout that lets you taste the hops. Easy to drink especially since any bitterness or sourness from burnt malts arent evident at all."
"Black as the inside of an owls beak during enclosure. Small milk chocolate head of foam with an aroma of chocolate, roast and coffee with a hint of resiny and fruity hops. Big, roasted malt taste bring forth notes of coffee and chocolate. I often feel in an overwhelmed state of redundancy when I describe the flavor of stouts, but this particular one has a very appealing hop bitterness and flavor, especially on the finish."
"Nicely balanced, well done and served at a good temperature."
"Damned fine stout!"
"Tap@Lost Coast, May 04. Really nice stout. Rich and Bitter. licorice, roasted malt, cocoa chocolate, lots of flavour, very good. Nice dry, roasted finish. Very well balanced. Quite soft, yet assertive at the same time, man i wish i got to try more of this. Very drinkable. Particularly for its strength."
"12 ounce twist-off. Impenetrable black with chestnut highlight at the bottom of the pint glass; sticky and thick sand colored, finely attenuated foam. Aromas of powdered cocoa, faint whiff of hazelnut; roasted malts finish after brief scent of piney hops. Big chocolate malt roastiness. Beautiful balance of malt and sprucey-peppery hops. A sweet malted milkball meets bitter orange flavor at the finish -- absolutely delicious. Oatmeal adds a silken texture to this medium-bodied and velvety smooth stout. Great achievement, and super-sessionable. Definitely will buy again."
"Got this on vacation down in Orlando, wish it was available in STL."
"drinkability: really, really high for a stout. Most stouts have either a harshness, which is good but limit's drinkability, or are too basic. This one isn't harsh and it's pretty complex. the 6.3 alcohol, is enough to provide a bit of a kick, without venturing into imperial terriotory. yeah, i think i'll pick up a sixer next time."
"Medium thick and very dark sweet stout. Slight bitterness from the roasting..coffee taste with a little chocolate overtone. To me a very balance stout. Very easy to drink, not super filling..but moderately heavy. I would pick up a 6 of these on a regular basis. Good food beer."
"Note: Allergies colored this review to a small degree as my nose is a little stuffy. Will definitely review again in the future."
"This beer smells of chocolate, chicory and coffee. Poured it into my boot mug and the head was huge and strong, tan colored with lots of lacing as it receded. Color is opaque dark brown. Great stout flavor with a more sweet then bitter finish. Mouthfeel is good with ample carbonation and a good balance of malt and hops. The higher ABV is almost non detectable, this brew is pure flavor. I could enjoy many of these beers as it is very smooth from start to finish. The price was ideal, 50% off a sixer at my local mercado. I will enjoy immensely. Hope they restock."
"D: Drinkability isn't bad for this brew. It's a pleasing stout, but it could have been much better with more sweetness to balance to burnt/sourness of the dark malts. I would still recommend trying this one..."
"M/D: The carbonation subtle (yet present) delving an flavorful and complex brew that fells even across the palate, allowing the various parts of the tong to experience the beer completely differently. The finish is almost too dry, but the drinkability is not impacted."
"I really enjoyed the mix. Easy drinking, a bit chalky but overall nice."
"The drinkability is good. The flavour stays mild and delicious. It compels me to take another pull without becoming heavy and tiresome to consume. Very tasteful and well balanced. My first Lost Coast experience and it was a good one indeed."
"Cheers!"
"The drinkability of this beer is limited by its thickness. However, all in all, I was quite impressed with this one... I'd had it in my cellar for about 6 months... glad I decided to pull it out."
"Pours black , ruby red around the top when held to the light. Very little head, with some lacing. Smells of espresso with a hint of licorice. Initial taste of soy, that decreases as the beer warms to room temperature. This beer improves as it warms to room temperature. Alcohol does not jump out at you. Medium to full body. The mouthfeel starts thin but improves as the beer warms up. This is very smooth making this a very easy to drink. Overall an enjoyable stout that I would drink again. Initial serving was to cold."
"I could probably put back a six'er of this easily in a night if I felt so inclined. This is great beer. A little too mellow in the flavor category to be an amazing beer though."
"Pours almost black with a nice tan head,and pleanty of lacing.Smell is roasted,but sweet. Mouthfeel is light. Taste is malty,with a nice edge. This is a good tasting beer, light for a stout,but still full flavored. Very drinkable. I recommend this beer."
"The taste is as you expect form the aroma, more roasted coffee with hops giving it the bitterness. I want a bit more punch here. This is a very easy stout to drink"
"Quite watery and too carbonated for my tastes in a stout. Not impressed"
"Mouthfeel is thin, and a little bit harsh. The hops leave your tongue stinging, and the smoke leaves your throat feeling a little raw."
"Dark mahogany colored with a low beige head. Aroma of bitter chocolate laced with chicory and cherry, a bit of molasses and some smoke. Flavor is cocoa, espresso, dark molasses, some charred bark and a cherry tartness in the background. Mouthfeel is low carbonation, a bit tannic and chalky, not rich or full. Average drinkability."
"This stout had a dark brown to black color, with a typical head. The bouquet was originally weak but even after warming up the aromas never fully came out. The most obvious thing I noticed was the carbonation; it was too harsh for a stout. Despite the almost nonexistent bouquet, the flavors were pronounced with hints of caramel, coffee and chocolate. The mouthfeel was mediocre, due to the carbonation and a watery consistency. I think this is a very typical micro stout, unfortunately from a favorite brewery of mine."
"This is as black as beer gets. A small light brown head disappears rapidly, leaving no lacing behind. The aroma is big roasted malts, espresso, chocolate, and bitter hops. The flavor is very nice. The roasted malts give this a sweet chocolaty, coffee flavor up front, while the generous amount of hops provides more then usual acidity and bitterness. The finish is somewhat smoky. Carbonation is highish making the mouthfeel smooth without being dull. This is a wonderful stout."
"Thank you Lost Coast. This is why I love you."
"So whats left to say? 8-ball is very easy to drink and has a full body to it. If nit picking, I would like to say that I would prefer more of a robust character, but for its style (and what Im judging) it fits very well"
"Perhaps I got a bad bottle, because this doesn't seem to be in line with what people are saying, but I call it like I see it."
"Impressed! The price of this one is not too bad at all, pretty good flavor and right on style."
"Not one beam of light is able to penetrate the deep, dark black of this brew. Smells of sweet, roasted malts and powdered cocoa. Earth hints of oatmeal are present in the taste, melding smoothly with chocolate malts, hops, and coffee to create one tasty treat. It's thick presence belies a smooth, easy drinking finish. This is my all purpose Stout."
"drinkability: As stouts go, this is a good entry-level brew for what darker beers should be. It has earned a spot in my regular rotation."
"This beer went from a disappointment to a hell of an enjoyable stout in less than five minutes. Thanks go to Vintage Cellar for this one, as well as some other goodies currently stocked in my cellar fridge."
"A tasty and friendly stout here that never gets harsh. Body is a little light but that is just perfect for drinking at lunchtime when you don't want something heavy in you stomach."
"12 OZ. Bottle pours a deep brown, opaque no light through at all. Also pours with a nice head that diminishes but does not completely disappear. The smell is of roasted malts and chocolate there could be a hint of coffee in there. The taste has a slight chocolate feel much like the smell and a slight, slight bitterness but nothing that takes away from the flavor. The mouthfeel is rich and smooth with light carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer and the next time I head to the beer store will be sure to pick up some more."
"I won't turn one down next time I run across it, but I won't go out of my way to get one either. There is a place in town that has it on tap; perhaps it will fare better served that way."
"This is a really smooth and pleasant beer. It's surprisingly drinkable for a stout. Some stouts achieve drinkability by scaling back on mouthfeel and flavor. Not this beer. Although it is not as complex as my favorite stouts, this beer is thick and ferocious enough to hold its own in the category. The sweetness is distinct and present from the smell to the aftertaste, and everywhere in between. Yet the sweetness never overwhelms the palate or becomes cloying. I drank this in August, and it was refreshing; I'm guessing that in January, it'll be comforting and warming."
"Flavors are similar with molasses and licorice with bitter espresso and grapefruit hops to dry the finish. Alcohol never obvious. Medium to full body and a round solid mouthfeel from the oats. Hints of chocolate malts. A good stout."
"Rich, smooth mouthfeel. Medium carbonation. For having the sweetness that it does this stout finishes fairly dry and roasty. I could drink this on a regular basis and I wish it was readily available to me. Highly recommended."
"Excellent drinking Stout probably the best with around 6.3% abv. that I have had."
"I thought this was a very nice american stout, I would like to drink these often. Ingrediants list oats, so I consider this to be a health beverage."
"Drinkability: Very nice stout, hope to work it in regularly."
"A mouthful indeed, and very tasty for those that like a stiffer stout with very little to no sweetness at all."
"I was pleased to see this beer available at Corral Liquors this weekend on my 1st trip there after my recent move back to St. Louis. It poured into the shaker pint a deep inky black with a decent sized tan head. The nose is a blend of roast malt, coffee, chocolate covered cherries, and a mild citrus back. The flavor reflected the aromas extremely well. The coffee morphed into more of an espresso character, and the cherry. chocolate really came out well. The citrus evolved into a pleasant bitterness in the finish. The only complaint I have is a mild alcohol burning there on the finish as well. The mouth feel had the richness I expect in a good stout. Nice beer."
"I say give this one a try for sure. Its one of the best stouts I have tried in a while."
"Overall, a good stout. Nothing to write home about, but certainly nothing to scoff at. I just read on the label that oatmeal is used in the beer which would explain the smoothness. A good stout plain and simple."
"Overall Impression: Very good beer, massively drinkable. Sorry my review doesnt do it justice. Creamy, well balanced stout. Worth the hype, a great example of American Stout."
"Drinkability- This guy has too much hops jumping around in it for me, but besides that, it drinks pretty well. I probably won't try it again, but I would definitely suggest it to other people that like the bitterness in their stouts."
"This beer is ok. I wouldn't seek it out but would drink another if the opportunity presented itself."
"Pours with a two-finger brown head that leaves traces of lace. Totally opaque black color. Heavy bodied and light carbonation. Nose is coffee/chocolate. Starts with a sweet roasted coffee flavor and finishes with some bitter chocolate overtones. The brewer says that the ABV is 5.8%. 22oz bottle from Mark in California."
"Dry in its flavor, but not acidic, the 8 Ball delivers a very drinkable and satisfying stout. It's black as can be, with a decent-sized head of deep tan that fades shortly to a wide collar, but leaves little lace. The nose is more roasty than anything else (think spent espresso grounds), but there are hints of caramel there as well. Surprisingly, it's quite smooth across the tongue with a medium and somewhat dextrinous body and a fine, restrained carbonation. The flavor is very much like the aroma.... straightforward. It's not complex at all, but there are some notes of yeasty fruitiness, molasses, dark cocoa, coffee, low-key citrusy hops, and alcohol as well (not that alcohol has flavor, but its presence is noticeable). The bitterness is nicely balanced and lends towards a dry finish, but it's really the combination of bitterness and roastiness that gets it there. And then it simply disappears from the palate. But everything in life is a trade-off, and here we pick up a great drinkability in the deal. The 8 Balls is a smooth, drinkable, and satisfying stout that probably deserves more credit than it gets because it doesn't go over the top! Nicely done!"
"I must admit that this is a really nice, easy drinking stout. It has all of the flavors one looks for in a nice stout, plus it is in balance and it is ultimately easy on the palate and quite the quaffable brew. Ah, I just read the ingredients on the bottle, it is the oatmeal that gives this beer that full yet light quality. The oatmeal really works quite well to add another dimension to this brew."
"My second Florida import in as many days was poured into a standard pint glass, where it sat dark black, opaque, with a thin brown head. The aroma was dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, burnt grains, and floral hops. The taste was sweet and rich. Flavors of cocoa, caramel, bitter coffee, and sour apple found in generous dollops. Oaty, oily mouthfeel with some lingering burnt toast aftertaste. Hop bitterness was also noticeable towards the end of each sip. As easy drinking a stout as any Ive come across."
"Full bodied and smooth, goes good with roasted meats and chili, it's just the thing if you're in the mood for a roasty beer."
"Deep brown, not 100% opaque. Creamy brown head, rocky, thin-bubbled. Rather underwhelming lactic malt aroma. Typical choco-coffee profile is complemented by a vanilla touch that gets somehow beany. It gets even more obvious in mouth, I figure on some days, I would call it vegetal, a blend of the almost husky malt, coffee beans and the greenish hops, today it just feels beany, roasty and milky. Sweet finish, sticking the lips together by the end of the bottle. Medium body. Still a decent drinking beer to me, appearing richer than it really is, but how this is one of the best stouts in the whole world is far and away beyond me."
"Looking forward to trying a few more of the Lost Coast brews...a great first impression."
"When prompted to think about my style preferences by the occasional forum post, I've always put stouts in fourth or fifth position. I've been rethinking that lately and may now move them as high as second because of outstanding beer like 8 Ball Stout. If you enjoy the style, you owe it to yourself to give this one a try."
"Pours a lovely dark brown color with hints of ruby highlights. 2 inchest of frothy, chestnut color,light head sits on top then dissipates mostly to some semblance of cling to the glass, leaving a nice edge layer. Some roasted malts (toasted almonds) and caramel are smelled upon sniffing. A slight cascade hops aroma also pierces through on this one along with some bits of chocolate and alcohol presence. Lots of smoke flavor with the roasted malts, with a bit of caramel and chocolate backing them up. Also the cascade hops even comes through a slight bit leaving a bitter finish. The carbonation hits the tongue quickly but then subsides with the lighter body of this brew. The alcohol is present on my tongue after the swallow, but not much warming with this one. A bit of an almond aftertaste. Quite easy to consume, and the avb% would sneak up on you in a hurry I believe. Definitely worth trying."
"Hat brewery but this has some lasting power, great session beer."
"Notes: The chocolately goodness keeps me coming back for more...and I'm not even a big fan of chocolate. It was just so well done in this beer that I have to tip my hat to it."
"This is the first Brew from Lost Coast I've had the honor of trying, but if this one is any indication I will seek out some of the others. Can't reccomend this Stout highly enough."
"This beer pours thick and dark. The head is a dark tan that fades to laces rather quickly. It smells strongly of alcohol. It smells malty. Aslo, it smells slightly coffee like. It tastes like chocolate and rosted malts. Also I detect a toffee. This beer is very thick, but well balanced. It has just the right amount of carbonation. This beer is great. I would like to drink it all night, but it is a little strong. Everyone should definately tru this one. It is always available, so you can enjoy it when ever you want."
"I finally decided to give this a try after reading the high reviews here. Why didn't I encorporate this heavenly brew into my rotation long ago! Pours like used motor oil into the glass producing a thick head the color of chocolate milk. Head retention is good with thick, crusty lacing...I like what I see. Full blown aromas of expertly toasted dark malts, English toffee, chocolate-covered raisens, and bitter coffee. A sip reveals a mildly sweet, very roasty and toasty brew brimming with chocolatey goodness, dark fruits dipped in Godiva, espresso, and a nice nip of hop bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is thick and luxurious, almost oily, with soft carbonation and a generally chewy texture. There's a hint of sourness that I like to find in an Oatmeal stout. Overall, an excellent stout worthy of praise!"
"When poured, it was on the verge of being black, with very dark tan foam along with medium lace on side of glass. The smell of roasted malts and chocolate was very evident. The taste of roasted malts along with the chocolate was nicely put together. The bitterness was well balanced, along with just a slight sourness to make this stout pleasant. A well balance stout with the bitter/sour feel and taste on the palate was a pleasant surprise."
"I really recommend this for anybody interested in seeing what a stout can be. If you see this, please try it!!!"
"Pours a dark color with a tall head that sticks around for a while and leaves lots of lacing on the glass. The aroma was roasted malts, chocolate, dark fruits, and coffee. The flavor was nice and malty with a fruity character (berries?) and finishes with a coffee bitterness. Thick mouthfeel, as it should be. Smooth drinking. Very enjoyable."
"Pours like a good stout should: black with a small, dark brown head. No lacing to speak of. Taste is roasty up front, with hints of sweetness towards the middle and bitterness in the finish. Very balanced taste, nothing is overpowering. Isnt too bitter or sweet. Kind of like the Goldilocks of stouts. Label indicates presence of oatmeal, roasted and chocolate malts among other ingredients. Very smooth. Just hearty enough: not too filling, but certainly enough to notice. To me, this is the perfect 'middle of the road' stout and probably my favorite non-imperial/double stout. Recommended."
"Drinkability  superb, great beer with huge roasted and charred notes, could drink these back to back with ease."
"This beer pours a black color with a finger of dark tan head that falls to thouroughly coat the beer. This beer smells great. There is a ton of chocolate with a coffee background that gives it just a hint of bitterness. The flavor is good chocolate on the start that moves to coffee and finishes almost like burnt coffee, with a huge bitter and roasted malts. Damn. That is the most deep roasted flavor I can remember in a beer. The feel is moderate, with slight creamy tones. The beer is nice and smooth. Drinkability is pretty good on this beer as well. I like the aftertaste a lot. I would like a little more thickness, but its not bad. Overall this is a well built beer. Thanks to clvand0 for sharing this one with me."
"Drinkability: A very nice stout; has a lot to commend"
"Where in Philly can I get a case beer advocates?"
"Palate starts off with sweet cocoa malt, and light ripe fruit. Smoky and meaty. Big and chewy mouthfeel. Bitterness comes in and lasts into the long finish. Bitter, but not SN Stout bitter. A delicious, full-flavored stout in the spirit of Shakespeare."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" brown head above the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head diminishes quickly, but settles as a small layer of brown bubbles, and lacing is okay. Aroma is dark malts, coffee and chocolate prevalent. Taste is sweetly of the dark malts, which quickly turns to bitterness, more of the burnt coffee malt than hop variety. Mouthfeel could be smoother, cut the edges on that coffee bitterness a bit, but drinkability is still good. Reasonable stout."
"poured tar black and a nice big brown head. aroma roasted malts, smokey caramel, choc. covered cherries, hot prunes, toffee. flavor same as aroma with hints bitterness at the finish. this my idea of a good stout well balanced for me. thanks for my son for telling me about this one"
"A bit over-rated as creaminess or extra taste or complexity would help."
"A full bodied beer that defines a stout. Very nice."
"Pours a pitch black with a small dark brown head. Lots of dark malts and coffee tones in the nose. Mild alcohol sweetness noticable. Dry coffee flavors and lots of dark malt control the finish. Great palate. Mouthfeel is very flavorful, but not too thick or heavy. A pleasant beer. Great for a cool autumn evening. Another solid bre from Lost Coast. Definately worth a try if you are a stout fan."
"I love a good stout. This ones a dense obsidian with a frothy, solid tan head. The aroma espresso-like, intense roasted barley, burnt and toasted malt smells. Its certainly deep and complex, but the smell could also be stronger. Its what Id call quiet. The taste, on the other hand, is certainly not quiet. Its full flavored to say the least, with all of the aromas coming out. Chocolate, nuts, caramel, and a burnt character. Thick and solid mouthfeel. The brews on the dry side of life. Overall, this is one yummy stout."
"wow what a kick ass stout! this 8ball pours like motor oil except darker. small head that diminishes to a ring. smell is sweet coffee semi sweet chocolate and malt. taste is robust bitter with a very subtle sweetness. not much carbonation but not missed. mouthfeel is sustantial and thick....a real belly filler. drinkability is great even though after a few you'll feel like napping like after thanksgiving dinner."
"Thanks to JahNoth for the hookup."
"This is a smooth and highly drinkable stout that I will assuredly visit with regularity."
"in the famous words-- 8 ball junkie, 8 ball junkie. 8 ball junkie..."
"Foamy, cherry cola colored head fades quickly to a thin ring. Opaque black colored beer. Rich cocoa and chocolate malt aroma is just a pinch smokey. On the bitter side for a stout. Mainly bitter chocolate flavor, with a bit of vegetably? note. The flavor is a bit one dimensional, what hits you up front just fades all the way through to the finish. Rich flavor upfront, a bit dry overall, possibly smokey. I like stouts so it works for me, but it may not be for all."
"Nice drinkability for a stout though I suspect its quite strong in alcohol."
"The mouthfeel is somewhat creamy and smooth at the start and finish. The coffee and chocolate tones last long on the tongue after swallowing. Heavy bodied brew, but extremely drinkable as the tastebuds are very happy after sipping this great brew."
"This came in a 22oz bomber with an 8 ball on the front that I had right before I was going to play pool, maybe it would help my game. This pours out a pitch-black color with a thick dark tan head of about three fingers height, a picture perfect stout. The head recedes fairly quickly to a cap of bubbles leaving scattered lacing around the glass. Smells of roasted coffee and chocolate malt rise from the glass with a bit of sweetness to it as well, very pleasing smell indeed. Taste is heavy with a roasted coffee flavor jumping out with bittersweet dark chocolate playing a big role as well. The finish is dry and quite bitter with a lingering coffee flavor and slight earthy hoppiness to it. Very well balanced with the sweetness not being over done and the bitterness being very present. Medium to full body this brew has a creamy mouthfeel that makes every sip enjoyable. A surprisingly good stout that is up there on my favorite stouts list, highly recommend."
"The beer after its extraction from the 22-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass an Atramentous color with a planetary sized semi-creamy light chocolate head and after its dissolving the lace forms a sticky and thick sheet to obscure the glass. Nose is rich in roasted grain, chocolate and coffee, ah that smell, start is sweet and rich in malt with the top moderate to full in its feel to the palate. Finish is light to medium in acidity, the hops delectable in their spicy bite, desert dry aftertaste and a decent stout overall."
"Nice, nice stout, one that I will be buying again and again."
"I need more. This stuff rocks. But what is the ABV?"
"Pours out like black molasses into my snifter. Small tannish head that clings to life at the edge of the glass. Smell is very roasty, lots of chocolate overtones with roasted coffee beans. Taste is heavily smoky, with the coffee bean flavor in the lead. Just a hint of the sweetness, but the malt backbone is still quite present. I liked this one quite a bit, especially when I'm not in the mood for a sweeter stout. Very solid offering."
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy dark brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a creamy aroma with hints of patent and chocolate malts. It's not overpowering, but it is very pleasant. The taste is great! It has a rich dark malt flavor, but it's really smooth and dry. It goes down easily and finishes with a mild chocolate aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good stout. It has all the goods; a good sessions brew."
"Pours a beautiful black with a small chocolate head that dissapates quickly. Lacing throughout glass. Smells like burnt coffee and chocolate. Has a sweet chocolate taste, reminds me of left hand milk stout, while not as sweet. Has a somewhat bitter after taste. Mouthfeel is good. Not too thick, not too thin. A very drinkable stout. Really like this one."
"Pours midnight black with a two-finger creamy head that's probably the darkest I've ever seen on a beer, somewhere between mud-brown and dark coffee. Deep, earthy nose holds notes of coffee, molasses, roasted malt, and a touch of smokiness. Beautiful, creamy mouthfeel is absoultely wonderful, like good chocolate milk. Palate is chocolate malt and coffee up front, with a subtle hint of hops kicking up towards the back of the mouth. Don't know why I haven't had this stout before, it's a good one."
"This went down velvety smooth. I could drink several of these. This was the first beer I've had from Lost Coast, but it won't be the last."
"I didn't notice alcohol in the taste but it sure did warm the belly. Excellent drinkability nonetheless and I've found a new favorite Stout. Highly Recommended!"
"drinkability is quite high for this is a smooth, rich beer. Will definitely seek out again."
"pitch black with a really appetizing creamy dark brown head. nice roasted malt and milk chocolate aroma. sturdy, medium to full body with a low level of carbonation. smooth and silky, ample roasted flavors mix well with notes of chocolate and espresso. light and herbal hop flavor. zero astringency. very satisfying while remaining quite drinkable. full of flavor and quite bold, while still remaining not too ""in your face"". a delicious stout that deserves more recognition. another winner from lost coast."
"Quite nice. A good stout that it would be great to see around here, with a nice sweet and smoky character that melds quite well. Hopefully, this will be one that I can have again."
"Slithers out of the bottle an opaque black with a short-lived cocao head that leaves some rings of wavy lacing.Smell is chocolate liquer with some roast chicory and mild hop notes. The taste is initially pungently bitter and continues to become sweeter and oatier until a creamy, citric smoothness takes over. Oiliness lingers...reminds one of good coffee. Mouthfeel is fabulous, if a little thin for the style in some people's books. Drinkability is slow and deep and dark and goood. I'll have another."
"Overall: A pleasant surprise in a mixed sixer I picked up in Blacksburg, VA (Vintage Cellar). Robust and bold stout."
"I was excited to try this beer - as I have heard good things about it. Anywho - pours a syrupy looking jet black, with a pretty dark tan head that settles out quickly. The aroma was very roasty and bread-like with a hint of sweetness - pleasant. The taste is strong and complex, very strong maltiniess at first and a finish with the standard trio of carmel/chocolate/coffee notes. I was impressed with the feel of aftertaste, as I found it to be velvety smooth and buttery - very nice. The syrupy texture is surprisingly light on the tongue, enough so that I found it to be slightly lacking in mouthfeel and a bit thin for my taste. Overall I was pleased - I wouldn't write home about it, but I would buy it again sometime."
"Full body, very smooth with very little carbonation. Very strong roasted flavors that move to bitter chocolate. Coffee flavors are dispersed the whole way through. Roasted finish with a moderate sweet/bitter aftertaste. A nice stout, something to drink again."
"There's nothing really notable about the mouthfeel, but nothing wrong with it either. Overall I had to give this a 3.0 for drinkability (I treat drinkability as a general ""will I buy this again"" ranking) because there's nothing bad about it but the cost for what you get. If you like bitter and the deep coffee flavors, this is the beer for you. I'll buy it again, but it'll be a while."
"Thanks for gem of a stout Murph."
"Completely opaque, black pour topped with tight, foamy head the color of brown sugar. The head doesn't stick around long at all, though, and lacing is minimal. Smell is a pleasant blend of traditional roasted cocoa- and coffee-like notes that are lightened by a hoppy twang. That twang carries over to the taste, which is lighter than a typical stout. Roasted flavors are muted but form a nice foundation. Mouthfeel similarly is lighter than expected, though this makes for a stout that goes down easier than most."
"One of my favorites from Lost Coast."
"22oz bomber bottle. This stuff is Like a micro version of Guinness. An opaque black body with a large brown head of foam that lasts and lasts...Aromas are straight forward and consist of roasted malts, slightly acidic hops, chocolate, and more. The taste is malty, with some hops on the middle of the tongue and some caramel on the finish. The mouthfeel is creamy and right and the drinkability is pretty excellent as well. A good stout!"
"Pours a dark and rich midnight black color. Dark and creamy coffee brown colored head. The aroma is rich and syrupy sweet with fruit, licorice, charcoal and Kaluha liqueur. Theres a sweet and roasted nut-like presence in this beer. The roasted grains taste like they are overdone here  tastes a bit burnt, with a harsh alcohol bite in the finish. This beer is hard to drink. Its too over the top, without any real mellow smoothness. Its strong, rich and bold. Some others would probably like it a bit more than me."
"Pours jet black with a thinnish, dark dark tan head. Lovely imperial stout aroma -- rich, chocolatey malt, sweet cherry, and an underlying alcohol scent. The taste is huge. Very chocolatey with heaps of oatmeal. A bit of prune kicks in at the finish, yielding to a lovely roasty aftertaste. Not a lot of hops to the finish here, but not at all cloying. Still, the hops might help to soften the alcohol flavor which, as it stands, becomes just a bit too strong for my taste at the finish. Still, damn drinkable and quite a surprise for me. I'd not heard much about this brewery, but will be sure to look into them more thoroughly!"
"This stout is black. No light getting through. It poured nice and seemed to be a thicker brew. A big frothy brown head formed quickly but faded back to thin layer over the top of the glass. It smells a bit sweet with a malt nose. The first taste was good. Not overly memorable but good. It has a dry roasted flavor to it with some chocolate notes. It is a bit thicker than the stouts I've had recently, which is a good thing...a very good thing. The after taste is a little bland but makes you want another sip. Overall, a nice stout for party and definetly worth the money."
"Definately pick this one up."
"I crack the top carefully. I always use a quarter wrapped in a scrap of paper towel so I don't scratch the painted surface. I rinse the cap and shake off the excess water, but just before I toss it into the plastic tub with the others, I take a sniff. It still gives out that bitter mocha coffee aroma. My eyes twinkle with the anticipation. The beer pours black and oily. It eerily makes no sound and kicks up a chocolate cream that laces the sides of the glass perfectly. The aroma is rich with milk chocolate and charcoal. The hops are reserved in this one, but they're there, lurking, giving the burned barley bitterness a little support. It's almost like drinking chocolate milk, this one, it's body thick and smooth with the huge cocoa flavor lingering a touch longer than the rest."
"Highly recommended!"
"12 oz bottle. Pours a thick black into a pint glass, beige head is minimal even with an agressive pour. Moderate lacing. Nose is all dark malt notes of burnt coffee and a hint of chocolate. Taste is bittersweet chocolate, burnt coffee, and a touch of oatmeal. Very thick and creamy in the mouth. Alcohol content is not listed and is not noticeable. The taste remains primarily bitter to the end, with hops staying out of the picture. Finishes dry and clean. A very good stout here."
"This beer just hit me all wrong. I'm a great fan of oatmeal stouts, but this had a smokey character that was disquieting. Great coal black color. Some dark roasted coffee in the aroma, but a hickory smoke aspect to the malt that also had an odd acidity, like smoked summer sausage. Blah."
"Thanks to BierReise for this fine Stout. Jet black color with a medium thick dark brown head. Thin and very sticky lacing. The aroma has a strong roasted malt and coffee character. Rich body and rather smooth, with a nice blend of coffee, malt, molasses and chocolate flavors. The finish is moderately bitter coffee with a pinch of hops. This is a solid Stout from start to finish."
"Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Strong alcohol give this stout a some bite. Nothing to worry about. It is just part of the enjoyment of the stout. This stout would go well with a robust cigar."
"This is an excellent stout. Typical, dark (black) appearance. Just the right amount of bitterness, good, full body. Some chocolate and expresso flavors noted, but relatively subtle. Very good balance and drinkability. I would rate it just below Shakespeare, but above Sierra Nevada. Very nice. Thanks for the sample, Ron."
"Comments  This was a nice surprise that I found in a care package from mickeymac. Kudos to my BA bro for hooking me up with this one."
"I really enjoyed 8 Ball Stout. It had a lush feel and fine balance which made it very easy to drink. Im developing an affinity for stouts and this one is ranking quite highly on my best stout list."
"This beer pours like black ink. The head is very dark brown and rocky. As it dies back it laces the glass. The aroma is roasted barley and chocolate. The flavor is roasted, then chocolate that lasts into a dry chocolate finish. The body is very well done, and the drinkability due to the myriad of flavors is good."
"Holy cow was this an unusual site to be seen!! This beer poured darker than any I have seen and the head was so incredibly brown I thought I was looking at a rich chocolate mousse!! The fragrance has a really nice roasty scent to it that should be savoured!! This is one for anyone who truly appreciates a nice dark rich brew!! While there is no coffee to be found in here, it could be compared to a nice dark roast cup of coffee like the ones I have had in the Yukon in Canada as opposed to your typical (U.S.) mass market brewed coffee. The head lingered for quite some time as did the roastiness of the flavor. Find this and ENJOY!!"
"I brought back a bomber of the 8 ball on our recent trip to the West Coast and sampled it last night here in CT just as the first pre-winter chill was starting to creep in. The 8 ball pours out black as its namesake, dark as a mooness night topped with a nice mahogany head. Smells abundantly of dark roasted coffee and malt, none of the tangy sweetness or hints of alcohol that you often find in some other big stouts. Taste is very full and roasty, like my favorite black coffee, with just a little bit of bitterness hinting of hops and bringing it to a nice crisp finish. Leaves a nice smoky aftertaste that's quite pleasant and leaves you lookign forward to the next sip...."
"Pours pitch black with a persistent chestnut colored head... not a single ray of light passes through this baby. Aroma is full of chocolate malt, coffee, and a light note of pine. Flavor begins sweet with chocolate and molasses, then becomes bitter with coffee and some piney hops. Well balanced and full of flavor. Full bodied with medium to low carbonation. This is a very good stout... worth seeking out!"
"Dark black color. Medium head. Aroma is chocolate malt. Very thick pour, motor oil or tar. A medium bodied stout. Roasted malts, chocolaty and slightly sweet. Oaty and not very bitter. Flavor is big and chewy, with coffee and chocolate predominating. Not very sweet but also not very bitter. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet with a slight bitter tinge. Very drinkable stout"
"Pours a deep black color with a thick, rich tan head that fades away quickly, that leaves a thin, sticky lace on the glass. There are some roasted malt aromas that are very apparent with slightly sweet undertones. The taste is like that of a strong coffee mixed with roasted malt and chocolate. There is a mild bitterness that comes through at the end of each drink. The body is medium and well balanced. This isnt the greatest stout that Ive had but it was still quite enjoyable."
"($2.49 / 22 oz.)"
"594"
"Pours pitch black in color with a creamy brown head that leaves webs of lace behind as you drink. Nose is roasted chocolaty malts with notes of smoky charcoal. Full-bodied with a very nice thick and creamy texture (there must be some oatmeal in this brew). Taste starts off with flavors of rich bittersweet chocolate and malt followed by notes of espresso and some bittering hops. A wonderful stout that I would happily recommend to anyone. Thanks to Loki for the sample!"
"Glub Glub Glub, like motor oil pouring out of its quart bottle. This one has a huge dark head to boot which refuses to die. Aroma of sweet espresso and charred wood smoldering in the rain. Smooth and creamy like butter with a slight crispness. Flavor is sweet and bitter, smoked grains, semi-sweet chocolate and a Cuban coffee. This one finishes dry and bitter."
"The tastes is very full bodied, with big flavors of chocolate, burnt malt, smoke, espresso. Is that hints of oatmeal as well? Very creamy and smooth. This tastes like a hybrid stout, as if somebody said what if we put a chocolate, imperial, and oatmeal stout together? What would that taste like? Well I imagine it would taste just like this. Truly wonderful. But I am a stout lover so I may be a little biased. But no, I don't think so. Two Pints Up!"
"thanks, BierRiese!"
"Stouts are not for everyone, but I find myself partial to them (oatmeal stouts in particular). Snuggled ever so warmly halfway between a Young's double chocolate and a Rogue Shakespeare, the 8 Ball stout succeeds in achieving that ever so rare and exquisite balance of roasted hop bitterness with sweet oatmeal and chocolate maltiness that makes for a truly unique and enjoyable treat. A bit intense with the first few sips, but an equillibrium is quickly achieved making for one of the most drinkable stouts on the planet. (Are you a Guiness nut and ready for something that will make you re-think your position in the universe? The 8 Ball Stout from the Lost Coast Brewery is the key.}"
"So i saw good reviews for this and i bought a sixer. Pours a dark black with a decent little brown head. Smells like coffee, chocolate, burnt malt. Tastes like coffee with a hint of burnt chocolate and roasted malt with just a little bitter kick. Mouth feel is nice, slighty creamy but not too heavy. drinkability is good because this is a solid good stout and who cant keep in downing a tastey stout? would be a good desert beer, good for relaxing and sipping also."
"Poured a pitch a black color with a slight dark brown head,smelled sweet of bitter chocolate.Very smooth texture,and nice body.Taste didnt have enough umph to it to me,some roasted sweetness at the start and a pretty dry finish.Very well made and a good find."
"Superb  Strongly Recommended you Sink One of these if you get chance."
"12 oz bottle. No freshness dating noted. Murky, dark, dark black pour. Thick pour, creamy beige head, with purple hues on the edge. Bubbles up when swirled. Thin coating lasts and lasts. Robust bitter roasted malt smells. Burnt diner coffee, smooth bitterness, lasts and lasts. First taste is full, creamy, rich and superbly bitter roasted malt. Full coffee flavors with a hint of rich sweet chewy oatmeal malt. The oatmeal adds body and flavor. Bitterness subsides and becomes supersmooth with subtle chocolate malt sweetness. Finally hops slip by, medium size hop burps are enjoyed. Thick, full bodied stout, perfect going down. Flavors become balanced, but never waver. An exceptional example. Please give it a try, highly recommended !"
"Overall, I like this stout quite a bit. It's an excellent dessert beer. It could be stronger, but it develops nicely as it warms up."
"Rich dark black color, creamy sticky brown head that leaves a clingy lace in my glass. Chocalate and burnt coffee aroma. Dark roasted malty flavor, nice bitter- burnt dry finish, medium bodied with a full and creamy mouthfeel, man this is pretty good!!!!!!!"
"Thanks Murph."
"Pours thick black with a dark brown head that faded in seconds. Smell is very nice with chocolate and roasted coffee dominating.  Sweet chocolate starts out and leads into the roasted coffee flavors near the back of the mouth.  Fairly bitter for my liking, but still an enjoyable, pretty complex brew.  There was a strong taste of alcohol in there that detracted from the rest of the flavors."
"Updated 2010. This is a really nice stout, Lost Coast's best brew in my opinion. It must be that hint of oatmeal that gives it a fullness and little sour tang, which I really like."
"Pours a super black with a thick brown head that fades a little too quickly.  Smell is of roasted/burnt malts with some coffee and a whiff of chocolate thrown in.  Huge dark chocolate flavors start off with some hints of raisnins and other dark fruits.  The smooth chocolate flavor slowly fades into a nice bitter coffee flavor which then fades into a nice lingering bitter roasted/burnt finish.  Very smooth and creamy, this brew is definitely very drinkable.  A very good brew all around."
