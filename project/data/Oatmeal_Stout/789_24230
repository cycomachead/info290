Pours a very dark brown, appearing opaque black in the glass with a thin light brown film that dissipates to a thin ring around the glass. Mild aroma of chocolate and toasted malt. Flavor is toasted malt, nice chocolate, day old coffee, finishes with mild hop bitterness and a touch of char. Medium bodied with hints of creaminess. A quite nice low ABV stout. The oatmeal gives it a much more pleasant feel than most light stouts, and the flavors, although not intense, are nicely balanced and pleasant. I don't usually go to the stout style for a session beer, but if I did, this would be an excellent candidate. Mild, but nicely done.","LiquidAmber","Dec 10, 2013"

The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly smooth feel.

Enters the mouth with that same roasty feel, very malty up front on the palate. It is a bit thin mid palate but quickly fills in with some dry bitter feel towards the end of the palate. The oats keep this brew smooth throughout. Mouthfeel is dry, bitter and slightly thick, but it still stays soft. Drinkability is very good.

Nice roasted malt flavor with pleasant coffee, smoke and a little oatmeal in the flavor. It drinks better than it looked upon the initial pour. The prickle and coloration of the stout made me nervous as it looked more like a dry irish stout than a chocolate oatmeal stout. The flavor removed my fears. Some sweet maltiness in the flavor that is carried by the body and the abundant flavor from the roasted malt.","Ragingbull","Apr 08, 2009"

Very creamy tasting, notes of vanilla, caramel and coffee are also present, but not too strong or overwhelming. It tastes very nice but it's not complex and is unfortunately a little light on body.

Tastes just as I expect a stout to taste--there is a distinction around the malt and it isn't all burnt--it's malty, sweet, well-balanced, deep, and dark.
