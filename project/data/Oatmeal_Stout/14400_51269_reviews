"Body may be on the light side, and the expected smoothness and creamy texture is present yet uneven. No real matter. The flavors manage to carry all the weight. Moderate carbonation. Finish is dry and roasty, a little earthy and astringent. Some mouthfeel issues notwithstanding, this is a tasty stout well worth sampling. Great ester presence and the roasted elements are balanced out nicely by some sweet special effects. Down with disease."

"Overall a good stout.  The vanilla is not over done."

"Looking forward to trying more from Ninkasi."
""

"Feel: Surpringly dry and hot finish. Seems off for what they were going for. Oats do little to impact the feel. Thin body [2.75]"
""
"Oats and vanilla are very subtle. Mostly roasted malt with a light hop bitterness and little sweetness. Very nice but not what I expected from reading the label."
"Can this be used as a meal replacement? Maybe not, but it sure would be fun to use."
""
""
""
"Sweet, malty, smooth pours with a nice even head.  Vanilla come through immediately finishes chocolatey."
""
""
""
""
"Light roast, has that great oatmeal bite, but there's just nothing that stands out."
"Very, very dark. Fantastic looking beer.  Light roasted malt smell, overpowered by a nice sweetness.  Roasty, sweet flavor with a vanilla finish. Silky, creamy, thick, decadent texture. This is a bad ass oat stout."

"Overall this is a very nice beer, nicely enhanced by a slight touch of vanilla.  Too much vanilla in a beer is not a good thing for my palate.  Definitely one I would have again."
""
""
"Overall: I think the vanilla is just a little too much on this one.  Mostly a good beer, but it could be dialed back a notch."
"Overall a delicious stout for someone who likes bitter beer."

"On tap Roof of Wholefoods Brooklyn. I am tasting the vanilla right away with this one. After that is a very good sweetish stout. Has some body, nice and chewy, so not a porter."
""
""
""
""
"A tasty stout, both experience enhancers (oats for body, vanilla for flavour) workin' it overtime.  It is a tad strange, the vanilla not being associated with its usual barrel friends, but that's ok with me - what we get here is more of the real deal, for what it's worth.  Worthy of checking out, if you like the well-made, adulterated (much love) American stouts."

"This is tasty, but I wish the vanilla was more pronounced, and the finish was a bit more complex."

"Couldn't find the vanilla in this one, tasted of burnt toast through out. Sadly disappointing for my 500th post on BA."
""
""
"Pours a very nice thick, dark brown color, nice carbonation, not much of a head, fizzy tan color, a small island and some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is nice, malty, with some nice vanilla notes, toffee, chocolate. The taste is very nice, malty, very nice vanilla note, with some toffee and chocolate thrown in. Medium body, nice little chewiness, with a slightly bitter/dry finish. Overall a nice brew, glad to see it here in UT."

"Overall - Vanilla keeps it interesting and elevates it."
""
""

"O: This has a nice balance so it doesn't end up being too sweet. The vanilla takes the edge off of the roasty malt. This was a solid oatmeal stout."
"A real solid oatmeal stout for sure, missing some of the vanilla flavor it hints at, and a bit of hop unexpectedness, but as an oatmeal stout it sure delivers."

"Moderate pour from bomber into pint shaker glass produced a 2+ finger, mocha brown head. Aroma was very good, probably the best attribute, consisting of chocolate malt and vanilla beans. First impression upon putting to lips was an astringent harshness. First thought this was due to over carbonation, but the final pour was a bit thin and flat. Taste, by itself, was good and improved as it warmed. But, overall not well enough balanced, especially in the lacking mouth feel,  to be top of its class."

"Wife's Review: ""I like it. It reminds me of the vanilla iced coffee at Starbucks."""

"This is a good old regular oatmeal stout. This is good, but I would have to be hard pressed to have this again."

"O: Needs less bittering hops, the bitterness makes it harsh and almost undrinkable."

"Over all with the name of the beer I expected more. This is a beer you buy hoping for something different. Not a bad brew, but not what I expected."

"Overall â€“ A rather tasty brew. If only it had a bit more smooth oatmeal flavor at the end of the taste and a slightly modified body, then it would be one fantastic vanilla oatmeal stout. Even so it, is rather nice and one to try if you get the opportunity."

"This beer pours well, with a deep, jet black color. I could definitely taste the harmonious blend of vanilla and oatmeal that elevated your typical stout flavor to a new level. I picked up more vanilla than oatmeal, though neither was overpowering. Overall, the taste was incredibly smooth, as was the aftertaste, which dropped off appropriately gradually. This beer is incredibly drinkable and didn't taste alcoholic to me at all, despite the 7.2% ABV. I would have enjoyed this beer more if it had leaned a bit more overpowering, either in raw flavor or in heaviness, but as it stands, it felt smooth, light, and balanced. My only real complaint is that the carbonation was weak, which contributed to an average mouthfeel in an otherwise very nice beer. Would definitely drink again, and would probably have more than one at once!"

"impressive for a number of reasons. i love the dark sleek look, not shiny or flat, but somewhere in between in terms of luster. smallish head, but good retention and white lacing. i smell vanilla, but its still behind the dark earthen barley roast and a touch of carbon ash as well. minimal sweetness in the taste or the feel, which makes this for me. so many of these come across as sugar bombs, and this one is appreciably dry as well as bitter on the finish. vanilla is also only subtle, playing off the body and sweetness of the oats, but contributing only accents. most vanilla beers going right now are so heavy in vanilla that the beer gets lost, not the case with vanilla oatis, which stays dark and bitter and rich, without ever getting sweet or overbearing. well hidden alcohol strength and a long roasted barley finish. fun and well made beer, among the best ive had from ninkasi."
"Vanilla stout, kinda scary after my first encounter with a vanilla beer was something from the Shock Top line of beers. Since then I have had some really good ones and the Vanilla -phobia is gone. This beer is not the best on I have has but I really enjoyed it. It is a very subtle vanilla in every sense. It is barely noticeable in the nose and also on the taste. More of the roast malt character comes out in the beer with notes of coffee and chocolate. The oatis part of this beer gives it a great mouth feel that complements the sweetness of the beer. This is the perfect beer for someone who doesn't want some beer with their vanilla."

"O: its a good beer didnt have any expectations this is my first oatmeal stout. I dont think I would buy it again although $5 for 7%abv is hard to pass up"

"Would love to have access to this out here in MN. $4 for 22 oz of this stuff beats most anything comparable in this market."
"O - Damn good beer. I'll have another please. :-)"

"It's been sitting in the fridge for a while eyeing me off so tonight's it's her turn and pours a dark as night black hue with the creamiest two finger coffee laced head and some nice lacing,the smell is bourbon,booze,sweet dark malts and dried fruits,the mouthfeel is nicely carbonated but feels light on in body just medium bodied which is a big let down and has tastes of strong vanilla first up followed by some sweet caramel,milky chocolate and finished with a fruity hoppiness which really levels out the sweetness in a good way but overall for me I'm glad I've tried it but it's abit all over the place and not something I'd seek out again cheers."

"A flavorful, potent breakfast beer - not greatly improved by the vanilla - though it works well with the base beer."
""
""
"Taste: Creamy mouthfeel with perfect carbonation. Tastes like oat crackers with some very light vanilla butter on top. There is not much vanilla in here."
""
"O: It fell somewhat short of what I was hoping for, but it's a great stout. The flavor of vanilla seems forgotten, at least to me. It's so common to see it imitated in sweets as a base flavor, but real vanilla imparts a delicious flavor, that I feel goes perfectly with chocolatey stouts, and that's pretty much what you get here."

"Overall: Too much vanilla, this one needs a competing flavor. Something to go up against the vanilla. I was hoping for more."
""
""
""
"mouthfeel is very nice with the oats added, it gives a thick kick to it, as well as the base malt which equals out at 7.2% alc. a very well done stout, ive had the normal oatis and this vanilla gives it just a bit more dimension and compliments the flavors nicely."

"Pours a deep, rich black color with a nice one finger coffee brown head. The nose has some faint chocolate and roasty notes. The body is exactly the right consistency for an oatmeal stout, which runs a little thinner than others. Not quite as creamy as other stouts. You get the coffee, chocolate notes from the roast and I did notice the vanilla. It isn't sweet or overpowering, but I'd be disappointed without the vanilla. Well made, tasty stout."
"The vanilla does show up but enough in my liking as to not take away from the chocolate notes of the beer. Add oatmeal to the mix and this is very drinkable and quite smooth in the aftertaste. Ninkasi has become one of my fave brewers from Oregon available in BC. This stout hits the marks in all areas."

"Poured into a pint glass, from a 22 oz. bottle."
""
""
"Overall- I thought this was going to be a very solid brew up to the taste. They tried too hard with the vanilla and could have tried balancing with a bit of more lasting sweetness. Nonetheless, an enjoyable stout."

"Another excellent beer from the goddess! I bought this bomber in Livingston, Montana at the Albertson's supermarket, which is the only place I've seen it thus far."

"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, cookie dough, and vanilla aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, vanilla, and lots of char flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with a fairly acrid char flavor that lingers long after each sip and takes away from the drinkability in my opinion."
""
"overall real easy drinking stout right here. I had it with breakfast and it paired very well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Minor ding for the carbonic note to it, but a masterfully done easy drinking and roasty rocking beer I am glad to finally taste. Another bit of greatness from a criminally underrated brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Another good beer from Ninkasi. Smooth drinker here. ABV is well beyond sessionable, but you'd not know it. Goes down easy with a nice flavor and feel."
""
"Very drinkable, but again, lacks the taste of vanilla you would expect from a beer that you would think it trying to highlight the use of vanilla in the brewing process."
""
""
"Pretty good but not outstanding. Has a good feel but lacks on the vanilla. A bit of a head would make it more appealing to the eye too."
""
"Appearance is a very dark brown color with a fairly stable head leaving fair lace. Smell of the dark malt, vanilla and a bit of the oatmeal. Taste is in par with the aroma having a nice balance with the hops. Mouthfeel is full and creamy with good carbonation. A very nice stout with a twist."
""
"There were hints of vanilla, but overall it seemed a bit faded, which was somewhat disappointing. If I am going to decide to get the vanilla Oatis over the regular version I want there to be a noticeable different. The favor was nice, which I was not surprised by, as I like the regular version, but I was not wowed either by the vanilla or by anything deeper coming from this beer. I would drink this beer again, there are just lots of others that I would choose before I got to this one."
""
"Not a marked improvement over the original, but it's solid. The vanilla is nice and subtle, adding just enough to let you know it's there. Still clutch for the style."

"A hot day but like I said a great winter warmer."

"Recommended for $5/22oz. But not for much more than facevalue. It's worthy and drinks nicely."

"O- Great mouthfeel and pretty big vanilla notes, but natural tasting and not too overwhelming. I think I prefer this to the original Oatis just a little bit."
""
""
"Overall an excellent example of a sweet stout, will definitely get again."
"Leans to the sweet side a bit too much for my liking, but this is still a pretty tasty beer. If you like sweeter stouts, you'll probably enjoy this one."
""
"O - Oatis is decent, more vanilla might have helped this one, but I couldn't find any."
""

"prost LampertLand"
"Pours a smooth mahogany with a coffee colored head. Thick lacing and nice creamy consistency on the head. Smells like the regular Oatis, oatmeal stout. Tastes surprisingly bitter but finishes with the same Oatis flavors, malted oats, honey, and a bit of sweet coffee. I was, however, disappointed in the lack of vanilla flavor within this beer. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth but the finish leaves very little taste of any kind of vanilla. Overall, i'm pretty disappointed in this beer."
"O- It's an alright brew. I think I prefer the straight Oatis."
""
""
""
""
"Near world class!"
"Overall I prefer the regular Oatis but I believe this would be a promising crossover beer for newer stout drinkers. One of the main ingredients in chocolates is vanilla. Also hard to believe this is 7.2% abv from the taste. Well hidden."
""
""
""
"I wasn't sure what to expect from the vanilla use, but it was well done became the focal point, complimented by the base beer."
""
""
""
""
"For $3.29 (or whatever it was) this is a hit and not a miss."
"4/3.5/3.5/3.5/3.5"
"This one is for after dinner and before bed time. Would probably be great for a beer float if it weren't so great on its own. I'd recommended using something less complex that is not so tasty by itself if you want to float some ice cream."
""
""
"Overall - Sometimes, less is more. Such is the case here with Vanilla Oatis. The standard Oatis is a very, very good oatmeal stout: multi-layerd, with lots of flavor. Adding vanilla melds all those flavors together, making a beer that, at best, hits on two notes. Fair to good beer overall, but I'd take the original version everytime over this variation."
"Poured from a 650ml bottle. Pours a deep blackish-brown colour with some nice tan head. The smell is big on creamy chocolate notes. The taste is quite rich with the vanilla showing up as a sort of burnt marshmallow flavour. There's a bit of smoke in there as well as some chocolate and coffee notes. The vanilla component is complementary without domination. Nice."
""
""
""
"O: A pleasure to drink. Looks smells taste very quality. Just a tiny hint of the 7.2% i would drink this regularly. Funny i like my IPAs bitter but my stouts sweet. Good price too."
""
""
""

"Beautiful use of vanilla right here. It's sultry and smooth, sweet and savory."
"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours pitch black with a fine, one finger light brown head with great retention and lacing. Sweet aroma dominated by vanilla with light toasted malt. Flavor is toasted malt, coffee and quite distinct, but well integrated, vanilla. Starts semi-sweet, finishes dry and crisp with bitter coffee and light hops. Medium, creamy body with nice mouth feel. A nicely made oatmeal stout with deft use of vanilla flavoring, nicely balanced. I'll watch for this the next time it arrives."
""
""
"O: oatis is good and made better by vanilla. But everyone know vanilla makes dark beers better."
""
""
""
"Overall: Try it!"
"The body was pleasing solid, but there was a lingering sticky-sweetness on the finish. Drinkability was good, but the sweetness detracted from the overall, enjoyment. A very good, solid beer that's certainly worth trying if you see it."
"O: I would happily have a couple pints of this again. Strong characterful stuff that isn't oppresssive, and on this account, the medium bodied mouthfeel helps the drinkability. Going in to this looking for a huge blockbuster of a beer will leave you disapointed, but it's a very nice medium bodied stout with an excess of delicious character."
"O:Pass"
"Drinkability is very good. This is a fantastic vanilla stout. One of my favorite regional stouts is really on another plain with the addition of the vanilla beans. Rarely seen, but always ordered!"
"All things considered, this is a very solid beer, one that I prefer considerably to the regular Oatis. Wish Ninkasi would make this available all the time."
"I tried this beer at the Ninkasi tasting room. I was quite surpised from this beer. I am a huge fan of Oatis, and I am now a bigger fan of the Vanilla Oatis. Poured via tap into a pint glass by a sexy female bartender. Light creamy head with sweet vanilla aroma. The beer, not the bartender. I hope this comes out in bottles soon. I wasn't able to take the brewery tour due to construction."
"- One must invent a devise to hold the mouth open for full time pour of Vanilla Oatis into my mouth... huge fan!"
