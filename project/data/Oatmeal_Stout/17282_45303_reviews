"Just an all-around fantastic beer. Enough said."

""
""
"Decent flavor.  Not over the top coffee taste.  Probably better when it's fresh.  Samples received a little dated."

"Excellent balance of black coffee with black malts, each jumps out while neither dominates. The coffee is a heavy roast, and the big bitterness plays well. There's a subtle,  bready caramel undertone. But dark chocolate and roasted beans are the big flavors."
""
"Good stuff.  I'll revisit when I get the chance."
"The flavor does not have that strange flaw really, but instead has light roasted malt, cocoa, and lots of great stiff espresso coffee flavor. A really well integrated coffee beer, albeit on the lighter side of robust qualities at 6%."
""
"O - A very good beer.  Definitely an upfront coffee flavor but the coffee allows some other flavors room to breath.  A real nice stout."
""
"After looking forward to trying this beer for a while, I have to say I did not enjoy it at all unfortunately. Looked like an average stout at the pour; trended toward dark brown hues rather than the pitch black color of other stouts. Aroma was faint coffee...not much else. Taste was extremely unbalanced to me: all I got from it was bitter, astringent coffee grounds. No oatmeal sweetness at all. Very chalky tasting and extremely thin bodied as well.  I guess I was hoping for something along the lines of Terrapin WNB with this one and it just didn't come anywhere near stacking up. I have enjoyed other offerings from Good People, but this is by far the worst thing I have tried from them to date."

"Most definatly one of my favorite beers, smooth, flavorful, and balanced"
"Aroma creamy vanilla, coffee, malty, chocolate. Taste light coffee, cocoa, cocoa."
""

"Rock solid look and smell, with coffee clearly dominating the profile. But that same domination in the taste isn't particularly pleasant and comes off as almost artificial. The mouth feel is also very thin and watery, which isn't what I want in an oatmeal stout. Not a bad beer by any means, but I was hoping for more."

"Moderately bitter aftertaste with simulated expresso."
""
"Pours deep dark brown, just about black, with a big chocolate head. Aroma is dark and roasty with the coffee being nice and present, chocolatey,  oats give off some sugary sweetness, and closes out earthy and bitter. Flavor follows suit. I just wish they could have lowered the dosage of hops here, far hoppier than I enjoy in a stout personally. A creamier medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, a fantastic stout up until the hops assert themselves, making it is just a really good stout (for me). That said, the more I drink of this the less an issue the hops become."

"Had a taste of this at the brewery in Birmingham with the boys while attending Barber Vintage Moto Fest...next stop...Dreamland BBQ!"

"I'm usually not a big stout guy, but will definitely have this one again."
"Overall: this is a good beer.  However, I feel like the roasty elements bring too much bitterness; good, but not outstanding when it comes to drinkability."

"I Had this beer on tap at the Good People brewpub and was impressed (admittedly, I had low expectations). It wasn't life changing, but dependable enough for me to buy a six pack the next day. Unfortunately, the bottled version is much too carbonated and somewhat overhopped. The Williamette hops are more apparent than the coffee by a wide margin, and the mouthfeel is almost shockingly rough for an oatmeal stout, generally prized, of course, for a soft yet robust chewiness. This beer is certainly off the mark for its style, and sadly fails carve out a satisfying niche of its own. Perhaps worth a try if you place a great value on trying new things. It is not a complete failure, but neither is it a worthy successor to its esteemed predecessors (FBS, Sam Smith Oatmeal Stout)."

"O: A good stout but somewhat on the abrasive side. Could benefit from a little more sweetness in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I like it. Not as much as some of my favorite breakfast coffee stouts like Wake-n-bake and FBS, but I will definitely make sure I have these in my fridge for those chilly nights. Very reasonably priced too."
""
"O - It's good and it's solid. I just think the rating is a bit biased towards where it's distributd."
""
"O: I can see why this one's so popular. Rich and robust coffee wakes up the palette. Would love to try it on tap."
"O - Good People brews good beer. This is a good example. Good enough."
""

"Overall this was really good. Well worth a try."

"O-A damn good stout. Doesn't lie as most GP brews. The expected notes are in your face and it is balanced fairly well. If they thickened the brew it would be exceptional."
""

"No flaws, the flavor profile was perfect. The overall taste seemed to improve throughout the glass. Some aroma was lacking. It belongs near the top of the southern 50. The color and cascading was excellent with a rich head. The malt taste was not overalls complicated either. It finished dry but still had a hint of velvet mouthfeel."
""
""
""
"O: Another great beer from a great brewery. I've not tried anything from them that wasn't awesome."
""
""
"O: My favorite of GP's many great beers."
""
""
""
"Overall, I could see this beer being perfect on a cold, rainy day, but was pretty tasty even in the hot Alabama summer."
""

"All in all I thought it was fine but perhaps I didn't think as highly of it as most seem to."

"Smells like a good iced coffee, tastes even better, strong espresso, not getting much oatmeal, maybe a bit of chocolate with a nice hoppy kick. Very tasty on a cold day, can't wait to see this canned, I will be making the 3h trip to pick more up!"

"Another good brew from the the state of Alabama. Listed as a Coffee Oatmeal Stout, this brew fully delivers on the coffee flavor with a hint of bitter chocolate. Pours with a good one finger of tan head that leaves plenty of lacing. The coffee flavor tends to overshadow the oatmeal flavor but the more you drink it, the better it gets. This is a stout with a bite, but a good bite that leaves you wanting more. A good fall/winter type beer that should warm anyone's taste buds."
"Visited J. Clyde's in Birmingham and had a chance to try Good People's brew. Took the chance to try the coffee stout that was on tap. The beer poured very dark/opaque, rich with a creamy head & decent carbonation. The scent was strong coffee/espresso aroma with a nice smack of hops. The taste had even more coffee that was fairly well balanced with sweet malt. The mouthfeel was good, decent body to this beer. Probably could have two if it were snowing outside...but on hot days...I would stay away."
"I lost about an 1/8 of the growler and a good bit of the carbonation in transit, but the beer itself is still really good. Maybe one day I will try it at the source."
"Super rich, dark brown. Almost black. Creamy tan head that fades slow and leaves beautiful lace. The smell is full roasted with rich coffee notes dominating over a background of dark cocoa and chocolate malts. The taste follows the nose of roasted coffee, and chocolate with grassy, herbal, earthy hop notes lingering in the back. Very well balanced and delicious. Rich, thick and creamy on the mouth. Excellent beer."
"A great beer. Good for all seasons but really shines when the weather turns to crap."
"drinkability is nice. pretty good balance. a touch thin/dry for the style, and lacking somewhat in complexity. a decent stout."
"That the glass I am reviewing was free has not altered this review one bit. I think the same of this beer right now as I did when I was paying for pints of it at The Alcove right before their keg on HopSlam was tapped back on Thursday. This is simply one of the best regular(aka non-imperial) stouts that I've ever had."
"Overall, a great brew. For those who really love stouts, hops, and coffee, a great beer."
"Enjoyed this tasty drink as a cask conditioned brew at El Rey's First Monday Firkin, along with some delicious steak enchiladas (which it matched well with). Looking forward to tasting and reviewing the barrel-aged County Line version that I picked up this weekend"
"D- This beer sat pretty heavy on me. All in all I thought it was a delicious beer, an excellent representation of coffee flavored beers. The sweetness and general nature of this beer suggest that maybe this would be a good beer to finish the night on."
"Taste is pretty nice but a bit more restrained than the nose was. Still, good presence of chocolate, coffee, and roast. The body is nice and somewhat full; a bit creamy and it really serves to accentuate the beer's flavors. All in all, very nicely done and I'm glad those guys were walking around with this stuff. Thanks again."
"Drinkability is good. This is an easy drinker. The coffee is there and the rest of the flavor profile is pretty tasty. ABV is unnoticeable. Should be easy to finish off this growler with a few people. Looking forward to trying some more Good People brews."
"Overall I am very impressed. I would love to try this one on tap."
"This is a great coffee stout. I didn't know what to expect from this beer, or from this brewery, as I ordered it on a whim while passing through Birmingham. What I got was one of the best coffee stouts I have tried, and now I look forward to getting my hands on more beer from Good People Brewing."
"overall very solid and just a very, very good coffee beer. great balance and rich and sweet coffee flavor. super drinkable."
"Had this beauty on tap at The J. Clyde. I absolutely love everything about this beer! Made with Primavera coffee, there is no beer more ""local"" in Alabama. I cannot wait until they are capable of distributing outside of the state. This is the best stout to be found in Alabama!"
"Drinkability: I love the smell and flavors, but these offerings tend to come out a little lower for me due to the mouthfeel, but overall with this one, I'm quite impressed and would definitely pick up a sixer of it if I had the opportunity."
"Everything that you might have been hoping for when you took your first smell of the pint comes true in a big way once you take your first sip. There is a balanced brilliance to this stout that leaves you wondering why more microbreweries cannot make a stout as nice as this one. The coffee first hits the taste buds in a big way and the coffee highlights the quality of the roast used in the brewing process as there is not the slightest hint of any burnt coffee in the taste. There is a sweetness that also works its way into the stout behind the coffee, not in a milk stout kind of way, but rather in a way that almost perhaps just mentally gives the impression of a greater creamy nature to this stout. Roasted malts and a bit of dark chocolate rounds out the taste."
"Drinkability: A little too sweet for my tastebuds bud still a tasty take on the style"
"The strength of hops character in a brew of a style that often showcases just the coffee, a great surprise."
"Thanks UJ!!"
"On tap at the Mellow Mushroom in Tuscaloosa. Although a coffee oatmeal is not an English style, this beer struck me as having a very English stout creamyness that was very pleasant. A bit light on the carbonation, which may have been attributable to the dispensing system. Coffee flavor was not overwhelming, and the maltyness of the oatmeal was well managed."
"D: Wasn't planning on 2 pints, but it was so good I had to have a second. Great drinkability."
"Overall this was a very solid coffee stout and I'm intrigued by Good People's other offerings. Worth a shot."
"One of my favorites. Beautiful very dark brown color with a lovely fine brown head of foam that left nice rings of Belgian Lace in the glass. The nose was upfront coffee, oats, and chocolate. The tasted started with a fine mix of coffee and velvety oats/dark chocolate malt (breakfast anyone) with a nice balance of hops to malt. Not overly carbonated and very easy to drink."
"Such a great beer. Pours a deep black with tan head. Nose starts out with coffee, roastiness, etc. Taste is great. Deep roasty flavors, hints of coffee and semi sweet chocolate. Oatmeal lends the stout a smooth, velvety mouthfeel. Truly one of my favorite beers."
"A beer that feels every bit as good as it tastes, the GP Coffee Oatmeal Stout never fails to wow the taste buds. The coffee is prominent without being overbearing. The oatmeal lends a creamy mouthfeel to the beverage. The malt balances out with the bitterness of both the hops and coffee with no element overwhelming another. An excellent session beer, you will no doubt feel a bit perkier for having selected it."
"Growler picked up from Dee's package and consumed with some family and friends within a couple of hours. Pours a slightly murky brown with a light tan head that starts out pretty nice and fades to a thick ring. Some lacing. In the nose there is lots of coffee up front, some roastiness, and lots of bitterness. No cream in this coffee, this is black all the way baby. The taste is similar, with lots of stronf black coffee to start then a deep roasty bitterness. Quite intense and the effect is make this taste a good deal stronger than it actually is. It's actually got a little too much coffee taste in my book- too much to really appreciate any of the silkiness from the oatmeal or pick up other nuances. Still, I'm impressed with my first taste of a Good People's brew. I'll definitely be trying more."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth."
"The good folks from Alabama just want their hops to be freed. I had never heard of such a thing as a limit on the abv., especially as low as a 6% cap, just terrible. good luck to you in your quest and continue to make quality brews such as this."
"D- I am kind of picky when it comes to stouts. This one not only had me going the entire time but I also went on a walk to get another sample as soon as my first was about gone. I would drink this as a semi-regular if I could get it here."
"Very good beer. If given the opportunity, I would love GPBC to brew an Imperial version as a seasonal."
"D: Less drinkable than your typical oatmeal stout, but that's because this thing is suped up with coffee and flavor. Definitely one to sip on rather than gulp down. However, if they amped the body up a bit it might feel more like a sipper. Alas, when the ABV cap is lowered in this state they can up the malt and alcohol. Still, an enjoyable beer that went very well after my meal."
"The beer pours up with a nice thick head the color of coffee and cream. The smell is thick with roasted malt and coffee. The taste delivers on the roasted malt promise I got in the aroma. The taste of coffee is very strong, and plays nicely with the malt character. A surprising dose of hop bitterness comes in behind and clears the palette, making this a very quaffable beer. Despite the coffee taste, I think this stout would make a terrific night cap."
"D: Well the only negative thing I can say about this beer is that the mouthfeel could be a bit heavier in this stout. Still, that helps this beer in the drinkability category because it doesn't sit heavy at all and is one of the easiest drinking stouts I have ever encountered. Its simple, but still damned tasty and enjoyable. A good job goes out to the folks at Good People. Hopefully they keep it up and keep making some damn good brew."
"Pours a deep, dark black with a small, creamy tan head. Opaque and looks a little thin.Smells pretty good. a little coffee aroma but well balanced with bitter chocolate hints. first sip and I was hooked. Great balance of roasted malts and coffee. General consensus is this is as close as Terrapin Wake n Bake as an Alabamian can purchase inside state lines. Mouthfeel is a little thin but very enjoyable. If you like coffee stouts, you could drink this all night. Great beer while sitting under the heaters on an unusually cold Alabama October night. Seek this out, no telling how long it will last. Echoing some sentiment...hopefully this will become a staple in the Good People stable."
"d - goes down smoothly and is a great offering and hopefully this will be a GPBC regular."
"If you like coffee, or you like stouts... try this beer. Outstandingly good."
"But then the hops hit you. Glorious Willamette. Coffee on the front end, hops on the back end, and the dark malts lurking in between, popping out here and there. The hoppy aftertaste sucks you in, bringing you back for more and more and more. For anyone who likes coffee and hops, this is ridiculously drinkable. And you have no business ordering this if you don't like coffee. And if you're a hop head, well then all is right in the world."
