"Though I am not typically a fan of stouts, this one was solid. Not as thick as I expected, which was refreshing. Happy I tried it, but it didn't change my mind about stouts."
""
""
"Session stout. Would love to see it on nitro tap"
"Very solid outmeal stout. It has a gumball head taste to it with a nutty hint to it. It kind of has like a creamy pine flavour to it. It's hard to describe, it's very unique and is something you should pick up if you can get your hands on it"
""
""
""
"From the look and smell, which were excellent, I expected a stronger fuller flavor from this. It was a good beer but I didn't get the thickness or body I expected from an oatmeal stout, especially one from FFF."
""
"It is creamy, a different stout, a little stout notes of chocolate, and roasted malt, but creamy and smooth.  I like this one very much"
"a reallyl stout oatmeal stout hoppy at first but give it a few mins and its perfect haven't been too impressed with 3 floyd's offerings but this was solid"
""
"Anyway this isn't a bad beer.  Very unique and it fits with three floyds style of making unique beers.  I'm not a fan, but glad to have tried it."

""
""

"taste of grapes in this stout - maybe it was a bad bottle?"

"To me it's a pretty strange oatmeal stout. Weird fruit notes that I really enjoy, just can't pin them down. Unlike anything I've had from 3Fs."
""
"Amazing complex flavor. Nutty, vanilla, sweet but bitter at the same time. Unbelievable!"
""
"This was definitely was one of the most interesting beers I've tried. My wife ""didn't mind it", which is her way of saying it was a good beer. I'm undecided. I love stouts, but the upfront spice kick of this one seemed to take away from the traditional stout characteristics. The flavor and weight made for a strange overall texture. I have another bomber of this that I'm sure I'll drink sometime, but this one just wasn't what I was expecting, or maybe hoping for."
""
"The beer has a hoppy quality up front with light cocoa, and chocolate , some bitterness, licorice, and is slightly thing."
""
"O - I like this oatmeal stout - I've had it several times now. Low ABV makes this an easy drinker."
""
""
""
"A good/average oatmeal stout that doesn't stand out from any others, except that it is far more expensive. Had it on tap."
""
""
""
"O - 4 - Overall, a very good representation of the oatmeal stout style."
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like bubblelicious. Not my thing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good solid oatmeal stout for sure with some decent qualities."
"Smooth silky malty moderately sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed this beer, but for 5.9% it leaves something to be desired. I've had beers twice as strong and twice as smooth. The mouthfeel is a bit rough for a stout. Tastes good but its not anything incredible. Artwork is by far the coolest i've ever seen."
""
""
"so so for an oatmeal stout."
"Tastes like a much bigger beer than 5.90%. Nice of Three Floyds to not hop this beer to hell."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Studio 35 Columbus. Nice change of pace beer in between all the other hoppy pales from 3Floyds."
""
""
"Aroma roasted malt, anise vanilla, dark chocolate, licorice, earthy. Taste cocoa, vanilla, roastiness, burnt sugar, creamy mouth."

"Dark brown with an inch or so of soapy beige head. Aromas of vanilla, roast, chocolate. Vanilla bean/ extract character. Sweet vanilla & chocolate blend. Distant oatmeal, but vanilla just stands out. Tasty, yet imbalanced. Ok."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty nice oatmeal stout, definitely enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Does this have some smoked malts in it? No sweetness, dry, chocolate and some roasted qualities. It's ok."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Never had a beer quite like this. Enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Served at room temperature. Super dark and opaque. Dark tan thin head. Carmel, toffee, chocolate aroma. Some minor citrus. Coffee, sweet, alcohol.Oddly, I get iodine.  Milk mouth with slight bitterness. Enjoyable Oatmeal Stout. Would repurchase!"

"Great oatmeal stout!!! Holds up to a lot of other oatmeal stouts.  Great finish on this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A creamy, silky smooth chewy body has a touch of slickness and oiliness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's ok. An easy drinker but the flavors don't pop."
""
""
""
""
"O - Very strong effort by Three Floyds, this beer is the rare 6% stout that drinks like a beer with almost twice the alcohol.  It is a big, burly beast, and delivers huge stout flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Really solid stout from FFF."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Big flavor for an oatmeal stout, plenty of coffee, molasses, and earthy, herbal hops. Moderate stickiness suits a smooth mouthfeel with medium body. Alcohol is warm and invigorating, much more so than I would expect from 6% ABV."

"Gotta give some props to my man Alex for grabbing a bottle o' this whilst swinging through Munster on a trip and sharing it here with us.  This stuff pours a dark black-brown topped by a finger of leather-tan foam.  The nose comprises roasted malts, mild molasses, light graham cracker, cocoa, and a hint of leafy greens.  The taste brings in more of the same, everything going according to plan until a wave of milk-chocolatey sweetness bubbles through the center, washing over all through the finish.  A nice surprise, really.  The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a relatively full feel.  Overall, a damn solid stout, probably the best Three Floyds offering I've had in a while."

"Nothing special, best quality was the thickness from the oatmeal"

"Appearance is black as night with a decent tan head that dissipates somewhat quickly, decent lacing but nothing amazing. Smell is sweet molasses, dark chocolate with a light hop aroma and toasted notes coming through as it warms. Flavor follows suit with the nose - the hop flavor lingering throughout the roasted malt and sweetness (maybe sweetened with lactose) which is quite nice - I didn't expect such a hoppy oatmeal stout and was pleasantly surprised. The mouthfeel is silky smooth like a proper oatmeal stout, light bitterness from the hop lingers in this medium-bodied ale with mellow carbonation. Overall phenomenal take on an old classic style. Leave it to Three Floyds to take a classic style of old and spin it with a modern twist - nice work fellas!"

"The sour/acrid note is offputting, and it's a bit hot, but nice malt character."

"Overall, not at all enjoyable. Would love to have this as it is supposed to taste."
"Final Word: Highly recommended for anyone that enjoys stouts or coffee! This brew was creamy, full flavored, well balanced and nuanced, and all of the flavors felt very true to the ingredient. The vanilla tasted like vanilla bean and not vanilla extract, and the coffee had the richness of real, fresh brewed, whole bean coffee. The caramel flavors brought the creamy texture, sweet vanilla, and bitter coffee together in perfect harmony, as if you were drinking a high quality cappuccino. Again, highly recommended!"

"O: A creamy, chocolatey, smooth drinking stout with a significant hop character. This one isn't going to win any awards but it sure goes down nice. The hop character was a little unexpected and I want to try this after it has a few months on it. Luckily I bought a second bottle at DLD."

"i like how different this is, maybe i wouldnt pick it out as having oatmeal right away if i was blinded on it, there is more bitterness and less body and residual sugar than i am used to in the style, but like three floyds always does, this has a twist that works quite well. its jet black, obsidian, impenetrable to light, but not overly bubbly with just a quarter inch of surprisingly light khaki fizz. the nose is bitter, bakers chocolate and simply dark dark barley, roasted to a near char, which gives an interesting aroma. the flavor is bitter from start to finish too, and i never really get what the oatmeal does to this. normally it mellows with body and creamy texture, as well as sweetens up the overall experience just a tad, but thats all absent here and the beer drinks a little runny as a result. carbonation is there though, i just find myself looking for a little more body, or something to counter balance the bitterness after the swallow, but they never come. overall a very impressive offering, just different enough to be memorable, but i would not put it anywhere near the best from this brewery. still, always a treat to drink their stuff, and i admire how this one is just black as coal, apologetically. it finishes with just a hint of that permanent marker scent their collaboration with brewdog did, but its unremarkably mild in comparison."

"O: Not what I was expecting from an ""Oatmeal Stout."" The base was much too thin and the sweet and sour melancholy left me thinking I was drinking a sour. The cocoa tones are unique and strong, like huffing a box of pure coca, but the overall taste and balance were a little lacking."
""
""
""
""
""

"O - okay I'm not totally satisfied with Backmasking. Sure, I think FFF make world class stuff, but come on.. You make me look at some ignorant Satanic label that I just don't understand, charge me 12.99 and give me a 5.9% oatmeal stout with a better ale in Rich Life coming the same day for the same price. Kicking myself I didn't buy a 3rd Rich life and left this sitting. Sure, its a good oatmeal stout, but I just don't get the release.. Not alongside something like Live a rich life. But hey, what do I know? If you are looking for a FFF oatmeal stout then grab it. It's a good stout, I just didn't find it great."

"Three Floyd's can brew. An oatmeal stout from those guys? Fucking delicious! This beer has lactic sweetness, roast, balancing hop bitterness, and huge depth with a velvety mouthfeel you want to crawl into. I'll be drinking this when I see it from now on."

"Pitch black with a finger width brown coffee head. The nose emits a little roast but not a lot of other things pop out. The taste is a straight forward oatmeal stout. It has that sort of funk from the oat that oatmeal stouts are known for. It's got a nice roast that rounds all the flavor together. Most of all it is full flavored while clocking in at a sessionable ABV."
"Very viscous brown turns pitch black in the glass. A large tan head that lingers. Massively roasty and touches of cocoa on the nose. Very roasty, with milk chocolate. Roasty and dry like coffee. lots of vanilla. A perfectly balanced bitterness. Easy drinking. Doesn't drink like a beer as strong as it is. One of the best non aged stouts."
""
""
""
"Why is this getting lukewarm reviews? I can only guess it's because (A) people have come to expect ""extreme"" beers from Three Floyds and this one is not extreme or (B) this is a rather expensive bottle of what is basically a standard representation of the style. I have to rate it below ""excellent"" for reason (B) (yes, I take price into consideration when I review a beer). It's not as good as Anderson Valley's Barney Flats or Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout and it's considerably more expensive. That doesn't compute (even if the bottle does have some nice, paganistic ""death metal"" artwork). Nice beer, but overpriced and for fans of the the style only."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel is good. Moderately thick body is cut nicely with a mild charred bitterness. Very light carbonation keeps this a nice sipping beer."
"The cover art and my love for Three Floyds made me buy it, but I wouldn't seek it out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A rather nice take on the style."
""
""
""
"Trailing with a sense of campfire and ash, the beer's minerally finish speaks more to the tradition of brewing than it does to tomorrow thereof. But it's a delightful beer, especially when you don't have to think about it too much."
"Anyhoo. The beer itself wasn't too bad. Solid looker. Up front there's a smooth mix of chocolate with a bit of vanilla. Rather sweet, and pleasant. A slight pine tinge comes through from the hops. Kind of a side journey from the initial impression and it finds itself going nearly citrus. Not sure what that's about. It lacked legs going back, and its price point insures that it will be a one and done for my drinking rounds."
""
""
""
""
""
"O) Not worth it. It tastes like mouthwash. I'll try again on tap if it comes around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Average all around, but they nailed the chocolate flavor in it."
""
"Beer is medium in body, with carbnation of medium intensity, resulting in a foamy (9/10) and smooth (1/10) mouthfeel that's a bit too foam-intense for the style, which never allows the smoothness from the oats to be particularly noticeable. Ethanol is surprisingly obvious as a modest burn on the palate and back of throat, warmth in the nostrils. Closes quite dry, with heavy stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- It is a good beer nothing that blows me away but if I was at 3 floyd's or saw it in a store I would pick it up again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice balance of mellow bitter roast and sweet chocolate notes in the taste. Supple and medium bodied, easy to drink, with a substantial presence. Some malt complexity rounds it out, lingering mocha flavors in the aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a fantastic stout. Wish I could get more of it."

"D - A solid stout that I'd happily drink again. I liked the aroma a bit more than the flavor in the balance between sweetness and roast, but the taste is thankfully quite restrained in char too. Nate and I had no problem sharing a pint of this one, and it's a nice dark option with an otherwise hop-heavy tap list."
""
""
""

""
""
""

"O - Imagine a sweeter oatmeal stout version of alpha klaus and you have backmasking. It has the chocolate and roasted malt that you'd expect from an oatmeal stout while also having a good hop presence that you'd expect from FFF"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid oatmeal stout. Definitely check this one out."
"O: Very nice oatmeal stout overall. Enjoyed the notes of espresso immensely."
""
"O - a decent beer, not catching the oatmeal part of this one. Served pretty chilled for what I normally would drink at Stout at, it was around 40 F. But seeing as it was served at the Brewpub, I figure they would serve it at its best temperature."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'll be honest, this was probably my fourth or fifth beer of the night, but it was tasty! Got chocolate and maybe a hint of coffee in the taste and smell. This is by far the best stout I've had from 3 Floyd's. Next time I'll try and be a bit more sober for a proper review, but this was a awesome brew. If your at the brewpub get a pint and enjoy it!"
