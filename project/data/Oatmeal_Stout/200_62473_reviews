"The Verdict: Not bad. As with most of Mendocino's offerings, it is a decent example of the style but not much more. In other words: average."

"Yummy with mash potatoes and gravy"

"Pours black with a three finger tan mocha head. Smells roasty and nutty like chocolate, annis, maybe a little coriander. The flavor is okay. A little things for my taste. Also there is a bit of an off flavor that I can't quite put my finger on."

"with the added smoothness that oatmeal brings.  A most solid stand by stout."

"03/18/14 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Not what I expected. Most oatmeal stouts I've tried are very smooth & on the creamy side. This taste is much less viscose & a tad bitter, almost acidic. Not bad but with a 6% ABV the cost in terms of my alcohol consumption 'allowance' out weighs the enjoyment factor. Gnome sane?"

"Pours a really dark brown/almost black in color with close to a 1-finger beige head that settles down to around the sides on top. Some spotty lacing is seen with each sip but not a lot. The aroma is of roasted malts and coffee for the most part. the taste is pretty much the same with a hint of bitter-sweet chocolate in the mix as well. A real light bitter finish."

"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with an inch and a half tan head after a strong pour. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like roasted malt, oats, coffee, and chocolate. I think the taste is just like the aroma, except that that there's a bit of dark fruitiness noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and has a good amount of carbonation. I think it's a good Oatmeal Stout, definitely worth trying."

"O: Its not an awful stout, but comparatively there are just many more complex and more enjoyable examples of the style at similar price points. Pick up if you are new to the style, if you aren't, this will be a disappointment to you."
""

"Had this on cask at the local pub. It was the 2nd day of the cask, had a nice head to it the aroma was slight caramel and oats. The oatmeal taste was fantastic. Cask is the best way to enjoy this stout, it really brings out the taste. Had this on bottle once and thought it was just a middle of the road beer. Cask makes all the difference."
""
"O- the taste really hits hard. Everything else about this beer is good to great, but that big blast of odd bitterness is really hard on the first few sips."
"A great oatmeal stout. Great body and flavor although it could have been more full. Smell is slightly lacking but may just be from bottle. Would love to try this on draft somewhere or in a growler. Would recommend for most Oatmeal Stout lovers. I would say this is a must try."
""
"We are huge dark beer fans and this is our favorite 'every day' stout. Pours beautifully and has that great 'Guinness' appearance. Packed with flavour, never disappoints. We get regular growler fills from Old Saratoga Brewing Co, tasting room. $7"
"One of my favorite oatmeal stouts. I love that it is located locally, and that I can stop in for samples. Their whole line seems to reasonably priced. Last year I only bought a six pack then I found out it was seasonal. This year I already have a case, and I am headed to Minogues for another growler of it Yum!"
"very drinkable beer, could easily drink several.. and for 7$ a sixpack, you cant go wrong at all. definatly improved my overall opinion on mendocino brewing company. the welcome addition of smoke really made this beer for me. highly recommended IMHO."
"O - This is just a great all around oatmeal"
""
""
"O: solid, although not exceptional, offering. No surprises good or bad."
""
""
"The aftertaste is easy to take (it fades to a little bit of bitter). It would have been nice to see this same brew a bit more over the top - imperial. As is, it is a good value and not an insult to drink."

"O-A really decent oatmeal stout with the full range of rich flavors that you want from the style. It seems to be well balanced, and is really hitting the spot during this chilly Spring night after a long day in the sun. I have nothing bad to say about this beer; and, at a price like that, how could I complain?"

"It pours almost black, but in reality it is a very dark brown. It sports a mocha head with moderate retention and excellent lacing that cascades slowly down teh sides of the glass. The aroma carries hints of smoke and dark chocolate. Lots of burnt malt detectable. The taste follows suit. Slight smokiness with a lot of grain. bitter chocolate in teh finish with a slightly sour aspect. the mouthfeel is a little light, but the carbonation follows suit nicely. Very nice beer. hearty, yet surprisingly mellow."

"Overall a good and quite straightforward stout. Oats add a creamy feel and finish but the light carbonation limits the love here."
""
""
"Overall: I'm pleasantly surprised by this beer. I wasn't expecting the world, but Mendocino has delivered a serviceable, indeed quite tasty, Oatmeal stout. I'd definitely have this again."

"The flavor is more true to form--more burnt bitter malt. Like many stouts, this one is thin, perhaps thinner than most. Mild finish of over-roasted malt, but it lingers forever."
"This is a medium to lighter bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. The alcohol is well integrated. I have a couple gripes about this brew. The first being the mineral quality present in the flavor profile was not that enjoyable mixed with a hint of sulfite. The other gripe I have is in the body of this brew, it is lacking just a bit and seems lighter than it should for being advertised as an oatmeal stout. I would have liked to seen a bit more fuller or smoother body from the oats. Otherwise this was a pretty good brew. The nose on this brew is an absolute beast, I would get it again just to smell it it is that good."
""
""

"Drinkability: Solid stuff. It is not extraordinary, but it is pretty tasty."
""
""
"O: Very easy to drink and enjoyable with a very pleasant mouthfeel to go along with nice flavors and aromas. Well balanced. Glad I found this one (not on the menu) when I peeked into the fridge behind the bar."
""

"Overall worth picking up. Simple, complex, and tasty."
""

"Darn near black. Seriously opaque. Fluffy, thick, rich head. Slow fade to a nice covering. Good amount of lace. Aroma is surprisingly sweet. Lots of roasted grains underneath with a bit of dark fruitiness. A touch of diacetyl. Taste is smooth and roasty. Burnt toffee and charcoal. Coffee flows through like a velvety latte. Finish has a nice firm earthy bitterness. Feel is on the lighter side with a gentle but crisp carbonation. Good solid brew"
"O- a bit sweeter than the average oatmeal stout, which makes it enjoyable, but a slow sipper. Still worth trying!"
""
"Let's not forget what it looks like! I cannot really judge appearance first thing, but half-way down, a huge sheet of foamy lacing coats the glass. The mocha colored head, chunky and foamy, has dissipated to a few random patches with a bubbly ring around the glass. The beer itself is a deep dark coffee black with a good cola-brown hue in the light."

"Overall - A promising stout, but it falls short of being great. The lack of hops causes this beer to be too sweet and one-dimensional, and kills any chance of being sessionable. Probably works best as a desert beer."

"Overall, quite average. I wasn't too impressed."
"Overall: A nice stout but nothing that I would seek out again."
""
"Quite quaffable, but I wouldn't be opposed to more oatmeal in this"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This was disappointing. I generally like Mendocino, but this one just wasn't that good."
""
""
"Full but a bit too lactic. Sour too. Nice and dark rich color. Pours a touch flat. Not too much toastiness but a nice. It of heavy malts. Nose is essentially nonexistent heavy feel that just oozes off the palate. I like this is a single or double bottle but would not have more than a few in a sitting."
"O - This is OK. It's a pretty simple-tasting beer, which is not in line with the nose. This is a bummer, man...that's a..that's a bummer."
"An alright stout that's lacking enough classic oatmeal stout characteristic that it leaves me somewhat sad I bought a sixer"
"Poured a very dark brown with a slight caramel colored head that didn't last very long. Virtually no lacing but carbonation lingers to outside of glass. Strong roasted malt and caramel scent. Mouthful is sweet with some carbonation. Tastes as it smells, strong roasted malt with a hint of caramel as you drink. One of the sweeter oatmeal stouts that I have had. Would buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a nice deep dark brown with some nice initial head, but ended soon and no lacing to speak of. Nice sweet malty scent, slight roastiness, but nothing very deep and dark. Nice flavors, with a bit of roastiness and a nice bit of sweetness from the oats, but nothing huge and deep. Went down quite well, nice and creamy. Not the best I've had, but a good oatmeal stout."
"O: The Ipswich was creamier and had a slight edge all around. This stout had an interesting molasses flavor though. Still, I think Ipswich is the winner."
""
"Decent, but there are a lot better to choose from."
"Scored a 6 pack of this for $6.99 at Ledgers's Liquors about a year ago. Drank 5 of them in the last year. Still have one left, in the course of the year, each one tasted the same as the last, indicates its pretty sturdy, sure some beers can taste great in a small window of time, this one tastes good in a large window of time."
""
""
"O: A solid, drinkable beer."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was black and poured a nice tan head. Unfortunately the head went away pretty fast. The beer had a fruity smell and strong coffee smell. The taste was a strong coffee finish with the oatmeal balancing out the taste with just enough sweetness to make it a great beer. I will buy again."
""
""
"O - Surprisingly good after a fairly average aroma. I really liked the chocolate in this oatmeal stout."
"Pours an opaque black with a 1/2 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, toasted oats, and some coffee/cocoa aromas. Taste is of dark roasted malt, toasted oats, and coffee beans. There is a nice roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. A bit thin for a stout in my opinion. Overall, this is a good oatmeal stout that is quite tasty and easy to drink. One of the better offerings from Mendocino."
""
""
"This may not be a world-class example of the style, but it is tasty and is easy drinking. I think I prefer it slightly to Mendocino's Black Hawk Stout."
""
"Mendocino isn't touted for creating extraordinary beers, and this is no exception. But as far as making a pleasant flavorful easy drinking smooth stout, they succeed here. It's easy to drink multiple, and a good starting point for someone getting into the darkies."
"Roasted malts, sweet with molasses and hints of brown sugar. mellow and a touch hoppier then I would have thought. Very nice chocolate notes here, really laid down quite well. Hints of molasses again and a decent touch of vanilla poking its head up. The finish comes through with a light bitterness and a touch of dark fruit."
"O- OATMEAL stout - easily recommended for those who like more than a hint of oatmeal in their stouts."
"Overall, a solid beer that I would be happy to drink again."
"It was just a bit too fake for me, but I’ll take the smoothness."
"overall, enjoyable, everyone try it if you like stouts"
""
"Had a bit of a mini tasting today with some Mendocino beers. This first one pours a bleak black-brown topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, buttery toffee, toasted wheat, and a kiss of cocoa. The taste brings in more of the same, with a touch more cocoa and buttery biscuit than before. Thankfully, the roast never gets overdone, as happens on many occasions in the oatmeal stout world. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth, creamy feel. Overall, a pretty nice oatmeal stout, one that doesn't amaze but pleases through and through."
""
"O- Not too shabby. I've only had a few beers by these guys before but they're starting to grab my attention."
"O- Overall, this is a solid oatmeal stout that is worth a try."
"Bottle. Black, small light brown creamy head, fair lacing and good retention. Great roasted malt aroma. The usual suspects are here: molasses, chocolate, coffee, toasty caramel. Mouth is medium-full with creamy carbonation, lightly dry. Flavor is lightly sweet with some coffee bean bitterness, and a mildly hoppy long finish. I am beginning to think that this is one of the easier styles to get right. A lot of breweries do it well. The Mendocino is a solid offering. Very tasty and true to form."
"D/O: This fine stout is similar to other worthy contributions by Mendocino in that it is a respectable example of the style without any pretense of reinvention or extremeness. It is approachable and satisfying, with flavors (but certainly not texture) that compare well to Firestone Walker's Velvet Merlin."
"Overall a very good Oatmeal Stout with pronounced alcohol and a straight laced Stout profile of roast, chocolate, malt, and supportive hops. A good switch up from that Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout from time to time."
"Pours a dark motor oil color with a tiny brown head. Leaves a lacing on the sides of the glass that crawls back into the abyss when swished around. The beer smells of chocolate, roasted malts, and the slightest hint of coffee. This beer tastes of stale, burnt coffee. Also caught notes of watered down chocolate oats. Unfortunately this beer doesn't taste anywhere near how it smells. The mouthful is pretty thin and I don't catch that silky smooth finish a good oatmeal stout contains. Overall this beer is very, very average. If it wasn't for the the decent appearance and smell, which are both pretty good, this beer would be very below average. Another average offering from Mendocino."
"12 ounce bottle from a winter beer mix pack. An unceremonious dumping into a pint glass produces a big cocoa-colored lather atop a black coffee body. Chocolate-covered coffee bean aroma with hints of sulfur and iron. Slight apple pie note and some phenols too. Flavor is old coffee and minerals, chocolate milk made with water instead of milk (I guess you'd call that chocolate water), charred coffee beans and a lingering metal note that recalls sucking on a penny. Unfortunately, this beer derives no full mouthfeel or silkiness from its use of oats, and so my tongue derives no satisfaction. About what I expected from Mendocino."
"Poured dark as a stout should. A small hot chocolate frothy head formed dissipating quickly... Earthy oats, chocolate and burnt malts dominated with a slight hint of coffee beans... Roasted malts/oats, hint of molasses, raisins, and some dark brown sugar sweetness... Medium bodied to almost dry as full flavor is drowned out due to the higher than expected level of carbonation... Nice roasted flavors keep it interesting."
"MF: Sweet and silky though with maybe just a little off flavoring which might limit drinkability."
"This is my first beer from Mendocino. If they are all of this quality, however, I'll be buying a lot more very soon."
"A wonderful rich chocolately oatmeal stout with a truly exceptional ""full-bodied feeling"" aroma. Love it. Yum. The light brown head is a nice contrast to the body. Taste is pretty good, but leaves me feeling a little empty in the middle. It has a wonderful, very drinkable light finish. All around just good, but not exceptional other than smell."
"D-Really easy drinking, but this beer is a little lacking in the flavor complexity category."
"Out of a bottle this beer was an opaque brown, color with a short lived head of tan foam. The retention of the skim, however, was good and it laced beautifully. The aroma was dry, roasted malt, leather, hints of meat and a little wet soil. The flavors were a compilation of baking chocolate, light coffee, roasted barley, more leather and. The mouthfeel was rich, the body full and the carbonation average."
"Drinkability: At first I found this drinkable but as time wore on I slowed up a bit and found myself want a bit of a break from the sharpness of the dark roast bitterness and licorice flavors. While I'd not refuse a second one I also have no strong desire to have a second one. It seems a reasonably well made beer but not quite what I prefer in an oatmeal stout. Next time I'll have a Fat Dog from Stoudts."
"Pours a dark, opaque brown color with a tiny tan head that leaves only a ring in the glass. Aroma of oatmeal, chocolate and roasted malts, mild coffee, earth, and molasses-like syrup. Flavor of oats, sweet chocolate malts, oats, mild coffee, cola syrup, molasses, and overripe plums. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a smooth, sweet, roasty mouthfeel. But, I've had way better oatmeal stouts. This one didn't put it together for me at all."
"D: This is a pretty decent example of the style and definitely flavorful enough to keep you sipping. Then again, I have had much better stouts. I would say this is a solid, above-average beer, but it doesn't have anything that will surprise you. It is quite drinkable, but it's heavy and really only tempting during certain times of the year."
"Drink>easy peasy"
"Dark charcoal appearance, full thicket of tan head with fine even lacing. Aroma soft herbal notes with dark chocolate and some soft creaminess. Dark fruit undertones wrapped in chocolate. Flavor has a strong fruitiness, dark chocolate hints of cocoa soft vanilla cream finish. Mouthfeel, is creamy mouthfeel is medium bodied soft carbonation. Drinkability overall is pretty decent not my favorite oatmeal stout, solid experience one of the better Mendocino brews I've had in recent times."
"Drinkability -- Not one of my favorites of the style. The roast character is just too much, bordering on ashy, and the acidity was distracting. Oatmeal stouts should really be smooth and mellow, a slam dunk in the easy-drinking category. This just doesn't possess those qualities."
" The beer has a good amount of caramel malt flavor with slight cocoa elements and mild roasted flavor with a mildly sweet taste and toffee notes with a nice smooth malt and pretty light bitterness throughout . the oatmeal is a decent stout...it is neither bad nor good -basically drinkable for the style but not stellar"
"M, D- Typical weight, but lacking any requisite maltiness one would expect from the style."
"not much else that isn't already here. Lacks the ""chewiness"" of most oatmeal stouts but still pretty darn good. I'm glad there is not watery flavor like some. My first from this brewery and hopefully not the last."
"D: No unbalanced flavors or alcohol stopping me from getting this one down, it's quite drinkable."
"very drinkable beer, drank 4 of these new years eve with a few other beers no problem. and for 7$ a sixpack, you cant go wrong at all. definatly improved my overall opinion on mendocino brewing company. the welcome addition of smoke really made this beer for me. highly recommended IMHO."
"Overall, in case you couldn't tell, I greatly enjoyed this beer. I was very pleasantly surprised, not expecting much (no particular reason, just had no reason to expect more), and it turned out to be quite a tasty brew. Definitely very glad I took a chance on it."
"I would like this more if it finished a little drier with a roasted malt bitter kick."
"A nice brew if not a mind blower."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Grainy and burnt up front, moderately acidic with a smoky undertone. Not particularly rich or sweet, this oatmeal stout is heavy on blackened malt and licorice flavors. Medium in body though quite dry, this could use more sweetness and less acrid roasted bitterness."
"Drinkability is fair, but the heft of it may deter people from imbibing many in a sitting."
"D: 2 I didn't really like this beer, which is a surprise to me since I usually love stouts. I think I will be giving the other 5 away."
"Drinkability: easy quaffing stout. Nice roasted flavors keep it interesting."
"D - Overall, good mix of flavors that stay well balanced and a smooth beer. Only minor complaint is it could be a bit heavier bodied overall. But, still a very drinkable beer."
"Pours a dark, molasses-like color with a thin cap of dark tan head. The aroma smells of oatmeal and roasted/burnt malt over undertones of chocolate and cherry. Big, creamy body upfront with lots of black patent malt, bitter chocolate flavors with some sweetness mixed in. The finish lingers heavy and chalky on the tongue and the body is full. Overall, I would rate this as a solid, if not outstanding Oatmeal Stout."
"A very nice oatmeal stout and the best Mendocino beer I have tried."
"D/M: really smooth drinking brew. Goes down nice with a great taste that makes drinking it a real joy. Quite nice overall. Well done mendocino"
"The tan froth leaves spots of sticky residue on the sides of the mug, and you take a bite and a sip and smile at her, making sure her teeth stopped chattering and her ears are warm under her thick furry hat. She smiles back at you with a wonder in her eyes as the snow begins to fall ever so gently and her breath comes out misty as the hot espresso evaporates. The chocolate, milky nougat, and espresso combine in one note... thick and chewy, creamy and silky, sweet and roasty, milky and chocolatey, altogether delicious. What a wonderful, simple, rare night. Savour the moments."
"d: Very drinkable and smooth. Great after dinner beer."
"A pleasant and plausible stout from a not-always plausible producer."
"Good stuff."
"Drinkability: Easy enough to drink but there is something possibly in the lactose+burnt+carbonation characteristic that is a bit off-putting."
"drinkability - i want my oaty stouts to be smooth and this one is not"
"6% is a bit high for an oatmeal stout imo, but it does not detract at all since it really isn't that high. A fine carbonated almost creamy body. Lighter side of mid, goes down quite easy. The slight chalkiness is the only detractor for me."
"Poured jet black,no highlights even when held to the light,fluffy mocha colored head atop that settled pretty slowly leaving no lace behind.At first the aromas were somewhat muted but after a minute sitting in the glass some nice cocoa,earth,and vanilla note showed themselves nicely.Low carbonation feel giving the beer an almost creamy feel wich was real nice.Mellow roasted flavors along with cocoa powder,a tinge of dark fruit,and a milk stout-like lactose sweetness in the finish.A solid oatmeal stout here,I was pleasantly surprised I have to say."
"Good easy drinking stout, Mendocino continues to make some of the best buys in the craft beer section."
"Overall a decent Oatmeal Stout. Alcohol has a strong presence for a 6% beer. definitely worth a try."
"Pours and oily black color with a nice cocoa colored head that retains OK and leaves nice lacing. The aroma is a little dissapointing with some milk chocolate, coffee, roast, and dark fruit notes along with a bit of earthy hops. The flavor is more complex, with dark chocolate and espresso upfront, some molasses, dark fruits (plum and black cherry), burnt bread and some earthy hops. The mouthfeel is smooth and rich, and drinkability is pretty good. A pretty solid Oatmeal stout, admirably dry but lacking the complexity of the best of it's style."
