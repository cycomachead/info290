Aroma is malt, heavy roast, coffee. Flavor is similar to nose with nice balance between malt sweet, malt roast, carbonic tang, and malt, hop, yeast bitter. Body is good, ditto carbonation with only little points, yet compensating chewyness. Finish is like flavor, of average length, and very easy to have more. A tip of the hat to the brewer.","drpimento","Apr 17, 2012"

There is a bit of spotty lacing, but it is very sparse. The first thing I thought when I smelled this beer was roasty. This is very very roasty with a bit of chocolate and not much else. It is pleasant, but on the way to being too roasty. The flavor, however, is too roasty. It tastes like a ton of burnt malt was in this one. It overwhelms everything else, sort of tastes like eating a handful of patent malt. Not horrible, but very overly roasty, and burnt. Mouthfeel does not give you the creamy smooth texture that I like, and it is a bit light, but it is ok. This beer is really nice, but could definitely be improved upon.","Agold","Jan 31, 2012"

The taste is really good. I like this stout. It has a nice full body that is not over powered by ABV. The roast with chocolate undertones really balance nicely.

In my opinion, if you're going to call your brew Down n Dirty Oatmeal Chocolate Stout, you'd better bring your A game because you're going to have to throw down with Founders, Rouge, Southern Tier, etc. which make incredible chocolate stouts. Down n Dirty was good and quite drinkable, but is not in the same league as the others. Nose was pretty faint. Body was a little thin IMO.

The taste is phenomenal. Strong hints of roasted barley, sweet chocolate, and oatmeal. Mouthful is pretty thin and there isn't much carbonation there. Overall I love this beer. There are a few characteristics that don't make this beer world-class, but the taste makes up for those and puts this into an elite category of good beers. I will definitely have this on my radar to grab in the future.","brian44556","Apr 11, 2011"

Milk chocolate comes through during the sip with lingering dark chocolate in the finish. There is also nice backing roasted malt and graham cracker.

The nose comprises roasted malts, light coffee, dark chocolate powder, chocolate syrup, light molasses, and a touch of smoke in the background. The taste darkens things decidedly, including deepening the roast, lightly acidifying the coffee, further darkening the chocolate, and slightly amping up the smoke character. The body is a light-feeling medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a fairly smooth feel.

The coffee is actually really light and kind of subtle. The featured aroma is really bitter chocolate. It has some light funk to it. The flavor is both sweet and bitter chocolates with a light coffee roast. It's drinkable and not too sweet. It's a good beer but it really makes me want a Doubly Down 'N Even Dirtier.

A lot of beers with such a roasty profile get really astringent, but not this beer. It seems like the cocoa nibs help balance things out a little bit to counter the roast, but ultimately it's pretty lopsided on the roasty side, and I love that. If there was a little more dark caramel flavor in the mid-range, I could easily see this contending for one of the best stouts of any kind I've ever had.

3.62,-8.1,3.5,4,3,4.5,4,"D - The mouthfeel makes this beer. Without it, it would be rather bland. The cocoa and additional flavors just seem to be a bit thin to me. It's not bad at all though. A good drinking Oatmeal.","BeerFMAndy","Mar 21, 2010"
3.98,1,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"The pour is clear yet opaque in the glass with better than a full finger foamy tan head that fades slowly leaving a good amount of Belgian lacing behind each mouthful. The nose is dominated by that semisweet NECCO malt chocolate grainy oatmeal. The mouth feel is well carbonated, medium full body that adds a smooth texture to compliment the oatmeal and roasted malt flavors that clean up pretty quickly. At 6.3% ABV this one is a nice drinker. Enjoyed considering it; many thanks Pops!","jjayjaye","Mar 19, 2010"
4.23,7.4,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Deep malty nose gives way to a rich, roasty flavor with more than a hint of chocolate and silkiness of oatmeal. Deep subtle chocolate makes this parable with dessert, and the finish is nicely balanced, not sweet at all. Superb. Light yet heavy mouthfeel, silky and smooth. I am loving this as an alternative to those 12oz stouts that I feel I must share because of the abv power. This one I could have a few of my own. Well done.","robbyc1","Mar 18, 2010"
4.15,5.3,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Tastes pretty much the same as it smells. Rough oatmeal, smooth chocolate. Medium sour and medium sweet. Very nice and rich.","mynie","Mar 16, 2010"
3.6,-8.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Well, good beer, but I'm a bit confused by it. The flavors don't come together all that well, & the advertised chocolate is a bit weak. They've made so many excellent beers I always expect the most out of Tyranena, but this one falls short of previous standards they've erected.","maximum12","Mar 16, 2010"
3.78,-4.1,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"D- Easy to drink and I could definitely kick back a few. I will purchase it again when I am looking for a lighter stout.","RJay","Mar 14, 2010"
3.53,-10.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured a very dark brown with a decent-sized tan head. The nose has some nice portions to it, with chocolate and a bit of sweetness; however, the roasted character of the malt kind of outshadows everything else, making this fairly one-dimensional. The taste is quite similar, with a bit of hop bitterness added. Mouthfeel is medium with adequate carbonation. Drinkability is okay, definitely affected by the sometimes-harsh character of the beer. Not the best I've had from Tyranena, but one I was certainly glad to try. Thanks again, Barry.","Thorpe429","Mar 14, 2010"
4.6,16.8,4,4,5,4,5,"Drinkability - Tyranena is perhaps Wisconsin's best brewer. This might be their best beer. Not quaffable, but a few of these should make the night go better.","scaliasux","Mar 12, 2010"

4.03,2.3,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"On tap at Stubs. Pours a nearly black, dark brown color with a small off-white head, no lacing. Average aroma, nothing really sticks out here. Some light chocolate is buried deep in there somewhere underneath the light sweetness. Taste is great. Smooth, silky chocolate, light graham cracker, toasty, dry finish. The oats really add an excellent silkiniess to this brew, and it's incredibly easy to drink. Soft, yet has a nice hop bitterness on the backside. Good oatmeal stout.","KeefD","Feb 28, 2010"
4.03,2.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Roasty with a hint of cocoa and bitterness. Lingering mild ashy aftertaste. Seems pretty clean and easy drinking, I have no issue with the carbonation. Fairly smooth due to the oatmeal content i'm guessing. Not too filling, but a substantial brew that's big on flavor. Nice job Tyranena...","emerge077","Feb 26, 2010"
4.33,9.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall, a solid stout coming from Tryanena, whom I've come to expect great things from. Glad I got a chance to try this on tap, as I will definitely be revisiting this in bottles.","Mistofminn","Feb 26, 2010"
4.47,13.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,4,"Overall, a fantastic beer, I'd highly recommend it. First one I've had from Tyranena, which seems to be a relatively new brewery, but I'll eagerly look for from them in the future.","AmberMan22","Feb 23, 2010"

4.21,6.9,5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"This black bodied beer has a thick crop of rocky brown froth on top that leaves behind enormous amounts of lace. Good dose of chocolate, oatmeal and roasted barley aromas on the nose. And some liquid caramel for good measure. Not quite as big as some of their other experimental porters and stouts, but nice nonetheless. As it should be, this oatmeal stout is silky smooth and velvety. Medium bodied or so. Nice bitter roasted malt/barley flavor. Bittersweet chocolate character is fairly low. Burnt malts and a little oily smokiness come into the picture as well. As expected, well done. Good depth and complexity.","Bighuge","Feb 17, 2010"
4.45,12.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D: Excellent stout! How cool would it be for Tyranena to throw a batch of this in some Bourbon barrels...just to see what would happen?","GbVDave","Feb 16, 2010"

4.23,7.4,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D. This is an impressive offering from Tyranena. It is well made and really easy to drink. A nice change from so many "big" stouts that hit the market this time of year. Having 3 or 4 of these beers in a night would not be a chore. Worth seeking out - recommended.","bound4er","Feb 13, 2010"
4.3,9.1,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"D: yet another winner from Tyranena. They really have some impressive beers and this is no exception. I look forward to any stout or porter they may come out with","homebrew311","Feb 12, 2010"

4.25,7.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Very drinkable and goes down quickly. I would have to guess this is around 6% alcohol which is more than your typical OS. Really great representation of style here with a unique touch of bigger body and chocolate. Highly recommend.","jera1350","Beers"
