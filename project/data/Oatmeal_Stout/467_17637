Poured a very nice dark brown color, almost black, produced a tan average head, retention was average and it left ample lacing on the glass. The aroma of this stout consisted of roasted grain, and milk chocolate. Full bodied, this stout is smooth, creamy slick- You notice the mouthfeel almost before you taste anything. Roasted grain, milk chocolate, a splash of coffee complete the flavor profile of this beer. Excellent session beer, very nice example of a traditional oatmeal stout.","GossageBrewery","Aug 26, 2012"

Chocolate floats around as usual, pretty nice overall. The taste offers much more of that charcoal smoke with sweet apple malt and more subtle coffee hints. This is sweet and smooth with a slightly dry finish but quite drinkable for the style. Decent liveliness for a cask, but mid-bodied overall.

Clean finish that is very light considering all that is going on. The rich flavor and mouthfeel and the fullness of the flavors would lead me to expect more of a residual aftertaste.

I for one do not like nitro-tap brews. While the flavor of this beer was spot on, the body was off for me. Yes, it was creamy, but it was definitely missing that carbonation bite that would have really made this beer sing. The nitro basically ruined this for me and made a good beer less drinkable.

Aromas of roast malt and dark bitter chocolate are everywhere with a hint of grassy English hops. Flavor is....well, silky smooth and oh so creamy again with the roast malts and dark bitter chocolate. Hop bitterness and flavor are just enough to balance out the sweetness and creaminess.

Mouthfeel is medium, low mouth carbonation, tendency toward silky. Lactic milky senses to the flavor, and a sense of mildy burnt toast at the end.

After warming, the oatmeal and chocolate aroma became more evident and body became even more silky smooth. Very drinkable and while nothing that is ground breaking, it is a very welcome addition to the Summit lineup. This will be available in the Twin Cities area mid to late summer on draft only, but I would love to see it as part of the normal lineup. Hopefully some will stick around for the fall/winter. If they do eventually bottle, would they do it on CO2 or a nitro widget bottle/can?","truthbrew","0"
