"Overall, this was a nice cap to our tasting night at Toppling Goliath.  It is really kind of unfair that we tasted this on the same night as Zee, Sue, and Tsunami, but it was certainly nice to see the more malty, roasty side they have to offer.  The beer was smooth, flavorful, and easily approachable.  The oats and accompanying malt base was nicely singed at the base, making for that fuller experience.  Otherwise, the brew wasn’t as memorable as their hoppy beers, as we’ve already alluded to.  It does hit the spot if you’re in the mood, however, and the staff is more than happy to blend you up something creative using this beer with any others they have available at the time."

"Very nice/smooth oatmeal stout"

"Rather boilerplate.  Good, but boilerplate.  But seeing as how TG's beers are so reasonably priced, there's nothing wrong with releasing a run of the mill stout."

"Had it on tap once. Drinking from the bottle now. Medium dark body with minimal head. Chocolate oat aroma. Smooth velvety mouthfeel. Lots of cocoa taste with some roasted notes. Yummy."
"O - A tasty oatmeal stout that is on the simplistic side. I could see this used as a base to add in some other flavors, such as coffee or vanilla. Enjoyable for $6."

"Rover Truck is a fun stout with lots of flavors to explore as it warms. It feels like the roasted malts were laid on a little thick and detract from the experience of getting to all the other great flavors, luckily the astringency is very low despite this."

"Notes: Nice oatmeal stout. Doesn't necessarily wow you, but it is very easy to drink. Nice balance between sweet and bitter with a nice chocolate milk kind of finish. Great, creamy body."
