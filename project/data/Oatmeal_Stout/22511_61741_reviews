"Recent growler fill. This might be my favorite oatmeal stout."
"Verdict: A very nice coffee stout from Hill Farmstead, mild and balanced and oh so silky smooth. The coffee profile is really enjoyable, not overpowering but at the same time, not an afterthought, it serves to highlight everything nice about this beer, rather than being one dimensional."

"Overall a very enjoyable stout, pretty easy to drink and flavorful. Wish it was a little more rich and full bodied, but nonethless a good beer."

"Picked this up in a great trade with Evan!  2013 Vintage.  Creamy pitch black pour with a gorgeous two finger caramel-colored head with great retention and crazy lacing.  Big nutty, roasty nose with tons of fresh brewed coffee along with hints of oats, toast, espresso, toffee, burnt sugar, and subtle cocoa.  The taste is also very coffee forward with tons of roasty malt, toasted oats, leather, tobacco, toffee, vanilla, espresso, and cocoa.  The mouthfeel is creamy and mouth-coating with light carbonation, subtle sweetness, and a velvety smooth, dry, bitter finish.  Overall, some of the most intense coffee flavor I've tasted in a coffee stout.  Another great offering from Hill Farmstead."

"Very good, smooth mouthfeel, well integrated flavors. Not necessarily better than other great dark coffee ales."

"The beer is dark brown, near black, with a half inch of beige cap. The aroma brings roast, coffee, oats. Definitely smells true to style. A delicious beer. Oatmeal, chocolate cereal grains. On par with Samuel Smith and Young's (is that sacrilege? - if so, favoring whom?). A solid beer."

""
""
""
"A wonderful oatmeal coffee stout. More than wonderful, incredible."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Earls memory lives on in ale form that's tall, dark and truly handsome. Its a stern demeanor with a reasonable side. Masculine and strong throughout."

"O: Good stuff."
""

"O: Overall, a tasty, well crafted coffee stout. Highly drinkable, though a tad one dimensional."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Coffee runs the show here but the base stout brings some nice elements as well. Great overall coffee complexity."
""
"O-Not a knockout like some other HF beers but Earl is still mighty tasty."
"I would really enjoy having this year round and accessible at the store."
""
""
""
"Pour is black with a tight mocha head. Nose is smooth roasted coffee, hint of burnt toffee, with a light vanilla aroma. Taste is more roasty and burnt than the nose, lots of coffee and gets a hint acrid and bitter. Some chocolate malts cling to the back sides of the mouth with notes of vanilla. Body is incredibly soft and creamy with extremely gentle carbonation. Really opens as it warms bringing out more malt depth and richness balancing well with coffee and helping reduce the bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very flavorful. Very good."
""
"Good, doesn't blow me away though. The astringency in the taste is a noticeable bother at first, but does seem to almost completely fade with time."

"Overall this is an earthy, grainy, bitter chocolate with a coffee presence kind of beer. Not huge on rich chocolate, roast, vanilla, or dark fruit like some can be. You have to enjoy it for what it is and forget about your expectations."
""
"o - Overall a fantastic oatmeal stout; lots of coffee mixing nicely with chocolate and vanilla. Easy to drink, I'd love to have it again. highly recommended if you like coffee and/or oatmeal stouts."
""
"Overall - Amazing beer, this is one of my favorites from Hill. This just proves that HF knows beer from IPA to oatmeal stout. Definitely 100% recommend this beer."

"O: Glad to have brought a bottle home with me. Try it for yourself if you can, but this is the only Oatmeal stout I've ever ben wow'ed by. Fantastic."

""
""
""
""
"O-Getting a couple bottles of this sure beats the 3+ hours I would have waited in line for a growler fill, but my high hopes for this weren't quite met"
"Overall - A little disconnected. Sweet and bitter, both in seemingly disproportionate quantities."

"I was lucky enough to have a friend who was heading up there and willing to bring a growler back for me but unfortunately this beer is only available at their farm in Greensboro Bend, VT. If youâ€™re ever within an hour or two of this place and have the extra time get out there and grab a growler."

"Hill Farmstead just can't help but put up winner after winner. Earl is no different. Not the most complex brew but this beer delivers exactly what it intends to. Like smelling and drinking a mocha latte through and through. The body just serves to enhance the experience. One of the best in the style."
""
"O: This is a pretty good coffee oatmeal stout not my favorite of the variety as WNB is definitely better imo but nonetheless this is a really good beer that I quite enjoyed as with pretty much all hill farmstead if you can get your hands on it do so."
""
""
"O-a well-balanced and flavorful stout, a great sipper to enjoy with dessert"
""
""
"as i stated before it drinks like a porter. its like they took Everett, dumped a whole lot of oats in it. along with a little bit of coffee and theres totally nothing wrong with that! very delicious and smooth! it goes down way too easily!"
""
""
""
"This is a very tasty beer with a great mouthfeel. However, I'm not getting a lot of coffee flavor. It is there, but very subtle. My growler was filled 1 week before being served and was chilled the entire time. I don't think the age of my beer made the coffee fade."
"O- This was a fantastic coffee/oatmeal stout that is exactly what I expected from HF. I could easily drink this for breakfast. It is a little bit on the rich side, but other then that it is very easy to drink. I highly recommend trying this, definitely one of the better oatmeal stouts I've had."
""
""
"Overall quite nice, nice malt bill with creamy oats, little chocolate, caramel, nougat, and even hint of vanilla (not sure how, maybe just perceived from the oats and chocolate and coffee). The coffee is quite strong but not overpowering, nice coffee flavor that really comes through. The bitterness is nice too, a combination of roasted malts, light earthy piney hops, and roasted coffee beans. The only thing keeping this from being a great beer is that light bitter acrid char flavor that gets a little much at times. Otherwise very nice."
""
""
"Overall: This is a coffee lovers stout. Absolutely blows away Breakfast Stout in terms of in your face roasted coffee. Delicious."
"O- again, this is what I look for in a coffee stout. An all out assault on coffee flavors. In my opinion, this is the best coffee stout I have had since wake n bake. I wish I could do a side by side with these two."
""
"O - Overall this was a solid oatmeal stout. Good, but not my favourite (that still goes hands down to Wormtown's Sweet Tats)."
""
""
"O: I think this is solid, but in this rough area of styles (porter / stout being kind of interchangeable today), I'd give the nod to Twilight of the Idols and Everett in HF's stable."
""
"O: very very good, but doesn't fit the style. Absolutely worth the taste, absolutely worth the price, but expect a world class porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Clear, very dark brown color with a light, bubbly tan head. Excellent retention and thick lacing. Earthy and roast coffee aroma, with surprising amount of hops and some faint chocolate notes. Flavor is typical of an oatmeal stout, creamy and smooth, with a silky body, and a strong chocolate and malt body throughout. Minimal bitterness, but strong fresh coffee flavor throughout. Much more robust and enjoyable experience than the BA version of Earl."

"Roasted barley and coffee aromas, luscious malt. The taste confirms and enhances upon the smell. The rich creaminess of the oats is the bed for the roasted flavor to lie upon. Laps of luxury from the glass. Beautiful creamy mouthfeel without any acridness from the roast at all. Terrifically balanced."
"Overall: Another Hill Farmstead brew..another beer right at the top of its class. Exceptional for a coffee stout. While this is not my favorite style, the coffee is not too bitter but it is highly present. If I were to reach for a coffee stout, this is where I would go to."
"This bests FBS as my favorite coffee oatmeal stout. A great offering from hill farmstead! Wish it was available closer to me though..."
"O - Fantastic stout and I'm lucky I got to try this again. Complex, yet exceptionally drinkable. Adds great variety to the HF portfolio."
"O - Not a huge fan of this beer, it's solid, but not an upper-class brew like I've come to expect from Hill Farmstead. Too much char for me, just didn't care a ton for the flavor profile as much as I thought I would."
"O - Enjoyable, but the thin body and hints of coffee hurt the overall score of this one. Wishing for more coffee and medium to full body but I guess I can't have everything. Good, not great."
"D - It's a nice stout, but not as good as Everett. I think I'd like this if there was more coffee presence."
"O- very nice stout. Everything is good and well balanced."
"Thanks again to the Threpenny staff for a great meal, a couple of stellar beers, and some good beer chat. Cheers!"
"Pours a very, very dark brown color with a good off-white head and some really nice lacing on the way down. The nose brings forward some really nice coffee along with some roast and earthy characteristics. A bit of chocolate in the background as well as some hops. The flavor has nice coffee character along with some roast. Chocolate throughout. Mouthfeel is really excellent and the oats come through. No noticeable booze. Really a fantastic stout."
"Earl look black, blackie, its a black ale with a little bit of sugar on top with small spots of lace. up to light, Earl look black. Earl smell roasty and oaty with a deep sweet caramel scent and oats with chocolate rounding it out. Hops are present in the nose, it's a well rounded scent. Earl is one of the richer oat stouts I've had recently. Notes of cocco/chocolate, mounds of oats and even a mild hop bite towards the end. I get a bunch of roasted coffee with some warming, where did that come from? Like I said Earl is well rounded, but he is not fat with soaring alcohol, 7% is fine with me, it drinks like it should be more though, but that's what I like, a lot of taste with not a bunch of alcohol. Feel is a bold medium with adaquate carb. I coulda drank a pint of this if it was not summer and it was not the beginning of my day. I cant quite place this, it hits many styles in one"
"An excellent CDA/stout from the brewer at farmstead hill. While I don't believe Shaun Hill's ability as a brewer quite compares to the genius of Shawn Kelso at Barley Brown, he's awfully damn close. Just an excellent beer from Farmstead Hill."
"This black as midnight stout beer has a strong coffee aroma. A slight tannish head indicates the beers stoutness. Though it is a stout the mouthfeel is not overwhelming thick. It's thick but drinkable. The coffee flavor is more chocolatey than burnt or bitter. Though hints of burnt coffee peak through from time to time. It went very well with my portbello white bean burger at the Farmhouse Tap & Grill in Burlington VT."
"Overall, a really impressive coffee stout and the second beer from Hill Farmstead I've had that I thought was bordering on greatness, if not there already. Definitely thrilled I had a growler of this. Worth the effort to get."
"Growler from Glouglouburp- thanks again Dany! Pours opaque cola with frothy two finger head. Huge delicious coffee nose, slight chocolate, but mostly just unbelievable coffee. Taste- a juicy tart twang from the oatmeal, slight bitterness, and tons of fresh roasted coffee . Fantastic. Drinkability is off the charts. Very light bodied but yet the flavour profile is amazing and the freshness of the coffee really shiines through. HF really nailed this"
"D - Pretty high. I wish more brewery could brew a well balanced stout like this one. I liked it quite a bit but it was just good not great. I would definitely drink it again."
"Drinkability: A very nice take on the stout as I almost saw it as a hybrid stout/rauchbier with the smokiness in this one."
"M/D: Medium bodied with great carbonation. Overall, very nice. I was glad that the coffee wasn't in the forefront. The sweetness from the oatmeal was really nice as was the little bit of hops."
"D - Very nice beer. Smooth and well balanced."
"Chewy full body with a great balance of roasted coffee bean, silky, luscious dark chocolate, oatmeal, toffee and bitter hops. Slight lactic character adds creaminess and fullness to the body and greatly increases the drinkabilitu. I'm actually surprised how well balanced this is. I was expected it to be more acrid and bitter even though the aroma didn't suggest that. Slight citrus and earthy pine hops add complexity. This is a very well crafted, extremely quaffable coffee beer. Not very extreme but damn good."
"Pleasantly reminiscent of Mikkeller Beer Geek or the Olbutikken Porter, this is a staple beer in my fridge the last few months."
"D - Smooth, coffee roastiness - very tasty. Goes down way too easily. This growler disappeared very quickly."
"Overall this is amazing drinkable and delicious. Highly recommended and will seek out more offerings from this brewery."
"Certainly one of the better local examples I've had of this type of beer. Wish I still had a growler full of it."
"a stout with an exceptional nose. Pour is about two fingers. Nose of toasted malt and rose water at first. This fades after the first sip and the true chalk burn coffee grounds comes out. This combines with the hops to leave a dead dry tongue. Beer isn't quite soapy but just a tad smoked acidic."
"D: This is easy to drink, quite tasty. Not sure the ABV of this, but I could certainly enjoy more than one of these in a sitting."
"Another solid HF Brew!"
"Mmmm oatmeal, you make my beer so smoooth. A light pillow of coffee and dark chocolate with some brown sugar sprinkled on top coats the mouth. The body on this one is less than you expect when you see it, a lot less in my opinion. It works well with this beer though, increasing the drinkability, but I would not think this beer would age well."
"Good integration of coffee, but a little light on the body."
"Taste is just like the nose, coffee, chocolate, lotsa brown suga, it's a bit sharp and crisp. Really a good beer with a nice warm and thick mouthfeel. It's got a nice rich mouthfeel that's very tasty."
