This beer was dark...opaque with nice tan head that laced. The smell included roast and espresso. The taste was nice and balanced...others at the table thought bitter....but I didnt think so. Great balance with the roast, coffee, and enough hops to clean the pallet without being to bitter.

4.22,3.7,4,4.5,4,5,4,"Pours a dark black with a very nice brown head and a little bit of lacing. The smell is one of abundant roasted grains combined with bits of coffee and a few nibbles of chocolate. The oats work their way out as well. The taste brings the oats out a little bit more and also includes some mild bittering hops. The mouthfeel is very nice--medium-bodied and quite chewy.

4,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a dark brown, pretty clear, almost black, but lets enough light through that you can see bubbles cascading up through the beer. The head is densely packed, about 1-2cms, brown colored, and it leaves bits of lacing as I drink. Looks nice. The primary smells are coffee and chocolate - a good bit of roasted malts, and not leaning too heavily in any one direction. There's also the sort of standard sweetness mixed with the kind of smell I can hardly describe as anything but the oats. The taste is right on. It tastes kind of slick, nearly syrupy with a tiny bit of esters, but it's nice and sweet. There are hints of coffee, but really it tastes more like roasted, not quite burnt or charred malts, fresh cracked. At times it feels a bit too slick, and the cask doesn't contribute much to the flavor, just the feeling, but it does serve to balance out the flavors a bit in the beer. Especially when you can get a sip of the creamy foam on top. The low carbonation in the beer itself leads to a more full feeling as well, but it also exposes a bit of thinness in the finish. Still this one is right on for an oatmeal stout. The beer is enjoyable, it's nice and smooth, just complex enough to keep me interested, and not too much of a heavy hitter - though a bit higher in ABV than I expected. Overall, and enjoyable beer, and definitely worth a shot on cask.","taylorhamrick","May 13, 2009"

Nose is lots of sweetness, oats, cookies, and then of course a good amount of roasted malt in there as well. Flavor is likewise. A down and dirty beer, if you catch my meaning. Tons of roasted malt, but not in a drying way - lots of sweet cookies and some chocolate in there as well, to help keep it drinkable. Coffee flavors swirling. A solid brew. Feel is nice and full, as it should be, but not so filling you couldn't drink a couple. Overall, a nice beer.","soupyman10","Jan 21, 2008"

The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a low level of fine carbonation. Overall, this is one of the better oatmeal stouts I have had.

4.1,0.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Poured a deep black with a nice head, half inch to a thin film, decent lacing, pretty nice. Aroma is weak, but noticed dark roasted malts, not so much oatmeal hints, and maybe some chocolates, pretty nice but nothing special. The taste is what an oatmeal stout should be, nothing more, nothing less. Mouth is the same. I may be underwhelmed, but this is a very drinkable beer, pretty much perfect with half of their food menu, very much an everyday beer for anyone.","objectivemonkey","Jan 24, 2007"
3.85,-5.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall, a good Oatmeal Stout, and one I would frequent if available to me. Luckily, there are better Oatmeal Stouts within reach. But all in all, I enjoyed a more sweet Oatmeal Stout, if only to remind me what else is out there.","leftmindedrighty","Nov 29, 2006"
3.83,-5.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"The fore is again quite roasty with vanilla, coffee, chocolate, caramel and a hint of ripe dark fruit. The aftertaste is sweeter with less roasted notes and the mouthfeel is creamy with low carbonation and that hefty feel of a good stout despite some thinness to the flavor through the middle. This is a pretty nice brew and Im tickled pink to have a whole growler to enjoy. Had a pint yesterday and it seems even tastier today.","Jredner","Nov 24, 2006"
3.88,-4.7,4,3.5,4,3,4.5,"Originally reviewed on December 2, 2005. On tap at the brewpub. Pitch black, witha cream and coffee head. Deep coffesque and cream aroma with tons of cocoa and roast. Flavor is smoky, seet, creamy and loaded with sugar, molasses and more coffee, yet mellow rounded and fruity, almost like this beer has had a mellow barleywine added to it. Theres a subtle gentle brandy quality, with warming tones and a high level of complexity and depth. Im really enjoying this. A decent run of Tahitian vanilla bean and sweet caramel. Lucious. Damn, Town Hall makes Stouts best.","CharlesDarwin","Aug 18, 2006"

3.55,-12.8,4,4,3,2.5,4.5,"It looks great, smells wonderful--lots of roasted malt. I love stouts and this one didn't disappoint in the flavor, smell, or appearance category...but, I was a little disappointed by the mouthfeel. I think that it should be a little thicker. I like a stout to be stout in every way, with a big mouthfeel, a nice aroma, and a rich taste. I just felt that H2O met two out of the three requirements. I could drink them all night, but it still felt like it was mis-named to me...just a stout, not thick enough to be an oatmeal stout.","ccs","Jun 15, 2006"
4.32,6.1,4,4.5,4,5,4.5,"Where this brew really stands out is the creamy mouthfeel. It's just perfectly smooth--there's no other way to describe it. That smoothness works to perfection with sweetness, but doesn't work quite as well with bitterness.","mynie","Jun 14, 2006"
4.3,5.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I waited a few days before cracking this growler, and I'm sure that a fresh pint would inch things up here. If this were even remotely available to me in the NE where I am or Cali where I'm going this would be a staple.","errantnight","May 28, 2006"
3.65,-10.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Served on tap - nitro (16oz glass, $3.75) at the Town Hall Brewery Minneapolis, Mn. Pours with one finger tan head that goes slowly leaving a good lace. Black color. Light carbonation and full bodied. Hints of coffee and smoky nose. Starts balanced and very smooth, finish has some roasted/burnt coffee flavor. The ABV is 6.0%.","jdhilt","May 15, 2006"

3.98,-2.2,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This beer poured a dark black that let through some burgundy light. Its head looked like creamy hot chocolate and left minimal lacing. Smells like espresso, and lots of chocolate with a slight sourness. Tastes like sour blueberries, black liquorish and coffee. Mouth feel is very smooth and a little on the flat side.","DarkerTheBetter","Nov 18, 2005"

I attribute the carbonation problems to the growler, not the beer itself. I just wish I could have enjoyed this beer in it's full glory. I guess I'll just have to wait until my next trip to Town Hall. I'm anxious to try it again.","hero27","Beers"
3.71,-8.8,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The beer was full bodied with good carbonation. A good taste that is sweeter then most oatmeal stouts. Overall Im not a fan of nitro but I think it gave more of a smoother and creamer taste, but also limits the malty flavor.","Oxymoron","0"
4.45,9.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Black H2O has a very creamy, chocolate head; looks like the beer has cream filling. Jet black. Smells, and I quote myself, "really, really good," of lactose and chocolate, sweet and creamy. Tastes sweet and smooth, like velvet chocolate cake. A little fruity, like raspberries. Thick, luxuriant mouthfeel. Man, an amazingly tasty dessert of a beer.","battlekow","Jul 16, 2005"
4.35,6.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Black in colour with a huge chocolate and espresso aroma. Loads of chocolate, vanilla, and caramel flavors. Perhaps a hint of mint in there too.

3.11,-23.6,4,3,3,3.5,3,"D- This was an O.K. beer but the only real flavor was what I would call an off-flavor. It didn't really have any distinct flavors from the oatmeal no real nuttiness or grainy flavors.","rhoadsrage","Jan 13, 2005"
3.95,-2.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, only a film of a head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Film that did form was quickly gone, we'll give the serving style the fault here, and lacing isn't half bad considering the lack of head. Aroma is a pleasant oatmeal, dark malt essence. Taste is sweet dark chocolate, with a light coffee presence, with plenty of oat heartiness. Mouthfeel could be a bit better with some more carbonation, again probably a presentation problem, and drinkabilty is great. I have to get out to this place and try this and many of their other brews at the source. With a young child, who knows when that may be... If you can, do so.","ppoitras","Aug 28, 2004"
