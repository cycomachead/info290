Aromas of chocolate, roasted malt, oatmeal, cocoa, caramel, light coffee, floral, mint, and herbal earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with solid balance and complexity of roasted notes with a prominent amount of hops. Taste of dark chocolate, roasted malt, oatmeal, toast, caramel, light coffee, floral, mint, and herbal earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, oatmeal, caramel, light coffee, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of roasted malt flavors with light-moderate hop presence; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice oatmeal stout. Well balance with nice flavor robustness and complexity; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 29, 2013"

Being that it is so aromatic and robust, it would be best paired with a hearty smoked steak and a chocolate dessert, both of which will help to bring out each of the individual flavors. In the very end, this is a beer I can most certainly appreciate, but one I most likely won't be drinking unless I have both a nice slab of smoked rib-eye and a fudge brownie with walnuts.","Lucklys","Sep 13, 2010"

The head quickly ebbs, leaving no lace. Nose and flavor are of medium roasted grains, semi-sweet chocolate, earthy hops, and a touch of molasses. This medium bodied stout is a tad chewy from the addition of oatmeal and is adequately carbonated for the style. Worth a try if you are an oatmeal stout fan.","ClockworkOrange","Apr 28, 2009"

3.98,10.9,3.5,3,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours an absolute black with a thin half finger khaki colored head that quickly dies down to a layer of almost nothing. Stickiness is pretty minimal with a tiny bit of spottiness on the sides. Smell is of molasses, toasted oat, and french roast coffee. For some reason I detect some alcohol in the nose too, and for a 5.5% abv I'm not liking it a whole lot. Taste is a smokey espresso flavor with a tiny hint of caramel sweetness. Some toffee flavors emerge on the tongue with a woody taste as well. Aftertaste is a dry vanilla flavor with some oak as well. One of the smokier Oatmeal's I've had for sure. Mouthfeel is light creamy body with a subtle but enjoyable carbonation. I really enjoy how this one feels. After the initial appearance and smell, I fell in love with this beer. My first beer from Nimbus and I look forward to trying more. Good, solid Oatmeal Stout.","BeerTruth","Sep 18, 2007"
3.67,2.2,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Pours a very thick black, but it develops almost no head. This beer resembles more of a dry stout than a full-flavored oatmeal stout. It's not what I set myself for, but it does the job. The overall score suffers because I think it's merely solid for an oatmeal stout.","DoubleJ","Sep 12, 2007"

3.8,5.8,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours black with a respectable tan head that fades to acap and laces moderately. The smell is surprisingly robust and complex, especially given the relatively low abv. Coffee, roasted grains, a touch of vanilla, and oloroso sherry are all present. The taste is significantly lighter, but echoes of the aromas are present. There is also a slight grainy sourness, thin chocolate, and a little roastiness. Mouthfeel is very smooth, slightly creamy, and on the lighter side. Goes down easily, but could be a tad more robust to sustain interest.","Georgiabeer","Apr 30, 2007"
4.2,17,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"This Oatmeal Stout when poured was so dark brown, that, it was on the verge of being black. The smell of roasted malts and hops filled the nose with a pleasant aroma. There was also a hint of simi-sweet chocolate. The taste was of deeply roasted malts, hops and a hint of dark chocolate. While drinking this stout, it had a bitter/tart dryness in the finish. Not a bad finish, just an interesting one, along with the aroma and flavor.","BeerManDan","Apr 26, 2007"

4.03,12.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This beer is dark. There is no light getting through. There is a tan head that quickly tapered off. This beer is thick as well. The smell is very malty. The taste backs this up. There is virtually no hop presence. The mouthfeel is very smooth. No bitterness. The drinkability is good. This beer is heavy and filling. A good beer.","Enola","Jun 18, 2006"
4,11.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Some roasted malt and chocolate, but the aroma is mild thought that isn't a problem with the style. Deep black with thumb thick mocha head. Very bitter and acidic in the fore with ample coffee notes. Middle is a lessened version of the fore taste with a touch of sweetness from the finish which is cream and sugar espresso and chocolate. Tasty and fun to drink.","Jredner","Feb 16, 2006"
4.2,17,4,4,4.5,5,3.5,"Pours a very dark color, almost completely black. Head is brown, dark khaki. Leaves a good lacing, and head retention is nice. Tastes very smooth and light although it is a heavy beer. Little texture, little carbonation. Taste hints of coffee which balances well. Overall this is a very mild beer which is very good if you want to drink something with flavor. I wouldn't suggest this as a session beer, but there's nothing (besides the superior taste) that would keep it from being one.","uabigdaz","Jan 23, 2006"

I've had it a number of times on tap before this, but never quite took the time to really notice how good it is.

They filled it to the brim so not sure how much head would show if it were in a different type of glass. Not very overpowering smell, with toasted coffee aroma. Flavor is somewhat chocolatey and coffee-like, with hints of berries and a mild hoppiness to round it out. Its is very dry, and has a decent bitterness. Mouthfeel is great, nice carbonation, somewhat thick, but very smooth from the oats. Its filling, but very tasty. One of my favorite offerings from Nimbus...","bennetj17","Jul 11, 2004"
3.58,-0.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"The nose is predominantly of dark chocolate. The bidder sweet flavors of this stout are balanced very well.

4.03,12.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This stout poured an opaque brown-black color with sudsy, creamy, light brown foam that settled but clung to the glass. The smell was nice and included aromas of oatmeal, roasted barley, and a hint of coffee together with a touch of sweetness. The taste was foremost dark roasted malt with some burnt overtones and a taste of oats. There was an underlying sweetness with a touch of licorice and a trace of coffee. The hops were hidden by the maltiness, but there was some hoppiness in the finish. The mouthfeel was dry and smooth with medium full body and low carbonation feel. The lingering aftertaste was full or dark roasted flavor and was dry. This was a nice oatmeal stout which held up well in the growler, but someday I would like to have it fresh from a tap for comparison.","UncleJimbo","Mar 30, 2003"
3.88,8.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A pitch black brew that has a tan to brown head atop of it. Smells of roast malt, and it tastes quite smooth with a mellow roast malt finish. A very silky smooth body to this beer. Lots of malt flavors and a bit of acidity in the finish, a good solid beer. There are no super strong flavors (a good thing) and it is very well balanced.","Gueuzedude","Sep 20, 2002"
4.53,26.2,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"What can I say, as I love Stouts, since my first sip of a Guinness at St. James Gate some 25 years ago. Ebony color on the pour, creamy dark chocolate head that is modest in size, the lace a nice glutinous cover upon the glass. Starbucks coffee, bittersweet chocolate, fresh toasted grain, and quite pleasing to the schnozzle is this nose, start is sweet and thickly malt, with the top full and creamy. Finish has a bittersweet chocolate aftertaste, the acidity moderate, the hops purposeful in their spicy bite, and a Terrific representative to the style, and a sure fire favorite for this stout lover.","Gusler","Beers"
