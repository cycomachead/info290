"Lacks that great silky and creamy body I find and look for in this style. From there it cascades downward with a heavy dose of fruits and something that feels like yeast off flavors (reminds me of my early homebrewing days). Very underwhelming compared to the great Stouts out there today."
"Solid oatmeal stout. Worth a go on a fresh tap."

"Little to no carbonation (no head at all), no lacing, mouthfeel very thin.  Taste is not as robust as I would like.  Very muted...thought I had an off bottle so I opened another one...same exact results.  Would not recommend."

"Smoky oatmeal flavor but still pretty great."
"beer looks ok small head and light lace smells of roast malt. coffee and chocolate. taste is slightly bitter and not as smooth as an oatmeal stout should be but still very good and i would buy again."

"a real unique take on the style here. it looks alright, maybe a little thin in body and short on head, not quite as decadent and dreamy as the best ones look, but certainly nothing wrong with it in my wine glass. the nose is what gets interesting. it really smells like fresh canned blueberry jam, true and through, its insane how the dark fruit rises above the roast of the barley and the sweetness of the oats. eyes closed i would think i am smelling blueberry pie or jam, or that stuff they put on your belgian waffle at dennys. flavors i am not used to in a stout for sure, the taste is just like the nose, but i get the stout part too this time. it is indeed a little thin, lacking on the oat richness, but this curious blueberry thing more than makes up for it in terms of the overall enjoyment of the brew. havent had much from browns, so this is a pretty inspiring first impression. more body would make this, its a little too slick as it is, and could dry out just a touch, but a really solid beer, different because of the berry element. i really liked this."
"My favorite Oatmeal stout. Delicious & Local!"

"O- A decent oatmeal stout that I was happy to pick up as it's brew only a few hours away.  I really thought that the nose was great, and if the rest of the beer could rise to that level this would be nearing a must-have. (3.55)"

"Overall pretty good, nothing too special, a bit on the light side as far as malts go for an oatmeal stout, at least what I'm used to, but still pretty decent beer. That being said, Sam Smith is much better from what I remember of an English Oatmeal Stout."

"O - It's an okay stout. Could be a okay substitute to missing out on your old stand-by but it's nothing to call home about. Not what I had hoped for in an oatmeal stout."

"Overall it does dial back with the metallic note after it warms a bit but it's a thin very forgettable stout with mild flavors."

"12oz. bottle courtesy of innuendobrewskiman63 (thanks Jeff). Served in a standard pint glass. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a thin fizzy head that effervesces and dissipates immediately off the pour. Nose is not what I expected - cherry notes dominate, followed by the merest suggestion of dark malts and maybe a hint of brown sugar. Taste - not great, tart cherries, acidic, old coffee grounds, metallic notes - it's pretty bad. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a lively, almost prickly carbonation and some astringency. Well - hopefully this is just a bad bottle, but this is one of the worst beers I've had in a while. Definitely infected if I had to guess. The first beer I've drain-poured in quite a while."

"On Tap at the brewery in Troy, NY. Pours dark brown with long lived off-white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of caramel malt, dark fruit and cacao. Body is full, creamy and smooth. Caramel malt, vanilla, coffee, brown sugar, dark fruit, sherry and hint of hops combine on the palate. Finish is long and semi-dry. Delicious brew."

"I had this beer for the first time on-tap at the brewery (Which is a great place to relax on the patio with a beer and a plate of wings). I immediately fell in love with the beer. I must have had 5 of them before I decided to switch to a lighter pale ale, but quickly switched back to the oatmeal stout after that. Needless to say, I did no end up driving myself home that night. Great beer. A store near my house sells 6-packs of it, and I am a frequent customer."

"O-A nice stout, a tad on the boring side, plus the watery mouthfeel is a let down."

"D: Appears to have quality control issues in the bottling, but to be fair I believe I have an older bottle. I bit this would be better fresher and/or on tap. It is more interesting than the typical macro, but not necessarily more drinkable or enjoyable. Benefit of the doubt on this review."

"not a big fan"
"Overall: Not a bad little oatmeal stout especially for the price. Worth a try for sure"

"This beer has potential, but it doesn't quite meet it. The flavor starts with chocolate and transitions to a roasted oats taste, but I find the transition to be somewhat jarring. Still, the mouthfeel is smooth, making it an enjoyable beer."
"O-Meh. Lacks a little flavor for the style and although it is quite drinkable I have had many oatmeal stouts that are superior. Not terrible, but wouldn't necessarily buy again"
"Picked up a growler while back in the area visiting family. This brewery was my homer spot for 2+ years. The stout pours an extremely dark blackish-brown color with blood ruby highlights and a very thin, light, foamy chocolate milk colored head. Aromas of light roast coffee and cream, with a hint molasses and chocolate. Flavors are rich and smooth on a light body. Coffee and hazelnut character come forward first, with a smooth chocolate and caramel malt backbone to keep the brew on the sweeter side of bitter. The aftertaste is dark chocolate, and a little bitter, with a slick and lingering finish. This is lighter than I like for the style, but very tasty overall."
"O: I love oatmeal stouts and this one was really nice. It's always my go-to at the Tri-City ValleyCats ballgame. Easy to find, priced well, and characteristics are spot on. A must try for a oatmeal stout lover."
"Overall, this is a decent oatmeal stout, pretty midrange."
"Out of all the beers I've had from Brown's, this one takes the cake. Well-done and highly recommended."
"O - on the light end for the style, but good drinkability and enough interest"
"Overall a decent beer. Not much going on with the flavor though, pretty boring. I wouldn't mind drinking it again if I wanted a beer but it's really boring for the style. There are a lot of other stout's I'd like to drink."
"You don't generally find a 5.25 percent ABV stout with as much flavor as this."
"D - Great drinkability. I could drink a sixer of this stout and not feel inflated - I can not say that about a lot of stouts. I really liked this beer but then again it fell in line with a lot of porters that I really enjoyed."
"Spritzy like a soda. There's a light fruitiness. I think this is far closer to a brown ale. The body is thin, particularly for a oatmeal stout. The aftertaste dies nearly immediately. Perhaps the weakest stout I've ever had."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors are really nice, and while there is sweetness, it is well balanced and never feels like too much. The mouthfeel is really fantastic."
"decent, if unspectacular oatmeal stout. If I lived in Troy, it'd be a good everyday ""drink with meal"" beer."
"Drinkability - This beer drinks very nicely. The unique flavors of woody campfire smoke mesh well with the sweetness. Everything is brought together by a great smooth light body. I've had this with some heavily smoked BBQ before and it is sublime. Damn good. One of my two favorite oatmeal stouts alongside Ipswich."
"Drinkability: A nice, sweet, sessionable oatmeal stout. A nice representation of the style."
"Drinkability: this is a tasty stout which I would definitely have again. Not exactly a session beer, as it is a bit sweet, but quite quaffable nonetheless."
"This is my favorite of the style. The silkiness from the oats is really great and there isn't too much in the way of chocolate or coffee flavors to overwhelm that silkiness."
"D - Great drinkability. I love picking up a 6-pack of this for a Friday night, it's a great sessionable stout. I haven't tried all of Brown's brews yet, but it probably isn't a stretch to say this will be my favorite of all their beers."
"This stout was sampled at home in conjunction with Belfast Bat McGovern's Oatmeal Stout. Compared to the latter, Brown's was lacking in a few qualities. Being that I am a huge fan of dark stouts, I did enjoy this beer. However, I found it to be average at best when it comes to Oatmeal stouts. This beer was a bit too fizzy for a stout, lost it's head rather quickly, and had a clear/thin appearance along the edges of the glass. The taste, though with some of that trademark oatmeal taste, was slightly bitter and not as full, rich, or creamy as better Oatmeal stouts often are. I remember enjoying this stout more when I visited the Brown's brewery in Troy, NY and had it out of the tap. I will give this another try, though am not impressed with this bottled effort."
"Presented via growler from fellow BA Slk2go who has been talking about this stout for too long to only be sitting down and enjoying it with him now. Pours a dark brown color with more than a finger of creamy tan head. Lighter brown color comes through the edges. Fair amount of lace clings along the glass and the head displays minor powers of retension. Roasty nose includes scents of coffee, chocolate and citrus hops. Taste is filled with minerals, coffee and fresh sweet grainy flavor. Feel is smooth, light and a bit low on the carbonation. Lingering taste of burnt grain, chocolate and a bit of bitterness that can be attributed to the combination of hops and burnt grain. Quite warming for 5% as I reach the half way point of my first glass. Alcohol is noticeable in warmth but not flavor. Overall not bad."
"A dark black mahogany color with a hefty light brown head and some streaky lacing. The aroma has an astringent hop bite and mild charcoal malt. Tasting it brings grassy lemon hop bite over sweet coffee malt. A bit better than the aroma suggested. It's a bit thin with marginal carbonation. Quite drinkable for sure. Solid offering that could be enjoyed on most any occasion."
"Pours pretty much black with a medium sized dark tan head. Pretty good retention, bubble sizes vary, fair lacing. Smells of chocolate malts, oatmeal, lightly roasty. They're not kidding around on the oatmeal portion. Tastes of chocolate malts, oatmeal, moderately roasty with a dry roasty finish that has a touch of earthy flora. Medium body with a smooth carbonation, some oatmeal thickness but I expected a lot richer mouthfeel after that aroma. Not an amazing brew, but solid oatmeal stout that is very easy and pleasant to enjoy."
"12 ounce brown bottle, pry off cap, no freshness/bottling info to be had. Pours prey darn near black, dark dark khaki head, that stays at about 1/2 inch. Slow fade to 1/4 inch then...eventually...a super thick, good retention..unexciting bits and blobs of lacing. The nose is somewhat off putting, with some dark grains, a cloying sweetness and then a slight licorice note. Dark malts, some caramel and some mild dark chocolate, but this one is kinda thin, lacking in complexity and with a short finish that exposes the limited depth of flavors. Eh, not my favorite of the the Brown's brews I've had the past few days. The label says ""Dependable ales", but really what I found was middle of the road micros..worth a ty but nothing special going on.."
"This is a delicious tasty stout that is quite sessionable."
"Aroma is thin with some roasiness. Flavor is smooth and roasty with some coffee flavors. Carbonation is high and mothfeel is dry. Overall it's easy drinking."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" tan head over the barely translucent root beer brown brew. Head lasts well, with slow sheeting lace. Aroma is roasty and dark sweetness. Taste starts where the nose left us, dark and sweet, oatmeal depth in the middle, and a slight tart fruitiness to close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is pretty good. Wish the tartness had stayed away, this one was headed to an even better place."
"Overall a good oatmeal stout. Nothing that will knock your socks off but servicable."
"The flavor rescues my short-lived disappointment with the mouthfeel with an interesting balance of sweet, chocolate malts, and neutral hops. Overall this is quite mild. Not bad in the long run."
"Overall, a pretty good example of the style. The only thing I really don't like here is the carbonation level being so high. Other than that it is pretty good."
"This ranks right around the top of the oatmeal stout category for me. It has the whole package - great looking in the glass, killer aroma, and full, delicious flavor. Hopefully they continue to brew and distribute lots of this!"
"This beer poured a dark brown with a two-finger tan head. The smell is heavy on oats with some chocolate. The taste is mostly roasted malt with a tiny bit of coffee and chocolate flavors in the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly thick with a fairly small amount of carbonation. This is a tasty little oatmeal porter that is enjoyable if a little one-dimensional."

"D: The stout is decent, a smooth oatmeal stout that won't wow you but will keep you happy."
"Notes: Adam gave this to me a while ago, and it's sat dormant in my fridge for ages. I saw it today and was just in the mood... to be frank, it could be slightly better in looks and mouthfeel, but it's worthy of a bit more than the credit it gets."
"Pours a mostly black color with a medium lived light tan head. Smell is smooth lightly roasted malt and creaminess. Taste is lightly roasty with a metallic and dry finish. Medium to light bodied but a bit of a watery flavor. Kind of a dull flavor and a touch tart, almost as if this isn't very fresh. No idea of bottles age, however."
"M + D: A little on the thin side... I tend to love the rich and creamy feel in oatmeal stouts and this one falls a bit short there. It still manages to have a reasonable feel, though, so not too much love lost. At a modest 5%, it could be a session candidate. Dunno if I'd go about having it that way, but I'd certainly give it another shot. Not too bad at all."
"D - overall an okay oatmeal stout that I was happy to try but would not try to seek out too much. I do really like the caramel corn smell as it is one of my favorite foods but it is really not to prominent and overall the taste on the beer is average as it does not blow me away nor make me want to run away."
"Drinkability- Overall this definitely isnt the greatest beer Ive ever had but all-in-all its not bad. If I wouldnt have known what this beer was (Oatmeal Stout) I would have guessed that it was a Porter. Definitely to thin for the style but tasty none-the-less. Big thanks again to drseamus for the opportunity!"
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin and slightly over carbonated. Couldnt drink too much of this one. Not completely bad, the flavor is ok but drinkability suffers because the aroma is too sweet to overcome."
"I was pleasantly surprised to see that Brows has started bottling their beers in 12 oz. Bottles. I picked up a mix of the three that they are currently offering which is the Oatmeal Stout, Pale Ale and IPA. Bottle presentation is very classy, nice looking label. Notes on it say Smooth, silky and rich. Brown's Oatmeal Stout was declared the worlds finest example of th style by the Brewers Association  taking home a Gold Medal at the World Beer Cup in 2004. We handcraft every batch using two-row pale, black caramel and chocolate malts. Willamette hops and a heapin' helping of flaked rolled oats. I have had thee before on tap while visiting the brewery but had only reviewed the Oat before. The oat from the bottle poured to a pitch black color with a think two finger medium colored head that has very good retention and has left chunks of lacing down the side of the glass. The aromas are rich with roasted malts that also give off tastes of chocolate and caramel. The flavor has a little odd tail end to it but not in a bad way, very enjoyable, The feel is very smooth and creamy. For a local brew, this is very good, will be a staple during the winter months."
"Pours an absolute black with a weak one finger frothy head that quickly dies down to a thin layer of almost nothing. Stickiness is pretty weak, hardly anything holding on what so ever. Smell is pretty weak, you really have to put your nose down in there to get much of anything. Some sweet toasted oat, light caramel malt, and some brown sugar. Watered down roasted barley with some french roast coffee and milk chocolate on the tongue. Aftertaste is a charred oak with a tiny bit of molasses. Mouthfeel is pretty light and watery with a mild carbonation. I was pretty let down by this brew, lacking a lot in terms of flavor. I'll have to try this on tap and see how it compares. Next on the list from Brown's, their IPA."
"Very nice oatmeal stout. The beer pours a really nice black color with a nice tan colored head. The smell is of a really malty aroma with hints of a nice sweet aroma. The taste is really good, very subtle and not overpowering. Hints of a subtle hops don't overpower the oatmeal and malts. The aftertaste is really clean with hints of a chocoalte taste. The carbonation is perfect and this is a very drinkable beer, If you are in the Troy, NY area, you have to try this beer. Really Really Excellent. Stouts are my favorite beers and this is definately in the top 10."
"On tap at the Man of Kent,poured from the tap an ink black with a very thin almost fizzy almond colored head that was gone very quickly.Highly roasted in the nose and quite dry nearly burnt,very thin boarderline watery mouthfeel led to lesser flavor in my mind it was pretty roasted with a hint of coffee.Not to impressed with this it just lacked alot of depth flavor and mouthfeel wise in my opinion."
"Zero on the carbonation, it's much like a flat watered-down cola. Slightly tangy, tons of carmel, sticky sweet. Isovaleric, phenolic, and some mercaptan (off-putting defects). Maybe too much roasted barley made it too thick? Undrinkable. Has a sweet roasted porter-type flavor. I don't think this was a very old bottle, and I also think they need to be alot more thorough with the sanitation around the brewery. Hope this helps."
"Had this on tap at Brown's. It pours nice and dark with a small off-white head. There is a good roasted aroma with a bit of sweetness. The taste is really good. It has the classic oatmeal smoothness and a good amount of sweetness and roasted malt too. The slight disappointment is in the mouthfeel. It is a bit thinner than i would like. The drinkability is high though."
"Had this on tap at Brown's last night. Poured a nice black, with a brown head that settled down to a nice lacing. The smell was nice and roasty, with a hint of coffee. Taste was of toasted oats up front, with a bit of typical roasted coffee in addition. Mouthfeel was surprisingly light, a little thinner than I usually like. Overall, a very good and drinkable beer."
"D: Light enough to enjoy on a hot day, yet full enough to notice its craftsmanship."
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet crystal and chocolate malt scent with some roasted notes and a dry oatmeal aroma. The taste is decent. It has an extremely dry flavor that boasts of roasted, crystal, and chocolate malts along with lots of oats. It has a dry, earthy finish. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good brew. It is so damn dry, I'm not sure I could drink more than one."
"A pretty middle of the road Oatmeal Stout. The nutty character is what makes this one unique for the style. Drinkable but nothing special."
