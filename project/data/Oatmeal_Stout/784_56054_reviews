"Pretty average. Bitter unsweetened chocolate. Dry finish with not much bite or thickness."

"O: Man is this ever easy drinking (6.5%, 37 IBU). Definitely an easy lifter and sessionable. I really like the fullness and the straightforwardness of it. Not a lot of complexity. It reminds me of my childhood days when I poured Hersheys on my bland oatmeal."

"Overall: a very sweet and rich stout. a little two rich for my blood. I do like sweeter beers but they are usually stronger than this. perhaps of roasty malts would balance this out nicely."

"Overall this beer did little to impress me. This beer could have been so much more."

"O) Pretty good.... I could see how this would do well with some barrel aging. Too bad I didn't score a bottle."

"would definitely get again"

"Overall, this is a decent oatmeal stout that tends too strongly to the bitter side for me to truly enjoy it as well as I'd like."
""
""
""
""

"O- The wonderful dry stout has a nice complex roasted profile that is balanced by very nice coffee and chocolate flavors aswell. This is a big beer but it is very easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's a good beer from a good brewer and I'm happy to report I've got five more where this bottle came from. It's got some bitterness to it, but it's so smooth it's easy to sip."
"O-A nice stout but lacking anything to put it over the top."
"Tyranena Down 'N Dirty Chocolate Oatmeal Stout ---3/5."
""
"O: An interesting pairing of American and English beermaking, this oatmeal stout will not leave anyone fan of dark beer disappointed. That said, it probably won’t excite anyone too greatly. The great thing for Tyranena, though, is that their middle-of-the-road beers are better than a lot of beers in the same price range: case in point, Down 'N Dirty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice oatmeal stout. Really enjoyed the dark malt flavours. The smooth mouthfeel is probably the best part of the beer, followed by the smoky aroma. It could use a little bit more in the flavour department but I won't mind buying a sixer of this the next time I feel like an oatmeal stout, especially as its a good value. (4)"

"O: this is a model example of an oatmeal stout. From its body to its complex flavors it comes through in all the right areas. It's a fantastic beer to sip on and would make a perfect brew to have with breakfast or to close out your night."

"D - Tasty, well balanced oatmeal stout."
""
"Poured out a dark brown color with a fairly stable single finger of tan colored head but only minimal lacing. Smells of roasted malt tones blended with milk chocolate and a splash of coffee, tastes more of the milk chocolate than the roastedness from the nose, sadly. Seems overall to be balanced somewhat too sweet for my personal preferences, but YMMV. I just prefer my stouts a little bit less sugary and caramelized than this. Smooth texture and lighter carbonation over a medium-heavy body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied and medium carbonated, with added smoothness and creaminess from the oatmeal. A good chocolate-forward example of the style. Highly drinkable."

"Cost: $2 for a 12 oz bottle."

"Very good brau. Served at a good temperature with a nice sized light tan, foamy head that settled after a bit and good lacing. Color is an opaque black brown. Aroma is malt, heavy roast, coffee. Flavor is similar to nose with nice balance between malt sweet, malt roast, carbonic tang, and malt, hop, yeast bitter. Body is good, ditto carbonation with only little points, yet compensating chewyness. Finish is like flavor, of average length, and very easy to have more. A tip of the hat to the brewer."
"This is a medium bodied brew that is silky smooth in the feel. It is rich and quite enjoyable. The alcohol is very well incorporated here. The most excellent aspect of this brew is the fresh grainy chocolate quality captured in the aroma, I really would have liked to seen that transcended into the flavor a bit more. As-is its a nice experience and worth a try."
"Very good.  On tap at Cardinal Bar, Madison. Quite pleasurable. I'm totally impressed with this, even after two years since I first tried it."
"O: Impressive chocolate-oatmeal stout, full flavored with a good strong nose as well. Its even a bit grimey and 'dirty' with its earthy coffee ground and oatmeal notes. Good stout, recommended."
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown with a two and a half finger beige head. An aroma of chocolate and roasted malt rises from the glass. Some sweetness and chocolate greets the tastebuds and quickly shifts to slightly sweet roasted malt finally finishing with a return to chocolate with roasty bitterness. Fairly creamy and smooth, medium-bodied, dead on for the style. A solid, easy drinking oatmeal stout that delivers."
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good representation of the chocolate oatmeal stout genre of beer. It's highest qualities are the mouthfeel and the smell."
"O- A winner! A brewery I was afraid to try for fear of a let down but this is very impressive!"
""
"This is far from my favorite Tyranena brew, but it is still very drinkable."
"M: chocolate, dry, well-made"
""
""
""
"Bitter chocolate and coffee can sometimes work well together but there's somewhat of a clash going on here. A tad harsh for the style. Not sure if age is playing a factor here but I'd like a shift away from the dark/bitter roasty malts towards some sweetness to help increase session enjoyment."
"Pours a dark brown, looks heavy. Nice tan colored thick foam which is short lived. Nice film with a ring last throughout the drink. Smell is a sweet caramel and chocolate. Taste is malt and chocolate with a little oatmeal maybe. Not too intense. Mouthfeel is almost creamy with moderate carbonation. Overall a good beer. Well balanced and easy drinking."
""

"O- Great beer. Excellent with chocolate cake."

"Tyranena is a brewery that I want to pull for. I’m wondering if the continual assistant brewer turnover there is hindering what this brewery is capable of. Where are the distant BGW gems that this brewery used to put out? Where is the unrealized potential? Kinda tired of the mediocre beers Tyranena seems to be putting out as of late."
" I really enjoyed this beer, It smells and tastes great!"
"I was really excited for this beer. Poured very dark dark brown, with a short just off white head. Some light gets through around the edges. There is a bit of spotty lacing, but it is very sparse. The first thing I thought when I smelled this beer was roasty. This is very very roasty with a bit of chocolate and not much else. It is pleasant, but on the way to being too roasty. The flavor, however, is too roasty. It tastes like a ton of burnt malt was in this one. It overwhelms everything else, sort of tastes like eating a handful of patent malt. Not horrible, but very overly roasty, and burnt. Mouthfeel does not give you the creamy smooth texture that I like, and it is a bit light, but it is ok. This beer is really nice, but could definitely be improved upon."

"Down N' Dirty is a flavorful oatmeal stout with a complex taste profile that moves far beyond its chocolate essence. Cheers!"

"Very solid beer. The mouthfeel is sublime and I love the strong chocolate presence."

"D/O- Pretty solid oatmeal stout with just enough chocolate to set it apart. Highly drinkable. Recommended to oatmeal stout fans."
""
""
"overall: another great brew by a great brewery. i found this 6 pack last week on the shelves, so it must have gotten lost in the back of the liquor store cause this beer is released in march i believe. still tastes great, so it has aged well so far id say."
""
"A good oatmeal stout; the chocolate adds more to the smell than to the flavor. Taste strikes me as a little unbalanced, and the mouthfeel is thin and flat, turning what could be a very good beer into one that's enjoyable, but not super impressive. Hard to choose this when there's Founders Breakfast Stout around (granted that's a bigger beer, but it's everything this is and so much more)."
"Mouthfeel: This beer feels rather watery for a porter not a bad brew just not as good as I was expecting out of this brewery."
"O- Solid. Nothing to wrtie home about, but a great beer to just sit down and enjoy"
"Overall: Just ok. Would have liked more body. The taste was a bit too bitter, needs more balance."
"o - Overall a really nice oatmeal stout that is very easy to drink. Lots of coffe up front in the taste, and a great mouthfeel. Would have again."
"O: I love this beer and I'd have it again if I had the chance. Stacks up well against any oatmeal stout I've had."
"O- Not as good as I was hoping for, but better than the nose led me to think it was gonna be. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to have this again, but I'm glad I did."
"Trying the Tyranena Down & Dirty Oatmeal Stout after a very cool June day here in the Chicagoland area. The appearance is typical of a good stout...rich deep dark color with thin/no-existen ecru head. The smell has a roastness to it with a slight blend of hersey's chocolate kiss. The taste is really good. I like this stout. It has a nice full body that is not over powered by ABV. The roast with chocolate undertones really balance nicely. I could session this during any winter night. On a hot day it might be tough."
"bottle sample- quite dark milk chocolate colour with decent clarity. Had to pour vigoursly to get much head, which disappeared quickly. Nose faint roast and powdered chocolate. Taste- lactic quality from the oatmeal, followed by a more powdered chocolate and roast. Not overly sweet- balanced out with hop/roast bitterness. Nice mouthfeel- as it coats the mouth is a pleasant fashion. Decent, if not unspectacular."
"O- This beer was a delight to drink. It was very smooth and left you wanting more after each sip. I really liked the balance of the extra chocolate and coffee overload. I will be looking for this beer again and again on the shelves."
"Solid beer at a solid price. Would recommend to fans of the style and noobs alike."
"I was really excited to try this brew...mostly because of the name. In my opinion, if you're going to call your brew Down n Dirty Oatmeal Chocolate Stout, you'd better bring your A game because you're going to have to throw down with Founders, Rouge, Southern Tier, etc. which make incredible chocolate stouts. Down n Dirty was good and quite drinkable, but is not in the same league as the others. Nose was pretty faint. Body was a little thin IMO. The roasty malts, light coco, mild earthy and oats are good but not enough to grease my train wheels."
"Deep dark brown pour with a nice inch of tan head on top. Slow fade left behind a minmal head but some decent side glass lacing. The aroma was rich with roasted malts, hints of molasses and burnt caramel and a touch of a smoke like note as well. Even feel here with a lighter side of dull but still nice feel on it. The flavor came through nicely balanced with a rich profile that was not over the top and a mellow finish that really hit the spot"
"O- A fine brew. Since I tried this last year it has been one of my favorite oatmeal stouts. I just wish it was year-round, that and Tyranena got more out to my area!"
"O: A great stout to drinks regularly, I would buy this whenever i just wanted a good stout to drink for a reasonable price and easy to get."
"O: This does end up being a nice, session beer; decent beer from Tyranena"
"Flavor is smooth, with chocolate-coffee tones and a slight bitterness in the finish. Very tasty and worth doing again. I will drink these happily and perhaps pick up more again."
"Pours a pitch black, with a small tan head that diminishes rather quickly. The lacing though on this beer is amazing. There is a constant lace ring around the beer the whole time. Smells of roasted barley, oatmeal, chocolate, bread, and smoke. The smell isn't anything to write home about, but works. The taste is phenomenal. Strong hints of roasted barley, sweet chocolate, and oatmeal. Mouthful is pretty thin and there isn't much carbonation there. Overall I love this beer. There are a few characteristics that don't make this beer world-class, but the taste makes up for those and puts this into an elite category of good beers. I will definitely have this on my radar to grab in the future."
"O: A nice beer for an oatmeal stout. A clone of Lost Coast comes to mind. But...points are lost as the ""chocolate"" is more hyped than delivered. At this price point....I'll be willing to pay more....for more."
"This beer pours a nearly opaque black color. The head is one inch of light tan foam that recedes slowly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of roasted malt, dark and milk chocolate, cocoa powder, graham cracker, and a hint of vanilla. There is a lot going on in this beers aroma. The taste is just as chocolaty as the aroma. Milk chocolate comes through during the sip with lingering dark chocolate in the finish. There is also nice backing roasted malt and graham cracker. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate, fine carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a very good stout that I will surely drink again."
"I enjoyed the beefed-up version of this (BGW series, baby!), so I had to try the usual one. It pours a matte onyx topped by a finger of sandstone foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, light coffee, dark chocolate powder, chocolate syrup, light molasses, and a touch of smoke in the background. The taste darkens things decidedly, including deepening the roast, lightly acidifying the coffee, further darkening the chocolate, and slightly amping up the smoke character. The body is a light-feeling medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a fairly smooth feel. Overall, though it felt a bit on the light side for my tastes, this was a pretty solid stout."
"Finish: Smokey malts with subtle hop notes in the back"
"mouthed....brownies and barleywine..heavy sugared coffee beans....that sticks with you....uplifting at 6.3%...rather then a kbs that lulls you into gentle sleep....not much depth to this but rather varying flavors floating about on their own...."
"Body is on the thin side for style but doesn't detract too much. Carbonation is good, with a fairly slick mouthfeel. Finish is a little sweet. Flavor doesn't last too long on the palate. A good beer no doubt, not sure I'd advertise the chocolate part. Maybe just call it an oatmeal stout and let the drinker discover the chocolate."
"I am seldom let down by a Tyranena beer. I certainly was not let down by this one. Not quite a dessert beer."
"I never thought I'd see this one, let alone get to try it. Tyranena has been in Indiana for awhile but this was the first time I saw this one. I love the BGW version so this was a must try. It poured a velvety smooth black with no head, just khaki bubbles that laced the glass. The aromas aren't as bold as I imagined. The coffee is actually really light and kind of subtle. The featured aroma is really bitter chocolate. It has some light funk to it. The flavor is both sweet and bitter chocolates with a light coffee roast. It's drinkable and not too sweet. It's a good beer but it really makes me want a Doubly Down 'N Even Dirtier. This beer put the sequel in proper perspective. I'm glad I got to try this one."
"Overall: A decent oatmeal stout. Not the best in the style and certainly doesn't hold a candle to Founder's, but this is a nice little American stout."
"A good example, though a bit light on the aroma, taste and mouthfeel categories for myself."
"drinkability is good - this is a solid oaty stout and a fine substitute for FBS"
"Tyranena's Down 'N Dirty Chocolate Oatmeal Stout is a wonderful stout. It pours with little head (like most stouts I guess), and has a rich black color.The smell and taste are great. It has a coffee type bitterness, which is quite yummy. Don't taste much chocolate though. The mouth feel is typical for a stout. It is very rich, and has a complexity that is very nice. I think Tyranena is a good brewery! Haven't had anything form them that wasn't pretty good! Very toasty roast flavor. Will definitely get this one again."
"This is above average but nothing special. Didn't expect much form Tyranena so it actually exceeded by expectations."
"This was a weird beer experience. The first half of the bottle I drank had low carbonation, which made the beer seem flat, made the roast a bit over harsh, and made the body feel thin and watery. The second pour out of the bottle was moderately carbonated, and all of the other elements of the beer swung into balance. I think the beer doesn't hold its carbonation particularly well, but right out of the bottle its pretty damn good."
"D- Glad I tried it, but doubt I'd seek it out again. Way better options in the realm of American Stouts from the region"
"SkÅL!"
"D: Very nice oatmeal stout, delicious Tyranena brew. One of my favorite breweries and this is rather tasty beer. I could have more than a few. Great for the Winter months of The Great Lakes near the fireplace after dinner."
"Drinkability: It is a great stout that drinks well. This is a great stout coming from Wisconsin! Cheers!"
"D-A very tasty oatmeal stout."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"A black as ink stout with no highlights, well maybe one ...yeah black. Has a nice light brown head and a little bit of lace. Notes of chocolate and coffee jump from the glass as you pour the beer in. Hints of molasses in the background tempt you even further. Deep roasted malt notes dominate the flavor with hints of bittersweet chocolate and black coffee in the background. Silky smooth on the tongue with a good roasted malt bitterness on the finish. This is a good one."
"Overall a really complex, fantastic stout, one I'd be happy coming back to over and over. Glad I have five more."
"Flavor was not all that chocolaty as the name would suggest, but easily one of the better oatmeal stouts I've had in a while."
"Notes: A wonderful oatmeal stout. A touch on the sweet side, but it works well. A very nice beer with plenty of chocolate flavor. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall: I don't exactly know what to think about this brew. I certainly like it and will probably drink it again but I don't think that i will reach fro it when I am looking for an Chocolate Oatmeal Stout."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being below average. Drinkability is good, it had some great flavors to it and everything came together very nicely. The chocolate was nicely done and was pretty well balanced out with the bitterness. The oats brought everything together and added a very nice smoothness to it. A very flavorful beer overall and a very good choice to sip on after dinner this evening."
"A good oatmeal stout. I can't say it's the best but definitely enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, pretty smooth and silky from the oats. A bit plain but a nice stout. Thanks Russ!"
"drinkability is good. well balanced. good depth. nice chocolate character."
"Roasty, and bitter, yet still very smooth, this was definitely a Chocolate Oatmeal Stout to savor and enjoy. I haven't had a bad dark beer from these guys yet. Really nice offering here from Tyranena."
"Drinks really well for being so roasty. I'm a huge sucker for huge roast if it's pulled off correctly, and this is a great example. A lot of beers with such a roasty profile get really astringent, but not this beer. It seems like the cocoa nibs help balance things out a little bit to counter the roast, but ultimately it's pretty lopsided on the roasty side, and I love that. If there was a little more dark caramel flavor in the mid-range, I could easily see this contending for one of the best stouts of any kind I've ever had. Tyranena delivers some REALLY terrific dark beers."
"This is a very nice oatmeal stout. Perfectly sweet and bitter, yet messy in that the flavor and aromas are all over the place. Great for an oatmeal stout. Goes great with chocolate or dark fruit like cherries."
"F: FInishes slightly dry with a little hint of lingering sticky sweetness. Even more bitterness this time, again mostly from the earthy charred roasty malts, but a little spicy hop flavor as well this time. Lots of lingering creamy milk or lactose flavors, with oatmeal on the side. The chocolate, roast, and coffee all blend together at the end and come through in the center of the finish but not as prevalent as the initial taste, although the coffee does seem to start to come out a bit more. A little cocoa nibs too on the finish. It drinks pretty well, but the bitterness edges it a little too much."
"All in all, this brew was a let down. Not worth hunting and definitely not a top line stout. I am so tempted to pull a BCS from the fridge to make up for this one. We'll see..."
"Drinkability is good, this is a tasty stout. Could use a little more body, but other than that, this is a winner."
"D: This was a nice surprise. Wasnt expecting too much, but I enjoyed this beer. Very drinkable. Glad I picked up this Wisconsin brew"
"D: good but not great, can't quite put my finger on it. would have liked a bit more chocolate presence given the addition of actual chocolate."
"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy tan head, which leaves some nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, with a nice touch of chocolate/toffee. The taste is sweet, malty, chocolate/toffee notes galour. Medium body, a nice smooth brew, with a slight bitter finish. Drinkable, another very tasty brew from Tyranena."
"M/D: Fuller body, fine carbonation bubbles makes for a creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is a little on the high side for this style. Very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel was medium in body, even toward the light side. Smooth with a zippy finish."
"Overall, based off the name I was excited for this beer. But it really didn't pack the flavors that I was expecting. Being let down is an understatement. Not going to be drinking a lot of this."
"D: Just ok, this Tyranena offering lacks degree of complexity, which is a shame since it definitely has the body to pull it off. Characteristic oatmeal stout flavor dominates everything else leaving little to be enjoyed. I'd give this another go but this isn't really one of Tyranena's winners."
"Overall this was another really nice beer from Tyranena Brewing. Thanks again, Kevin! Recommended."
"I finially found the variety pack. Tyranena variety packs have been hard to find since they hit Indiana shelves. Pours a very dark brown nearly black with a short dark tan head. Smells like roasted malts and chocolate. The coffee stands out the most in the taste to me. A nice medium body. The oatmeal gives it a very smooth and creamy feel. Not too heavy at all. I could have another. The drinkability of this makes it a beer for nearly any occasion."
"Highly recommended if you like chocolate or coffee style stouts."
"Roasted and chocolate malt are immediately apparent on the palate. As the nose suggests, it's quite grainy and malty, pleasantly so, with wholesome bread and biscuit flavors along with more subtle tones of vanilla and black licorice. It's full-bodied, quite rich and flavorful for the relatively modest ABV. Go figure, another great Tyranena beer."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is super smooth!... The carbonation is low and works really well with the beers character. This is a super nice Oatmeal Stout. I would buy this beer often if it was in the Cincinnati market."
"(D)- Not a bad stout. Definitely alot of oatmeal in this. Definitely denser than I was expecting, but I always like surprises. Gets more bitter as you drink it. Not your average oatmeal stout for sure."
"overall - very drinkable beer. sweetness is balanced by the bitterness. good everyday beer."
"tasty for sure but not what i have come to expect from Tyranena."
"overall a really good stout full of chocolate flavour with a nice head that stays and lacings up and down the glass"
"I bought this to give out as extras since it is local but decided to crack to see how it was and I was very surprised! Very good!"
"Overall, this is a good beer with each component having its strength but no one single outstanding part either. Definitely enjoyable and I could easily enjoy a couple in an evening."
"D-I've enjoyed drinking this. It is a unique take on this style. Well done."
"D - The mouthfeel makes this beer. Without it, it would be rather bland. The cocoa and additional flavors just seem to be a bit thin to me. It's not bad at all though. A good drinking Oatmeal."
"The pour is clear yet opaque in the glass with better than a full finger foamy tan head that fades slowly leaving a good amount of Belgian lacing behind each mouthful. The nose is dominated by that semisweet NECCO malt chocolate grainy oatmeal. The mouth feel is well carbonated, medium full body that adds a smooth texture to compliment the oatmeal and roasted malt flavors that clean up pretty quickly. At 6.3% ABV this one is a nice drinker. Enjoyed considering it; many thanks Pops!"
"Deep malty nose gives way to a rich, roasty flavor with more than a hint of chocolate and silkiness of oatmeal. Deep subtle chocolate makes this parable with dessert, and the finish is nicely balanced, not sweet at all. Superb. Light yet heavy mouthfeel, silky and smooth. I am loving this as an alternative to those 12oz stouts that I feel I must share because of the abv power. This one I could have a few of my own. Well done."
"Tastes pretty much the same as it smells. Rough oatmeal, smooth chocolate. Medium sour and medium sweet. Very nice and rich."
"Well, good beer, but I'm a bit confused by it. The flavors don't come together all that well, & the advertised chocolate is a bit weak. They've made so many excellent beers I always expect the most out of Tyranena, but this one falls short of previous standards they've erected."
"D- Easy to drink and I could definitely kick back a few. I will purchase it again when I am looking for a lighter stout."
"Poured a very dark brown with a decent-sized tan head. The nose has some nice portions to it, with chocolate and a bit of sweetness; however, the roasted character of the malt kind of outshadows everything else, making this fairly one-dimensional. The taste is quite similar, with a bit of hop bitterness added. Mouthfeel is medium with adequate carbonation. Drinkability is okay, definitely affected by the sometimes-harsh character of the beer. Not the best I've had from Tyranena, but one I was certainly glad to try. Thanks again, Barry."
"Drinkability - Tyranena is perhaps Wisconsin's best brewer. This might be their best beer. Not quaffable, but a few of these should make the night go better."
"I could see this one going into my regular rotation if it was available locally. Very drinkable."
"D: It was only a few months ago that I had just found out about this brewery, and now, I can't get enough of their beers. Another solid offering!"
"Nice flavors, easy drinking. ABV sneaks up on you."
"A very solid beer that has just thrusted Tyranena near the top of my favorite brewers list. Am now on a mission to find other selections from them."
"edited once i was shown where the bottled on information was."
"D. This is a great offering. I'm a big fan of Tyranena, and this is probably my new favorite by them, and may be my favorite oatmeal stout."
"On tap at Stubs. Pours a nearly black, dark brown color with a small off-white head, no lacing. Average aroma, nothing really sticks out here. Some light chocolate is buried deep in there somewhere underneath the light sweetness. Taste is great. Smooth, silky chocolate, light graham cracker, toasty, dry finish. The oats really add an excellent silkiniess to this brew, and it's incredibly easy to drink. Soft, yet has a nice hop bitterness on the backside. Good oatmeal stout."
"Roasty with a hint of cocoa and bitterness. Lingering mild ashy aftertaste. Seems pretty clean and easy drinking, I have no issue with the carbonation. Fairly smooth due to the oatmeal content i'm guessing. Not too filling, but a substantial brew that's big on flavor. Nice job Tyranena..."
"Overall, a solid stout coming from Tryanena, whom I've come to expect great things from. Glad I got a chance to try this on tap, as I will definitely be revisiting this in bottles."
"Overall, a fantastic beer, I'd highly recommend it. First one I've had from Tyranena, which seems to be a relatively new brewery, but I'll eagerly look for from them in the future."
"Minor carbonation gripe aside, this is an all-around very impressive stout."
"Another solid offering from Tyranena, and an excellent value at $10/sixer."
"This black bodied beer has a thick crop of rocky brown froth on top that leaves behind enormous amounts of lace. Good dose of chocolate, oatmeal and roasted barley aromas on the nose. And some liquid caramel for good measure. Not quite as big as some of their other experimental porters and stouts, but nice nonetheless. As it should be, this oatmeal stout is silky smooth and velvety. Medium bodied or so. Nice bitter roasted malt/barley flavor. Bittersweet chocolate character is fairly low. Burnt malts and a little oily smokiness come into the picture as well. As expected, well done. Good depth and complexity."
"D: Excellent stout! How cool would it be for Tyranena to throw a batch of this in some Bourbon barrels...just to see what would happen?"
"Overall a very good beer. Easy drinker for sure. I will have no trouble finishing the rest of the bottles I bought."
"D. This is an impressive offering from Tyranena. It is well made and really easy to drink. A nice change from so many ""big"" stouts that hit the market this time of year. Having 3 or 4 of these beers in a night would not be a chore. Worth seeking out - recommended."
"D: yet another winner from Tyranena. They really have some impressive beers and this is no exception. I look forward to any stout or porter they may come out with"
"A very solid brew and drinkably solid too. Tyranena does not disappoint with this new addition to their line up."
"Very drinkable and goes down quickly. I would have to guess this is around 6% alcohol which is more than your typical OS. Really great representation of style here with a unique touch of bigger body and chocolate. Highly recommend."
"Great example of the style. I would guess that the abv is in the 4 to 5% range."
