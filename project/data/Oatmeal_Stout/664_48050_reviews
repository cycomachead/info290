"I am extremely fond of desserts and have a major sweet tooth, which is why this beer fascinated me from the very beginning. The aroma is surely chocolate and coffee, sounds delicious! The flavours are also pretty sweet, chocolatey and a bit of licorice. I am looking forward to using this when I whip up my next chocolate based dessert!"

"Poured from bottle (no date) into english pint. Pours a black appearance. Very creamy white head. A pretty ridiculous amount of very thick lacing. Roasted malt aromas, grain, caramel, slight chocolate, and an overall feeling of cereal. Sweet, grainy malt flavors. Big-time oatmeal. Chocolate, too. Body is smooth and creamy. Easy drinking, and balanced well."
"D- Not too heavy for the style and rather drinkable. One of my favorite stouts and certaintly one of the better oatmeal stouts out there."
"Very good looking beer with excellent flavour qualities."
"D: The bottles still in the US are holding up well, I just wish Young's would come back with their full lineup, I miss them."
"Bomber into an English pint glass. The pour is dark black with some light through the edges. The aroma is some sweet with a dash of sour and a good drop of salty soy. The flavor has many layers, starting with sweet and a bit of sour followed by chocolate, salty soy, and smooth cream. The mouthfeel is carbonated but smooth and slick, going down easy."
"Nice drinkability. Thankfully I have a few more of these as I hear rumors that the production was shut down. If these rumors are true I hope it is merely temporary."
"D: Good flavor, great feel. Drink it and enjoy!"
"Pours clear dark brown with a handsome ecru head. Aroma is toasty and roasty, lots of breads and grains and coffee. Flavor is dark chocolate and black coffee with a medium roasted bitterness and a light acidity. Mouthfeel is light but moussey in texture, making it easy to drink."
"Very smooth to the taste, almost like drinking a rich chocolate milk. A bit of a smoky nutty aftertaste. Incredible silky texture. This is definitely one of the better stouts I have tried in a while. The alcohol was well hidden. I had it on tap and it came out great. I would definitely suggest it."
"Too bad this isn't available in the US anymore...or the Winter Warmer, 2 of my favorite from Youngs. Almost opaque, poured into a Sammy Smiths pint glass, with an unusually silky texture and complex, medium-dry silky palate. Bittersweet smoke finish, this and Sammy Smiths Oatmeal stout are exceptional Stouts. Is anyone out there able to trade either one of these Beers?"
"On the whole: this isn't a spectacular oatmeal stout, but it's certainly a strong example of the style. I got the bottle for 2 bucks on clearance and might just go pick up a couple more for what it's worth."
"A half liter bottle poured into my Imperial pint glass. Appears a dark brown color with two fingers of creamy light tan foam. No lacing to speak of. Smells and tastes of bitter sharp roasted grains, molasses, milk chocolate, and caramel malt. A notch above medium in body and a bit creamy with medium carbonation."
"I don't know, not great, but not bad. I could drink this, but there seem to be more flavorful and creamy examples of this style out there."
"The taste is thick caramelly malt, fresh toast, dark chocolate fudge, with a mild coffee and drier chocolate coming up near the end. It is fairly sweet with only light bitterness. It's full-bodied and silky in feel."
"Rich head that stuck around. Very good combo."
"Overall: Mouthfeel is nice and creamy with a medium body. Drinkability is very good on this one, for a stout I could have a few and it's by no means overpowering."
"D: If I could cut the carbonation in half, this would be a sure fire 'A' rated beer for me. But I can't, so I have to mark it down. Maybe next time, I'll let the bottle breath for 30 minutes before I partake."
"I hope this one didn't get retired. This is an excellent Oatmeal Stout, right up there with Samuel Smith."
"i wonder what a fresher one tastes like. perhaps i will never know..."
"MF&D - no true complaints here, no real praise either. the feel could have been a bit thicker for to complement the intense taste of choco. the carbonation is great, real crisp. A good beer that I could drink quite often if given sufficient funding."
"Pours a viscous dark brown, nearly black, with a short-lived beige head. Aroma of cocoa, oatmeal, roasted malt, and some coffee. More malt and semi-sweet chocolate in the taste with strong smoke flavors. Leather, Fuggles, and oats follow. Long, sweet finish. Very nice."
"Summary- very smooth, very creamy, very flavorful, very drinkable. This is a very good oatmeal stout, and personally, I enjoy it even more than Young's very popular Double Chocolate. Please note that as it warms, the beer gets maltier and maltier tasting; in my opinion it is best slightly cooler than normal, and not allowed to over-warm."
"D: Very smooth, light, but rich in dark roasted flavor makes this an oatmeal with good smooth drinkability"
"Highly drinkable. Stays interesting all the way to the bottom."
"young is a pretty large british brewery and fairly common on that side of the pond. over here they're mostly known for their desserty double chocolate stout. this beer pours a dark brown nearly black until you hold it up to the light. it has a thin head which fails to persist. its pleasingly smooth but has a bit of bite. definite chocolate malt notes here. not much much bitterness but the sweetness isn't overwhelming. over all its mild with a slight toasty aftertaste. i'd recommend this ale for someone who's looking to get into the style as its highly drinkable but typifies oatmeal stouts."
"Pours a dark brown color with amber edges and a thick, foamy beige head. Aroma of oatmeal, roasted malts and chocolate. Flavor very similar to aroma again dominated by roasted chocolate maltiness, caramel and oatmeal. Dry finish."
"I really enjoyed Young's Oatmeal Stout, because of the rich but also smooth taste that it has. It pours a dark brown with a tan head and it's possible to smell the malts and chocolate. This is also one of the more fuller-bodied stouts that I have tried, which provided an overall solid taste. Not much after-taste either. Highly recommended."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a very-close to black opaque maroon color with a mocha-colored head. Moderate retention and scattered sheets of lacing. The aroma was very malty, roasted malt and chocolate malt with some ""horse-blanket"" mustiness. The roasted malt character really comes through on the tongue in a smoky way with hints of sweetness in the chocolate malt. Good balance of hops bitterness towards the end in the form of coffee flavors and though not complex quite solid. The mouthfeel was smooth and the carbonation spot-on, though the body could be a bit heavier and it is slightly acidic for the style. A pleasant beer however and not so dense or demanding that one could not enjoy a few."
"Had this on-tap at cellarman's before they couldn't get it anymore and now I hear they aren't making this anymore and im somewhat upset I haven't had a chance to drink this lately. Great tasting beer, Pours dark with a nice thick head that is there for a while."
"Pours a very dark brown/black color body, with a brown head, good sized, but quickly diminishing. A strong aroma of coffee, molasses, and alcohol. Medium body on the tongue, watery, a taste of coffee, some sourness. Bitter aftertaste, slightly fizzy."
"Overall: next!"
"Drinkability- Very smooth drinking that I would love to find on tap or in the nitro-can. I'll be picking up more of this if I ever find it again."
"Pours almost oil black which was a pleasant surprise. Medium/thick lumpy head that reveals most of the aroma right off the bat. A good mix of coffee and wood nose but also hides something else that I just can't quite put my finger on. Young's says the finish is similar to toast and I can't really disagree. Except maybe burnt toast, but not in a bad way. More like the burnt toast that you end scraping all the black off and buttering up and eating anyway. Wasn't too impressed with the actual taste. It lacks that true oatmeal stout creamy/dreamy mouth feell. I'm a big fan of Young's brews and maybe my expectations were a little too high."
"The mouthfeel is a tad beyond medium-bodied and I could definitely down a few of these. It's not the best oatmeal stout on the planet, but it's good stuff nonetheless."
"A two-finger tan head on top of a blackish beer and head left some lace patches. A sweet smell of roasted malts mixed with the oat, and a little coffee malt smell. This is one of the smoothest and creamiest oatmeal stouts I've had, and the taste is really packs a punch, also. It is a sweet taste, like chocolate or vanilla mixed with the oat malt and still just enough hops and roasted malts to give it a passing dry backbite. I could session this anytime."
"Extremely smooth well crafted beer. Very easy to drink I could put several of these down without realizing it. I am now a fan."
"D: Overall, this is a drinkable beer. Like others of this style, it weighs you down, but it's still a well done brew."
"This was a good beer. Went to a tap room in McQueeney, TX called the Silver Eagle. Nice bar. Very empty though because the owner in recent years has voiced and pushed his opinion on politics on everybody. Although, he was a nice gentleman and has a grand taste in beer. He did not fail to remind me and everyone that he had the last two kegs of this beer in Texas. It's a good beer, basic full stout. I love stouts, so this did not disappoint in the very least. It was a little thin though...it might be that these kegs were from many years ago. I didn't ask. If you get a hold of one by chance, take a drink or two. It might be your last, especially in Texas."
"I may seem biased towards this beer, but thats only because I am biased towards this beer. It is one of my all time favorite beers and will, undoubtably, continue to be throughout my life. For me, it defines the Oatmeal stout genre and gives me a point of refrence for reviewing other similar stouts. Try it- its extraordinary."
"D. Perfect to have a pint or two of this stuff. One pint is enought for me today."
"The mouthfeel is very smooth, albeit a little thin. I find myself finishing the beer way faster than I set out to. Very smooth and drinkable."
"mid to full body. good amount of carbonation. goes down smooth. a favorable category for me. i like this beer. i could drink this again."
"Yet one more fine product by Young's. Rich aroma bitter-sweet and roasty. Decent pour with a good creamy tan head, would like to see some more lacing though. Mouthfeel is good and smooth, could be thicker. Great flavor very sweet for a stout which is a nice change. Roasted malts and a hint of mild chocolate with a bitter end. Very solid stout here, although I'll take the Double Chocolate if given a choice."
"Young's Oatmeal Stout poured a dark brown, almost black color, with a very nice brown head. Smelled of coffee, and roasted malts, a bit of hops. Taste was of chocolate with hints of coffee. Mouthfeel was good for the style, think coating. Drinkability was ok, very thick. Good overall oatmeal stout."
"D. I could only have one of these in a sitting. It's a great tasting beer and I will be buying more."
"Overall, an excellent oatmeal stout. A great combination of all flavors that mix well and don't overpower any aspect of the brew. My favorite oatmeal stout. Highly reccommended!"
"Could drink this all night long."
"Not a bad beer, but not epic either."
"MF&D - Thick and flavorful. Coates the mouth well. Highly recommended."
"Poured from 550ml bottle into pint glass. Dark, opaque appearance with light head that holds for some time before dissipating into a fine lacing. Smell is exactly what to expect of an oatmeal stout. Taste neither surprises or disappoints. Mouthfeel is very typical if not the atypical oatmeal stout - smooth and rich with minimal carbonation. Overall it's a pleasant drinkable stout that doesn't offend, but doesn't present pleasant surprises either."
"Not quite Samuel Smith's, but just below. The British really no how to make a semi macro quality stout."
"Excellent drinkability, great overall, one beer that offers many qualities throughout the beer."
"Overall this is the first of the kind that I've tried, and it'll definitely bring me back to Oatmeal Stouts as a style I'd like to continue tasting in the future."
"D - Stouts have always been a little too intense for me, but this one balances very well. I certainly rather have a night of these than other stouts I've tried."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin but once again very smooth. This is a very drinkable and enjoyable stout. Flavorful and light enough for a session beer, Tasty enough to enjoy sipping just one as well. My favorite oatmeal stout is Samuel Smith, but if i was going to be swilling pints all night - I would take this one."
"D- One of my favorites. Maybe not quite as good as Sam Smith's but its debatable. I have had a hard time finding this beer as apposesed to the chocolate stout which is easy to get. I highly recommend this."
"This looks gorgeous with a pitch black body, a thick tan head that never dies and full-glass lacing. The aroma, however, leaves a lot to be desired. I just get a light, dusty smell without much coffee or chocolate. The flavor is also pretty mild, with most of the taste coming late with smooth but bitter cocoa."
"This is the first time I've tried Young's oatmeal stout, and I wish I'd sprung for it sooner. Overall, this is a damn fine beer, comparable in quality to Sam Smith's oatmeal stout - and I can't give much higher praise than that."
"Mouthfeel: slightly chewy and thick, but finishes very nicely with a roasted warmness... it feels like the hot cocoa of beer."
"D - Easy to drink but if left me wanting more."
"Definitely a prime example of the style, one to seek out. I would like to try it in the can sometime as well."
"Drinkability- @ 5.2%, a great oatmeal that is dry, but has some nice sweetness as well."
"D: Nicely crafted, in the great tradition of Young's. I will definitely buy this one again."
"A very good stout and very drinkable. Well worth the purchase"
"D: Light and drinkable, but I'd have to give a nod to any of a half dozen other oatmeal stouts above this one. Above average and drinkable if nothing else is around."
"Drinkablity: Great flavor in an easily available brew."
"The flavor is money. Smooth, creamy and delicious. It has a shortness in the mouth and doesn't stay long but the thought of how good it was is still in your mind. You taste a faint chocolate as well. Overall a wicked solid brew. I would recommend it anyone who is a Oatmeal Stout fan."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink. Not particularly my style, but I think it would be good in the fall with a bonfire or something."
"Drinkability: Very nice; it's been a while since I have tried this and I am even more impressed now than I was several years ago"
"Pours a deep black color with a thick tan head that laces the glass all the way down. The aroma is of sweet roasted malts, some toasted oatmeal, and a hint of chocolate. The taste delivers the same for this beer with a rich roasted malt backbone, hints of toasted oatmeal, a nice sweet chocolatey hint, and then balanced out with a slight hoppy bitterness. It has a very velvety and smooth mouthfeel that warms as it goes down. The drinkability is very good as this is one excellent oatmeal stout. Definately worth the try, I just wish I could try it in the Nitro-Can."
"notes - is it just me or is youngs just a massively underrated brewery?"
"D - A really nice example of the style, I like it but it some how doesn't match the hype. A good beer and worth trying."
"Pours a very nice opaque/black color with a huge head, nice lacing, and quite a bit of carbonation. It has a very nice burnt grain/oatmeal scent, although very slight. It's a very smooth stout, slightly creamy, with a nice burnt grain and bit of oatmeal flavor. It's extremely smooth and an excellent oatmeal stout."
"Pours dark, dark red, with a sizable tan head that sticks around with some solid lacing. Smells of roasted malt and coffee. Tastes the same, with some hops thrown in, right on target. This is one rich oatmeal stout - an extremely pleasant surprise. I wasn't expecting much, as I don't really enjoy their double chocolate stout, but this is terrific brew."
"All in all, a good beer this brew. Although the summed magnitude of flavor was expectably subdue as many English offering are, the direction that flavor took was right on. Delicate, unrefined, soft, boisterous, seductive, and distant all describe this beer. I couldn't enjoy it on an everyday basis, but every once-and-a-long-while it really hits the spot."
"Let this one warm up. Super cold, no go. Flavor really comes out now..."
"453 reviews as of this writting. this is a classic english oatmeal stout and definitely worthy enjoying. the grass looks greaner but this classic is a fine choice everytime! I love how smooth this is and how rich in flavor this low abv beer is! I recommend this highly."
"Wells and Young 1 pt bottle. Cant believe I have never rated this one before. Almost deep black in appearance but at closer glance this has garnet accents, nice looking tan head. Nice toasty,roasty malt aromas with a good deal of cereal in the back Again toasty malt dominated flavours, with a tinge of bittersweet chocolate, black coffee and again the cereal. Well carbonated for a stout but still nice on the palate. A nice drinkable stout."
"Poured this beer into a pint glass. It poured a very dark brown. Almost brown that left a very this brown head with lacing all the way down. The smell was of dough and malt, with just a touch of spice. The taste is of roasted malts with a bit of coffee and chocolate undertones. The mouthfeel was suprisingly light and crisp.Overall this is a very enjoyable beer and one I hope to enjoy agian and agian."
"D- An excellent brew by all means. I prefer a sweeter version of an oatmeal stout, but would definitely not pass this up."
"Black pour basically, with a thick brown staying head. Pours viscous and almost syrupy. Smells a touch sweet, roasty, malty, rich, and hearty. Has a rich, creamy mouthfeel, with some nice light oat flavor. Overall it is actually a touch bland and the flavors don't pop out at you. Not the most flavorful stout, but it is rich, creamy and easier to drink than most. After reading the bottle, I did notice the slight toast like aftertaste, and its something I could definitely have again."
"I don't know what I was expecting drinking this, but I was extremely surprised at my first taste of this beer. ""Awesome"" was the first words out of my mouth. The roasted grains really come through. A medium body to this beer makes it really drinkable. I only wish now I would have bought two of them."
"It may have been a little too simple in the feel. And while it's not the best Oatmeal Stout I've ever had, it's certainly the most drinkable."
"Young's Oatmeal Stout pours a dense dark black. The smell is rather average, yielding a moderately strong roasted malt aroma. The taste is mildly malted and has no bitterness. Mouthfeel is silky smooth and mildly carbonated. This seems to be a rather smooth and mellow Oatmeal Stout making it quite pleasant to drink."
"On first taste, I would have to say that this is one of my favorite stouts. Highly recommended."
"This is a nice contrast to Young's Double Chocolate Stout which is considerably smoother and sweeter. The Oatmeal has a nice clean bite to it that I like. I don't know that I would want to drink this one often but in my humble opinion this one is very good."
"This is a nice quaffable stout that I enjoyed at the Ginger Man in Houston. This is not the best stout I have ever had, but good none the less."
"Still quaffable nevertheless."
"22 oz. bomber poured into pint glass. Pours jet black with a tan rolicky head that slowly dissipates. Not alot of aroma present, slight hint of oats and roasted barley. Slight lacing present. Taste starts dry and finishes slightly chocolatey. Medium bodied with good drinkability."
"D: This one isn't what I expected, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. I would drink it again. This one got a lot better for me over the course of 40 minutes of warming."
"Black as espresso with a beige head, just like an exemplary stout should be. Aromas of toasted malt and coffee in the nose. Taste is smooth, chocolatey (but not like the utterly disgusting Young's Chocolate Stout), and creamy. Only the barest hint of alcohol on the finish. I can't really taste the oatmeal, per se, but I assume some of the creaminess is due to it. A fine, straight up the middle stout, highly drinkable. Better than Guinness? I think I'd have to drink them back to back to really tell the difference."
"Overall, a good, enjoyable oatmeal stout, but certainly not the best representation of the syle... this sample has nothing on Samuel Smith's.... nice, ebony, jet-black appearance with a tan, frothy head... smell, as expected, is complete with dark cocoa and espresso notes... taste strongly complements the aroma, with dark, burnt-chocolate, dark-cappuccino flavors that are rich and tasty... would certainly go great with sweets and chocolate candy... not as sweet as I was hoping for... somewhat bland compared to other Oatmeal Stouts I've sampled... good stuff, and not bad at all... Young's Winter Warmer was superb, and although this was not disappointing, wasn't the best depiction of the style... better out there, but this was certainly worth a try..."
"This has long been a favorite beer of mine and i have had it numerous times in the past but i am just now getting around to reviewing it. the beer pours with some of the most substantial tan head i have ever seen in any beer. It floats on a deep black body. The nose is of coffee with hints of alcohol and dark roasted malts with a dark chocolate sweetness. The taste is first of roasted coffee flavor followed by sweet toasted malts and grain. Really simple but really well balanced. The mouthfeel is classic stout. It is creamy and smooth with just a slight bit of carbonation. The beer on the whole is incredibly well balanced with simple flavors topped off with a gorgeous appearance."
"Something is terribly wrong here. This is one of the higher rated Oatmeal Stouts on this site but it tastes terrible to me. There must be a problem with the bottle or something. I am cooling down a Sam Smith OS right now to get some perspective. If this is the way it is supposed to taste then wow Sam Smith OS blows it out of the water. I have noticed many other reviewers have had a similar problem and questioned the integrity of the beer. The roasted barley is nice but thats all."
"I found this beer very drinkable and I've not been a huge stout fan in the past. The flavor was just delicious enough and not too harsh that I could keep drinking it at the pace I wanted. This beer I tend to favor a bit too much for the flavor savoring but it was overall a very delicious and well made beer."
"D - Very pleasant stout. Easy to drink when the temperature dips. I think it actually cured a wee cough I had.. :)"
"D: Highly drinkable, smooth and not as intense as other stouts. I wish it had a more strongly roasted flavor, but other than that I would reach for this in a second if I were jonesing for a stout and couldn't find Sam Smith."
"Poured from bottle into chalice. Pours black with nice thick, fluffy, mocha head. Good retention and lacing. Smell is rich in chocolate, roasted grain, and what seems to be a touch of raisin or tart fruit. There also seems to be a french vanilla smell as well, like a coffee creamer. Taste is good but a little watery I thought. Strong taste of nuts, chocolate, toasted grain, and a slight coffee presence. Very thick mouthfeel and suprisingly left a somewhat dry feel in the mouth which seemed out of place. Overall a very good beer, if it were a little bit more creamy then this would be a contender for a perfect 5."
"I could definitely drink a few of these. I would recommend this to anyone that likes darker beers."
"Drinkability - This is a beer I would love to sample right from the tap. This is an excellent representation of the style and is presented well via a bottle offering. Nicely done."
"Poured from the bottle into a 20oz glass, this appears very dark, almost black, with a full, dark brown head that subsides after about five minutes to leave a thin film of colour on top of the beer throughout the duration and which leaves a good degree of lace on the glass. The nose is delicate and pleasant with notes of coffee and the roasted malt that hits you with the first mouthful. This is a very pleasant beer indeed. Mouthfeel is good with a nice finish as the beer goes down, leaving an aftertaste that takes a long time to vanish. If you like dark beers this one is definitely worth adding to your repetoire."
"Poured into an Imperial Pint glass. Presented as dark brown (almost black) and opaque. Luscious cocoa-colored head, fluffy and thick, with generous lacing throughout the tasting. Scents of malt and molasses. Taste similar to nose, with the addition of coffee undertones. Full, silky mouthfeel, but not at all chewy. Very refreshing and crisp finish; somewhat uncharacteristic of the style in which flavors tend to linger. Very drinkable oatmeal stout; definitely one of the better that I've had."
"Overall very smooth and drinkable, not overly bitter or strong in any one characteristic."
"drinkability - Pretty good beer, had this with a steak and cheese sandwich. Good try, but might not buy again, because it wasn't that good. Or maybe I just need to try more oatmeal stouts to comprte it to."
"D: I haven't had an oatmeal stout in some time, and was pleased to be able to enjoy this one. So many quality characteristics in this beer make it drinkable, from its flavorful yet gentle taste, to its delightful mouthfeel, this is a great oatmeal stout. Nothing kicks away the chill of fall or winter like one of these."
"D: Very drinkable - will buy again and again."
"This is a great beer. The beer pours black, the bottle claims it only appears black from a distance, thats wrong, its black from right up close. It has a smallish head, but with pretty decent retention. The foam clings to the glass long after the beer has descended. The bottle claims a fruity aroma and a sense of toast (breakfast beer, awesome), but I detect neither. If there is any fruit, it is very faint. Both in smell and taste, its the roasted malts that identify this beer. Maybe the slightest hint of chocolate, maybe very light coffee tones. I dropped it some point in the mouth-feel department because the beer is a bit crisp, a little too much tingle on the palate for me. A nice roasted malt after taste that lingers on the tongue rounds out this beer."
"D: Two bottles of this on a cold night with a hearty winter's stew is what my Doctor ordered when I called him and said I felt bad. It did the trick."
"Pours dark, opaque with minimal head. Lacing is readily apparent. Aroma is of sweet roasted grain with overtones of dark dried fruit. The taste is not as sweet as the aroma would suggest. It has more of a dry taste, a roasty, bitter chocolate with a moderate mouthfeel. Very drinkable even with nothing to eat. A good stand alone beer that I wouldnt be ashamed to serve to friends."
"D - This is a fantastically drinkable stout. Good with food or alone."
"I wanted some Old Rasputin, but the Fresh Market I go to was out so I tried something new. Good choice."
"D: A wonderful session stout!"
"My only regret is that I bought only one bottle. Certainly this will be on my recommended list, and, with future confirmation, it could easily be a favorite. The brewer's website describes a recent merger with Wells, and today I could not find mention of the Oatmeal Stout on their list of brews. I hope this does not foretell the loss of this great beer from their line."
"D - Very drinkable if you are a fan of Oatmeal Stouts, this could possibly be very close to the benchmark for the style"
"This beer poured a thick black with a big light brown head. The smell is sweet and caramel  perhaps a bit of roasted notes can be detected. The taste is initially very roasted/burnt coffee tasting which mellows quickly. There is a malty sweetness that helps balance the initial bitter shock. The mouthfeel is on the heavy side. Overall, this is a nice roasted tasting stout that I would consider drinkable because of the smooth finish."
"Overall I like this beer, with an okay drinkablity. It a very nice mouthfeel. The taste is not overpowering in any way. Reminds me more of a regular stout but I can feel the oatmeal existed within the mash. I like the smell as it is sweet but not overly as it would seem unsweetened chocolate exists. By the time my beer was gone the lacing decipated to nothing but a couple spots."
"D - Not my first choice oatmeal stout but still good. If I was in London during winter again I'd probably drink this fairly often."
"A nice stout. Had a bit of a twang to it; not sure if it was this bottle or if its supposed to be there. Will revisit someday."
"D- I think it is a good brew but there are better oatmeal stouts out there."
"D: I dont think I will be trying this again. I got the bottle at Specs for over three dollars, and at my dinner party tonight during cocktail hour, I ended up giving the rest of my pint to my mother-in-law who doesnt care for beer but liked whatever it was I was drinking, after letting her try it. I wanted to try and find something for fall drinking, so it looks like Ill have to keep looking. Then again, Im not usually a stout drinker."
"[served chilled, in a bulb]"
"Drinkability: Not nearly as full-bodied, complex, or flavorful as other oatmeal stouts."
"drinkable?: not for me, its not bad but not good."
"The taste is malty with some chocolate making way for a dry finish. The mouth feel is slightly acidic but still very drinkable."
"Served from a chilled bottle into a pint glass, it appears much like coffee dark roast, with a robust tannish, chocolate-milky-head (lacing) that sticks to the glass nicely as it dissipates. A grainy, roasted malt on the nose, along with some toasted peanuts or almonds, and maybe a bit of smoke actually (beechnut). Flavor is mostly mild and sweet with a roasty grainy flavor coming first and backed by a smokey beechwood flavor toward the finish that tends to stick around as the aftertaste. Maybe a bit of chocolate malt as well tasted. Body is medium (at most) with a nice balance; maybe a bit more carbonation, but actually for a stout is right on point. Fairly drinkable and as drinkable as most stouts are. I was hoping for a bit more of the ""oatmeal"" flavor, but overall I like this one."
"Drinkability: I won't be trying this again. I picked this up after having had Young's Double Chocolate Stout(which I did enjoy) but this is disappointing compared to other Oatmeal Stouts."
"Pours an opaque black with red highlights. Little bubbles coalesce into larger ones which pop and leave little divots in the light brown two-finger head. Leaves rings of lacing as I drink. Aroma is dark roasted malt with chocolate and coffee flavors. Taste is roasted malt bitterness with milk chocolate. It's toasty with some caramel. The edges are nicely rounded by the oats. The biggest disappointment with this beer was the mouthfeel. I expect an oatmeal stout to be thick and chewy, velvety even. This one just wasn't. It was thin and watery. Was a little creamy, but didn't hang around on the palate long. Overall, this was a fairly enjoyable oatmeal stout, but not the first I'd reach for in this style."
"This one pours out black, with two fingers of a creamy light brown head. Very attractive. The aroma is of oats and other grains, a little sweet and roasted. In addition, upon tasting I noticed some dark chocolate hints, but a sort of generic stoutiness. As it warmed, though, it improved, becoming richer in flavor and gaining an aftertaste that was absent at first. It became creamier in the mouth as time went on, too, as it began quite crisp. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience."
"This is a very fine stout that is extremely drinkable. I do love a big heavy imperial stout but this is just so smooth and refreshing that it's a wonderful change for me for a stout. Drink up!"
"Not my favorite oatmeal stout (I'll still choose Sam Smith's), but this a very solid brew to enjoy."
"D- Better than the average beer, but there are far, far better oatmeal stouts than this. Try a Highland or a Sam Smith's if you want a good example of the style."
"My wife remarked that it looked like a root beer float in a pint glass."
"Overall a superior stout. Beautiful setup, excellent flavor profile and superior drinkability."
"Drinkability - very good and mellow, repeat easily. My favorite oatmeal stout so far."
"Pours a dark brown color with a foamy head that lasts for a short time. Aroma is one of roasted grains/oatmeal with even some hints of coffee. Taste is pretty much similar with a lot of coffee/oatmeal flavor to it. Nice, smooth and roasty. I don't get to try too many oatmeal stouts but I do think this one is decent."
"D- This is a very drinkable stout. I would not hesitate to have this one again. Quite enjoyable."
"overall, this is a perfect brew for drinkers who are unfamiliar with oatmeal stouts, and need a more restrained brew before trying the more rich ones. for oatmeal stout fans, this one does an exceptional job with handling the roastiness, coffee and chocolate notes, while not getting too bitter or sweet. Young's did a great job with this one."
"D: Quite a tasty brew that is very enjoyable overall. It's like having a good hearty meal...and why not, it's oatmeal. Well done."
"Beautiful near black with the slightest light showing through, this beer had a 3 in head poured correctly with eternal lacing. Smell was sweet and fruity, detecting a tart grape odor as if aged in a wine barrel. Taste was rather dull yet balanced with little bitter taste and more coffee mocha than anything; very little complexity. Mouthfeel was suprisingly light leaving only some mild bitterness on the tongue. This is a drinkable beer but does not live up to its look and smell. Not bad, but there are better examples of Oatmeal Stouts out there."
"I was lucky enough to enjoy this fresh on tap at the old Young's Brewery, served in a traditional pint glass. It has a very dark color, almost black. It has a very thick, creamy head with a sweet but very light aroma of honey. The taste is excellent - slightly bitter. The aftertaste is very sweet and malty. It has a full flavor across the palate. Excellent stuff!!"
"The beers pours a thick black, with a good head that lasts. The smell of roasted barley is very strong in this brew, bringing out a strong coffee scent and burned toast. Sweet chocoalte notes are hinted in the taste, but it revolves around the bitterness of the roasted barely. Mixed in is a hop leaf flavor, and as the beer warms up, the alcohol adds a mixed fruit flavor to the profile. A bitter lingering on the palate brings flavors of bitter coffee and chalk. Overall, I enjoyed this surprisingly strong offering from Young's."
"The beer poured black as night into a pint glass leaving a head that could stay for weeks. The aroma is not strong but is full of roasted malt and other subtle flavors. The taste is smooth first, bitter later, but not too bitter. You could spend a whole night trying to figure out what this tastes like as it seems very familiar. Very enjoyable."
"A nice oatmeal stout, but hardly very praise-worthy in my opinion. A bit better than average. Too much bitterness, and a bit too watery. No major complaints, but I'd just rather get something that I liked more in the fiture."
"Easily one of the best oatmeal stouts I have had in a while. Poured ink black with no light passing through. Thick, rocky sand coloured head which remained for several minutes.Smell was dark malts, black earth, toasted oats, and a bit of earthy hops deep down. Taste was sweet with dark malts, semi-sweet chocolate, coffee grounds and breakfast oatmeal. Hop bitterness is very faint, but present nevertheless. Mouthfeel is very solid, but not too heavy. This is a very sessionable stout. I'm quite pleased with it and will certainly buy this again."
"Drinkability: I would like a little more velvety smoothness from an oatmeal stout, the oats are barely present. Not bad, but nothing memorable. The best thing about thid beer is the looks."
"It's mighty good."
"This is a very drinkable stout. Mild and dry without the sweetness if that's you're thing."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking."
"A mild, yet hearty stout. Well-balanced, but its still has that distinct London mineral character. And as always, the Youngs rams head on the bottle and cap kicks ass."
"This is a nice oatmeal stout, though not one of my favorites. To me, the flavors weren't quite as robust as I would like. Still, it's enjoyable enough and would make a nice accompaniment to a brunch."
"There is something in the smell of stouts and porters that make me think of a butcher's shop and this goes for Young's Oatmeal Stout as well. The smell is actually very good with notes of bread, grass and roasted malts as well. The taste is dominated by charcoal and oatmeal (I suppose). It is dry and not sweet. One can almost taste the grains. It has a full and sturdy body but the mouthfeel is perhaps not as full as the name indicates. But it's definately a very decent stout. Personally, I like a stout/porter that is not sweet."
"Paragon of the style. Lots of craft in this beer, even a bottle that makes it all the way to California."
"M: Very good. Lighter body than the taste would suggest. Tiny bubbles of carboration. Moderately carborated. Lovely stout."
"Poured into a Aventinus glass a nice clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, a nice 2 finger plus tannish foamy head which then left some sticky lacing. The nose is of sweet roasted malts, and caramel. The taste is slightly dry and malty. There is also a nice touch of sweetness/bitterness to the flavor. Medium body. Very drinkable, only my second Young's brew to date. Highly recommend."
"When poured into the glass, the color was a very dark brown, with a fair amount of tight dark tan foam. The smell of roasted malt and fruit filled the nose with a pleasant aroma. The taste was of roasted malts, oatmeal, with a hint of chocolate and a touch of coffee. Not bitter or sour, but not sweet either. A well balanced stout that I would recommend in the future to any lover of stout!"
"One of my first and still favorites Oatmeal Stouts. The relatively low ABV, makes for a great session stout, if you are so inclined. Great on cold PA Sunday afternoon."
"This may soon be a memory as the brewery sort of went out of business! Or more accurately is merging with a rival Charles Wells. The new company will be the Wells and Young Brewing Company. So I rushed back to the Norhcoast Coop here in Eureka, CA for a bolttle of the Oatmeal Stout. Sad. Sort of like seeing a species go extinct. As a touch of irony the Chairman, Charles Yound died on Sept. 17, 2006 just eight days before the brewery closed. Was it worth it to go grab the bottle? Darn right! Poured a nice black with a big tan head. Big nose of burnt malts and chocolate. Rich mouthfeel. Nice bitter finish. So long Youngs."
"Pours a pretty dark brown/light black. Good slight off-color head that leaves quicker than I feel it should have. Alright lacing but that kind of left quik as well. A strong aroma of chocolate is immediate. The flavor spreads quickly all across tongue in a thick roasted taste. As the beer warmed, the chocolate really seemed to stick out, and a hint of perhaps coffee. A somewhat dry aftertaste, but not to bad. This would go great with a thick T-Bone."
"Pours dark, rich black with dark brown tinting at the sides. Full, dark cream colored head slowly falls to a 1/8 inch disc. Smells of coffee, barley, and cocoa. Taste is very much the same, with the inital flavor one of coffee and roasted barley, giving way to a brief hoppy taste, and finishing with a somewhat crisp cocoa flavor. Mouthfeel is full and creamy without feeling heavy, and the beer goes down very smooth. Drinkability is amazing, I could easily drink this one all night if I paced myself. Overall, this is definitely a beer I'll be having again in the future. Very enjoyable."
"The drinkability is ok. but it won't get me to revisit it soon. MK"
"As a stout this is pretty good , as an oatmeal stout i was disappointed"
"The taste was of sweet caramel, burnt chocolate, and a nice brown sugar flavor. There was no real dominant flavor; it was more like the flavors all kind of melded together to form a cohesive and enjoyable drink. Mouthfeel was medium and creamy. Drinkability was also good, I could have a few of these in one sitting no problem. Overall a very solid stout, and one I wouldn't mind having again."
"D - A nice oatmeal stout. Not a ton of complexities but a nice, full bodied sipper."
"Dark brew with slight amber color swirls. Small foamy tan head that did not last, some lacing. Smells of brown sugar. Taste is slightly sweet with a smooth finish. Good beer, easy to drink. I had a large bottle 1pt 2.7 oz and was disappointed when it was empty. I would definitely have another."
"Bottle courtesy of Adrian910ss: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a medium light brown foamy head with nice retention and good lacing. Aroma of chocolate roasted malt is pretty interesting. Taste of chocolate malt with some sweetness and a light dry bitter finish is enjoyable. Body is slightly above average with a great creamy texture. Well done overall and something I wouldnt mind indulging in again."
"D- This beer has a thin mellow flavor and not much of interest or complexity."
"Pours black with red hues and a thick foamy dark tan head. The smell is mostly malt, barley, and sweet notes. The taste is not as thick as I would have expected, but still a strong flavor. Taste is similar to the smell and well balanced, with a sweet aftertaste with some alcohol notes. The mouthfeel is very smooth with great balance, but a lighter body for an oatmeal stout. This is another good beer from Youngs, very easy and smooth. Enjoy."
"Drinkable and enjoyable. Although I've had better, I was pleasantly surprised fromt his very available & popular beer."
"Pours into the pint glass an opaque pitch brown color capped by a solid 2-finger head of brown foam. Slow fade and plenty of lacing left behind. Nose is malty with some chocolate and coffee notes discernable in the background. Taste is quite good, with the coffee/chocolate toasted malt right up front underpinned by a good, viscous, semi-mealy stout texture. Good looking and good tasting stout. A bit of alcohol evident in the taste; finishes dry and bitter. Drinkability is very good; this is my kind of stout. Definitely recommended."
"Opaque dark brown/black body with a finger of tan head. Smells like chocolate malt. Tastes roasty and sweet, with chocolate malt quite apparent. Chocolate really dominates the flavor. Full bodied. Tasty, but not as robust as Samel Smith's Oatmeal Stout is..."
"Pours out a deep black with cola hues when brought up to the light. Has a tan head looking like frothed chocolate milk, but it doesn't hold up all that well. Leaves some moderate lacing patterns. Smell is big on roasted barley, vanilla, and chcocolate. I also get some raisin/prune notes as well as faint alcohol. Taste is of pumpernickle bread, dried fruit, chocolate, and vanilla. Finishes mildy bitter, quite dry, and has a nice long roasty aftertaste as well as a presence of the house yeast. Mouthfeel is creamy, velvety, smooth, with very soft carbonation. Somewhat light body helps drinkability, but I wish it were a tad heftier. Good session oatmeal stout, but I think I'd rather spend my money on Sam Smith's version."
"Pours from the bottle to a dark brown color with medium tan head that lingers through most of the glass and leaves good lacing. Aroma is chocolate, nuts and some malt, but fairly faint. Beer is smooth drinking, with a mildly chocolate malty flavor, but again, fairly faint. Leaves a smooth finish. Not bad, but Ive definitely had better stouts."
"D: There's not much I can add to this. It's a great beer, wonderful example of the style. It's a wonderful and accessible way to introduce someone to the style, too."
"A solid stout that represents the style to a ""T"...definitely worth gettin your hands on."
"first smell gives me almost nothing. certainly smells like a stout, but it's a bit weak straight out of the fridge. definitely give this some time to warm up. the taste can best be described as nice and balanced. like the smell, the taste is subtle. i get the toasty roasted malt, hint of bitter coffee flavors expected from any stout. nothing remarkable there, but the balance and mouthfeel are awesome. near perfection, not too sweet, just enough bitter. big and smooth, so easy to drink. and at 5.2% this gets extra points for being very sessionable."
"Extremely fresh tasting, which one doesn't always find in bottled beer in Texas. Wonderfully silky mouthfeel. Very crisp bitterness on top of a very smooth base. Nice dark tan head and lacing. I can't say enough good things about this beer. Absolutely delicious. Unfortunately, it didn't show as a product on Young's web site when I checked on 10/9/06, so it may be retired."
"Overall, the perfect combinations of aromas and flavors definately give the beer an oatmeal quality, but the grain seems subdued and consequently overly hopped."
"Mouth: Big roast flavors, chocolate, oatmeal (like I could drink this one for breakfast), and a burnt cherry aftertaste. Really good!"
"Pours jet black allowing no light through and with a thick dark brown creamy/foamy head that shrinks but will not disappear. Nice smell of roasted malts and of course oatmeal. The taste is very smooth with a bit of smokiness with a clean, creamy finish. Goes down quite easily. Creamy and balanced in the mouth and quite drinkable."
"GET MY BUZZ ON- y (session)"
"This is a great stout. Full bodied and complex with a smoother finish. This is a good one to try."
"Overall: A very nice oatmeal stout which goes down fast and smooth. At 5.2%, it won't knock you over right away. Very drinkable."
"A solid oatmeal stout by all accounts. A good example of the style and just what I was wanting."
"D - The taste wasn't typical of most oatmeal stouts, but it was good."
"Overall: I like this beer. It is good to drink, and it is good to cook with. I have had it many times, and will continue to have it in the future."
"This Stout overall is a great example of the style, and a tasty after dinner treat. Recommended."
"A creamy, lightly sweet malt notes yields quickly to a prickly carbonation and a bitter burnt grain note. The beer is a touch colder than I would like, but a bit of time will fix that. Light and quaffable on the palate, yet still rich and full of flavor. Sharp with a roast malt derived bitterness and even some hop bitterness. The combined bitter notes create ample balance to the evident malt sweetness. There is a touch of in the finish of this beer that is also a result of the roast character. As the beer warms up a bit more the chocolate note even become a bit more noticeable. Quit tasty, though it definitely benefits from being served on the warm side of things."
"A decent overall beer. Unfortunately, I could not detect any hints of oatmeal in the aroma or taste."
"The flavor profile is real enjoyable. It starts off with a hit of roasted malt, then you get a twinge of bitter chocolate, and then what I'm pretty sure is the sweetness of cherries and licorice, and finally a toast-like finish (as stated on the back label, go figure). Once the bottle is finished, the aforementioned sweetness lingers. It's dry, viscous, and tasty."
"Great stout!"
"Overall, a very drinkable beer. It gets better as it warms up a bit, and next time I would let it sit for a few minutes before drinking to allow it to warm. A little too heavy to be a session beer, it's a nice treat when looking for a rich stout. I would not hesitate to have it again."
"Okay mouthfeel. A bit thin for a stout. Easy to drink, but not nearly as rich or enjoyable as their double chocolate stout."
"drinkability: I don't think I'll ever encounter a stout with a drinkability of 5, and an oatmeal stout that breaks 4 would be a shocker. This beer is very tasty, especially when savored, but it's also strong on the alcohol and has some intense flavors and is something I have to be in the right mood to drink. I'll have no trouble finishing a bottle, however."
"Easy to consume this fast, but may run out of steam after a couple due to being a little heavier."
"16.9 ounce bottle."
"A Manly, Malty Brew! Young's Oatmeal Stout is a thick, rich beer with lots of malty body and taste. It's a very dark brew, the color of strong coffee, and pours out with a thick, creamy brown head that lingers quite a while. The odor and taste are both on the sweet side. This is a wonderful beer, perhaps a bit rich for everyday consumption, but a real treat for special occasions!"
"Served in a pint glass, it pours very dark brown, close to being black with a 1/2 inch tan head. It smells like roasted coffee, malt, and a hint of oatmeal and some chocolate. The main flavor I could taste was coffee, with chocolate and malt in there too. I can't really explain it too well, but there was a weird sweetness and bitterness at the same time, but I liked it a lot. It has an oily/creamy mouthfeel with low carbonation. With full flavor and a good body to the beer, this is something I could drink pretty often. Overall, it's a pretty good well balanced beer that I would recommend to others."
"YOS is smooth and easy, pretty danged good, but not outrageously so..."
"Dark opaque brown with a hint of burgundy under a lovely deep tan 2 finger head that fades at a respectable pace, leaving some spots and a string or two of lace. Very interesting nose, combining porridge and a caramel apple and very insistent. The mouth is mildly carbonated and slightly syrupy, coating the tongue but not weighing it down. The taste is luscious, with the oatmeal and caramel carrying over equally strong from the nose onto the tastebuds, but joined by a pushy smokey roasted tone that merges into some very dry coffeeground bitter hops. The roasted nut and coffee bitter loast long after the liquid is gone, coating the back of the throat with parchment. Wonderful, just wonderful."
"I am fairly new to the world of good stouts, but I find this one to be quite tasty!"
"This is an all around great stout. It is very bitter, yet very smooth. Great mouthfeel, the carbonation excited my mouth and there was a little bit of foam head at the top throughout the entire session of drinking. I highly recommend this beer. Looks thick and black in appearance, there is no seeing through it. This beer couldn't be any better."
"I am a little disappointed, I though the oat malt should be more present in the taste. Still a very good beer!"
"Great creamy mouthfeel. Initial sips have metallic note to them. Flavour is bitter chocolate, toffee, and roasted malt. Higher carbonation than expected and a somewhat unpleasantly tart aftertaste lowers drinkability."
"I'll try this one again and drink it right next time!"
"M&D: the ever so mild and gentle fizziness results in a silky smooth and even clean-ish texture, while a medium-firm body is retained as a solid platform. All flavours are intertwined skilfully, plus a body not quite thick for the style, this beer really is easy to quaff and utterly enjoyable. This bottled version, served at the ideal temp. (for English ales) at home, is way better than the chilled, tap version I tried at the Young's Brewery Tap. Lucky me to finally track it down! Will try the second bottle closer to its BB date, though I wonder if this filtered beer could evolve/mature any further...?"
"Drinkability  Big rich stout. Highly drinkable but no session beer. Seek it out. I want to try another."
"Pretty drinkable, but more of a session ender than one you'd drink all night. Nice example of the style, but a little more smoothess is needed"
"Mouthfeel was light with tingly carbonation. Medium bodied. Overall, this is a wonderful oatmeal stout. I was greatly impressed. Very, very drinkable. In fact, it was practically ""asking"" me to drink more. Wonderful beer to sit around at night and relax. Amazing stuff."
"D: Everything about this beer is OK, except that it leaves the mouth feeling too dry. Not a bad oatmeal stout, but I don't find it to be one that I will actively seek out or recommend in the future."
"Poured jet black with parchment color head. Smelled of coffee and chocolate and a slight burnt smell. The taste was not quite what I expected. Had an almost chocolate covered bitter nut flavor. Must have a little more hop than typical of oatmeal stouts. The flavor was much fuller than most stouts with the typical velvety mouthfeel. The drinkability was good and I think I could put back a few more of these than I could a typical stout."
"The body is full and creamy, though it could use a little more carbonation. Hugely drinkable. I think I might like this even more than the Double Chocolate Stout, though both are probably my two favorite English session stouts."
"D: Taste and mouthfeel are on style, though the nose is somewhat lacking. Overall, the relatively low alcohol content and pleasing characteristics make this a rather enjoyable brew."
"Tan, dense head over an opaque totally black body, with tight lacing. Smell is coffee with cream, toasty malt and oatmeal, light smoky backnotes. Maybe a hint of licorice. Taste is more of the same, with some caramel, burnt sugar, even a hint of vanilla in a chocolate-espresso base. Nice dry finish. Where this impresses is the mouthfeel -- creamy smooth, with soft effervescent, so slurpalicious you don't want to swallow it. The only reason this isn't a five in drinkability is that it is so rich and round, it feels a bit filling. Just a super fine oatmeal stout. Go get some today!"
"I had this on tap at Barleyhoppers in Riverview. One of three Young's offerings they have on tap. This one was a BEAR for the bartender to pour, but it was worth the wait once it warmed up. This ale is dark. dark as in you look into it to long and you will lose your soul dark. Pitch black with a coffee and cream color head that sticks the whole way down the pint. This has a clean cream and coffee flavor that is very pleasant . I'd say this is pretty well balanced in that it isn't very dry or icky overpoweringly sweet. This makes for a very drinkable stout!"
"Poured opaque black with a large , creamy head. Left nice bands of lacing. Smell is slighty roasty ,milky, bit of chocolate and coffee , also some earty tones. Taste is super creamy blend of some vanilla , chocolate , dark roasty maltyness and very light bitterness. Mouthfeel is extremly smooth and silky-soft. Damn tasty! Very drinkable Oatmeal stout from Young's."
"A very drinkable beer, a classic!"
"Pours jet black with a thick tan head from a 500ml brown bottle. Has somewhat of a fruity smell and taste for a stout. It has a nice creamy mouthfeel. Not my favorite stout, but tasty nonetheless. There are other stouts I prefer, but this is definitely worth a try."
"Deep ruby black with a thick poofy tan head. Sweet creamy aroma of toasted malts and some light fruit. Dark roasted chocolate flavor, very smooth not only in the mouth but in the flavors, awesomely balanced. Dry and sweet followed by some apple in the finish. Creamy, lightly carbonated mouthfeel...a little thin, which is a shame. Smooth like crazy though...a very enjoyable stout."
"A very pleasant and easy to drink oatmeal stout."
"Very bready beerlike delicious smell. Long lasting tan head. Smooth as glass mouth feel that is also chewy as all get out.Characteristic roast flavors. Great complex flavor with a balance hop approach. Subdued licorice and leather flavors. Good stuff."
"Roasted malts and thick molasses ooze from the bottle as soon as you pop the cap. Good flavors round out this brew..very appealing tastes of chocolate, molasses, and roasted barley..the mouthfeel is a bit thin, but it is very creamy, which helps make this a sessionable brew, and a tasty oatmeal stout at that."
" What can I say that has not been said before. A true classic with high drinkability. Well done!"
"Overall i think this is one great beer because it has this great mellow flavor, nothing jumps out and completely dominates. Nothing in it to make it shocking or very unique, just a great beer."
"again theres nothing standout bad about it; if this is your thing im sure its a good one, but for me it was just extremely plain tasting."
"Drinkability: the roast bite and lack of sufficient thickness to support it... I'd probably just have one."
"Overall: Tasty yummy stuff, maybe not the best oatmeal stout I've ever had, but certainly a good one."
"Musings: I have tried the nitro version of this stuff and I would recommend staying away from it. The tastes out of the bottle far exceed the can. I love oatmeals - with my current favorites being McNeills and Wolaver's from VT. The Young's to me is just a notch below these more throaty brews, but nonetheless is a pretty tasty stout."
"Mouthfeel is thin for the style, but not bad. Drinkability is decent. This is not a bad beer, probably a slightly above-average beer that I was just expecting a little bit too much from."
"D = Just above average. One I would buy once in a while for a change."
"I suppose for this beer drinkability gets an ok score because this would make a great session stout. Actually, if I was in the mood for a session and didn't want to get full, this stout would do well. It doesn't do anything wrong, really, it's just not a Meal in a Bottle, which is how I like my stouts. You could drink lots of these without getting full. I personally wouldn't because I don't think it's all that satisfying an experience."
"Another one of Young's products that I really enjoyed. Keep up the good work Young's!!"
"A little disappointing after the initial pour was so promising but this is still nevertheless quality stuff from Young's. Still, this is a distant second to their awesome Double Chocolate."
"This is a great full bodied oatmeal stout."
"Pours a delicious black with brown streaks, a nice creamy head rises. The smell is of bread and brown sugar, a subtle hint of roasted coffee, nice milky nose. The taste is of milk, sugar cookies and spices. A well rounded beer, nitro pours well and gives it a nice cream taste."
"A very solid version of the style. Pleasant tasting and pretty drinkable for an Oatmeal Stout. Even with a big, chewy roasted malt character this could be a smooth session brew."
"Notes: This is a great oatmeal stout and overall compares well with other brews. I could see myself buying this often and encouraging others to try this. This is a newbie friendly beer that I would try to push on those who claim they do not like dark beer."
"The taste is distinguished. It has tones of roasted malts and fine dark chocolate and an insinuation of smoke. Very smooth with a great mouth feel; I think that they got the carbonation just right on this one. One of my favorite things about this stout is that it is not overly heavy, making for a beer that could be handled all night long.Lots of flavor and great complexities make for a great beer."
"D: Hell yeah!"
"Pours solid black with brown edges. 2 fingered head and persistant lace. Aroma of fruity esters followed by some faint chocolate and roasted barley. Taste dominated by roasted barley. Medium light body with a smoother but thin mouthfeel. Hops are well balanced and stay in background until finish where they combine with the dark roasted barley in to an outstanding finish. I was anticipating more body and complexity of taste. Very good but not a style that I have explored much."
"Pours deep brown with just a hint of light shining through the edges. A 2 finger tan head falls to a modest coating over top. Nose is solid roasted with light caramel and chocolate sweetness hanging under. Very good aroma. Flavor is well balanced. Roasted malt is prevalent with a creamyness from the oats. Even a touch of hop bitter comes on the finish. Feel is moderate with a light carbonation...almost a touch slick. A nice oatmeal stout. Flavors really blend well, nothing detracts."
"overall, a delicious english stout, something that i will have often as a standby, great winter brew."
"I wouldnt want another of these, frankly because I wouldnt want to waste my time."
"This is a thick and rich beer but its hearty thick characteristics dont really take away from its drinkability. All and all a good beer!"
"This I would take over a Guiness anyday. Very good full flavor stout."
"This pours a rich dark brown and leaves a huge three finger head.The smell is a little malty with coffee and chocolate,which leaves this a little sweet.This has a sweet coffee,chocolate and malt taste,not bad but not great.This has a nice full m/f and is a beer I would try again."
"Pretty thin bodied, although properly carbonated. I mean, it was fairly smooth and tasty, just not malty stout enough. The import price will send me back to some US made Oaty stouts."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Flat. Smooth. Nothing. Is it possible that this can is past its prime? I am drinking it five months past the date on the bottom of the can... I shall revisit this again one day, and report my findings right here."
"This is a gem of a stout but have it out of the bottle or served across the pond. Young's impresses me everytime. A very drinkable stout."
"Very smooth and creamy. Milk chocolate and roasted coffee bean flavors. This is a hearty and wholesome stout. Enjoyable and a great representation of the style."
"Definitely a nice experience for my first foray into the stout style in quite some time. Probably would make a great dessert beer with it's chocolately and coffee flavors."
"Cheers!"
"A good oatmeal stout. Yum. Poured out to a black coffee like color with a dense, brown head of about 1/2 inch. Layers of lace are present in the glass. Lower carbonation. Smells like coffee mixed with dark chocolate and some hickory like smoke elements. Taste was full and robust. Flavors of coffee, unsweetened cocoa, and a creamy-milky like finish. Not too complex. Good mouthfeel was thich and rich. I'd have this again, but I would wager to say that a touch of sweetness could put this brew over the top and give Samuel Smith's Oatmeal stout a run for it's money. Recommended."
"Drinkability is high. I have enjoyed this many times and will continue to do so."
"This beer is black. No light comes through this bad boy. Poured with a small head that quickly dissipated. Light lacing. The smell is typical for this style. The taste is a little off on this one. It has somewhat of a bite to it. The drinkability is reduced as a result. Not a bad beer though. I would possibly try it again in the future."
"It's a pretty good example of an oatmeal stout, with more stout than oatmeal. Easy to drink, and a bit rewarding for the effort. Not the best oatmeal stout I've had, but a good try."
"I've had this one a few times. It pours deep, dark brown, not quite black, with a reasonable tan head. It smells a bit like bunt cookies, but not in a bad way, with a definte oat presense. This is a malty brew for sure. The flavor is slighty bitter chocolate, with a tiny bit of hop zing in the middle, and a warm and round malty finnish. Also, this brew is not overly sweet and has refreshing bitter qualities. I would say the taste has a weak begining, but a nice lasting aftertaste. The mouthfeel is somewhat fizzy to start, but coats the mouth nicely and lingers pleasantly. Robust, but not too heavy. A good, middle of the road brew."
"The aroma is toasty and like burnt malt, but in a nice way. The taste is bitter chocolate and some coffee undertones. I detect a faint hop flavor in there too. Overall, a very good stout. I recommend it."
"Opinion: Well, I keep trying this beer, but I think that I am probably going to just stick to Sam Smiths, because I like the presentation a whole lot better. This isn't a bad beer, but it isn't just wonderful either. It's a drinkable beer."
"Closing thoughts: I can't help but think this beer is mildly skunky, but maybe it is supposed to have this steely aftertaste. Quite drinkable and palatable, but not one of the best tasting oatmeal stouts I've had."
"Tasty will purchase again."
"The explosion from the can resulted in a black brew with tan foamy head that would not leave. Smell is of caramel, coffeen and prunes. Taste is toasty with a nice dry edge. Finishes a bit dry in the mouth with a nice dark fruitiness mixed with coffee. A good solid brew."
"Drinkability is nice and I will definitely have another sometime."
"This is a very good beer and I highly recommend it. Nice and drinkable but kind of filling. Not a great session brew but one to try for sure."
"It's a stout, so...it pours black...with ruby highlights. Nice tan head that shrinks to a coating. Smell is grainy, grainy, grainy, a little metallic, very roasty. Taste follows the roasty theme, roasted malts, burnt, smokey toast, with a nice hoppy bite to round it out. Mouthfeel is thinnish, I like a thicker stout. Drinkabilty is quite high however. I think I like the double chocolate a little better, but this is another quality offering from Young's. A solid, roasty, smokey stout."
"I was quite impressed with this one. Dark brown/black colour with a very dark head. Smells of dark chocolate and roasted malt. More of the same as far as taste goes, with hints of licorice and coffee creeping in. Medium weight on the palate. A world class stout."
"Massive heavy bottle common of Young's. Pitch pitch black, not a hint of light breaks through. Thin dark tan head that faded quickly into lace on the rim. Some baker's cocoa and wheat bread on the nose, pleasant tame small. Tremendous malting on the tongue with some baker's chocolate lingering on the center tongue. Good pleasant feeling and quite drinkable."
"Pours an almost-opaque black with a thick tan head that retains well, an enticing looking stout for sure. Smell however is somewhat lackluster, some sweet barley aromas and a hint of cream but nothing exciting or complex. Taste includes notes of roasted coffe, sweet molasses burnt toast and plumb. Pretty tasty oatmeal stout, but not one of the best i've had. Mouthfeel is appropriately creamy and smooth with mild carbonation. Drinkability is good. A solid oatmeal stout, but not in the same league as Sam Smith's or Troeg's."
"The appearance of this beer is extraordinary. The color is dark brown, almost black, with a light brown head. Head is large, thick, sticky, and creamy. Retention is excellent. The aroma, however, is just a little bit disappointing. A quick whiff of sweet dark malt is joined by a hint of roasted coffee. The taste provides plenty of sweet, creamy malt flavor. An earthy malt flavor combined with a roastiness adds to the layers of flavor here. A pleasent dryness makes an appearance in the finish. This is great stuff, the layers of flavor blend nicely and a creamy mouthfeel adds another enjoyble element."
"Pours an opaque black color, with a large tan head that has great retention and leave wonderful lacing. The aroma is creamy. The taste is fantastic, and very smooth. Creamy and chocolaty. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, a little lighter than most stouts but good none the less. Overall, this is a very good beer. It looks great, tastes great, and is enjoyable to drink."
"Very very drinkable. So smooth and creamy I only had one at this sitting but could have had many more. I'll be back to try this one again and again."
"Pitch black color with a creamy light brown sticky head. The aroma is sweet with chocolate and coffee. Hints of liqourice and smoky malts. Smooth creamy mouthfeel and medium bodied. The taste is semi-sweet with a smokiness from the roasted malts. Dark chocolate and coffee are balanced out with a light hop. The oats bring a sweetness that counteracts the coffee bitterness. Has a dry finish and a lingering aftertaste. A very complex oatmeal stout and damn good!!"
"Drinkability- Nothing special, but will work fine to marintate pork ribs or something meat-like in overnight."
"I always have a soft spot for the oatmeal stouts. I love st ambroise, love the sam smith, and now I love the Fuller's. Sweet, milky, roasty, smooth, mellow and full of chocolate and coffee flavours. Pours pitch black, with a large tan head, great retention. Easy to drink, great coffee aroma. What more can you ask for."
"general: a good session beer.. make that a very good session beer, and certainly good with a meal. but not something that will make your night. make sure to drink fairly warm though and let it open up a bit... initial taste was far worse than the beer is capable of."
"Poured out of the bottle into a snifter. A smallish tan head that didn't like sticking around too long, but when she was there, she was about one finger thick. Dark body, but can see the red coming through the edges, when it got close to being finished, the red was very pronounced. Smelled of malt, some chocolate and coffee and hops. Taste was of roasted malts, dark chocolate, smooth, light coffee and a mild hop kick. Think body, this is my first Oatmeal stout, so I'm assuming the style is supposed to be like this. Went down smoothly, didn't have too much of a buzz or anything when I was done with the pint 9 oz that came in the bottle. Will drink again."
"Enjoy, this is a very good beer."
"Drinkabilty-I like this so good Im lost for words."
"Very fine oatmeal stout. Easy to drink ... to easy, mine is almost gone. Try some."
"A nice but not great stout in my opinion. A bit too sweet on the balance."
"A fine oatmeal stout, easy drinking. A bit bigger body would be nice, but still very nice."
"Very smooth stout, mostly smooth roast. Balanced , just on the sweet side, with definite chocolate malts.Liked this better than the St. Ambroise and perhaps the Brooklyn Chocolate. A bit past expiry date in October, but not the worse for wear as carbonation was understatedly appropriate.."
"16.9 ounce bottle sampled, has freshness dating notched onto the label. Pours the expected black, with light coming thru the edges, with a tan head and some sticky lacing on the glass after every sip. Nose is light licorish, and some burnt grain. Dark chocolate, mocha, minerally slate notes. World renowned smooth mouthfeel evident and noted on the tongue and entire mouth, vanilla in the finish. Classic dark brew, understated and British in attack. Fine, tasty quaffer, well worth a try."
"Pours black as night with ruby undertones when held up to the daylight. A fine 2 inch head developed but quickly went away. Nose has hints of chocolate. Taste is good, a solidly complex beer. There is a wonderful blend of toasted malts, chocolate, and just the right amount of hop bitterness that keeps you wanting another sip. Mouthfeel is very creamy and smooth. Overall drinkability is very good. This beer gets better with each sip! Unfortunately it is the only one I have."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a super-dense 3/4"" dark tan head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Had the whole nitro cascading thing going on, as expected, that I always like to watch. Head is SO thick, lasts and lasts, with superb full-coverage lacing. Aroma is lightly of dark malts, but frankly not much going on here. Taste is chocolate malts and oats, with a slight bite of hops coupled with a slightly sour finish. Mouthfeel's got both the oatmeal and nitro working for it, hard to beat that combo, and drinkability is great as well. Always enjoyable."
"Overall, the bitterness was more pronounced than expected and the malt character was balanced a little too strongly towards roasted coffee. Still, a nice stout. Poured from a 22 oz. brown bomber."
"Pours with a one-finger light brown head leaving a good lace. Totally black color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is nutty. Starts with a bitter-sweet chocolate flavor and finishes smooth with just a hint of dryness. $2.50 for a 12oz bottle, from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Overall, very nice version of the style. Quite tasty. Would be happy to buy it again, when I'm in that stout mood."
"Gorgeous black color. Not as deep as a big imperial but a nice black overall. Small tan head. Low aroma-some roasted malt. Nice mellow roasted malt flavor upfront. Not overly bitter from roasted malt. Very malty flavor. Silky smooth and velvety mouthfeel. An extremely drinkable brew. One that other oatmeal stouts should be measured against."
"Will be trying the other Young's beers soon."
"Overall, a very solid brew. Sort of the bridge between the standard Guiness/Murphy's stouts and the exceptional Young's Double Chocolate/Samuel Smith Oatmeal stouts. I will get this again."
"I expected a lot out of this brew. I would like to have it on cask instead of the gas can. Anyhow, the beer seemed to be a fairly simple stout. Dark brown to black in color. There was a thin, fizzy head that left almost no lacing. Roasted malts were present but seemed to be quite subdued, just like the hops. This was a very basic stout. No suprises."
"Mouthfeel is medium, but creamy enough to fool you into thinking it's bigger. Finish is roasty and bitter-sweet. Yummy all the way."
"Not bad, but fairly ordinary compared to the other beers from Young's lineup."
"Not as chewy and dense as Samuel Smiths, but still a good beer."
"Poured from a nitro can. The color is black with just a hint of brown when held up to a light. The tan head looks quite creamy and appealing, and it leaves plenty of lacing on the side of my glass. This beer could not look more attractive. The smell is sweet chocolate and roasted malts. The flavor is chocolatey, but not nearly as much as their Double Chocolate Stout. Good roasted flavor too. I find that the nitro can serving makes many beers very drinkable. Good stuff."
"Pours deep brown, almost black. The head was around a finger, moderately foamy with very good lacing throughout. Brownish foam. Smelled of roasted malts, was expecting more oats in the nose but could barely tell it was there. Taste was mainly the roasted malts, again there is some oat but I was really expecting more oatmeal. Very slightly sweet. Mouthfeel was pretty good. This stout is rather good, but I'd go with the chocolate one any day."
"The head on this one new lets up. When I finished the beer, there was still some creamy head on top. Totally amazing. The lacing was also huge. This is one of thte better OS out there. The malt is huge, but is nicely balanced. It is sweet but not cloying. The beer is about as drinkable as they come. A perfect pub beer."
"THe first sip reveals a creamy textured brew with fine yet tingly carbonation. Flavor is as expected with malt dominating getting mostly choc and roast malt flavors on the start with some oaty hits in the middle and then the roasted malt covers my palate for the finish. Body seems to lighten a little on the swallow, maybe just the ease of consumption but takes away on the mouthfeel score for me. Overall a nice drinkin brew."
"Tasted from a bottle poured into a pint glass. It has a nice dark, almost midnight black color. The nose on this beer is awesome, vanillia, some maltiness, and maybe even some butterscotch. The mouthfeel is great too, nice creamy with just the right amount of bubbles. Nice stout, I probabaly could only put down a few before I got extremely full."
"16.9 oz. bottle. Pours out a very dark brown. Nice creamy looking tan head. Looks like it will be absolutely fantastic. The smell is subtle and mostly roasted grains. The taste is full flavored roasted malts with incredible smoothness. The mouthfeel is awesome. Wonderfully rich and creamy with perfect carbonation. A luxurious texture in the mouth. The drinkability is also very good due to it's low ABV , great taste and wonderful richness. Great oatmeal stout!"
"Ordered this beer at the Moan and Dove last night not knowing what to expect. It's basically a Guinness in disguise. Very similar - nice coffee colored appearance, bit of milky head on top(I didn't catch any cascading effect though). Smells pretty nondescript, but some nice malt characteristics in there. Taste is nice, maybe a little sweeter than Guinness. I don't really mean to be comparing the two, but they're very similar. Real smooth and creamy mouthfeel, medium bodied I'd say. And of course very drinkable. A nice alternative."
"Reflection: This is a very tasty stout and it's good for a change if like me you drink a lot of beers that are loaded with hops and very bitter."
"Impecably smooth and inviting. Good overall feel. Quite sweet and thick. Not bad, but out of the can, it's slow going."
"An attractive beer with a very dark brown body and a dense light brown head, but the flavor comes in a little thin. The aroma has whiffs of chocolate and the body is creamy enough to satisfy, Id really like to see something a bit richer in flavor. The finish is a little bitter and slightly metallic."
"Another stellar Young's beer. Pitch black in color and very little carbonation and a head that leaves very soon after pouring the beer. The beer reeks of dark malts and the sweet sugar notes that almost always accompany a oatmeal stout. It is not the best oatmeal stout in the world, but it is always available where I live so I drink it when I am in the mood for a good oatmeal stout. You just cannot go wrong with Young's beers."
"A nice addition to Brixx Pizza,pours a creamy black with a some reddish tint with a creamy nitro head.Aroma is on the sweeter side with some dark roast coffe thrown in,what a smooth creamy mouthfeel near perfect.Taste has a nice big bitterness up front but becomes more tame as u drink more some dark roast coffeee and ubsweetened chocolate with anice underlying softness.Man how drinkable is this beer on nitro damn I could drink this all night and did."
"Still, a big and tasty oatmeal stout, especially nice on a cold night, with a fire in the fireplace."
"What an odd little oatmeal stout. This is one of my favorite styles, along with sweet stouts, and there just aren't that many great ones out there. Had this on draft at the Ginger Man in NYC, and it poured a beautiful midnight black with a tan, creamy, sexy head. The reason I say this is odd is because the first five to ten sips are sooo good, just an absolute orgy of dark roasty coffee chocolaty flavors tempered by a nutty sweetness that just makes the beer slide down your throat. As the beer warmed and disappeared from my glass, it just became more average. Now I know that this has to do with tastebuds adjusting and what not, but it just seemed a different beer to me. Thinner, but very drinkable still. Maybe it's a trick by the brewery to get you to drink more by always desiring that fresh pint. Overall, a very good oatmeal stout, and one I'll have to seek out more fequently. I bet the nitro can is damn fine, too."
"This beer pours on opaque black even when held to a light. The tan head is a inch thick with good reteantion and moderate lacing. The aroma is lightly of coffee and chocolate and somewhat sweet. It tastes mildly of burnt coffee with a little chocolate. This is a medium bodied beer with a nice sort of creamy mouthfeel. As for drinkability, give me more. A wonderful brew."
"Can has instructions for consuming, and no ABV%"
"Pours opaquely darkest brown, almost black, with some ruby highlights. Big tan head that leaves some good residual lacing. Toasty, roasty, scorched malt, and trace oatmeal aromas, some typical stout aromas (like coffee and chocolate) creep into play, too. Very roasty tasting, oatmeal flakes take the backstage, but are cameoed. Slight minerally water background, consistent with English brewing practices concerning water hardness. Very nice, smooth and enjoyable. There are better oatmeal stouts out there, but this one's a good one. I've experienced this beer on nitrogenated draught, and the bottle's better, IMHO."
"this has some nice sweet chocolate aromas and the appearance is really good. taste is smooth, mild and very well balanced. nothing stands out too much in the taste because it seems so balanced. though there seems to be some coffee after taste. i like this better than their dirty dick's and it should be noted that this sample is five months past the best before date."
"This brew poured a deep black color with a super creamy chocolately head that just looked so nice. Initial aromas were roasty and malty with just a hint of oats and cocoa. For flavor this brew started off quite roasty with just a slight astringency. Following a nice array of chocolate, more roasty malts, and oats mixed well together to lead to a full flavored taste, though the body of this brew was surprisingly thin. The brew was for the most part sweet throughout with only a slight bitterness in the end. Though the body was a tad bit thin, the mouthfeel was still somewhat creamy which was quite nice. Overall a nice offering to try, but I wish this brew has just a little more body to it."
"A very good example of this style. Rich and smooth with a thick head. This bottle was similar to Sammy Smith's Oatmeal Stout but not as hearty or rich. The color was ruby black and the presence of aroma hops was minimal. The mouthfeel was pleasant and the finish was subtle."
"Drinkability  This one was even-keeled if uninspiring. I did enjoy the extremely dark, burnt nature of this offering from Youngs, though."
"-Oelergud"
"To think that 10 years ago, I thought this was good stuff. OK, so maybe I'm babied by awesome stouts, but this one sucks. The ruddy mouthfeel and oxidized taste are awful, compunded by the year-old butter taste. Ugh. Down the sink it goes."
"Quite drinkable, good with food, or by itself. Great deal for the price."
"I could drink these all night. I wish I has a nitro-tap of this in the house. Great, great beer."
"With imports it's always tough. The dating states best before Sept. 04. Somehow this sample lacked the intensity and complexity I'd hoped for. But don't let that stop anyone from trying it."
"Pours a black with light hints of brown on edges of glass, wow big brown head need a relaxed pour with this beer almost spilled some would have been sad. Smells of bitter coffee and burn malt with some oat sweetness coming thru. Tastes wonderfully smooth, beer seems to wash around your mouth if by magic departing sweet oats then bitterness mainly from burnt malt, with coffee and choclate flavors followed by light hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is great really smooth and creamy has good body but seems lighter at same time, the way this beer feels in the mouth definately enhances its taste, I was going to give a 4 but had to up it a half. Drinkability we will just say I am really sad I bought just one I will remedy this next time I make it to Boone."
"I don't want to be too hard on Young's Oatmeal Stout since it is a decent version. It does, however, fall a little short of its better known and better tasting competition."
"This one poured out black with mahogony highlights. A tan head falls quickly but hangs around for awhile. Aroma is rather weak, with some roasted malt notes and english style hopping. Taste is dominated by diacetyl. this is no doubt a buttery tasting stout. Bitter roasted notes are in there, as well as some chocalate type flavors. I must say diacetyl dominates, but I've been known to be very sensitive to it. Decent full mouthfeel, and drinkablity is not bad if you enjoy the buttery tastes."
"Pours thick and black and meets all the expectations of a good looking stout. Nice foamy tan head that lets me know that this stout means business. I pick up smells of carmel and nuts. Again, classic in it's presentation. Very nice, balanced taste of carmel, malt, and carbonation. Pretty straight forward. I think the more I drink, I come to the conclusion that it looks better than it tastes. It's definitely a good stout but to me it just seems too safe. I think I'd reach for a Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout or an Oak Barrel Stout before this one again. Worth a try if you are getting into stouts and definitely a classic example. But I've seen it done better other places."
"Tastes of nutty roasted malt. Some oily but understated oats are evident. A light bitterness and the smatterings of coffee and milky chocolate you would expect. Smooth. Lightly creamy on the palate but mostly just damn smooth, especially for an oatmeal stout. Finishes lightly bitter. Oh so good and good for you."
"It reminds me of Sam Smith's Oatmeal, which I really like. I could drink this too, probably until I had to crawl home."
"Mouthfeel is awesome, and although pretty drinkable it is a little heavy on the stomach."
"Summary: Outstanding stuff. Even my mom liked it, and she normally dismisses anything darker than a pale ale as ""that black $!&@ you and your father drink."" That alone earns it top marks in my book. I can see why the beer guru at our local liquor store insisted on the widget-powered can, though - CO2 would wreck the mouthfeel entirely. All in all, a great effort from Young's."
"Overall- a mediocre stout that I would prefer over Guiness but wouldn't purchase again."
"What a great example of a well made beer. I know of no oatmeal stout that can top this one, God bless the Ram Brewery!"
"DRINKABILITY: All day...all night...any day...any night..."
"This is a great oatmeal stout and one to try on tap if you get a chance. I would love to try this brews versions at the same time, on-tap, nitro can and bottle to see the differences. Sounds like a nice experience!"
"This beer pours a rich chocolate colored, bubbly head that sticks around to the last. The color is deep, dark brown as expected. Not too much smell, nice malt, beer smell. The taste is a complex mix of chocolate, malt and tar with an alcohol kick on swallow. The mouth feel is full and thick with a clean after glow. This is a real nice beer for that end of a hard day relaxation. This fits a pattern of good brews from Young's Brewery."
"A big nitro head that makes it look like Guinness makes one think that this beer is all about easy drinking. The easy drinking is there but the malty burnt flavour shows depth that few Irish Stout's can match (Biddy Earl?). I really liked the dryness and great balance that raise this Stout to a high level. The widget changes this beer in ways that add rather than subtract from this great beer."
"Dark chocolate and oats flow over my palate. The chocolate, ever so sweet, yet ever so bitter. The infussion of oatmeal balances the taste nicely."
"Anyhow...it's a smooth sippin' oatmeal stout. Cheers."
"Almost black. Nice clarity. Nice creamy long lasting brown head. Nose consists of some burnt cocao, roasted malts and in contrast, some sweet milky tones. The taste is soothing and comforting. A nice blend of lactic sweet tones and bittersweet chocolate tones. Very easy drinking. Mouthfeel is velvety and the body is about medium full."
"Well, I think big beers are ruining me. I can barely taste this one. Very attractive looking beer, some subtle ""sweetish"" (not swedish) vanilla aromas. As smooth beer that could be beefed up a little in the taste department. A decent mouthfeel, but I want to have to chew on an oatmeal stout. This reminds me somewhat of a dry stout, definately not the sharp black malt flavors, but definately a touched over hopped for an oatmeal stout I think. A bit of sour flavor, but all in all needs more to really satify my definition of an oatmeal stout."
"Alas - the beer is rather thin for a stout (or for an oatmeal stout), and I was kind of expecting more than regular-stout flavors. Not a bad beer, but not fantastic."
"A dark black with brown tints and a thick foamy tan head. Nice lacing. Aroma of sweet dark chocolates and burnt malts. Taste is extremely smooth with a silky chocolate flavor. There is a nice earthy tone to this brew that plays well. The oats and malts work very well together. Body is pretty full with a very mellow feel. This is a great beer and what you compare oatmeal stouts to. Very pleasing chocolate coffee aftertaste. Again this is a great beer."
"A quaffable though fairly mild and pedestrian stout, it is great depiction of how roasted malt can have that flavor without noxious effects. I could drink this all night with no ill effects. Went impeccably well with a dinner of potato & cheese pierogies and veal & mushroom pierogies covered in sour cream, pumpernickel bread, and a nice plate of Beef Stroganoff."
"Drinkability. Too one dimensional."
"One of my favorite nitro beers. Sursprisingly flavorful, the malt and oatmeal seem to survive the nitro pour well. No tinny flavor. A very smooth, easy drinking stout. Not the most complex, but it's a great session beer. I don't care for the canned version much, but on tap it's fine by me."
"Dark brown, non-transparent, with a biege, thick, foamy head that rises up an inch high in the glass. Low aroma of malt and hops. Chewy mouthfeel, full and creamy. Malty, not too sweet, a bit chalky with some smoke. A bit of vanilla and toffee in the finish, and a slight hint of banana hangs on the palete. Interesting flavors that come and go as you move through this one. None very strong or dominant though. The head hangs in there for the duration and leaves fine lacing all the way down."
"Light to medium bodied. Chewy, full mouthfeel with tingly carbonation. Great drinkability."
"Appearance was excellent, midnight black with a creamy tan head. Head retained quite nicely, and left nice lacing. Smell was a combination of toasted barley and grain with slight alcohol undertones. Taste was also toasted barley and malt with a very slight sweetness. Mouthfeel was a bit thinner than I expected, not quite as creamy as I would have liked. But not bad. Drinkability was good, although I would find it kind of hard to drink more than two of these bottles being that they are full pints. A nice offering, I would recommend it to oatmeal stout fans."
"Midnight black with mahogany hued edges and a dense and creamy but small nitro head of creme color. The head settles to about half a finger after a bit. Subtle roasted malt aroma with an oaty, almost caramel sweetness and hints of light hopping. The flavors are equally mild. Roasted and slightly sweet with a slight hop presence. Touches of caramel sweetness here and there. Flavors are very mild in this nitro version, but do still come out better as it warms. Light-bodied. A pleasant crispness from the hops and the smoothness and creaminess make for a great mouthfeel and extreme drinkability. This would be a great session beer."
"The beer as it disembogues from the bottle soot black, the head ponderous in size, semi-creamy in texture and the color a toothsome light chocolate with the lace a satiny sheet to obscure the glass. Nose is sweet chocolate, coffee, and nice burnt grain aroma also present, quite a treat for the old schnozzle; start is ambrosial, rich in malt, the top middling to full in feel. Finish is benignly acidic, the hops delectable in their spiciness, aftertaste quite dry and a great stout when youre not into those Imperials we seem to have adopted as the National Stout!"
"A New Year soon beckons  amid a very turbulent period in English Brewing which has seen all of the Big Boys fall prey to overseas mega-corps; my New Years wish is that Youngs continue to brew fine Ales & Stouts and keep putting quality before the bottom line. Hey, if it ain't broken don't fix it."
"Nice and cheap too, one of the better stouts you can get at this price. Definately worth a try."
"Color is a very dark brown, nearly black with thin slivers of crimson brown highlighting, thin tan head appears quickly and fades the same, fast dripping lace with minimal stickage. Aroma is subdued of roasted malts, with touches of chocolate, coffee, and burnt cookies. Taste is mildly mixed of a light roastyness thats favorably easy and mixing well with some sweet chocolate and light coffeeness, notes of banana softness enter in just after midway and has a small hold just before the chocolatey roasted drying finish. A nice mild smooth taste with just enough energy and roast to keep it to the lips. Feel is pretty soild in the mediumness area, has a slight sharpness of carbonation in there. A nice drinker, liked the smooth mildness this has but could be a bit sweeter for an oatmeal stout though."
"This beer has always been one of my faves to sip pints of when out with friends. It is a superior stout to the others I typically see out (Murphy's, Guiness, Beamish, etc.) I think the nitro-tap is best, then the bottle, then the draft can."
"Pretty good but not the best effort from this great brewery."
"Very smooth and creamy, only slight bitterness, medium-full feel thats very flavorful and drinkable"
"Gorgeous, classic nitro pour tops off with a beige pillow of dense, tiny bubbles about a finger deep. Bubbles cascading down sides of glass in marbled rosewood and mahogany patterns. Lace sticks hard to edges of glass and dries out into beautiful crusts of bubbles. Aroma contains hints of sweet, dark malt over a strong oatmeal warmth, finishing with characteristically English hops that are not particularly subdued. Flavors of big, oatmealy, dark wheat toast closed out by more English hop flavor. Slightly espresso-ish and is that a hint of peanut butter high in the middle of the palate? Big mouthfeel: smooth and resiny, yet light in actual body and viscosity; finishes with a slight oily slickness. Velvet smoothness over the tongue. With its lingering bitterness, this is a beer to keep reaching for; however, it is probably too massive for session drinking. A pleasant pint."
"But my palate still seeks the satisfaction I was rewarded with almost everyday in a nice Young's AAA from the cask..."
"Really nice tan nitro head that look like a capuccino. Has a mildly sweet biscuity nose with a hint of tartness. Sweet oat toasty flavors to start with a slightly dry and bittersweet chocolate finish. Did notice some prune and currant flavors.This stout is very nice and very drinkable. Would love to try it on tap."
"A good stout overall, but it didn't bowl me over. It was too subdued in both flavor and aroma, in my opinion. And I drank it pretty damn warm. I could imagine that it could be rather bland if drank cold."
"first it busts out with the cool cascade action but settles into a pitch black thick liquid. smells sweet and of coffee, toffee and light roasted malt. the taste is of light coffee, sweet malt, a bit of chocolate and the smallest hop touch. soft and very creamy in the mouth, finishes slightly dry, its a filling beer and this stuff is highly drinkable if your gut can hold it."
"Bottle purchased at Huckleberry's in Spokane. Poured just about as dark a brown as it could be without actually being black. Big light mocha colored head that dissipated after a couple of minutes. Smell was of dark, chocolatey, coffeeish malts with a litle bit of fruitiness in the background. Taste begins with a bitter chocolate flavor, with a little fruitiness in the background that reminds me of cherries. Mmh, chocolate covered cherries... But I digress. There's a nice, black coffee finish to the proceedings. This is a little bit thin for a stout, but not to an alarming degree. Like you'd expect from an oatmeal stout, this is a rather filling beer. Unless you enjoy feeling like you need a crane to get you off the bar stool, I'd stop at one per beer session."
"The more I taste, the more I like."
"Appearance: Pours deep caramel brown with a decent sized quickly dissipating tan head, lacing is fine and webbed. Aroma: A fruity suprising alcohol tinged presence along with a creamy chocolate and mild coffe notes to top it off. Taste: Creamier than most stouts the dark roasted malts aren't as dominant a bit tame bit the chocolate flavor and coffee esque finish make this one a classic plus with an added bonus fruity overtones and a nice presence of alcohol in the flavor yum. Mouthfeel: Smooth even carbonation a bit dry in the finish, not as fluffy and full bodied as most oatmeal stouts but still very tasty. Drinkability: Solid a go to especially on nitro if nothing more intriguing is available either way I like this stout when I'm not in the mood for a chewy stout, this one is more drinkable no heavy thickness in the mouthfeel but still flavorful and has everything that makes stouts what they are."
"s.d."
"Cascading is cool, plain and simple. This beer is dark molasses black in color with a thick cream colored head. Quite beautiful. Its got the burnt malt and oatmeal smell, but its not quite as strong as other oatmeal stouts. This head isn't going anywhere, I wonder if I'll get a milk mustache when I drink it! Feels like it, but I don't wanna waste any, better lick my lips, yum. This beer is soo smooth. I'm not just talking about the feeling of those little nitrogen bubbles, the taste is smooth too. It tastes like a creamy stout, leaving just a bit of oatmeally goodness on the back of your tongue. For such a dark beer it's quite mellow, almost too mellow. I'm giving it high marks for drinknability because its easy drinking, but even more than that the laid back flavor has me drinking more and more so I don't loose the flavor. Oatmeal stouts are one of my favorite styles, and this one is up at the top."
"Overall Impression: Yum! Drink your Oatmeal! Good and good for you! A little dry for an oatmeal stout, but this dryness invites sip after sip. Deep flavor, but somewhat one-dimensional. Seemed a touch too flat, but I don’t expect a stout to sparkle. The filling aspect of this hearty beer slows drinkability; this is a meal. Had to work at finding things to take points from this beer. Recommended!"
"Notes: Enjoyed this a good deal, though wasn't entirely blown away."
"Very enjoyable."
"This was a verrrry smooth brew. It started with a nice creamy head on a base of chocolate brown to black. Chocolate and smoke were the flavors I could detect and the mouthfeel was exceptionally smooth. It left a slight linbger maltiness on the back of the palate that invited you to drink more. As I said before the went down verrrry smooth. A great offering from across the pond."
"Dark black color. Large head. Aroma is kind of weak, touch of roasted grains and coffee. A lighter to medium bodied stout. Malts are roasted, hints of coffee a touch sweet. Touch of spiciness. Fairly dry. Smooth taste. Nice drinkable stout. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is dry. Aftertaste is a very slightly bitter."
"This stout poured a very dark brown (almost black) with creamy, tan foam that was very long-lasting. The smell was mildly malty with a hint of fruitiness. The taste was sweet: caramel malt, cocoa, some banana, and some hoppy bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy with medium body and modest carbonation feel. Overall a nicely enjoyable stout."
"I'm really getting into the stouts, imperial stouts, and porters these days and this one from Young's was a real pleasant experience. I'll be looking for this one again."
"I can't say I am too impressed here. It's lacking in several key catagories and has some odd (off?) flavors to boot. I'll pass."
"If you like the style this is an easy to enjoy beer. For me, nothing about it stands up and shouts, but if you offer me one, I couldnt say 'No'."
"Had this on tap at the local pub. Pours a very dark color with a thick tan head that takes some time to dissipate. Nice aroma - chocolate, coffee, and malts are what I get from it. The flavor reminds me of burned malts and caramel. Fairly smooth and enjoyable. Mouthfeel was average and the drinkability was slightly above average. I see myself having this one again."
"Wonderful cascading creamy head of tiny, frothy bubbles. The head was only about a half an inch thick, but it stayed for quite a while. The lacing was always rather thick and stuck to the sides of the glass. The color was solid black and couldnt be seen through at all  even when held to the light. Aroma of fairly subdued malts. The mouthfeel was SO smooth and velvety, yet seemed to be a little on the thin side. Flavors of nice sweet malts with a dry and slightly roasty, bitter finish. Very slight carbonation on the tongue. This one seemed a little bland to me at first, but got better and better through the glass. By the end, I was wanting another."
"Obviously the feel was of the rich and creamy variety and left a very good impression. The drinkability is great, being a result of good taste, nice feel, and a relatively low alcohol content. I think I could drink this beauty for hours, not unlike that other great oatmeal stout from Samuel Smith."
"Half a liter bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep black color with two fingers of tan head. There is a little bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is rich in burnt chocolate malt, coffee, and caramel. It is a very sweet smell. The taste starts out with sweet toasted malt and a little bit of caramel and toffee. There is a bit of hops to the finish, not too much, just enough for balance. The mouthfeel is nice and thick, very smooth and heavy as well. The drinkability is also very good. A very nice representation of the style."
"Poured in the typical nitro can fashion black with a creamy head. Nothing exciting about the smell just a hint of dark malt and no hop smell. Tasted almost like a half fermented beer without the yeast. Hops arise but are there only for a second and disappear to sweetness. Mouthful was creamy and rich but drinkability suffers from the odd sweetness. Maybe if it were a little bitterer either from the use of hops, roasted malts, or barley I would enjoy this somewhat disappointing beer more."
"Overall: An excellent, drinkable oatmeal stout."
"Poured very dark, couldn't coax much of any kind of aroma out of it, the mellow chocolate taste made the biggest impression, along with the very smooth mouthfeel. It seemed to get less bitter at the end thenmost stouts of this kind. A great sipping alone brew."
"The original draft and bottled version of the Oatmeal Stout is quite a different animal than the nitro version. It's appearance is similar, with the body being black in color with brownish highlights at the base of the pint. But the head is darker tan, and it doesn't hold quite as well. The lacing is roughly the same, but the nitro version does win out in this category. And temperature comes into play as the bottled version needs to be served warmer (or allowed to warm once poured) before the head really comes up. And similarly, the bottles need to warm a bit before revealing their complete flavor, whereas the nitro version seems to loose some of it's crispness once warmed and is actually quite nice cold. The aroma offers the standard Young's fruitiness over a lightly caramel maltiness (and seems a bit more pronounced than the nitro version). The body is light; and it leaves a gentle tingle on the tongue with its moderate carbonation. The flavor delivers a lightly acidic (low pH from the dark malts), some yeasty fruitiness, a deep caramel malt, some delicate vanilla, a light chocolate note, a drying roastiness, and firm bitterness. It's flavors are more pronounced than in the nitrogenated version, and the bitterness appears a bit higher (although it's probably actually the very same beer!). The finish is dry, with a gently lingering bittersweet chocolate roastiness. This is an excellent example of how carbonation levels affect beer! I prefer the straight CO2 version as it brings out a bit more of the bitterness, and reveals it's full range of flavors; but the nitrogen version can also be quite pleasing at times. Well worth trying!"
"An astonishingly great stout. The head retention on this brew is simply amazing. As the DD, I only had the one beer last night, and I took plenty of time with it. But a half-inch layer of head remained atop my beer for the entire time period. Creamy, milky, vanilla sweet aromas. Very light roasted aromas buried underneath. Fluffy like a milkshake. Very light roasted finish that lingers just a bit. Spectacularly easy to drink -- full-bodied, yet creamy and not overbearing. Very nice."
"Very close to black with just a hint of brown, it pours with a thick tan head that goes away quickly. It smells of chocolate, a bit of roasted malt, and just detectable raisins. Although it's fairly complex, the taste is very mellow. This stuff is as smooth as the prom queen's thigh and goes down easy. Unfortunately, it's on the thin side."
"""Mellow"" I think defines this beer. There is nothing here to jangle or jar the senses. Just pure enjoyment."
"The beer pours a dark black color with a creamy tan head that lasts. The aroma is of roasted black barley and oats. The taste is smooth with a refreshingly crisp finish. There are flavors emitting from the darker malts and a destictive oatmeal mouthfeel and taste. The mouthfeel is good. This is a medium bodied beer that drinks well for a darker ale."
"Clever interplay of sweetness, burnt grain, dark chocolate, espresso, and raisins. Understated, with just enough hops to keep it honest."
"This one is silky smooth. Creamy and smooth. Complex and smooth. All of the flavors seem to mold into one great flavor. The hop bitterness seems to be lacking but that's ok because the malts are not overpowering. Oatmeal is noticed in the smell and again in the initial drink. Chocolate and coffee go hand in hand here. More sweetness maybe a dextrin sweetness comes into play. The sweetness is offset a bit by some oak flavors that dry it up a bit and make this one go down so easily. Finishes with a roasted barley flavor. Delicious."
"The flavor wasnt intense but seems like a solid drinking stout, and my wife's new favorite. They almost go back to easy."
"16.9 oz bottle. Pours a dark brown, with a massive head, that sticks around. Lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma of malt, coffee and a hint if chocolate. Taste is more of the same, creamy, sticky, smoothness, more like a meal. This is what I wish my oatmeal stouts could taste like. I could drink this all night!"
"This brew has a pleasant aroma. When poured, it yielded a small brown head of fine bubbles that lingered around for a long time. It's body is black as night and opaque. Very smooth taste. I found myself liking it very much. It is hard for me to describe. I can't pick out the words for the flavor, but I like it. It was a very nice smooth stout with no harsh for or aftertaste. It was extremely good."
"Pours with a rich tan head that towers above the very deep reddish-brown liquid for quite some time. The nose upon first pouring has a lush fruity quality that gives way to some metallic or even iron-like notes after a spell in the glass. Some very light roasty chocolates percolates behind all of that. The taste gives flavors of sweet malt, some liquorice, roastiness, chocolate with not very much of a hop presence at all. The mouthfeel is nice and rich...very smooth. The finish is silky and quite palatable, a very good drinking stout."
"It's a very fragrant beer, that's for damn sure. As far as whether I'd buy it again or not, I most likely will, but not in the near future, and probably not very frequently. It's pretty difficult to find a bad stout and Young's is just one of many. It's a face in the crowd, but a very comely one at that."
"A truly spectacular find. A new favorite of my and right up there on near the top of my list. Full flavor, full body oatmeal stout."
"This beer was a nice smooth beer. It was a dark, black color when it came to us with a nice head that left a lace all the way down the side of the glass. There was a mixed chocolate and coffee smell and a chocolate taste to this beer. I got this beer to get a free glass (Youngs Brewery) and I enjoyed the beer. They give a free glass away every week and rotate the brewery's at this place."
"the slow nitro pour produces a deep dark and just plain black as night hued brew. no light penetrating thia one. thick and rich cream coloured head. not much aroma to this beer...just some burnt malt. tastes sublime in it's gentleness. charred malt, ghost like suggestions of dark chocolate...some smokiness...almost too smooth and creamy from the nitro can, i'm thinking the it might be getting in the way of letting the flavours bloom. there are hints of coffee and kahlua, too. as it warms the flavours become more pronounced. the body is full and the mouthfeel silky smooth. really can't go wrong here for stout satisfaction. i'll have to try the bottle for the full flavoured effect. damn tasty and highly recommended."
"Young's oatmeal stout actually reminded me of a good porter. Relatively thin-bodied, nice taste. Very clean and smooth, more sweet than bitter. Exhibited that nice port-like taste that many good English beers have, but ultimately a little to thin and mild to be a great stout."
"Deep mahogany with slight tan head wich dissipates quickly and leaves only a faint and spotty lacing. Aroma is roasted malt with a faint hint of caramel and a slight hop presence. A little thin on the palate with a weakened malt flavor which finishes on the dry side. Overall a pretty average stout and not as nice as their Double Chocolate Stout which I found impressive."
"This is one absolutely smooth beer. Pours a deep brown, almost black color topped off by a very thick and creamy tan head. Head fades away ever-so-slowly, leaving a thin, sticky coating of lace on the glass. Nose is full of roasted oats, toffee, and mild nutty undertones. The taste is very similar to the aroma, mildly sweet and very delicious. The mouthfeel is total smoothness. I highly recommend this brew to any lover of fine stouts."
"This is a very dark, light impeding beer. It pours a nice thick tan head that clings to the side of the glass, refusing to go away. The aroma is a typical oatmeal stout that really doesn't prepare you for how good this brew really is. The flavor is complex, yet amazingly smooth and creamy. This beer feels like a beer should feel. The mouthfeel is absolutely amazing, and the taste is of a complex oatmeal stout, but somehow manages to be exceptionally smooth. This is one beer I will visit again, only next time, I'll be sure to invite more than one bottle."
"Just about jet black in color with an off-white nitro-induced head. Faint dusty aroma of chocolate and perhaps coffee. There's something a bit off in the aroma that I can't quite pin down. A bit thin in body, especially once the nitrogen dissipates. This doesn't bother me too much in a stout of this strength. The dark malt flavors of this stout lean towards dark chocolate and coffee in that order with a bit of a bitter finish. The finish is fairly long and tastes of chocolate tinged with heavily roasted coffee and finally hops A very smooth, drinkable oatmeal stout with medium long bitter finish. Not too bad."
"Still, an uplifting, happy stout!"
"The body is a bit thin on this one, and the flavor is lacking. The creamy mouthfeel is excellent, but I would really like some more flavor. Roasty malts with a bit of chocolate in small portions cover the basics, but I would like more. Not at all a bad stout, but it is definitely a weak one."
"F."
"Bottle served at the BC Beer Café in Helsinki. Beer is pitch black (okay, VERY dark brown), low to no head. There's some irritating carbonation that pricks on the tongue - if given the choice, I would most likely prefer some nitrogen in a beer of this style (I know that many of you will disagree with me on that!) Moderate roast aroma, the rounded flavour has some coffee notes with a strong oatmeal presence, hardly any bitterness to match the sweetness. Porridge aftertaste. Very filling - I had it 1 hour after a solid breakfast, and it was like having another full meal (""liquid oatmeal porridge""). Of course it's not a bad beer, but as my expectations were sky high, you'll have to forgive me for being a bit disappointed."
""
"Drinkability: The metallic taste hurt the drinkability for me."
"The mouthfeel is creamy and buttery, as expected. Quite enjoyable. However, something seems to be lacking in the complexity of this brew. I think when I hear the words ""oatmeal stout," I immediately think of a wonderfully dark, complex, delicious meal in a bottle (or nitro can). There are definitely flavors of chocolate, coffee, and roasted dark malts in this stout. Yet the body seems a tad thin, and I expected this to be a much more hearty brew, with stronger, more discernible flavors. I suppose I also can not help but compare this to Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout, in my mind, the king of all stouts. Young's is good, yet IMO is seriously lacking in comparison to many a stout I have had the pleasure to imbibe."
"Presentation. 16.9 ounce bottle, Best Before End Date FEB 03. Pours like motor oil struggling to get out of the bottle, black as night, thin foamy head, clinging in massive patches throughout. Initial smell is of bread and licorice, quite pleasant. Strong taste of caramel up front with a nice twang of smokiness left resting on the palate; followed by somewhat of a sweet barley sensation. My only comment is the label states a distinctive finish reminiscent of toast; just didn?t finish that way for me, still outstanding, a quite drinkable stout."
"This stout poured out a deep brown/black with a great tan head. I pour it aggressively to enjoy the head forming in the dark liquid. The aroma and taste both were good but not outstanding. The presense of malt dominated both. The mouthfeel was creamy and exellent. The feel of the beer covered the tongue and was the fullest of any beer I have had in quite some time. This is a classic oatmeal stout and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to understand what an oatmeal stout SHOULD taste like."
"Black in color with a faint brownish hue near the bottom of the pint. The nitro-induced head is full, very creamy appearance and tan in color. The head retention is excellent with very good lacing. The aroma provides a hint of fruitiness and caramel maltiness.The taste is noticeably smooth and silky mouthfeel which is primarily provided by the nitro-induced carbination. The flavor is of a delicate fruity, caramel malt with some distinctive vanilla overtones. A subtle milk chocolate matliness and an underlying hop bitterness is also apparent. The finish is soft, with an underlying bittersweet chocolate roastiness. Even with the artifically induced, nitro-carbonation, it may have smooth, soft mouthfeel, but appears a little thin in texture than other stouts. I still found it to be a very drinkable and enjoyable beer."
"Black in color , I can see through the glass when held up to the light, has a creamy tan head. Chocolate and light burnt coffee aromas. Dark roasty- sweet chocolate flavor, nice soft and creamy mouthfeel, it is a decent oatmeal stout, very drinkable."
"A bit of a disappointment; although it was smooth and drinkable, I need stout to have a bit of oomph in it. This dry brit seemed bored and distant, and I won't be seeing her again."
"I found this beer to be very drinkable and quite tasty. However, I think I was looking for more malty and oat flavors than what I found."
"Youngs Oatmeal Stout: in the half liter brown bottle. Great looking black beer, tan head with a tremendous amount of staying power. Very light chocolate aroma, but noticeable. Taste is very nice, mouthfeel is smooth, and it seems easy to drink. What’s the problem then? Well it’s a good oatmeal stout, very much middle of the road, but there is lots better. Average."
"This is a good beer, but not my favorite oatmeal stout. I find both Samuel Smith and St. Ambroise more interesting, more full-bodied and just plain better tasting."
"Best Before: 05/03 Tasted: 01/26/03"
"Nice and creamy, but nothing special. Pours out black with a decent head. Real smooth and actually quite tastey. Mmmmmm oatmeal stout! This is a good beer, but there are better oatmeal stouts on the market. Magic Hat Heart Of Darkness is my favorite of the style."
"Pours a black ruby color with a thick and creamy tan colored head that eventually fades into a heavy and sticky lace. Nose is sweet roasted malts, dark coffee, smoked wood, and licorice. Very smooth and creamy in the mouth with tastes of bitter chocolate, smoky charcoal, burnt coffee, and a touch of vanilla. Very little hop presence. A nice oatmeal stout, but nothing special."
"Oatmeal stouts are just plain good. Its like a meal and a drink all in one. This one is a bit thin compared to Rogue's Shakespeare, but is still quite good. Pours out to an almost black color in the glass with a very, quickly disappearing head. Taste is quite good, with a slight ""oatmeal"" sweetness and a decent roasted malt presence followed by a light dose of hops. Very drinkable."
"I found this stout to be a little bland compared to other oatmeal stouts I have tried recently. Maybe my tastebuds are just shot. I really like it overall though, the appearance is wonderfully dark, and I could definitely enjoy many in a row. I guess I just compare too many stouts to Sammy Smith's."
"(Please be gentle, this is my 1st review!)"
"I tasted no sweet oatmeal. I too prefer the double chocolate stout and am distraught that I cannot buy it in Japan."
"Deep, dark brown, almost black with ruby highlights when held to light. The head is light brown and leaves a bit of lacing down the glass. There are roast malt aromas, with hints of coffee. In the flavor is a slight creaminess, with roast and coffee flavors. The bitterness is evident, but subdued by the malt flavors. A bit of warmth from the alcohol is also present. It is a smooth brew, but not like other Oatmeal stouts I have sampled. It is full-bodied, but the mouth-feel still seems a bit thin. Overall, a good beer, I would sample this one again."
"This stout from Young's was a slight disappointment for me. It was a fine brew but lacked a certain fullness that one looks for in this sort of beer. The bitterness was ample with tasty burnt flavors. The middle on the palate taste seemed weak. While it was a decent brew I much preferred the double chocolate version."
"This oatmeal stout pours just about perfectly, with a smooth creamy head from the nitro widget. It is a coal black beer, and topped with the neautiful atn head that doen not subside, it is nearly picture perfect. The aroma seems to suffer slightly in my experience with nitro cans, and this one reveals a faint malt aroma topped with a hint of hops and chocolate, but no more. The beer tastes terrific, with a smooth chocolate flavor atop a strong roasted malt base. The hops are well balanced and round out the flavor profile wonderfully. This has a very clean finish for a stout, almost too clean. Not much of the roasty flavor is left in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is very smooth and refreshing for a stout, but lacks the chewiness many stouts present. This leads to a very superb drinkability, but not quite as much a memorable experience as many other stouts. A very good stout that may be the smoothest drinking example on the planet. Give me a sixer of these any day!"
"The nose on Youngs Oatmeal Stout is faint licorice, vanilla, and coco; tasty roasted malt and sweet oatmeal. The flavors were lovely with roasted malts meshing with sweet oatmeal, licorice, vanilla, and very faint charred wood. Creamy and smooth mouthfeel, filling yet soft; finishes somewhat dry. The tan head was lacking the dark brown body was ideal. Its drinkable to a fault; tasty this is an outstanding Stout, its a real winner!"
"Peace, Love, and BEER"
"Pours a uniformly dark tone with dark currant hints at the bottom of the glass.  Fine, bronze head disapears rather quickly with minimal lace.  First smell reminded me of merlot with its rich fruitiness.  As the beer warmed, tones of chocolate and roasted grain were more prominent.  Taste is smooth and surprisingly crisp--a traditional stout profile with less of the creamy fullness one often gets.  That quality lends this beer a very nice mouthfeel and good drinkability."
"Pale brown head. Pretty sweet aromas of oatmeal cookies, peanut butter cookies, macaroons, cigar smoke, and biscuits. Not so much creamy as it is silky and pliant. Nicely articulated coffee extract and Mediterranean spices on the finish. A great food/session beer."
"Roasted oats; cocoa sweet malts.  Fuggles and Goldings hops make for an intriguing elliptical balancing.  Certainly, the malts are more assertive as would be expected, but this beer would be simple without the select hops to create subtle complexities.  Soft burt persimmon dryness in the finish.  Incredibly smooth and palatable.  An intersting mix of nutty and fruity aromas.  A fantastic stout.  (for future reference; please dont sample this cold)"
"A deep dark pour, almost black, with a nice tan head in the beginning, that fades slowly. A little lace, but not much. The smell of chocolate is predominate, over roasted malt, coffee, maybe a little toffee, or caramel? A little more bite than the double chocolate, creamy, but with a lightly noticeable hop finish. I've been on a stout kick lately, and this is a good one."
"I'll admit that I am a young beer advocate and have not yet much explored the world of stouts, but this seems to be a great start. I really enjoyed this beer from the very first sip. Wonderful color. It's very dark and full bodied. Its smooth and hearty. Of course I have no prior frame of reference but this seems to be an excellant oatmeal stout. I might even have to replace my usual bowl of oatmeal for breakfast with this. Just kidding."
"Extremely dark, no light come through it at all. Dense tan head and generous lace rings. Roasted aroma with hints of coffee, chocalate, caramel, and vanilla. Wow! Very smooth and creamy. Rich malt taste along and finishes with a coffee flavor. Excellent mouthfeel and not too heavy. More drinkable then some other stouts. A solid brew."
"This poured a lovely dark, dark brown and held the head for a nice long time (not that long - drank it rather quickly). It's beyond me how this can be such a sweet taste yet have that hops bitterness that I adore. Each sip brought out a different nuance - caramel, coffee... Just pure yummy."
"Who wants a nasty dry stout when you have deleicious (and nutritious?) oatmeal?  A solid oatmeal stout.  Cheers!"
"Superb!  I can consume my weight in this stuff...just don't ask me any questions that require logic after I do it.  This brew pours a dark coffee color with a full 3 finger head that hangs in there quite nicely.  The smell is that of a hoppy beer althought the hops are balanced superbly in the taste.  Possibly hints of slight coffee tones and creamy throughout the taste and the mouthfeel.  Did I mention that this is good stuff?  CHEERS, dudes!"
"Notes: A top notch oatmeal stout, not so heavy to take away from the drinkability and does not lack in flavour or complexity. One of my favourite beers from Young’s and one I frequent when I am looking for a full flavoured stout."
"A very satisfying and robust stout.  The aroma is the forst thing that grabs me...a very roasty-malty kind of thing.  Thsi si a good knife-and-fork beer - the beer that drinks like a meal.  One of the best British stouts I have tried!"
"Pours very dark brown/black with thick tan head. Rich dark malt give a pleasant roasted smokey aroma.  Taste is full and rich with a slightly toasted taste, almost burnt, but not in a negative way.  Nicely bitter with a full alcohol flavor.  Finishes slightly dry and mouth biting."
"Solidly good beer, but not exceptional.  Pours nearly black with a medium, tan-colored head.  Head quickly fades.  It's well balanced with medium body.  Roasted malts stand out in flavor, with hints of sweetness."
"Okay, the color is very dark, with a slight maroon hue.  The head is a medium tan color.  The body is lighter than I prefer on this style.  I like the taste, but still doesn't beat Samuel Smith or more my local favorite Barley's.  Worth checking out, though."
"Deep ruby-brown color with a faint malt nose and dry malt flavor. Just a touch of smoke in the finish."
"This beer is an incredible pour, lots of head due to the nitro  device in the can.  The head is a thick and creamy off white that threatened to escape a long pint glass when poured, with perhaps half a centimeter remaining after a few minutes and lots of thick lace.  The color is a brown so deep that it appears to be black.  The aroma is very pleasant, rather sweet, the oatmeal very prominent, fruit and roasted barley less so.  Very smooth taste with lots of roasted barley initially and then the oats, slight hoppiness and a mild bitterness from the barley at the finish.  This beer has a wonderful mouth feel, as creamy and smooth as milk, a fine beer."
"Black in color.  Thick and creamy head. Mild roasted grain aroma.   Medium sweet and medium dry with the complexity of dark roasted grains.  Medium hop bitterness very well balanced with the malt.  A hint of nuttiness.  I am not a fan of the nitro widget.  A little thin and lack-luster flavor but still a good beer and I really enjoyed the ones that I had."
"Not the best stout, but its got some characeter, but a bit creamy on tap, which is the only way i've sample this beer, still nice, but not the best, nice roastiness, decent."
"after about a year of drinking ""real beers"" now and reading the reviews here, this is my first review. Please be patient. I love the appearence of this beer, the deep dark color and the nice tan foamy head make for an inviting glass. The smell wasn't that impressive, but then again, not offensive. I really like the taste, very rich and smooth (just like the can says) but I expected a little more oatmeal taste and sweetness. Which is why I gave it only a 4.0 in the mouthfeel. Overall, I think it is a very good and very drinkable beer ! Very rich, nice lace falling down the side of the glass. After 12 hours of work today, I was thinking about this beer for at least 8 hours and it didn't let me down, however I think the Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout has a better oatmeal malt flavor. The only thing lacking is the slightly thinner feeling and taste than the Samuel Smith version, which is the only other one I can compare it to. I will drink it again."
"A nice beer.  Pours a very dark brown with a decent head that doesn't stay that long.  Roasted barley and oatmeal in the nose.  Smooth oatmeal with a little less roasted barley on the tongue.  A nicely balanced beer.  Not really any perceptable bitterness but enough so that you aren't complaining of too much sweetness.  Smooth and creamy in your mouth and somewhat drinkable.  I like this beer.  It isn't exactly one of my favorites but I like to grab a bottle or draught can every now and then."
"Thick initial head dissapates into a thin but creamy tan head that leaves Belgian lace until the last sip.  Almost black in color with just a tinge of brown when held to light.  Slight chocolate malt and roasted barley aroma is discernible, but that awesome Young's fruity, estery nose from the yeast strain actually dominates.  Roasted barley character dominates initially, then is followed by a silky smoothness from oats.  Could use a touch more malt complexity and body.  Hop bitterness is only a foundation and is not in the forefront.  The brew finishes with roasted barley bitterness on the tongue like many stouts do.  As with most of Young's brews the drinkablility is unsurpassed.  Although this is certainly an above average oatmeal stout, I was expecting a bit more from this fine Brewery. It's a notch or two below fresh Samuel Smith's OS. Still better than the majority of American microbrewed oatmeal stouts, however."
"Review from a 14.9 oz nitro can...agree that the aroma is even influenced by oatmeal...very creamy, cascades downward in the pint glass for a long time.  Very pleasant body and mouthfeel and a not-too-sweet but discernably choco-malt mid taste flavor.  Enjoyed..."
"Overall pretty good stuff! Had this at nice hangout called the Black Sheep here in Philly."
"I understand that in London, you're either a Fuller's guy or a Young's guy.  I guess I'm a Fuller's guy.  This is not a bad stout, but it just seems rather thin.  It pours a nice tan head, it has a great dark, almost black color, but the smell and flavor are a bit light.  If I'm going to drink a Young's stout, I'll have their Double Chocolate Stout."
"Smooth as silk. Superb oatmeal stout."
"Full bodied but does not weigh you down like a ton of bricks.  The sweetness of the malt is well balanced.  I usually think of an oatmeal stout as a beer for winter, but this is a good year-round brew."
"The best bottled beer I have ever had. The only beer better is Young's bitter cask conditioned in a London pub. If you love a stout that is smooth and utterly drinkable, than try this exceptional beer.  Highest rating!!!"
