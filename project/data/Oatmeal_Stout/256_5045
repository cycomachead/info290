3.98,3.6,4,4,4,3.75,4,"8 Ball poured a very deep brown colour verging on black, with about 1/2"" of creamy tan coloured head produced. The head faded to a thin cap of foam after 3 minutes, and left considerable spotting and some modest lacing all down the glass. Its aroma was of dark coffee, dark European chocolate and earthy/herbal hops. 8 Ball's taste very much followed the aroma, with the addition of a certain sweetness which gave way to a mildly bitter dark coffee finish and aftertaste. As the beer warmed there was a bit of booze in the finish...which was surprising given its 5.8% alcohol content, but by no means unpleasant. The only weakness of this beer was its slightly thin mouthfeel, which contrasted noticeable with the creaminess of the head. Carbonation level was moderate, fully in keeping with the style. Overall this is a solid, flavourful stout and not overly hoppy in the finish...well worth a try. Currently selling for $4.80 per 650 ml bottle.","BuckyBeerBeaver","Apr 06, 2014"

4.09,6.5,4,4.25,4,4.25,4,"Poured from the bottle into a shaker pint glass. Impressively dark and opaque, pitch black with just the barest hint of a red halo at the bottom of the glass. Aroma is surprisingly sweet, I get considerable caramel initially and then the more expected dark roast coffee and milk chocolate notes, along with a sour fruitiness that couples with the dark malts to yield a pomegranate molasses effect. Smells pretty fantastic if not a bit sweet for the style. No real hop aroma. Tastes similarly sweet and rich, with some diacetyl apparent and an ultra-smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Quite chewy but not heavy and very drinkable, with considerable residual sugars noted and moderate to high carbonation. Very nice tactile translation of the oatmeal stout style characteristics, although less dry and earthy than some (e.g., Rogue Shakespeare Stout, Samuel Smith's iconic example). The main flavors seem to be coffee with a little cream, light chocolate, butterscotch, and the tiniest tinge of dry ash. The booze is very well-concealed. Finish is roasty and sweet but here some floral earthy hops become apparent, cutting the sweetness and providing a contrast to the main show. I like this a lot, has some sweet stout character and the oats really do add an amazing smoothness. Then again, I have a soft spot for the sweeter side of dark malt and others may prefer something more dry.","CalgaryFMC","Mar 18, 2014"

Taste of toasted malts and faint hints of chocolate. A super smooth stout, one of the lightest oatmeal stouts I have tasted, very drinkable. We finally got some rain here in San Diego and I went with this brew for our ""cold"" weather stint we have going over here. Lost Coast keeps it pretty simple and straightforward, this isnt the most complex beer out there, but its still damn good in its simplicity.","theteleman","0"

Hop character could be more interesting and forward I thought, and sometimes they struggled to cut the sweet chocolate notes, but this resolved itself. I think this is definitely worth a try for a well-made stout, not the most interesting stylistically, but it does drink quite nicely, and is certainly well above-average. 4","mick303","Nov 04, 2013"

The taste brings in more of the same, with a bit more roast character, the addition of dark chocolate (which goes pretty well with the already-present cocoa powder), and without the charcoal, making for a slightly less complex but nevertheless tasty stout. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mostly smooth feel. Overall, a very nice stout.

4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a pint glass. The 12 oz bottle has a big 8 Ball on it, which I'll admit was the reason I bought it. The beer comes out of the bottle as a very dark brown liquid with a large head of tan bubbles, ranging in size from big to tiny. It beer smells chocolaty-sweet, and a bit powdery, like chocolate milk or hot chocolate mix. I can also detect the aroma of alcohol and dark roasted malts. The flavor includes notes of chocolate, both milk and dark, but I certainly wouldn't call it a chocolate stout. It's more noticeable as hints of sweetness and bitterness as opposed to actual cocoa flavors. The bitterness and alcohol are strongest as I swallow and both linger on. The malts have a slightly burnt quality to them; it's not quite roasted but nor is it outright charred. The body is on the lighter side of medium and is slightly creamy. Carbonation is low. A coating is left behind, but it isn't too significant. Some stickiness remains on my lips. Overall, it is a very drinkable stout. I could easily have a few rounds of this beer, especially with some burgers or steak. It would even go well with dessert! It's too bad this is the only bottle I have; if I ever get a chance, I certainly order this one again.","ToasterChef","Sep 02, 2010"

More toast than roast in the nose, carob, mocha, milk chocolate chips, cookie batter, licorice before a brush of minerally earthiness, the hops present a pinch of pine sap and mixed white citrus, nothing major, fruit scents close to nonexistent. Medium-bodied, muscular and sets itself firmly in the mouth, the carbonation fine but persistent, keeps things on the straight and narrow from start to finish. More of a roast here, blending in coffee and dark chocolate with carob and molasses. Floral dimension spreads wider. This may spark the plum, cherry fruit some.

4.13,7.6,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Picked this brew up along with a few other things from Lost Coast this weekend. After my first try of one of their brews I was not sure what to expect with this Stout. This brew poured to a deep black color with a thick frothy light tan head that had great retention while leaving a lot of lacing, the look of this brew is good. The aroma here is nice, coffee comes immediately to my mind. Also there is a nice roasted to slightly burnt malt aroma there and a slight hop presence. The flavor is very nice, this is one easy drinking brew. The coffee and chocolate notes from the malt are very inviting. The astringency and slight smokiness is very light and serves this beer well. Somewhat sweet flavor that goes well with the slight hop end. Now I really like the flavor here but do think if it is based on a American Stout there would be a larger hop presence at the end but I am unsure on the age of this brew. While I do not feel that most people would think that this brew is complex it has the flavors that I really hit the mark for me as a stout.

3.31,-13.8,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,"12 oz. stubby... brewed with pale malted barley, chocolate and roasted malts, oatmeal, and Pac NW hops. It appears jet-black with medium carbonation, and an inch of yellowed-cocoa head that delivers nice lacing. The bouquet is roasted, chocolatey, and hoppy, but is a bit subdued. Not too flavorful when cold, but as it warms it reveals notes of citric hops, backed by charred and chocolate malts, hints of coffee and dark fruits. However, it is a bit watery and seems fully attenuated - needs a bit of sweetness for balance. The body is light - too thin for the style I feel - with high carbonation, quite dry, and imparts a medium finish. Overall it's not too bad, but is a bit rough around the edges and almost harsh when served cold.","mmmbeer","Jan 06, 2008"

Missing some of that big creamy cap that I see with other stouts. A big sniff presents brown sugar, molasses, a touch of butterscotch, and a tad of bittersweet chocolate. Though I am no stout pro by any means, it strikes me as a bit of a departure. First sip: right off, I get some of that brown sugar and toffee-like characteristics, but the middle is a strong fruitiness, some berry and (am I crazy, here) some raisin? Finishes with a quick slap of liquorice and the faintist hint of chocolate. I'm stumped, honestly. It seems to have more in common with a dubbel or quad than a stout. All of the quintessential things I would look for are absent. And then to compound the crime, it resembles a Belgian, but not a very good one either. Body is medium, with not much in the way of carbonation or hoppy tingle. A bad bottle, maybe? I can't tell. But I am very much underwhelmed.","0tt0","Jul 15, 2007"

A sweet malted milkball meets bitter orange flavor at the finish -- absolutely delicious. Oatmeal adds a silken texture to this medium-bodied and velvety smooth stout.

The flavor reflected the aromas extremely well. The coffee morphed into more of an espresso character, and the cherry. chocolate really came out well.

It's black as can be, with a decent-sized head of deep tan that fades shortly to a wide collar, but leaves little lace. The nose is more roasty than anything else (think spent espresso grounds), but there are hints of caramel there as well. Surprisingly, it's quite smooth across the tongue with a medium and somewhat dextrinous body and a fine, restrained carbonation. The flavor is very much like the aroma.... straightforward. It's not complex at all, but there are some notes of yeasty fruitiness, molasses, dark cocoa, coffee, low-key citrusy hops, and alcohol as well (not that alcohol has flavor, but its presence is noticeable). The bitterness is nicely balanced and lends towards a dry finish, but it's really the combination of bitterness and roastiness that gets it there. And then it simply disappears from the palate. But everything in life is a trade-off, and here we pick up a great drinkability in the deal. The 8 Balls is a smooth, drinkable, and satisfying stout that probably deserves more credit than it gets because it doesn't go over the top! Nicely done!","NeroFiddled","Mar 16, 2005"

It gets even more obvious in mouth, I figure on some days, I would call it vegetal, a blend of the almost husky malt, coffee beans and the greenish hops, today it just feels beany, roasty and milky.

Lots of smoke flavor with the roasted malts, with a bit of caramel and chocolate backing them up. Also the cascade hops even comes through a slight bit leaving a bitter finish. The carbonation hits the tongue quickly but then subsides with the lighter body of this brew. The alcohol is present on my tongue after the swallow, but not much warming with this one.

Full blown aromas of expertly toasted dark malts, English toffee, chocolate-covered raisens, and bitter coffee.

On the bitter side for a stout. Mainly bitter chocolate flavor, with a bit of vegetably? note.

This pours out a pitch-black color with a thick dark tan head of about three fingers height, a picture perfect stout. The head recedes fairly quickly to a cap of bubbles leaving scattered lacing around the glass. Smells of roasted coffee and chocolate malt rise from the glass with a bit of sweetness to it as well, very pleasing smell indeed. Taste is heavy with a roasted coffee flavor jumping out with bittersweet dark chocolate playing a big role as well. The finish is dry and quite bitter with a lingering coffee flavor and slight earthy hoppiness to it. Very well balanced with the sweetness not being over done and the bitterness being very present. Medium to full body this brew has a creamy mouthfeel that makes every sip enjoyable. A surprisingly good stout that is up there on my favorite stouts list, highly recommend.","meathookjones","Aug 08, 2004"

The aroma was very roasty and bread-like with a hint of sweetness - pleasant. The taste is strong and complex, very strong maltiniess at first and a finish with the standard trio of carmel/chocolate/coffee notes. I was impressed with the feel of aftertaste, as I found it to be velvety smooth and buttery - very nice. The syrupy texture is surprisingly light on the tongue, enough so that I found it to be slightly lacking in mouthfeel and a bit thin for my taste.

Smell is a pleasant blend of traditional roasted cocoa- and coffee-like notes that are lightened by a hoppy twang. That twang carries over to the taste, which is lighter than a typical stout. Roasted flavors are muted but form a nice foundation. Mouthfeel similarly is lighter than expected, though this makes for a stout that goes down easier than most.","BitteBier","Feb 27, 2004"

Theres a sweet and roasted nut-like presence in this beer. The roasted grains taste like they are overdone here  tastes a bit burnt, with a harsh alcohol bite in the finish. This beer is hard to drink. Its too over the top, without any real mellow smoothness. Its strong, rich and bold. Some others would probably like it a bit more than me.","pezoids","Feb 11, 2004"

Very chocolatey with heaps of oatmeal. A bit of prune kicks in at the finish, yielding to a lovely roasty aftertaste. Not a lot of hops to the finish here, but not at all cloying. Still, the hops might help to soften the alcohol flavor which, as it stands, becomes just a bit too strong for my taste at the finish. Still, damn drinkable and quite a surprise for me.

It has a dry roasted flavor to it with some chocolate notes. It is a bit thicker than the stouts I've had recently, which is a good thing...a very good thing.

My eyes twinkle with the anticipation. The beer pours black and oily. It eerily makes no sound and kicks up a chocolate cream that laces the sides of the glass perfectly. The aroma is rich with milk chocolate and charcoal. The hops are reserved in this one, but they're there, lurking, giving the burned barley bitterness a little support.

While there is no coffee to be found in here, it could be compared to a nice dark roast cup of coffee like the ones I have had in the Yukon in Canada as opposed to your typical (U.S.) mass market brewed coffee.

The 8 ball pours out black as its namesake, dark as a mooness night topped with a nice mahogany head. Smells abundantly of dark roasted coffee and malt, none of the tangy sweetness or hints of alcohol that you often find in some other big stouts. Taste is very full and roasty, like my favorite black coffee, with just a little bit of bitterness hinting of hops and bringing it to a nice crisp finish.
