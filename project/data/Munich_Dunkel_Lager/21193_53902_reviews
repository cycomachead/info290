"Maybe my opinion isn't important, but not much of a fan of dunkels. This one didn't stand out."

""

""
"Overall: A tasty beer, I'm a big fan of this style and enjoy the german varieties very much. This doesn't exactly stand up to its german counterparts but If I was in the mood for a dunkel and this was on tap I would not pass it up. Drinkability begs for a liter mug."

"I would absolutely drink this again, but I had to knock it down for the slight flatness of this pour.  Again, that may be because of the local tap.   I will amend this review if I that turns out to be the case."

"O: Not an amazing beer, but a good one to pair with food thanks to its easygoing nature. I'll probably return to this one again, just not on a frequent basis."
""
"O - It is a good representation of the style. I enjoyed the cocoa aspect of this beer. The skunked metallic flavor was not my favorite."
""
""
""
"Peace!"
""

"Poured on-tap at the brewery and served in a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, chestnut coloring with a filmy, clingy, white head. Nose of roast notes, coffee, and dark caramel, and some fig and date notes. Flavors are roast and nutty forward, with some old world fruit sweet highlights, and a bitter undertone. Smooth and crisp bodied, with a tangy caramel sweetness and roasted notes. Crisp, clean finish, with a sweet linger. Very solid brew!"
""
""
"It's not bad but the super spritzy mouthfeel just slices through the palate and destroys much of the flavor that seemed to be hinted on the nose."
"One of my favorite beers to date. Outstanding lager. I don't know a whole lot about Mother Earth Brewing but I know that this beer alone has made me interested in their other stuff."

"Dark Cloud pours into a ruby color with significant lacing. It's smell is a complex blend of coffee, toffee, and malts, amongst others. The taste is bready, chocolatey, and a little malty with a late rush of toffee sweetness. Honestly, it's difficult to even detect any hoppy bitterness. It feels very well-balanced and medium-bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. A very drinkable and sessionable lager but far more complex than that designation might suggest. An awesome achievement for a Carolina brewery."

"Drinkability: This is solid stuff. It likely sets the bar for the boldest versions of the style, at least as far as I have experienced."

"O: This beer is quite easy to drink but offers some complex flavors from the Munich malts and noble hops."

"D - A little dull for me, but a nice session."
""
""
""
"O: I was pleasantly surprised to find this excellent example of a Munich Dunkel Lager being produced by a small brewery in Eastern NC - not one of the more common styles for American craft breweries. This was a delicious beer and one I was very happy to drink - it is sessionable and I would be happy to have another of these."
"O - Pretty good beer, but nothing to flip out about. Maybe this beer just isn't my style, because this is the second I've had of this type that wasn't memorable. Enjoyable, nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Easy drinking and highly approachable, it's a solid dunkel."

"---"
"First time drinking a dunkel lager, this is a smooth and easy drinking beer."
""
""
"O-Overall, this was an enjoyable session beer that can be enjoyed in quanity. The beer was fresh and free of defects."
"These folks seem to take real pride in their beer, all the way from the label art through to the clean flavors and tight adherence to style."
""
""
"Nice chestnut color. Off white somewhat tan head on top. Caramel sweet and nutty aroma. Very solid maly flavor upfront with a nice hop presence. Hop bite is even right thru the finish. Nice balance of malt to really even the whole thing out. Solid mouthfeel. Very strong example of a dunkel in my book. I look forward to trying other beers from these folks."
""
""
""
"An excellent accompanyment for food or slightly higher than average abv as a session beer."
""
""
"Overall an impressive roasty brew. Sweet, bitter and quite malty, it had it all going on..."
""
""
""
"Beer is oaky brown with 3/4"" orange tinted white head, hazy with a slight ruby glow. A pretty beer. Aroma is lightly sweet...kind of straight up dunkel smell. Malty chocolate, earthy hops, some lemon perhaps. Taste matches with a bit of tartness. Bitterness has a solid presence but is not overwhelming. This beer does get better as it warms up which frequently is the case with most beers I like, though not always with layers. Body is medium-light and this goes down very easy."
""
"Overall, nothing Earth-shattering, but very well executed. Like a great 12-bar blues."
"Not bad at all, a bit boring and a bit dry for me. Pleasant and smooth with light chocolate notes and perfectly hopped. No lager yeast smell or taste."
""
"O - Glad to have tried something from Mother Earth. Solid showing of a less common style."
"A woody bitterness flashes across the tongue then disappears just as fast. Not as slick and sweet as the German incarnations, but still very good in its own right."
""
"Strong, malty aroma is slightly musky and has earthy, molasses and nutty notes. It pours a somewhat translucent sepia with a fairly thick, if not persistent, wheat-brown head that leaves considerable lacing. Rich flavor has a malty core and caramel, earthy, nutty and molasses notes. Firm-bodied texture is smooth yet rather tingly, leaving an earthy, woody finish. Eminently drinkable and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty solid, well rounded beer. For the style this is all around right."
""
"Quite a tasty beer. The toasted malts in the smell are a little funny, but everything else about it is solid. I like it."
""
"For me, this is a solid B+ Munich Dunkel. Keep on representing Tar Heel Brewers !!"
""
""
""
""
"O - A very good beer that is worth grabbing. Wish it were available up here. Well done."
" recreating a Munich Dunkel Lager!"
"O - one of the best of style, in my experience."
"Cheers!"
"This beer is hard to characterize for me. I have been on a dark beer kick lately and I thought maybe this might be fun to try, since it's a local company. Overall, this beer looked and tasted just fine. I probably wouldn't go far beyond that. I think it rates in the ""B" area for me. I think it's a pretty decent beer for the style, and I wouldn't tell people not to try it."
"O: A pretty good beer. There are solid flavors here and much to be appreciated but it remains delicate and extremely easy to drink and enjoy. A great and very refreshing lager."
"O: You don't often see a Dunkel as part of a US brewery's regular line-up, let alone a well done one. Solid beer."
"o - Overall a pretty decent beer, a slightly above average dunkel. Lots of roasted and bready qualities, would give it another shot."
"I have drank dunkels fresh on tap in Bavaria a few times and I can say this beer is very faithful and accurate to the style if that is your bag. Might not beat your favorite German dunkel, but if you aren't one of those irrationally biased pseudo-culture fans of all things European, than you ought to really dig where this dunkel is coming from."
"O: Overall this is pretty straight to this style nothing is going to blow you away but a very straight example of the style."
"Husky, toasty nose with hints of chocolate and apple sweetness. Grassy hops with an herbal twist that nip, but don't bite too hard. Very nice balance on this. Toasty malts with a just-right amount of cocoa. Robust but not heavy, an exceedingly easy-drinking brew. It's easy to picture putting away a few of these with some sausages or pretzels."
"This was an ok beer. If they lower the carbonation and try to make it more aromatic, it would be near perfect."
"Mouthfeel is very good and overall this is a quality beer."
"D: Not a bad beer.... Looks great, smells good, mouthfeel good... taste starts good finishes OK...."
"all this being said...i have been sitting on this beer for the better part of a year so very well might be past its prime?"
"THAT was a close call. word"
"7.0/10"
"Overall: A very nice example of a rarely brewed style; not in the top echelon but close"
"O - Solid take on a Dunkel Lager, I could probably have a few of these in a sitting."
"O- nice beer and everything works good together. Nice extra beer."
"Tastes pretty good, one of the best American brewed dunkels I have ever had. I wish more breweries stateside would brew this underrated style. Has a nice sweet/roast interplay and the body is plenty full. Very smooth beer that goes down so easy. Drinkability is through the roof, this would be a great beer to take to a party and cache out a sixer over a couple hours."
"O: A really good low abv beer. Again, a beer you'd expect to be higher in alcohol based on the flavor profile and mouthfeel. Mother Earth did a really nice job with this one."
"O: A good example of its type. Dunkel lagers are rarely offensive. Sitting out by the bay in Currituck… sunset…beer, yeah nice."
"Overall a very nice dunkel and very drinkable."
"O- A very solid dunkel. Lots of chocolate flavor and just all around a solid drinking beer."
"O: Overall, a pretty decent dunkel lager. I could easily put several of these back on a warm day in the sun."
"Very creamy and pleasant to drink."
"From the bottle to the pint glass...pours dark brown with a thick tan head. Lacing is nice. Nose is light yeast and that's all - a little disappointing. Taste is malt - probably munich - mild tones of dark fruit and roast, with a slightly hoppy finish. Very easy to drink. A decent, but not great dunkel."
"Really liking Mother Earth. This beer pours Coca-cola color with a nice white head. Smells of malt, maybe roasted peanuts. The taste is very nice, coffee, maybe some spices, great body and really easy to throw back. If this was available near me I would drink it all the time. Great session beer. Easy to drink but still complex. Mother Earth does it for me again."
"A nice beer that, when encountered, I won't dodge.."
"D- goes down easy and would be nice with a steak dinner. The low abv allows one to have a few and not get tanked. it is very tasty."
"Nothing wrong with this beer, but nothing great either. Which is exactly what I am looking for in this style. Good malty pleasure without going through a workout to finish it. Maybe a touch too buttery, though."
"D: Pretty good in general. Though there is a bit of an odd flavor in the finish. Still.. enjoyable."
"Strangely, with every other taste i go back and forth on being a fan and questioning if i would get it again. Final decision was i would drink it again."
"We can think of only warm pretzels and liter mugs of this beer. N.C. craft brewing flexing its muscles here."
"Pours a very dark brown with a thin head. Lots of roasted nut flavors in this one. A bit of chocolate flavor too. This beer tastes very lightly sweet and lightly bitter. Very slightly sweet and lightly bitter. A sniff of this beer fills the nose with roasty aromas."
"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured dark brown with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earthy note, wheat, and corn. The flavor was of sweet malt, earthy notes, nutmeg, and wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with low-mild carbonation. Overall this wasn't that bad, but it also wasn't that great. The aroma on this one was not that great, but the flavor was decent. Just not a fan of the wheat flavor unless it is in a Hefe personally. Not sure if I would have this one while out again or not..."
"I poured this beer into a frosted mug and it came put with a solid head on it of a deep cream color. The head stayed around for a while in the form of a very thin layer. The color of this beer is mahogany. The smell, well I had to only give this a 3 because my nose is plugged and I can't smell so I dont necessarily want to just throw a number out there. The mouthfeel is great not overly carbonated and goes down smooth. The taste is a little stronger then what I like but it is still a tasty beverage. Overall great buy and would recommend!"
"Ruby brown. Khaki colored head with good retention. Toasted grain. Toffee. Chocolate. Caramel. Touches of fruit underneath along with earthy hops. Flavor brings a nice balance of sweet, toasty, and bitter. Chocolate, toffee, caramel, fruit, toasted grain, hops. Wonderfully balanced. If anything, a tad more carbonation could do this wonders. An excellent brew from Mother Earth. I really like their portfolio in terms of styles. The quality isn't lacking either."
"drinkability: good"
"Dark red/caramel in color, large head with fine bubbles which is retained well. Slight roasted flavor finishing sweet with balanced hop flavor and slight hint of alcohol. Could easily drink a few in a row! A friend was kind enough to bring me 13 different Brews from North Carolina he got while in Asheville."
"Had the great opportunity to try this at the Charleston Beer Exchange. The brewer came in and gave out samples, because they might work on distributing into South Carolina next year. After sampling the beers he had, especially the barrel aged Tripel Overhead, I sure hope they can make it work. Anyway, this was a nice version of the Munich Dunkel. It was light in body, but dark in color, and had a pleasant coffee/chocolate taste. Along with the nice taste, it had a good nutty/malty/chocolate smell, with a slight hop undertone. Very easy to drink, because I do like the maltier beers, and it's even better when they don't have you feeling bloated."
"Thanks to BucketBoy for the opportunity to try this one. 12oz. bottle served in my Weihenstephan weizen glass. Bottled on 05 10 indicated on the label. Pours a mahogany brown with a semi-hazy clarity and a 1.5 inch, frothy, tan-colored head embedded with ringlets. Head eventually settles into a solid, quarter inch skim with a couple semi-concentric bands of lacing present during the tasting. Nose expresses malt, dark fruit and perhaps cocoa. Taste follows nose - more cocoa and less fruit is expressed in the flavor profile; very tasty without being overly sweet. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively carbonation. I'm not overly familiar with the style, but I found Dark Cloud to be quite tasty and easy drinking. All and all very enjoyable brew."
"Appears a deep cola color with a tan head that falls to a thick layer. Decent lacing. Smells of dark roasty malt, molasses, faint hops and cocoa. The taste isn't like a typical Munich Dunkel it's more like a dry stout. It's very roasty with a dry and bitter aftertaste. It's pretty tasty none the less. The mouthfeel is nice - kind of round. Medium body and active carbonation but smooth at the same time. Overall an approachable brew that is not to style but still pretty tasty."
"Overall this is a decent Dunkel, the penny aftertaste does not detract from the overall experience."
"D - The mouthfeel is fantastic, but I have that metallic taste hanging around, after a couple of these I want something else."
"Still slowly venturing into this style, especially now that the months are getting colder. Not bad, can't see myself trying again though."
"Just seems like an uninspired attempt at the style to me, but others certainly seem to disagree. Certainly not an offensive beer, but there are a ton of German offerings that I'd pick up before this."
"Very drinkable, a fine beer."
"Poured from my home tap with a deep dark chestnut brown color and a luxuriously creamy beige head. The aroma is clean and mild but nondescript, with only a toasted grain character being easily identifiable. The flavor seems more roasted rather than merely toasted, with some dry-roasted nuttiness, and a bit of semisweet chocolate. The texture is very creamy with only a very fine carbonation giving it any energy. Overall, this is one easy drinking dunkel."
"D: Great stuff; this blows ""Sisters of the Moon"" away; I think this makes for a great fall / cooler weather beer and I'll be sure to pick some up again next time I'm in NC. Well done, Mother Earth!"
"Overall this was as solid as the day is long. Something I would not hesitate to try again in a heart beat. Really just a wonderful creation and remarkably well done."
"d - wonderfully smooth and refreshing. Left me wanting more."
"While I appreciate this being a bit more complex feeling than your average Dunkel, all of that sweetness, hops, fruit, and roast helped create a deep tang to the taste that got to be a little much at times. Nose and body was spot on though and really helped keep things on the right track. I would give this another try at some point."
"Overall this is a tough style to do well as there's nothing present to mask off-flavors but I think these new guys did a pretty good job. A solid beer that's worth a shot."
"Poured a dark brown body with an offwhite head that stays around and leaves minor lace patches along w/ a light airy malt smell of both sweet and bready malts along w/ a touch of herbal hops. A light, sticky body that has a good dry edge as the herbal hops are light and balanced with some sweet caramel malt as well as cocoa and roasted and bread malt. Finishes real dry and is a nice dunkely that isn't overly sweet or complex but well-balanced and is an easy to drink session beer."
"Great dunkel, if they start selling in Pennsylvania I will definitely purchase more. Otherwise, I will just enjoy on Vacation."
"D: I prefered the beer out of a bottle, as I was better able to control the temperature. I really dig the full flavors and sweet smoothness. A hit from Mother Earth."
"Solid two fingers of cream tan to eggshell white, airy but doesn't dimple much, retention is decent just a steady, even dissipation, the lacing steals the show with nice thick streaks clinging tenaciously. Bronzed orange to redwood in color, its clarity is obvious, however, its darkness of hue prevents transparency from any distance, slightly more orange at the glass bottom. The nose unfolds layers of sweet maltiness, caramel, butterscotch, molasses and chocolate fudge, blends in some orange reduction, cherry syrup and brandy-like notes, still you do get a little graininess, if nothing overtly hoppy. Full-bodied without heaviness, inches forward at a slow, steady gait. Drier here than the nose might suggest, that said, definitely leads with molasses, caramel, chocolate and vanilla, maybe even a little licorice before getting to the more natural orange zest. Bready like raisin bread, mild wheat accents. The carbonation is about average and unobtrusive, While dry, doesn't detract from a softer touch on the tongue. While may lack complexity for some, better thought of as a beer crafted for simple enjoyment. And does very well for itself as such."
"The palate opens with a blend of cocoa, wheat and caramel sweetness. This is moderately sweeter than the Weltenburger I had a few days back. Bready and moderately sweet, there's a little roast as well. Drying on the finish with a mild sweetness (mostly dark caramel), this beer has a medium-light body and a soft, creamy carbonation. Not as dry and crisp as I'd like, but then again, I haven't had too many beers of this style. Very drinkable, I'd like to revisit this."
"D - This is a pretty solid dunkel lager. It delivers a nice taste with the mix of caramel and chocolate notes."
"D: Good, about as good as a dark lager can be!"
"Good beer. I've been saying this a lot lately, but we could use more of these low-ABV beers that pack in a lot of flavor. Is this really so difficult? This dunkel makes is seem easy."
"Picked up a single at Chip's Wine and Beer. Poured a dark amber with a short tan head. The aroma (very strong aroma) and flavor are ruled by a rich, dark bready crust, caramel, and coca character. It begins dry and then a sweet candy note rolls in before a mildy bitter and fruity finish. This is a great take on the dunkel lager style and the best beer from Mother Earth I've had. Find this beer if you dig the style."
"Overall, this is the second offering I've had from this brewery and I have been pleasantly surprised by both. Wouldn't mind trying more of their line up."
"First from Mother Earth and an excellent effor. Wish more brewers would put out a dark lager or Schwarz."
"Great dunkel, If this beer were available to me, it would likely make regular appearances in my fridge."
"This is a faithful representation of the style and very easy to drink, Nice job Mother Earth."
"This lager drinks like an ale with a highly malty body full of complexities. Caramel is the most obvious flavor, while prunes and other dried fruits hide in the back. I usually find these flavors to be overbearing, but this beer is very well balanced. Hops do their job of balance and nothing more. This is a very finely crafted dunkel, I hope these beers find their way to Ohio soon!"
"Overall, this was another solid beer from Mother Earth, which is becoming one of my favorite NC breweries. This beer paired very nicely with the bbq I was eating on Saturday night."
"Very good overall. A great option for those who think they don't like dark beers."
"Overall, a really solid effort from a new brewery. I'm glad a NC brewery has finally produced a nice lager. Having local access to this, I have to say that this will be a regular in my rotation."
"Would stand up well to a bbq meal here in NC."
"Very drinkable brew with a nice blend of flavors for the ABV."
"Drinkability is excellent as well. Goes down fantastically easy, and leaves you savoring every sip. World class beer."
"Pours a very dark brown color with a thin tan head. The aroma has some nice malty complexity with notes of cocoa, pumpernickel bread, oats, chocolate and a little dirt, along with some toffee and coffee. The flavor is very similar to the aroma, with a huge maltiness that is reminiscent of unsweetened cocoa, coffee, toffee, pumpernickel bread, and some peat, along with a mineral hoppiness and a little alcohol. The mouthfeel is appropriately light without being thin, and drinkability is really good. Really solid dunkel here, this isn't a style that I'm especially familiar with or fond of but this beer was nicely executed."
"Drinkability: You can drink these all night. Its a world class beer and its definitely good enough to satisfy your tastebuds day after day."
"Poured a deep garnet with a thin but well retained off white head,a nice mix of cocoa and roasted nut in the nose,rich aromas.Flavors are well rounded with a mix of sweet caramel malt and bitter unsweetened chocolate,a nice earthy/roasty finish makes it highly drinkable.A very nice dunkel lager,not overly sweet but just the right amount,well done."
"sixer kindly carried up by a friend, dig the label too"
"This beer is fairly full-bodied with a good carbonation backing. Sweet flavors of bittering dark chocolate, toffee, molasses, and a good mealy finish. Bitterness is very low on this one. This is all malts and I like it. Very good beer. I'd get a sixer of this and enjoy it immensely."
"Pours a very dark copper-brown under a small - but thick and creamy - cap. Rich, dark and fruity aroma...kind of toasted, raisin-bready with a hint of toffee. Mildly sweet dark malt flavor. Toasty caramel and chocolate with a slight bit of bread crust and finishing tartness. Lightly bitter, medium-light bodied, and a little creamy. Pretty good...I've liked everything I've had from these guys so far. Easily drinkable."
"Wasn't sure what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised. Will go nicely with a hot sausage w/sauerkraut later tonight."
"The drink is medium-bodied with sedate carbonation, and is highly-quaffable, to say the least. This particular Mother Earth beer is mild, refreshing, and pretty damned delicious, but could never be accused of overpowering anyone's tastebuds, making this ""dark"" brew a pretty clever full-time offering from the new guys on the block. Given the targeted regional clientele and it's traditional loyalty to BMC pale lagers and the like, Dark Cloud is both an easy step in the craft direction for those more experimental drinkers amidst the masses, and a damned fine treat for hardcore ""subtle beer""-loving geeks alike."
"Poured a dark blown color with a small tan head that diminishes to a ring quickly. Lacing is minimal. Good blend of sweetness and maltness. Drinkability and mouthfeel is very good with this one due to the light body and medium carbonation. Great session beer for the winter months."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint-glass a very dark brown with a thin khaki head that diminishes to a ring and leaves spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma is slight fruit and dark malts. The taste is a nice blend of sweet fruits, dark malts, molasses and slight dried fruits. The beer is fairly light bodied and smooth with mild carbonation. This is an enjoyable beer, especially for the colder months."
"This is my first beer from this new brewery, and I'd have to say I am pretty impressed. If I see this on the shelves I wouldn't hesitate to buy a six-pack. Definitely worth trying."
