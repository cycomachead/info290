"Delicious! Just like I love my coffee. Black and strong❤️"

"Overall: An interesting dark beer that drinks like a lager.  Unconventionally enjoyable. Zero hop notes, alcohol unnoticeable. All in all, a very tasty and easy drinking seasonal."

"This is a seasonal brew that we all here in Houston cannot wait for.   Wonderful flavor,  and strangely, I find its flavor is more pronounced from the can."

"There is nothing like the sound of the Crack! to inspire an inverted Glug and thus, we were off and running. I always get a kick out of the ensuing pseudo-cascade, especially in the darker beers and this was no exception. After settling, I had just over two fingers of deep-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep-ruby/garnet (SRM = > 27, < 34) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled of milk chocolate and bread or biscuits, which was nice without being cloying or overdone. I began to see some nice lacing form as the head fell. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was unexpectedly more bitter than the nose had led me to think. I really liked this as a result! Think about it - a CANned lager from a microbrewery, which is unusual in and of itself, but then one that did not evince the usual sweetness of the style. Sure, it had a chocolate/cocoa sweetish flavor from the malt, but it was downplayed by the grassiness of the hops, making it an eminently drinkable beer. Finish was semi-sweet and really a nice change of pace for me of late."

"I had this beer at the flying saucer in Houston. This was my first karbach beer and I thought it was very good with a rich, dark, smooth ride. I have looked for this beer at other places but it must be seasonal. I will try and get in a keg for my kegerator when it comes back out later this year."

"A very enjoyable lager. Like most Karach this does not have a real defined style. Kind of a cross between a dunkle lager and Swartz. I am sure I will continue to drink this on occasion with no problem."

"My daughter bought these for him and told me she loves the names that Karbach chooses for its brews. Poured into a Saint Arnold taster glass. Giant creamy tan-colored head about 4"" tall that dissipates rapidly to about 1 finger, leaving a very nice lacing in the glass. Very dark, black-dark red color. Very clear. Color of the can is very close to the color of the beer. Smells less than it tastes. Chocolate and very roasted malt notes. Very nice soft mouthfeel. Tastes more sophisticated than it smells. Just enough bitterness to balance out the sweetness. Very well blended flavors that are nicely balanced with some faint hops in the background. The hops come out in the aftertaste. I must admit I tend to discriminate against cans because in the past I could taste metal and hate that. I do not taste any metal in this beer even thought its canned. Afterglass reveals the hops. A very nice colder-weather seasonal."

"Hmmmm, mild chocolate and bigger roast. The malts just dont really smooth out the way a good Dunkel does. Pretty much a letdown for Karbach after many a good canned seasonal....and this coming from a huge Dunkel fan. Mouthfeel is actually a high point despite the roast. Carbonation is fine-bubbled. Its not horrible, but with some of the recent successes from Karbach and my love for the Dunkel style, I was hoping for something special."
