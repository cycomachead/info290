"O: Solid, tasty & probably a good session beer. Not overly complex but tasty"

"This review is for the draft version. Bought bottles to go and VINEGAR was present when I opened them at home."
""
"It pours a nice dark amber copper color with a nice off white head that was about .5"". The head cleared quickly and the lacing was alright; mostly spotty. The smell was a little odd to me, but enjoyable. This will sound weird but I got a baking soda and vinegar smell along with nutty, wheat. I also got a bit of a vinegar and baking soda taste from this beer which wasn't necessarily bad because it was very subtle, but it was odd. I also got some nutty flavors and a wheat back end. It had a decent mouthfeel but nothing overly special. I enjoyed this beer in a slightly odd way, but I don't know if I'll buy it again."

"Nose did not show the light sweetness that is really nice on the flavor. Toasted nuts and cleans up nicely on the finish. Im a sucker for a good dunkel and this beer scratches that itch quite well...I like it. It does show some lager brewing flaws, some diacetyl in particular, but it doesnt work against the beer too much. Its not too toasty that can sometimes just get a little acrid when combined with the hops. I wish this style was brewed more by American craft breweries, it really hits that 'malty, sessionable note'..for me at least."

"A real solid beer that is a good representation of the style. Very drinkable and with just enough flavor to keep things interesting. A session offering for sure."

"Enjoyable beer, pretty well balanced, but could be more complex, makes for a nice session beer and I would have it again."

"I picked up a variety pack of Church Brew Works beer on a recent trip to Pennsylvania. Pious Monk is probably my favorite of the lot. It’s a nice Munich Dunkel that features all the standard bells and whistles. Definitely worth checking out."
""
""
"O - Good mix of sweet, rich, and bready. The flavor is very full for a beer this light in body. This would make a good low ABV session beer. Mouthfeel is fantastic, nearly perfect. Not a style I typically drink or else I would consider getting it again."

"Tea-colored lager with no real head to speak of. Aroma, which is pretty mild, is primarily fruits and bread. Flavors of fruit, caramel and faint brown sugar. This lager is lighter in body and less flavorful than I expected. It's crisp and easy to drink but left me a little underwhelmed."
""
""
""
""
"It is an easy-going Dunkelbier, and I would sometimes stop and look at it and wonder if I was drinking a Yuengling or this Dunkelbier. Overall, a good deal from Church Brew Works."
""
"Poured a medium brown color, hazy, but still see-through, with a thin, wispy layer of bubbles for a head. Somewhat subdued aroma, dark malts, moderate roast, mild hops. Taste reflects what was noted in the nose: roasty dark malts, grains, mild earthy hops, slight bitterness from a subtle cocoa flavor. Crisp, dry finish. Light-medium mouthfeel, nothing that hasn't been experienced before, but overall quite sessionable."
""

""

"Overall: Expected more depth & flavor for a Munich Dunkel."
"Overall: I enjoyed this beer. The taste was bold given the abv. I'm not sure I'd have another, but I'm glad I tried it."
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is smooth and easy-drinking. The body is slick and slightly sticky, which really helps the presentation of the flavors. The carbonation is only slightly fizzy and really helps this beer's drinkability."

"Crisp and drinkable, this is a sessionable brew to be had straight from the bottle"

"O: Couldn't put it down. Not mind boggling my any means, but a darn good beer overall."
""
"This beer was ok..nothing to make a trip to the store for though. Malts and hops devote a deep brown hue...similar to a lager. The thickness of the beer in mouth in quite apparent as well. Taste reminds of me of Yuengling a bit, but a bit more malty. The Church Brew Works has other outstanding beers that overshadow this guy I feel..."
"This is a solid brew, nice dark drown to redish color, no head at all. Very little carbonation bubbles.Very smooth.Perhaps a roasty maltly taste, a bit bready in fact. The lower alcohol content makes it more of a session style brew. This is what I would want with my steak,hands down. I live a bit north of the brewery and hear many good things about it, not only on the beer side, but the food is well talked about as well."
"D= A very easy to drink lager. Mostly smells and tastes of bready malts a really good Munich Dunkel while they had better things on there beer menu I wouldn't mine trying this one again."
"Pours a bright light copper-brown color with a very, very thin white head and only a bubble or two on top after a few seconds. No lacing. The nose brings some light caramel and bread crust along with faint earthy hops. Flavor is a nice combination of lightly-toasted bread and very mild caramel along with a touch of sweetness and light hops. Light to medium body with moderate carbonation; fairly chewy. Refreshing bitterness on the back-end. Good brew."
"Pours a dark clear reddish brown. With a light tan head that goes to a thin film and ring. Nice lace. Smell is rich toasted malt, some molasses and a bit a crisp hop. Taste is quite sweet rich deep toasted malt, bread, brown sugar...pretty darn sweet. A touch of hops on the back end adding a touch of crispness. Medium body with active carbonation though a touch course. Overall a pretty easy beer to drink but lacking in finesse both taste and mouthfeel."
"Poured on tap into a pint glass at Church Brew Works in Pittsburgh durin my visit in 2008. Pours amber, beige head. Aroma is malty / caramel, earthly hops. Taste, malty with some ncie chocolate notes with subtle nutty addition. Beer is well balanced, light hops giving an alsmot dark fruits flavor, with an always present nice chocolate / caramel malts. Finish leaves some light bitter hops. Beer became more enjoyable as it warmed up."
"Bottle from Sammy. Pours an amber-brown colour with thin off-white head with good retention, though little lacing. Smells of toasted malt, caramel and bread. Flavour has a nice caramel sweetness to it, but it is pretty subdued. Medium carbonation level."
"D: Could be complimented with food but it's missing something on its own..."
"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a light level of carbonation. There are some characteristics of this brew that are outside of what I am use to for a dunkel but it isnt bad. The abv is completely hidden and it is a decent session brew."
"D: This is a highly sessionable Dunkel. A nice local offering, not my favorite local, but certainly a worth a try. I would enjoy it again."
"D: This beer is light and easy to drink, yet there is enough complexity to keep it interesting. Overall this could be a good beer to have at the end of the evening while winding down"
"M/D - Mouthfeel is light and the beer goes down easily even on a hot day. Certainly a good take on a dunkel but I wouldn't make this the first beer you grab at the brewery."
"d - A very easy to drink lager. Mostly smells and tastes of bready malts, probably wouldn't seek out again."
"Yeah...this is drinkable and worth trying, but nothing real enticing here. Slightly above average at best."
"Remembering to keep style and ABV firmly in mind, Pious Monk Dunkel is a tasty little MDL that deserves an increase in the score that matters most. This is quietly impressive beer. Thanks to mgbickel for my first Church Brew Works brew. Love the bottle cap."
"Pretty much a solid, all around brew. There's nothing I dislike about it. Highly drinkable, and from me, highly recommended."
"D - If I went their again I would order it again but since it was sub par I would seek Dunkel at other places."
"D - If you are drinking this like I was expecting a quality German-style dunkel, you will probably be disappointed. Dunkel is prevalent in the Pittsburgh area, and this is not one of the best I had up there... out of three different breweries. It just does not have enough body, and is too light."
"D: Pretty high. I can't say that this is the best beer but it's not bad."
"D: Having one isn't so bad, but I think I'd get sick of the flavor real fast if I tried to drink more."
"Drinkability: I kind of went in-between with this one - it's not bad, but the flavors just don't seem to be there for me. I wouldn't turn it down if someone offered it to me, but I likely wouldn't seek it out. I would be very curious to try more offerings from this brewery in the future if I come across them."
"Not a bad beer, although not the best dunkel I've had. Still, I would choose to enjoy this beer again. Worth checking out."
"D - This is basically a follow up of the taste and aroma since dunkel lagers are pretty drinkable by default. Considering the smell and taste aren't that great, this is basically the same. It's entirely possible my bottle is old and has seen better days, so I probably owe it to myself and to CBW to make it over and try it from the source."
"In general, I put the Church Brew Works' brewing at ""good", not terrific, not bad, but this is opne that really stands out for me. An unassuming beer with a lot to offer."
"The mouth is smooth with surpassing low carbonation levels. Easy beer to pair with their food."
"drinkability is good. light and watery for a dunkel, but for what it is it gets the job done. worth a try."
"I'm not crazy about the lack of power on this dunkel, but it's a great dark."
"First thoughts: Very clean and crisp, with a strong but not outstanding malt presence. true to lager form. Very slight taste of dark fruit. Body is a little thin, has little impact on the palate. Easy drink to session. Not much to say, a decent enough session beer, but not something I would seek out again."
"Notes from: 6/1/07"
"Drinkability is good, this is a semi light lager, easy to drink, slam, and session."
"I was disappointed by this. Just not enough complexity or assertiveness but the drinkibility at least whet my whistle enough during my meal."
"other than that I liek this beer and I am glad I picked up the sample pack"
"Bottle thanks to Daniel. Pours out a ruby/brown color with a small white head. The aroma is mostly toasted malts, some light fruits and perhaps s touch of banana. The flavor is similar; lots of toasted malts, some bananas, clove and something odd I can't put my finger on. Fizzy and full of flavor. Decent overall."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Boulevard Smokestack goblet. This beer pours a nice rich brown with a small head that quickly recedes into a lily pad on the center of the glass. The aroma is straight up malts, with absolutely no hop presence. I also detect some dark fruits, plums and apples. The taste follows suits with a big malty presence, dark fruits, and brown sugar. The mouthfeel reminds me of soda pop. Highly carbonated with a sharp carbonation, the kind that burns the roof of your mouth if you let it sit in your mouth and burns the back of your throat as you try to swallow. While I'm happy to try any beer once, the mouthfeel is enough to keep me for seeking it out again."
"Drinkable beer, nice offering."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a scant 1/4"" tan head over the clear orangey brown brew. Head dwindles at a quick pace, with average lacing. Aroma is hearty grain husks. Flavor exhibits the same grain character, with a crisp close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinking is easy. Simple, lowish abv, wouldn't mind if this was an everyday brew."
"Drinkability: A decent example of the style but lacks a bit of depth compared to the top examples, including that brewed across town by Penn Brewing"
"D - Good drinkable lager."
"Overall, good example of an American Dunkel. Very drinkable if anything."
"What's really important though is not the bold, blistering American touch they left out - it's the efficiency and craftsmanship of German tradition they left in. Beer is, after all, for drinking and this is great for exactly that!"
"Overall: Its a pretty solid overall brew but nothing special."
"This beer was really easy to drink. It poured about like an average dunkel, with a slight head, no lacing. Nice malts on the nose, not very hoppy, true to the style. A bit of chocolatey malt flavor on the palate. Something was missing here, though. Just not enough syrupy sugar or something. It fell a bit short. Now by no means will I never have it again, but the Brew Works has better offerings."
"Pours a clear darker brown. Nose is mild malts and just mild all around. Flavor is very slight citrus sweetness. Minor earthy edge. Standard feel. Leaves a real funny aftertaste and makes this no better than a so-so brew. It's decent enough, but not really impressive enough to warrant a return."
"Havent had much expeience with a Dunkel, this is decent."
"I have not ventured into this style much at all, but I do know I enjoy this beer. I could hit it all day long if I had to."
"Final Thought: This dunkel tastes good!"
"Very good dunkel,I really enjoyed it.It was the best lager beer Ive had in a while.I could have another one for sure.Thanks to Pittsburgh for producing this tasty beer.I need to visit this place and try some on tap."
"Shintriab's bottle, taking me to the Savant level. Easily quaffable, brown colour with creamy head. Nuts, caramel, chocolate malt.Subtle in roast.Sessionable alcohol so you can drink something else and still be functioning.Medium to light mouthfeel."
"""Gold Medal Winner of the Great American Beer Festival. Our beer is fairly dark in color, but dont be afraid. It is a perfect example that dark beers are not always strong beers. The body is surprisingly mellow, and the alcohol content is a bit lower than most people might think. It has a wonderfully clean and roasty aroma. Hop bitterness levels are kept in line, but is has a noticeable hop flavor. Alcohol by Volume - 5.2"""
"D: Good beer, easy drinking and a nice body. A solid selection from Western PA."
"D- the combination of the taste and smoothness makes this a pretty drinkable beer"
"Drinkability is good. Nothing special here, but it's a session worthy beer, and a decent example of the style. Certainly worth a try, this is a pretty good beer, it just didn't look all that appealing in my pilsener glass."
"D: Nice session quality dunkel lager for that hot summers day. I enjoyed this--thanks for the opportunity. Very easy drinking and smooth."
"An OK beer. Nothing great and probably not worth a revisit."
"Wow, fresh malt aroma right off the pour! Clear, medium chestnut brown with a very light tan head that quickly settled to a solid ring. Some fine lacing, but not longlasting. Warm, sweet malty aroma, some brown sugar and a hint of roast, freshly milled grain, nuts, and some caramel. Mild bitterness. Toffee and light brown sugar up front, a bit of roast towards the end with growing bitterness. Pretty toasty and malty overall. Lightish body with carbonation that's not overpowering yet still lively. The texture is on the creamy side to start, then becomes a little more astringent and dry in the finish. I like it. It has a solid malt backbone, nice flavours and is light enough to have a couple in a sitting."
"D- This beer has clean crisp flavor but there is nice depth in the malt without the typical pot caramel off-flavors. Very smooth and drinkable."
"This was served to me a dark amber color with scents of toasted bready malts. The taste was a medium bodied and a little sweet malt flavor with a hint of hop bite. A very refreshing tasting lager with a high drink ability that I will be looking for again."
"Sample at the brewpub. The beer pours a murky dark amber color with a medium thin light beige head and spotty lacing. Bready malt aroma, along with a hint of nuts. Medium-bodied and smooth with malt and caramel flavors, plus a bit of chocolate. It kind of falls off though, and the lightly bitter hops aftertaste is short-lived as well. This showed promise at first but ended up being pretty run-of-the-mill."
"Drinkability: Above average, but nothing worth raving about. Still a decent effort from CBW and one that may make a decent session brew too for some."
"Easily my favorite from Church Brew Works. (Thanks again to ""N" for bringing it back from Pittsburgh.) Deep rich color in the glass with nicely foaming head. Smell was rich, roasted malt with subtle hops--and the taste was exactly the same. Nice slightly bitter aftertaste that made you want more. I'm just glad I have another bottle in the fridge. Of course then I'll have to wait until I get back up to PA."
"This poured with a huge, bubbling, deep-tan head that simply reduced itself to wispiness in no time. The color was a deep, cola-brown with cherry-red highlights. The nose was lightly malty, but that was about all. I got a chocolaty flavor on the tongue and the mouthfeel was light, but about right for a lager. The finish had that same chocolate aspect that I noted on the tongue. Compared to the earlier Celestial Gold, this is eminently drinkable. I really liked this beer and would certainly consider it for a session, given its low ABV."
"One of the better offerings from CBW. Attractive golden-yellow in color with a sturdy head that does a nice job of lacing. Nose of toasted malt, some smoke. Subtle smoke carries over into the flavor as well, along with some caramel sweetness. Nice, sweet finish. Above-average mouthfeel and drinkability."
"Overall: I am hoping I got a bad batch of this brew, because it was dissapointing at best. I wasn't the only one to share this sentiment that night. I'll give it one more shot and if nothing changes I will probably never try this or any of their brews again. Thoroughly dissapointing to say the least. I am unimpressed with their range of brews. Doesn't hold a match to Penn Dark."
"One half finger foamy head atop clear reddish brown color. Aroma of roasted malt. Taste is smooth and refreshing with very light burnt quality lurking in the background. Finish has very full bready malt character. Mouth is fairly balanced, but borders on wateriness. This beer definitely deserved the accolades it got at the GABF. I'd have another next time I'm in Pittsburgh."
"This beer works for me. Doesn't seem quite right on the coldest night of the new year. Would be nice on a sunny day in May. Nonetheless, enjoyable for style and I'm glad I was able to try a beer from this brewery."
"D: I was surprised to see this bottled. Ive always found this to consistently be their best offering, and it didnt lose much in bottling. Amazing that this brewery/restaurant has survived while the Strip and Valhalla went under (though I found them overall superior), but theyve done a good job with marketing and having a gimmick doesnt hurt either. The beer alter is so sacrilegious, its great. But anyway, back to the beer. This is a nice offering, worth a try."
"Drinkability - Kind of boring to be highly drinkable."
"bitterness is a bit much here and lack of complexity gives way to an overwhelming dryness. nothing special."
"D&N: Good beer, could be better in the nose."
"Draught at the brewery: This one was a copper color with some off-white head to it. It was fairly clear. The aroma was a bit thin: nothing bad to it just not much there. There were hints of sweetness and spices. The body was a bit of a medium with an OK but non-descript flavor. This just rates an OK."
"22 oz. bottle. Pours a deep copper color with a light beige head. Subtle Munich malt chocolatey aromas, and some distinctively smelling German hops. It smells crisp. At first sip, it seems a little thin; but I suppose the good, roasty quality of the taste makes up for it. It has a mineral or hard water type of feel to it. Its maltiness is sweet and roasty/toasty and there's an inkling of fruitiness. It's a slighest bit tart in the finish, maybe some drying effects from both the malt and hops. Not a bad dunkel, a decent sessioner."
"Served as part of their beer sampler. This one was a deep and dark orange color that was one step away from brown. Very clear and topped off with a thin tan/orange creamsicle-like head of foam. The aroma is nutty, rich with semi-sweet caramel and has plenty of toffee-like malt character. After a few more whiffs, I could swear I was getting some buttery popcorn notes. Very interesting and somewhat complex. The taste is nice and malty, richly flavorful with dark and sweet candy. The body is just a few clicks above medium and has a very nice sticky malt finish. Overall, a very nice dunkel. Not too heavy, but still leaves a sweet tangy coating on the tongue. By far, the most malty of the nights beers."
"Had this beer on a recent trip to the Pittsburgh, at the brew-pub. Its served as a murky, dark-brown with shades of amber. Nice off-white head thats quite stable. The aroma is composed of earthy, roasted-malt smells. Theres a yeasty character to the smell as well. Its moderately carbonated, slightly sweet, and finishes with a brief bitterness. Its quite tasty and very drinkable."
"The color of this little lager is a medium reddish brown with good clarity. This is lightly malty in the flavor and the aroma with a slight bitterness and a mildly chocolatey finish. I keep looking for something a little more with this one that never arrives."
"Thanks for sharing Tim"
"A bit of a roasty mouthfeel, but still crisp (Considering it was a bit sweet). Definitely a beer that you could drink a few of. Full of flavor and a nice roasty scent."
"Appearance: See through amber brown tone off white head dwindles to leave behind evenly strung lacing. Aroma: Consists of mild chocolate notes and roasty malt profile that's decently robust with a fruity character swimming through as well balanced with a touch of German hops. Taste: Out of the regulars this is the one I would go with every time, even balance nice dark roasted malt character with a dose of hops crisp flavor, nice session brew. Mouthfeel: Light to medium range for the body even carbonation nice easy drinking dunkel. Drinkability: Like I said best option from their year round lineup."
"A great dunkel from the CBW. Possibly the best of their regular offerings, a nice roasted character makes this a lager absolutely worth having again, and fortunately this one is bottled. Fantastic, and one I'd have again."
"(22 oz. bottle from Bill Scott)"
"The mouthfeel is light, but it has a clean finsh that one would expect from a lager. The drinkability is excellent, and as I said, it pairs with food well. One of the regulars on the CBW beer list, and it should be."
"Like its namesake, this is a refined, quiet brew with a well-rounded if short finish. Very light on the palate, though with a darker tone than one would expect given its overall subdued character. Very drinkable - a beer to relax with."
