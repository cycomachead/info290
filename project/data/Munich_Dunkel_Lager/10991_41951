The only sort of hop bitterness comes through in the middle with a very earthy, slightly grassy taste, though it's frankly too mild to be of any considerable note. Body is medium and the finish is very smooth. Given my inexperience with the style, I can't say much other than that it's very tasty, though everything seems simply par for the course.

3.33,-10.7,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Overall: Clean well made beer. That said it is not that interesting and alcohol seems too high. This could be a style issue with me.

3.53,-5.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured a nice deep chestnut with moderate, short lived head. Nicely roasted malt flavor at a level appropriate for the style. Just a touch acidic and seemed like it could have used just a bit more sweetness in the malt. According to the label the beer is "slow aged." As opposed to quickly aged, I suppose.","Brent","Sep 29, 2010"
3.5,-6.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Grabbed one o' these guys last year after X-Mas Break...decided to give it another go (as I couldn't remember it...). It pours a clear dark-ish garnet topped by a half-finger of short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises caramel, dark toffee, rye bread, and dark greens. The taste is very similar, heavier on the rye bread, with a deep orange-rind bitterness bubbling up from beneath. A splash of what seems like cedar makes its way in there as well. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a decidedly wet feel. Overall, an okay brew, but nothing fully clicks with me. Nothing truly offensive, though.","TMoney2591","Jul 31, 2010"
3.8,1.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability: Went very well with a meal (BBQ sloppy joes and fries) and I could easily have one ore two of these by themselves. The taste is interesting and grows on me with every sip.","damndirtyape","Jul 25, 2010"

3.85,3.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a pint glass. The beer is a transparent dark brown with a modest light brown head. The head disappeared quickly, leaving a patchy skim of bobbles. The aromas has tones of toasted malts and some woodsy hops. There are a few different flavors present, there is some slight coffee bitterness as well as some molasses-like sweetness. The beer has a light body and just the right amount of carbonation; it tickles your tongue but doesn't distract from the flavors. This is an easy drinking beer that is very enjoyable to drink. It's worth picking up if you need a craft beer to enjoy over an evening, but that won't be the center of your attention.","ToasterChef","Nov 20, 2009"
3.75,0.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Barbarrosa was a see-thru, medium brown and had a tan colored head that didn't last.

The drinkability was good, I'd have a few in a sitting. Good beer, I enjoyed it more than the only other Munich dunkel lager that I've tried.","kegger22","Oct 18, 2009"
4,7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Clear, dark amber with a slight creamy light tan head that quickly shrinks leaving scraps of lace behind. Toasted malt and raisin make up the nose on this one.

Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, with above average carbonation. Drinkability is decent, it's not hard to drink at all. I could have this as an occasional session beer.

3.23,-13.4,3.5,3,3,3,4,"The taste is the very much the same except for the addition of a faint hop note. Overall it seems muted and bland to me. However it is easy to drink, and I would happily do so all day if this was the only thing available.","edskirk3","Dec 04, 2008"
3.73,0,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Smells roasted but sweet like a milk stout. Pours to a root beer color with a muti-sized bubble head that holds up for a little while then disappears. Taste is sweet and Marzen like then has a tangy hop flavor that flattens the sweetness but with only a very slight bitterness. Subtle chocolate malt notes. Mouthfeel is silky smooth. Delicious. I highly recommend this brew to a BMC drinker who is branching into craft brews. Delicious. I'd like to clone this one with a home brew.","mooseisloose","Nov 25, 2008"

3.5,-6.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Medium to medium full body, with moderate carbonation. A decent example of a Munich Dunkel, but I wouldn't call this rich. Would be better if it had a little more depth of flavor as I don't really get a strong bread crust flavor which is characteristic of the style.","briman","Oct 26, 2008"
4.07,9.1,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"D - This is a great drinkable beer. Goes down well and with the 5% ABV I could drink a few of these no problem.","mcowgill","Oct 14, 2008"

3.8,1.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Taste is much the same, but I get a little sweetness and some tobacco/smoke flavors as well. Medium to full on the mouthfeel and creamy. This is a nice addition to the CM lineup.","FtownThrowDown","Sep 16, 2008"
3.96,6.2,4,3,4.5,4,4," ~ This is a good beer with nice complex characters. I'll certainly recommend the Barbarossa to my friends and wish I had more than just this one. I'm thinking this Double Dark Lager is a champion from the tap.","cdkrenz","Sep 05, 2008"
3.33,-10.7,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"This is an unusual and pleasant beer to quaff in the evening. It sports a lovely deep reddish brown color, with a thick creamy beige head that is persistent and leaves a very nice lacing. The nose is toasted malt, but rather light. On the palate, this is a malty but surprisingly light beer for a dark lager, with hints of coffee among the dark-roasted malt overtones. The finish is unremarkable, but pleasant. Good mouthfeel with smoothness and solid carbonation. Refreshing, again for an evening beer on days that are not too hot. This one pairs nicely with a good serving of Cincinnati-style chili. Overall, pretty drinkable, especially with a robust meal.","jushoppy2beer","Aug 20, 2008"

4.02,7.8,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"This beer poured a very clear brown with a 1/4 inch head. The aroma is malty and somewhat cereal. There is also some slight banana scent. The taste is sweet and big of malt flavor. There is a slight bitterness which adds to the overall experience. The mouthfeel is full and there is a carbonation bite. This is an easy drinking. well balanced beer.","barefootbrewer","Aug 14, 2008"
4.07,9.1,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a clear, deep copper with a small off-white head that dissipates quickly to a ring with no lacing. The aroma has a lot of roasted malts with sweet dark fruits and caramel on top. A hint of hops in the nose as well. More of the same (in a good way) in the taste with a huge sweet caramel malt backbone and only a hint of the roasted quality in the finish. Hops make an appearance in the aftertaste with the faintest bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, and sweet. This is an extremely drinkable dunkel and a very good beer overall.","gford217","Aug 04, 2008"

4.23,13.4,4.5,4,4,4,5,"Imo, this is a great example of the style, a style that I don't have a lot of experience with but the ones I have tried generally are too light in the flavour department. Not so with this one. Highly recommended!","Bitterbill","Jul 19, 2008"
4.18,12.1,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability- Very excellent example for a Munich dunkel style. I would buy a sixer of this one for a session. I may do it before I move back to the great north.","blakesell","Jun 27, 2008"
4.25,13.9,4,4,4,4.5,5,"Drinkability - very much so. I went through several cases before I finally sat down with one to review. Right up there with OTR for my favorite CM beer. Has a great color for a Halloween tasting this fall...","brewdlyhooked13","Jun 24, 2008"

4.1,9.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"D - A fine dark lager, very very drinkable for me. I just enjoy the smoothness and malty flavor w/ balance of gently spiced hops in addition to the subtle roast. To me this went down great and could be session worthy for sure","Slatetank","May 14, 2008"

3.95,5.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Sweet malty nose, caramel mostly. Refreshing for a reasonably full beer (more like medium bodied), it has a malty taste without really being heavy or cloying; its caramel and bready notes are reasonably well balanced by a mild hoppy bitterness that comes and goes. Not overly complex, but a very nice beer for warmer weather.","brdc","Beers"

This is a beer I'll drink again, but I would like to explore the style much more before coming back to it. Don't really know that much about this particular style. In my opinion this is the weakest of the new releases that Christian Moerlein has come out with.","becktone","Beers"
