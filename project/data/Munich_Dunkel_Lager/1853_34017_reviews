"O: This beer is really enjoyable and easy to drink - definitely a sessionable beer and one I would enjoy having again."

"A really nice Dunkel, overall."
"The Pilsner qualities of the beer are clear, while the additions of dark grain add numerous complexities for extra robust taste and texture. A very good German Dunkel!"

"A good well made beer with nothing really bad about it."

"Aroma is deep and dark from the start. Rich dark caramel notes are all over this one. Vanilla, hints of oak, Roasted nuts, some brown sugar, dark frits, figs maybe? Really just complex as I even pull a touch of vanilla through after a few minutes. Really nice, and quite full feel for the style, due in most part to near perfect carbonation. This allows the flavor to roll across the palate and really just cling to every ounce of taste buds you have. Caramel, bready notes, hints of light spice are all leading the charge here"
"D-very drinakble just like a nice german dunkel"
"D - I'm not so sure that this one shines as a ""Munich Dunkel Lager", but it's a darn tasty brew. I'm rating more to overall impression then style, and it goes down smooth and easy."
"Overall good drinkability and not a bad Dunkel."
"Very enjoyable, sessionable, tasty. Can't say it's my favorite for the style, but this will do without problem. Maybe not one I'd jump at ordering if I'm out, but could definitely see myself grabbing some for a get-together or having a few in a row."
"I could have another one. Easy drinker."
"overall, a good/great dunkel. love to see great crafts coming in cans."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a pretty brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is overwhemingly of malts. Taste is good, lots of malts, a bit of sweetness, a slight bitterness at the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"SFDL pours out your dark brown pond water color and comes into the glass a deep dark bark brown color with a short lived cap of cocco looking head that's frosty. No stick. Smell is kinda really bad and it just smells off, fresh can by the way. Uh, smells like roasted malt, degraded grain and shame. Taste is no better, i really feel like im drinking pond water here. I cant describe it, not my bag. Feel is watery not lively, kinda flat and weird? I drank all six and I will never do it again."
"Overall, this beer simply isn't good. I really couldn't pick out one good aspect of this beer. Not drinkable at all. A B average? I really can't see where that is coming from."
"Would I buy more of it? - sure, as far as dark lagers in can goes this is pretty much the one that I'd go for."
"On-tap at Cole's. No aroma, a nice dark brown colour with a minimal white head, however lots of lace ws left after draining. A basic dunkel, Ok drinkability, above average carbonation. Brown sugga.Fairly uninteresting, chocolate malts, a drop of bitterness."
"Drink is decent. A malty beverage and a very surprising taste is coming out of this can. I am so used to seeing piss yellow beer coming out of a can. This is a treat."
"D: Low ABV and drinkable. Some imperfections but it's reasonably tasty."
"Pours a caramel amber with very fizzy head, down to nothing as I look again. Smells of cherries and fermenting fruits. Pretty malty on the nose and tongue, I get no hops at all. Pretty average dunkel I suppose. Its very sticky and has hints of caramel but this beer is not a knockout at any level."
"As I mentioned before this beer is not exactly what I look for in the style, but it is still a solid offering that I will definitely be drinking again."
"D - If I had to pound Dunkel Lagers this would be an OK choice - don't like it quite as much a Denison's Dunkel, which ahd a much richer flavor profile. Still, the low ABV, medium carbonation, and nice texture make it pretty session ideal. I like the convenience of cans too."
"It actually has a nice aroma for a general lager. I thought it was a bit too bubbly for me. Overall an OKay beer."
"Drinkability: OK, but probably would not have more than two before switching to another beer. None the less this is a good, well made, drinkable lager that many should enjoy."
"Anyway... another nice brew from Wasatch... We need to be careful about all of our trades.. people are gonna start talking :-) Thanks John."
"A very solid drinkable lager. Perfect option if you are sick of the other lager, plus it comes in cans!"
"The beer pours a translucent brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, lager scent that boasts of caramel malts and fruity yeast esters. It has a light breadiness to it. The taste is decent. It has a smooth caramel malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes bone dry with a slight metallic edge. There is a subtle roasted component as well. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good beer. It's flavorful and easy drinking."
"A pretty good Dunkel from Sly Fox. Easy to drink and easier to enjoy."
"Pours sort of a food coloring-y brown with a decent head that sticks and little visible carbonation. Sort of looks like maple syrup. The first thing I notice is that the mouthfeel is oily and weak. Aroma and taste are just straight up bland as hell. I really am not getting any flavors in any direction. This could be the most neutral beer ever. Hmm that's really all there is to say. It doesn't taste bad, but it also doesn't taste like anything. Wow, it comes in a can. That's about all this beer does for me. I'll save the $1.70 extra per can and buy Miller High Life. Sorry boys."
"D - Simple but well-done. Sly Fox makes some fine lagers and this is no exception. Tasty and sessionable."
"D: This is the first dunkel lager I've tried, but I have to hope there are better examples of the style out there. This just seems completely mediocre."
"D - A great beer to kick back to, a little over 5%, this beer is quite sessionable. I would love to try it on draft."
"D: Very easy to drink and would have a few of these as a winter sesion."
"Although I'm not super excited about this beer I will say it is incredibly easy to drink"
"Cheers!"
"Notes: A good beer. I generally don't love lagers, but this one was serviceable. At one point I had the thought ""this is what Yuengling could be"" as I got to thinking about other lagers I drink and noted that like Yuengling, this is a Pennsylvania brew. Like I said, this was decent and I certainly wouldn't mind having a few cans of this on hand in those situations where bottled beer is not an option. . . ."
"D- Easy and quick nice for the style. Very enjoyable beer, if you see one around grab it and drink it down."
"The 3rd of the 4 Sly Fox cans that I have tried, this one courtesy of Schooly. The beer poured a nice amber color with a slight tan ring around the edge of the glass and a slight haze on top. The nose has some pleasing caramel malt notes in there and the taste is malty sweet with some toasted smoke qualit. There is also a good citrus quality, all making for a fairly light body that is easy to drink. My second favorite SF can for tailgating at Phillies games."
"12 oz can poured into a pint glass (should I have used a pilsener?). The color is a hazy red and the appearance is so inviting. The head is quite fluffy. The smell is like bread. The taste is pretty good considering I usually only drink ales. The taste is bready as well and reminds me of an Oktoberfest beer. Man I suck at reviewing beers. This one is good and I am glad to have tried it. Thanks go to nflmvp for sending this my way."
"I'm not very familiar with this style, but I'd say this is a pretty good lager. Flavorful, with plenty of character, but not too in-your-face. I'd pick it up again if I was in the mood for a lager. Also a bonus that it comes in a can; I hope other breweries besides Sly Fox, Oskar's, and Brooklyn (to name a few of my faves) pick up on this."
"Poured from can purchased at the brewery. Dull brown color. 1"" head foams up in a pilsner glass but quickly falls. Just traces of carb bubbles flowing to the top, appears a little dead and undercarbonated. Smell is of bready malts and some faint hops. Taste shows the bready malts up front followed by some caramel and nut flavors and just a hint of butterscotch. Mouthfeel confirms my observation that this one is undercarbonated. A little thin and just no life at all on the tongue. All 6 I got are like this so it's not an isolated occurance. I'll give this one another try but overall it was a dissapointment compared to the others I've had from Sly Fox"
"Draught in Phoenixville: This one poured a very dark golden color, with just a bit of a white head on it. The aroma was a bit light, and had a bit of sweetness to it, as well as a hint of floral. Slightly sweer caramel malt sweetness to the taste. There was some corn notes also. Not a bad session beer."
"Medium- bodied, easy drinking, tasty dunkel. I like dunkel lagers better than most lager styles, and this one was quite good, if not great."
"Another fine canned offering...recommend."
"D-I like it but it may take some time to get used to.I bought a 6 pack and plan to have 3 of them today and save the rest for some other time.Ide buy this again next year,maybe I havnt had this style of beer in a while and thats why the taste doesnt seem familiar to me but none the less a very good beer from a great brewery."
