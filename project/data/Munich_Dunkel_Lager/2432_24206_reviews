"Overall though very solid brew here, with a hint of classic German character but has a bit of an odd sour quality that I can't seem to ignore.  It's definitely not compromised or infected, but a decent beer with a character that sort of distracts me."

"A solid if not great example of the style, imho."

"Great dunkel in my opinion. Not too pricey for the delicious taste of this brew. I am no pro with beer tasting but with dunkels I get this almost banana like taste and this one delivers in that respect. Sugary and smooth. Highly recommended by this nobody."
"Body suits the alcohol content and overall a pleasant and easy drinking beer."

"O: If I had to drink one style of beer for the rest of my life, i think it would be Munich Dunkel's. This was a great example of the style. get it, drink it, share it, Prost!!"
""
"O - The Germans have session beers down pat. Packing much flavor and great body into an easily drinkable beer. The dunkel has the richness of a much bolder style as well."
"The taste begins with a full toffee-caramel malt note followed by a a slightly biting bitter finale. But overall it is a balanced, drinkable beer."
"There's a bit of pre-fermented malt flavor as well--sweet malted sugar. Some darker bread tastes. No notable hop. Below average body with a reasonable level of carbonation."
""
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body with fairly high levels of carbonation. This leads to a mouthfeel that is marginally prickly, quickly becoming moderately light, foamy and smooth across the palate. Closes in a surprisingly dry fashion, with very modest stickiness across the palate."

"O: Excellent dunkel and, unfortunately, much better than the version I have had as a bottled import in the US."
""
"500 ml bottle into pilsener glass, no bottle dating. Pours crystal clear reddish brown color with a small 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Minimal spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, nuttiness, biscuit, molasses, raisin, prune, light chocolate, and light earthy spiciness. Very nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, molasses, raisin, light chocolate, and light herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of caramel, toffee, nuttiness, toast, light chocolate, and biscuit on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robust flavors with great balance and very clean; no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy and very crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed at all on the finish. Overall this is an excellent Dunkel lager. Very nice balance and complexity of flavor; and extremely smooth and easy to drink. Very well done."

"Very drinkable lager beer, just what the style is supposed to be."
"O: Goes down easy, somewhat tasty, not too filling, not much of a kick, ok representation of style. Save for the metallic presence, this would be a pretty quaffable beer."
""
"Overall: A decent enough Dunkel, though I have had better; still, it is hard to know how fresh this might be"
"Decent dunkel, a bit on the heavier side."
"O: blew me away. One of the best funnels I've had in some time. I'm a sucker for roasted tastes and biting carbonation and this shot right for it. A good session beer that one could have three plus of"
"When I poured the Kloster Dunkel from the bottle into my Aventinus weizenbock glass it poured a clear light brown with a reddish hue. There was a slight head that quickly dissipated with a slight lacing on the glass. I took a good sniff and smelled roasted malts and some burnt chocolate. When I took that first mouthful the taste was pretty much like it smelled, roasted malts, a little bready with a burnt chocolate taste. The mouthfeel is a medium feel, a little thinner than some of the dunkels, but not light on taste. Not an abundance of carbonation. Also there isn’t a hint of alcohol. This Dunkel is a nice easy drinking Dunkel. I could have drank a bunch of these for sure. The taste is very nice with a sweeter taste. I highly recommend this if you haven’t had it by now!"
"Taste is a very good, solid dunkel, caramelized toasted barley, gingerbread, woody spice. It is lively and engaging, slightly on the sweet side, excellent with good well-rounded character."
"Overall this was an OK dunkel that I didn't mind but didn't go crazy over. As far as Dunkels go this one was on the lighter side of the spectrum. I would prefer it to be a little thicker and flavorful but the lightness makes it a refreshing easy drinker and good selection for a hot afternoon. For $4 a bottle I don't think I will be revisiting it but if I just have to have a light Dunkel I might be inclined to buy this, but it would help if it was a dollar cheaper. If you want a lighter dunkel give it a try but it isn't worth going out of your way to find it. Not the ultimate dunkel I was searching for, the search continues."
"Pours very dark brown, cola-like color with a little white foam that vanishes. No trace left behind. Maple syrup like smell mixed with maltiness. Sweet. Taste is a faint malt. Nonexistent carbonation, feels very flat. Watery mouthfeel, like I was drinking the wort, not the beer. Meh."
"Easy drinker here. Not the best of the style, but very worth trying. A bit light in intensity, but this is still one more example of what is turning into one of my favorite styles to drink year round."
"Pours chestnut brown wihout much of a head at all. A good swirl doesn't do much to rouse anythig up. Nose is muted with hints of light caramel and not much else. Taste is much better. Good dose of caramel, raisins, toffee, dark fruits, and light yeast. Feel is light to medium and is quite smooth. Drinks quite well; Amyliz4 stole a good portion of my glass. Hopefully this is on tap around here again."
"The palate is just wonderful. Rather rich with a blend of toasted bread, caramel and a little burnt sugar, this beer is very flavorful. This is rather grainy, but in a way that makes me think of brown rice, if that makes any sense, with delicate flavor but very clean and not particularly husky, like wheat can be. Despite the sweet flavors, this is really light on the palate, and dries up on the finish with crisp carbonation, a little burnt sugar and some toast. Hops aren't really noticeable, but that might be because of age. Carbonation is medium-high and is pretty much perfect for this beer. Very drinkable, this is one I look forward to revisiting."
"I really enjoyed this one overall, and I plan to revisit it soon to see if different glassware improves the appearance and aroma."
"M&D: This is a rather full-bodied dunkel. Flavors are rich and remain on the palate for some time. Very smooth. This beer is extremely easy to drink. Good thing it's priced where it is, because this in quantity could get quite expensive. A very sessionable brew, indeed!"
"Drinkability: a very refreshing beer on a hot day like today; there's a good flavor and it's definitely a sessionable brew."
"D: The beer is extremely easy to consume."
"Yeah, like a light dunkel. Not really exciting, and I like this style. But in the overall picture, it is decent."
"Good solid dunkel. Poured with a small to medium tan head that quickly subsides and a tiny bit of lace. Color is a clear amber -copper red. Aroma is roasty and very malty. Flavor is like aroma and very sweet up front then a heavier slightly roasty bitter finish. Good full rounded body and carbonation. Session beer."
"D - Decent representative of the style. if you like this it is very drinkable."
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. While pouring it it looked like cola. When finished pouring it and holding it up to the light it had a creamy amber brown color to it. There's a pretty bubbly head with lots of different sized bubbles that goes away pretty quickly, not much lacing, a few little blotches randomly stick to the glass. Not much of an aroma to the smell. It smells very sweet. Caramelized malts seems too weak of an argument, I'd go with caramel soaked or topped. The taste is pretty good, again it's pretty sweet. Caramelized malts take the bulk of the flavor with some toffee notes. There's also a hint of nuts to it, candied though with the slightest taste of alcohol. Slight hop on the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good, very clean with decent drinkability."
"D: Meh."
"The flavor is quite spicy as well with a nice cove presence as well as some ripe banana notes, smokey caramel malt and a subtle bitterness in the finish. Slightly watered down but still pretty flavorful and easy drinking."
"D: This is a nice beer to me. The thick body impedes the easy quaffing normally associated with a low ABV beer like this, but it didn't bother me. I'm glad I picked it up."
"Medium brown/amber with a small whitish head. Sweet malt aroma, hint of chocolate. Crisp roasted flavors; nutty and slightly sweet mid-palate. Lacks much depth of toasted malt, and finishes a bit thin with some mineral qualities. Not a bad quaffer or food beer, but seems a little deflated. I suspect the bottle isn't the freshest."
"D -- The drinkability isn't so bad, the astringency doesn't overpower. There's no best-by date on the bottle, so I'm questionable about the freshness."
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of sweet malt, yeast, and slight hop. Fits the style of a Munich Dunkel Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, yeast, slight hop, and some roasted malt. Overall, a decent beer, better than most."
"Update November 2010: I had a bad batch when I first reviewed this beer. The beer is plenty carbonated, not flat at all. The beer is a touch watery, but has sufficient lagery caramel flavors to make it a decent choice. I'm upgrading the points on this beer."
"Nice drinkable beer especially if you like a little bock in it. Not all that remarkable, this one gets lost amongst all the others like it from Germany."
"D: Great nose, solid taste, in the end a nice effort, it needs more sweetness to be really good, it definitely has potential."
"D: Definitely seems to bloat the stomach, so it's hard to down a lot or drink a lot fast."
"This tastes wonderful...for about 5 seconds per sip. Its greatness is fleeting. I tried to hold each sip in my mouth as long as possible. It worked well enough that I enjoyed this quite a bit. It certainly has its charm, but not sure I'd return. Ettaler's doppelbock (Curator) is way better (one of the world's best, in my opinion)."
"D - For a super-session a lack of power and lingering finish can actually be a good thing. Sadly, I only have one of these and when I only drink one beer I'd prefer that it be a little more interesting. Actually, due to it's very mellow and light flavor profile (almost like Newcastle) this would be a very good beer to give to a BMC fellow who thinks that all dark beers are ""a meal in a bottle."" Very easy to drink; this one does nothing wrong but it's just easy going and pretty tasty."
"This would be a great choice for people who like the Belgium style or dopplebocks. Paid about 3 bucks for a bottle at Magnolia here in Lynchburg, VA. It is almost worth it...almost. I do like the big bottle so maybe I got a little more beer, but I still don't think I quite got my moneys worth, unless I got a bad bottle."
"D-This is where the beer really shines. A true session beer."
"Was kinda disappointed with this beer, doubtful I'll be back for this one, but I'm not giving up on the style."
"Aftertaste very long, wih again burnt, coal, coffee."
"This brew is a little bit more than light in body, but quite thirst quenching. This wasn't too bad, and is an added incentive to visit the Ettaler Monastery."
"i was told by another group of beer geeks to look out for sediment in Ettaler beers, if you see floaties, you've gotten yourself a bad bottle."
"Nutty brown amber color and very clear with an off-white head. Almost nothing on the nose - a faint whiff of caramel and metal. Uh oh, is it stale? is it oxidized? Is it old? It doesn't taste old or stale, but it is slightly oxidized. There is a faint nutty caramel character that is nothing that Shiner bock couldn't achieve with a little effort, but the stand out is the smooth, clean ""roundness"" That is mostly reserved for German and Czech lagers. Pretty drinkable due to the lack od serious flavor, but the body is there medium to full body. Finishes with that same distant nutty caramel flavor."
"Pours dark brown, big head, medium duration. Nose is malty, sweet. Taste is toasted malt, sweet, big bready character. Medium body. Highly carbonated, almost effervescent. Finish is sweet, malty. No detectable bitterness. Could drink this one all night."
"D: This one is very drinkable. There is no nothing overwhelming that forces you to sip it."
"I expected more from this beer than what was delivered in the flavor. Too one dimensional. It does have a great creamy mouthfeel even with a lively carbonation. Feels medium body and goes down easily and the ABV won't sneak up on you. Worth a try but I won't revisit."
"D: Drinkability is therefore limited to and hindered by its sweetness."
"Dark brown/amber color with 1 finger tan head and moderate head and lacing. Nice smell with complex notes to it of fig and plum and roasted chocolate. Roasted coffee with a chocolate finish. Well balance of smooth malt with a hop tickle. Smooth medium-full body that retains throughout. Very drinkable for a dark."
""
"Great smooth creamy texture. Totally drinkable."
"The mouth is silky smooth with a nice low level of carbonation. This is a great session beer."
"Drinkability: easy to quaff this one, and for me this can be a long session beer. Enjoyable and I will be picking up more of this."
"Drinkability is good easy drinking not complex at all no master piece and probably wouldn't repurchase but not a bad little beer."
"Drink easy, not as good as at the source, but worth seeking out. IMO this is the best offering from this scenic Kloster brewery"
"Sitting outside of a German pub, in the middle of Ettal. Nice warm day, the girls were shopping. So my Dad and I sat down to have a beer. I had never heard of Ettaler, until I got to the town. This beer had a huge white head on it (german pour). Brown color was typical. Aroma was lacking, this one needs to hit the mouth. Very malty, carmel backbone, easy to drink and nice on a warm afternoon. Not to mention the feeling you get drinking a local german brew in southern Bavaria."
"Very light and crisp mouthfeel. Hint of metallic in the finish. Fairly balanced between sweet and dry. Easy to drink. I'd probably pick a brown ale over this most days, but it is a decent change up."
"Taste is sweet and roasted (molasses) with a light maltbitter. There is no real hop bitterness or hop aroma present. The malt is more pronounced in the taste than in the smell. There is very little carbonation in the beer, which interfere the drinkability of the beer. I don't know if I had a bad bottle, but it doesn't seem right."
"No, this was a fine beer, and I could tell there's a slightly richer complexity to it that I just was not in the best state to appreciate."
"D-Hell of a session beer....great nose...nicely flavored....body is about right for the style....this is a dandy.."
"Notes: This is the best Munich Dunkel I've had to date. I simply couldn't find one thing to harp on (try as I might)."
"Brown body with ruby-red highlights and about a half an inch of off-white head. Smells like malt, caramel, and brown sugar mostly. Tastes sweet and malty, roasty, like brown sugar and molasses. Medium in body. Rather drinkable. A really tasty decent little beer."
"M&D: full of body yet extremely clean on the mouthfeel, while the carbonation remains soft and soothing without being intrusive... For this style, I think I've finally found something that impresses me big time... well-balanced and well-structured b/w a quiet but significant input of hops and moderate entry of dark malts, while the body and flavour both are retained from the beginning to the last drop. A really cool and enjoyable Dunkel this is... all thanks to my lovely German flatmate's kindest offer!!"
"Beer poured into tumbler at 50 degrees. This beer was a good beer,, it had fair head though went awayy quick. It was a pretty dark brown and tasted slightly of roasted something. But it just did not stand out greatly. While I liked it okay I will still have to say that I will not purchase gain."
"Dark clear caramel color with an ok white head that dissipates into a thin coating, but with big lacing. Has some toasted malt notes and a little cherry int he nose, but not much else. Taste starts with a light mollasses, takes a left turn towards a metallic hop monster, but stops short of overbearing then finishes clean and refreshing with a slight malt/metallic aftertaste. Lovely mouthfeel."
"I spotted this in my local store (Brawley's) and gave it a whirl. It poured with a little head, showing that it wasn't overly carbonated. The aroma immediately gave me hints of chocolate, some toasting, and a little floral tones. It had a great malty taste right away on the palate, a little nutty and with a nice chocolate finish. In the aftertaste, you get some of the hops, but a good continuing malty flavor. So smooth. When in Germany, I had the pleasure of going to Kloister Andechs. That was probably my favorite Dunkel of all, but this Ettaler stacks up nicely. If you find it, definitely pick one or ten of them up."
"Thanks go to RedBaron for the bottle."
"Dgood. Easily a session beer, the $4.99 bottle makes it too expensive to do so (for me anyway)"
"D: Very drinkable ""dark beer"". A great beer to initiate people into drinking something better than macro swill."
"A very good beer for only $2.99 a pint."
"For the style, this is probably the most enjoyable I've had. Easy to drink and definitive for the style."
"Appearance and mouthfeel were typical for the style. The aroma and flavor were awful. As I poured, I thought something must have gone bad in my kitchen, but a stale malt flavor was rising from the glass. The flavor reminded me most of rancid raisins. The date on the bottle was 10 10 05 (not sure if that is a drink by, or a made on date.) I will try re-reviewing this in the future, as I may have had a bad bottle, but I doubt it. One of only two or three beers I have ever dumped."
"Taste; very malty, with caramel, chocolate and bread dough. The raisins and nutty flavors came through, but were not very strong. There was almost no bitterness to speak of, and the finish was on the sweet side. While this wasn't the most complex beer out there, it was a very enjoyable drink. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, and very drinkable."
"In Berg und Wald und Strom und Feld."
"16.9 ounce bottle."
"(B'ham UK) tried while in Tampa FL May 2006"
"Its been awhile since I had a good German dunkel so I picked this up yesterday,poured a nice clear medium brown/bronze with smallish light brown head that was gone pretty fast.Light aromas but pleasant milk chocolate,cookie dough,and some raw earthy nut mainly,soft malty flavors to this beer from the get go a lightly sweet cookie dough base over top of milk chocolate with a very noticable and nicely suprising herbal anicy note in the finish.A very easy drinking ""soft"" beer with real character,recommended if you like traditional dunkel lagers."
"Man, this is one good drinker. Not perfect, the mouthfeel, while wonderful, is a touch thick for a true session."
"Slate black and nice initial head with bubbles. Sweet malt, including chocolate malts, and molasses with appropriate carbonation and creamy, then just plain and bitter finish. On-tap taste. Fresh and a new brewer found at Knightly Spirits in Orlando."
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer, but not soon to be my go-to either."
"Since 1330, eh? Wow! I will try the rest of this brewery's offerings, and hope that they all measure up as well."
"Mmmm, dunkel. Pours a caramelly dark brown with a luscious tan head that sticks around throughout drinking. Smell is all dark malts, with molasses and caramel present, but highly attenuated by a dry, roasty malt note. The taste of this beer is quite pleasant and malty, with caramel and dried date leading the way in the flavor department. This beer is very, very smooth and easy drinking. I can't think of a better example of the dunkel style that I've tried. Highly recommended."
"Ettaler Kloster Dunkel is a great beer if you can find it. I was pleasantly surprised to find it at one of the better liquor stores in my area, as I had never expected to see it again after my visit to Kloster Ettal a year and a half ago. If you like malty, sweet, clean lagers youll definitely like Ettaler Kloster Dunkel."
"PROST! Beertracker"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Very, very easy and smooth... just the right amount of carbonation, yet it remains particularly light in the mouth. For the style, which I am certainly no expert, it seems appropriate. Drinkability is effortless and enjoyable, and I want another one of these to join me at this year's local Traubenfest... October can't arrive soon enough!"
"Big whiff of honeycakes and brown sugar in the aroma. Quite appealing smell. Dark brown to copper with a pinky thin white head. Fore is honey, malt sweet. Very substantial tasting like the aforementioned honeycake though the mouthfeel isnt thick or at least no thicker than it should be. Some caramel malt notes in there as well. The range is narrow, but the beer is very tasty."
"An aggressive pour in my 23 ounce pilsner glass resulted in a HUGE off-white head, which faded into a soft ring that left nice lacing. Malt and pine hops on the nose, with rye bread. Smells kind of like a bock. Taste is clean hopped malt, with notes of chocolate and coffee. Dry finish, with light hop bitterness. Really pretty nice. Mouthfeel is good and round, pretty outstanding for a lager. Very easy to drink, with not too much carbonation and only 5.0%. This would make a nice session beer!"
"D - An all around very nice performer in all categories. This is an excellent beer for the style, although admittedly, I need to seek out and try more for comparison. I hope they are all this solid."
"Saw this while beer shopping, never seen it before so I'm giving it a shot. Pours dark brown, smells sweet. Tastes like burnt malt and caramel. If theres any hops they are hidden but who cares. Nice mouthfeel and finish. I'm looking for more of this. Easy drinking and yummy!!"
"Not much to say, but I likes it."
"Pours with a three-finger white head that leaves some lace. Deep clear amber color. Medium bodied and light carbonation. Slightly malty nose. Starts sweet, nice malt/hop balance finishes mellow and not dry. $2.79 for a 500ml bottle from Tulley's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"[As I edit this -- the more I drink it, the more I like it. Still not above good, but enough to bump the score. Solid option.]"
"solid in all categories. It doesnt blow me away in any one but it really is just plain all around very good. I will definitely be getting this again now that I know it is right down the street @ the store!"
"Gorgeous chestnut brown color with a great tan head. Nice mellow,somewhat bready, soft malty aroma. Very nice, sweet malt flavor-almost caramel and chocolate like. No real hop presence. Finishes sweet. Very good body for style. Extremely drinkable beer. Has to be the best dunkel I have had. I have heard almost fantasy-like stories of having Ettaler beers in Germany-sampling this makes them very believable!"
"A very solid beer. Munich malts make the bread tones evident and the extra darker toasty nuttyness gives it an almost porter-esk character. Quite a nice treat. Spendy though."
"Ettaler Kolster Dunkel is good beer if given a chance. It's the antithesis of big beer, but calling it little beer is an undeserved slight. There can't be too many versions out there that are superior to this one."
"Poured out to more of a amber red, than a dark brown. Short lived head resulted in a thin layer of foam after a few moments. Minor lacing around the glass. Medium carbonation. Aromas of, well, not much. Traces of sweet malt and light hops were noted. Woulda been a helluva lot better if i didn't have to struggle to get some type of smell. Flavor was a nice pick-up point area for this brew. Notes of un-sweet caramel, medium malt and some smoke-like spice was also noted toward the finish, albeit weak. Nice mouthfeel, very crisp and refreshing. This could be a nice place to start for those looking for a gateway into German Dark Beers. Recommended."
"Drinkability  This was an enjoyable and credible example of the MDL style."
"I actually had this on tap a few nights ago, and now I am enjoying the bottle version (I'll have to add the tap version at some point). Nice chocolate color, the 1/2 inch head left pretty quick. I am picking up some rich malt, actually almost a low vinous and pleasant note in there as well. Drinking this is like eating a hearty dark bread, although the mouthfeel is actually rather light. The carbonation is also rather modest. Nice hint of milk chocolate in the aftertaste."
"Highly highly recommended on draft."
"im left with a clean mouth.. yummy but not my favorite style. a noble effort though, and should be recognized as such."
"It finishes dry, with a flash of toffee that's followed by a note of mild, bitter, dark chocolate; raspy, grassy hops; and a long-lingering, dull bitterness."
"Mouthfeel features a creamy, medium body with a mellow carbonation that makes this an easy drinking beer. The bottle is almost empty and I could easily drink another. Not an incredible brew..but tasty, refreshing and drinkable. Worth a try."
