"Semi sweet malty goodness. This beer has it all, from the aroma, to taste and finish. Very enjoyable Dunkel. Ayinger nailed the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"500 ml bottle from Cost Plus. Dark, dark brown. Shows signs of clarity with a big, off-white head. Good lacing. Nose of toasty, fruity malt and yeast. Flavors of bread crust and light caramel with hints of dark fruit, plum and touch of raisin. Hops are hardly noticeable, maybe a touch of grassy spiciness. Residual sweetness produces a fairly heavy body feel. Finishes semi-sweet. A very tasty, yet easy drinking lager beer."
""
"Very good beers it's heavy dark beer but easy to drink. Very smooth."
"O- A very easy drinking beer that satisfies one's desire for a sturdy malt presence."
"Quite sweet, toasty caramel, lots of bread, silky almost sticky mouthfeel"
""
""
""
""
""
"At first, the raisin and dark bread flavor is a little much for me, but the more I drink it the more I like it. Nice drinkable German beer."
"O: Solid Dunkel Lager! Rich without being heavy. Complex without being overwhelming. Very sessionable."
"Nice dark amber, good beer,"
""
""
""
"O – I tend to gravitate toward the darker “brown” beers of Germany, the bocks and dunkels, and this is no exception.  A very straight-forward and traditional interpretation with a ton of great malt flavor and the right amount of residual sweetness and bitterness.  Very, very good."

"sometimes you just find yourself in the mood for a dunkel, and this is always a safe bet to reach for. all the beers these guys do are real traditional and well done, and this is one of their best. its really really clear in its deep amber color. the head is tall and white, but it doesnt last all that long in my glass this time. it smells like german lager yeast first, a sweetish middle coppery malt base, and then an almost hefeweizen yeast where subtle dried banana notes and white pepper spice ease in. the flavor complexion is just like the nose, maybe a little light on the yeast profile in this one compared to other examples of the style, but its subtlety there allows the fresh caramely grain to be a little more forward. i dont think their are multiple yeasts in this, but it sure tastes and feels like there are. overall this is awesome, a super drinkable dunkel too right at 5% abv. most perfect in the fall, but these are fun to crack all year too. also a wonderful food beer, diverse in its pairing capability. a fine beer to keep around for the holidays too because of its quality, uniqueness, and probable mass appeal."

"Poured a deep clear brown with a light tan head. The head mostly burns off but leaves some nice sticky tight lacing. The is mild, reminding me of deep malt tones, turned way down. The taste, though, brings it back up, with some night fruit, bread and earthy hops. The body isn't heavy but it has a nice thickness to it."
""
"overall: this is amazingly tasty, awesome!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a rusty brown with a medium off white head. Aroma and Taste is sweet mildly roasted malt and grains, some notes of dark plum fruit, light raisin, light bitterness. Palate is a mild crisp mouth feel and carbonation and a medium body. Finish mild roasted dark malt and grains, some caramel, dark fruit plums, ends with mild roasted dark malt and light bitterness. Goes down smooth and easy. A very good and tasty brew."
""
""
""
"Overall this is the best Dunkel I've tasted.  I feel like most tend toward coffee/nutty/chocolatey or sweet/raisin/fig - this one is kind of in between.  More bready than nutty with very little raisin taste.  I'm not a big fan of the raisin taste, so this is  welcome spectrum for a Dunkel.  Drinking this is like eating a big piece of fresh baked, dark, crusty bread without the need to chew."
""
""
"Overall - A massive malt bomb, and a very tasty one at that. Feels a bit heavy though at 5% ABV with ample residual sugar producing a fairly heavy body feel. Really tasty beer, but I don't think I could have more than one."
"good beer. I'm a little under the weather so it is impacting my taste. Will try again in the future."
"Medium full body, medium low carbonation, clean and smooth."

"T: Good and clean Munich malt taste. Complex breadiness, mostly brown bread and sweet nutty flavors-flax and millet. Mild caramel, toffee, and ginger. Moderately sweet. Just enough hops to hold it in check at the end. Light bitter, raw water chestnut finish. Carbonation introduces a restrained level of minerality. Lasting sensation of chocolate and cherries."
"M: Somewhat light, with neutral texture."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – For a dunkel lager this is on the slightly sweeter side, but very drinkable and quite enjoyable. A rather good easy drinking darker lager."
"On tap at McNellie's OKC. Pours a deep reddish brown with a creamy off-white head. Good lacing that cascades down the glass. Smells of malt, caramel and toffee. Taste follows the nose, along with a bit of toasted grain. Medium mouth that's very smooth. Quite a drinkable dunkel."
"Overall, a great dunkel, Ayinger never disappoints."
""
""
""
"O-This is a pleasant beer...nothing to chase trucks over, but certainly worth a drink. I can see drinking a lot of this in the fall when the weather starts to cool down. It would pair well with football watching."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - If I tried to brew a porter/lager hybrid, this is what I'd aim for. Unfortunately, I'd never want to do this. This is another that I'd not complain if it was all there was, but it lacks ""muchness"". Needs all of its flavours to be bolder. I enjoyed the Paulaner Salvator doppel bock style much more."
""
""
""
"Overall- Good beer overall, not very complex flavors but the ones I detect compliment each other well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium-light carbonation. Stocky body for a dunkel lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad, but considering all the other beers Ayinger makes, it was a bit hard to get too excited about this one."
""
""
""
""
"very nice dunkel with dark fruit and spice notes, olive, very smooth with a bit of bite. hints of cherry and caramel malt. pours light brown, dark amber red orange into a stemmed pilsner glass. aromas aren't very present, just hints of nutmeg, brownsugar, cherry, etc. really well balanced"
""
""
""
"Smooth Dunkel. Brown carmel color with a foggy appearance. Sweet almost salty scent resembles potato chips. Flavor is sweet but not overbearing and somewhat salty continuing with the potato chip resemblance. Not a lot of bitter or hoppy flavor makes it an easy drink"
""
"Revisiting one of my first German beers from my college days. Ah, nostalgia... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunrise topaz-sienna topped by a finger or so of off-white foam. The noe comprises mild nuts, wheat bread, light fruits (in the vaguest possible sense), and ahint of hard water. The taste brings in more of the same, the nuts and bread combining into a toffee/brittle situation and the fruit coming out a bit stronger. I think I get some dark greens in there, as well. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick-ish feel. Overall, a really solid dunkel, basically exactly what you'd expect from Ayinger."
""
""
""
""
"The dryness is present in the mouthfeel, and the body is medium but leans lighter than I expect. It has more than a modicum of both crispness and smoothness."
""
""
""
"A very easy drinking pleasant dunkel which loses points for the frapidly diminishing head and crappy lacing."
""
""
""
"Finishes with a bitterish darkness in the back of the throat. Beautiful brew with that tall foam and red-brown glowing color. From the 500 ml bottle purchased at Ibis Market in Mission Hills."
"I love rich, malty lagers and I don't know why I don't drink them more often than I do. This one has all those wonderful melanoidins as well as extreme drinkability. It doesn't have a ton of malt complexity, but I can't penalize it for that because it's not a bock or doppelbock. It's just a classic example of the dark lager style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"the flavors could be appropriate for a doppelbock.... i'd almost want more body, but that may ruin it, who knows?"
""
""
"I'm starting to see brands from this brewery more often in my town. Keep sending them please!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great beer. I'd love to try this out on tap."
""
""
""

""
"Overall: Pretty solid enjoyable. Tasty and very drinkable."
"A really enjoyable malt focused beer, as expected from the style."
""
"D: This is session beer. Meant for an evening at the beer hall. would be great with sausages and cheeses. (which is what I enjoyed it with). Recommended."
"A go-to beer during the colder months, this is superior to most fall and winter seasonal fare. An excellent malt-forward lager than never fatigues the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I love Ayinger for several reasons, the least of which is not the bottle and label. Something overtly ""Germanish"" about it, with its 17 oz dark glass bottle and poorly illustrated picture of what I can only assume is Brewery Aying. If you're looking for the gold standard of Dunkels, look no further."
""
"Overall, delightfully tasty with lots of chocolate, nuts, and toffee."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark reddish-brown with about a 1-finger tan head. Lots of lacing is seen from this ""Dark Lager"" brew as is typical from Germany. The aroma is of toffee, roasted malts and caramel. The taste is pretty much the same with a slight bitter finish but wasn't unpleasant at all. Actually goes down pretty easy. I have had a few other brews from Ayinger in the past and like the others, it didn't disappoint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This has become my new favorite beer, even though i'm relatively new at this. I expected nothing less from this brew. 4/5"
""
"O - I enjoy Aying brews. I can't say this is better than their gems, but its respectable. It was a good choice for dinner and something I'd definitely drink again. It has the same texture and thickness that make Ayinger a renowned German brewery, and its good sampling something from Germany that's not a Hefe for a change. Good brew!"
""
""
""
"The beer appears a chestnut brown color with perhaps a touch of ruby. Thin tan head that rapidly fades to a wispy layer, giving a nearly still appearance. The aroma brings some lager yeast, brown bread, mild sweetness. The taste follow suit, with a prominent brown bread character. A touch of sweet and ripened dark fruit. Light in body with low carbonation. A decent beer to pair with some German cuisine. This was okay."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- As usual, Ayinger has produced a top notch version of a Munich Dunkel, This beer is one of the reasons Dunkel's are one of my favorite styles."
""
""
""
"O: This beer surprised me. It's simple but very tasty. Lots of malt flavors with good balance. Goes down super easy; great drinkability. Great example of the style."
""
""
""
"This is one amazing beer. It has an incredible lightness. It has every flavor that you love about dark beer, from dark fruit to coffee and yet it's light. It's not chewy, it's not thick, it's not too sweet. The dry finish is something to behold as all that perfect toasted grain settles in to last and linger in the aftertaste. Full, spirited and vibrant."
""
""
"Looks and smells better than it tastes. Wanted more out of the glass. A good beer but not my favorite from one of my favorite breweries."
""
""
""
"Taste is roasty and dry, light bodied and straightforward. Very clean with a slight toasted marshmallow impression though not especially sweet at all. Carbonation seems light as well, though it helps the drinkability. Word is that draft may hit the states in January. Made a great pairing with spicy goulash at Laschet's."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an amber-brown with limited light tan head. Aroma is deeply malty with a potent ripe raisin/prune scent that is boozy and cloying but pleasant. Very interesting aroma for a thin-bodied lager. Palate is chalky chocolate, more prune/raisin fruit, brown bread (pumpernickel), a hint of cola spice, a sour top note that almost evokes fresh citrus but probably more like rancid marmalade, nice deep dark flavors. Some brown sugar and coffee show up and cling to the palate along with a bit of cardboard. The faintest whiff of apricot. Minimal hop bitterness. I like this style and this is a good exemplar. Ayinger is workmanlike, never bad and always cleaving close to style guidelines. Carbonation is right where it needs to be. A nuttiness like bitter walnuts accumulates and builds a bit ... Some metallic notes that maybe detract a bit but one can always return to the fermented prune aroma and be intrigued."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall- A good, solid beer that is a proper introduction to the style. Definitely worth at try."
""
""
""
""
"Mouth & Overall: refreshing enough, semi-clean on the palate, medium-bodied, showing a balanced flavour profile, but altogether not something I’d drink for more than a pint. This is yet another beer style that doesn’t do well in the bottled and pasteurized form. It’s just… not delicious and not “lively” (not referring to the carbonation) enough."
""
""
"This beer tasted flat and boring. I've had better dunkels."
""
""
""
"A balanced and easy drinking Dunkel."
""
""
"O - This a great dark German lager. Extremely flavorful and well balanced. Really easy to drink too."
""
"Well crafted, goes down easy. I could drink a few of these."
""
""
"To the Point: a good Alt Dunkel, tasty, easy to drink,"

"-Overall 4.0: Great beer. While I drank it, I kept imagining drinking it while eating some sauerbraten and black bread or a smoked shank of pork with sauerkraut. I really enjoyed this beer on its own and believe it would be an excellent session beer, but cannot wait to try it with food. Maybe the next time I am in Black Mountain, I will. Regardless, if you see this beer, pick it up."
""
"I am not an expert in Munich Dunkels but this satisfies a lot of the styles characteristics. Just thinking about it as a beer it is balanced and drinks refreshingly, not a surprise when it comes to this brewery."
""
""
""
""
"Overall quite nice, true to a nice dark dunkel, great malt characters, soft complex decoction mash profile, nice sweetener flavors without the sweetness, faint dark fruits come through, and even the slightest hop profile. very drinkable and I could pound this back in minutes if I'm not careful. This is what I imagine drinking on a slightly chilly spring morning in Germany."
"This brew is beautiful. Deep dark, and then deep cherry red under the light. The taste is well-rounded; nothing stands out in dominance, but each part compliments the other; I was surprised by the fruity and floral aspects. Overall, this is beautiful lager that would make me want to drink a lager. I would get this again. I also love the new design on the bottle. It's a cleaned up and simplified revision of the previous one."
""
""
""
""
"My overall impression is that I need to drink more Ayinger."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of these once in a while would be fine, a sort of re-familiarizing with the style. I imagine it'd best enjoyed in a beer hall with pretzels."
""
""
""
"The aftertaste is mild and not unpleasant. Overall the beer does not work - it did not survive the trip and marketing very well. They should not bother with the export unless it can be done better (maybe a can). I will not buy it again."
""
""
""
"My initial pour created two dense fingers of light-brown head with excellent retention. Color was a deep-brown with ruby highlights and NE-quality clarity. Nose was rich with a caramel/toffee-like sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium and the flavor was definitely malty. Caramel, toffee, molasses and even a touch of smoke were all in evidence on the tongue. Finish was sweet, but not cloyingly sweet. I liked it, but one 500 ml bottle would be plenty for me at one sitting. I might return to it, but not if other things were also available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is extremely drinkable and would be very fitting as a session beer. Good flavor, definitely enough to satisfy the taste buds, and a light enough body to do it multiple times."
""
"very enjoyable"
""
""
""
"Overall a great tasting and balanced beer."
""
"O - This is the standard bearer for the style, and with good reason. Its is balanced, easy to drink, and has a distinctly old world Bavarian feel."
"O: Easy to drink, though rather filling from the heavy dose of malts in the beer. Enjoyable and it is the classic example for the style in my opinion."
"O: Overall a very enjoyable dark beer that's not heavy but is very flavorful. Another fine brew from Ayinger."
"Pours a clear dark brown color with a smallish off white head that quickly dissipates to a ring on top. Smells of dark dried fruits and darker and burnt sugars mostly. There's a light bready malt aroma, but that is quickly drowned out by the other smells. The flavor follows the aroma quite well Dark sugars, caramel, crystallized sugar, prunes and raisins all meld together wonderfully. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet burnt sugary mouthfeel. This is a very nice, clean flavorful German Lager."
"Maybe this beer just caught me off guard, but I found it to be just plain odd. Average to above average in appearance and smell, but the taste just left me flat. A tad overcarbonated, a little citrus zing at the finish and even though it has dunkel lager attributes, somehow this Ayinger misses my mark. I do love a good dark lager, and I look forward to enjoying more, but I'll leave this one alone, there are better options."
""
""
"O: I was not so sure about this one when I smelled it, but the taste was good and it went down very easily. Worth another tasting."
""
""
""
""
"O: a decent dark lager, I've had better Ayinger products but this is a mild very drinkable lager"
""
""
""
"O: Its a quality beer, its delicious, refreshing, could be my regular drinking beer if It was more readily available."
""
"Price Point - $3.19/16.9oz bottle"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall this is nice, except for the finish. I'll pick up another to try- if the finish is more pleasant, it will become a regular session beer, if not I'll pass."
""
""
"Overall - A fairly good dark lager. More sweet than bitter. Interesting, though lacks the ""it"" factor that puts it into elite status. For that reason, I doubt I'd buy this again; not when it shares the same shelf space with the other Ayinger beers that are amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall, EVERYTHING from ayinger is very good. straight-forward and simple, almost commercial (are they big in germany?) and, like paulaner, always a good bet when in doubt what to drink. i approve this message and beer."
""
""
"O: a finely crafted beer with great balance."
""
""
""
"Ayinger dunked would make for an ideal session beer due to its rich and interesting, yet not too heavy or overly complex flavor profile, smoothness, and low ABV. Despite doing everything well and being very drinkable, I don't see myself returning to this often as it isn't remarkable enough to warrant trips up to ABQ to pay $3.00 for a 500 ml bottle. For now, slightly inferior Negro Modelo will remain my Munich dunkel of choice."
""
""
""
"Poured into a glass mug. Pours clear toffee brown with a tall, creamy tan head. Some tiny bubbles are visible in this beer. The head dissipates slowly. The aroma is dominated by bready malts and caramel malts. I can pick up faint chocolate notes. The flavor of this beer is bready and sweet. There is a nice mild caramel sweetness and faint chocolate notes. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is smooth, creamy, and crisp. The drinkability is high. This is an excellent beer."
"O - Another good beer from the folks at Ayinger. Nothing has yet to the top the notorious Celebrator, but if I am looking for a dark lager, I know where to find it."
""
"500 ml bottle into pilsener glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly clear reddish brown color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing on the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up retaining the head. Aromas of big brown bread, caramel, toast, molasses, chocolate, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, and light herbal hops. Damn nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of big brown bread, caramel, toast, biscuit, molasses, chocolate, roast, toffee, nuttiness, and earthy herbal spiciness. Light earthy spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of toast, biscuit, caramel, molasses, nuttiness, chocolate, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a short bit. Fantastic amount of pretty robust flavors; with great balance and complexity. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding Dunkel Lager. I have never had this style before, but this is nicely robust and complex; and extremely easy to drink. Very clean for a lager as well. Such a delicious brew, if only it was more widely available."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability is unparalleled. Overall experience in exceptional. Great depth of flavors in perfect harmony. This is exactly what a dunkel should be."
""
"D- Excellent dunkel. Solid balanced flavour profile that sends me back to Munich. Could drink this all day."
""
"One of the better lagers I've had. Had good flavors and was easy to drink. Would like to have more than just one."
"O: a nice offering from Ayinger. As it warms it gets softer, but the flavors come out. Cold, it's crisper and more taught, but with some of the dried fruits blending into more of a single fruit leather note."
"Medium-heavy body with an effervescence that is tangy almost on the tip of the tongue but much more subdued elsewhere. Aftertaste is peat/earth and light hops. Slightly drying with just a light coating of the upper palate. Very good brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light feel, very good carbonation and very easy to drink. I prefer the Dortmunder export, but this is still a very good beer."
"Overall: That dismal dunkel from the 2012 Longshot six-pack was the impetus for this purchase and the difference is night and day."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Excellent. Almost like a light version of Celebrator. Very drinkable, shows that a high malt presence can be just as good as any IPA."
"O - A fine, malty, tasty and easily drinkable beer"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Luxurious lightly chocolate n toffee flavored beer with a toasted aroma and finish. A amazing beer on an epic scale..."
""
"quite an excellent dark lager. picked this guy up on clearance for $1.50 a bottle! recommended."
""
""
"O: This beer is amazing. Chocolate bready awesomeness. Gotta love German beers."
""
""
"Deep chestnut brown in color with a slight orange hue and perfect clarity. Poured with a rich light beige foam that slowly reduced to a wispy cap. Sweet caramel and toasted malt aromas are dominant with a hint of ripe fruit underneath. Smooth, delicate feel with lively but gentle carbonation. Huge malt flavor. Similar to aroma, the sweet caramel and toasted malt flavors are the showcase. Light coffee flavor with a very subtle hint of hops at the finish. Finishes clean and semi-dry. A very enjoyable german lager."
"Nice light body easily could polish off a few of these guys at a nice German biergarten. Flavors are not complex but very nicely done."
"M / O. Thin, almost watery beer, which is quite to style. Great carbonation lends an 'all in' feeling to this one, but at the same time is reserved enough for this to be drunk very quickly. The finish is toasty and the malt sweetness lolls about lazily on the palate. Bottom line: Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel is absolutely one of the best Dunkels I've had to date. This brewery knows what they are doing."
"A very nice change when I want to cleanse the palate with something totally drinkable after a hop bomb or two."
""
""
"I have to say I am not a huge fan of this beer. It is too sweet for my liking and not quite enough roast."
""
""
""
"Pours a light brown with a slight lighter brown head. Nutty and malty aroma. Caramel and bread. Flavor follows the nose. Nice nutty notes, followed by caramel and bready sweetness. Toffee in there as well. A lesser, but pronounced hint of dark fruit sweetness finishes off this malty beast. Medium bodied, not a thick sweet blend, but more of a smoother maltiness."
""
""
"Light to medium bodied with average carbonation. A bit of a toasted bread aftertaste. Not a bad beer, but I'm not sure if I will try this again. Ayinger has better offerings in my opinion."

"Candy is not good! I’m not just talking about beer, I’m talking everything. Sugary tasting things aren’t enjoyable for me. I get these things FAR less in beer though. At least candy has a market….5 year old kids. This is beer, why does it taste like they are making it for people who eat shit like cake? BTW for the idiots who think I’m joking in my reviews, that was funny because it is true. This beer sucks. Candy is sweet and uncomplex stuff, this beer is much the same. No depth or anything to grab on to."
"O: Pretty good representation of the style"
"O: Now this is a dunkel! This is a really great all around beer. Much more refreshing than I thought it would be. Perfect during fall and winter."
"Overall I am loving this fruity and nut, and milky, and coffee, and malty combination (is that a run out sentence or what?!). Tasty brew!"
"O - Overall this has got to be the cleanest tasting Dunkel Iv ever had. I liked it's smooth flavors of moderate sweetness, tartness, low bitterness and clean dry finish. Pretty darn good, I would definitely buy this one again. Cheers!"
"Overall a really good beer for the season but not something I'd drink all the time."
"Overall, it's a decent beer, but having just had the Oktoberfest Marzen, I had higher expectations. This one doesn't measure up to that beer in my estimation. Still really good for a dunkel."
"Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel is a well made beer all around . one of the best of this style ."
"This beer pours a clear brown with a thick head and a bit of lacing. The aroma is of molasses, toast, and dark chocolate. The flavor has molasses, roasted malt, and root beer notes with a hint of anise. It's got a light-medium mouthfeel with mild, Coke-like carbonation. Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel is a good beer, typical of the style, and very drinkable. Recommended!"
"The finish saves the beer somewhat, with its big caramel and hazelnut flavors, but the hop profile is a little watery."
"Mouthfeel is clean and crisp with a light bodied feel. Overall, I've always enjoyed the Ayinger Dunkel, especially at $3 a bottle. That being said, the long journey has not done this beer any favors and it leaves me longing for the fresh dunkels on tap found all over Germany and Austria."
"Overall: Very complex Munich malt flavors with nice hint of sweet toffee yeasty bread crust-like characters. Very enjoyable."
"Long on flavor, lasting on my palate for more than 30 minutes after the final taste, which was nearly room temperature. This lifted the curtain and confirmed my overall impression - worth seeking out again - a very fine brew."
"Oh, hello, who are you? I must find out. I take it to the out of doors and pop the top, glass at hand. What a beautiful pour. Burnt umber with ruby highlights, a wispy, creamy head. Delightful. The beer quenches my thirst beautifully with its toasty Munich malts and floral hop balance. Starts like it's going to be sweet but actually finishes only ever so slightly sweet. I finish the bottle easily and with great relish. A quality brew."
"This beer pours to a beautiful, bright, deep chestnut color with a nice white head, and a good bit of carbonation. The nose on this beer is excellent with lots of good aromas of sweet malt, light toast and nuts. The palate is round and clean with lots of good sweet malt, toast and nutty malt flavor. This beer finishes with more good malt character then ends with enough herbal hop bittereness to round this one out to perfection. A great match to hearty German fare, and BBQ dishes."
"Pours a clear dark orange with a 2 inch light tan head that fades to a thin cap. Random strings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smells of malt and caramel notes. Perhaps a bit of an earthy aroma. Taste is of biscuit-like malt, caramel, and some earthy/woody tastes. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good lager from Ayinger and my first of the style. I would get this one again."
"Poured into an Ayinger weizen glass at schaeffer's Tavern, Staten Island. Fits perfectly in the glass pouring a clear toffee brown body with a booming light coffee colored, well-retained head. Smells wonderfully malty, with caramel, toffee notes. A sweet and refreshing lager there's a small hop bite right in the front as the beer arrives on the tongue. Properly carbonated, the moderate bodied beer has a crispness that goes well in a breezy bar on an 80 degree summer day."
"0.5l bottle served in pilsner glass. Pours a clear amber color with about two fingers of fizzy and quickly diminishing, light brown head. Aroma is caramel, bread, a hint of toffee, nutty, and a hint of roast. Flavor is caramel, nutty, bread, roasted malt, some dark fruits, a hint of spiciness, a little bit of smoke, and some light noble and grassy hops. Mouthfeel is medium, dry, and slightly bitter finish."
"O: A very nice beer. I would definitely enjoy one of these again."
"O: A very enjoyable beer. 4.5"
"As always Ayinger makes a great brew. Tasty, roasted and nutty, this is an enjoyable Dunkel that you should try if you have the chance."
"This beer pours a light bodied cherry brown in color with a one finger creamy off white head. It smells of slightly sweet caramel malts, toffee, and cream. It is very soft on the nose. It also has a light nuttiness. The flavor is of light candied almonds, perhaps pecans, and has a nice caramel, toffee finish. It's pretty flavorful for being so light in body. It is a very smooth drink and very easy to drink. Overall this beer was much better than I anticipated. It's worth a try."
"Pours a bright reddish-copper color when held up to the light. Out of the light, it's a chestnut brown. Thin tan head but no real lacing. Cap sticks around throughout. The nose brings some lightly-sweet malt along with some caramel and a hint of nuts. The flavor is a bit sweet, focusing mostly on malt sweetness and a touch of caramel and toffee. Mouthfeel is light to medium with moderate carbonation. Pretty decent, but nothing I'd go out of my way for."
"O: Not sure where that fruit character was coming from. Perhaps an old bottle? I'll have to revisit this one."
"O - A very pleasant Dunkel. So smooth, soft and sweet. Its grainy and sweet and everything you want in a dunkel. This brew packs alot of flavor in a light body."
"Split this bottle with a friend. Nice beer, it tastes like (and really is) a classic dunkel lager. It looks dark brown in my glass with a short tan head. It's dry and drinkable with a mildly bitter finish (hint of spicy hops) and crisp cocoa and toasty, bready malts. Clean, delicious and sessionable, heck of a lager."
"This beer pours a ruby-brown color. The head is one inch of light tan foam that recedes slowly into a firm cap of lacing. The aroma is caramel, toffee, and a nice mineral quality. Very pleasing. The taste is similar to the aroma, but lighter. It is still nice, but a bit too light for the style. The mouthfeel is on the lighterside of medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a watery texture. Overall, this is a nice beer, but there are much better dunkels out there that are far richer in depth of character than this one. I would most likely pass on drinking this beer again."
"Overall- This beer is an absolute winner. If you can find it, pick it up. You'll impress your friends on how smart you are when it comes to beer. Like I said before, Germany is #1 when it comes to beer in the world. Awesome, I am a fan for life."
"d - went down pretty quickly and easily, could drink another but it's not calling my name, the sweetness seemed to be a little reminiscent of a cola to me, but otherwise good"
"D: Nice malty roasted flavor that feels great in the mouth. All around really solid and refreshing."
"Has a nice medium dark amber color with a reddish hue. Light tan foam that disapated in a short time. The smell had a roasted coffee and caramel aroma, with a hint of fruit. But the taste was not really what the aroma was. There was the roasted malts, with a touch of yeast and a hint of caramel. This Dunkel is not what I expected in a Ayinger Beer. Just not enough flavor, sort of being boring! No better than average."
"Flavors were good but seems a tad watery. The dark malts were comforting in a way. Good nose. Rich aftertastes of toffee and caramel."
"D -- Very good. Probably the best example of the style available to us in bottles. This sample is not the freshest, but it hasn't gone as south as some I've tried -- I just don't think it sells here in the US. Too bad, because the style is rich and satisfying."
"D - Overall, a tasty dunkel and worth a try if you like the style and have access to it. The dark, roasted, flavours provide for unique experience."
"drinkability; crisp and refreshing, very comforting, alcohol is well hidden. I drank 6 of these one after another, had a bite to eat and drank 3 more, amazingly drinkable and delicious."
"taste is toffee, nutty, bready. complex for a lager following the Purity Law. medium body, good carbonation level. very drinkable for a dark flavorful lager."
"Overall it has a very nice balance and is easy drinking. A great all-year-round kind of beer that would be refreshing on a warm summer day or could even be enjoyed at cellar temp on a cold day in January. Ayinger really makes consistantly great beers and this is no exception."
"All in all, one of the most drinkable beers I have ever had. All the flavors work very well, and they are neither over or under stated."
"Aroma is malty with smooth bready notes as well as some caramel. The flavor seems less potent than the nose suggests, with a moderately bready malt flavor behind a light bodied, smooth mouthfeel. Very drinkable despite it's malty, bread like profile."
"D - Great. This is a great style as the dark color and subsequent sweetness might appeal to those who are same of the same lagers."
"D: Pretty easily drinkable, but not the best among dunkels."
"Mouthfeel is thin and correct to style. More drying than most Dunkel lagers but still drinkable by the liter! Made for pub drinking this is a great example of this style yet not the best I have had."
"D I like this beer for the nice roasted malt flavor. It is easy to drink and happens to be great with popcorn."
"500 ml bottle. Pours clear, dark amber hue with a lasting, foamy, off-white head. Toasted malt aroma with a hint of grassy hops. Medium, creamy, smooth body. Flavors are of grain, toasted malt, spicy hops with hints of toffee. Long, dry, spicy finish."
"A proper accompaniment for some brats and sauerkraut."
"A simple dark lager that is extremely well executed and very tasty."
"Drink it like a munich helles with a predominate fruit sweetness. Good beer, easy to drink, enjoyable flavor."
"For as dark as it is, it's still crystal clear. Traditional brown color like the bottle it comes in with a tint of red. The head was a light tan or off white color that disappeared quickly. the nose is a burnt tobacco, earthy and leathery with some malty nuttiness. It was sweeter then I anticipated . A surprise hint of bitterness also. I get some brown sugar and molasses mixed in at the end. It leaves a sweetness on the lips and tongue but there is not a lot of lingering. This one surprised me. Good Beer!"
"D: very easy to drink, have yet to find a german lager of any kind that wasnt east to drink."
"Overall - A great example of this style. A superb choice if you want a beer that combines dark beer flavors, with lager-like drinkability."
"Not a bad dunkel. Everything is well balanced and could also be a great session beer with lots of flavor."
"Pours a deep mahogany reddish brown color with a small light tan head. Really clear body with perfect clarity. Aroma is caramelized malts, roasted peanuts and sow cashew aromas. Flavor is spot on with the aroma. Has a malty sweetness but a nice fresh bitterness that works well with the beer. Mouthfeel is light like a helles but has a nice viscosity to it that makes it fuller. Overall This is a great beer and really worth seeking out."
"D: crap, I'll have to try a real bottle of this when I get back to Germany. then I'll re-review"
"D- very drinkable, could easily put several of these down and not notice."
"Price is the only thing keeping this from a 5 for me in drinkablilty. Not a lot of MDL's to choose from in Alberta, but this one will be tuff to beat. Why anyone would drink Modelo, unless on vacation in Mexico, is beyond me. No Contesto!"
"D: An easy drinker."
"D- This is the first brew I've tried from Ayinger and I'm impressed. Full flavored, good mouthfeel, nice aromas...this beer has it all and is the best dark lager I've had by far. I would definitely like to have this throughout an evening on its own and I think it would even be better with a meal....it would probably get a little filling after a couple pints though."
"D - a nice mix of sweet and dark roasted flavours, a rich beer that I really enjoyed and would purchase again"
"as said earlier, this is my new favorite dunkel. If I'm craving a dark beer, I'll definitely be grabbing this when available. I'm wishing I had another bottle to try. almost full-bodied, but definitely smooth and tasty."
"O: Another impressive offering from Ayinger. Great brewery."
"D - Not over bearing and low ABV.... Very drinkable."
"While it might be smooth and slightly rich, this is far from complex. It is drinkable and enjoyable, it just doesn't make it from good to great. I would recommend it more as an digestif, rather than with a meal or by itself."
"Pours a slightly cloudy dark chestnut with a moderate head that eases to a swirl. Smells like liquid brown bread. Quite dry and firm, with rounded grain and some slight sweetness on the end. Nice bready flavors with notes of molasses and grain and a drying finish. Beautifully balanced, and not at all sweet. Smooth and full in the mouth without being grainy. A classic dunkel."
"Dark mahogany in the glass, capped by a half-inch of head. Clarity and color are great. It smells of sweet caramelized malt and toasted raisin bread. Very nice palate, opening lightly toasty and nutty with a brown sugar sweetness. Body is light, and it becomes pleasantly crisp and moderately bitter in the finish, drying up substantially. A very good dunkel, and I bet it would be even better on tap."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is nice dark but mild German lager that is worth drinking for a long time."
"Drinkability - Very nice beer, although I can't attest to how good it is compared to other Munich dark lagers as I haven't had any. But for my vote, it has a nice taste, and isn't too filling. Easy to come back to."
"This is a tasty and refreshing brew that appears to be a fine example of the style."
"MD - I had not heard of this beer prior to my first visit to Total Wine, but have had a few other Ayinger offerings and have always been pleased. This one is no different. Very easy drinking. As I said before the Germans know how to do it."
"D: The beer is relatively easy to drink and is good if you are looking for something that's moderately filling because with all of the malts it feels like you're having a slice of bread."
"Drinkability: tracking with most of these other characteristics, this beer is pretty drinkable. Its flavors aren't my favorite and its mouthfeel doesn't keep my interest; I wouldn't shun one of these if offered but I won't go out of my way for one either."
"Pours a three finger cream head that fades quickly leaving a trace of lace. Nice, clear deep amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Malty nose. Flavor is caramel with a nice hop backbone, clean finish. $3.70 for a 5000ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"It isn't the best Dunkel but it is worth a try."
"O: A standard bearer for dunkels. From nose to finish, hits all the right notes. A beautiful full flavor in a beer that weighs in at just 5%. Prost!"
"Overall this was a good brew, but I wouldn't have more than one in a row, and would only drink this again seldomly."
"Impressions: Tasty and goes down well. Very flavorful without being so complex that you have to really think about each taste. Just drink one over a nice conversation and watch your glass empty without effort. Perfect ABV for sessioning. I'd say this is one of my favorite session beers."
"Pours a deep amber with good clarity, good finger of khaki head with high retention and plenty of lacing. Aroma is quite worty or malt syrupy, fairly intense and appealing, perhaps a some treacle in there, a bit husky. Taste has lots of worty malt, some toast, not quite roasty, but robustly malty with a great malt finish that doesn't taste overly sweet or cookielike like I've had in a hundred beers. The body is light to moderate, seems to match its lagerness, luckily carbonation avoids being overdone, so pretty nice. I really like the use of munich malts here, it gives it a rich, worty flavor without being sweet. Real nice beer from an underutilized style, highly drinkable lager with a rich malt flavor."
"D: a great example of what is quickly becoming my favorite style. Ayinger has delivered a beer that is both highly sessionable and incredibly flavorful; delicious and delicate. This is definitely worth a shot if it is in your area."
"A pretty straightforward, well crafted, easy quaffing Munich Dunkel. Germans know how to make a tasty beer that is clean, inoffensive, and easy to throw down the hatch. The nose was a little ehh, but the rest of the beer I enjoyed quite a bit."
"This is a very drinkable beer. Nothing off or odd about this one. I have a slight cold and I am still getting everything in scent and flavor. Another terrific beer from Ayinger. Rich, complex, drinkable, and delicious."
"Drinkability: I couldn't help but reach for the glass with this one as there is so much going on. The unusual but accomplished flavour may not be for everyone or for every occasion, but this is quite an extraordinary example of the style."
"I dunno. This is really good. Don't get my wrong. But it's not great. Maybe I just expected more from the top rated example of its style on BA? But what does it say about a style when nine out of the ten top examples here don't rate any higher than a B+? Maybe I'm just one of a lot of BAs who don't understand the style enough to rate it any higher?"
"I liked this beer and can't think of any reasons not to drink it again so that says something"
"Ayinger makes truely great beer. Nothing extreme or flashy, just great."
"D: A well made munich dunkel is always a drinkable beer and this is no exception. It came in a 16 oz (true pint) bottle but I could see this being served by the liter. Very good beer from a very good brewery!"
"Poured into a Unibroue tulip. Nice, off white head on a dark ruby body. Aroma is of sweet malts and maybe raisins and other dark pit fruits. Taste follows suit in a very delicious way. Sweet, but not too sweet. Not too complicated but just plainly delicious and very expected considering the source (Ayinger)"
"D: This beer immediately takes me back to Bavaria. Wonderfully drinkable."
"Overall I was expecting a little less sweetness in this beer. Worth a shot if you're a fan of the style but not one to seek out."
"Lots of carbonation on the palate, overall the flavor of the beer is weak. Some sweetness a nice pleasant aftertaste, medium body, high drinkability and good mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: if you are in the mood for a dunkel lager, this one will fill the need. Easy to consume and a definite session beer."
"Seeing words like muted, lacking, underpowered and underplayed in a review is never good. This isn't a bad beer by any means, but there's absolutely nothing here that makes me want to buy another, and how this is ranked ahead of far superior dunkels I do not know."
"D - Somewhat light in aroma and flavor but goes down very easily. The sweetness builds making more than 1 bottle a bit much."
"This beer is one that I would consider taking on a deserted island with me if I was told I could only drink one kind of beer for the rest of my life. Whether or not I'd choose it, I don't know - but I'd sure as hell consider it. It's just solid. Nicely balanced, bold enough, quenching enough, malty, historic tasting, but also a little citrusy and earthy. Bravo to Ayinger. They do no wrong in my eyes."
"It's a sticky brew, not quite chewy. There's weight behind this one, reminds me of a schwartzbier. These wheats are easy to put away, dunkel or wit."
"Damn fine beer."
"Cheers!!!"
"Very happy to have 500 ml of it, and I would gladly have another. Outstanding lager."
"Roasty, clean and delicious dunkel. Ayinger's Altbairisch Dunkel pours a bright, clear reddish brown. The head is creamy and pretty thick for the style. The aroma is toasty, bready malt. It smells like molasses on toast. The flavor adds in a spicy note, but the malt is really the star. Hopping is light but appropriate for the style, just enough to cut the malt sweetness. The malt flavor is big and thick for a lager. Ayinger really packs a lot of good flavor into the 5% abv, and it comes out surprisingly clean and light. This is a very pleasant, highly quaffable beer, another winner from Ayinger."
"Good mouthfeel with healthy carbonation, the strong malt flavour yet medium body makes it easy to have another."
"The taste is light whole wheat bread, dark raisins, and chocolate up front, followed by some mineral, dry leaves, faint licorice. It's lightly sweet up front, transforming to a drier finish light with spiciness and bitterness. The aftertaste is pleasant light mineral, toast, and dry leaves."
"Drinkability- Smooth and delicious and easy drinking"
"From the 500 ml bottle with no lot code or expiration date listed. Sampled on September 17, 2009. It pours a good looking amber-brown with excellent clarity, small head, and slow moving carbonation. It looks heavy. Barley malts lead the appealing aroma along with something sweet like molasses. The mouthfeel is a durable and smooth medium texture. The taste is on the sweet side with strong elements of coffee and malts and a light backdrop of hops. I enjoyed this one immensely."
"Dark brown and orange in color. Has a hint of chocolate and a roasted flavor. It smells and tastes a little sharp to me. The mouthfeel is ok and the drinkability is impacted by a so so flavor. At first I did not like this but it kind of grew on me. Not my style and I will not likely seek it out again."
"Great bready chocolate aftertaste. Just a classic and damn fine beer at a good price."
"This one is nice and fruity, quite a good flavor."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a dark amber color with a 1 inch head. Smell is a bit malty, a tad sweet. Taste is malty and refreshing, some hints of fruit. Feels creamy in the mouth. A bit heavy on the stomach for all night drinking. Overall this is a quality brew."
"D- Delicious. Seems like a great beer to start a day or to drink on a cool evening."
"D: Overall, not a bad beer, but the flavor is a little weird for me. Not what I'm used to in a dunkel lager. There's that weird corn and molasses flavor and the fruits are on the light side, instead of the usual dark fruits."
"Overall, a very rich yet smooth and drinkable beer. good stuff"
"This is a solid beer, very drinkable and balanced. There is a depth of flavor ranging from sweet overtones in the smell to a lingering coffee flavor on the palate in the finish that gives this beer a decent amount of character."
"Overall, can't say I loved this one and it came as a bit of a disappointment. However, I'd like to revisit it in the future to see if some of the flavors that came through were actually the result of poor storage or heat exposure."
"Overall- I enjoyed the bottle but will move on."
"Pours a light brown with a thin tan head. Nose has crisp nutty malts and mellow hops. Taste has a decent malt profile and some grassy hops. Light body has a refreshing carbonation. Seems like this could have used a bit more depth. Not quite on the same level as Ayinger's other beers."
"Another drinkable German brew. I could have buckets of this stuff."
"D - this beer really brings me back to Munich... I like this style and I like this particular offering... I could sip and savor this one, or I could make quick work out of a couple-six pints."
"I should have tried more of the Muenchen dunkel lagers when I was in Muenchen in 2008 because this was excellent."
"A nice lager, good breadiness without being heavy at all. Nice clean finish ups the drinkability. I wouldn't mind a little more flavor, but it works overall for the style."
"Smooth and highly drinkable. This is the definitive offering of the Munich Dunkel style."
"Notes: This is a very nice Dark Lager."
"pour is not black but a dark amber with a small head of off white. nose is toasted almond, toffee and apple. malty and yeast. rather creamy with a wonderful toffee and apple pie texture. very light though. goes down very light. a very mild german bitter finish. toasty yeasty finish. softly sweet but not a backbone of sweet. just a little bit of raisin really. a very mild sour leather that blends well with the apple pie quality."
"D - It's a very good brew especially following the style. It might be a little too sweet/malty to have more than one or two 17oz. bottles."
"taste is somewhat watery, malt, slightly bitter, some cocoa, roasted nuts, touch of prunes, ends a little dry and a little sour."
"D - Everything is good with respect to this beer but the mouthfeel is really special which makes the whole experience rather nice. Relatively low in alcohol and it falls down the throat very smoothly - what's not to like!"
"Apperance is of a carmel-sienna hue. Not much head or lace. Rows of tiny bubbles moving very fast to freedom. Has a very pleasent carmel-barley aroma. Has a very pleasant barley coco coffe taste. Somewhat mellow for a dark beer. Medium Bodied with a slight crispyness. I would drink this beer again and possibly again..ect."
"Overall, this is a wonderful bier that I recommend to everyone. Do yourself a favor and find a bottle or tap of this bier. Prosit."
"Drink: Imbibes rather easily for a dunkel beer. A nice dark German lager indeed. A great beer with more depth and personally than your typical lager."
"Pours dark amber to light brown with thin head that doesn't last. Nose is surprisingly tepid with some light toasty brown bread aromas. Palate is toasty, a little malty, with some very light caramel. Very thin bodied and easy to drink, but not watery like U.S. macros."
"Ah, I love tasty and well crafted lagers on a hot day!"
"Overall this is a good easy drinking dunkel, but I found myself wanting more from it. I would have liked it to be a little more rich and have the malt be more pronounced. I would not hesitate to have this one again, but my quest to find the ultimate Munich Dunkel Lager must continue."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side, but it's very creamy and smooth going down. Quite drinkable. As I usually find myself saying with the Ayinger beers, I wish it was available cheaper and in six packs."
"All in all this amounts to a slightly above average dunkel."
"D. Good session brew here from Ayinger. This brewery has never failed to impress me. Reccommended."
"Drinkability- Again, a style I have not really explored much of. Pretty tasty and easy to drink."
"Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel pours a clear dark brown with a tan head from a brown half liter bottle. The aroma is very nutty. The flavor is also kind of nutty. Pleasant enough, but there isn't much to it. This would be really quaffable if it were cheaper, I could easily drink a six of this in one sitting."
"Nothing too complex just a well made, quaffable beer."
" D: An enjoyable tasty beer. I could see myself drinking a few of these slowly to enjoy the taste"
"Really wonderful beer overall."
"Quite drinkable, and overall a great example of the Dunkel style and a nice quaffer. Nice depth and perfect for sociable situations."
"One of my favorite beers considering that it is affordable and you really do get your money's worth!"
"An adequate, generally serviceable dark lager, nothing more, as at least with the Germans, you know there's a minimum threshold to quality - and this might be it. I'm not quite inspired to have another go at this one any time soon."
"Very enjoyable beer. Wish I had more than one!"
"Pours a clear reddish brown with a thin off-white head that quickly dissipates to a thin film that really doesn't leave much lace. Roasted malt aroma with a hint of chocolate. Nice complex malt flavor that transitions to a well balanced malty/bitter aftertaste that has a great roasted malt flavor. Medium bodied with a very dry finish. This is a really good drinker that is plenty complex yet easy to drink and goes well with a variety of foods. Roast beef sandwich, pizza, cheese and crackers..."
"Conclusion: Great Dunkel Lager...rich, fairly full-bodied for its gravity, and brimming with flavor...chalk another win up for Ayinger"
"Ayinger is already one of my favorite European breweries, and Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel is the latest beer to back my claim. Go get this one."
"D..It's an okay German lager; not great, but certainly not bad. I wish I had more good to report, but then again, I have no real bad to report either."
"MF&D - good, nothing to complain about. would easily drink a couple of these; but on the other hand, I have nothing to brag about."
"This beer poured a dark brown with a reddish tint and fluffy three-finger tan head that lingered for a while. The smell is mostly slightly toasted malt with some toffee and caramel. The tast starts off with some big malt that gives way to some toffee and caramel candy with a bit of dried fruitiness that is cut slightly by the hops. The mouthfeel is slightly thick and creamy with some fine carbonation. This is a very tasty beer, and I wouldn't mind having a couple bottles at a time."
"The taste is slightly thin and light bodied, there is a lot of caramel, again the roasted sweet malts are paramount, and there is a bit of a hop presence in the finish. The beer is smooth, fairly creamy, but overall quite light bodied. There is a slight molasses note or two in the taste and it does finish with a bit of a tart bite or at least a little bit of a hop note or two. There is a roasted and sweet, almost candied sweetness that lingers well into the finish and aftertaste. The beer is decent for the style but I was hoping for something that tasted less like a watered down bock beer."
"Bottle: Poured a clear dark brown/burgundy color dunkel with a nice light brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of roasted malt with some caramel and light molasses is enjoyable. Taste is also a nice mix between some medium sweet malt with some nice notes of caramel malt and some very subtle molasses and a light dry roasted finish. Average body with good carbonation. Very well done but I am not sure this is a style that I really dig."
"Poured from the bottle into a pilsener glass. Rusty red color, almost bordering on scarlet. Huge white head, lots of lacing. Carbonation lasted a long time, with almost champagne-like bubbles working their way up the slender glass. Slight scent of clove perhaps, but not much else. Taste reminded me a bit of winter spices like cinnamon and coriander. There was a good backbone of malt to this beer that gave it a nice body. It's smoothness and low abv made it very easy to drink. I was expecting a darker, heavier beer, but instead I was pleasantly surprised with a reddish, light, refreshing beer. Glad I randomly just picked up a bottle. A nice change of pace."
"Highly attractive red-amber color, clear with a dispersed flow of miniscule bubbles, the head one finger deep but stays at that depth for some time. Everything about the nose is subdued half-measures, coffee and heavy cream, lightly toasted malts, raisin fruit, fruitcake, carob, given the lack of hoppy scents, doesn't require that kind of counter-weight to stay in balance. Light-bodied, here the carbonation does tend to diffuse the flavors prematurely. Same mixture of dark fruits, coffee cream, butterscotch, at times there is a sourness which adds spark. Needs a bookmark, loses its place by the mid-palate. Smooth with nary a rough edge in sight, err, taste, but there's this nagging sense that something is missing. You just keep waiting for an extra gear."
"D - This reminds me of an English Bitter. It's OK. I expected much more from this because the Celebrator and Centennial lager from the same brewery were incredible."
"It came down between this and Weihenstephaner Dunkelweizen at Kappys in Saugus today, but since I rarely have this style, I decided it would be a nice change. Color is dark copper, with two fingers of white head. Dark bread and banana come to mind first when smelling, followed by some clove and bit of powdered chocolate. Taste is big on the dark bread factor, which gives it a sweet start, but then it becomes a bit sharper tasting, with dry grains and a hop bite. Those last impressions taste wise really distinguish it from the dark German Weiss beers I am used to. Mouthfeel is light and beautifully carbonated. This quenches my thirst as well as any light ale or lager. Drinking this one is about as easy as it gets. This was a great beer to kick off a Christmas eve, which I am sure is going to be filled with other great offerings."
"From a 0.5 L bottle purchased locally. Aroma is full of malt and a slight hint of coffee. Color is a deep rust amber with a beige head. Smooth malt with some melanoidin character. I taste a little bit of cardboard from probably being on the shelf too long. A little sweetness but balanced nicely with a dry finish. This one is good, but I wish I could have a better bottle because I know this beer could be fantastic."
"(rated May 15, 2007)"
"Brown beer with a massive three-finger head that left lace as it died. Mild malt smell of caramel, toffee and some roasted and coffee malts. A dry, crisp sensation when the beer first hit my tongue. Followed by a sweet malt taste of caramel and hints of coffee in a medium-boided beer that is a tad syrupy but goes down rather smooth with some creaminess. Tastes great, with a little hop or roasted malt dryness on the backbite, but there weren't any real hops that I tasted. A good beer to kick around with."
"D - highly drinkable, something Ayinger does makes every beer ive had by them really good, plus with an average ABV good beer to enjoy over again."
"Excellent beer, I wish this came in 6 packs for a moderate price."
"Taste to me is excellent. Initially kind of interesting and salty, soy-sauce-like, but that dies down a bit. Nice roasted and sweet malt flavor. Good tartness and mild hop flavor, like a good dunkel or schwarz. Great mouthfeel, medium body, smooth and buttery, moderate carbonation. Could easily drink a few of these, not too heavy or strong at all."
"As with most Ayinger brews, this one is definitely solid. Full flavor, excellent aroma, and a highly drinkable brew. This one is void of anything even close to offensive and is just a flat out exceptional example of a Munich Lager."
"D: It was a refreshing, well balanced and tasty brew with a light body and low ABV. It is a wonderful session beer."
"Pours a dark reddish brown color. Huge foamy, almost creamy off-white head. Good Lacing & somewhat lasting. Dark nutty, clovey aroma. Strong aroma of grape juice. Some smoke. Grape, nutty taste. Watery, wheaty & slightly dirty/dusty. Dark wheaty taste. Easy to drink."
"Everything I've had from Ayinger has had a pleasant drinkability to it. Nothing too extreme, but very nice."
"Rich and complex yet light and very easy to drink. Want another!"
"I like this on an unseasonably warm fall day. Drinks easily and not as filling as some darker German offerings. Once again, Ayinger doesn't disappoint!"
"D: This is an excellent Munich dunkel! So much complexity of flavours and so well balanced. I could drink a ton of these. Ayinger, once again, has proven that they are one of Germany's top brewers."
"D - Highly sessionable... One of the best tasting, lower ABV beers I've tried..."
"D - A great beer for sure, as are all Ayinger products I've come in contact with. Very low bitterness, smooth body without the heaviness, and an immensely flavorful brew put this on the edge of perfection."
"A nice brew that I will not shy away from in the future."
"Overall this dark lager is delicious, refreshing and probably chuggable. I'll be buying more of these in the future for sure."
"Disappointing. I have no idea how fresh this sample is, no bottling code or best before date. This is a rather forgettable beer, it just doesn't have alot of character. I have brewed, and tasted others homebrewed dark lagers that are much better than this. I'll stick with their Doppelbock."
"Poured to a two fingered head that had a lot of small bubbles. Halfway into the glass the head disappeared but left some foam around the edges. Lager was a dark brown in color with a caramelish head. Had some lacing but not a lot. Smelled sweet with hints of malt. Tasted of sweet malt, and had a lightly bitter aftertaste. Aftertaste hung around awhile. Overall not a lot of taste going on here. Felt good in the mouth carbonation was about right for my taste. I think I had my hopes up to try this beer. I would drink these again, but its just not a priority. I will try other Ayinger brews to get a better feel about the quality of their beer."
"Overall: nah."
"D: Good per style, light and easy enough to drink and good for putting down a few."
"Drinkability on this one is high. There really just isn't anything about this beer that would make it difficult to drink one after another. Very good. I would like to get my hands on a bottle that I knew was very fresh. Here's to hoping."
"The sweetness fads when the well balanced hops kick in for a most lip smacking finish. At $2.75 for a generous pint, this is a drinker for any season. 5% almost gets this into session status."
"Drinkability: Medium bodied, crisp and clean. Refeshing and tasty dark lager."
"D- very nice D for this complex lager. the fruitiness makes me think ale, but the sheer crispness gives away the truth. overall a very nice lager. flavorful, aromatic, and refreshing is well appreciated during this early june heat wave."
"The 'alt' phrase on the bottle illudes to this being and Altbier. Though the beer does hit on the light caramel / toast flavors, this beer takes the proportions of these to the Dunkel level. Quite toasty, malty, bready. But also with low-lying levels of sweetness, dryness, and light fruitiness. Moderately full in texture with much creaminess, but not heavy. Toasty, dry, and cleanly finished. A highly drinkable beer for the big flavors."
"If your in or around Cumberland,MD stop by South Cumberland Liquors and try this great brew!"
"Overall this is a clean flavored lager with a decent malty sweetness to it. I didn't find it too exciting so I wouldn't have many, but you certainly could if this was your kind of brew. I give them credit for making a nice sessionable beer..."
"D: Good after dinner beer, but I'd say two bottle limit for me."
"Overall this was a pretty solid and enjoyable brew from the good folks in Aying."
"In the end, it's JUST short of sessionable. Almost, people!"
"This beer is drinkable, pretty good, but not great!"
"D: I could put down a bunch of these since the beer is pretty mild and smooth."
"M + D: A round body... a rich coating, and very smooth. It ends up being very nice to drink. Quite tasty, leaving a lingering toasted malt flavour in the mouth."
"A nice dark lager that never disappoints. Recommended."
"OK. As for the beer itself, it is a very nice looking, clear brown which shows itself to be a very deep garnet red when held to the light. A nice, light tan heads leaves a bit of lacing. The smell is very nice, with lots of sweet roasted malt, caramel, nut, and a bit of coffe in there. Also some fruit. The taste is very malty sweet with hints of caramel, coffee, and roast. The hops seem like they might make a very brief bitter appearance, but not much. The mouthfeel is a bit under medium with an average amount of carbonation. This is a very nice, sweet, malty brew."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable, but just not my taste."
"Smooth on the palate with good carbonation. You could drink this stuff all day."
"D - A good beer, but tastes much like a marzen. Not pleased with the taste of marzen."
"The aroma was lemony and malty with a faint caramel. The flavor was similar to the smell with a nice bitterness that stayed with you. In the mouth it was semi-chewy. Overall a very good drink."
"A little watery with good carbonation. Overall a pleasant beer to drink. This may be the highest ranking I have given any lager: light or dark. I drank this rather cool from a 500 ml bottle. Ayinger is possibly overall my favorite German brewery."
"The body was like most german beers, that is to say it was light/medium. Very drinkable."
"D: On the lighter side of medium bodied, very crisp and clean, sort of refeshing and a nice and tasty dark larger overall."
"This is a German beer version of comfort food. It's just what I imagine drinking in a homey, boisterous brauhaus, complete with a voluptuous...umm, well, never mind that. Anyway, it's an effortlessly sessionable, basic good beer. It's dangerous in the smooth way it goes down. This one will always be good for a contented smile, whether in a Bavarian biergarten or in my family room. I'm easy that way."
"Goes down easy, but the sweetness might get to be too much after a few. I would enjoy those few though. Good beer."
"Verdict: An decent version of a dunkel. Dark, smooth and dry. Very drinkable as well. Sessionable. I enjoyed this beer."
"Another strong offering from Ayinger... The brewery's Brau Weisse offering is one of my all-time favorite brews, so I had high hopes for this one, especially after loving their Oktoberfest-Marzen... Pours an impressive dark-purple hue with a frothy head that left some lacing... flavorful, distinct aroma, with toffee, prunes, and figs... taste strongly complements the smell with dark-fruit, malts, caramel, and some brown sugar... light, refreshing flavor that is very distinct and different from many other styles I've sampled... good stuff, easily drinkable with a nice mouthfeel full of intriguing, subtle flavors... As I'm drinking this, I'm certainly starting to notice a grape-juice like flavor... very different type of taste that I haven't otherwise come across... Copped a single 500 ml bottle from Gary's in Madison for $2.75... worth it... all of Ayinger's brews are top-class, and this one certaily fits the bill with all-around quality, taste, and character... Definitely recommended..."
"A very well made Dunkel is my ""Desert Island"" beer.. I simply enjoy everything about them.. and this is one of the best I've had over the years."
"Drinkability- No one thing stands out as being superb, but this beer is put together very well. The whole is definitely greater than the sum of the parts."
"I found this easily drinkable due to the good taste and easy mouthfeel. Not too heavy so it'd be a very nice beer for a long night."
"Very balanced, no extremes in any category. The longer it sits on the tongue the more flavors you can pick out. Could possibly stand a touch more carbonation to make it spicier. As it stands it is light bodied but lacks the carbonation support to keep it from being a little watery. Other than that it is an ideal, smooth, rich dunkel that is a pleasure to drink."
"On draught at the Winking Lizard (glass special). This beer pours a pretty burgundy color with a medium thick light beige head that diminishes steadily. Spotty lacing on the glass. Roasted malt, nuts and dark chocolate aroma. Medium-bodied with flavors of roasted malt, toffee and dark fruits with touches of chocolate and hops. The finish is bready malt with a nice lingering roastiness. Overall this is an enjoyable brew, as are the other Ayinger beers I have tried."
"Overall this was a great beer and one of my favorite styles. Its very drinkable. Wish there were more dunkels like this one."
"good drinkability. clean and simple, in the good way. the more beer that i drink the more i appreciate beers like this: clean, simple, well crafted traditional styles."
"D: This is great, a nice change from a brown ale, the malts are obviously very different from England. The wife likes it a lot and so do I. Highly recommended."
"Tasty beer that I'm sure I'll have again, and wouldn't mind having a few of. No other part of the experience lives up to the spectacular appearance, but several aspects are close."
"The beer poured from the bottle into my pilsner glass showed a clear red/orange color with little head and minimal lacing. The aroma had evidence of sweet, cyrstal barley with a slight, roasted quality. There was subtle evidence of bavarian yeast ester with a slight banana undertone. There was no hop aroma present. The flavor initially has a toasted grain quality with a dry breadiness. Hop bitterness is ever so slight along with a slight banana flavor. The beer ends up finishing on the sweet side due to clean lagering and good mouthfeel and carbonation. All things considered, I found this to be a really good beer. What I enjoyed the most about it was its finish. It left you with a slight, sweet linger that just invites the consumer to drink more. I will purcahse this bottle again."
" This is a really nice dark lager. It's made in the ""old style", as opposed to more contemporary offerings that can be watery at times. One of the better dark lagers I've had."
"The Germans not only brew great beer but also know how to design the bottle, this being no exception. 16.9 oz bottle with no apparent freshness dating. Pours a a clear dark amber brown with creamy looking light tan head. Smells full of sweet malt and some dried fruit. Tastes of roasted malt, bread, brown sugar. Lots of husky grain with this one. A thicker mouthfeel than the other dunkels I've reviewed so far. I'm really digging this dunkel. Plenty of complexities and even more drinkability. Well worth trying."
"D- 5%abv means this is one smooth-drinking session beer, I really like the taste profile and aromas from this Dunkel style and would gladly pick this up again in the future, Ayinger continues to impress with its lineup!"
"D - this is a very very drinkable brew. It requires no company in the form of nuts or pretzels to get it down quickly, not that you wouldn't want to savor it! This is the best Altbairish Dunkel I've had to date and I'll update this post when that changes."
"This Ayinger lacks any kind of dating also (unless you count the slits on the bottom of the label); pours a deep copper w/ a slight head that lasts, plenty of lacing; good malty aroma w/ some caramel & fruit undertones; nice sweet toasty malt flavor, caramely w/ some interesting fruity yeast (?) aftertaste, a faint hop flavor presence; nice light-med mouthfeel, not ""thick & cloying"" at all, dry, yet sweet at the same time; very drinkable, in fact, this beer is so good, I think it's replacing DAB as my fav. dunkel, i'll drink this on over & over..."
"D: Very drinkable beer - I'll have no problem finishing this 500ml."
"A decent beer in taste, but did not like the smell. I want to try all the Ayinger line."
"D- This beer has very light lagered flavors, with the watery and tart notes covering the subtle malt flavors which are more appealing."
"Cheers."
"Pours out a rusted hazelnut with a frothed milk off-white head that is supported by rigorous carbonation. Leaves some wavy lacing. Smells of sweet wort, chocolate covered raisins and caramel. Flavor starts off a bit crisp, actually, with some crackery malts accompanied by subtle (more so than in the aroma) flavors of dried fruit, nut, and chocolate. As the crispness fades, these other flavors come out more. Finishes a bit drying alongside tones of grape juice, medium roast coffee, and floral hops. Mouthfeel is about medium in feel and not too sticky, although there is a bit of sweetness to this beer. Bubbles are a little tingly. Impressive."
"D: Good. No problems putting this one down to start out the afternoon."
"D-quite good for a lager, I could have a couple of these."
"A solid German dark lager."
"A fine german beer that is sure to please!"
"Deep copper color with voluminous head. Smells of roasted malt, minor smokey notes, tangy sour aromas, and some caramel. A complex of caramel flavors that are hard to describe in detail. Clean light hop flavors. Finishes with a mildly oxidized flavor (cardboardy) but still drinkable. Very malty yet light on the palate."
"Pours a clear, dark ruby color with plentiful off white head and awsome staying power. In the nose is tons of fresh caramel, earthy rich crystal malt tones, and some nice sweet rye bread as well. Flavor wise, the caramel notes come in first, almost to the point of a bitter burnt caramel, some spicieness, with a very light body. It is a nice change from summer beers, as it is incredibly light but gives you the dark punch that a brown or porter would. Finish is extremely thin as the carbonation is quite low giving it a slight wateriness. It isn't a bad attribute given it is supposed to be a light bodied lager. Recommended!"
"D - Drinkable is a surprising way (due to its color), but this point is well illustrated in the the July 07 issue of BA mag. Refreshing is warm weather but because of the smooth caramel malt not in the typical fruity-yeast way."
"D: Great for a darker beer, sessionability is fantastic, very refreshing, though you wouldn't know by looking at it. I've had beers that were more complex, but as a simple drinking beer and for the style, this lager is phenomenal. Great job Ayinger!"
"This is a classic dunkel. The best to style dunkel I have ever had was a dunkel at the Old German Brewery on Water St. in Milwaukee. I use that dunkel as a frame of reference. I did not miss the chemically burnt taste of some dunkels. It was a very smooth roasted malt taste while still having a background munich/vienna malt flavor. It had a beautiful red/dark amber color with no head whatsoever. Smooth/roasted/malty/burnt caramel flavors abound."
"Glowing plummy red lager with a cream white head. Sugared raisins, caramel, toffee, and just a general juicy sweetness strings up the aroma nicely. Taste fits the aroma bill except for a bit of hops and burnt grain that show up just to stomp around a bit in the finish. Extremely clean tasting, but the mouthfeel gets bogged down a bit by a rich malt profile. A little heavy, but hands down one of the best examples I've had of this style which usually doesn't do it for me."
"Very drinkable, it just looks so good and is a joy to drink."
"This was an excellent example of the Munich Dark style. Poured a dark tan-brown with an off-white head. The flavor was malty with the slight hint of toasty hops. It was slightly sweet without being cloying. Overall, this was an excellent, flavorful beer, one well worth finding and drinking."
"D: Quite drinkable, lighter in body and alcohol. Good aroma and flavors. One I'd have again and would recommend."
"d - this is my first go at this style and i liked it. definitely interesting and good to have around as a sipper."
"Pours a deep crisp brown with a thin head that diminishes to a thin layer. The aroma is of caramel and some milk chocolate. The taste is a wonderful variety of sweetness; caramel, vanilla, molasses and chocolate. The beer is very light and crisp with an appropriate amount of sweetness. This is a very enjoyable beer."
"Drinkability: Ayinger pulls through once again. This company can not brew a bad beer and is quickly becoming one of my export faves. Was surprised at how light it actually was. Would definitely buy more and lots of at it to boot!"
"in short, this is a solid dark lager. poured a clear, red-tinged dark brown and a creamy tan head and lacing. nose dominated by dark, doughy bread, molasses, toffee, and brown sugar. taste was moderately sweet with a touch of astringent hop bitterness and roasty, nutty flavors for balance. finish was short and crisp, with a light to medium mouthfeel, and lively on the palate. a nice session beer."
"D - A very good German lager. Sweet, but not over the top."
"Drinkability: Whoever thinks of fizzy piss water when the term lager is mentioned, needs to try something like this. Rich and full flavor."
"Poured with a nice fine, foamy, light colored head and lace. Head slowly dissipated to light cover. Lovely, dark brownish amber with hints of brass. Quintessential alt. Just a hint of fruit, plenty of body, hint of acid tartness from carbonation, malty, not too sweet, drinkable. easy finish."
"Beer poured a ruby-brown color with a nice off white head. Nose is very non-descipt other that a slight hint of German malts and hops that were detected. Taste is of sweeted toasted malts balanced nicely by the noble hops. Mouthfeel is very smoth and full for the style. Overall drinkability is pretty good. This beer improves nicely at warmer temperatures and is a nice representation of the style."
"Pours a deep brown color with a nice white head that falls fast, but doesn't expose the beer on top, good head retention. Slight lacing looks alright. Sweet malted barley and roastiness is the first thing that comes to mind. The taste is slightly sour in the beginining from some bad handling I'd wager. Then the flavors appear for a little bit. It's off a bit, but not enough to make me not finish the glass. Overall I would try this again I would hope it's not messed up, but if I do make it to Germany this year I will try it at the brewery!"
"Pours a dark ruby red with a thick ta head and light carbonation. Light roasted aroma with a light wiff of hops. Taste is bit roasted with light hops bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is light and drinkability is high. I was in the beer store today and was looking for a new California Microto try-and when I was unable to find one I thought I haven't had this beer in many many years-wow what a very good beer. cheers"
"Another winner from Ayinger. I haven't tried one of their offerings yet that I haven't truly enjoyed. Very good beer."
"Overall great beer."
"Overall impression: A malt driven clean finishing beer. Esters are a touch high. No off flavors and an enjoyable session."
"at all."
"Not really what I thought it was going to be. It may be great for the style, and maybe this style's just not for me. It was actually a rather boring experience."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Fantastically light-bodied and well rounded... the carbonation works well for the style, drinking well by itself or with traditional lighter German fare. An alternative when you might crave the flavor and complexity of a great doppelbock, but without the higher alcohol and heavier mouthfeel. Terrific beer, uncompromising in its integrity or tradition."
"Not a bad beer, but definately not my favorite. A bit light for the style in my opinion, which is why it had a very high drinkability. The mouthfeel made the beer feel like it should be medium in body, but the taste was a bit weak. A very smooth beer, but not a huge fan of the roasted nut and caramel malty taste."
"D: Pretty good. I'd have another, but this one has sparked my interest in the brewery and it's other offerings, which i'd like to try first before coming back for another."
"The body of this beer is a ruby/amber mix that goes from daker to lighter top to bottom. The head is nearly two fingers thick, frothy and light tan in color. Aroma is light and malty with some mild toasty and faint brown sugar-ish notes. Toasty again in the fore then sweet powdered malt, brown sugar, toasty bread and a light caramel flavor. Very relaxed beer that has that awful subtlety curse. Balanced sweetness and a nice lightly cartbonated mouthfeel."
"D: Very easy to drink more than one."
"Amazing stuff. HIGHLY recommended."
"D: There is nothing in this beer to stop one from enjoying several in row. There's no ABV on the label, but there's no heavy malt or hops notes for a high ABV to hide behind. I'd place it at +/-5%, so it is certianly sessionable."
"tasty"
"A lovely dark lager that goes down like silk, refreshes, and arouses the taste buds. It looks especially noble in a german lager glass. The beer only reafirms the German domination of the beer world. It smells of dark malts but little else and tastes of well balanced bready malt that would not be out of place on a summer day."
"A tart, dry,bisquity,light malty taste.The aftertaste is a bit thin,light hints of carmel,and a light spicey hop finish. Very smooth and drinkable.A good dark summer beer.Overall a pretty good brew,would drink this again."
"Pours a nice deep amber with a fluffy head. The head thins out as the beer is consumed, but leaves a nice lace down the glass. The nose has a smooth earthy note with a hint of hops and grains with a light alcohol scent. It tastes very smooth with light wheaty notes and hints of malt and alcohol and a smoky aftertaste. The mouthfeel is smooth and filling. An exceptional Dunkel that's easy to drink."
"-Oelergud"
"This pours a deep clear ruby red with a huge tan foamy head.A very nice looking beer. The smell is roasted malt, a chewy nuttiness, and dark fruits. The aromas are very pungent and pleasing. The taste is chewy nuts, roasted malt,vanilla, and it ends with a crisp carbonated finish. The m/f is light with all the flavors mixing very well. This is a beer that doesn't disapoint, it's good in every aspect and worth picking up. Cheers. Yumm, I could have a whole bunch of these."
"Pleasant fruity taste with a smooth finish and surprisingly clean finish. Not particularly strong in any one category but extremely drinkable and well crafted. Almost elegant by dark brew standads, this is the rapier thrust as oppossed to the hammer blow of a stout or imperial porter. Carbonation is mellow and this goes down veery easy, probably too much so."
"Lovely reddish mahogany hue. Nice white head that laces quite nicely. Big whifs of figs and prunes and other fruits. Tastes of figs & prunes then moves to more roasted notes that linger on the tongue. This beer has a very good mouthfeel and the drinkability is equally as good. Overall a wonderful brew!"
"Pours a dark English tanned leather color with an opaque brown-redness. Moderately dense head which thins out after a few sips. Laces the glass a bit as the beer is sampled. Tastes of fig, caramel and toffee. Balanced very well with moderate bitterness making this beer very drinkable. Not too sweet at all. One of the most drinkable beers around."
"Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel was clear and dark amber-red in color. It had a thick, rocky, light tan head with decent retention. It fit perfectly in a 22oz glass. The aroma was full of dark malt, slightly roasty. It has a malty taste, but is not really sweet, well balanced. It is medium in both body and carbonation. In my opinion this is the perfect session beer, good flavor, not too sweet, not too bitter, average alcohol content, and goes down really easy. This is one of my old favorites that I fall back to a couple times a year."
"Oh man what a great beer. I can see and taste why it has won so many awards. Gorgeous dark brown color with a tannish head, amazing taste that makes you want more. The aroma was the only slight disappointment for this brew, but certainly a beer to find and purchase. Overall a smooth and complex brew that is so easy to drink."
"Drinks okay, just a so-so take on the style IMO"
"D- another easy drinking german, crisp and refreshing while the malt profile gives it a nice complexity. Very Very nice"
"Drinkability - this is decent, not bad, not great. It goes down fairly easy. Would have this once in a while, not much more often."
"Poured from a bottle to a golden-brown with one-finger, off-white head that lingered through most of the glass, and decent lacing. Malty, chocolatey aroma. Tasty flavor, with more of the malt and chocolate, and a hint of spice, possibly clove. Finish was okay, but not as long or good as I was hoping."
"Drinkability: Maybe with some nice smoked sausages this may work, but for the most part it disappoints."
"This is a classic example of the style. It's malty, with little to no hoppy presence. I think that it is a good complement to food, especially a barbecue or spicy foods."
"Extemely drinkable and very enjoyable. Well crafted and a great representation of the style."
"Kicked the Keg of Weiss so this went on. Oh, dear god. I am a huge lover of black lagers done right. Nice dark color with thin edges beutiful full head that fills the stein. The smell is mostly clean but for a hint of boiling wort and a gentle strumming of darkness. The taste is blasting and with the keg not too cold it really develops in my mouth. I gives a slight sticky coating but is refreshing. The gentle roasted flavors give are meet with a nice subtle counter of hops. Balance, this thing could walk a tight rope. Nice mouthfeel and too drinkable."
"Poured a semi-opaque, dark brown color with a soapy, frothy head. Nice lacing left behind. Aromas of burnt sugar, roasted malt, and ripened fruit. The taste was similar to the smell with burnt/smoke flavors slowly gaining strength. Added another element of sweetness in a unique way. Very enjoyable to drink with strong flavors of various fruits, grains, and smoke."
"Bottom line: I've had this Dunkel many times before and I'm glad I've finally reviewed it. It's a winner that I can easily recommend cuz it's just so damn tasty!"
"Mouth: Roasted chocolate malts with a sour balance and strong carbonation. A slight bitterness sticks in throat after swallowing. It's yummy, but a bit thin, and doesn't offer up a lot of depth or complexity."
"Big half-liter German bottle with no freshness date - served in a pilsner glass. It pours a nice deep copper color with a half inch tan head that leaves some bits of lacing. The smell is of sweet caramel and molasses malts, along with toasty, dark malts that hint at dark fruits, and a faint smoky character. Kinda smells like the malts in Celebrator. It has a light to medium body with vibrant carbonation and tastes of toasty, smoked malts, dark fruits, and a light dose of spicy hops that leave a mild to medium bitterness. Quite the delicious lager, and I'm guessing they use similar ingredients to brew their dopplebock, as this tastes like a lighter version."
"A fine dark lager that's very nicely executed all around."
"Two sips in, this beer was one of my favorites. A fantastic beer that I will drink often."
"Good all around. Taste of molases (sp?). Easy drinking beer - sweet, nutty, rich, quite nice. Defined by its malt, a solid beer that's well rounded and good on all counts. I don't have much experience in this style of beer but it seems quite good. I see it's on the top of the list of this style, so I guess that's saying something. I give this 4s across the board but I imagine after a while you'd really take to this beer, liking it more as you drink it. By the end of the glass it's still well worth the price of admission. Solid, well made beer."
"Drinkability is high, but there is something in the finish I am not completely sure about. MK"
"Smooth, creamy, velvet mouthfeel. Big malts, roasted choclate, and caramel, fig, whipped cream. A 30 second finish to top off this malt bomb. Could drink this all day & night."
"Pours a translucent brownish amber color, with a huge tan head that retains well. The aroma has a big malty aroma, with notes of hazelnut, figs, dates, chocolate, toasted bread, and some floral, spicy noble hops. The flavor is also intensely malty, with notes of toasted bread, hazelnut, figs, prunes, dates, along with some spicy and floral hops. The mouthfeel is light with moderate carbonation and drinkability is excellent. This is a great beer, seems to be almost the ultimate expression of the style."
"-SS"
"Ayinger have always been one of my favorites and this beer doesn't disappoint. A wonderful dark lager in the true Bavarian style."
"Drinkability: Easy drinker, I finshed my bottle in no time, wishing I would have savored it a bit more. Lower alcohol content makes this one sessionable. A great beer to have as you sit on your patio or deck on a pleasant evening after a warm day."
"A beautiful beer. Nice. Ayinger doesn't let down."
"It's been a while since I've blessed my Ayinger weizen glass. Poured a thick, foamy, pale chestnut colored head with a creamy top. Small islands of lace cling above the glowing mahogany colored beer. Mild aroma of chestnuts, bread, and dash of cocoa. Light bodied beer with light carbonation is almost watery. Biscuit malt and cocoa up front give way to floral tea-flavored hops in the end. Not bad, but something seems to be missing. Reading the description of Munich Dunkel Lagers this one seems to be missing some the richness and creamy mouthfeel. Coudn't find any numbers, let alone a freshness date, but I have a feeling this may have passed it's peak."
"Spicy hops hit first chased by metallic sweetness with a soft-baked quality. There is a very subtle toffee tone. Finish is yeasty and spicy with notes of clove, nutmeg, and alcohol. Mouthfeel is lightweight and chewy. This is a fun beer, but not really a new favorite. Kind of reminds me of a really toned down Goose Island Xmas Ale."
"Good smell, taste, and mouthfeel make this an easily drinkable beer. The carbonation is not extreme and the flavor lends easily to having more than one in the same night or across other spans of time."
"Finishes clean with a dash of yeast. One of the most drinkable dark beers I've had in ages. Definately destined to be one of my favorites."
"Ayinger Dunkel is a clear mahogany color, with a big, off-white head. Surprisingly light in aroma, this beer gives off lots of grain notes alongside a slight sour note. Taste is full of bitter grain, with a smidge of bright fruitiness. Mouthfeel is perfect, with a medium body that's neither too water nor too thick, and that slips across the tongue comfortably. Quite drinkable, this beer can be enjoyed in quantity... although the bitter grain flavors could possibly wear on a drinker over time."
"Overall: This is a fairly well-balanced (more hop bitterness would be nice) and tasty beer. It's good for the style, which happens to not be a favorite of mine."
"A luscious brown pour that hints at ruby on the edges. Finishing the pour is a dense cream colored head. For some reason the smell reminds me somewhat of a porter, like plums with a dash of sweet vanilla. The taste is pleasingly much the same, and oh so smooth. The finish is just a hint of bitterness and a tad citrus, almost unnoticeable. Mouth is slick and inviting. I could picture myself drinking one after another if this was on tap. A real treat."
"D: Very easy drinking beer and quite enjoyable on all levels. Recommended."
"Nice aggressive pour produced a substantial off-white head over a ruby mahogany body. Nose is biscuity roasted malts with citrusy bright hops. Taste is more of the same, with a dry finish. Good mouthfeel. Great finish. Not overly complex, but more than one-dimensional, this would be a super session beer."
"This is a beer that fills me up. The potency is mild, but it fills you like a big meal. Not a sessioner IMO."
"Pours a clear red/brown, medium off white head forms, some nice lace. Smell is chocolate, dark fruits, yeast and figs, some iron. Taste is figs and dates, caramel, chocolate and iron. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Creamy texture, tastes slightly oxidized but still real nice. Thanks northyorksammy."
"Drinkability is exceptional. I could have several of these without thinking. Perfect for this cold, winter storm night."
"Clear mahogany/red with a light tan head. Good retention and nice lacing. Warm caramel and toffee aromas, along with a little bit of fresh grain husk. These characters form the base for the flavour as well. Mild to moderate bitterness with some fig/date notes and mild brown sugar. Lingering herbal bitterness with a hint of chocolate. Good texture. A quality dunkel. Thanks northyorksammy!"
"Looks like cola with a head! I had this one in the signature Ayinger hourglass shaped Weizen Glass poured form a bottle. It pours a clear cola colored brown with an impressive 2 to 3 head that lasts for about ½ the Weizen Glass. The lacing is noticeable for the first ½ glass as well. It has a very smooth malty flavor similar to an Alt, Boch, and appropriate for a Dunkle Larger. A sweet and caramel experience that makes me instantly think of Bavaria. The mouthfeel is larger light with a very, very slight fizz. The aftertaste is pleasant and sweet. This would be a good substitute for dessert. It isnt a beer for slamming back but for being enjoyed over a good long conversation."
"tasty. not a world beater but a nice little brew to have around. In the mood for a stout type without a heavy feel? Maybe this is a good stand in. It has a nice flavor profile but is not overwhelming at all and at 5% ABV is not going to kick you in the pants. Solid offering."
"Dinkability: A very good session beer, I could drink several of these in a row."
"The mouthfeel doesnt seem very full, and the carbonation doesnt hit me until the swallow. Drinkability is good, I could easily drink this all night. It goes down very easy, but could use a little more unique flavor."
"Cheers,"
"D- This is a good beer. The taste is there but not overpowering, and I am really down with the mouthfeel. A fine lager, good til the end. Sign me up again."
"Drinkability & Notes  As primarily an ale drinker it is nice to have a good lager that lets the malt really shine through. Very easy to drink, but lacks the complexity that I crave."
"Pours a dark amber into a Samuel Smith pint glass with one inch of head. Smells sweet, smooth, and dark. Taste is very earthy and malty, hints of chocolate. Hops are typical for this style, you have to try real hard to get the faintest hint. Reminds me of an unwatered down Heineken Dark. Quality dark lager, I can drink this all night though its nothing special."
"My first of this style I picked this up for under 3 bucks at my local grocery. Dark amber in the glass with a soothing malty aroma, little hops to be detected in the nose. Taste is very pleasant and earthier than the beer looks. True to style there isn't much hops or bitterness here which makes this very easy to drink and it goes down quite smooth. Definitely A nice style and one i'll make a point to try out more examples of."
"Poured into an Ayinger half-liter tumbler, this beer produces a huge rocky head. I can't help but notice the delicate aroma of fresh malt accented by toffee candy. The mouthfeel of this beer is luxurious, the perfect canvas for the toffee character of the caramelized flavors in the lager. I wouldn't be surprised if the wort of deliberately caramelized in the kettle. The beer is malty without being too cloying; it has the right amount of bitterness. The hops are barely noticeable, but you no they are there. Simply an outstanding dark lager!"
"Overall: This is an exceptionally well made beer with an utterly fantastic flavor. A real homerun, especailly for $2.89 a pint. As in I'm going to buy a lot and then run home to drink it. American brewers are really missing the boat on this fantastic style."
"I was all set to be impressed by Altbairisch Dunkel since this brewery (along with Brauerei Weihenstephan) is my favorite in all of Germany. My lack of enthusiasm for this particular beer probably has more to do with my lack of enthusiasm for this particular style than anything else. At least now I know that when it comes to Ayinger, I should stick with the excellent Brau-Weisse and the equally excellent Ur-Weisse."
"500 ml bottle served in an imperial pint. Pours a very nice red mahogony color with a finger of beige head, decent retention, not much lacing. Smell is a pretty rich malt, with just a slight roast and fruity hints of cranberries and raisins. Taste is a clean doughy malt, with a slight roasted chocolate hint and a touch of hops at the end that struggles to keep up with the malt. Lingering sweet malt after each sip. Mouthfeel is very smooth, but is a little watery on the finish. Malty dark lagers aren't really my thing, but this was a solid one, and I could definitely quaff a few of these if I had to."
"drinkability: gone before i can finish the reveiw. I love dunkle's. love. It's a crime that it comes in this tiny pint bottles, i could do a 12er of this. Man I wish I could get this on tap/ go back to munich."
"The mouthfeel seems to be a bit light, dry and has a lingering mix of the smoke and tartness, along with a bit of a bite in the back of the tongue. Drinkable in the sense that it's easy to put one down quick, but probably not one I will drink again."
"Drinkability: Quite. This is a step down from a full-on smoked beer, but offers some very bold flavors for a light-ish ABV beer. Major surprise, this one."
"Overall: A nice bold dark lager, one I'll have to try again."
"Very nice tan head, dense and long lasting. Beautiful reddish brown color and very clear. Aroma is clean, not very intense though - a hint of bready, cookie-like maltiness, it would be nice if it were stronger. The flavor is wonderful as well, starting with some toastiness and nuttiness along with a slight sweetness and a decent dose of bitterness at the end. This is a delicious beer! Super drinkable."
"The color is a pleasant burgundy when held up to the light, translucent with a brown tint. The smell is perfect, like cranberries, very tart and almost bitter. You can really smell this all the way up your nose. The taste is much like that, a little bitter with almost a tingly sensation. The overwhelmingness is much like cranberries in the first gush, then it mellows out but the bitterness still lingers. For mouthfeel and drinkablility I didn't think it was that special... there is a strange chalky sensation that overtakes the back of your mouth so to remedy it you take another sip, but then find yourself right back in the same predicament. For a sipping beer this is great, but don't expect to enjoy too many."
"Pours a nice dark brown, huge head which disapates in awhile, lots of lacing throughout the drink. Scents of malt, caramel. Medium body with a smoky/nutty taste. Very nice brew, will add to my list. Very drinkable, makes a good session beer, definitely would recommend this to people."
"Not necessarily my style of beer but tasty and interestingly eye-opening. Like to be sure I have a fresh example next time..."
"Overall a great beer and very drinkable with a unique flavor. Definately adding this one to my long list of favorites."
"Pours a dark, mahogany colour, with a cream coloured head, good retention and lacing. Sweet caramel and toffee flavours, with some smokiness. Taste was full of bready malt, caramel, toffee and some smoke reminiscent of a rauchbier. Some bitterness from the hops. This lager is dominated by its malt character and is pretty delicious."
"EDIT: Having been over to Bavaria a few times, I think I can safely say this is one of my top 2-3 dunkels. In fact, it's likely my overall favorite. Of all things, there's an excellent Indian restaurant near Marienplatz (Garam Masala) that serves this on tap. I find this makes a wonderful accompaniment to spicy and savory Indian dishes. Kind of a random food pairing, but it works. I wish I could bring a bottle to my own local Indian spots."
"Outstanding drinkability here I could drink this all the time and I absolutely am going to stock up on this one. Highly recommended!"
"500 ml bottle. No date, but there is a touch of oxidation. Brown and garnet with a nice tan cap on top. Strong malt nose featuring chocolate, and toffee. No hops here. Buttery chocolate with a drying at the end. Light carb is nice. Well worth the coupole of bucks fo the bottle."
"Opinion: This is a really nice beer, and one that I would probably drink all the time if it were available in Texas (At least I dont know where to find it in Houston). This is a world class beer, and I bet that it would be fabulous to try in Aying. The example that I reviewed showed some slight signs of oxidation. Still a wonderful beer."
"A nice, refreshing, drinkable lager...but with plenty of character to keep things interesting. A distinctly German beer."
"Flavor is heavy malty with some burnt taste that is delightfull. Perfect for a post meal sealer."
"Appearance is a deep mahogany with a cream colored head that reduces to sticky lace. Aroma is of brown sugar, rich coffee and mixed fruit. Initial taste is yeast, malt and burnt sugar, mellowing into the promised mixed fruit from the bouquet. Bitter hops kick in but do not overwhelm the malt, and end with a lovely aftertaste. Brilliantly crafted!"
"This beer is more complex than its seems after the first sip. It has hints of spiciness and nice, grain-flavored after taste. The grainy character comes through in a subtle smell as well. Additional tastes come forward the more you drink it. The mouthfeel is a little watery, but that detract significantly from the enjoyability. It was surprisingly drinkable."
"Pours a dark amber color with decent head that does not recede much. It's a tad too dark to see the carbonation, but fairs well. Smells of roasted malts and mouthfeel is quite strong in the sense that you can get a good taste of it before you even swallow. There is a slight dryness to the aftertaste with a nice ballance of hops. There is also a good nutty malt taste too. This is the second Ayinger I've tried after Celebrator Doppelbock. This isn't quite as good as that, but it's still up there. I give this a thumbs up."
"A perfectly clear dark tan with many columns of bubbles and a sturdy white head that leaves a constant ring. Nose smells a little thin with malty bread and cocoa powder notes over top. Taste is mostly malt, with a miniscule hop flavor underneath. Some citrus on the edges and just the beginnings of a dark chocolate flavor, but the thinness prevents it from flourishing. Mouthfeel is thin, though it has more body than other beers I've had in this style. Highly drinkable, pleasant if a tad watery. Give it a shot."
"Pours translucent dark brown-orange, nice foamy head, good retention and lacing. Nose consists of light toasty malts, minor hops, a nice blend that isn't too strong. Taste matches well with a good balance of toasted malts, some bitter hops, good nutty malted foundation. Another winner from Ayinger, but the Ur Weisse still takes the cake."
"This brew pours a translucent, richly reddish-brown color with a soft blanketing head. Pretty nice looking beerthe head could be a bit more firm and stable, but overall its still attractive. The aroma is wonderfulthick smells of doughy, sweet, bread-like malt. Not a lot of hops in the aroma, but there is a distinctive yeasty quality. I love the smell. The brew itself is fairly sweet, but relatively light in body. It has a fleetingly metallic charachteristic. Theres a hint of hops in the finish, which sort of abrupt, considering the sweet foretaste. All in all, I was impressed with this one."
"poured into a wheat beer glass, nice fluffy tan head, deep red color. A nice looking beer. Smell of caramel malts dominate, what would be expected. Flavorful, a chocolate taste that you don't expect. Nice and balanced, some moderate hop influence at the end. Served slightly too cold, it has a good taste. Good carbonation, balance, and light feel in the mouth, I could certainly drink more. Not all night, but more."
"Taste is the same as the nose. Bready and really malty. Some light finishing hops. Lightly sour. Rich caramel and fruity. Mouth is sweet and lightly sticky. Pretty tasty dunkel."
"I liked everything about this beer. Its not a brute by any means in huge amounts of aroma and flavor. But whats there sets perfectly for what it is, its very natural tasting and feeling. The bread tones in all its characteristics are just right. A fantastic brew and sessionable to boot. Love those Munich malts! Mmmm...fresh breads..."
"I could drink this all damn day long. I love this beer."
"I really didnt expect such a flavor profile from a Dunkel and to this point, this is certainly my favorite. Props to Ayinger!"
"Pours a clear dark amber with a creamy off white head that leaves some lacing in my glass, bready, fruity aromas. Nutty caramel, chocolate flavors, medium bodied with a creamy smooth mouthfeel, surprisingly it has a somewhat dry finish, a great lager."
"Pours a dark ruby maple syrup with a large, light khaki head that sticks around for a while. Nose is doughy caramel, tobacco, and cookie malt, with a tangy spice backing. Taste starts off lightly bitter and crisp with a slight metallic twang. Toasted cookie dough malts, with a light sweetness, settle in, along with some molasses and caramelt. Finishes with a hint of noble bitterness and some tobacco-y malt sweetness. Medium bodied, with an almost creamy feel. Very nice."
"The malty sweetness is not thick and syrupy, not cloyingly sweet, but a very well done, dominate malty sweetness that I would be looking for in a good Märzen."
"The taste is very smooth. Malt and caramel, buttered bread, gentle hops, and something vegetal. Very tasty. Very drinkable. It was a perfect complement to kielbasa and boiled potatoes. One of the better dunkels I have had."
"This beer is a deep ruby/ cola colored drink, nice-sized cream colored head on the top. Good amount of lacing. Nice chocolaty malt scent. The taste is mainly malts, chocolate and caramel tones, some toastedness to the taste as well, with a fair amount of hops rounding out the back. Fairly creamy mouth. I would say that this is a good offering of one of my lesser-favored styles. A nice malty treat."
"Half a liter bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a deep deep red, almost black color with one finger of head. There is a little bit of lacing. The smell is very malty, lots of burnt malt, and some chocolate and espresso aromas. The taste is also malty and is fairly sweet. More chocolate and a little bit of caramel as well. Even a touch of hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is decently thick for a dunkel. The drinkability is great, as it goes down smooth. This is a really nice dunkel lager."
"Made for session. Splitting this with another BA who is picking up his part of my last run to Corral Liquors."
"this is a good session beer for dark bavarian beer lovers."
"had a second bottle, more sourness. no roast"
"This is dark lager as it should be...pretty much as close as you'll get to sex in a lager glass."
"This is a great beer. A nice mix of toastiness, darkness, sweetness, and goodness. A perfect lunch and/or dinner beer."
"Poured into a pint glass from their 500ml bottle. Attractive clear mahogany, with a bubbly creamy head that slowly dissipates. Head is gone before the beer is, and doesn't leave a lot of lacing. Nose is of malts and molasses and dark fruits. Lots of sweet toasted malts in the taste, nicely balanced with a touch of hops that lets the malt sweetness carry throught without being too sweet in the finish. This is light-bodied and creamy, carbonation a little less than I anticipated. It drinks smoothly and easily...time for another."
"It pours a translucent dark brown with a small tan head that holds up pretty well. The aroma is almost solely of toasted malt. The taste is pretty well straightforward toasted malt, with maybe a hint of hops in the finish. The feel is to the medium side of light with a decent amount of carbonation. This is a beer that could be a regular option for a solid toasted malt lager."
"from the bottle. poured a nice mahogany with a noce fluffy light tan head. aroma, roasted nuts, caramel, honey, toffee, raisins, and a hint of hops.flavor,malts,honey, dark fruits, plums, nutty, a nice smooth mouthfeel. enjoyed this beer will buy more"
"This beer is a dark brown with a reddish tint with a nice creamy tan head. The aroma is a lightly sweet and grainey with a hint roasted biscuit and maybe a little chocolate. The flavor starts out with a sweet molasses and finishes with a dry roasted bitterness."
"Poured a rich clear red lager that had a huge white rocky head that subsided quickly. The aroma was of dark carmel malts that bordered on roasted malt with a sweet malt background. The taste was very good with a fresh noble hop bitterness leading a complex malt background comprised of dark malt flavors and sweet clean pilsner malt flavors which finish with a bit more noble hop flavor and then quits leaving the mouth void of flavor. The body is excellent as it is more on the viscous side while also having an agressive carbonation that allows the flavors to cut through the body. Pretty good as a starter beer or as part of a series of beers in a tasting but i find that one of these at a time is plenty."
"A superb example of why light lagers must be removed from their lofty place of popularity."
"It is smooth in the mouth but the overall experience leaves me wanting to try a different beer."
"At 2 dollars for a 17 ounce bottle, this stuff is quite the bargain."
"A dark, fizzy beer with a strong smoky malt flavor and a slick (though a bit yeasty) mouthfeel that really made this brew go down easy. It's definitely got that German lager character to it but it's got more body than your average lager. Taste is good but not remarkable, works well with a plate of sausage on a summer day. Despite the yeastiness, this beer is still light enough that it doesn't inflate your belly, so your friends won't have to roll you out of the biergarten. I've had other liters that are way more ""filling."" A liter of this, and you've still got room for another! Well...."
"This is my frist crack at this style. Lets see what we get. The beer pours a nice dark brown with some reddish hues around the edges. There is about 3 fingers of tan head that fall to about a quarter inch cover of the beer. This is the thickest nose I have found on a beer in a long time. I can almost feel the thickness of the thickness of the brew through the smell. I'm impressed. It smells syrupy sweet (not maple) and of roasted sweet malts. I think it smells divine. The taste is not as strong as I expected from the smell. It starts out as a strong caramel sweet flavor, but ends up tasting like a sweet and grainey on the finish. Mmmm. I read others describe the bready flavors and I can see where that comes from, but I don't think I would have picked that flavor without having read it in other reviews. It is not as thick as I had hoped from the nose...still good. I think one of these beers is enough for me in a night, but I think that come the winter months, I might have to revisit it and see how it tastes with the colder weather."
"Drinkability  This is old-school dead-on for the style, and I really appreciated the craftsmanship that went into this offering from Ayinger."
"Smooth watery mouthfeel that captured a hints of baking chocolate, coffee, and very slight hoppy character. I wasn't impressed with the taste overall but in the same instance I wouldn't mind giving it another try."
"OVerall: A very nice dunkel - What can I say but ""Wunderbar!"""
"A top notch dunkel, no doubt about it. While dunkel beers are typically not using for pure thirst-quenching, I could polish off a few of these brews no problem if I was parched. A nice brew, and a bit of a pleasant surprise."
"Big frothy head. The body is brownish amber in color. There is light carbonation. The smell is a little fruity, something I didnt expect from this beer. My first impression is that this beer has a watery mouth feel and a light finish. After a few drinks I could detect a medium amount of bitter hops, and a little hint of chocolate at the end. The beer was very mild in the flavor department. Nothing stands out. It is very smooth which leads to good drinkability."
"Pours a clear mahogony color with ample carbonation and a large frothy cream head. Aroma is very metallic, with some caramel maltiness in the background. Taste is very clean, but like the aroma there is a good dose of metal in there, seemingly from the hops being used. bready and sweet maltiness help to beef things up a bit, but this just ends up rather bland. nice mouhtfeel & drinkable, but lacking character. This is average."
"Pours a nice deep copperish brown with a lighter tan head. Aromas consistent with a dunkel lager; chocolate, toffee, and some more vinous yeasty notes. Not too many hops to speak of, other than some low-alpha Hersbrucker or something. Munich malt profile in the taste, a slight bit tart and estery in the finish, but certainly not out of its style. This beer is quite wonderful, it takes me back to a brewery that I worked at that no longer exists that brewed an excellent dunkel. In my opinion, this style is a little underappreciated. It's a great summer eve quaffer. Recommended."
"John"
"Non-aggressive malt prominence cut by fine bubble carbonation. Highly enjoyable and drinkable."
"Crystal clear burgandy tone. One finger creamy beige head. Lacing is quite nice. There's some thick, heavy grainy and wort-like aromas. And sticky molasses too. I like it. Nicely carbonated mouthfeel and a body of about medium. The taste is grainy, burnt and a little smokey. Blackened malts add a nice dimension of molasses and brown sugar. And again, there's a sweet wort-like presence. Nice tasting brew."
"Light to medium in body, smooth and sweet, a very good drinker."
"This dunkel lager poured a clear, dark, chestnut brown color with light brown foam that settled. The smell was a very strong caramel malt aroma with notes of bread, and coffee. The taste was not overly sweet: caramel malt, bread, and low hop presence. The mouthfeel was lightly sweet and creamy and malty. The body was medium-full with medium carbonation. The finish was sharp and dry. This was a good dunkel lager."
"The fact that the head poured light brown meant that this beer was going to be a trip to the dark side of lagers. The first sip exuded toffee esters with lots of dark malt. The finish is slightly sweet but works with the balance of the beer. Ayinger are one those big German brewers such as Spaten that produce a lot of very good quality beers that really don't disapoint. This beer may not make the top 50 but is a very nice example of the dark lager style."
"Zum wohl!"
"After a recent spate of dark lagers that seemed more like pale lagers with some dark coloring thrown in for effect, this was a pleasant beer. Caramel and toffee were the dominating notes, with a rather odd, but not unpleasant, turn at the end, with some tartness sliding in, almost a hint of sour apple. The mouthfeel was a touch on the thin side, but perhaps this was just my perception because the caramel and toffee flavors suggested that it should be more chewy. Not the best I've had of the style, but certainly better than average."
"apart from the carbonation level..this is a nice drinkable dunkel."
"This is very drinkable. It would probably work great when trying to convince someone who has no experience with any dark beers that dark doesn't equal bad."
"Had this bottle at Anam Cara this weekend. Cloudy chocolate brown when served. The aroma is very strong, the malt is exactly like dark rye bread! I found the taste to be rely very heavily on the smooth and slightly sweet malt. Finish was surprisingly slightly citrusy. Pretty easy to drink, especially if you favor the dark bready German beers."
"Dunkels are such a rarity in most of the U.S. that I'm always happy to come across one. It pours a deep, dark reddish amber with a thin beige head that dissipates quickly. Chocolate and malt (think malted milk balls) are front and center in the aroma along with a graininess not unlike fresh hay. Coffee, chocolate and a bit of toffee dominate the flavor with enough tea-like hops just for balance. A light-bodied brew, but hey it's a lager."
"The brew pours a nice dark ruby brown color. A large off white head was present but soon left. Aroma is a bit sweet with malt and a few grassy tones are mixed in. Put in a few whiffs of caramel and you have this brew. The taste is a bit smooth with a malt front and a dry very mild bitter finish. It is easy to drink and a enjoyable brew."
"Very carbonated dark clear copper body with a great foamy head, generous and long-lasting. Aroma is malty and showed hints of herbal honey and brown sugar. The taste is definitely on the sweet end, dark earthy fruits with notes of smoke in the finish. So quaffable that you basically feel the water quality used in this concoction was as good as it gets. Aftertaste is... fresh, like I had just brushed my teeths with more toothpaste than I should have used. Still, what I prefered about this beer is its refreshing lager character combined with a marvellous creamy round texture which makes you keep it on the tongue for a while before swallowing. Cheers Todd."
"Pours a see through brown with a nice fluffy rocky white head that sticks around a bit too long-- let me drink my beer damn you. The smell is of nicely roasted malt with a bit of caramel and coffee? not strong coffee - kinda like walking by the coffee isle at the supermarket. Taste is of malt with a bit of malt sweetness that drys out at the end. This isnt that complex a beer, but then again i dont think it should be. The mouthfeel is nice with a nice carbonation level and the beer is extremely drinkable. Gimme some roasted pork, spaetzle and this and I am set. One of the better dunkle lagers that I have had."
"The taste, a funky sweetness blended in rustically with some hops and stuff just, ya know, doesnt really do it and the thin body doesn't go properly with the taste. But oh well, I'm picky now."
"The beer pours a translucent brown color with a thick off-white head. The aroma is good. It boasts of pale and roasted malts. It has a very pleasant toasted scent. The taste is very good. It is very malty with a crisp, refreshing finish. It has a nutty, roasted flavor that is really attractive. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a great beer; one of the best Dunkels I've ever had."
"Drinkability is slightly above average."
"paid $2.49 for 1 pint 1oz."
"Overall: I dont usually take to dark lagers, but I really enjoyed this offering from Ayinger and found the clean tasting malt with a hint of smokiness to be nicely balanced. Far from complex, rather solid and simple but quaffable."
"Dark coppery color was observed immediately after pouring. Nicely carbonated with a creamy colored head. Slightly sweet nose with no alcohol detected. The taste was just on the sweeter side, crisp clean back end. The taste however didnt stick around, it just sort of disappeared."
"Bought a 500 ml bottle to try. It poured out a deep caramel color with a nice head that left a nice lacing around the glass. The smell reminded me of a sweet chocolate aroma. The beer is very refreshing and goes down very smooth. I did notice after a few sips that it did leave my mouth a little dry, but nothing too severe. This was a good dark lager and I think it would perfect fall weather beer."
"Color was slightly lighter than the Hofbrau offering and can be best described as a cinnammon like brown. Head retention was longer and created a very attractive glass. Taste is slightly sweet and slightly bitter-a nice balance that would appeal to most beer and some non beer drinkers. Taste would seem watered down for a fan of big IPAs or Imperial Stouts as there are no real rich flavors but a balance struck that creates a very drinkable brew."
"The body seemed a little light for the style, although that and the carbonation made for better drinkability."
"A beautiful dunkles, and a real drinker to boot."
"Poured a dark amber/copper color with a tan head that was weak at best. Nose is of strong malt flavor, like the smell one gets of liquid malt extract when brewing. The flavor is all malts in my opinion. Lots of caramel and breadiness in it. Some other weaker flavors sucy as coffee and chocolate are there but in weak doses. The body seemed to be lacking and a bit too weak and this beer definitely had a chewy texture to me. One of my friends loved this and one of my friends hated it, I'm in the middle."
"In the glass a translucent deep mahogany color, the head mastodonic in size, the texture spumescent and the color a winsome tan. As the head dissolves a satiny sheet of lace is formed to conceal the glass. Nose has hints of caramel, sweet, crisp and fresh, a treat for the senses with start lightly sweet and loaded with malt, top is middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is prickly in its acidity, the hops appropriate to the style, droughty aftertaste that is long lasting, a fine quaffing beer and a pleasure to sample."
"15.9 ounces of beer messiah here, trapped in a beer wasteland of Davis, WV we checked out a little hippie joint called the Purple Fiddle. Great live music, awesome atmosphere, pure friendliness, and some solid bottled beers in their lineup. Appearance: Deep amber brown chocolate tone with a full tan creamy head nice full patches of lacing here. Aroma: Darker roasts with buttery sweet creaminess just a pleasant overall scent. Taste: Nice crisp great hop profile subtle German Tettenags one of the Noble hops here, slight harshness with a musty dark roasted malt some nut tones in the very good flavor ties together well. Mouthfeel: Fluffiness and good carbonation equal good times in a bottle. Drinkability: Simple effortless and oh so good."
"Recomended."
"A good Munich-area brew that is dominated by a heavy malt taste and texture. It is slightly sweet with a slight cream and coffee undertone. Similar in style to a Paulaner Salvator, but not as strong or sweet tasting. As far as sweet, dark German Dunkel style beers go, it is probably one of the better session beers because it is not too syrupy-sweet too prohibit having a few glasses full. This beer has a wonderful smell to it with a dark brown color. It is malty without being too thick or molasses-like in mouthfeel. It is far better in the bottle than when I had it on tap in Aying right from the source because the bottled flavor is considerably stronger."
"A medium bodied beer. It feels very nice and it drinks well. A nice crisp finish to this beer."
"Nice lager, smooth and refreshing. Malt certainly outweighs hops, but overall this is a relatively light brew. I'm curious as to why it's referred to as an ""alt bier"". It does, however, remind me a little of an alt (but isn't an alt an ale?). Anyway, it's a good beer if you like this style. I would much rather drink a doppelbock if I want a dark German fare. As others noted, would probably be very good with food."
"Served from a 500mL bottle from Whole Foods poured into an unchilled pint glass. Looks dark but quite clear. Bitter smell, with strong plum or raisin influences. Pours with a very nice head and holds it well. Taste is crisp and light, with a burnt hopp flavor. Carbonation level is very good. Very little aftertaste as it goes down very smoothly leaving you wanting more. Personally, I enjoyed this beer more as it warmed up and the hopp flavor came out a bit more. Overall a very solid beer. I second some other reviewers in saying this would be great with strong-flavored food such as brats."
"This beer was served in a short squat stoneware mug, so I never got a chance to evaluate the color. It had a light tan head, with an aroma of malt along with a hint of alcohol. The taste was a bit dry, and because it started out cold was not as malty as I would have liked. The dunkel as it warmed up began to release a malty sweetness to my flavor receptacles. At first when cold the predominant taste was in the finish, it was one of bitterness from the hops. When warmed the maltiness balance out and in fact dominated the previous bitter hoppiness. I detected a hint of raisin, some caramelized breadiness. Quite clean as a lager should be, no fruitiness. The malt flavor was not sweet more of a cracker/ breadiness to it."
"I've been buying beers to leave with my dad to try when I go visit him. This one makes the trip in the next six-pack. Quite enjoyable."
"Clear amber-brown ale with thick head that settles down quickly. Aroma is sweet malt with hints of plums, raisins and coffee. Smooth and medium bodied and slightly crisp. Flavor is highly malty and slightly sweet, fruity and nutty. I'm not a big fan of this style but this is really well done and I enjoyed it thoroughly."
" "
"This beer was a deep mohagany color with an off white head, which didn't last for long. The beer is crystal clear when held to a light. The smell is a bit faint but consisted of dark fruit and strong roasted malt. The taste up front is a bit sweet with a strong malt presence. The finish is sweet, has sort of a dark fruit taste, almost like plum. I can't put my finger on it. The hops seem lacking but come through in the aftertaste a little bit. Mouthfeel is a bit sharp on the tongue with a medium body. A refreshing brew, and one I will drink again."
"When this beer was poured into my glass, it poured a large tan head with fine-small bubbles. The hue is reddish-brown and it has a caramel aroma to it. The lacing was fair on the sides of my glass. It had a hint of coffee in the taste. This was a decent Dunkel, but I have had better."
"Dark Brown color, large head, malty aroma. The richly roasted malts are slightly sweet. Medium bodied. Slight hoppyness. Good balance. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and some what dry. Aftertaste is malty. Very nice beer. Very drinkable."
"Poured out a rich smoky brown with a medium sized head with plenty of staying power. Bright malty aroma. Taste is of caramel thought a bit sour on the edges. A slight alcohol feel at the very end. Smooth as silk going down. Nice tart aftertaste. A nice German brew when I'm not in the mood for a porter or stout. Will drink again easily..."
"This brew poured a large head of fine to medium sized bubbles and a carbonated semi-transparent brown body. It has a mild malt aroma appropriate for a Dunkel. This brew is a bit on the fizzy side for a Dunkel. Its flavor is a bit burnt or roasted caramel and this with some spicey notes."
"Maybe this was affected by being drunk in the same week as Heritage's Traditional Dark and Liefman's Kriek. The more standard beer just didn't have a chance."
"Redish/brown colour. Foamy head doesn't last too long. Slight maltiness in the nose. Lightly hopped. Hints of molasses & very light licorice with a pinch of caramel but yet not sweet at all. The finish is very mellow & starts to dry, almost disappearing too fast."
"Reddish brown colour, good head. Moderate aroma of oak and caramel malts. Medium body, typical dunkel, some toffee flavour but not too sweet. Must be good with food. Lightly hopped, pleasant, easy drinking. Maybe not the greatest beer in the world, but impossible to dislike, if you like beer at all (which the other ratings prove)."
"Drinkability: Good stuff here. The thin body and mellow flavor profile make this a beer I could drink more then a few of."
"It's clear dark brown/amber. A medium sized tan head forms and lasts a little while. The aroma is pretty much caramel maltiness. It's mellow and pleasing just like the flavor. Very malty this beer is, with no discernable hop character. VERY smooth, light carbonation. I really enjoyed this beer. It's light and slightly watery on the tongue, but I don't find that detracting here. I find it drinkable, very drinkable."
"This beer makes one think of fall. Auburn hues to match the leaves outside and a thick tan head that lasts and lasts. ( A portent of the snows to come?) Lace clinging to the glass like frost on the windows. Aromas of smoky deep roasted malts and fresh baked bread. My favorite tastes of Halloween--chocolate and toffee. Rich mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Enjoy this smoky brew in front of a roaring fire if you can."
"Cream-colored head, dissolves quickly. Malt background prominent. Toffeeish sweetness, quick, but pleasing finish.Nutty flavors, coppery, metallic, even. Very little hoppiness, clean, simple. Dark lager isn't one of my favorite styles, but this has to be one the best."
"Pours a black colour topped by a thick creamy head that doesn't settle after the first few sips. Sweet malty aroma whith caramel hints. The mouthfeel is average though. This dark dunkel is an average brew tha its worth tasting"

"Fresh bottle. Pours a clear deep reddish/almost brown body with a firm, foamy tan head that holds well. The aroma offers a lightly nutty and toasty maltiness. The body is light with an exceptionally fine carbonation that leaves it creamy and silky smooth in the mouth.The flavor offers a rich maltiness that's clearly derived from Munich malt, and lightly toasty and cocoa-ish notes from deeply kilned dark malts. At times it can even be borderline chocolatey. The hop flavor is minimal, and the bitterness restrained, serving only to support the maltiness."
"Dark brown with hints of red on the margins.  Pours with a foamy light brown head the gives way to a persistent fine lace over the top and particularly around the edge.  Smell is distinctively sweet with tones that somehow recalls a Scotch ale.  Taste is smooth and full, with bready, caramely sweetness.  Full malty taste barely lets through any hints of hops or alcohol until the end.  Very smooth mouthfeel that lingers a bit long.  A really nice dark, malty beer."
"Pours a beautiful clear brown color with a nice light brown head that slowly sinks.  The brew gives off a pleasant aroma of biscuity chocolate and a slight bit of some earthy hops in the background can be noticed as well.  The taste starts off with some fairly mellow, not overpowering, chocolatey malt tastes that share the space with a nice biscuity presence as well.  The earthy noble hops are slightly more assertive in the taste and are perfectly balanced with the malt so as to not let the malt flavors get out of control.  The brew is smooth but not too full in the mouth and remains rather refreshing for a darker/maltier brew.  I really need to get to Germany so I can start sampling some of these when they are fresh.  If they are this good here then I can't imagine how nice they would be when fresh on the other side of the pond."
"An excellent little brew i think. Thin to medium body, light roasty/toasty malt flavours. Bit of chocolate and caramel in there aswell, a great session dunkel, in my opinion."
"Very thick creamy caramel head that stuck around for awhile.  Dark ruby/near black color with good carbonation.  Very sweet malty aroma which carries through into the flavor.  There is a slight roasty undertone, but the malt overpowers it if cold.  As it warms, the roasty and malty flavors balance a little better, but the mouthfeel is a bit thin.  A very good dunkel."

"Nice color poured well,not overly sweet but just right.Really liked the caramelly aroma,one of my favorite traditional Bavarian darks.Creamy texture with a cookie dough-like flavor with moderate crispness in the finish.Not overly sweet with just mild caramel and and brown sugar notes."
"Notes: ""Old Bavarian Dark Beer"" is what Altbairisch Dunkel translates into. This beer is just chock-full of malt, the model dark lager for brewers to mold from. Absolutely Superb!"
"Clear mahogany color with light tan head. Slightly bitter but nicely malty as well. Extremely well balanced. After drinking the heineken dark in the same session, I was worried that I was not going to like the style, but the Altbairisch proved to be a wonderful beer. Dark fruit and sweetness came across in nose and flavor. Finished s little bitter. Very nice."
"Very appealing crystal clear red hue, with a thick, creamy, persistent head.  It's beautiful.  The aroma is of rich, malty, toasty decocted Munich malt melanoidins.  Medium bodied.  Toasty malt flavors are noticeable initially, and are surprisingly well balanced by a slightly floral Hallertauer hop flavor and bitterness.  It finishes with just a touch of toasted flavor on the back of the tongue along with a bit of residual sweetness.  Wow-- what a balance.  Hop bitterness and flavor , malt, slightly roasted grain flavor coalesce perfectly.  It's been a while since I've had this beer and I'm pleasantly surprised.  I drank this one at cellar temps (approx. 55 deg.) to allow the malt favors to come through.  For a 5% ABV ""session"" beer, this is a highly enjoyable and complex one..  Give it a shot."
"This handsome leather-brown beer is sweetly aromatic with whiffs of caramel. The malts are whelming and hops indistinct, yet the beer has an underlying bitterness that betrays its malt profile. It's quite an impressive balancing act. The water feels very smooth and pillowy in the mouth, as with all of Aying's brews, and has their trademark compulsive drinkability (you'll find it disappearing from your glass faster than you it want to - always a good sign). Not my absolute favorite effort of theirs, but well worth drinking if you are interested in the style. Should pair wonderfully with the appropriate food (sausages, and tangier darker meats, perhaps?)."
"Gorgeous cloudy brown with a creamy tan head.  A potent whif of cocoa, malts, and gaseous alchohals.  Roasted nuts, malts, chocolate.  Well rounded, smooth texture.  Unfortunately I tasted a hint of metal.  -1 on taste for that.  Still a great beer.  Not entirely too expensive compared to say Samuel Smith, and almost the same quality."
