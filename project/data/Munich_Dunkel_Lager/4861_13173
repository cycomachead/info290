3.64,0.8,3.25,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Taste: It's pleasant, but I wasn't expecting it to be so much like a lager. Being a lager, it's extremely drinkable, but it' has a somewhat watery consistency, and it's lacking big, bold flavor. It's a tasty beer, and a dunkel that could actually be very refreshing on a hot summer day, if you're craving a dark beer that isn't too heavy. In that instance, this would be an excellent beer. For its style, it's actually very quite good. As a whole though, it's nothing too special. It is probably the most drinkable dark lager beer that I've ever had though, so that counts for something.","Alextricity","Jan 18, 2013"
2.77,-23.3,3.75,3.5,2,3.5,2.75,"O - Smelled like a solid dunkel with its malt emphasis without exceeding extreme dark grains but had a little twang underneath it all.

3.68,1.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 2/5/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, biscuit, brown bread, light roast, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of dark/bready malt and moderate hop/yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, brown bread, light roast, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of dark/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice dunkel lager style. Well balanced dark/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors with good robustness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 19, 2012"
3.88,7.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Had this on tap at the Frankenmuth Brewery. Wasn't able to watch them pour it, but it arrived with a small, one finger head. Dark brown/mahogany and somewhat cloudy in appearance. Had a malty, cooked grain aroma. Somewhat sweet tasting with a rich maltiness and light on hops. Smooth and full bodied but not heavy.

4,10.8,4,4,4,4,4,"The second-oldest brewery in the US is brewing again. Dark chestnut-hued brew, bordering on black. Lacing dresses the glass very well. Fresh-toasted dark bread flaunts the malt aroma; very clean. Strong malt presence here—even with it teetering on the dry side, there are a lot of complex layers that peel away, sip after sip. Heavy toasted taste eventually calms down with an even malt flavor. Mild hopping is just enough to keep the malt in check. Very good drinking—spot-on for style, and on par with its authentic German counterparts.","BeerAdvocate","Dec 14, 2011"

The aroma was hard to pick up, but did get a little bread and some sweet malts. The taste starts out with some hops followed by some chocolate malts, raisins, and coffee with a roasted and smoked flavor throughout. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy and overall a very good tasting beer. First time I have tried this style and hope others I try will be as good as this one.","DannyDan","Sep 15, 2011"

3.7,2.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Inviting hue of deep amber/garnet, topped by a pale khaki head. Nice patchy lacing was noticed clinging to the sides of the glass as the head diminished. Malty nose with some roasted coffee notes - interesting. Adding to the complexity of the nose was a hint of toffee and caramel, which became more prenounced as the beer warmed. Smooth, clean flavor imparts a little nuttiness off the bat. Flavor moves into a surprising roasted flavor, indicative of chocolate malt. Welcome, yet unexpected. Here enters the coffee and toffee noted in the nose, with slight bitter chocolate. Very enjoyable turn for this easy drinking lager. Mouthfeel is typical of the style, crisp and refreshing, despite the roasty flavors floating around. The interaction of the bottom fermenting yeast and roasted malts make this a good brew with more complexity than you would expect.","BeerFink","May 13, 2006"
2.88,-20.2,3,2.5,3,3,3,"Part of a sampler at the brewery. This is another beer I remember from before the big storm. Clear reddish brown with a thin off white head. Very little aroma at all, mild malt and faint yeast. The flavor is a little lackluster, slightly malty, not really roasted, and then a yeasty aftertaste. The body is okay. This was a bit of a disappointment, but it still is a nice beer to drink.","redmosquito","Nov 15, 2004"
