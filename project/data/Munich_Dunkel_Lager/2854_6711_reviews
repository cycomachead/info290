"Appearance 3.75, Aroma 4.25, Flavor 4, Palate 3.5, Overall 4"
"Smooth and malty, but a little metallic. Not quite there flavour wise. Hops are almost non existent, and there’s an earthy yeast note on top of the metal. I don’t think I’d have it again."

"Thick and chewy, yet lagery. An interesting break from the various IPAs and PAs I've had in the last few weeks. Love varying the style, this one ain't a bad example either."

"This is one of the better Dunkel beers I've had though, so don't be put off by my complaint about the body depth."
""
""
""
"Pours a pretty copper/amber in color with a 1-finger off white head. Some sticky lacing was seen with each sip. The aroma is of a sweet dark bready malt. The taste is about the same with just a slight hoppy finish. Very light though and not bad at all actually. Overall a good dark brew."
""
""
"O: it's got lots of sweet malt notes, especially in the nose, but overall it's underwhelming. better dunkels surely exist."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty good brew."

"I am no expert but I do appreciate premium lagers...This Dunkel is up there in the outstanding category to me...It does lack a bit in the area of bitterness...and could use more of the burnt flavor...A good beer...and I do like drinking and serving it.."

"This was my after tour sample at the brewery in Flensburg (home of the ""PLOP""). It is a wonderful dark beer with a wonderful nutty aroma and nice dark malt taste. It has a nice creamy head and goes well with the bread, meat, fish and cheese they served with it. I was impressed with this beer as it did not seem to have the bitterness of most dark beers that pour almost black. A nice balance of malt to hops. All in all a really nice beer."
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice hue, giant head and plenty of lacing. Nose is a really solid combination of sweet components on a roasted malt bed. Flavor is light roasted malt with a little bitterness. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"No complaints here with this brew. One high tech package with the bottle but form a beer drinkers perspective it certainly lives up to a premium beers reputation. Mild yet tasty. Which is why people drink beverages. For the taste and this brew did itself justice in that category."
""
"O. I had quite high hopes for this, but it was really quite disappointing. Very easy to drink, and if it were on tap I could quite happily session it, but nothing to get excited about."
""
""
"Didn’t like much the taste of raw malt on it, but has its own character."
""
"This one was a nice deep copper color, topped off with a thick tan head, very fluffy and stuck around for a bit; there's some great lacing too. The body itself is clear with medium carbonation. Mild hop flavors are the first thing you taste, strong grass flavors come into play and the aroma is pretty much a copy of the flavors, wheat grass, hops, and a mild sweet smell all mixed into one. The taste is slightly bitter overall and its light bodied, plus its goes down pretty smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouth feel, aroma and appearance were fine. It was just lacking in taste, quite frankly."
""
""
"O: A nice Dark Lager, with the sweetness held back."

"I have to say I was always wondered about the little beers I would see all over but never got around to trying the until recently when a German friend bought me a sample pack. Don’t let the look of these little beers fool you and the fact I usually see it in gas and train stations. It is actually really decent beer. The dunkel was very weak in most characteristic to this style. The flavor and the aroma were very mild in the roasted qualities that I think a dunkel should have. There was some roastiness but just very faint. The feel was a little thin but not bad and it was definitely easy to drink. There was a great malt flavor however even though not roasted and a mild hop flavor."
"I bought it because of the cool bottle, but I definitely wasn't impressed with the beer. It tastes like a watered down heineken dark. Skunky flavor, little mouthfeel. No malt, no hops, just blah. Maybe this one sat on the shelf too long, but I won't buy this again."
"Pretty lean and light for the style - nothing in the way of fruit to ease up the toasted grain. But still pleasant - like most Flensburger beers, it makes up for in drinkability what it lacks in depth and adherence to style."
"A very nice Munchen Lager. Sessionable. Very interesting when paired with yellow cheese. I would buy it again for sure."
""
"As far as the dunkel world goes this beer certainly is on the lager end, so no confusion there. It has that character that is almost always in lagers due to there yeast, and then it has some of the darker malt and sweeter side that the Dunkel truck delivers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A decent dunkel, for sure, though it is on the lighter side for the style"
""
"A quite decent malt bomb."
"O: Easy drinker, but could us a bit more character. Still a nice Dunkel."
"Swing top bottles are fantastic. The beer is brown with at thin head. The smell is clove alcohol and gingerbread. The taste is more savory than some dunkels with some prune chocolate. Seem like it has more alcohol than 4.8%. Perhaps a bit overpriced. Good, but Spaten is better and less expensive. Buy the hefe if you need the bottles."
"hits the spot! a serious good beer. satisfying."
"Good beer. Feels a little flat. SOme more body and carbonation could have made this one a good sessioner, but it goes down TOO fast."
"The taste is an interesting combination of the warm maltiness typical for the Dunkel-Style and the fresh hoppiness of northern German lagers which surprisingly results in a kind of british elegance in the end. Very well balanced and tasty."
"Pours a medium amber with off white head that recedes quickly. Nose is a little toasty but not much else. Palate was surprisingly light, with a rather thin body, some toasty malt flavors that have just a suggestion of roastiness, and a modicum of hop influence thrown in there. Finishes light and easy to drink, but not very appetizing with interesting flavors to crave on the next sip. Boring."
"I would not go out of my way to find this but also wouldn't turn one down if offered again."
"The taste is for sure a winner, it is nowhere near the top of the sweetness threshold for this style, it has a surprising hop bite. The malts are nice with a hint of caramel and an ever so slight roastiness. It is smooth and refreshing, my favorite beer style of summer."
"The taste is reminiscent of toasted crackers. The malt is delicious and slightly sweet. Very faint hallertauer-like hop character. The beer is fairly light-bodied with a gainly mouthfeel. Drinkability is better than average."
"Sister brought this back from a recent trip to Germany! Poured copper/chestnut with two fingers of white head and great lacing. Very carbonated. Crisp noble hops aroma and some biscuit; not much else. Initially very caramel/malty in the flavor, then a pronounced bitterness midpalate, dissolving to a big dry finish. The mouthfeel was very carbonated, and very thin. Sessionable, but much more bitter than I expected this to be."
"a very thin feeling dunkel with a toastiness and bake apple malt quality. the malt doesn't give it much body though. its a lean feel of a beer with a bitter end of smokiness. palate is not bad and has all the quintessential parts for its style but lack in feel. nice molasses nose. it has room for improvement. although the span of the flavor is quite wide for something this light in body i really respect that. it made it quite drinkable."
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer- certainly worth a shot, but nothing too exciting here."
"This shows a light copper color with a fair white cover that disappears to a ring quickly with marginal lacing. The aroma says malty licorice and root beer with some earthy pear sweetness. Quite interesting. The flavor offers more earthiness, malt and chocolate licorice with some leafy hop bitterness. There's a tart molasses idea, fine subtle carbonation that makes a reasonably drinkable brew. Full of malt flavors, an interesting light-medium bodied brew with a crisp feel. I like it fine and would revisit any time."
"This beer is like a darker version of a Pilsner. Maybe crossed with a bock. Lets just say its pretty drinkable. Not my first choice at a store, but this is probably the best you can get for the price. I think it was around $1.30 for a single."
"D – Oh yeah. Go for it."
"Poured into pint glass, it showed dark copper with a head that lingered for only a moment. Smells malty and slightly spicy. Taste is a little watery and has a slightly coppery aftertaste.. I was disappointed and it reminds me of every other dark german beer you can find in a well-stocked supermarket. I could still drink this all day long watching football and eating standard bar food. Not great... but better than budweiser."
"D: Excellent Flensburger, in my opiinion deserves the same rating as its sister Flensburger Pilsener."
"Beer is really sweet, a little sweeter than expected. I am picking up some alcohol as well. Body is medium but the beer overall is a little hard to drink. Not feeling this one."
"Overall, I liked it although I had expected a little bit more complexity."
"Nice beer. Got this bottle a couple of weeks ago at Surdyk's in Minneapolis. Opened with a rousing POP and poured with a nice foamy, frothy tan head and some lace. Head mostly settled down soon. Color is clear dark amber - brown with some dark red orange highlights. Aroma was dark malt, cocoa, earth, and a little roastiness. Flavor is about the same and well balanced. Not much sweetness nor too much of anything, really. Body is nice and so is carbonation. Real easy drinking beer. Nice clean finish. Definitely a session."
" "
"The body is pretty thin, even for the style. Carbonation is good however. Classic German-style high drinkability."
"Mouthfeel was lighter than expected, but still would consider a medium-bodied brew."
"Pretty sure this is an old bottle, but it is still a terrific German dunkel. You won't find any of the American craft breweries turning out anything like this. I could drink this all day at a sunny sidewalk cafe in Munich."
"I recommend this beer to anyone looking for a good dunkel."
"clear dark reddish-brown. minimal off-white head. dark bready, caramelly malt w/some dark dried fruit in the nose. characterful malts dominate the taste as well with a noticeable sweetness, finishing dry and slightly tart. light to medium in body and crisp. quite sessionable. would be great fresh on-tap."
"This would be great to serve at a party. The flip top makes for a great conversation piece. But at $3 a bottle US...it's a little impractical."
"D - A nice mild yet interesting beer. I could imagine enjoying a liter or two in a German square on a hot summer day."
"Pours a clear amber brown with no head basically. Nose is way too sickly sweet malts. Not entirely pleasant. Flavor brings a bit of the same, but with a bit of an earthy tone and a slight leafy thing. Too much malt sweetness though. Feel is slick and sticky. Carbonation nips a bit at the tongue. Eh. This is okay. Like I said, too malty sweet. Pass"
"This pours an absolutely beautiful deep copper and burnt orange color with a gorgeous airy white head. Massive lacing and heaving carbonation make for a near perfect appearance. The is soft and floral with big cracker and toast notes. Subtle hoppiness adds depth to this malty lager. The taste is equally impressive with rich caramel and vienna malt characteristics. A nice hop finish cleans up the flavors and dries out nicely. Very slight toffee sweetness comes through in the aftertaste. The sharp carbonation thins out the body and makes this insanely drinkable. The mouth is left slightly gritty and metalic, but in the best way. A biscuit with caramel and hops in liquid form. I feel privileged to sample this fresh and find it to be one of the most enjoyable session brews I have tried. This is truly a style that is not cherished nearly enough in the US."
"I would probably get again."
"Why does it come in a tiny bottle, when it should be served on draft by the liter?"
"¡Salud!"
"Pours amber with a nice initial head that fades to a thin cap and leaves some light lacing. Smells toasty and grainy, like a gresh baked loaf of whole grain bread. A touch of honeyed malt sweetness on the finish. The taste is similar, but a bit lighter and grainier rather than breadier. Fairly light in body, and dry up front with a sweeter finish. Decent beer, but a little too sweet to really session despite the low abv."
"Fizzy and effervescent. This dunkel lacks a bit in the way of depth and body. Semi-sweet maltyness combines with some earthy bittering hops to form a simple, easy drinking brew. Smooth, light bodied and refreshing. This beer is far from bad, but falls short of a really good dunkel. A nice value at under $2 a bottle, I will probably give this one a go again."
"I don't prefer lighter lagers like this because of the lack of flavor, but I wouldn't turn one down if it was free."
"decent drinking, although i probably won't seek it out again, esp due to the premium price here in china."
"this beer is ok to try, but i wouldn't seek it out."
" Light, smooth, easy drinking, thirst quenching, very nice!"
"This beer is great looking and delicious, one of the better beers in one of my favorite styles. I'll definitely be on the lookout for this one more often. An absolutely fantastic dunkel recommended to anyone who wants to try this style or is looking for something a notch up from the Warsteiner that's typically the most prominent dunkel imported in the United States."
"Quite light in body."
"Clear copper color with a nice lasting beige head. Some medium roasty sweet malt and nutty smells. Kind of light bodied, but nice nuttiness to the flavor. Nice mild nutty aftertaste and a pretty nice little beer all around. Very sessionable, and I would actually get this again."
"D: Super drinkable. My new session beer. The Warsteiner lacked some flavor, and Beck's Dark, in my opinion, chose the wrong combination of hops. Bass is good, but is so malt oriented it will get boring after a while. This is wonderful. A little out of the way from the mainstream, but worth every penny."
"Overall: I was expecting a darker colour from a Munich Dunkel. Overall a very appealing and balanced beer. Best Flensburger in the market."
"Mouthfeel: medium body, prickly carbonation, minerally"
"Fliptop bottle pours a clear coppery body with a large beige head. Plenty of frothy lacing left on the glass. Aroma is toffee, caramel, spicy hops and some apple skins. Medium body and a nice medium carbonation. Taste opens with malty toffee and toasted grain. Hops quickly answer with a nice balance of spicy and earthy noble bitterness. Very solid for style though the color was lighter than expected."
"Has a more reddish color to me than brown,I was expecting it to be a little darker.Smells of nice light roasted malts and a hint of sweetness.The head in the picture is not even close to what i got in the pour,none the less,this is a fantastic dunkel.When you smell and taste this beer you know it's German.Something about the smell gives them away.I think it's the particular yeast strain.Not too heavy on the palette,the right carbonation lets the sweet malts shine through.This beer is sooo smooth in the mouth and going down.No rotten aftertaste of any kind.Anyone who loves dark lagers...do not deprive yourself of this masterpiece!!!"
"A highly drinkable beer with lots of character. I liked it!"
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pilsner glass. The beer pours a deep amber, forming a creamy tan 1 inch head, leaving medium lacing on the glass. The aroma is strong sweet malt, giving it a caramel/nutty smell. The taste is just as good. Sweet malts creating a delicious light nutty flavor. Medium mouthfeel and smooth finish. Low abv. and exceptional full flavor make for a very drinkable brew. Overall, I was very impressed. This is the best dunkel lager I have had to date. Highly recommended!"
"Flensburger Dunkel poured a brownish red color with a beige head from a brown twelve ounce swing top bottle. The aroma is okay, nothing special though, primarily malt. The flavor is kind of average, a bit estery, and some toasted or maybe slightly roasted malt. Worth a try."
"I love these bottles. I will be refilling it soon with my own concoction. Beer looks very pretty after you pour it. A dark clear amber color with a very good off white head and good lacing. Smell is slightly malty. I taste a lot of toasted malts very full, with a slight nuttyness. This beer finishes with a slight sweetness that is pleasant. This style of lager is probably my favorite."
"Overall, a solid beer to enjoy."
"Pours transparent red-brown with an inch of quickly-disappearing head and sparse lace. The aroma is straightforward, full of sugary caramel malt. The flavor is, luckily, more complex. Grainy toasted malts and hops are predominant, with touches of banana bread on hard mineral water. Finishes with a balanced sweetness and dryness, leaving toasted bread and hop notes. Medium thick (nearly syrupy) in the mouth, with almost still body and spare carbonation. Not particularly outstanding, but a nice beer with lunch."
"33cl swing-top bottle with a LOT of pop. Minimal head, though, which is surprising. Amber color & rather still looking. The smell is caramel primarily but very muted overall. The taste is roasted, a bit acidic but with a nice malt finish. Hops are nowhere to be seen. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated but a bit watery. Drinkability is good, as the crisp finish is refreshing. It's a decent beer but nothing too spectacular. I'd drink it again, I reckon. If I were the reckoning type. Which I am."
"Drinkability: This would make a fabulous session brew!..a very good beer, that I must try again."
"D - Drinkability is high. I need to come back to this."
"12oz. swing top bottle: This one pours a rich, clear amber color. There is a small off-white head that goes with it. The aroma is quite nice. Malty, without being overly sweet. Some breadiness there also, as well as some faint chocolate. Somewhat dry, biscuity malt taste. Some mild spicy hoppiness also. This is quite good."
"Nearly average in every way. But worthy enough for a glass full of drinkin'. I do like the cool little stubby swing top."
"Verdict: let down at first, I thought I bought a dunkel weizen until I tried it. But it grew on me after a bit, though it's nothing special. I wouldn't turn one away, but wouldn't seek another out either. A simple 'dark' lager."
"A very drinkable beer that is true to its style."
"Drinkability/notes: Overall a pleasant, drinkable example."
"Poured from a 12oz fliptop bottle with a date on the back label. Good head and almost no carb. Had a brownish cooper color and a sweet malty smell with overtones of bread. The taste was really good. This is the first of the style that I've had and I was impressed. Will have to try move Dunkle Lagers and see if it holds. The only thing I didn't like about this beer was that the mouthfeel was pretty watery. Not enough to ruin it but enough to remind you on every drink. Overall, good beer and recommend. (4, RR, T, Y)"
"Awesome mist comes off the flip top. Poured a transparent chestnut brown. Small head. Deeper in colour when held to the light. Explosive aroma. Sticky rum like brown sugar. Hard to tell its a weisse at all. Quite flat as far as carbonation goes. Flavour hugely dependent on malt which carries itself a little weak. Little resonance, no mouthfeel. Void of any character. No aftertaste - but no before taste either. Some smokey wood character. Kept me guessing as to what it is exactly. Somethig good is in there, but darn hard to find."
"Mouthfeel was good, with a bit of carbonation, and it was medium in feel."
"Opinion: This is a pretty tasty beer. The sweetness is a good bit more aggressive than most Dunkels, but it is still a nice and easily drinkable beer. I would suspect that this is more of what a historical Dunkel would be like since the attenuation of yeast has gone up over the ages. Perhaps this is more like an original Einbecker. Still this is a good beer and worth a shot."
"Drinkability is very high. An excellent example of the style, one terribly underrepresented on the market."
"The beer was dark in color and had a really good taste to it. I am not a huge fan of dunkel's, but this one was really good. I drank this beer very cold and I recommend drinking it cold."
"M/D- high carbonation, med-heavy body, and very filling."
"Flensburger Dunkel is a decent Munich Dunkel Lager, although I won't be cracking its swing-top again. If I buy any of the Flensburger beers in the future, it'll be the Weizen. Give this one a whirl if you're a fan of the style. Otherwise, you won't regret missing it."
"A very good dunkel from the far north of Germany. It's too bad this style is so under-represented among German imports."
"This looks like a perfect octoberfest... too bad it's a dunkel. The malt flavors emerge as it warms. The last taste was better than the first."
"Reminds me very much of an alt bier. From its location on the map it looks like Flensburg shares the Hanseatic heritage of Dusseldorf - and that heritage shows in this beer. Highly recommend, particuarly if you are an alt afficianado."
"I'm getting used to these Flensburger brews. Pretty good stuff."
"Deasy drinking. I only bought one to try and will return for a few more. Very flavorful and enjoyable."
"Bright, tasty malt handily overcoming my initial misgivings based on the aroma. Medium to full in body, nice grainy texture, good drinkability. Overall, a nice dunkel, indeed. I'd take one anytime."
"Low key, sweet malty aroma touches on maple syrup. Dark amber in color with an attractive fluffy two finger thick head that is mostly lasting. Light sweet malt in the fore invokes honey cakes and sweetened grain cereals. Very well made with no off notes and a beautiful appearance, but the flavor is subdued and the body thinnish."
"Pours out a crystaline nut brown with amber edges and an eggshell head. The head is very thick but not lasting; it quickly fades to a film over the brew. Smell is strong with bits of cappuchino, caramel, oat, and wheat. Blend it together in one bottle and you've got a concoction that you can detect from a good ten inches away from a freshly poured glass. Starts extra smooth and refreshingly crisp with a creme taste. Settles gently sour with lots of hop bitters. There is a sugary undertone to the full-bodied drink. Finishes sour and bitter, dry and strong. The aftertaste is just as edgy and lasting as the rest of the beer."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This is a light to medium bodied beer. The beer is very nicely balanced. This is a dam fine sessionable beer."
"12 oz swing top bottle pours a clear dark amber with a huge creamy off white head that leaves a sticky lacing in my glass, bready, fruity aromas. Nutty caramel, chocolate flavors, medium bodied with a creamy smooth mouthfeel with a somewhat dry finish, a great lager."
"The aroma is toasted grain and bread-like malts. The taste is toasted bread, citric style hop and as I find with alot of German beers, a metallic background, though thisone has a hint of salty water. It doesn't hurt drinkability for its a nice little Dunkel with a cool little bottle."
"This beer seems to be a Munich Dunkel lager, and I am not formiliar with the style, it reminded me of a darker Alt beer. So very drinkable and with a nice maltiness"
"Pours clear copper under a 1.5 finger off-white head with some contour and decent retention. A few spots of lace linger on the glass. The nose is mild caramel, with a distinct flowery hops note. The mouth is thin and well carbonated. The taste is very subdued: some mild smooth sweet caramel malt throughout, without much in the way of hops backing. A pleasant enough brew, but nothing exciting."
"Notes: A very well-done Dunkel, balanced and traditional. It's also easy on the palate and very refeshing."
"Notes: An easy drinking amber lager, clean with full grain flavours is just what I was looking for in this beer. Typical in a way but good none the less."
