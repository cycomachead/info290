"Deliciously malty, though it doesn't seem to venture much beyond that quality. Still really loving this."

"This beer was a pleasant surprise.  It seems somewhat sweeter than the typical Munich dunkel, but not cloying.  The rapid termination of the head and lack of lacing detract from the appearance of this beer.  The aroma, flavor, and palate are all above average with the flavor directing me to buy more.  Unfortunately, it’s not available around me."

"Pours dark amber, almost orange. Hard to see in dark restaurant. Finger width foamy head. Head retention and lacing is minimal, but we were given very small glasses. Dark, slightly roasted aroma. Can discern figs. Moderately roasted malty taste, followed by dark fruits, maybe figs. Not bad. Not my style, but it is representative of the style."

"Poured a deep, rich brownish black with a thin ring of off-white head that dissipated quickly. It looks fairly good, like a dark lager should. Scents of fruity esters, especially apple, some lager yeast and a nice, rich caramel maltiness. A very simple aroma profile, but a very pleasant one that is quite appealing. Flavor begins with malty sweet flavors, some caramel and molasses with a hint of smokiness. This moves into more smokey, malty flavors and some further caramel notes with some Noble hop floral character and a hint of toasted malt. Finish is smokey, toasted and modestly floral with Noble hop flavor notes. Aftertaste is smokey, roasted malt and Noble hops. A very nice flavor profile that actually has quite a bit going on, but with none of the flavors hurting the others. Very well executed. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a semi-drying feel. Quite easy to drink and pleasant. Overall this is a good dark lager with a nice aroma and flavor profile and a good mouthfeel that lends it self well to the flavor profile. Worth trying."

"Pours a nice dark black with a decent head. Smells decent. Taste is typical dark but very easy to drink. Goes down nice and clean. Not a lot of body or substance but a decent black beer that you can drink a lot of especially eating Japanese yakitori."
""
""
"Overall, an okay beer. Given a choice among several dark beers in a bar or restaurant, this would not be what I'd order (I'd rather get, say, a Guiness). However, if it were the only dark beer offered (which was the case in this restaurant), I'd get it again. One thing became clear, though: This doesn't pair well with sushi. (I'm not sure any beer would.)"

"Pours out a ruby-tinged deep brown with a thin head. Smells of chocolate, tobacco, caramel, honey, whole wheat bread. Tastes of dried fruits, wet pipe tobacco, burnt honey, and burnt toast. Finishes dry. Mouthfeel is light in the body with subdued carbonation. Overall, this is great, but I have a hard time paying $15 for a 6 of this."
""

"Taste clean, light but tasty dark toast, hint of prunes & wine, light zesty bitterness. It's not complex, flavour is light but it's firm with some depth, a very good drinkable dark lager, clean with nice light bitterness to back it up."

"O: An interesting find. Not a bad beer. Rather approachable. But nothing too complex or exciting either."

"I poured this really black brew into my tumbler at 40 degrees. The beer was uhhh black. I said That. The beer poured a really nice big head and I like that. The beer had a slight beer smell, oh I guess it should. Really could not come up with anything else. I liked the beer and its a good product that I believe I will will have to buy again."

"That being said, the beer had a rich mouth-feel and a silky texture which I did enjoy."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Dark, with a giant head, and plenty of lacing. Nose is roasty, with some pungency, and an unsettling soapy component. Roasted nuts, chocolate, licorice, molasses... well-balanced, as each of the components are lacking a bit. A little shallow when it's all said and done. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."

""

"Though largely void of malt underpinnings and roundness, its understated savory taste lends itself to seared fish and robust sushi dishes."
""
"Quenching, but I feel like a headache is not far away."
"Pours a hazy dark orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, biscuit, and slight char-like aromas. Taste is much the same with roasted grain flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is drinkable but it smells slightly better in my opinion."
""
"Aftertaste: This is the best part. It has a nice drying finish to it, but the flavor dwindles in a hurry. Right after I swallow it tastes good… and I want that flavor to continue. But it doesn't. I am still not getting any rice from this. Grab a Flying Fish Wild Rice Double IPA… THAT is what rice is supposed to taste like in a beer. If I were to buy an Asahi beer again, it would be the Super Dry. We are having sushi later. I hope they have Asahi Super Dry!"

"Holla, my children."
"O-OK but a little on the thin side and lacks robustness in flavor"

"O: This beer is extremely easy to drink and can be considered sessionable."

"The taste was too close towards a Pepsi Cola with alcohol for me. Wasn't impressed at all. It had almost the same texture and body feel as well."

"A decent dark lager, particularly coming from such a large brewery. It looks great, and the aroma is relatively complex. The flavour is OK but lacklustre - some vitality is missing . Nice, smooth body. Pleasant and easy-drinking; I could imagine having this again. Worth trying."

"Pours a nearly opaque very dark brown with an even, tan head. Head retention is average. Aroma is comprised of prune liquer and Belgian yeast. Flavor is quite similar to Guiness Extra Stout. Prune and coffee liquers are most prominent. Finish is smooth, but abrupt. Decent beer."

"Black in body with reddish tints when brought to the light. Beige head rests on top and slowly fades. Real nice aroma of toffee, slight gingerbread, and faint chocolate. Mild flavors that are bready, toffee, some earth, herbal/slightly woody hop presence, faint cocoa hints. Light in body with light carbonation. A subtle and enjoyable stout. Not nearly as bad as I thought this was going to be."

"This beer has been terribly miscateogrised on BA. A bottom fermented black lager is as much an English Stout as sake. Total BS."
""

"O: I enjoyed the brew and it accompanied my lunch nicely. One of the better Japanese beers I have had to date."
"Overall: I was really hoping for more with this one but the flavor was of a typical japanese beer which I am not really a fan of."
"The beer pours a dark brown to black color with a tan head. The aroma is a mix of cocoa and roasted malt. Smells a bit like a stout and nothing like I expected. The flavor is also stout-like. I get a lot of chocolate and roasted malt, mixed with some light coffee and milky lactose notes. Overall, this reminds me a lot of a milk stout. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D - Lacks something in the flavor profile. I'm usually not a fan of really bitter flavors, but even this was a little tame for me. A nice drinkable stout, but nothing fantastic."
"The maltiness was awesome, and it didn't have the Pine-Sol hoppy tinge at the end like some ""stouts"" do (I'm looking at you, Storm King)."
"Overall an alright beer."
"Good, but not the best Japanese mass market dark beer. If you have a choice, the Stout is better."
"O - a drinkable and tasty brew. Aroma is the strong point IMO."
"The flavour is light but the roasty character is present the whole way through. It is slightly sweet which is nice as well. It doesn't have too much hop bite, which makes it ""warmer"" than other lagers. I would say this is an excellent beer to use when introducing people to dark beers. It is highly drinkable while having all the nice qualities of a dark lager."
"Not that I'd buy this again, but still its a good drink."
"It pours a tempting cola brown, nearly opaque, with a thin tan head - but the latter may be an artifact of the waitress’ pour. Aroma is crisp and malty with hints of molasses and caramel. Flavor is crisp and malty, like a typical lager but with a stout-like undertone of molasses and a hint of smoke. Texture is fairly smooth and tingly, rather typical. A good one to have at a Japanese restaurant."
"Very drinkable stuff here, nothing but a simple good drinking sessionable dark brew here. Sometimes thats all you need. Good stuff."
"Picked up a bottle at EuroMarket in Queens. I wasn't sure what to expect here, but it's basically a classic, inoffensive dark lager with a hint of roasted malt. There was a smooth body with just a little more weight than a standard lager. It's sweet up front with a dry finish. Not a bad beer."
"Serving type: bottle"
"A decent beer from Asahi and a real surprise."
"I liked it a lot, particularly for being light and refreshing, while still having some solid bold flavors."
"Very good for a Dark Lager."
"D: This is a good easy drinker. This beer is best from the tap. One of my go to beers when working in Japan."
"D - Easy drinking and refreshing but unimpressive in the nose, flavor and feel; quite a stark contrast from the accolades about this beer (3.5)"
"Not a spectacular effort by any measurement, though a decent companion drink to a meal that doesn't draw away too significantly."
"Not bad, but nothing to remember, possibly a bit too sweet."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of roasted malts. Taste is also heavy of roasted malts, some mild notes of coffee, some notes of chocolate.Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"DRINKABILITY - Would not go out of my way to have another, but will have one if there are some."
"Overall - This beer is very bland to me and is not as impressive as many beers in it's class. The balance is lacking and it's a straight forward non-complex brew. It's an easy-to-drink dark lager that's a good entry point for folks who typically drink pilsners and very light lagers. I probably won't drink this beer again."
"1/2 finger off white head, dark brown body no visible carbonation, quick dissipation with minimal lacing. Very malty nose with some hops. Taste is caramel malts with a bit of molasses, minimal grassy hop presence. Fairly full mouthfeel. OK drinkability, if I wasn't in a Japanese restaurant I wouldn't have ordered this, though it did pair nicely with the Kobe skewer appetizers."
"Overall, it's a very nice beer. If you are a stout guy, you will be impressed with this kind of beer. Another Euro Dark lager is the Sapporo black. It's like a stout in terms of taste and smell, but it's heaps less heavy."
"D: This was OK, I expected a little more, I've been wanting to try this for a while, nice enough."
"A nicely rounded, and fully flavoured dark lager, and true enough to the European style. 'Light' is a but a mere dot in the distance, for all those who might mistake this lager for something, well, a lot more ordinary."
"Carbonation is much too high, and the body is very watery."
"Pours a dark brown color with a thin tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, caramel, and a slight sourness. The flavor is nuts, chocolate, and roasted malt. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, with fairly high carbonation. Overall this is pretty good for a Japanese beer."
"not a bad beer and for a big brewer from Japan I was fairly happy with what I got for my money"
"Drinkability: A ""Munich-Type"" beer according to the bottle cap. Japanese brewing know-how teamed up with a German-style recipe, it's good to see those two countries coming together for something other than world domination. Though still a lager brewed with both rice and corn, it at least offers something a bit different from Asahi."
"D: I'm not generally expecting a lot when I order one of the Japanese beers, but this one was quite good. I would definitely do so again if I see it on a menu at a Japanese restaurant."
"Wasn't sure what to expect, but poured one into my pint and tried to determine how black it was. It's filtered, but still very hard to see through that super-dark brown color. The head, which was thick and foamy but didn't last that long and wasn't lacy, didn't give away too much from its smell. I could make out only a little bit of the smell of roasted malt, and not much else. It took a sip expecting a strong flavor but was surprised to find a roasty-malty sweetness with little bitter hoppiness. The carbonation is medium, and the flavor doesn't linger too long. I took another sip, and another, and another. After 3 beers, I still feel like I could drink another 12. Did not expect such drinkability from such a dark colored beer. All in all the flavor is not something that would make me drool, but the beer was a great was to relax this evening and I would buy it again."
"This is a beer which, while not bad, didn't have any traits which left me wanting more. I doubt I'll have this one again."
"nice brew."
"Find Kirin Stout or Yo-Ho Brewery's Tokyo Black. Those are great black beers!"
"D- Easy to drink, it's a lot better than most of the Japanese beers I've had. Well worth a try."
"Enjoyable, though far from complex, definitely in line to make a good session beer."
"The taste is a letdown, but still highly quaffable, with a faint kick of toasted coffee and toffee malts amidst a dominant note of brown rice and unsweetened cereal mash. Highly carbonated, medium-thin body that cut through the wasabi spice and heaviness of the sushi. Overall, a pretty good beer all things considered. Not something I'd ever want as a stand-alone brew, but pairs well with a meal."
"Pours pretty dark brown with a thin creme head. Nose is quite malty and sweet with what's coming off as molasses. A bit too malty sweet really. Mellows out enough as time goes on to make it drinkable enough. Decent, yes. Especially coming from a major brewer."
"Has a dark black body that's not completely opaque and a nice beige top. It has a distinct aroma of a nice dark toasted malt. Tastes has hints of coffee and cocoa; nothing too sweet or too bitter. Not too thin either. Definitely one of the better asian brews."
"Pours a very dark red color body, with an average creamy head, lastingish. Very pilsnery, malty aroma. Malty nutty taste. Some roasted flavor too. Light tasting. Tasty. Sweet, almost fruity. Not bad. Shiner-black like."
"Overall one of the better dark asian beers i've had (I know Asia does not produce many) but overall a big surprise. I wasn't expecting much from this beer but its actually quite nice. I wouldn't drink it religiously like Guinness but it would be nice to drink it once in a while"
"D - Very easy to drink, best when it warms up a bit."
"I honestly was impressed with this not being a standard adjunct lager. It is malty and flavorful. Chocolate and caramel with a nice fruity medium-body and ends with a hint of bitterness."
"Notes: A pretty good beer. I liked the taste and it was a lot like the German dark lagers."
"Good effort from Asahi, especially compared to the mass-market stuff."
"this could compete with the very best from Munich if not for the slightly sour-bitter taste which lingers in the aftertaste. Ends up tasting like an unintended fusion between a Munich dark and a stout...of course this could be due to the rather long trip from Japan. A pleasant beer, overall, much preferable to other supermarket brands."
"Had a very rich dark color that lives up to its name. Cannot see through the glass and some decent head. The smell is of roasted malts and coffe. This beer tasted very chochlatey and coffeish. The mouth feel was very smooth and creamy. I found this beer to be quite drinkable. You wouldnt think the japenese know how to make a decent dark beer but i was suprised."
"overall not too impressed."
"It's black with a tan head that holds well and leaves nice lacing about the glass. The aroma is fairly closed, and it expresses a suggestion or really dark, almost burnt caramel, but nothing more. It's certainly not roasty or chocolatey. And that mostly follows into the flavor. It's dark but it's not really roasty, and it has lots of nutty and caramelish flavors as well, but only minor suggestions of chocolate. And some hops appear, in this case spicy and lightly woody and leafy. It offers that sweet malty note at first, but then it vanishes in the finish, leaving it clean and dry. Again, no roastiness or chocolate-like flavors remain. And it's quite drinkable. There's a lot of flavor there, but it's superbly balanced and it never builds on the palate. It's like each sip is its own little reward, and you could keep going back to the well all night for little dollops of refreshment."
"Went very well with the Japanese BBQ I was having, and will have the next time I eat at a Japanese place, but it's not my personal favorite style, and I doubt that I'll buy a six pack. For it's genre, it is better than most."
"Drinkablity: Tasty brew. Easily sessionable, but complex enough to satisfy."
"Impressively good considering the other, more common Asahi beer availible. I like it, and would recommend it to people interested in trying a bolder beer."
"this beer is crazy good for a commercial import lager. i will be drinking this again asap."
"Light bodied and tasty roasty malts are foremost. A bit of sweet chocolate and nuttyness...almost like a schwarzbier. A surprisingly flavorful and balanced offering from one of Japan's largest breweries. Me likey, might have to grab a sixer of this soon."
"Well after seeing this beer for years in Michael Jackson books it finally shows up in Vancouver. This is a real smooth dark lager that has a very nice malty finish. Finesse is the name of the game in this beer. There is a nutty roasty note in the midbody which I really enjoy. So much more flavourful than their Dry."
"Big Dog bark"
"Dining out in a Japanese restaurant for my daughter's birthday, this seemd like the best bet for a beverage. It was dark brown, almost black, with a thin head. Aroma was lacking. A little sweet, that's all. Improvement in the taste. Somewhat of a milk chocolated/caramel taste, not unpleasant. A bit on the thin side in the mouth, but good enough for me that I had two of them."
"D - this is quite drinkable and would be a good choice if out at a japanese restaurant and it's available. especially in america i'd avoid the kirin and asashi that are brewed domestically and the sapporo that's imported from canada. yebisu is now being imported and is a nice option when available, and i'd put this on the list of beers to order if available as well."
"d: this is a great beer for Asia but still a good beer anywhere else; i'll definitely have it at a japanese bar anyday"
"Poured Black with about an inch of short lived light beige head. Had a malty smell, and a bit of a metallic odor which dissipated as the beer warmed slightly. Taste was of a dark, sweet, roasty char flavor, but not harshly so. Had good a carbonation level with a small, nice lingering dark aftertaste. Overall the body was somewhat thin, easy to drink, and I can see this being a very drinkable and delicate dark beer to go with japanese food. I liked this much more than the only other Schwarzbier Ive had too."
"D - The roasted malt lingers but doesn't overwhelm my palate. Three or four of these in a row is possible. If it wasn't $15 a 6 pack!"
"Lacing is Grade A ... smooth down the throat but a bit to cultured ... not the most flawless blackers but a good beginner .... "" he's mental for those snausages"" ... drinkable but quite neutral... bought as a single at Specs in Clear Lake.."
"Overall Impression: Easy drinking beer. No seriously off flavors, fairly clean. A solid offering, but not terribly exciting."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Had a small tan head that dissipated into a thin collar. It was dark with deep mahogany highlights. The aroma was very weak with roasted malts. The taste was nutty and alot better than I expected after the disappointing aroma. Goes down smooth and had a bit of smoky taste to it. Similar to a schwarzbier but weaker. Overall a decent beer that I could see trying in a Japanese restaurant if nothing better around. (3.5, RB, T, O)"
"D: Overally, I would say this a fairly good, drinkable brew. Not something I would buy on a regular basis, but when I am having sushi, I think it's defenitely one of the better choices out there. It certainly beats the hell out of the lighter Japanese brews I have tried."
"A drinkable dark lager, not quite as good as those made in Europe but pretty interesting"
"Pours jet-black and, as far as I could tell, compeltely opaque. Lots of nutty malt smells, particularly on pouring, and adds a kind of burned but still fairly sweet caramel flavour to the mix. Light-bodied, but good carbonation, this makes a perfect accompaniment to lightly flavoured cheeses or sushi."
"Pours jet black with a miniscule head that quickly disappears. Smell is nutty with a mild roasted character. The taste is crisp, malty, and satisfying. Light in body, as it should be, but not thin by any means. This is an easy drinking brew. I use these when I am eating light and I want a simple session brew to accompany the food. I recommend it."
"I enjoyed this beer a lot. Good dark beer that isn't too harsh. Definitely worth it if you can get your hands on it. I had to have it ordered special. Usually it is found in restaraunts."
"Drinkability: This is a really nice alternative to the usual Japanese crap, and it's easier to find and not as expensive as ji-biru. Definitely recommended, especially as a pair with Gruyere."
"D - Very smooth, easy drinker."
"M&D: medium-plus bodied for a Schwarzbier-style lager, the rich and grainy content makes it a quite chewy and enjoyable beer. And, fortunately, the added corn and rice are not played to the detriment to the beer's texture, thus I'd say this Japanese brewery's self-appointed task of producing a Munich-style dark lager (as specified on the beer cap) is no disappointment at all."
"From what I recall, it's unfortunately not nearly as creamy as it is from the tap, and overall it's a rather watery, crisp and clean lager. Nice bitterness and roasted character give this one more dimension. Decent."
"This beer has a very lager like quality, its clean and completely lacking in esters. Id classify it as a very good Schwarzbier. I was very surprised to find this in Toronto."
"Overall - An excellent beer.... Quite porter like... Recommended !!"
"Cheers2Beers"
"This is an enjoyable beer, very mild and pleasant. If I had to pick a Japanese beer right now it would be this one."
"An easily drinkable dark. Its red-black appearance is betrayed by the light-bodied, thin, nature of the beer. Hence, the easy drinkability. I was hoping for a more comprehensive flavour with a thicker mouthfeel. Flavour is sweeter than expected and pleasing, with cider, coffee, and slight pineapple and cherry pit flavors. There is a weak roasted aftertaste that doesn't linger long. Best served only slightly chilled, as the coldness creates a false crispness and masks the underlying flavor. Overall a solid beer; good as an introductory dark lager."
"Poured into a snifter, this beer had a smallish but good head: lots of very small bubbles like a Belgian. It lasted well, laced the glass and remained. Beer was very black until held up to light, when it showed red. Aroma was overwhelmingly roasty, some caramel, coffee, sweet roasted malt. Light bodied. First taste shows bittersweet chocolate, coffee, perhaps a note of vanilla. Overwhelming roasted malt flavor. Light body. Very rich flavors, fairly complex. The finish lingers and is quite pleasing. This Japanese black beer is strangely reminiscent of a Belgian beer. I'm quite happy with it."
"There's a big, tan plateau of a head: dense with a cookie dough collapse. Thin swoops of lacing. The beer is clear, dark red-brown; almost black. Faint toffee aroma gives away the dry, tangy, toffee front. Middle is milky with just a little chocolate. Finishes with coffee and bitter chocolate. It's quite nice. A light toffee, coffee, bitter chocolate beer. Gets quite nice and milky in the middle with temperature. I like it."
"This beer has a solid taste, with a bunch of flavors coming out like coffee, caramel, vanilla, nuts, and molassas. However, it is not too sweet or over-done like other Japanese ""black"" beers. Check this one out if you get the chance--it's one of Japan's best macrobrews."
"I like this reddish beer. It's got a nice, clean coffee/vanilla taste, with an extremely pleasant finish. Sure, it's on the lighter side, but it's still loaded with flavor. Pleasant aroma of vanilla and maybe a little bit of cappucino. Definitely worth trying, not an everyday beer b/c of it's slightly inflated price, but good nonetheless."
"Pours black ruby in color with a thin tan colored head that fades into a wispy lace. Nose is sweet dark malts and fresh brewed coffee. Medium in body with a smooth mouthfeel. Lots of sweet roasted malts in the flavor along with notes of dark fruits, bitter coffee, and burnt toast. A decent brew and certainly more enjoyable than their Super Dry beer."
"Bottle stated this was a Munich-style beer. Unfortunately, it does not pass the Bavarian beer purity law. On the bottle, the ingredients in Japanese are listed as malts, hops, rice, corn and starch."
"Not really black, but a deep garnet color.  Thick tan head composed of ultra-fine bubbles, lots of irregular broken lace.  Rich dark malt aroma with hints of dark fruits.  Taste is slightly tart, lots of maltiness and a black bread flavor, finishes crisp and dry with just a hint of bitterness.  Not too complex in character, but very pleasing."
"Colour me impressed...These guys know how to make a good brew...should have rated it higher on drinkability but am unsure...Try it..........Hmmmm...seems to be a little bitter after taste sneaking thru....Nice head.....Karakuchi."
"It smells wonderful. Candy and sweet. Strangely so. Almost black with a off-white fluffy head that almost held. It's suprisingly thick for the lighter taste. Slightly sweet."
