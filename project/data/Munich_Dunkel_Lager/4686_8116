I had it in a stein. I loved the brown color and enjoyed the malty sweet aroma. Highly drinkable.

It's got the hops and cilantro thing going on, which pushes it into American Pale Ale territory, but it also has an uncanny maltiness that APAs typically do not have. It's not my type of beer but it's drinkable, and I'm glad I at least got to try it. Won't be buying it again, but I can respect it for what it is.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Oct 03, 2014"

Inside the glass it is as serene as a perfect pane of colored glass. The nose is breaddy. Dark crusty bread that is lightly toasted. There is a baked grain sweetness on this plus a sweetness from caramel. No fruity esters, no hops, wonderfully clean. Taste is tantalizing and smooth. All that malt but no heaviness. The body is thin and the lighter side of medium,. The malt is crisp. A brief hint of chocolate comes out as it warms but remains largely and delightfully unfullfilled. It envelops the palate just as it's light sweetness comes up to rescue you. The finish on this one is malty, breaddy and dry with a light touch of bitterness from subtle hops. Perfect.","utopiajane","Aug 12, 2014"

For whatever reason, of all the styles we’re currently missing on BA, this was towards the top of our list. As lovers of Münich style lagers, this one certainly does the region and the country justice. The beer remains light enough in feel, much in the same way the helles lagers do, to keep the beer from becoming overpowering or overbearing. The flavoring is robust, but packaged in such a simply and decidedly light fashion. It works very well.","TheBrewo","Jun 28, 2014"

Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, apple, pear, raisin, toast, dark bread, molasses, herbal, floral, and earthy hops. Nice and pleasant aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, pear, apple, toffee, toast, dark bread, light chocolate, cracker grain, herbal, floral, grass, and earthy hops. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, toast, toffee, dark bread, light chocolate, cracker, grass, floral, and herbal on the finish for a short bit. Very nice flavor balance and robustness of dark malty flavors; with nice light floral hop balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy, lightly sick, and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good dunkel lager. Nicely robust and balanced flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 16, 2013"

3.85,2.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Had this on tap at Kaizerhof in Yurakucho, Tokyo. Poured into a glass stein. As a German dunkel on tap, I was hoping for a bit more from this. It was a decent brown lager, but lacking a bit in appearance and smell. Perhaps from a bad pour (although I can't think so because the guys at Kaiserhof were pretty pro), but I found it just sitting in a foamless, bodiless state without much aroma of anything but a bit of roasted malts. The taste was decent enough, and I would drink it for fun, but not much to write about here. Good, but not amazing.","shigg85","Jul 01, 2012"

Similar to rye bread toasted with a dash of brown sugar. Nicely balanced, seems to almost finish on the dry side with a slight hop bite on the end.

The taste holds notes of very light roasted malts, very light caramel, minerals, and very light cashews. Somehow, all of these relatively mild flavors combine to something mostly tasty.

The smell was toasty and a little bisuity, only malt really came through in the nose. The taste was sweet maltiness, a little roasted too. The body was substantial enough for the style, which means a little thicker than water. Very drinkable, a top-notch dunkel lager.","TurdFurgison","Nov 05, 2008"

The finish barely manages to become dry and the body is medium. I took a bite of a mildly spiced delicate pork sausage with mustard, some onions, peppers, and cabbage, and pumpernickel bread, then took another swallow of the beer and it suddenly came alive.

On the palate, the malts continue to come through with their slight toastiness, quite sweet indeed. Only a moderate caramel like amount of toasted flavor pervades, with a strong nuttiness in the background. Barely to no hop bitterness comes through in the finish.

The hops come through in the finish. The caramel taste is a bit more pronounced as the beer warms a bit. This is a fairly tasty beer, a little dry in parts, not the best Dunkel by a long shot, in part because it is a little thin and watery, and the metal in the finish is a bit much.

It wasn't too cold where I had to let it warm up or it wasn't too warm in where the beer burned my upper lip. Just the right temp. The beer was a dark mahogany with cherry red highlights all through out the beer. The head of foam on my glass was about a 1 finger and it was a dirty white color. Not a pure white color and it wasn't tan colored either. The smell was that of dark roasted malts, hint of chocolate, sweet caramel, and a trace of bitter hops at the end. Dark roasted malts came sweeping in the beginning and then gave way to sweet caramel and a hint of bitter hops at the end. Basically it tasted like it smelled, except for the fact that I really couldn't taste any chocolate. It was medium bodied and with a smooth aftertaste of roasted malts with no alcohol in sight. I could see why people at Oktoberfest might drink liters of this kind of beer. That's because there is plenty of good flavor and is easy to drink.

It is a little bit raw in the aftertaste, and there is some heat from the prickly alcohol presence. The body is medium and lightly tingly, and leaves a medium finish.

Exactly what I would expect from this beer. The flavor is not over the top at any point, exceptional balance between the roasted malt flavor and small amount of hops. This beer is not trying to grab your attention; it's a classic case of less is more. This is one beer everyone should have on tap to understand the style and intention of the beer.

Thats not the case here; you will actually be wowed at the fact of how a simple beer can be so great. Mouthfeel is smooth and watery, refreshing and light.
