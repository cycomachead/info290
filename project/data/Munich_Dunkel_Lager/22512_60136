3.58,-8.4,4,4,3.25,3.75,3.5,"Served in a willibecker.  Pours the color of eggplant with a loose, off-white head.  Nose is malty and slightly vinous with a hint of clean yeast.  Taste consistent with nose; however, it all comes off a bit dull.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with an even carbonation, perhaps a bit assertive, with a kiss of acidity co-mingled.  Overall, decent and drinkable but a bit lacking in terms of the fruity character I've come to associate with the style.","Jwale73","Oct 26, 2014"

In the taste, bready malts, brown sugar and a dab of honey, mild roast, notes of yeast and distant earthy hops. Body was on the lighter side of medium, mouthfeel seemed a bit thin for the style, but it was an easy drinker overall.","Rifugium","Jan 31, 2014"

Aroma of chocolate malt notes is very nice with light dry notes also noticeable. Taste is also dominated by chocolate malt notes with light dry roasted malt notes and light caramel. Body is somewhat thing with average carbonation. Nice level of complexity with great drinkability factor.","Phyl21ca","Jul 04, 2013"

4.15,6.1,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Off tap at the brewery this beer was a root-beer brown color with one finger of off-white head. The retention was average and the lacing good. The aroma was light but on-point. I smelled a mix of chocolate malt, caramel malt, some residual sugars, nuts and dark malt. The flavors were just the same only better defined. Very nutty and robust with lots of caramel, some coffee and a touch of wood. Roasted malt lingered on the finish. Rich but not heavy, the alcohol was well-hidden and generally quite yum! The mouthfeel was good, the body medium and the carbonation a little prickly.","thekevlarkid","0"
