It has a nice creamy head and goes well with the bread, meat, fish and cheese they served with it. I was impressed with this beer as it did not seem to have the bitterness of most dark beers that pour almost black. A nice balance of malt to hops.

Don’t let the look of these little beers fool you and the fact I usually see it in gas and train stations. It is actually really decent beer. The dunkel was very weak in most characteristic to this style. The flavor and the aroma were very mild in the roasted qualities that I think a dunkel should have. There was some roastiness but just very faint. The feel was a little thin but not bad and it was definitely easy to drink. There was a great malt flavor however even though not roasted and a mild hop flavor.","MTNboy","May 19, 2012"

The taste is equally impressive with rich caramel and vienna malt characteristics. A nice hop finish cleans up the flavors and dries out nicely. Very slight toffee sweetness comes through in the aftertaste. The sharp carbonation thins out the body and makes this insanely drinkable. The mouth is left slightly gritty and metalic, but in the best way. A biscuit with caramel and hops in liquid form.

Semi-sweet maltyness combines with some earthy bittering hops to form a simple, easy drinking brew. Smooth, light bodied and refreshing. This beer is far from bad, but falls short of a really good dunkel. A nice value at under $2 a bottle, I will probably give this one a go again.","twiggamortis420","Sep 26, 2008"

4.47,22.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: Super drinkable. My new session beer. The Warsteiner lacked some flavor, and Beck's Dark, in my opinion, chose the wrong combination of hops. Bass is good, but is so malt oriented it will get boring after a while. This is wonderful. A little out of the way from the mainstream, but worth every penny.","JArami","Jan 11, 2008"

Medium body and a nice medium carbonation. Taste opens with malty toffee and toasted grain. Hops quickly answer with a nice balance of spicy and earthy noble bitterness. Very solid for style though the color was lighter than expected.","merlin48","Oct 29, 2007"

The aroma is strong sweet malt, giving it a caramel/nutty smell. The taste is just as good. Sweet malts creating a delicious light nutty flavor. Medium mouthfeel and smooth finish. Low abv. and exceptional full flavor make for a very drinkable brew. Overall, I was very impressed. This is the best dunkel lager I have had to date. Highly recommended!","beeragent","Jul 15, 2007"

The flavor is, luckily, more complex. Grainy toasted malts and hops are predominant, with touches of banana bread on hard mineral water. Finishes with a balanced sweetness and dryness, leaving toasted bread and hop notes. Medium thick (nearly syrupy) in the mouth, with almost still body and spare carbonation. Not particularly outstanding, but a nice beer with lunch.","dgallina","Apr 29, 2007"
3.4,-7.1,3,3,3.5,3,4,"33cl swing-top bottle with a LOT of pop. Minimal head, though, which is surprising. Amber color & rather still looking. The smell is caramel primarily but very muted overall. The taste is roasted, a bit acidic but with a nice malt finish. Hops are nowhere to be seen. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated but a bit watery. Drinkability is good, as the crisp finish is refreshing. It's a decent beer but nothing too spectacular. I'd drink it again, I reckon. If I were the reckoning type.

The taste was really good. This is the first of the style that I've had and I was impressed. Will have to try move Dunkle Lagers and see if it holds. The only thing I didn't like about this beer was that the mouthfeel was pretty watery. Not enough to ruin it but enough to remind you on every drink. Overall, good beer and recommend.

Sticky rum like brown sugar. Hard to tell its a weisse at all. Quite flat as far as carbonation goes. Flavour hugely dependent on malt which carries itself a little weak. Little resonance, no mouthfeel. Void of any character. No aftertaste - but no before taste either. Some smokey wood character. Kept me guessing as to what it is exactly. Somethig good is in there, but darn hard to find.","biegaman","Sep 30, 2006"

I would suspect that this is more of what a historical Dunkel would be like since the attenuation of yeast has gone up over the ages. Perhaps this is more like an original Einbecker.

4.78,30.6,5,4.5,5,4,5,"Pours out a crystaline nut brown with amber edges and an eggshell head. The head is very thick but not lasting; it quickly fades to a film over the brew. Smell is strong with bits of cappuchino, caramel, oat, and wheat. Blend it together in one bottle and you've got a concoction that you can detect from a good ten inches away from a freshly poured glass. Starts extra smooth and refreshingly crisp with a creme taste. Settles gently sour with lots of hop bitters. There is a sugary undertone to the full-bodied drink. Finishes sour and bitter, dry and strong.
