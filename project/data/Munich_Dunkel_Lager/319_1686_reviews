"Pours a light tan, one finger-head that goes slowly leaving a good lace. Deep amber color. Light carbonation. Medium bodied. Nose is malty. Starts sweet, has a plum flavor finishes smooth and mellow. Nice dark beer. $1.75 for a green 12oz bottle from Liquor Barn Lexington, KY."

"Ultimately for me, it can't be a repeat purchase as it was a little watery, and the bitterness combined with the lager yeast flavor profile just didn't have enough malt to carry it to a happy place."

"There are nice caramel malt notes in the taste as well. Grain and hints of chocolate follow with an ever so slight bitterness. Nice sweetish finish. All around, a very good Dark Lager."

"O- A case of a beer being better than the sum of it's parts. I would drink these over the course of the night. Tasty and simple."
"Overall a very fine dark beer to be searched for again."
"O - Overall this is a decent session beer, but more of a dark American lager than a Munich Dunkel. It lacks some richness and malt complexity of the Munich style, while seems to fit perfectly within the Dark American."
"Overall a tasty dunkel. Would have again for sure."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, slick and bordering on watery, with light carbonation, a light body and an overall lightness that’s just a tad bit too bitter to consider crisp. This is a gem for any malty beer fans out there, and even though it went down easy it would not be a session beer for me. A good beer overall, and true to its style, just not the type of beer I would have all night."
"D: The beer goes down very easily and its low alcohol content makes it quite sessionable. I could drink these all night long."
"A decent dark Euro lager, well balanced and an easy way to sip away the remainder of Christmas Day 2010..."
"I found this Dunkel drier and more refreshing than many others. Highly drinkable."
"D- i could stay on this one all night. flavours are pleasant but not overpowering, and the dry finish makes you want to take another sip. pretty damn good."
"D: A little bit of everything that you could expect from a Munich Dunkel Lager."
"Definitely a winner in my book, I'll continue to look for it."
"A smooth, easy to drink example of the style. I enjoyed it."
"D: A sessionable brew by all means. It's good, and is very easy to drink."
"For a beer that appears to be almost 6 months old, it holds up pretty well. It's gut."
"Overall it is a fail for the style in the taste department."
"It pours out a dark brown with a surprising amount of head for a dark beer. As the beer settles, there is little to no lacing. The smell is a hint of barley with a roasted malt, not a strong smell. The taste is moslty roasted malt, with not much added complexity, perhaps a bit of barley. This beer seems like it has a lot of potential at first sip, but the lack of complexity and flavor, are a bit disappointing. The mouthfeel is very watery for a dark beer. surprisingly not substantial and thin feeling in my mouth. While this beer is not that thick and isn't exactly an assualt on the palate, I still couldn't see myself drinking many, as it is super filling and sits heavily with you."
"Fairly average all the way around. Poured a nice, deep, dark brown like furniture stain. Dark, sweet malts dominate the smell with little else in there. Flavour is sweet malts with some earthy, European style hop bittnerss toward the end. Very easy drinking beer. A nice example of a style I enjoy."
"Gosser has plenty of drinkability. It has a creamy mouth feel that still manages to be light. There is a finish, however, it is not long, rather, it lingers. More than one of this beer can be consumed in one sitting (with pleasure). It would be an excellent fall beer, but, can be enjoyed at any time."
"This is a decent smooth malty beer, definitely drinkable."
"Drinkability: Well, it's no Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel, that much is certain. I've never been sure (or interested enough to find out) how to pronounce Gösser, but it always makes me think of Gozer the Gozerian from the movie Ghosterbusters. The beer is somewhat metallic which always gets an instant red card from me, so I cannot recommend it in good faith. However, I will instead cheerfully recommend Ghostbusters!"
"Overall impression: A nice, sessionable, dark lager. A recommended for those seeking this style or if you get one in a mixed pack of imports."
"Pours a clear, dark amber color with lighter amber along the bottom and edges of the glass. One and one half inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of roasted malt, yeast, pale malt, and hops. Fits the style of a Munich Dunkel Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a low carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, pale malt, hops, yeast, and a general sweetness in the finish (fruit?). Overall, a really good beer - by far the best Munich Dunkel I've ever had. Really smooth, good body, great blend, and easy drinkability! I highly recommend this brew."
"Note: Drank on-tap at the Yardhouse in San Diego, CA."
"D- Gosser Dark is a very tasty beer that is very drinkable."
"From a Beers of the World pack. Pours dark brown with a modest head and good amount of lacings. Aroma is caramel malts. Taste is sweet dark malts and just enough hops for the style. A slight taste of chocolate to go with the caramel. Light bodied, and quite sessionable. Would be a very good dessert beer without being very filling."
"Pours a rich brown color topped by a half-finger of creamy tan head. Sweet aroma of roasted malt, with notes of mocha and maybe some hazelnut. Palate is mainly smooth, sweet roasted malt, with a touch of fruitiness added by the hops. Body is nice and velvety smooth. Surprisingly tasty. I should check out more examples of this style."
"When I bought this beer, I really didn't think that I was going to like it. Little did I know that it is a solid brew. The beer opens up with a dark, but clear brown with ruby highlights and an unexpectly dense foam stand that showed great staying power during the session. Aromas of faint toasted barley, underlying sweetness, and an earthy / peat-et hints soon followed. Flavors of light confectionate sugar emerged first, but eventually balanced by a pronounced, yet soft, toasted / roasted flavor that gains intensity into the finish. Peat moss and earthy hops continued to add complexity and richness as well. The beer remained softly textured and very smooth throughout with no astingency or grainy flavors. Finihses with a fleeting sweetness, leaving only a hint of toast and hop bitterness left on the toung. Though not outstanding, the brew is solid."
"Pours a dark but clear amber brown color with light tan creamy head that takes a while to fade. Smells of roasted malt, a little chocolatey. You can taste the roast malt with some coffee and chocolate in there. A tiny bit of hop flavor on the back end. Mouthfeel is heavy and a little creamy, with a little fizz at the end. It actually finishes fairly dry. All in all, a very drinkable beer. I'll be getting this again."
"This is one awesome beer."
"Pours the color of color and just as clear, with a thin head that leaves lacing on my glass. Aromas are of roasted malts, typical of a Munich dunkel lager, but not as rich as some Bavarian examples. On the tongue, this first thing to come out is some light sweetness tinged with sourness, followed by drier roasted malt notes, with that light sourness coming back on the finish. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side, with brisk carbonation that hits especially had on the mid-palate. Overall, this is a good dunkel lager. Not the best, not terribly complex, but decent and drinkable."
"Delightful brew, one of the best from Oesterreich."
"Quaffable. A bit sweetish, but still balanced. Satiating without ever becoming cloying. Wel done!"
"Beautiful color, like dark stained mahogany with ruby. Not much head to speak of, but a bit of lacing. Smell: smoke, malt, a bit of pumpkin or sweet potato? Not very heavy taste. Kind of dull, which I find often typical of the style. Lazy malt, no hops except for a slight bittering, some sweatsock flavor, not much character really. Disappointing mouthfeel too - sharp, small bubble that quickly foams in your mouth, robbing you of the beer's flavor. Drinkability is ok if you enjoy the taste, which is tolerable."
"This beer poured a crystal clear dark amber that looked a bit like maple syrup. The head poured about a half cm. of light tan. Smelled of smoky molasses and caramel with a sweet peach and apple fruitiness beneath. Tasted of very dark fruits with a plumb crispness followed by a raisin and prune sweetness. Finished dry with a sweet and sour crispness. Mouth feel was medium bodied with a light and tingly carbonation."
"Drinkability/Overall: Easy to drink and a great dark beer. Very nice!"
"Overall, I found this to be a very pleasant lager. Very drinkable. Certainly worth a try."
"This is a simple, clean, no-nonsense hearty dark lager. I found it to be a just tad roasty-toasty, with a malty-rich mouth-filling fullness that was quite enjoyable. It comes off like a good bock with that kind of grain profile, but just a little drier and toastier. I have not seen it in very many places, either stores or restaurants, shich is a bit of a shame. Also, it can be a little on the pricey side. It's worth a try anyway...I'd like to try it in Austria."
"Overall: I easily preferred the Gösser Dark from the standard offering which I tried earlier. A drinkable dark brew that is not too heavy on the palate. Cost $1.69 and goes down nicely. I wouldnt turn one of these away again. Nice enough."
"Amber, significant carbonation at Ludwig's in Philly. Dry with a touch of lime sourness.Burnt roast malts, some chocolate but also syrupy sweetness, medium mouthfeel from nuts, cigar tabacco, not smooth mix. Didn't work, maybe at some else's pub, or maybe fresh at the brewery.."
"Its not a brute on the flavors, but whats there is a subtle chocolate breadyness mildly peaking interest to keep going towards fillin' another glass. Perhaps I'm being a bit more gracious with my numbers here, but I do like what I'm getting out of this, so up they go. Fine, fine stuff."
"Seems like being an obscure green-bottled Austrian beer will automatically knock a good half point off a BA rating. Filtered espresso describes the sight and odor senses in the company of a pinch of chocolate shavings and raisins. A silky wash across the buds transports an herbed and fruitwood plank roasted grass clipping smoothie as drunk from old tin. I could drink a few."
"I actually enjoyed this beer. A good, malty dunkel altogether. Not really complex but would make for a good beer with a steak and potato. I could imagine myself drinking this while playing pool for some reason. This is worth a try if you see it."
"Pours a medium brown with a decent size rather creamy had that leaves a light amount of lace,aromas of roasted malt and a little brown suger-like sweetness.A well rounded flavor of light sweetness and some bread dough with a light touch of pepper in the finish.A pretty easy drinker not as sweet as some others of the style.I had this beer awhile back and thought for sure I had reviewed it but did not,this brew is alot better than their pale lager."
"Light bodied and sparkling in the mouth similar to a pils. Though, at times, this seems a bit washed-out and dilute, flavor-wise. This isn't particularly memorable, but it is quaffable en masse."
"I had this on tap in two different bars in the western Ural city of Perm, in the heart of Russia. It came out a deep clear ruby red under a two finger beig head wiht nice retention and excellent lace. The nose was pleasantly strong, full of malt and caramel. The mouth was prickly and medium-bodied, with caramel sweetness. The taste is mild and mainly caramel, wiht a touch of hops in the finish. The aftertaste is sweet. This was a good dunkel, utterly quaffable."
"Enjoyable stuff for a cheaper import. Good clean sweet malt flavours."
"Light medium brown color, slightly hazy, medium head. Light bodied dunkel weizen beer. Light malts and hops. Fruity, some banana and clove flavor. Light and refreshing. Lots of flavor. Mild taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is malty sweet with a touch of hop spiciness. Very drinkable."
"I found this highly drinkable, refreshing and complex. Not too sweet, yet dark malt rich with strong malt qualities that aren't understated or overbearing."
"This beer pours a dark amber color that is slightly transparent with a medium white head and no lacing on the glass. There really isn't any aroma that I can find. The flavor is sweet and has a slightly carmel-like taste. Very good and pretty smooth. Slightly dry aftertaste. Good beer for drinking several of but it doesn't have a ton of special character."
"Its a dark lager. A nice light brown head that lasts the whole way. Theres some good amount of lacing here too. As for the taste its got a nice semi-chocolate taste, also some roasted malts in there. Pretty decent tasting, if you see it, might as well give it a shot."
"Pours a deep brown color topped by a nice head that sticks around for a while even after a couple of sips, also leaves lace on the glass as you drink it. The aroma is dominated by caramel. The taste consists of caramell, not that strong though and chocolate hints. Quite impressive Austrian brew"
"Dark burgundy brown, rich, creamy, aromatic, tan head. Sweet notes of chocolate, raisins, plums, slightly roasty, toasty, nutty. Sharply metallic on the palate at first, with sweetness coming up from behind, like the caramel coating on a candy bar. Short, but sweet finish. Medium body. Just enough to grant some substance. One of the best lagers I've had lately."
"Clearish brown with chill haze.  Head settles out to 1/4 of an inch, finer bubbles with bigger ones in the middle.  A little burnt toast to the smell.  Light body, flavor is ""front-loaded"" and in the hazelnut range in taste.  Finishes light with a honey impression.  Certainly not a lot of hops going on.  Flavor is nice but this beer is a little sweet and fleeting in impression for me."
"Its OK and drinkable, but whenever i've had it, it tends to be a bit syruppy or something, and seems to have a marmalade sort of flavour, nice otherwise."
