Poured into a hefty glass mug. No head until I got nuts with the pour it vanished quickly but left a fancy ring around the mug. The color is very appetizing like a very dark tea. Smell is malt dominated with a heavy bread smell, very sweet. Taste is bready malt sweet burnt sugar and a pleasant very mild bitterness that's only mildly noticeable on the exhale. Well carbonated and thin in the mouth but yet feels like a heavier beer. Very meal like. Overall a good experience and I am looking forward to some more lagers of this sort.

Nose of light honey sweetness, nuts, woodiness and some fruit esters. Taste is similar, earthy and spicy hops here, something that I guess I perceive as a general 'woodiness.' Toffee malt as well. Good smooth mouthfeel, medium low carbonation. Nice drink.","liamt07","Jan 04, 2011"
3.93,7.4,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours a dark amber colour with a head that's actually a bit too thick at first, and then rather sneakily diminishes down to nothing. The lace, however, is quite mesmerizing. It slowly creeps down the glass, changing shape. A bit silly, but it's quite fascinating to watch. Bit of an earthy smell. Plenty of grains, and a touch of honey and molasses. Bit biscuity as well. Taste is essentially similar to smell, with some caramel and grassiness in the end. For some reason, this reminds me a little bit of honey oatmeal. I wonder, did they add oats to this beer? It does have a similar smoothness I come to expect from oatmeal stouts. Very creamy, smooth and light bodied. I like Dunkel lagers, and believe they make a great session beer. They may not have strong, bold flavours, but they have good flavours. I would drink this again. I would even seek this out again. Another beer from this brewery that did not disappoint.","slitherySOB","Jan 01, 2011"

3.08,-15.8,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Got this at the local Brat maker. I've had it on other occasions, but threw the bottle away without even seeing who made the stuff. Had a darkish amber color with a finger (at most) of head after a pretty weak pour. I did get the hint of grape, but it was merely a hint. Mostly just a bready, honey sweetness.

3.68,0.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"It pours a dark brown with only a mildly fizzy head of cola-like foam. Very nice color, with blends of dark brown and deep reds; I didn't expect this, as I hadn't yet determined the style of this beer. (I assumed this may be traditional Bavarian lager, simply because the label was so lightly colored.) Aromas of dark malts and sweet brown sugar, light air of dark ripe fruit, and bread dominate the nose. The flavor is certainly not too big; it's mainly of dark sweet flavors reminiscent of rich bread, turbinado sugar, and mild fruits. Overall, I'd describe the flavor and mouthfeel as lean, but that's true of most lagers. Very drinkable, but with enough complexity to make it interesting.","CWiggins","Mar 14, 2009"
3.78,3.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Pleasingly whipped up froth of a head, thin yet aggressively popping bubbles all over. A moderately deep brown sits in the middle of the glass, further out yellow wins out over any orange hues. Presents a sweet and soft profile in the nose without any truly overt malt notes, you get pumpernickel bread, rye, dried molasses, green apple to pear to red cherry fruit, brazil and hazelnuts, overall it's stripped down to an indistinguishable, if still correct, core. In the mouth it's Medium-bodied with a good degree of fluidity that knows when to slow down given its lack of flash. The carbonation is crisp and feels more like a higher quantity of smaller pinpricks than foam. Caramel, brown sugar, molasses flavors appear sans true sweetness. The same pumpernickel to rye bread profile exists here, more bready and doughy than grainy. The mineral water element evokes a splash of lemon peel. It seems intent on pleasing in the most self-effacing manner possible, a beer to be consumed heartily by local men with big hands and messy plates of food.

Poured a deep dark brown with a huge billowing white head that settled down to reveal some subtle lacing that was quite nice. Smell was of caramel, grains, and breads, yeast primarily. Taste was typical brown lager. Some subtle spiceness, great all around flavor. Lots of earthy tones, with a ever so slight sweetness. Mostly malts on this one. This was a decent beer, extremely sessionable and a samn fine call. A corked bottle to makes it a nice treat!","mikesgroove","Feb 23, 2007"

3.88,6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"500 mL swingtop, served in a pilsner glass. It pours a dark copper/mahogany with medium carbonation and a two-finger, almost creamy head that leaves nice lacing. The aroma is spicy/grassy, a little sweet, with caramel and perhaps some dark fruits. There are toasted/caramel malts on the palate, with green/spicy Noble hops that contribute grass/fresh hay and a bitterness that starts mild but increases slightly as I drink. The body is medium to full, with medium carbonation, and it leaves a light to medium finish. Overall a more-than-adequate dunkel that is fairly refreshing and definitely sessionable.","mmmbeer","Jan 23, 2007"

3.5,-4.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer starts with a dark, red, transparent, pour into my glass. It contains golden highlights. It has a very small head which dissipates quickly leaving very little lacing. There is sweet, very unhoppy nose to this beer. I can gather some molasses, caramel and something that smells like brown sugar. There is nothing floral about it at all. The taste and mouthfeel was somewhat lackluster. It had a medium body with the taste of molasses really sitting on the tip of my tongue. Very little carbonation as was expected. It goes down very smooth because of this. A slight bitterness sneaks out during the swallow along with a metallic lager taste which doesn't effect the flavor, but is noticable. All in all i think this beer is pretty good, but not great. It is my first dunkel lager and i went into tasting this purely on my taste and not comparing it to the style. If you like octoberfest beers that are sweeter you will like this beer.","mattpetti","Feb 28, 2006"

If you have any interest in this style whatsover, I recommend at least one bottle since you'll be amazed at how far the brewers can back off and stay true to the style.

Nice labels and bottles, though.","BuckeyeNation","Feb 04, 2006"

Taste is dry oak flavors and brown malts with a yeasty finish. Slightly sweet caramels scattered throughout, but nothing exciting. Feel is medium body with not much carbonation at room temp besides a little tingle on the tongue on the initial sip. Maybe a drying alcohol on the finish as well.

Poured into an imperial pint glass, a 1/2 inch but short-lived head formed, and quickly the caramel covered liquid was left with nothing but a slight layer of bubbles for a cap. Excellent malt nose, and the malt flavors dominate the taste as well. I'm leaning towards caramel as the strongest flavor, but another of the mid-range malts could be in charge. I keep wanting to think this could be darker or heartier in the mouthfeel, but then I look at the ""dark lager"" category and guess that we're doing admirably.","ppoitras","Mar 16, 2004"

A light flavor of pineapple lingers in the distance. This is an easy drinking brew.","BeerResearcher","Nov 17, 2003"

The nose is very mild, with just a hint of caramel. As the brew warmed, the caramel notes came out a bit stronger. The mouth is very prickly and medium-bodied. The taste is a bit harsh, not quite sour and definitely not sweet. It's not malty smooth, either, but there's some malt here. A touch of caramel comes out in the finish, and there's a bit of hops in the aftertaste. The main taste is, well, a bit more substantial than water, but somehow tough to define. The warmer it got, the better it got, however, with more caramel to enjoy. Still, not a great beer.","Globetrotter","Nov 11, 2003"

The body is light and crisp in the mouth with a very fine carbonation. The flavor delivers a combination of almost juicy, toasted malt and spicy hops. It's not really complicated, but it is most compelling! It finishes with a short, lingering note of sweetish malt and spice. Well-balanced, refreshing, and highly drinkable with enough character to keep it interesting throughout several servings. Certainly worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Jun 16, 2003"

Hardly any odor, dirty copper/amber color unlike I've seen, good juicy head. Basically a tasty clean lager with sweet roasty hints, malty & hearty, with pleasant cleansing taste. Mellow hops balance the malts to make a toffeeish, buttery brew with a chewy mouthfeel and a very good finish. There's actually not much to this beer; it's a bit empty-tasting especially for the price. However, it's nice enough and very drinkable.
