"Clear amber color with a thick head of creamy froth.  Aromas of grain, caramel, grapes, bready sweetness, crackers, and dough.  Nutty grain flavor, brown bread, dough, fruit, and grassy hops.  Easy-drinking medium-light body.  I would love to see all the OMB beers east of Greensboro."

"Clean, biscuity malts typical of OMB. Just not a favorite style of mine."

"I've had a few of Olde Meck's offerings and I'll be damned if they're not one of the best, most authentic brewers of German style lagers in the States. Their dunker is malty and clean with just enough bitterness to create a balance that's infinitely quaffable. Thanks again, Wil, a new favorite!"

"The first one we've struggled to get 250 characters on."

"Overall: Not many craft brewers try the German styles and the dunkel, in particular; this is a pretty good example of the style"

"A really good dunkel, great flavor and highly sessionable."

"O: A drinkable and refreshingly clean beer. I wish the flavor had the complexity of the aroma, but it's still tasty, smells nice, and is quite enjoyable."

"Overall, this isn't a flashy beer, but is a well-made and tasty dark lager. Old Mecklenburg does a great job on German styles and this is no exception."
"Poured into a 1/2 liter stein a deep chesnut brown with garnet hue,a reat looking fluffy tan coloread atop.Some bready notes,iron/metallic and light chocolate linger in the nose,lighter but true to form.A little sharp in the mouth with dryer lightly toasted bread flavors along with some light nuttiness and mild caramel-like sweetness.It's a more subtle dunkel and it's good for easy drinking and pairing with food like Iam doing tonight."

"Smell is of typical dunkel malts; slightly sweet. Taste is very similar. Ssweet malt and a slight chocolate note. Really smooth and full of flavor. This is a very nice dunkel. Not quite exceptional caliber but still very good."
"O: Nice representation of the syle. Easy drinking brew with loads character."
"Cost: $5.99 for a 14 oz pint or $7.49 for a 20 oz pour in a weizen glass (airport prices). If you buy the 20 oz pour at the Carolina Beer Company bar in Terminal D, you get the option of purchasing a shot of any liquor for $3."

"O -- I have yet to find a good Dunkel brewed in the US, let alone one that holds up well in the bottle with export."" It seems that US brewers just love that roasty character, but a good Dunkel can be so delicious when you let Munich and Pils malt do their thing. That said, this beer is certainly well-made and delicious -- just expect more of a Schwarzbier in character."

"Just simple, straight-forward drinking. Give me meat and bread."
"Enjoyed on tap at the brewery. Single finger frothy head, slightly off white with good retention. Clear and amber. Aroma is strong and mostly consists if sweet caramel malts. More caramel malt in the taste with a spicy and slightly bitter hip finish. Medium body and moderate to high carbonation. Overall I think this is the first of these I have reviewed so new to the genre. Overall I really liked this beer"
"The flavor leans towards both the hops and the sweetness. This brewery seems to like a decent amount of sweetness. It is pretty tried and true though, a solid dunkel."
"O: The drinkability on this beer is through the roof! Its very clean, smooth, tasty and enjoyable. What else could you ask for?! Hopefully I’ll be able pick up more of this before they’re on to the next seasonal. Great brew, OMB!"

"Daydreaming of beer halls in Munich, and this beer appears in front of us. Chestnut darkness lures us in; tight head on top is not big enough to give us beer mustaches ... we move on. Massive onslaught of a pleasing breadiness in the nose, with hints of herbal hop. Firm, malty palate; semidry. Dark bread, faint sweet edge up front, quite toasty middle to end. Hops for balance, and a great balance there is with undertones of wild herbs and mint. This lager brings us further into that daydream of us drinking liters of Dunkel, which makes us crave fresh Bavarian brezel. Amazing."
"Lighter bodied, drinkability is a no brainer. Only problem for me was the chocolate became a little odd with not much backing it up."
"One of the best dark beers available right now !"
"The bitterness in this reminded me a winter warmer. It poured a little darker than OMB Copper. It smells warm and sweet. The taste is similar, but more bitter. I like OMB beer because it is always filtered to be crystal clear and drinkable. I enjoyed alternating between this and copper."
"First beer I have had from OMB, which is weird considering I live about 15 minutes from the brewery. I am impressed so far and will start trying to find a little bit more from this local brewer."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer Charlotte served in a standard pint glass a crisp dark copper with a decent khaki head that diminishes to a ring and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is mild dark malts, not much else. The taste is a nice amount of smooth dark malts with a nice caramel finish. The beer is quite light, crisp and refreshing. This is a very enjoyable lager for a winter afternoon."
"Pours a deep copper color with a thick whitish head and a good amount of residual lacing. Smells of roasted malts, a little pecan, and maybe toffee. Tastes of roasted malts, pecan, walnut, caramel, and again maybe toffee. Mouthfeel is nice with just the right amount of carbonation. Fairly easy to drink."
"This is a good work-in-progress Dunkel, I feel like. Could use a little more character as it seems to have not yet hit its stride, a la the Alt. I look forward to trying it again."
"Wow, just another well crafted German style here and these guys are definitely impressing me more and more with each offering that I have from here. This is a great seasonal that I would be drinking a ton of if it was local to me."
"D: Extremely drinkable brew. Hope to see this around in Charlotte for some time."
"drinkability: good"
