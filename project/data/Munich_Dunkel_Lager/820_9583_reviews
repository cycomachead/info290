"Smell like sour pickles, roasted beef or rotten potatoes. Head caramel color and short lasting. Sweetness and metallic taste prevail,with hint of orange and wood. too sweet, yet strong, hard, and not refreshing, i didn't like it, maybe worst German beer i tried so far. Disappointing."

"O - Very aromatic,but not the best taste."
""

"It's not rich or creamy body wise but it carried the flavours nicely and is well worth trying if you get the chance."

"Dark nut-brown body beneath a vanilla-white head. Clear. Very good head retention and lacing. Burnt, roasty, and nutty in the nose with a hint of fruit and coffee beans. Roasty and toasty in the mouth with a small amount of dark chocolate, more nuts than the nose suggests, and a bit of fruit (mainly raisin). Medium bodied. Smooth, gently crisp carbonation."

"The taste is malty with the specialty malts like munich giving the beer a deep taste. The maltiness is not as deep as I expected. The beer is sweet but not cloying, mouthfeel lacks a bit in depth. Bitterness is low."

"A very pleasant dunkel lager. This is a classic and worthy drink in the Munich tradition."

"One of Munich's best beers which is saying much. This beer is for the true daily beer lovers. I wouldn't say it's as smooth as many a Belgium beers but the Dunkel version is something to look forward to. A great tasting full body beer and can be drank in large amounts as I can attest to. I was a recipient of generosity by the Augustiner brew master for we bought direct a 50L keg and brought it back to the states. To say the American beer drinkers were in ahhh of this brew is an understatement."

"D - Delicious beer. Worth having next time I'm in Munich."
"Aroma is deep and dark from the start. Rich dark caramel notes are all over this one. Roasted nuts, some brown sugar, dark frits, figs maybe? Really just complex as I even pull a touch of vanilla through after a few minutes. Really nice, and quite full feel for the style, due in most part to near perfect carbonation. This allows the flavor to roll across the palate and really just cling to every ounce of taste buds you have. Caramel, bready notes, hints of light spice are all leading the charge here as each sip seems to become better and better"
"Tasted this one in Munchen, Bavaria on a perfect sunny summer day at the Augustiner brau hall. nice head retention over a clear mahogany/burnt amber body. the aroma is of a bready nature, though i could justify it being nutty as well. the flavor is bready too, but not rich enough to be nuttyclean, spritzy (once when i was a beer rookie i described a dunkel with the word ""velvety"") this beer is not velvety, nor should it be. the bitterness is minimal but hop flavor is good sweet and toatly german."

"Nothing that is worth high praises, but sure a fine beer"
"Not a huge amount of experience, so tough to say if this is insubstantial or just to style. Drinks quick either way, but I've had better and worse."
"This is a nice drinkable dunkel, however the heavy malty body prevents this one from being a true session beer."
"D- Good Beer that goes great with a meaty meal"
"0.5l bottle. Pours a clear mahogany color with a decent, creamy off-white head, fair lacing. Aroma is nutty, caramel, bread, and a hint of wood. Flavor is sweet malts, caramel, a hint of roasted malts, some dark fruits, and a hint of earthy hops. Mouthfeel is medium, carbonated, dry, and crisp. Good dunkel, balanced and tasty."
"D - Another sessionable beer and also goes great with German food. Lord knows German food is best seasoned with beer."
"The toasty malt aroma gets you right off the bat. There is a slightly metallic tone in both the flavor and the smell. It has a dark brown body with some little tan bubbles forming the tan head and lace. It has roasted malt taste but that is average for this style. It is a good beer. Do not get me wrong but it is average or less for this area. There is barely any hops bitterness. The mouthfeel is smooth."
"OVERALL: A great dunkles lagerbier for sure. Full bodied and enjoyable. The bolder flavors might make it tough to drink too many of these, but the one I had was a real treat. I also sampled this one on tap in Munich and it was a gem there as well. Recommended."
"Get it - you'll be glad you did!"
"Overall, I really enjoyed the beer."
"Taste is nice with some good chocolates and subtle coffee flavors coming from the malts. The slightest touch of dark fruit. Low bitterness, but there is a tartness from the hops, I would assume. This beer is a little too fizzy for me-- too much like a soda. But overall, the mouthfeel was desirable and very drinkable. Tasty and worthwhile."
"D- Very drinkable, we had two liters and could have stayed for more if there weren't more beer halls in Munich to explore."
"Better on tap."
"This is an all-round classic and my favourite from the Brewery."
"Drinkability - Definitely a session beer. Maybe it was the atmosphere, maybe it was the people but I had 8 of these throughout the night and never thought twice about it."
"Oh well, just need to go back to Munich for another sample :D"
"D - A decent dunkel."
"yum"
"A fine example of that catch-call ""dark German beer", but certainly nothing mindblowing."
"Opinion: This is a great beer, but this particular example has some age on it. This is a pretty light style, so it doesnt age too well. I really like this beer, and think that it is a shame that there is no expiration/manufacture date to go by. I will drink it again, and just keep my fingers crossed that it is fresh."
"PROST! Beertracker"
"Great and full taste too as this one just aims for perfection . Great sweet maltyness with litle caramel, tiny bit of roast and a only slightly bitter taste. Strong cause of alcohol and noticeable too but still smooth mouthfeel that is enhanced by the low carbonisation. Yes this is a great exaqmple of the beerstyle and very enjoyable to me."
"Final Thought: A great session beer and another classic from the master brewery now in dunkel form via Munich."
"A tasty dunkel lager"
"A small, fizzy, tan head dies fast leaving naked the clear, dark brown, ruby highlighted beer. Minimal lacing. A super malty, nutty, sweet, rich, awesome nose. Ya! Sweet plums and grapes in front with a chocolate, caramel, fruity, alcoholic, buttery middle. A finish that's nutty, nicely bitter with a touch of tart grapes. A very nice, rich, fruity, nutty, caramel malt monster. Even better warm, when it starts to develop some cream."

"Medium-medium-low body, with an aftertaste fruity (citrus fruit, orange, strawberry, apricot)."
"Doughy, toffee, chocolate and caramel. Smooth, soft mouthfeel, with some nice burnt toast on the finish. Slight sweetness from the malts at the start, finishing dry and crisp. A very nice dunkel in the end, nice full, yet layed back mouthfeel, mouthfeel is nice and round aswell (Tap-GBBF 03')"
"This dark lager is a nice brown color, when held up to the light it shows deep amber notes. Malty flovors definitely dominate this brew, but they are accompanied by a bit of a burnt aroma and a hint of chocolate. Quite a dry beer over all. I also detect a hint of smokiness in the finish."
"Drinkability/notes: An excellent beer, it whispers quality with every taste. Due to its rich character, it seems an ideal candidate for a dessert beer. It would also be quite pleasing on a dark and cold winter's day. A beer to be sipped and savored."
"Beautiful chestnut colour, very good head. Aroma of caramel, dried fruits, oak and roasted malts, initially weak but improves as the beer warms up. Roasted malts and some caramel in the flavour, still a bit thin mouthfeel. Relatively short aftertaste without much bite. A decent Munich dunkel, but I did like the Neumarkter Lammsbräu better!"
