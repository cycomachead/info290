"Overall: Very much a Sly Fox beer. Clean, good, true to style, and slightly complex. The flavors shine in this one. Could easily do a six, although I still prefer other beers from this brewery."

"O: This one definitely grows on you, a worth example of the style."
"Overall pretty easy but a little unexpected, but still pretty fun to drink. Interesting this SlyFox brewery is with their German styles..."

"Pours a mostly clear medium brown, moderate cap of slightly off white froth, little retention on lacing. Scent leads with plenty of sweetness, but lacking in malt character, light caramel, faint faint vegital note. Taste again is sweet, but not in a pleasant malty way, mostly residual sugar-like, light caramel. Lighter side of medium bodied, some creaminess but no crispness. Uninspiring, lacking character."
"Overall, a very solid, crisp dunkel lager with a surprising smoothness. the more I have the more I think this is rivaling the pikeland pils for drinkability."

"A good solid drinker, but just a bit understated. Highly sessionable though."
""
"M, D- Very drinkable, with perfect CO2-to-sweetness balance."

"Oh yea, nicely done Sly Fox. Creamy and has a nice sweet - roast interplay. I could drink a ton of this, I really enjoyed the O-fest from them and this one follows in the same vein. They certainly know their lagers. Only complaint I have is that I could use a bit less roasty astringency on the finish."
"Best-by date on can: 4/19/11"
"O: The munich comes through in this beer and makes it a nice session beer."
"I'm very amazed at the quality of this lager. Everytime I drink one of these gems I keep wondering why I spend so much of time on IPA's and heavy stouts etc. If this beer is available where you live, don't overlook it..."
"Poured a clear, copper brown with a thin white head that receded to a patchy layer. Mainly caramel in the aroma, with some musk going on. Slightly toasted malts in the taste, caramel, nuts, slightly earthy, with a little hoppiness coming in afterward. Medium mouthfeel, and fairly drinkable."
"O: A solid, if not overly remarkable lager that showcases positively the Germanic/Bavarian heritage of the style. Likable enough and quite easy to drink. Nice to be able to try a good, malt-forward lager like this, especially from a CAN. No arm-twisting required for me to have another. If only I had another..."
"Overall I enjoyed the beer as a single but it still hasn't made me want more (6 pack or case) If I really want a tasty dunkel I would just pick up a Spaten."
"Pours an amber brown with a good amount of head. Looks fairly pretty. Smells very malty and dunkly. Sme nice lagery yeastiness on the nose as well. Tastes sweet and malt heavy. A hint of yeastiness and some nice light roast. Thick solid mouthfeel and very drinkable"
"D: The beer goes down very easily and is very sessionable."
"Pours an interesting medium brown color with a thick tan white head and a fair amount of lacing. Smells of caramel and sweet malts and some toasted bread. Tastes of sweet malts and a little caramel and a mild flavor of hops. Mouthfeel is medium with a mild carbonation. Drinkability is medium and nice."
"Pours a moderate brown color with a single-finger white head that doesn't stick around very long and does not leave behind much other than a few spots of lacing. The nose is comprised mostly of sweet malt along with a bit of caramel. Some hops in the background. Something quite odd about it. This continues into the taste, which is a bit too sweet without much of anything other than mild hops to carry it through. Body is light with moderate carbonation. Butter starts to come through as it warms. Probably not something I'd drink again, but who doesn't love a good canned beer?"
"Beer is thin and watery with a sweetness that goes with the aroma. It's not good....I do not enjoy this beer. The taste is slightly better than the aroma which tempted me to just pour it out but my curiosity always wins out. Sly Fox is not winning me over with this thin overly sweet disaster of the a lager. Also there is a strong diacetyl character. I won't have this again."
"D - Perhaps a little on the hoppy side for the style, but it suits my taste well. I'd definitely get this again."
"This is actually good! So nice, I'd do it twice (and probably will just to double-check some points) and, I feel, arguably representative of the style - just approaching having some characteristic depth..."
"Alas, Sly Fox can't brew all the German styles perfectly. The Pils and Weizen were spot on, but this Dunkel falls a bit flat. Decent beer here."
"And what's wrong with that, I'd like to know."
"Besides the nose, this was pretty decent but I've had this on draft at the brewpubs and enjoyed it much more then. Maybe this can was a little beyond it's sell by date."
"Drinkability: Not bad -- a good beer that is flavorful enough to keep you interested, but not overwhelming; the ABV is moderate and that helps as well; I do wish the flavors were a little more fulfilling and robust though."
"D: A great BMC gateway brew. Another CAN past its' labeled prime, but tasting very fresh."
"D - Very drinkable and refreshing. Surprising for a dunkel lager how nice it is. This may have restored my faith in lagers."
"One of the first beer I've had of this style, going to have to check out a few more."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is smooth and reasonable. Quite drinkable for a dunkel, good example of the style."
"Crackery pilsner malts lead the way, while hints of toasted caramel balance nicely with a spiciness from German hops. A slightly off-putting metallic sourness on the finish suggests copper, sulfur, and nickel. Mouthfeel is a bit too creamy for a lager, and the minerals don't do much to help the highly carbonated finish. All in all, a decent attempt, but I'd probably pass on this one in the future. Since this is the first Sly Fox brew I've been able to try, I won't be giving up on them, as something tells me they can do better."
"Overall a solid beer but not a head turner in my opinion. Still I would drink it anytime as I did enjoy it."
"D - Although the taste wasn't there...the refreshing and drinkability factor was...this could easily be a session beer"
"pours a clear med. copper-brown color w/ a thick off white cap which dissipates quickly leaving a decent lacing in my pilsn glass ; not a strong smell at all, some steely grain w/ hints of dark fruit and diacetyl ; a nice balance of hop bitterness to malts, flavor is mostly cereal grains and nuts with a tart, faint diacetyl note, more dark fruits here, finishes crisp & slightly bitter ; a dry, creamy, light bodied brew w/ plenty of co2 ; a very drinkable one, an excellent dunkel for sure..."
"Drinkability: pretty good"
"Sly Fox Dunkel Lager is a very clear amber beer with no visible carbonation. The head is a dense white foam that leaves nice lacing and has great retention. It has a very faint aroma like pretzels or dough. It is medium bodied and smooth with a sharp finish. It has a simple flavor, with good bitterness. It is crisp and dry and makes for easy drinking."
"Pours a clear chesnut hue with a very light tan colored head that falls to thin layer of foam. Really not much lacing to be seen, but there are a few spots here and there. Smell is light and sweet with carmelized almonds and and bread. Very faint noble hops with honey and grass in the nose as well. Taste begins with a touch of lemon and solid nutty backbone. Midway the sweetl malts emerge with notes of caramel and cocoa powder. Aftertaste is bready with some roasted malts, pretty good. Light and creamy body with a steady carbonation. A nice mouthfeel which almost feels like a session beer. Some of this and Pikeland Plis would be perfect for 18 holes. A style I'm not too familiar with but I would love to revisit this one for sure."
"The taste is fruity, sweet and complex. This is the first I have had from thsi style so im not quite sure what im tasting besides that is has a slight macro euro lager flavor to it. Smooth medium feel."
"There is just 'something' missing, not sure what but it needed the missing piece. Worth a try but nowhere near the glorious goop that comes out of the Pikeland Pils can."
"This is fairly light bodied with strong carbonation and makes for a fairly dirnkable brew. Still, it's an average dunkel at best for me."
"Overall this was a bit disappointing for me. It just really came off very flat, light, and one sided. Not at all what I was expecting from them. Perhaps it was a bad batch? Hard to tell, but a winner this was not."
"drinkability: I'm going to be pouring this out and rinsing my mouth out. I would've rated it worse if I didn't know that there weren't some things here that were good and trying to get passed whatever happened to this beer. There is obviously something wrong with this particular can and I plan to re-review it."
"Mouthfeel is a solid medium and this is a fairly drinkable brew. Overall this Dunkel tastes too clean and sterile for me to recommend this to someone else. A little lifeless and what is there isn't particularly favorable. Maybe its the can that has put me off, but I've enjoyed other canned Sly Fox brews."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus foamy off-white head, some nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, with some caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, with some caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, not really that much of a brew, glad to have tried it though."
"Recommeneded..."
"When poured into a Victory pint glass, the Sly Fox is a almost clear chestnut amber color that had a 1/2 inch head of white foam. It didn't take the head of foam very long to dissipate into a few islands of white bubbles, white bubbly rings along the edge, and spots of white lace. The aroma was mostly filled with sweet juicy fruits and a slight pinch of caramel here and there. That was it. When it warmed up quite a bit, the aroma stayed the same. It didn't want to change. The taste started off minor with sweet roasted malts and a small dab of sweet caramel. After the sweetness had left the tongue, in comes the crispy citrus hops with a smidge of grapefruit behind it. The mouthfeel was light with a lightly sweet and crispy aftertaste of roasted malts, caramel, and a handfull of citrus hops. The most interesting thing about this beer is the fact that it comes in a can. The beer itself is pretty much a decent Dunkel Lager."
"It took me a few ounces to get into the dunkel lager swing of things. Once I did, however, the quality of Sly Fox Dunkel Lager was easy to appreciate. Cheers for their recent award on this offerings's behalf. For once, it looks like a beer judging competition got it right."
"D: Very good drinkability, very clean flavor and probably one of the best by styles ive tasted. A prime example that beer in a can , can be everybit as good as from a bottle."
"D - Pretty tasty lager. Not much to look at, but pretty solid flavor throughout."
"It got two fingers' worth of foamy deep-tan head that quickly fell away to wisps. The nose had a chocolate/caramel scent to it, not lager-like at all. The color was deep-amber with NE-quality clarity. The mouthfeel was medium-to-full and there was a rolling mix of malty-sweetness, roasty-chocolate, and slightly bitter hops on the tongue. The finish seemed to linger with a more caramelized sweetness than anything else. Another really good beer from the Sly Fox peeps. Hey, Suze, may I have some more, puh-leeze?"
"Good for the style but a little lacking in complexity. There's distinct (and tasty) Munich malts with dark licorice flavors. The body is light-medium and incredibly smooth and drinkable. A great German session beer. I appreciate that I can get this fresh from a local brewer instead of having to try a green bottle that's been shipped thousands of miles."
"I'm watching a commercial with an old couple sucking face in the backseat of a car, but not even that can rain on this beer's comfy parade. How's that for an endorsement? It drinks easily and finishes with a clean slide. It's happily basic and hence fundamentally good. It's much better than watching people with dentures french kissing, that's for sure."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this dunkel. Very tasty, and an awesome lager."
"Drinkability: Sourness makes this hard to drink, especially since it's unexpected."
"Crazy check--this beer seems to have a very consistent rating in the high 3 range for most people, a lot in the 3.8, so the can seems to be giving a solid, similar impression to most. Even a couple low raters said ""better than a macro"" but didn't push higher on the score. Seems to be nothing to really hate, but maybe not anything particulary unique to really fall in love with. One said he couldn't see it as a session beer, though I think it falls right in that range."
"I had this with a salad. It was complimentary, nice but sweet. I am glad to have tried it but couldn't imagine this being a session beer."
"D: Kind of tasty, goes down easily, decent kick to it, not too filling, good representation of style. It’s not a bad beer, but it’s a little on the bland side, which would make me look for something else if at all possible."
"The brew poured to a nice chestnut brown color with a large light tan head that had good retention and left a bunch of lacing through out. The aroma is sweet, some chocolate like notes, and a slight metallic iron smell which is not bad. The brew goes down pretty well good, maybe a little too sweet but has a nice nutty flavor, some cocoa and caramel, with a slight hop break at the tail end. Overall this is a pretty good brew, to me it has a sweetness, at least that is what I am perceiving it as, that tends to make this a brew that I could enjoy only one or two at a single sitting. Another good offering from SlyFox."
"Pours a clear root beer brown, red highlights, thin fizzy tan head forms, disappears almost immediately, leaves a thin ring around the glass. Smell is sweet and malty, some caramel, bread and grains, citrus hint, bit of iron. Taste is sweet, some malts, bit of chocolate and grains, caramel, pretty light, but very drinkable. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Dark lager, not too complex, but gives a little more complexity than an average lager. Thanks Jay!"
"A bit of malt sweetness to start things out. Grain taste, not much else. Hard to separate this from a Michelob dark. Much better than a Macro lager, though. Cleaner for sure."
"Bottom line: This has a really unusual taste for a Dunkel and that keeps me interested for the entire session. I recommend it, as it would make for an excellent summertime staple."
"Overall- Not too bad. A sixer might get too cloying/ sweet to drink. 2 or 3 would be the max."
"Drinkability: While I have had better Dunkels, Penn Dark coming to mind as a comparison from the western part of the state, this is not bad"
"part of my bombing from SkinnyElvis...wish I could get these cans around here"
"Yummy"
"A solid everyday all purpose cooler weather lager. Nice job for lager loving PA."
"I was disappointed with this one. I really dig some of the Sly Fox bombers...a lot. I've been less than impressed with the canned products thus far. I thought it was the simple fact of canned beer at first but I've had a few winners packaged in cans in recent months. Unfortunately, this one was by far my least favourite of the seven or eight craft brews I've sampled from a can. In the end, it's far from awful and fairly average in most aspects, but I can't recommend it."
"This is a decent dark lager. A bit too sweet with an odd aroma. Enough going on to be interesting, and smooth enough to be drinkable. One to grab when going to a place where cans are more practical than bottles."
"Drinkability: its nice to get a solid dark lager in a can. Worth trying. Put some in your golf bag since bottles dont work there."
"I've gotta say, it's really awesome to see that Sly Fox beers are now being distributed up here in Western New York. Their beers used to be merely a treat I could find when we made our way down to New Jersey. Even then, I don't remember seeing the Dunkel Lager anywhere down there. So...Poured into a footed pilsner glass, I have before me a caramel-amber colored brew with an expressive and fluffy newsprint-hued head. Spicy, almost gamey, noble hop aromas that remind me of tarragon and sage, along with some very muted dark bread dough scents. Biscuity malts appear in the taste, bringing with them some sweetish caramel notes and the aforementioned hop spice flavors. This would kill with some good grilled Kielbasa, I bet. Great, noble hop flavors/scents buzz the nostrils during the burps. Light in body, smooth and crisp mouthfeel, lager-clean as well. A damn solid beer. I think I may have found a new session lager. In a word, kick-ass."
"Poured a light to medium brown with a huge blooming head that went over my glass before I could do anything about it,nice aromas quite floral with wispy cocoa notes and a touch of iron and roastedness.Pretty clean flavors touches of cocoa and biscuity malt with an underlying nuttiness.Subtle but nice flavors and quite food friendly and I really liked the nose,I never had this when I lived near the brew pub Iam glad to have it on hand now."
"Cheers!"
"D - It is really great to have this style available to me locally. I keep this on hand regularly. Even the BMC folks enjoy this one when visiting."
"Overall a tasty and very quaffable dunkel. Another good canned offering from Sly Fox."
"12 ounce can. Thanks BeerBeing!"
"A recomned brew if you can find it, give it out to everyone you can!"
"Definitely great to visit a new beer establishment in the Burgh and see the newest offerings from small breweries on stock along with 400 other micro, belgian, and german beers...this was the case at Bocktown beer and grille. The first German style dunkel I've ever imbibed from a can appears a dark copper amber tone with a large cream head leaves behind fine even lacing all around my glass with each sip. Definitely a different color than the king of all American brewed dunkel lagers...Penn Dark but I will accept this one. Aromatics...somewhat funky character some grassy noble hops it really smells unique for the style, also has mild chocolate and toasty caramel malt highlights but the tart mild lactic character has me scratching my head. It didn't turn me off just really caught me off guard for a dunkel. Flavors combine well, and that slight tart funky malt acidity actually works with a balancing hearty bready sweet malt tone doused with a finishing blast of noble herbal hop character with a delicate grassy character. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied evenly carbonated really is quaffable and smooth textured. Drinkability much like their other canned offerings not the most intriguing and well made versions but damn drinkable along with enough original tones to make it a go to when grabbing canned micros with the limited niche market these should sell without a problem."
"Very drinkable & pretty nice dunkle. Putting this in the can didn't hurt at all"
"Enjoy!!!!"
