"O - This beer is like a chocolate bar at the check out line. Very affordable and very tasty with coffee and chocolate notes. Definitely will drink again."

"Very well rounded for its style."
""

"Bland. Reminds me of Yuengling."

"I'm biased as this is my favorite beer of all time. Wonderful dunkel."
""

"O-good beer"
""
""

"This is by far best dunkel on draft lucky for me the brewery is 10 min from house the bottle is good but if you can get on draft I highly recommend"
""
""
"amazingly awesome this is a hell of a dunkel"
""
""
""
"I'm not familiar with this type of beer and to me it tasted a lot like wine for some reason."
""
"Nice head with decent lacing. Beautiful color dark bronze. Not to sweet but smell and taste molasses. Nice consistent taste throughout. Really nice beer."
"Best dunkel I have had. Honestly questioning myself on why I don't give it a 5. This beer is the only reason I go to their restaurant. Don't recommend this beer on the golf course or after playing softball, but that's about it."
"Overall - I like the style a lot, and wish I could try this on draft. The two dunkels I have had in bottles haven't been as great as the one I had on draft, but can't find dunkels on tap in my area. Cheers!"

"Not much head, medium chestnut brown in color. Nutty aroma, a bit of caramel. Taste is slightly sweet , smooth. Thin to medium body."

"I cannot give this one as thorough a review because I was drinking it at a tavern with colleagues after work. As a result, it would have been anti-social and beer geeky of me to leave the conversation to carefully analyze the elements of the beer. That said, I find this to be a high quality beer. I had it in a stein. I loved the brown color and enjoyed the malty sweet aroma. Highly drinkable. Refreshing, and a good beer to unwind with work friends on a Friday afternoon."

"Clear, medium-dark amber color. Nice balance of hops with a slightly malty finish. Yeah, the Germans know what they're doing. This one is really good!"
""
""
"Overall (3.54) : It's a tasty brew similar to a pale wheat ale. It's got the hops and cilantro thing going on, which pushes it into American Pale Ale territory, but it also has an uncanny maltiness that APAs typically do not have. It's not my type of beer but it's drinkable, and I'm glad I at least got to try it. Won't be buying it again, but I can respect it for what it is."

"10/02/13 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Fragrant. Caramel is the first impression but no bitterness. Medium body & long lasting taste. Harkens the days when all the Euro brews were shipping dark versions. Difference is this shows what they were trying for. Good beer."

"My FAVORITE beer of all time, draft at my nearest Hofbrauhaus in Cincinatti, NICE flavor rich taste.. the king of beer"

"Very smooth and delicious aftertaste that sticks with you. Really good beer."

"Pours a fiery copper orange. This beer is aglow with light and with radiance. A fat tan head of foam fell well and left a ring and some spots of lace to look at. Inside the glass it is as serene as a perfect pane of colored glass. The nose is breaddy. Dark crusty bread that is lightly toasted. There is a baked grain sweetness on this plus a sweetness from caramel. No fruity esters, no hops, wonderfully clean. Taste is tantalizing and smooth. All that malt but no heaviness. The body is thin and the lighter side of medium,. The malt is crisp. A brief hint of chocolate comes out as it warms but remains largely and delightfully unfullfilled. It envelops the palate just as it's light sweetness comes up to rescue you. The finish on this one is malty, breaddy and dry with a light touch of bitterness from subtle hops. Perfect."

"Overall, a pretty simple beer. There are other dunkels I would probably reach for first, but this one is nice for the price. Definitely a style that I need a bit more familiarity with."
""
""
"A solid Dunkel."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a new style for us, and we’ve been very excited for this foray. For whatever reason, of all the styles we’re currently missing on BA, this was towards the top of our list. As lovers of Münich style lagers, this one certainly does the region and the country justice. The beer remains light enough in feel, much in the same way the helles lagers do, to keep the beer from becoming overpowering or overbearing. The flavoring is robust, but packaged in such a simply and decidedly light fashion. It works very well."

"500ml bottle. Weizen glass. Brown color, crystal clear appearance. Tan froth creates a lively & brief crown. Toasted, slight woody, herbal aromas, hints of diacetyl. Sweet toasted & syrupy flavors. Light to medium body. Moderate but lively carbonation resolves in a watery texture. Candy flavor, hues of sweet almonds & nutmeg liquor touch are displayed in the middle. Sweet finish. Unbalanced & cloying!"
""
""
"A pretty average dark lager. I'm not sure how old my bottle was, but I doubt I will seek out another one. I have too much exporing to do in this style to revisit this one."

"This is a classic German dunkel. Taste is wonderful when had fresh at the Hofbrauhaus. Th beer is an attractive dark amber that drinks much lighter than you would think based on appearance. Very good, every day, 4 season beer. Good in a bottle, but really good in a stein from a keg"

"O: I think it is good example of the style. Its not overly complex or unique in its flavors but is a very drinkable brew. Its a nice dark lager that suits any time of year."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I like this brew. For me it's close to a session beer. I could drink more than one but the sweetness would leave me looking for a lawnmower beer or ESB. This is indeed another beer that reinforces my love of the Dunkel style. Another well done beer from Hofbrau."
"Overall: This is a great German dunkel, and, really, can you expect any less from a Munich beer? Nice and malty and extremely drinkable. I love it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark copper color with a huge off white head that persists forever. Smells of toffee light caramel and caramelized sugars with hints of dark dried fruits. The flavor is rich and malt with lots of burnt darker sugars. Light bits of prunes and raisins and a hint of sulfur. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick almost creamy mouthfeel. Nice dark lager, very well done."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, really flavorful and a nice brew to have on an October evening."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is generally on the sweet side with a full malty character, a hint of smoke, and a low to moderate bitterness. I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice Dunkel, great dark malt flavor without any roasted malt bitterness, very drinkable. Great find in this part of the world."
""
""
"Taste/Mouthfeel: Definitely has that musty German flavor to it. Heavily malted with hints of coffee. Molasses and raisins in the finish. Mouthfeel could use some more carbonation. Definitely too light. I know it's a lager, but this is too clean."
""
""
""
"One of my favorite beers, a smooth brew with good flavor. After 2 or 3 you will be feeling pretty good. A bit pricey for what it is though. It's a great beer that packs a punch and leave a good aftertaste. Not dry at all, down to the last drop. A truly notable brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, a good dark lager. A great introductory beer for someone wanting to ease into German beers, ease into dark beers in general, or just ease into beers outside the norm. A fine offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a pretty standard dunkel lager. Nothing special, yet I would say it's on the better end of the commonly available dunkels. I would love to try one on draft at a Hofbrauhaus."
""
""
""
""
"o – excellent example of a dunkel. I really enjoyed this beer."
"OVERALL: This is one of the toastier, roastier Dunkels I have had and it is quite pleasant, particularly on this cool, late summer evening in Colorado. I know Oktoberfest is coming, but this would make a killer fall porch beer."
""
"This way to easy drinking beer is quite good and refreshing."

"A really good dark beer. It has a lot of flavor and a dark rich color. It's a pretty heavy beer so it is something I tend to drink on occasion, just for its great flavor. It's presentation is fairly nice when poured into a serving glass. This is honestly one of my favorite beers and I believe it exemplifies what a dark beer should look and taste like."
""
"Maple brown with an orangish hue and perfect clarity. Poured with thick off-white foam that reduced to a wispy cap that left sheets of wet lacings on the glass. Earthy, sweet and lightly toasted malt and dark brown aromas, with toffee toward the end. Medium bodied with smooth, but aggressive carbonation through the middle leaving the body a bit thin toward the end. Dark bread and toasted malt flavors up front. Light floral hop bitterness through the middle followed by toffee notes and bready, toasted flavors toward the end. Finishes clean and crisp with floral hop and bready malt notes. A great malty German beer that’s very easy to drink."
""
"Highly drinkable brew, right here. Drinking this one during our summer camping trip at Frankenmuth was perfect; it went nicely with the hot dogs and hamburgers that day, and this is something I would gladly have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I can enough of this beer. My all time favorite. Hands down one of the best in my opinion. My brother went on holiday to Germany and mention about this great beer he had. Turns out las Vegas has a Hofbrauhaus. I had a stein and I fell in love with it ever since."

"Overall: Complex enough so as to not be boring, but easy enough to drink so as to not discourage drinkers not accustomed to this type of beer. It manages to be very sweet but balanced, not overwhelming. A very well made brew."
"Overall - A solid, but unspectacular dunkel. Certainly drinkable, even somewhat enjoyable, but it's nothing I couldn't live without."
""
""
""

""

"Poured a 330ml bottle into a Sam Adams glass. Poured a clear dark amber with a bit of cream colored head that lingers and leaves lacing. Aroma was very nondescript, with some malt sweetness that may have been chocolate or I could have made it up. The taste is about the same, a little more depth but not much beyond generic malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is very nice, a little hint of carbonation and very smooth. All in all, not bad, but not overly impressive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good malt caramelization, but the mouthfeel left something to be desired."
"O: Enjoyable malty beer with enough character to not be one note. Great with bratwurst and liverwurst."
""
""
""
"Like most dark lagers it lacked a little body, but overall it was a fine example of this style."
""
""
"Overall - This beer is pleasant/unassuming. Yes; I am damning this lager with faint praise. I was hoping for a little more."
""
""
""
""
"I feel like this is a good beer to have on hand for company or maybe with a meal. It's straightforward and gives the sense of a brewer who has worked hard to perfect a simple recipe. I would recommend."

"330 ml bottle into pilsener glass, bottled on 5/14/2012. Pours fairly clear dark copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with nice retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, apple, pear, raisin, toast, dark bread, molasses, herbal, floral, and earthy hops. Nice and pleasant aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, pear, apple, toffee, toast, dark bread, light chocolate, cracker grain, herbal, floral, grass, and earthy hops. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, toast, toffee, dark bread, light chocolate, cracker, grass, floral, and herbal on the finish for a short bit. Very nice flavor balance and robustness of dark malty flavors; with nice light floral hop balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy, lightly sick, and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good dunkel lager. Nicely robust and balanced flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
""
"Overall the beer is okay. It i very drinkable and it is free of an technical flaws. It is also not the best example of a dunkel that I have had."

"O - Well above-average beer. Not exceptional. Taste, combined with carbonation, makes it a refreshing beer that both appeals to AND satisfies the taste buds."
""
"Overall, Hofbrau Dunkle Lager is easy drinking and a good representation of the Dunkle Lager style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Other than being a bit too carbonated, I could easily see myself having a full liter of this over a good meal. A very simple and tasty beer that is quite drinkable and impressive in its simple flavor and aroma profile. I think I like this far better than the original Hofbrau."
"I paired this with the pork shank plate, which was also quite tasty..."
""
""
"Without doubt, this is overall pretty good dark German lager also without any offensiveness in drinkability."
"Overall – Easy drinking and good. A nice brew."
""
""
""
"O – A good example of a traditional Bavarian dunkel. Light, but flavorful malts that aren't at all sweet makes this a beer worth having several steins of across an evening, especially if matched with pork and sauerkraut. Tasty and enjoyable. While there's nothing about it that makes it distinctive, it's a solid, comfortable beer."
""
""
"This was solid, but didn't really stand out for me."
""
""
"Taste is nice darkly toasty barley, slightly caramelly peppery spice & wood, almost a bitter orange quality like Amer (the aperitif). Very woody, balanced, it is simple and straightforward, but has a good, solid, well-rounded character and is nicely drinkable."
"o - Overall I thought this was a very good dunkel. Super roasty and some nice caramel in the taste, and easy to drink. Would have it again."
""
""
"oh, and one more.... WHY/HOW CAN THERE BE NO PICTURE OF THIS BEER ON THE SITE???? so, i am uploading my picture. what a beautiful picture it is, isnt it? okay, never mind- it wont upload my jpeg. maybe THAT's why there's no pictures..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a roasty and moderately bitter beer with clean lager fermentation. The subtleties keep this from be a two dimensional beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" This dunkel is very tasty and has a nice amount of munich malt type toasted grain with slight bready accent and nutty flavors which come off slightly in the biscuit range with mild fruit which is more like dried fruit or slightly sweet raisin with a nice spicy hop finish. Overall I was very happy I got this and would drink it again, I consider it a pretty decent, solid representation of the style and it is a nice drinkable dark lager."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a lager glass. Pours a dark amber with a quickly receding, Almost non existent head. Leaving almost no lacing. The smell is of mild hops, dark figs, slight sweet candy, and some agave. Oh boy, will this be another tequila flavored beer? I sure hope not!. The taste? Holy fruitiness! Tastes like an alcoholic version of Minute Made's fruit punch!. Dark cherry, Dark cherry, and more Dark cherry. Kind of reminds me of a more flavorful version of Spaten Optimator. The mouthfeel adds more dark cherry, some medium grape, and quite an amount of bitterness. Not bad. Overall, This was a good, Easy to drink beer that I got for free. Can't beat that!"
""
""
""
""
""

"I liked it some much a had to go out a get a 1/2 keg of it at home in the kegerator. Its just as good as ever. Really a treat."

""
""
""

"Had this on tap at Kaizerhof in Yurakucho, Tokyo. Poured into a glass stein. As a German dunkel on tap, I was hoping for a bit more from this. It was a decent brown lager, but lacking a bit in appearance and smell. Perhaps from a bad pour (although I can't think so because the guys at Kaiserhof were pretty pro), but I found it just sitting in a foamless, bodiless state without much aroma of anything but a bit of roasted malts. The taste was decent enough, and I would drink it for fun, but not much to write about here. Good, but not amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Wow, could I put down a few of these. They sure know how to do lagers in Munich."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The brew pours from the green bottle a deep copper, caramel color with a few centimeters of dishwater foam. In-depth malty aroma mixes with freshly toasted, almost nutty, character. That strong malt dominates the flavor--toasted malt to biscuit. The hops raises its head toward the end to provide a nice balance. This is a smooth and tasty brew."
""
"had this one at the hofbrau house in las vegas. pours a thin dark brown color with a 4 inch foamy white head into a solid liter glass. the appearance in this presentation makes the beer for me. the beer itself however, is lackluster. smells like german malts sure, maybe a touch of brown sugar and yeast as well, but nothing particular arousing here. flavor is a standard dunkel, smooth and drinkable for a darker beer. plenty of roast on the malt profile, and a bready/doughy finish makes this one feel like breakfast for me. feel is fine, mellow bubbles and a medium body. i could hammer these, and i think thats the point. the atmosphere of the pub and the good traditional bavarian grub made this beer seem better than it really is, but still its one ive come to appreciate."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear dark orange with a 1/2 inch foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks and dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt and some slight caramel aromas. Taste is slightly sour with some dark malt, bread, and caramel flavors. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I think this one smells better than it tastes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: a lot more complex than most munich dunkels - quite nice - and I liked the contrast of dark malts and hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Rosie’s Wine bar. Pours ruby with a long lasting white head. Aroma is of grain, toffee and honey. Medium, slightly crisp body. Toffee toasted malt, noble hops and some cloves combine on the palate for a clean, fresh taste. Long hoppy finish is supported by sweet malt. This is a world-class dunkel."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good Munich Dunkel. Nothing's really in your face, but everything is balanced impeccably."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours a clear ruby color. The head is one inch of off white foam that recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of caramel, and toffee with some nice fruity and floral notes. The taste is similar to the aroma with a clean refreshing finish. The mouthfeel is slightly lighter than medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a good dunkel that I would drink again."
"O - Not a bad Dunkel and worth a try."
"Overall - It's not what you would call complex in flavor, but it tastes great and it's very easy to drink! What more could you ask for?"
""
""
"O: Good drinkability. Good beer. Hofbräu usual quality"
"Many thanks Todd."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It does not get any better than enjoying a liter of a great Dunkel with the HB Wurst platter and sauerkraut. This was a definite must while visiting Munich. Very glad I did it and would enjoy another."
""
""
"Overall a solid, highly drinkable brew that was a good match for my turkey sandwich."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Easy to drink, nothing too exciting though."
""
"Goes down easy, nice representation of the style."
"Overall: a great beer not very complex but enjoyable simple"
""
""
""
"O: This was a nice find in the import section. Glad it wasn't skunked. Well worth a pick up at $1.59 a bottle."
""
"This beer pours a clear, dark amber with 3/4 inch head and lasting lace. The aroma is a bit skunked with some caramel, and sweet roasted malt. The flavor is of caramel, root beer barrel candy, grass and a hop tang in the finish. The mouthfeel is light-medium, a bit sticky. Hofbrau Dunkel is an average beer, recommended."
""
""
""
""
"D- Great beer, tried one and then had to have a Mass just to make sure I liked it. Enjoyed with a pork knuckle."
"It tastes as good as it looks. A malty, hoppy pleasure. It makes me REALLY want to go back to gGermany and visit my grandfather's grave."
"On a side note, this one of my favorites all around, and also my ""go to"" choice whenever cooking a recipe that calls for an unspecified style of beer."
"Overall Impression- While not being @ an Oktoberfest/ Kerwe Festival since Fall 2009, this brew brought back memories and also is my favorite from Hofbrau! Most their biers are pretty average and spot on with characteristics, but this ones flavor was over the top and enjoyed every last drop out of this Litre. What will be #500 for me? Who knows..."
"Overall: Just like I had in Pittsburgh, this dunkel is delicious. Now all I have to do is go to Munich so I can order a few liters or drink out of the boot."
"Color is a deep amber/brown, with a thick head, good retention and lacing. Smell caught me by surprise. It's toasty smelling, and grainy too, which is very nice, but something odd is in there as well. Almost a bit of a dry dog food smell. The taste is excellent. Similar to rye bread toasted with a dash of brown sugar. Nicely balanced, seems to almost finish on the dry side with a slight hop bite on the end. Aside from the slightly odd smell, it's a wonderful lager. I can only imagine how great it would be on tap at the Hofbrauhaus in Munich."
"mouthfeel - good creamyness, nice carbonation, could use a bit more if anything. a bit sticky and cloying. body is medium to big."
"Overall: The dark beer from this respectable German brewery is just that; a very respectable drink. While I was not jumping for joy over it, I would certainly give it a look again. Not to mention, it is an easy drinker and quite suited for the current fall clime."
"O- A great sipper that's tasty and enjoyable without a crazy amount going on."
"Had a mug at Radegast in Williamsburg. I thought it was a bit too sweet and didn't really like the mild black licorice character, but it was otherwise a clean, drinkable lager. I was hoping for toasty malts and got more mellow caramel. This is one of the simpler dunkels I've had, but certainly not a bad beer."
"Two plus fingers of frothy beige head over light caramel brown/clean copper hues. Active bubbles and a head that sticks around nicely. Spicy and earthy on top of caramel aromas, a balance I appreciate. Flavors are sugary sweet with light notes of chocolate. Balanced out nicely by bitterness and fresh hay aromas. Mouthfeel is thin but does well to coat the palate flavorfully. A really nicely balanced and clean beer."
"O: This brew has a very nice salty character. A beer that truly is exemplary of a style. Full bodied, crisp, and jagged with rough wheat flavoring components. I appreciate the rawness of this lager, and especially acknowledge that there's pretty big flavor in here despite lower alcohol. A very reasonable session brew, and if I wasn't so sold on American Ales, I could see myself drinking this without argument."
"Pours a dark nutty brown color with a nice head that dissipates slowly. Smells very malty with some hints of spice. The malts definetly come throgh in the taste but nothing else really stands out, coats the mouth nicely. Overall a great drinkable dunkle."
"O: Good, easy drinking beer. I could see putting a couple of these down with a hearty German meal. Recommended."
"After getting hooked on the Hofbräu original I had to try the Dunkel. I've never been a huge fan of darks but this one will surely keep a permanent place in my fridge! Simply delicious! I wish I had tried it on tap while at The Old German Beer Hall in Milwaukee, WI but only had the original there. I tried the dunkel from bottle. Fresh, lightly carbonation, nice aroma, and highly recommended!"
" Overall I was very pleased with this beer and I will be buying more in the near future."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice brown hue, with a decent foamy head. Nose is a woody malt combined with the smell of tea. Flavor is woody malt, with a slight hint of sweet. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Yup, still here. It's a nice place, somewhere you can enjoy your beers and sports without all the noise and whatnot elsewhere. Anyway, this brew pours a clear sunset amber topped by a finger of off-white micro-foam. The nose comprises dark wheat, light maple syrup, very light roasted malts, and some light walnut. The taste holds notes of very light roasted malts, very light caramel, minerals, and very light cashews. Somehow, all of these relatively mild flavors combine to something mostly tasty. I'm not gonna argue here... The body is a hefty-leaning light, with a very light moderate carbonation and a nearly watery feel. Overall, an enjoyable dark lager, something I could see downing a boot of here very soon..."
"A nice rich brown color with creamy white lacing, great retention, and creamy walls of lace. The smell is of caramel with a touch of dark roasted malts and peppery notes. A good noble hop balance on the back end. The taste is of toffee and caramel with a good touch of dark roasted flavors. Some nutty tones with a peppery, herbal finish of noble hops. A touch watery on the mouthfeel with a creamy finish. Very easy to drink."
"Poured into a plastic cup (whatever, it was free). Slightly hazy, dark chestnut color with a nice white head. Grainy aroma, sweet malts. Malty taste, roasty, with some caramel notes and pumpernickel. Light-medium mouthfeel, maybe a bit watery, but not necessarily bad in that regard. Easily drinkable."
"D: A very easy drinker. Really easy. Not overly enticing, but you could easily have a few of these."
"drinkability: well balanced, equally drinkable lager."
"O=An extremely solid but unspectacular beer. It's a treat I come back to every now and again for the decent taste and great memories from my time in Germany."
"Pours a deep clear amber with a nice tan head malt, some bread and yeast. Taste is caramel malt, toasted barley, some light bitterness. Has a nice medium body, with moderate cabonation. Finish is dominated by caramel malt, some toasted barley and light hops. Overall a good easy drinking brew."
"A straightforward beer, nothing exemplary, I enjoyed the hefe a touch more. I wouldn't recommend this over other dunkels though."
"drinkability is ok - the price kills this for me $11 a six pack is just too much"
"D- sure its drinkable and one i will look for on tap again"
"This beer appears a dark walnut hue with crimson highlights. The head stands in at a half inch, and leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass. Aromas include toffee and slightly sweetened malt. The flavor brings additional flavors of chocolate and lightly toasted bread, along with an authentic German lager taste. The feel is relatively thin in body, with adequate carbonation. The beer now comes in a green bottle, which I find perplexing, as it was formerly in brown bottles. Fortunately, in this instance, I did not detect any of the skunky, off flavors commonly associated with imported beers in green bottles. Overall, a decent beer."
"Clear amber-brown, a little lighter than expected for the style. White suds top the body, settling to a collar and film after a moment. Smells pretty good, raisin and toasted-caramelized malt being most prominent. There's some lightly sulfuric lager yeast character, too, and a bit of oatmeal cookie. It opens with a metallic twang on the palate that transitions into a note of bready toasted malt. It ends with an earthy breadiness and a dash of leafy hops. A good, solid dunkel; nothing spectacular, but good."
"All in all another great beer from Hofbrau ,,what tradition these brews never let me down."
"Pours a rich amber color, head does not last long and has some nice lacing. Smell hints of cashews and caramel. Taste has some nutty sweetness and finishes rather dry. Mouthfeel is dry and entices you to have more. Supremely drinkable and all in all a really nice dark lager. Gad this in Munich years ago and did not ever remember it this way. Bad memory or undeveloped taste buds."
"On tap poured into a 1L stein at Hofbrau Las Vegas. A dark amber color pour with a bug lasting offwhite foamy head , leaving lots of spotty lacing ,lively carbonation . Aroma of dry caramel malt grain , toasty with some molasses, toffee ,and a wheat type tang .Flavor is dry and nutty with caramel and molasses, suprisingly complex, some earthy hops , a very slight metallic hint , probably from the carbonation, gets much better as it warms .Light body with a slightly dry but crisp and clean mouthfeel , short roasty finish , very drinkable and very good. This was all in all a great beer."
"Not particularly flavorful. Mild caramel roasted malt notes. Hops and malt combine to produce an apple cider character that fades in and out of the picture. While this style is expected to be relatively mild-mannered, this clocks in toward the bland end of the spectrum."
"Drank this Dunkel out of a 1 liter stein in Munich at the Hofbrauhaus beer hall. Deep dark reddish-brown in color with perfect clarity. A nice 1 1/2 thick head that only gradually diminished while drinking. Toasted malt aromas with a hint of caramel. Taste was crisp and smooth and paired perfectly with the German sausage and sauerkraut!"
"This is one smooth and easy drinker. A guy could get in trouble in short order."
"We have fond memories of liters of this beer with the band in the background and a big heaping Original HB Brotzeit Platter. The bottled version sent to the US is a fine consolation until our feet are firmly planted within their beer hall again."
"Brown and crystal clear. Very little carbonation. Excellent head retention and plenty of lace. Aroma of toasted bread with some. Medium heavy body up front and very soft on the palate. Some acidity in the middle, but good balance between the malt, alcohol, and hops. Very subtle bittersweet finish with possible a bit of graininess. Some acidity on the back end, as well."
"This is an excellent example of an underrated style. While not complex it is well balanced and very quaffable."
"good creamy mouthfeel--not my any means thick, but neither watery. hop flavor is a little more prominent than i would expect (lends a zesty, spicy character). plenty of munich flavor"
"Drinkabilitly - I thought this was a very solid beer. The more I drink German brews, the better I am understanding what they are about. Of the German styles I have tried and reviewed thus far, this is one of the best. It's easily drinkable and goes down all too easy."
"I could have a few of these in a sitting without hesitation. A solid interpretation of the style."
"Easy to drink, and a nice flavor. An easy choice to quaff a few. Not the best, but enjoyable."
"Smooth and silky flavor with light carbonation. Not a bad beer but there are far better dunkels out there. This one reminds me of a strong tea that's been steeped to long. I find it to be too much on the bitter and acrid side of things."
"Pours a clean copper to orange-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, like a mixture of a lager and caramel. In the taste, caramel, earthy, and a small fruitiness. A smooth and medium to light mouthfeel, with a clean fruit and caramel stickiness in the aftertaste. OK, nice flavor but still quite lager ish."
"D: Finishes smooth. A little sweet for my liking, couldn't handle a few in a sitting, but on its own, very enjoyable."
"Hofbrauhaus Munchen--Munich, Germany--Hofbrau Dunkel. 5.50% ABV. 10 IBU's? Off white mild lace head. Clear thin brown color with a hint of amber. Light roasted soft hop front. Mellow sweet smooth dunkel minimal chocolate light roasted lager body. Clean mild hop end. Nice version of bland style. (3.5 / 5.0) Sampled 5 oz. Taste @ Fremont Oktoberfest in Seattle on 9/25/2010."
"D: The beer is rather easy to drink and can be considered sessionable."
"Appears a ruby caramel tinted brown color with a light tan head forming a nice thicket of billowing head. Aroma slightly roasted malt hints of caramelized toasted malt profile with herbal spicy noble hops. Flavor clean drinkable well made lager, with darker roasts providing caramelized toasted malts, herbal hops bring a beautiful balance. Mouthfeel has easy going carbonation with a nice herbal toaste malt finish. Drinkability overall is very drinkable much like other German breweries, a tasty rendition of a classic dunkel style."
"I"
"At the source in Munuch. 1L masse mug Dark Beer served with Old Munich browned ""Milz"" sausage. Juicy watery quenching lightly sweet malty deep amber/brown. Lace rings descend down the inner mug wall like evidence of past alluvial foam floods. No matter what they say, Hofbrauhaus is fun and infectious. The brass band encourages audience participation (or is it the other way around?) and you leave with a certain glow and love of mankind. I've visited Hofbrauhaus (Munich) four times and it never gets old. Actually it reinvigorates me and validates my passion for beer with the people who mean the most to me."
"D very drinkable beer. Could be nice for a session, as a compliment for whatever food, or a great after work brew. A delight."
"This beer pours a rich reddish brown with just a little off white head that quickly dissipates. The smell is mostly of caramel and malt. The taste matches the smell exactly with a little bit of toasty flavor at the end. The mouthfeel is about what you would expect from a beer of this style. Overall a pretty tasty beer, but as these are fairly sweet I don't think I could drink more than a couple of these per session."
"As with the Hofbrau Original I reviewed earlier, I've had this one on-tap many times and it's actually a personal favourite - I make a point of not leaving my local Bavarian cafe leaving without having at least one of these! But in the bottle it's a slightly different proposition. The coffee aromas and overtones so notable here barely rate a mention in the tap variety and this version also seems well down on creaminess which is something the other version had in spades. Good either way but if you can get it on tap then that's the best way to drink this one."
"Nice drinkability. ABV isn't too high and the flavor isn't too strong. I'm drinking these in the summer, so this is a good all year round malty beer."
"Pours a dark amber color with a thick head. Smell is sweet, nutty with a little bit of caramel. Taste is a wonderful, its sweet and malty. Finished with just a touch of hops. Has a feel that is soft and smooth but crisp. I truly enjoy this beer and need to find it in the states somewhere."
"Crystal clear, coppery brown with a thin cap of beige bubbles. A thick collar left streaky lace on the glass. Malty aroma, bread and dough, brown sugar and nuts, faint hops. Mild bitterness and hop flavour, mostly malt up front, bready with a light nuttiness. Bitterness was more prominent in the finish, as was a bit of herbal hops. A little more than light bodied, a bit dry, moderate carbonation, decent texture. Not bad at all - I enjoyed it. Certainly balanced towards malt, but with a nice hop presence and flavour profile."
"The beer pours an amber color with a white head. The aroma is bready and biscuity malt with some toffee and earthy hops. The flavor is semi-sweet toffee with some earthy hops notes. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not a bad beer, just not to exciting."
"Notes: This is another all-around solid beer with good balance and drinkability."
"D- Not bad whatsoever. A little different with the smokier aromas and darker coffee tastes. Definitely better than I expected."
"D: This is a very easy drinking beer. I was through my glass quickly and wanting more. A perfect beer on a warm night."
"Drinkable enough, a fairly good shot at the style. I remember this being better on draft back in Deutschland..."
"O I know this is supposed to be a beer that defines the style, but I expected more fullness and body. Its a good beer, and would be a nice foray into darker beer for those used to drinking Macro light beer."
"A dark amber color pour with a bug lasting offwhite foamy head , leaving lots of spotty lacing ,lively carbonation . Aroma of dry caramel malt grain , toasty with some molasses, toffee ,and a wheat type tang .Flavor is dry and nutty with caramel and molasses, suprisingly complex, some earthy hops , a very slight metallic hint , probably from the carbonation, gets much better as it warms .Light body with a slightly dry but crisp and clean mouthfeel , short roasty finish , very drinkable and very good. This was all in all a great beer ."
"This was my first Dunlel and Iam very impressed. Dark copper in color. Malty nose with hints of carmal and chocolate. The mouth feel was firm and satisfing with carmal and chocolate on the tounge. a thin cream colored head that faded to the edges about half way thruogh. In my top 10 beers."
"Drinkability - This style is growing on me. It offers some of the roasted flavors of darker ales in a lighter lager body. This particular example is benchmark type material for the style and very drinkable."
"This is almost certainly my favorite style.... I know it his hard to brew well.. but why don't Americans enjoy something nice and malty?"
"Drinkability: Not bad. Definitely worth having again if the mood strikes me just right."
"Medium body with good carbonation. Makes this drinkable, but it is still kind of a soft beer. My one bitch is that it needs just a little edge to it. Still, a very decent brew that I will enjoy again."
"Drinkability: This used to come in a brown bottle so who knows what brilliant marketing strategy convinced them to shift to green, but the skunkiness ruined what otherwise would be a nice beer"
"I have to say, i'm pleasantly suprised with this one, great example and priced right."
"Very light mouthfeel, made edgy by the dryness and carbonation, even though it's mildly carbonated. For me it's too thin on the mouthfeel to help with the balance, and a little too harsh to be very drinkable. Overall, a slightly off-balanced beer from the bottle, unable to control the complexity with the mouthfeel. I'd be willing to try it again if I saw it on tap."
"Fairly light body with moderate carbonation and a thinner mouth-feel than I was expecting. Quite drinkable, but I was hoping for more richness than I tasted."
"Very straight foward. Some milk chocolate sweetness with charred sugar flavors. Mild bitter hop finish. Good crisp carbonation. Nice flavors and mouthfeel but a little lean. Highly drinkable."
"D- all around great beer, glad to have a keg of this stuff. Not too heavy and not too strong and excellent to sit down and have a few of. Seems it would go great with all manner of meats and poultry and especially sausage. Probably breakfast too. Entirely drinkable for something malty and on the dark end. Not overbearing in any way, just a relaxed, flavorful brew."
"D - Not bad but very underwhelming. Nothing about this beer stands out besides the tall head and clear body. Ok drinking but plain overall."
"This a very good Dunkel beer, heavy and full of amazing taste. Awesome out of a bottle and on tap. I poured this beer into a tall hansom German glass, that resembled a Weizen Glass. The beer was phenomenal! I really enjoyed thus beer. This beer is amazing to have at the bar, and is another great beer to add to any collection."
"Value: Great value if you're in the mood for a solid dunkel."
"Someone left this in my fridge from last weekend, so I might as well review it. Pours a dark copper color with one finger of creamy head that faded slowly with no real lacing. The aroma from this beer is fantastic; it smells malty sweet with some graininess and breadyness. Taking a sip, the front end is surprisingly underwhelming and very thin. The flavor builds into a slightly sweet, malty middle and goes out a mild bitterness and then finishes fairly clean and fast with just a hint of breadyness. This is a decent beer than smells better than it tastes."
"On tap at Nick's German Bar & Restaurant in Worcester. Served in a normal pint glass. Dark brown color. Not as much head as I would have expected. Any prominent smell was not noticeable. Taste was fresh and clean. Nice and malty with a roasted barley backbone. Smooth and easy to drink lager. Low abv, so this beer goes down quite well. This was a nice find on tap, and I wish they served it in mugs."
"Drinkability: Good sessionable beer. a good change from the regualr hobrau original."
"d- easy to drink...in large quantities. Great party beer, awesome to drink at the hofbrauhaus locations, such as pittsburgh"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to session with if you're in the mood for the style."
"D=extremely drinkable and enjoyable."
"I did not think that I would like this beer, but my stash was gone within a week. I kept coming back to it and found it very drinkable. I will have it again when my desire for lagers returns."
"Pours a clear, dark amber color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of yeast, pale hops, and pale malt. Fits the style of a Munich Dunkel Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, pale malt, and pale hops. Overall, a good blend, drinkability, body, and appearance."
"Bottle: Poured a light clear burgundy color lager with a medium size foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of dry caramel malt with light toffee notes. Taste is drier then expected with some caramel and light molasses notes. Body is about average with OK carbonation. Not bad but really not a style that I dig."
"Drinkability: In terms of ABV and feel, pretty highly drinkable. Unfortunately, the draught version of this dunkel is so much more flavorful and full-feeling that it diminishes the desire to knock a few of these back."
"Cheers!"
"This is a beer for avoiding."
"D: This is fantastic. The malt profile here is complex and tastes outstanding. You could drink this beer all night. I highly recommend this one"
"Hofbrau Dunkel pours a very dark brown with a think, 1-2"" foamy tan head. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. The smell is malty and sweet, and the taste is similiar with just a little bit of bitterness mixed in. Overall tho, this is a smooth beer with a coffee/chocolate aftertaste. Very easy to drink. Highly recommend."
"D: Good. ALways liked this Dunk, but, I think others have caught up, or surpassed it. Did a side-by-side with the Michelob Dunkel, and the Mich, in my opinion, just blew it away. The Mich was way more comlex, and refreshing. Surprised the crap out of me.."
"Overall, a pretty damn solid example of the style and an enjoyable drinker."
"Overall, it's not something I would stock in the fridge, but once in a while it'd be nice to have a 6-pack here and there."
"This dunkel has a nice medium body with vibrant carbonation. It really hits the mark for a good crisp, refreshing beer that is still substantial and not watery."
"Simply an average beer. Chestnut brown in color-minimal lace/head. Rather lean in the mouth with a simple malt component-no real complexity here. Perhaps I got a tired bottle. I'll retry this one. It did however work with a hot pretzel and cheese sauce for breakfast."
"D: A nice mouthfeel and taste combination makes this beer pretty nice to drinking. Seemed a little filling later on, but still pretty good overall."
"D- Overall, a very drinkable beer...I've had this many times, both out of the bottle and on tap, and neither disappoints...A great example of the style, and very enjoyable..."
"It tasts hoppy, heavy and has a great texture in my mouth. This is a very good beer."
"Conclusion: NICE dunkel lager, simple, but tasty and quite drinkable"
"Drinkability: Simple, easy, and pleasant. Definitely not some huge favorite of mine, but with pretzels and pork knuckle it was fantastic at the brewery. By itself it's a little one-dimensional, but still a nice and interesting brew."
"This beer pours a reddish,brown colour with ruby highlights which leaves a two finger creamy head that disspates quite quickly and leaves subtle lacing down the glass it smells of dried fruits,plums and spicy hops and tastes quite sweet with some caramel backnotes quite nice indeed."
"Had on tap at the brewery in pittsburgh. The color is a reddish brown color. Decent head to the beer. Not much of a smell to it. The smell was a roasted malt. The mouthfeel wasn't much good have been better, but the overall taste was very good. The taste was a little on the lighter side but was of malt and not complex. Overall it was an above average dunkel."
"Overall a decent dunkel. A bit more malt would help."
"D: Highly drinkable brew. At 5.5% ABV this dunkel is very sessionalbe."
"this beer gets it all right."
"The mouthfeel and is nice and light, crisp and refreshing, leads to good drinkability."
"D - Excellent. I really enjoyed this. Wish I had more."
"D - Good. Overall a good beer. May be overhopped for the style."
"Taste is sour with a bit of that spice promised on the nose. A good complex palate with highs and lows, but at the same time taste is not all that pleasant, tastes like a standard amber ale and not roasted enough to be dark and brooding. Just a fair amount of tartness. Mouthfeel is not bad, quite smooth. It's drinkable enough but doesn't really spank me."
"Very glad I got to try it at the HB house, this is a very solid dunkel."
"I have to give this one a lower drinkability due to the funny taste it had at the end."
"Poured into a pint glass, a deep copper color. Generates about two fingers of off-white, creamy head while leaving a generous amount of lacing and has good head retention. Smell is very sweet, a bit of alcohol detected, some malts. Taste is similar, a little sweet, finishes off slightly bitter. Some malts come through. Mouthfeel is pretty light, smooth with a good amount of carbonation. I might drink this again, but I don't know if I would buy it."
"just kind of beer for the rest of my life, this would be it."
"Nice head, off white in color. Dark red amber hue. Not much arome slightly malty? Coffee? Smelly. Initial malty taste. Clean finish. Slight yeasty and alcohol after taste. Light texture ""watery?"" wet. Little to no aftertaste, little flavor. Good for multiple brews --> not much to i, not complex. Lower middle of the road. Might get it again for a Oktoberfest style drinking session(not for just a 1 beer sitting)."
"D - This is one of the prettiest dunkel lagers that I've ever seen. The nice thing is that it tastes great, too."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Solid, moderate carbonation fuels the flavors and brings out the malty, natural elements I mentioned before. Great alone and with the cheese I've selected, but it could certainly complement a burger or sausage just fine too. A worthy, widely-available Dunkel Lager from Munich."
"This is a pretty good dunkel by this classic Munich brewery. I used this to wash down some cheese, sausage, and smoked pork chops."
"I poured the second bottle right square in the middle. The head rose up thick and foamy with quite large bubble clinging to the sides of the glass. Carbonation remained the same as previously mentioned. More sips and more of the malt made friends played nice with my mouth parts. This beer is even more enjoyable the second time around. It's full, flavorful and tasty without any price to pay in a surprise ending or mystery ingredients. The beer tasted almost like a light porter, or an overweight ale but definitely not like Guinness. The unique maltiness of the beer really sets it off as being something special."
"It's a good beer. I can drink a few of these and not complain."
"I am probably biased toward German lager beers in general but, this is a very good brew that I appreciated more and more as I went along. Try it out for sure!"
"Medium body, with moderate carbonation. Decent beer, though I don't get the distinct bread crust notes that are alluded to in the style guidelines. Easy to drink, and certainly sessionable."
"Overall - A good example of an uncommon style. I'd really like to try this on draft, but I'll consider buying it bottled again."
"This beer could be so much better, it was given to me for free, so I can't really complain, but I certainly won't be drinking this on purpose again."
"D: A good beer but I was expecting more flavor but would enjoy as an excellent session beer."
"I had this on tap at the Hofbrau Haus in Las Vegas. The beer was dark brown and translucent with a ginourmous head that filled half the 1L glass. The smell was toasty and a little bisuity, only malt really came through in the nose. The taste was sweet maltiness, a little roasted too. The body was substantial enough for the style, which means a little thicker than water. Very drinkable, a top-notch dunkel lager."
"Notes: I thought it was a pretty good beer and I would buy it again. I don't go crazy over Dunkel Lagers,but I respect this brew."
"I really like this beer and it's a classic for me. Easy to drink but just a little heavy from the big malt profile. I could down a couple easily but not sure I'd want to session this. Lord knows I did in Munich, though."
"Nice malty aroma of caramel with hints of chocolate, moves into the quaff effortlessly, backed with a sturdy backbone of roasted malts with a great balance of hops. In fact , this one finishes with a spicy hop kick (for a dunkel). Very solid on all accounts, a great drinking brew"
"Poured from green bottle to a HB Pilsner Glass that came with the 6 pack (Sieberts, Yonkers NY). Was a chestnut brown with red hues and a minimal cream foam head. Smelled like roasted malts with a hint of sweet caramel. Tastes fantastic. Roasted malt sweetness prevails here with minimal bitterness and crisp, sweet finish. Carbonation gives this a nice balance and an almost creamy feel. This is a very drinkable beer, but seems to me that it is MUCH better ice cold."
"OK."
"I had this one during a nice session with a few pals. This was the weirdest of the bunch. For some reason, I had high hopes for this brew. What I ended up with reminded me of a generic Cola soda that had gone flat. The smell, mouthfeel, and appearance were very similar to (but not as sweet as) cola. It was so strange. It was easily drinkable, but not really appetitizing. The taste was... blah. It went down smooth but I was unable to finish a whole bottle because it was so bland for a beer. Makes me sad, to be honest. It wasn't bad, persay... just really not worth the effort."
"This is a medium-bodied beer. Taste starts with lightly toasted malts, closing with a subtle hop finish and a final hint of citrus from the wheat."
"D: Easily drinkable, not a bad beer at all. 4.0"
"12oz green bottle. Pours a dark copper color with a creamy off-white head. The aroma is very malty with toffee and caramel and molasses. The taste like the aroma features a good amount of malt that is slightly toasted. This is a very smooth and drinkable Dunkel that I could easily drink more than one in a sitting. Overall, Hofbrau Dunkel is a good beer that is representative of the style, recommended."
"D - I really don't like this beer much, but for some reason that would not stop be from drinking a bunch of this. Sessionable if not delectable. It's clean and unoffensive and I think that's the point with this style."
"Recommended, will definately buy some more of this (already have bought 3 sixers this year!)."
"D = Can really only give this one average drinkability, I wouldn't turn it down necessarily, but it's just not that special."
"Drinkability: Nice balance yet full flavor in a beer that fairly light and clean make this a very drinkable beer. Drinking it in the Hofbrau House in Milwaukee in a liter mug made it even better."
"D: A great beer and one of the better Hofbrau offerings I've had."
"what the hell? i thought green glass was basically against the law in Germany except for Becks and Spaten because the beers are only a step up from garbage. Im sure this beer had promise at one point, but the glass ruined the entire experience, and honestly its flavor as well. I have no idea how long this has been sitting in a warehouse under lights, heat, cold, etc. It poured a murky brown color with a decent tan head. Roasted malty nose with some nutty tones. It tastes like it could have been good at one point. Toasted barley, mellow aged hop undertones and an easy drinking body. This thing was just off. Put this in brown bottles. Beer inside green bottles doesn't have to be old to taste bad."
"By far, my favorite beer of all. The flavors in this beer explode along with the wonderful aroma of caramel. I usually have two liters of this great beer on tap, at the Heidelberg in NYC, the food and beer are fantastic, I have never been disappointed. I have serious trouble trying to keep my glass on the bar."
"mouthfeel is crisp from carbonation, bitter, easy to drink, extremely sessionable"
"pours a deep copper-brown with a fizzy white cap that quickly subsides leaving a nominal lacing in my pilsn glass ; a subtle smell, steely grain and a bit of grassy hops, just a hint of nuts and dark fruits ; a smooth flavor w/ a decent bite, more cereal grains than anything, a bit of caramel/nuts present, finishes dry and crisp ; a dry, light bodied beer, a bit thicker and ""wetter"" than most dunkels, decent co2 level ; a quaffable brew and a decent dunkel, i'm certain to have this again..."
"Poured a dark, dark brown with a thin head. Seemed to be a pretty standard German dunkel, with the taste and smell having substantial malt with overtones of mild hops. Seemed pretty medium-bodied for being such a dark beer and went down smooth. Went great with my tacos for dinner!"
"I do not recommend this beer."
"Obviously a German beer, this poured a clear dark brown with a nice head. It smelled malty with wild hops. It had a sweet malt and cream flavor with some hops in the aftertaste, although it wasn't very bitter. The texture was fairly thin with lots of carbonation. Overall it was pretty enjoyable and easy to drink. I like the dunkel!"
"It's a funny root-beer color that I can't say is brown, amber or reddish, but a strange triangulation of those colors. Mostly white head. Aroma of mild toffee and bread-like caramel notes. The flavor is quite similar but has a sweet malt note that is cut short by just the minimum amount of hops to balance it out. The finish barely manages to become dry and the body is medium. I took a bite of a mildly spiced delicate pork sausage with mustard, some onions, peppers, and cabbage, and pumpernickel bread, then took another swallow of the beer and it suddenly came alive. Some beers can seem so-so until you find the right food to activate it."
"Pours a clear ruby tinged caramel color with plentiful off-white head; decent tracing to boot. Aroma is a rush of malty sweetness, reminiscent of toasted bread, ginger ale, a bit of light caramel and a slight nuttiness. On the palate, the malts continue to come through with their slight toastiness, quite sweet indeed. Only a moderate caramel like amount of toasted flavor pervades, with a strong nuttiness in the background. Barely to no hop bitterness comes through in the finish. This is a style I don't plan on visiting again as I see the malt level close to cloying and one-dimensional."
"D - Very good, this is an easy drinker and a pretty tasty one at that. I'll have to look for some bottles later, but for now I'm just going to enjoy a few pints of this on draught. If you see this one, don't hesitate."
"Not very complex, but extremely drinkable. A nice alternative to a typical light lager. I think this would be great for washing down some kraut and Knockworst."
"A great import and something German beer fans should love. Probably the closest any import has come to capturing the flavors of Munich."
"Drinkability- Pretty good. Not great."
"D: Very drinkable, no alcohol shows through. Very satisfying. The carbonation doesn't fill you up, even with a big sandwich."
"3 12 oz bottles poured into my Paulaner liter mug. Nice dark brown/violet hue. Big light tan head that recedes quickly. Smells of sweet malts a bit of apple. It's clean no skunk, (a big plus coming from green bottles). Tastes of toasty malts, green apple, minimal hops. Very clean, crisp and refreshing. It hits the spot... especially a liter at a time!"
"Opinion: This is a great beer, and one tha I like to drink pretty much as often as I find it. I am actually surprised that I haven't reviewed it until now because I drink it frequently...since it became available in Texas. I would recommend that you give this beer a shot if you want to know what a quality German session beer tastes like. Plenty of everything to make it a great experience to drink. Prost!"
"Drinkabilty: A nice tasting beer. Saved the day after tasting a not so good Witbier."
"Pours out kind of a dark maple syrup with no real bubble activity found. Head is rather thin and doesn't leave any lace. Aroma is malty, worty, with caramel, bread, nuts, and honey. Hops are very floral and tea-like. Beer starts off with some toasty and faintly roasty malt flavors along with sweet bread. The end bring on the floral hops and a punch of bitterness that is welcome. Dries up a tad in the finish but still a bit sweet. Mouthfeel is not necessarily light but does not lean towards the middle either. Feels in between the two. Carbonation is nice as it pricks the tongue. This beer is pretty good, but the sweet presence gets a bit much for me."
"A great beer from Hofbrauhaus. Nicely balanced, and well made. It's hard to find a flaw in this one, and it packs a good deal of flavor into a beer that is fairly light. I think this is the best of the Hofbrau beers that are available here, and is definitely worth a try. I know I'll be buying another six pack...."
"With the first sip, I could taste the roasted malts, but that was it. After the first sip, it was really nothing special. In fact, it sort of boring. Not impressed with this dunkel ale. I'm really disappointed, I expected much more!"
"This one is an old standby. It doesn't pour a particularly good head, the smell is a little on the skunky side, but that has been characteristic of all the Hofbrau brews. As one reviewer mentioned, the beer does smell a little like wort. The taste is a little on the caramel side, malty, a little nut or almond flavor, a little watery, a little tinny as well. The hops come through in the finish. The caramel taste is a bit more pronounced as the beer warms a bit. This is a fairly tasty beer, a little dry in parts, not the best Dunkel by a long shot, in part because it is a little thin and watery, and the metal in the finish is a bit much. I would come back to this again as more of a 6 pack type of beer to have around in the frig, as opposed to something special or of noteworthy merit. L'Chaim"
"A amgnificent example of the style, so pass the bread pudding..."
"Got this on-tap at one of Cleveland's best German restaurants, Der Braumeister. It came to me in what I believe was a big and thick 16 oz. or bigger official Hofbräu mug. The perfect glass for this beer. They also served it at the right temperature too. It wasn't too cold where I had to let it warm up or it wasn't too warm in where the beer burned my upper lip. Just the right temp. The beer was a dark mahogany with cherry red highlights all through out the beer. The head of foam on my glass was about a 1 finger and it was a dirty white color. Not a pure white color and it wasn't tan colored either. The smell was that of dark roasted malts, hint of chocolate, sweet caramel, and a trace of bitter hops at the end. Dark roasted malts came sweeping in the beginning and then gave way to sweet caramel and a hint of bitter hops at the end. Basically it tasted like it smelled, except for the fact that I really couldn't taste any chocolate. It was medium bodied and with a smooth aftertaste of roasted malts with no alcohol in sight. I could see why people at Oktoberfest might drink liters of this kind of beer. That's because there is plenty of good flavor and is easy to drink. I don't know about you, but I know I could easily drink another 16 oz. mug of this beer. Not the most flavorful beer, but it is another great German session beer."
"12 oz. bottle- color of clear dark brown , with a medium head  nose of salt , malts , soy sauce , barnyard , and cocoa  taste of malts , baking chocolate , and mild hopps - body medium , medium carbonation , and acidic  aftertaste of sour , and acidic long lasting"
"Poured a deep brown color, which reminds me of a Coke after the ice cubes have melted. Had a decent off-white head that dissipated to almost nothing but left some lacing. The smell is of roasted malt, slightly chocolate. Taste is quite similar to the Munich lager, the roasted malt doesn't really come through. It has a fizzy light mouthfeel, it leaves just a little bitter twang at the end. It's a very drinkable beer, just not something I am overally impressed with. It's a good beer to get people to drink a 'dark' beer."
"12 oz. green bottle with some code. It pours into the pilsner glass a crystal-clear dark amber with light to medium carbonation and an inch of tan head. The aroma consists of roasted malts and spicy/grassy hops. On the palate, it's roasted, lightly toasted, and almost smoky malts, spicy/grassy, green, lightly skunky hops, and a medium bitterness. It is a little bit raw in the aftertaste, and there is some heat from the prickly alcohol presence. The body is medium and lightly tingly, and leaves a medium finish. Overall a pretty decent dunkel that is easy enough to drink, but perhaps a bit unrefined due to the prickly alcohol."
"Pours a classic Munich dunkel color: deep brown with a very dark center and ruby edges. No head to speak of. Aroma is all roasty, toasty malts, with some nice caramel backing but little else. On the palate, things are just a bit one-dimensional and flat. The roasted elements of the malt come out and stay out, but they are not joined by any spice, smoke, or fruit. Mouthfeel is a tad watery. Overall, this beer is certainly drinkable, but it's not terribly interesting or refined."
"A message for the other Hofbrau drinkers : Try this beer and you'll go back to Vegas or Kentucky and let the other guys know that their beer doesn't hold a candle to the German version!"
"I had this brew opured from tap at Tank's Taproom in Tampa Fl (the third tap from the left). I poured about one and a half finger of head with fair retention. The lacing was thin but apparent. The color was a dark brown yet transparent. Its aroma and taste were both malty, yet the smell was more mild than the taste. It went down smooth. Don't drink and review."
"Presentation: Packaged in a green glass euro-style glass long neck with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Overall Impression: Great nose, but the body doesnt back it up. A solid beer, well crafted, but needs a little more oomph, more malt I suspect. Not a bad beer by any means, a decent fall sipper or session, but I doubt Ill be back this way for a while."
"Transparent mohagany amberish color with a nice medium creamy tan head. Not too much lacing. A toasty grainy aroma with a touch of chocolate and caramel lying underneath. Flavor begins with a cereal grain toasty flavor which controls the beer. Some nutty and caramel characteristics come out but they're a touch weaker. A bit of bitter chocolate. Lightly earthy and dry in finish. A bit of some residual sugar stays. Smoth with a nice combination of roast flavor, malty flavors, and sweet to bitter balance. Maybe a touch more body and a bit more hop flavor but really, this is quite enjoyable. Very quaffable on tap."
"It poured a deep molasses color with almost no head. Disappointment, but the color was nice. I picked up aromas of sweet malt. Flavors of malt and touches of nuts and coffee. The body was to thin and wet for my liking. Drinkable, but I would probably only have one and move on."
"Overall, an OK beer, but not something I would seek out again."
"This was a real treat. It was just a touch on the sweet side, but still true to the style. Enjoyable, quite drinkable, and for sure sessionable."
"A linger of roast, heavy toast, and bitter nut oils linger past the finish and the earthy hop flavor allows for a smooth transition into the next drink. All making this a clean and melanoidin rich Dunkel that shares a lot in common with traditional German Bockbiers."
"Again: solid. I know some beer novices who turn their nose up at any dark beer, but I don't see how anyone could not enjoy this one for its simplicity and comforting goodness."
"Had this at the Hofbrauhause in Munich. Presentation in a liter stein is enough to warrant an exceptional appearance score alone, add to that a great brown color and frothy head and you have a winner. The smell was subtle, I could find the roasted malt only because I was looking for it, but a general smell of freshness is most prevalent. Taste is classic. Exactly what I would expect from this beer. The flavor is not over the top at any point, exceptional balance between the roasted malt flavor and small amount of hops. This beer is not trying to grab your attention; it's a classic case of less is more. This is one beer everyone should have on tap to understand the style and intention of the beer. In the US there is a mentality that every beer has to try to ""out do"" the competition and grab our attention. Thats not the case here; you will actually be wowed at the fact of how a simple beer can be so great. Mouthfeel is smooth and watery, refreshing and light. And drinkability is insane, to be served in a liter stein this thing has to be drinkable and that it is."
"The mouth may be a trifle thin, but it isnt really that much of a flaw as this is extremely easy to drink. It is also one of those beers that goes great with food."
"On draught at Hofbräuhaus Las Vegas. Dark reddish brown color with a thick and rocky cream colored head. Thin lacing. The aroma is lightly roasty and malty. Medium-bodied and sweet with roasted malt and caramel flavoring. The finish is nutty and lingeringly sweet. A decent beer to accompany a bratwurst."
"Give it a try if you get the chance."
"I can say I'm not really impressed with this beer. Paid $6.50 for a half liter stein at the Hofbrauhaus Las Vegas. The place was fun, service okay, the menu good, and location wasn't too bad--see my beerfly review for info. Poured a bit too cold, with thin lacing and little carbonation. Nothing overwhelming in regards to scent. Easy enough to drink but I had no qualms about leaving before I enjoyed another."
"Drinkability  This one was clean and crisp with a nice lagered feel and did the style justice."
"Mouthfeel was smooth with a clean aftertaste. Medium bodied with mild carbonation. This brew was extremely drinkable as the malt levels were stronger than expected but you didn't get any sense this was filling you up."
"This dunkel lager poured a clear, dark brown (light coffee) color with creamy, light tan foam that persisted and clung to the glass. The smell was bready and malty with a slight sweetness and a touch of caramel. The taste was slightly sweet and malty with a bit of bread, some caramel, and a touch of cocoa. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium body and good carbonation and a nice ""malty feel"". This was a good lager, and very easy to drink."
"Color was a deep tree bark brown with a creamy off white/beige head. Aroma was somewhat subdued but but offered notes of darkened malts and chicory wood? Flavor is somewhat weaker than expected. Nevertheless notes of rough dark malts with a peppery aftertaste make themselves apparent. Body is surprisingly light and watery but very thirst quenching."

"Shiny, rich, burgundy, chestnut color. Nice foamy tall beige bubbly head. Very inviting aroama of sweet carmel toffee, and toasted malt. Taste is a supersmooth carmel toasted sweetness. Very rich and creamy balanced flavors. Sweet malty goodness is present, but not overdone and slick like some dark lagers. Balanced light to medium bodied, still very drinkable. This was very fresh tasting and delicious to the end. If I still lived in Cincinnati, this would be the perfect Sunday evening pairing with Montgomery Inn Ribs. Just need to smuggle the ribs in or the beer out."
"Dark copper-chestnut color, topped by a light tan head. Aroma of sweet caramel and roasted malts. The taste has a mild sweetness surrounded by nice roasted malt background. Good caramel flavors with a touch of what I would swear is chocolate, followed by a crisp finish. Lingering bitterness on the aftertaste eventually gives way to just an ever so faint sweetness. Mouthfeel is very solid. Drinakbility is excellent. Amazingly fresh. Even my grandmother and mom liked this offering. Perhaps the best dark lager I've tried. Outstanding."
"Had this beer at the famed Hofbrauhaus in Munich.. Dark roasty chocolate with a lasting head in a Liter mug. Smooth and malty with a deep brown hue and excellent mouthfeel.. highly drinkable and thirst quenching.. smell is of chocolate and roasted malts .."
"This brew poured a medium head of fine to medium sized off white bubbles that left a good lacing. It had a nice malty aroma and a dark brown transparent body with a smooth initial flavor and a slight bite while finishing with a nice roasted malty flavor."
"When this brew was poured into my glass, it poured a medium sized head with fine bubbles that quickly diminished. It had a sweet taste to it in my opinion. The hue of this brew was almost a dark brown color. I was unfortunately not very impressed with this particular brew as it seemed to lack some character."
"This beer comes with a nice ivory head that creates a nice contrast to the dark reddish brown of the body. The nose is mostly of a robust malt scent with slightly caramel accents. It gives off much sweetness when first sampled, but moderates against a mildly bitter sense in the finish. It is full-bodied and leaves a pleasant aftertaste on the palate."
"Very drinkable and was rather yummy with a piece of the Black Forest cake (so high it is balanced partially with a fork against the plate)."
"I'm not much of a lager man, really, aside from various bock beers. But I'd definitely drink this again."
