"One of the good ones from Mexico, not the best but not bad at all."

"Watery and flat. More of an ordinary American adjunct lager than anything else."

"Mild aroma of malt with slight corn/vegetables. Balanced flavor with a bit of caramel. No hop aroma or flavor, only enough neutral bitter to balance the sweet background. Moderately low body. Finishes clean. Good beer with chilled spiced shrimp or chips and salsa. I'd buy it again."

"O: Good flavors, clean and refreshing. Very easy to finish. Considerably more flavor than much of the standard 'light lagers' in Mexico, so it's an option for anyone looking to go beyond Corona, Dos Equis, Tecate and the like... pretty well done for the 'Dunkel Lager' style."

"Overall, I'd say that this is a beer I wish they'd import to the US. It's certainly better than Negra Modelo, much more superior to Corona, and a whole host of Mexican beers--which are usually not too impressive to begin with."
"Overall: granted that any Mexican beer is in its element when sipped in high heat with the surf pounding in the background, this beer is still objectively tasty and highly drinkable. I forsee myself having a lot more of this."

"This beer was OK. It was very drinkable but not great. Something called Negra I was expecting a fuller taste. Other than my expectations, it was very smooth, and would be good for a casual drinker. It was very similar to Corona, but a little more malty."

"Pours a clear almost amber color with a smallish bubbly white head that dissipates quickly and leaves minimal lace. Wow there is something in the aroma here other than corn and hops! Darker malts may actually be present here. Sweet malty aroma gives some hints of caramel, and lightly toasted bread. Taste is malty and a little sweet with hints of caramel and cocoa. Very little if any hops are found in this brew. Light body, heavy level of carbonation, syrupy/watery mouthfeel. One of the better Mexican beers."

"This one is like your usual mexican beer with some drops of a colour agent, just to change its colour,nothing else. Really disappointed with this one, I was expecting much more taste."
"O - Overall a bit of a disappointment, as I was expecting something a bit more flavourful given the strong recommendation by our server. Nonetheless, a drinkable ale and good for a hot summer day."

"Probably the best surprise among the Mexican beers I've tried. I like it, and given the choices available here (only beers from Mexico's big 2), I'd pick it over everything else."

"Murky brown color with little lacing. Aroma is faint with only a hint of phenols and toasted malts. Slightly skunky as well. The most prominent flavor is the carbonation as evything else is so weak. Moderate amounts of ripened banana and toasted barley. Metallic, with a touch of DMS. Body is thinned, fortunately the carbonation keeps any vegetal off-notes from lingering. Maybe the bottle I had was frayed than the can, but there was a skunkiness all the way through this one that was not too good."
"T: some sweet notes, crispy on tongue, a very tiny toast flavour, there is no end at all, is a very simple beer on the style"
"Overall - This might be one of the best beers available if you're in Mexico. Visit for the cheap tequila, not the brew."
"Overall a decent adjunct lager - certainly not the worst in Mexico - but does not compare favourably to other beers of the ""Munich Dunkel Lager"" or Kellerbier style."
"León must be somewhat unusual for Mexican beer drinkers accustomed to yellow lagers (and a real treat for those who know there's more to beer than just that). That said, the Germans would likely deem it insipid and irreverent, and rightfully so considering the relative high quality, integrity and overall standard of their inveterate breweries."
"D: This beer is an interesting one for me. The color and the aroma don't match up too well. I was expecting more of a roasty aroma. This beer is very drinkable, especially at 4.5% ABV. Luckily, this beer was a gift from a buddy of mine who visited Cancun. Overall, a decent beer that will push me to try more dunkel lagers..."
"My second beer I drank from the bottle, rather than a glass, and the experience was more pleasant."
"M/D: Thin bodied with lots of carbonation. A better option than most of the more popular Mexican beers widely available."
"Drinkability - This one won't knock your socks off but is good enough to session."
"D: Very much so if you are in Mexico get some Leon."
"Pours a clear almost amber color with a smallish bubbly white head that dissipates quickly and leaves minimal lace. Wow there is something in the aroma here other than corn and dms! Darker malts may actually be present here. Sweet malty aroma gives some hints of caramel, and lightly toasted bread. Taste is malty and a little sweet with hints of caramel and cocoa. Very little if any hops are found in this brew. Light body, heavy level of carbonation, syrupy/watery mouthfeel. I think I enjoyed this most out of all the light lagers I had on my trip. Or maybe it was the searing heat and the thirst I worked up climbing around the ruins for half the day. This is definitely not a Munich Dunkel, but I enjoyed several of these before sailing away."
"it was nice too see something a little different to drink in cozumel. amber color, clear, with a minimal off-white diminishing head. some light caramel in the nose and taste. doesn't look like an adjunct beer but you can tell by drinking it. not much hop character to speak of. light bodied. frothy mouthfeel."
"Look: Dark brown color, bare head of foam with white burrs; Smell: Grain, roasted malt and toffee; Taste: Roasted malt, toffee, balanced with resiny hops; Mouthfeel: Refreshing, medium bitterness, high carbonation and medium body; Drinkability: Acceptable in all respects, the junior version of Negra Modelo, but the presentation is very bad."
"drinkability is good. for an amber lager this is well done to an extent, but nothing to seek out. amber lagers are usually hit or miss, but this falls between the two. worth a shot."
"Overall, really good compared to its cousins, but still pretty boring."
"Overall, very drinkable, sessionable, refreshing. Not a great beer, but decent for the right setting/occasion."
"drinkability: smooth, very easy"
"Overall: Bland and unexciting. It doesn't taste skunked, maybe a bit stale but not sure as the smell was fairly good compared to the rest. Maybe best enjoyed under a tropical sun."
"Taste: Little bit of skunk. Bitter finish. Easily drinkable. Good alternative to Corona if you're ever in Mexico."
"Overly rich and underly complex compared to a Negra Modelo for example."
"Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied, smooth, gently spiced with hops, and easy drinking."
"Easy to drink, super light mouthfeel. For beer found in Mexico, it's not bad."
"But bottom line, I had to search out & reached for this quite a few more times than the easily available Coronas."
"This is supposed to be a Munich style beer. Maybe so, but I doubt it. Still, it was one of the more enjoyable beers I had on a recent trip to Mexico. It was amber in color with a small head. It had a malty, sweet aroma. A caramel taste with some warmth to it. I thought it had a little substance, and would drink it again."
"Not a bad mexican beer, but I really have trouble distinguishing this from Modelo's Victoria, a supposed Vienna lager. Whatever, it's not bad and you can drink it on the beach. Overall a so-so lager. The flavor had its ups and downs with a licorice and light dry cocoa flavor. Worth seeking out if in Mexico, otherwise don't bother."
"Like Montejo, try it with some Cochinita and Frijoles con Puerco."
"The Leon pours to a brown/rust color with some red highlights. Has a small to medium head that breaks down quite rapidly leaving some lacing down the side of the glass but not much, thin wisps. Has a nice aroma to it, probably the nicest smelling Mexican brew I have had to date, has a nice malt scent with no real hop aroma. Malt dominates the taste, with a very rich malt flavor that might be accentuated by the warm weather. Can notice a little hop taste along with the carbonation, which gives it a slight bite at most. Also notice a slight metallic taste, but it is hard to pick up. Overall this is my favorite Mexican brew that I have had, has some character which made it feel like you where not drinking carbonated water and was still light enough to drink while in the warm weather. I have not seen this back home but will have to see if I can track it down while at out local Mexican restaurants."
"¡Salud!"
"This is an OK dark lager, but a little on the sweet side for me. Negra Modelo is a far more balanced Mexican dark lager."
"a full bodied beer , munich dunkel lager style, its beer style in this site is wrong, is not a marzen oktoberfest; special beer for a southeastern mexican food, like a cochinita pibil, motulenian eggs, papadzules, etc; its appearance in light dark made this beer one of my favorites from Grupo Modelo; drinkability is over the average, try with german cuisine; 95% recommended."
"Probably one of my best beers here. The lager is in, but with a different taste. Montejo and Leon are brewed in another state of Mexico, that makes them different, and without any doubt, the original owners were a little more interested in fine beers."
"Much better than the standard Mexican fare, but still a disappointing beer and a disgrace to the Octoberfest style."
"I can have some more, especially with some spicy and hot Yucatán food."
"Pours an ivory head settling over clear medium amber liquid. Sweet malty nose with a hint of caramel. Malty sweetness carries thru on the palate, sort of in the Vienna or Marzen style...sweet, with a light toasted background. Finishes subtly bittersweet as it warms up. Not the worst Mex beer I've drank."
"Consumed in October 2004 in Cancun, Mexico from a bottle. Pours a light amber-copper color, kinda like a weak iced tea color. Smells of bad cough syrup and tastes pretty much the same way. Maybe a bitter hop or two. Watery like the rest. Decent carbonation, maybe a tinge of sweetness, but really dry at the end. A bad name and a bad beer IMO."
"All in all not a bad drink. It just could be more assertive."
"This was the ""dark"" beer at the all inclusive at Playa Del Carmin. I drank plenty of them. Some were VERY good and rivaled Negra Modela. Others were VERY bad. The good ones were dark amber with a fairly good off white head. The aroma was very mild but I could detect some malt. The taste was of malt and the moutfeel was moderate. These were nice drinking at the cabana on the beach watching topless sunbathers. The bad ones had a off, sour smell and a taste to match. After a couple of these, I would give up beer for a few hours and was forced to drink taquilla and watch the topless sunbathers."
"This Mexican ""Munich Style"" Lager really is reminiscent of the Vienna Style. The rich amber color is a pleasant sight. The malty body is smooth and rounded. Could use more hops and the aroma is on the mild side. IMHO, this Leon the best Mexican beer available, including Negra Modela. A well crafted satisfying brew!"
