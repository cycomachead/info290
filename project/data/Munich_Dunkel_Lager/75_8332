The most prominent flavor is the carbonation as evything else is so weak. Moderate amounts of ripened banana and toasted barley. Metallic, with a touch of DMS. Body is thinned, fortunately the carbonation keeps any vegetal off-notes from lingering. Maybe the bottle I had was frayed than the can, but there was a skunkiness all the way through this one that was not too good.","BretSikkink","Jul 06, 2011"

3.68,16.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The Leon pours to a brown/rust color with some red highlights. Has a small to medium head that breaks down quite rapidly leaving some lacing down the side of the glass but not much, thin wisps. Has a nice aroma to it, probably the nicest smelling Mexican brew I have had to date, has a nice malt scent with no real hop aroma. Malt dominates the taste, with a very rich malt flavor that might be accentuated by the warm weather. Can notice a little hop taste along with the carbonation, which gives it a slight bite at most. Also notice a slight metallic taste, but it is hard to pick up. Overall this is my favorite Mexican brew that I have had, has some character which made it feel like you where not drinking carbonated water and was still light enough to drink while in the warm weather. I have not seen this back home but will have to see if I can track it down while at out local Mexican restaurants.","Stimack","Jan 09, 2006"

The good ones were dark amber with a fairly good off white head. The aroma was very mild but I could detect some malt. The taste was of malt and the moutfeel was moderate. These were nice drinking at the cabana on the beach watching topless sunbathers. The bad ones had a off, sour smell and a taste to match. After a couple of these, I would give up beer for a few hours and was forced to drink taquilla and watch the topless sunbathers.","LarryKemp","0"
