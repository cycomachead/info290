"Cheap but OK on a sunny day"
""
""

"A respectable, decent tasting brew. I generally find it offered at most Mexican restaurants and becomes my go-to brew for such occasions. It offers enough roasted grain character and warmth with a complementary hop bitterness to make it stand out over most commonly offered Mexican brewery offerings."
""
"Pours a dark,brown, clear color with a very small foamy head from a tap.  Head retention and lacing are minimal at best.  Dark malty aroma.  Hints of nuts and caramel (maybe).  Slightly sweet taste with heavier malts, nutty and slight caramel.  Not much of a hoppy bitterness.  It is a good beer to try if you are looking to go from crap to craft, but not a beer craft lovers would consistently buy.  Maybe as a cheaper beer to bring to parties instead of the mass produced adjuvant lagers."
"OK, not a winner. But I try to represent in every style. As far as Mexican macros (is there a Mexican anything else? Sincerely, let me know!) it's better than Pacifico, Corona, etc. Be at the beach or you'll be disappointed"
"The closer to light, the redder, the further from light, the browner. Transparent for the color. Light gray-brown head which quickly turns to a film, lasts awhile longer before completely disappearing. Smell is nutty and sweet. Also it is just barely estery. Judging from this it is perhaps a little old, but still tastes the same as always to me; good; very much of caramel and malt, faintly woody, chocolatey, alcoholic and perhaps a hint of black cherry (I'm serious, took me a while to figure out what it was). Mildly bitter throughout. Well balanced, highly carbonated, medium to full bodied. Lightly coats the teeth. Finish is at first wet and then warming. As refreshing as a pilsner, as comforting as an ale."

"From the bottle in a glass. Pours a reddish-brown with a nice head that lasts. Smells of roasted nuts and chocolate. Tastes sweet and then bitter in a good balance like the aroma. Full bodied feel and slightly bitter going down. Overall my go-to beer in a Mexican restaurant."
"It's a great dark beer.  Nice and full bodied.  My go to dark beer in the summer"
""
"Tasted like a beer sprite. It was very sweet but have to say refreshing on a warm day at a friends home. It was free and will drink again if it is free but probably will never buy."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not the best beer I have tasted, but it is an excellent beer that is smooth and tasty. It's far better than Corona and most American brews."
""
""
""
"O- After drinking Corona, Dos Equis, Superior Rubia, etc., it was awesome to find a Mexican beer that didn't taste like corn and/or urine. Definitely getting this one again, although it is a tad on the heavier side and is quite filling."
"Bomb with some fajitas for sure"
""
"Sweet flavor with a dry finish. This bitterness is hidden unless you go looking for it. This goes down easy and is very refreshing exactly what a dunkel should be. The aroma is faint and of roasted malts. It could benefit from more flavor in general. A more flavorful version of this would be a world class beer. The low level of carbonation makes it extremely easy to drink."
""
""
""
"not the worst of its kind..  but it's mediocre at best..."
""
"One of my favorite beers to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- An excellent beer for drinking with food."
""
"Bottle of negra modelo drank."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a good mexican beer, I prefer Bohemia, but Negra Modelo is quite good when you can´t find bohemia."
""
""
""
"I need to add salt for my preference.  Many will nog"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I may have enjoyed it more in a 12oz serving. Getting through 16oz of all those malted malty malts was challenging. It gave me a hop craving."
"Not really what I was hoping to pair with my burrito... I need a darker and less watered down beer."
""
""
"Disclaimer: I'm drinking this in Mexico so maybe that makes a difference? Roasty character with a good body. Goes well with most foods. A great alternative to all the ""clear beers."" For the price, not sure how you can ask more from a beer out of Mexico but beer snobs will be beer snobs and people on this site still don't rate to style, comparing everything to the best ""big beers"" they've had."

"DATE TASTED: January 31, 2015... GLASSWARE: Warsteiner pokal... OCCASION: Penn State in its annual b-ball battle with Illinois... APPEARANCE: confident amber bronze body; fizzy white head settles to a thin yet creamy quarter-inch; mild effervescence... AROMA: biscuit and toasted bread; that toasted scent suggests roasted nuts and coffee beans... PALATE: slightly crunchy, but reasonably light despite its color; slick at the finish...TASTE: at odds with itself: caramel, toffee and earthy notes vie with cloying, gummy esters that leave a rather funky malt finish...OVERALL: better than its Especial, this provides a profile of sorts in a style normally relegated to pizza support--but the overt malt presence is marred by some plasticine irregularities..."
"Excellent dark lager with a substantial malt profile."

"It's ok, don't see me buying this. Will drink it if nothing else is around."

"Served in a Negra Modelo bottle with a lime wedged in the neck.  I got this at my local Tex Mex joint, craving a change from the Dos Equis I usually drink while I'm there.  I wasn't expecting too much from this, especially given the reviews here, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It has a nice, sultry bronze color with a small, fleeting head.  The aroma is muted, but I definitely detect a rich maltiness.  The taste was actually more complex than I figured it to be, and there's a definite bite of alcohol that hits you with the carbonation on the tongue.  When compared to other Mexican beers, this is definitely at the front of the line.  Overall, not bad!  I'd certainly get it again."

"Great taste, smoothnes. Good aroma and aftertaste"

"A stout right unpretentious but totally dispensable"
""
"Nice taste. Always good beer"
""

"This beer is bullshit. It's better than Dos Equis, but jesus christ. Family of mine drink this and consider it good, so I thought it was worth a try...I was wrong. This and Dos Equis are enough to make me avoid Mexican beer like the plague. I love Mexican tequilas, mezcals, pretty much anything Mexican, but what the fuck is up with their beers?! It's got a weird taste; bitter but with no pungency. It tastes kind of like dirty pool water with alcohol and carbonation in it. I want to like it for convenience's sake, but my god. I have rarely been this disappointed by a beer. Fuck this; don't purchase."
"This beer is not very good"
""
""
""
""
""
"As the name suggests, it's a dark beer.  It's not heavy, and it doesn't have an overpowering taste, perfect for cooling down after climbing Teotihuacan or taking in the sights on a hot August Mexico City afternoon."
""
""
""
""
"Carbonation is just enough and the finish is semi dry and refreshing. Overall I am enjoying this brew and would have it again. Bottle date indicates it was brewed on Aug. 2, 2014."
""
"Malty and refreshing. Definitely worth a try."

"EDIT: Having one in the privacy of my own home right now.  I notice now that the smell has a bit of an almost coffee-like roastiness to it, which occasionally shows up in the taste just a bit (blending in with the ""dark bread"" sort of flavor, mostly.)  I'm finding that I really like the mouthfeel on this one when drinking some when it still has a bit of the foam on top, but it becomes a bit less smooth afterward.  Also finding that the color of this beer and how clear it is makes it look *really* nice when you've got decent lighting.  Fiddled with reviews just a bit to reflect my thoughts... guessing the score probably went up just a tad."
""
""
""
"Overall: light and easy drinking, I'm sure this will pair well with carb-heavy, spicy Mexican food."

"Overall this is a fine Mexican/Latin beer. I have not tried the Modelo Amber Ale yet, but I'd say the darker side of Modelo is the way to go. The flavors are easy to pull out and are not too over the top. Fine beer. It's simple. But that more my problem with the beer rather than that making the beer bad."

"Sweet honey aroma along with a nutty toastiness. Pours very deep amber with a white head. It's very easy drinking with high carbonation and a somewhat sticky mouthfeel. To the taste there is caramel, some toffee, toast and sweet malts. Does some different things to differentiate itself as a lager and I liked that. Decent stuff."

"One of the better Mexican beers. If you want to start drinking some Mexican beers, this one would be one of the first ones I would try. There is obviously better Mexican beers out there, but they are harder to get your hands on."
"Overall (3.84) : I would certainly have this again. I'm not going to rush out and buy a pallet of it, but if someone offered it to me I'd gladly drink it. It has a great yeasty body with nice fruity notes and heavy bread crust at the end. I like the bread and the yeast. A yeast/wheat flavor remains on the palate long after the swallow. A decent beer, worthy of a taste."

"This amounts to a guilty pleasure for me – my first choice with Mexican food. It has a decent appearance, a pleasant taste, and a pleasing palate. Overall, a decent cheap beer which pairs well with Mexican food."
""
""
""
"Overall: This was my first Mexican beer, and so far so good. I've heard that some of Grupo Modelo's other offerings have a less than savoury reputation, so I guess I picked a good place to start. A very solid drink."

"Having been away from beer for a long while I wanted to get back to drinking. I used to be a light beer drinker before  so I wanted to try something new and by chance, and curiosity I ordered a negra modelo. ..wow! what a joy it was drinking that first bottle. When ever I can't find it I try other darks  only to be left disappointed. Thanks to the Brewers of this fine beer I now have found my afternoon companion."

"Overall: This is probably the best Mexican beer I've had to date, and is easily one I would get again to serve with tacos, enchiladas, or other authentic Mexican food. Not half bad for an easy drinking Mexican lager, and something I would definitely buy at a Mexican restaurant again. Much better than Corona."

"On-tap at Jose’s Blue Sombrero in Waukesha , WI. This pours a brownish amber color with a light beige head. Since it was served with a lime wedge, that’s all I can smell. Texture is light and thin, a very mild taste of grain. Like most Mexican beers, thin and watery."

"O-Epitome of a brew you love at the beginning of your beer drinking journey, then realize later down the road is not as good as you thought. I wouldn't buy this beer again. Modelo Especial is more pleasing in taste and more refreshing. The dark lager flavors of caramel-dark bread are present for a few minutes, then just dilute and turn metallic, sour and bitter. Best paired with Mexican food if you had to drink."
"Negra Modelo is very easy to drink and reminds me a lot of malta. Negra Modelo has a light feel in your mouth. While I bought a six pack I drank each beer out of a snifter glass. It's a decent light lager that's dark in color. It as a malty smell and taste to it."

"This is my go-to beer at any Mexican restaurant. I love how this beer is both dark and malty and yet also quite light. The carbonation balances out the dark malts perfectly. It is crisp and easy to drink, but with a pleasant toastiness. Also interesting how this beer is almost single-handedly keeping alive the ""Vienna lager"" style. All in all, a great beer."

"I went into this not knowing what to expect, as most Mexican beers are fairly forgettable, but I was pleasantly surprised by this one. It is a well done, easy drinking lager with a pleasant flavor profile."
""
"Diacetyl bomb, but flavorful malt character. It's on the sweet side, and the nutty notes make it appealing."
""
""
""
"I'm 1,300 reviews in, and this is my first Mexican beer. Beers like this substantiate why."
"Pored from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours semi transparent reddish amber with a small head that dissipates quickly. Smells of smells of some decent grain, a little fruitiness. Tastes of some fruitiness with caramelized grain, very nice. Beer is light bodied a tad heavily carbonated but it is very drinkable. Overall a good beer."
"O: Cleaner and tastier than your average macro lager."
""
""
""
"Surprisingly not bad and a _lot_ better as it warms. We wouldn't buy it but we'd certainly drink it over a lot of other things we've tasted."

"First off, there is absolutely no good reason to put a lime wedge into a darker lager beer. For the purpose of this review enjoyed a bottle at a Mexican restaurant after said lime was extracted from the bottle neck. This is my favorite widely available beer down in Mexico and I will drink it here too should the occasion arise (Bavaria is another really good dark Mexican lager albeit harder to find at restaurants and bars). This brew is light brown, looking like iced tea or watery cola, with a decent amount of off-white to light tan head that will keep its shape for a bit provided you don't kill it off with lime juice. This beer is also served ice-cold pretty much anywhere you order it ... The initially weak aroma and flavors will develop if the beer is allowed to warm up a bit. Nose and palate jive quite nicely, amber and dark malts providing a mellow brown sugar backdrop with hints of raisin and roasted barley, along with vanilla-esque floral notes and some hops that recall sweet hay. The beer is highly carbonated and quite thin as one might expect, but well worth the attention that you probably wouldn't pay to a Corona or Sol. Malt forward but not aggressive and the mouthfeel is somewhat creamy. Less bold than other Munich Dunkels I've had and I think this is better classfied as a Graf-style Vienna lager. The aforementioned Bavaria is a Munich dunkel. But hey."

"Poured from a bottle into a 12 oz plastic cup at the airport. It has a lovely clear medium-brown color with no lacing or head at all. Aroma is hops, caramel, and a bit of malt. Flavor is hops, malt, caramel, mild but balanced, and tipping a bit more to the hops side, which I enjoy. Mouthfeel is a bit foamy. Overall this is a good brown lager, but I really prefer ales--porters, stouts and IPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Easy drinking beer with a lighter taste that brings a variety of light tastes but really you should throw a slice of lime in the mix and it becomes, to me, the best mass market Mexican beer out there."
"O - For Mexican beer this one is well made and balanced. Sweet and refreshing without too much bitterness. A slightly heavier mouthfeel would please me more but this beer is good as is."

"its not the best beer it has a sour taste and i always notice people spit after they drink it at the clubs. I would prefere a pabts blue ribbion or a micky instead of this. it taste ok when lime is added but other then that it has a bull flavor. If anything i would consider this as a last minute beer."

"The taste has a chocolate malt flavor with a backbone of grainy malts. Light roasted nut and toasted bread flavor are also apparent. There's a lot of carbonation feel on the tongue which makes it crisp but watery. A truer taste, one without so much carbonation would be stellar but may not serve the purpose of a refreshing dark lager."

"Overall - My go to beer when out at a Mexican restaurant, though due to lack of choice more than anything. Outside that, it's a beer I tend to steer clear from, as there are significantly better dark lager choices to be had."

"Not as dark as others, but hard to find a better beer at most Tex-Mex restaurants. Smooth, minimal head, above average flavor and above all, save the lime for your food. A great accent to the Bob Armstrong Dip and the Chicken Chile Relleno at Matt's Rancho Martinez in Big D."
"This isn't a fantastic beer but its probably the best Mexican beer I've had. It's almost bereft of aroma and has a very mild taste without much character to speak of. It's fairly smooth but overall there just ain't much to remark on. It's ok for drinking with your buddies at the bar but I wouldn't order it as my first. As an aside, if you mix in a shot of vodka, it tastes like a Baltika 9."
""
""

"The taste is malty sweet with a a slight hop bite introducing itself at the end of each sip. Mild bitterness. An enjoyable beer. Probably one of the better Mexican brewed beers I have had."

"O: I've had this beer many times at Mexican restaurants. and really, it's perfect with that food, the chocolatey sweetness perfectly complements the spices. standing alone I feel it lacks complexity and body. but it is definitely drinkable and a good beer."

"Comes to the table a fairly clear medium brown color with a smallish off white head that had all but dissipated before the glass got to my table. Smells of caramel and a hint of butterscotch with a faint grainy almost bready malt in the background. Very light floral hop aroma. The flavor is mostly caramel, but it tastes fake. Moderate sweet maltiness is offset with a burnt butterscotch and faint spicy hop flavor. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet mouthfeel. Vienna lager is quite a stretch here, dark adjunct lager fits better in my mind. Nothing horrible here, but the artificial taste and lack of complexity kills this one for me."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a russet amber with a thin off-white head that dissipates quickly to a thin film and ring around the glass leaving light lacing. Aroma of sweet malt, spicy graininess. Flavor starts well, with sweet mild toasted malt, slight breadiness, hint of caramel, but ends rather abruptly with slight caramel malt and a hint of grassy hops. Light bodied. A step above other macros, but nothing exciting. Would do in a pinch if only macro beer was available."

"I'd certainly order this one with a fajita platter anytime!"

""

"The brew pours out a very nice dark-caramel color, not black like the name of the beer would lead you to believe. The head was thin, but strangely, the lacing was noticeable all the way down the bottle - I've never seen anything like it. The smell was the normal hops and barley, but the odor was just slight - just the right amount in my opinion. Mouthfeel was surprising, the dark liquid was thick and felt velvety. The taste is what I walked away with impressed - full and rich - certainly not what I was expecting, but glad I did. Overall, a solid beer (in too small a bottle) I will be glad to partake of again."

"Pours dark ruby brown with some weak etched light cream foam. Smells like cheap beer - wheat and grain, some soily yeast and a little bit of sweet malt. Tastes like a brown ale that wherein the yeast was over-taxed and has a real bad ester profile with sweet vanilla and butter flavors. Some nutty character. LIght bodied with hi carb and a semi dry finish. Not something I plan to revisit."

"Asked for an Ale in a Mexican Restaurant and received a bottle of Negra Modelo. Had tried Dos Equis and Corona - ugh, so was expecting another also-ran. Quite a surprise! Currently, I keep some on hand, since I drink in such moderation that a 6 pack lasts a month sometimes, but when I want an Ale, I always have one on hand."

"The taste of this one sort of surprised me ... this is my first beer from Mexico, and I wasn't expecting it to be very good. I thought it would taste like a macro or something. Instead, I got a respectable Mexican beer. There's really nothing about Negra Modelo that stands out, but it's inoffensive. This is worlds better than Corona (Apparently.. and unsurprisingly. As said, haven't had), and a very fair beer."

"I really like this beer considering it's price and that it is available almost anywhere. It has a nice brown coloring ,really malty smooth flavor with no bitter aftertaste. A little thicker consistency than average. My go to beer if no other darks on sale"

"Pours dark copper color with a tight inch and half of head. Looks nice. Smells malty but there is a hint of corn... which does not help. It would be great without that bit of corn. Watery taste at first, then malty (every so slightly roasted malt), finishes with a mild hop presence. Nothing too impressive. Light and crisp in the mouth. Low carbonation. Easy to drink. Overall for a dunkel lager it lacks the malt body, however for an easy drinking lager it is nice."

"Awesome. It reminds me of somewhat of newcastle brown ale. This stuff is an instant favorite. A lot of dark beers have a bad after taste to me but this one does not at all. If you like dark beers this one is a must have. I also liked the shape of the bottle, shorter and wider than normal."
""
""
""
""
""
"Had to come back and update this one then decided to review. I pored this from a bottle into a tall New Glarus glass. Looks beautiful in the light, decent head, and smells delicious. Tastes even better. A now must have for my fridge. For me this is an instant favorite! I can drink it warm, cold, bottled or in a glass. It's simple, easy to drink and really tasty. This ones for anyone, if you get a chance try it."

"Negra Modelo is a very simple beer that isn't great but isn't bad either. Many of the Mexican chain restaurants around my house serve this beer, and it compliments a burrito much better than a Corona or Dos Equis."

"Poured this Dunkel Lager from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a dark brown color, produced a tannish thick head, excellent retention and left ample lacing on the pint glass. The aroma features toasted grain, and a slight citrus hop note. Light in body, this lager features toasted grain, carmel candy sweetness and some slight hop bitterness at the finish. This is probably my favorite Mexican brewed beer thus far. Not outstanding but it's worth a try. Post!"

"Now this is just personal taste, but after awhile the light feel of the beer wears on me and I end up really wishing this was a deep, rich beer. However if you drink this while eating a burger or something, it's refreshing as hell; it begs to be paired up with some food."
""
""
""
""

"O: This beer is refreshing, easy to drink, and enjoyable. I could definitely put down a few of these in an evening and it pairs very nicely with the flavors of Mexican, Cuban, and South American food."

""
""
"Much better than I expected and better than regular Modelo, this beer pours dark (duh ... given the name). It's a black-ish red with a tiny head and minimal latticework. The smell is virtually non-existent with the alcohol ringing through. The taste, happily, is better than the smell. It has the taste of a richer, more flavorful lager, and it is also more rich and textured. I liked this beer, but I probably won't buy it."
""

"355ml bottle. (7503-1589 bar code) ½ Pint glass. Enjoyed on jul´12. Dark amber color. Chill hazy appearance. Beige, small bubbled, froth. Retention is ok but not much lacing. Sweet toasted malts, hints of brown sugar & toasted bread to the nose. Flavor profile shows toasted malts, subtle chocolate & bitterness in the middle. Grainy sensation & fizzy to the palate. Light body. Moderate to high carbonation. Dried nut astringency. Dry finish. Easy drinkability."
""
""
"I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. I usually am pretty skeptical of mass produced beer like this but I thought this was exceptional and is now one of my favorite beers. It was smooth from start to finish no bitter finish or aftertaste. I has a beautiful dark caramel color that was very appealing. It was a very surprising and enjoyable experience."

"Had this right from the bottle at a recent mexican food dinner. Nice malty aromas, some spice character. Taste is a nice malty dark lager with some chocolatey roasted flavors and some slightly hidden dried fruit notes. It still maintains the macro lager drinkability...thin and easy. Overall, one of my favorite Mexican brews and macro style lagers widely available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazy brown body with a thin head. Yeast, some caramel malts and very mild spiciness but mild for the style make up the aroma. Flavor is hard to break down but milk chocolate toffee and caramel are prevalent however not spicy enough for the style.. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Nicely smooth. Not terrible but it is what it is."
""
""
"My only complaint on this beer is that I wish it had a bigger nose. It's a little subtle but still a wonderful scent. This beer has great malt character and a smooth, easily approachable lager mouthfeel. Not too carbonated and very thirst-quenching. The robust dark malts are not as pronounced as a schwarzbier from Germany. The hops on this beer are not as Euro-bitter as other Munich Dunkels out there. Sweet carmel amber malts and clean finish make this beer delicious. Mexico's best in the U.S."

"Comes out of the tap a barely translucent copper-brown with a decent pale tan head. Malty aroma has a fruity hint (but this might have come from the obligatory slice of lime). Flavor is better than I expected, malty and strong with a firm fruity undertone - quite tasty. Texture has good body and plenty of fizz. One of the best Mexican beers I have tried."

"This beer gave me less than I was expecting. The only really nice thing is the color, smell is almost non existent. Taste is like a regular lager just with a touch of caramel here and there. Too pricey for what I get. It is not bad for a hot weather as a thirst quencher."

It's easy on the budget and I'll probably buy it again for a session beer or for a small warm weather party. It's certainly the best of the Mexican beers that I've tried. Goes great with Tex-Mex food and munchies."

"Off-tap at the Cancun airport after a wonderful vacation with my beloved Russian girlfriend this beer was a clear, copper color with one finger of off-white head. The retention of the collar was ok but there was only modest lacing. The aroma was of toasted malt, light bready notes and some dry grains. Much better than any other beer I found in Mexico and it was a welcome change already. The flavors were similarly refreshing. I tasted the bready malt, a hint of nuts, toasted grains and a clean, dry finish. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium/light and the carbonation medium. Of the widely available Mexican beers this was by far the best and it was a great way to finish my vacation."

"Negra Modelo pours a bright, reddish brown with a thing, offwhite head. The aroma is sweet, mildly dark malt, with some caramel and herbal hops. Crisp hops upfront in the flavor as well, with a nice rounded slightly raisiny maltiness. The finish is clean, with just a hint of fruitiness. Overall a very solid, drinkable beer."

"Good beer especially for price. I think it is a great one for anyone who wants to begin to explore darker beers but not quite ready to take the plunge. This is a good sampler and prep beer for flavor and color to prepare for darker beers to come. I will gladly buy this beer again and share it with my friends as well. Good job on this one!"

"Had this one at a local Mexican restaurant while caSSino was down from Charlotte visiting. Served from bottle into an Anarctic frozen mug. Poured amber with a one finger tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly (after the head thawed out of course). The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, cream, and wheat. The flavor was of sweet malt, cream, dark chocolate, wheat, and roasted malt. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was an average brew. Really nothing on this one stood out to me at all. I did like how this one had a bit of dark chocolate in it to add some character, but the wheat flavor I got here just didn't impress me at all. Got this as it was ranked as one of the best Mexican brews on the menu according to BA, but I guess I should have gone with a strawberry Margarita like caSSino chose to do..."

"Poured into a standard pint glass. The beer is a nice dark amber color. The fizzy light cream colored head dissipates to a thin film. Some patchy lacing. The beer smells of subtly roasted malts, barely. I'm a fan of Mexican lagers, and this beer is no exception. It's got a nice caramelized malty taste in it, but with a bit of adjunct corn cheapness. The mouthfeel is smooth, very drinkable. Overall, one of the better beers from down south."

"I am giving it a 3 because it’s so common. It’s good though. I will give it that."
"Overall - In short, it's an okay beer but one that makes me glad that I bought it as part of a custom six pack. I wouldn't go out of my way to try it again. It's a fairly average beer that's familiar to most of us, but at the same time there's really not alot going for it"
"O: Decent lager – very smooth and easily drinkable."
"supposedly one of the higher end mexican brews. pours a see through thin budlight color with a small head. nose is lousy, old malts, dead beer, no hops at all to speak of. taste beats the aroma, with a refreshing lighter malt flavor and a quick crisp finish. mouthfeel is alright, with some pretty high carbonation and a light body. if i was in mexico city on a 100degree day eating spicy food, it would be a good session, but on a cold fall night in the midwest with pizza, its extremely unremarkable."
"nothing worth looking for but it would make a great substitute for Mexican tap water, perhaps the best thing I've had from the country"
"I do enjoy this beer with mexican food but that is about it. I seriously doubt I would ever drink it on a regular basis. However it is probably my favorite mexican lager."
"O: This is not a great brew. But it could have been worse for just a thirst-quenching beer."
"Overall this is one of the better Mexican lagers, but still nothing to write home about. This is unfortunately much better with a lime."
"O: Seen this around forever without putting much thought to it. And you know what? It really isn't terrible. I'd put this beer ahead of many."
"Hey, it is what it is & I like it. Local grocer is running a deal too, $12 a 12pk."
"O - Not bad overall, just about average. Good choice of beer from mexican line up. I would recommend it over other mexican beers."
"Slight caramel flavor greets the tongue. Quite spritzy and makes a nice fizzy mouthful. Brownish amber in the glass. Decent head and the carbonation lasts pretty well. It tastes much like adjunct-type lagers though it does have a touch of bitterness. I wouldn't call it a hoppy taste, as there is no hint of floral flavors. Smell is not particularly pleasant, more like beer soaked into a beer mat. Aftertaste is kind of dirty and a little sour, like it has a touch of burnt malt. I used to think this was one of the better Mexican beers, but there's not much to it."
"For me this is the king of Mexican Beers. Pours a golden brown with a tan heads that thins out. Light carmelly aroma with fresh floral and earth hops. A mild carmel taste. Carbonation bubbles widely spaced throughout. Super with my red chile ground beef stuffed sopapilla."
"O - Not bad, but nothing I'd go running for"
"Not at all a bad offering. Definitely one of the better beers coming out of Mexico."
"Negra Modelo pours a medium brown color w/ a fairly thin cocoa head. Almost zero carbonation or lacing on this brew. Smell is that of weak malt, caramel, and metal. Very watered down nose on this one. Taste is the same. It's not offensive, it's just not very good. Metallic aftertaste for sure. Decent beer when you're choosing between Corona and Dos Equis, but not in real world situations. Used to be my go to beer w/ Mexican food, but now I usually stick to something w/ a little more taste. Not recommended."
"O: This isn't a very good beer, it isn't a bad one, but it sure as hell isn't a good one. I have never had a Mexican beer that I thought was awesome, but this one is most likely my favorite. Beers like this are just way too bland and generic (and expensive for what they offer) compared to the numerous amounts of quality American craft brews flooding the market."
"Overall - Rated it a 3.5, definitely will have again. Sweet, but it was balanced well inside the beer so that putting down a few wouldn't be too heavy."
"Got worse at it warmed"
"Overall / Drinkability: I've had this many times over the years, almost always with a Mexican or Southwest style meal and it has never failed to pair with it. I think I prefer it with food, but, it is very drinkable and could easily have another one right now. Not an amazing beer, and a bit weak in taste, but definitely one I know I'll have again and again when it's available."
"Overall - This was the ""best beer"" available at this restaurant, and the low sweetness and dryer characteristics of this pint made for a great pairing of the heavily flavored mole I enjoyed that evening. Not the greatest beer, but a Great pairing with my meal, and probly any full flavored mexican dish imho."
"Color is light brown/dark copper, retention is minimal and body appears thin. Aroma isn't overwhelming, light malt and caramel with slight ethanol. Caramel dominates the flavor profile. Very slight dryness in finish. Not a lot of hop flavor anywhere. I've found that this beer is much better without a glass."
"Overall this beer never fails me. Nothing fancy, just simple and pleasing."
"Close to good, and not a bad session option but far from a go-to bar beer (except in MX...)"
"The body was crisp and clean and ended up just shy of full, for the style. Drinkability was very good, the bottle went down easily and quickly. Overall, a nice little example of the style. Worth trying when you see it. This is probably my favorite of the mainstream Mexican brews, it's a decent beer."
"Had this many times. Just getting around to reviewing. Poured from the bottle at Chipotle into a plastic cup. That's all I had. Skipped the lime, thank you. Poured a medium amber with a thin layer of bubbles. Classic lager taste with a nice balance. The food wrecked my palate but overall a clean simple taste great for washing down spicy food. Funny how BMC drinkers think this is so dark..."
"A pretty good beer, would be very enjoyable with a tamale or something slightly sweet."
"12 oz bottle straight out of the bottle...have seen the color and head many times in a glass too though...probably the best Mexican mass-produced beer, but you can find better German examples of this style easily and in the same price range. Drink it if it's in a friend's fridge with a bunch of Coronas and Modelo Especials, but otherwise it's not really amazing and not a great value either. Drinkable."
"It is a decent beer, but I only recommend it for entry level lager drinkers."
"O - A good (but not great) and affordable Munich Dark. Should compliment a Mexican meal quite nicely, as I hope to soon find out."
"The choices at this restaurant were minimal, and I think this was the best choice. It was not bad for a dark lager but far from my first choice for the style."
"Pours a clear iced tea color with a 1 inch light beige head that fades to a thin film. Thick foamy rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt and grains. Taste is of toasted malt, grains, and slight caramel. There is a very slight roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth with a pretty good level of carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty good beer for what it is and one of the best beers coming out of Mexico in my opinion."
"Thin, less than half finger, head of loose larger bubbles, wastes little time all but totally evaporating, insufficient foam to leave much lacing behind, no stickiness. Deep brown hued liquid, however, crystal clear and transparent, mixes in light orange rust to yellow nearer the glass bottom. The nose is gentle and engaging, featuring caramel, toffee and corn syrup notes, honey and challah bread, brush of orange citrus and white pit fruit, low but noticeable toastiness, the hops kick it in a little late but stiffen the texture before it all dissolves. Medium-bodied, the carbonation a bit excessive for the level of body and flavor but does help on the refreshing scale. More of an orange to lime citrus presence as well as flowers and scrub grass, still there’s little debating that the caramel, malt, butterscotch and danish flakes remain in the driver’s seat. Any nuttiness weaves in and out, inconsistent. Apple, grape and apricot fruit flavors stay in the background. By the finish the carbonation weakens enough to create a smoother mouth feel. Earns its place as one of the more credible Mexican beers generally available."
"o - Overall a pretty average beer, but this was my go to in Mexico and still is at Mexican restaurants. Lots of malts but easy to drink, and a good alternative to the Corona's and Sol's usually offered. Woudl certainly order it again at a restaurant, though don't like it enough to pick up a 6 pack at the store with better options available."
"O: A pretty basic option that you'll find at most Mexican restaurants, and a better option than Corona."
"I've been drinking Negra Modelo (occasionally) for years, but had never bothered to write a review. I took a trip to Costa Rica recently and had Bavaria Dark which is the same style lager as Negra Modelo; I wanted to compare the two. Maybe the pleasantness of the vacation and lack of alternatives biased me in favor of Bavaria Dark, but I think it was better than Negra Modelo."
"Pours a sort of reddish brown color, almost like maple syrup. Very thin head that dissipated quite quickly. Bit of fruitiness on the nose along with dark grain and caramel, not overly expressive. Bit of nuts and caramel flavor that borders on brown sugar. Medium carbonation, but still a bit creamier than most mexican lagers. Overall an ok beer for its style, but definitely one of my preferred mexican beers."
"O: Flavorful and malty. Moderately balanced."
"I got a disappointingly-less than a finger of light-tan head with such poor retention that I began to wonder if I had done something to make it go away so quickly. Bye! Color was an orangish-amber, but definitely NOT ruby, and with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a pleasant malty bitterness, but nothing earth-shattering. I am having a difficult time buying into this being one of the top rated beers of the style. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, approaching creaminess with a pleasant sweetness on the tongue. Finish was likewise pleasantly sweet, but not enough to really wow me."
"overall, lacks complexity."
"This is the only Mexican beer I like much at all and is my go-to in Mexican restaurants."
"Pours a smooth, dark tea color. A small, tan head sticks the glass. Smell is a pleasant, crisp hop and some roasted, brown sugary maltness. Taste starts out low with that sweet malt, then drifts into a woody, bitter hop. Good body. Feel is cool and lasting. I'd drink a few of these with some good barbocoa.."
"I was very impressed the first time I tried Negra Modelo. It is hard to find a beer in the Supermarket that I can always rely on. Goes awesome with a nice meal, watching sports (for me Futbol), or any leisure activity. Smells good, mouthfeel is on point. The taste is great...not real strong, but has a nice potency to it. Overall a beer I can turn to if I need to find a quick dark beer."
"O: One of the better beers I have had in Mexico. It actually has flavor and doesn't drink very heavy, but is far better than most macro-lagers down here. Pretty easy to find in Mexico as well."
"I generally don't car for Mexican beers, but this isn't awful. Not great, or even good, but not awful."
"O: As bad as many Mexican lagers can be, this has always been one I enjoy."
"This is a beer that's trying to be both a lighter Mexican beer like Corona as well as a dark crafted beer at the same time, but instead comes out as a wispy lack of confidence. Disappointed in this beer, and the price paid."
"Overall: Very drinkable and easy on the palate. Diacetyl is probably slightly outside style guideline, but not by far. This is my favorite Mexican beer by far, and is definitely recommended if you have the chance to try it."
"When I am south of the border the ""Black Model"" is my beer of choice. It is the only dark beer I have ever had lime in and somehow it works - and that always makes me feel like I am on vacation. Solid taste, best dark Mexican beer I've ever had but the closest thing I can recall is Dos Equis Amber. Mouth feel is light and head of beer is pretty weak."
"D - Good drink if you have limited options, especially if you're at a Mexican style restaurant, its either this or Dos Equis; good for the summer time"
"Negra Modelo pours brown with minimal head. Like all Mexican beer, it’s refreshing and delicious when it’s super cold. There is a decent malt complexity and a little bit of bitterness to this. I like that it isn’t super sweet. This is a great beer for the style."
"Stir all ingredients, chill for at least 20-30 minutes to let the flavors marry, then serve. Keeps overnight, may be better that way."
"Poured a very light see through brown color. Didn't have much of a nose on it, maybe a bit of coffee. The taste reminded me of cold watered down coffee. Mouthfeel was light with not much body at all. I actually refused to finish this in the restaurant. This is the first beer I've ever sent back and I won't be trying this again."
"This was actually a bit of a suprise with how good it was. Poured a deep dark brown with a huge billowing white head that settled down to reveal some subtle lacing that was quite nice. Smell was of caramel, grains, and breads, yeast primarily. Taste was typical brown lager. Some subtle spiceness, great all around flavor. Lots of earthy tones, with a ever so slight sweetness. Mostly malts on this one. This was a decent beer, extremely sessionable and a samn fine call."
"This beer is readily available and fairly cheap here in New Mexico ($13 at 12 pack). Although somewhat simple, I feel that it represents the Munich Dunkel lager well. It's a pretty tasty and versatile beer that has earned a place in my fridge, replacing the PBR and Highlife I had as an undergraduate in Ohio. I feel the gold foil around the top adds some extra class as well...."
"O – More than just the best beer you can find at most Latin American restaurants, Negra Modelo is a solid beer in its own right. Pairs fantastic with chili, mole, and grilled meats."
"Mouthfeel is thin, light and bubbly. Overall, rating this beer as a Munich Dunkel does not really do it any favors. While it is better than your average mass-produced lager and is plenty refreshing, it really doesn't come anywhere close to the best Munich Dunkels."
"O- This isn't a bad beer, that is better than what your average beer drinker drinks. I would choose this over most of the standard american brands like (bud,miller,coors, etc) which I think suck. It does remind me of these brands however in flavor, mouthfeel and smell, but is a few notches higher in quality. Choose this over standard shitty american brands if its available to you."
"This is one of my favorite Mexican beers, which I guess doesn't say much, but it isn't bad and I'll certainly be drinking it again as my wife enjoys it and it makes its way to my fridge frequently."
"Tawny brown with a fizzle of soda pop like head. In fact, some cola makes an appearance in the flavor too, along with a bit of caramel and rye bread. Dry, but the lack of any hop bitterness gives a sweetish impression overall. Good for what it is and definitely my go to at poorly stocked Tex-Mex joints."
"Taste-Lightly toasted malt, faintly sweet and nutty, caramel and faint citrus peel note. Light bodied and very refreshing. A nice match for just about anything in a Mexican restaurant. Very smooth and drinkable."
"Overall for a dunkel lager it lacks the malt body, however for an easy drinking lager it is nice."
"There is some complexity and depth here but the flavors are very delicate. They are obliterated by the aggressive flavors of the Mexican food that Modelo is often served with making it a sweet balance to the savory and sometimes hot cuisine."
"Another on the mini tour. First time I've had this one on tap; amber color with next to no head. No aroma that I could tell, taste was malt, a little sweetness, and no bitterness. I actually kinda like this one: I'd get it with a Mexican dinner if there were not other ""worthy"" choices."
"Overall - This certainly isn't a beer I'd buy every day, but if I was eating at a Mexican restaurant and had to choose between this and the usual BMC suspects, I'd take this every time. It's very good for what it is."
"T: Better than the smell, but I don't know how much that's saying. Grain, a little syrupy sweetness, honey and more grain with a creamy mouthfeel. If you gave me this next to Bud Light in a blind taste test, I would have a hard time telling them apart."
"A staple of my friend Juan, this beer suprised me in its quality. A dark beer with a fairly light body. The primary flavor is toasted malt, fading into some mild hops. A very good dinner beer, enough in flavor to keep in interesting with a crisp carbonation to keep it refreshing."
"If it's this or krap go with this!"
"This is a pretty decent brew. The beer is pretty much what I expected. It's got a transparent brown color witha head head. The smell of nuts and hops in the mix. It's not overly flavorful but just enough to get the idea that this is a dark lager and nothing much can change that. The best thing about this beer is probably it's color though."
"The best of the mass-produced Mexican lagers by far, Negro Modelo is a savior at bars sellings buckets of Corona."
"Negra will still be my go to at the taqueria, but after reviewing and really trying to taste the beer my affinity for it has waned. It's ok, but not as good as I used to say it was."
"O - this is a slightly above average easy drinking darkish and flavorful brew. Seems to be an ok representation of the style. Not sure how often id get it. Got it as research for an experimental homebrew I am thinking up."
"D. Not an incredible beer, but a good easy drinker."
"Served on-tap at the airport Margaritaville in Cancun, Mexico. The beer was served in a mug. It presented a semi-hazed amber-brown color with no head. Caramel-malty nose. There was a very steady flow of carbonation present. The beer is slight dark caramel and molasses flavors riding a light, crisp body. There is a slightly dark and sweet aftertaste, with some sour notes and a hint of hops to balance. The finish is very quick and clean. Goes great with nachos, that's for damn sure."
"Overall, an easy drinker, but not something to seek out. However, the fact this beer is served in a brown bottle, with gold foil at the top shows that they at least care to protect this beer from light & skunk, unlike say Corona or Sol for example. It is not a great beer by any means, but it is palatable. Probably your best choice to pair with spicy Mexican food while at a Mexican restaurant, which is how and why I had it."
"D - Overall, a decent offering but nothing worth seeking out. I wouldn't turn one down, but if you're looking for something with bold flavours this is not it. A dark ale that is easily consumable in the dead of summer."
"best Mexican beer Ive had so far."
"Drinks smooth due to it being really thin for the style, but still delivers German beer flavors. But if you want German beers they're just as readily available as their knock-offs from Mexico. Go get yourself a true German dark beer."
"The CPJ"
"Haven't had anything from Mexico for a while, in the mood for something dark tonight, this one jumped off the shelf and into my hand. Not bad, but not something I would seek out again soon."
"Was excited to see this turn up in my neck of the woods, but I think one six pack will be enough after trying it. Definitely not bad and I'd drink it over Corona, Tecate or Dos Equis any day, but it has nothing to make it stand out over even pedestrian domestics."
"A Nice dark lager, this is one of the few mexican beers that has taste. A nice malt character that comes through from the first sip. It has some mouthfeel (compared to the average mexican pils). It is hard to compare this beer when you have been drining corona for a week, but Negra Modelo stands above the rest while you are actually in mexico"
"I used to like this much more than I do now. But if you want a beer at a mexican restaurant this is probably about your best option."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink, but not very memorable. Better than a Bud but not something to be searched out unless nothing much else is available."
"D- Great to pair with my bean stew i was having, really a delicious standby to rely on."
"D: I could, and have, downed 2-3 of these in a row with Mexican food. Very easy drinking and tasty to boot. I am always happy if this is available at local Mexican places. A great foot companion beer."
"D- very thin and downable, I'd have another."
"Pours a nice somber brown, mainly transparent but dark, small offwhite head that dissipates. Aromas are largely darker lager malts, touches of toasty grains and light creaminess. Taste is similar, smooth with some nice toasty malt that is light on the palate and very sessionable. Finishes snooth, clean, and a touch creamy. A very nice fark lager without any harsh notes, smooth, and highly sessionable. A beer I usually order when I go out for Mexican or am in Mexico."
"This beer poured with moderate carb and the color was kind of thin. Smelled like a watery brown ale and tasted slightly of corny adjuncts. It wasn't terrible but I wouldn't order one again."
"D: Very drinkable like most Mexican beer. Probably not the greatest example of the style but altogether a good, drinkable choice."
"Tasting the beer you got weak aromas, yet not unpleasant or boring. Some roasted malts with very little banana, and that checked by weak hops. Very drinkable especially with some mexican food. Not really the taste of a dark beer, but pretty basic good.Will buy it again in summer."
"Yes, it's a dark beer in color but about half in taste. Still, it's a definite improvement over most beers from Mexico. Probably a good entry beer into the world of dark beers for a newbie."
"Had this at a restaurant with dinner tonight. Poured a nice, clear medium brown color, with about half a finger of medium tan head. After removing the lime from the glass, I got aromas of caramel, malt and nuts. Crisp, light bodied, flavors of malt and nuts. Solid, one of the better Mexican lagers."
"D - no problem finishing this and a couple more. maybe with some BBQ or a nice fajita spread"
"D: Enjoyable, a beer to reach for when you want something that has a nice body, but not a beer to drink quickly when parched..."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a gold rimmed Negra Modelo pint glass a crisp dark brown with a thin khaki head. Aroma is slight dark malts and a hint of nuts. The taste is a small amount of dark malts, but not much else there. The beer is light and crisp with decent carbonation. This is a somewhat respectable Mexican beer, but one I'm glad I didn't have to pay for."
"O - less impressive than hoped for yet a little above average among Mexican beers I've had so far."
"this is a very drinkable dark beer. great for out here in the cabo sun."
"An extremely easy drinking drak beer. Anyone who favours roasted malts and caramel could happily spend some time here."
"Summary - Good south of the border beer, better than many, but that doesn't make it a great beer. If you are on the beach, good beer to have to pass the time."
"Drinks very easy, similar to a macro. Some nice flavor to the brew."
"Overall a very drinkable beer. Nothing offensive or extreme. Goes great with spicy mexican food. Better on tap than from the bottle."
"D-Probably my favorite of the Mexican beer family and incredibly drinkable"
"Drinkability: Ok to drink, but not a bargain in the world of darker beers. I would not seek it out if other craft beer alternatives were available, but would prefer this over Corona or Sol in a Mexican establishment."
"While stellar for this particular kind of brewing operation, overall this dark lager is just slightly above average - everything's there, but it comes across as muted. Still, a worthy enough beer option in the Sol/Corona/Pacifico wasteland where you're more than liable to run into it."
"Pours a medium amber-brown, not much of a head. Medium level of carbonation, looks like a Brown Ale. Aroma is kinda underwhelming too, just a bit of grains. Actually to me has a noticeable ""adjunct lager"" smell, which I don't like. Taste is just OK, like a maltier lager, maybe an Irish Red similarity because of the caramel malts. Drinkability is pretty high, has a light-bodied feel to it. This isn't a great beer, especially compared to a better German-made Dunkel Lager, but Negra Modelo is still much better than the other crap Grupo Modelo makes, I'd take it over a Corona anyday."
"D: This is a simple but very refreshing beer; a good one when you want to drink several at a time. I enjoyed it"
"D- Good beer for a meal. Not overly filling. Refreshing with dark notes. Descent."
"Drinkability - This beer is drinkable for sure, but mostly average across the board. Nothing outstanding nor nothing offensive. Easy drinking and glad I sampled it."
"Very drinkable, especially of the Mexican offerings. Highly recommended."
"Not really a bad beer but not that good either. Light brown in color with poor fizzy carbonation. I had to do a rough pour to get any kind of head retention, in order to get a good smell. The smell is like wet toasty malts with some very slight citric sourness. At first the taste has a citris water quality like corona but the toasted malts try to sneak in at the finish but just can't get thier act together. The aftertaste has a little bit of toasty chocolate to it but it's very weak. Best described as Corona blended with some Bockbier. In the mouth it's kind of fizzy and watery, a little bit like soda. I don't think this is really true to the style but a style of it's own, Mexican Dark Lager perhaps, really quite refreshing and light, with a tropical feel to it. This isn't a bad thing just not typical of the assigned style."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink; I could easily drink many of these in one night."
"Pours a reddish mahogany color, clear with minimal head. Scent is pale, light caramel malt and some notes of roasted nuts and earthy hops. Taste comes of of nowhere to be a smooth and quite flavorful blend of light caramel, roasted nuts and touches of earthy hops. Medium bodied, smooth, light carbonation. Surprisingly good beer,"
"Drinkability: While I was able to finish this one I found that I was ready for it to be gone about 2/3rds of the way through the beer. While initially it was tasty, eventually the sweetness became too much of the flavor of the beer without some break being provided by some dryness in the finish. I suppose I could drink another but honestly have no desire to and I certainly will not be adding this to my shopping list."
"Good dark color with a small head of one finger. Ops where did the head go, vanished in a flash, leaving a thin ring of lace. Color is a dark dark amber rating a 21 on the SRM chart. Smells like burn toast with lime jam. The taste is predominantly citrus over toasted wheat, with malt and yeast undertones. A little watery in my mouth, but it grows on you. I am glad I do not have to travel to Mexico to enjoy this lager."
"Drinkability - not a bad brew, but not terribly forthcoming in its complexity, which makes it only seem like a simple beer, which I don't believe it to be. More samplings warranted. :-)"
"Poured in a pint and has a rich dark amber color that pretty much resembles the color of the bottle with a medium white crown. Little carbonation. Medium body. Fairly good on the nose with roasted dark malts, faint touches of hopps. Nice maltiness at the beggining finishing in a dry hoppy aftertaste."
"Drinkability is very decent, could have a few."
"D - I like this beer. As a cocktail, whatever. As a pair with Mexican, killer!"
"It was a very solid beer. It had a really good initial taste. Easy to drink until the lower third of the bottle. It seemed to get a little too bitter towards the end I probably wouldn't drink it often but I would certainly recommend it for anyone to try."
"I could drink these 'til I drop."
"It drinks very smooth, very nice beer."
"M/D: light bodied and smooth finish for a darker beer. Decent drinkability if it wasn't for that darn aftertaste."
"Drink I could drink these anytime."
"D- With the cold weather coming on, this is an ideal beer to consume. The alcohol is well hidden and would be great to enjoy over an evening....with friends or while watching the tube at home. I recommend this one and think is one of the best Mexican beers out there!"
"D-Not a bad beer per se, but not one I'm likely to revisit anytime soon unless I'm at a Mexican restaurant."
"Overall, an interesting dark beer to taste but not one I'd buy again. (Looking at the other reviews, I think I may have gotten an older bottle, so take that into account.)"
"I bought this beer on sale at the local store. It was always a beer that I passed up for some reason. The bottles have a very unique design. The beer pours nicely with not too much head. Im not getting too much on the smell. The first thing I taste is a slight toffee taste which goes down real smooth. I was pleased with this beer. It was a average beer and may be one of your better choices at the Mexican restaurant. I could only drink a few of these at a time."
"Pretty decent Vienna, and one of the better ""grocery store craft/import"" beers. My only gripe is the cost, as I can get Brooklyn Lager for the same price and it blows Modelo away..."
"RJT"
"Delicious in a simple way. Remember, just say no to limes! Hands down one of the best Mexican beers that has ever crossed the border, legally."
"Good beer out of the bottle though."
"Drinkability: Smooth with some depth of flavors yet it's light enough with low ABV to make repeatedly drinkable."
"Y'know, I love going to Mexican restaurants, as I can't seem to get enough of the food, but the beer selections don't usually come close to exciting. This night, dining with the brother and father, I went with my Mexican standby. It pours a clear dark garnet-brown topped by about a finger of off-white foam. The nose is weak, comprising light caramel, light biscuits, and very light florals. The taste is very similar, with the light caramel, biscuits, and florals returning, though with a bit o' hard water thrown in there, mixing things up in a slightly negative way. The body is light, with a moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a decent brew, nothing close to special, but pretty nice when the enchiladas hit the table."
"Taste is surprisingly good, it's crisp and sharp, very clean and refreshing for a dark beer. Mouthfeel is again surprising, it's a lager so it's very smooth. One of the best Mexican beers I've had."
"Taste is light and mostly simple but with a little depth of character, toasty grain, hints of chocolate, leaves, and grass, caramel hint. It is fairly well balanced, smooth and drinkable, with the flavour lasting."
"2nd tasting: Pours ruby like cola, candy apple nose, cherry malts and leafy hops. Sweet and fizz together would pair well with Tex-Mex."
"Negra Modelo is a crystal clear brown lager with a thin off-white head that has nice retention and lacing. It smells a touch sweet and fruity with notes of syrupy malt, some adjunct and a touch of roast. It's medium-light bodied and smooth with a clean, dry finish. It tastes melanoidal and slightly sweet. There's no real bitterness. It's a corny flavor with a slightly sweet aftertaste. It's perfect for a michelada."
"Note: I drink most Mexican beers straight from the bottle or can. This one, however, I prefer in a glass, with no lime as it kills the flavor. For some reason I like drinking this out of a short rocks glass - maybe because a rocks glass is stubby like the bottle."
"This beer was quite good compared to the other mexican beers available at my grocery store. It was poured into a regular 16oz glass cup. There was barely any head foam and not a lot of bubbles. There wasn't much of an aroma, other than a slight musty sweetness. The beer is dark, but doesn't taste like a dark beer. It isn't bitter at all, but actually on the sweeter side. It goes down very smooth. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another six pack at the store next time."
"Drink - a refreshing dark beer, I would drink again. Dark beer flavor, but seems to go down lighter"
"This is definitely one of Mexico's finest offerings and it goes great with tacos and a hot Summer day."
"Cheers!"
"D- Meh. Better when paired with food, great heat reducer for spicy mexican food. On it's own? Weak and boring."
"D- Drinks quite easily... and pairs-well with Mexican food. Definitely one of those darker beers that work well in hot weather."
"D - This beer has a very nice malt character in the aroma, but the complexity does not carry over well into the flavor. It tastes a lot like a cola product with very little bitterness and a strong caramel sweetness, somewhat reminiscent of slightly flat Dr. Pepper. Certainly not a drain pour and not bad when paired with Mexican food, but it is a bit too sweet and would benefit from an increased hop profile."
"D - Definetly one of the better beer staples found in mexican restaurants. Easy going down and an overall decent brew."
"Drinkability: A fairly one-dimensional beer, but still decent. Probably the best choice at most Mexican restaurants."
"Crystal clear brownish copper with an off white cap that fell fast and left a thin collar and skim of bubbles on the surface of the beer. A bit of spotty lacing clung to the glass for a few minutes too. Malty aroma, brown sugar and caramel, a bit bready, slightly fruity. Mild bitterness, a bit spicy and herbal, with caramel and toasted malt flavours. Faint fruitiness that was more of an indistinct dried fruit rather than fresh and juicy. Quick finish, leaving only a mineral aftertaste. Light to medium bodied with ample carbonation, some malty dryness and fairly crisp. Not bad at all and much more enjoyable than most other Mexican lagers I've tried."
"Mouthfeel is somewhat smooth, but it still displays the fizziness of an adjunct lager. Regarding drinkability, as I said, not bad. There is enough going on to keep me mildly interested...I would order it on draft if available to go with some Mexican cuisine."
"D: this would be great with some spicy mexican food, but is drinkable on its own."
"Overall a good and decent brew. Likely the best effort from this brewer."
"Despite what its striking appearance suggests, Negra Modelo offers no more character than the other mass-produced beers of Grupo Modelo (Corona) or Mexican brewers at large. I understand it gets hot down there but is the concept of brewing a thirst-quenching beer that *also* has flavour and personality still that foreign to them? 111 million people in that country and you're telling me this idea has yet to occur to anyone? Really?"
"Poured into a glass, the beer has a nice tannish colored one-finger head that reduces to a thin film that covers the top. Has a very weak aroma but it's sweet. The taste is good, nice caramelization going on. A very light hop profile. It's a nice malty beer. The body is very light with subtle carbonation, a beer I'd classify as refreshing. I can go one after another of these, they're nice."
"Appearance is a dark amber/caramel color with a big white head that diminishes rather quickly. Smell does not have much going on, but it is by far the best scent I've gotten from any Mexican beer. There is a bit of sweet malt character and possibly some very subtle dark fruits. The taste is very refreshing (especially when it's almost 2am and the temperature outside is fucking 90 degrees!). I don't get much hop character, but I do definitely get some dark fruits...maybe some prunes and raisins. Quite tasty. The mouthfeel is nothing impressive. Highly carbonated and kinda leaves a weird, not so pleasant aftertaste. Drinkability is very high. From all the beers from Mexico I've tried, this is probably my favorite."
"Poured a dark amber in color with an initial two finger light tan head that dissapaed quickly to some light lacing. Light aromas of toasted malt. Sweet malt on the tongue with a slight hoppy finish. Light medium body with good carbonation. Great brew with pork green chili and tortillas."
"A good cheap beer. Nothing to write hwowme about but I enjoy it with some Tex-mex cuisine."
"The color is a dark caramel, very clear, with little head, but very sizable carbonation bubbles. I detect very little, but sweet, aroma. The taste is not bad for the kind of dark lager it is (ordinarily not my kind of beer). The light caramel taste is not pervasive. The mouthfeel is what one might expect--thin but with a very nice kick from the carbonation. It is very drinkable."
"Notes: Not an overly impressive beer, but I think that is a good thing. It doesn't have anything that stands out as bad, while at the same time possessing qualities that make it easy to drink when you just want a sessionable slightly darker beer."
"D- Definitely not a go to beer for this style, but a few do hit the spot with Mexican or Latin cuisine."
"Body is medium-light and carb slightly less than I would expect. Drinkability isn't through the roof, but it's easy to down a couple with a meal."
"D - This is one of the better Mexican beers out there but thats not saying all that much as far as the style and my liking its just average"
"D - great drinkability in this beer, and a great compliment to a Mexican dinner out"
"Pouring a deep bourbon-brown, and tasting sweetly malty (like a brown ale), Negra Modelo is my go-to choice when frequenting Mexican restaurants. It's uncharacteristically dark, when compared to most Mexican brews (which tend to be light lagers), but nicely satisfying, especially when consumed alongside a good burrito or fish taco. A classic and favorite of mine."
"Overall, a great dark lager for availability and price. Much better than most Mexican imports, and a good representation of a German style. A very approachable and drinkable beer that could also be enjoyed by those with a less developed palate for stronger brews."
"Pours an absolutely beautiful just slightly lighter than ruby red color with a big fairly tight head that is not particularly well retained but leaves just a slightly better than spotty lace. I've got to give this a 4 for appearance on color alone though, the color of this beer is sheer perfection. The aroma however falls a little short of the great heights I suppose I would have liked from such a wonderful looking beer. I can't help but think that this smells precisely like the worst kind of cheap pale lager, with the cooked corn, the light bread yeast, and the mild sweetness. There is some floral character but really not enough to redeem this one. The flavor bounces my confidence in this beer back a up a bit. The beer is sweet, it's too sweet and for that matter it's too corny. But that doesn't mean there aren't a lot of nice things going on in the flavor of this beer there is a good fruitiness with a nice interplay of just the mildest toasty malt. This is all before I mention that this has a really pleasant hop zing, I'm really not sure what the hops are but they strike me as west coast fruity and citrusy hops, however there is no denying the presence of some noble herbal hoppiness as well. The thing about Negra Modelo is that it does, basically, exactly what it came to do. It is slightly sweeter than most pale mexican lagers, at the same time it's got a more bold flavor than those as well, but at the end of the day it's refreshing. I am positive that this is what the brewers of this beer were going for, like it or not, they hit the mark."
"All in all, definitely one of the better Mexican beers I've had. A little too filling after it goes down (we'll see what happens next time...), but still a nice (cheap) drinkable beer."
"This one is a standby in Mexican restaurants, when Corona is often the only other choice. I was given a bottle with a lime stuck in the neck-ugh. Once I removed the lime, asked for a glass and had it ""straight up," this beer was much more tolerable. It's ok, I can detect some dark fruits throughout. Appearance is nothing special, no head, no lacing."
"12oz. bottle served in a pilsener glass. Poured a partially hazy brown with deep ruby highlights when backlit. The one inch, loose, off-white head sizzled and receded into a soapy cap. Nose is very subdued - malt, perhaps some dark fruit undertones, light banana esters and a hint of noble hops. Taste follows nose - nice balance between malt and bitter keeps the flavor profile on an even keel. A little watery and finishes with a little bit of cereal grain sweetness. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an even background carbonation and a semi-dry finish. All and all, not a bad brew and a nice complement to a Mexican dish."
"D: Would alsao be great with grilled ...?"
"All in all, a very solid contender and one worth trying."
"Taste, shocker, goes excellent with good Mexican food. Skip the lime. Spice is good, as the small amount of hops will come out. Very carbonated throughout."
"Of the Mexican beers I've tried Negra Modelo is my favorite. Light in taste and body, great hot weather beer and a great accompaniment to Mexican style food. Even better on tap when you can find it."
"Taste: Very sweet but not really the fruit as I was expecting. It has more of a nutty caramel type sweetness with very little bitterness."
"Overall: Not the most complex beer in the world, but what it does it does right."
"Final Thoughts - By far the best of the Mexican brews. A great choice at a Mexican joint. Usually have a few in the house."
"Overall I had to drink this on the cold side (which helped) but it was refreshing if nothing else though I prefer the Especial to this."
"Overall: A moderate beer, but not one with anything special about it. This style is German, which means that many masters of brewing have perfected it to a beautiful level that this Mexican macro beer does not come close to. A better choice than almost all Bud/Miller/Coors however..."
"It's not going to win any awards, but this is head and shoulders above the other Mexican macro lagers. A bit too expensive to have around on a regular basis, but will do the trick in a Mexican restaurant."
"Beer has a nice brown color with a thick creamy head. The smell was that of malt & caramel. It has a light taste and is a bit sweet. The finish was smooth & easy with a bit of carbonation. The beer goes best with food, especial Mexican dishes. I would not recommend this as a session beer."
"Poured at fridge temperature. A transparent brown into a standard pilsner glass. A 1"" cream coloured head that sticks around. foamy lacing. Lightly malt flavoured. Very drinkable. Could have a few of these. Superior to standard Mexican lagers by quite a wide margin."
"Mexican beer should only be compared to mexican beer. When a country's water has the reputation that Mexico's has, one shouldn't expect the beer that's produced there to be on the same level as other beers from around the world. That being said, this is my Mexican food beer. Have one while waiting for the food to be ready and have one with the meal. It is best this way. Not a sitting around drinking beer. The tongue needs a break way to often. Have a few in the frig. for dinner or get it at the restraunt."
"D: Good drinkability. Quite refreshing beer..."
"D: Not much flavor but it goes down easy, especially with food. However, there are many other alternatives I would reach for first."
"Poured an amber brown, white head that faded quickly. Smell is big malty sweetness with some stale notes that i cant figure out but arent terribly appealing. Taste is watery up front then malty sweetness, high carbonation helps the drinkability on this beer and the sweetness definitely helps balance out the spicy Mexican food I had this with. Decent beer, a bit sweet for my liking but not bad at all."
"Pours a brownish color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Medium body. Slightly drinkable, would not buy again."
"This was a pretty good beer but I feel that it is usually a little overpriced in the store (usually one of the highest) but if I found a little more affordable I wouldn't hesitate to pick this up."
"One and a half fingers white head, slow dissipation with above average lacing. Dark brown body, visible carbonation rising from bottom of glass. Malt forward in the nose, munich bready caramel sweet malts, not much roastiness, may have flowery hops but very well hidden. Taste is a bit sweet but fairly balanced, not much hop presence, with a fairly dry finish. Not much carbonation on the mouthfeel, pretty watery. Pretty drinkable. I wouldn't normally drink this style, but given the choices (all Mexican beers) this was actually pretty good. Not to do Sean Paxton quality beer and food pairings, but this cut through the spice of the dish nicely. Worth a try."
"I'll keep running those races, and if Negra is the best beer available afterwards, I'll certainly be plenty happy."
"The thing I like best about this beer is that it sticks to its typology very well. There is great play between the different malt and hop flavors, but its not going to knock you out with any of them. Its not heavy or heady. This is one of the few beers I keep on hand."
"D- Could drink a few...but not more than that. With mexican food this is a winner all the way."
"Grabbed a six of this the other day as i had some over Christmas at my cousins and decided to check into it a little further. 12 oz. bottle poured into a weizen glass. Dark carmel color about like strong iced tea with a 1/2 finger watery head that was gone in a squinit. Lacing was short lived and light. Smelled strongly of alchohol and malt much like md 20-20 back in the day. Taste was winey and somewhat watery and was gone quickly with a dry finish. Mouthfeel was decent and on the thin side with a moderate bite and not unpleasant mouth to nose aroma. Drinkability was ok but not what i was expecting. All in all not a bad beer but nothing i would sell the farm over. Drink some for yourself and you be the judge, but not worth $9.00 a six in my humble opinion."
"feel is smooth and watery"
"Overall, Negra Modelo is an average beer. There are many more suitable options for the style, but at the same time, I'm not dumping this down the drain. It's drinkable, but I'd prefer something with more taste."
"F.T.- This is a great no frills beer. Best beer from Mexico. Would be ideal for cookouts, tailgating, chili night, or with any spicy foods."
"Drank from a stubby bottle with gold foil around the neck and no freshness date. Some sweet malts and faint cocoa flavor. A slight mocha flavor in the profile. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth. Very drinkable and tasty with some spicey wings or nachos with hot peppers."
"D: Very drinkable, possibly my favorite of the trip."
"LOL not all that bad, just not really good either."
"On the whole not that bad, and, when cold, a good compliment to cheap and simple Mexican chow. Next time I'll just drink this from the bottle."
"A decent Vienna lager which is easy to drink and does what it is supposed to. The sweetness is possibly a little bit high, and the carbonation definitely is, but overall a decent beer."
"Color looks pretty similar to an Irish Red. Zero head even after a pretty aggressive pour. There's not much to smell. Some cane sugar sweetness and very faint coffee. Has a bit of a metallic taste that really lingers. Nice roasted malt notes. Years ago, I thought this was a pretty nice beer...my how the palate has changed. That's not to say this is bad, I'm just a little blasé about it now. Certainly nothing offensive about this brew and it's still my favorite Mexican. Despite looking like a flat Coke, it has a really nice feel."
"a nice thirst quenching way to start out my new years eve."
"Drinkability: quite drinkable. I haven't had Negra Modelo in awhile and have forgotten quite how much I like it."
"Drinkability: A so-so beer. Certainly better than most Mexican beers I've had but not such a good representation of the Munich Dunkel Lager sytle, in my opinion. You could do better but you could also do much, much worse."
"not bad for a bar beer when there's not much else available, but i wouln't run out to buy a 6. probably one of the better cerveza."
"Overall, there really isn't anything special about this beer, but it is pretty good. Its not skunky or flat or thin, its a good bodied decent dark lager. I wouldn't shy away from it at a party but I probably wouldn't keep it on had at the house."
"Negra is a very weak, bland beer. Not worth ever trying again."
"WAY better than the Modelo Especial."
"Salud!"
"Cheers!"
"over-all i like this beer, and i would drink it again. everything comes together. i think it would be good with red meat."
"D: Outstanding appearance, smell, taste and mouthfeel, together with Corona Extra the best mexican beers, and adding guinness extra stout, st. peter's cream stout and moosehead lager, my five favorite beers of all time."
"nicely drinkable, when in mexico seek this beer out."
"My favorite Mexican beer!!! Pours a dark colour with touches of ruddiness with little head and lacing. It has a somewhat of a toasted smell to it, and hints of toffee and cocoa as well as a delightful smokiness embody this beer. It has a medium mouthfeel with a slightly dry finish. Overall, one of the best Mexican beers."
"The aroma is ok, there are light malts throughout, reminded me of a bad version of a Boston lager. At the same time its refreshing to drink something different then the standard light mexican beer."
"D: Goes down smooth but somehow is filling even though it does not feel that heavy."
"D-Very dinkable, both for ease of drinking and for the relative tastiness of this brew compared to other Mexican brews which I encountered during this vacation."
"This is my go-to beer with a Mexican meal. Refreshing and light, but with enough character and body to be enjoyable. Very clean and easy to drink with the slightest hint of hop bite up front. Nothing spectacular, but the best of the typical Mexican beers."
"This is a fine beer with tacos. Its a semi-transparent blackish-brown, almost the color of Coca-Cola. In fact, a guy with me at the restaurant though I had a mixed drink, not a beer. Malt is very dominant in the flavor profile with slight sweetness. Hop bitterness and flavor are really undetectable. It has a thin body with enough carbonation to keep it interesting. Probably best ice cold and in large quantity."
"had this the same night i had the corona at peppitos on chicago ave this one was good it poured a nice brown color with a good head it had some coffee and toffee smells with roasted malts..the taste was the same it was sweet with roasted toffee and a light coffee taste with some sweet malts it has a medium mouth feel nothing overwhelming.. overall not a bad lager"
"Pours a light brown with a fizzy head. Smells of roasted malts and maybe a bit of coffee. Taste is the same, nice malty sweetness with a bit of coffee and cocoa. A slight bit of hops rounds things out. The beer is a bit too thin for my tastes but is a good sessionable beer."
"Drinkability : A decent Mexican beer"
"Pours a nice medium brown with a fairly thick head and not much lacing as it goes down. The smell involves a bit of roasted malt and breadiness, but nothing is overpowering. The proper flavors come out a bit more in the nose, but nothing too special. Medium-bodied and smooth, offering pretty good drinkability, and probably wouldn't be a bad beginner's dark beer."
"This beer is just okay. Good but not great."
"This tasted pretty much like a nondescript everybeer. Nothing too strong, nothing too watery, nothing too thick, nothing too pungent. Goes down smooth, but nothing special. Smells like malts and hops and bread, but nothing special. Tastes like a well balanced clean cut brew, but nothing special. Just an across the board average beer."
"I tried this beer at a Mexican restaurant and I wish I had a marguerita. Perhaps the keg was old or the tap lines are dirty as other BA appear to like this beer."
"I would buy this during the summer when it is on sale. It makes a nice michelada (of course a better beer would be wasted). With less carbonation the mouthfeel might make this more pleasant. It would be smoother, as it is your tongue is bitten."
"Overall, probably the best Mexican beer I've had to date. Clean and easy to drink, thanks to a smooth feeling and a taste that's not too overpowering, I'd definitely have this again."
"Oh! I'm so disappointed with this, I thought maybe, just maybe, Mexicans could brew a dark beer with more character than their pale shit. But no, I'm not enjoying this. Not undrinkable, but not pleasant."
"Overall, it's not offensive, but it's very very bland indeed, and I really dislike the feel. It's undoubtably drinkable, but it's certainly not something of which I'd choose to partake regularly."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark amber color with a small head. Aroma is mild, a bit malty. Taste is of malts with some bitterness. Nothing special here. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a mediocore offering."
"I was pleasantly surprised by this one, certainly the best mexico has to offer, in my opinion. Pairs wonderfully with mexican food and it's easy drinking but mediocre at best by itself. Extremely drinkable and well balanced, a sure fire choice for me at any mexican restaurant (that has it) and a could make for a great session beer with some homemade tortilla chips."
"D-I can drink a lot of this beer. Smooth and balanced and one of the lightest dark beers I have sampled."
"Finish: Dry finish with bitter aftertaste."
"Conclusion: This is one of those big imports that you can find at a lot of restaurants/bars out, especially Mexican or Tex-Mex places. It's definitely better than your average American macro-lager and most of the big imports (Heineken, Beck's, Corona, etc) and goes wonderfully with Mexican or spicy food. Other than that, it's nothing real special."
"D: A decent beer, and better than a lot of other choices... Good for a summer day, or a bbq."
"I had this at a good Mexican place. Usually I enjoy beers like this with Tex-Mex. Though this pretty much had no body for a ""dark beer."" Hardly any flavor or aromatic character either. I will avoid this from now on and drink Bohemia instead."
"Lager taste and feel, with a hint of a sweet maltiness in the aftertaste, not complexed, but different enough for me to have enjoyed. One of the best Mexican beers I've had so far."
"A nice beer to choose when you go to a Mexican restaurant. Amber color with a fair amount of head. A lot of malt flavors almost to the point of being bread like. It's nicely carbonated so I find it easy to drink several. I usually order this when we go to our favorite Mexican place in our neighborhood."
"D - It's easily drinkable but not fantastic by at all. Very mediocre in my opinion but it goes down well and doesn't offend."
"Not exactly what one would seek in a German-style beer, but for hot weather and spicy Mexican food, this provides an easy-drinking choice with enough character to balance the refreshment angle."
"All-around very good beer that is very light despite its billing as a dark beer. Literally."
"update: later that night a got a killer headache and the only time beer does to me is when i drink the cheap stuff so drinkability goes from 4 to 1 - never again"
"Probably my favorite Mexican beer, at least that I've had so far. They like to jam a lime in it which works okay if you like that sort of thing. Either way, goes good with Mexican cuisine."
"Clear dark cherry colored with a quickly fading tan colored head that leaves filmy lace on the glass. Smells of light brown sugar and caramel. The flavor is caramel malt and slight vanilla with just enogh fruity hop bittering to balance. Light bodied with effervescent seltzery carbonation. This is probably the best Mexico has to offer, good for washing down chiles rellenos."
"I suppose this would go well with some spicy Mexican food, but I would never drink this in its own right."
"D: I could drink as many of these as I bought. But, luckily, I only bought one."
"D: I had two, could have had more. Pretty easy drinking."
"Salud!"
"This beer is easy to drink. It is the only good mexican beer I have had. The taste makes a unique but strong statement without being overly powerful."
"More refined than their Leon."
"D: This is a great beer to have with Mexican food, as it pairs well with spicey dishes. It's easy drinking, also."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The texture is easy and appealing, rolling gently behind the beer's rather unpleasant palate. I wouldn't come back to this beer again in the future, I'll leave the Munich style lagers to their mother country who do them so well."
"I'm pretty thoroughly impressed with the overall flavor. Previously the sum of my mexican beer was corona and corona light, this is far better, I would drink this beer any day if there wasn't anything awesome around."
"Final Thoughts: This beer is perfect if you wanted to have a nice, big Mexican dinner. I can also see it being a decent sipping beer as well, but the fact it's a bit heavy on the gut takes away from the experience. Still, I would recommend this and is certainly worth at least one try."
"D - Even though there is nothing exceptional about this beer, I still enjoy drinking it. Good on a warm summer day or with a bag of tortilla chips and some salsa."
"Drinkability- Refreshing, and fairly well-balanced. Not bad for an inexpensive, widely available brew. Great with chips and salsa."
"Drinkability: It's not bad. Anyone for dessert after a couple Modelo Especial's?"
"Drinkability - Overall, I thought it was a very pleasant tasting dark beer that went down very smoothly. Best Mexican beer I have tasted and would go well with a nice steak or Mexican dishes."
"Nothing special, until you try the beers that are generally on the menu with it. Decent and drinkable."
"D: Easy to drink. Pairs well with Mexican food (with which I was drinking it with). Couldn't see drinking this by itself, but it's far better than Corona"
"drinkability: it was ok, better choices unsure about freshness though. which I doubt because I thought I would have liked this beer better. I will try again"
"Drink: Not at all difficult to consume. My personal preference is for the palate to be clean once the potable has exited into the esophagus. Yeah, I know that you are tired of me saying that, but I like what I like..."
"D: Easy to drink lager, and out of the mexican brews, I prefer this one over most. It isn't complicated, and definitely a summer beer."
"As a side note, I cook a lot with this beer too. Good for adding flavor and tenderizing meat when you don't want a heavy porter flavor lingering on your food."
"D- A good session beer. My favorite of the Mexican beers. Easily. Has a real taste and substance to it, but doesn't sacrifice drinkability."
"Taste is a bit better, the dry malt brings in a bit of a nutty taste and just a hint of hops joins the sugary finish. Mouthfeel is weak but expected. Drinkability is pretty good."
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of pale malt, sweet malt, and some yeast cleanliness. Fits the style of a Munich Dunkel Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt up front, then strong yeast cleanliness, and some very slight roasted malt in the finish. Overall, a rather decent Munich Style Dunkel - I could drink quite a few of these as session beers."
"Dr. Yes indeedy. It goes down very easy and tastes great on the way. I first encountered Negra Modelo in Berrego Springs, CA and fell in love with it."
"D - Fantastic. Could drink a six-pac on a hot day. Very underrated, underappreciated beer."
"D- Sessionable and decent enough for a few on a hot day. If I ever find myself in mexico at least I have something to seek out."
"I had this at a Mexican restaurant recently, and it complemented the food perfectly, so I decided it was time to revisit. Copp color comes from a rigorous pour. About a finger of white head results. By the looks of it, this brew will be very carbonated. Nose gives off some sweet grain smells, bit of milk chocolate as well. Definitely tastes very grainy, sweet like graham crackers. Chocolate comes through a bit, and there is a sort of metallic twang too. Not as carbonated as I was expecting, and fairly light in body. Very good drinkability, it compliments food extremely well. Next time, skip the Corona, and go for this instead."
"Not a bad beer. It may not even be fresh but at least it's still drinkable the way it is. Gotta be good for something after all."
"Not bad, but kind of overpriced. Taste like what should be another cheap mexican beer. Finishing taste is similar to corona. Nothing great but not bad either. Probably worth a try, some may really like it, to me its just pretty average though."
"Appearance is a dark brown amber with little head and no lace. Smell and taste of sweet roasted malts, light caramel with a crisp mild bitterness that finishes clean. Mouthfeel is light in body with good carbonation. I had a bottle while waiting for my Mexican takeout and ended up buying a sixer for the evening."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was coca-cola colored. The beeer poured a nice head but it did not last long at all. It left decent lacing, but really, who cares about that? The beer smelled sour to me. Taste was a little sweet and a little flat tasting. No good to me I will not buy agaiun as I have tried this beer repeadedly and always get the same bad beer."
"For now though, I definitely recommend you try this beer. Because chances are that you wont taste what I taste, full of flavor and pretty smooth. Go for it! Cheers!"
"OK, you'll have to excuse me, but I can't understand why people like that much this beer. To me is just a dark version of Coronas, with some more body and aroma and some more tasty, but nothing that I haven't tasted in many beers before. Clear brown colour, a little head that doesn't hold and leaves no leace. It smells a bit of cocoa powder, faint caramel and toasted notes and some metallic notes. Watery metallic taste with hints of cocoa and caramel and there's a little more that you can tell, if anything. I've tried several times to try to convince myself, but not."
"This is a surprisingly respectable session beer and worth giving a shot."
"D- Excellent. I was pleasantly surprised with this brew. Me gusta Negra Modelo! ( sorry, that's about all I remember from high school.)"
"D- Quite a drinkable mexican beer. This is definitely going to be my mexican restaurant go-to."
"I find this very drinkable - at a happy hour with chips and salsa, I could easily have a bunch of these."
"I really enjoy this Beer and the fact that is is readily available causes it to magically appear in the refridgerator frequently. This is a good Beer for cookouts and Kayaking."
"Better than Corona or Sol, this was my go to beer in Mexico."
"D= This is one of the few Mexican brews that I really like and this paired well with my shrimp fajitas. Easily sessionable."
"Note: I had this on tap several times when I was in Mexico and it went with the food very nicely."
"D - I suppose this is a 'highly drinkable' beer when you're consuming Mexican style food - or really any food that compliments the American-style dark lager. I think it fit the mentioned style better than a Munich Dunkel. Munich Dunkel would imply a richer malt character - which this certainly lacks. Nonetheless it's a decent beer, but is hardly worth seeking out (as if you had to)."
"Pours a clear brown color, with a mid size, off-white head. Average retention, actually some nice looking lace. Mild toasted malt sweetness, with light grassy hop aromas. Slightly fruity. Taste some grain and lightly toasted malt sweetness. Finishes with herbal hops, a bit of a metallic finish. Light to medium body, average carbonation. Easily drinkable, one of the better Mexican beers. Would go well with spicy foods."
"Pours a clear dark copper, with a finger tall soapy head, leaves stucco lacing on the glass. Aroma is subdued, you gotta get your nose right down there before you can detect some lightly toasted malts and earthy tones, a bit of honey. The medium bottle was very smooth, almost slick, and tasted of toasty and sweet malts that were sufficiently sweet to stand up to my enchilladas. One of the few popular Mexican beers I've had that actually goes well with spicy Mexican food."
" D - Goes down smooth and refreshing for a dark beer, not heavy. I liked the lacing in the glass. Good beer for grilling."
"D: Easily quaffable, and one of the best Mexican imports I've had to date (admittedly, a small list). Nothing outstanding, but a solid, interesting take on a German style."
"Nutty flavors really shine in this beer. There is still some toastiness here, but it is a bit more muted than the smell would indicate. Feels like a lager with it's thin body and smooth, crisp character. Highly drinkable and surprisingly refreshing. I can appreciate the craftsmanship of this beer."
"A reddish brown color with a thin off white head that goes away quite fast, almost no lacing. Aroma is slightly grainy with a faint note of alcohol.Flavor is lightly toasted malts and a hint of molasses, Mild spicy bitterness. Finishes fairly clean, with just a light, lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel: Light-bodied. Medium-high carbonation. Much better than expected."
"Drank with friends on January 23. Bottle - pours a clear dark amber. Very little head. Very smooth, light to medium bodied. Hints of malt, easy finish. Minimal lacing throughout. Almost ""light"" tasting. Very sessionable despite ABV. Probably would not purchase again, but would gladly partake of if offered. Just not my type."
"You know, not really half bad. It's amazing that this is put out by the same company as Corona (not to say Corona is undrinkable, just sort of blah...) This one isn't blah at all. It pours dark amber, has a somewhat hoppy smell, and you can taste the hops in the aftertaste a little bit. Maybe just a hint of chocolate? I could drink these and my partner really likes them a lot."
"Notes: Overall, this is one of the more flagship Mexican beers. Never disappoints and please hold the lime."
"Pretty drinkable and a mildly decent representation of a Dunkel, though falling short a bit (though perhaps not falling short of the aims of the brewers). The royal treatment on the bottle is indicative of the superiority of this brew over the vast majority of its homeland's bretheren, though compared to its overseas counterparts, it's far from royal."
"Pours a nice dark brown color with a bit of initial head, but almost no lacing. Good malty scent, almost deep, but no real distinguishing characteristics. Nice taste, malty with a slight roastiness to it, and an almost-hop almost-bitterness to the aftertaste. Goes down well, it's my prefered beer at Mexican restaurants that don't serve microbrews."
"D - If I am enjoying some good mexican food, this is going to be the beer I will drink"
"Nice atmosphere, good flavor, and a decent feel. Not complex, but tasty. Does feature really good drinkability. Good quaff."
"It is a bit heavy and I found it quite filling, so its not the kind of beer I would have several of at one time, but was excellent none-the-less."
"This beer is much better than the other crap imported from Mexico. It is a whiskey brown color with little to no head. The smell is somewhat sweet with a scent of molasses and I smelled roasted malt. The taste is very ""safe"". It is not completely watered down but at the same time it doesnt leave an impression on you. It is comfortable in the mouth and is highly drinkable (if debating between Mexican imports)."
"A cut above the other widely available beers from Mexico. Clear, crisp, clean, and mild are descriptors that come to mind. When I first began to explore beer the Mexican imports were where I started; they were relatively inexpensive and easily available. Negra Modelo is the only one I still drink on occasion."
"A nice refreshing change of pace from most Mexican beers. It has nutty caramel taste to it, i'm not really picking much up on it smell. This beer reminds a lot of Newcastle, it looks like it will be a lot more aggressive than it actually is. It a decent beer, nothing to get to excited over, but worth giving a try once in a while."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a decent molasses color with little to no tan head that dissipated quickly and left no lacing. The aroma is of mild malt, some roasted coffee, sweet caramel, and some alcohol as well. The taste is decent, not overwhelming in any category. Some stronger malt taste with a mild hop balance. There is a higher amount of carbonation in the mouth (especially with the limited head). This is a decent brew, especially compared to some of the other Mexican imports you can get."
"D = Good drinkability. Can easily drink this and feel like another would be in order."
"A pretty drinkable beer, and one of the better mexican beers I've had the pleasure of enjoying. Recommended."
"Pours a dark red-brown colored body, with a good sized head, that's slightly off-white, and lasting. Has a Malty aroma. A very malty taste, and has a slightly fizzy palate, but is slightly watery. Has a malty aftertaste."
"One of the few dark lagers I enjoy. Pours clear brown with a medium off-white head. Caramel and nut aroma, very sweet. Taste is bready and grainy, somewhat toasty, but not like you would find in a stout or porter. Barely-there hops. Happens to be one of the few Mexican beers I consume indoors and with my shirt on."
"It poured a transparent medium-brown, with a very thin head that lasted only a few seconds. Very little aroma. The body, thin. Very thin. And a taste to match. It's the same style as Sam Adams and I could tell ther is a small resemblance, but not enough of one to impress me. I thought the taste was decently hoppy but a bit wattered-down. I'm glad I didn't pay for it."
"Drinkability is high. Great session beer that is widely available and pairs well with the food it is commonly served with."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Vienna Lager."
"Pours a dark brown with a thin tan head. Smell is of toasted grain. Taste is malty sweet, hint of chocolate, with a slightly odd sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium, lively carbonation. Quite drinkable though, I could have several of these, though IMO there are better examples of the style."
"A very drinkable brew with decent south of the border fare. Not the mouth coating or filling beverage, but slight sweetness cuts thru the heat very well. My choice for mexican beer."
"The taste has light notes of caramel malt and a light hop bitterness, especially in the finish. Very noncomplex beer but...it's a very smooth drinker and it is very easy to put a couple away in short order. It is quite good for what it is so I can't knock it much."
"Drinkability: Drank this without food- I hear it goes well with Mexican. Nonetheless, a decent lager that can be a nice change-up from some of the macro offerings."
"I really like this beer, it has a ton of things to love; a great taste that hints of burnt caramel and coffee, a good head, and is easy to find. I have enjoyed this for years, it is not equal to many others, but it is still very enjoyable. I had a sixer of this in Sedona, Arizona and it was just perfect. Pours a dark amber color with a large thick white head."
"It still tastes like a mexican lager, but with body, a bit of caramel, and a nice malt finish, and a little bit of alcohol. super drinkable, almost reminds me of a weak bodied amber ale."
"This is a great Mexican beer.. don't like things like Corona or Landshark fool you. Pours a nice dark brown with a faint aroma, which is basically the only knock on it. Other than that, the rest is gravy. Has such a smooth mouthfeel with a nice malty/hoppy taste that finishes so smooth. It doesn't have as much flavor as other darker beers out there but it makes up for it drinkability."
"For a dark beer, it's surprisingly mellow in terms of flavor. The first time I had it, I appreciated that a lot. now that I've had it again recently, I like that I don't have to commit to it in order to have a good experience. Great with street tacos!"
"A dark burgandy with light carbonation that almost immediatly seems to fade. Little head retention. Smells of yeast with a slight under current of spices. Taste is viscous, cool and creamy across the tongue. It has a light oaken notes, with a light nuttiness and sweet undercurrent. Not a very strong tasting beer. There's a delayed, slightly bitter aftertaste that fades quickly. Drinkability is high, because its inoffensive play in the mouth, and because it doesn't bludgeon you with with flavour or alcohol."
"Drinkability: Its okay for the style, but I'd probably reach for the Dos Equis Amber or the Sam Adams Boston Lager first. Light enough to drink a couple of, but the taste isn't good enough to keep me coming back for more."
"D: I wouldn't have more than one of these, but it paired very well with my steak burrito."
"d: Every now and then in a Mexican restaurant."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a clear brown color with a small off-white head that diminishes immediately. Decent aroma of roasted malt and a bit of bread. Tasted bland, a bit bitter with a watery feel on the palate. Somewhat watery and flat. Goes well with fajitas, chips, and salsa...that's about it."
"This is a fine macro lager, believe it or not. It looks like a macro, heavily carbonated with a soapy head that disappears right away. Smell is nothing special. Dry, corny, esthers come through. Pretty decent coloring, however, deep dark red/black coloring. Tastes really good, especially with a burrito. Pretty malty, weak body, and no aftertaste. Not a bad beer."
"Not bad, but not good either"
"Overall: Even though this is a cheapy beer, its not too bad for a Mexican Ale. Probably won't order it again, but if your stuck between a Corona, Tecate or this...I would definitely choose this one."
"Certainly a little different than the other Mexican beers I've had. Poured a deep amber color, a small white head and hardly any lacing at all. Richer flavors than many other Mexican beers: malty, caramel flavors, some grain. The finish is rather bland. I wouldn't put a lime in this one (was served with one). Not a bad beer, went pretty well with the Mexican dish I had."
"Overall: marginal, average, run of the mill, so-so, OK, alright, fair to middling, ..."
"probably my favorite dark beer, next to newcastle of course. first time i had it i was in detroit and my boss bought it, and i thought it looked cheap because of the stupid tin foil on the top of the bottle, and i had never heard of it. so he let me try one of his and it tasted just like it smelled DELICIOUS! about a week later i had to pick some of it up it was that good."
"I've had this a lot before, but usually when I get Mexican beer I'll go for the lighter ones. After revisiting it however, I might start getting this instead."
"Pours a light brown with a quickly receeding one-finger head; smell is faint but decent - at least it isn't metallic or grainy like other cheap imports south of the border. Light to medium-bodied, this beer goes down smooth while delivering a little bit of a hop bite. Some semi-sweet malts in there, but they quickly fade for a somewhat dry backbite. A nice beer to enjoy on a hot day, nothing else."
"drinkability - Very easy drinking, not bad for a lager. I was surprised. I didn't think I was going to like this and I did."
"The aroma is deceiving. Taste is of yeast, bitter hops, and... alcohol fumes. Odd since this is not a high alcohol content beer. I do not find the fruity sweetness presented in the aroma anywhere in the taste of this brew, which surprises me. Finishes with a distinct alcoholic flavor, and the tiniest bit of hop bitterness. I am not inclined to try this again."
"D: reasonably high drinkability. Not overwhelming or heavy and very enjoyable. would go good with grilled foods...."
"Poured to a small head that faded pretty fast. Not much lacing to brag about. Light brown in color. Smelled very light. With hints of malt and caramel. Not a heck of a lot of taste going on here. Slightly sweet with malt. Felt very thin in the mouth. Carbonation I thought was okay. I like to try new beer as everyone does, but so far im not a big fan of Mexican beers. Maybe its the water. I dont think I would make this a session beer."
"This beer along with Bohemia are the only really good (common) Mexican imports. You can't go wrong with either - with or without Mexican food."
"My friend and I discovered this beer during a spring vacation in a little town about 120 miles down the coast of Baja California, Mexico. This was the only beer we could find down there that wasn't like Tecate of Corona. Very smooth and tasty. The color is a dark amber and the beer poured great into a glass from both bottles and from the tap. Of course once we got back to the states I realized that most of the grocery stores around here carry this beer, perhaps I never noticed it before. Anyway this is truly my favorite mexican beer, one that I have fond memories from."
"D: Could happily quaff several of these session beers - and without the citrus now!"
"Pours a dark amber with some nice red highlights and a soft bone head that leaves some spotty lace as it vanishes.The nose smells like an old wood trunk,some caramel notes are in there as well.This has more flavor than others I've had from across the border,not a lot of flavor,just more than I am used to.Some lightly toasted breads,and nice subtle nuttiness,maybe some almond and vinnila(nice).The moutfeel is very light and smoothe even velvety.My first time having the Negra was enjoyable,now I need Fajitas!"
"This is a pretty good beer, and a great example of Vienna lager. It's malty, clean, and crisp, great for a hot summer day."
"D - Of the choices available there, it worked out pretty good, but I won't be adding it to the fridge anytime soon..."
"This is a good summer session beers. Refreshing and crisp. It has more flavor than Corona or Dos Equis. Good with or without a lime. Tastes (and pours) a bit like cola soda. Dark malts with light hop presence. Not all beers need to be complex or extreme. Sometimes, its nice to just have something to just kick back with that is still much better than most macro swill like bud or coors. This is probably my favorite mexican beer."
"D - easy to drink. it won't blow you away with its new and fantastic taste, but I can see taking 3 or 4 away in a night and being happy with that."
"Recommended..."
"Served on tap at the Riu Palace in Playacar. At many of the bars in the resort, it was served too cold, but that's okay considering the hot weather. Looked great, be it in a normal glass or a (gasp) hard plastic 10oz glass at the swim-up bar. Hard to tell the smell really, I think they don't quite know what beer-clean means. Taste was okay if it wasn't freezing, and it was very drinkable, many after the other.. Glad the resort was all inclusive, or I might have spent a fortune!"
"Overall an average beer. Would not drink it much outside of a mexican restaurant."
"Very drinkable dark beer for the warm weather. This beer doesn't have a ton of taste, which makes it go down nicely in the warm weather, but there is also enough flavor to it that it does not get boring."
"Definitely something to choose if you are looking for a very drinkable dark beer, a place to start for folks who are more used to light beer and excellent pairing with meals."
"A decent brew."
"D: Probably the best beer you will find in your average Mexican restaurant, I'd choose it over Sam Adams if the flavour is as good as I had it tonight."
"Drinkability: one of my favorites. I could drink this over and over."
"Not bad overall, there is definitely worse stuff out there. Pretty good for a macro offering."
"Thought I would try something different than a Corona at the Mex. restaurant. Heard good things about this beer. Came with a frosty glass, which I allowed to get closer to room temp before I poured. Minimal head that dissipated very quickly. Slight lacing. Sweet smelling. Mid to high carbonated. I felt bloated after drinking, which left me very burpy. Finished a little bitter, but had light to medium body to it. Very drinkable beer (if you don't mind the bloated feeling). Not that impressed."
"D - Very drinkable lager w/ nice dark malt and mild sweetness overall. The woody hops and toffee like malt w/ milky tinges is very easy to quaff. A very good Mexican beer compared to most I drink this with quesadillas often"
"viva la mexico. my favorite mexican beer. appearance is a dark reddish brown. it taste of sweet malts with a little nuttyness. very drinkable beer on a hot day or with a dinner plate. i prefer no lime, i dont understand the lime thing. Maybe because i accually like beer, but i dunno."
"An okay beer, I usually opt for this when in a beer mood at a Mexican restaurant. It's nothing great, but it's the best Mexican beer I've ever had, which isn't saying a great deal. Pleasantly undemanding, I guess I could call it."
"D - I could probably drink quite a few of these at a time, though I'm seeing it as more of a meal beer. It's flavors are all over the place, and the mineral taste is a bit rough."
"D- drinkability is exceptional with a light body like most Cerveceria Modelo brands"
"good drinkability. it's malty yet refreshing, and quite good for what it is. great with mexican food."
"Great with Mexican food or on it's own; just keep the limes out of it, and you'll be good. Great for chillin' on a mid-spring night with a fire going."
"A very drinkable dark beer and much better than most Hispanic beers. I take this every time over any other Mexican/South American beer... unless I really am in the mood for a Corona with lime (I know, it's lame)."
"Tasted like a dark Budweiser. Drinkable, but at least worth trying when eating at a popular mexican restaurant. It is easily drinkable though, especially paired with a couple margaritas and queso because it matches a spicy flavor well. Probably one of the better south of the border beers."
"Despite the lack of visible carbonation, it actually felt pretty good in the mouth which did compensate a little for the flat taste. That"
"D - if you want a Mexican beer, this one beats having a Corona."
"order this one and the resturant staff will look at you as one of them not a tourist."
"D- Easy to drink and goes well with Mexican food. Its usually my first choice at a Mexican restaurant since it actually has some flavor."
"D: This is my default beer at a Mexican joint. I can drink these all day. Nothing special but tastes better than an American macro or Corona."
"Better than Corona, in my opinion. Equal to a Dos Equis."
"This goes down smooth and it's easy to drink. Definately a good beer to have when you're ready to pound a few down."
"So in conclusion this beer actually tastes pretty good, against all odds. Not sure about the carbonation but I got over it after a few sips."
"D: A decent option, especially when at a Mexican restaurant and the only options are this and Corona."
"I also disliked the foil on the bottle spent to much time trying to peel the foil off the bottle . The overall taste was slightly above average I had no idea what to expect with this beer but it lagged a little in overall to light a mouthfeel to be an enjoyable dark beer to much dark malt flavor to be very drinkable I am sure many people enjoy this beer but it is not on my list of beers to try again"
" Sorry, but this was a drain pour."
"It's about the lightest tasting darker colored beer I've ever sampled. It's by no means a dark beer and definitely not worth the near $2 I paid for the bottle."
"Poured into a pint glass was not impressed with the appearance, head was nonexistent color dark amber, carbonation was slow growing. Smell was of brown sugar, mix of dark malts and slight hopped background. Taste was descent nothing impressive, flavor similar to the smell more pronounced though. Overall decent beer I would say very drinkable. Pretty good microbrew rather have this with a Mexican meal then a Corona."
""
"Drinkability: Amazing with tacos, spicy foods, and grilled food"
"I was never into Mexican beer but Negra Modelo and Bohemia have impressed me a lot and I have been a regular customer as of late."
"Had 5 of these at a friends house along with a bunch of appys. Turns out this a real food friendly vienna with enough complexity to make among Mexico's best beers(those commercially available everwhere in NA). The caramel notes opened up when the beer warmed up but alas this beer is better cold as some of the flaws in the finish show up when it warms. All in all a decent drinking beer."
"This is not intended to insult the many Mexicans who make the right choice, it is just a very generalized view that some upper class Mexicans have. I really could not prove them 100 percent right or wrong."
"M/D - Decent carbonation and very crisp. Not a bad offering at all from the Mexican beers."
"This poured a dark, translucent auburn with almost no head. It didn't have much of a fragrance, other than slightly malty. It tasted like malt and tap water, a dark lager with typical Mexican flavors. It was watery and a little carbonated with a very mild aftertaste. Overall this wasn't offensive to drink at all (better than Corona and Dos Equis), but it didn't do much for me either."
"Since most of the Mexican restaurants around here (L.A.) have this, Dos Equis Amber or Bohemia, at least I can drink something that's not offensive (read: BMC) with my food."
"This beer held true to my standing opinion of Mexican beers. I can't put it in technical terms; I can only describe it as ""Mexican flavor."" I don't know if it's the water, poor quality ingredients, or the heavy-handed use of rice or other adjuncts. This beer is ALMOST good, but not quite. More flavorful and satisfying than Corona, but still not something I'd return to. I'll stick with beers brewed North of the border."
"I had this beer at a local Mexican restaurant. The color is light brown with some reddish tints. Appearance is somewhat dark, definitely darker than any other ""Mexican"" beers I've had. The head was impressive, about a finger think, but has no staying power. Smells grainy and a little hoppy, with notes of raisins as well. Taste is grainy as well, some roasted malt, and faint hints of toffee. Has a smooth body, and goes down with a pleasing bitter hop finish. It certainly goes without saying, but goes well with Mexican dishes. I was a lot happier with it when my food finally came to accompany it."
"Ordered a bottle along with dinner at a Mexican restaurant on Comm Ave last Saturday night. Poured into a tall pilsner glass. Doesn't look like most Mexican beers, as it's a dark tan color. Vienna lager is an interesting take for a Latin brewery. No head at all, and lots of carbonation. A bit malty on the tongue, it tastes just like most easy drinking lagers. While this beer is nothing special, at least instead of filling up on fizzy yellow beers and enchilladas, you can fill up with fizzy brown beers. Something different to drink at a Mexican joint, so it's not all that bad."
"Verdict: No frills here; this is just a nice middle-of-the-road lager for people who like their beers to be a little on the dry side."
"D: Quite drinkable with the right food. Not my first choice for a session beer. A pretty good bet overall."
"Drinkablity: Easy drinking brew. Good flavor balance and good consistency to pair with dense Mexican food."
"Drinkability: Paired remarkably well with Combo #14. A decent Mexican lager (as far as Mexican lagers are concerned)."
"A standard at most grocery stores this dark austrian lager pours with a tannish head. The body is amber colored with an aroma of malt. Slight spiciness to the pallette finishing with malt dominance, not much in the way of hops and very little mouthfeel. Ok in a pinch."
"D - I remember drinking this when I was 19 years old and it was sold as an ""ultra premium"" beer at a nightclub in the city...I got it for old times sake and was actually very suprised. Certainly better than the other shit these guys make!"
"Poured a transluscent medium brown color, with a short lasting light tan head. Smell was kind of skunky, malty, and i felt like i was even smelling alcohol. I guess at 6%, i may have been, now that I think about it. Taste was sort of alcohol-ish, bland medium caramel maltiness, and very mexican beer tasting... Not that good but drinkable, still."
"I am usually over-critical when it comes to imports, But I really liked this one. Perhaps the trip from Mexico doesn't wreck the beer like the trip from Europe does. It's a nice, easy to drink German Style dark lager that isn't too heavy and finishes very clean. No off flavors to speak of. The malt character is dominant, but not obtuse. It's a good buy."
"Overall: Very pleasantly surprised at how good this beer was."
"d: an ok beer; certainly what i would order in mexico."
"poured a 12 ounce brown bottle into a 16 ounce pilsner glass. this one is dark amber in color with not very much head. the smell of sweet caramel malts dominates the aroma. tastes very nice, sweet, a bit of spice maybe cloves, perfect enchilada beer. has a very smooth mouthfeel and is incredibly drinkable."
"D: Overall a very drinkable beer, very rich and big per style drinking like a octoberfest bock."
"In all, one I will avoid in the future. Beer should be a better accompaniment to any meal, especially a good spicy Mexican dish, than mere post-meal cascade. Negra Modelo is a letdown."
"This beer pours a clear amber color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes rather quickly into thin lacing. The aroma is of caramel malt, with a hint of floral hops. The taste has a little more malt than the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer. However, if I were in the mood for a Vienna Lager, I would go with a Samuel Adams, because it had a lot more flavor, and costs a lot less."
"CONSISTENCY... this brew is an exceptionally consistent. It's basically Newcastle south of the border. It's a good brown ale with hues of ruby, brown, tan. The taste is refreshing and simple, but is slightly complimented by honey and caramel. Pretty drinkable for a ""Dark Beer."" This is my favorite mexican restaurant beer. Next time you're asked ""Que quieres tomar"" make it a Negra Modelo."
"Almost no body. In the aftertaste the red fruits, the maltiness and caramel."
"One of my favorites from this group. I would give this above average marks for taste, color , flavor and aroma."
"D - Very smooth and clean tasting beer that despite it's stronger alcohol content than American beer is extremely drinkable."
"d: Perfect compliment to Mexican cuisine, but a very average beer. A light tasting beer with a darker color and light hop presence."
"Simple but pleasant. If you are looking for a mild darker beer with a moderate balance of roasted malt and hops, this should hit the spot. Have knocked back quite a few of these and will continue to do so when out."
"I was enjoying some pretty decent Mexican food along with this brew and the beer was a good fit. I'd definitely drink this again. Maybe next time I'll get to pour it into a glass."
"D: A one! I had this one with some chile chelas... it was yum yum"
"It wasn't very creamy and not at all heavy, and very little bitterness made it easy to drink."
"Note: An average Vienna Lager produce by mexican but you can still enjoy it with a spicy meal like Thai, Indian or Mexican as well."
"This is a good beer and goes well with beef fajitas and tortilla chips."
"D- I can easily knock back a COLD six pack of these. Too bad it goes for 14.99 for a six pack out here."
"Drinkability- Not a bad but I like this with Mexican food but I can chill and drink a few of this any time."
"This is my old standby in mexican restaraunts, I thouroughly enjoy this one along with Bohemia. The taste is smooth going down, and possibly my favorite dark beer. This is best served with spicy mexican food, or just on a day outside in the heat. not too bad by any means."
"Pours a clear orange/amber, thin off white head forms, settles to a thin layer and ring, few lace spots, kind of decent looking. Smell is sweet and malty, honey, bread, bit of floral, light grains and brown sugar. Taste is very light, some corn and caramel, light grains, sugar, very bready almost biscuity finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Pretty easy to drink, definitely better than other macro lagers."
"Overall, a drinkable brew but nothing too exciting. I haven't had this for a long time and was expecting more."
"Smooth, full body with the right amount of carbonation. By far the best of the Mexican beers and a damn fine example of a Vienna lager. An easy choice when amongst limited selection."
"I recall first having this beer at Xiaolong's place when I was back in Cali; one of them in the house brought back a bottle from the company which orders that beer as a staple.. Back then I was not yet into beers and the only craft beer I have ever had then was Widmer's Hefe. When I tasted the Negra Modelo I was actually quite impressed. I was sure that was a mark above most macros and it sure was. I also recall that back then I felt that the bottle looks pretty different and was attractive with the gold foil and gold yellow label. Since my venture into beers, I have been trying to get this beer again but to no avail till I went on a trip to Hong Kong. I saw and instanteneously bought a bottle of the Negra Modelo from the shopping center in Times Square over at Causeway Bay, Hong Kong. I placed it in my check in luggage and successfully brought it back to Singapore together with a Sierra Nevada Stout. Back to the Negra Modelo, I served it in my Sam Adams globe pint glass and it pours out red brown with a 1 inch thick head that quicky recedes to a thin and clinging layer of creamy head. The smell was mainly malts and some hops aroma. The malts exuded a slightly burnt smell. The taste was mainly malts as well and slightly hoppy at the back. A very slight burnt maltiness gives it a dark lager kind of taste though not exactly.. But not as exciting as I was hoping it would be. Some hops following the strong malts and a dry finish follows. The after taste was again a flood of rich dark malts with a light citrus backing. Mouthfeel on this one is medium bodied with a creaminess to it that sets it apart from the macros. Smoothness was definitely there on this one. The carbonation starts off overly strong but as it warms, carbonation drops considerably. This beer is better when it was colder; do not let it sit around too long like I did."
"Nice smooth texture, the carbonation is pretty fine. Certainly drinkable. A nice versatile food beer. Matched well with some broiled mackerel."
"Smell was mostly malt, caramel and toasted. Taste was was crisp, the malt is upfront with a hoppiness behind it. Finishes dry. Mouthfeel is light and enjoyable, Drinkability is good. Not overly strong in any one area, balanced and highly enjoyable. Actually went great with my (slightly burned) veggie burger and curly fries."
"D- Sessionable, the beer I drank the most while in Mexico... availability and price wise- total bargain!"
"I remember trying and liking this beer about 10 years ago, I thought I'd try it again and review it this time. 12 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a dark copper color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both OK. It smells like sweet, caramel malt and a bit of spice. Taste is pretty similar to the aroma, but has a little bit of hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is light/medium, and with a moderate amount of carbonation. Drinkability is decent too. It's a good beer that's not offensive, has a decent taste to it and is easy to drink. Not a bad choice at all."
"This beer is the best Mexican beer that I have had. I guess that may not be saying much, but it's better than your typical north american lager."
"This is the best Mexican beer out there"
"Drinkabilty was very good. Easy to drink, not a bad taste, goes very well drinking out of a pint glass or straight from the bottle during a bbq. Nothing bad to say about this beer"
"Go get yourself one a try it out."
"as far a Mexican beer goes, this is where you want to spend that $12.00. Having said that, I'd rather spend $10.00 and get 4 Lubo Baron's"
"Drinkability: Nothing to look for... nothing to actively seek out."
"Inoffensive and drinkable."
"D-an easy drinking brew. Not one I would go out of my way for. A good choice at mexican places. Not good on the eyes or nose, it does play well with a good mole sauce."
"This is actually the Mexican beer that I most often order, along with the Dos Equis Amber, when dining Mexicali. I've always found it to have a little more personality than most Corona type offerings. This one poured a brown amber color with a thin off white head that fizzed up quickly and died away equally fast. Just a bit of lace evident. The aroma is not too strong but I can pick up malt and chocolate along with some grassy bread characteristics. Most of these same qualities remain in the flavor with more of a leaning toward the grassy side. This one was not very well carbonated and overall a bit watery. The finish holds the bread taste along with some slight nutmeg spice. Generally not too exciting, but as I said, better than a lot of choices when eating at Pedro's Cantina. Goes down easy."
"something that's just wrong about it."
"Could drink a lot of these as long as I was eating along with it"
"Smells of carmel and malt, nice and dark. Malt and carmel dominate the taste as well. Mouthfeel is very smooth. Overall, quite drinkable. Nothing too complex, but a very pleasant flavor. And widely distributed too, this beer has often saved me from drinking a macro."
"D: Being a ""session""-like beer, I guess it could be easy for drinkability, but it doesn't really make me want to really explore it more. One is plenty."
"This is a decent Mexican lager. Way better than Corona, but not really my thing."
"Smoky toasty aroma with a light and refreshing mouthfeel,kinda thin but enjoyable,nice creaminess, a tinge of caramel to it,not very strong but a highly enjoyable beer....i like this one very much and will have it again and again..a good beer to sit down and relax with"
"A nice beer that pours a dark amber color, but little to no head. The caramel scent out of the pour excites your senses into anticipation. the first taste comes off a little bit malty, but the more you drink, the more caramel flavors hit your palate. The mouthfeel is good with just enough carbonation. All in all, this is a very quality beer to come out of mexico. I would drink this agian. I would also recomend this beer to anyone who wants to try it."
"D: All in all, the best beer to come out of Mexico. A must have when eating Mexican foods."
"This was better than I remembered it being from previous tastings. Not that it is exceptional by any means, but it is smoother and much less heinous than other Mexican beers. Tastes of caramel and light coffee. Aroma and mouthfeel are good. Drinkability of this is high."
"D: This is my choice when I'm in any Mexican eatery...hands down. It's a step above your typical corona and besides...I like the dark beers most of all!"
"Poured this one and the head dissolved very qquickly. The color was dark. Just like the label says. The ""dark"" was a dark brown and had a nice caramel sweet scent to it. The taste also has a hint of this and is actually a good beer. This one is not like the other mexico beers so drink in moderation."
"I was actually surprised at how much I liked this brew. Not to say it was great, but it was definitely drinkable. I am trying to get into some darker beers and this seems like a good one to start with. It pours a nice dark amber color. It's not as thick a black as I guessed it would be. The smell is not very strong but there's hints of nut and even the tiniest hint of fruit, which my palate could not quite place. The taste went right along with the smell, Bit nutty with a wee bit of fruit, a tiny bit watery,which is probably what made it so drinkable for me. I don't like watered down brews, don't get me wrong, but as I am just trying to get into some dark beers,this made for an easy 1st step. There was a smooth finish, with only very slight bitterness,that fades quickly. overall a pleasant surprise,"
"~ I picked up this brew because a group of my friends had planned a Mexican theme for a round robin dinner party. A round robin is where a group of couples cook 1 dinner. We started out with appetizers at one couples' house. Then moved on to soup at another, salad at another, the entrée at another and so on. I thought it would good to give this brew a try and I will certainly indulge again."
"D: Goes down easy, but it's not good enough to make me want another anytime soon."
"drinkability is very good, much better than any of the other mexican beers i have tried, i would definitley take this over a corona any day."
"D - One of the better Mexcan beers. I think Vienna Lagers are the best kind of Mexican brews, anyway."
"Overall: great beer. The only Mexican beer I can enjoy."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easy, not too filling, good representation of style, it’s one of the better beers that I’ve had from south of the border, but that really isn’t much of a compliment. It’s a beer worth drinking if your choices are limited."
"D-Pretty decent for what it is...a good drinker in the sun despite its darker color...works as a quencher but also has more flavor than most mexican beers...as a vienna it is not in the league with some of the german versions but I've always considered the mexican vienna's a different beer anyhow...I'll drink this again..."
"This seemed to be the beer of choice for the locals at teh resort I was staying at. It poured a dark amber color, but with real no head or lacing to account for. The smell was fairly malty. The taste was fairly malty with a little hint of hops, but nothing really noticeable. The taste kidn of reminded me of Corona a little bit, but maltier and more full-bodied. The mouthfeel was okay: full-bodied. Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. Smooth and refreshing, it was nice drinking these by the pool."
"pours a decent amber without to much head. smells malty more than anything. in the mouth its def. the malt factor. not over powering with hints of raisins and an acidic bite. not super hyped on this beer but its decent drinking. a dark somewhat malty lager with its own little character."
"D - Pretty nice. Goes good with Mexican, especially if you're looking for a bit of sweetness to smooth out and complement a spicy dish."
"drinkability- I could definetely drink anywhere between one and ten of these and have a good time. That's the logic i use to decide how drinkable a beer is"
"Pours a rich amber with a decent head, faint lacing. Smells of caramel and malt. Sweet malty taste in an average to slighty above average lager. Light mouthfeel in a decently drinkable beer. Goes great with nearly anything on the menu in a Mexican restaurant. As Vienna-style Lagers go, it's average at best."
"This is my favorite beer from Mexico; drinkable and it has flavor. Pairs well with any Mexican dish but I like with extremely spicy foods (it seems to calm the fire while still being able to appreciate the brew)."
"Got this one at a Mexican restaurant in the hopes it might be a little better than the rest of the crap they had. Pours a nice brown color with a little light tan head on top. Even a little bit of lacing as the beer pours. Nose is fairly mild, with some hints of malt and some grain. Like the flavor. Malty throughout, with caramel and some roasted hints. Just a touch of hops at the end. Feel is average, standard body for a lager. Overall, I liked this one, much better than Dos Equis, Presidente or Corona (although I'm not sure if that counts as a Mexican beer). Will definitely get this one again the next time I'm at a Mexican restaurant."
"D: This is a fine beer for a cinco de mayo party or at mexican restaurants, where little else is available. Not bad at all."
"Pours out a red tinted dark iced tea color with some active carbonation in the body and a 1/2"" head that sticks around and leaves some ringed lacing. I smell some caramel, malt sweetness, and some graininess, but this is pretty faint in the nose overall. The taste is mostly a vague cane syrup like sweetness with hints of dark malts and grain. Finishes with a bit of tea-like hops. Finish has a mild tannin-like astringency that I like. Carbonation isn't to prickly on the tongue and this has a bit more body than Modelo Especial. Can get a little too sweet for me. This is a pretty good beer considering it's from a Mexican macro, and definitely one of the best Mexican beers you can find in the States."
"Still it i a very drinkable beer. Sessionable, not filling, tastes Ok. I'd buy it again to pair with Mexican food, but that's about it."
"Spritzy Corona with caramel coloring added. As Vienna Lagers go, this is a real disappointment, though I do admit it was highly drinkable. It looked like I poured a can of Coke in the glass, a lot of carbonation. Very mild smell of... beer. Nothing to write home about. Taste was mostly bubbles, very watery, with a mild roasted malt flavor. Sadly, this was disappointing; but not unexpected, given the ""sister"" brews from Modelo. Would I grab for one at a Mexican restaurant--especially outside on the deck in the sunshine? Yes. But I'd never buy this to drink at home. So many better Vienna Lager-style beers to try (one from Boston Beer Co. being a good start). It was Cinco de Mayo... and I was in ""Rome"" so I did as all the other ""Romans"" in the Mexican restaurant and enjoyed a real Mexican beer. Viva la Cerveza!"
"gets avg points for appearance just because it is dark, and i don't even tend to favor beers this dark. fizzy head. very faint aromas for a dark beer, can detect some roasty and metallic notes. starts and finishes dry and crisp. no thick malt sweetness, very light in body like a guinness. not much going on to speak of. no noticeable hops. this probably looks scary to most people but there are not many actual beer flavors to worry about."
"Pours a perfectly clear smoky hazelnut color. No head to speak of. Smell is so faint, maybe because it's so cold - straight from the cooler at Kroger's. There is a hint of very light beer in there. Taste is very crisp, quaffable. Excellent beer on a hot day I bet. Slight hops, but mainly a sweetness sticking around. Overall fairly light though. Good mouthfeel - not sticky and good carbonation."
"A pleasant surprise. I remember having this a few years ago, and don't recall any strong feelings either way. At a restaurant with a short beer list, this seemed like the best bet. A very dark brown with a decent head. Average aroma, some sweet grain. Caramel taste with a little bit of chocolate. I thought it went well with spicy food."
"Definitely a good choice among the other BMC options at this restaurant."
"Very smooth beer for the dark beer lover. Light feeling beer with the good overall taste. Very drinkable beer, especially with a good side Mexican dish. I will sure have this brew again."
"great little beer to try, not worth a whole 6 pack but if you have the chance to try it out to eat or as a single its worth it"
"It's a copper-reddish brown beer with a fairly sweet aroma, balanced by a light hop flavor. The feel of the beer is average, not heavy, but not light. Perfectly suitable for the warm Mexican climate, as it holds some taste and goes down without trouble. Kind of a Mexican Sam Adams if you want a fair approximation, and that's not bad. Went well with my steak taquitos."
"Drinkability: Not bad at all, and given the choices on the menu, this was probably the best choice - and fit the theme of the restaurant, too, but not something I'd choose to buy in another context."
"Not bad at all. I'd visit this one again."
"Easy to drink but not much going on. If had to choose between this or a corona, i'd choose Negra Modelo everytime"
" This would be good for a light summer day or when there aren't any session beers available, as the 5.40% ABV can hardly be discerned here. I don't look back on this now with the same affection that I felt years ago, but for Mexican beer, it's about as good as it gets. Maybe I need those chips back..."
"For what is ultimately a macro, this is not a bad effort."
"must have a lime and generous salt pour but the taste is still good, can easily have as part of a session, maybe 4 or 5 at least."
"I don't know what is going on with this beer. It's unimpressive in ever category with very little flavor. Not recommended. I would rather drink an American Macro Lager, which any example of an AML actually seems to have more flavor than this."
"Not bad. Decently tasty. Quite refreshing. I dont think Id seek out another, but if offered I would gleefully accept."
"Overall impression: One of my favorites when I'm out for Mexican food, or in Mexico. I don't care what the hard-core beer snobs say about this one - I'll drink it straight from the bottle, and if there happens to be a lime in there, down it goes."
"Best if served very cold."
"12oz brown bottle. Brown translucent body with just a film of off-white head. Smells like fruit, alcohol, roasted and caramel malt. Tastes sweeter than expected, with apple or pear, roasted and caramel malt, and hints of chocolate even? No real bitterness to speak of, though there's some hop there, but just enough to offset the maltiness and sweetness of the brew. Taste is surprisingly pleasing and complex, with many different components ballancing the others. Lighter-bodied, making for a rather drinkable beer. Surprisingly good - helps redeem my opinion of Mexican beers."
"D: I tend to lump this in with Dos Equis, in that the only time I drink either is when I'm at a Mexican restaurant and I choose one or the other. Negra Modelo is darker than XX, not as sweet, a bit more herbal, and cleaner in the finish. XX, while not hoppy, is hoppier than this. Choose accordingly, I guess. I enjoy both when I'm out at a Mexican place, but never keep them around at home."
"Drinkability: dull and boring is all that can describe this beer. Not worth trying."
"Negra Modelo pours a chestnut brown color with very little head from a brown twelve ounce bottle (truly classic packaging imho). There's a lightly fruity aroma. The flavor is on the sweet side, malt dominates. Not your typical Mexican beer. Not a bad substitute for a macro."
"This cerveza pours a dark brown with decent white head. Little head retention, but it thins out nicely. Not too mention of a smell, but a bit light, tending toward bitter. It's flavor is as lighter than expected, with a subtle malty sweetness and crisp taste. This drinks well as is an excellent companion to a spice Mexican meal, in fact my number one choice for this cuisine. Very drinkable if the salsa is flowing and the chips are fresh."
"Clean, very slightly fruity aroma. General lack of aroma appropriate for the style. Brilliant clarity in a pale (tea colored) brown beer, with a small but tight off-white head. Maltiness up front subdued, and immediately balanced by the hop bitterness. My sample may have been a bit oxidized, as had some cardboard notes. Very high carbonation in a fairly light bodied beer. A middle of the road, easy drinking beer. Nicely balanced, with a fairly clean finish, but would like more malt character and complexity."
"One of the first non-BMC beers I can remember trying in my youth, and still a standby at Mexican restaurants. When actually served in a glass (instead of the usual bottle), you can appreciate the dark brown color, with very little head. Not much aroma; a little sweet if anything. Flavor is a lttle malty, but no dominant ingredient. Fairly bubbly. Quite a drinkable beer; not one I'd set out to specifically buy, but a good choice over Corona."
"Thin but carbonated mouthfeel. Very refreshing and with much more flavorful than your typical macro, especially your typical Mexican macro. One of the few that don't need a lime to add a bit of flavor. Definitely drinkable, either with a spicy Mexican dinner, in the backyard, or on its own."
"Tasted like a dark Budwiser. Drinkable, but not worth trying. What is worth trying is the populr Mexican cocktail that it can make. It's called a ""La Michelada," and contains worcestershire sauce, tabasco, salt, pepper, and lime. I had one of these first with Tecate, and then with Negra Modelo, and did a taste test comparison. I would say it's much better with the latter, and again, definitely worth a try."
"this beer is hard to review because even though it has many questionable qualities it succeeds in that it tastes decent and it is very drinkable....better than any other ready avail. mex. beer. I found that ladies dig this brew...overall...decent"
"Very drinkable,not bad just a bit dull.Would not buy this beer but would not turn down a free one either."
"Nice caramel brown color. Light tan head that is gone quickly. Smell was nothing i get grab with my nose. Nice light malty flavor, but feels a little thin in my mouth. There is also a little more carbonation than i would like. Another fairly good one from Modelo, good with lime."
"i like the presentation, stubby bottle and gold foil on top but thats where it ends. pours brown in color small head and no lacing at all. smell is fresh, taste is weak caramel or chocolate. mouthfeel is light, carbonation is good, no after taste. drinkability is ok but i can buy better for the price."
"Appearance is unimpressive. It is dark, but not compared to a schwarzbier (also a dark lager) or a porter/stout. The light refracts brown thru it...like a Scotch ale. Little head that sticks around for awhile. Flavor is all malt and no hop, but appears balanced. Not bad, but square in the camp of average."
"The taste is bland, though again, there's a hint of incongruous citrus flavour  like this is a dark Corona with the lime put right into the beer! Add the thin, watery body and I have little reason to seek this one out in future."
"Bottle: Poured a clear light brown color beer with a medium bubbly head with minimal retention. Aroma of weak malt is quite boring. Taste of light adjunct base malt with a watery finish. I guess this is better then Corona but still very boring overall. Maybe I would have enjoyed it better sitting on a beach under the sun."
"Light mouthfeel with some carbonation that is just the right amount. Finishes fairly smooth.Easy to drink. Went well with the Mexican food I had for dinner. Not an overly impressive brew but not bad either. I could drink this again if paired with the right foods. I've had much better Vienna Lager but it is a rather good Mexican beer."
"Brew pours to a Brown color with clarity to it with a tan head that had size but broke down quite quickly leaving some lacing but not much. Definitely not a black color as the name might suggest. It is a pleasant smelling brew, fresh malt along with some brown sugar that seems to give it sweet aroma. Even though it is dark in color the taste is light with mild carbonation. The malt flavors are what I notice, slightly toasty. No real hop flavors present but the brew does seem to be in good balance. Normally when at home I do not drink Mexican brews but this is one of my favorites when going to a Mexican restaurant. While in Mexico sitting on our balcony on a sunny morning, watching the ocean and listening to the waves hitting the beach all seems good. Guess I am saying that this brew has its time and place. This brew was very drinkable for me while in the sun, sand and surf. As with any Mexican brew, while at home I would not run out and get it but it does have some character."
"This beer might benefit from being served warmer."
"Negra Modelo was a clear amber color with an off-white head. The head was average in size to start with, but after a few minutes only a thin flim remained, leaving a little lacing. The aroma was lightly toasted malt and a little sweet. The taste was crystal malt and a little toasty with a semi-dry finish. The mouthfeel was fairly light with decent carbonation. Drinkability was average. It's on of the better mexican lagers that I have sampled."
"Cool bottle.The aroma was the first thing I noticed. It was a defined sweet malt on the pour. The color was a nice dark brown. Head and lacing were minimal. The brew was sticky sweet from the start, caramel and some malts. Decent body to stand up to a meal yet light enough to still be refreshing. I know its been said but its better than corona, no brainer if you get the choice at a mexican place."
"This was sweet, highly carabonated, and thirst quenching. A really great beer to kill the spice of a Mexican dinner."
"D: One of Mexico's better offerings. All things considered, really not that bad of a beer."
"Overall - An OK beer... nothing mind blowing but certainly worth a try..."
"Pours a very dark brown with an off white head that dissapears real quick. You get some malt in the nose, but it's a strange sweetness in the malt. The taste is fairly straightforward, rather clean and crisp, but with more body than you would usually get from a Mexican beer. There a tiny bit of yeast, spice, and just the faintest hint of a chocolate like taste lurking way in the back. The carbonation has a bit of a bite to it, but otherwise this drinks super smooth and easy. Going out for MExican, this should be your beer of choice."
"Ive had this beer before with lime while eating hot Mexican food, and liked it more than I did this time, just taste testing. Appearance was light brown/red, with no head or lacing. Aroma and flavor were okay, but difficult to pick out any particular ingredient. Palate was okay, but again, nothing special. I think Ill stick to drinking this with a good hot meal."
"Pours brown with off white head which dissipates quickly. Smell is malty. Flavor is malts, with some slight roasted taste and slight hop bitterness in the finish. Medium-light bodied with a moderate carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer, probably the best choice to match tex-mex."
"D- This beer was very light and flavorless with a dark body. Not to interesting."
"Color of tobacco, clear, with a decent tan head, though short lived. A floral hop aroma, bit of sour malt, caramel. The taste starts with a mineral fizz and a mild herbal hop hit. Slightly sweet malt beneath and a sense of root beer. Odd, a late sour numbing effect, not quite the same as one would get from a high alcohol brew. It's an herbal thing, a bit funky, not altogether pleasant. Can't put my finger on where this might come from. I decide it's a characteristic of the malt flavors, dark and musty. It has a short finsh, rather dry and a decent mouthfeel. Drinkable, but that one odd aspect of the taste lingers and builds, and by the end of the glass that's all I'm hearing anymore."
"I prefer the Dos Equis, but a Sam Adam's is even more of a step up from this."
"A Vienna lager with some chocolate malts, a bit creamy from generous malting. Mildly sourish notes. Medium mouthfeel. Intially fizzy white head on dark colour, and malty aroma. Better than your average Mexican beer.A tad sweet bit not overally sweet."
"A very nice lager from our Southern neighbours. As much of a thirst quencher as most other Mexican beers that make it north of the border but with more flavor than most."
"Would highly recommend, very refreshing and flavorfull. Wish I had a plate of nachos to go with it."
" Im impressed...this is a decent pseudo Vienna...from Mexico...from the brewer of Corona of all things...go figger? As pleasant a surprise as this was, it's hard to justify the price of $2.10 for a tiny 1/2 pint bottle of commercial macro lager"
"D - Has a pretty low average amount of alcohol in it, so it makes a very drinkable beer and the good taste adds to that as well. Recommended!"
"Drinks pretty easy & easily the best beer er cerveza I've had from Mexico. A pretty good vienna that lacks a few asthetics. Reccommended"
"M&D: light and loose in body and overly mild (next to bland) in flavour, only the clean and softly-fizzy mouthfeel (normal for a lager) prevents it from being a total failure. Easty-drinking for a 5.3%abv. beer? Yes. An impressive example of Vienna Lager? Negative! For this beer style, this is easily the least impressive to me so far, for its lack of body AND flavour... It really needs more, and/or better, ingredients to juice it up. ""Semi-disappointing", given my high expectation~~"
"Overall it's pretty bland, although with some decent merits as well. For what I paid for it I don't feel ripped off (for once!), but it was also a one time deal for me, there's nothing going on here to bring me back for more. And those empty bottles will be filled with something more tasty some time soon."
"metallic character comes through in the flavor as well. bready malt sweetness in the start and the finish with a slight balancing hoppiness. relatively thin mouthfeel and a medium body. above average but forgettable."
"adios amoebas"
"Very healthy beer! Recommended"
"One of my few Mexican favorite brews...cheers!"
"Overall, it didn't wow! me... but, next time I'm in a Mexican restaurant (which is not often), I might have this if I want a beer instead of a margarita. It's certainly better than the other Mexican beers I've had (esp. Corona and Sol.)"
"A nice beer, although is isn't really much of anything special about it besides that its one of the only Mexican beers around here that's decent. Tastes darker than most vienna lagers, almost bock-like with smooth chocolate malt flavor. No detectable hops, just a smooth drinking mexican beer that goes nicely with a big burrito."
"Feels medium bodied on the palate. Lower carbonation levels seem appropriate for the style. This is a beer that I'll probably buy again, however I don't know how soon, I would like to try other's of this same style first. I'll probably almost definitely buy it again on next Cinco de Mayo. The beer is good, and easy to drink, but doesn't seem to have much replay value, except for Cinco de Mayo."
"Mouthfeel is slightly bubbly with a medium body that slips along the plate."
"This beer pours a nice dark amber color with a foamy white head. The head leaves a little film but no lace. The smell expresses a strong malty backbone along with a significant amount of corn adjuncts. The taste also hits you up front with its maltiness but also finishes strong with the adjuncts. The mouthfeel is about average for what you would expect from the style. Overall one of the best mexican beers out there certainly one to look for first at a restaurant."
"(Bham UK) tried while in Tampa FL May 2006"
"Served with a meal at Abuela's mexican resturaunt in KC. Had to request a non-frosted glass. Poured into a pint glass. I discarded the lime wedged onto the rim. Dark clear amber color. Hardly any head, no lace. Slight musty malt smell. Taste is salty with a touch of citrus. Light watery mouthfeel. Overall, my impression is, eh. I think I prefer Dos Equis Dark when eating Mexican food."
"Lately I have been drinking a lot of different beers. For the last few years I've been eyeing this beer down. The other night I said, WTF, i'll try it. I grabbed just one out of a six pack. Dam, I wish I would have bought a 12 pack. What a great beer! Pours great with a decent head though, not as nice a Sam Adams Cherry Wheat Ale...;-) However, if you are looking to try a new beer definitely add this one to your list. You'll love it..:)"
"Pours a dark amber with a scant khaki head fading to a soapy coating. Nose is light, with hints of caramel malt and musty barley. Taste starts with a peppery bite, falling into a roasted, caramel malt sweetness and a bit of metallic bitterness. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Simple, light, and damned refreshing with a spicy Mexican meal. Better than I remembered. Interesting that it says Dark Ale on the label, yet it's classified as a Vienna Lager. Mistake in the database or the label?"
"I could drink these all day long. They really suprised me, as when I picked them up I wasn't expecting much. Overall, the best beer Mexico has to offer."
"Negra Modelo gets an R for ridiculous presentation. The slots in the six-pack holder are slightly too big for the bottles, which are strange stubby bottles that have gold foil covering the neck and cap. The pour is brown-amber with a frothy head that fades to a thin layer. The nose has caramel malts, slightly herbal hops, and a hint of strawberry and/or cherry. The taste is along those lines but the flavors are more difficult to pull out by themselves and there is a mild Corona-like saltiness. This is definitely the best Mexican beer that I've ever tasted and it's the next best thing to a good margarita at a Mexican restaurant. ¡Salud!"
"D- perfect. this beer goes down easy which is exactly what I was looking for as I was eating fryed Jalapenos and spicy enchladas. Perfect with a Mexican meal"
"This one might never really receive the credit its due, nor might the Munich Dunkel style, but I'll continue to reach for this one time and time again in the right situations. This is also one of my regular beers when the lady and I visit Siesta Key in Florida."
"negra modelo is great, nice way to celebrate cinco de mayo, great beer from mexico. this brewery also makes a great bohemian pilsner."
"Overall: A pretty darned good dark lager. Recommended."
"A great dark beer. I recommend with any mexican cuisine. Please PLEASE PLEASE do not put a lime in this beer, it is fine without it. This beer says dark ale, but it doesn't have tha ale lingering aftertaste to it. I highly recommend this beer when dining out at a mexican restaurant."
"When poured, the color was of a medium light brown, clear with very little foam. The smell of roasted malts, caramel and a hint of hops was evident in the aroma. The taste was of roasted malts and mild hops and the finish was very dry. Being a dry finish, it would be a great thrist quincher on hot summer days."
"Easy to drink and cooling on a hot day. Not a subtle beer, but has some pleasantly clean flavors and is a nice alternative to the usual watery mexican pilsner imitations."
"Of the typical Mexican beer choices at most Mexican restaurants (this, Dos Equis and Corona) I'd choose this over the others. Beyond that I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"Overall, i'd say this one of a few mexican beers i would choose to drink. nothing special about it at all though."
"This is a very good beer. The only beer I will drink in Mexico. It tastes sweet and leaves your mouth with no unpleasent after-taste. It has a mellow amount of carbonation. This beer is always my first pick over the other dark beers that you would find at your local supermarket."
"Speaking of style beeradvocate lists it as a Vienna Lager and many people have referred to it as a lager but on the bottle it refers to itself as a ""dark ale"" (it will be on the front of the label below and to the right of the name). Odd."
"D - Not bad. Starts off a bit weak, but it picks up halfway through glass."
"Very drinkable. Much better flavor than some of the other popular Mexican beers."
"Opinion: Well, I have been on a mission tonight to try all of the commercial Vienna lagers available to me, and this one has been the best so far. It has a noticeable toasty malt presence that was lacking in other examples. A Vienna beer isn't huge, but I would have liked to have had a bit more of the malt presence that there was here without the dark caramel flavors. If I were to make a suggestion to the brewer, it would be to use lighter colored crystal malts, no roast, and maybe substitute a bit of Munich for some of the Vienna malt. Still, this is a pretty approachable beer."
"If you're in Mexico though it isn't bad choice. Bohemia is better but this is a good second choice."
"One of the best beers from Mexico and I'm glad that it's available in Maine. And fairly easy to find. Pours a clear brown caramel color. Smell is a bit sweet but not overwhelming. Taste is a sweet malt flavor, not overpowering but there, very little hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is a bit thin but not too watery. Overall it's very drinkable. I like this, this is the first time in a while I've had Negra Modelo, will have to buy this more often. It's a nice beer to enjoy as a session beer or refresher, or a nice night cap too."
"I am a huge fan of mexican cuisine and this beer is my favorite to compliment it. Just don't let them put a lime in it, it completely kills the decent tastes that are in there."
"Drinkability: Not offensive but nothing special"
"I seem to recall a time when NM was in fact darker, more full-bodied and full-flavored. This could just be my revisionist memory or it could be because, relative to all that BMC, it actually does have those traits. I will let the public decide."
"12 oz. foiled cap bottle pored into a mug. it pours a pretty nice dark red with some orange hightlights. good white head with good retention. the smell is light roasted malts and a slight spicey tang to it. the taste is malty with a little hint of hop bitterness. a little too watery though. tastes a lot better room temp then cold. i'd say this is now my favorite mexican beer. it's nothing special, but still a nice beer to have with a steak quisadilla."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer, and like I said, great with Mexican. Its delicious flavor and widespread availablilty makes it a mainstay at hip Los Angeles parties (i.e., the ones I go to)."
" I think this would make a great beer for fussy people to like. Course I hate starting someone on something like this especially if they're going to be philistines about it or that's the only beer they'll like which would be odd."
"D - well, if you're at a Mexican place and the only choices available are your standard Mexican brews -- Corona, Pacifica, Carta Blanca, etc. -- and you see Negra Modelo on the list, get it. Its a decent representation of the Vienna style, one of the few commercial examples I know of, really."
"This beer poured a clear, amber brown color into my way overchilled mug. I had to wait several minutes for the beer to warm up before my first taste. The smell is malty and a little nutty also. Taste is quite good for a mega brewery, with notes of chocolate, caramel and malty sweetness. There is just a hint of hop bitterness, but not much. At many Mexican restaurants, this is the only decent beer on the menu. Worth a try."
"M & D: Mouthfeel is ok for this dark lager. Not very heavy malts, but they are the only flavor you get. Great session beer, especially if you are at a Mexican restuarant or in Mexico on the beach. Goes perfect with a burrito."
"Pours a deep ruby brown with thin creamy head that fades away to a thin lace. The aroma is a little malty and a little yeasty, but very faint. Slightly estery. The taste is very sweet/malty. Some roast coffee flavor. Not much in the way of hops or bitterness, just enough to balance out the sweetness and finish clean. The mouthfeel is very creamy with a little carbonation scraping of the tongue. All in all, it's very drinkable. Good finish, good flavor, but not too strong. Easily a session beer."
"By far the best beer I had on my trip to Mexico (which sadly isnt saying much). I cant believe the same people that make Corona make something this good. I highly recommend it."
"This is only example of a vienna lager I've had. It pours a dark brown with the usual lager head. The malt flavors are pretty simple and taste like caramel a little and it has a typical german lager understated/balanced hop flavor. Has a slight taste of yeast which I tend to appreciate so as to know that I'm drinkin' a beer. Decent beer. I don't know how much it is but assuming that it has to compete with other more popular mexican beers, it's dark, and it is a macro, the price is probably reasonable. I'll definitely pick some up the next time I have nachos."
"It's a good dark lager and one of the best Mexican beers."
"Smelling a bit sweet, this is a really smooth beer to drink, also. Smooth & creamy. Sweet carmel taste when it first goes in, and the warm rising of vapors from the back of my tongue a moment after and lasting a bit. Just a little bitterness, but this is mostly a smooth & sweet beer that I look forward to enjoying again."
"I've always thought this beer was a little underappreciated and maybe greater than the sum of its parts. Perhaps I just love the flavor of Vienna malt. Maybe Negra Modelo isn't the best in its style, but it's crisp and has a nice vienna malt character and flavor. Another thought has to do with freshness. I'm reviewing it now from southern arizona and wonder if the freshness diminishes as it travels further from it's home. It seems a bit better here than up north."
"Drinkability: Lime not necessary nor wanted. Probably the best beer from Mexico that I have had. Worth a try, particularly when eating Mexican food."
"When poured from the bottle, the deep garnet beer raises a short tan head of loose bubbles that disappears in the blink of an eye. There was no lacing and only a few excited carbonation lines. The smell is sweet and vaguely roasted, but mainly clean. The sweetness comes through up front and is followed by some nice, hops crispness, leaving the palate ready for the next drink. The carbonation is vibrant and the body is relatively light. Pairs well with the food at my local Mexican restaurant and is quite drinkable."
"I like well-crafted, balanced beers and Negra Modelo is one of my favorites when I'm in the mood for a moderate-strength, dark lager. I think this beer suffers, image-wise, from it's association with other Mexican beers (which are mostly, let's face it, swill). If it was called Modelobräu, and imported from Germany, it's score would jump much higher."
"I drank this out of an oversized wine glass. it poured a translucent dark amber color. The head was small and had little lacing. It had a coffee smell with hints of toffee. Not too malty to my taste. Somewhat sweet, maybe brown sugar. Nice carbonation with a sort of thin mouthfeel. It is overall an ok mexican beer, better than most I have had"
"One great thing is that the bottles are good for home brewers; they are an interesting shape and reseal well."
"No real hop flavor, but a decent amount of malt."
"Overall, this is an ""eh"" beer. I like it all right, but don't buy it for home consumption. I'm glad I only bought a single."
"Nice bottle presentation too  gold wrapper and a quality look."
"Pours an odd shade in color. Highly transparent yet very dark brown. It has an off white fizzy-looking head. The smell is carmelly and malty. Initial taste is great, very malty and quite refreshing. The aftertaste is somewhat of a letdown as it moves towards a bready, yeast taste. The high levels of carbonation hide the thin mouthfeel. I'd give this beer an average drinkability."
"Much better than the typical Mexican pale lagers... The only Mexican beer besides Dos Equies that I'd get at a Mexican restaraunt."
"Poured into a plastic water cup at Qdoba. How authentic. Negro Modelo smelled and tasted like a typical lager, all sweet maltiness, except for a hint of a medicinal/Band-Aid quality in the taste. The flaw wasn't enough to drag it down too much, but it wasn't going anywhere other than average anyway. On the plus side, the queso chicken burrito I had was excellent."
"What this beer lacks in complexity, it graciously allows the food to accomplish, and that is more than can be said for a lot of beers. Drinkability high."
"I have a soft spot for Negra, since I used to drink it at my favorite burrito place in Chapel Hill, and it was an after-morning exam go-to beer. Still, it's fairly plain and generic."
"This is a pretty good Vienna lager and possibly my favorite Mexican beer. It is supposedly not an all-malt brew, and while that hurts the character somewhat it also makes it highly quaffable. This comes in handy when it is paired with copious amounts of spicy Mexican food as it was meant to be."
"i try this beer in the party of my birthday, is very good when is frozen in ice bar, only not have the same properties of the presentation on bottle, but its fight to gain my admiration, like a beer on tap, its brewery put much attention in its delivery, carefully installed its system of tap."
"notes: Easily sessionable, nice flavor, this could be a nice transition beer for the girls or pussies."
"Crisp and refreshing."
"Dark colour, but a little clear. Although it has a good name in MExico, the truth it is sometimes mistaken between a Vienna and a Dark lager. I think it is both, but it is considered a strong beer here. That means that the efforts won't be further, not because of the brewery, but because of the consumers."
"Not as complex as Sam Adams lager but more approachable and more drinkable in my book."
"It is a simple, smooth beer. Easy to drink and great at a ballgame with the chips and salsa. More character than your normal, watered down cerveza."
"Notes: very good by itself or with any mexican food"
"Highly drinkable."
"I found this beer very drinkable, especially with food but not bad alone either. It goes down easy, quenches spicy spots in the mouth, and stays good to the last sip, to rip off Maxwell House."
"Pours a brilliantly clear ruby color when held up to the light. It is topped by a frothy, though quickly disappearing tan colored head. The aroma is slightly malty with a hint of caramel in the finish as well as a light herbal character & fruitiness (strawberries) that seem to be mostly hop derived. As expected the aroma is fairly muted & subtle. The beer is lightly sweet with apparent notes of sweet cherry candy, and light caramel. The beer has a light herbal character and a certain light astringent bitterness in the finish. This beer is fairly simple and subtle, but that is pretty characteristic of this style of beer. This beer really has a soft spot for me, and I quite enjoy being able to order this beer at Mexican restaurants, where it is usually the only beer with flavor."
"This is drinkable but boring beer. I wouldn't look for this, but if it were handed to me I could enjoy it anyway."
"Pours a dark reddish copper, with very good clarity. Two fingers of off-white head are dense, and retain well. Small patches of weak lacing will remain. Toasted vienna and amber malt nose. Hint of noble hop aroma. The taste is sweet with dextrine and crisp with pilsener and a vienna malt flavor rounds it all out. Medium body, with tiny bubbles of carbonation and ample dextrins giving it a smooth mouthfeel. Mild hallertau or perle hop aftertaste cleanses the palate, although it its a bit too obvious. However, a residual sweet finish makes for an otherwise decent balance with above average drinkability."
"Fora Mexican beer I have yet to find one better. A nice dark lager with and plush white head and some lacing. Make sure you are not served with a lime as this will interupt the enjoyment of this beer. Smells clean like a good lager but I pick up a little maltyness and grain. The taste is a clean lager with a bit of chocolaty caramel notes tossed in with a background bitterness. It is smooth drinking and your best bet at a Mexican joint."
"Lighter side of medium bodied with a somewhat grainy mouthfeel. Not as bad as I anticipated."
"I have had this a few times, but it particularly stood out recently. Looks brown with mohogony and golded high lights. Pours a rich, loose head that is just off white. Smells toasty, malty, and a little like butter popcorn. Tastes malty clean, hopped only for balance in flavor and bittering. A little bready, buttery, toffee like. Creamy body that remains quite soft. Finishes sweet and clean."
"Pours a dark amber color with a small white head that dissapates almost instantly. Smell is lightly sweet malt, slightly fruity esters, and a diacetyl background. Taste is a clean graniness with a hint of buttery diacetyl, pretty standard mexican dark lager, better than corona (or corona clones) for sure, i would pick this if they didnt has dos equis. The mouthfeel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation, and the drinkability is pretty high also."
"And it wasn't bad, either. Looked pretty, and the olfactory elements came together to make it a very crisp, refreshing beer. With just the meresty touch of adjunct, it had enough quality going on to make it worthwhile. And man, they go down smooth, and they go down plentiful. And best of all, now I know what I have waiting for me when I go to Playa del Carmen later this month. it may not be great, but it certainly does its job, which means it brings something decent to the taste table, and it quenches nicely."
"A great dark Mexican beer. It is a dark chocolately brown color, very smooth texture with a full body flavor, and has a little bit of a sweet taste to it. It is definitely one of the most robust beers to ever come out of Mexico.I guess its not known as the ""Cream of Beer"" for nothing."
"Although there is not a lot going on here for some reason this is my favorite out of all the Mexican beers. I could drink this all night and enjoy every one. It washes down the chips and salsa, the fajitas, the enchiladas and anything else you want to put in front of us. A definite session beer for these two Texans."
"Poured a deep chocolatey brown with a half inch of tan head. Nice rich malty aroma, bready and nutty. The flavor is clean and malty, a nice toasted bread, with some bitterness and hints of hops. A clean finish with light body. This beer is very well made, and highly drinkable, a nice summer alternative to all those yellow beers."
"Not the best in the world, but a pretty good offering from Mexico. Easy drinking, but still relatively flavorful. Don't put a lime in it."
"I will defenitly skip this one the next time, not the most drinkable beer."
"Easy to have 3 to 5 with dinner and after it instead of a tequila. Best if icy cold."
"Overall this went down pretty smooth and drinking a few with dinner was very easy."
"Pours a wonderfully clear amber color with a fluffy squat head. Aroma is mostly DMS, cooked corn aroma, some stale grain going on. Flavor is slighty malty sweet, but the cooked corn rears its ugly head during the taste as well. There isn't a ton of flavor going on either. Mouthfeel is thin, and under carbonated. If I'm desperate, I'd go for this. It might match well with greasy mediocre mexican food, but not a standalone beer for me."
"Overall Impression: A pretty mild taste. I have fond memories of this beer, but sitting to review it Im just not being blown away. The taste is very neutral and somewhat bland, but clean. Drinkability would be enhanced with a good plate of enchiladas, but overall, not bad, not great."
"Dark amber-brown with a creamy, tight-bubbled, light sandy head. Smells of clean, toasted grain, with light malty sweetness and a whiff of hops. Tastes of light toasted malts, some nuttiness, soda-ish sweetness. Finish is slightly bitter, but mostly sweetish and caramelly. Light-medium bodied with a nice, creamy feel. What I usually order at a Mexican restaurant that doesn't have a great beer menu."
"My usual choice for Mexican restaurants. While not exemplary in any way, it sure as hell doesn't suck, either."
"It's certainly a drinkable beer and compared to the alternative Mexican brews offered at my local taqueria I'm certain to ask for a Negra Modelo again. The sweetness and medium body works very well as a compliment to spicy food - much better than some of the other bitter or watered down lagers from that region."
"Not too bad, and definately something that goes well with chicken and steak fajitas."
"Pours a translucent coppery brown with a big-bubbled head that does not last long. There is a faint malty smell, but nothing overpowering, like most American lagers. Taste is sugary, without being cloying, a little hop presence tries in vain to balance things out. The mouthfeel is medium; more than likely due to the big bubbles. This beer is meant for mass consumption with enchiladas and carne asada. Load up a tortilla with your favorite Mexican or Tex-Mex foods and try one of these sans lime. They are a nice match, as intended."
"Drinkability: Probably one of the best things this beer has going for it. Something about it urges you to have another. If it wasnt for the higher price, Id drink this occasionally."
"IMO, this is the best mass-produced brew to come out of Mexico. It pours a nice medium amber with a brilliant white head that disappears quickly. It has a nice light caramel, malty aroma with some grain and tea-like hops. A bit of adjunct sweetness comes through but there's enough malt to compete with it. Slightly bitter taste with caramel and adjunct sweetness that is more prevalent in the taste. The finish is clean with just a hint of maltiness. A great session dark brew that pairs well with spicy fare."
"12 oz. bottle - very odd shape with gold foil top and a code printed on the glass. Pours into the pint glass a chestnut color with a 1 finger off-white head that leaves a nice looking thin blanket of foam but little lace. Smell is metallic with sweet malt, adjuncts, and a little bit of hops. Tastes are subtle hops, malts, and a bit of caramel. Much more flavor than I was expecting from a Mexican beer. Pretty refreshing - I could see it pairing well with Mexican food or being a decent session beer."
"There not much to say about this beer. Pours a dark amber color. The head settles to a off-white lace. The taste and smell is very sweet and malty. Nothing is over powering. A great beer to pair with spicy food. All around this is an average dark lager."
"Drank from bottle with authentic mexican meal. A 'light beer with dark color' describes this 'Munich Dunkel Lager' pretty well. Nose negligable - (maybe better in glass) I tasted roasted malt and some hops in finish. Good carbonation. I will order another with my next chimichanga platter."
"Drinkability - Very nice aftertaste makes you long for more."
"Drinkability is very high. I have had this many times before and will continue to quaff it. Better on tap (duh), but a very good example of the style. Honestly, one of the few ""mainstream"" lagers I buy without hesitation. Also a good brew to get those ""I won't drink dark beer"" people to try."
"Comments - Not bad, but not great. I think it is worth a try, but when it comes to buying a six pack, I will pick something else. When you are at a party, and everything else is swill, this beer is worth drinking. I wanted to dislike this beer, but it was better than expected."
"Overall better than average, much better than Corona, I could imagine putting away one or two of these with a chimichanga platter or burrito. And they would go quite well together."
"This is my Mexican beer of preference when at a Mexican restaurant and faced with the typical Mexican beer selection. This beer will work with just about any Mexican dish."
"Carbonation is good - maybe a bit too bubbly for some. Good solo when thirsty for a better than average Mexican beer, but also goes well with spicy Mexican fare."
"Consumed in October 2004 in Cancun, Mexico from a bottle. Ahhhh, a very nice beer! Pours an amber, dark brown color with a small head and not much lacing. Smells of deep dark malt, maybe some nutty scents and a few hops too. Tastes a bit nutty also. Definite hops, slightly spicy hops and a bit sweet at the same time. This would be the number one beer to get if having a nice dinner south of the border. Maybe a bit too much carbonation for me, but an overal pretty good beer. Ask for this one first and grab it if it's there."
"First of all, I poured this horribly and the head lasted much longer than typical. Nice lacing and color. Glad to know there is a very drinakble beer to order at most Mexican restaurants. Mouthfeel was nice but the placed served it with a frosted mug. No smell to really to speak about. However, I could drink a number of these beers in a given evening."
"This is one of my ""regular"" beers; one that I buy more often than almost any other. It's not the best beer I've ever tasted, but it's the best one I can find on a regular basis that costs in the $7/sixpack range. I generally favor dark beers, not too bitter, and Negra Modelo fills the bill reliably. I would describe the taste as clean and slightly rich, and it goes down easily. If you like dark beers, you won't go wrong with this one!"
"Nice dark beer that poured a decent lasting head. Smell had a hint of nut and roasted malt. Taste had a hint of toasted caramel malts and a smooth hop free finish. Mouthfeel was fairly full and lively. Overall drinkability is good. This has been my Mexican beer of choice for a number of years now."
"I wanted something different and there weren't an abundunce of choices so I thought I'd give this a try. A no frills beer, light lemony, malty flavor and a bit dry. I ordered it before the meal, not sure how it would have gone with dinner, but I'm not about to order another one to find out. Wasn't terrible, but one was enough for me."
"The beer is sort of sweet caramels and lightly roasted malts. Has just a bit of carbonation and finishes very clean. Not a hop to speak of. Sometimes tastes slightly spicy, which makes me think of a weaker saison. Worth a few and it stands head and shoulders above anything else you'll get in the TexMex joints."
"In all not a complex brew (and less hoppy than historically) but from the mainstream Mexican breweries this would be one of the best and my sentimental favorite. (And what can I say, but it goes well with some spicy chile verde)"
"drinkability: very good, good session brew, especially in the warm weather, which I assume is what they had in mind, given that it's Mexican beer. not bad at all! abv, is 5.3%"
"poured out brownish in color, not too dark really. off white head that left minimal amounts of lacing. fizzy carbonation. taste wasnt bad, but it wasnt a very flavorful brew. sweet in the beginning but finished dry and a little bitter. end hada slight alcohol taste as well. went down alot smoother that any other offering i have had from Modelo. what kept my interest in this beer was its drinkability. very smooth and easy to put down. not a bad beer, not a fantastic beer. worth a try i believe"
"This is very mild beer, almost watery, but with a nice ""dark"" touch."
"Pours with a two-finger off-white head that leaves very little lace. Clear amber color. Light - medium bodied but slightly watery finish and light carbonation. Multi-sweet nose. Starts sweet finishes mellow. The ABV is 5.3%. $7.99 for a 6-pack of 12oz. bottles, available everywhere in NH."
"Yet another mediocre beer that gets praise from macro drinkers for the simple fact its from Mexico. Not really sure how I feel about it. Its not a good beer, but its not at al offensive. A bit watery and flavorless, there is a touch of carmel flavor. Hops are non existant. May be a good choice for my next trip to Mexicantown for dinner."
"Pours a deep, translucent reddish-brown with a very thin, off-white head. Not much lacing. The aroma is light, but theres a bit of caramel maltiness in there. Not much else going on in the smell. Taste is characterized by a roasted, semi-sweet malt flavor. Bit of chocolate in the taste as well. Its not heavy hopped, is light in body, and had a fair amount of carbonation. Id say that this is a middle-of-the-road dark lager beer. Its nothing special, but its agreeable and nicely drinkable."
"My memory of Negra Modelo, since it hasn't entered my mouth in many years, is that it went pretty well with Mexican food. I doubt that I'd feel the same now that I'm more well-versed in the ways of beer. Ordinary at best."
"Parting thoughts- In Texas this beer is easily availiable, but seems a tad bit too expensive considering how close we are to Mexico. Still, Negra Modelo is well worth the price and should be tried by those who want a good Mexican beer."
"Dark but translucent brown color, with nearly no head. Smells like roasted barley and a hint of toffee. Very light in body, lots of carbonation, but strangely, no real flavor. Almost an insipid lager: there is a gesture of smoothness underlying the strong overlay of bitterness. Not an offensive beer, but not a satisfying one either."
"My favorite Mexican beer. Actually has some decent flavors and goes well with Mexican food."
"Brown ale like in appearance, head shrank away but left a few wisps of lace. Sweetish tinged malty aroma. Nice malty sweet taste that hides the additives well. Does not taste as corn riddled as do the lighter Mexican beers. Is a decent drinkable beer when considering it's relatives. A hands down choice when in a Mexican restaurant and there are no micro's to choose from."
"This is my favorite Mexican, and perhaps my favorite beer from the Southern Americas. Hard to call this a dunkel lager, but it does have some complexity of tastes that place it far above Corona, Carib, and Red Stripe."
"Dark copper in color with a tight off-white head that quickly turns into a thin sheet, and leaves little lace. Clean aroma with hints of sweetness and light toasted grain. Flavor can best be described as a light Vienna lager. Some sweetness, toasted malt, and caramel are present, but muted. Light in body, crisp and dry. This beer seems like it is trying. It wants to be flavorful, but just can't get there. I'll take this over a Corona anyday."
"Disappointing. Thin, macro taste and mouthfeel. Not much flavor, and a strange, overly carbonated body. I enjoyed this more when I was watching the Mosley-DeLaHoya fight in a bar full of Mexican-Americans. At home, below average (still better than Corona)."
"-Oelergud"
"This was a tasty beer. It poured a dark red color with a small head that did not last long. The smell was very malty and sweet, quite inviting. The flavor was quite good with a nice strong malt backbone and a pinch of hop bitterness. Reminded me of a watered down double bock in some respects. Anyways it went well with my fish tacos and I would drink this one again if it were available."
"Poured a ruddy brown, no haze at all. Off-white head formed and very slowly receded to lace. Smell is chocolate and caramel malts, hint of noble hops. Malty sweetness is very prevalent. The taste hits with chocolate malts at the beginning, then a bit of sweetness, and fades with a decent noble hop finish. Something isn't quite right with the hops, but I cannot put my finger on it. It isn't unpleasant, it's disconcerting; it's not right, but it isn't dead wrong, either. Just odd. Mouthfeel is smooth with a bit of dryness in the finish. Very drinkable. Will certainly wash down the dryest of chimichangas."
"Had this brew at a well known mexican restaurant in Queens. Dark brown body with a thin head that didnt last very long. Smell was mildly hoppy with a light herbal aroma. I was surprised by the taste. I was expecting a lot less from a Mexican import. It was very malty and roasty. Light and easy drinking. I enjoyed this beer a lot and would have definately had another if I stayed at the restaurant a little longer."
"This beer poured a clear, light coffee brown color with white foam that settled to a thin coat. The smell was malty with some caramel sweetness. The taste was a not-too-sweet caramel maltiness with a hint of hops and a touch of yeast and breadiness. The mouthfeel was somewhat creamy with medium body and good carbonation kick. Overall it was nicely malty. This is a decent beer and is one of the better ones I have sampled from Mexico."
"Compared to other ""mexi-lagers"" I've had, this one is probably the most solid. Still just not my cup of tea. If I was choking on my chimichanga, it would be passable to wash it down with this."
"Not too bad. It's working well with my spicy food."
"Slightly heavy, I actually don't usually enjoy this beer with Mexican food, as it seems to injure the taste as well as fill the stomach a little too much."
"Not overly exciting enough to drink on its own, and not refreshing enough for a summer's day. Best as a companion to more interesting food. If this were the only beer on a Mexican restaurant menu along with other Modelo offerings and Dos Equis, I'd choose it. Would go great with chicken enchiladas in green sauce. Mmm... enchiladas. Cute squat bottle with a waist where the neck ends, the cutest one I've seen so far."
"Impressive, rich looking packaging in a unique squat bottle with gold foil over the neck and cap. Poured a reddish clear amber with a bubbly off-white head that receded very quickly to a scant ring. Smell is quite malty, as is the taste. Carmel malt taste with just a bit of hops in the background. Clean, dry finish. Goes very nicely with Mexican food and is a nice change from the Corona or Dos Equis I might usually have with such fare. Not a great beer, but nice and enjoyable."
"The Negra Modelo poured a reddish copper with an off-white head that quickly dissipated to a thin layer and had some lacing. The aroma is of slightly roasted malt with hints of caramel and chocolate and a little citrus. It had a pretty mild flavor with a medium body. The taste is nutty, caramel malts up front with a slight bitter / acidic finish. Overall, it's much better than the other Mexican beers I've had, but still a little ""off"" compared to a quality microbrew. It kind of reminds me of a Fat Tire."
"It was raining this morning, so my buddy came over with a sixer of Negra Modelo. It poured a dark amber/ copper colour with a minimal head. The scent was malty with slight hints of chocolate. The taste was also very malty lacking of hops. It wasn't a bad beer from the makers of Corona. I was atually impressed with it to an extent."
"Usually my dad and I don't like the same sort of beers, but he introduced me to this one, and I liked it. It poured a dark clear amber with a frothy white head that disipated. What I liked about this beer is that it had quite a bit of flavor. It had a great malt character: sweet, nutty, and caramelly. It didn't have a lot of hoppiness to it, just a subtle hoppy aroma to it. It seemed to have as much character as a Oktoberfest style beer."
"I first tried this beer in Cancun and i was really impressed because i was used to taste modelo beers that were freezing and had limes (i.e. Corona) but this beer for my tastes was actually pretty good. Its apperance is very appealing a darkish brown with a frosty head that seesm to disipate fast. Good caramel taste and some prononuced hints of malt."
"They carry these at the local mexican restaurant and everytime we eat there I have to have it. Pours a dark brown with tan head, head doesn't last to long but leaves lacing on the glass. Smell is of malts and a hop blast, a hint of roasted caramel. The taste is sorta citrus flavor with malt characteristics. Feels full but a little dull in the mouth. A drinkable beer, great when eating mexican."
"Very drinkable, try it next time you eat enchiladas."
"No nose to speak of. Minimal malt, very minimal hops. Very subtle in the flavor dept. A bit chalky in the finish. Not very pleasing. I would not waste too much time on this stuff, unless there was only macros around. Might do decently with food, but thats probably a stretch."
"This beer is decent and I would drink it if it was the only ""better"" beer around."
"This is a very drinkable beer that would pair with spicy food. Not terribly complex but still pretty decent."
"Refreshing and inoffensive. A better choice than the typical Bud parade of offerings."
"Gracias!"
"The taste is malty up front, with a nice hop bite on the back end of the palate. Crisp and refreshing, especially in hotter weather. Slightly watery in mouthfeel, and it seems to get a little bitter after it warms a bit. This is a beer that is probably at it's best when quaffed cold, paired with salty or hot foods. Good drinkability. Maybe a good session beer if you want to try a South of the border taste. Take my advice, though. Go find a nice, out of the way taquieria and order you up a big plate of Tex-Mex. Lay down a couple of these while you're munching on your chips and salsa and you will feel like you're right in the heart of Mexico City."
"A much better Mexican beer than Corona, and goes so well with Mexican (compliments the salsa and chips I'm having right now). Not many better to compliment Mexican, and I'd probably have this one again."
"Very plain beer in my opinion. Was a dark color almost black. No head what so ever. Smell was the slightest amout of malt not much of a hop smell. Taste was malty almost roasted with very little hop taste. Very thin almost watery beer. Kinda bland I thought. It is easy to drink."
"Roasty smooth dark ale that goes great with Mexican food."
"Not much to say about this one, uncomplicated, but nicely done, a good bet for a session, or for breaking up 2 more complicated brews. Nothing special, but nothing bad, and it gets the job done. Great alternative if the only others are Corona/Tecate"
"Appearance is clear dark reddish brown with a quickly dissipating head. Aroma was of weak malts and barely a hops presence.Tastes of sweet malts and a tinge of dryness at the end. Thin beer with a slightly butteriness. High drinkability leads to a very good dinner beer and can also pass as a session beer."
"i really like that the beer, while not bursting with flavor, has a nice taste that doesnt give you too much to deal with while youre eating a meal. a nice palate cleanser. like hens teeth in australia now, but if i know im off to the cantina, im always hoping negra modelo is on the beer list."
"This one pours an amber color with a small tan head that quickly dissipates and leaves almost no lacing on the glass. The aroma was a little hoppy with some small hints of malt, but nothing very strong. The body is pretty thin. This one was surprisingly easy to drink for a Mexican beer and I liked it better than a lot of the other Mexi beers I've had. Nothing too wonderful to point out in the taste, but it is enjoyable."
"Beer had a nice dark amber hue to it. Nothing like an oatmeal stout -- almost like a bock. Head didn't stay around too long. Nice smell -- a little corn. A little hops. Nothing over powering. Good taste. Bolder than the typical Mexican lager. Nothing amazing about the mouthfeel. Average. A good beer. OK to try one or maybe two with dinner, but that's about it. Worth a try if you haven't had it before."
"This beer isn't half bad but I thought it was a bit sweet for my tastes. It could you a few hops to balance out the flavor."
"Not bad for a Mexican beer... trumps most of their lighter offerings. However I just did not find it that interesting. Toffee and malt flavors are readily present but thats about as far as the complexity goes. Beer is smooth the drink. If I were in Mexico, this would probably be my session beer as I prefer it over all the other lager type beers I've had from there, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
"Not so much a dark beer as a strong Mr. Pibb, but I'm glad to have finally found a dark beer that I could drink on a bright sunny day. Refreshing, if lacking in style."
"Poured nicely into my pint, a starting cap of foam was thick, but dissolved quickly into a light rim around the glass. The beer is dark amber, and looks similar to an iced tea. Aroma is somewhat sour malty with a roundness that can only be explained by hops, though they aren't that apparent. Taste is somewhat plain, slight amber flavor, sweet draw, and flat lagery finish. Drinks like an avarage lager, despite the difference in color."
"Medium dark brown color, small white foamy head. Aroma is grainy and sweet. A medium bodied dark ale. Malts are slightly sweet. Hops are light and mild. Mild taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly malty"
"Dark Amberish pour, quickly disappearing head, soft aroma with just a touch of fruit and hops,nice soft smooth flavor, very lightly carbonated, flavor just a little timid, but probaly the best thing available in a Mexican Resturant. Would complement a spicey salsa nicely"
"This beer is nothing to write home about. It IS better than Corona but that's not saying much. Not really that dark for a dark lager. Roasted taste with a light caramel roastiness to boot. Very lightly carbonated, but goes down smooth enough. All in all not a great beer but decent enough."
"Drinkability  It was a little clumsy going down for me, but this is hands above other Mexican ales that Ive had and quite a respectable offering by Modelo."
"A beer from Mexico that can be considered a 'good' beer. It is a bit of a brown color. Fair amount of head. The aroma is malty. There is almost a complete absence of hops. A decent body and malty flavor, although both could be a bit more. No bitterness at all. Darkness is deceiving!"
"ng"
"Found one of these in the fridge, left over from a party. Pours a nice deep amber color, hardly any head to speak of despite a vigorous pour. There is an odd odor here, rotten fruit? Do I have a skunky bottle? Tastes malty and of metal. Metal flavor seems to have control. Head is already gone after two sips. Bottle says it's a dark beer, it looks like a dark beer, but doesn't have the complexity of a good dark lager beer."
"Very malty in the mouth. Finishes with a definite sweet note, really too sweet for me to drink without food. Could use a bit more carbonation, or some hop bitterness to balance all of that malt, and give some more interest. Still, a nice food match with rich Mexican stews, etc., and my tipple of choice at most Mexican restaurants."
"Finally, a Mexican brew that's not afraid of a little grain. This dark ruby brew gives off a rich malt aroma, eventhough the head quickly disapears as with most lagers. The taste is of light hops and spice. This beer has a solid feel in my mouth with a malt finish. Will look forward to this the next time i'm eating mexican"
"The smell is really a treat though, conjuring illusions of mirthful drinking sessions around a campfire in the high sierra. Pozole and beans bubble in the middle of the light. This is a beer to drink with an appetite, as it's relatively dilute character will serve well as a wash for sticky tastebuds."
"The beer pours an amber color with a lacey head. The smell is of pale and crystal malts. There is something about these Mexican beers that smells funny. They all have it. The taste is much the same. The flavor is sweet with crystal malts, but there is that zing that stays with you after you drink it. It's not a bad quality, it's just distinctive. The mouthfeel is average. There is a medium body. All qualities aside. This is an enjoyable import from south of the border. A good drinking beer."
"Copper colored. Medium head. Not all that much there, slight hop and malt character. A bit of a metallic feel to it, slightly smoky at the end. Still a good session beer, and infinitely better than that Corona swill. Good with spicy Mexican food....."
"This beer poured a small tan head with small-medium bubbles that quickly diminished.The body was clear and the hue was brown.The nose of this beer was fruity and there was good lacing on the sides of my glass.I found this beer to have a bitter aftertaste."
"Beer is easy to pair with food and may be my favorite south-of-the-border choice. Easy to drink, with a fair mouthfeel."
"Cheers"
"THIS is Negra Modello!"
"Pours a rather reddish and very dark brown tone with a thick head that leaves some lacing behind as it fades, but is consistent; much carbonation is present. The smell is very acute and citrusy with malt present. The taste, with an appealing bitterness and some sweet presence is good and has a comfortable moutfeel and a consistent body. A good mexican beer."
"This is my favorite Mexican beer. The beer comes in a stubby 12 ounce brown bottle and pours about the same color as the bottle. It has a very fine white head that complement the dark liquid. The aroma is very light. Not much in either malt or hops. The taste leans toward maltiness. By comparison to other Mexican beers, this one's taste is almost strong. The mouthfeel is light but the carbonation does bite a little on the tongue. I recommend this beer with whatever your favorite Mexican restaurant is serving. Remember the Mexicans are keeping the Vienna Lager style alive and well."
"Not a bad Mexican beer, head and shoulders above Corona or Corona light. Decent beer that does not require the addition of a lemon or lime. In addition, this beer is not bad as it warms a bit. Carbonation is good, but not overdone. To be honest, could not really detect an attributable scent with this beer. Would I go out of my way to buy this beer? No, but I would order the next time I am having Mexican food."
"Pours an amber brown hue with a moccha tan toned head, and this beer has a nice full two fingered head forming. As the lace forms it is evenly trickled around the rim, very nice appearance. The aroma is slightly floral maybe some hop aroma there, with very sweet malty sharp tones and some grainy cereal notes are also present. The taste is slightly caramel with a tingling malty sweetness that's balanced by some mild bittering hops. Some fruit tones were also present, but nothing that completely stood out to me. Medium body with a nice smooth creamy texture and a good amount of carbonation that tickles the back of the throat. Very well conrstucted Mexican delight, that I am sure pairs very well with some spicy Mexican food."
"Much better than your average Mexican fizzy yellow beer. This beer is not complex in anyway and was surprisingly lighter in flavor than what I was expecting. However, this makes it the perfect beverage to order at any Mexican restaurant, as long as it's not tainted with lime."
"I really like this beer and I am so glad it's around because I have something to drink at Mexican restaurants. For God's sake, what would I drink if it wasn't available...Corona? Carta Blanca? Tecate? Aghhh!!!"
"Good with Mexican food, but not on its own."
"It's dark brown with just a hint of red. Unlike most Mexican beers, hops are actually detectable in the smell. Also a slight sweetness is present in the smell. The flavor supplies a nice twang that also sets it apart from its Mexican compatriots. The tangy sweetness becomes more noticeable as it warms a bit. If you find yourself in Mexico, it makes a nice change from the others. It's also worth picking up at home, especially if you're entertaining friends who are predisposed to Mexican brews."
"Thanks to Janice who spent all summer traveling in Mexico and brought back quite a load of beers to drink. Nearly a suitcase full. What a great gal, I asked if she could get me a few? Well she just happened to like most of them and really wanting to bring some back."
"Pours a very dark brown with the same type of head you'd see on a Coke -- that is, it fizzes up and disappears. Very little aroma even at warmer temps. My dear olefactory senses detect a bit of a used tea bag smell to it. Pretty standard malty sweetness with just a bit of a palate cleansing bitterness at the end. A fairly crisp, easy finish. Definitely an easy drinking beer and something to look for and cling to when your bastard friends drag you out to bars where Molson is the premium beer and Absolut is ""the good stuff."""
"Still, I would much prefer this beer to most of the macro-brews that are available in the US. It did not venture far into positive territory, but it also avoided negative territory completely, which is more than I can say for most of our mass-produced beers. I would not buy it, but if I ended up in a restaurant or party where this, and only this was available, I would not despair. I'd be OK."
"I had this with Mexican in Dana Point California and found it to go well with the food. Our local friends said they stock it exclusively in their fridge. The appearance was very nice, a virtually clear very dark amber or light reddish brown filled the glass. There was an off-white head and just a bit of lacing. The beer was mostly malty in taste and smell, with some grain sense coming through against the spicey food. A bit thin and watery, but pleasant enough for the evening."
"A Mexican dark beer, almost transparent, with an extremely deep red color, no head, and fairly carbonated but thin bubbles. Appears a little thick but drinks very thin. Has a faint sugar and nut nose, the bitterness is slightly softened. Has an earthy flavor that is slightly nutty, and a roasted malt without the typical sugar or coffee tones. Some slight hop taste. Easy to drink with not muc of a mouthfeel. Its probably low in alcohol and goes very well with spicy food, but thats about all with it. Try this instead of Corona when you're across the border."
"Presented in 12oz stubbie bottle with gold foil over top. I sampled this brew with some enchiladas and refried beans. Poured a dark amber/orange color with a medium rocky head, which faded down quickly leaving virtually no lace. Nose is malty with subtle pepper undertones. Taste is slightly sweet with touch of mild hops that fade away quickly. Even thought this is an slightly above average Mexican beer, its by far, much better than Corona."
"Very drinkable with nice fresh made Mexican foods , which is were i drink this usually well its a bit better than tecate and a whole lot better than the ""C" word"
"Negra Modelo pours a transparent burnt amber color with a minimal head. The aroma is mostly of caramel and malts, with a touch of hops, but just a touch. The taste is very clean, with a surprisingly rich caramel profile. The roastiness of the malts is evident, and the hops finish the taste quite nicely. Not much is left on the finish, and the aftertatse is just a slight earthy grainiess. The mouthfeel is typical lager, not thin but not robust. The carbonation is a bit harsh on the palate as well. The drinkability is good, and I much prefered this to any other beer typically found in Mexican Restaurants. Have it with your next order of enchiladas and you won't be disappointed (as long as you're not looking for a world class brew!)"
"Pours with a quick white head, over brownish/amber liquid. Lightly molasses-sweet and malty nose. Taste is a brief wash of malt followed by some pinprickly carbonation and a bit of dryness and minute hoppiness...""nothing to see here, folks""! Very cool bottle though. A nice Mexican lawnmower beer!"
"Pours a clear brownish amber color with a very large foamy off-white colored head that slowly fades into a thick and sticky lace. Nose is quite clean with aromas of slightly sweet malts and light fruit. Medium in body and quite smooth. Taste is sweet lightly toasted malts and caramel up front followed by a bit of a tea-like flavor. Nice amount of spicy hops in the end leave a dry and crisp finish. One of the better Mexican beers on the market, and it goes very well with chicken enchiladas."
"Smell is very sweet malt. Taste is annoying sweet malt that is only covered up a bit by the hops (I think I taste Saaz). The feel is a little sticky with rough carbonation. I think people give it higher marks just because it isn't a yellow pilsener, but I would easily prefer a budweiser."
"All in all, a pretty good dark lager."
"This is the one I enjoy the most in the Mexican line. I like the dark brown color over the other Corona mainstreams. The appearance is good from the short stubby foil wrapping of the bottle to the creamy offwhite head and sticky lace. The taste starts out with a up-front hop but smooths to a lightly malt clean finish. overall good mouthfeel. We don't do mexican all that much, but when we do, this little special ( to me Bock-like ) brew is my choice."
"Well, I don't know if it was the atmosphere that I was in or the beer, but I first had this in a strip club down in Charleston. Oh well, but the beer was primo! It was dark, as the name implies, and had a nice little head to it. Good deep rich taste to it, kinda like stout light. Good finish with no bitterness and goes down smooth."
"The ""Black Model"" isn't actually quite that dark. The clear, deep copper body borders on becoming brown and displays magnificent ruby highlights when held to the light. The short, foamy white head dissipates rather quickly, dropping to just a thin creamy collar, but it does leave some lace about the glass. The nose suggests a semi-sweet and mildly fruit-tinged, lightly toasted malt. Very clean. The body is light/medium with a fine and moderate carbonation that's lightly zesty on the tongue. The flavor is reminiscent of a Vienna lager, but lighter and drier, and displays a well-balanced, lightly toasted malt with a hint of fruit and spice. It finishes dry with a light touch of caramel, a hint of spice, and an underlying hoppiness. Really well done, with alot of finesse. This, however, is a beer that needs to be enjoyed fresh. After only a few months in the bottle it's character dulls leaving a lack-luster version of it's former self."
"Pours a clear brown color, with a little, semi-creamy, off-white lace. On the nose there isnt much going on, slight herbal aroma. On the palate, there is a good hop bitterness, light malt flavors, a touch of lime/lemon, (perhaps the a couple of drops of the lime wedge had dropped in, before I removed it and pured it into a glass), tea like flavors, hints of caramel too. This brew really did not sit well, and it did not go well with my Mexican dish. I had this at the Mexican Post in old city. Average brew."
"Taste: I disagree with the previous reviews, ain't no chocolate here, senors. Of course, I'm comparing to Brooklyn Chocolate Stout =). However, this would go extremely well with HOT mexican food, a la Buffalo's own Mighty Taco (a legend in the region...if you ever accidentally find yourself in Buffalo, do yourself a favor and eat there). This has a bit of body to it, and is slightly malty... but the overall feel is just ""antidote to firey peppers without being too thin and miserable like Corona""."
"No thin watery beer here, Negra Modelo Dark Ale has plenty of good roasted and toasted malt flavor to slake ones craving for a good dark brew."
"12 oz bottle with bronze foil covering the cap and part of the neck. Poured a clear dark brown with and off-white foamy head. Aroma consisted of roasted chocolate malt. Front has a crisp smooth mouthfeel. Malt finish with a feint alcohol taste and a slight smokiness to it in the end. I would definitely prefer this dark Mexican lager to other lighter Mexican bland lagers such as Corona or Tecate."
"Last Saturday evening at a very, very good Mexican/Cuban restaurant in Philadelphia, it was just OK."
"Comments:  This is not what I think of when I think of Mexaican beer, and Im happy about it. This is a great session beer as it goes down like an amber ale but without ale charecteristics. Smooth, clean and balanced. I just wish the taste wiuld stay a little after. typical lager aftertaste is there then goes away leaving me wanting another sip of something. Caramel is the sweetness."
"Went to a Mexican Restaurant today for lunch. It was a ""proper"" one said my work colleague, because it had Mexican beer. He told me I would enjoy it. He proceeded to babble in Spanish before we even sat down and a glass of dark beer arrived right on que. It's looks so reminded me of an atoned version of the dark spicy beer on sale at the U Fleku in Prague, probably the handled Pint Glass, a good start then. But it did look very good, and had a deep brown head. It was a very, very dark brown beer, not quite black on examination. Not much aroma though, probably due to the low temperaure at which it was served (frosted glass - I hate that!!). But oh, so smooth, really smooth, with a better mouthfeel than most dark beers, but yet at the same time it tasted and drank light, weird. Malty start, Chocolate mid-taste and a short mild-bitterness in the finish. Some caramel as it warmed. It went exceptionally well with the spicy food, and I for one will try it again - albeit a bit warmer next though."
"The first time I had ""Negra Modelo", was my first trip to Warez, which was my first weekend at ""Fort Bliss", in El Paso Texas. I liked it then, and I still like it, while my taste has changed more often than ""Venom will change diapers the next few years", it still is a semi-regular in my ""DBF"". Deep garnet in color, the head is light chocolate, but dissipates a bit quickly, the lace is adequate. Nose is malt, light hints of caramel. The front is sweet, the top is light, the finish is moderately carbonated, dry, lightly hopped, but a very drinkable beer, and it does go good with the spicy food in the country of origin, and I don't mean that ""Olde Gringo"" stuff. Ranks #907 on my current 1000 beer master list."
"ten times the beer that corona ever will be. i have a new respect for mexican beer after this one. a fine dark that went down great and was just what i wanted. not too heavy at all as it had a fine little hint of roastiness in the backround."
"One of my favorite mexican beers.  Pours an attractive copper color with a moderate tan head. Sort of a fresh bread smell.  The taste is dry breadlike with a cedary peppery flavor.  Not too strong but fairly enjoyable. A moderate mouthfeel.  Available at most Mexican restaurants and usually the best one there."
"Clear brown in appearance with very little head. Not an overly complex beer but the balance of malts and hops is good. For a dark beer I was disappointed that there wasn't more flavors."
"This is a decent Mexican beer.  It doesn't blow you with complex and fascinating flavors, but it doesn't need a lime to be tolerable (like some other Mexican brews).  It has a nice malty flavor with a little bit of hoppiness.  Goes well the Mexican food it is probably almost always accompaning.  An enjoyable brew,  I probably wouldn't buy it to take home (maybe if my wife is making her enchiladas) but It's one of the two or three I'll have at Mexican restaurants.  I also love the the marking on the label calling it an OK + Dark Ale.  Except the ale part that is a perfect description."
"Deep copper red color with a modest off-white head, fades to a thin layer, thick lace coats the glass.  Good carbonation, lots of fine bubbles rise slowly to the surface.  Aroma is rich and malty with understated hops.  Mouthfeel is good, with only a modest sting from the carbonation.  Taste begins with mild roasted malts, bitter, though not overpowering, hops soon come into play, finish is a bit dry.  A decent, competent brew."
"If you are at a Mexican restaurant, please get this instead of Corona. Coppery colored and not very hearty for a darker beer but I can't complain too much, as it went great with my enchiladas."
"Everything is adequate here, not bad, but nothing special.Give it a shot.  Cheers."
"Dark amber body, with a big bubbly head.  Decent head retention.  Not much aroma, slightly malty with a bit of hop spiciness.  Caramel malt flavor is very mild, but increases as the beer warms.  Good offset to Mexican food heavily laced with Cholula, but that's about it.  Too heavily carbonated, but tolerable."
"Negra Modelo is a moderately above-average lager disguised as a good beer. Sure, its got a little malt sweetness and a discernible hop finish, even an aroma one might describe as toasty if they had never smelled roasted sweet corn. Nevertheless, a beer of this mahogany shade is expected to deliver more to the buds. Clearing the way for your next bite of chile rellenos is it's crowning achievement."
"Good with a Mexican meal, and better than many Mexican imports, but nothing special about this beer."
"Pours a dark caramel color and has a 1 1/2 finger head that fades rather quickly.  The smell is a that of a sweet malty beer.  Has a distinct but not harsh bite that fades quickly with each swallow.  The hops are noticeable but quickly disappear.  I searched the flavor with each swallow but it's gone so quickly the only thing I get out of it is a mild musty sweetness that lingers.  I can't tell much else about it.  It goes down nicely although it doesn't leave you desiring more, you just don't care.  Not bad, but definetely not great.  Perhaps a decent Mexican import, but lacks alot in comparison to most imports."
"Interesting.  While I only had one of these imports, it smmes like a pretty solid brew.  The beer pours a nice dark color with a slightly light head.  The tast is a bit harsh at the first sip, but gets better as you go.  Perhaps not the best brew from south of the border, but definately worth a try."
"Though not a fan of mexican beers this one isn't so bad.  Sort of funny to see a mexican dark lager.  But from what I understand its actually a german recipe that they didn't screw up in Mexico.  Most mexican restaurants in my area have this brew, so it beats the alternatives of Corona or our mass produced crap...................CHEERS"
"Reddish brown with moderate head and moderate carbonation. Roasted malt character reminiscent of caramel or nuts.  Warms as it finishes and has a mouth coating mouthfeel."
"Mexican beer has never really been my bag.  Modelo's ability to maket something as tasteless as Corona continues to surprise me, to say the least.  That said I wasn't expecting much out of the Negra.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  It's short fat bottle is pretty cool,  but the rich smooth taste is what I liked.  This beer hits the tounge with a bit of creamy taste, then a mild hoppy bite rings through.  It finishes a bit dry and very clean.  Makes me want another."
"Negra Modelo:  This is the only beer I’ll order in a Mexican restaurant.  It is a brown lager that is very drinkable, and goes very well with hot foods.  Nice sweetness, with a hop bite.  Very good."
"I tend to order this one when I go to a Mexian restaurant I frequent called Talita's.  I have had always been careful about these type of beers, but I found this to be quite drinkable."
"A great Mexican-made Vienna lager. This particular beer has a medium brown color, a good deal darker than most Vienna lagers. It has a good malt aroma with a dry malt flavor and aftertaste. A good effort by grupo modelo."
"Pours clear copper brown, with a very thin head that vanishes is a flash of an eye. Smelled a little acidic with no real appealing aromas. The tast was nothing really to note, very thin on flavors. Maybe some sweetness from malt or baley. No hops that I noticed. Very thin, watery going down. It was drinkable, after a 12 hour workday, and free. It looked better than it tasted, the bottle is nice enough, unique shape and gold lettering, but that's about it. I know not to buy it."
"Clear dark copper hue.  The thick head quickly settles into a persistent head that leaves a sparse lace. There's more character in aroma than typical for the insipid style. Notes of toffee, biscuit malt, and rich Munich malt are discernable, but not assertive.  Rather than the addition of caramel coloring only, (real) malt flavors are contributed by crystal and Munich malt. Hop bitterness is low, and residual sweetness thus asserts itself.  Finishes sweet and clean. If considered an American Dark Lager Negra Modelo has more flavor and malt character than average for style, though as a beer in itself it isn't outstanding.  Like other European - derived Mexican lagers, it does need to be paired with food."
"The only real complaint you can have about this beer is that the flavor is definitely thin. What flavor there is, is pleasant. Little to no hops in aroma or taste makes this a very easy drinking beer. There's also a little more to the palate than you'd expect from the light taste. If you ever get a beer craving in a Mexican restaurant, this and Dos Equis are your only two real choices."
"A very clear dark brown, big initial head that calms quickly -- like an American macro.  Muted aroma at best, mostly of malt.  One/two flavor profile -- malt, then hop flavor.  Neither is extraordinary, almost deliberately practiced to be non-offensive.  Fairly good mouthfeel, helped by a lack of over-carbonation.  The malt sweetness seems to dominate but is lacking as far as interesting tastes.  An OK beer, in my opinion, but one lacking in the complexity and memorability categories."
"This is one of the more flavorful Mexican beers. It is like Dos Equis Amber but with a smoother mouthfeel and a bit of malty sweetness.  Goes well with beef enchiladas.  It has nothing on well-made English and German beers, but it is not bad beer at all.  I recommend it within the context of the Mexican restaurant only, otherwise there are better beers to have."
"Feliz Cinco de Mayo! I decided to try the ubiquitous ""dark beer"" in celebration of the ubiquitous Mexican holiday. Pours a medium brown, translucent amber, with practically no head. Aromas are not offensive, nor are they memorable. Slightly malty, slightly herbal, whatever. The taste is very light, also not necessarily offensive. Barely bitter, slightly dry, absolutely no lingering finish. If you drink this with Mexican food, make sure it isn't spicy, otherwise this beer tastes like water. Average on all counts. If you feel the need to drink a Mexican beer, though, at least this isn't offensive."
"Light overall aroma that's mostly malt with a bit of roastedness to it.  Full head. Reddish brown almost copper, very clear.  Fairly heavy carbonation is what I noted first.  Light overall malt taste with some roastedness and caramel qualities.  Finishes with just a hint of bitterness.  There is a creaminess to the feel that I like.  Seems refreshing.  Probably good with spicey food."
"I like this beer. It has a very bubbly head which quickly leveled to a thin lace. The dark color is very appealing. It doesn't smell all that great, and doesn't taste much like a dark beer. It lacks the thick flavor most darker beers have. Nevertheless, its a tasty, easy to drink beer."
"just mexican beer with a hint of roastiness and caramel or something, pretty boring beer, but it goes down easy."
"First off get that god damn lime shit away from my beer. Just leave the beer alone, it is just fine the way it is. Put me in any East Boston Mexican-Latin infused eatery or even a decent chain like Chevy's Fresh Tex Mex and I will in rare form with this beer at my side."
"Impression:Must have gotten a very fresh six pack. Oh the aroma!  Still, wish the flavor would have held up it end."
"I used to think this was my favorite Mexican beer.  I don't anymore.  It'sjust averge.  Dos Equis is clean and crisp and stays flavorful throughout the meal.  This beer tastes good at first, and then becomes flat.  Not a bad choice if you want something different, but not great."
"It's a good dark lager and best Mexican choice but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.  If you want a really good dark lager, look for Saranec Black Forest."
"Not a bad dark lager. One of the best Mexican beers IMHO. Washes down spicey Mex fare and offsets it nicely with its slighty sweet malty flavor."
"This is actually quite good for Mexican beer. I was pleasantly surprised. Very smaooth and satisfying. Most previous beers I tried from south of the border were crap."
"A very pleasant dark/amber.  Good alone or to take the sizzle out of a spicy Mexican meal.  Smooth and easy to drink.  (Hard to believe this is the same brewery that makes Corona)."
"Notes: An average example of the Dark American Lager style. No more, no less. An excellent complement to any Mexican meal."
