"Dark and delicious, but surprisingly light.  This beer is an experience that you won't forget."

"This Bavarian Dunkel-style lager has a beautiful nutty and toasty malt body. Despite its darkness, it drinks lightly. This beer is perfectly carbonated to scrub the palate without being burdonsome, has good head retention, and a smooth finish. Delicious!"

"3.75 D: Good beer overall. Good flavors with a wonderful mouthfeel."

"Overall-this is a great session beer and it doesn't taste half bad to boot. This would be a good beer to give to someone who doesn't drink much craft. The flavors could be stronger but for a lager they are better than most. 3.75"

"Overall, a nice dark lager. I prefer a bit more chewiness in the feel and a spicy instead of a citrus-like note on the finish, but this is a nice, traditional lager. If you must have lots of hops, look elsewhere."
"Got as part of a botmc. Pours a ruby brown, big head, Los of lacing. the aroma is light, biscuity. the favors are subtle, grassy,biscuity, clean finish. The beer is light in body, good carbonation. It is a good representation of the style, great session beer."

"Taste offers a surprisingly nice kick right from the outset with that sweet breadiness omnipresent in the aroma that works every part of the tongue from start to finish. The only sort of hop bitterness comes through in the middle with a very earthy, slightly grassy taste, though it's frankly too mild to be of any considerable note. Body is medium and the finish is very smooth. Given my inexperience with the style, I can't say much other than that it's very tasty, though everything seems simply par for the course. Definitely worth trying."

"Tasty and balanced, and with just 5% ABV, you can enjoy Barabarossa all day"

"O: This beer is easy to drink and makes a good accompaniment to food but seems like it could use a little more complexities in the flavors to make it a beer to drink on its own."
""
""
"O: Overall, decent.  I'm not a huge fan of the style (or lager styles in general), but this one wasn't bad.  I won't drink again, but it was worth a try.  "

"O - Nice evening beer, good for the upcoming winter months. Nice flavors, but some bitterness would add some needed depth to the beer. The aroma needs to lose the metallic scent as well. Overall though, I wouldn't deny one offered."
""
"O -- This beer is certainly drinkable and enjoyable, but as most Dunkel brewers outside Munich seem to do, the use of roasted malts takes away from a sweet, toasty breadiness that should be more prominent. If this had been labeled a Schwarzbier, I'd probably rated it all 5s!"
"stick to sam adams black lager for the same money - at least in my neck of the woods... or sprecher black bavarian... which has all the viscocity and appearance qualities that this does not..."
"Not much head formed, even with a fairly aggressive pour. Nice-looking beer the color of dark cherry wood. Smells strongly of sweet caramel with some fresh crispness also noticeable. Also tastes primarily of caramel. There's an undertone of crisp apple as well."
"Overall: Clean well made beer. That said it is not that interesting and alcohol seems too high. This could be a style issue with me. I was really excited to try this beer and it was a bit of a let down. Maybe, with some age this beer would improve."
"I'm glad I finally tried this one after seeing it so often. It's a good beer, and I could drink it any time of the year. One of my favorites out of the Moerlein selection."
"Drinkability: Average, nothing more or less. I wouldn't turn one down, but I wouldn't seek it out either. A decent dark lager. Flavorful, but nothing to get too excited about either."
"Drinkability - This beer was just ok in my opinion. I could probably drink it if it was offered, but I just don't think this is my favorite style of beer. After 1 or 2, I would probably want to move on to something else."
"This beer was watered down enough that you could enjoy it easily all night. High marks for this one if someone desires a session beer. You really couldn't go wrong if you like dark lagers here."
"Poured a nice deep chestnut with moderate, short lived head. Nicely roasted malt flavor at a level appropriate for the style. Just a touch acidic and seemed like it could have used just a bit more sweetness in the malt. According to the label the beer is ""slow aged."" As opposed to quickly aged, I suppose."
"Grabbed one o' these guys last year after X-Mas Break...decided to give it another go (as I couldn't remember it...). It pours a clear dark-ish garnet topped by a half-finger of short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises caramel, dark toffee, rye bread, and dark greens. The taste is very similar, heavier on the rye bread, with a deep orange-rind bitterness bubbling up from beneath. A splash of what seems like cedar makes its way in there as well. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a decidedly wet feel. Overall, an okay brew, but nothing fully clicks with me. Nothing truly offensive, though."
"Drinkability: Went very well with a meal (BBQ sloppy joes and fries) and I could easily have one ore two of these by themselves. The taste is interesting and grows on me with every sip."
"Very nice beer that is highly drinkable for any malt fans and a nice change of pace! Don't judge this beer by it's looks, just take a sip and start the enjoyment."
"Overall pretty tasty stuff. Certainly had an authentic German Dunkle flavor though not the subtly and smoothness."
"This stuff is really easy to drink with low and almost undetectable alcohol. Wish I had gotten a 6 pack instead of a single bottle."
"The body is of moderate depth. Carbonation level is decent. Good crisp feel. As far as flavor goes, this is one of the best of the style I've ever had. They really nailed it where it counts. Great bready flavors abound, some faint molasses, and plenty of chocolate malts. This reminds me at times of a chocolate drink. Very well-done. I could have another, no problem. Recommend."
"lots of flavors but light and low ABV. this is quite good. well balanced and well done."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer. Probably my favorite offered by my hometown Brewery thus far. Cheers to moerlein for this Dunkel"
"Christian Moerlein's Barbarossa Double Dark Lager is one of the finest Munich dunkels in recent memory. It's also something that just about anyone should enjoy. If these guys don't think of it as their flagship beer, they should."
"This wasn't bad, and it's drinkable, but I think it may have been old. I've heard it's good. I'll review again in the future with a fresh bottle."
"Value: Perhaps the best thing about this beer. Easily as good as beers priced 30% higher. I paid under $8.00 for a six pack from the grocery store. Can you beat that?"
"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a pint glass. The beer is a transparent dark brown with a modest light brown head. The head disappeared quickly, leaving a patchy skim of bobbles. The aromas has tones of toasted malts and some woodsy hops. There are a few different flavors present, there is some slight coffee bitterness as well as some molasses-like sweetness. The beer has a light body and just the right amount of carbonation; it tickles your tongue but doesn't distract from the flavors. This is an easy drinking beer that is very enjoyable to drink. It's worth picking up if you need a craft beer to enjoy over an evening, but that won't be the center of your attention."
"Barbarrosa was a see-thru, medium brown and had a tan colored head that didn't last. It smelled malty sweet and tasted similar to the aroma, sweet, grain-like, maybe a little cola flavor. Barbarrosa was light to medium bodied and had good carbonation. The drinkability was good, I'd have a few in a sitting. Good beer, I enjoyed it more than the only other Munich dunkel lager that I've tried."
"Clear, dark amber with a slight creamy light tan head that quickly shrinks leaving scraps of lace behind. Toasted malt and raisin make up the nose on this one. Bready and sweet maltiness with just enough mild hop bitterness to balance nicely. Medium light bodied and effervescent. A decent, easy drinking dark lager."
"not a bad offering, certainly worth a try from this Cincinnati brewery, would malke a decent session beer"
"Drinks great, body is solid and it goes down smooth."
"An excellent representation of the style in my book. Well done."
"Drinkability: Nothing wrong with this beer that would make not want to drink it. The flavors are nice but not overly robust, the ABV is more than manageable and the price is right as Moerlein products are pretty reasonable."
"Barbarossa is good clean beer and there is nothing to knock here."
"D - This is a highly drinkable beer. I could sit down with a few of these."
"Drinkability: A bit reminiscent of Ayinger Altbairisch. A clean, malty, dark lager that, for me at least, has plenty of drinkability appeal. Worth a try."
"Overall, this beer is definitely drinkable but I would probably choose something else if it came down to the wire. I would suggest the Great Lakes Blackout Stout."
"D: Tasty and a solid beer for session drinking. Recommended."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a chestnut brown/red color with a half-inch off-white head that went away quickly. Lacing is average. The aroma is bready malt, caramel, brown sugar, and some raisins. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's some toasted malt and light hoppiness noticable too. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, with above average carbonation. Drinkability is decent, it's not hard to drink at all. I could have this as an occasional session beer. Overall it's a decent enough beer, it's certainly worth trying if you haven't had it before."
"D: My favorite so far of the Moerlein brand. It is very available where I live, so is it quick easy and tastes good. If you are going to try one Moerlein beer, skip the Over the Rhine, and get Barbarossa... Plus added points for having a cool name."
"D: easy to drink, but not much good flavor to warrant drinking much"
"D: Another nice offereing from the Moerlein crew. Not as good as OTR Ale but still solid."
"Overall- Not too shabby. Good drinkablilty makes this a sessionable beer."
"Overall, a decent beer. Session. BMC converter. For me, one and done since not much flavor at this stage in my beer drinking."
"The taste is the very much the same except for the addition of a faint hop note. Overall it seems muted and bland to me. However it is easy to drink, and I would happily do so all day if this was the only thing available."
"Smells roasted but sweet like a milk stout. Pours to a root beer color with a muti-sized bubble head that holds up for a little while then disappears. Taste is sweet and Marzen like then has a tangy hop flavor that flattens the sweetness but with only a very slight bitterness. Subtle chocolate malt notes. Mouthfeel is silky smooth. Delicious. I highly recommend this brew to a BMC drinker who is branching into craft brews. Delicious. I'd like to clone this one with a home brew."
"Nikki"
"Medium to medium full body, with moderate carbonation. A decent example of a Munich Dunkel, but I wouldn't call this rich. Would be better if it had a little more depth of flavor as I don't really get a strong bread crust flavor which is characteristic of the style."
"D - This is a great drinkable beer. Goes down well and with the 5% ABV I could drink a few of these no problem."
"this is a great lager. this would be a fantastic session beer. this is worth seeking out."
"Drinkability: Hell yeah.... This is a keeper... I could enjoy these all day long!"
"Taste is much the same, but I get a little sweetness and some tobacco/smoke flavors as well. Medium to full on the mouthfeel and creamy. This is a nice addition to the CM lineup."
" ~ This is a good beer with nice complex characters. I'll certainly recommend the Barbarossa to my friends and wish I had more than just this one. I'm thinking this Double Dark Lager is a champion from the tap."
"This is an unusual and pleasant beer to quaff in the evening. It sports a lovely deep reddish brown color, with a thick creamy beige head that is persistent and leaves a very nice lacing. The nose is toasted malt, but rather light. On the palate, this is a malty but surprisingly light beer for a dark lager, with hints of coffee among the dark-roasted malt overtones. The finish is unremarkable, but pleasant. Good mouthfeel with smoothness and solid carbonation. Refreshing, again for an evening beer on days that are not too hot. This one pairs nicely with a good serving of Cincinnati-style chili. Overall, pretty drinkable, especially with a robust meal."
"Thanks to Zapata"
"This beer poured a very clear brown with a 1/4 inch head. The aroma is malty and somewhat cereal. There is also some slight banana scent. The taste is sweet and big of malt flavor. There is a slight bitterness which adds to the overall experience. The mouthfeel is full and there is a carbonation bite. This is an easy drinking. well balanced beer."
"Pours a clear, deep copper with a small off-white head that dissipates quickly to a ring with no lacing. The aroma has a lot of roasted malts with sweet dark fruits and caramel on top. A hint of hops in the nose as well. More of the same (in a good way) in the taste with a huge sweet caramel malt backbone and only a hint of the roasted quality in the finish. Hops make an appearance in the aftertaste with the faintest bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, and sweet. This is an extremely drinkable dunkel and a very good beer overall."
"Notes: Second winner in a row I've had from this brewery. Very clean and drinkable stuff."
"Drinkability, oh ya. Easy with the watery feel of carbonation. Though not bad, it cuts threw the dark thick intensions."
"Imo, this is a great example of the style, a style that I don't have a lot of experience with but the ones I have tried generally are too light in the flavour department. Not so with this one. Highly recommended!"
"Drinkability- Very excellent example for a Munich dunkel style. I would buy a sixer of this one for a session. I may do it before I move back to the great north."
"Drinkability - very much so. I went through several cases before I finally sat down with one to review. Right up there with OTR for my favorite CM beer. Has a great color for a Halloween tasting this fall..."
"Very, very nice. I would drink this by the literful in Bavaria."
"Notes from '08 NHC."
"I doubt that I will get this one again. It seems more like a bridge between a vienna and munich style lagers. I would much rather go for one or the other."
"D - A fine dark lager, very very drinkable for me. I just enjoy the smoothness and malty flavor w/ balance of gently spiced hops in addition to the subtle roast. To me this went down great and could be session worthy for sure"
"D : Easily drinkable. I could session this one"
"Sweet malty nose, caramel mostly. Refreshing for a reasonably full beer (more like medium bodied), it has a malty taste without really being heavy or cloying; its caramel and bready notes are reasonably well balanced by a mild hoppy bitterness that comes and goes. Not overly complex, but a very nice beer for warmer weather."
"Final Thought: Find it on tap!... it's a classic dunkel! PROST!"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Medium bodied on the palate, with what I think is just a bit too much carbonation. This is a beer I'll drink again, but I would like to explore the style much more before coming back to it. Don't really know that much about this particular style. In my opinion this is the weakest of the new releases that Christian Moerlein has come out with."
"D: Tasty and incredibly sessionable. Another good brew from CM... keep the onslaught coming, guys."
