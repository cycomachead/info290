"Picked this up at a great beer shop in Darmstadt, Germany, Maruhn Welt der Getr√§nke. Beautiful clear mahogany pour with a two finger off-white head with decent retention and nice lacing. Very earthy, malty nose with hints of brown bread, caramel, brown sugar, tea, and subtle cocoa. The taste follows suit lots of earthiness and brown bread along with hints of toffee, tea, caramel, tobacco, subtle cocoa, and leather. The mouthfeel is thinner than expected with really low carbonation and a lot of mineral character on the finish. Overall, I was slightly disappointed with this. The mineral taste was really off-putting and it was sweeter than I had expected. Probably won't revisit..."

"Final Thoughts: A good beer that I would recommend, and certainly went exceptionally well with the schnitzel and spatzle I had at the Black Forest Inn in Hamilton. Thumbs up."

"Overall, I would have this again, but I do not know if I would have this beer again."

"A decent dunkel lager, with just enough fruity sourness and latent hops to offset and balance the mainstage malt. Nice to see this repped in E-town."

"Dark brown with some burgundy highlights around the edges. Tan head with some OK lace and a film of retention. Nose has some copper/metal, dark malts with some fruitiness. Taste has more dark malts, still a bit of metal, dark fruits and some caramel and bread. A bit of graininess. Fairly light feel, almost watery. A drinkable Munich Dunkel, with medium carbonation and a moderate sweetness in the finish."
""
"Pours a deep amber to brown-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, a small roast and a somewhat malty. In the taste, a small maltiness, small notes of fruit, but really lacking flavor. A smooth and a lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a note of dry maltiness in the aftertaste. A small aroma, but lacking everywhere else, not much there."

"This is one that you just salivate for on a hot summer day."
"In the end it's a well-made, drinkable beer, but it just misses the mark for my palate."
"Try this one if you can because it showcases German craftsmanship of beer. Not a true alt yet a great beer."
"Once again,I have to remind myself that this brew was made with a strict adherence to tradition, and nothing out-of the ordinary by complexity will be found. Rather, a solid, well made traditional brew that I enjoyed. Next is the Dunkle-Weizen."

"D- Very drinkable, this paired well with the pork we had to eat."
"Had this on tap at Fredericksburg's Oktoberfest. Pour us dark brown with a tan head that dissipates quickly. There's a hint of roasted malt in the aroma, but little else. It tastes clean with a hint of roasted malt sweetness. Very smooth taste that doesn't over power you with roast malts."
"Overall very good, Easy to session, but a bit generic. Nothing really stands out. But solid in the end. Have a few."
"Drinkability: Easy enough to drink."
"Not a bad beer for drinking lots of--mild and balanced."
"Zum wohl!"
"Found this gem on tap at Ludwigs. This beer was a deep and clear dark amber-orange color. The head was thin, creamy and sustaining. The aroma yields roasted buttery grains, toffee and toasted pumpernickel bread. Roasted rich caramels, chestnut and pistachio with just a touch of smokiness. Medium bodied, buttery, slightly spicy and rich in flavor. No discernable harshness, just pleasantly sweet roasted malt. Smoky and roasted bitterness in the finish. This is a complex and satisfying beer. A real treat."
"Dark amber and clear appearance, with a frothy head of 1/4 of an inch. Simple string laces. Sweet aroma, caramel and slight apple emphasis. Nice mouthfeel, velevety with a stylish moderate carbonation. Flavor is exceptionally well balanced, good combination of malt impressions that cross into shortbread and peach preserves -- like jam on toast. Slight hop assertion, somewhat oak-like at the close, slight drying. This is no moster brew, just really well-composed and exceptionally quaffable."

"One of, if not the best dunkel I've had. If you see this on tap, it is your duty to gobble it down by the litre."
"Fast becoming a style favorite for me,nice dark brown color with modest head.Very malty sweet smelling,caramel,toffee?There was a little hop presence in taste,but the dark malt profile is the star of the show here with some chocolate and light buttery caramel.Mellow and highly drinkable fresh tasting moderate alcohol.The best beer I have had from Hacker-Pshorr."
"A deep brown on the pour, the head modest in size, frothy in texture and the color a light tan as it dissipates the lace left behind a nice covering upon the glass. Mostly malt nose, sweet, hints of caramel, clean and fresh, with the start sweet and thickly malt, top moderate in feel, the finish is moderately carbonated, the hops pleasing in their spicy presence, quite dry and drinkable."
"Had this on tap.  Pours a beautiful deep copper with a little head.  Very clear.  Smell consist of clean malt and noble hop tones.  Taste is a nice blend of smooth maltiness and hop accents.  Very mellow and easy drinking.  Nicely done."
