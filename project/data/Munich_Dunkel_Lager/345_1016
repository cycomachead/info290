3.5,-3.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Standard, easy drinking option. Tarnished copper brown color with a finger or so of tan head. Aroma of grains and malts, essentially nothing else, as promised by the ""All Malt"" label. Simple taste, malts, roasted malts, and more malts, followed by a mild herbal hoppiness. Bit of an astringent aftertaste. Medium-bodied and easily drinkable.","Rifugium","Sep 01, 2011"
3.95,9.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Aroma is deep and dark from the start. Rich dark caramel notes are all over this one. Roasted nuts, some brown sugar, dark frits, figs maybe? Really just complex as I even pull a touch of vanilla through after a few minutes. Really nice, and quite full feel for the style, due in most part to near perfect carbonation. This allows the flavor to roll across the palate and really just cling to every ounce of taste buds you have. Caramel, bready notes, hints of light spice are all leading the charge here as each sip seems to become better and better","mikesgroove","Aug 18, 2011"
4.12,13.8,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a rich dark brown, light khaki colored head forms and not a whole lot of lace. Smells like an imported German lager, Tettnang hops appear brightly along with some doughy notions. In the taste, similar hop flavor, light and tealike, a bit herbal. Dark roasted malt and lager yeast add alot to this beer, giving it that distinct ""euro"" feel. Light roast, good hop profile, easy drinking medium bodied feel. Whats not to like in this one, a great standby beer.","Stinkypuss","Mar 22, 2011"
3.65,0.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"I'm glad to see this one back, as you don't get to see it around quite as much as you used to. This just has a firm and well balanced mix of hops, sweetness, and roast that stayed well flavored, crisp, and easy drinking the whole way through the glass. At 5%, you could enjoy a couple of these and it pretty much pairs up nicely with anything.","Kegatron","Feb 17, 2011"
3.83,5.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a medium brown with some red highlightls, minimal head and lacing. Scent is mild, some hints of roasted nuts and pumpernickle bread. Taste brings a more assertive, yet mild taste of fresh bread, lightly roasted nuts and hints of spice and herbs. Lighter side of medium body, very light and watery finnish. A nice, highly drinkable and flavorful beer.","rfgetz","Jun 28, 2010"
3.72,2.8,4,4.5,3,4,4,"An interesting Lager style. Poured a rich, dark color not at all like a Yuengling lager. Has a wonderful roasted aroma to it. Taste was liek drinking a nice black coffee with hints of chicory and tannins that lingered on the tongue. Went down smooth. Probably would be a good session beer.","Katahdin","Jun 09, 2010"
3.48,-3.9,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Served up fairly transparent reddish brown with a slightly tan head that leaves good lacing. The aroma of this beer had a lot of toffee notes in and, as well as being slightly toasty with just a tinge of herbal hop character. The taste presented itself as clean, malty and smooth with most of the character coming from the malts. Toffee, caramel, light toastyness and smooth sweetness. Very little hop flavor, but a fair amount of bitterness to help balance out the malts. It had a medium body that was slightly chewy, and it left a bit more stickiness in my mouth than I would have liked. Pretty drinkable, but I think the stickiness would wear on me eventually. Well executed, as are most Victory beers, but just a bit lacking.","zoso1967","Apr 11, 2010"
3.48,-3.9,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Bread and sweet malt come through in the nose. It seems very robust but the taste calms down. Grainy taste, malt, but not the kind that tastes bad. This is ""fresher"" than most lagers I've had. No old sock taste to it. Semi-sweet, a fairly good finish. I'd have it again, but would prefer a PA or something with some bite.","Mebuzzard","Mar 14, 2009"
3.85,6.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,5,"Bready, toasty, simply liquid bread. Richly colored brownish amber with simple head. Nose is again bready with a hint or vanilla icing. Taste is almost sweet with toasty and nearly deeper roasted notes. Really nice but little mid palate and a meager finish. Good mouthfeel and as for drinkability, the growler is just about empty.","Chinon01","Feb 27, 2009"

3.85,6.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"12 oz. bottle: This one pours a clear amber/caramel brown color, with a little off-white head on it. There is a somewhat sweet, but not too strong caramel aroma to the beer. Some floral notes also. The taste is mainly mildly sweet caramel malt. This is very smooth going down. A very nice session beer.","Boto","Dec 21, 2005"
4.2,16,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Taste is of biscuit malts and bits of grapes. There is a maltiness present in this beer that is noticable in the aftertaste. Very sweet characteristics up front with a smooth body that blends well. There is also a sour note present. Medium carbonation. The noble German hops and malts work well. Very drinkable beer.","stewart124","Dec 19, 2005"

Can't get excited about it, but very drinkable and quaffable. Can't go wrong, and a great session brew.","JackStraw22","Jun 10, 2005"
2.93,-19.1,3.5,3,3,3,2.5,"amber clear pour with tight bubbles, lightly floating in a thin pattern. points increasing for kick ass cool label. smells slightly malty but mostly of thickly sweet burnt sugar. taste packs on a hint of hop bitterness over the intense malt background like a dry hopped colt 45. finishes clean with a slight lager sourness. a wee bit heavy to be enjoyed repeatedly but a decent brew. wouldn't seek it out again.","goodbyeohio","Jun 10, 2005"
3.46,-4.4,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"The beer pours a ruby red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a dry, metallic scent. There seems to be some roasted and crystal malts here, but the lager yeast dominates the smell. The taste is decent. It has a grainy pale and crystal malt flavor. It is sweet and a bit toasted, with a nice hop balance in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent dark lager, but nothing special. I expected something better from Victory.","WesWes","Jun 07, 2005"

4.16,14.9,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,5,"While I usually enjoy beers for their complexity, this one is very enjoyable in its simplicity. It is what it is, and doesn't try to be anything else.

4.22,16.6,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Damn good session beer. I have never been a lager fan at all. Despise those parties you get stuck at where there is a choice of cans or lager only -that is why I started toting my own! But I really have been enjoying the dark lagers, and this one goes down very easy. Been kicking these back as drinkers and with meals, too bad it is limited edition.","shapudding","Feb 25, 2005"
3.97,9.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"This is a beer worth looking for, and I don't really understand why it doesnt prompt a little more talk, except for the fact that it is a lager, and not a strong or hoppy one. Well made, delicious, and not heavy, it is an exceptional seasonal.","Erix","Feb 23, 2005"
3.65,0.8,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Dark red pour with slightly brown head that dissipates with little lacing. Smell is nutty and toasty with dark malt scents, maybe a small scent of corn is in there as well. Taste is similarly malty as the name would imply, and lots of roasty malts. Mouthfeel is maybe a little thin but there's a nice malty finish that's certainly pleasant. Not the best lager I've ever had and not the best Victory I've ever had, but it's quite drinkable and tasty nonetheless. Certainly worth a try.","whartontallboy","Feb 11, 2005"
3.5,-3.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer is a nice medium brown with an ok head. It's not really much to look at, but it does have some redeeming qualities in the flavor, such as a slight nuttiness and a light sweetness. Has a bit of hop kick as well that keeps it interesting to drink.","aracauna","Jun 04, 2004"
3.13,-13.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,2.5,"Too syrupy sweet and then too dry. I sadly did not finish the growler, but I'll use the rest for cooking a demi-glace. Never thought I'd feel this way about a Victory beer - if you can't say anything nice, don't say much at all, so I'll end it now.","nomad","Apr 11, 2004"
2.76,-23.8,3.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,3,"While Im not a big fan of most lagers, I always have high hopes for Victory products. I have to admit, this fell short: it was only average. Granted, many breweries products Ive sampled rarely reach this level, but usually Victory can do so much better. Its a drinkable beer, thats for sure, but it just lacks any bit of complexity.","JimsArcade","Mar 03, 2004"
3.93,8.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"This poured a beautiful dark mahogany color with little head and barely any lacing. The smell was of toasted malt and honey. The taste was toasted/roasted sweet malt, smokiness and chocolate with a very slight hint of hops. Everything about this brew was subdued and the hops barely showed up but I'm guessing this is very close to the true style of a Dunkel / Dark Lager. This is a little mellow for a Victory brew but like I said, it's probably true to the style (this is my first true Dunkel). The beer is very drinkable with a medium - low ABV and not too filling (don't let the color fool you). Very fitting for the transition from late Winter into the early spring season. I think I'll have another...","Gasp100","Feb 28, 2004"
3.96,9.4,4,3,4.5,4,4,"Well, the 2004 Dark (dunkel) Lager is on draft at the Victory brewpub. I love these guys (Ron & Bill) because they are always teaking and seeking their idea of the perfect expectation of the beer they have and/or are brewing. This year's very version has a rich, dark, mahogany hue with a small off-white head. There is slight, almost indistinquishable aroma. But, the roasted malt taste is noticable, not smokey or peat flavor. The medium carbination provides a smooth mouthful. The hops are in the background, but there is a delicate, delicious, but not overwhelming malt finish. A classic session brew. Hope you all have an opportunity to try it.","rotsaruch","Feb 25, 2004"
4,10.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a clear dark caramel color, topped by a medium tan head. Strong caramel aromas backed by a touch of noble-type hops on the aroma. The taste is very high on biscuity, roasted malt with a nice caramel note as well. A touch of bitterness on the finish leads to a long, slightly sweet aftertaste of roasted malt. The mouthfeel is great, with fine carbonation supporting the smooth malt body. Drinkability is also very good, as this would be a good session beer that you would not likely grow tired of very quickly. A very nice beer from Victory.","aaronh","Jun 01, 2003"
3.78,4.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"pours a brilliantly clear dark ruby brown with an beige head that manages to stick around some. clean, roasted european malts on the nose. dark roasted, carmely malted taste balanced well with the right amount of hops. a good, well crafted dark lager that achieves exactly what it strives to be....don't expect to be blown away though. a solid offering.","pheurton","May 01, 2003"
3.5,-3.3,4,4,3,4,3.5,"Deep brown with orange hues and an off-white head. Aromas of nuts, malts, and cinnamon?. Flavor is much the same but strikes a much better balance in flavor than it does in smell. Theres a little bit of sourness in there but its hardly noticeable. Body is slightly heavy and carbonation is light and it carries a good feeling on the tongue. Its a little nutty an odd tasting but I dont see this offerings as flavorful or as exciting as other beers by victory.","allboutbierge","Apr 21, 2003"
3.58,-1.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Deep amber color. Slight nut/malt nose. Rich sweet malt notes in the taste but there it ends. Rich white head. It is quite rich and sweet for a lager beer but, it seems something is missing in there to round out this sweetness. It is good.. but for Victory ""good"" is an under-achievement. I guess the world is tough when you make such darn good products. The Dark Lager is a solid beer but nothing puts it ""over the top"".","frank4sail","Apr 16, 2003"
4,10.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pretty well balanced brew. Nothing spectacular, and there isn't one great characteristic that stands out, but this is a very drinkable brew. Has a ruby colored body with a very short head, very malty aroma. A mild bitterness balanced with the strong malty flavors keeps it well balanced. Flavors of dark chocolate and caramel find their way in as well. Smooth, velvety mouthfeel. A nice, easy drinker.","IrishRedRock","Apr 13, 2003"
4.12,13.8,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"The body is light/medium with decent carbonation. On the palate the flavor has good balance between the toasty malts and some bitterness. Mouth feel is creamy and smooth. A very tasty brew that is highly drinkable.","WilliamPhilaPa","Apr 06, 2003"

3.88,7.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"I love Victory's all malt lager, so I ran into the dunkel had to pick it up. With a lot of Victory's brews being a little over the top, it's really a treat to be dealt a beer that has the main goal of being really drinkable. Appears a deep brown amber with a thin tan head that forms to the edge of the glass to leave a trickled lace around as the I empty it. The hops make up the backbone of the aroma with the darker roasts and maybe some caramel malted barley complementing the mellow floral hoppiness bringing the is beer to equilibrium in the aromatics. Flavor is crisp mellowed sweetness with a great balance of hop bitterness and rough darker roasts bring about a creamy mouthfeel to form a medium to light bodied amazingly drinkable beer. Well made and fine tuned to bring about the balance of everything going on in this great present from Victory.","WVbeergeek","Mar 05, 2003"
3.58,-1.1,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4.5,"When I think of Victory I usually don't think of session beers. The Dark Lager fits this category. Very nice dark amber appearance with a wisp of a head. Not much in the nose. Smooth, exceptionally clean, malt and grain, a touch of caramel and some background roastiness. Hops are subtle, just there to balance the sweetness not to be in the fore. As with their other beers Victory achieves what it set out to do. Produce a brew true to style which this clean lager is. But as an Ale guy give me some fusels, phenols and esters!","QXSTER1","Feb 15, 2003"
3.98,9.9,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"The All Malt Dark Lager is Victory's late winter/early spring seasonal, released in January. It pours a clear, deep mahogany with a reddish cast and ruby highlights. The short but creamy tan head drops readily but keeps a creamy collar and leaves some spotty lace. The nose expresses fresh toasty malts with some mild spicy hops deep in the background. The body is light/medium with a fine carbonation that gently caresses the tongue. The flavor is delicately balanced between a supple, gently toasty malt and an underlying bitterness. It finishes clean and dry with a touch of residual toasted maltiness. Very nicely done! This one is all about balance and drinkability. It has enough character to keep it interesting, but also 'just enough' so that it remains highly drinkable. Well worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Jan 24, 2003"
3.51,-3,4,3,4,3.5,3,"It goes great with Crazy Richards All Natural Peanut Butter, a late night pairing that may have added a few pounds to me. This is a beer that is better fresh, so I don't recommend stocking up on it. Fresh, it's one of my favorites. The several month old ones aren't jazzing me as much.","Scoats","Oct 08, 2002"
