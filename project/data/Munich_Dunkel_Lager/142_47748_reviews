"nice warm caramel malty flavors."
"Surprisingly rich and nutty aroma.   This is followed up by the flavor which is nutty but not rich.  The feel is a bit too thin and might benefit from a touch higher carbonation."

"This is a beer I'd drink, but probably not buy again. That isn't an insult, just not much of a compliment."
"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 8/27/2013. Pours crystal clear ruby red color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light roast, raisin, pear, apple, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of dark/bready malt, yeast ester, and light hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light roast, raisin, pear, apple, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Zero bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of carmel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light roast, raisin, pear, apple, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Good balance and solid robustness of dark/bready malt, yeast ester, and light hop notes; with a very clean finish with zero cloying flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish. Overall this is a good Munich dunkel style. Good balance and solid robustness of dark/bready malt, yeast ester, and light hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasant and enjoyable offering."
"O- What it lacks in flavor profile or complexity it makes up for in drinkability. Its a good but not great offering."

"O- not a style that I have had a lot of, but I expected more roasted malt flavors. Very drinkable, smooth and clean. Definitely could put a few down...if someone else made the purchase. Not a bad beer, but nothing I would go out of my way to purchase."

"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and a decent example of a Dunkel, but I tend to like my Dunkel to have a more noticeable roasted malt aspects and with this beer it was the dark fruits that seemed to stick out the most and that's not really what I'm looking for in a good Dunkel. This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, clean, a little crisp and not filling at all, but the taste didn't do a good job at holding my attention and one would be enough for me, but if I wasn't worried about taste I'm sure I could drink more than a few of these. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was nice and it worked well with this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was that it wasn't as true to style as I would like and it didn't seem as balanced as some of the better Dunkels. I wouldn't buy a bottle of this again, but I would for sure try it on tap to see if it's any different and I wouldn't recommend this one as a good Dunkel. All in all I was little let down with this one, I was expecting a pretty good Dunkel, but this one didn't live up to my expectations and so far it's my least favorite Spaten beer, better luck next time guys, this one just wasn't for me."

"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a beer that has a moderate initial foaminess that gradually fades to a smooth mouthfeel. Closes dry, with medium-low stickiness clinging to the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good München Dunkel."
""
""
""
""
"o: Not as rich or full bodied as I had expected or hoped for, but a very easy drinking, mildly malty and, curiously, slightly fruity brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not the most complex flavors but totally true to the style. A great beer if you are after something darker in color and flavor but with the smooth, refreshing, simplicity of a lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent dunkel, not the most complex beer, but easy to drink."

"O- Still and will always be my favorite spaten! the others in the line up compete and though not much separates them, they fail to beat the Dunkel. Year round, its a great beer to enjoy, but perfect for the beginning of spring and mid fall."
""
"One of the best beers I drank at Oktoberfest 2010. I also grab a glass or two on the weekend at the local Bavarian resort near my house. This is a smooth, dark, rich and semi-sweet brew that is very easy to drink (almost goes down like water). I am a big fan of Spaten in general, this being my favorite variety they put out. The purity of the ingredients lend to the purity of the flavor balance and smooth quality of this beer. The flavor of the malt and hops is so delicately balanced being a dark beer it makes this one of the more unique German beers that I have found. The smell is very sharp, fresh and potent which matches the full and robust flavor upon first sip. These are easy to drink indeed, but watch out because they pack a whallop of alcohol that can sneak up on you."

"o: I know I mentioned it earlier but I really enjoyed this beer. Veryy unique flavors - reminds me of some vanilla casket beers, only lighter on the vanilla and heavier on the chocolate."
""
""
"Overall - Good but not great. I expect a bit more from the Germans."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - tastes like a beer that should have more alcohol, I really wish it did. If it had as much alcohol as Spaten's Optimator (7.5%), I'd get a sixer of this regularly. Nonetheless, a great tasting brew with plenty to offer. My first dunkel, and based on it's low ratings, I'm guessing I need to go try some more of this style."

"Overall – While at first I wasn’t wild about the brew, it grew on me as I drank it more. The mix of the roasted flavors and the more fermented grape flavors create a rather soothing taste. Not bad."
""
""
""

""
""

"This is really enjoyable. I don't get to drink enough dunkel an this beer reminds me exactly what I am missing out on."

"Poured into a glass mug. Pours clear dark brown with a quickly dissipating off-white head. There are lots of visible tiny bubbles in this beer. There are aromas of toffee and roasted malt. I don't get many hop notes in the nose. The taste follows the nose. There's some mild sweetness and the roasted malt is there. The hops bring some grassy flavors. It's very straightforward and non-offensive. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The beer is smooth with a crisp finish. It's very drinkable. This is a good beer."
""
"O - Not what I would call a spectacular, mind-blowing brew, but it's quite delicious if you're in that dark, malty mood. Not entirely complex, but satisfying nonetheless. I'd drink it again, but I can't honestly say this style is anything more than an occasional treat. Highly recommended for early explorers of craft brew"

"Overall, this is an average dunkel lager, with a far below average aroma. Sheesh. Bring on the nail polish!"

"Overall: Solid beer. Would pair well with marinated steak."
"I think this beer woud pair well with Sugaree by Jerry Garcia."
"O- still love 'em. my first love at OLD WORLD in huntington beach. still brings back memories of that under-aged chicken dance with a woman twice my age and the flat tire on the way home during OKTOBERFEST with Steve. like a first romance (which doesnt result in a jail stay), i'll always remember spaten as my first and the great times i had before i found all the other great things brough to my front door due to greater trade abilities in the world. but still a great brew. BRING BACK THE CLUB-WEISSE! also, listed as a 5.2%, not the 5.5% as on the site."
"O- a pretty good Dunkel, nothing special but definitely sessionable."

" Overall I give this brew a 4 out of 5. The fragrance is really enjoyable and appealing as it is malty and robust. The taste is complex, rich, sweet and dry. Though I said it was a touch watery, that characteristic improves its drinkability. 5.2% ABV on the bottle, lower than what I've read elsewhere, and that's a good thing."

"Overall, a pretty average dunkel, but not bad at all. Very sessionable."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clean deep amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, well, standard European lager like smells. In the taste, a small roast inside of a standard European lager. A smooth and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry lager like grain in the aftertaste. Basically, a standard European lager with a note of like caramel like roast."
""
""
""
"O: not the best dunkel you can drink! I think anyone can brew a better example! Its a cery drinkable beer,good for a nice session dunkel!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is similar, sweet with toffee tones and some fruit coming in. Body is light, and this is an easy-drinking and enjoyable dunkel."
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours a clear, brilliant rust color with 1 finger head and no lace.It becomes whiskey colored as it warms. It's aroma has hints of bread crust and root beer. The flavor leads off with root beer with bread crust, spice, and faint floral notes. The mouthfeel is light-medium and there's a slight warmth as the beer warms. Spaten Dunkel is a good brew, recommended!"
""
"Overall, definitely a malt dominated beer. The herbal hops prevent it from being overly sweet. Very drinkable."
""
"Pours a clear orange-brown with a 1 inch foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasty malt, caramel, and some slight metallic aromas. Taste is of malt, caramel, and a fruity flavor on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I think it tastes better than it smells."
""
"O: Very good brew, they've done well with the flavoring. Everything flows well together and finishes with a crispness leaving you ready for another. Def a great brew while watching the game with some friends."
""
""

"Pour is a german Dunkel. The smell is skunked, but lets see what I can do to get past the skunk ass. Smell is irrelevant in this review. Clamped the nose closed and plowed through it. Its got those Dunkel flavors that I love, but its dry. Almost like super sugary caramel. Its a very sweet, in spite of the skunk from the damn green bottle."
""
""
"Very drinkable and I wouldn't mind having a few more of these right now."

"Pours a reddish brown with a medium beige head. Aroma and Taste of toasted caramel malt, barley, some yeast and grassy notes with some hops bitterness. Palate is a light to medium body with moderate carbonation. Finish is sweet toasted caramel malt, barley, yeast with some bitter hops ending for balance. Nothing really outstanding, but overall a pretty good easy drinking dunkel, an average brew"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I good beer for this style. A little light on flavor but still tasty, light and easy to drink. Will be glad to sample more."
"Overall, not a great, but not a terrible experience for my first time with a dunkel. An interesting mix of malt and light bodied drinkability that makes it obvious why this is a favorite of Fruedenfest every July near my hometown in Oldenburg, Indiana."
""
"Overall: An enjoyable beer but not spectacular."

"not my favorite here. pours dark brown and flat like the left over morning coffee down the drain with the dinner dishes. smells malty and astringent. taste is really funny, german malts yes, but in weird proportion. the dark roast thing doesnt seem to work here, and the mouthfeel is rough with so little carbonation and a full body. not sure if i got a bad bottle, i know a lot of these green glass imports can be mishandled, but i really didnt care for this brew and i am a lover of dunkels"

"Overall (3): Pretty average, even for a generally unremarkable style. Light and drinkable but not much stands out except for the cereal graininess and a light caramel. Very clean if watery and thin."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a tasty beer. It is a rich and clean tasting dunkel and very sweet and palatable. I drink a lot more ales than lagers and a good lager every now and then really hits the spot."
""
""
"Funny how you can realize you never reviewed what is a fairly common beer. Straight down the middle on the German dark lager style here. Roasted malt flavor is forefront, with a bit of astringency thinning toward the end. Finish is firm, with a parting hops note. I can't imagine we ever get this beer anything approaching fresh, and, particularly for a lager style, it would be interesting to try this in its prime."
""
"Gotta love free bottles, right? Thanks, Mike! I'm always down for samples. This one pours a clear sunset ruby topped by a a finger of dusty tan foam. The nose comprises flaky biscuits, light hot cinnamon, light caramel, and maybe a blade of grass or two. The taste holds notes of caramel, light biscuit, and what seems like a pinch of nutmeg. It's all pretty straightforward and ends up pretty tasty. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mostly fluid feel. Overall, a nice dark lager, very drinkable, if a bit on the dull side."

"O - Good dunkel from Spaten Haus. I liked it. Really got a lot of raisin, but that might just be me. Enjoyed it."
"Notes: pretty simple stuff. Easy to drink but lacking in complexity. The taste feels a little hollow in the middle. A little more toasted caramel than Spaten's Oktoberfest but seemingly not as well made. Will continue to look for a better Dunkel."
"Hard to pick a final review on this one: it's got some flashes of brilliance, but in the end may be just a touch too subdued to be exceptional. I certainly don't regret drinking it as it was solid, but it wasn't truly outstanding."
"O: This beer adds up to more than the sum of its' parts. If you break it down and pick it apart, there are flaws. If you sit back and enjoy this, it's pretty good."
"Overall: Very nicely done. It's rich, but not overdone; and it's maltiness is superbly balanced by the spicy hops and moderate bitterness."
"It pours a brown color with a filmy tan head that faded quickly. I could smell some earthy tones along with a hint of toffee and maybe even raisins. The taste is similar with some dark fruit and toffee with some earthy hops coming through in the finish. Feels light with moderate carbonation and it leaves the mouth wet. This is a solid beer, nothing amazing but still good."
"This pours a brownish color with a slightly off white head. The smell is kind of sweet, a little earthy smells and perhaps some toffee. Feel is light. The taste is a little sweet but also sort of light, there is a little bit of bitterness at the end. Overall not bad."
"This was drunk whilst eating Sauerbraten und spatezel and the whole meal finished with anisette, I don't think that affects my judgement of the brew!"
"Drinkability/overall- i wound up overall enjoying this six pack from spaten, one thats not most complex but make very nice session beer, though slightly sweet the balance is just right to keep you coming back for more, another respectable showing from a pretty good brewery"
"Mouth was smooth, light with a short finish. I really enjoyed this beer."
"For coming in a green bottle this literally has 0 skunk to it. It tastes like a fall beer and can easily compete with some top notch beers. Spaten is a top notch brewery and pretty much one of my favorite imports from Germany."
"O: A very decent/enjoyable beer. Would not mind having this one again."
"A pleasant, tasty non-agressive sessionable German lager."
"Poured a clear dark tea brown with a nice layer of off-white head that retained well and left a bit of lacing on the pint glass. Roasted malts and pumpernickel in the aroma, traces of caramel and nuts. The taste follows the aroma, with mainly rich, roasted malts in the foreground, bready, nutty, caramel and brown sugar. Medium mouthfeel, and a nice quaff for any occasion."
"I liked this more than I expected, probably because it's a German lager and not a crappy American lager. It's just more refined than the lagers I'm used to."
"O: The beer is easy to drink and rather sessionable. I would have no problem having more than one of these at a time because it’s not very filling."
"Spaten makes some really good stuff. They're Dunkel is also quite tasty. This beer pours out as a clear brown color with a tan foamy head. the head settles and leaves us with a nice roasted nutty aroma with some pilsner aromas hidden in the back. The beer tastes good, its got a nice dry roasted flavor to it. The mouthfeel is quite drinkable. It's good dark German brew."
"For a Dunkel Lager, it's very good."
"Pours a brilliant reddish-mahogany and smells bready and faintly malty with delicate touches of cereal and apricot. The nose is a little weak considering the color and that weakness continues on the palate which feels a little watered down. A slight oily maltiness and a balancing, but equally nonstriking, hoppiness lead to a crisp and very short finish."
"Lighter bodied with ample carbonation. Drinks very well, was surprised this was listed at even 5.5%. Good standard German version of the German style."
"Atmosphere is pretty nice. Appearance is very average, nose is a nice combination of yeast and sweetness. Tastes like it smells. Yeast and sweet. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"Its a dark rich brown color, somewhat coffee. Hoppy with some caramel malt flavors. Caramel notes and slight floral nots. Its really rich and its maltiness smooths out. Its a good beer if you ask me. it has a nice balance of hops and malts. Its a medium feel, not too heavy. Its a nice session beer, I'd drink this with a meal."
"D- Nice drinkability for its style, but nothing to write home about."
"D: hmm...lager, moderately low alcohol content, balanced, no off-flavors...of course it's highly drinkable."
"D: A great smell and feel, with a fairly subdued flavor, make this beer, I think, rather dangerous! I was done with mine before I really was aware I'd finished it. It's a good lager for session drinking."
"D: I really enjoyed this beer, and look forward to trying more examples of this style."
"Drinkability: An acceptable product but there are better dunkels from the old country than this"
"Pours dark walnut with a burnished look and good clarity, but a somewhat short head. Smells surprisingly fruity, followed by a light graininess, a touch of chalky malt, and a tiny bit of grain sourness. The taste is even grainier, with more of that fruitiness and a somewhat seltzer-like finish. Somewhat pleasant, but needs more depth- especially on the finish. As is, it could have been made by Shiner."
"D/M: smooth drinking, sweetness makes it easy to drink but it does sit slightly heavy, nice carbonation tingle"
"If you're looking to try more than one, this wouldn't be a bad choice as the alcohol is barely detectable. I wish this had more of an aroma and a punch to it but sometimes, a beer has to be unassuming and I need to just stop overanalyzing and just enjoy it. If this is that beer, than so be it! It's not a bad choice and as I said before, I wish there were more to choose from on my local shelf so I could get a better feel for this style."
"this beer was drinkable but borderlines on not much happening. I kept thinking it was going to start slow and take off, but no. not bad and not great. just OK."
"D - A drinkable beer that is crisp and refreshing. A little too mild for my taste but would go well with almost any type of food."
"D - The thin feel of this mixed with its slightly off nose makes it a tough one to enjoy. It is an easy drinking Lager, but far from interesting. Overall just an average beer that I doubt I will buy again. (if anything, I may pick up another bottle in the future just to make sure it wasnt a bad bottle due to improper storage. the lightstruck hint in the nose has me a bit concerned that this bottle was not truly representative of this brew)"
"Final Notes: Not impressed. You could do much better than this one. And for God's sake stop with the green bottles!"
"A deep red/brown appearance with little head. Smelled malty with a hint of carmel. You can taste the malt and carmel (although it's not a stong taste) and it is not overly sweet. Has a mild toasty finish. This beer was a little too carbonated for me and also a little too light and watery."
"D: This was quite a letdown for my first time trying the style."
"Pours out from a 12 OZ bottle with a clear freshness date. medium Brown to dark brown in color, effervescent carbonation, and wispy head. Smells of herbal hops up front with a roasted malt back, very noticeable. Taste is of a herbal medicine hop up front again with a sweet caramel malt in the back with a notes of grass and grains. Mouthfeel is thin and bubbly and has a balance between drying and thirst quenching like a Dunkel should! This beer was made for drinking and drinking is what I do, I will drink a lot of these. Easy drinking, good taste and refreshing! This style has been hit on the head and then some. Great beer that is appropriate to this style to bad it had a hit in the looks department."
"Overall pretty average for the style, like a watery Bock beer. Flavors are pretty subdued and one taste mostly malt sweetness in the aftertaste. Smells like the taste, some light, sweet malts. Ok amount of lacing, but retains its head poorly. This beer is smooth and light, with a crisp bite in the finish. Pretty good stuff, quite drinkable. This is really nothing special but is true to the style. Not an offensive beer at all, so long as one does not pay too much for it, this beer will not disappoint."
"D: Overall it's a solid beer, wouldn't mind a bit more flavor though."
"Drinkability is good - a very pleasant brew that I would buy again."
"Note: There was an initial skunk smell and taste in the very beginning."
"D: Very drinkable. Good flavor without being too overbearing. Sessionable ABV."
"D. Smooth and dry beer. I would like to have a cople of these."
"decent but not high. doubt i'd go out of my way for a sixer but would definitely try again. be interested to try it on draft."
"Beer is medium bodied and has some malty sweetness up front and leaves a slightly dry finish on the back. There is no aftertaste and its a good dunkel lager overall. Its a little like a bock. I enjoyed it, I would order it again."
"Pours a cola colored shade of brown with decent head at first that recedes to little after awhile. Nose is light with some caramel and malt. On the palate the malt sweetness comes across with a toasty quality. Finish is light in flavor with a lingering toasty malt flavor."
"Drinkability: Maybe when paired with the right meal I would enjoy this more, but by itself I'm getting tired of it about halfway through the glass. It didn't go well with baked pasta (tomato base and mozzarella) so maybe that's what's throwing me off, but the fact that there is no date on the bottle could mean the beer is old."
"With the dark color I was expecting a heaver body and deeper taste but was disappointed and feel that this is just a pilsner with food coloring and cinnamon. It has that sourness of the original Spaten but toned down with a bit more focus on malts, but not much more. It burns a bit going down and I wasn't too motivated to finish the bottle."
"Malty, nutty flavor, more dry than sweet, though there is a hint. Lingering notes of cereal grain. Simple, but with a bit of toastiness that gives it the signature Dunkel character. Well carbonated and somewhat effervescent, suitable for drinking by the liter. Prost!"
"Pours chocolate colour body with some mocha head. From Half Time. Maltish aroma, a modest roastiness. Average mouthfeel. Very good drinkability, though somewhat sweet. A tad yeasty. Finishes a little drying. Another decent INBEV beer. I would have this again."
"D- I could drink this all day."
"D - Good drinkability, this dunkel is a fair beer. The aroma offers up much more than the flavor does in terms of potency but it's still a nice brew for the style."
"Very good Dunkel overall. Exactly what it should be, a bit more complex and toasty than a Helles, with the same drinkability. I really want to try this on tap with some German food."
"Cheers!"
"D: Ok Dunkel but not one pf the best or one I would recommend"
"D - Highly quaff-able, I'd love to sit back and drink a sixer of this brew. I loved it's mild nutty flavor profile that demands you to take sip after sip. Mouthfeel is very good as well, smooth with just the right amount of Co2. I really recommend this beer, I'd definitely like to pick this one up sometime. Cheers!"
"d: Highly drinkable, light and refreshing. I prefer a different hop flavor and i almost want to say it's slightly skunked but can't be sure. Decent beer."
"Value: $6.99 for a sixer??? Cannot complain."
"do. I could have this one again in a heart beat."
"D - Yes more please. In fact it's been a while so I will need another pour. Glad its now available in the variety case."
"drinkability is fine..I could easily drink 5 or 6 of these...no problem! very decent and interesting beer. cheers!"
"d - A decent lager. Some nice caramel malts in the smell and taste. Would try again but probably not seek out."
"Middle of the road dunkel that loses a bit of steam in my book for being overly sweet for style, especially in the finish. A little bit more carbonation might make this beer a bit crisper, more drinkable, who knows?"
"Hofbrau dunkel also comes in the green bottle but I've always gotten it fresh, now that is how you do Dunkel, this one is sorta like, meh, but good."
"D - not a bad quaff. can sit around with friends and have several of these. not a Chimay, but not bad, either."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium light and the finish is light. This is good dunkel, nothing special."
"edit: revisited this today on this second record breaking day of east coast heat....5:30pm and it's still 100 degrees! so, this being a very cold brew hits the spot...and some of the above 'criticisms' work to be highlights now...GLAD it isn't thick and overbearing and subtle...very refreshing...actually, the flavor profile is much more pronounced than the day i tried it first in april...my tongue seems to change with the seasons. so, i bumped up a few points to balance these two samplings."
"Drinkability - This beer offers some the flavors of heavier beers in a lighter bodied package that is not gimmicky, 'lite', or watery."
"D - Drinkable, I still like other brews by Spaten and will likely not buy again simply because I can find other brews that I like better."
"Split a pitcher at J. Ryan's in Syracuse. The pitcher made this beer look like a porter, but in a smaller glass is became clear brown. I have to say, this brew reminds me a lot of Spaten's Optimator. I guess I wouldn't be surprised if they shared the same yeast and similar grains. Anyways, that meant this dunkel had a big, dark breadcrust flavor with mild licorice around the edges. There wasn't a lot of flavor upfront, but Spaten is a more corporate-tasting (read simple) brand. Not a bad dunkel for a session."
"D - It's drinkable, not my favorite Spaten product but certainly not horrible."
"D - This is an okay Munich Dunkel. The aroma was disappointing but the flavor was good."
"Pours a clear, amber color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of sweet malt, yeast, pale malt, and sulfur. Fits the style of a Munich Dunkel Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, pale malt, yeast, sulfur, and a hint of pale hops. Overall, the sulfur is dominate, but other flavors account for a decent Munich."
"Overall this beer will always have a place in my fridge."
"Medium bodied, fairly smooth and very drinkable."
"D - SUPER easy to drink, for sure."
"A decent beer overall. Fairly easy to drink. I'd probably have it again."
"Soft malts on the palate with a touch of earthy hops and a nice, chocolaty fade into a long finish. Mellow carbonation, the mouthfeel is a tad thin, though not watery. Definately a solid beer."
"I expect Spaten products to be ""pretty good", and Spaten Dunkel hits that set target. I'm glad a got a 6-pack, as I will be drinking the rest of my bottles with future dinners. In fact, this beer was consumed with homemade BBQ cheeseburgers with baked potato."
"D: A flavorful and wonderful fruity dunkel that was enjoyable and easy to consume and like. Can't go wrong with a six-pack. A well brewed, clean german example that gets good regards and a worthy recommend."
"Drinkability: Definitely a keeper. I love bready, malty, slightly sweet beers and this one fits the bill perfectly. I haven't had many dunkel lagers, but this really scored above expectations for me."
"The mouthfeel is the only thing that slips a little in my book. It tends to be a little tart and not really a full bodied beer as the style should be. The carbonation is also a tad aggressive which sizzles a little much and distracts from the fine malt profile. It is however an easy drinking beer and one I've been happy to wrap my soup coolers around."
"One's my limit on this middle-of-the-road brew. I want something more flavorful."
"Sweet, but not the sweetest dunkel I've had. Toasted malts, biscuit, some nuts, with a surprisingly crisp hop finish. Medium-bodied, with a lighter, brown-ale-like mouthfeel. Good drinkability due to a decent amount of character and a low ABV. I could finish the six-pack, and would, if this weren't the last one!"
"Overall this beer wasn't bad, and had a nice taste to it, I'd buy again but it wouldn't be my top priority."
"12 oz green bottle to glass. Dark brown, with some red at the edges, tan head faded quickly. Smelled sweet and grainy, some roast, maybe a little funk (but no skunky smells despite the green glass). Nice malty flavor, some caramel and roasted coffee (or nuts?). Didn't detect hops much. Good carbonation (more creamy than prickly), overall not too heavy, easy to drink."
"D- a highly drinkable beer, one of the best dunkels around IMO"
"Overall this beer didn't have a whole lot going on to make it stand out but I thought it was solid. Worth a shot."
"D - Balance is too far off. And way too flat, otherwise very enjoyable."
"Overall, good beer, I'd recommend it for a fall, or early winter beer. Cheers."
"I'm not very familiar with the style, so I can't really say if this is true to style or not, so I'm just going to assume it is. I guess I'm just not the biggest fan of the style."
"Drinkability - This is incredibly smooth and quite the rewarding treat. Really this and the Ayinger MDL and maybe the Hofbrauhaus's effort are the only good examples of the style commonly available around the US that I've tried thus far."
"Drinkability- really good, I will definitely drink it again. Spaten has always done a great job with their beers. I'm a big fan."
"Drinkability - 4.5/5.0 - ach ja, baby. Definitely"
"Drinkability: Surprisingly easy to slam! Actually almost dangerously drinkable. It does get a little bit more difficult in a Mass Krug, 2 1/2 liters may be better"
"Poured a medium russet color with a a slight amber hue, a sticky off white head atop,aromas of caramel and light roast mainly with a slight tinge of iron.Just well rounded flavors of cocoa with light caramel sweetness,not much hop presence but I didnt expect any.Its easy drinking with some nicer subtle flavors to be had."
"Pours medium brown with a ruby hue. Thin head. Not much retention and no lacing. Aroma is of dark fruits,bready malts, and hints of grassy hops. Body is light with some carbonation. Taste is of raisin bread and butter. Earthy hops in the mix as well. Complex. A decent version of this style."
"Starts out sweet and malty with a solid bitterness, more bitter than I would have expected judged by beer type. Strong dark bread flavor like serious Russian black bread flavor deep and rich, nothing at all like the light stuff."
"It started out with a nice reddish amber color with a medium amount of white foam and a little lace retention. The smell of roasted malts and mild hops were very evident. But, the taste was also of roasted malts and hops, but, a little to weak to carry over a pleasant flavor of the combination of both. A little to bitter on the finish also. Just an OK Dunkel, nothing to get excited about."
"The drink is light-medium in body with fine-bubbled carbonation. Very drinkable, but pretty unexciting."
"This beer has a great true to the name dark brown body with a thick foamy. The lace follows the body as you drink all the way to the bottom, in tight clusters. It has roasted malty aroma. The flavor is a little bit metallic but not enough to really care about. The taste of this beer is all about roasty caramel like malt. The mouthfeel is a little more watery than I thought it would be but it is still a medium bodied beer."
"Drinkability: Good flavor for a session beer"
"D- A great session beer that I could drink all night."
"Very drinkable brew."
"Yummy stuff and insanely drinkable by many quickly emptying glasses."
"The beer pours a translucent dark brown color with a 1/2"" tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice sweet caramel malt nose with a dry lager yeast aroma. The is a bit of roasted character as well. The taste is good. It has a smooth pilsner and crystal malt flavor that goes down really easy and finishes dry with some light residual sweetness. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with a tad too much carbonation. This is a good drinker. I like this one better than the their regular offering."
"Notes: It reminds me of a lighter bodied, average tasting bock beer. It's simple and sweet but not cloying, so I could see myself drinking a few more of these."
" If your going for an imported dark, stick with Spaten's Optimator."
"It is a very easy-drinking ""sessionable"" brew. Nice malty character with balance."
"This beer poured a dark brown with a reddish tinge and a single-finger tan head. The smell is some bready malt and graininess. The taste starts off with some toasted malt with a bit of nuttiness towards the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with a moderate amount of carbonation. This beer has no problem with drinkability, but doesn't really stand out or strike me as a great version of the style."
"Spaten Dunkel pours a dark brown body with ruby hues. Sweet caramel aroma. Palate is caramel, brown sugar, with nutty malt flavors in the finish. Crisp and smooth. A pretty good Dunkel. Very simple, but also quite sessionable and affordable. Good dark(er) beer to introduce to folks who think all dark beers are rich and heavy."
"Drinkability is lessened by the lack of finish and carbonation. Weak mouth feel. This beer is not hard to drink just very boring."
"Poured from a green bottle into a weizen glass. Has a dark brown color with red tint and 1/2 inch head. Very weak aroma, mild grains. Taste is also mild, a tad malty, overall pretty good. Feels medium bodied in mouth and is fairly drinkable. Overall a pretty good brew."
"Drinkability: A reasonably tasty lager that's also rather easy to drink. Still, it's no Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel!"
"MF&D - a very creamy beer, completely mouth coating. good amounts of carbonation with a great thickness body gives this beer what it needs to be highly palatable."
"Flavor follows nose with bitterness and a soft pungent mouthfeel that feels like hop or grain tannins. A deeper maltiness grows with a solid honey/caramel base and soft roast. Hints of vanilla. Finishes softly bitter with a hint of chocolate roast. Tastes good. Feels pretty good. Pretty good drinkability."
"3.5/4/4/3.5/4.5"
"D: This beer is simple and easy to drink. Greater complexity would have been nice, but the overall effort is solid."
"Had this on tap at the Gingerman in Houston. Poured in a pint glass. Appears dark brown color with a tan head that dissiptes quite rapidly. Very earthy in the aroma with some grain. Some light chocolate and caramel in the taste but no depth. Quick, dry finish. I expected more from this beer. Was a little let down. The first Spaten beer that I didn't care for too much."
"Opinion: I really like the overall flavor and presentation of this beer. It is a little on the light side for my taste, but it is no chump. I never concentrated on the relationship between the flavor and aroma on this beer like I did tonight, so it has opened my eyes to what this beer may be lacking. Some other Dunkels have a lot more toasty qualities to the beer the whole way through, and the melanoidins to make you think that you are drinking something like a ""Bock light"". This beer has more specialty malts to make the flavor profile than processes or malt complexity from the base Munich malt. I like this beer a lot from just a drinkability perspective, but from a stylistic standpoint...I prefer other examples of this style more."
"Very tasty and easy to drink beer. Stronger flavored than most beers of this type. The assertive flavor makes this one stand out."
"D: A good dunkel, but it doesn't give me the great malt notes I've come to expect in the style. Certainly an easy drinking dark beer."
"Taste is silky roasty and toasty malts. Just enough sweetness to hold the burnt toast bitter aspect of the beer. Pretty full body for a lager, but thin enough to go down the hatch at a rapid pace. Refreshing crispness and moderatly high carbonation make this a good beverage any time of year. Falls just a touch short of the Hofbrau version, but no by too much. Tasty."
"Generally, a good dunkel, which is rarely an exceptional or interesting style."
"D - Very smooth and drinkable beer."
"Overall, a nice Dunkel, but not the best. The malt character teeters a little too close to cloying, but otherwise the brew remains a distinctive variant and is rather drinkable."
"Not a bad beer. Pretty solid."
"D- Could have a few of these- nothing amazing considering how much I like Spaten Oktoberfest and Opitimator. I will stick with those two for now."
"Pours brown with dull orange hues and a good looking two-finger creamy tan head which dissipates rapidly, settling into a thin head and leaving a very diminutive lacing around the glass. Smells of toasted malts with some sweet and sour undertones. Tastes of sweet malts, honey and spice and is fairly complex for a dunkel, but not really big or anything, just nice and tasty. A slight alcohol heat shows up toward the very end. Goes down smooth with some crisp edges. There's not a lot of carbonation to speak of. Nice dunkel which is suiting me very well at the moment with the right amount of taste which doesn't detract from its drinkability. Damn, why did BL completely ruin that word!"
"Overall, a good taste, not one of the best but still worth your efforts. Prosit."
"Clear, dark amber with a small light khaki head that leaves wisps of fine lace on the glass. Fresh bread dough and roasted malt dominate the nose. Tastes of roasted malty caramel and bready yeast with a bitter hop bite in the finish. Medium light bodied and mildly carbonated, this beer is right between the lager and optimator. A decent brew."
"Overall- very easy to drink and quite good for 1 of my first Dunkel's of 09'"
"D -- Not a bad drinker, though I might expect more to style."
"D: Probably around the fourth beer I've had from Spaten. Overall quite easy to drink but just uninteresting. They do an overall good job of representing German beers generally."
"I'm a Spaten fan and I liked this beer. I prefer darker beers and enjoy the carmel taste and smell as well the color and maltiness. I would really like to try it on tap. This beer is very easy to drink several of. Not a bad back with a glass of scotch."
"Pours a cola colored brownish hue with copper highlights. Less than one finger of head after the pour, but leaves some film that slowly recedes to nothing. Crip toasted and light roasted malt nose that smells very sessionable. Roasted malts mix very well with the toasted malts and balancing grassy hops. The finish is just a little metallic when its too cold. Let this beer warm up just a bit, and you have a great session dunkel."
"This was pretty good but it comes off as a watered down Doppelbock to me. This is actually my first from the style so I can't compare it to anything else, might have to update in the future after having tried some other offerings, but they seem scarce."
"12 ounce green bottle poured into a pint glass. Beautiful dark amber color with a very light tan head. Smells of sweet roasted malt with a sort of smokey overtone. Tastes like nicely roasted malt with coffee-like hints and semi-sweetness. Nice texture and the right carbonation. Very easy to drink. Very good beer. The Germans do very well."
"This is a fantastic beer that is sure to grow on me. I've never had a better Dunkel."
"D - very easy to drink a few of these, even more with a big, hot, soft pretzel."
"D - very drinkable, although not one of the best dunkels I've ever had; if you want a good dunkelweisse, try weihenstephaner"
"Paulaner, Hacker-Pschorr, Lowenbrau, Kaltenberg, and Augustiner, are you listening?"
"D- Overall a pretty nice beer with a distinct taste. Worth trying."
