3.35,-8.2,3.5,3.5,3,3,4,"A mix of light ruby and dark amber at the bottom of the glass, that slowly descends into darkness as you go from bottom to top. Nice one finger head after the pour, but recedes to a nice film. Great bubblin too. The aroma is Munich malty bread and no real discernable hops. Watery heavily toasted and lightly roased malts. Ths gives a little hint of bread. Then some very faint lemongrass mint evens out the finish. Very smooth, watery a well as a little herbal note in the finish. Very drinkable, just needs some more flavor to make it a better German session beer.","scruffwhor","Nov 12, 2008"

4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"The color when poured in a glass, was a medium dark brown with a reddish hue. No foam or lace at all. The smell of roasted malts and a sweet candy aroma was evident. The taste was of roasted malts, with a touch of caramel and just a hint of coffee. Not the intense flavor I was looking for, but it still was a pleasant taste overall. Nice quincher on a hot day or just standing around BSing with the guys and girls!","BeerManDan","Aug 23, 2008"

3.45,-5.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a deep ruby-crimson color with a thin, almost stagnant head. The smell is malt dominate, slight toasted and caramel notes coming through. The taste is very similar, very malt forward - slightly skunked (probably due to the green bottle). The mouthfeel is medium in body and under carbonated. Overall, a drinkable beer - decent but nothing spectacular.","gmfessen","Jul 05, 2008"

4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"I ordered a mug of this beer at Schnitzelhaus, a local German restaurant, here in Tampa. The beer was very dark in the glass, and actually looked similar to root beer with a small frothy head. It had a nice spicy caramel smell, with hints of apple. It was a medium bodied beer with a hoppy finish. However the hoppy taste was not overbearing, so overall it was very drinkable beer. I really enjoyed it and felt it was a good representation of beers I drank while in Germany.","jenbys2001","Jan 14, 2008"

3.8,4.1,4,4,4,3,3.5,"Saw this one on the shelf at the local store when I was mixing a six pack and decided to go for it. Had never heard of it before, but I am a huge fan of Dark German Lagers, so how could I possibly go wrong, right? It poured a deep dark brown with a smallish off white head, that slowly faded to reveal a decent layer of lace left on the top, as well as a good amount left down the sides of the glass. Some visible carbonation was evident through the chains of bubbles streaming up through the very clear beer. Smell was very unique. It had a nice burnt sort of smell with a definate hint of caramel and coffe, which really suprised me. It was so pronounced, almost like a porter type of hint in there. The taste was very similar, lots of coffee and caramel flavors, mixed in with a nice earthy grain and a slightly bitter hopped back. A touch of chocolate seemed to be in there for good measure. Very smooth feel, almost silky, and a bit heavier then what I was expecting from the style to be honest. Very easy to drink despite such rich flavors. Went down very smoothly and I could easily see this as being an everyday beer. Overall, for a beer I had never heard of beforeI was very suprised and impressed. I will definatly pick this one up again, it was very unique and seemed to defy the style completely.","mikesgroove","Jul 20, 2007"
4.26,16.7,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"pours a medium brown color with a beige two finger head that fades to just cover the beer. very faint aromas of coffee and caramel. very subtle tastes of coffee, caramel, a hint of chocolate, slightly sweet and slightly salty very well balanced. mouthfeel is light and carbonation is good. taste good and is nice and smooth good session beer and the price is right.","billybob","Jun 10, 2007"
3.48,-4.7,3.5,3,4,3.5,3,"The beer was a dark brown with a red tinge and a very consistent and fairly abundant white head. Aroma was rather minimal, with some maltiness. Flavor was very good...not overly sweet malt, but a very pleasant light roasted notes. Mouthfeel was good, but I didn't find this beer extremely drinkable which may have been in anticipation of the large meal that was coming behind that beer.","BeerBelcher","Mar 31, 2007"
4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"A classic dark German Lager--It's all about the malts. The beer is subltle, yet rounded; toasty, but sweet; moderate all the way around, and equally as drinkable. Along with these favorable attributes, No fruitiness, low hopping and ultimately malty. Still showed a clean lager crispness and light toasty aftertaste. Simply and pure, one of Germany's gems.","BEERchitect","Jan 25, 2007"
4.46,22.2,5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Drinkability: I am very pleasantly surprised. As a beer you can usually pick up in the grocery store, I expected much less form this. But it is a great beer. Not sure of ABV, but this may become a beer to stock up on in my house.","beveritt","Dec 14, 2006"

2.96,-18.9,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,3,"Bit of a dry bite. Along with the roasted malt flavor, it drinks a little like an irish dry stout. Not much aroma to speak of, a little skunk at first (damn those green bottles!) and then a little caramel grain. There's a little more skunk in the flavor - how unfortunate. I wouldnt buy this in the US. Were I in Germany, however, I'd have my stein topped off.","tempest","Nov 06, 2006"
3.43,-6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"An OK drinkable beer but not one that I need ever drink again. Nothing bad about it at all, it is just I have drank many beers that taste similar and have no need to seek them out.","Zorro","Oct 29, 2006"

3.68,0.8,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"12 oz. green bottle with some code on the label. It pours a clear rust/brown color with light carbonation and a finger of tan head that leaves light lacing. It smells of caramel, molasses, and a hint of smoke - pretty inviting but not very aromatic. The flavor follows suit but with a Schlenkerla-esque beechwood smoke character, light tobacco, and green/spicy hops that leave a mild bitterness. It has a medium body and carbonation yet leaves a short finish, but it's a pleasant, quite enjoyable lager that would make a great session beer. Definitely worth a try.","mmmbeer","Sep 28, 2006"
3.45,-5.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured a clear darker brown , with some slight red hues, bit of lacing, and a frothy offwhite head of a quarter inch. Aroma is fairly malty and slighty sweet. Some herbal hop in there as well as slight caramel and bread. Taste is definatly on the sweet side of malty profiles , some breadyness , tinge of nuttyness, bit of balancing hop , clean , quick finish. Mouthfeel is medium/slightly crisp. A pretty drinkable brew , bit sweet/ and slightly thin for me. I do think its a good dunkel though , and definatly worth a try. Goes down quite easily.","Byeast","Sep 10, 2006"
3.37,-7.7,4.5,2.5,3.5,3,4,"Pours an opaque, deep copper rust color. Head is exceptional. If it wasn't for the weak nose of the beer I would be forced to delve into drinking it before the enormous thick ice-cream like head settled. However, once the head did settle it was nearly gone. Several small icebergs of thick foam and a little Belgian lacing is at that remained. Tasted fairly thin with projections of roasted plums and malt. Not bad and quite drinkable. Good beer.","dhilltop2000","Aug 20, 2006"

3.95,8.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This brew pours a clear brownish-ruby color. The head is one-finger in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is more like a doppelbock than a dunkel lager: caramel, malt, chocolate, more caramel. The taste is quite a bit more mellow than the aroma: caramel and malt with a sweet finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with very lively carbonation, perhaps too lively. Overall, this is a pretty good brew. It might not be the best dunkel lager around, but is certainly enjoyable.","KarlHungus","Apr 26, 2006"

Reminded me of the aroma of my homemade BBQ sauce that I make with molasses. Taste was of burnt sugar taste and a little bit astringent and medicinal. Not something I really cared for.

This is followed by crisp and earthy german hops like hallertau and tettanger. The Carbonation is medium and smooth, and the body is nearly full with a great texture. Finishes mostly clean.

4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Coffee colored to ruby, crystal clear, muscular buff head with fortitude, toasted malt nose, but not sickly sweet, nice hop counterpoint, tasted like it looked, very malty, toasty and bready, not heavy in the slightest!, moderate body, a good mouthfull, a perfect balance between light and heavy fare, a dark beer that I felt I could drink many of.

4.3,17.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A clear mahogany robe beneath a short cap of ivory welcomes you to this splendid dark lager. The head retention is good, and it leaves sheets of dripping spotty lace about the glass. Notes of toasty and slightly cocoaish malt reel you in; and the captivating, semi-rich flavor of its Munich and high-kilned malts delivers satisfaction and refreshment. It's not particularly complex, but it doesn't need to be - this beer's all about drinkability. It's perfectly balanced by a firm bitterness, and accented by some mild floral and spicy hops in the finish. It fades smoothly from the palate, leaving behind just a bit of dark malt and bitterness, leaving you ready for another sip. This is a beer you could quite easily finish without even realizing you've emptied your glass. Clean, concise, and clearly well-made, this dunkel is not to be missed.","NeroFiddled","Feb 16, 2005"

Flavour is richer than I expected. With nice notes of toffee which are of a very light porter quality.. Rich bread and burnt sugar with enough dryness to balance this brew out. As a German Macro Dunkle this blows Warsteiner out of the water. Mouthfeel is crisp and nice . Drinkability is high a bit of sweetness but no more than the average brown ale or some porters.. Overall this beer was surprisingly good","TinusTime","Feb 11, 2005"
4.04,10.7,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"A light tasting dunkel that poured dark with very brief lasting head but some lace hanging around for a few swallows. I was most interested by its unique aroma (could not pick out a dominate odor but it was totally pleasing )that mirrored its sweet molasses, bready and dark roasted malty taste with maybe a hint of maple, hops not very noticable. Finishes clean with a little sweet toasted grain aftertaste, but not cloying. Taste flattens mid mouth, smooth but left me wanting more mouthfeel (as most styles do).","karst","Jan 21, 2005"

The nose was sweet caramel, wtih a bit of roasted malt as well. The roasted tones come through much more prevalent as it warms. The flavor was nice. A slight chocolate and caramel backed up a nice roasted flavor. The feel was moderate to thick, and very easy drinking. Overall, this was good beer in a style that usually doesn't do much for me.","kmpitz2","Jan 08, 2005"

The smell is a little light at first, but gets stronger as it warms. Sweet chocolately maltiness dominates the smell. The taste is sweet and malty, with more chocolate and some caramel as well. There is a decent bit of hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is nice and strong. The drinkability is good as well. A nice solid dark lager.","SheepNutz","Jan 05, 2005"

Aroma is subdued, with floral hops and some notes of Munich malts which suggest some roasty chocolate flavored coffee. Mouthfeel is fully carbonated, but surprisingly light bodied. Taste is decent. Good roasted maltiness with some burnt coffee notes and a hint of toffee, along with mild floral hops bittering. Finish is crisply hoppy, with a burnt coffee aftertaste. A very enjoyable Dunkel Lager, with no flaws and excellent drinkability.","merlin48","Dec 08, 2004"

Tastes rather hoppier than the average dunkel. Some roasted malt sweetness in the foreground and a crisper, hoppier finish in the back. Pretty average dunkel, overall. The hops are nice, but too forceful and unorthodox for a dunkel lager. Don't get me wrong, malty roasted sweetness is the predominant character in this beer, maybe it's the kind of hops used that makes me think this dunkel is an anomaly amongst other German dunkels.","crookedhalo","Sep 07, 2004"

3.5,-4.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a deep chestnut brown color, topped by a cream colored head of moderate size. The head shows good retention as well, with a thin layer of foam sustained for half the glass. The aroma has a good dose of grassy, herbal hops to compliment the caramel and grain notes. Not spectacular, but intriguing none the less. The taste has a very pronounced roasted caramel malt taste, approaching a good vienna lager in it's sweetness and flavor profile, but a touch more restrained. A lingering roastiness is present in the aftertaste, which appears as soon as the light bitteress on the finish fades. The mouthfeel leans towards the smooth side, but the strength of the carbonation prevents it from truly enveloping the tongue. A touch of harsh grainiess appears mid bottle, and brings a grainy taste with it. This is not a great beer, but it also not a bad experience either. Just a shade better than average. Definitely worth a try if you are a fan of dark lagers.","aaronh","Jun 24, 2003"

The taste is much more restrained than the appearance would suggest, and the mouthfeel is a bit watery, although the excellent head adds some creaminess.

Malt starts big and deep, not quite as constricted as some Dunkels, plenty of caramelized sugar, some sweet chocolate, and just a touch of molasses. Taste flattens mid mouth (similar to other Dunkels, to my taste). Hops are apparent enough to lend an ending statement and prevent cloying, but have no particular individual characters.
