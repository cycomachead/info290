"Appearance: Dark brown with a thick film of very clingy and sticky off white foam. Smell: Light sour, kettle sugars, citric hops. Taste: Starts malty with dark sugars and finishes with a bitter hop accent and a touch of taertness. Mouthfeel: A little above medium carbonation and body."
"Overall it was worth trying, but not something I'd pursue again."

"It's been a little while since the gift set, but I couldn't resist putting another Christoffel beer in its proper vessel. This stuff pours a mostly clear russet topped by a finger or so of wan foam. The nose comprises dry caramel, barley, and a strong twinge of flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, the barley and flowers dominating the proceedings in a jack-cheddar string cheese twist sort of way. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a decent enough dunkel, but just not really my cup o' tea."

"330ml flip top bottle. Pours a dark cloudy brown with a small quickly fading tan head. Aroma and Taste of dark caramel malt, barley, Belgium yeast, bready, has some raisin and dark dried fruit esters and flavor, some tartness. Palate is a medium body, with mild carbonation lithe some sweet malt and yeast on the tongue. Finish is sweet caramel malt, yeasty and bready with some dried dark fruit and mild bitterness. Overall a good drinking brew."

"O - Hard to say on this one. Maybe it has gone bad, but the sour has potential in this had I known it was coming."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer because it is very drinkable and tastes like a “light” version of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale that has been aged and has lots of yeast sediment at the bottom of the glass."

"Overall, if you see a Christoffel Blond, grab it; if you see this, best leave it alone."
"Overall an unimpressive beer. Too focused on malts to be pleasant to drink."
"O/D - Nice strong-ish dark lager. Quite tasty and refreshing while being complex. Sweet and interesting."
"Overall an interesting experimental beer but does not seem like a great embodiment of a classical style."
"Impressed from start to finish (apart from the head fade)."
"D: Not one I could have multiple bottles of, but it's not a half bad bock."
"D- I enjoy this brew and think it might go well with a rich meat-centric meal...on it's own, one, maybe two would suffice. It's sweet, slightly tart and robust all at the same time. I definitely recommend giving this one a try and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised!"
"A nice ale. Easy uncomplicated, but not a bad drink at all."
"The mouthfeel was syrupy, below average carbonation. This probably accentuated the sweetness. This was indeed a malt heavy beer. I can have this beer anytime, but probably wont go beyond one, as this tends to satiate your appetite for beer more rapidly than any other beer I've known so far."
"The mouthfeel is a little dense for me. Smooth, but dense and not as refreshing as I like a Vienna Lager to be."
"I tried this beer on May 29, 2009 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a dark transparent brown colour with a thin white head. The aroma was heavy on the sweet malt and grain. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation. The flavour was surprisingly good. Sweet grainy malt, with a nice smooth finish. Very enjoyable."
"All-in-all a very good selection. I would seek this out again."
"Drinkability is OK but the beer gets boring after a while"
"Had this at the Brick Store Pub. Pours a hazy chestnut with little or lacing. The head does stick around for a bit. Quite sweet in the nose. Candied malt and honey. The taste is surprisingly quite a deal less sweet. In fact, I'd say it was more grainy and with a firm but subdues malt background. Truer to the style than I thought would be possible given the smell. Not a terribly exciting beer, but pleasant enough is a bit more robust and on the maltier end of the spectrum for the style."
"Drinkability is OK but this beer needs something more flavor-wise."
"2.5 M & 2.5 D: overly thin body; overly simple and a bit conflicting mouthfeel; overall another nose-outweighing-palate sample--couldn't bother to taste it again."
"Overall, not bad stuff and definitely a different take on the style. I would even say this would be classified closer to an oud bruin style. Try it if it's around, but don't go out of your way."
"Good, I could drink this and be happy, but not a favorite."

"I can see this pairing nicely with a stilton."
"Mouthfeel is light, mild carbonation. Drinkability is low, just because it is not very interesting. I've had much better Vienna Lagers, which isn't my favorite style to begin with. Well, at least the glass that came in the gift set is nice."
"2L Bottle shared with family (really fresh bottle): Poured a deep clear brown color beer with a nice nig foamy head with excellent retention and some good lacing. Aroma of caramel malt with some sweet ester is very interesting. Taste is very smooth with some creamy notes with some sweet caramel malt notes. Body is full with a huge malt backbone and some great carbonation. I have to admit to being really surprised about that one."
"This is still my favorite vienna...the one by which I measure all others...its authentic and as true to style as you can get...Anton Dreher would be pleased with this brew."
"When poured from the swing-top bottle into my sniffer glass, it had a dark copper color with a tan, tightly beaded head. The initial aroma is fruit, possibly raisins followed by the scent of sweet wet grains and toffee. The flavor has a pronounced sweetness with the roasted grains just pushing through. Very minimal hop presence. All and all, this beer is a good medium bodied beverage for anyone who prefers the malty side of beer."
"D - Very little drinkability, the flavours are too odd and too complex. The alcohol taste also makes it hard to put away."
"it's a worthy beer that's otherwise hard to come by. Hi ho, oh well."
"A decent vienna style lager but a bit too candi sweet and a little light on the malt."
"I see this is a vienna lager and I honestly have no idea if this is a good example of the style, but this beer is full of flavor and very enjoyable."
"Bottom line: A pretty malty sample of the style and if you like malty lagers, this one will surely please you."
"Drinkabilty is good as well."
"This beer was different, but enough that I actually liked it. Pours to a cloudy brownish gold, with an off-white head that dissipates soon, but leaves good lacing. Initial aroma is malty sweetness, nuts and caramel, but as the glass warms, the aroma is much more fruity, mostly apples and grapes. Flavor is a sour fruit, again, apples and grapes, and the finish is sour and dry, but good. Its a shame this is not made any longer."
"A crisp, hoppy bite on the roof of the mouth with a good deal of effervescence all over without being frothy. A decent beer but nuthin' great."
"Aoma holds sweet malts that invoke raisin and fruit cake. Opaque dark amber in color with a quickly dimishing light tan head. Fore is malty sweet with dark fruit notes, mild caramel and a light not quite tartness that puncuates the malt nicely. Smooth and subtle."
"Heres a brown-crimson brew with a no-nonsense malt aroma and a shallow off-white head. The smell is bready, with a bit caramel and toasted grain. Theres a little alcohol in the aroma, along with a hint of yeast, but almost no hop presence. The taste is similar: sweet, toasty, and malty. The finish is pretty sweet, and the whole experience is certainly malt-centered. I think that the brew is a little more fruity than necessary, and isnt quite balanced. Still, this is a very tasty, very drinkable beer. Very appealing for a malt lover."
"Mocha, plum, prune and cream scented brown liquid. Plump and hydrating textures leave flavors of plum reduction. Outrageous aromatic intensity of mellow brown rum, sticky black fruits, caramel and cocoa coincides with an easy, soft-textured, gulpable mouthful. This is a classic double bock. Andechs has nothing on this."
"BBE 08-06. Good head and a dark amber beer with some haze. Nose is very caramellic and pale. Some maltyness there but overal not much to detect. Taste is also very caramellic and malty but further missing bit of taste and freshness. Good carbonisation but overal empty mouthfeel. Drinkable but hard to find taste in this brew so hard to really enjoy."
"This beer poured a ruby red color with a medium off-white head. Moderate lacing. Aroma was strong on malts with toasted bread notes dominating. A bit of a nutty and sour element in there as well. Flavors matched the aromas. Lots of residual sugars in here and the body seems a bit thin. Maybe this wasn't lagered long enough? Hops are weak in the background. There are some nice toasted almond flavors deep down. The slight sourness I got from the pils is more prevalent here. Finish is nice and clean and dries out any off flavors. A decent offering but nowhere near the level of this brewery's pils offering."
"This beer feels medium to heavy in body with a sharp carbonation sting. Very crisp, but not so much clean. Finishes with a light tartness and a good hops bitterness that linger for quite some time after the finish. I can even taste a hint of alcohol, which is surprising for 6% lager. A decent beer when fresh, but otherwise it can turn into a tart cardboard bomb (such as my previous review that I edited over with this fresher sample to give it some justice)."
"orange amber/reddish/copperish color with a fluffy white head. smell is very malty sweet with biscuity aromas and no noticable hop aroma very smooth. that is the most noticable and best part of this brew. taste is kind of bland but good for a hot one like today. very easy to drink, and again super smooth. i catch hints of bread and fresh cut grass and i think i can taste bits of banana, but that doesnt make so much sense.."
"Nice bottle. The beer itself pours a very nice dark goldish brown with a decent head. The nose is malty with a dash of fresh hops. the taste is well balanced with malt to the front with a sweetish finish. A very good example of the style with the Dutch touch."
"Reddish brown, Ok all the way. One of the best Viennas I have tried, not too malty. Spiciness and fruit in the yeast, peach, cinammon, berries. Medium mouthfeel. Touch of roast. Pinch of candy sugar and Good finish and aftertaste. A better than average brew."
"Drinkability: I was actually really impressed with this beer. Compex but very drinkable. I enjoyed it quite a bit. I picked up the last gift pack, that included the Robertus, Christoffel Blond, and a custom glass for $5, and I felt like that was a pretty fair deal. If I saw it again, I'd definitely give it another try."
"Still nice, and well worth a run."
"A slightly hazey dark amber beer with orange highlights. Has a big off white head. The aroma is lightly sweet with a strong graineyness. Made me think of a just opened bag of grain. A sweet grainy flavor ( like Grapenuts cereal ) predominates the flavor with only a ghost of bitternesson the finish."
"Pours a hazy amber/reddish with a thick, fluffy light tan head. Mild sweet lager aromas prevail. Some malt richness noticable. Interesting palate flavors of maner malts, hop bitterness and a strange vegetal finish. Mouthfeel is flavorful, but somewhat bitter and astringent. A strange beer for me. I enjoyed trying it, but won't try again."
"Light bodied and dry, sort of a modified vienna lager."
"(330 ml swingtop bottle, bought in Denmark). Copper colour, hazy, good thick head. Lovely aroma of spices, leather and caramel - from the aroma, Id swear this was a Belgian ale. Bottom fermented it is, and its easier to sense this is a lager through the flavour and aftertaste, which still are very good. Malty flavour, mild spices and caramel without too much sweetness. Lightly hopped. Moreish."
"Pours a gorgeous ruby-amber from the swingtop with an impressive amount of carbonation and a nice head which quickly tapers to a fine lace that sticks around. The aroma is good with candy sugars, fruit, mollases. The taste however fell a little short of my expectations. It reminds me a lot of Moretti LaRossa, but not with nearly as much malt. I'm a malt fanatic, so what might not be enough for me may satisfy someone else. There is also a surprising but subtle hop bite at the end with a nice warming alcohol feeling. A solid, but unremarkable beer."
"Pretty nice, as it is, though...yeah, I'll take another..."
"Pours a hazy brown/orange with a thin head,I get a slight toffee note in the aroma along with a little orange.Taste is definently malt tilted some toffee and bready malt with that light orangy note,pretty appetizing flavors going on.A nice beer malty and fruity could handle drinking a few of these."
"This brew is a hazy brown/red color, basically no head (it was white for a second). Dark malts scent, somewhat sweet. First impression with the taste is a nice zap of hop, nothing overpowering but well blended with a nice caramel malty base. Someday ill be able to id the strain of hops, but i have had these before, a more bitter varitey. Its good."
"Pours with a two-finger white head that goes quickly and leaves no lace. Dark cloudy amber color. Good carbonation. Nose is malty. Starts sweet and finishes with a balance of hops and malt. A nice dark lager. Medium bodied. $10 for a 2-pack of 330s with a glass."
"This is a refreshing and interesting brew, with a pleasantly surprising hop emphasis. I definitely wish my bottle started with a bit more than 33cl."
"A semi-cloudy pour that is an amber colour with a tinge of pink to it. An interesting nose that is both tart and lighty fruity with a lemon twist and grassy notes. The taste seems very fresh...fruity in a watermelon sort of way and citrusy. Moderately hopped and the bitterness counter-balances the fruitiness quite nicely. A smooth and lively mouthfeel with nice staying power. Good drinkability. An above average brew."
"End result is....Malt advantage, 2-1.5"
"Tastes somewhat unusual. Initially dry and a little acetic with a mild hop finish. Quite pleasant as it starts to warm up some."
"my bottle has just got home from a hour long walk across the city so is a little shaken and consequently a cloudy woody colour. Initial tastes are quickly followed by the warming glow of 6% alchol imperticbly going down. In taste it is a little hard to describe, complex sweetish flavours followed by a lingering and interestingly different hoppy aftertaste."
"A very nice dark lager, nice hoppiness and nice and dry with a hint of berry fruit in there, i'd love to try the blonde."
