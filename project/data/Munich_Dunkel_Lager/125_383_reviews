"This has a very nice look to it. Lacing exists from what was previously a fine cream colored head, but now receded to a rim of foam and aforementioned gentle lacing. Nose is a touch muted, but what I can detect is a touch biscuity and maybe a tad nutty. Taste comes punching through with an immediate bitterness that gives way to that nutty thing that I could smell, hints of something spicy and just a faint berry presence. On the otherwise, crisp finish, we have just a hint of tart mixed into the final ""eff you"" attitude of bitterness. Very complex without being too much of a thinker. Haven't had it? Do yourself a solid and give it a whirl."
"Overall- It is OK to me, i noticed many others rated it a lot higher."
"Beer of the month club done good!"

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a light cola color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is malty, bready. Taste is toasted malts, bready, just a touch of sweetness. Feels light in the mouth and overall is an easy drinking beer."

"This is a very good dunkel – only lack of lacing detracts from its appearance, otherwise the beautiful clear dark amber is very enticing.  The toasty aroma is welcoming, the toasted malt flavor is darn near perfect, and the palate is delightful.  This is possibly the best beer Penn Brewing produces."

"Overall: Not the greatest of the dark lagers that I have had, but it is decent. I prefer the higher carbonation of a St. Pauli Girl or Heineken, but this one probably has some nicer flavors."

"Side by side with some other Penn stuff. Pours a dark amber brown color with small off white to light khaki head. Aroma is nice, with some sweet dark fruits, light toffee, chocolate notes. Flavor is a lightly spicy chocolate, clean finish, and medium sweetness. Medium bodied with low plus carbonation. A really nice brew that could pass as a winter warmer or a fall cookout beer. I'd have this again."

"Overall - Great beer, balanced well, low alcohol and easy to drink. Combine that with a very affordible price , and year round avaiblity, this is a local winner for sure. One of the better dunkels out there."

"a satisfying nuttiness. Noble malts make a late appearance as this beer warms that adds solid balance and complexity. A lot to like here if you like the style."
""
""

"This review is based on the newer 2012 batch. It pours a medium brown with light tan head that persists during the session. Aroma is sweet malt with aromatic notes of vanilla. The taste is a quick burst of roasted malt and hints of vanilla with a rather polite short lived bitter after note. I still like it slightly better than the locally available dunkel from Sly Fox but not enough to drive for 5 hours."
"Clean and easy-drinking. Nice malty flavor without being too heavy."
""
""
"Dark chocolatey brown in color with amber hues and a deep chill haze to start. Poured with a rich off-white foam that reduced to a thick cap that left sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. A mellow, pleasant combination of roasted, chocolate and toasted malt. Thick, but delicate malty feel. Roasted and chocolate malt flavors up front and into the middle. Moderate bitter hop flavors are introduced in the middle and intensify toward the end only to taper out at the finish. Finishes with a delicate roasted malt aftertaste. A fabulous dunkel!"
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."
""
"Poured into a pilsner. Color was a nice medium dark brown that was partially transparent. Had a nice 2 finger cream head that faded to 1/4 inch after a few minutes. Aroma was interesting. Had hints of fruity sweet, as well as sweet grainy bread. Kinda like orange flavored oatmeal bread. Flavor carried over the slightly sweet fruity flavorbefore shifting to a malty note, and then finishing with just a tad of bitterness. Was a bit thin and watery. Carbonated well, but just seemed too thin. Overall a good beer. Nice subtlety throughout."
""
"The beer poured a rich brown with a tan head. The aroma was of dark malt and a hint of cherries. The taste was toasted malt with a coffee middle and a cherry finish,and all with a wonderful smokey undertone. The feel is medium and dry. I really like this beer. Sort of like throwing my best pitch and they caught it in the wheelhouse."

"D: another solid lager offering from penn brewing co. out of pittsburgh, pa. good flavor on a really drinkable brew."
"Although this brew is very drinkable, I don't think I will seek it out and I would recommend getting actual German versions of this (they often are just as low priced if not even lower)."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Really easy to drink and very refreshing on a beautiful spring day here in NYC. Definitely an easy drinking session beer and one I would certainly get again. Very true to the style."
"O: This beer is very drinkable and sessionable, especially given all of the malty flavors. I could easily drink this beer all night long."
""
""
""
""
"O: A bit lighter than I personally enjoy, but it seems that's typical of the style. I can't say I've had a lot of experience with Munich Dunkels; I will have to search out more to do a comparison."
"Penn Dark just isn't doing it for me. Maybe a sub-par bottle? Old bottle? I dunno, but I have a hard time believing this is as the beer was intended. I'll pass."
""
""
"overall - Superb for a dunkle. Sweet nose with some nutty/chocolaty tones. Malty with some hop bitterness for balance. Very drinkable and not heavy."
"Dark, dark brown beer with a thin, foamy head. Aromas of toasted chocolate and coffee. Malted chocolate and mild coffee flavor with hints of caramel. The caramel becomes more pronounced as the lager warms. This is a really enjoyable example of a dark lager; it's almost a dessert."
""
""
""
"O: There are some off flavors that I find distracting. Behind all of this, there is a good balance between dark fruits and breadiness."
""
""
""
""
"Overall the best beer I had of the night. It was light, good flavor, and went well with my meal. If ever there again I could see myself ordering a couple."

"o - Overall a pretty decent Dunkel. Nothing mind belowing but a nice malty nose and pretty easy to drink. A little spice in the taste. Would try it again."

""
"overall - good for the style but isnt something id search out"
""
"Taste is simple, chocolate drizzled roasted nuts. Straight-forward and never gets overly roasty-astringent or sweet. Perfectly balanced lager and really is nice. This is probably the best domestic dunkel I have ever had, right up there with Franconia. Man...I would kill to have this available locally, I could drink it all day. Love me a good dunkel!"
""
"D- was this made in Germany? Penn brewing nails the style this time with a great flavored, easy drinking dunkel."
"Overall: A nice bready beer. I do not find this one boundary pushing, but rather in the very solid category. I could have several of these, but this is also not the first beer I would reach for."
"O) A pleasant brew. I would definitely have another."
"This was sort of an odd beer, maybe I got a bad one, but it seemed like a lot of things were off. I will have to try this again sometime."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Something rich enough to be substantive, but clean and light enough to be quite drinkable. I haven't had a proper dunkel since Germany and this one brought me back properly! Sessionable for sure. Prost!"
"D: Very drinkable lager, well balanced flavor and aroma. Very smooth for a darker style ale."
"Loved this. Hard to find one that won't cost you a mortgage, even harder to find the style done right in this country. Minor flaws are just that. I'll look for his again."
"Slightly sweet with a touch of sour. Mostly darker malt flavor. The hop is not very present, perhaps only to balance. Good body with a below average level of carbonation."
"Not extremely familiar with the style but a pretty good beer. Doesn't drink as smoothly as other dark German beers I have had."
"This beer poured out as a nice dark brown color. It has a pretty good looking tan head on it. The lacing could have been a little better. The smell of the beer was roasted and had the typical lager smell in there too. The taste of caramel and bitter coffee were upfront on this beer, the aftertaste was of some lager bitterness. The mouthfeel is light enough to consume several in a sitting if you choose to. Overall this beer is surprisingly pretty good. I was impressed by how much it tasted like a real German Dark Lager."
"Notes: I am happy I picked this one up a tasty brew all the way around. Cheers."
"Pours a clean deep amber to brown in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, small roast, caramel, and small faint lager like notes. In the taste, coffee, caramel sweetness, and faint hints of lager. A small bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry hint of caramel in the aftertaste. Nice roasty flavors with lager notes under all of it."
"a decent brew. goes down so easy, but remains flavorful throughout. nothing earth-shattering, but one that you can drink and enjoy without contemplating."
"O: Had drank this plenty of times before and knew this one was one of my Penn favorites. Wasn't until I actually sat down for a more in-depth review did I realize how good this beer actually was. It's quite an underdog or a surprise hit."
"Pours a transparent reddish brown in color. Tan head falls quickly to a wisp and small ring. Smell is dark bread, molasses, licorice - a good aromatic nose on this one. Taste is similar to the aroma. This is a pretty tasty brew...it finishes with a nice light hop dryness. Body is light/ medium and the carbonation is mild but enjoyable. If I could get one locally it would be in my regular rotation."
"This is a nice beer and very drinkable. I could session this very easily and it definitely hits the spot when I am in the mood for something light yet dark. Good stuff."
"Thanks to radioscooter for the sample"
"I liked this beer, it gets smoother as it warms up and is light but full of flavor. I found it more enjoyable than most dark lagers that I have had in the past."
"Fantastic drinakability, even for a characteristically drinakable style. Flavorful and straight forward without becoming burdening after a couple. Penn rarely misses point on the traditional German styles (which is sometimes more than I can say for their newer American styles) and this one is no exception."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is smooth and rich and sldes down the throad. A very drinkable beer, especially at only 5 pct abv."
"I would drink this in bottles again, but look forward to trying the draft."
"D: I could drink a lot of this for sure but I did feel that it needed a stronger malt presence and a bit more mouthfeel. I would pull back on the roast malts and use more Munich."
"D: It is nice, but not amazing. Enjoyable and I wouldn't turn away if offered it."
"This beer tastes to me a lot like a tradional bock. Its very nutty crisp and pretty refreshing. It had a really smooth aftertaste and is really enjoyable in any situation."
"Overall - Beautifully complex in the manner of a good German beer, giving you both a big bready sweetness and crispness in character, as well. Nice to have ""big taste"" that isn't a 13% barrel-aged brew of some kind. This is far and away the best beer I've had from the brewery. This one will keep me coming back to them. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: I have had better Penn Darks from the brewery in a bottle and on draft. Certainly would try this again because of the freshness. Not sure why this batch had a creamy mouthfeel, flatness, and low carbonation."
"Drinkability: this is one drinkable beer. Flavors and scents are really enjoyable. Lower alcohol helps in this sessionable dark beer."
"Nice drinkable brew, smooth and clean finish."
"A nice, non-offensive beer that would make any beer lover proud."
"That said, the Penn Munich Dunkel Lager was pretty good. Good malty aromo and flavor but, as expected, light on the head and stomach. Aroma is not that strong, flavor is ok. Drinkability was good but I don't know how many more of these I'll order."
"Smooth, medium bodied, slightly warming in the throat. A really nice beer overall. Could quaff several without any problem."
"D-this is extremely easy drinking and has a pretty good amount of taste to it. definitely a solid session beer!"
"Consumed: 3/8/2010"
"F: Finishes still pretty sweet, with more of that syrupy flavor coming through, but continues with that nice roast flavor and more of the crisp finish of a lager. It doesn't leave any real off flavors either. A nice beer, especially for a lager style which I'm not usually a fan of. This is a great session beer if I ever found one."
"Pours a clear amber color with a slightly tanned head. Little bit of lace along the glassware. Nice roasted grain and malt aroma that is a little bread-like with a slight hop character in the tail end of the nose. Taste is lightly roasted grain and slightly nutty malt character. Light bodied, moderately carb level and a crisp finish. This is really one drinkable beer. 4% labels it as a good sessionable candidate but I could picture myself drinking quite a few too quickly."
"My first Penn... and it is a good one..."
"Overall, a pretty solid dark lager. Tasty and robust despite a low ABV."
"D - Pretty solid beer that is easy to drink. It's not a great beer, but it's definately not a bad one."
"Review from notes taken on: 9/1/09"
"Penn dark may not be the best of the style, but it is a very solid brew. Based on the taste, price and availability, I find myself grabbing this beer more and more often. Its especially good for party situations when I know I'm going to knock a few back."
"I would buy this again when given the mood."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I'm usually not a big fan of Lagers (although I'm trying to sample more of them), but I'm really enjoying this beer."
"The beer doesn't reinvent the wheel as far as Dunkels, but it is worth trying."
"D: Good for a darker beer, too roasted to drink too many, but a good balance."
"A pretty decent and easy to drink dunkel, but I've had better."
"Pours a very dark brown color with a khaki color head that measures one finger. Smell is of roasted malts that are very sweet much like sweet bread. The taste has a sweet malt smooth taste. The mouthfeel is little carbonation with a smooth finish. The drinkability is very high on this, just a smooth flavorful beer that goes down easy."
"The body is medium to light with ample carbonation and plenty of character to make this something worth trying. Overall, a great dunkel that beat the pants off most macro versions of the style."
"This cold brew shows a dark mohagany color, slightly hazed with a thin off-white/light tan head and a bit of lacing. The aroma is a very solid brown sugar malt and some yeasty bread and grapes. The flavor brings on tart apple and lots more brown sugar malt. It has a decided bite that lodges in the back of your throat and tongue that suggests a slightly smokey, dry light citrus/cracker kind of hoppiness. There's plenty of smooth carbonation and it has a relatively light body, spritzy and refreshing mouth feel. Very drinkable. Not my favorite style but this one has some personality and i could drink a few of these in a pinch, no problem."
"D- Pretty easy to drink but I wont be looking for any more of this one."
"Comes out of the bottle a dark chocolaty brown that is slightly translucent, capped by a fairly thick pale tan head. Malty, slightly spicy aroma has a hint of molasses. Rich malty aroma has strong tones of cinnamon and cloves and a touch of caramel. Texture is smooth and fizzy. Quite satisfying."
"Drinkability: A solid brew, but for me nothing special. I'm starting to believe I either just don't have an affinity for many German styles, or a lot of these domestic breweries of such brews are overrated. There's flavor going on here, and I could drink these pretty easily, but I don't find anything more than above average that I want to keep returning to."
"Poured into a traditional American pint glass, this Pittsburg beer offered a nice clean head with rich dark brown hues often found in German style dark lagers. The brewery is consistent in their beer making quality and this dunkel is another winner with roasted notes along side a teeth-lingering crispness with a subtle sweetness and enjoyable maltiness on the finish."
"I really enjoy it from October through March. Very nice body and fresh taste. Not sugary or over carbonated. Very enjoyable."
"Quite the enjoyable Dunkel Lager. Smooth, creamy, roasty. Everything that needs to be there is there. Good job by the PBC."
"despite its flaws, overall its a good beer that is pretty drinkable and enjoyable. but ill just take a regular penn pils over this anyday."
"Overall, an excellent beer. I felt like I stumbled upon gold with this one, and I would definitely buy this one again and again. I think I found a new favorite :)"
"The bottle says ""If you were going to spend eternity drinking one beer, this would be the one."" I heartily agree."
"D - easy drinking beer."
"5.0 D"
"Poured into a 12oz glass forming a light tan head over a deep brown body with a good bit of visible carbonation. The head dissipates quickly to a light frost on top and lacing on the glass. There's roasted grain,light toffee and a light spicy hops in the smell. The taste is just like the smell with a medium body feel and a slightly dry toasted grain finish with a herbal/peppery lingering hops note. This is one of my favorites and I hope that Penn Brewing keeps making their beers, they almost make lawnmowing something to look forward to."
"Taste smooth malt with subtle chocolate note and I get a peaty-smoky hint - yet clean finish. Mouthfeel is also smooth but surprised me with moderate carbonation which doesn't affect drinkability at all. Could be a great session beer."
"A really good beer for the price, and these days it's all about value."
"Pours a very dark amber brown hue with a one finger fluffy light tan colored head that dies down to a thin layer which lasts throughout. No lacing to be seen what so ever on the sides of the glass. Smell consists of chocolate malts, noble hops, and toasted grains. Caramel, nuts, and musty earth in the nose as well. Taste starts off sweet with caramel, toffee, and sun tea. Midway some spicy hops emerge with a slight metallic flavor. Aftertaste has some roasted notes and buttered biscuits, nice balance overall. Light to medium body with a soft creamy feel in the mouth and a subtle carbonation. A very drinkable and flavorful beer, one I wouldn't have a problem putting down on a regular basis. Thanks again Greg for hooking me up with this one!"
"D - A solid dunkel worth revisiting. Nothing completely extraordinary but nonetheless a very well balanced and drinkable beer."
"I tried this beer because I had a Warsteiner dunkel at an outdoor German Christmas market and, before that, a Penn Pilsner at a Pirates game at PNC park. I had tried neither the Munich dark style nor the brewery before these two, and having liked both I was stoked to see I could combine them. The result is impressive. Looking forward to trying more of Penn's offerings."
"D- Easy to pound these back. A nice session beer. this would be good from a keg if you wanted to get one for a party."
"Just like all of the Penn beers I've tried this one is extremely drinkable. Balanced flavors, a light body, sessionable ABV% and overall tastiness all contribute."
"Thanks to seanpachefeddffa (however you spell it) for the extra."
"Drinkabiliy. Honestly I was a little disapointed with this one."
"Drinkability/Notes: Overall, a good beer that is very drinkable. Enough different flavors to keep things interesting and the light body makes it really easy to drink. Not the best Munich Dunkel I've had but still a good one. Seek and Enjoy"
"sixer $8.99 from Whole Foods Fair Lakes"
"Drinkability: simple but tasty lager. Easy to quaff and a pure sessionable beer."
"Not bad on the palate"
"Not sure if I would go out of my way to purchase this one again. I drank the Penn Weizen not too long ago and I really enjoyed that so I'm pretty eager to see what else this brewer has to offer. I could see how a lot of people would really like this though. It packs a flavorful punch without being too heavy. Maybe it just wasn't my cup of tea."
"This is a nice example of one of my favorite styles."
"Penn's Dark is light-medium in body, softly carbonated, and very drinkable."
"D: Good everyday session brew and one well deserving of the Penn name. The first of four Penn reviews from a solid, classic brewery all Keystoner's should be proud to bear our name."
"This is very drinkable as no aspect of this beer is overpowing. One could drink several given the 5.0 ABV. Like Helles made by this brewery, I was expecting more given that this brewery specializes in the classic German styles."
"Very easy to drink, but not as rewarding as it should be"
"Drinks easy, but I've had better Dunkels"
"This is a great dark lager, could drink a lot of this."
"Pours a blackish brown with a slight head. Nose is roasty and malty. Flavor is slightly sweet and not as roasted or nutty as the color and nose might suggest. Actually this had a very light body but coinciding with that was not much a flavor punch. Actually, this be could be a session beer, but I am going to stick with just the one. Thanks to JohnTravolta21 for the bottle."
"Mouthfeel is ok for the style. Drinkability is good. This is a well made beer and would be great for a session beer."
"Penn Dark is roughly the same level of quality as Penn Pilsner and Penn Weizen. That is, decent and drinkable without being a standout. It may not be a fair comparison, but St. Nicholaus Bock Bier is still the undisputed king of the PBC hill as far as I'm concerned."
"D. Very good as well. Possibly my favorite micro lager."
"D: I really liked this beer, but it seemed a little heavy, where I am not sure if I could have more than 2 in one sitting."
"D: An excellent lager with a very comforting, warming character owing to its malty, nutty, and toasted flavors with enough noble hops to make it very refreshing as well."
"Mouth feel is light to medium and this is very drinkable. I could easily enjoy this year round despite its Autumn/winter appearance."
"I thought it would be a little more robust though! for me it was almost but not quite there. This beer seems to have a bit of an identity crisis ,decent drinking beer have had it many times!"
"D Tastes a lot better then it smells, doesn't look as good as it tastes, a little too much carbonation for my liking... but ... it's a nice mix of a lager and the taste of heavier porter or a stout"
"All in all I think this beer is good, but I believe that my expectations were just a bit high. I would definitely suggest trying it. Again the freshness may have been a factor in my situation."
"Very enjoyable beer. Tasty and right on the spot to what I would expect from a dark lager."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite dunkel I have ever tried. A little lacking in flavor for me."
"D - This was quite good. I look forward to finding more from this brewery."
"Clear, dark copper color with a solid, frothy head already leaving some lace on the glass. Mild aroma at first, sweet bread crust and light nuts and caramel. Rich dark malt flavor, medium bodied, clean and firm. Some earthiness. Pretty good, though nothing too exciting."
"Pours a hazy medium brown with a head that pours a couple of fingers high and then sticks around as a swirly cap. Richly malty, but dry with aromas of bitter chocolate, baked bread, and a little minerality. Taste is quite pleasant, but a little light. More of that bitter chocolate, but it is slight and way in the background. Slightly spicy grain, restrained earthy hops, and some more baked bread flavors round it out. Smooth, relatively light and an anjoyable drinking experience."
"Definitely a nice and drinkable beer. I'd buy more and recommend."
"Really glad I tried it, I'll be trying this one again in the future. Went great with the porterhouse steak."
"Tasted on 3/26/08."
"Bottle smell is cocoa and sweet malt hints with a nice background of floral hops and honey. Pours to a sparly almost to be mistaken for Coca-Cola color and consistency. Carbonation seems a litttle high on the pour. The taste is bittersweet cocoa with nice easy bitterness. The carbonation however seems too high just as on the pour. This beer is not heavy but has great multi-flavor aspects. I would buy this brew again."
"Drinkability - I didn't enjoy this beer very much. It is something you could drink if you are in to lighter beers."
"Pennsylvania Brewing Company Penn Dark Lager pours a dark amberish brown with a short fizzy head that quickly dissipates. The smell is mild to medium of malts with a distinct lagerish aroma. Taste is ok, good for a lager, but there is just not a whole lot there, perhaps a little lightly malted flavor. For the most part it just taste like a typical light flavored lager. Mouthfeel is thin and watery with a medium to high carbonation. Drinability is ok, it certainly is liquid, but I'm rather bored with its lack of taste and watery feel."
"On a side note, the BA tasting notes say that this beer has 5% alcohol by volume. According to Pennsylvania Brewery's web page it is only 4%."
"Poured a deep brown color with a short and light white head that settles fast and laces the glass pretty well all the way down. It had a sweet roasted malty smell, not much else. The taste is good - a nice sweet malty base over a slight bitterness at the end of it. It is balanced well. The mouthfeel is good - very smooth. The drinkability is good too as I could have a few of these. Worth a try."
"MF&D - Medium bodied dark lager. Goes down easy and coats the mouth well. I'll have another."
"A very good beer. I enjoyed it and would definitely drink it again although it is probably a little too heavy for session drinking."
"Pours a very dark amber, slight haze with dark mahogany highlights. Just a small head is poured that is quickly dissipated. Aromas are quite spicy, a bit of smoke (hotdog like), roasty malts, and toasted pecans. On the palate, the deeply toasted malts continue bringing along toasted multigrain bread, more smoke (strange?), some vanilla and an oaked feel. Body is medium, moderately sweet with a medium long finish. This is a tasty style, easy drinking, but quite filling for the gravity. I suppose the Hallertau/roasted malt combination could be giving me the sense of smokiness. Penn Brewing continues to make solid examples of German beer styles, recommended!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Carbonation is good. Decently crisp and refreshing. Good beer for a hot day. Pretty smooth and drinkable. Overall, it's pretty solid. I wouldn't turn it down."
"A rich brown in color with a slight white head. Sweet and malty in smell with a slight coppery scent. The sweetness of this beer comes to the front with the malt close behind. Easy drinking and the color can fool the lay observer. this beer is surprisingly light in taste and drinkability."
"Overall, this is one of my favorite beers regardless of style. It is quite enjoyable and makes for a great ""session"" beer."
"D - This is an overall good beer one that I'd drink all night if it was offered as the special but I wouldn't seek this one out to buy for home use"
"Overall, a solid lager. Well made and highly drinkable."
"Description: Seems like a long time since I have had a Munich Dunkel Lager on tap. This one is fresh and reminds me of one that I had in a brewpub in Bremen, Germany. Very good interpretation of the style."
"D - pretty good IMO. This isn't my favorite style of beer, but I am really enjoying this right now and will definitely enjoy the other 2 I have. Definitely would recommend trying it if the opportunity arose. All in all a pretty fine beer."
"I really like this beer. It could easily become a session favorite of mine if I had constant access to it. But Penn beers aren't found in as plentiful numbers in DC for some reason than they are in other areas. But I would definitely grab another one of these. Easy going brew all around, but well crafted."
"Pours a dark caramel brown like a can of pop with a slight creamy looking head. Heavy dark malts in the smell with a hint of yeast? Smell follows flavor with a huge roasted malt taste. Slight coffee hints afterward. Medium mouthfeel lends to the not too filling feel. Very drinkable and excellent brew."
"D--I could drink this all night. Very nice beer. Nothing is so assertive that you would get tired of it. Very much worth a try."
"An easy drinking brown hued lager with a one-fingered beige head. Body is light to medium and easy on the taste buds. Light caramel sweetness in the nose (as well as in the flavor). Add a slight nuttiness to that with a very mild hop character. A good beer."
"Pours a clear but dark brown. Much ruby showing through when held to light. Nose is mild with slight caramel attributes to it, but overall not much really going on here that blows me away. Flavor brings a nice and deep, yet smooth, ride. Thick malts that stay consistent. Slight roasted aspect. Minor nutty tone going on here. Feel is very good with carbonation and the liquid has a smooth and thicker bodied thing going on. Another very good beer by PBC."
"The surprise in this beer is the notable presence of the alcohol, despite an ABV that is well within session range. Not to fear, though, the effect is muted as would be expected of its strength, or comparative lack thereof. It's a flavorful easy drinker that goes down smooth and makes a second a virtual certainty. No knock on the bigger brewery, but this is the beer that Yuengling drinkers might want to consider graduating to."
"Well-enough balanced and inoffensive, it's an easy-drinking dunkel lager."
"Decent beer, roasted malt powers this lager but is balanced well with the subtle hops and alcohol but the maltiness lingers even to the finish. Smooth as can be, I found it oddly refreshing to drink, well balanced and a nice interpretation of the style."
"This brew pours a dark brown color with a medium thin beige head with decent retention. Stringy lacing. Roasted malt and nuts in the nose. Medium body with a smooth mouthfeel. Roasted malt and caramel flavors, along with lightly floral hops. The finish is mildly nutty and sweet and does not last long. Decent overall."
"Nice dinner beer. I'd keep in my fridge if I could get it in Indiana."
"a good beer to drink after a long day at Hidden Valley, where a few friends and I would drink the ski-in bar clean out of stock days after there shipment came in. similar to the sam adams black lager, but much more viscus. smooth drinking, and an almost porter-like taste (not quite that thick). delicious on tap or out of the bottle a must try if your ever in my home town."
"D: I mean this beer is OK, but not something I'd buy again, not a very good example of the Munich Dunkel style out there, when Ayinger's roaming around."
"This arrived with a big, deep-tan head above a dark brown colored beer, like cola, with ruby highlights. The nose had a slightly sweetish aspect. The mouthfeel was thin, but approaching medium, not out-and-out watery. I perceived notes of licorice and chocolate in the mouth and on the tongue. The finish was lingering with a semi-sweet chocolaty aftertaste."
"Ooh, definitely the hoppiest dunkel lager I've ever had. The malt could stand up a little more, but there's still a nice subtle caramel and cocoa taste with a burnt toast edge. The hops, along with a lot of the flavor, fade as the beer warms. They were grassy and funky before, now they've become lame as I finish the beer. Frankly this beer is still a bit bland. Nice and plenty tasty at times, but a little light on flavor."
"Full bodied with a light mouthfeel and some grainyness. Very smooth and refreshing. A real crowd pleaser,not a beer i would want to drink all night,but won't complain a bit if I had to."
"Clear, chestnut colour with a nice reddish brown hue, topped by beige foam. Head retention was alright and lacing was on the sticky side. Quite nice looking. Aromas were of sweet malts, caramel, and a hint of roast, with a pleasant nutty character. Low bitterness, definitely on the sweet side, with a mild grainy/roasty quality. Bitterness became a little stronger in the finish. Lightish bodied with moderate carbonation and a little residual sugar left behind by the yeast. Not bad at all, but a little too sweet for my palate without having a full, malty character to back it up."
"Pours close to stout dark brown with a very minimal off white head. Smell is minimal malt, some faint chocolate and fig. Taste is stronger than the smell. Some malt, dried fruit, minimal molasses and coffee. Very light on the tongue with a lively and nice carbonation. Very smooth and drinkable beer. Yummy dunkel."
"Overall impression: Not my cup of tea but very well done. A malty, clean, refreshing dark beer. Recommended."
"Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown with a half inch off-white/tan head. Head retention and lacing are both OK. It smells like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate and some coffee, but the aroma is on the light side. Luckily the taste is stronger, it tastes like roasted malt, chocolate, dark fruit, molasses and coffee. Body is light/medium, and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good, I think it would be a good session beer as it goes down easy and tastes good. It wouldn't be hard to drink a few of these at a time. I'd recommend it to others to try."
"Overall- Bought this on a whim and was very happy. This is a session beer without a doubt. Good thing this is easily obtainable in my area."
"This is another highly drinkable lager from Penn. It's well balanced and tasty. It's dark, but not scary."
"This taste like a lighter porter.Dark brown body with ruby highlites and a nice small off white head.Smells like funky dark malts.Taste like a lighter porter also.Tastes are dark malt,and not much hop but its not overly sweet.Mouthful is easy going down and the carbonation is easy also.not much of a booze bite.I like this beer and I think you will like it also."
"Pretty easy to drink I can see buying this one again."
"drinkability: very sessionable beer!!! they go down great with a bratwurst smothered in dark mustard and onion!! cheers!!"
"Thanks for the bottle jasonm!"
"D- drinkable lager with good character. Its a must-try in the Pittsburgh area"
"From the label ""If you were going to spend eternity drinking beer, this would be the one"" - sets a pretty high bar. IMO, not bad, but misses the eternity mark. Fairly true to style, but could use a heavier body. My personal opinion is not enough hops, but I say that about almost every beer now...."
"An easy drinking dark lager, one of my favorite styles. Will be drinking these for years!!"
"I don't know when this happened, but Penn products can now be found in Maryland! I stopped in at Corridor in Laurel and was shocked to see it lining the shelves. No more long treks to PA for beer. (Well, not for Penn anyway.) To the uninitiated, you're in for a treat. They're all great, but Penn Dark is by far my favorite ""regular"" (year long) offering from Penn. Nice dark color, small frothy head, a bit of malt and a nice toasted scent in the nose, and a decent (not too thin, not too thick) mouthfeel. Taste is mildly balanced malt and toasted malt with a hint of hops--just enough to provide a nice bitterness in the aftertaste. Add just the right carbonation and you have the formula for an amazing Munich Dunkel-style beer. Extremely drinkable and refreshing. Thanks, Penn!"
"Penn Brewing always seems to do lager well. This beer reminds me of dark lagers I drank in Bavaria."
"Drinkability  Very drinkable, but not incredibly complex."
"Pours a clean/clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, small fizzy tannish head which quickly dissappears, some sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is of sweet slightly roasted malts, slight hops, toffee/caramel. The taste is malty, slightly bitter, nice touch of toffee/caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a very tasty dunkel lager, glad to have a chance to try it out."
"I thought the mouthfeel was a little on the lean side, but I suppose that is typical of the style. Very nice brew!"
"I like this one too. Some quality lacing, especially when not too cold, pours a good head and an almost opaque, black color. Heavy munich malts dominate the initial taste with a twinge of raw hoppiness on the way down. Nicely balanced brew. Smell, probably the best scented beer Penn makes. Also, a great session beer and priced fairly. Tough to find a German version as good as this one."
"I got this one on tap at the brewery...Poured into a pink glass pour dark brown color. This beer has a nice sweet malty aroma. This beer has a sweet taste seemed like it was missing something though. Mouthfeel was a little thin, overall drinkability is good, this is a beer you can drink a few of not to offensive to the tastebuds in any manner good or bad. Quality beer on tap at the brewery"
"D- This beer has very soft flavors and some dark malt notes but not much depth to them."
"12oz. bottle poured a dark but transparent brown with a tan head and some nice lacing. Smell has some sweet fruity malts. Taste of semi sweet malts with a slight hop bite. Mouth feel is light/medium with a touch of carbonation on the tongue. This is a very drinkable beer and easy to keep on drinking."
"Thanks MuenchenerKindl! I'm sad I only had one of these, since they are clearly designed to be drank in session."
"Which gives it a shockingly drinkable quality. Almost like having a cup of coffee, only it's beer. This is good stuff."
"The drinkability is good. I will be looking to get more and send some to friends. Prosit, und Zum Wohl, MK"
"Beer pours a dark brown with amber undertones with a nice white head is sustaining pretty well. Nose is of sweet malts. Taste is a nice medley of roasted malts, chocolate malts, and a bit of light hopping. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and is nice and smooth. Drinkability is very good. This is a very good dark lager that I recommend because of its good smooth taste and drinkability. I will seek this out if I am in the Pittsburgh area in the future!"
"D: Very drinkable, an excellent dunkel lager from Penn."
"DNot bad, Ill enjoy the other 2 I received, but probably wont seek it out again."
"Tastes of mild diacetyl with creamy buttery notes, some breadiness, mild chocolate, and faint smokiness. A very delicious and quaffable brew."
"Overall a very drinkable dark lager. From the nose, I was expecting a sticky sweet mess, but instead was pleasantly suprised by the toasted dryness."
"Pours a dark brown with light tan head leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass. Sweet toasty malts, caramel and fresh baked bread make up the nose. Taste is much like the aroma with a lingering toasted malt and hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth. Overall, Penn Dark is a pretty solid offering that is good enough to have again."
"Pours an extremely dark amber/red. Nice light tan head recedes and leaves a bit of lacing on the surface. Aroma is sweet caramel malt and a bit of herbal hops. Taste is sweet and roasted malt and a bit of herbal hops add a nice balance to the finish. Nice and balanced. Mouthfeel is medium to full and this is pretty drinkable. Pretty good overall."
"Poured out a nice deep dark brown, with only very mild head, which had poor retention and poor lacing. Smell was decent, a good roasted malt aroma, with some chocolate tones. Taste good as well, again roasted malt, and at times an almost mocha like taste, a nice burnt finish. Mouthfeel was fairly light, with mild carbonation. All in all, it was OK."
"Poured a dark brown color with subtle dark copper/rust hues at the bottom of my goblet. Heavy carbonation with a thick, frothy head. Heavy lacing, entire rings were left behind. Aromas of alcohol, spoiled fruit, cream, and yeast; together these scents were rather unpleasant. The taste was as might be expected with fruit juice flavors mixing with sweet malt and yeast flavors. Somewhat astringent flavor in association with the yeast and fruit flavors. Semi-sweet with a creamy texture, but not complex or refreshing. Slightly tart and bitter finish."
"Overall, it's not the best Penn has to offer, but still a very good brew. Worth picking up a six. Or better yet, make a stop while visiting the 'Burgh."
"Thanks to Dan for bringing this case up. Pours a clear dark amber/brown, medium tan head forms, nice lacing, decent retention. Smell is sweet, some roast, little floral, grains. Taste is dry and roasty, chocolate through the middle, caramel finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with lower carbonation, very smooth and satisfying. Great session lager, I feel like I could drink this all night."
"Overall: Not something I would usually go, but this one panned out to be a decent offering, my initial thoughts on the Penn offerings from the Pennsylvania Brewing Company have changed considerably. An enjoyable libation, and a damn good Dark Lager."
"Clear dark brown with a touch of amber. Head is medium-sized, frothy and light tan, and slowly diminishes to a creamy looking thick film. Some sparse lacing. The smell is of mild-moderate sweet toasty malt. Toffee, molasses, caramel, very light fruit. Taste follows suit by being sweet up front with dominant malts all the way through to the finish. A touch sour but not bad, and a light floral presence at the end as well. It has a medium body, creamy texture and soft carbonation. Not a bad beer at all. Nothing fabulous but one of the better Munich Dunkels Ive had, so I have to give it higher marks for that reason."
"Amber rather than dark colour. Its plain but its drinkable. Some toastiness, some hop, rather taste is led by malt profile including chocolate malt. Molasses.Appreciated than no sourness. Medium mouthfeel. Part of the German style lineup and nothing special."
"I brought a bottle home also, I'll re-review if I disagree with the on-tap review."
"Cheers!"
"I enjoyed this beer fresh from a glass at the Penn Brewery. It had a nice head and was very dark, yet not completely opaque (as witnessed when I held it against the light and it gave off a warm black/orange glow where the light passed around the edges). It had a beautiful roasted aroma that smelled of chocolate malt and hops. The taste was full of body and plenty of complex flavors, yet at the same time wasn't too overpowering with the bitterness of the ""heaviness"" of the drink. Because of this, I felt that it was a bit more drinkable and could easilly be followed with a second round. The mouthfeel was medium/thick with a medium/low amount of carbonation. I believe this is an excellent dunkel lager for those who enjoyed some body to their beer and I would highly recommend it, especially if you can enjoy it right at the brewery."
"tried this bottled beverage not expecting much...i was pleasantly surprised. a nice colored drink with a medium head. the smell is outstanding, a roasted dark chocolate smell that is very appealing. the taste was amazing like drinking roasted almonds dipped in dark chocolate. a nice feeling on the tongue and lips. similar to Bass but with much more flavor. I was definately be drinking this treat again."
"Really a neglected beer in a neglected style. They got it right here."
"This beer from Penn has a nice brownish-red color and left a nice head. Smelled almost like a dark-roast coffee bean with little hops present. Even though it poured a little think, it was surprisingly smooth and creamy going down...I enjoyed the coffee-like aftertaste. The only thing I would have to say about this brew (and others from Penn) is that I never know what to expect when I take the first sip...it seems like their overall consistency is lacking lately - sometimes I'll have 24 perfect bottles in a case, others 12 might be headed down the skunk path. This beer in it's prime is excellent, though."
"Easily drinkable. It'd be a beer I could buy a case of and share with the poker buddies on a Saturday night. Nice offering from Penn Brewing."
"The price was fair and this is a decent offering, it just misses by my standards. A bit thin and some odd twists and turns in the middle are a rough mix."
"Pours a deep rubied brown color with a finger of head that falls quickly to a sparse coating over top. Nose is a nice chocolate and raisin mixture over a toasty bready base. Smells very nice. Flavor is a bit different. First flavor is a nice sweet smokeyness laying over the toasted raisin bread. Very clean and nice and flavorfull. Feel is on the light end of moderate with a moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty damn nice brew. I really enjoy the flavors and aroma. I like how the smokeyness is not so big in the nose but really hits in the flavor. I would keep this in my fridge."
"Brewed 10 minutes away and for 24 a case, along with their other beers, I feel very content with purchasing more."
"Poured a deep rich earthy mohogany with a light tan head, which left a delicate lace by the way. The aroma was of sweet malts and roasted toffee. The taste was a good dose of the german minerally taste that i just cant describe. It was clean, faintly bready with caramel notes. Quite crisp and tasty. The body was lighter than i thought it would be, but in a good way. Good carbonation and a great first step into Penn's brews. I'm just getting into the german styles so i will revisit this after i have a bit more experience in the style."
"Cheers"
"On-Tap @ the Brazen Head in the Bklyn Zoo. Dark brown with almost black/ruby highlights. Head is off-white and small, but lacing is decent. Aromas are all wheaty, yeasty, and clove-ridden with some banana fruit in the bready mixture as well. Taste is very weizen like with some more roasty dunkel malts in the mix as well, this is what a real dunkel lager/weisse should ride like. Mouthfeel is creamy, medium bodied, and faboo. Drinkability is killer. Kick-ass stuff, fo shizzle."
"Pours a dark amber red almost black. Thin tan head that is gone before you know it. Smell of caramel. Taste is initially sweet molasses but there is enough hops on the tail end to cover it up. Medium body with a lot of carbonation on the tongue. Smooth beer that goes down easily. A nice offering from Penn. They make a solid line of beers. Nothing too fantastic but all solid beers."
"O: A great authentic German offering by one of the best authentic German breweries in America!"
"Comments  Thanks to my best BA bud skyhand from bringing this back to Seattle all the way from PA."
"poured a deep copper color with slightly off-white head that fell to a light coating. Smell is mostly caramel with a bit of a toasty note. Taste is caramel and roasted grains and is extremely delightful in the mouth. Easy drinking. Wish I had bought more."
"Drinkability: A wonderful German style beer from an excellent Pittsburgh brewery. This would make an excellent session beer!"
"D&N: Another quality offering from a local brewer. Goes down quite easily, more full bodied than I was expecting. Way to go, guys."
"Drinkability  Very drinkable, but not too interesting. Pretty good for the style, very fresh, just nothing fantastic."
"12 ouncer sampled, some sort of feshness dating, but just having the first letters of the months along one side of the label doesnt do much for me.( bottled on? best before?, what year are we talking about???, c'mon brewers out there we can give better info w/o that much trouble) Alright my ranting is done, this one pours dark honey amber, a tad murky, with an off white/tan head and it leaves nice fine and well scattered lacing. Nose is toffee and brown sugar. this is a tasty sweet malty brew. Notes of vanilla, toffee, some nuttyness and sweet malts. Clean finish, free of esters and phenolics, minimal hop notes detected. I'm not really a huge lager drinker, but this clearly is a quality product and a worthwhile sessioner"
"I have to admit I am such an ale/hop fiend that I had to adjust to this all lager brewey."
"Taste is smooth, with plenty of roasted malt flavors. Definite chocolate tastes, and a bit of caramel flavor. Just the right amount of hops. All around, an excellent beer from Penn Brewery."
"Penn delivers a very well-made and exceptionally drinkable lager in their Dark. It's clear, deep chestnut body glows with ruby highlights at it's center; and its creamy light tan head holds rather well before dropping to a standard collar and leaves short splashes of lace about the glass. Dark, caramelized sugars and Munich malts dominate the nose; toasty and bordering on becoming subtly roasty with a thin cusp of chocolate in the background. Occassional floral hops sometimes make their way through the malt, lending to quite an enticing aroma. It's somewhat creamy and fairly smooth across the palate with a fine-bubbled, moderate carbonation that lends a light zest to the tongue before it warms. Dark Munich malts appear upfront in the flavor, mildly toasty, lightly sweet, and even somewhat raisiny. As it warms more toasted character becomes apparent; and it finishes with a flash of floral and grassy hops as it's drying bitterness rises. It's very well-brewed, clean, nicely balanced, and highly drinkable! An impressive dunkel that probably deserves more attention than it gets."
"From the bottle. Pours a amber brown, with a tan head that left little lacing. The initial aroma was fruity, and then nutty, but as it warms I pick up malt and honey. It has a nice malty flavor that finishes dry and bitter, but not overly intense. The body is good but it seems to slip off the sides of the tongue a little. Overall this is a really nice dunkel."
"Pours a deep ruby brown with a nice fluffy 2 finger head that lingers for a while with some nice lacing. Smells of caramel, rye, and spices. A very nice, complex taste with mellow hops balancing out very strong malt flavor. Finishes with roasted almonds and spices, with almost a tart flavor. A nice heavy carbonated feel in the mouth with a good malt feel. Once again the Pennsylvania Breweing Company has created a great beer in a luckluster area. Cheers!!"
"I am never one to underestimate a Dunkel, but I must say I was surprised. At first it poured a bit flat, a slight tan head. Color was nice for a Dunkel, but I thought it was going to be undercarbonated. I was wrong, great color and smell, with taste to match. It has thay nice German fresh aroma- malty, but tempered. A rich and fairly sweet lagar, I found this so enjoyable that I wanted more. This brew has a wonderful balance when you want something with texture and flavor, but not heavy. This beer is great with food- not overwhelming at all."
"Drinkability - A fine effort; flavorful enough to keep you interested and light enough to consume in quantity"
"I love this beer. Color is a wonderful dark ruby when held to the light. Almost opaque with no light behind the glass. Nice creamy head. Smell and taste are wonderfully rich. Toasty, malty, rich, chocolate. Just enough hops flavor to give it a crisp, clean flavor. Nicely balances the rich creaminess and slight sweetness of the beer. Unbelieveably tasty and smooth. This is not a sip and discuss the subtle flavors for hours beer. This is a holy s*** is this good give me another one beer."
"Pours a deep ruby brown, like cola, with a light tan head. Smells of roasted Munich malts and weak chocolate with some low-alpha (Hersbrucker?) hops in there, too. Tastes earthy and a touch sweet, but pretty well balanced. A little bit of hops show up mid-palate, which keeps it all in check. Pretty good, but I've had some better dunkels."
"Thanks for the Penn samples marc77."
"Crystal clear deep ruddy chestnut. Persistent, pitted, thickset leight tan head yields frothy lace. Mellow milk chocolate and dark toffee contrasted by a mildly savory, lightly salted grainy pumpernickel impression in aroma. Trace herbal hop nose. Agreeably understated aromawise. The flavor profile of this brew exhibits fine balance. Malt character is of judicious dark caramel with a singed kiss from chocolate and black malts. Skewed slightly towards sweetness overall, although hop bitterness lends a near dryness mid palate that helps facilitate exceptional drinkability. Toasty Munich hints complement chocolate character aptly. Dryish, but unfortunately marred by a thin mouthfeel. Still, that doesn't detract the entire package too much. Finishes with a snap of black malt acidity yielding to a pleasantly lingering bittersweet cocoa wash. A well crafted dunkel with stately chocolate and toast impressions. Soft on the palate and immaculately clean."
"Served on tap, this beer is a dark brown with a frothy head. The aroma is very restrained, but theres a little malt, graininess, and yeast in the smell (I had to hunt for it, though). The taste is a little nutty and grainy, with caramel. The finish is dry, clean, and a little hoppy, and the body is medium (maybe on the lighter side of medium). Not really complex, but nothing really wrong either. Its a solid and enjoyable, if not particularly interesting beer."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep ruby red, almost black, with two fingers of head. There is some lacing left on the glass. The smell is sweet and malty with caramel and toffee. A hint of hops in the smell as well. A nice full aroma that fills the nose well. The taste starts with lots of roasted malt up front, some sweetness. A good hop bite on the finish. Balanced out fairly well. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and smooth. The drinkability is really nice due to the smoothness and the 4% abv. A great dark lager."
"Pours out as a real handsome pint, with two fingers of rocky, sticky head just leveling off at the top of the glass. Head subsides with some nice-looking clumps and pretty good cling. A few streamers of carbonation shoot through this brew's nice, glowing chestnut translucence that shows maple-colored highlights. Aroma is clean but not particularly distinctive; buttered wheat bread with a sweet caramel maltiness that is slightly hullish; very light nosefeel. Flavor comes in the form of more caramel sweet malt up front; a full barley backbone complemented by butterscotch in the body; the finish posesses the buttery Hallertau hops that seem to be characteristic of this brewery. Nicely carbonated, light mouthfeel can get a bit syrupy, IMO; sticky, refreshing finish. Drinkability is about as high as it gets, a result of the balance of flavor to body to alcohol. If I can find this on tap I'll be drinking it by the pitcher."
"I've drank a lot of Penn Darks (mostly on tap) over the years, but haven't done a review since I've joined B.A, so thanks to P. D. for the bottle. Clear dark amber appearance, head is light brown and frothy, like steamed milk on a latte. Laces are mostly rings with some interconnecting tendrils. Malty aroma, biscuity with some sense of light honey. Texture is fun, if lighter, some medium-toasted graininess plays in concert with a solid if non-complex caramel flavor. The finish is best, dries slightly with well-done hop balance. Just a solid Dark Lager, brings back the memories."
"Poured a dark amber color and was almost brown and was topped off with a thinning white head. Slight hint of roasted grains in the aroma, but overall not much there. Theres a buttery texture in the flavor. Buttery and bitter with a dry bite. Not bad for a dark lager."
"Dark brown color. Medium head. Aroma is dark roasted malt, chocolate, slightly sweet. A medium bodied dunkel. Malts are roasted, slightly sweet and fruity. Raisins, plums and cherries being the dominant flavors. Hops are slightly bitter and a touch citrusy. Nicely balanced, A very drinkable, tasty beer. Would be a great session beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean, smooth and a touch dry. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"This beer poured into the glass a medium/dark brown that when held to the light had a reddish hue to it, and was very clear. The head that it produced was a light tan/beige head that was fairly dense and decent staying power and left some lace behind. The aromas that came from the glass were of sweet caramel, malt, hops, and some spices (cinnamon). The flavors were of dark malts, sweet caramel, hops, roasted nuts and some spices, some aftertaste of caramel and nuts were left behind. This was a crisp and clean beer, decent body and flavors that seemed to match and combine well. A good drinkable beer."
"The smoky malt dominates the palate, but still allow for some crispness expected from a lager. Hops are subtle and the aftertaste is of smoke with some sweetness."
"Poured a nice deep brown color with some ruby hues,nice rocky head that sticks around.Smell was faintly malty and fruity.Taste was of of chocolate malts and a little caramelly with some lingering dryness.Much better than alot of the German styles I have had,very appetizing and sustaining."
"Taste is full, slightly sweet at first with a nice dark malt and caramel flavor. Again the dark bread flavor comes to the forefront followed by some gentle bitterness and a bit of spice. Overall an extremely well balanced and dangerously drinkable lager. I enjoyed this beer a lot. I can envision big tankards of this being enjoyed en-mass at some festival with buxom waitresses and sausages and a big stupid grin on everyone's face. Nicely done."
"I must say that in the past, I have boughten a whole case of this stuff and believe me that case was worth it. Each one of those beers were fully enjoyed by all, so now it's time to return to this old favorite and break it down. Appears a very dark nearly opaque with hints of ruby piercing through around the edges when held up to the light. Paired with a tan moccha head, which is binding to the rim of the forming even annular rings of lace as the glass empties. The aroma has some semi-faint fruit tones wrapped in a mild milk chocolate bringing creamy malt to the forefront. Also some of the darker roasted malts are also doing their part allowing a toasted nut scent to dance in the air. The taste leaves me with that creamy milk chocolate sweetness around my lips, along with the trickled chocolate and mild coffee tones comes a crisp smooth lager-like characteristic making this one amazingly smooth. The mouthfeel is full of those creamy sensations down the palate of this fairly heavy bodied beer. Drinkability I would love to find this on tap just to see if it gets any frothier than it already is, and I would like to experiment with mixing this with some Lindemann's Framboise."
"Big thanks to AKSmokedPorter for the 2 Penn samples he shared with me."
"Drinkability: An excellent lager. I'm not usually one for this style of beer, but Penn's Dark has carved a niche in my heart. With just a slight aftertaste, this one is very easy to keep drinking. A pleasant surprise from the folks at Penn."
"This beer poured a deep, dark brown with a nice ample just off white head that stayed atop the beer for a long while. That is where the good story ends. I might have gotten a bad bottle, but the aroma is very mild and barely any malt. The taste is bland and in no way could I call this complex. There are no chocolate flavors. The mouthfeel is almost American Lager light. I will be trying the other two bottles I have of this beer sometime and may reevaluate this beer. BUT this bottle REALLY SUCKS."
"Pours a deep dark brown with a heavy thick foamy head. The smooth aroma of bread and chocolate is very inviting and quite malty to boot. Initial earthy bread malt and sharp bitterness that quickly trails off into a dry finish. Very drinkable but not extremely flavorful."
"Pours with a thinnish head and hardly any lace. Dark root beer color. Malts are up front and hops are hardly noticable but there is a very slightly hoppy finish. This lager is a smooth, medium bodied beer. Very drinkable and nice to get a good dunkel brewed in the US."
"(Freshness dated February)  Appearance: Pours a rich chestnut color with amber hues; the head is creamy and tan in color, holds decent then fades to a nice thin layer of creamy foam. On the nose the aroma of roasted malts, dark toasted bread, and hints of caramel and orange peels. On the palate the flavors consisted of dark toasted bread, graininess, mellow hop bitterness, sweet caramel, breadythe mouthfeel is fairly smooth. What a great brew!"
"BTW, the bottle is almost gone in the time it took to write this short review. Wow, what a beer!"
"Poured a very dark brown color, with a hint of red. It had a relatively small head, but it stuck around for a while. The smell was full of malt, with some hint of hops. Very slight, possible nut aroma mixed in somewhere, too. The lager had a very, very nice, rich taste. Lots of malt with good addition of hops, and almost strange roasted-like qualities. Good mouthfeel, with a somewhat stickly, medium to full body. Almost as filling as a stout, only with a lighter body. Penn Dark is a very enjoyable lager...the wonderful taste goes well with a nice warm feel in your gullet. Great session beer, too. Highly recommended."
"Dangerously drinkable. Deep dark brown with a darker hue. Nice off white head and moderate lace. Slight hoppy bitter foretaste but mostly a rich roasted matly flavor. Taste is almost shot from the hip as aroma is not very fragerant. Notes of semi-sweet notes similiar to the chicory flavors of Dogfish Head's Chicory Stout come out as brew warms slightly. Body is slightly chewy and well balanced on the tongue--moderate carbonation attributes to that."
"At first, this brew reminded me very much of Yuengling's Lager, but as I tasted it it differentiated itself quite nicely. Nice malt flavors up front with a smooth buttery finish (without the bite the Yuengling has). A great drinking brew that I will have to try to find locally."
"Dark brown and rich in color. Smell is of fresh bread with a hint of carmelness.  Taste is dark and coples with a good bit of sweet malt flavor.  Nicely carbonated."
"Notes: Straight up, a great dark lager ... spot on for style."
