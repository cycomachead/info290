"Pretty good dunkle that if get again"

"The body is medium, crisp from beginning to end and smooth as well with a rolling carbonation.  A sort of spiciness or peppery bite translates to the feel at the end of every sip."

"Pours into a becker a deep walnut brown with a thinner light beige head atop that leaves a few spots of lace as it settles.Syrupy in the nose with light nut shell,the sweetness is the main thing here.To be expected it's quite malty and maybe a little sweet for the style with caramel and brown sugar flavors really standing out,just a light drying breadiness in the finish.Not a great example of the style but I love going to the brewery/restaurant on the Cass river close to where I grew up."

"O - Overall, it was alright. A bit lacking in my opinion."

"Taste: It's pleasant, but I wasn't expecting it to be so much like a lager. Being a lager, it's extremely drinkable, but it' has a somewhat watery consistency, and it's lacking big, bold flavor. It's a tasty beer, and a dunkel that could actually be very refreshing on a hot summer day, if you're craving a dark beer that isn't too heavy. In that instance, this would be an excellent beer. For its style, it's actually very quite good. As a whole though, it's nothing too special. It is probably the most drinkable dark lager beer that I've ever had though, so that counts for something."
"O - Smelled like a solid dunkel with its malt emphasis without exceeding extreme dark grains but had a little twang underneath it all. The taste had an even bigger apple-like quality and also a more boring malt take. Good feel and good appearance."
""
"O: A good beer, just not what I was expecting. I was hoping for a bit more malt character to shine through. More bitterness and less body than I would have liked. Not a bad beer, just not a great one."
"As the first of the variety pack I've had, I am liking this, it's something I would definitely drink again."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 2/5/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, biscuit, brown bread, light roast, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of dark/bready malt and moderate hop/yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, brown bread, light roast, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of dark/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice dunkel lager style. Well balanced dark/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors with good robustness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
"Had this on tap at the Frankenmuth Brewery. Wasn't able to watch them pour it, but it arrived with a small, one finger head. Dark brown/mahogany and somewhat cloudy in appearance. Had a malty, cooked grain aroma. Somewhat sweet tasting with a rich maltiness and light on hops. Smooth and full bodied but not heavy. Refreshing Dunkel."

"Overall very drinkable beer. As they say liquid bread. It very much fits the bill."
""
"O- Very nice dunkel. I love the complexity of this offering. Everything balances out nicely. Will get again!"
""

"Appearance is a transparent brown with an orange hue. There is a thin layer of head, but that s all. The nose is distinctly bready. Malt and rye bread are the flavor focus and this offering finishes nicely bitter. All-in-all, a nice dunkel, but a bit thin for my taste."
""
""
""
"O: Nice combination of flavors that work well, especially with the lack of sweetness with the fruit. They balance well with the toasted malt flavors and spicyness at the end. Would def try this again."
""

"Pours a clear brown color with a hint of a reddish hue. Single-finger off-white head with good retention and a bit of visible carbonation. The nose has some faint caramel malt with a slight toffee presence. The flavor is similar with some added sweetness and a short burst of earthy hops toward the finish. Body is medium and a bit syrupy, at least for the style. Pretty good, but a bit too sweet."
""
""
"O: A nice pleasant light dunkel."
""
""
"M. Body *is* somewhat thin for the style but I am not finding the carbonation levels to be as over-the-top as everybody else seems to be experiencing."
"This poured out as a nice brown color, not overly deep in color, still able to see through it. The head was a light brown color. The smell of the beer was lightly roasted with some nice wheat and clove notes. The taste of the beer brings the roasted malts up and finishes with a lightly spiced finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and still pretty light for the style. Overall it's not too bad."
""
""
"If I can find more Dunkels like this, I will definitely move this style into my top 5."
""
"Overall, this is a nice beer in a style with which I have no familiarity. It seems very refined and would be easy to drink many of these."
"Lighter bodied. Quite over carbonated as well. Chalking this one up to a bad bottle."

"The second-oldest brewery in the US is brewing again. Dark chestnut-hued brew, bordering on black. Lacing dresses the glass very well. Fresh-toasted dark bread flaunts the malt aroma; very clean. Strong malt presence here—even with it teetering on the dry side, there are a lot of complex layers that peel away, sip after sip. Heavy toasted taste eventually calms down with an even malt flavor. Mild hopping is just enough to keep the malt in check. Very good drinking—spot-on for style, and on par with its authentic German counterparts."

"Pours out a dark mahogany with a 2 finger foamy tan head that leaves good retention, and some nice lacing on the glass. The aroma was hard to pick up, but did get a little bread and some sweet malts. The taste starts out with some hops followed by some chocolate malts, raisins, and coffee with a roasted and smoked flavor throughout. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy and overall a very good tasting beer. First time I have tried this style and hope others I try will be as good as this one."
"o - not a bad beer, but seems to be missing a few key style elements. mainly the depth of flavor, body and smoothness. i hope the other frankenmuth beers have more to offer than this."
"Taste is equally tart as the aroma. Ripe green apple yeast mixed with toasted and very litle roasted malt. Apple start, faint biscuit middle with just a touch of roasted bread crust. The tartness is the dominating flavor and feel throughout the whole beer. Not bad, but not a dunkel I will buy again."
"Cheers!"
"O- This begs to be paired with a plate full of suasage on this summer-like day. Definitely an easy drinker. I would buy it again."
"Mouthfeel was nice and light and you could easily drink quite a few if you really enjoyed the flavor."
"For me, this is actually a very nice session beer and my bias would rate this a little higher personally than I would for a review, because this is one of my favorite styles. That said, while very good, it's not a perfect effort and probably not as good as the original Atwater Dunkel, back when they were importing grains in 1997-98 under their original brewmaster."
"D- Not particularly interesting, but drinks fine enough."
"Overall i thought this was a very good dunkle and i hope the pub keeps it on tap so i can keep enjoying it, also cool of the bartender for letting us sample it before we ordered a pitcher. Even though i live close to the frankenmuth brewery i have very little experience with their beer but this dunkel may have sparked some interest for this brewery."
"Drinkability: As the pint wore on, it seemed to get worse and worse. Having one is okay, but I don't think I would get it again."
"Inviting hue of deep amber/garnet, topped by a pale khaki head. Nice patchy lacing was noticed clinging to the sides of the glass as the head diminished. Malty nose with some roasted coffee notes - interesting. Adding to the complexity of the nose was a hint of toffee and caramel, which became more prenounced as the beer warmed. Smooth, clean flavor imparts a little nuttiness off the bat. Flavor moves into a surprising roasted flavor, indicative of chocolate malt. Welcome, yet unexpected. Here enters the coffee and toffee noted in the nose, with slight bitter chocolate. Very enjoyable turn for this easy drinking lager. Mouthfeel is typical of the style, crisp and refreshing, despite the roasty flavors floating around. The interaction of the bottom fermenting yeast and roasted malts make this a good brew with more complexity than you would expect."
"Part of a sampler at the brewery. This is another beer I remember from before the big storm. Clear reddish brown with a thin off white head. Very little aroma at all, mild malt and faint yeast. The flavor is a little lackluster, slightly malty, not really roasted, and then a yeasty aftertaste. The body is okay. This was a bit of a disappointment, but it still is a nice beer to drink."
