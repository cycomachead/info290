"Jubliate Dark Lager pours a beautiful ruby brown with a tan head. Nutty malt and a slight hint of dark dried fruit provide the nose . On the palate clean nutty malt tastes combine with kettle sugars and light roast flavors from the dark malts. There are just enough hops to keep it interesting."
"O: excellent for style and good with food."

"O - Was a drain pourer. Didn't improve as temperature rose. Overall, simply didn't like the sourness. Tasted as much like wine to me as beer. Not sure if this is normal for an organic beer. Either way, will not purchase again."

"Pours murky brown amber. Very little of a white head. This beer reminds me of a doppelbock mixed with an oktoberfest. The beer has massive caramel qualities and flavors that dominate the tongue. The beer has a nice dark fruit presence as well. There is a dark grain presence in this beer that is again, all toffee and caramel. The feel of this beer is velvety smooth and quite creamy. There is a slight tart fruit flavor in this beer as well. Overall, its a nice old fashioned German brew."

"Overall a pleasant easy to drink beer that I could see drinking almost anytime."
"Poured into a tall wine glass. Color was a medium dark amber, with a thin dirty white head. Head lasted only a few minutes before leaving some lacings that clung to the sides. Reasonable amount of carbonation rose from the bottom in no particular pattern. Aroma was very slightly sweet, that shifted to a subtle malty grain. Flavor reminded me a slightly spicy/peppery wheat bread. Felt a tad thin and bubbly in the mouth. Overall not a bad beer. Well priced for an imported organic."
""
"O- A good beer, definitely worth trying, but lacks some of the toasty, bread-like quality I was hoping for. I don't think I'll get this beer again, even if it is organic, but I would like to try some other beers from this brewery."
"affordable big bottle at old chicago on colorado boulevard. pours a very watered down looking light to medium brown color with a tan head comprised of huge bubbles, but they burst and retreat immediately. the glass may have been a little soapy still, so somebody comfirm this appearance. smells like chocolate malts and a bit of doughnuty sweet malt. flavor is the best asset, as it should be, with plenty of roasty and milk chocolately malt heft. no hops in here to speak of, and a quickly fading aftertaste. feel is on the weak side, light to medium body and fair carbonation. more body would do wonders for this beer. overall i liked this, unique flavor profile for a german beer, and its organic, so plus for that, but a bit more depth of feel could bring it up in my book."
"And if they were trying to replicate an old-school beer then this flavor makes a lot more sense."
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. Overall it isn't bad but the tangy character of the alcohol I could live without. It seems a bit off for the style. Take that away and you have a fairly decent dunkel here."

"I like the mouthfeel and aroma as I've continued to drink I think the sourness and raisin tones would become an issue in how drinkable. Good, but not my favorite."

"Overall – not a bad tasting brew at all, but also not very intriguing or interesting."
"O - A great Dunkel, this one is sweet and hearty."
"O - the term 'organic' is a legally defined term that means nothing like what it implies, but this is a very enjoyable brew, I've had dunkels at bier halls in Munich, and I've had many a lager, this is something different yet very familiar, well worth a try or 2"
"Overall: It's generally fairly basic, but with an emphasis on malt flavor and a bit of sweetness, yet it's never cloying. It's maltiness is kind of like that of a bock, but less full, and not as 'dark'... think of it as a standard Munich dunkel but amped up a bit. It's really quite nice. It's remarkably drinkable, and it seems to go quite well with food. After tasting the initial bottle I had another one with a fresh, light pasta sauce made ingredients from my garden (tomato, onion, garlic, some green pepper, and basil/thyme/oregano) and olive oil, salt/pepper, and Pecorino Romano cheese and it was a splendid match - I have no doubt that it would be brilliant with pizza. Well worth trying!"
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is a bit on the malty side. Taste is of malts, caramel, slightly sweet, a faint hint of hops, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"A good example of the style, more maltyness would seal the deal. Very easy to drink"
"A nice dark lager, but after a while it starts to taste a bit watery."
"Overall: A simple, pleasing dark lager which takes the taste buds to rural Germany, in that it tastes very authentic and true to brewing traditions of the region."
" give it a shot, you might like it...or hate it!?"
"Overall very drinkable. A satisfying brew for sure."
"Opinion: Like the Altbier, this beer is all over the place. It still has the elements of a German beer, so it isn't completely off the mark...at least it is in the right country, but the beer is pretty far off for the style. This one isn't as far off as the Alt, but it, like it's brother, has too much of some qualities and not enough of others to make it stand up to the classics in the styles. Again, this beer is better overall than the Alt IMO, and comes closer to the style, but it just isn't the best representation I have found."
"O-This beer was not anything overly impressive, just a nice well balanced beer."
"Appears dark amber caramel tinted body with a light khaki head forming thick and billowing with fine bubbles. Fine lacing coats the sides of the glass. Nice touch of dark fruit roasted malts nothing too overbearing still very German in nature. Apples/raisins with hints of malted barley and grassy hops. Flavor has juicy caramel malts/hints of raisin and apple juiciness. Overall nice flavor going on I can't really get enough of the Pinkus offerings, their simple but yet really flavorful. Burp noble hops as you sip, enjoy the light crisp body with natural carbonation levels. Drinkability is awesome one of the best dark lagers I've come across recently."
" D - I would drink this beer if someone offered it to me but probably wouldn't seek it out."
"Pours a clean orange-ish to deep amber in color with an off white head. In the aroma, sweet caramel and light roasted malts. In the taste, starts caramel like and ends with a fruitiness of white grapes, but make no mistake, it is a lager all the way through. A somewhat of a lager bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry fruitiness and lager notes in the aftertaste. A clean lager and nice fruit notes."
"D - Well I don't think I ever had a Dunkel Lager but having them together seems to cancel each other out. No bitterness from the lager, yet no underline banana from the dunkel so it was balanced but the flavors were just bland. Still a great German beer!"
"Drinks pretty well despite the strange flavor. An okay Vienna lager."
"D: This is a very easy beer to drink; it has a low alcohol content and goes down very smoothly."
"This beer has a darkish amber colour and nice 1 cm head. The smell is of citrus, hops and some breadiness. The wheatiness is immediately apparent along with some malt. The aftertaste is sour and yeasty. This beer feels great in the mouth, but I don't love the flavour."
"A malt-heavy concoction, but still pleasingly dry, and complex enough in its follow-through."
"On the palate it's a bit more rough; there's a note of grainy, husky astringency up front, leading into flavors of mineral, tart red grapes, toast and herbal hops. The body is a touch thin, and there's a slight metallic astringency that puts me off a bit. It's not an offensive beer by any means, it's quite drinkable and enjoyable, but it's not upper-tier for the style."
"This is quite the nice brew; I am really digging the rich malt character in the nose and even the flavor has something similar. This has definitely been a nice surprise."
"D: An okay drinker."
"Sometimes complexity is not needed to make or break a beer. There are subtle complexities here, but its cleanliness and drinkability, along with the old-world lager flavor, makes this beer what it is. Lovely stuff it is--put it on your must try list."
"This beer pours a dark copper with a thin eggshell head that provides sticky lacing. There is a slight haze as well. Carbonation is fine, and produces tiny bubbles. Aromas are almost non-existant. Faint hints of biscuit and caramel are all I get. Taste is more. Caramel and toast, and some cereal grains, along with some fruity traits. Hops give the beer a dry clean finish. Medium bodied, yet this brew is not filling. A good brew, and a very easy drinking brew, I might add."
"Pours a cola colored brown with light brown head. Slight haze is noted. Nose has some light bready aromas, with perhaps some very gentle holiday spices. Palate offers a core flavor of toasted malts, faint cocoa, and is rather light bodied and easy drinking."
"Dark, russet brown with a thin eggshell head that quickly shrinks to a skim and leaves spotty lace on the glass. Cocoa, caramel and toasty grain comprise the mild aroma. Toasty malt and cocoa with a mild floral hop bitterness in the finish. The flavor of the beer is pleasant enough, but it's a little underwhelming. Light bodied and slightly creamy with palate scrubbing carbonation. A little more body and depth of flavor would really help me like this beer more. Jubilate is a good beer but nothing special."
"I had not even heard of this Certified Organic beer until I was turned onto it at Bridgewaters Pub. It poured with a finger of fluffy, light-tan head with mild retention. Color was a brownish-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a cereal-like, grainy, biscuity quality. Mouthfeel was medium with a chocolate/honey/toasty taste on the tongue. Finish had the distinct lager sweetness. A very clean tasting beer!"
"Nice-sized bottle; the amount was just right to enjoy before dinner. I'd have it again."
"A little thin, and light on carb. Drinkability was surprisingly high. I guess I kept drinking fast looking for more. I'd try it again, but wouldn't look for it."
"Beer is medium in body and slightly....tart? I'm going to taste again, I think the carbonation is giving me a slight sour note to the whole thing but not like a sour. There is some bitterness from the grains at the back. Overall its OK. Not my favorite Pinkus but a good beer."
"Only my second Pinkus beer. The Jubilate pours a very dark amber, but is still somewhat transparent. There is nice head that laces the glass. It smells very rich, somewhat familiar but I can't put my finger on it. Taste is somewhat sweet at first, a little more bitter in the aftertaste. The taste lingers with you. Not my favorite beer, but it isn't bad."
"I was more than pleasantly surprised with this one, especially after seeing the overall rating. I personally think this one is vastly underrated!"
"500ml bottle, different label from the one in the site. ""certified organic"". Ok looking beer medium brown with a tiny tan head. I actually liked the aroma very malty, caramel,toasted cereals, hints of fruit, very nice. Taste is also malt dominated but slightly bitter with some biscuit aspects, Ok on the palate ,nothing special really. Nice enough beer but doesnt really appeal much."
"Drinkability: Not sure whether the souring flavor is intentional or due to age/mishandling but other reviewers have picked up on this; such a shame as the beer has nice qualities otherwise"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, nothing outstanding about this beer, but it's a solid dark and mild lager that is worth drinking if you're in the mood for the style."
"Drinkability: More than a bit bland and watery, making for a fairly uninteresting, unrewarding beverage. Pass on this, as I certainly will in the future."
"Pours a brown/dark garnet when helkd to light with a one finger off white headwith good retention leaving rings of lacing. Bready malt aromas-one note. Caramel and molasses backbone with some subtle spices mixed in- all spice & cinnamon with the maltiness returning in the finish. Mediium high carbonation, medium body with a chewy consistency. Nicely balanced, an easy drinking beer with clean flavors."
"Murky brown body, off-white head. The aroma is nutty, bread malt. The flavor has a primarily nutty character. Notes of toffee, caramel, brown sugar and some light fruity esters and a touch of spice. The flavors a balanced, soft, and rounded. The body crisp, yet smooth. Nothing earth-shattering here, but it is a solid offering. Another easy drinking organic lager from Pinkus."
"D - A very tasty dark lager- lots of nuance, a very good representative of the style. This was easy to sip while watching a dvd on the laptop"
"The most enjoyable of the 3 Pinkus beers I've tried. Looks like it got mixed reviews.... I think it's delightful."
"D: decent enough, but not something I'd buy again"
"Organic Pinkus Jubilate is not worth the $3.89 that I paid for it. I'm not even sure that it's worth half that. If you want to try something from this brewery, go with Munster Alt or Ur Pils. Bottom line: sorry, no jubilation here."
"Not bad but wouldn't search it out, bet it's richer on tap."
"D: An enjoyable brew but nothing earthshattering. I do enjoy the fact that all Pinkus brews are organic."
"D: I always like finding a new dunkel to try, and I certainly enjoyed this very solid effort from Pinkus."
"Taste is roasty malt, a bit of unsweetened chocolate with a slightly sour twang to it. The flavor profile is pretty decent, but it very watery and light. It is highly carbonated, but does not seem to affect the beer for better or worse. This would be a great session beer and could easily drink more than just a couple (if not for the relatively high price tag of $3.50), but it is lacking in body and depth of flavor."
"Pours clear brown with nice off white head that leaves a decent amount of lacing. Good chocolate carmel note in the front with a very slight metallic twinge that fades quickly,slight sour taste in the middle that is not offensive, yet present. The malty sweetness balances out nicely in the mouth finishing slightly dry and clean with a touch of sweetness again that is not cloying and fairly well balanced. The fact that it is organic adds to the appeal for me."
"The taste is really affected by the acidity though. It's not 'sour', but it seems like there was a fault in the brewing here, but maybe it was an old, or improperly stored bottle. It made it un-enjoyable."
"Apart from the decent Hefe, I've been pretty disappointed by the Pinkus lineup."
"Grab it if you like the style or German lagers as a whole."
"Highly drinkable - I could have a bunch of these. What a nice surprise - expected a good beer, but this was fantastic."
"Beer had a very earthy aroma with toasted wheat and hops. little bit of a caramel/toffee smell. tasted similar, with another flavor that seemed almost (salty)? Not sure the flavor. I felt like a medium body that flowed smooth, but not too enjoyable after taste. I did not enjoy the flavor too much, but it got better as the beer developed and we progressed down the glass."
"Drinkability? I find it very tasty and very ""comforting"" so...I give it great marks. An excellent example of the style and I'm glad it showed up locally and for a very reasonable price."
"Notes: A solid Dunkel lager but nothing that inspires passion about the style."
"D: Decent drinkability for one, wouldn't consider this session material, was a tad sweet and fruity but the smooth clean german malting makes this worthy of at least a try."
"Pours a chestnut color with a thin head that settles to a thin ring. Smells lightly roasty and with some bubblegum notes. Somewhat grainy as well. Somewhat similar in the mouth, but there is also a grainy sourness and a slight caraway spiciness. A little then, but interesting. I applaud the organic comittment of the brewery, and the beer isn't bad, but it could use a bit more character."
"I haven't had many of this style but I felt it didn't quite match up to the Ayinger comrade."
"3.5/3/3/3.5/3"
"Good stuff..."
"This beer poured a dark red-tinged brown with a big fluffy head. The smell is sweet toasted malt with some caramel. The taste starts off with some caramel sweetness that gives way to some nuttiness and a tiny bit of hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some moderate carbonation. This is a tasty beer that while it isn't anything that's going to blow your mind, is still worth grabbing if you see a bottle."
"Not a bad example of the style. Could be a bit thicker but otherwise, worth a try."
"The aroma is sweet and somewhat sour with grain, hay, grass, and herbs. The appearance is deep amber with an average head. The flavor is like the aroma with a cereal finish. The palate is thin but OK. Overall its a quality beer but I am just not into it. It reminds me of an Oktoberfest beer."
"Reddish brown body, high clarity, looks like sun tea. Soft edges with fine lacing. One finger of foam that fades into a skim after a couple minutes. Aroma was a little funky after the first pour, but seems to open up a little after that. Bready with mild caramel, wood, and tobacco notes. More of the same in the taste, light and somewhat dry in the woodsy finish. It's not overly sweet like some MDL's, more like an imperial Maerzen or something. Body feels more moderate thanks to the carbonation. Overall easy to drink, sort of hearty, halfway to a doppelbock. Clean and fairly tasty."
"There is just enough complexity here that I could drink a few before getting bored of it. It is light and smooth enough to be sessionable but the alcohol starts to peek through a bit too much, especially since it is only 5.5%"
"Organic Pinkus Jubilate Special Reserve Dark Lager pours a dark brown color with a white head from a brown half liter bottle. The aroma is quite mild, a bit malty perhaps. The flavor is also malty. Very drinkable, relatively light body (as appropriate for the style)."
"It's also worth mentioning, that my label looks nothing like the one pictured. The label on my bottle is white with gold text and says, ""Pinkus Jubilate Special Reserve Dark Lager""."
"It is a beer quite variuos, with a smell that changes quickly. But the overall judgement it is not positive."
"M"
"Nice deep garnet, the head modest in size, frothy and the lace is quite decent. Nose is that earthy organic malt, slightly sweet, hints of caramel. Front is malt, the top slender in feel, the finish minimally acidic, the hops sparse in presence and bite, dry aftertaste, and a bit of a disappointment to me as I expected a bit more Robustness and body, average is the best I can do."
