"O: I certainly liked this beer it had good flavor and was very drinkable if underwhelming.  However the scent of the beer was great complex and inviting it was a very pleasant aroma. I do not want to sound like someone who dismisses macro brews but I feel like that is what is holding this beer back perhaps that's just my bias. Still it is worth a try and is a good option if the selection is otherwise limited."
"Flavorful, rich, but not heavy. Intense dry malt..  I thought it was worth drinking."

"Overall, this beer suffers from green bottle syndrome, but is otherwise sessionable when in the mood for the style."

"Creamy brown pour from the bottle with very little head. Aroma is a sweet roasty malt, rather rich, with some spice. Flavor follows closely, with deep sweet malt flavors, roast, watery chocolate. The finish here is a bit rough just like other St. Pauli's. Mouthfeel is full bodied for the ABV, with adequate carbonation. I find this very similar to Leinie's dark, though not nearly as pleasant. Can't recommend this one, but not nearly as awful as the regular St. Pauli."

"Clear dark brown pour, fast dissipating fine white head. Lightly roasted malty aroma and sweetness flavor with a tad bit of biscuit and bitter spices from the hops. In short it's just a below Average Dunkel and probably not the best example of the class, but it's still easily drinkable. And if I was to describe this beer it would be like a watery Pilsner with lightly roasted malts."

"Pours a clear dark reddish-orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks and dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and bread. Taste is much the same with burnt and fruity flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a slightly below average beer that is drinkable but nothing I would want to drink again."

"I was expected/hoping for a more...shall we say, ethnic?...version of the Girl on the label. Oh well... This stuff pours a clear garnet-brown topped by a finger of sandy tan foam. The nose comprises barley, very light and watered-down cola, and very-lightly-toasted biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, with a thorough sense of sourdough-ish bread pervading the proceedings. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, a pretty limp beer, with hardly any character to its name. Thankfully, though, this means it has little in the way of true offensiveness as well, but that's a pittance of a consolation."

"O: Although this beer came in a green bottle, it doesn't taste skunked. The beer is very easy to drink and I would have no problem drinking several of these in one sitting."
""
""
"Better than the pale lager, but a way's away from a good dunkel. That said, it would be an acceptable choice in a pinch."
"O: Overall this is a very easy drinking beer that is sessionable and would definitely be worth having again."

"saw this in the store and it called to me and wow glad i did , great color almost black very tasty this beer works for maybe on a winter day or a summer day this beer taste great and looks great it offers something for people who dont like heavy beers just right in the middle its german and it dark and i like for a slow night in november not a bad beer enjoy"
"O: Overall an ok beer but can do without it maybe just not my style or fitting in my taste zone."

"O: I'd say this was an average-tasting dunkel"
"Definitely some issues with this brew. There are many better in this style."
""
"Not great, not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
"O) This is far from terrible or undrinkable, but if you are in the mood for a good dunkel, this should not be your plan A. In fact, it likely should not be your plan B, C, or D. You get the picture."
""
"Easy to drink, nice variety of flavor. The carbonation was good, but I would have liked more. This is a totally decent beer."
""
""
""
"O: basic euro-lager, It's nothing great but it was drinkable but I don't think I would buy this again"
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability - Paired this with breakfast. Eggs, homefries, and bacon. Worked well. Could be a little less tanic. Decent over all."
""
"I like this and feel as if this could be a good fallback session beer if in need of something to drink a decent amount of but don't want a macro brew. With a bit more presence on the palette (less water) plus a better head retention I think this could easily be a much better beer."

"O: Goes down easy. Not great but not bad for a north German beer."
"I used an aggro pour to divine as much head as possible and lo and behold, just under two fingers of deep-tan head with excellent retention appeared! Color was special and dark - it looked like a museum-quality ruby with NE-quality clarity. My uncle is a geologist who volunteers in a museum and I have held a ruby of this color. C'est magnifique! Nose smelled of coffee, chocolate and grassy hops. I love a mash-up/melange and this seemed poised to satisfy. Mouthfeel was on the thin side, but the flavor began with a Saaz hops bite, then kicked in with a light roastiness and I was sent. Man, this was about the best beer yet today, which my not be saying much, but it was more than I had hoped for going into it. Finish was semi-dry and the roasty/hoppy flavor lingered well after the swallow. Again, being realistic, it may not have been any great shakes, but if you see it next to its white bread, same-old, same-old sister, try some strange for yourself. Don't knock it 'til you've tried it, dig?"
"This beer is okay, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it, and can't imagine I would choose it over anything else that was available."

"St. Pauli Girl Special Dark is an easy drinking light flavored Dunkel – making it a good session brew. If you are looking for a change of pace from a light in color [golden lager] beer to drink during the hot months this could be the one for you."
"Overall: This beer does not have any characters that make you want to drink more than one. Not recommended by this guy"
"Overall - It basically tastes like your basic euro-lager with a touch of smoke and raisins.. It's nothing spectacular but it was quite drinkable. Not something I'd buy again however."
"Smells slightly of honey and malty sugar. In the mouth, nuts and dark sugars proliferate: caramels, toffees and deep syrups. Lightly hopped and sparkling on the tongue, this brew is quite flavorful, and has a mouthfeel of carbonated water. Quite decent fare; a good introduction to brown ales and such medium-heavy fares for those not acquainted with anything bearing any severity."
"O: Eh - nothing special about this beer. Poor example of a dark lager in my opinion."
"Poured from a green 12 oz. bottle. Has a pretty dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mostly of malts. Taste has malts, a bit of nuttiness, some grains, just a touch of hops. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"O-for what it is, i love it. if you're in the mood for a dark german lager, this will hit the spot."
"D - Not bad overall, I wouldn't turn one down if offered. I'd very much like to taste it fresh or from a keg, I get the impression that it would fare much better than the imported bottles."
"This beer poured out as a nice shade of brown, the head was a little fizzy but still had some left over clumps on top. The smell of the beer had a little bit of the skunky lager aroma going on but was almost hidden by the sweeter malts in the brew. The taste of this brew had good flavor all around. The sweet caramel malts work well with the lager elements. The mouthfeel was pretty good, on the lighter side but had enough body to remain flavorful. Overall I enjoy this beer from time to time. I would pick it over a Becks Dark and a few others out there any day."
"Overall this was a nice little dark lager. Better then I expected. It was very light in feel and flavor, and served cold went down very easily."
"O- Regardless of the Best by date, I think I may have gotten a bad beer here. Didn't finish this one. Will post an update in the future."
"Overall: Meh. If you want a dark Euro lager, you can probably do better; but this isn't bad in and of itself. Ho-hum."
"Taste: a little on the creamy side. Do pick up some toasty malts. Dry and bitter but mostly the skunky aroma dominates. A beer that I won't ever order in a bar or resturant."
"D- Smooth enough, but mineral taste and skunk make it hard to drink. Thin but not as watery as most. Points for that."
"Pours a dark mahogany color, thin cap of khaki head, diminishing quickly. Scent is pale, mostly carmel malt and some earthy hops. Taste starts of with a mild sweetness and some earthyness follow. Once again, another beer without many flaws, except that it is weak, light and watery. All i can say is that a cheap amber lager beats a cheap pale lager any day."
"RJT"
"Drinkability - Well.... I do like this better than the St. Pauli Girl Lager. This wold be ok on those Fall afternoons. Probably won't make a special trip for this beer, but I can drink it. Mostly average to slightly below average in my opinion."
"Better than the regular St Pauli, more drinkable. But not better than average for something brown/dark."
"I poured this out into my Mass Krug from a 12 oz bottle and hoping to fill it with more. Clear born on date of APR 2011. This beer is a clear medium brown with a white head that lingers. Smells like toasted Caramunich malt, grain, and slightly floral...more than I expected. Taste is not to complex, toasted malts, crusty bread, and a medicinal hops with a grassy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin and not to much carbonation is present. It goes down fast and is thirst quenching which is what A dunkel is supposed to do! Correct to style. I am going to go fill the entire krug at this time. Very drinkable and very sociable. Solid cheap beer!"
"D- very good dark lager, I will definately have it again."
"This is a pretty average brew all around. I could see it being nice as a lighter beer with some ""heavier"" taste profiles. I bought this on special for 3 bucks for a six-pack, and will probably pick up another if there's any left at my next visit. For the full 7-8 dollars I've seen it elsewhere, it may not be worth it."
"D - Very very drinkable although the C02 was a bit too high for my liking. Still a decent Dunkel with a great price, and drinkable enough to quaff a six pack or more, to me anyway. Definitely worth a try, I'd buy again if low on cash. Cheers!"
"d: Moderately drinkable, it's alright.. Won't be buying again."
"Drinks slightly less well than average for the style. I wouldn't buy it very often."
"Clear chestnut brown with a collar and skim of fine beige bubbles coating the surface of the beer. Short-lived spotty lace. Light aroma, bready malt, sulfury hops, slight skunk. The bitterness had some presence, but the malt flavour was thin and there was a metallic quality that really took hold at the back of the palate. More sulfury hop notes that were distracting rather than enjoyable. Lingering metallic and slightly sweetish flavour. Light to medium bodied with lively carbonation, fairly dry. I wouldn't go back to this one."
"D- This is merely an average beer to me. Nothing very exciting about this one. Just kind of an average-at-best dark lager."
"Pours a brown color with a one finger head that quickly dissipates. I suppose the head could be described as ""off white"" or ""light tan"". The beer has a slight malty smell, with only a touch of sweetness and hops. Tasted kinda the way is smells, malty and a little hoppy, but its nothing to write home about. Thin mouthfeel and pretty average drinkability. Overall, I have been to Munich and have tried the Dunkel Lagers brewed there are they are all far superior to this beer."
"D-This is a typical mass-market German dark lager. There's nothing remarkable about it. It's a decent brew but that's all. It fits into the session beer niche quite nicely. I won't buy it again, but I probably won't turn it down, if offered."
"Thin, acidic and too fruity for a lager all rush to my mind upon just the first sip. Cardboardy stale malts and a mild sugary sweetness, but really lacks in any type of malt depth and hops are tardy with only a bit of minty cleanup duty on the finish. I am glad I got this as a single, as a six-pack might take a while to finish. Not horrible, but I cant help but think this might fare better in the Euro Dark Lager category...as is, this would rate near the bottom in terms of dunkels I have had."
"The body was good for the style, crisp yet nicely full. Drinkability was good, easy and clean. Overall, not a great beer, but not a bad one. Perhaps a decent choice when options are limited."
"medium body, heavily carbonated and quite filling. I don't find this beer un-enjoyable, but definitely would stop at one."
"While this offering is in no way offensive, it's something you'd only get it if it was on sale. There's a sort of burned muddiness in the base flavor, and the hops are either too strong, or not strong enough (which makes me think they lack soul). The aroma reminds me of the cheap, soviet-era polish imports I drank when I was young and broke."
"Mouthfeel seemed to be the highlight for me. Decent amount of heft...and it just felt authentically German to me, having been there before."
"I think I could drink a lot of these."
"Overall, this beer is hindered primarily by the nose and how the package fits together as a whole."
"D: This brew is crisp and easy to drink. I unconsciously finished it in under three minutes. It really tastes a lot like regular St. Pauli, but with a hint of the aforementioned malt characteristics. I'd buy this for friends, if not to just change things up a little."
"This was pretty good. It pours to a dark body, with a decent head. It doesn't taste much like a dark beer though. It has a bit of coffee note in there, but it tastes almost like regular Pauli Girl to me. Pauli Girl was the first beer I ever drank, so...just a bit of bias haha. It had skunked just a little bit, but no worries, smooth barley and malty flavor, just a little bitter."
"Beer slogan, You never forget your first girl!"
"Honestly, if I didn't know anything about beer styles, and what a Munich dunkel was supposed to be, I MIGHT rate this beer higher. I'm just sayin'"
"This is actually not a bad beer. Way better than the pilsner. A bit foamy on the pour, nice dark lager. Nothing overly offensive, some nice caramel malts and a bit of hops. Goes down rather easily. Taste is good, a bit of brandy like quality and some smoothness. Not a bad session beer."
"It's hard to believe I've never written my thoughts down about this accessible, this one appears a dar cola brown with ruby highlights forms a light beige head that sticks around for some time. Minimal scattered lacing lines my 1/2 liter mug. Aroma has a slight toasted malt character with minimal herbal hops accenting the malts. A bit of a sourdough or biscuit yeast edge in the nose as well. Flavor is decent a touch of chocolate mild tartness from that yeast driven malt profile. Herbal hop bitterness in the finish, a nice mass produced dunkel it is what it is. Mouthfeel is thin lighter bodied, flows well everybody has crossed paths with this beer on their way to craftbeerdom. Drinkability is decent a twelve pack was on sale for 10 bucks that's a great deal so why not here I am drinking some St. Pauli Special Dark."
"Drinkability: It's not awful, but I don't think I would get this again. Maybe if the mood struck me just right, but I doubt it."
"Drinkability? There aren't many Dunkels in town nor have I tried that many but in my book, this is tasty enough to give this puppy good drinkablity. I'm pleased."
"d- excellent drinkability. the mild but interesting flavor anyone can enjoy. and at 4.8% i could see myself enjoying a bunch of this back to back. also not bad for price."
"Appearance is a very dark amber with a thin head. Smell has a very light roasted maltiness with nothing else really sticking out. Taste definately has the roastiness with a good balance of hops. Mouthfeel is almost a medium with good carbonation. A good dark for those warmer days."
"Ruby amber with a pock marked sand colored head that leaves some splotches of lace on the glass. The smell is like any Euro pale lager, with a slightly skunky quality that fades after a few minutes and just a whiff of toasty malt. Not bad tasting at all, just a little too light for the style. Thin mouthfeel with bright carbonation, finishes dry. An okay session beer."
"Amber-brown in color. Smell reminded of Heineken for some reason. The taste was decent, it had a very thin feel and didn't have any real standout attractions. It has a light malty hop flavor but it doesn't exactly come out and grab your attention. The mouthfeel is thin, drinkability is good."
"Not bad overall"
"This was a surprisingly drinkable beer. It's got decent color, smells like a beer, has slight bitter from the hops; but it's very smooth. You could drink several of these and enjoy it."
"I have before and probably will again drink quite a few of these in one sitting, very drinkable beer despite it's flaws."
"It's drinkable."
"There are some roasted and chocolate flavors here, and the malts and slight caramel translate decently to the aftertaste. The carbonation is a little much but fit the style pretty well. This is not something to get real excited about but okay for what it is."
"Smells like a BMC beer to be honest. nothing in particular stood out besides that. Put your nose to it, and then a bud, and at least they smelled similar. (i am sick though so this could be a false positive reading) It tasted as it smelled, but the malt came through in the aftertaste which i wasnt expecting and i was happy to see. The low alcohol content makes it very easy to put down a bunch of these, but the taste doesnt justify it."
"Initially, the beer has a slightly skunky nose. After sitting out of the bottle for about twenty minutes, that aroma is gone, and this becomes a much better beer. However, it isn't something I will make a staple, but I might have one once a year."
"When I first took a drink I was surprised by how light the brew tasted. For a dark lager, there is not much thickness in the taste. I was looking for something with a little more chew to it, but this is different (not necessarily bad, just different). You can definitely taste the malt. It is more on the toasted variety and once again not as heavy as many dark lagers. There is also a hint of sweetness in the brew, maybe from molasses? The aftertaste is dry with the malt flavors sticking around after the last drop."
"But I liked her as a white girl... oh well. Out of the bottle this beer looked like Coca-Cola with lots of rising carbonation and a thin, tan head. The retention was pretty good but the lacing left much to be desired. The aroma was of slightly musty malt, macro lager mash and dry grains. The flavors also were unimpressive. It started with some toasted malt, but then went straight to assorted dry grains similar to an Adjunct Lager. The finish was bitter but a little askew, like used coffee grains. The mouthfeel was a little rough and slick, the carbonation medium/high and the body medium. I still thought it better than the regular St. Pauli girl, but not worth picking up again."
"D: If there was nothing else around that I like, I could drink a few of these, but it wouldn't be my first choice. Not really a whole lot going on, tastes like honey and water with a hint of skunk."
"St. Pauli Girl Special Dark pours a dark brown with a thick off white head from a green twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is grainy and bland. The flavor is sweet and a touch grainy with only a hint of malt. Not much in the way of hops either. Pretty bland, I'd pass."
"Overall: The mouthfeel has carbonation and is thin to medium. The after taste is slightly hoppy but smooth. Not too bad, but had better."
"A bit better than its pale counterpart. Pours a caramel color with a big off-white head. Pleasantly sweet aroma of caramel, brown bread, and floral hops. Taste is similar to the original, but with caramel malt flavors added. Bit of a tangy bite when the beer gets to the end, not sure what that is about. Not bad."
"This beer was part of a 12 pack freebie that I received on Thanksgiving, so no real complaints in that regard. I do love dunkels, but this St. Pauli Dark did not live up such, although is a decent beer in a general way. The pour was nice, but a little flat, leaving a thin head with a soapy-flower malt taste with hints of coffee & bitter nuts. The flavor seemed a low-end dunkel or Scotch ale, and left a slightly stale hard water aftertaste. In spite of these critiques, it was a decent alternative if faced with a macro-brew."
"The taste is okay, and you better let this one sit and settle for a bit, because right out of the bottle, the beer is not good. Once it settles in, it actually is a decent Euro lager, that still has that overly processed, macro flavor to it, with perhaps some adjunct sweetner. There is a bit of a dark malty bite to the beer and some metallic flavors underneath. If you can detect it, there is a pleasant roasted and nutty flavor to the beer hidden even deeper underneath, but there is too much over-processing of the beer that it gets masked over. The beer overall is a notch above mediocre, but nothing I would reach for in the future."
"Blelow average but ok....But not something I will ever revist."
"MF&D - On the thin side, but not a bad option for the $$$. Easily sessioned. A little better than expected. In the world of mass-produced beer, its better than Becks Dark."
"Pours a nice clear mahogany with a decent sized, but not very persistent, tan head. Aroma is malty with just a hint of molasses, crisp like a typical lager aroma. Flavor is fairly smooth, malty with some hop bitterness and a subtle undertone of molasses or caramel. Texture is rather smooth, and it does dance a little on the tongue."
"The aroma was a bit subdued but had a nice roasted malt aroma but not much more. In drinking it you got a slight bitterness to start then a soft malt backbone and with was fairly dry. It had a medium body with a finish of bitterness. Overall a pretty middle of the road brew."
"Finally tried this, I expected a bit better. Dark but thin colored. Smell was like molasses Taste was sweet and herby, though noticably weak. Had a bit of an alcohol burn which is strange with such a weak beer. A bit more drinkable then something that tastes like this should be."
"D= Again, not a bad beer, and I have always prided my self on being a beer geek, not a beer Snob, so if I walk into a pub or a party and this is what they have, I don't mind having one, but I don't usually seek it out."
"To be perfectly honest this is an average dunkel, fairly solid in all categories but average for the style. I have enjoyed this beer in the past and I continue to enjoy drinking some of these from time to time. Pours very dark for a dunkel and produces a thick foamy head that ultimately turns to a thin film. Minimal lacing slowly creeps down the glass and I am not able to determine the carbonation since I can not see through my glass. The aroma is malty, sweet, and bitter. I gave it a below average rating only because the aroma is very hard to detect, I'm forced to shove my nose down into my glass in order to pick up any scent. The flavor is definitely based on the original lager, but it appears to be altered with some sweet malts. The combination is very good and I sure do enjoy the overall taste of this one. The mouthfeel is decent not too thin and the finish is clean and smooth. All in all a well rounded beer for this style."
"Poured a dark brown that light passed through slightly when held up to light, and had a decent head that left minor lacings. A light smell of hops and very faint maltiness comprises the aroma. A very smooth, light-bodied beer that has some mild sweetness, as it tastes a little like roasted malts mixed with caramel or honey (or something thick). Didn't really get much of a hop presence, although there is a dryness on the end that I chalked up more to the malts than any hop bite (still an earthy, floral hop presence is there). Not a bad beer, better than the regular St. Pauli."
"Not undrinkable, but the metallic notes and the vagueness of the ""dark character"" didn't thrill me. Still, it has a certain drinkability to it, though there are other European dark lagers I would easily take over this one."
"I could easily drink 8 or 9 of these. I would suggest this as a good ""beginner dunkel"" to anyone who curious in the style but not for the real drinker. I would suggest paying a dollar more for warsteriners or becks"
"D: Pretty average beer, but still has some complexity. Still better than most macros."
"M/D: Very light feel in the mouth for a dark beer and it didn't support an bitter or sweet tingles on the tongue so it was very bland feel. The drinkability was rather harsh because of the pour taste and smells."
"Overall. A decent brew. Definately drinkable in mass quantity. Better than regular St. Pauli Girl. Something I may try time to time when resteraunts have a small import section."
"The only beer that should come in a green bottle is Stella Artois. I just don't like em! Personal preference thing, i suppose. This beer falls way short. It has a nice dark color and a decent aroma, but the taste leaves more to be desired. It tastes like skunky Heineken with a bit more roasted maltiness. Not a very good beer."
"Drinkablity: A decent brew, but nothing that stands out from the crowd."
"Certainly not an outstanding dunkel by any means, but definately adequate. This is a good introduction to dunkels for those who otherwise claim to dislike dark beers; I've turned a few 'average' beer drinkers on to the the pleasures of darks by starting them with this and working them onto better brews. While price should never be considered, I feel it would be unfair not to make a note of it; If you need a decent dunkel and don't have much money to play with, this is the way to go. Another positive is that you can pretty much drink these all night, and temperature does not seem to have a major impact on quality; I've had these warm and ice cold and it tastes good in both cases (though I prefer it cold)"
"This beers pours a very dark, muddy brown with a slight tan head and very little lacing left along the glass. The smell is of sweet malt and a hint of molasses. The taste is a bit murky--the malt and grain comes through, but there's not much to it. A good amount of carbonation but not overwhelming, which would make this a good ""dark"" session beer to have."
"I only bought the St. Pauli Girl brews today to review; in the past, I've purchased them on brew days if I was attempting that particular style.. after tonight, I can honestly say, I will never buy this company's brews ever again."
"Other that the slight plastic flavor, not a bad beer."
"I have had Dunkels before, and this one did not make a good impression, it was pretty bland. But I will do my own beer shopping from now on, and stick to my stouts and ales."
"St. Pauli Girl Special Dark pours a thin, dark, blackish brown. There is no major head, but a little foam puddle in the middle of the glass. The smell is nicely distict of a German lager. Initially, the taste is tart with a high caronation feel. This brew burned while presented too cold; however, it mellowed shortley after getting closer to room temp. Overall it got a bit better, but it didn't get great."
"D - I was rather disappointed with this beer I don't know why but I expected more from it when its really just an average beer if that"
"Drinkability - Got a sixer of these a few months ago. I am just getting around to finishing them now. It is a drinkable, but not very complex brew. For those who are more into BMC, this might be a good segway-dark beer."
"drinkablility- try this on your friends who claim to not like dark beers. one could pound these all day, refreshing as they are with sophisticated, however slight, malty nuances.. made for the dark beer lover on a very hot beach."
"Poured nicely and looked as if it were going to be a pretty good beer, but man was I wrong. The looks are very deceiving regarding this beer. It looks tasty, smells like nothing in particular, and tastes like seltzer water mixed with a dark beer. I am very disappointed in this beer."
"The drinkability is ok, not a brew I would buy but not offensive by any stretch. Prosit MK"
"drinkability is decent. the structure does not hold together very well, with a sporadic flavor profile. not very impressive"
"It pours out a dark color with little head and smells of a toasty caramel. It tastes smooth with little carbonation. There is a taste of coffee and caramel. It goes down nicely but overall just isnt a great beer. I would drink it again but wouldnt rush out to buy it."
"Overall worth a try to be able to look at the pretty girl on the bottle and thats about it."
"Poured into a mug. Deep almost black with tan head. Smells of coffee grinds and slightly herbal. Tastes of chocolate and coffee, some citrus notes. An average brew, but very acceptable. Nothing wrong with a cold one of these if there isn't a lot to choose from. Had this one at a pool hall."
"Creamy and rich, the body is the least troublesome aspect of the beer. Quite good in this area. However, the sweetness morphs into a stale grain flavor which greatly hurts the drinkability."
"this one is merely okey-dokey."
"Pours brown with some ruby notes and a slightly off-white head that dissipated rather quickly. Not much aroma to speak of, maybe some small notes of caramel. Taste is slightly metallic with a sweet caramel flavor coming throught. Mouthfeel is okay, nothing special. Drinkability is alright, but I would much rather have a Sam Adam's Black Lager."
"This beer smells very sweet and light. The color is a very dark color with a very white head for such a dark beer. The taste is very light with a very dark finish. The taste is very malty and very little hops. It is very sweet with not alot of bitterness that reminds me of the orignal St. Pauli's Girl, but with a heavier malty flavor. Good feel in the mouth and very drinkable beacuse of how light it tastes."
"this is a dark colored pilsner in my opinion,dark w/ a slight white head; hoppy w/ very faint malt aroma; crisp light taste the hops come through ,slightly malty, just a faint bit watery tho, with it's light body & dryness i believe this beer is quite drinkable."
"Not bad but I would not buy it again. Unfortunately I've not had great success finding dunkles around. This one is passable but not among the better examples. Still, there's nothing terribly wrong with it and I'm glad I gave it a try. The malt does come out a bit as it warms, so don't drink it too cold."
"No need to session this unless you have a keg of it and need to get rid of it before you take it back."
"Drinkability- Not as complex as I am accustomed too, but would be an easy fit for the ""common"" man looking to extend his palette with a dark Euro lager."
"Smells of dark chocolate and hops. Pours to a translucent very dark brown but slightly bronze. Nice micro bubble head, slightly off-white. Taste is sweet and malty with a nice semi-sweet hopped finish. Carbonation seems high but doesn't overshadow the bitter finish. Not a whole lot different than most qualities of regular st. pauli girl, just a more roasted backgound. This is a good no nonsense beer that can be dranken all day long. Went real good with my pot roast the other night. Oh by the way check out the ""new"" st. pauli ""girl"". She's hot!"
"12 oz. bottle- color of cola , with a medium tan head - nose of malts , sweet white corn , some grass , and slight coffee , chocolate  taste of malts , grass , sweet potato/yams? , and light hops - body is light , and with high carbonation  aftertaste of sweet , acidic , and burn malts"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Activity that borders on boistrous... it's prickly at first but quickly relaxes without losing its fervor. Great choice for traditional German meals that incorporate a richer palette of ingredients and flavors... a quick and easy choice regarding its availability and price."
"Drinkable but not great. There are much better darks out there to be had."
"Pours a translucent brown with a very slight hint of red with a very pale--though not white--head. This started off at about a half inch and dissipated ti a thin, thin film quickly (maybe 1-2 minutes). Smell was a combination of caramel and mild chocolate with some hops there, but to faint to characterize their smell. taste reveals a bitterness that slides from hops to something else. (Some previous reviewers described their beers as skunked, but I might not go this far with this one.) To me, this particular bottle was more about getting uses to a lager after so may ales. I say this b/c at root it had the sharpness/bite that I associates with the ""big"" European lagers. Underneath this--in an interesting reversal from the smell--comes the caramel/chocolate mix. Not my favorite, but certainly not close to a train-wreck of a beer either. The mouth feel was actually a highpoint for me: good, thick body that was refreshing even despite the flaws in taste. Drinkability: I don't have much experience with this style, but I might prefer a Schwarzbier like Sam Adams Black lager over this beer. Good for parties--and for macro-loving friends, but I'm not sure this beer would make me a convert to Dunkel."
"D - A good session brew that leans toward the dark side with light roasted flavors and a thin drinkable sessionable quality. This is very much like a schwarsbier and a good stout or porter alternative for those who like their coffee weak....I prefer my coffee at full on black Starbucks strength."
"On a side note the labels came off clean and easy with a little hot water."
"This beer is kind of skunked. I don't give a shit. I will review it anyway, because it's in a green bottle and that's what happens. The head is decent on this beer, other than that everything else is subpar. Doesn't even really taste like a dark beer. Mouthfeel isn't that clingy, and this beer is hard to drink due to a cheap taste and slight skunkiness. Don't waste your money. There are better beers out there."
"I'm a fan of Munich Dunkels. This is the worst example of the style that I've had."
"Are you sure this is not a BMC product?"
"D- I'm not feeling this one and I will probably never buy it again. Its not bad but not what I expected. Perhaps I am suffering from label bias."
"Simply ok. There were no attributes to gravitate toward, while showing blandness and a substandard body. The beer came across a bit like charcoal with the toasted grains, little breadiness, little yeastiness, and not much else. The aroma was light a mimics the charred flavors. Finishes a bit watery and dull. Cannot compete with great German Dunkels."
"D-Fair, as I mentioned before, better than the original but still nothing very exciting or particularly good, just decent."
"Did I get a bad bottle or something? There's no carbonation in this beer at all and that makes it not very drinkable. I think this could be a really good brew if there was some decent carbonation and head."
"The beer pours a brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a semi-sweet crystal malt scent along with a dry toastey aroma. The taste is decent also. It has a dry, toastey flavor that goes down easy and finishes malty with some metallic notes. The mouthfeel is average. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an above average lager. It's got decent malt flavor, but the lager yeast makes the mouthfeel too metallic tasting and dry."
"Not a good beer. Tastes bad and has no other redeeming qualities. It's like they poured some malts into one of their already skunked lagers."
"The flavor is very light and dissapointing. I expected more from it. There is a little bit of dark malt flavor, and a hit of hop bitterness. Light bodied with medium carbonation. The finish is clean with not much aftertaste."
"pours amber...no head...no lacing....the most watery dark beer I have ever had...completely unimpressed!! Very metallic with a hint of stale cocoa. Really....this is terrible. Metallic water with brown food coloring....I don't mind their lager...it's average....this is not! On the same level as Mich Ultra Amber...and that's NOT a good thing."
"This is a beer that I really enjoy, living in a small southern town with no micros this is one of my standbys. Thin head on pour. Color was dark dark copper. Looked beautiful when the light shined through the glass. The taste and mouthfeel are really good, and this is a beer that you probally shouldn't start drinking unless you plan to stay home, because one ins't enough."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, I wasn’t expecting much from this beer, so I was surprised that I actually found it to be pretty decent overall. However, it wasn’t much better than decent."
"An average beer."
"Drinkability- Not bad."
"Notes: Not bad. Light on the flavor, but quaffable."
"Par for the dark eurolager course -- not bad, but not a stand out in any regard either."
"Dark brown pour with a small head that left minimal lacing. First odors are sligntly skunky followed by a nose of dark malts. Slightly burnt flavor with a slight metallic tinge. Somewhat watery on the tongue. Finish is OK . Overall a very average beer at best."
"I think I got a petty fresh sample. I've had other St.Pauli Girl products in the past and battled the skunk twang. Not the case here, I finished this beer off rather quickly."
"pours dark brown with tan head which fades fast. weak taste of caramel burnt toast not much there. smell about the same. mouthfeel, carbonation is good but no body to it for a dark beer feels watered down. drinkability, not for me. I don't think I would give another try."
"For me I enjoyed this brew although it is a little pricey. A good way to treat your-self if you have a few extra bucks in your pocket."
"Notes--overall I was pretty unimpressed. Maybe it was just a bad bottle?"
"St. Pauli Girl Special Dark was a clear dark brown color with an off-white head. The head had decent retention and left some lacing behind. It smelled lightly of crystal malt. The taste was light as well with sweet malts and a dry, bitter finish. The mouthfeel was fairly light with a fairly high level of carbonation. Drinkability was average. There's nothing special going on here."
"Overall: I preferred this to the original St. Pauli Girl. Easy going, but nothing special; just a simple Dark Lager really"
"Overall. This beer is for the beer drinker not really into beer, but looking for that ""german beer."" With all honesty, this beer is a bit nasty, and i would be just fine not having it again...ever."
"bottle taken from my dad's fridge...best before 11.2006 printed on the reverse label"
"Eric"
"D- It was interesting, and flavorful enough to enjoy by itself, couldn't imaging having it with food, would more than likely overpower what you were eating. As noted in taste, the bite at the end was a character that has turned me off this selection, enjoyed it to an extent while i had it."
"Drinkability is so-so. The body is light, so it goes down easy but the lack of flavor doesn't drive one towards another sip. An okay choice for a venue dominated by the BMC clan."
"Cheers!"
"D - It is quite drinkable."
"The taste was a little sour. Like it had a tinge of pineapple, but not good pineapple. Toasted pineapple maybe. A touch of sweet on the initial drink but it leaves that sour aftertaste. Not that I couldn't drink it, in fact, I'd still take this over a Bud. But I wouldn't ask for it directly, that's for sure."
"Notes: Pretty lame by on every level. Only thing slightly interesting is the mirage towards the end that its going to finish crisp and clean only to pull the rug out from under your palate."
"It is a bit thin in the mouthfeel, but easy to drink. It is an ok brew, but nothing I would chase down."
"I'd recommend this beer to someone who is looking to branch out from yellow and domestic varieties of beer. It's inoffensive to the palate, and is a good place to get a foothold to ready your palate for more interesting and flavorful beers."
"Grab a Warsteiner or Ayinger. Or a Leinie's red. That's where the (good) flavour is."
"Drinkability: Yuck!! Nicht mehr, nicht mehr!"
"Drinkability: A good dark euro lager. Not my favorite style, but a good example of it, in my opinion."
"Opinion: Well, I have drank Shiner Bock, Ziegen Bock, and now St Pauli Girl dark in the same night. I guess I am making the rounds in cheap dark beers tonight. This one is definitely my favorite so far out of the three. I will have to go back and try Becks dark again after this. I would drink this beer if it were the best they had, but if I go out to a real liquor store, I am sticking with the better known German beers like Paulaner and Spaten."
"This is an unremarkable dark lager that will not offend, but it won't do much else. Buy this for your dark beer fearing friends if you can get it cheap."
"The main thing I got out of this Special Dark was that it actually tasted like Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate, at least the the end of it. Whatever flavors are added to make dark chocolate versus regular had to be added to this. One of the better Munich Dunkel's I've tried, but nothing too exceptional."
"This beer is, in a word, underwhelming. It is from a great beer maker (st. pauli) and i thought it would be great. what a letdown. don't even bother picking this up, its so sad. i really love what this brewer has done and continues to do with its other lines, but this tastes like a champagne in that it is overly carbonated and has a so so aftertaste. no head on the beer out of the bottle. i really don't understand what they are trying to do w/ this brew. disappointing."
"Overall: An above-average lager, definitely recommended."
"I could drink these pretty much any time, but it isn't a great beer by any means. I would prefer maybe a little more hop flavor and more of a mix of different malts. Tastes like they stuck to pretty much one flavor. Not a whole lot to this beer. I guess this would be good for an amateur."
"I'm disappointed to hear something like this is coming from Germany."
"Not spectacular but smooth and very drinkable."
"I wasn't expecting much from this beer, and I didn't get very much."
"D: A newbie could drink it. A beer geek could, but probably wouldn't want to!"
"Pours a dark tawny brown, nearly opaque. One finger head with lacking retention and low lacing. Euro skunk smell accompanied by pale malt, noble hops and grainy alcohol that carry over into the taste. Other flavors include rich toasted malt and ground coffee. Crisp, light body leaves a dry aftertaste. Personally, I think it has too much euro dark lager flavor, but I'll still take this over the original St. Paulie."
"Notes: average brew"
"Pours a dark amber. Head was fair,with a fair amount of laceing. Light, yet good flavor. This is a very drinkable beer.It's the type of beer that does not fill you up.You will want to have more than one. I like it better than the regular. Give it a try!"
"Drinkability: This is a nice option if the other beers are macros at a bar or restaurant."
"Two row spring barley from the south of England slowly roasted for darker color, a special strain of yeast, ice-age glacier water from the ""Rotenburger Rinne," plus hops from the famous ""Hallertau Hop Gardens"" in southern Germany."
"Poured a very dark brown color with a nice tan, foamy head. The scents are pleasing, nice carmelized malts and a bit of chocolate. The taste is strong of bittersweet chocolate and has a lingering dark roast coffee flavor. I thought it had quite a watery texture the whole way through, which may be the only significant downfall of this beer. Tastes good and easy to drink, I'm sure it will find its way in front of me again soon."
"Pours a brown color with amber hues. Off white head slighty sticky. Smells clean with grains, sulfer, and some hops. Light roasted malts, soft grains, and a light hops bitterness. Has a clean Slighty hoppy aftertaste. Light to meduim bodied. This is an average dark german lager. Easy to drink and goes great with a heavy meal."
"poured a dark color with nioce head that quickly disappeared. Smell was minimal. Taste was average with not attractive aftertaste.Not an extremely good beer. Poor example of this type of beer. There are much better beers of this type available. Not recommended"
"Pours a one-finger light brown head that fades quickly leaving traces of lace. Clear deep amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light bodied. Hints of a malt nose. I was hoping this would be better than St. Pauli Girl lager but nope this is thin and watery, tastes wierd and has a metallic finish. Freshness date - Mar 2005. There are much better dunkels. I'm glad I only bought one . . . $1.49 for a 12oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Deep dark mahogany color with a decent head of white foam. Aroma is sweet and grainy, a touch of caramel. Lacks the smell of good munich malt. Flavor has decent maltiness, somewhat toasted, very faintly bread-like. Hops are nowhere to be found. Moderate body. An average, uninteresting beer."
"Starting summary: Not that bad, not that great: a drinkable session beer if nothing better available. Poured a nice, clear mahogany brown with a quick fader tan head. But man, that classic Heineken skunky sulfur smell bums me out. Taste is somewhat plain; nothing stands out, but a decent balance with the hops and malt. Lite carbonation in the mouth, again, makes this OK for a six pack afternoon."
"Root beer brown in hue, nil head, loose carbonation; this ones come via their green bottle; yes dark beer in a green bottle. Sweet caramel and toasted wheat bread on the nose. Light roasted coffee beans, some cocoa and sweet malts along with a quick hop bite on the sides, don't be fooled though. Somewhat metallic and grainy, with dry oats towards the finish. Dont let the flavors fool ya  this one is bland and boring, although it has some flavors that are quickly detected, this one is bland and boring."
"Overall, not a bad brew at all. A decent session brew and it would be a welcome offering to me if available next to other beers that shall remain nameless."
"well, i just drank a six pack of this beer. it tasted sorta like newcastle, but not as much coffee or buttery flavors. a good ""dark"" beer. i like the way it made me feel. it made me feel like i was the captain of the starship enterprise and we were kicking intergalactic sphincter. i drank this really gross beer last night, and this beer (st. pauli's girl special dark) was as refreshing as a piece of lasagna to an italian person. this beer made me want to fight terrorism on the large scale. it made me want to enlist in the armed forces. it made me think that george bush kicks osama bin laden's ass. it made me feel closer to my dog, but not in a bestiality way. just in a ""man's best friend"" way. so in summation, drink this beer if you want to have a good time and there's nothing better to get."
"Its drinkable, but i prefer Becks Dark if i want a cheap German dunkle."
" Tastes like something a macro brewer would market as a dark beer."
"Pours out a reasonably dark blackish color with faint hints of red. Certainly not as dark as a stout, but this isn't a stout! A somewhat smallish almond-tan colored head appears readily, but disappears fairly quickly as well. Some very minor amounts of lacing left on the glass. Smells pleasingly of chocolate and malt, but nothing spectacular. Tastes fairly sweet with immediate hop bitterness to balance it out. However, it finishes with a thin tanginess that seems to give it a watered-down character. I believe this beer may actually taste better straight out of the bottle... Mouthfeel is unusually thin for a beer that is this dark. Not horrible by any means, but it seems to be much too thin for the style. Overall, its a fairly drinkable offering, but not something I would consider very good stylistically. I have enjoyed the six pack I purchased and consumed prior to writing this review (not in one sitting mind you!), but for the price, I won't be buying it again anytime soon."
"Drinkable, but there's a number of better options out there."
"I'm not impressed. St. Pauli Girl Special Dark isn't special, nor is it particularly dark. Take away the metal flavor and it might be a drinkable beer. Might."
"Beer after departing the 12-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass slightly hazy deep amber to brown color with a rather small head that is bubbly in texture and a light tan in color, the lace forms a thin but covering sheet. Nose is sweet malt, caramel, crisp and fresh, not a bad sniffer this beer, start is decidedly sweet, fair malt profile and the top skinny in feel. Finish is brisk in its carbonations with the hops light but noticeable, very dry and lingering aftertaste, once again drinkable but light."
"Nothing particularly outstanding about this beer. It pours with a moderate head that does not last. Flavor is a nutty malt with a hint of toast. Nothing to write home about but not a bad. Starts with a strong burst of flavor the fizzles very quickly."
"Note- Slightly better than standard St. Pauli Girl. Both beers aren't great, but are solid all-around and easily accessible."
"If your looking for one of those viscous darks that you can stand a spoon up in, then St. Pauli Girl Special Dark is not for you. If on the other hand, your looking for a refreshing lighter dark, then you will find a friend you can come home to."
"An OK drinking beer, but not something spectacular. Better than most of the mass produced beers, but the skunkiness took away from it."
"This beer is better than i remember. It pours a nice dark brown with minimal head that does not stick around. Not much of an aroma. There is very little hoppiness. The taste is good. It has smooth and sweet flavor of mostly caramel and a hint of coffee. It feels good in the mouth but leaves a mildly unpleasant aftertaste. It is very drinkable though. I would like to sit and have a good session with this beer at some point. Also, this beer seems like it would make some very good beer bread or biscuits."
"Ok drinkable, but I can get much better."
"Poured a deep amber brown color and was topped off with a very creamy tan head. The aroma has a wonderful grassy hop note with just a touch of sweet caramel. The taste is light and sweet with some roasted coffee. The body is light and almost watery. This one is very easy to drink. Pretty smooth."
"This one poured a light darkness in color with a good sized head. Smell and taste were skunky initially. The initial taste was also really grainy and astringent. But those flavors mellowed out as I went along. A mix of nutty sweetness and adjuncts came in then some bitterness finished. Quite thin and left my mouth feeling like it had a bunch of nickels in it in the finish. Not terrible, but not worth it either."
"I'll take this over domestic macros any day, but it's still nothing to write home about."
"has a sweet caramelish taste followed by a slight, very slight, hop presence. nothing overhwelming or spectacular, but better than most and it goes down easy and keeps going down easy"
"Skunked despite its dark color, the nose is still somewhat inviting with its ""European"" flair; and it reveals some mildly toasted, grainy malt once the 'skunk' has passed! Its deep chestnut/mahogany body supports a creamy off-white head that holds quite well before dropping to a wide collar; and it leaves some minor spotty lacing throughout the glass as well. It's light and crisp in the mouth with a fine, standard carbonation that awakens the tastebuds and refreshes the palate. The flavor reveals a toasted, delicately grainy malt amidst some yeasty sulphur, a touch of floral hoppiness, and a firm bitterness. It finishes crisp, dry, and refreshing with a subtle reminder of it's toastiness left in the mouth. Quite nice!"
"Pours to a thin white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of roasted malt and a ""green"" malt smell (I don't know what to call that smell...kind of veggie-like). Flavor is woody and malty with a low hop contribution. Finishes roasty, malty and bittersweet. Not bad, but there are better choices for the same price."
"This beer lacks character with respects to the nose and flavor.The head was small, tan and contained fine-small bubbles that quickly dissipated.The body was slightly cloudy and carbonated with a reddish-brown hue.The nose was lightly malty and some hints of fruitiness with a lightly bitter and smooth flavor.The mouthfeel was tingly and smooth with a watery-thin texture.This beer was light bodied with virtually no lacing."
"Dark brown color, medium head. A medium bodied dark lager. Roasted malts, slightly sweet and chocolaty. Some hop spiciness. Nice balance. Good flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet with a sight hop spiciness"
"Notes: Worthwhile only as an example of what a weak, unpleasant dark lager tastes like."
"A pretty tame brew altogether. Not offensive in any way, but failed to impress me in any category. Kind of expensive as well and definitely not worth the import price. Drinkable, and if found at a cheaper price would make for a good session brew."
"This beer pours a dark color with a moderate head. The aroma is a little sweet with malts and hops in it. The flavor is very smooth. I was thoroughly impressed at this one. It doesn't have a ton of character and it's not very complex, but I thought it was a very enjoyable beer."
"This beer pours out a color that is similar to a coke, with about the same head characteristics. There were some light caramel flavors, other than that i cant think of anything that it tasted like. Nothing special, not something i would plan on buying again soon."
"very dark and clear in the glass...ruby hues when held up to the light. moderate head dies down to a fine film. some lacing evident. light fruity aroma, slight hints of caramel and chocolate. floral hopping. light flavors of dried fruits, definite hints of chocolate and caramel. typical lagerish mouthfeel....light and crisp. some metallic notes in the finish. a nice, flavorful dark lager that surprised me. while not great...it's drinkable and somewhat refreshing. and plus that blonde on the label has got some serious nice beer mugs in her hands...three litres in each hand...she must be strong as hell."
"Dark brown in color, but accompanied by a sad, small head. Aroma is on the dry side, vegetal, small caramel notes, but a bit flinty, a touch on the non-distript side. Flinty, medium-bodied, some fine malty richness. Taste is fine, but nowhere near spectacular. An average ""dark lager", better than Heineken or Beck's , if that can offer any consolation."
"Amber red in color with a moderate off-white head with fair retention, good, albiet rather broken lace, mild carbonation. Toasty malt aroma reminiscent of German black bread with a slight molasses quality. Taste begins with nutty, toasty malt and carbonation that is a little too sharp, towards the middle of the taste metallic notes appear, finishes dry with more rich malt notes and a lingering bitterness. For my tastes, this is a nice middle of the range dark, although many other reviewers seemed to find less favor with it. Not a bad beer and certainly worth a try."
"Pours dark brown with a slight tint of red in color and with a thin tan colored head that very quickly dissipates into a thin lace. Nose is stale grains with some sulfur notes. Taste is toasted malts and grains with notes of caramel and bitter hops. Light and crisp in the mouth, but I wouldnt recommend this beer."
"Clear dark brown leaning toward the reddish side. Stubbornly refuses to generate a head, and it wont lace  almost like it was waxed. Somewhat biscuity aroma. Mildly malty flavors, some sense of distant molasses and dark Karo. Finishes over carbonated and faintly metallic. I didnt detect any skunk but this beer is no where close to the quality its price suggests."
"Better than the original St. Pauli Girl but that isn't really a big acomplishment in my opinion. Got this at a wedding recep (it was either this or Corona Light) so I figured what the heck. Dark honey color with a medium thick beige head with little lacing. Slight malt nose but nothing to write home about. Light malt and nut flavoring but again they aren't really pushing the envelope here. I would not go out of my way to get it again."
"I never need to drink another.  Not recommended."
"The taste was okay but the beer's flavor is not strong enough to withstand the effect of the mild skunking. It was half dark beer taste, half Le Pew. Sampling two more of the six revealed skunking on those as well. I still have 2 beers left, so I'm one for four on the six pack so far. There should be a law about putting beer in green glass. These packages sit under the fluorescent lights of Kroger's beer shelves for who knows how long. I probably got lucky that one beer tasted good, so I can only give this one 2.5's. My only advice is avoid the DGB's at all costs unless you know the beer arrived that day, then buy it and keep it in the dark fridge until serving time."
"Looks like a cola both in terms of carbonation (a spartan head) and color.  Smell is somewhat sweet and quite smooth, but decidedly unremarkable.  Taste is likewise unremarkable.  This beer's biggest virtue is its crisp, smooth mouthfeel and resulting drinkability."
"Pours with a very nice head that lasts quite a while for a lager.  Once the head fades, theres not much left to remind you of the impressive display from the initial pour, just a very thin ring.  The beer is a nice deep color, reminiscent of a cola; it has some transparency and some deep amber higlights.  The aroma is of roasted malt sweetness.  Very nice, but no hops are evident.  The tase is smooth, with a good bit of roasted malt and a hint of bittersweet chocolate.  There is also a nice hop bitterness on the finish.  A bit more sweetness is evident as the beer warms. The beer sports a fairly good mouthfeel for a lager, with a slight creaminess.   While the flavor is not exceptional, I think I could drink these all night long with no complaints."
"The color is not too bad, a deep mahogany.  Not so dark that you cant see through the glass.  Very little hop attitude, which actually makes it quite thin in texture.  No real head to speak of, only a faint line around the top.  The flavor, however, makes up for some of the texture, with a fairly rich taste.  The down side of that is a slightly acidic after-taste.  Maybe its just me but the aroma is what kills me about this beer, a faint impression of ivory soap…and no its not just my glass, it’s the same in the bottle.  However with all of that said, still a good beer with personality."
"I enjoy this beer. Roasted malt taste that isn't overwhelming.  A light chocolate and molasses presence.  A very drinkable beer.  A nice dark to introduce those who are ""afraid of the dark""."
"This is a poor example of a dark Euro lager. Needless to say I have no need to go back to this beer and don’t recommend it at all."
"This is a pretty average beer all the way through. It pours a dark brown/ruby color with a foamy head that you won't see for very long. Smelled kind of funky at first, but after breathing for a while, the smell improved a little bit. Damn the green bottles. The taste could use a bit more malty tones. Mouthfeel is very watered-down, but it's easy to drink. It's a good thing this beer was on sale at the store. I know I wouldn't buy it at full price."
"The chick on the bottle has some nice jugs, though. Like three in each hand. Of the liter variety."
"Edit:  After revisiting this beer, I think the smell was more malty than I reported and I think these were a little fresher.  So, I upped the smell from 3.0 to 3.5 and the drinkability from 3.0 to 3.5.  Not as good as the Warsteiner Dunkel, but good."
"This is a good,drinkable dark brown thats easy on the taste. I also thought its alittle thin on body. The tan head & lace are gone quickly (45 sec.) after pour,never to be seen again.Its a good beer to have around if you want the kids to think your drinking a flat cola."
"The decent and well retained head leaves very intracate a lace.  Dark ruby in hue and very clear like a well lagered brew should be.   Lightly toasted Munich malt aroma. Uh oh-- it's slightly skunked. The initially earthy and spicy Hersbrucker hop nose is followed by sulfury mercaptans. If it weren't for the green bottle and my bad luck, this would've smelled quite nice.  Clean all around in flavor, but nothing stands out and make this beer particularly memorable.  The body is a bit thin.  Sweet caramel and slightly toasty Munich malt flavors are there, but aren't particularly assertive.  Finishes sweet and inoffensive."
"Notes: Very drinkable and refreshing. I enjoyed it very much. A nice dark lager and overall import."
