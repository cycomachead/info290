3.74,1.4,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"another fun unheard of brew from the beer census guys, they really hooked me up! this is loosely a german dark lager, and i think its pretty authentic. the malt is more like a brown ale with some chocolate character, more like dry cocoa, and a hint of caramel while staying dry and light on the palate. the lager yeast is evident here, it does a nice job drying up the finish and giving it a seasonally perfect crispness. im not sure why i expected this to be darker and heavier like a porter, but i am pleasantly surprised by its lightness overall. the grain captures all the darker flavors, but drinks like a blonde lager, just easy down with upbeat carbonation and a quick finish. probably one of the better american takes on this style i have come across, true to german roots but just different enough. i could drink a sixer of these no problem, and enjoy and appreciate the lower abv.","StonedTrippin","Sep 30, 2014"

This beer is still pretty low octane, but it seems like it was brewed primarily with the wrong base malt (like US 2-row). This leaves the beer dry and grainy. There is some CaraMunich and crystal malts thrown in to make the beer taste heavier, but this doesn't make up for the fact that there should have been a larger percentage of Munich malt used in the grist. It is a pretty drinkable beer, but it is an Americanized German Lager. Not as bad as Shiner Bock or the likes...but still lacking roundness.","SkeeterHawk","Dec 31, 2005"

It is rather simple, but very strong and pleasing. The taste is a lot like the aroma, although the caramel taste is a little less intense than the overall malty sweetness.

Taste is yeasty with toasted bicuit, roasted coffee, lactose, and a bit of belgian-style dark fruits. This seems like a melting pot of dark beers to me, a melange of english brown ale, oatmeal/sweet stout, and a mild belgian. A bit scatterbrained perhaps, but I rather enjoyed it.

As the beer warms and breathes, a pleasant, light nuttiness emerges.  Virtually non existant Hersbrucker hop nose.  The initial flavor profile essentially mirrors the aroma, with chocolate notes and sweetness provided by caramel malt.  Mild hop and roasted grain derived bitterness surface mid palate and counters caramel sweetness well, facilitating overall balance and drinkabilty to this brew.  A bit too light in body and correspondingly light in mouthfeel.  Roasted grain and chocolate combine for a bittersweet, dry finish.
