"Really nice and easy to drink. Not too special."

"Overall: this one was a bit of a surprise after Kozel's pilsener. This is a good-quality, well-rounded dark lager that is very refreshing in the heat, as well as well priced at AU$62 for a case of 20 x 500mL."

"Bottle. Fairly full-bodied with small hints of roasted malt. A little thin but pretty good."

"Way too sweet in my opinion"

"A very good light dark beer. Great from the can."

"The beer mirrored what I've come to expect from Czech beers of late, highly drinkable, enjoyable with little to no off-flavours and very easy to drink."

"It's a nice dark lager, easy to drink."

"Overall quite unimpressed, close to the worst Czech beer I got from Prague. Not sur eif this was a bad batch, or just a poor overall beer but the reviews seem to be better than this. Not sure."
""
""
""
""
"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
""
"O: Decent beer but comes up a bit short for a Czech beer."
""
""
""
"O- The nice crisp clean bock turns a bit mineral water and a bit sulfury as it opens up. The fizz grows and scrubs a lot of the malt flavors away."

"Pours a dark ruby brown which leaves a two finger creamy head that stays and lots of lacing everywhere,the smell is fruitcake,cherries,caramel candy and marzipan,the mouthfeel is just over light bodied and disappointing with tastes of caramel candy,toffee malts,herbal hops,cherries and finished with a milk chocolate bittersweetness and overall not the worst and tasty enough for something of this low ABV cheers."

"O - Not bad at all for the style but I need more in the way of aroma and flavour from my beer. Just too bland."
""
""
""
"Velkopopovický Kozel Tmave 10° begins with a creamy tan foam, almost no aroma, and has a dark, reddish brown color. This is a sweeter lager, with a lighter, more liquid, smoother body. With a pleasant flavor of burnt sugar and caramel, you can taste the dark malts, alongside a hint of coffee and chocolate. Towards the end, you’ll notice a mild hopy bitterness, and the sharply carbonated bubbles add a nice little bite."

"D: This is a drinkable beer. I make a point to hit the border to get this beer at least every other month."
"Dr: Pretty drinkable, well priced by Danish standards, and decent quality. Danish beer drinkers on a budget rejoice; beer sommeliers out for quality ignore."
"O - exceptionally drinkable beer: my 1/2 L was gone in no time."
"Super easy to drink though."
"And cheap in AUS!!!"
"In short: A well balanced Czech approach to Munich Dunkel with clean lager character and pronounced nut aroma/flavor."
"O: A very nice beer with a heavy maltyness."
"Food match: Vegetable soup or beef stew with crusty bread, traditional Czech food (dumplings, sausages, pork and Svíčková)."
"D - strongly flavoursome beer that is perhaps too dominated by malt, but very drinkable if you enjoy malt like I do."
"Drinkability is decent, only draw back is hard to find."
"Paid it like $1.50 at my hostel bar. Cheap price, great beer. I really like the kind of chocolat/coffee aftertast. The only thing that is bad with this beer is that I can't find it back to Canada (Québec) ;)"
"All in all, a nice example of a dark Czech beer with some complexity and none of the heaviness of an English porter or stout."
"D: I could drink these all night because it almost goes down like water."
"D: The lactic taste seems to be very common among the beers I've had here in Russia. Either this is a taste design choice, or (more likely) every tap in the city hasn't been cleaned for ages. The locals must like it, though, because every place has a similar flavor."
"D: For a dark beer, quite decent."
"This was a bottle a friend just brought back to the US. He told me it was a Dopplebock & when I saw the goat I thought I was in business. One sip and I know it was of lower gravity. Nice and mellow but not really that interesting."
"D-- Workable dark lager. Would get bored with this after one or 2 of these. Mostly sweet and refreshing. I would not let this get too warm. Decent warm up beer for the night but not real memorable. Low ABV and easy to drink. Just not that complex."
"Definitely a lager, but with lots of malt character. Could cloy over time, but definitely a tasty sipper for one or two."
"Lacks body and substance in its bottle form, drank from a tap in Prague I thought it sweet, but it had more depth of body and character. Disappointed with the wishy-washy bottled version and it is my last beer from prague that I obtained to review, wish I'd kept something else back now."
"This is drinkable, mainly due to its lack of real flavour rather than being particularly special. An easy quaffer."
"Feel is quite sticky with a slight sharpness at the back. I wouldn't call it thin because for a 3.5% beer it isn't, but it's definitely a bit flat. I really could have loved this beer but it just doesn't push the right buttons. Some more spicy Czech hops would have gone down a treat. Or a man's treat anyway, because currently it tastes more like a young boy's treat."
"Dark, rich brown color. Slight head, light brown in color. Quite sweet with hints of chocolate and caramel (maybe even a little coffee or something). Sweet, malty flavor. Unfortunately, tonight is my last night in Prague so I probably won't get to try one of these again for a while. Perhaps I'll have one tomorrow morning before my flight. That sounds like a great idea."
"Had this at a very good beer pub in the Czech Republic. Good dark beer that was more like a schwarzbeer than a dark lager. Light in mouthfeel but with a great dark malt aftertaste. Could have had three or four more if it wasn't early afternoon. Would recommend"
"I poured into a pint glass to an inch of tan head. It is a dark reddish brown and clear. I can smell the sweet chocolate immediately. It tastes sweet and of chocolate as well. I am very impressed. I was not looking forward to trying this beer, but it is quite tasty. It is easy drinking. This is way better than Pilsner Urquell. Too bad she didn't bring some more back."
"D: Good. Not heavy, enjoyable, and flavourful. You can either sip it or guzzle it; either way, it's good."
"Overall this is a very drinkable beer. There is some complexity in the feel that is of kicking carbonation, but finishes into a mellow smooth and almost creamy beer. At 3.8% ABV this is a tasty and very sessionable beer."
"I wish I had known about this beer when I was in Prague in 2002. As nice as it is in the bottle I would like to have had it on tap. Some smart importer ought to try and get this beer into the states."
"D- I could drink this all night! I really love this beer it has a very rich taste."
"Anyway, quite pleasant and drinkable."
"D - Decent enough, but I'd have a different beer, rathe than another of this."
"I'm drinking it with Whittaker's dark Ghanaian chocolate and if I die right now it would be in a state of grace."
"D: Unreal -> I could have kept drinking this except I only had a pint (under $4AU too - great bargain)...beautifully balanced Munich Dunkel Lager (although reminded me more of an ale)"
"Now I buy it in the bottle, it's one of my favorites, on my opinion one of the best in this style(Munich Dunkel beer). Although it's not too sophisticated, the taste and aroma are rich."
"My favorite beer when I lived in Prague. It wasn;t as common to find as others but I found myself going to the same bars because I knew they served Kozel Dark. Dark Brown in color and poyrs a great head. Vert smooth and easy to drink, no negative aftertaste and I wish it was here in the US."
"Exceptionally drinkable, especially in prague where it is dirt cheap."
"ferry between Stockholm and Helsinki. From my notes - 7/8/2008."
"D: This stuff goes down very nicely. The low level of alcohol and light body accompanied with a reasonably balanced allthough simple taste make it very drinkable."
"Pours dark brown with a reddish tint around the edges. Medium beige head with fair retention. Stringy lacing. Light roasted malt and bread in the nose, with touches of fruit. Medium (bordering thin at times) smooth body with sweet caramel malt flavor along with dry fruit and rye. The finish is short and fruity with a lingering sweetness. Solidly average Dunkel all around."
"D - Nice enough but a bit too sweet for regular drinking."
"One of my top 3 beers while in Eastern Europe."
"1020"
"D- I could use a little more bitterness, but those who love a malty lighter lager should be into it. I have only seen it in the Czech Republic. Not complex or overly interesting but a good change of pace when in the land of pilsener"
"I had a half litre of this on tap in the Czech Inn, Dublin, Ireland on 5th Sept, 2007 (cost 4.60). Served in Kozel glass. Appearence was a dark mahogony brew with thinnish white head. Maybe some haze, but very dark so hard to see. Malty aroma. Tasted well; a not-too complex mix of maltiness and sweetness. A little too sweet for me, but a solid brew nonetheless. Nice beer."
"I was impressed by this beer and have not had alot of this style before so I would like to try more now. I would definitely try some if I saw it here in Ireland or if I go back to Praha."
"D: A nice break from Bohemian Lager, some nice flavours, would have again!"
"Overall it's not bad at all, much better than I had expected."
"D: Easy drinking, but more like a malt shake than a beer"
"The wheat and the cerne (dark) ar Pivovarsky Dum. Great little brewery that doesn't distribute, so you have to go there to try it. U Fleku was an interesting experience too. Their dark beer is good -- not exciting, but very easy to drink a lot of."
"Taste is good; drank it warmer than I prefer. Coffee, some chocolate, yeast and roasted. Yet was lighter than it looked, still easy drinking, though."
"Never tried the bottled version, but on-tap it's great! Very drinkable."
"A nice dark, thanks to Radek bought in Poland. Wine brandy colour, bit of lace. Licorice, bit sour, despite malting including caramel. Tad chocolate malt as well. Bit of roast. Not complex, easy drink. A particular dunkel style, OK but not that I seek out."
"Pure heaven compared to the bottled version you can find in Sweden!"
"Pours a clear cola brown under a two finger beige head with decent body and retention, leaving a few lace strands. The nose is very mild - just a bit of grainy malt (not the expected caramel). Slightly viscous mouth with medium carbonation. The taste is mild all around, with some sweet caramel malt as the primary flavor. Essentially no hops to break it up, so the caramel lasts well into the aftertaste. It's drinkable enough, but also pretty ho hum."
"Its low carbonation and its integrated flavours make this a great beer and begs to be drunk in quantity"
"D: overall it's a very easy-drinking dark beer, although I forgot its special characters, if any, almost as soon as a pint was dried..."
"Not a lot to say about this one. Average in about all respects, although I did like its appearance. Nice deep red color to it. Otherwise very simple beer. Lots of sweet carmel. this stuff is really sweet. A tiny bit of hops hits at the end, but it's barely noticeable. In all it's an enjoyable brew, but there's lots of much much better ones to be had."
"Notes: I've always liked this beer, and its best quality is the way it keeps after travelling - this tastes the same out of the bottle in Australia as in a Bratislava bierkeller. My favourite beer of the style, and most similar styles."
"This is another winner from the Czech Republic."
"Value for money gives this 5 stars. $3 for 500 mL when the local aussie swill is $2.15 for 375 mL. Would be nice to see a more robust version of this."
"Served a deep dark almost black with a hint of red color and a big tan headskie which was gone before I got a chance to blink or take a sip. Thin and lacking helpful mouthfeel. This one has that flavor which I like to avoid in beers so I will avoid this beer in the future. Very average and not worth seeking out."
"Produced from special dark malts, which is why the foam is even dark. It is very sweet and light in body. Low alcohol and light cabronation makes it extremely drinkable. The light-to-medium malt body with caramel malt flavors only add to the delicousness of this brew. It's only weaknesses are that the aroma isn't remarkable (how could it be when the taste is so mild?) and the head retention is somewhat poor. Tastee!"
"I personally feel that this particular beer is overrated.The colour is nice, aroma is somewhat grainy, almost full bodied with a disappointing taste...tad heavy on the hops with some lingering after taste.....The packaging was impressive tho........"
"OK, i only ever sampled this once, and yes i will resample again, given the hight ratings given so far, mine was sweet with a raisiny chocolate flavour, short finish and quite a syruppy texture, i'm starting to think my bottle may not have been as fresh as it could have been."
"Very deep and rich amber appearance. Light tan head, with some stickiness/Belgian lace.  Wonderful rich chocolate/coffee smell.  Unbelievable dark, rich taste.  This beer tastes very much like cocoa.  I can not imagine drinking more than one of these at a time, as one bottle would take the place of  a whole German chocolate cake and a cup of sweetened espresso."
"One of my favorite Czech beers...Richly dark and chocolate in flavor...I'm not sure if you can get this in the states but if you can I highly recommend it...a great everyday beer"
