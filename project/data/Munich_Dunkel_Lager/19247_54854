Their dunker is malty and clean with just enough bitterness to create a balance that's infinitely quaffable. Thanks again, Wil, a new favorite!","joe1510","Mar 28, 2014"

It seems that US brewers just love that roasty character, but a good Dunkel can be so delicious when you let Munich and Pils malt do their thing. That said, this beer is certainly well-made and delicious -- just expect more of a Schwarzbier in character.","steveh","Jan 18, 2012"

Aroma is strong and mostly consists if sweet caramel malts. More caramel malt in the taste with a spicy and slightly bitter hip finish. Medium body and moderate to high carbonation.

4.22,3.9,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Daydreaming of beer halls in Munich, and this beer appears in front of us. Chestnut darkness lures us in; tight head on top is not big enough to give us beer mustaches ... we move on. Massive onslaught of a pleasing breadiness in the nose, with hints of herbal hop. Firm, malty palate; semidry. Dark bread, faint sweet edge up front, quite toasty middle to end. Hops for balance, and a great balance there is with undertones of wild herbs and mint. This lager brings us further into that daydream of us drinking liters of Dunkel, which makes us crave fresh Bavarian brezel. Amazing.","BeerAdvocate","Apr 06, 2011"

4.08,0.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"The bitterness in this reminded me a winter warmer. It poured a little darker than OMB Copper. It smells warm and sweet. The taste is similar, but more bitter.

3.76,-7.4,4,3,4,4,4,"On-tap at Flying Saucer Charlotte served in a standard pint glass a crisp dark copper with a decent khaki head that diminishes to a ring and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is mild dark malts, not much else. The taste is a nice amount of smooth dark malts with a nice caramel finish. The beer is quite light, crisp and refreshing. This is a very enjoyable lager for a winter afternoon.","atsprings","Jan 02, 2011"
3.73,-8.1,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Pours a deep copper color with a thick whitish head and a good amount of residual lacing. Smells of roasted malts, a little pecan, and maybe toffee.
