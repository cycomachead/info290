Pours crystal clear reddish brown color with a small 1 finger tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Good spotty lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, nuttiness, biscuit, chocolate, vanilla, toast, and light fruitiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity. Taste of caramel, chocolate, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, toast, herbal, roast, and light dark fruits. Lingering notes of caramel, chocolate, herbal, toast, nuttiness, toffee, and light fruitiness. Nice balance and complexity of flavors; with no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a great Munich Dunkel! Nice flavor balance and robustness; and very smooth to drink. Really enjoyed this, and this might be my choice for an easily available dunkel in the future.","superspak","Sep 17, 2012"
4.03,6.1,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Taste rounds out a simpler cocoa and light roast maltiness with a smooth, dry finish. This is a pretty good stab at a Dunkel, Harpoon did a good job of keeping it simple and fresh. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side and the sweetness is lower than typical for the style, but those are pretty minor complaints. At 2.99 a bomber, this is a god deal. I have not seen this in sixers, but if I saw it at around 8 bucks, Id return to this one fairly often...especially with the much appreciated best by date. Props to you Harpoon, well done!","twiggamortis420","Sep 15, 2012"

4.08,7.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"My moderate pour still managed to produce a massive two-plus fingers of rocky, light-tan head with decent retention. Color was a deep mahogany-brown with NE-quality clarity and a good bit of carbonation in evidence. Nose was chocolaty, more like milk chocolate than dark chocolate, though. Mouthfeel was slightly full, thanks to all of the carbonation and the taste was of a mild chocolate, definitely not roasty. Finish was likewise pleasant and chocolaty. It was not a bad beer, but as a self-avowed hophead, I would not want more than a couple of these at a time.","woodychandler","Jul 24, 2012"

Aromas of roasted coffee and molasses, with a toasty quality, as well. The beer's flavors are darkly roasted, as well, with a strong coffee bitterness counteracted by a darkly sweet molasses and toffee profile. There is a toasty and smokey quality that enhances the sweetness, and makes this beer a great campfire brew. The aftertaste is slightly cloying, with a hint of the coffee bitterness and smoke to clean it all up. A slick, linger finish that recedes slowly from the palate. Good representation of the style, and a tasty beer overall.","GarthDanielson","Dec 27, 2011"

A really tasty example of the style (even though technically it's an ale!) that's easy to drink.","biggred1","Jul 20, 2010"

It has a tan two-finger head with a decent lace that slowly fades towards the end. The drinkability of this brew is exceptional. Very very smooth.

Smelled a lot like a porter though. Taste was a lot lighter than a porter, more like a dark ale. This beer has a lot of different characteristics, in case I am confusing you. Had a nice roasted barley flavor to it, but was a lot smoother that I remembered.

I notice a slight hop aroma that would seem to have a floral accent. The flavor is very good as well, the chocolate that was identified in the nose comes out nicely in the flavor as well and seems to give a slight sweet flavor. Also what I had identified as roasted malts seem to be a little more harsh in the flavor, slight astringency comes out but is welcome. The feel of this brew is creamy at the start but finishes somewhat dry. Slight hop finish to this brew which seems to be in proportion of what I expected from this brew.

3.97,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Although a touch chocolatey in both the aroma and flavor, Harpoon's Munich style Dark is still a fairly good representation of the style. It pours a clear deep-mahogany robe beneath its frothy, short-lived tan head. The nose is chocolatey, doughy, and hung with notes of floral hops. The mouthfeel is smooth and sublimely creamy with a medium body and delicate, fine-bubbled, moderate carbonation. The flavor focuses on malt character, and it's well balanced with just enough bitterness and grassy and floral hops to balance its dark malty edge. Soft chocolate, fudge, cocoa, brown sugar, tootsie-rolls, unsweetened chocolate cookie dough, and deeply caramelized, almost-burnt sugar all appear at some point, and there's even a bit of toastiness to it as well... yet for all of that, it's mostly restrained and focused on one chocolate-tinged malty center. Grassy and floral hops step in at late-mid palate and help the bitterness pull it away from achieving any real "chocolate" or "sweetness"; and it finishes just as clean, short, and dry as it's supposed to - leaving you ready for another sip. Drinkable! There's just enough flavor and complexity here to keep you coming back again and again without overwhelming you. Very nicely done!","NeroFiddled","Jan 31, 2007"

Dark Munich and Chocolate malt in the aroma, as well as distant noble floral hops, and a background raisny-malt scent. Dark Munich malt is strong upfront, followed by mellow Carafa II and a faint hop character that falls a little short. Roasted notes and a blank hop bitterness dry the aftertaste, while some raisiny malt/ale fruitness lingers. Light-medium both in body and carbonation, the mouthfeel is smooth and rich with enough malt charcter to intise then be washed away in a drying aftertaste despite the lack of hop profile. Fnishes semi-residual with a roasted nut flavor balancing the dark caramel taste of the Munich malt. I would like this beer much more as a flawed Munich Dunkel, rather than a strange Brown ale. Perhaps Harpoon will change the yeast.","PBRstreetgang","Jan 30, 2007"

In my experience Germany has better examples of the former, and I'd take Brooklyn's brown or the nut brown offerings from Rogue and Dogfish Head over this given the chance.

Starts off with a creamy smooth sweetness before roughing up the palette with a roasty coffee bitterness that washes the tongue well.

This was one of the days I wish I lived in a state that sold by six-packs;should have paid more and selected that case of Ayinger instead. Head was non-apparent, flavor was not bold as a dark should represent, particually weak on malt. Taste and moutheel can best be summed up as weak and watery. As you may have detected I'm upset that I bought a case of this beer. I've been pleased with Harpoon in the past, but am very dissapointed with this beer.

It has a light crystal malt/Munich malt aroma that is good, but nothing special. It is a bit fruity and malty sweet. The taste is good. It is smooth and full of sweet malty flavor. It goes down easy with a dry finish. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This beer drinks well. It's full of sweetness and has a smooth, semi-light feel.","WesWes","May 17, 2004"

The taste was lightly sweet and malty with a touch of licorice. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium body and low carbonation and a tangy aftertaste. This was a nice ale on cask.","UncleJimbo","May 16, 2004"
4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"This is a good tasting beer. Pours a brown or dark amber color with a light brown head. Smell is made up of caramel like malt and some sweetness also. Roasted malt and sweet caramel taste is offset by a crisp hop bitterness. Also has some dried fruit flavors in the background. This is flavorful, roasty and crisp, but not too heavy.","yeagerbm","May 08, 2004"

This style has always seemed like a crossover between domestic swill and real craft beer...kinda like the stuff your friends drank in college to be sophisticated. (e.g-Heiny Dark, Leiny, or St.Pauli Girl Dark). Not bad, but something I'm thoroughly not interested in ever drinking again.","Mitchster","Mar 31, 2004"

Aromatics are fruity and a touch cheesy-in the blue cheese vein.some melted chocolate aromas come to mind as well. The beer is medium bodied, malt driven and nicely bitter as it finishes. Flavors are also in a fruity vein and blue cheesy as well. Gosh darned it, this would be nice with a hot dog, only a sausage in the bun, and make that sausage something gamey, like venison or duck, and top it with a blue cheese sauce. Make sure the sausage contains some type of fruit. Never review when hungry!","moulefrite","Jan 31, 2004"
3,-21.1,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,"This one showed up in the December Beer of the Month Club shipment. Haven't really seen it in many stores here in NC, so it was a bit of a pleasant surprise. Pours a deep reddish brown hue (also translucent) with a thick, off-white foamy head. Deep malty nose, with hints of chocolate, molasses, and toffee. Rich, roasted malt flavor with a touch of sweetness. Light hop bitterness emerges mid-palate that builds into a fairly bitter finish. Unlike other dunkels I've had, perhaps because it's a top-fermented ale. Interesting, but I'm not sure I like it.","ElGordo","Jan 12, 2004"
3.5,-7.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Definitely an interesting beer. Its not often you come across a munich style dunkel thats an ale as opposed to lager, but none the less, tasty.

3.64,-4.2,3,4,3.5,3,4,"Dark brown color. Large white foamy head. Aroma is coffee and toffee. A medium bodied Dunkel. Malts are nutty, chocolate and sweet. Hops are grapefruity.

Aftertaste is slightly sweet.","beerguy101","Jan 02, 2004"
4.09,7.6,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Clear but very dark brown with olive highlights. Good head on the beer, 1/4 inch of persistant quality foam. Dotty, dripping laces. Aroma is nice, smells of a light cocoa and lots of fleshy ripe peach-like fruit. The main taste impression starts with chocolate, but with a smoky and roasty quality. A bit of fade in the mouthfeel mid-mouth to close, but an interesting combination of roast and bitter to wrap things up. Nice brew here, big aroma helps the overall tone of things. Thanks to Liza P. and her dad for getting it, and Ken K. for bringing it back.","ADR","Dec 30, 2003"
4.05,6.6,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Tralucent deep garnet. Thick, stiff, dense and dogged beige head. Steadfast, intricate lace remains. Soft cocoa with herbal hop hints upfront in aroma, followed by notes of deeply toasted malt and black licorice. Stately and welcoming aromawise. Snap of burnt grain bitterness initially in flavor is quickly tapered by gentle dark toffee sweetness and subtle, nutty carob. Hop bitterness is appropriately mild, leaving the static dark chocolate and toasty Munich foundation unhindered. Becomes agreeably savory late, with hints of salted, grainy biscuit providing contrast to malt sweetness. Well attenuated and perhaps a notch shy in dextrins, with a lanky and lightly viscous mouthfeel. Finishes mostly clean and dry, with hints of spicy hop and burnt cookie. A well rounded and tasty brew, with refined malt and hop balance. Simple in overall character and superbly drinkable.","marc77","Dec 15, 2003"
3.68,-3.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a deep chestnut, with a large tan head that mostly recedes, leaving sheets of lace. Aroma is of dark roasty malts, backed with a slight fruitiness and a mild hoppiness.

Caramel and chocolate on the nose. Mouthfeel not as rich and creamy as I expected, being somewhat light bodied. Taste is crisply balanced with a dry finish. Astringent aftertaste distracts from drinkability. Middle of the road, overall, for this style.","merlin48","Dec 05, 2003"

4.1,7.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This beer poured a dark caramel / wood colored that was crystal clear and decently carbonated. It produced a dark beige/tan colored head that was thick, sticky well lasting. There was some sticky / chunky lace left behind. The aromas were of toasted grains, dark malts, roasted malt, some light fruit present and hints of alcohol became as it warmed. Fresh and clean. The flavors that came through were of roasted malts, and burnt caramel, nuts (toasted), touches of coffee, earthy tones, grains (toasted), hops, sweet dark fruits, and at the end hints of alcohol. The aftertaste is of toasted grains and some sweetness. Medium bodied. Sweet, dry and complex. Great flavors of malts come out in this beer, while mixing in other flavors like hops and sweet fruit. A really good beer that as it warmed it got more complex and better.","Jarod","Sep 02, 2003"

3.8,0,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"At the brewery: Typical looking dark german beer with a wee small tan head of foam. Aroma of roasted malt with a slight sweetness. Something was different about this beer and I found out afterwards that they ferment this as an ale instead of the traditional lager. I think this really changes the character a bit. Not as sweet as the German Dunkels in my opinion. Medium bodied and malty. Pretty decent beer that I enjoyed.","BierReise","Aug 07, 2003"
3.13,-17.6,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Arrives looking sort of an ochre brownish color, with a thick almond colored head. Nice and clear, with a semi roasty malty aroma. Some hopping is apparent, but it's mostly smelling like a brown ale, or some kind of dark ale. Flavor is malty, a little grainy, with some fruity esteriness. A touch of roasted and chocolate malt, and some plum and apple flavors. Hops lend a mild bite and dryness to the finish, very downplayed, and works well with the malting. Sort of uncomplex, simple, definitely good, but not really the most interesting beer. Flavors aren't the cleanest and don't stand out from each other. That's fine, because not all of beer's pleasures are masterpieces of a brewers art, ya know?","UnionMade","Jul 22, 2003"

3.5,-7.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Well my last review of Harpoon was pretty scathing, so when a (free) sample of this popped up, I was initially skeptical, and then pleasantly surprised. This, along with their Oktoberfest, is the best thing they offer (which is strange, in that it means their strong suit is brewing fake German-lager-style ales). Anyway this is a nice, roasty dark ale with definite dunkel qualities. Caramel, nuts, a vague hint of chocolate, alongside some more fruity ale characteristics. It's an unusual marriage but it just about works, especially with the additional twist of spicy hops. Those reviewers below who said to let it warm up are right on. This went nicely with ribs. I would definitely turn to this again if I was craving a German dunkel and this was all that was available. Otherwise it is a strange, but quaffable, hybrid of a dunkel and a brown ale.","Thrasher","May 28, 2003"
