"Rich caramel & toffee, a little nutty. Well balanced and sweet."

"Overall: This beer just feels a bit lacking to me. Definitely not the best example of a Munich Dunkel that I've had, and one that could benefit from slightly more assertive flavors. Still, not a bad beer, but one that drinks more like an American Amber Lager than a Munich Dunkel."

"Full body for style and a nice lager smoothness."

"Outstanding reddish amber thick cap of tawny foam and sheets of lace. Smells earthy, malty slightly floral. Taste is caramel malt, biscuits, clean, crisp. Mouthfeel is smooth, well crafted with good heft of body. Obviously this is a well crafted lager with some skill and thought. I enjoyed it."

"Pours a clear reddish-brown with a foamy bone head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, caramel, and fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some solid aromas and flavors."

"Light bodied with typical lager high CO2. Easy to drink brew with some decent malty cereal flavor with a hint of toastiness."

"Overall: Surly has done a good job with a style that is mostly ignored on these shores."
""

"Overall: A very good take on a Dunkel lager. Nice dark roasted flavors that blend well together."

"Inky black. Malty roasted aroma. Coffee notes, very smooth maltiness, the skill in brewing such a beer is the exceedingly perfect smoothly perfect drinkability. The ultimate session beer, expert brewing."
"Passed over to me with a finger of deep-tan head with good retention. Color was a very pretty ruby red with NE-quality clarity. Nose was slightly sweet with a chocolaty aspect to it. Mouthfeel was medium with a chocolaty, smoky taste on the tongue. This from a lager!?! Wow, color me impressed. Finish had a chocolate flavor with a slight sourness, leaving it moderately dry. What a find!"
"Overall: Despite the mild aroma and slightly too sweet body, this is pretty damn good for a Dunkel. While not my favorite Surly by a long shot, I have to appreciate what they have accomplished here."
"O- Easy drinking beer, well balanced and smooth, great sessional beer, nice coffee and malt notes, with some nice hops added in. Solid beer but would not rank among my top favorites from Surly."
"Finally got to try the Schadenfreude at the Hanger Room. It's not as in-your-face as most Surly brews, but still is well-made and tasty for what it is. A nice compliment to Surly Hell."
"A very solid beer. Dominated by the malts, as it should be, but with nice rich flavors and good balance."
"O. I would try this again any chance given. It would make a great session beer if it was ever bottled. I feel as though the ABV may be a bit higher though. (shhh it's our secret)"
"Overall, a very flavorful dunkel. I like the coffee roast. Pretty drinkable as well. Good beer all around. I could drink a few pints of this."
"This beer arrives a dark brown almost black color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of toffee, bread, and a hint of cocoa. The taste is fuller than the aroma with a lot of toffee and bready malt, some cocoa powder, and a hint of wood. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a good beer that I would drink again."
"Overall -- Not bad at all. Wouldn't put it high on my list of favorite Surly beers, but it's always a treat to try one of their beers, especially a lager."
"D - Very drinkable brew. Medium bodied, easy going down. A for sure brew to session but too bad that it is only found on tap! Another great brew from Surly and I recommend having it when you can"
"Drinkability: An easy one to session with and a lot of flavor, but very easy to drink and smooth. Another winner from Surly."
"O- Went in on this one not having a clue what to expect. I really enjoyed drinking this pint."
"Draft at Stub & Herbs. Poured into a pint glass a dark brown color with a ever so slight head. What head there is collars around the rim of the glass a light tan color. I would have liked more head but it seems the bartender wanted to fill it to the brim! The aroma is actually quite mild with notes of light roast coffee. Medium mouthfeel. I would guess this uses maris otter barley given the appearance and aroma. Medium mouthfeel. Starts off with a very slight dark fruit flavor, a touch nuttiness, and the aforementioned light roast notes. Sweetness sticks around the whole time. Mild bitterness. Some caramel flavors as well as it warms up a touch. VERY easy drinking. Like."
"Notes: My first Surly looks like one that is limited, on tap only. Leave it to the superb Bavarian Lodge in Lisle, IL to offer it, a great, great place to drink beer."
"Drinkability: I could have several of these--and would have if I did not get in right before the keg kicked. I love the slight oaking. This beer is super smooth."
"Drinkability:I really enjoyed this beer, it's very drinkable, and goes great with food. I'm not sure it's exactly spot-on in terms of style though. I think it could have benefited from more complexity."
" D- This beer has some nice flavors and a good richness. It is drinkable but it would be nice to have a little more depth or support to the dark toasted malt bill."
"D: the drinkability couldn't be much better. Lots of flavor with a nice light body and a nearly sessionable ABV. Surly seems to do the high flavor low alcohol thing very well."
"M & D: very good"
"D - All but undrinkable. I usually like Surly products, but this one really misses the mark."
"D - Pretty easy to get down, and could do it again. Don't think I could make it a session beer, but it was an enjoyable drink that I wouldn't mind having again."
"D: Overall another good beer from the folks at Surly. Lighter bodied with a full flavor makes this one both sessionable and great with food. And while this is not my preferred style of beer, I enjoyed this one thoroughly. Oddly, I felt this one had more smoke character than Surly's Smoke."
"O: I hope this ends up as a canned offering because it's delicious and drinkable. I've maybe only had one other dunkel lager so I'm not quite versed in the style but whether or not this is very traditional, it's damn good."
"Very drinkable, would love to try this again."
"This one where one pint begs for another, an excellent session choice. I actually find myself not yearning for a hoppier brew, or one stronger in alcohol...although I'll probably have one of those, anyway...knowing me, as I do."
"Drinkability- Very easy drinking, inoffensive beer. Not all that flavorful and for my $ I'd much rather have mild (same sort of profile, loosely). I just need bigger flavors and a Dunkel Lager just doesn't do it for me. Glad I got to try though!"
"I has this on tap at Local option into a tulip. The beer is dark brown with lots of amber highlights, fairly clear. Not much head or retention to comment on. The aroma is light, bready with roasted malts. The taste is ok nothing special, a light smoke finish that is nice. Easy to drink but not much feel, kinda boring so probably wouldn't want more than one."
"D: Very drinkable, but I think I would rather have the Surly Mild."
"Very nice, refreshing and overly drinkable. Large amounts of moderately sweet, creamy, earthy malts, chocolate and yeasty flavors. Endless drinking possibilities."
"Aroma was slightly sweet, toasted malt and tobacco leaf that also came through in the taste. Aftertaste had some residual earthy hops that were only mildly bitter after a good quaff. The dark malts were on showcase, there was a hint of maple sweetness also. Feel was light, it was easily worth having a couple pints of. Overall it was clean and fairly subdued, though enjoyable."
"D - I drank a pint during an inning of the Cubs-Braves game. Other than the somewhat harsh carbonation this was pretty easy to drink. A nice dunkel lager, similar to Denison's but with a less potent nose."
