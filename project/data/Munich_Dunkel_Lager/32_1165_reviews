"I was looking for a brown ale and this was as close as my local store had. mahogany color. roasty smell. while drinking it, someone next to me asked if anyone else smelled skunk. but it wasn't skunky. good carbonation. I'd buy again if I couldnt find other darker beers."

"Overall (2.83) : If Beck's Premium Lager didn't scare me away from the brewer, this one did. This very well may be my last Beck's beer I ever try. These guys are horrible. Whether you look at it as a dark ale or look at it as a ""Dunkel", it's a fail either way. I've had both styles, neither of which this beer represents. It's burnt, sour, earthy, and bitter. Just blech. What's even worse is that it's really the definition of mediocre."

"O: This is OK, it is not the most impressive beer in the world but there is no need to disparage it.  It satisfies one's desire for a darker beer and certainly can fill the need for roasted flavors.  I felt it was not as malty as I would have preferred.  Drinkable, I would say nothing to write home about but I am writing about it so go figure."

"Slightly better than regular Becks. If you want a light beer with actual taste, this isn't a bad choice."

"nice Munich Dunkel ready available and price right, a little blunt for my taste, sour and harsher than my favorites"

"Pours a very dark amber in color with a lighter tan head that dissipates quickly that leaves some lacing when sipped but not much. Smells and tastes different to what I remember back in the '80's and early '90's even. Aroma is of roasted malts with a hint of brown sugar. Taste is on the weak side and not like I really remember. Overall, disappointed."

"O: I guess Beck's Dark isn't as offensive as it gets, but it's definitely not as good as it could be. There's definitely some good qualities to this brew, but not enough to outweigh the bad qualities. I wouldn't call it offensive, but it's definitely something to stay away from if there's other options."

" Since InBev domesticated it, it's turned into two-dimensional swill. Budweiser with a darker hue and different packaging. I gave the new stuff several chances in recent months, and for a period of time, I was able to compare it head to head with some of the older German-made stock some stores still had in inventory. It's been uniformly disappointing to the point I've given up entirely on it in search of a replacement. I guess they do this because the economics work - shave every production corner you can and drive up margins. It doesn't work for me. I don't drink a lot, so when I do, I want quality, and I'd rather pay a few bucks more if that's what it takes to keep a product authentic and good."

"DATE TASTED: October 12, 2013 ... GLASSWARE: Warsteiner pokal... OCCASION: celebrating PSU's unBILLeivable comeback against Michigan--and my son's fifth birthday... APPEARANCE: ""dark"" velvet black as night body with a brownish roadside snake-colored head; lacing is nonexistent, with a random streak or spot... AROMA: classic Beck's ping/tang hops with a doughy funky roundness; a ""dirtier"" version of the pilsner...PALATE: slick and oily; lightly bodied with subtle activity at the teeth...TASTE: bready, doughy and slightly malty; light hops do not really add balance or memorability...OVERALL: on the plus side, sessionable and autumnal; on the negative, almost indistinguishable from the Oktoberfest, save the presence of extra doughy malts..."

"Very good from the glass, and okay from the bottle. I was expecting it to be stronger but it is very drinkable. Color obviously dark brown and a decent head, taste very similar to the heineken with less cream feel. Very malty and light roast characteristics. Excellent session beer imo."

"O: Overall this is not a great beer but not disgusting in any way, just kind of average for me . If given any BMC or this would take this anyday at least this has a taste to it and some flavor."

"Pours a clear dark reddish-brown with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film that eventually disappear completely. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt, caramel, and a skunky aroma that I can only attribute to the green bottle. Taste is tart with dark malt, caramel, and a slight soy sauce flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer with some weird aromas and flavors that don't make it pleasant to drink."

"What the hell happened??? This used to be my favorite/ go to beer. I bought it by the case all the time. Never again! This now I guess was bought out by AB and is now brewed in St. Louis. Something is very wrong. It tasted funky, watered down and undrinkable. Thanks AB for ruining another brand. Next time you buy a brewery just leave it alone!!! I will never forgive you for Rolling Rock or Becks Your beer is bad enough. Stop buying good breweries and ruining them!!!"

"Pretty average brew. Not really sure how this one compares to the rest of the Beck's family since I haven't had any others. I'd take this over just about any BMC lager, but I'd still be looking for something else first."

"This is a nicely, sessionable beer with decent flavor. It's simplistic and a bit sweet. The musty aroma is off putting. I probably won't buy this beer again, but it was nice once."

"After drinking a regular Beck's this is quite a step up, but I guess making a average beer is way better than making a crap one."

"Serving type: bottle"

"This is a bland mass produced European beer which means that it is maybe a step above AALs."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty easy to drink and well balanced - enjoyable but nothing that stands out. Could easily be a sessionable beer."
"O: This beer is very easy to drink compared to other beers in the style but is also a lot lighter-bodied and not quite as flavorful."
""
""
""
"Perhaps an average job from one of the big boys, but it could be so much better."
""
""
"Overall, if I'm going to pound some beers for a sporting event, I'd drink this over Beck's Lager. That's about it. There are far more better options for dunkels and whatnot. I'm not regretting buying it, it served it's purpose."

"Pours a nice copperish-brown with excellent head and very nice lacing throughout. Decent scent, a bit of roastiness, a lot of jerkiness and some earthiness; not very deep and malty or roasty, nor as spicy as most German brews are. Good flavors, with some nice roastiness over a decently sweet maltiness and a nice slight earthy finish. Goes down incredibly smooth, by far this beer's best attribute. If you're looking for something to get someone started on a bit of a darker beer/lager, this would be a good choice to go up to, without shocking their system."
""
""
""
"Overall: Good for occasional drinkers who enjoy AALs, because it really reminds me more of an AAL than a dark beer. Not what I was expecting, and not very flavorful at all."

"O- Not the worst brew I've had, but there is definitely better product out there. The best way I can put this is that this is a macro version of a specialized style and it is too mild and not refined enough to warrant anything other than calling this average. I won't go out of my way for this one again, but if ever I have the chance to try it again, I'll do so...."

"The normal Beck's has been on sale so long by me that I got this darker cousin in my head. Dammit. Anyway, it pours a dark, clear garnet-russet topped by a short-lived finger of dusty off-tan foam. The nose comprises corn, light musty wheat, and the faintest possible touch of toasted caramel. Something tells me I'm lucky everything's faint, as it might just be offensive if more perceptible. The taste holds notes of mild char, light toasted caramel, hard water, vinyl, grass, and rice. The body is a hefty light, with a moderate carbonation, a watery feel, and a sorta drying finish. Overall, a pretty sad beer, frankly. I compare it to one of those sticky regulars on the pole during Amateur Night at the stripclub: I don't necessarily mind looking at it, but anything involving my nose or tongue just ain't for me..."

"No malt in the body or taste, no real flavor and not even close to a Dunkel. It is just a darker colored Beck's. Stay away."
"Overall Drinkability - This beer is overwhelmingly metallic, bitter, astringent and acidic. I consider all these to be off characters, and this is particularly bad when the beer is otherwise dull, mild or flavorless. All bad characters, not much in the way of good ones past the appearance. This would definitely be a drain pour if it wasn't for the fact that I'd at least like getting a buzz in return for tasting this beer."
"Overall: Very drinkable. It won't shoot you to the moon, but it won't disappoint."
"From the green bottle marke 04.2012-L10914N. Sampled on October 29, 2011. It pours a dark mahogany brown with a thin but lingering head. The aroma goes to the malts more than anything else with a drop of toffee. Those aromas remain constant throughout. The body is thin. The taste is on the bland side with a noted maltiness and sugar in the raw. Low bitterness. This is a beer I drank a lot in the 1980's thinking it was something special. My how my tastes have changed."
"Becks Dark wasnt as good as I hoped it was going to be. The regular Becks is much better. The beer poured a dark amber, not quite opaque, had a ecru head, which did not lace. The smell has sweet malt and slight roast. The taste was standard dunkel...grain, sweet malt, with some hop balance. Mouthfeel was ok, medium to light body with ok carbonation. Overall if your a dunkel fan you should try it...if not dont bother."
"overall this beer might be pleasant were it bottled in brown bottles. i suppose ill have to post a revision of this beer when i find it on draft..."
"M: The ending is with good lasting but not to pleasant."
"had this at the in -laws..drank it straight from the bottle,,smell was malt and dark toffee with some hop and chocolate ,taste was much the same roasted malts and hops ,grain and bread;good carbonation with a medium mouthfeel,,was really not that bad as i was not expecting much.."
"Brown in color with an a smell that is to much like the becks lager. Taste, well, slight hint of roasted flavor. After that it is lacking. Feel on the mouth is clean finish. If you never had a dark beer this would be a good start. Not a dark beer we are use to drinking."
"Overall – I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. It doesn't really taste all that much like a dark beer.. but the taste is well balanced and it was very drinkable. It's better than the beck's regular for sure."
"Pours a darker brown color that is rather flat with not much carbonation or head to it. The scent is slightly heavier than a cheap adjuct lager but not by much. The taste is rather light for being a dark colored beer. It's basically a light colored German pilsner with a dark brown color added. Drinks rather smooth and easily as it has almost the same texture as water. Some grassy, cheap wheat taste stand out. Not too taste to emplore here but at least it's drinkable!"
"This beer is extremely tasty, even during the summer when most sensible people are drinking pale ale or lighter colored lager."
"O: Very easy going beer. Not a lot going on. Easy way for someone to venture into the Dark Side. Almost like drinking Coca-Cola."
"Overall- Good beer overall but was looking for a Dark Lager. I was hoping it was going to have more body to it. Very enjoyable, good drinkability, but fell short as an average beer to me."
"O - I didn't like this one. The nose was a little deceiving seeing is that the rest of the beer was sub-par. Don't waste your time and money on this one."
"Ordered a bottle of this during a lunch break from class at Nick's Pizza in Bethlehem Pa. The color is a nice dark brown, the aroma has the same skunk as the Pilsner, the flavor is bitter, a little burnt and some caramel. Mouthfeel is a little on the light side, not thick at all. It's a decent beer, better than the Pilsner in my opinion."
"Finish: Grassiness with the skunk note that lingers"
"D- Sits somewhat heavy. Leaves you relatively full."
"From notes at Old Chicago (2002: Pours cola-esque into the glass. Mine had almost no head nor lacing. Aromas are somewhat sour and hops. The body of this beer grows/builds through the finish, as initial flavors are a bit dry. I pick up lightly roasted notes, with increasing bitterness. Hops continue in the finish even after the pull has concluded. Honestly, since the brew doesn't come to fruition until much later, the body initially feel thin, due to a (possible) overcarbonated, watery contingency. Thus, this leaves a highly mediocre impression. Not terrible, but overall, just middle of the road."
"D= very drinkable in session or single."
"Flavor is slightly bitter and skunky, but certainly not bad. Decent and quite drinkable, but not one I'd repurchase."
"RJT"
"Notes: I enjoyed this beer. Seems like a decent, reliable brew good. I would buy it again."
"D- Watery, boring beer."
"Bottle. Pours dark brown with a fluffy, off- white head, a lot of lacing. Regular grassy aroma of European macro with some hints of toasted malt. Light-medium body. Taste is of burnt malt and some unpleasant bitterness (I'm curious what are they using instead of hops). Long, bitter finish. At least I did not buy it."
"I didn't like it"
"drinkable for sure, easy to session, but i would pick so many more beers over this for the price. i prolly wont buy this again."
"I poured this from a 12 oz bottle into a Mass Krug. Clear freshness date of JUL 2011 is given on the back. It poured out with a deep brown color and a 3/8 inch head that sticks around. Carbonation is present but minimal. It smells like toasted malt and grassy hops, overall balanced between the two. Sweet grainy malt, with toasted caramel malts, and a grassy hop back. More malty than hoppy by a 60/40 margin. Not bad but simple. Mouthfeel is thin carbonation is there but does not obstruct the easy swilling of this beer creating remarkable drinkability. This beer hits all the notes of what a Dunkel should be, easy gulping sociable beer that can be drunk by the liter. Solid beer correct to style."
"Mouthfeel medium bodied, spritzy, and mildly bitey."
"Cheers!"
"I've had an odd craving for a dark lager lately so I couldn't resist an $11 12-pack of Beck's Dark. Poured at first in a glass stein to observe color and head formation and then a ceramic stein for drinking. (There's something about a ceramic stein that enhances the mouthfeel of the German lagers.) Pours brown with oodles of foam that forms a somewhat rocky head that sadly drops to nothing eventually. Smells a bit like burnt caramel and roasted grain. The aroma is by no means overpowering, but it is also not weak. Tastes of wet malt, touch burnt grains, a hint of toffee with some acceptable hop bitterness for the style. Mouthfeel falls short of creamy and ends up coming across a bit watery, but this is beer meant to quaff or chug, not to sip."
"an easy drinker for sure and fits the style. not a great beer by any means, but good enough to drink if it's around."
"Drinkability - Not too bad for a darker beer from Becks. I'm not of a fan of their pilsener, but this style I like better. Not very fulfilling in terms of taste complexity, but the taste isn't bad, and the aftertaste not too strong. Easy enough to come back to."
"D...It goes great with a steak and probably other red meats, i'll try it with a medium rare burger next."
"Drinkability: Very average taste makes it bearable when superior choices are unavailable."
"D- this is a decent session beer, and if you're looking for a beck's/heiniken/amstel type beer, this is actually not a bad choice. all in all, it just didn't do it for me."
"Drinkability: A pretty boring lager. I definitely wouldn't pay for this again. There are much better beers for the price."
"Drinkability: This beer is largely unimpressive- not terrible, but nothing I would try to have again."
"Not my favorite, sorry mom. Happy Mother's Day anyway!"
"When poured the color was a dark amber with very little light tan foam and no lace. The smell had a hint of roasted malts and hop's. The taste had a nice balance of bitter/sweetness for a German Lager. This was a pleasent surprise for a mass produced German Lager!"
"drinkable because nothing is very intense. kind of bland if you dont think about it much."
"M/D: Very drinkable since it isn't the heaviest dark lager, but I'm not a huge fan of this one... purely average."
"Poured from a green 24 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is overwhelmingly of malts. Taste is good, lots of malts with a hint of caramel, finishing slightly bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"I once played in a band with a guy whose favorite band was the Rolling Stones and whose favorite beer was Beck's Dark. Well, he was killed in 1995 when a bomb went off in downtown OKC. Anyways,Steve, my brother, I'm listenin' to ""Gimme Shelter"" and drinkin a Becks Dark. This one's for you. Love ya."
"I bought this single so that I could taste this again, since its been years. It will be years again. Many Many"
"On to the next one here... Glad I got to try it but I won't be going back..."
"this is still better than most any everyday american corporate brew, but still a tepid pour that foams up a little, looks nice and dark and goes flat very fast. looks like flat pepsi. a slight malty/bready nose that poofs away quickly. tastes crisp for a split second and it's drinkable. ok mouthfeel. flat fast. nothing keeps it crisp. but this is drinkable enough and i can't say it tastes bad. it's just not impressive. so many better choices out there. i bought this because it was 1.99 for a 24 oz. bomber. something to drink on the way home while i carried the treasure box of much better brews from more impressive breweries. onwards..."
"Drinkability: quite nice. It's lager-lightness makes it refreshing and its darkness makes it somewhat more complex and interesting than a normal lager. It reminds me of Negra Modelo; I'm sure it would go great with Mexican food."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was black as it should be and poured a big head. The beer was a nice mahogany color. The beer was skunky smelling as most Becks are. Taste was green like just about every beer like this, kinda Heiny tasting or like a St. Pauli Girl IO will not buy again."
"D: There are worse beers out there, but this is pretty pedestrian. Metallic, musty, and yes, a bit skunky. The mouthfeel is also somewhat laborious unfortunately."
"- Fort a cheap (cost has NOTHING to do w/ my score) dark pilsner mass German brew... this one has got to be a favorite. If you want a buzz... avoid it, it's light... if you want a fine dark lager-pilsner... you have a winner! For the style, and taste... and beauty.. there you have it!"
"The nose is toasted grains, some sweetish malts, some overly processed aromas too. The taste is quite a bit more dry, slightly hoppier than I remembered it. There is an astringent, slightly nutty, slightly roasted taste, maybe some charring is in there too. The beer falls down in that it has a very overly processed, adjunct feel to it, maybe indicative of something cheaply made. The beer is light enough, but not watery, it is light to medium bodied, but not thin in consistency. The mouthfeel is a touch oily, the aftertaste is very slight."
"D- I could see a fresh case of this being fairly drinkable over a session. It's not too heavy, has a little bit of character, but overall is pretty average. Looks good in a glass, though."
"D- Overall this is a decent beer but nothing special. I don't think I would purchase again."
"Stuck in a bar with Bud/Miller/Coors, plus this. So I give it a try. Color is a dark amber with a bit of a tan head. Smells of herbs and grass, similar to Heiniken, except not as good. Tastes of herbs and licorice, not a very agreeable flavor, really. Sort of like Heiniken except mixed with licorice and then watered down. Carbonation was fine, but this beer really isn't happening."
"Goes down easy and is quite sessionable."
"D- an easy drinkin dark one, and a great beer to use for cooking as its all around character plays nicely to things that necessitate a flavorful liquid (namely cooking wursts) although i've used it all across the board of german cuisine due to its availability and affordability. point is, i never have a problem drinking what i don't put in the pot."
"D- When I started drinking this was my go to brew. When I moved to Guinness and other stouts this remained my main session brew. Still have a soft spot for it and have one every once in a while for old times sake."
"D- Overall this beer is not bad, I think my brats will be happy cooking in this. Could be a little bit more complex but overall a decent beer."
"D - Good drinkability save for the gross mineral water flavor. Otherwise a solid dark session beer."
"Drinkability: Not recommended at all. Particularly loathsome metallic taste, like tonguing the return coin slot on an old, used vending machine. It's like a cow's eyeball in my soup, I just can't appreciate any other qualities when I this glaring fault staring back at me. Ugh."
"Drinkability: Nothing outstanding, but nothing offensive. It's something I could drink again."
"D: Pretty easy to drink, low ABV. Not much happening here with this beer, a better option than most macro beers."
"Bottom Line: Not a real character, but a steady beer. I haven't had much in this style, but I would drink it again. Just wish I had one that was better cared for."
"Not bad, but definitely not up there with some other dark lagers I've had."
"From a 24 ounce bottle. Best by date July 2009. Pours clear dark brown with a one finger light tan head. Minor lacings. Aroma is pleasant floral hops and caramel. Taste is initially sweet molasses. The flavors are more hoppy and less sweet as the beer recedes. The malt also improves in character. Nice dark roast flavors come forward. Good mouthfeel once some of the carbonation subsides. Drinkability is quite good due in part to the 4.8% abv. Nice no fault beer that would best accompany a meal. Medium dry finish with a lingering bitterness."
"This beer had some ups and some downs. Pours dark, dark, brown. Clear, with slightly creamy off-white head. Very cola-like in appearance. Smell wasnt too bad. Nice caramel tones with some raisin and sweet malt. Taste was just bland I thought. Some caramel, some toasted grain, but overall just not much of anything. Mouthfeel was light and refreshing, high carbonation. Overall a drinkable beer. A good session beer and could be a good one to ease people into ""better beer."""
"It was very drinkable. I had not had a Beck's Dark for several years. I was not impressed during my last experience but I am beginning to think that I had a bad bottle back then. I would recommend trying this, or trying it again from a different source."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a dark copper color with good clarity and rising carbonation. The head was off-white, the retention and lacing good. The aroma was of some floral hops mixed with dry grains, rather generic. The flavors were super dry and bitter in a grainy way. The malt was clearly toasted but it lacked balancing hops. Similar in every way to a slightly 'darker' version of standard Beck's; easy to imagine and simple to drink. The mouthfeel was rough due to the prickly, high levels of carbonation. The body was medium. An average offering."
"D- easy to throw these back. a poor session beer. Notm uch flavor and not too enticing but a decent brew."
"D: probably will never buy this again. Not horrible, but struggling to hit average for me. I would try it on draft...maybe"
"It has a good light tan head but not much of it. However this beer makes up for it in lace. It has a traditional grainy lager aroma more than a dark malty aroma. The aroma is malty just not as roasty and malty as one might think. It is also a little earthy. It has sweet taste first followed by a plastic and hops flavor. There are some tiny caramel tones in the flavor. It has a thin body and is easy to drink. It is an alright beer but I find it incredibly average."
"Overall: It is an okay beer. To me it lacks a malt complex."
"Notes from 12/16/05"
"D - This is an okay dunkel lager. Easy drinking and worth a try."
"Basic euro dunkel, rather drinkable but somewhat boring. Faint aroma, lightly skunked but cut with some decent caramel malt and very faint grassy hops. Average pour. Light and crisp, finish is a touch too bitter in an awkward way. Flavor is alright at best, not too much to explain other than some toasted notes and grassy, grainy malt."
"This style doesn't usually pack a lot of flavor, but this one seems to not have any at all. The standard notes are there, just turned down a lot."
"Superior to regular Beck's, Dark lays out a dense finger of slightly tan head with an amaretto drizzle over a mahogany body with ruby highlights, modest duration and a tease of lacing. Bready, malty aroma is subtle but pleasant. Fine malty taste with caramel, hints of cocoa, and a bit of ginger to complement the grassy hops taste. Quite good. Creamy, smooth, and nicely carbonated, Dark doesn't flatten. This is rather good, not a great Dark Lager but solid and well worth grabbing."
"Pours a deep brown, almost black with a small white head and mediocre lacing. The smell is strong and honeylike, with a clear bite of grain. The flavor is sweet and honeyish with a clear flavor of malt. There is a little hop bitterness in the back, but otherwise relatively little hop aroma or flavor. The mouthfeel is thin, with a sting of carbonation and a slight cling. The finish is nice - grainy and bitter. This is a remarkably drinkable beer."
"D: Above average drinkability and certainly nothing to complain about."
"Prosit, MK"
"MF&D - For around $7 a 6pk its not a bad choice, just don't expect to much and you won't be dissappointed."
"Not a bad beer for the run of the mill imports, has decent sessionability. Could definitly use a liitle boost but overall better than some alternatives."
"Nothing that I will look for again. First thing I noticed was the skunked aroma, not a great way to start the beer. Dark colored with a thin head and a little bit of lace. Fairly rich flavor but had a tiny, metallic finish. So basically, the aroma is pretty bad, and the finish tastes like metal. Since this smells like a skunk and is the color of one I think I'll stay away."
"Smells a tad bit skunky at first with some dark malts. Taste follows nose with slightly skunky, corn taste. Some maltyness and bread taste. Bubbles are present and a tad bit harsh. Not a bad beer, but not what I would look for normally. Finish is OK, but nothing to look forward to. Drinkable, but must be ice cold."
"D: Worse than water. Perhaps a session beer, but I'm not interested in not tasting a second one of these."
"D: This is a darker brew and advertised as such. However, like a some dark homebrews, it looks darker than it tastes. In this case, I was a bit disappointed with the lack of ""dark"" flavor. This is a dark looking brew that drinks like an amber."
"Poured a dark brown, cola like with a thin white head that stayed around. Aroma was definetly skunky as was as the taste. Quite a bit of metallic in the taste also. The texture was thin and light. Overall I was disappointed I thought I would be getting a little more. It seemed that it was a lager with food coloring added. Not recommended."
"Drinkability - This one is actually really drinkable for a beer that seems strongly carbonated. To each his own though. But I could down six of these in a couple hours. not a bad choice."
"Pours a Jewel brand cola color witha few ruby highlights. But a good film of foam hangs around for all twelve ounces of this beer. The aroma has a touch of stale coffee that then moves to a better defined roasted malt in lager form. But lets not forget the adjuncty smell there. But the taste has an almost, hot pot coffee taste from the local Denny's with the waitress who has the bum leg, to it. The dark malts are great, minus ther adjunt must to it. I can't really explain why, but this is one of my, ""right after a hard day of work while you wait for dinner to cook beer."" Easy on the palate and tastes good from the bottle and the glass."
"Hovever, this beer is very drinkable, I plowed through five of them before I knew it. I wouldn't recomend this beer if other dark lagers are available of better quality, but if you've never had one, it couldn't hurt to try one at a restaurant... or a party!"
"A nice clear brown, almost chocolate-dark and rather appetizing. Aroma is not strong but inviting, malty with a touch of apple or pear. Flavor is rather enjoyable, mainly malty with just a hint of hops, a whisper of sweetness, and some fruity taste. Finish is smooth and refreshing."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours dark brown with a small off-white head. It smells like sweet and dark malts, and also a little bit of hops, cooked veggies and some skunk too. The taste is a bit different that the aroma, I can taste some coffee, caramel and toasted malt, but there's also a little skunk in the taste too. But the good outweighs the bad in the taste, it is drinkable and it does taste better as the beer warms a bit. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium with low carbonation. Drinkability is decent, not great but not bad either. Overall it's an OK beer. I'd drink it again if there was nothing better available, but I wouldn't make a point to seek it out either."
"The taste follows the nose. Some noticeable hop bitterness up front with a weak, somewhat grainy malt presence. It's a bit too bitter for the amount of malt that hits my palate and overall, this one does not strike my fancy at all. One purchase is enough."
"A malty aroma, some breadiness, a little bit of hops and a faint spicy smell. A medium-bodied brew that has some crispness up front and is a little chewy. Some sweetness derived from the malt, although the malts are rather basic and not distinct. Not much in the hops department and while this beer goes down smooth with a little kick on the backbite it is not the most pleasant tasting. Better than other Beck's offerings, but I am not completely sold on this beer."
"Second beer I had at Cafeteria on Newbury. Poured from the bottle into a tapered beer glass. Very dark brown color, small white head. Smell was just a hint of roasted coffee. Tasted a bit like some dark chocolate. Very malty backbone, making this a thicker than expected beer on the palate. Actually not a bad beer from a larger brewer. I wish I saw this on more menus."
"One of the beers I keep on hand. Filled bottle looks brown, but it's green with nice golden foil neck. Beer in glass is moderate brown and pours with a bit of foam, with fairly thin character and lots of ""bubbles."" A hint of dark malt with yet a similar hint of Beck's typical ""veggie"" or fruity hops (though much less than regular Beck's). Taste is the same, though the malt comes through a bit more on the tongue. Slightly sweet (though not too much so) and extremely drinkable. Definitely not a craft-brewed Dunkel, nor one of the better Germans... But it's a great sidekick to food. Oh, and the brewery name is a nice touch."
"Pretty drinkable."
"Taste is a bit to thin and plain. Frankly I was disappointed in this drink. Easy to drink, but not one that I'd go out of my way to drink again."
"D: Absolutely drinkable. This beer is even better on tap and is a fine German beer. Far better than regular Becks. Don't know why this beer has a bad rap, it is good for the style."
"drinkability is decent. this is a munich dunkel lacking any real character. the brew comes out tasting like some malt, a touch of hops, and water. dissapointing."
"Another one of the make-your-own-six-pack dunkels I purchased. Had this chilled in a pub glass. Poured a nice crystal clear iced tea brown color with an alright head. Smelled of a little milk chocolate and toffee. The taste was a little disappointing. Very thin and not much balance, just a lot of malt and tiny hop undertones. It is pretty easy to drink but I have had better dunkels."
"very drinkable, small doses. I love to have a few of these around while at the camp fire."
"overall, a very nice example of the style.."
"What an awful beer. Note that I did check the ""Best By:"" date and it was 5-2008, this was not an old bottle."
"Drinkablity: A tasty and satisfying, widely available brew."
"Personally, I will avoid this beer."
"Overall - an ok dark beer with balanced taste. However, Warsteiner Dunkel is definitely a better catch. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy this, but if it's there, I'd have it with a pizza or something."
""
"D: I need to sample this one again...hopefully one that is not skunky. If this is the norm...ouch!!"
"Started promising with a beautiful appearance and decent aroma, but this ends up just being a dark Beck's - someone check for caramel coloring."
"Body and carbonation are good for the style.. IMHO.. Beck's dark is not as bad as the reviews signify.. I think that the brewery just found something that worked ... ""dark"" color and ""dark"" flavor without being offensive to the ""occasional"" dark/import drinker."
"D--Just doesn't taste like an effort was made in making this good. Just tastes dated, old. Like my grandfather keeping bottled beer for two years in the basement."
"For someone who likes dark beers, this was a big disappointment."
"Other: I noticed that overall it had rather low ratings. I would definately like to dry more of this style and then return to it to see if my higher opinions change. While there are sure to be plenty of better beers out there, it is a fairly easy beer to find and thus would make a good fall back beer in an emergency."
"I am quite surprised at the low rating this beer has. This is a very good dark beer. While a dark beer, it is quite light and crisp in flavor. The flavors hit almost every part of the tongue, not leaving any taste buds alone. The smell is refreshing, doesn't fall into the stale/musty trap that many dark beers have. May not be the tops of the best dark beer around, but one I find very good."
"Not amazing, but certainly not repulsive. Definitely one of the best of the widely-available corporate beers. In a pinch, you could do a lot worse."
"Thick, somewhat syrupy mouthfeel and poor carbonation. Not offensive in any way, but nothing that stands out. This is definitely a very, very average Eurolager."
"Body is fairly light, with hight carbonation and decent drinkability. Goes well with burgers."
"Mouthfeel is thin, carbonation went all crazy then vanished ... stay away."
"I may buy this one again for hanging out with the guys watching some hockey."
"A deep cola color brew with scant white head and even less signs of any lacing. The aroma is decent with a combination of coffee and chocolate and a touch of malt. The flavor is fairly consistent with the smell, bitter coffee malt with an overriding wash of charcoal. It's pretty acqueous, easy drinking and a bit fizzy. The taste is fine if you like that bitter side of the dark lagers, almost closer to a porter by my taste, but the feel is a bit more watery than I like. I liked these for years when I was younger and would still be satisfied to drink a few, but something is definitely missing in body that takes away from the flavor. Not bad, not great."
"D: Could definetly go for more. I'm finding a 24 oz. goes down pretty quickly. I've been drinking a lot of heavy beers lately and this is a good break from the norm. Slammin a sixer of these wouldnt be a problem on a Friday or Saturday night."
"D-I drink these all the time just not 20 at a sitting. The mood for a rich beer makes these taste better."
"Drinkable, but I'd rather not support the waste of importing this sub-par Dunkel."
"Drinkability was ok, not a big beer, it does not warm you, but it was nice for this setting."
"I used to love these beers when I didn't know what a Stone RIS was."
"Pours a dark brown color with a head that recedes fast. Some skunk in the nose but otherwise, quite malty for what it is. Taste is nice and malty with some fruitiness/skunk in the background. The aftertaste is similar to burnt coffee, which isn't a bad thing. Somewhat roasty as well. Not a bad interpretation of a style I've never had."
"It looks like cola when poured into a pint glass. Nothing really jumps out at you smell wise. Just smells like dark beer. Tastes good. Like roasted malt with a semi sweetness to it. I'm a fan of German dark beers. I like the low carbonation and lack of excessive ingredients. I would bet this beer may be a little better if it was bottled in a brown bottle instead of green. Sometimes these beers have a hint of skunkyness. It varies from six pack to six pack. I got a fresh batch, however, and I could drink these all night. And I think I will."
"It was a warm evening, and this beer served to refresh me. I don't have any real complaints, though I don't have any very strong, distinct impressions of the beer either. A nice, decent beer. Nothing more; nothing less."
"Becks Dark pours a dark brown color. It is clean with a beige head. The aroma and flavor are dark roasted malt, caramel, some hints of molasses, and a bit of the typical skunkiness. This beer is medium bodied with a smooth texture. Went okay with the steak I had at Outback."
"D: Drinkable, and there are far worse choices, but it's not good enough to keep me from moving to a better beer."
""
"Appearance is a dark brown with a frothy head that laces nicely. Aroma is light with roasted malts, coffee and caramel. Taste has a roasted malt, coffee and a light hop bite with a light - medium mouthfeel. I've bought this beer many times over the years, its Nothing special, but for the price it's just a good dark lager that I enjoy when wanting something different."
" Overall this was a nice little dark lager. Better then I expected. It was very light in feel and flavor, and served cold went down very easily. I think I like it better then the regular Becks, but I havent had one in a while to compare. Not a bad brew at all though, and would not have a problem having it around for a session or two."
"This does actually match the Dunkel style reasonably well. It's not a style I'm a great fan of, but it's drinkable."
"This is a very good dark beer. Much much better than its skunky green brother. If you like lagers/dark beers and you have the choice between this and regular becks definately go with the dark. It has a much fuller more robust flavor than the skunky green bottle. I've had better beers than Beck's Dark but not many."
"Drinkability - another one that you could drink all day without suffering.... but nothing special."
"D - Session beer! Uncomplicated quaffability. A very nice bar beer to compliment a burger."
"I really enjoy Becks regular as a kick-back-easy beer (despite the unnecessarily high import price). This dark, though, doesnt do it for me."
"Pours out like rusty grape juice with a thin head that fizzles out to nothing rather quickly. I mostly get hops in the nose: flowers, herbs and tea. Some roasted malt comes in if I really strain, but this is mostly flwoery smelling. Some toasty and chocolatey malts mix well with the abundant hop flavor as found in the nose. Kind of sweet. Mouthfeel is a little too sticky for me. This is all-around OK. Not really bad or good."
"Overall, it's certainly not bad. It's lacking in flavor and complexity, but not all beers need to be barley-wines. I wouldn't recommend trying it unless you're out someplace where the choices are fairly bland. These aren't the driods you're looking for, move along."
"This one was served with a huge, frothy, foamy, textured head and lots of lace. The color is a nice clear dark brown with garnet highlights. Aroma is slightly roasty, malty, beery, and fresh. Flavor is the same but bittersweet. Nice body. Very drinkable and definitely a session beer! Much better than I remember, especially from the bottle."
"Drinkability- I could drink this all day and night. No shit"
"Pours a black color with amber hues and a nice foamy tan head with little lacing. Smells of sweet coffee and caramel. Taste was similar with the slight sweetness, I could taste caramel with a bit of roasted coffee flavors. It tasted pretty good and I'll drink it again... I've enjoyed several of these lately, a decent beer to have with friends or even have as an everyday beer."
"Eric"
"This beer is not particularly appealing. It's drinkable, but there are a lot better dark lagers to be had."
"Sparkling clear with a dark amber to brown color. Poured a bit but coarse and rapidly disappearing head. Surprisingly aromatic, with a nice mix of malt and noble hops in the nose. Malty up front, but balanced by the darker malts and the hops. Hop bitterness somewhat dominant in the middle, which surprised. Low to medium body, with fairly high carbonation. Generally smooth and clean - no astringency. A beautiful, nicely drinking beer. Bitterness perhaps a bit too much from the style, and restricts it from being an easy pounder. Nicely attenuated with a dry finish."
"This isn't half bad for Beck's. The sweetness can get a bit bothersome and old after about mid glass, ecspecially due to its lack of body to hold the sweetness together better in the taste."
"This is what my friend had on hand for the Eagles victory over Dallas. And as an Eagles fan, it's hardly worthy of celebrating a win. Still, with some hoagies and chili, it at least wasn't totally overwhelmed. But really, that's not an endorsement. It's about as blah and overtly average as a beer can get. If it had just something, somewhere, that stood out, I'd have enjoyed drinking this. As it was, I might just as well have been drinking water, were it not for the fact there was at least some alcohol in there. So I won't be coming back this way again. Next time I bring my own beer."
"pours dark brown red color half inch head fades fast. weak smell not much there. taste sweet caramel with a very slight hop taste at the end. mouthfeel light crisp dry would have liked a smoother taste for a dark beer but it was ok. its enjoyable but for a dark beer i have had better."
"D- This beer is decently drinkable. It doesn't leave any bad taste in your mouth and if it was up to me I'd say this beer is recommended. Best Beck's I've had."
"Drinkability is fine, these go down so nicely, not as substantial a flavor as some, but nice and refreshing..and worth a try in my opinion, I have picked these up here and there over the years, and I know I will have them again."
" This might be my baseline for a ""3" very average-- when you get a good bottle."
"Overall, it's not bad at all, but nothing particularly special. It weakens as the drink progresses. The first sips are the best. It thins after that. It's easily accessible, fairly smooth, but better examples of the style are out there. A tad above average brew, but nothing great."
"Pours brown with tan head. As others have said, the head falls quickly. Aroma has some malt, faint floral hops and some faint roasted smell. Flavor is malty with little hop bitterness. Some roasted flavor there too. Mouthfeel is thin. This isn't bad, its drinkable but it has too little flavor and its too watery. That said, its better than any BMC type beer."
"Though this is a dark lager,it feels a little light. Not too watery, but lighter than I expected."
"Finish hoppy, aftertaste a bit nutty. Decent mass-production beer, easily drinkable."
"Bottom Line: Plain and simple, not reccomended. I must say that this is a sort of a below average beer that the only thing that I could really note as a special feature was the smell. Cheers"
"This is weaker than I thought it would be. Perhaps, it could work as a converter of macro drinkers?"
"Pours a dark mahogany color with a small head that fades fast. Fairly mild malt smell. Taste was not bad. Strong malt flavor and fairly smooth. I detected some mild chocolate or molasses type sweetness as I drank it but the overall initial taste is malt with some bitterness. Mouthfeel a bit weak, but disguised by the flavor. This is a beer to order when dining out and the selections are limited. Not bad, but there are so many better beers. Sold at premium prices, I don't see this as a sessions beer."
"dry metalic finish detracts from the overall experience, found it hard to finish just one"
" I would probably be upset if Beck's started to try marketing this as Beck's Dunkel. It just wouldn't be right."
"Well...it's beer. Not good, not bad, just beer. Predictibly dark brown with typical tan head retention and a little lacing. Smells a normal toasty, lightly roasty and bready. Light sweetness with the malts, relying on roasted grain to offer flavor and bittering. Medium body with medium cleanliness. Ordinary and, unfortunately borring. A moderate grainy flavor keeps it from ranking higher for me."
"Beck's Dark pours a dark brown with lighter brown highlights around the edges with an off white head from a green twelve ounce bottle. I can smell a little bit of hops, but it's a fairly mild - but somewhat skunky aroma. I can taste some malt along with the hops. Drinkable, but not particularly interesting."
"Pours dark and bring out a nice off-white head. Smells slightly of chocolate malt but mostly it is very muted lager smell. The taste is nice clean unskunked lager with a slight complementary roasty and nutty flavor. Nice med-light body along with a low abv gives this a six pack award for cheap, tasty, and slammable."
"this pours out a deep reddish brown. average head. its looks pretty good. it dosnt attack your nose with anything but light hints of whats to come. smells sweet. a little funky. taste wise, its pretty much the same. tastes like a euro lager with a little extra malt, a little dark fruit here and there and a touch of skunk. not really my bag. mouthfeel seemed off. highly carbonated and a bit much. not ""smooth"" by any means. overall i wasnt feeling it. decent beer i guess, but not one id drink often."
"Opinion: I have drank this beer quite a few times when this was the best the bar I was at had on tap, but I dont remember ever having one that was this rough. I am sure that I will try this beer again, but it is a mediocre beer at bestespecially by German standards."
"This is very unoffensive, very average, very consumable."
"I don't care for this beer. Won't buy again."
"Overall this is a tasty beer that I could drink several in a row of but it seems underflavored and overcarbonated for it's darkness (and that is taking into consideration the small head). It is missing the redeeming quality of Beck's Light, the refreshing taste. To me this is another beer that fools Americans with the concept of a dark beer from Europe, even though it doesn't fully fit the bill."
"Smooth finish. Altogether nothing special but a decent drink."
"This beer pours a dark color but is still clear. i used a pilsner glass. This beer did not have much head and hardly laced the glass. the smell wasnt that great not very hoppy. It is somewhat of a bitter tasting beer. It is sort of bland but not too dry. Medium carbonation, might be better with just a tad more bubbles. very thin mouthfeel. I dont know about this one, its definately not on the top of the list for me. but try it i guess"
"Pours a dark mahogany, but very clear. The head is thin in consistency and hieght, and does not retain very well or leave any lacing. The nose is mostly clean, just some faint toasted dark amber malt and noble hop aromas. Roasted and smoky flavor, with a generous dose of skunk. In the aftertaste, the off-flavor turns medicinal and astringent, which will eventually ruin the finish and drinkability. Mild carbonation and a light body. Perhaps this was lightstruck, but if this is how it's supposed to taste, there is a gross imbalance of taste that ruins what would be a smooth mouthfeel."
"Overall: Definitely a decent and not-too-expensive dark lager. Worth a try."
"I drank this because it was the best one or two choices in the place, and is the only reason I would drink it again. It's not a horrible beer, but it's definitely made for a newly adventurous American beer drinker."
"Pours out a decent looking dark amber brew with a one finger head that doesnt last long.Smells of typical skunk euro brew.Very pale taste considering the color. Not a bad taste just lack of.No hops to speak of. Highly carbonated mouthfeel. Is drinkable,probably in mass quantities,,on the same par as typical macros."
"Notes: nothing special, but pretty drinkable"
"Bottle obtained from the discount bin of a local liquor store. Bottle stamp reads 04.2006 L11859R. Ha, I just had a Gonzo from Flying Dog...let's see how a Beck's ""dark"" holds up. Pours a two finger brown head that's quickly settling. A crystal clear dark brown mohogeny liquid. The head has already nearly settled and is popping like that ine cereal. Smells potently of tin hops. Saaz, my nose says. Sweet malt way beneath with searching. Hey, maybe even a hint of roast! Tastes hop bitter. Tin hop taste of Saaz. Some roast, but way beneath the hops. Almost beneath the flavor of the carbonation. Upon the swallow, I get some green apple, which I think may come from the use of black patent. Malt sweet is the aftertaste, but this is not a strong flavor. Md-light body, which is thicker than I was expecting. Too carbonated, but this is drinkable and actually tastes much better than i expected."
"This is also okay in a bottle for when your slumming it in the village, plus the NYU coeds will probably think you're sophisticated for drinking Beck's."
"I could drink this in a major pinch. It is better than most American B/M/C. Only slightly better though. It has flavor and not much of it is off. It is what it is. Drinkable? Well, the bottle is finishable. My bottle was purchased in Omaha."
"It is quite drinkable and would certainly have another if in a bar that didn't have a great selection."
"This is a pretty drinkable beer. Good session brew."
"Overall Impression: *Yawn*. Yeah, nothing wrong with it. I guess it could serve as a gateway for macro drinkers. I dont think Ill be back anytime soon."
"Drinkability: This beer wasnt terrible. There were some nice flavors and aromas in there, but it just didnt taste complete. Something is just missing. Not really worth the price."
"Nose was slightly malty, not much going on that I could notice. Not alot of carbonation and had a mostly thin mouthfeel. Taste was mildly malty with a slight macro skunk. A hint-o-hops in the finish. 6 months ago I'd have had higher praise for this but now, even though it's ok, I'd never feel the urge to buy it."
"poured a clear brown color with modest puffy head. Smell is of a toasty maltiness with hints of burnt sugar. Toasty malt flavor shows through with a slight bdry, bitterness at the finish. Not a beer to get excited about, but better than the American macro lagers."
"Fills the glass with a very dark color. Not quite pitch black, but maybe the darkest shade of brown I've ever seen. Not much head to speak of. The nose is of pure sweet carmel malts. Not too strong, but I only notice that one characteristic in the scent. Surprisingly, it tastes very similar to regular Beck's. It has the same mild skunkiness that I seem to find in almost every German beer. The aftertaste in this one is a bit sweeter and maltier, but other than that there's not a lot of differences in the taste department. The mouthfeel is a tad over medium-bodied. Very good feel and nice drinkability as well. Although I seemed to complain about this beer once or twice, it sure went down fast!"
"Slàinte!"
"Drinkability: The slightly unbalanced character makes it difficult to drink more than one of these in one sitting. I think with just a bit more of a hop kick in the finish this might be improved."
"from the bottle . I bought this bottle because it has ben a long time since I have had a becks .poured brown with off white head. aroma, malts , barley, malts. flavor, malts, caramel, corn, I use to like this beer in my younger days when I thought that drinking a becks was cool."
"Drinkability: There are better beers out there, there are worse. There's just nothing special about this beer, and I'll almost never pick buy this by choice. Give me Warsteiner or Spaten any day."
"Overall: I can't really recommend this beer. It's drinkable but doesn't taste great."
"Poured a very ruddy chocolate color. Nose was unremarkable, head was only 1/4"" of cream that disappaited quickly. Tongue was a balanced bitter-hoppy, difused with a solid mocha-like current to it that provided a very mild sweet (like a dark chocolate type sweet). Went down a little sharp. Its an odd beer, but I did enjoy it."
"Had these free at a work happy hour, so was only able to sample direct from the bottle. Was able to detect a roasted malt, by sticking my nose in the bottle, which drew some puzzled looks from co-workers. DIDNT detect the ol Euro sulfur skunk, thank God. Actually, this brew was good; tangy, maltly and nicely carbonated. Nothing fantastic, but still very drinkable and enjoyable  maybe the free price helped, but Ill get these again."
"Not bad, but there is nothing noteworthy about this beer either. I would order or buy this over a regular Beck's."
"A diamond in the rough, the damp stainless steel nose and the lack of adequate sweet barley malt to balance out the bitter hops keeps me from praising this offering from Beck's."
"Drinkability- This wouldn't be that bad of a session beer I guess. Decent brew."
"Taste is flat and without depth. The drinkability is good, except it sits in the stomach and leaves a thin residue on the mouth that doesn't entice another drink...I don't want to sip again, also, because it tastes like seltzer after half a bottle. Blech. Best aspect of the beer has to be...erm...mouthfeel, which. Zesty. Otherwise poor."
"Disappointed from the beginning by paying $3.50 for a bottle after my first two choices on the menu were unavailable. Better than an original Beck's but that's not saying too much. Took an entire dinner to drink one down. Medium hoppiness, okay carbonation and lacing. Not a huge fan of Munich Dunkel Lager style."
"The case states that this is the number one imported beer from Germany. I didn't expect this to be up to usual German standards, and I was right. Appearance is almost black, head is light brown and somewhat creamy. Smell is malty with a bready aroma. Not very complex and somewhat generic. Taste is also malty, good-enough, but not complex or special. I could drink plenty of this, but this is below average by German standards, still this is way better than most imported macros and those of the US."
"Pours the color of dark cola, with a small off-white head. Smells of grassy malt, which has a slight roasted smell to them. Taste is also very predictable of the style, grassy alt, slightly nutty roasted malt, nothing spectaculat. THis beer is easy drinking, though, and for the price there are many other beers and styles I would get."
"why do they even make dark euro lagers? this crap is nasty, and so is hieneken dark. it has got me thinking, what would budweiser dark taste like? appearance is crap, but it's better looking than regular beck's. everything else about it is crap is well. if you are just getting started on your journey for beer enlightenment i can see how you might like this. if you've already tried plenty of great beers, don't waste your money."
"Pours with a one-finger off-white head that leaves no lace. Deep, clear amber color. Light bodied and very light carbonation. Skunky nose. Starts with a tinny, metallic, skunky taste (what is it with the green bottles??) and has a watery finish. $1.55 for a 12oz. bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"I had this in a giant glass stein (1250ml) at the Disney Food and Wine Festival. Dark brown to black with a cap of light brown. This left decent lacing around the glass but nothing out of the ordinary. Vague nut scent with an even less distinguished coffee. Good baking chocolate and coffee flavor. A nice finish with light hops that faded quickly. Smooth effervescent feel with a nice tingly sensation. A nice session beer, great with some sauerkraut covered brats and potato pancakes."
"The beer after its escape from the 12 ounce green bottle sets in the glass a somewhat hazy brown color, the head spumous and the color a light tan, lace manages to cover the glass. Nose is mostly malt with a hint of sweet caramel, fresh with the start nicely malted, sweet and the top fair in its feel to the palate. Finish is moderately acidic, the hops light but noticeable, dry aftertaste, drinkable yes."
"Historic notes- many years ago-(late 1970's?) a former Miller Brewing Exec, Walter Driskill, became the importer for Becks. His company was Dribeck (Driskill/Becks). In the wasteland of the '70's this was a quality choice.It has changed hands since."
"I'm not sure what I ever saw in Beck's Dark. It's better than many of the other offerings in bars and restaurants and it just might be my pick given the poor overall selection that's out there. It is not, however, a beer that I'll buy for the pleasure of its consumption."
"Beck's Dark is a beer that has intrigued me for quite some time. I've been looking and looking at it in several beer stores thinking that I should give it a try. Well, today I finally did. Unfortunately, I was not particularly impressed. Beck's Dark pours deep brown and settles a very dark brown (nearly black) with a light-tan head. It starts with a silky texture and heavy wheat flavor. Then it builds to a full-bodied combination of oats, cream, and spice. Beck's Dark slips off the tongue and leaves a very strong and rather unpleasant aftertaste that coats your tongue for at least a half-hour after the beer is gone. Overall, not a bad beer, but certainly not one of my favorites."
"12 ounce bottle, best before dating. Pours dark brown, mollasas in color, off white head, some lacing. Malty nose with some chocolate. Soft chocolate notes on a malty backbone. Some hops come in late to balance the sweetness. Medium body. Fairly dull brew. Better then the skunky lighter version. Better then most macros in a pinch."
"Final Opinion; I'll probably try it again to make sure, worth the price..."
"Pours out dark with some hints of deep red. A nice thick almond colored head appeared, but quickly reduced to a thin lace. The smell was difficult for me to place, but seemed to be a little fruity or citrus. Nothing really stood out there. The taste is pleasing, but not as full as I would expect from such a dark beer. It has malty characteristics and a nice hop flavor, but not as expressive as I would like. It finishes with a hint of hop bitterness, but not as strongly as I would expect. The mouthfeel is decent...but not wonderful. I drink this beer occasionally to shake things up. Nothing to drive miles and miles to find, but a worthy offering if you like darker beers. I suppose this is a beer that was almost great...but came up just a little short in most areas."
"All and all I thought this beer was too thin, but it was very drinkable and refreshing. I could see myself drinking this beer at the lake or by the pool. A great summer time refreshing beer, but not something I would go out of my way to drink."
"I was very disappointed, to say the least. I have come to expect less from macros, but my hopes were high when this one was tapped for me. True, there are some notes of roasted malt and maybe even some coffee-type sweetness in the nose, which transfer to the flavor in some capacity, but I had trouble getting this Bier down for some reason. The deep color was one redeeming factor, but in the dorld of Dunkels, there are many that are far superior."
"Beck's Dark is highly available and fairly priced, 1.99 a bomber. I picked one up and got what I expected. The apperance is dark with light streaks and a tan head that fades like a soda pop. Smell is roasted malts with grain, fruit tones. The taste was to fruity for me, tasted like a watered down juice not a beer. Felt decent in the mouth, light but with bounce. Drinkable if you don't have much money and you need an average beer. Still much better out there."
"Nice looking medium brown, almost red color with a thin off white head. Aroma is a bit toasty, a bit skunky. Not a very impressive beer, but not at all offensive. A bit of grainy, toasty malt and a touch of hops to finish. Mouthfeel is thin, but not too bad."
"When I poured this dark lager, the dark-but slightly translucent appearance and modest head was a pleasant surprise. Could I have stumbled onto a quality beer with widespread availability? The aroma was a basic mix of grains and yeasty lager scents. I was neither turned off nor impressed. The beers initial burst of malt flavors tapered quickly into a yeast phase and then a thin and lingering sweetness. I was initially intrigued, but rather put off by the completion of my first taste. The beer was far too thin, and watery for my tastes and I found it to be a chore to finish the pint."
"A tasty brew, better than regular Beck's, but there are better German brews."
"Drinkability  I can find a lot better examples of the style, but if youre in a grocery store with a macro selection and want something dark . . . give this one a try."
"thin mouthfeel. I wouldn't buy."
"Appearance: Dark caramel brown with a decently frothy tan head impressed by the length of the retention, lacing still lies rather thin specks. Aroma: European hopping dosage with cooked veggies and darker roasts bringing slight caramel notes not bad. Taste: Much better than I recall Beck's ever tasting, with slight sweet mild chocolate notes and a hoppy cooked veggie finish not bad refreshing and flavorful not bad. Mouthfeel: A bit thin but it's not horrible light to medium bodied nowhere near as watery as a typical American macro. Drinkability: I could definitely buy a sixer of this to watch a football game with has some flavor and character therefore not bad in my book."
"It's difficult to come up with a great deal to criticize here; at the same time, there's not much to praise, either. This is a mass-produced beer that I would never be angry to see on my table, and that cannot be a bad thing. I wish it were stronger, more complex, and had more body, but that would mean that I would wish it were something other than a mass-produced beer."
"Been a couple years since I had one of these. Pours a very dark brown, very small head is quickly gone. Very little lacing. Not much to the nose. Medium body that seems a little watery. Faint taste of chocolate and malt, with a slight hop finish. Drinkability is helped by the watered down sensation. Maybe that's to be expected for this style, but I liked these much better a few years ago. Not a bad dark lager by any means, just not what I'm looking for."
"This beer looks good in the glass. Nice fine beige bubbles and a little lace. Aroma is slightly skunky from the bottle but that goes away fast, leaving a pilsner-like sweet malt and noble hop aroma. Flavor is pleasingly malty and balanced, with sweet-roasty notes throughout. Finishes with roasted malt and slight bitterness."
"I can't complain too much about Beck's Dark but I can't rave too much about it, either."
"Still, better than a lot of more standard pale lagers, and definately better than the normal Becks. Drink it, if your options are thin."
"I used to really like this beer, but back then there werent that many choices. Still, the beer goes good with simple foods like a mushroom swiss burger on toasted black bread."
"I sampled quite a few of these during a wedding this past weekend. Pours a dark, charcoal-brown color with a thin white-ish head. Aroma is fainlty of roasted grains and hops. Thin, slightly watery mouthfeel and a less-than-substantial malt flavor. Chocolate and nut are present, but slight, in the flavor. The bottom line is that it's an average, everyday beer: no real flaws, but nothing special here."
"($5.99 / 6-pack)"
"The beer pours a dark burgandy color with a nice off-white head. The aroma is typical of a German lager. There are a few small notes of crystal malts. There is little hop aroma. The taste is decent, but nothing to write home about. This is a light bodied beer with a good amount of carbonation. It seems a bit light and watery, but goes down easy. A good party beer."
"This was my favorite beer for a long time. I have since moved on to a new style (IPA). But I still have fond memories of looking forward to the motor oil. Still a very good stop gap beer when no other truly exotic brews are available. This may be the Michelob of German beers, but it serves the purpose in a pinch."
"This certainly looks like a dark beer with a nice head and some good carbonation to match. But that's where the comparisons end. Scent is alright. Kind of malty but not real strong. The taste is surprising in the fact that it tastes SO light and weak. Watery to say the least. Flavors are hiding and can't come out. I notice an astringent grainy flavor. The rest are too scarce to notice. Finishes forgetably. I don't know who would drink this. It's not for the calorie conscience nor is it for the true beer lover."
"This beer pours a dark amber - actually, it's more like a watered down dark beer more than a dark amber. There is little head and no lacing on the glass. The aroma is almost non-existant. The little bit of aroma is slightly malty. The taste is actually pretty smooth, but a little watered down. I found this beer quite enjoyable even though it's not too interesting. The aftertaste is a little dry, but good. Recommended."
"A dunkel or dark lager from Becks.. much maltier than the original Becks with hints of chocolate and a nice smooth finish.. dark brown in color with a lasting head and subtle mouthfeel.. drinkablility is good since it is just right in ABV worth the taste and easy to find."
"Overall this is a step up from the more forgettable Beck's pale lager offering, being above average in appearance and better in smell and taste. Though this brew is still a bit light in body it does give a nice malty, bready sense that comes through in both departments. The look is good with a nicely billowing head and small level of lacing. The dark malt adds a bit of sensual improvement just not possible in the pale gold version."
"This beer does conjure up some memories of Michelob Amber Bock, but it is of higher quality (as far as macros go). This won't be a regular in my fridge, but I wouldn't mind picking this up every once in awhile."
"It's very much like a Coors with some dark malt thrown in for color which also adds only a hint of flavor. Overall I found this to be pretty bland and uninteresting but not offensive in the least. DMS came through a little on the finish. Surprisingly not skunked despite the green bottle."
"All in all a pretty drinkabkle beer which could be a lot better if they spiced up the taste a bit..come on Beck's take a chance!"
"It really is a shame about this beer. This is a perfect examble of a German dunkel, a beer that really doesn't exist in the US. It's hard to come by true dark lagers that aren't octoberfests or bocks. Sadly the skunk overshadowed this really nice complex balanced beer."
"M"
"The taste also follows the traditional beck's. It is bitter with a lot of malt. There is not a whole lot of dark matls in this one. The nice roasty flavor is almost completely absent. This is a disappointing beer and nothing more."
"Got almost no head out of this one (despite its freshness), but its appearance is otherwise nice and even interesting. Pours a dark but clear brown with amber highlights when held to light. Nose is sweet and malty with yeasty notes. Tastes sweeter than expected with a persistent crispness as well as malt and grains. Crispness creates a good mouthfeel in this drinkable but so-so dark."
"Decent beer from a style I do not know much of. It pours a nice dark brown with some head that fades fairly quickly. It smells good with nice smelling hops. The taste has some roasty, caramel taste that plays against a bitter bite. Nonetheless it goes down fairly smooth and has a good drinkability. Overall, a good brew that will probably get again for a nice change of pace."
"Presentation: Packaged in a green glass longneck bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Dark burnt umber color, clear...good 1/2 inch head early, clears in a minute. Aroma has a little bit of spice to the malty sweetness. Not bad  nutty and toasty flavor. Munich-like. Lighter-bodied and a little paste-like early, malt impression carries to the end. Finish is similar to the start, with a little drying hop and a grainy quality. No skunk. OK beer, pretty average and theres so much more to explore in the world of beerdom than this one."

"Shiny brown color. Thin bubbly beige head. Not much to note smell wise. Taste was crisp, sweet, and somewhat malty. Very light on the beer flavors. Much thinner than I was hoping for, but about what I expected. Moderate carbonation, crisp and tasted fresh. No skunkiness factor to note. Easy to drink, but lacks alot of flavor. Overall a decent dunkel, it will do when in a pinch."
"Rather unremarkable brew. Characteristic is reminiscent of a standard lager with some brown food coloring thrown in. Light and crisp, yet lacking in body that should be found in a Dunkel. Wish I had something better available at my own wedding!"
"A sweet dark beer.  A strong molasses taste make this a tasty dark beer.  Foam dissipates quickly, but served cold it doesn't matter.  Very drinkable as there is no bitterness often associated with darks.  Kind of a thin mouthfeel, but doesn't really detract from the experience."
"This is a decent beer.  Some roasted malt taste blends in nice.  Drinkable, but not complex.  This is a beer macro drinkers will drink and isn't a bad idea to introduce them to in order to show them that all beer isn't yellow."
"Not terribly bad...kinda okay.  Appearance is nice with a dark brown/amber with a tan 2 finger head that dissipates rather quickly.  Smell was not ""out of this world"" as it had a slight skunk to it, but hints of malt were apparent as well.  The taste was better than the smell, as it did not taste of skunk.  The creamy mouthfell and malty taste were the upside, but the tale end is a very thin mouthfeel that doesn't quite go with the initial taste.  Prosit!"
"On my previous encounters, I had thought (as others had) that this tasted like regular Beck's, only dark.  But this tasting was a little more than that.  The color was dark ruby with a short-lasting thin head.  The smell was of sweet malt.  The flavor was much more flavorful than the aroma let on.  The roasted malt was pleasing, but not complex enough to consider great.  There was good carbonation, but it was a little thin.  I would rate this beer as highly drinkable however...it had decent flavor and was light to drink.  Refreshing."
"Mouthfeel did leave something to be desired, it was slightly too flat and watery.  Instead of comparing this with more robust and exotic beers, I'll leave it at this:  Beck's that's dark.  That really does sum it up."
"Dark brown - deep garnet hue and crystal clear as expected for a lager.  The head isn't well retained and settles into a thin but tight layer.  Very husky, grainy notes dominate the aroma and chocolate notes are perceptible but very subdued--Munich malt toastiness is absent.  The body is very thin for a Dunkel and the mouthfeel borderlines on being watery.  Malt complexity is lacking in this brew-- light roasted grain flavors manage to emerge, but nothing else supports them flavorwise.  Beck's Dark finishes dry, lightly bittersweet and quite bland.  Beck's Dark is to regular Beck's as Michelob Dark is to regular Michelob."
"Medium brown with reddish hue. Very little head or lace.  Fresh smelling.  Tastes generic with slight hop sharpness, with a sweet malt finish.  Feels very normal and generic. A typical German Macro"
"Okay, this is probably one of the first dark beers I remember having.  While having a darker color, the overall taste just does little to give it much standing as a dark beer."
"Beck’s Dark:  Nice appearance, and smells much better than the typical euro-lager.  However, the taste just simply is not there.  It has a very weak brown beer.  There are probably thousands of better dark beers out there."
"Rather plain. Hints of chocoa and a bit of almond. Something about the smell turned me off, kinda like stale chocolate (you know when it loses color and such). I have fonder memories of this beer."
"Yep, it's a dunkel. Nope, not a great one. Beck's dark is just another small beer with a huge distribution area."
"Notes: Sadly this brew turns into something that may have been good to something that is a tad hard to drink. There are better dark lagers in the world that will beat this one time and time again."
"nice and smooth with some sweet malty flavors on the tongue.  just hopped enough to add some crispness in the end.  nothing spectacular but solid enough not to complain."
"My introduction into dark beers, yet not heavy/roasty. Light bodied with moderate hopping make this one great for those not sure about jumping into the dark. A nice way to break into the world of dark beers."
"I was not that impressed for a dark beer. the color is dark brown, with a medium body. The flavor has a mild malt sweetness and subtle hops. Overall not that bad, but nothing great."
"Light to medium bodied with a mild malt sweetness and subtle hops. Not a bad beer when there's limited selection. Nothing special though, not worth seeking out."
"Dark, with a flat head, no aromas besides vague maltiness.  Not all that impressed.  I had it on tap, and although it started off flavorful, it quickly faded and became almost tastless.  Dark malt it present and this beer is smooth.  Not compelling at all."
"Not nearly as dark in flavor as in color.  Mildly caramel, without much depth.  Mass-produced character, but drinkable, particularly if fresh."
