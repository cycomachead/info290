Smell is of malt, grain, caramel, and fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some solid aromas and flavors.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 02, 2013"

3.71,-4.4,4,3,4,3.5,4,"Overall: Despite the mild aroma and slightly too sweet body, this is pretty damn good for a Dunkel. While not my favorite Surly by a long shot, I have to appreciate what they have accomplished here.","bsp77","May 21, 2011"

I would have liked more head but it seems the bartender wanted to fill it to the brim! The aroma is actually quite mild with notes of light roast coffee. Medium mouthfeel. I would guess this uses maris otter barley given the appearance and aroma. Medium mouthfeel. Starts off with a very slight dark fruit flavor, a touch nuttiness, and the aforementioned light roast notes. Sweetness sticks around the whole time. Mild bitterness. Some caramel flavors as well as it warms up a touch. VERY easy drinking. Like.","kbutler1","Aug 23, 2010"
