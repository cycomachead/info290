4,7,,,,,,"02/27/13  On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. At first blush I though the chocolate was out of place in a 'lager' but soon learned, no matter what you want to call it this is a fine brew.","seedyone","May 30, 2014"

4.87,30.2,5,4.75,5,4.75,4.75,"On draft at Capone's. Pours a deep black/brown with tan head. Mild chocolate aroma. Taste is mellow chocolate and coffee with a subtle sweet malt and roasted malt finish. I really felt this lucious brew drank like a porter so I checked out the Cricket Hill website and there it is listed as an ale: "Nocturne Chocolate Ale". Therefore I have to assume the Beer Advocate listing is in error and this is an American style porter. As such it is outstanding on draft and worth seeking out.","wattoclone","Apr 04, 2014"

Taste is chocolatey, some coffee, drinks more like a stout than a lager. feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall, not what I expected, but a pretty good beer.","tone77","Nov 23, 2013"

Would probably be heavier than most would expect, almost reaching into porter or stout territory. Well, not almost. It does. Regardless, it's a nice beer.","RblWthACoz","May 31, 2013"

3.88,3.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Not really sure of what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised by this offering. It's caramelish, toasty, chocolatey/cocoa-ish, and a touch roasty. There are some nice floral and leafy hops to it, and it initially balances quite well. Unfortunately, the roasty edge builds on the palate a bit, thus accentuating the bitterness a bit as well. It finishes dry with a coffee character and solid bitterness. The first quarter of the glass was great, it lost luster half-way, and then it became softer and more enjoyable as it warmed. The roastiness is a little bit much given the malt component, but that makes it unique. Probably worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Jan 16, 2012"

Flavor has a malty core with smoky, caramel and coffee hints. Texture has average, powdery body and just a little fizz, leaving a malty and slightly smoky finish.","Cyberkedi","Nov 30, 2011"

4.23,13.1,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Given to me by the brewery's owner (great guy), it pours a very dark amber, almost brown, with hues of ruby on the edges when held up to the light. Has a decent tan head that leaves a thin ring of lacing. The aroma is of roasted malts with a bread like quality. The taste follows the nose with roastiness but also has hints of mild chocolate, which makes this a creamy and very smooth treat. Overall this is a very drinkable brew.","WhiskeyNinja","Nov 16, 2011"
2.68,-28.3,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"honey color to it though with some darker touches around the sides that served it quite well. Aroma was decent, very sweet with lots of caramel and honey notes as well as lots of touches of nuts as well. Warming almost brings out a touch of fruit now. But the flavor really falls off. It seems as though it comes across musky and stale, the fact that it is flat does not help at all. A wash of bready malts, touches of grain and a hint of caramel all seem to miss and this quasi wheat and fruit note comes in, with a wet cardboard flavor. Not working out at all.","mikesgroove","Nov 15, 2011"

3.93,5.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"O: The beer is very sessionable because itâ€™s not very filling, goes down easily and has a low alcohol content. It packs in a lot of aroma and flavor for a beer with a light body.","metter98","Beers"
3.68,-1.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This is a nocturne. A Which? You know: Frederik fucking Chopin. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear garnet-brown topped by over a finger of dusty light tan foam. The nose comprises light roasted malts, light toffee, mineral water, and a touch of vague fruitiness. The taste holds notes of very light roasted malts, mild cocoa powder, potting soil, dark greens, and a slightly biting herbal bitterness at the end. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick feel. Overall, a pretty nice Munich dark, something you don't see too many of in these parts.","TMoney2591","0"
3.96,5.9,4,3,4.5,4,4,"4.0 D: There's a good amount of flavor in this despite not being an imperial something or other and the components work well together.

4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall pretty good, nice crisp lager flavors, nice malts both toasty reddish malts and darker roasty porter malts, finish could have been a bit drier and light minerality flavor from the dark malts and light herbal hops.","jlindros","Feb 11, 2011"
3.88,3.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"An almost opaque body that becomes blood red when put up to the light topped by off-white head that retreats to the rim of my glass. Black cherries and faint wheat in the nose. Tastes of light cereal, dark fruit (black cherries and prunes), cola, faint echo of caramel, and a light bitterness accompanied by a spicy hop toward the finish that rides out the drink. Light in body with light carbonation. It's easy on the belly and contains a great balance between sweet malt and a light hop presence. An interesting beer fit for hot nights, chilling outside with a cigar.","JRed","Jan 28, 2011"

3.97,6.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"I could and I would have another 22 ounce bottle of this, if I had another one. It's quite tasty for a Dark Lager but it reminds me more of an English Brown Ale to me.","9InchNails","Oct 04, 2010"
3.94,5.3,3,4,4,4,4,"Dark brown color with a head that barely formed before settling to a thin film. There was a moderate amount of lacing left on the glass. Pleasing aroma of some dark malt that gives hints of chocolate and smoke. I am not picking up any hop aroma. Good malt flavors as well. Notes of chocolate and mild roastedness. A touch of grass is the only hop flavor I can detect. Definate lager flavor. Nice body and carbonation gives this beer a good texture. This beer lies somewhere between a Dunkel and a Schwarzbier, but whatever it is, it tastes good and is an enjoyable beer with a low ABV.","morimech","Apr 18, 2010"
3.88,3.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Deep cola brown color. Pours a rich foamy biege head between two and three fingers high. Leaves a nice abstract lace residue around the glass. Rich chocolately malty aroma with taste to match with some coffee. I'm pretty sure that's anise or licorice I taste too. I think you could enjoy this with a nice red meat meal or just buy itself like a dessert. I am not a dark beer guy but this was pretty darn good.","cpanossian","Apr 01, 2010"
4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall this wasn't quite robust enough for a schwarzbier however it was certainly different in flavor profile for an amber lager. A nice cross between the two styles and well worth a shot.","glid02","Mar 24, 2010"
3.88,3.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A dark brown color, kind of chesnut. Thick tan head. Roasted, smoky malt aroma. Some sweetness, probably chocolate. Mostly malt taste, molasses, still showed that smoky taste.

3.88,3.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"D: Nice drinkability, dry, sweet with a light appreciable smoky touch gives this some variation and depth. Probably one of their better beers to date and one that may finally give them some respect. Drinks like a smoky Vienna lager but not as sweet with a nice dryness for a finishing touch. Definitely worth a try.","beerthulhu","Mar 10, 2010"
4.07,8.8,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"I like it, would I ever call it "Great" ? probably not, but that isn't the point, this is a great beer to hang out with and session with. it is like a comfortable blanket... and in that regard it succeeds as such.","Ego","Feb 26, 2010"
4.3,15,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured into a pilsner styled glass. Pour a clear, deep dark chestnut brown, almost black with a light tan creamy head that hangs around a long time and has great lacing. A malty earthy aroma. Very malty taste hints of chocolate but not too sweet with a slight burnt malt and sour aftertaste. Very smooth to drink, goes down easy. This is by far the best beer I've had from Cricket Hill (not that I have had many) but it has left me wanting to explore more of their brews.","bob3701","Feb 04, 2010"

3.35,-10.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Pours deep reddish black with an off-color head. The aroma is malty and roasted, to the point of being a little raisny. The flavor is strong, woody, smoky, with a little dark fruit, cherry, raisin, plum. There is a nice smokey sweetness down the throat. But then, oddly enough, be beer just evaporates - nothing much left on the finish. The mouthfeel is carbonated but rather thin.","Seanibus","Dec 30, 2009"
