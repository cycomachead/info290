"O-this was a great beer I love the taste all around"
""
"O: This beer is great, and I wish more American brewers would try their hand at Munich Dunkel Lagers because there's a lot of room to play with these flavors and experiment. Until then, seek out Lobo Negro when you are in Texas."

"Very good Dunkel,  they have great water quality and that really enhances the taste of this beer. I enjoy it for lighter beer."
""
"A good solid beer, not as malty, and roast character is not as subtle, as a Munich Dunkel, but roast is not as overdone as many American breweries attempting the style, but still one of the better attempts I've tasted from an American brewery. Darker than what the style calls for I believe. I'd definitely drink it again, but would seek out a true German Dunkel when wanting to satisfy my Dunkel craving."

"Coffee taste very soothing, enjoy it very much"

"Great head on pour. Not advertised as a dunkel, looks like a stout and taste like a black IPA. Would still recommend it"

"Definitely worth drinking. I'll pick up again when I'm in San Antonio, but not worth seeking out here in the North."

"O: This is a good one. I've had Pedernales at a local tasting and remembered this one. Now that I've had a full bottle, I can recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good Dunkel."

"This is a beefy brew that commands attention . . . in a good way. I look forward to drinking more of it, trying some food-pairings, and maybe braising a dark-breasted game bird in Lobo Negro."

"One last note... this beer tastes very fresh."

"Overall - A good beer just wish the smell and inital flavor were improved. I will have it again though"

"A surprisingly good beer that seems to be more in the German vein than than the usual haphazard styling. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Texas Wine in Fredericksburg."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy dark reddish brown color with a small dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of chocolate, caramel, pear, apple, toast, toffee, biscuit, molasses, nuttiness, light roast, floral, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity of malt notes with light yeast fruitiness. Taste of chocolate, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, pear, apple, light roast, floral, and earthiness. Lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light fruits, light nuttiness, and earthiness on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance and robustness of malt flavors with light-moderate fruitiness; with good complexity and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an damn nice dunkel lager! Great balance and robustness of malt flavors with moderate fruitiness; and extremely smooth to drink. Really enjoyed this one; one of the better examples in the style I have had."

"I have never been a huge negro fan. But I really like this one, it has the right combo of coffee and caramel for me. Sounds crazy but if you have not tried it, make a float with it. A scoop of Blue Bell original vanilla and pour some Lobo Negro over it. Yum!"

"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint/tulip glass. This pours a dark brown almost black with a smaller tan head which quickly dissipates. The smells are of caramel, toffee and nuts. The feel is medium. The taste is okay, a little bitter roasted malts, some toffee, not bad."
"Nice flavor profile too...sweetness is tangible but not overboard and the chocolate flavors are really nice. There is still a bit of nutty, caramel character too. The mouthfeel is a treat; rich and creamy for a lager and the carbonation is really fine-bubbled. Fits the style profile fairly well, but also has a bit of a milk stout aspect to it as well. After a bad introduction to Pedernales (the IPA), the Texas Lager and Negro Lobo have impressed me enough to pick up a sixer next time I see it around."

"Id buy again for sure."
"Found this beer while on our anniversary trip to Fredericksburg Tx. Immediately feel in love with this dark rich double bock? beer. Tried to find it in San Antonio, but no luck.... Smells great smooth taste with a wonderful hint of chocolate caramel flavors. Must try if you can find."

"The beer pours a very dark brown color with an off-white head. The aroma is full of toffee and caramel with some lightly toasted malt and cocoa notes. A very nice smelling beer. The flavor is made up of a lot of roasted malt and cocoa. I also get some toffee, grass and earth notes. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
