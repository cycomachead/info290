The feel isn't too bad, but the flavor is far too bitter and lemony (skunky?). Everything starts out well. There is a brief toffee note up front, but lemony notes take over and really destroy the flavor. Not sure how this beer has such a nice nose, but such a sub-par taste. Perhaps my palate isn't clear or something. I might have to try this one again sometime just to make sure I'm being fair.","deadonhisfeet","Mar 04, 2015"

3.74,7.2,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall I thought it was a pretty nice beer and a above average example of the style, it's just a good tasting Dunkel and it's just what I've come to expect from a German Dunkel.  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, just slightly creamy, not too filling and the taste did a nice job of holding my attention, I could drink more than a few of these and it seems like a fitting beer for the fall season.  What I like the most about this beer was how true to style it was, it's got everything that I look for in a good example of the style.  What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, it wasn't bad, but almost every aspect could have been just slightly better.  I would buy this beer again when I'm in the mood for a good Dunkel and I think it's a must try for anyone who likes the style.  All in all I still enjoy this beer and it seemed to be pretty much just how I remember it.  I haven't tried any other beers from this brewery, but I'm on the look out for them since this one made for a good first impression.  I still think that this is my favorite German made Dunkel.  Good job guys this was one nice Dunkel, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","Oct 15, 2014"

3.54,1.4,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Pint on tap at Beer Revolution in Calgary. Brew arrived a flat chestnut brown hue with a light smattering of tan head. Little head retention. Aroma is roasted malts and sweetness in approximately equal measure, milk chocolate, raisins, and weak coffee with a faint whiff of citrus (?). On the palate, fails to overwhelm but does deliver more low key dark malt flavors with well-rounded corners, nothing harsh or pointed. Some brown spice and dry pepper accompany the raisin and dry cacao from the nose. Some diacetyl and perhaps DMS in there to provide a "light lager" vibe. Rather thin bodied yet moderately carbonated, retains a smooth drinkability I suppose. This would be a great "starter" dark lager for a newbie but most will quickly graduate to more robust flavors.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 06, 2014"

Taste is light bodied with the above flavors coming together which leaves a slightly dry finish. Goes down easy and with perfect carbonation. A really good German brew that is for a cheap price actually. Much better than the regular Warsteiner.","BeerWithMike","May 17, 2014"

Lots of people have tried this in the past and simply never go back. This was a staple in my rotation when I first got into beer, and now comin back to it, I must say it holds up better then most. Bold flavors for a dunkel, yet still very easy to drink. You can get this beer everywhere, even most gas stations carry it. Add to that the low price for a 12-pack, I can get it around me for 10 bucks/per 12. Solid.","screamking","Jun 02, 2013"

Aromas of caramel, chocolate, biscuit, nuttiness, toast, toffee, herbal, pepper, and earth. Pretty nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, chocolate, nuttiness, herbal, earth, and light pepper. Lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, toast, nuttiness, and herbal on the finish for a short bit. Fairly dry and a touch thin on the finish. Fair amount of flavor and robustness; no cloying at all after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. No alcohol presence in the taste or finish. Overall this is a very solid dunkel.

3.18,-8.9,4,3.5,3,3,3," Notes: went into my favorite bottle shop for Warsteiner Premium Verum (German pilsner), found it, and checked a bottle for a freshness date. Turned out the brew should have been drank by Sept 2011 (apparently nobody drinks the stuff around here). Then I saw another row of the brew right next to the bottle I picked up, and checked the dates; Warsteiner Premium Verum good til August 2012...or so I thought. Got home, poured a bottle into my chalice glass, and was very surprised by the dark color. The moral of the story is: double check labels, and don't "pull a mom" (late 90s-early 2000s reference to loving mothers and their attempts to buy regular potato chips and other junk food, but due to the constantly rushed nature of the housewife lifestyle, bring home "reduced fat" or "low sodium" bastardizations of name brands).","DerekP","Jun 03, 2012"

The taste brings in more of the same, with equal intensity (or lack thereof, really), with the added benefit of some light hard water. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a pretty standard dark Euro lager (regardless of city of origin/style), nothing offensive, nothing to really smile about. Definition of a slightly positive meh.","TMoney2591","Nov 06, 2011"

Smelled a bit metallic for the first half of the glass, but overall I don't think it made a huge impact on the taste of the beer. The taste wasn't all that impressive, wasn't bad though. Aftertaste was a light caramel flavor with a bit of chocolate. The mouth feel and taste were alright to begin with but by the end it was almost like I was drinking malt liquor. Not to say that I would bash malt liquor, I mean I grew up on it in high school, but if I buy a German dunkel and that's what I'm expecting, I don't want to suddenly be drinking Colt .45.

Compared to other beers available in supermarkets and convenience stores for the $1.50/bottle mark it's difficult to beat. It's unassuming to a fault--it tastes good but seems too restrained.

The aromatics are solid nothing special, but there is a nice malty aroma, with a hint of corn sugar in the back. The taste was hard to peg. It's got the body of a heavy AAL with some flavorings of a handful of dark roast specialty malts. It's a juxtaposition of flavors in my opinion. One helps and one hurts. So where is the flavor left, somewhere in the not that great realm. The mouthfeel is oddly sticky and cloying but with the body is light on the palate. I'm not really a fan of how dry this beer finishes as well. The drinkability is decent. I thought it was a decent beer overall to enjoy. There was absolutely nothing special or offputting about this beer, it was just beer. It's hard to describe, much else on this beer.","Vdubb86","Mar 05, 2011"
3.26,-6.6,4,3,3.5,2,3.5,"Pours a dark chestnut brown with a thin, creamy off-white head. The aroma is pleasant but understated with a faint grainy sweetness. The taste is much more pronounced, with a dominant malt base that features flavors of cereal grains, cherry sweetness, and maybe even a bit of weak coffee and raisins. Although certainly crisp and clean, the prickly, fine carbonation is almost distracting. Overall, this is a solid, crisp, drinkable beer.

However, having discovered the Premium Dunkel, Warsteiner's dark, I've been in heaven. It has that slightly bitter after taste like Guiness, but not as strong or as overpowering, yet still yielding that deep and rich flavor that only a dark beer can offer. So, unlike Guiness, one can put away several of these whereas one can only consume a couple of Guiness stouts. If you haven't tried it, I highly recommend it.","vadertime","Dec 20, 2010"

Mouthfeel is the saving grace of this beer: medium, crisp, a little creamy, moderate carbonation, some spice on the palate, lasting dryness.

Poured a nice dark brown with a big three inch plus foamy tan head coming across the top. Lots of carbonation and side glass lace throughout. Very malty semll, not alot of profile in the aroma. Taste was very dark, lots of sweet malty grains and a touch of cereal. Good dry finidh. Very smooth with good carbonation.

While the presentation was nice the aroma just seemed to be missing something, I was able to pick up the scent of malts which seemed to be somewhat sweet with a slightly caramel aroma maybe slightly roasted. The taste was fair, again with the taste it seemed to be missing something, just did not have flavors that carried its way through. The flavors that I pick up are a sweet malt flavor that just seems slightly blah to me, also finishes noticeably dry which is not a bad thing.

Plenty of Saaz flavor, mabye some Hallertau as well. Dry aftertaste, again all noble- malty sweetness and hop bitterness are balanced and very agreeable.

It could have much more flavor the verum does, but I think the roasted flavor actually contributes to this. Kind of a dull thin mouthfeel. Not especially drinkable for a lager. Not a bad beer, but I was much more impressed with the Vahrshteiner verum so I'll probably get that instead next time.

This starts off like your average american lager, then a small dose of hops hits and finishes with a welcome mild malt flavor. Very clean mouthfeel, somewhat watery. I could drink this all day. Not a great beer, but a good session brew with nothing offensive going on.","avylover","Dec 27, 2003"

3.51,0.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"When poured into a glass you get a nice almost meriange like lite tan head. A light malt aroma can be gotten by slightly swirlling the beer. As the beer hits your mouth you get, again, a light roasted malt. That malt note finishes just ever so sweet and clean on the finish. Not as exteremly flavorful as I generaly like but a nice clean tasting beer that is definitely a step above the Mega brews.","ybnorml","Nov 22, 2003"
2.5,-28.4,4,4,1.5,2,2.5,"Overall, a dissappointing beer. Starts out looking and smelling great, with a nice head, good lacing, reddish brown color, and an aroma dominated by spicy Saaz hops...then the moment of truth. The taste lacks any character but water! What is going on here? It is a frustrating experience. This stuff is drinkable, but damn, you'd think the flavors would be more assertive!","EagleTalon","Nov 15, 2003"
3.4,-2.6,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,4,"This dunkel begins with an attractive beige head that slowly diminishes to a thin ring; the lacing doesn't quite stick for the duration. The aroma hints at raisins, molasses and nuts that aren't as evident in the slightly roasted malt taste. The colour of a dark sherry and light-bodied on the palate, the taste of Warsteiner Dunkel isn't as robust as I was expecting but it goes down easily and I'd probably buy it again.","mwrseeley","Nov 15, 2003"
3.65,4.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"A clear, russett brown body is capped by a short head of creamy, off-white foam that holds well before dropping to a thin collar. The nose is clean with the exception of some slight lager yeast sulphur. It offers a light note of dark kilned malt, but it's neither chocolatey or roasty. Its medium body and fine, median carbonation leave it gently crisp and smooth in the mouth. The flavor reveals a bit more chocolate and dark caramel than the nose suggests (but not much more), and an edge of floral/grassy hops rounds it out. It finishes dry with some light residual bitterness and a mild, lingering, dark maltiness.","NeroFiddled","Nov 01, 2003"
3.38,-3.2,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"On draught at the German Village Oktoberfest. Dark reddish-brown with a thin beige head. The aroma is lightly nutty.

However it lacks any real character or complexity.","Dogbrick","Oct 06, 2003"

Hop aroma is lightly floral but is too mild to be noteworthy. Very malty and grainy, an exceptionally smooth mouthfeel with no hint of bitterness or roughness. Some coffee and caramel like undertones. A good well rounded and drinkable session beer.","rajendra82","Aug 30, 2003"

Looks absolutely lovely when poured, a nice deep brown color. Not a whole lot in the way of smell, but it tastes pretty good, goes down smooth, and leaves almost nothing in the way of an aftertaste.

This Dunkel poured a fairly nondescript brown with a modest head that dissipated quickly, and not much lace remained. The smell was sweet and malty but not very complex or interesting. The taste was much of the same. It was very difficult to pick out one strong or dominant flavor, but there were slight hints of fruit and perhaps chocolate. The mouthfeel was not great, fairly light bodied, with moderate carbonation. All in all I would call this a just slightly above average beer that was enjoyable enough, but I probably wouldn't seek it out.","BittRnessabounds","Apr 27, 2003"

The taste is quite pronounced with a very strong roasted malt taste, almost chocolate in character. Impressive. Hoppiness is there, but hard to detect over the malt. Sweet, heavy finish. I liked this. This almost approaches the Porter category, like a watered down Guiness. I will buy this again for a strong, full bodied German dark lager. Forget Beck's or St. Pauly dark. This is a distinct and bold beer. I get this for $9.99 for 12 bottles.","Rifrafboy","Feb 08, 2003"
3.68,5.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This beer was dark brown but lacked a good head - of course that could because of the time lag between pour and being served by waitress. The aroma was mild with a no hoppiness in the nose. The flavor balanced malts and hops but the hop bitterness stung the tongue slightly. The mouthfeel was light to moderate. The beer was very drinkable although it was mild in all aspects. I would say this is a middling Dunkel","LarryKemp","Jan 29, 2003"
3.85,10.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Deep brown to near-black in color, fine off-white head , but leaves very quickly. Soft, sweet aromas, hints of cocoa, raisins, nuts. Slightly harsh initial mouthfeel, light body, minimal texture, a little gritty, a little flinty. Very little character in this beer , not quite the flavor or sweetness one usually finds in the better dunkels. Something's missing, and we'll freely quote from Homer Simpson. "Hello? Taste?"","feloniousmonk","Jan 15, 2003"
3.21,-8,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This dunkel pours a dark ruby brown, and pours with a pretty nice cream colored head that doesn't stick around very long. The aroma is very faint with some malt and darker roasts that come out along with a mild hop character. A very well-balanced taste that combines some dark roasts to produce a nice sweetness in the flavor with a rather light body to it, very drinkable. I enjoy the aftertaste it leaves on the tongue, with nothing to complex a quite enjoyable session beer.","WVbeergeek","Jan 08, 2003"

Not much head, but it is bubbley, almost like champaigne(sp?). A little expensive, but it's good. I had a bro from the land of the Germs say that it was our equivlent to Budweiser.","JISurfer","Dec 27, 2002"
3.07,-12,3,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Clearish cocoa-brown, fairly large 1/2 inch head that fizzes down in big pockets. Nutty aroma, mostly of hazelnuts, slight acidity. Malty smooth and somewhat stiffling to the nose and tongue, as many Dunkels are to me. Slightly vinous hop finish with sweetness continuing into the aftertaste. Eh, OK, certainly easy to drink but not one I would seek out any time soon.","ADR","Dec 27, 2002"
2.78,-20.3,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,"Pours a deep reddish brown, with a loose off-white head. It exhibits good head retention and leaves a nice lace on the glass. Very hoppy, floral aroma with a hint of malt. The classic "beer" aroma . The flavor is rather light, with some hop bitterness on the finish with some roasted flavors. A slight metallic edge in the aftertaste gives me a somewhat "stale" feeling about the flavor. The mouthfeel is very light, while the large bubbles of carbonation give it a harsh edge in the mouth. Due to the slightly "off" flavor and aftertaste coupled with the light mouthfeel, drinkability suffers for me. Nice to try, but I probably will never buy again (actually, this one was given to me by a friend for an opinion). Seems like it is brewed to appeal to the American masses, rather than the German beer drinker.","aaronh","Dec 12, 2002"

Mostly sweet malt aroma in the nose with caramel to back it up, and pleasant enough. Begins sweet and the top skeletal in mouth feel, the finish is curtly acidic, pertinently hopped with the aftertaste dry. Very clean and crisp on the palate, a good beer for when your just plain thirsty.","Gusler","Dec 06, 2002"

Toffee - like caramel sweetness in aroma w/ a very mild spicy continental hop nose.  Smooth & agreeable mouthfeel.  Lightly bodied and a bit weak in malt complexity.  Lightly roasted malt flavors dominate.  Hop bitterness is mild, but adequately balances the malt sweetness. Finishes w/ more light and clean roasted flavors.
