The nose is comprised mostly of sweet malt along with a bit of caramel. Some hops in the background. Something quite odd about it. This continues into the taste, which is a bit too sweet without much of anything other than mild hops to carry it through. Body is light with moderate carbonation. Butter starts to come through as it warms. Probably not something I'd drink again, but who doesn't love a good canned beer?","Thorpe429","Feb 02, 2011"

3.23,-10.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Crackery pilsner malts lead the way, while hints of toasted caramel balance nicely with a spiciness from German hops. A slightly off-putting metallic sourness on the finish suggests copper, sulfur, and nickel. Mouthfeel is a bit too creamy for a lager, and the minerals don't do much to help the highly carbonated finish. All in all, a decent attempt, but I'd probably pass on this one in the future. Since this is the first Sly Fox brew I've been able to try, I won't be giving up on them, as something tells me they can do better.","wagenvolks","Feb 26, 2009"

It is crisp and dry and makes for easy drinking.","yesyouam","Nov 12, 2008"

Smell is light and sweet with carmelized almonds and and bread. Very faint noble hops with honey and grass in the nose as well. Taste begins with a touch of lemon and solid nutty backbone. Midway the sweetl malts emerge with notes of caramel and cocoa powder. Aftertaste is bready with some roasted malts, pretty good. Light and creamy body with a steady carbonation. A nice mouthfeel which almost feels like a session beer. Some of this and Pikeland Plis would be perfect for 18 holes.

3.08,-14.7,3,2.5,3.5,3,3,"When poured into a Victory pint glass, the Sly Fox is a almost clear chestnut amber color that had a 1/2 inch head of white foam. It didn't take the head of foam very long to dissipate into a few islands of white bubbles, white bubbly rings along the edge, and spots of white lace. The aroma was mostly filled with sweet juicy fruits and a slight pinch of caramel here and there. That was it. When it warmed up quite a bit, the aroma stayed the same. It didn't want to change. The taste started off minor with sweet roasted malts and a small dab of sweet caramel. After the sweetness had left the tongue, in comes the crispy citrus hops with a smidge of grapefruit behind it. The mouthfeel was light with a lightly sweet and crispy aftertaste of roasted malts, caramel, and a handfull of citrus hops. The most interesting thing about this beer is the fact that it comes in a can. The beer itself is pretty much a decent Dunkel Lager.","AltBock","Feb 24, 2008"

The color was deep-amber with NE-quality clarity. The mouthfeel was medium-to-full and there was a rolling mix of malty-sweetness, roasty-chocolate, and slightly bitter hops on the tongue.

Even a couple low raters said ""better than a macro"" but didn't push higher on the score. Seems to be nothing to really hate, but maybe not anything particulary unique to really fall in love with.

The brew goes down pretty well good, maybe a little too sweet but has a nice nutty flavor, some cocoa and caramel, with a slight hop break at the tail end. Overall this is a pretty good brew, to me it has a sweetness, at least that is what I am perceiving it as, that tends to make this a brew that I could enjoy only one or two at a single sitting.

Their beers used to be merely a treat I could find when we made our way down to New Jersey. Even then, I don't remember seeing the Dunkel Lager anywhere down there. So...Poured into a footed pilsner glass, I have before me a caramel-amber colored brew with an expressive and fluffy newsprint-hued head. Spicy, almost gamey, noble hop aromas that remind me of tarragon and sage, along with some very muted dark bread dough scents. Biscuity malts appear in the taste, bringing with them some sweetish caramel notes and the aforementioned hop spice flavors. This would kill with some good grilled Kielbasa, I bet. Great, noble hop flavors/scents buzz the nostrils during the burps. Light in body, smooth and crisp mouthfeel, lager-clean as well. A damn solid beer. I think I may have found a new session lager. In a word, kick-ass.","orfeu","Jan 15, 2007"

3.68,1.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Definitely great to visit a new beer establishment in the Burgh and see the newest offerings from small breweries on stock along with 400 other micro, belgian, and german beers...this was the case at Bocktown beer and grille. The first German style dunkel I've ever imbibed from a can appears a dark copper amber tone with a large cream head leaves behind fine even lacing all around my glass with each sip. Definitely a different color than the king of all American brewed dunkel lagers...Penn Dark but I will accept this one. Aromatics...somewhat funky character some grassy noble hops it really smells unique for the style, also has mild chocolate and toasty caramel malt highlights but the tart mild lactic character has me scratching my head. It didn't turn me off just really caught me off guard for a dunkel. Flavors combine well, and that slight tart funky malt acidity actually works with a balancing hearty bready sweet malt tone doused with a finishing blast of noble herbal hop character with a delicate grassy character. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied evenly carbonated really is quaffable and smooth textured. Drinkability much like their other canned offerings not the most intriguing and well made versions but damn drinkable along with enough original tones to make it a go to when grabbing canned micros with the limited niche market these should sell without a problem.","WVbeergeek","Dec 04, 2006"
