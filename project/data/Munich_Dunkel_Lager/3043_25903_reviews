"I drink this beer often on draft but I believe this is the first bottle I've ever had. It's a really enjoyable, drinkable, and affordable import. The flavor profile shows a ton of depth while staying easy drinking and fairly light. Many 1/2 liters of this has, could, and will be had by me in the future."

"Pours a clear, deep brown with a yellowish-tan head that dissipates quickly, leaving little lacing. Lots of things going on in the aroma, especially as it warms a bit. Bready Munich malt, chocolate, molasses, nutty and a strong sweet smell. Taste: The first thing that comes to mind is that this is not a Munich Dunkel style. Thereâ€™s some rye malt character there with a weaker hop profile, much like a Euro Dark Lager. Whether it fits the Munich Dunkel taste profile exactly or not, this is a great beer, in my opinion! Grainy, bready flavors with hints of dark chocolate, brown sugar and ripe fruity flavors. Medium bodied with a light-to-medium carbonation level, making it silky smooth. No alcohol warmth detected. Paired very nicely with the warm, buttered pumpernickel I had with it. Overall, this was a great beer for a great price! I paid $2.39 for a single 16.9 oz. bottle. I will definitely grab this one again."
"O: Just an average dunkel beer, but for a price of just over $2, I would say it met my expectations, though I won't be rushing out to get it again as there are a lot of other dunkel beers I would rather have and pay more for."

"O: decent overall brew with subtle flavors"
""
"Pours a very dark brown with a slight off-white head. There is a mild scent of hops and malts but nothing too strong. The taste is ever so slightly heavy in taste but not by much. There is a decent combination of hops, malts, and yeast to make a dark beer that drinks fairly easy. Although it drinks well, it really could use some work in flavor department as the taste is kind of bland. For a small city, this was a rather interesting find."
"I would love to try this on tap or closer to the source."
""
"Beer is medium-light to light bodied, with medium-high levels of carbonation that foams the beer up substantially on contact with the palate. Resulting mouthfeel is at first fizzy, then smooth and creamy. Finishes wet, with little residual stickiness around palate or lips."
""
"Overall, a very drinkable beer, slightly on the sweet side. Wish that tangy finish was more subtle."
""

"It's a bit less rich than the style. Picture a schwarzbier malt richness with munich dunkel flavor profile and you're pretty close. Might have been thinned a bit by age?"
"Try saying this beer's name several times fast. Fun. Anyway, it pours a clear sienna topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises dark fruit, very light roasted malts, light toffee, and raisins. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some extra roast, a touch of toasted bread, and a sprig of light clove. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a smooth, wet feel. Overall, a very nice Munich dunkel, easy-drinking and tasty. Good times."
"Very enjoyable. Looks amazing and smelled and tasted great. Tough to beat."
"(O) Tasted a lot like a quad. It was good, but nothing out of this world. Has a really good flavor. Definitely would drink this one again."
""
"(D)- This is a solid, easy drinking beer while still maintaining some deep/rich belgian flavors."
"Overall I love this beer. Probably the best dunkel lager I've experienced. Just a killer beer. Reasonable price too. I gotta get more of this!"
"Pretty good dark euro lager (what I'm judging against) but nothing memorable."
"O - This is an okay Munich Dunkel Lager. Easy drinking and pretty tasty."
"A well put-together dunkel. I would like to try more beers from this brewery, this & the Pils are both solid brews"
"Poured a capped 500ml bottle into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a deep mahogany brown with a massive 3 inch creamy cap that leaves some pretty substantial lacing down the sides of the glass. Good start. The aroma starts off with a little overly toasted bread with just a little bit of coffee and dry mocha powder. Nice roasted aroma but fairly one dimensional. The flavor continues that line. Nice roasted flavor starts off. Toasted bread with just a little chocolate powder mixed with with this odd underlying sweetness. Not sugary per say but almost like a generic grape juice sweetness. Just a touch of ripe tree fruits. No perceivable hop presence. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy with just a bit of dryness at the finish. While I'm a huge fan of crisp, clean lagers, I feel that this one is just a bit one dimensional."
"A delicate and highly drinkable beer. With a slight vegital taste, the beer hides its flaws well and is cause for subtle enjoyment."
"The first thing that is impressive about this beer is an outstanding dark, ruby/garnet color. The head is rich and generous with excellent retention and even, thin lacing. The smell is sublime - roasted malt, chocolate, and caramel wafting above clean, light hops and slight hints of fruit. The flavor profile is fantastic, lighter than expected but quite rich. Mainly I get roasted malts and cocoa, but it washes down with a very refreshing lightness. It is actually very hard to describe the flavors hiding in this complex beer. There are some fruit undertones and a hint of very mellow hops, but it is all very subtle. The enjoyment is there is every sip, though. There are no downsides, and I can find nothing that detracts from the great flavor. The body is medium and the mouth feel is superb. Of course, I was lucky enough to have this on tap, and I understand from talking to others that this is definitely a ""better on tap"" beer. Or, maybe all beers are, after all? Please track this down and try it if at all possible."
"Drinkability: A touch too much for regular consumption for this buckaroo. But not a waste."
"EDIT: My rating on Morchl appears to be pretty low. The thing is? I *like* this style quite a bit, and was trying to be fair here, and trying hard not to 'over-rate' / rate it too highly! C'est la Vie. This is definitely an above average beer, and I'd say it's well-worth your time to seek out a fresh bottle."
"D-Easy! So smooth that I was willing to bet I could chug this beer without a problem. You'd have to know me to be surprised by that I suppose. The alcohol content and the characteristics of this beer make it a solid choice. I'd do it again in a heart beat."
"Taste: Little caramel with some unsweetened cocoa powder. Not too bad. Hops in the finish are very mild, kinda herbal."
"O: A nice example of the style. Not as drinkable as some, but full of flavor and worth a taste."
"D: Definitely drinkable as a session beer."
"A fine upstanding beer! Surprised at how good it is given its modest $2.49 price tag. Will not only seek this out again but will buy a lot!"
"D: Easy-to-drink, malt-forward lager. Modest spice and roast, fairly forgettable flavors yet quite drinkable. Low ABV helps, but generally 'good' scores across the board don't hurt at all. A stein and a plate of sauerbraten or schnitzel sounds pretty good after this. Very much worth a try."
"I would not recommend this to anyone."
"Note: After reviewing my reviews (ha!) I noticed that this is the only beer of its style that I've ever given score much over a 3.0 Seriously, this is in a whole 'nother league than the rest. I know its only 5% ABV, but this is like an ""Imperial Munich Lager"" or something!"
"D-Very drinkable. The relatively light body lends this beer its ease of drinking. Plus, it's quite tasty, indeed!"
"This beer produced a nice head when poured; however, the foam quickly dissipated and left me with nothing. In contrast, the beer is nicely carbonated and the bubbles dance across my tongue. The aroma is malty and musty; thus, not very appealing. Despite the funky aroma, the flavor is very malty from start to finish. I also detect a note of black pepper and other spices. Fine drinkability. In fact, I've been able to get my cheap beer drinking friends to enjoy this brew."
"Not a big flavorful beer--dunkels are simple affairs, mostly. This is a fairly nice one."
"This brew pours a dark brown, almost opaque, with a creamy off-white head that dissipates to a thin film. Carbonation is medium, but very pleasing. Aromas are biscuity, with hints of caramel. The flavor is almost identical, yet intense. It finishes slightly dry with a mild hop bite. For a dark lager, it's lighter bodied than others I have had. It's very easy to drink and it makes a great a great session beer."
"mmmm, very nice beer! Got this bottle at Sam's in Chi a couple of weeks ago. Poured with a huge, textured, foamy, and frothy tan head and lots of lace. Color is a nice dark walnut. Aroma is malty with toffee and mild. Flavor is similar with some lurking sweetness. Great body with fine carbonation and soft mouth goes very well with flavor. Nice easy finish. Session beer."
"a nice dark lager with a very consistent malt. i have found the fresher the better. off chocolate milk head of about 3 fingers. coca cola color with not much murk really. a heavy odor bread when agitated. mild otherwise. apple malt which carries over to something a bit sour on the palate. there is some dough some chocolate and an ever more present smoke as the beer get warmer. this bring out the acidic quality of the beer. not as good at higher temperatures."
"This beer pours a nearly opaue dark brown color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a firm cap of lacing. The aroma is of toffee, and caramel. The taste is more forthcoming than the aroma. Toffee, dark chocolate, and caramel. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a nice Muchen Dunkel that I would love to drink again."
"The remarkably dry finish of this beer really seals the deal for me. I think that this is a stunning rendition of the dunkel style."
"A rather nice beer. I would buy this again. It's not as strong or heavy as a dopplebock, nor as light as a bock, but I like the dark fruits and molasses. Recommended, reasonably priced."
"Drinkability: Hirter? I hardly know 'er!"
"Pours a brownish/black - with a small almost non existent head. Smells sweet and caramely with a strong alcohol note. First sip is pure caramel - sweet, sweet and more sweet. Finishes nice and bitter, carbonated well. If you like caramelized sweet beers, you will not be disappointed."
"Not bad."
"When I bought this bottle in KCMO I never seen it before or heard of it. I thought it was a Baltic Porter because the label says ""malt liquor"" and ""dark beer."" I just made the assumption. Oh well. I liked this beer well enough (and it was cheap) but, really, it is not something I'll buy again. On second thought... this beer is growing on me. It is pretty darn tasty."
"This is certainly a beer worth trying if you can find it, but unfortunately, it isn't a beer worth seeking out. It came so close, which is actually more of a letdown than a beer that is just OK."
"The taste is one of the best I have had for this type of beer. Very subtle balances of malt, caramel and oak(I think?). It is also a tad bit sweet but not over the top. All the tastes are just right. The mouthfeel is just right as well. Good carbonation and nice finish. A very satisfying brew."
"we all like this beer"
"Make no mistake, though, this beer has made it in as one of my current favorites. Others may prefer a more subtle drink, but this beer clubbed me over the head and dragged me back to her cave!"
"Even though Morchl is less than good beer, it's better than the only other Brauerei Hirt offering that I've had so far (Privat Pils). If it wasn't for the label dating, I would have pointed to age as the culprit for the crime of mediocrity. Since the brewery was kind enough to be consumer friendly, they have no excuses that will hold up."
"For as rich and full-tasting as the beer is, there is a slight thinness to the brew. A tad slick on the finish. Not my favorite style by a long-shot but easy enough to drink if it's your bag. A good, not great, take on a German standard; those wacky Austrians..."
"Served an tap at the Map Room."
"overall a nice dark lager from austria."
"Pours a clear pinkish brown under a 3/4 finger beige head that lasts forever but still fails to generate any lace. The nose is mild but very enticing, with clear if not strong sweet caramel tones. The mouth is well carbonated and quite sticky, coating all sides with a viscous coating that prolongs the taste sensation. And the taste is quite good. Slightly roasted malt and a bit of sweetness at first yield to a slightly burnt espresso bitter aftertaste that lingers very well. This is definitely not your average Viennese Dunkel - it has spirit and character. Easily my favorite bottled Austrian beer after 2.5 months of fairly intensive research."
