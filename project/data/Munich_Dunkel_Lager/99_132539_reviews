"O- drinkable, but doesn't quite mesh like the classic German examples"
""
"I enjoyed this beer from a bottle.  Was good copper color with nice malty aromas.  Tasted good, but was hoping for a tad more alcohol to warm me on the cool winter evening."

"Smell is caramel malt. Taste is grainy and sweet. Medium mouthfeel. Overall a decent lager but could use more flavor."

"12 oz bottle best by March 31, 2015.  A dunkel lager, relatively dark smooth lager.  Decent and enjoyable."
"Serving type: bottle"
"The taste is also sweet and malty with a quick, clean finish. Nothing special but not difficult to drink."
""
"Just ok. Not really loving it."
"Very basic dunkel.  Watery and needed more flavor."

"This had a very clean light nose.  Nutty sweet malt and soft caramel.  The color is excellent. Aglow with a lovely copper hue.  Good head of tan foam that fell well.  Taste is clean crisp a bit bitter in the finish.  The sweetness is good and there's a bite from carbonation.  The hops jump inmid palate with some herbal and finish it with a touch of bitterness alongside a cool dark brown sugar.  Crisp end."

"people really seem to be digging this beer this year, and saranac certainly seems to be pushing it, with twelves, sixes and a mixed pack appearance, they appear to have found one they like, kind of their answer to sams winter lager i guess, but i really didnt care for this all that much. to me, its generic, overly malty, and never crisp enough in the finish. that said though, it is a little something different, with a rich but dry malt base, copper and caramel in color, and with fine carbonation. it just doesnt seem to develop like a lager should, and frankly isnt anything worth getting excited over. its got a little too much body for sessioning, but i could see it as a crowd pleaser and a good cooking beer. ive been impressed with recent saranac releases, but this one is nothing special at all."

"Overall, its an ok beer, but not up to the usual high standards for some of the other Saranac lagers."

"Light flavor, light taste head gone in seconds, lots of bubbles. Very simple IMO. Carmel flavor is there but not too strong."
""
"Pours a highly carbonated dark red, very little head. Smells slightly fruity, a little carmely malt, honestly not much going on up here. Taste is disappointingly similar, not too much going on here. Strong, hearty malt backbone, but like most dunkels, that's all it offers. It's a very drinkable malty beer. Good for the winter, and overall a solid brew, but nothing I'd seek out. Go for roastier and darker."

"wow this beer lacks everything  that a good beers has it doesnt good its doesnt stand out in a crownd it doesnt make me want to drink it it makes me want to pour down arain saranac disappionts me too much not going here every again"

"Overall, not bad for a new beer from a Saranac holiday sampler."
""
""
"Pours dark amber with good head and excellent lacing retention. Bready malt aroma. Nuts and bread on the nose. A bit of lager hop notes mid-palate with some nice malt and barley. Slight dry bitterness on the back palate. Good malt and nut aftertaste. Most winter lagers rely on spice and some citrus. This takes it back to an older English style brown lager. Refreshing and still fittingly right for the colder months. 3.5 out of 5. Good."
