"meh, ok, kinda muddled, maybe it was old."

"It's pretty light in the body but leading medium, still deep and well textured. The crispness isn't too biting but remains firm the whole way through, while its cleanness is notable. It's smooth, too, and the light dryness balances the feel."
"Good Dunkel."

"A real solid dunkel lager, luckily feel even better dodging the green bottle of death (it appeared brown should have looked at the bottle cap neck closely I would have known better."

"O: Just as in the pilsner, the husky grain gets to me. It would be a more enjoyable beer if not for that. Could use a little more carbonation too."

"O: very good exemplar of style."

"Poured into a pokal a chesnut brown with a nice tight looking off white head that hung around for quite awhile.Aromas of mineral,toast,and cookie douogh,not very sweet wich is good.Tastes of German malts with that hint of iron with more cookie dough and breadiness in the finish.A tad thinner than what I like but it's a damn fine weekend outdoor grilling quaffer with nice flavors."
"M & O- Moderate carb bite. Very well balanced. I'm happy this was my first Dunkel!"
"The body was medium, for the style, not as heavy as some, was clean, and had, considering the sweetness, a relatively dry finish. Drinkability was good, the beer was gone fairly quickly, and I'd have another. Overall, a decent example of the style, not special or notable, but if you're in the mood, you could do worse."

"Pours a clear orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and caramel. Taste is much the same with a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is pretty tasty and easy to drink."

"Overall this is an extremely good beer and I really would love to drink some more at any time."

"Overall a pretty good brew, but I think it wasn't as fresh as I'd liked it to be, hence the skunk smell. Great flavor and drinkability though."

"It wasn't what I thought at first but regardless, I like this organic example of the style!"

"From the 11.2 fl. oz. US bottle marked 11:04...B26. Sampled on April 19, 2012. It pours a deep, dark amber brown with a huge, foamy beige head that slowly diminishes. The aroma on this beer is outrageously sweet and malty and has this German nutty characteristic. The body is right around medium. I was hoping for something bolder. The taste is vibrant with malty sweetness and a mellow bitterness to balance things out. It reminds me a bit of Newcastle Brown Ale with a slightly more bitter note. It is a likable beer and one that I could drink often."

"Light-bodied but not watery; medium-low carbonation; just a touch of creaminess, extremely drinkable. There's something distinctly different about the malt in this beer that's giving me fits as I try to describe it. Nevertheless, I would recommend this one readily as a sessionable, non-bloating lighter beer that has the added attraction (to some) of being organically produced."
"Overall it is excellent very well done very session-able, would be wonderful to have a keg of this for everyday drinking. ant to thank merlin48 for this one, he said it was good and he wasn't lying."
"Clean (as one would expect from a brewery priding itself on purity and organic products), well crafted example of the style. Delicious yet light."
"Drain pour. First bad beer I've had from this brewery."
"D - Probably one of the better dunkels I've had. Has the drinkability of your typical pilsner with tasty darker maltiness, displaying near perfect balance. Pretty good overall."
"Exceptional drinkability. Light enough in abv and body to session while offering excellent taste. Clean and well balanced. I can't imagine how you coud improve on a Dunkel."
"D - It's a pretty solid, but ultimately unremarkable Munich Dunkel. It's pretty easy to drink, and I'd have it again if I were at a German beer garden or restaurant."
"D - It's okay, low drinkability for the ABV. I'm not a huge fan of this, honestly."
":)"
"For a beer style that has less wiggle room than others, this one is not only a benchmark beer for the style, but a stellar example as well. So clean and flavorful, each sip makes you want another."
"D: There's nothing to hold you back from downing this beer very quickly."
"D - Very drinkable. This is an excellent beer well worth your time."
"Pours a clear, dark brown/red. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. There is also suspended sediment present. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, grain, pale malt, slight oatmeal sweetness, and yeast. Fits the style of a Munich Dunkel Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, pale malt, yeast, hint of grain, hint of oatmeal, and a hint of hops. Overall, a light and refreshing brew. There is a strong sweetness, but not of a cloying nature."
"Drinkability? Oh hell yes. This was a 4 pack, and I bought a single. I would have killed all 4 had I made the jump. Good stuff."
"Got it for my birthday from my parents, surprisingly they got a few things I've never tried and this is one of them."
"Overall a decent beer - somewhat of a novelty being a certified organic German dunkel. I think I want to try this again (would love to try it on tap)."
"A good easy drinker for a hot summer day."
"Lighter end of medium body with a crisp, clean mouthfeel, soft carbonation, roasted maltiness and bitter hops. Hints of caramel malt, chocolate, nut, toffee and earthy bitter hops. Dry finish."
"D- Overall, this is a pretty solid Dunkel that is worth a try."
"Dug it. This is an exemplary session beer, dunkel lager and definitely something that I would love to have around often."
"Neumarkter Lammsbräu continues to restore my faith in German beer. I will be drinking again."
"Drinkability: Far too malty without any hop balance; under-attenuated"
"D- Pretty easy to drink and I think a decent example of the style but I probably wont pick it up again."
"Drinkability: PQR ratio is very decent, but i cant help but think this should be a lighter drink. The chocolate and sweetness makes it cloying and the low carbonation doesn't help aswell. Could use more roastiness and other types of dark flavors to balance the chocolate taste, give it more depth and make it less heavy."
"Drinkability: Skip it. For me, this one just comes across as entirely too thin in all of its attributes. Next time I'm in the mood for a Dunkel, I'll do myself a favor and have an Ayinger Altbairisch, thanks."
"Truly exceptional. I wonder what a keg of this costs and if my customer base at work would be willing to pay for it by the pint?"
"Pours a dark brown that is nearly clear. Nose is thick and sweet cloying malts. Flavor is malty sweet as well. Cloying, yes. Smooth, fairly. Some fruit tones, but mostly what I notice is an odd burn on the flavor profile. Seems almost alcoholic, but isn't really. Feel is smooth on liquid and lower on carbonation. This is okay I suppose. Too cloying though, and I wouldn't go for it again."
"As for being ""...dedicated to environmental responibility, sustainable agriculutre..."" why the hell would you go organic? You need significently more land to produce the same yields. At least it's produced for ""your enjoyment", and that's what matters the most for the consumer."
"This one wasn't really my thing. Got too sweet on me after awhile. I guess some people love it, but for me it was nothing special. Tastes were just sort of off and mouthfeel was flat."
"D: A very nice dunkel beer, the Bros recommended it in their last issue, and I concur, very well done."
"This is usually one of my favourite styles. That said, I have had quite a few Munich Dunkel Lagers in my lifetime. This one does not resemble any of them. The colour is a bit lighter than it should be, IMO. The head was about a half inch tall and vanished into nothing in less time than it took to type this sentence. Smell was malty and marginally close to what other Munich Darks smell like, but really wasn't very impressive. Taste was average at *best*, but again, there are many examples of this style that much better represent the Munich Dark. I'm just not feeling the Lammsbrau version of one of my all time favourite styles. Mouthfeel is noticeably too thin, and of course, given all these negatives, this is simply not very drinkable to me. Not an awful beer, but in the way of Munich Darks, there are many offerings out there much, much better IMO."
"Overall: Decent beer! Not what I expected at first but then again that's usually the case with dunkel's for me. Buy it."
"The taste is earthy grain, leaves, hitns of coffee chocolate, and licorice. It's dryish, zesty, lightly sweet up front then becoming lightly bitter and drier by the finish. Nice, clean, crisp, light, and smooth, it has lasting flavour, subtle complexity, and is engaging and easy to drink."
"It feels smooth and substantial in the mouth. It actually appears significantly more carbonated than it feels. Slight tingle and otherwise creamy. Definitely no slouch here. Finish is somewhat dry. I thought about drinkability briefly before I noticed where my beer was. It begs you to drink more. You look at the lacing, the sudsy foam and the distinct dark amber colour and you just want more. I could (but won't) get plastered off this one without even noticing it. It's good stuff, every last bit of it. Not bitter by any means. You just want more as you go. Bottoms up, boys!"
"Overall: I really did not appreciated this one and could not see why the fuss about this dunkel. Perhaps it was a bad batch as the bottle was very near its expiration date."
"Complex enough to keep it interesting beyond one serving, it's also quite easy to drink as it's not overdone with flavor, and its smooth carbonation and body don't fill you up. Certainly worth trying!"
"Dark amber/ nut brown appearance with a cream colored head. Delicious aroma of toffee, nuts, and lightly toasted pumpernickel. The flavor is a very dry, nutty toffee-like affair with a marked smoothness. The hops serve to balance the malts and go a little step further to dry it out on the finish, making this beer very drinkable. You get deep rich malt flavor in a medium bodied package that does not cloy. In an era of beers that cater to palettes that were raised on soft drinks, this dunkel is a glorious reminder of the heyday of Germany's beer reputation."
"Drinkability is a no brainer, this makes Munich proud and I'm glad to know about Menzel and his talents!!!"
"Overall a very tasty dunkel. Welcome to the United States."
"Neumarkter Lammsbräu is aiming to come into the US market in 2008. I really hope they export this beer as not only is this a great Dunkel, but it's a fantastic organic beer."
"I've been a lover of all things malt for the last few years and this beer was one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. Deep ruby color, rich malty smell and a fantastic malty/bready taste. Very easy to drink. If you have the chance to get a hold of this beer don't make sure you take advantage of it, you'll be glad you did."
"Pours a dark brown with beautiful reddish hues and a bubbly off white head dissipates quickly. Smells of caramel, brown sugar, dark fruits, plums come to mind. Slight grain in the nose. Taste is sweet, caramel and dark fruits, slight bready grain, lingering burnt sugar in the finish, no hops at all. Creamy smooth mouth, medium level of carbonation, thick body. Not a bad beer, but I'm just not blown away like I was before."
"I wish every German import would taste this fresh or at least close to it, a superb Dunkel that is extremely drinkable and packed with flavor. A beer Neumarkter Lammsbräu Dunkel is a real reason to visit Germany, not just the yearly fest in Munich."
"(Bottle, trade with joss in Germany). Organic! Reddish brown colour, very good head. Roasted malts, toast, caramel, oak and pine wood in the aroma, some smokiness. Flavour is all malts + a slight smokiness, nice bitterness, well balanced. This is a very good dunkel!"
