"I'm not all that familiar with Dunkel as a style but I think this beer is great. Plenty of flavour, really drinkable and moreish."

"Caramel, coffee, honey. Full and very nicely balanced, not on the sweet side, like Tucher Dunkel. There may be better Dunkels out there, like Weltenburger's, but this one is very good, right beside Budwar's."

"Overall- Ok, I was expecting more but it was a bit of a let down"

"O - a very good beer that, as my first Dunkel Lager, leaves a strong impression. I would come back to this over and over again as drinking this is a pleasant experience."

"Overall a good session dunkel."
"At the same time, there is not as much going on in this beer in terms of taste as some other Dunkels: cf. Augustiner Dunkles beer, even Hacker Pschorr Dunkles, which has a more refreshing and satisfying flavor. A clear finish, but with not much to make you remember it."

"A beer just a little above average."

"A light rather airy beer, with a short impression."

"Overall: There's a place for everything and this lager is in its place. I was very put off by its harsh roasted malt nose but that's because I'm a hops man. But a good beer is a good beer, and this is a bloody good beer. I'd have it again, no troubles."

"This beer has a mohogany color with a thin white head. Carbonation is tight and small. Smells include earthy hops and caramel malts. the taste is complex with toasted malts, chocolate, almonds, and earthy/medicinal hop bite. mouthfeel is balanced for malts and hops, slightly creamy and silky, and tinfling amd slightly drying. Overall this is a very good dunkle."

"Dr: If the open wasn't so dry, I could down pint after pint, but this beer doesn't go for repeated session style drinking; it's meant to be enjoyed. Give it a go, lads."
"D= As far as I know this was only my third Dunkel beer and I liked it a lot. Very drinkable and pretty refreshing, though I wouldn't want one on a 90 degree day. Would pair exceptionally well with a steak or with smoked meats."
"KLD (Konig Ludwig Dunkel is just too much to type...) is typical of dark wheat beer, but certainly better than most in all respects. It's taste hints of caramel, molasses and honey but neither flavor is overpowering, nor do they detract from KLD's surprisingly easy drinkability. I first tried it in the tourist town of Rudisheim on the Rhine river. I was immediately impressed with the beer's taste - far and away the best dunkelweiss I have ever had - but was later even more impressed at how un-filling and light KLD was for a typically heavy style of beer. I'm sure the calorie count doesn't reflect this, however, even if they do go down like a domestic light."
"an extremely well place leanness to this dunkel which makes it, in this case, susceptible to aging conflicts. this beer was a bit metalic but not overpoweringly so. malt is toasty perfect with a subtle sour apple. a one dimensional toasty. not sweet. and somewhat appetite inducing."
"D-very nice beer. Nice with food. Not outstanding but very good. I would drink this beer again."
"Overall, not the best dunkel I had while touring Germany. It was nice to broaden my experience with the style, but I would be unlikely to purchase this again."
"Have some bread with cheese or sausage with this."
"This will go down in history, not as the best beer I've had, or even the best dunkel, but the beer my friend/customer David brought back for me from Deutschland....after having a stroke!!! Who does that? What, A, man!"
"For a dunkel beer the beer is not that dark,nice to drink."
"Beer is a nice mahogany brown with a good head and light carbonation. The smell is like roasted caramel, sort of sweet. The taste is a bit sweet with a bitterness. It has a balanced flavor with a medium body that is smooth and easy to drink. This is a drinkable brew which seems to go best with food."
"D: Certainly goes down quickly and without any fuss. Not the best Dunkel out there, but this would certainly make a good session beer."
"D- Good Bavarian style dunkel, nice balance, clean, fits nicely with the style, rich and nicely aromatic, but lacks in the full flavor, have had better more complex examples."
"D: Good example of a dunkel, nice enough, but not outstanding."
"Overall - An excellent example of a Dunkel and supremely quaffable... recommended..."
"I find myself liking this more as subsequent sips follow, the light body and slighty sweet nutty character would play really well against a spelt encrusted seared venison loin, with a barley risotto and porcini mushrooms to complement the nutty character of the brew. Well crafted, and I look foward to trying it again."
"Overall, if you are looking for a decent beer, this is a safe tastey dunkel."
"Nice deep brown with a decent off white head that faded quickly with decent lacing. Malty and slightly sweet, nothing in the upfront taste to offend. Mouthfeel was pretty much the same with hints of chocolate, a bit thin. Finish was bitersweet chocolate nothing overpowering, nothing to make it very memorable either. All in all, a decent beer for the type and nothing I would turn down or try again if given the chance."
"A sickly sweetness did arrive in the aftertaste and I also thought it a bit thin/watery. There was some metalic hint towards the end of the drink also, hence the average scores for a beer I had high hopes for."
"Last of the beers I brought back from Germany, this brew poured into a pint glass has a deep brown color, with an odd similarity to a cola. The carbonation stuck to the sides of the glass and there was a thin tan cap with minimal lacing. The smell is doughy and there is a hint of nuts. The taste is extremely thin and carbonated. There is a hint of roasted malt and a slight bitter after taste. I have to say for being the last beer I have from Germany I am a little disappointed."
"This is very light in all of its characteristics, with a light to medium body. It's a decent session beer."
"Solid aroma of cocoa, dough, and raisins. Dense tan head leaves a few strands of lace as it slowly fades. Dark cola colored beer with an amber hue around the edges. Flavors of cocoa and dark roasted malt. Fairly clean mouthfeel with a slight dark malt astringency. A really good dunkel and an all-around solid beer."
"D- a bit of a sub-par/average Dunkel for me, not enough chocolately notes and a bit thin on the ground. Erdinger dunkel beats this easy!"
"A beer that is in between a Munich and a Doppelbock, more towards the latter. Good beer!"
"Good brew. nice for a hot/hummid night. Wish I drank it colder."
"Straightforward beer that I wish had a bit more body, but, that said, what it lacks in depth and robustness it makes up for in drinkability."
"All in all, I like it very much - it's my standard afterwork-beer after all!"
"(EDIT: On a later trip I found this to be much better. Perhaps the tourist trap I bought this one at just had an old keg)"
"lovely malty dark lager from the brewery of the ancient bavarian kings ... classy dark brown colour, the head is not too foamy nor firm, the malty smell is matched by the palate which ends in a dark coffee like aftertaste ... the brew is remarkably dry (for a dark lager) and has a light to medium body, which makes is very accesible"
"Final Thought: This is a solid dunkel with a little more depth than a Warsteiner's versionÂ…"
"The appearance is a dark black just like a coca-cola. The smell is a great dark beer smell but not very noticeable unless you are really searching for it. This beer is a very addictive one you drink it get the bitterness the wetness then it dries out and you just want more and keep drinking it I always have to put just one or two in the fridge at a time or else it all disappears. The only downfall is it is only available in my region ounce a year on tap and is like searching for a needle in the haystack to find it bottled. The mouthfeel is pleasant and smooth with the bitterness leaving you addicted to it. For the german dunkel beers I have found few as strong of flavor as this."
"Taste is all present. Very malty with a roasted caramel aftertaste. Very drinkable with an OK mouthfeel."
"In the end, it is a bit heavy..."

"The waitress brought over the dunkel in a nice Kaltenberg glass. Nice thick head adorned the dark copper liquid. The head slowly drifted away to the sides of the glass. Great malt aroma. The taste was wonderful, matching what I have expected in a well made dunkel. No adverse bitterness and a smooth malt aftertaste that lingered softly on the tongue. The alcohol level was perfect. One of the better dunkels I have experienced on tap."
"Medium dark clear brown color. Foamy cream colored head. Stays around nicely. Mostly carmel smell matched with some hoppy bitterness. Taste is mild, mostly carmel malt. Sourness, very beerlike. After carmel malt taste, super shot of bitterness on the finish. Bitter finish is almost painful. Coffe undertones. Unexepected thin feel for a dark beer. Almost watery. Still very good, sweet start and bitter finish, not bad for the style. Cheers to my friend Heinz from Munich for bringing it all the way across the pond."
