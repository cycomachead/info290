"Very good in a frosted pilsner glass"
"Disappointing flavor. I'm looking for a nice, round feel and rich clean malty flavors and I'm not getting it. The feel isn't too bad, but the flavor is far too bitter and lemony (skunky?). Everything starts out well. There is a brief toffee note up front, but lemony notes take over and really destroy the flavor. Not sure how this beer has such a nice nose, but such a sub-par taste. Perhaps my palate isn't clear or something. I might have to try this one again sometime just to make sure I'm being fair."

"Smooth,  malty goodness that's a great anytime beer."
""
"I'm a big fan. Always up for a good dunkel and this one is pretty tasty"
"I really enjoy this beer, I just wish it was a bit higher %APV. Goes down easy. I could drink about a million of these."
""
""
"Decent, session lager. A bit thin but still enjoyable."
"Warstiner's pilsner has a very similar flavor, but of course lighter and more pilsner-y. I far prefer the dunkel."
""
""
""
"At the Top of my list for Dunkels"
""
"I guess even the Germans can make shitty beer"
""
"Great taste and smooth dark beer!"
""
""
"Underated, good beer.  Not easy to get here."
"Dark, dull color. Vague hints of chocolate here and there. The beer was begging me to eat something with it but I didn't have anything so it took away from my enjoyment of it. Were this paired with bratwurst, a burger, or something similar, I think it would be a 4."

"Overall: I am definitely a convert to the Dunkel.  Warsteiner knows how to make a good, solid brew.  I have a case of this stuff at home, along with the Warsteiner Oktoberfest I just bought.  I am definitely satisfied with this, and will give it a prominent spot in my fridge."

"Overall I thought it was a pretty nice beer and a above average example of the style, it's just a good tasting Dunkel and it's just what I've come to expect from a German Dunkel.  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, just slightly creamy, not too filling and the taste did a nice job of holding my attention, I could drink more than a few of these and it seems like a fitting beer for the fall season.  What I like the most about this beer was how true to style it was, it's got everything that I look for in a good example of the style.  What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, it wasn't bad, but almost every aspect could have been just slightly better.  I would buy this beer again when I'm in the mood for a good Dunkel and I think it's a must try for anyone who likes the style.  All in all I still enjoy this beer and it seemed to be pretty much just how I remember it.  I haven't tried any other beers from this brewery, but I'm on the look out for them since this one made for a good first impression.  I still think that this is my favorite German made Dunkel.  Good job guys this was one nice Dunkel, keep up the solid work."

"Pint on tap at Beer Revolution in Calgary. Brew arrived a flat chestnut brown hue with a light smattering of tan head. Little head retention. Aroma is roasted malts and sweetness in approximately equal measure, milk chocolate, raisins, and weak coffee with a faint whiff of citrus (?). On the palate, fails to overwhelm but does deliver more low key dark malt flavors with well-rounded corners, nothing harsh or pointed. Some brown spice and dry pepper accompany the raisin and dry cacao from the nose. Some diacetyl and perhaps DMS in there to provide a ""light lager"" vibe. Rather thin bodied yet moderately carbonated, retains a smooth drinkability I suppose. This would be a great ""starter"" dark lager for a newbie but most will quickly graduate to more robust flavors."
"Pours clear, dark chocolate coloring.  Smooth, full flavor with a slight maltiness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't know if it was just mine. But it tastes like metal..."
""
""
"Deep brownish color, see through. Aroma is mild with some spicy sweetness. Taste has a bite, but not a bad one. Spice and some malt sweetness comes through. It has a clean finish with just a touch of after bitterness. Overall, this beer seems to be pretty well balanced and good"

"Disappointingly light in flavor. Malt is so faint, it's almost like drinking water."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A decent dunkel.  Very simple and straightforward in terms of going straight from the aroma into the flavor profile.  Nothing amazing or complex here, just straight and simple.  3.5/5"
""
"Good beer dark beer, especially with a salty type of snack."
""
""
""
""
"Taste and mouthfeel save this one, but I prefer their original better.   Decent representation of a Dunkel, but there are better dunkels out there."

"Pours a dark medium brown in color with a thin beige head. A decent amount of sticky lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of some malts with a hint of caramel and raisins. Taste is light bodied with the above flavors coming together which leaves a slightly dry finish. Goes down easy and with perfect carbonation. A really good German brew that is for a cheap price actually. Much better than the regular Warsteiner."
""
""
""
""
""

"Excellent Beer. Generally available at only $24 per case. A heck of a nice deal, versus MANY other beers that cost $32-40 per case. Even better on tap, at a nice German place nearby (newportville inn). Their food is just GREAT. Especially the homemade mustard, turtle soup, and meatballs with spatzle"

"Overall, not great, but a very decent Dunkel."
""

"Overall: pretty good beer. Not a ton to it, but it's a session beer. Need to grab another one to find out if it was light struck, or if I'm losing my mind."
""
""
""
""
"It has a feel like that of a saison and the color of a pale ale. At first, it reminded me of wheat beers and hefeweizen beers. But the slightly astringent and dry aftertaste were similar to the Springstreet Saison from Avondale Brewery. This would be great with a light tasting, baked appetizer."

"Pours a dark brown color with a fair head and bits of lacing. Aroma of malt, some grain, caramel, bit of fruit and hint of chocolate. Taste of malt, some fruit sweetness, with caramel, nutty, and touch of chocolate. Mild bitterness and a clean finish. Moderate body, smooth and nicely balanced. Easy drinker for sure."
""
""

"one thing it is: balanced. not too dark, a pinch of spice, a malty sweet note here and there, and SUPER easy to drink."

"Had this in a bottle poured into a pint glass. The color is reddish/brown. You get a lot of roasted malt in the smell. Also kind of get a caramel smell. The taste follows up with the smell. Lots of roasted malt and caramel. Very smooth and light body. This beer is very easy to drink. Overall not a bad beer. Was looking for maybe a more thicker malt taste. Not bad though."

"Final Thoughts: All around a good performance. I really wish Dunkel beer was more common then it is, but I guess so many people have over roasted the malt on Dunkel beer, that the mundane straw lager holds swap. Thumbs up on this one."
"People on this website seem not to like dark lagers at all, much less this particular brew. I'd heartily disagree. If you want a beer with more complexity than a lager typically offers but don't want to lose the crisp refreshing feel, try this beer. I'm not one for lagers and love the characteristics of a stout. This beer, however, really impressed me. It's like Michael Bay's best movies. His bad stuff is really bad, so when he does succeed, you want to tell everyone ""Hey, he IS talented, just look at this!"""
""
"One of my top 5 commercial favorites! I highly recommend this to you. It's interesting to note, that this beer is actually not sold in Germany. This is an American Dark Lager. Not that it matters to me. I have also had this from the tap at my local bier house, and it tastes just as good there, although not as cold because of their system."
"I don't quite understand the lower scores/reviews for this beer ... too many bitter hop nazis on here ..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well, the aroma was awesome. And that's pretty much all I have to say about that. Quite a let down on the palate, with some strange off-flavors that hindered an already unimpressive flavor profile - minerals, chalk, heavy butter. Without those, this beer would have been okay. As is, it's floating right around ""medicore"". Not so bad I wouldn't drink it again, but I'd definitely never order one again on my own. Unless it was a candle."
""
""
""
"Pours like your typical dunkel, middle brown with a off white head. I think this beer is a little underrated. Lots of people have tried this in the past and simply never go back. This was a staple in my rotation when I first got into beer, and now comin back to it, I must say it holds up better then most. Bold flavors for a dunkel, yet still very easy to drink. You can get this beer everywhere, even most gas stations carry it. Add to that the low price for a 12-pack, I can get it around me for 10 bucks/per 12. Solid."

"Deep reddish-brown color. Almost a deep copper. Nice white head with some lacing on the glass. Sweet bready smell with hints of maple. Sweet caramel malt taste with a hop bitterness in the finish. Light bodied with average carbonation and gentle bitterness. Overall a good dunkel."

""
"Pours a solid dark brown color with a smallish off white head that quickly dissipates to a cap. Smells of caramel and a hint of chocolate against a bready and pilsner malt base. Little to no hop aroma. The flavor is chocolate and caramel malts with a hint of bready pilsner malt. Little to no hop flavor or bitterness. Medium body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a slick smooth mouthfeel. Decent dunkel, easy to drink, but really nothing special."

"Overall – A pretty good brew with some nice fruit and roasted flavors. While tasty it maintains a fairly high level of drinkability. Not too shabby."

"O- not bad, but not something I'll look for again."
""
""
""
"O:  Not a huge fan of this one. Too much burnt presence and really no sweetness that stands out. I had to search too hard for the flavors that are expected. Spices are dull and the mix is just blurred. Maybe better on tap. "

"330 ml bottle into pilsener glass, best before 9/4/2012. Pours crystal clear reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, chocolate, biscuit, nuttiness, toast, toffee, herbal, pepper, and earth. Pretty nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, chocolate, nuttiness, herbal, earth, and light pepper. Lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, toast, nuttiness, and herbal on the finish for a short bit. Fairly dry and a touch thin on the finish. Fair amount of flavor and robustness; no cloying at all after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. No alcohol presence in the taste or finish. Overall this is a very solid dunkel. A touch thin and watery; but has some nice flavors, balance, and is extremely easy to drink. Enjoyable stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mahogany in color with excellent clarity. Poured with a short white foam that reduced to a soapy cap. Dark roasted and earthy, bitter, burnt malt aromas with hints of nuts and an underlying sweetness. On the fuller side of medium bodied with rich but slighty aggressive, fizzy, carbonation. Sweet roasted malt overtop burnt malt flavors from start to finish. Finishes crisp and semi-dry with a charred malt aftertaste."
""
"Smooth, rich body with an above average level of carbonation. Spritzy. Darkened caramel is the predominant flavor. Good light hop in the swallow. Short aftertaste."
""
""
""

"minor trace of head, completely disappears, then leaves a nice colored brown beer. kind of caramel-ly smell, with the basic, commercial brown flavored taste. but it was very welcome and very tasty. miss these german beers; they've always been my favorite. miss Old World too; always has been a kind of second home for me. but the wife and kids were in tow so i couldnt satisfy all my desires. great place to have a beer, great atmosphere. very nice beer, even if it is one of germany's ""commercial"" brews. budweiser vs warsteiner= take the german commercial brew any (and every) day . . . ."

"O: Interesting and satisfying dark beer from Germany with balance of bitterness and fruitiness."
""
""
"Warsteiner Premium dunkel pours a clear brown with amber highlights near the edges. A thin, off-white head caps the brew, and it provides spotty lace. Aromas of burnt grain, nuts and caramel are met with lighter notes of coffee, chocolate, and toffee. Strong roasted malt flavors dominate the pallet, and hints of burnt toast, nuts, and coffee all appear before a dry finish. Sweet at times, this brew is medium in body and moderate in carbonation"
""
"Overall: I liked the appearance but everything dropped from there down to the very disappointing mouthfeel. Not a terrible beer but not something that I would buy again."
""
""
"O: Makes me want to search out a better example of the style, but I would drink it again under the right circumstances. It seems a bit too efficient, as in mass produced. Keep in mind this is a moderately priced beer, especially for an import. it would be a nice choice for a darker beer on a warm day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad, seemed the best choice of the beers available. But nothing outstanding."
""
"Overall - Not a bad beer for being mass produced. Malt complexion is welcomed. Would prefer this beer even more if it has slightly more carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty flavorful beer. It's refreshing and quaffable. I think a little more body and a little carbonation would help this out, but otherwise it's an overall decent beer."

"Presentation: Poured from a 12oz bottle in to a Pilsener glass."

" Notes: went into my favorite bottle shop for Warsteiner Premium Verum (German pilsner), found it, and checked a bottle for a freshness date. Turned out the brew should have been drank by Sept 2011 (apparently nobody drinks the stuff around here). Then I saw another row of the brew right next to the bottle I picked up, and checked the dates; Warsteiner Premium Verum good til August 2012...or so I thought. Got home, poured a bottle into my chalice glass, and was very surprised by the dark color. The moral of the story is: double check labels, and don't ""pull a mom"" (late 90s-early 2000s reference to loving mothers and their attempts to buy regular potato chips and other junk food, but due to the constantly rushed nature of the housewife lifestyle, bring home ""reduced fat"" or ""low sodium"" bastardizations of name brands)."
""
""
""
"Tastes sweet and malty, with a hint of roastiness and an almost burnt finish. I also get a little flash of fruit in the malts. Overall, not bad, but lacking complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not bad, though a bit lighter than I'd hoped."

"O- So, so. it feels like a mass produced dark beer. Like the ""Bud Light of dark beers"""
"Poured a dark brown colour with a good head. Smells of dark fruits, honey, and caramel. Taste is of caramel with a honey finish. The finish is clean and warm with medium carbonation. Okay mouthfeel but is almoat soda like. I will have at least one of these in my fridge for a nice winter night."
""
""
"a schwarzbier through and through. pours a foamy dark brown thin color with a nice white head an inch or two high. smells malty and a bit roasty with some notes of caramel and black licorice, but only gently. mouthfeel is average too, a bit of carbonation and some nice complexity in the finish. i wasnt wowed here. a sessionable darker munchen style brew, malty and boring in many ways. eh"

"overall; not a bad session beer, and tasty enough but don't expect an Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel quality. Appropriately priced for it's quality and good to grab in a pinch when more expensive selections are out of the question."

"Pours a clear brown with a 1 inch puffy tan head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Thin rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, and some metallic and fruity aromas. Taste is of toasted malt, caramel, and some slight nutty flavors. A mild roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a crisp carbonation with a bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that I got in a sampler pack but not something I would seek out on my own."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Sweet and creamy. That's how I'd describe this beer"
""
"This is a relatively bland dark lager, one that could be used as a session beer. While it's not bad, it makes no demands on the palate and does nothing earth shattering. If it's there and it's cheap, go for it, but there's no need to seek this out."
""
""
""
""
"It’s medium bodied with fair carbonation and a slight chalky feel, but fairly refreshing. A solid offering for the style though not my favorite choice in styles."

"Poured from a 330 ml bottle into a pint glass, best by Jan 12. This pours a brown color with a foamy off white head. The smells are mostly of malts, toffee. The feel is medium. The taste is much of the same, higher malt content nice toffee flavor low hops"
"Nice: plenty o' new stuff for me at this Bliss tasting. This one pours a clear cola topped by a finger of dirty light-tan foam. The nose comprises light caramel and very light toasted white bread. That's about it, frankly. The taste brings in more of the same, with equal intensity (or lack thereof, really), with the added benefit of some light hard water. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a pretty standard dark Euro lager (regardless of city of origin/style), nothing offensive, nothing to really smile about. Definition of a slightly positive meh."
"Overall- It is a pretty good beer, I’m not sure I would ever seek it out again, but if sweeter porters or stouts are the drink of choice, you could do worse than this."
"-Overall 3.5: Above average beer. This dunkel is light in alcohol (4.9% ABV) and is also light and dry in taste. Would make a good session beer or an excellent partner to food. There is nothing remarkably good or remarkably bad about this beer and in today's beer world, that's not really a bad thing."
"O: The fact that it reminds me of cereal from my childhood makes it quite enjoyable! This is a tasty beer for any day."
"Overall: one of my favorite dunkels. Robust and very sessionable. Prosit!"
"Russet brown with poor head retention has it looking like cola after mere seconds in the glass. Things improve from there, however, with a firm doughiness with an edge of burnt toast. Some grape skin and hop leaf add depth with some caramel sweetness on the finish. Solid Dunkel, and since it's a $3 special at the pub this month I may have one more."
"Poured an 11.2 oz bottle into a pint glass. Looked like coke, very deep caramel color with a head that didn't stick around long. Smelled a bit metallic for the first half of the glass, but overall I don't think it made a huge impact on the taste of the beer. The taste wasn't all that impressive, wasn't bad though. Aftertaste was a light caramel flavor with a bit of chocolate. The mouth feel and taste were alright to begin with but by the end it was almost like I was drinking malt liquor. Not to say that I would bash malt liquor, I mean I grew up on it in high school, but if I buy a German dunkel and that's what I'm expecting, I don't want to suddenly be drinking Colt .45. Overall I don't have a lot to complain about with this guy, but I might not buy it again."
"RJT"
"Served in a robust glass mug, this beer poured a clear, cola brown with a thin off-white head that receded to almost nothing after a minute or so. Nutty aroma, malty, and not too heavy at that, and an underlying fruitiness. More of the same in the taste, with toasted malts, nuts, a definite note of indistinct fruit in the background, all lightly hopped. A little on the watery side. Medium-bodied and fairly drinkable."
"It's a decent dark lager. Not one of my favourites, but it's never been a favourite style of mine either."
"This is an interesting beer. Deceptively light on first blush, it took me a while to realize this is a dark lager. Very drinkable, but I don't think I could have more than one due to the trademark tangy aftertaste. This beer is a breath of fresh air from the normal hoppy craft brew I'm used to."
"Overall, not bad. Just nothing really to it. Not objectable by any means. Very forgettable beer."
" ~ Not the most drinkable in my opinion. However, it seems to cater to the more advanced beer drinker. Someone looking for a complex German dark lager. Unfortunately those styles seem to be a dying breed in my neck of the woods."
"O - For a cheap beer its pretty good sure there are better Dunkels out there but for the price it can't be beat worth checking out sometime"
"Had on tap at the platt in franlin square at the umternational talkbass annual get together. Showed up in a mug. Nice purple brown with a thin foamy head that was gonelun munutes. Nutty roasted malt. Not the best. A big lagery. Taste follows the nose but more grape. Pretty good a bit thin."
"This is a great session beer. Plenty of flavor and smoothness keep this one a great choice."
"Very thin mouthfeel. Far less than I expected from a ""classic."""
"D - Not bad, just somewhat boring."
"O - Fantastic offering for a Dunkel. I could drink these all day. Sure, it's not the most complex beer, but a nice balance for a session beer."
"Overall - Not a bad beer by any means.. just not very exciting. The flavour is well balanced and it's easy to drink. Not sure I'd seek it out again though."
"Baltic Porter and Hefeweizen have proven old country breweries can pump out unique quality product. Step it up, Dunkel Lager!"
"Overall / Drinkability: Not too shabby - smell on swirling was not good, but overall a pretty drinkable and okay dark German lager. I remember having this many years ago with a meal, and it went well with that, but by itself it's okay as well, but I think it's better with food than by itself as I did tonight."
"This beer pours out as a cola colored liquid with a fizzy tan looking head. The lacing is very minimal. The smell of the beer had some traditional pilsner aromas in it along with a light roasted aroma. The taste of the beer is malty with a dry bitterness to it. The mouthfeel of this one is light bodied and well carbonated. Overall it's a decent dark brew from Germany."
"I'm not a fan of this one, it doesn't really hit the style at all. No rich malt flavors, not really any roasted malt flavors. Just a watered down beer that could be a pale lager with food coloring added."
"O- A little dull for some reason. I feel like saying it's because it's watery but it isn't really. Okay to drink while partying, camping hiking or something but meh..."
"Funny story behind this one, it's actually the very first beer I ever tasted. When I was 9 or 10, my family and I were out at a restaurant and I mistook my mom's Warsteiner for my Coca-Cola. I immediately spit it back into the glass, ruining her beer. It became a joke with us for years, and I will always remember that."
"Overall, a very solid brew and what you expect from a large brewer for a dunkel, flavors are clean and presentation and mouthfeel are great."
"(11.2oz bottle from AJ's Arcadia). Pours clear dark brown with red hue and tan head. Average carbonation. Aroma has lots of sweet caramel malts, biscuit and bubblegum. Taste follows suit with sweet caramel and biscuity notes. Very crisp beer. Light bodied with a slick texture. Smooth finish. Easy to drink."
"Not a fan, wouldn't recommend."
"Overall: Very average beer overall. Easy to drink, and for what flavor is there, it's tasty, but it's just weak in all departments; and for that, I say ""nay""; I wouldn't go after this again."
"This is a weak beer. Lacks alot of elements that makes this style one of my favorites, or it lacks the depth and strength of flavor you want, expect, and deserve. Don't try this as your introduction to the style. An ok brew, but if I'm in the mood for a true Munich Dunkel Lager, look elsewhere."
"O: Wasn't a fan of this one. Too much emphasis on the roast and it was a bit too much for such a light beer."
"Overall, a decent seasonal beer. Not the most flavorful beer, but inoffensive and smooth. Good to crack a few of these on a hot day. I recommend a try."
"This was a pretty solid beer with a nice head. The beer poured completely opaque with little to no transparency. The smell was that of caramel and spices. The flavor was a bit sweeter than expected and the feel was a bit too heavy for the taste. I would recommend drinking this one slowly and after meals."
"This beer pours with a decent amount of head that gives off a strong aroma of hops and light fruit. This is a very dark looking beer with little to no transparency. This is definitely a full bodied beer packed with flavor. It has flavors of caramel, hops, nuts, and spice. This beer best reminds me of Guinness, but lacking such and intense flavor of coffee. It is a great dessert beer. Cheers."
"O: I am clueless as to why this beer only gets a B- overall, as of Apr 2011. This is a good, solid dark German beer."
"Overall: This beer is OK for thirst quenching."
"D - A very smooth drinking beer. It has good flavor but it's not astounding. I wouldn't pass it up but I also wouldn't seek it out. On the good side of average."
"Overall this reminds me a lot of a lighter, less aggressive Spaten Optimator. It appears to be just about the only dunkel available in Memphis but it's a pretty good one. Compared to other beers available in supermarkets and convenience stores for the $1.50/bottle mark it's difficult to beat. It's unassuming to a fault--it tastes good but seems too restrained. Still, this is recommended, especially if you're on a budget and don't want to spend too much money. You'd be hard pressed to find anything as good at this price point."
"Creamy mouthfeel and medium bodied. Really refreshing."
"You could drink these until you die because the flavor won't slow you down. It is a weak beer and maybe something to give to beginners to cut their palates on"
"This beer pours a deep brown color with shades of vermilion when light is passed through. There is no head to the beer, I tried to agitate some up...El Zilcho. The aromatics are solid nothing special, but there is a nice malty aroma, with a hint of corn sugar in the back. The taste was hard to peg. It's got the body of a heavy AAL with some flavorings of a handful of dark roast specialty malts. It's a juxtaposition of flavors in my opinion. One helps and one hurts. So where is the flavor left, somewhere in the not that great realm. The mouthfeel is oddly sticky and cloying but with the body is light on the palate. I'm not really a fan of how dry this beer finishes as well. The drinkability is decent. I thought it was a decent beer overall to enjoy. There was absolutely nothing special or offputting about this beer, it was just beer. It's hard to describe, much else on this beer."
"Pours a dark chestnut brown with a thin, creamy off-white head. The aroma is pleasant but understated with a faint grainy sweetness. The taste is much more pronounced, with a dominant malt base that features flavors of cereal grains, cherry sweetness, and maybe even a bit of weak coffee and raisins. Although certainly crisp and clean, the prickly, fine carbonation is almost distracting. Overall, this is a solid, crisp, drinkable beer. It isn't remarkable in any sense, but it is very nice."
"D- I don't think I'd be able to have bottle upon bottle of this beer but could really enjoy 2 or 3 in a sitting. It iis flavorful, and the alcohol is well hidden. A nice example of a dark lager!"
"From notes: This is a very tasty dunkel. Aroma of roasted malt and hint of bitter coffee. Pour was beautiful. Deep dark brown with a puffy 1 finger off white/tan head. Taste was nice and light but with a strong roasted malt flavor. A hint of toffee in the aftertaste that leaves a bitterness after the swallow. Easy to drink which is what a German beer should be all about."
"Overall - Putting this beer on my ""return to"" list. Bought only a single sampler, but will probably buy several the next time I'm in the mood for a German style Dunkel."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and its low alcohol content makes it quite sessionable."
"The mouthfeel is vey solid with it's firm crackle of carbonation and light body. This is a simple beer and executed very well. The low ABV makes it extreamly drinkable and the flavor will keep me coming back to it. Very satisfying, put this on your list to try."
"Good beer to drink and relax with. A fairly easy going dunkel that most anyone can enjoy. Would work well anytime between fall and spring."
"D--Highly drinkable. Plenty of flavor with a little bit of complexity. nice low ABV. Would make a great sessin beer."
"nothing great but nothing offensive, much better then our big name brews on this side of the Atlantic"
"Notes: Not a bad beer, but nothing special. I would try this again if I saw it on draft."
"D - Simple and a bit one dimensional but it is easy to drink and enjoy."
"I love dark beers, especially dark German beers and one dark Dutch beer. Some of my other favorites are Beck's dark, St. Pauli Girl dark and Heineken dark. However, having discovered the Premium Dunkel, Warsteiner's dark, I've been in heaven. It has that slightly bitter after taste like Guiness, but not as strong or as overpowering, yet still yielding that deep and rich flavor that only a dark beer can offer. So, unlike Guiness, one can put away several of these whereas one can only consume a couple of Guiness stouts. If you haven't tried it, I highly recommend it."
"Warsteiner Premium Dunkel has dark brown colour and a good 1 cm head when poured. It maintains good lacing. The smell is malty with a hint of sweet chocolate. The taste is grainy with a hint of sourness to begin with but gets more interesting and the end with roastiness and a hint of chocolate. This beer is quite foamy and thick in the mouth. Overall, a very nice brew."
"Overall, it's light, bland, and pretty boring. Plain dark beers are always disappointing, I think. I didn't even want to finish it."
"More depth of flavor than the regular Warsteiner, but nothing outstanding. Good session beer, especially with some sauerkraut and knockwurst."
"Had this on tap at Smokeless Joe's in Toronto. Pours a ruby-brown colour with thin off-white head. Not too much lacing on the glass. Smells of molasses, but other than that pretty much just grainy. Flavour has no bitterness that I can detect, just some mild sweetness. Smooth carbonation level. Just an ok beer, I wouldn't pass on this if offered, but I will not seek out again."
"330 ml bottle. Pours brown with an average off-white head. Aroma of grassy, piney hops and some toasted malt. Medium, crisp body. Taste is light, grassy hops, buckwheat, hints of honey, toasted malt and alcohol. Medium, slightly hoppy finish. I'm not impressed by this brew."
"great taste."
"Drinkabilitly - This brew is not bad. I didn't find anything real complicated about it. Nice session brew. Would pair well with a cool evening. If this beer were available at a social event, I would drink it without fuss."
"Not a bad Dunkel Lager, but I had better German Dunkels when I was over there."
"Overall a good brew, but would be better if the flavours were heightened. Wouldn't go out of my way for one, but wouldn't turn one down either."
"I had a bottle of this as part of the Las Vegas Hilton's Octoberfest special. Not as unimpressed as i was in Germany but perhaps that's because I was surrounded by German beers there. Typical of a dunkel in color and carbonation (dark caramel with a good lighter head). Good aroma, with a bready smell. Overall, not bad but I was sticking with the draft Pilsner instead."
"This was not what I expected! It was much lighter in color and not nearly as deep as I had hoped. The overall quality was good, but I thought it would have been much deeper and more robust. I am still on my quest to find the best German beers and this was average, but not as flavorful and unique as I thought it should have been."
"Good looking very dark beer which gave me a one finger head that didn't last more than 20 seconds. Lice is sort of broke-up, but has a good cling. The color of the beer rates a 30 on the SRM chart. Smells like honey and licorice. Tastes that I recognize in this brew are licorice, malt and hops. Mouthfeel as milk, a little coated, easy on the palate. Not a great dark lager, lacks any great taste, but overall it is a flavor that sort of grows on me. Better as it warms. I would like to try this again."
"D - A nice flavorful Lager that's not too expensive. I thought it was a step above an average Dunkel Lager but I'm not too crazy about it. Very balanced, I think I would have like a bit more body to it but that's just me. Definitely worth a try, I'd drink it again for sure but I don't know if I'd buy again."
"d: Refreshing and drinkable. With so many Dunkels being so similar, it's hard to prefer one over the other. This one stands out to me, but not in a positive way. Good beer but there are several better choices."
"Not my favourite but definitely drinkable, I would definitely have in favour of a lot of other beers "
"D - not my favorite, but adequate if presented with the choice between it and some lesser beers."
"Drinkability is average."
"D-Pretty easy drinking but a little bland for my tastes and unremarkable."
"Overall I like this beer. But then again.... there are not alot of German import beers I didnt like. As stated above if your outside grillin' or eatting seafood pair w./ this beer for a tasty time. Drink straight from bottle & enjoy!"
"Conclusion, not worth its premium import price at the grocery store. The flavors tasted fake and too manufactured. Skip it."
"Drinkability: A nice session lager, but I wanted more flavor."
"Excellent beer. Has everything a great beer should. Was a perfect match for bratwurst, sauerkraut, & potatoes for dinner. Highly recommended!!"
"D - fairly easy to drink, somewhat basic in the flavour department, a decent enough brew but nothing about it really stands out"
"Poured a dark clear mahogany with red hints. One fingered light tan head with little to no lacing. Light sweet carmel malt aromas, reminded me of cotton candy. On the pallette I found it to have a sweet metallic bite almost like the labeling had managed to get into the bottle with an expresso coffee under tones. Medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. Wasn't overly empressed or dissapointed. Might have to try on tap."
"I felt it was overly sweet. Not really impressed at all."
"M/D: Somewhat thin body for the style; carbonation is medium. The cardboard-box-straight-from-the-attic quality of the aftertaste really convinces me that I shouldn't have another."
"500ml can from the LCBO. Chestnut brown in colour with copper hues and a thin, off-white cap that eventually dissipates to nothing. Smell and taste are light metallic grassiness, grainy malts, very hollow and tinny (adjuncts maybe?), small trace of walnut, and a mildly sour, malted finish. Inoffensive, but painfully generic. Mouthfeel is the saving grace of this beer: medium, crisp, a little creamy, moderate carbonation, some spice on the palate, lasting dryness. Aftertaste borders on citric, which is weird for the style. I can't say I'm impressed. In fact, this is just as bad as Rickard's Dark. Forgettable."
"Not impressed."
"D: This beer is crisp and light, but not terribly exciting. The low ABV makes for easy sessions."
"D: A nice refreshing brew."
"Drinkability - I'm not buying this again."
"Beer looked dark brown, with a head that I'd say fell out of ""ring"" status very quickly. Nothing too enticing on the aroma front either. Mineral and metallic scents outweighed the malt. Taste was mostly earthy and coffee-like, with a tinge of sweetness. Mouthfeel was dry and a bit thin. Overall, this beer reminded me of a weak cup of coffee."
"D. Not a bad beer but definitely not a great beer. I remember enjoying some warsteiner on tap a few years ago but it must not have been the dunkel."
"D - the settling of the flavor/mouthfeel after the carbonation dissipates is cumbersome but the finish is great"
"D-some decent flavors but a few things that take away from what could be a very good beer. It isn't bad and can be enjoyed."
"D- very drinkable, not heavy or foamy. Brewed w hop extract instead of the green stuff but in this case it seems ok."
"D: Really a nice, uncomplicated beer that is highly drinkable. A solid example of the style, but the weak mouthfeel holds it back. This used to be my favorite beer, but I'm afraid that I've moved beyond it."
"Not bad; at less than 2 bucks a pop it's certainly a good choice for a session. Not my favorite dunkel lager, but something to keep on hand."
"I have to say that after reading numerous books on beer styles and hearing about the history of this brewery, I was letdown by my own anticipation."
"D: Goes down alright, but not as well as the real thing. Not bad for a bottled Dunkel though."
"Quite an enjoyable lager, I could drink this almost anytime."
"D: This is a real easy drinking pint, its not as complex as I'd like it to be; rather one-dimensional. I do enjoy it though, and I would probably order another!"
"Medium mouthfeel and overall drinkable, this is one that is pretty good for the style."
"D= obviously drinkable but I'd prefer to look elsewhere for my standard-stock modest-priced dark beer to have on hand."
"It's got a smooth, medium body with long finish."
"Enjoyability Score: Indifferent."
"D: I could see me drinking this more often. Will buy another case when it comes to the right time of year."
"This really isn't all that bad a beer, and I could see myself being able to session it. There's nothing really wrong with it other than the fact that its remarkably simple. That fact means I probably won't return to it ever again (especially when we do simple so well in Ontario), but I did enjoy this pint."
"Enjoy with all your favorite German foods."
"Quick head. Dark and translucent in the cup, with deep amber and garnet. Light but penetrating aroma. Crisp and slightly acid mouth feel, tingly on the tongue with carbonation. Light bodied. Smooth mild flavour, well balanced, with a long finish. A nice basic beer. Tastes like beer, smells like beer."
"D: Enjoyed this beer and easily see me bringing it to future beer get togethers."
"Taste is light, roasty, with some dry toast, light prune, hint of wine, hint of wet soil. It's light and a bit thin and simple but good. It is mostly dryish but with slight leaning to the sweet side."
"Overall, not too bad. It is very easy to drink and has a decent flavor. Nothing that blew me away but I could drink it again."
"An interesting summer/winter beer. Has a nice flavor that works well for a cold night."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1 inch head. Smell is very mild, some malts. Taste is also mild, some notes of chocolate and malts, not very flavorfull. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this makes for a mediocre brew."
"Drinkability: I’ve always enjoyed this beer and keep coming back for more. It is consistent in that you always get the exact same taste, carbonation, head, retention, etc."
"Drinkability: It's not bad, but it's not great either. It's something I could get again if the right mood struck me."
"Conclusion: Drinkable Munich Dunkel Lager, but nothing special and for like $7.99 there's definitely beers (both German and American) that I'd rather have."
"Medium-bodied, and still nice and crisp in the mouth. Moderately sessionable due to its filling-ness and sweetness. An enjoyable brew!"
"I'd buy it again but if it was gone I could careless."
"Serving type: can"
"Drinkability: It's drinkable. There are better Dunkel's out there but this is still good"
"Beer is smooth, no clear flavor to me though. Its bland and goes down quick. Finishes cleanly. Some finer lagers this is the goals so I guess its OK, I just want to know that I'm drinking something. Beer is thin which is fine, drinkability is high, its like water. Its OK."
"D - High. Dunkel lagers usually equal drinkability. This is a pretty solid performer in its style, yet it is not among the best."
"If one is looking for a session beer that can easily be forgotten, well this is it."
"Nice and easy drinking. I like it."
"Notes: The standard dark german import taste, nothing spectacular, and nothing compared to what is available domestically in Germany for this style, just an average import beer."
"Pours a deep brown color with shades of red when held up to the light. Nice prolific white head. Not much going on with the nose...malt was about all I caught. Taste was similar - malty, with hints of some other stuff going on. Very little carbonation. Early on, the mouthfeel seemed almost creamy to me, but towards the end it felt very watery. All in all a very unremarkable taste with an average mouthfeel. There's nothing complicated going on here, so while that makes it very drinkable, it also makes it a bit boring."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability: Decent but nothing special. Could use more body or more ""something"" to counter the average malt profile."
"Epic dunkel fail."
"Taste is smooth and crisp with a dry toasty and grassy bitterness in the finish. Malts are not as sweet as the nose indicates, but a few roasty chocolate notes linger on into the taste. This is not the boldest dunkel out there, but it is well crafted and super easy to drink. I am a fan of dunkels, but after having a couple other Warsteiner beers, I was surprised how much I enjoyed this one."
"A more or less balanced, tasty dark German lager, the roasted character making up for the lack of overt hop bitterness. Simple, and drinkable with the more robust sorts of charred or baked comestibles, it would seem."
"D: Very drinkable. Could be a good session beer."
"Execution doesn't live up to the presentation. Not a very distinct example of the style and there are many other German brewers doing it better."
"The lack of flavor would make me not to drink this beer again."
"D-Low abv...nice overall character...not watery in the least....I see this as an excellent session beer. Good stuff.."
"Light to medium body, high drinkability, ideal for a warm day. A sessionable dark lager for sure."
"Dark copper with a crater marked light tan head that fades fairly quicky and leaves very little lace behind on the glass. The nose is pretty weak for the style, toasted grain and the slightest suggestion of toffee. The taste is better than the smell but still seems really light and dry for the style, but not unpleasant. The body is also on the lighter side. Drinkability is good but the flavors are more dortmunder than dunkel IMO."
"Pours a dark brown color with a slightly off white brownish color head. There is a little lacing left after the head and drink are drained. The smell is of malt and a slight floral. The taste is rather weak, the is a little malt and a little sweetness with a little harsh bite. The mouthfeel is okay there is a little harsh tone with a moderate amount of carbonation. Overall it is drinkable but it isn't as good as other dunkels. The hofbrauhaus dunkel is a better choice."
"Medium to mild carbonation. I was hoping for a better drink."
"D: Overall a tasty brew that's pretty light in body but is predominantly on the sweet side and a bit filling. I could enjoy a few of these but probably could not stomach much more than that. Not a bad beer for it's relatively broad distribution as I seem to see Warsteiner beers fairly often nowadays."
"pretty good, dunno if i want to buy another"
"Overall a surprisingly good selection from Warsteiner. I had a burger with this one at a restaraunt, good deep red color, not too harsh of a taste but it did have a heavy caramel taste with it. Overall a good beer still very happy with this line of beers."
"With all the tall cans of pale lager in the BC liqour stores it is nice to see a dunkel available in cans. This is a pretty nice take on the style with a full mouthfeel making this an enjoyable drink. The beer is roasty and kinda sweet with caramel overtones but does not have the thinness that plagues some takes on the style. Decent enough and food friendly including BBQ make this a summer evening addition to the beer quiver."
"Deep red color, almost would look like a cola if it wasn't for the foam. Surprisingly, there's very little roasted characteristics, but instead it's very heavy on the caramel. The hops balance the flavor, leaving a very mild bitterness that stays on the tongue well after the beer is swallowed."
"D= While the flavor of this beer was not anything to get excited about, it was easy to drink and could easily be sessioned."
"Drinkability: While not a great beer this is a pleasant enough one and I could easily have another. While not challenging in any way this beer goes down easily. The last half of the beer also went quite well with the Bratwurst sandwich and German Potato Salad that I had for lunch."
"I wouldn't be sad if told I could never have this again. Its looks and mouthfeel are better than average, but those alone do not make a good beer."
"The bottles are only 11.2 oz and the alcohol is only 4.8%...and it's smooth like a porter...I could drink a lot of these and enjoy every one."
"The taste is very sweet, adjunct type of sweetner, maybe some cooked veggies added along the way with a slightly roasted malt flavor, maybe some caramel in there too. This is a light bodied beer, not much taste or aftertaste either. There is a slightly off sourishness to the beer that doesn't add to the enjoyment of it. This beer is not all that interesting and I'm going to reach for something better starting now."
"D- Could be high due to how light it is but the after taste kills it."
"Warsteiner Dunkel really fights to be an average beer. It makes it by a nose. At the end of the day, it needs a good bit of work to be a good beer. The nose is weak and it lacks flavor. Given those two faults, it's very lucky to be an average beer. Not something I'd seek out by any means."
"Update: when I let it sit for a few minutes and warm, more of the malt flavor came in and the raisin / citrus flavor was a little more balanced with it."
"Pours a clear dark brown with thick head and good lacing down glass. The smell was a little weird, some hops and a slight skunky smell. Roasted malt flavor with a flowery hop flavor in the finish and again a little bit skunky in flavor. very smooth mouthfeel with less than normal carbonation. There was a somewhat metallic taste to this. It reminded of the other warsteiner beers in flavor with the added goodness of roasted malts."
"well, a pretty balanced example of this style. usually dark lagers can be devoid of flavor. not so here. enough flavor to satisfy, not heavy enough to prevent you from having another."
"D: Pretty drinkable, would drink again, I think I will buy better beer though. Kind of a let down for my first German beer."
"Pours a very dark red-brown colored body, somewhat transparent looking, with a big frothy off-white head. Has a funky spicy aroma, maltiness, dark fruit. Dark fruity musty taste, maybe like over-ripe bananas. Grapey. Malty. Fizzy. Good."
"Wish the ABV was higher..,but with that 4.9 this light tasty dunkel could be a session beer."
"I find this beer to be much smoother than Warsteiner Premium Verum, the lighter colored version. Presentation is nice, a firm froth about half an inch on top after it is poured. Smell is of ripe hopes, and the aroma stays with the taste. Aftertaste is a mild bitter hopsy kind of taste. Very good all around."
"D: Very easy to drink. This is my father's brand, and I can see why he enjoys it."
"D 3.5, the smell of ths one is the standout for sure, it's my most preferred Warsteiner so far, not bad at all, just not top pn my list. Worth a try for sure."
"This is a very drinkable beer that goes down silky. It does, however, have a bit of an average taste, nothing stands out too much. Still, I'll have another."
"D- An alright brew that just lacks that special quality."
"Pours a beautiful ruby-brown with an off-white head. The nose is expectantly malty. Head dissipates and leaves little lace. Taste is of malt, pear, and what I interpreted as a bit of a vanilla aftertaste. This is a very drinkable and beer, but nothing special."
"Overall not that wonderful and therefore not especially drinkable. Wont go searching for this one."
"This beer is probably agreeable to some, but that group certainly wouldn't include those who have tried a real Munich Dunkel. Even for something aimed at swill lager drinkers it surprises me that a nation so rich in brewing tradition, one of the few places on Earth with a long-standing and still prominent beer culture, and a people (rightfully) proud of their national drink could release something this low in quality."
"Drinkability - The first two went down pretty easy...only 22 to go. No prob."
"i find myself wanting to pick this up quite often."
"Notes: A decent brew with a very easy to drink feel. If you want a low ABV with a good quality taste then here it is."
"Nice atmosphere. A pretty simple, but solid, flavor, and hearty feel make for very nice drinkability. Good quaff."
"This is very drinkable given the overall flavors and mouthfeel."
"Overall- A good, yet light flavored, session beer. Decent, worth a try."
"I could drink this again with a good German bratwurst and sauerkraut. I look forward to trying others from this brewery."
"Pretty good, but not overly impressive. I'd like to try it on tap to see if it's any better."
"D- A good, simple beer. Doesn't knock your socks off, but is a refreshing choice."
"On draft at the Waldhaus Pub at the Banff Springs Hotel, served in a logoed flute glass with coaster. Poured reddish-brown color with a thin beige head. Good foam retention, irregular sticky lace. The aroma is light malt, nutty. Malty flavor, with toasted nuttiness. It is medium to light bodied, with a clean, crisp finish. Easy drinking, flavorful, a great sessional. Not overly heavy or complex, nor is it meant to be."
"Nice ruby glint in direct light, thin head with decent retention. Otherwise typical dark brown body with some visible carbonation streams. Distinct aroma of roasted barley, probably it's most redeeming quality. Dull papery malt flavor, like many other euro lagers, but with some mild hop presence. Not especially roasty in the taste, dry and quick in the finish. Fairly light and dry feel, yet still substantial enough to sip instead of chug. Decent enough to have a couple, but doesn't really hold interest very long."
"D: Very drinkable and light per style but overall the malt complexity and flavor makes this beer stand out."
"Drinkability: Worth a try. Not the best, but good for a couple beers."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Nothing special and definately not something I could drink more than one of."
"Pours a clear dark mahogany with a small head that lingers as a cap for a while and leaves no lacing. The aroma is nice with tons of roasted malts and a bit of smoke on top of a light breadiness. The taste is not quite as full as the aroma with a sweet maltiness that flows into a grainy aftertaste with no hops to be found. The smokiness is not as prominent as the aroma either. The mouthfeel is thin with decent carbonation. This is a decent session lager though with very little complexity. Basic but drinkable."
"A light brown head about 1/2 in thick. The color is a dark brown with tints of red. The is an initial moderate sweetness with coffee, malt and a hint of molasses and earth. The finish is some what long with coffee and molasses and a hint of earth. There is however a slight hint of citrus on the end which makes it a little bit astringent. It is good beer overall and easy to drink. The body of the beer seems to be light and moderate. The texture is syrupy carbonation."
"Mouthfeel is light to moderately light. Moderately high carbonation; very slight carbonic acid zing. Nothing special here. Is rather drinkeable, but not especially so"
"Out of a bottle this beer produced a fizzy head of tan foam atop a cola-brown liquid. Looked like root-beer! The heads was short lived and the lacing. The aroma was lightly malty, slightly toasted and grainy with a hint of sourness. The flavors were started on a sweet malty note but then was punctuated by the sour lemony-hops character and some bitterness. Hints of metal that linger on the finish. The mouthfeel was frothy and watery. Well known for the style but not worth the hype."
"Notes: Really glad that I had this from a bottle at the German Christmas Festival. It would be better to have it from a glass, however, to fully appreciate it."
"It has a dark body with not much for head and thin lace. The lace it does have is pretty tight. The body is brown amber. It has a roasted malt aroma but is not very strong. The taste is grainy and roasty but there is not much else to it. This is not a bad beer by any means it is just basic. It does not have a hearty body that one might think."
"I would give this a try if you can find it and it has a good price as i found it for $6.65 a sixer."
"Although the ABV means that this could be sessionable, the simple, sweet flavor precludes that. Overall, not a bad beer, just not one that I'll ever seek out again."
"A very enjoyable beer if not the most complex. Still I really enjoy the clean and crisp feel of a lager while still having more depth and flavor than a typical light lager."
"Overall, not a good beer. It was weak in aroma and taste and just didn't do anything more than a BMC in my opinion. Avoid."
"My first crack at a new style and I must say, it's pretty good. Pours a beautiful deep red color with some nice malty aroma and taste. Goes down easy and smooth, with supreme drinkability. Seems like the Euro version of a brown ale to me, but I liked this beer.. would try again."
"Pours a cola brown with amber highlights and little head and bubbling. The aroma has nutty, light toasted malts, faint stuffy hops and some very well masked herbal notes. Start to finish is clean tasted malts. Hintsof light powdered cocoa and toffee nuts.The palate linger just enough powder andtoast to make a great dunkel lagr. This beer has lots of flavor and an awesome sessionability."
"O- Pretty solid. The fairly low abv and smoothness of the beer present it as a reasonable beer to have a few of. Overall a decent, but perhaps not outstanding dunkel."
"The body is light to moderate. Would have liked more depth overall but is a light ABV beer. Overall, would have like more Munich malt in my Munich lager. Some off aged notes but not over the top."
"I'm not a huge fan of Dunkles, so I tried to rate this one for what it is and its not bad. Definitely not my first choice but it still had all the flavor and the drinlablility."
"drinkability is moderate to high. Easy to drink, but nothing special which doesn't really entice me to consume it."
"Pours a dark amber with a small,thin,bubbly head that has no hang time to speak of,nor does it produce any decent lace to appreciate. The nose is pretty weak and disappointing with some caramely notes and brown sugar. As far as flavor goes I can enjoy this under malted Dunkel,because I wasn't expecting a whole lot more than what it can provide. Lightly toasted malt and some subtle caramel sweetness is a bit lackluster,the tail is a bit hollow as well with some hop bitterness and slightly skunked aftertaste. The mouthfeel is thin,one notch above water at best. This beer is very drinkable and thats where it's going to get its highest mark. An average Dunkel Lager at best."
"Drinkability: Never immensely flavorful or exciting, but it is quite drinkable, I'll give it that much."
"D - A credible drinker. May not wow you, but again, does the job."
"D- Really easy to drink."
"The lighting at the time made it difficult to judge the exact color, but it looked cola brown with some amber weaved in. Spongy white head on top with decent retention. Aroma is astrigent with some toasted grain, not a lot intersting here. The taste was dissapointing at first, it was astringent/husky upfront, but much of that faded away. As that clears, it sweetenes to raisins/grapes with bits of dark bread. Hints of wood throughout the beer. Feels chewy and medium in body. Not bad."
"Tastes great, light and complex and perfectly balanced. Starts with sweet, bready grain, runs quickly into a spicy and bitter noble hop, and then ends with a wonderful melange of the two."
"Poured to a good off white head that didnt last long. Minimal lacing. Dark brown in color. Smelled of malt, caramel, and a slightly sweet smell. Tasted of smoke, malt, yeast, slightly sweet, and a little hoppy. Had a good flavor overall. Felt good in the mouth, carbonation I thought was about right. I would like to try this as a session beer. Wasnt to heavy, just all and all a good tasting beer. Was another one of those 11.2 oz."
"This pours a rich, dark reddish brown with a fine beige head. Aroma is malty and just slightly sweet with a touch of cloves and smoke. Flavor is smooth, mainly malty, with a smoky undertone and hints of spice. Texture is smooth and pleasant, and it goes down very nicely."
"D: Well this actually was a good experiment. It aged nicely and was very tasty after almost two years! Some bourbon notes were somewhat suprising."
"Fairly deep brown in color-small and tight head. Mellow aroma-somewhat chestnut like and a mild sulfur smell. Decent flavor. Nutty and somewhat malty. Very slight hop bite to it. Smooth and easy going down. Lacks the softness of a dunkel that I have had in other examples. Overall a pleasant experience. Good beer all around. Much preferable to a Beck's or Pauli Girl dark for sure."
"Poured a thick tannish head. Chestnut brown in color, with red highlights. Nose is clean, lightly roasted malt with not a bit of hop in sight. Tastes sweet with substantial body for a German lager. Nicely roasted dark malt with just a smattering of hops makes this finish clean. Very wheaty in the taste and aftertatse. It's a fresh, well-made slightly above average German lager."
"A refreshing and crisp dunkel, more about textures than flavour, yet still enjoyable."
"D-A very drinkable beer if you're not looking to be wowed. Quite frankly I was a little disappointed and can't foresee buying again."
"Not bad at all..."
"The color when poured was a medium dark brown with tan foam that disapated after a short while. The smell of roasted malts and hop's filled the nose with a hint of caramel. The taste had a bitter/sour flavor to the hops that was very evident. Not on of the better Dunkels, but a thirst quincher on a hot day!"
"Drinkability- For being as dark as this beer is it is not at all heavy or commanding. A nice combination of flavors and weight. Nothing stands out in the way of flavors but all those combine to a nice beer. Something that you could have all year round and be satisfied. I haven't had many other examples of Munich Dunkel but this beer was very satisfying and I would definately have it again, hopefully nest time on tap."
"D : Great example of a Munich Dunkel. Easy to drink and tastes really good."
"D - Not a bad session brew if one was in the mood for these flavors without all the heaviness. A relatively tasty beer overall, but lacking severely in complexity."
"The taste just doesn't cut it. Moderate bitterness, but without the coffee or other flavors of a stout, and without the smoothness and sweet maltiness you expect in a dunkel. It's just an unsatisfying, watery dark beer."
"Bottle: Poured a deep clear brown color dunkel with a medium foamy head with average retention and no lacing. Aroma of light sweet caramel malt is pretty neutral. Taste is very bland with light caramel malt with not much character. Very bland and boring version of the style and not something I am about to buy again anytime soon."
"D: Although relatively cheap compared to most dunkels, its hard for me to think of drinking more than a few of these in succession. A nice beer to start a session with."
"M/D: The beer was creamy and very drinkable. It may have been slightly over carbonated but not so much that it was a determent to the beer. The beer also had an aftertaste to it but I can't put my finger on what it was. Overall, I was very surprised by this beer and enjoyed it much more than I thought that I would. I would definitely drink this beer again."
"D - Excellent session beer that can be enjoyed any time of the year"
"Tastes of fruits, sweet malts and a mild hop presence. This is a good drinkable dark lager and it comes in cans."
"D = Decent drinkability, fresh and clean with good balance, the metallic taste was the major thing keeping this from being higher."
"Poured a solid dark chocolately color with little head. Smelled rich of malt, maybe a little hops, but nothing entirely destict. It tasted pretty good, but again, nothing too distict in the flavor. It felt medium to almost thin my my mouth but was a pretty drinkable beer to go with the tacos I was having for dinner."
"I tried this beer on March 12, 2008 after purchasing from my local LCBO outlet. The beer poured a dark translucent reddish-brown with a 1"" head which disappeared quickly. The first aromatic flavour that hit me was molasses. There was also some sweet malt and cherry hints. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with ample carbonation. The flavour was malty/grainy with some unplaceable sourness. An alright beer."
"Overall I was very surprised by this beer. I liked it a lot. More than most reviewers I guess...Very tasty and easy going. A little lighter version of the Dunkel style."
"Overall a fine addition to my beer repertoire. If this is only an average dunkel according to your reviews, I'll gladly seek out a ""good"" one"
"Far superior on tap!"
"one of my fav. dunkels ; pours a clear, deep copper-brown w/ a thin light tan head which dissipates quickly leaving a moderate lacing in my pils glass ; a subtle smell, cereal grain, toasted nuts, and hints of dark fruits and noble hops ; a crisp, malty flavor, nutty w/ a caramel-like undertone, faint fig/date-like notes as well, an excellent finish ; very dry and light bodied with plenty of co2, this beer feels like it evaporates off your tongue ; a very drinkable beer, i'm def. gonna stock this up for summer..."
"A mediocre dunkel."
"Not a huge Warsteiner fan, but saw this on tap and decided to give it a go. Poured a dark brown color with a small head that died quickly. A light, malty smell that is somewhat earthy and hopdriven. A good malt taste (cocoa?), but mostly hop driven with a touch of caramel to give the light-to-medium body smoothness and also hints of citric fruit. Not my first choice for a dunkel, but this wasn't too bad. Liked it more than regular Warsteiner."
"Not terrible but I'll look for another before trying this guy again."
"I always like the dunkel variety of beers and I have been going on a tasting spree with German darks. Had this cold in a pub glass. Poured a clear Coke color with a decent head. Smelled mineral like with a little grassy note and some faint chocolate malt. Taste was sweet and slightly metallic but smooth and drinkable with some upfront chocolate malt and hops in the background."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with a mild carbonation. Clean finish. Not too shabby."
"Draught @ Fox & Hound: This one pours with a decent sized white head on it. It doesn't linger long. There was no real lacing to it. The color is a ruby-tinged brown. The aroma was OK, although not too strong. notes of molasses, caramel, maybe a hint of roastiness. Slightly less than a medium body. The taste was slightly sweet with notes of the caramel and molasses. A hint of hops for balance. Not very exciting, but very drinkable."
"D-A very easy beer to drink as its very crisp and refreshing, even for a darker beer."
"Drinkablity: Decent and drinkable brew."
"D - Easy to drink but pretty weak for the style. Some decent brown malt flavors, but kind of bland and watery overall."
"Loved it, loved it, loved it... What else can I say?"
"The perfect everyday, after-work beer. Pours a nice dark brown color, with a thin, lingering head. Smells very malty. Light carbonation. It leaves a slightly burnt molasses aftertaste."
"Drinkability is good, I'd do it again, great with snacks."
"Dave"
"Poured a clear reddish brown with a thin off white head that wisped away to a slight ring with some slight lacing. Smelled of roasted malts. The taste was a little thin for my taste but I think I am just used to stronger beers. It was smooth roasted malts with a hint of sweet chocolate and some coffee notes. The aftertaste is quite pleasant and there is hardly any bitterness. The mouthfeel is thin but the carbonation makes this one well rounded and very drinkable."
"As a footnote, I'd like to add that if you are put off by this by the brand name alone, try it out. This is so much better than Warsteiner's lager."
"Poured into a pilsner glass from a 11.2oz. bottle. The beer pours a dark copper, forming a 1/2 inch thin white head, which leaves light spots of lace along the glass. The aroma is very malty, along with a slight grassy aroma and a hint of skunkiness. Nothing too complex. The taste is also very malty, a bit of caramel, and finishes with a little bitterness. Smooth light mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Light alcohol and decent flavor. Overall, not too bad. A good afternoon beer."
"Smells nice and malty, but weak and a bit metallic. Taste is headed in the right direction, but never really gets there. Tastes of roasted malts and even a very slight chocolate flavor as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth. Unfortunately the flavor doesn't develop as much as it could, and leaves me wanting some complexity to this. Drinkable though."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style dunkel lager"
"For as dark and heavy as this beer is, its surprisingly drinkable although more than a couple would fill you up pretty good."
"D: Very drinkable. I wish they made this in cans."
"Ruby hued with a very thin head. Almost no retention. Sweet aroma with hints of brown sugar and plums. Given the very sweet smell, I was surprised by the lack of flavor. Overly sweet maltyness up front with a slightly astringent aftertaste. The sweetness was poorly balanced, with very little hop character."
"I drank it sort of fast, because there wasn't much to it. Overall, quite a disappointment."
"12oz bottle poured into a pilsner glass. Pours a dark brown color with copper hues along with an off-white head that provides sporadic lacing. The aroma is of roasted malts and caramel. The taste is definitely on the malty side with caramel, malt, and some faint hops in the finish. Overall, this is a pretty decent brew that I could definitely see myself throwing back a couple more if somebody gave them to me. It is not something that I would purchase again, but it is worth a try."
"Overall: not for everybody (my gf didn't like it) but I'll surely buy more"
"D: This is a decent dunkel. It suffers from a bit of metallic flavours but is still quite pleasant to drink and goes down easy. It makes a good dark session lager and I would buy it again."
"Dark maroon pour with almost no head. Smell was skunky, medicinal band aid and was more than likely really bad. Taste was plastic like, malt, and medicinal. Complete drain pour on this one, and one of the worst I've had. Surprised this one could have been spoiled as the place I bought it from turns over there product pretty well."
"This is a pretty decent beer on the whole, but not something I could get attached to for any period of time."
"D - This is a drinkable beer, with nothing too objectionable. It's a good beer."
" It has a smooth, light-medium bodied mouthfeel with about average drinkability."
"Taste is thin with some maltiness and little to no hops. Not a lot of bubbles here but a strong CO2 flavor. Not unlike the its light colored cousin with some darker malts added. Not a great beer, but not a bad beer, but not interesting. I wouldn't turn one down, but I won't pay for many of them either."
"Poured this beer into a pint glass, It poured a darl cola color with a white head that dicipated quickly and left no lacing. The smell of this beer is of roasted malts and wheat. The taste pretty much follows suit with the smell. The mouthfeel is light with a decent amount of carbonation. The overall drinkablity of this beer is good. It would be a good beer for those nights you want to drink somthing dark, but sessionable enough that you don't want to get messed up."
"Pours a clear deep brown color with a below average head that left a thin ring around the glass. The smell is grainy with a steely and very light roasted malt aroma. Some light nobel hops make their way into the mix. The taste is of light and cracker like malt, slightly roasted, some nobel hop and metallic flavors. The feel is watery and well carbonated, finishes quiet neutral. A rather ho hum brew. Not a bad brew to use in between big brews or just as a session type plug. Just ok."
"M/D: Body is medium and carbonation is high. Drinkability is good. It doesn't bring a lot to the table but what is there is easily downed. Overall a simple but solid brew."
"i thought this is one of the better looking beers i have poured. for a proud german beer i have to give this the benefit of the doubt and say that the shipping got the better of this one. i would not get this again unless it comes from closer to the source."
"The flavors are not complex in this beer. Light malt flavors with a bit of earthiness and that is about it. Some hint of diacetyl until it warms up above fridge temps. It has a rather light body and moderate carbonation. It makes it a very drinkable beer that won't fill you up, get you smashed, or kill your taste buds."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of a style within which I so far haven’t found too much deviation, yet it somehow still surprises me how drinkable this style beer tends to be. This beer is no exception."
"I prefer this stuff on tap, as it seems to be even smoother, but not bad in the bottle."
"Pours a clear dark ruby red with a decent head. Big but a little loose. Nutty aroma- chestnuts and roastiness, with a background metallic note. Taste is on the sweetish side, with good roastiness. Hops aren't really noticeable in terms of flavour. Body is lightish, with a moderate carbonation. Drinkability is ok - nthing off about this, but doesn't knock my socks off either. Sessionable maybe."
"Got this beer when my buddy was moving out of his house. Thanks Kev! It pours a dark amber into my glass. Minimal head retention that leads into a white ring. Smell is very faint, only get some caramel from the roasted malts and a faint hint of hops that come through. Taste starts out sweet with the malts, than has a slight hoppy, dry finish. It's lightly carbonated, so it goes down very smooth. This would be a great session beer for any day of the week. Overall an average Dunkel Lager."
"I've seen this at my local grocery store for a while and never tried it until now... something about the packaging just screamed ""German macro"" to me, and that's pretty much what it is. As such, it's definately better than Amber Bock, easily available, and seems to slide down scarily (is that a word?) easy."
"overall, great drinkability. would be awesome summer drink for lager stand in when you want something more."
"Pours a reddish brown with a 1 finger head that forms extremely quickly and falls almost just as fast. The nose almost is like mild cedar. The taste is too quick though and doesnt linger at all, leaving barely anything for you to remember it by. Everything leading up to that was promising, but the flavor to me is a let down."
"D- complex and tasty, tasty lager, good for style"
"D: Very nice winter session beer. I would not turn this beer there but would first look at my other options on tap before ordering this."
"It's a pleasant beer overall. The roasted nose is unique, and it's a decent dunkel. Worth a try for sure."
"Pretty decent beverage from Warsteiner. A thin off-white head rests atop a walnut brown body. Yet the aroma fails to arouse interest; a moderately malty scent wafts up, but little else. The taste is smooth, with the malt blending well into a smooth mixture of chocolate and a hint of molasses. The mouthfeel is on the bitter side, but acceptably so. Worth grabbing a sixer."
"D: One mug was ore than enough for me, if it had just a little less sweetness I may have gone back for a second."
"I probably wouldn't buy this one personally, but it's better than their Verum. Give it a shot, and you probably won;t be disappointed."
"D - Easily able to drink several of these and with the lower ABV makes a great sessionable brew"
"D: After having a pint of Paulaner Salvator on tap earlier today while enjoying a hot sandwich at Mr. Dunderbaks, this Dunkel is super refreshing. Light on alcohol, very crisp, and just sweet enough to help bypass the holiday import chocolate display. I'm a big fan of Hofbräu Dunkel, but it has some competition now. I wish I could find Warsteiner Dunkel on tap here in Tampa. Very drinkable."
"Looks nice, pours like Coca-Cola with head, glows a little redder but still quite nice. Smell is malty, very malty, As is the flavor, also very malty, slight roasted aroma in there too, a bit sweet but not too much. Only complaint about this one is the slightly metallic aftertaste left after it warms, but other than that it is a pretty solid and easy drinking dunkel that is definitely worth a try."
"The appearance to this beer looks exactly like that of a cola. If I didn't pour it myself I would swear it was a Pepsi or Coke from looks alone. I like the smell with some brown sugar, nuttiness and raisin. Sweet lightly toasted malts on the taste, with a cherry like finish. Bitterness is almost nonexistant. Thin mouthfeel but I expected that. Nothing mind blowing here, but with such a low ABV you can surely drink this by the liter. I know I do!"
"Comes out a nice brown color that allows the light to shine through it. It has an excellent sweet/malty and barley scent. Nice taste, a nice bit of complexity, but overall just a good malty flavor, although it may be a bit too sweet. Goes down extremely smooth and is easy to drink."
"D: Highly drinkable, I ordered a few of these before moving on"
"Eh, I don't love this beer. Not awful but I probably won't be back."
"Dark brown almost black in appearance, with a big white head. Smells of roasted malt. Tastes of roasted malt as well, with a a good amount of hop bitterness to match. Mouth feel is good. Pretty drinkable, it wouldn't be hard to drink a few of these."
"Not the ""biggest"" dunkel I have had, but, not a bad session beer at all. Almost seems as if the flavors were tweaked back."
"This is a pretty good session beer I wouldn't mind drinking again."
"This is a decent beer, if could have a more robust malt profile though."
" On tap it is 31% better in every respect. On tap you would know it is the same beer. So much better."
"Prosit"
"Overall a decent and relatively tasty dunkel. Made a nice filler once the Paulaner Oktoberfest ran out."
"The mouth was left smooth with a hint of dryness. Good with brats and real German music. Makes a nice touch."
"Overall: It is what it is, a malty german brew. If you like that sort of thing you will like it, if you are like me bring on the ales."
"Pretty good beer, although I havent had many Dunkels to compare it to."
"Not a great Dunkel...but very decent."
"Pretty disappointing for me after hearing so many good things about it"
"A bit thin in the mouth, so it does not fill you up or bloat you with carbonation. This would be a great one for people who ""don't like dark beer""."
"drinkability is good. the brew is light, crisp, and refreshing, all the while presenting good concentration and flavor profile. a great dunkel. cheers!"
"Poured a dark brownish reddish color with a creamy 1 finger head that does not last and very little lacing.Sniffs a sweet malty caramel and tastes the same with a medium body that goes down quite easily and enjoyable.Very good beer actually and a couple of these before moving on to something else suits me fine.Worth trying."
"This is not what I was expecting. Were is the rich, robust, roasted malt flavor? There is almost nothing here that resembles a German dunkel. A disappointment."
"Very happy to finally be able to review this one. I love me some german beer, and a dark german lager is probably close to my favorite of the style. Now we had a heck of a night with all these brews going around so my reviews are shorter then normal but you can still get the point. Poured a nice dark brown with a big three inch plus foamy tan head coming across the top. Lots of carbonation and side glass lace throughout. Very malty semll, not alot of profile in the aroma. Taste was very dark, lots of sweet malty grains and a touch of cereal. Good dry finidh. Very smooth with good carbonation. Could have easily had several f these tonight with ease, but there were like 8 different beers being served and I had not had a bunch so I was gonna have to try some more. Overall this was just like I thought it would be and I was very happy with it. A damn fine beer."
"This is a great beer. It has a nice fruity nose, dark yet clear appearance and very nice crisp mouth feel. The head is very minimal but definitely right on for its beer style. I can taste a bit of a chocolate note. Definitely one of my favorite Pilsners."
"This is my favorite style of beer so my review may reflect that. But this is my favorite beer, period. It pours out dark like coffee into my pint glass and a thin light tan head forms. The head disappears somewhat quickly. It smells perfect. Exactly like a beer should smell. Roasted malt and minimal hops. I love beers that don't try to create all kinds of different flavors. I'm a fan of the German Purity Law of 1516. There seems to be a low amount of carbonation. Just a tiny bit flat. If I were to participate in BEERFEST this would be the beer I would want to consume. Great beer. Reinheitsgebot is best."
"I thought this was a very tasty beer. Reddish-black in color with nice head that managed to hang around a while.. Slight spicy maltiness with clean finish. Sweet malt and caramel aroma. Mouthfeel was very pleasant.Traditional dark brown German lager. Very high on the drinkability scale."
"well, it looks good. its smell is pretty bad. The alcohol is pungent, but there is little else desirable. I have no desire to smell it any further. there is a little bit of taste to speak of. I would have to rank it no far above a yingling, unfortunately. I wouldn't buy another sixer of this. I'm very disappointed."
"This beer poured a clear dark brown with a thin white head. The smell is malt and caramel. The taste is strong of malt and has some chocolate characteristics. The mouthfeel very full, but short of heavy  it seems well suited. I was surprised at how easy to drink this beer is. This would definitely be something to consider for sessions."
"D - This is another very good beer from Warsteiner. It reminds me of a good porter."
"Thin, slightly watery. It tastes like a pilsener but with a darker finish. Not recommended."
"Warsteiner Premium Dunkel pours a very dark brown with a thin head that quickly settles to a ring around the edge of the glass. The aroma is burnt coffee. The taste is disappointing, a kind of harsh bitterness is all I can taste. The mouthfeel is very thin. I expected more."
"Bought a 12 pack of bottles for $16 with a best on date of 4/14/08. Pours a very dark, rusty brown that you can see through if held up to the light. Average head and nice lacing. Smells of a slightly overcooked grain? That description really doesn't do it justice, but that's what I smelled. You pick up the aroma nicely on every sip This is a very nice, medium bodied, smooth beer. The smoothness caught me by surprise. It's a little dry and has a pleasant aftertaste. This drinks very easily. I caught myself drinking the 2nd bottle too fast. I think that's a good sign. I really enjoyed this brew. Very much worth it. Highly recommended. hic...."
"Poured from the bottle, came out a nice dark brown, with some amber tones. Mild and a little light head, did not retain too well, mediocre lacing. Smell was nice but a little faint, some nice malt aromas. Taste was real nice, very smooth, some good malty and chocolaty taste. Had it with some dark chocolate, went great together. Mouthfeel a little lighter than expected, but clean and smooth, went down great. All in all, very nice."
"Overall, competent, but not impressive. Aroma and flavours are gentle, not particularly pronounced. Some malt and chocolatiness. Thin-bodied. A little too subdued to be a memorable quaff, but nothing off-putting about this one."
"A decent ""sessionable"" dunkel lager. Pretty inoffensive. Nothing particularly special, though, IMO. I have to admit this is one I liked more in the past."
"Warsteiner is tasty so I took a whirl. Not much bottle smell, roasted malt detable but kind of corny. Poured into a chalice and got a fizzy head with big bubbles that was there and gone. Very dark, not much light passing through. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated, too much. Taste is hints of dark caramel with only a very slight bitter hopping. Nothing really stands out. Alot blander than I expected. Very drinkable brew but I was expecting more."
"d - i enjoyed this one, nice sipper and definitely better a little warmer."
"My German frau told me this wasn't as good as the regular Warsteiner (the ""Verum"")...and now I have to agree. It lacks character. Ridiculously easy drinking, but I can think of a few session-worthy beers with a lot more flavor."
"An easy session dunkel for sure."
"Was able to give this brew a try on tap and I guess I was a little disappointed. While I felt that it was a fair to good brew I was expecting a lot more. The color was chestnut brown with a nice frothy head, off white in color, which had fair retention and did leave a nice amount of lacing at the top of the glass. While the presentation was nice the aroma just seemed to be missing something, I was able to pick up the scent of malts which seemed to be somewhat sweet with a slightly caramel aroma maybe slightly roasted. The taste was fair, again with the taste it seemed to be missing something, just did not have flavors that carried its way through. The flavors that I pick up are a sweet malt flavor that just seems slightly blah to me, also finishes noticeably dry which is not a bad thing. Based on the presentation I guess I was expecting more in both of the areas of Taste and Aroma. I wonder if this beer would be better from the bottle or a fresh keg, not sure how long this one had been on. Anyway it is a serviceable beer just did not meet expectations."
"Drinkability: Quaffable, but not memorable. Certainly an improvement over the regular warsteiner."
"Pours a dark amber, almost cola like, not much head either. Smells malty and sweet. Alcohol stings the tounge at first, chocolately malt is delightful little to no hop presence. Mouthfeel is warm and full. a little too watery overall but still a good beer."
"Drinkable? Yes. However this is not my favorite dunkle. I think this leaves a bit to be desired in the flavor profile. But it is a good refreshing beer with a light body and more flavor than your average Pils."
"Drinkability- For as dark and heavy as this beer is, its suprisingly drinkable although more than a couple would fill you up pretty good."
"D: Pleasant, easy to drink. Just a solid, sessionable (under 5% abv) beer...it was what I was in the mood for..."
"dark amber in color with a simple head that fades quickly. Smell and taste of roasted malts with a bit of coffee and honey having a light to medium mouthfeel. Overall not to bad, seems to lack the body leaving it a bit thin and and having a dry finish."
"D - Alright. I don't think I will bother with it again. Sessionable, but I actually prefer Guinness (which I would say has a similar enough flavor to act as substitute)."
"Drinkability - Not in my regular stock, but if you keep pouring this one, I'm going to keep drinking them."
"Some caramel flavors stand out in this one, but not much else. I would say this is a little above average. Worth a try."
"Never had a German beer before, was very suprised as how well it went down."
"I will definitely drink this beer again, just not sure I'll choose it over others when the selection is considerable."
"This is not very good and I think it is overrated."
"i'd rather keep smelling it than taste it some more. the hops are important enough, but the malts behind are somewhat impotent. there is a ghosting of roasted malts but otherwise i can't really tell it's a dunkel"
"Cheers!!!"
"Pours a very dark brown amber color with a short off-white head that gives way to a thin lace. Nose is dark bready malts along with a bit of hazelnut. Taste begins with a roasted maltiness followed by a bit of coffee and some mildly bitter hops. Finishes a bit dry. An easy drinking dunkel that seems to need a bit more character."
"The brew finishes dry, and has a medium body. This is a brew that I'd probably not buy again. There's got to be better out there, this is just so-so, middle of the line, nothing to write home about."
"Mouthfeel is not thin, but is not overpoweringly sticky. I found this beer fairly drinkable, and on those times when I want something very malty (I should add, in the interest of full disclosure, that I'm usually looking for something hoppy), I would not rule this out."
"Drinkability is okay, but not my brew of choice."
"Poured a ruby brown with quickly reducing head, down to a ring.I taste mostly malts with a bit of toasted malts or coffee at the end, this beer finishes very quickly, almost no aftertaste at all. Since there is nothing to offend at all it is quite drinkable, even pleasant, but there are better beers around."
"Overall this beer was fairly bland, but I've had worse. Taste was familiar for a dunkel lager, but seemed watered down. Lacked complexity and compelling flavor. If you're into buying inoffensive imports and aren't afraid of beer with color, this one's for you. If you like full-flavored brews, pass."
"Drinkability/Overall - This Dunkel isn't going to blow you away with complexity, but if nothing else is available at the time, it is a pleasant beer. I'm sure I'll cross paths with this lager again. Prost!"
"Nothing to write home about. A nice light refreshing beer. No outstanding qualities."
"Although the taste doesn't compel me to open another bottle, the heaviness is negligible so if it's your thing I could see drinking more than a few."
"D - Not earth-moving, but definitely a nice beer. I was pleased to see it on tap, and will get it again."
"On tap in a Kings pint. Small head, fell quickly to nothing. Not even surface bubbles. Too dark to determine clarity. A solid middle-of-the-road dark lager. Comparable to Mexican dark lagers, but slightly maltier with less head. Little body to back up the color, even for a dark lager."
"I was really disappointed by this beer, so much so that I think it may have just been a bad sample. I used to drink this occassionally, before I started rating and trying various beers, and I liked it. But Ill go with what I had tonite. Poured to a medium brown, with a very thin off-white head, that dissipated almost immediately, and left little lacing. Aroma was almost skunky, with just a hint of malt. Flavor was nothing special, and the finish was very dry. I will most likely try this one again just to give it a fair shot at redemption."
"Ahh.. one of my favorite widely distributed beers. This has a dark coffee like color. Mildy transparent. Not sure how to explain it, but when I taste it, it gives me a warm fuzzy feeling. From opening to tipping the bottle up, it is great tasting all the way through, Very nice beer. Highly recommened. I have introduced this beer to many of friends, and have yet had anybody tell me that it isn't good. Even the ""just give me a beer"" friends. They all seem to like it."
"A good solid commercial German dunkel...no surprises but very drinkable and satisfying."
"GET MY BUZZ ON-n"
"Slainte!"
"Incredibly thick and heavy aftertaste that sits on the tongue for a while. This is one you may have to choke down. Considering how dark it is, it is relatively smooth, but not one where you can knock back 3-4 of them."
"this is a nice beer from warsteiner, malty rich, with some good hop spice."
"Warsteiner Premium Dunkel was a dark reddish brown color and clear. The tan head soon dissipated to a thin layer, but remained for a while, leaving a little spotted lace behind. The aroma was light and mostly malt. The taste was lightly malty with a little roasted character. The body was just under medium with plenty of carbonation. This is a decent dark lager and would make an good session beer."
"If this were, say, Hamms Dark, Id be really impressed, but its not, so Im a bit pissed. Over all, it was very easy to drink, but for what I paid for it added to the limp flavor, it really didnt deliver."
"Very drinkable, but I only had one with my meal."
"Brown but translucent body with almost no carbonation or head. Interesting smell. Roasty and caramel dominate. Tastes very roasty with caramel and coffee notes. Very very good. Well balanced despite the presence of afformentioned flavors and scents. Pretty good for a lager."
"Drinkability: Overall, a nice presentation. I could definitely have a few of these in a row."
"I grabbed a 12er of this that happened to be on sale at the local Krogers. Since I love a good, Dunkel i couldn't resist. The smell and appearance were both average for dunkels I would say. There was nothing to exceptional worth noting, anyways. The taste was pretty good. You get a nice feel of roasted malts, and some sweetness blended in there for what I would call a good tasting beer. The mouthfeel is pretty good, smooth all around and the drinkability is pretty high, but then drinkability is high on most any good beer."
"edit: I had another one later and it proved to be more enjoyable the second time around. I'm bumping the taste and mouthfeel up just a little."
"Pours a dark mahogany with excellent clarity. One finger of dense, soapy head is pale tan and shows decent retention with a few specs of lacing. Pale and roasted malt in the nose, with a soft-dark fruit aroma. Pale malt sweetness upfront, with toasty munich malt and a weak nutty flavor in the backgreund. Plenty of Saaz flavor, mabye some Hallertau as well. Dry aftertaste, again all noble- malty sweetness and hop bitterness are balanced and very agreeable. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied is perhaps a bit too crisp, but it finishes mostly clean with a mild hop bite and some roasted notes. The non-residual mouthfeel is highly drinkable, but the flavor is a little dissapointing."
"Bottle pours to a cola-like appearance with minimal head that disappears quickly. A very nice, enticing aroma of sweet raisins and plums. The taste is very smooth and pleasant with a nice balance of mild sweetness and bitterness, though dark beer enthusiasts will find it watery. Evidence of malt and caramel. Nice but not outstanding, I would have this again though not my first choice."
"Not what I would call drinkable. I'm glad that there wasn't more in the fridge to finish off."
"Not one of my favorite styles, but a generally well-made example."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and carbonated, with a slight aftertaste that is very short in duration. Very drinkable ale, due to it's light, crisp nature and it's low alcohol content. A great beer for the summertime. This is one I bring to get-together where most of the people there drink macroswill. This is also one I'll purchase if the establishment in which I find myself has nothing better."
"This is a favorite for backyard parties. Warsteiner is probably one of the best German macro imports; and the Dunkel is even better. You don't have to be a dark beer lover to enjoy it. Pours a gorgeous dark amber, with a foamy tan head. The smell is mild hops and, unlike the original Warsteiner, the hops are equally mild in the taste. Nice mouthful, light carbonation, and just enough roasted malt flavor to satisfy. Just enough bitterness in the aftertaste to keep you wanting more. Excellent for an ""easy to get"" German dark."
"Drinkability: A nice, easy drinking, sessionable beer. A good, widely available Dunkel, but not quite a top notch dunkel, IMO."
"This is a personal favorite and long-time tailgating companion. Wonderful with brats. Highly recommended as a beer to start the unwashed masses on the path from mega-swills to quality beer."
"Cheers!"
"I got this after trying the verum and really liking it. Dark lagers are kind of special in a way. They're not especially common here. It poured dark but not as dark as a stout. Typically roasted flavor with a semi-sweet flavor of carmelized sugars. Kind of a simple flavor without too much depth typical of a lager. It could have much more flavor the verum does, but I think the roasted flavor actually contributes to this. Kind of a dull thin mouthfeel. Not especially drinkable for a lager. Not a bad beer, but I was much more impressed with the Vahrshteiner verum so I'll probably get that instead next time. In comparison with another beer of the same style however, it is lightyears ahead of Modelo Negro. Even after drinking Modelo with wisky it didn't taste as good as the Warsteiner. If by chance you're a modelo fan try this instead you might like it better."
"Drank okay on a warm spring day in a nice biergarten here in the city's oldest German Restaraunt (Edelweiss) I don't think that unduly influnce my score, but it didn't hurt!"
"Overall: Much better than you average garden variety import beerworth a try."
"Pretty good beer. Really great dunkels are hard to come by in my experience, but this one isn't bad at all."
"Overall impression: Not the most complex beer out there, but highly drinkable. Nice session beer as far as I'm concerned."
"Taste is better than the nose thankfully, with a creamy succulent mouthfeel. Caramel and roasted malt are the main flavor components. Not overly comples hence a uncanny smoothness making the beer fairly drinkable."
"A very drinkable dark lager and a good looking one too. Sweeter than the regular Warsteiner but by no means is this a bock beer. If you like lots of toasted grain taste and mild hop levels then this beer is for you. The phrase Liquid Bread applies to this beer."
"What a beer! Goes down easy with its nice robust flavor from the roasted malts, it really goes down smooth! Light, but rich in flavor, and it is very easy to drink with a bratwurst or some knackwurst. Grab one of these on draft, and don't be afraid of the dark!"
"Opinion: I have had this beer on multiple occasions, and I must say that as the first beer of the evening, it tastes a lot better than I have had it before. It has a rich malty profile that really is akin to a Munich Dunkel. I think that the dark caramel malts were a bit much, and the beer would do a bit better by supplementing some CaraMunich for the crystal. Still, this is a tasty beer and one that I will surely be drinking again."
"Poured a mildly hazy ,deep mahogany-brown , with a half inch , off-white head. Smell is malty and slighly buttery , hints of raisin bread , some faint hops. Taste is crisp but rich maltiness , again some raisin qualities , some diacetyl / caramel , slight dark fruit-bread flavors , some balancing hops but not very bitter at all. Quite delicious! Mouthfeel is light and smooth with a bready aftertaste coating the tongue for a second. I found this Dunkel lager to be quite tasty and drinkable."
"Kind of a decent quality, darkened and sweetened macro lager."
"Overall: Good all around beer,I love warseiner so I could be biased here..."
"Flavor is basically malty goodness, with solid doses of caramel and some chocolate highlights. I'd call this one hearty, but really misses some depth. Came off more as a medium bodied, well done homebrew. Overall, quite average, very ""meh."""
"This is not a perfect beer, but it is a perfectly drinkable beer. Complex, yet simple, it explores the world of your tongue without challenging or offending it. This is why we drink beer. Prost!"
"updated 2-12-08 (the ""sour"" experience)...would actually be lower but I took the middle ground. Well within the best by date."
"Verdict- A nice option as an easy-drinking pub beer."
"Overall impression is that I feel it'll take me very little effort to finish the six pack tonight, it's the sort of beer that is unobtrusive enough to not have to take center stage yet I find myself looking at it every so often and admiring it's complex yet humble character."
" There was a faint sort of spice that presented itself after the beer warmed up a little but that was about it. When it was all said and done, the glass was the best part of the experience."
"Last swigs: Seems to be a spot on version of the Dunkel style with a bit of root beer meets grain."
"Medium-dark color, smooth and very drinkable. Fairly light bodied I feel for a dark beer. Dark roasted taste, slight bitterness that quickly dissipates. Also the head is good, light cream to it, but also dissapears fairly quick. Lacing lasted for a while. A beer I will definetly drink again when the time is right."
"Dark Brown, head doesn't stick around long at all. I tried this one from draft. Not too dark, but just dark enough to offer the basic flavors that should come with a dark beer. Roasty malt, caramel, slight cocoa, raisen. On the bitter side for me. Too much hopps maybe. Also a tad too much carbonation for me, forcing me to do a fair bit of burping. Finish is fairly smoth, nice, and clean however leaving that dark roasted flavor lingering which is nice."
"Enjoyed at Castle on King in Kitchener, ON. Clear, dark chestnut beer topped by a tan head with some lacing. Spicy, malty nose with a bit more roast and noble hops in the flavour. Slightly yeasty. Dry finish with lingering malt character. Overall, a decent drink."
"Pours a appreciative dark brown with a half-finger creamy head that doesn't linger long. Smells sweetly of a coffee/caramel aroma with smoky overtones of malt. Lighter than that of a traditional German dunkel, but not watery by any means, still a filling brew. Great mouthfeel, carbonation is present but not overpowering considering the weight of the beer. This was one of my first German beers, would definitely recommend for anyone just getting into German beers without much dark beer experience."
"Pours a dark brown,with a redish hue. Tan head disappears quickly,and not much lacing. Smell is of carmel and malt. Mouthfeel is thin,with a bit of carbination. Flavor is sweet,and a bit roasted. This beer is light,but has a good flavor. Very drinkable.Try it!"
"this is a very solid everyday session beer, i think. i enjoy it quite a bit with food. not as good as Capital's Munich Dark but still a good beer."
"I was quite suprised by this brew. Very drinkable and very flavorful. poured out to a dark brown color with a 1/4 inch head of cream colored foam. Medium level of carbonation. Aromas of roasted malts, grain and earth. Taste was rather complex; flavors of nuts, roased malt, herbs and grain were well blended and kept the palate entertained. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, making this brew good for nearly any time of day or year. Good drinkability; I will be looking for this in bottles next trip to the beer store. Recommended."
"12 ounce bottle, with best before dating of July '06. Pours clear, dark rum colored with a tan hea dthat leaves respectable lacing. Nose is lightly of malt and some honey. Quite dirnkable lager, minor notes of honey and vanilla with clean and smooth malty underpinnings. Middle of the road dark lager, decent if unspectacular sessioner."
"A finely carbonated brew on tap, I would say to anyone who enjoys dark, malty brews to give this one a sample. The 4.9% make this a good brew for the duration. Ill be picking up more for the fall season (or Ill be back at the Fox&Hound for more)."
"A fairly straightforward brew. Doesnt really wow me, but you can easily toss back quite a few of these without a problem."
"Pours a dark coffee brown, with a tiny head that dissipates quickly. Sweet and mildly herbal aroma. The taste is heavy on the dark carmel malts (of course), with hints of raisin and a tea-like flavor as well. Not really as impressive as it sounds. Still, despite not breaking any new ground, this is a simple and tasty dunkel. Worth a try."
"Notes: refreshing brew, not much else to say"
"This is nothing spectacular, but nothing to be sneezed at either. Very drinkable. And, frankly, I don't see many dunkel lagers around. Definitely ""worth a try."""
"Cheers!"
"Presented itself in a chestnut brown hue with a medium to light head. Smelled crisp and clean with no unpleasantness. Taste was pleasant with a big malty flavor along with hints of cocoa and coffee. Mouthfeel felt only slightly carbonated with an absence of aftertaste. Certainly, an adequate addition to the refrigerator on a year round basis. A good, yet simple, dunkel to round out ones selection."
"Light bodied, actually a little thin but smooth and easily drinkable. Decent but nothing special."
"This is a solid German Dunkel. Heavy on the malts, well balanced and easy to drink."
"A mediocre dark brew it pours a nice brownish stain look with little to no head but that head that does exist is very sticky. The aromas i couldent put my finger on and the taste was a little lite for a darker brew. It had a crisp dry finish with little to no bite and maybe a little to much carbonation."
"EDIT: In recent years I've seen this showing up super-fresh in paper sealed cases with dates on them. When you find one with a ""drink by"" date that's 5-8 months into the future, GRAB IT. It's always going to be on the hoppier side compared to a Bavarian dunkel, but it's still good."
"A smooth and tempting mouthfeel makes this a pretty good beer. I cant wait to enjoy the rest of the sixer I bought."
"Dunkels, along with some Scottish ales, are the only dark beers I drink in summer. This one has earned a place in my refridgerator to compliment my steak and potatoes. All in all, a solid offering from one of Germany's big importers."
"Warsteiner Dunkle is dark chestnut brown in color with an average-sized, light brown head. The aroma is of generic German toasted malts. Not a bad aroma, but nothing outstanding. The taste is all toasted and bready German malts. A little grain flavor comes into play towards the finish. The malt flavor here is very good, but doesn't have that extra something to set this beer apart from some of the better beers of this style. Still, this is easy to find, reliable, and nicely priced. This will be in my fridge again."
"poured a beautiful deep copper color with slightly off-white quickly disappearing head. Smell is of caramel, coffee, roasted grains. Taste is a bit disappointing becasue the promises of the smell do not follow through. Finish is a slight bitterness with caramel notes. Beer is good but just does not seem to excel in any aspect."
"Drinkability: Very clean and drinkable; well-made"
"Appearance is a medium dark brown, that pours a creamy head with some lace retention. The aroma contains hints of vegetable, prune and brown sugar. Mouthfeel is average in carbonation, dry and mild on both hops and malt. Some hint that the Dunkel comes from caramel additives rather than cask aging. The finish is dry and slightly artificial tasting. Not up to Warsteiner's standards with their other beers."
"This poured with a surprisingly nice head that managed to do a fair amount of lacing down the glass for a lager. The smell was malty, bready, caramel and burnt toast. The flavor was similar to the aroma with a little bit of diacetyl in there making it slightly sticky. I enjoyed it's low carbonation although some may not. I think this is a great dunkel and why shouldn't it be? It's Warsteiner after all."
"Impression: Nicely balanced, clean and crisp. Creamy dark lager."
"Overall, easy to drink and rather refreshing...not too shabby, but I've had much better."
"Bottle. Pours nut brown to mahagoney with some brown head as it pours then completely dissipates. Aroma is caramel and brown sugar malt with a light chocolate nose. Initial flavor is fizzy caramel malt, slightly toasted. Finishes a little hoppy and spicy with faint chocolate notes. Medium bodied and fizzy palate, warming."
"Dark, but with strands of gold and amber. The head was thin and rapidly diminished. Overpowering scent of sweet wheat and lightly-spiced fruits. The smell is very agreeable, but not terribly complex. Tastes more of chocolate and pine sap than indicated by the smell. It's very nice, actually. Simple and clean with a sweet finish."
"Dark amber cola brown with a small, soft, light tan head that doesn't last too long. Nose is lightly sweetened roasted malts, some dark fruit, and spicy hop bitter. Taste starts with toasted/roasted malts and tobacco. Faint caramelly sweetness and grapes. Minor cardboard in the finish with some roasty bitterness. Not bad. Mouthfeel is a little thin and over carbonated."
"I like Warsteiner Premium Verum... a lot, (I drink it about 45% to 55% of the time), this Premium Dunkel is a bit of a disappointment, it is a shame that I could not give it higher marks."
"The beer pours a translucent brown color with a thick towering offwhite head. The aroma is good. It has a roasted malt scent with a sweet caramel aroma. It also has a dry yeast scent as well. The taste is decent. It has a very dry malty flavor that boasts of crystal malts and lager yeast. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a decent dunkel. I prefer them to be less dry and sweeter, but it goes down easy nonetheless."
"Extremely dark brown, sheets of ruby red highlights. An aroma of sweet malts and dried grains, the nose has some definite earthy characteristics going on. A fine, crisp medium-mouthfeel; sweet malts, molasses and oats. Becomes dry and subtle, weak come as you are tastings of coffee beans and hints of earthy hops. Not too shabby."
"Drinkability: glad it it was just a tasting, I couldn't drink anymore of this. Just more megabrew swill to me. I'm off the Warsteiner line for good."
"Mouthfeel: It has a good body, neither thick or thin, light-medium carbonation. Is is on bland side, but very drinkable, I could see myself drinking these on a hot summer day."
"Watery brown colour, with odd old smell. Tastes like sucking on a piece of cloth. If you really need to drink. Very grainy, too much carbonation. Like a club soda with some cheap gin or scotch drop poured in. Some malts, perhaps a hint of roast, acidic."
"Overall, a rather boring beer. Not much really stood out in this beer. It poured dark in color, but with a thin appearance. The head was thick and frothy. The aroma was slightly malty. The flavor was malty again, with a slightly creamy finish. I could not notice any hops. The mouthfeel was overall kind of flat. It kind of reminded me of a toned down mild, perhaps good as a session beer?"
"Hard to believe that I've never had this. I'm generally not a huge Dunkel fan and I suppose my general lack of interest in this beer echoes that sentiment. It starts out decently enough. A ruby tinged brown with an off white 1 finger head which quickly retreated to being merely lacing. Smell was not as assertive as I was expecting, roasty notes noticably when you inhale super deep. Some sweetness was also detected. Taste is a little thin. Starts and ends sweet. Note a whole lot of roast going on. Very gulpable though. I'd take this over Premium Verum in a pinch."
"This is the only beer to drink when you're at a Reds game."
"Overall, I expect a Dunkel to be a bit fuller and less astringent. Not bad, but not as great as a great name from Germany should be."
"I didn't mind this beer for a couple of reasons. It's extremely cheap in bottle shops in Italy (as is most beer), and it's extremly drinkable. Poured a decent haed that dissapeared really fast. It had the smell and taste of roasted malt and was a little sweet which is always good. I'd definatly drink this again because although it's nowhere near my favourite Dunkel, it was very drinkable."
"Average brew."
"Taste was ok as well. Caramel and malts are the backbone to this brew. It's a touch of the sweet side, but the cocoa balances the sweetness out. Wasn't too bad I gotta admit. Perhaps it was a little too soft on the palate. On-tap this was pretty decent, but I don't know how much better it is in the bottle. But this was good."
"""4"'s across the board for this one. Mighty tasty indeed. Poured a rusty brown with a nice finger or so head that stuck around for about 2 minutes. Decent lacing. Smelled of hops and surprisingly, a tiny bit bready. Little bit of malt trying to come through. As far as the taste, I thought it tasted like regular Warsteiner Lager, just a little less hoppy. Mouthfeel was nice and smooth with very little carbonation. Overall, I really liked this one. A good session beer, this."
"nice clear, bark brown body. very nice head. smells of fresh pils hops and a little bready. mmmm starts off fresh and crisp like a pilsner, but the middle and finish doesnt have a bite like a pils. it is much much smoother, almost dangerous. very light. taste of roasted malt. finish is clean, with just a little hops for character. The mouth feel is on the light side, but in a refreshing way. and no aftertaste to speak of. so smooth, light mouth feel, not lacking in taste, equals a great drink ability."
"Funny, that after drinking better beer, something you used to like doesn't taste as good. That's what happened with this dunkel. My friend introduced me to this after he returned from a stay overseas in Germany with the Army. It poured a dark brown with a head that quickly dissapated. There really wasn't any aroma. The taste was malty, metallic and thin with a little hops. Mouthfeel was watery. Now this beer is better than most American macros but really is barely average"
"I've never had what I consider to be a good Munich Dunkel Lager. I'm sure they exist and I'd love to have one some day. That day is not today however; Warsteiner Premium Dunkel just doesn't cut it. The back label actually reads 'because life is too short to drink cheap beer'. My thoughts exactly."
"Drinkability  They've been doing it since 1753. This is a good, simple, uncomplicated offering from Warsteiner."
"Overall.. drinakble.. unoffensive, but certainly nothing to make a man jump up and holler. (For the record.. I would take this over Newcastle any two days of the week)"
"All over drinkability suffers from the smell but this is still a solid beer."
"Dark copper rubyish color, thin beige cap, keeps a skim for a while, minimal lacing in small spots and strings. Aroma has a gentle but appealing dark bready aroma, very slightly sweet and tangy. Taste is quite mild with a slight lagerish twang of sweetness, weakened caramel and the mildest of mild roast. Clean, poofy thin body, not watery, just empty with some slight tangy sweetness and starch. I thought I was doing myself a favor picking this up on sale, but nah, not really. No where near what a good dunkel should be at."
"M&D: Very light on the tongue, and easily drinkable."
"Final Thought: At the price, a staple in the fridge... a quality German dunkel!"
"Rusty malt wet leather smell to the brew. Dark brown color to the brew in the pint glass. A slight pale grey head is present after pour but it is nothing impressive. Smoothish thinnish mouth. The taste is of plums and dark fruitsup front with a sweetish sharp tasting malt finish. It was ok but not the after dinner beer I was looking for..."
"Pours a nice light tan colored full head. Doesn't last too long, but settles into a nice ring. Root beer colored with little carbonation. It has a faint smell of alcohol and malt. The taste contains that flavors of malt, faint caramel, but not sweet, and just a bit of alcohol. A little bitter on the aftertaste. Not real complex. The mouth feel is light for a German brew. This is a real nice beer that is different from beers in its price range. At the price, it is worth having a few bottles around."
"Pours a lighter cola color with a touch of deep orange highlights. Medium cream colored head when decanted into the fluted Warsteiner pils glass. Good Munich Dunkel and Vienna malt profile, very fresh smelling. Not much hops to discern. Refreshing beer with every sip. Oddly, a bit husky in the finish, but not in an off way. Good summer quaffer."
"Medium/thin on the tongue and goes down easy."
"Dark amber color with a frothy beige head that leaves virtually no lace on the glass. The head subsides quickly into nothing, releasing malty aromas, either caramel or crystal. The body is on the medium-thin side, with the right amount of carbonation. The malts are readily evident as a rich, roasted flavor, but not as assertive as they should be. Finishes with a fruity aftertaste. Very smooth and drinkable, good for a post-work session, but not really a dunkel aside from color."
"Really, one of the more under-appreciated braueries in Germany, I had to try this one when I saw it was available. This Bier poured out a deep and rich dark colour, and the head was both apparent and long-lasting. The aroma was sweet in a fruit and sugar way, if that makes any sense. This brew tasted good and malty, with good notes of grain and roasted malt. I know there are many far superior, but this one is still not bad and in fact, well above average."
"Pours a dark brown liruid, with no head at all. No lace left on the glass at all. Smells slightly of a roasted malt, but also sweetish. Taste was not bad, a small amount of roasted flavor, with very little bitterness. It seemed a bit thin in the mouthfeel department. It was however, very drinkable. This wasn't as bad as it sounds, it just didn't stand out. There wasn't a whole lot of anything in this beer. It was smooth though."
"this stuff is cheap. like 8 bucks a 12 pack cheap. its pours out a deep bronze, good size white frothy head. scents of sweet/dark malt and some raisins come up with a swirl of the glass. in the mouth it is sweet. grainy and sweet. some dark fruit undertones and coffee like flavors peek their heads out...but all i can really think of is the sweet dark grainy malt. it is the show. a little watery in the mouth, could be a bit heavier being a dunkle and all (atleast IMO). it is drinkable and cheap...lots of the punk kids drink it since its in the same price range as the big 3 and alot tastier. good budget/party beer."
"The mouthfeel was thin and somewhat watery. This creates a very drinkable dunkel, and could be a decent afternoon session beer that won't weigh you down."
"This is not a bad beer per say, but as you can tell by the tone of my review this beer really didn't meet the expectations I was giving it. You can very easily slap a ""macro-dunkel"" tag on this one. There are no off-flavors in the beer, it is quite easy to drink and the maltiness is pleasing to the palette, but this beer hovers a bit above the level of average."
"The last beer in my Christmas gift pack from the inlaws. Dark brown in color but still some what see through. Very small white head that doesn't seem to last at all. The smell is grainy and malty. Not that nice at all. Flavor is not so smooth as some burnt flavors come through. I had hoped it to be a bit more balanced and smooth but no dice. Earthy and uneven. I really don't care for it. I would like to try this beer on tap from the source to compare the difference."
"This beer has to be served at the right temperature or else it doesnt taste right. Too warm and it gets pretty yeasty, too cold and the malt is suppressed too much."
"This beer poured nice and dark with a white head about 2 finger widths. It was a light head that held a slight malty smell. Not much hop smell that I could detect. The tatse was malty much like the smell. Toward the end it almost had a roasted or smoked taste to it. Very light in the mouth and easy to drink. Nothing really stood out about this beer."
"Nice looking beer. Dark clear golden brown with a frothy white head.Aroma is weak, with some slight skunkiness and some grains. This starts off like your average american lager, then a small dose of hops hits and finishes with a welcome mild malt flavor. Very clean mouthfeel, somewhat watery. I could drink this all day. Not a great beer, but a good session brew with nothing offensive going on."
"Frankly, this is not a very refreshing or welcoming beer, in my opinion. I was disappointed."
"When poured into a glass you get a nice almost meriange like lite tan head. A light malt aroma can be gotten by slightly swirlling the beer. As the beer hits your mouth you get, again, a light roasted malt. That malt note finishes just ever so sweet and clean on the finish. Not as exteremly flavorful as I generaly like but a nice clean tasting beer that is definitely a step above the Mega brews."
"Overall, a dissappointing beer. Starts out looking and smelling great, with a nice head, good lacing, reddish brown color, and an aroma dominated by spicy Saaz hops...then the moment of truth. The taste lacks any character but water! What is going on here? It is a frustrating experience. This stuff is drinkable, but damn, you'd think the flavors would be more assertive!"
"This dunkel begins with an attractive beige head that slowly diminishes to a thin ring; the lacing doesn't quite stick for the duration. The aroma hints at raisins, molasses and nuts that aren't as evident in the slightly roasted malt taste. The colour of a dark sherry and light-bodied on the palate, the taste of Warsteiner Dunkel isn't as robust as I was expecting but it goes down easily and I'd probably buy it again."
"A clear, russett brown body is capped by a short head of creamy, off-white foam that holds well before dropping to a thin collar. The nose is clean with the exception of some slight lager yeast sulphur. It offers a light note of dark kilned malt, but it's neither chocolatey or roasty. Its medium body and fine, median carbonation leave it gently crisp and smooth in the mouth. The flavor reveals a bit more chocolate and dark caramel than the nose suggests (but not much more), and an edge of floral/grassy hops rounds it out. It finishes dry with some light residual bitterness and a mild, lingering, dark maltiness."
"On draught at the German Village Oktoberfest. Dark reddish-brown with a thin beige head. The aroma is lightly nutty. It is light-bodied for a Dunkel, with notes of coffee and nuts. The finish is crisp which makes this a decent session beer overall. However it lacks any real character or complexity."
"Medium brown color. Medium head. Aroma is malty. A medium bodied dunkel. Malts are slightly roasted and a touch chocolaty. Hops are mild spicy. Well balanced. Smooth. Light and refreshing. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"Got this as a single in a build your own six pack deal at a local liquor store. It's one of two I got that are past the freshness date. If I ever see this where I can pick it up as a single, and it is fresh, I'll try it again, but as it stands, I'm not a fan of this at all."
"A beauty that is impressive in appearance and tastes good as well. The dunkel is dark amber with a firm tan head and decent lacing. The aroma is malty and has a bit of breadiness added in to tne mix. Clearly the flavor has a strong malt start, but it also has a nicely dry finish. The feel is medium and it is not a crisp as desired. Nice drinkability."
"Drink UP"
"Pours with a deep amber body, with a very light frothy head. It has a nice earthy aroma, with plenty of malt, and a bit of grass. Taste is similar, with nice malt and grain flavor and a fair amount of hops. Substantial mouthfeel, rolls over the tongue. A pleasant Dunkel, but there are better ones out there."
"Not very drinkable at all..i wonder if there was some problem with the keg?"
"If I wanted to give someone a sample of what a real dunkel at beirgarden in germany tastes like I might give them this and say ""it's like this, but better"" It's not too bad, but I've had a lot better."
"Very drinkable German import. Pours very dark brown and clear with little head that dissipates to a very thin to nonexistant line of foam. Hop aroma is lightly floral but is too mild to be noteworthy. Very malty and grainy, an exceptionally smooth mouthfeel with no hint of bitterness or roughness. Some coffee and caramel like undertones. A good well rounded and drinkable session beer."
"Flavor is light and roasty, yet sweet. Very clean, well done. Mild herbal hopping comes through towards the end and finishes the beer with a light crispness. Not exceptionally flavorful, but extremely clean. Moderate small bubbled carbonation. Smooth. Aftertaste is very mild, leaving little flavor to be wanting more, but still a very good pint. I'd take another."
"It's okay, nothing very exciting. I think I was expecting a bit more, given the 'royal' label and all. This beer underachieves its hype. It's certainly not bad, just not all that noteworthy."
"This beer poured a cloudy, coffee-brown color with thin, white foam that settled and clung to the glass. The smell was light and malty. The taste was malty with overtones of coffee, caramel, and slightly sweet biscuit. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium body and low carbonation. It was relatively clean but a bit thin. This was a decent dunkel and easy to drink."
"Budweiser may claim to be the king of beers, but it says right here on the label, ""Die Koenigin unter den bieren."" Can't argue with that. Looks absolutely lovely when poured, a nice deep brown color. Not a whole lot in the way of smell, but it tastes pretty good, goes down smooth, and leaves almost nothing in the way of an aftertaste. I think this one's going to become one of my standbys."
"This brew poured a dark transparent brown body with a small head of white bubbles. It had a malty aroma as well as an initially bitter taste that lingered around for a while. Its lacing was good, but overall not one of the better Dunkels. Pass on this one."
"Nice light dark lager with a good malt finish and some pleasant hops aftertaste. Mahogany color with a sweet nose that is full of malt.. this is a very drinkable dunkel smooth malty and low in alcohol content. Mouthfeel is nice as body is medium and mellow."
"You could probably drink quite a bit of this in one sitting if you wanted to, but I would much rather pound a dozen dark ales or stouts before I drank this one with any frequency. Not bad, but not great either...."
"I grabbed this off the shelf because a add by it said ""the Biggest German Exported Beeer in the world"". Was it? Who cares. It had a brownish color to it and a moderate head. The malt was there, the hops weak. Yes, the truth be told, this was aweak German beer with a weird taste to it. Life may be too short for bad beer, but I ain't drinking this again."
"This brew poured a medium white head that was quick dissolving. There was not a lot of lacing left on the sides of my mug with this brew. It had a dark brown body to it. There was some bitterness observed in the taste of this brew. I was not very impressed by the taste and flavor of this brew."
"Overall, a well-made, but overly mild-mannered beer. Lawnmower material."
"I had this on tap at Eli Cannon's Tap Room in Middletown, CT. The keg was tapped 2 days prior. This Dunkel poured a fairly nondescript brown with a modest head that dissipated quickly, and not much lace remained. The smell was sweet and malty but not very complex or interesting. The taste was much of the same. It was very difficult to pick out one strong or dominant flavor, but there were slight hints of fruit and perhaps chocolate. The mouthfeel was not great, fairly light bodied, with moderate carbonation. All in all I would call this a just slightly above average beer that was enjoyable enough, but I probably wouldn't seek it out."
"Poured a dark brown with a thin off white head. The aroma did not jump out at you but there a slight malt and chocolate smell to this. The taste was of malts and chocolate and some coffee. Mouthfeel was crisp and smooth. A good beer to have while relaxing and not much money to spend."
"I found this beer to be very drinkable and a good one to enjoy year round. The flavor will not overwhelm you, but you should find it pleasing."
"Decent dark lager, good if not great. Good session beer, tastes very good with food. Goes on sale regularly, at local sale prices ($8.50 per 12) this beer is a good buy."
"This isn't a great beer, but it's not bad. Sitting around with a buddy the other night with a few of these was just fine. Nice roasty quality to the taste, esp. at the right temp. A little colder, couldn't taste it, a little warmer, and it wasn't that good. Nice looking, dark brown to black with a red hue. Medium head. Thinner mouthfeel. Nice lager qualities."
"drinkablility: high. This is a decent session brew. don't pay too much for it, but not a bad choice for a dark lager beer."
"This is a premium German dark beer. Smell is of chocolate with alcohol. It pours medium dark with a big head. Impressive lacing. The taste is quite pronounced with a very strong roasted malt taste, almost chocolate in character. Impressive. Hoppiness is there, but hard to detect over the malt. Sweet, heavy finish. I liked this. This almost approaches the Porter category, like a watered down Guiness. I will buy this again for a strong, full bodied German dark lager. Forget Beck's or St. Pauly dark. This is a distinct and bold beer. I get this for $9.99 for 12 bottles."
"This beer was dark brown but lacked a good head - of course that could because of the time lag between pour and being served by waitress. The aroma was mild with a no hoppiness in the nose. The flavor balanced malts and hops but the hop bitterness stung the tongue slightly. The mouthfeel was light to moderate. The beer was very drinkable although it was mild in all aspects. I would say this is a middling Dunkel"
"Deep brown to near-black in color, fine off-white head , but leaves very quickly. Soft, sweet aromas, hints of cocoa, raisins, nuts. Slightly harsh initial mouthfeel, light body, minimal texture, a little gritty, a little flinty. Very little character in this beer , not quite the flavor or sweetness one usually finds in the better dunkels. Something's missing, and we'll freely quote from Homer Simpson. ""Hello? Taste?"""
"This dunkel pours a dark ruby brown, and pours with a pretty nice cream colored head that doesn't stick around very long. The aroma is very faint with some malt and darker roasts that come out along with a mild hop character. A very well-balanced taste that combines some dark roasts to produce a nice sweetness in the flavor with a rather light body to it, very drinkable. I enjoy the aftertaste it leaves on the tongue, with nothing to complex a quite enjoyable session beer."
"I had this a while back and the taste still is with me. Has a nice light body to it, which is a good change from all the heavy beers I usually have. Not much head, but it is bubbley, almost like champaigne(sp?). A little expensive, but it's good. I had a bro from the land of the Germs say that it was our equivlent to Budweiser."
"Clearish cocoa-brown, fairly large 1/2 inch head that fizzes down in big pockets. Nutty aroma, mostly of hazelnuts, slight acidity. Malty smooth and somewhat stiffling to the nose and tongue, as many Dunkels are to me. Slightly vinous hop finish with sweetness continuing into the aftertaste. Eh, OK, certainly easy to drink but not one I would seek out any time soon."
"Pours a deep reddish brown, with a loose off-white head. It exhibits good head retention and leaves a nice lace on the glass. Very hoppy, floral aroma with a hint of malt. The classic ""beer"" aroma . The flavor is rather light, with some hop bitterness on the finish with some roasted flavors. A slight metallic edge in the aftertaste gives me a somewhat ""stale"" feeling about the flavor. The mouthfeel is very light, while the large bubbles of carbonation give it a harsh edge in the mouth. Due to the slightly ""off"" flavor and aftertaste coupled with the light mouthfeel, drinkability suffers for me. Nice to try, but I probably will never buy again (actually, this one was given to me by a friend for an opinion). Seems like it is brewed to appeal to the American masses, rather than the German beer drinker."
"The beer on the pour a gleaming deep ruby red with a modest sized head thats light tan in color and fine sheet of lace to seal the glass. Mostly sweet malt aroma in the nose with caramel to back it up, and pleasant enough. Begins sweet and the top skeletal in mouth feel, the finish is curtly acidic, pertinently hopped with the aftertaste dry. Very clean and crisp on the palate, a good beer for when your just plain thirsty."
"Average German dark.  It pours to a clear medium brown with a quick dissipating head.  It has a roasty, nutty smell that is pleasant.  Taste is nutty and sweet with a thin mouthfeel.  Enjoyable for something new.  Drinkable, but honestly something like Shiner/Yeungling is a better dark.  Modest recommendation - it's ok.  I've had better"
"Warsteiner's Dunkel is a very easy drinking beer.  It pours to a chocolate-brown color with an off-white head that dissipates rather quickly.  The aroma is on of light roasted malt.  The flavor is also of roasted malt, with a slight bitterness in the dry finish.  Overall, this beer is smooth and drinkable, with a pleasent roast character."
"I think this would be a fine session beer."
"I'm just happy they did not only have Coors Light, and Miller Light at the Banquet hall."
"Poured brown with an adequate bubbly head.  The aroma was a slightly roasted malt as was the flavor.  As others have mentioned it is a very smooth beer with a good taste.  It is a little watery which deducts from the mouthfeel.  But a very good dunkel that is relatively easy to find."
"warsteiner didn't let me down. i liked this a bit more than the premium verum simply because i like a dark beer. i will say, however, i would take down more verums at a time because they are lighter. this was a good dark. smooth, but not really as rich as it could have been. i will visit the warsteiner dunkel again."
"Freshness information stated best by 2003-03-05."
"This pours a thick two-finger head. Deep rich chestnut brown in color, with red highlights. Nose is clean, lightly roasted malt with not a bit of hop in sight. Tastes sweet with substantial body for a German lager. Nicely roasted dark malt with just a smattering of floral hops makes this finish clean. It's a fresh, well-made slightly above average German lager, a good hot weather brew."
"It has a thick head - initially - that thins out quickly with a somewhat metallic taste and average body. Good color and reasonably priced dunkel. Not the best, which is Ayinger (Kloster Andechs is beyond the rating of a mortal) but not the worst. Mildly tasty bier for meine geld."
"I know this beer to be better, but still ... I enjoyed it."
"On tap at Max & Erma's at the Columbus Airport. Fairly deep, translucent brown with a light tan head that dissipates fairly quickly. Metallic aromas are strongest, followed by faint floral hop; malt aromas are barely perceptible. The taste is a bit more balanced and pleasant, though metallic flavors are still there. Otherwise, a fairly clean, slightly malty sweetness, with a slightly bitter finish. Not great, but considering the other selections on tap at this particular establishment, not all that bad, either."
"Clear, deep garnet / light brown hue.  The thin but persistent head manages to leave a decent lace.  Toffee - like caramel sweetness in aroma w/ a very mild spicy continental hop nose.  Smooth & agreeable mouthfeel.  Lightly bodied and a bit weak in malt complexity.  Lightly roasted malt flavors dominate.  Hop bitterness is mild, but adequately balances the malt sweetness. Finishes w/ more light and clean roasted flavors.  It's a decent dunkel, but I found myself longing for Ayingers dunkel while drinking this one."
"Having this on tap, I could taste that it was fresh.  Nice looking, clear but dark, with a nice creamy head.  Taste was somewhat assertive; a little bitterness hits the back of the throat, but does not detract from the slight malty sweetness.  Not my favorite, but certainly worth trying.  Smooth for such a dark beer, as only the Germans can do."
"Probably the lightest and mildest dunkel I've run across.  Mildly sweet with very light caramel notes and a rather odd grape finish.  Not particularly impressive."
"A nice full flavored German dunkel. Roasted malt predominates. Went well with a char-grilled sirloin burger with a slab of red onion on it and green salad with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and crumbled bleu cheese."
