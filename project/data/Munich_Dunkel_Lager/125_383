4.05,4.9,3.75,3.75,4.25,4.25,4,"This has a very nice look to it. Lacing exists from what was previously a fine cream colored head, but now receded to a rim of foam and aforementioned gentle lacing. Nose is a touch muted, but what I can detect is a touch biscuity and maybe a tad nutty. Taste comes punching through with an immediate bitterness that gives way to that nutty thing that I could smell, hints of something spicy and just a faint berry presence. On the otherwise, crisp finish, we have just a hint of tart mixed into the final ""eff you"" attitude of bitterness. Very complex without being too much of a thinker. Haven't had it? Do yourself a solid and give it a whirl.","gopens44","Mar 29, 2015"

Poured with a rich off-white foam that reduced to a thick cap that left sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. A mellow, pleasant combination of roasted, chocolate and toasted malt. Thick, but delicate malty feel. Roasted and chocolate malt flavors up front and into the middle. Moderate bitter hop flavors are introduced in the middle and intensify toward the end only to taper out at the finish. Finishes with a delicate roasted malt aftertaste.

Aroma was interesting. Had hints of fruity sweet, as well as sweet grainy bread. Kinda like orange flavored oatmeal bread. Flavor carried over the slightly sweet fruity flavorbefore shifting to a malty note, and then finishing with just a tad of bitterness. Was a bit thin and watery.

On the palate, the deeply toasted malts continue bringing along toasted multigrain bread, more smoke (strange?), some vanilla and an oaked feel. Body is medium, moderately sweet with a medium long finish. This is a tasty style, easy drinking, but quite filling for the gravity.

Because of this, I felt that it was a bit more drinkable and could easilly be followed with a second round. The mouthfeel was medium/thick with a medium/low amount of carbonation. I believe this is an excellent dunkel lager for those who enjoyed some body to their beer and I would highly recommend it, especially if you can enjoy it right at the brewery.","jdmorgan","Apr 03, 2006"

Even though it poured a little think, it was surprisingly smooth and creamy going down...I enjoyed the coffee-like aftertaste. The only thing I would have to say about this brew (and others from Penn) is that I never know what to expect when I take the first sip...it seems like their overall consistency is lacking lately - sometimes I'll have 24 perfect bottles in a case, others 12 might be headed down the skunk path.

Smells very nice. Flavor is a bit different. First flavor is a nice sweet smokeyness laying over the toasted raisin bread. Very clean and nice and flavorfull. Feel is on the light end of moderate with a moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty damn nice brew. I really enjoy the flavors and aroma.

4.3,11.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Penn delivers a very well-made and exceptionally drinkable lager in their Dark. It's clear, deep chestnut body glows with ruby highlights at it's center; and its creamy light tan head holds rather well before dropping to a standard collar and leaves short splashes of lace about the glass. Dark, caramelized sugars and Munich malts dominate the nose; toasty and bordering on becoming subtly roasty with a thin cusp of chocolate in the background. Occassional floral hops sometimes make their way through the malt, lending to quite an enticing aroma. It's somewhat creamy and fairly smooth across the palate with a fine-bubbled, moderate carbonation that lends a light zest to the tongue before it warms. Dark Munich malts appear upfront in the flavor, mildly toasty, lightly sweet, and even somewhat raisiny. As it warms more toasted character becomes apparent; and it finishes with a flash of floral and grassy hops as it's drying bitterness rises. It's very well-brewed, clean, nicely balanced, and highly drinkable! An impressive dunkel that probably deserves more attention than it gets.","NeroFiddled","Dec 09, 2004"
3.95,2.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"From the bottle. Pours a amber brown, with a tan head that left little lacing. The initial aroma was fruity, and then nutty, but as it warms I pick up malt and honey. It has a nice malty flavor that finishes dry and bitter, but not overly intense. The body is good but it seems to slip off the sides of the tongue a little. Overall this is a really nice dunkel.","redmosquito","Nov 16, 2004"

Color was nice for a Dunkel, but I thought it was going to be undercarbonated. I was wrong, great color and smell, with taste to match. It has thay nice German fresh aroma- malty, but tempered. A rich and fairly sweet lagar, I found this so enjoyable that I wanted more. This brew has a wonderful balance when you want something with texture and flavor, but not heavy.

4.1,6.2,4,4,4,3,5,"Crystal clear deep ruddy chestnut. Persistent, pitted, thickset leight tan head yields frothy lace. Mellow milk chocolate and dark toffee contrasted by a mildly savory, lightly salted grainy pumpernickel impression in aroma. Trace herbal hop nose. Agreeably understated aromawise. The flavor profile of this brew exhibits fine balance. Malt character is of judicious dark caramel with a singed kiss from chocolate and black malts. Skewed slightly towards sweetness overall, although hop bitterness lends a near dryness mid palate that helps facilitate exceptional drinkability. Toasty Munich hints complement chocolate character aptly. Dryish, but unfortunately marred by a thin mouthfeel. Still, that doesn't detract the entire package too much. Finishes with a snap of black malt acidity yielding to a pleasantly lingering bittersweet cocoa wash. A well crafted dunkel with stately chocolate and toast impressions. Soft on the palate and immaculately clean.","marc77","Jul 06, 2004"
3.56,-7.8,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Served on tap, this beer is a dark brown with a frothy head. The aroma is very restrained, but theres a little malt, graininess, and yeast in the smell (I had to hunt for it, though). The taste is a little nutty and grainy, with caramel. The finish is dry, clean, and a little hoppy, and the body is medium (maybe on the lighter side of medium). Not really complex, but nothing really wrong either.

The taste starts with lots of roasted malt up front, some sweetness. A good hop bite on the finish. Balanced out fairly well. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and smooth. The drinkability is really nice due to the smoothness and the 4% abv. A great dark lager.","SheepNutz","May 15, 2004"
4.06,5.2,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,5,"Pours out as a real handsome pint, with two fingers of rocky, sticky head just leveling off at the top of the glass. Head subsides with some nice-looking clumps and pretty good cling. A few streamers of carbonation shoot through this brew's nice, glowing chestnut translucence that shows maple-colored highlights. Aroma is clean but not particularly distinctive; buttered wheat bread with a sweet caramel maltiness that is slightly hullish; very light nosefeel. Flavor comes in the form of more caramel sweet malt up front; a full barley backbone complemented by butterscotch in the body; the finish posesses the buttery Hallertau hops that seem to be characteristic of this brewery. Nicely carbonated, light mouthfeel can get a bit syrupy, IMO; sticky, refreshing finish. Drinkability is about as high as it gets, a result of the balance of flavor to body to alcohol. If I can find this on tap I'll be drinking it by the pitcher.","NearerMyBeerToMe","Jan 02, 2004"

Clear dark amber appearance, head is light brown and frothy, like steamed milk on a latte. Laces are mostly rings with some interconnecting tendrils. Malty aroma, biscuity with some sense of light honey. Texture is fun, if lighter, some medium-toasted graininess plays in concert with a solid if non-complex caramel flavor.

Appears a very dark nearly opaque with hints of ruby piercing through around the edges when held up to the light. Paired with a tan moccha head, which is binding to the rim of the forming even annular rings of lace as the glass empties. The aroma has some semi-faint fruit tones wrapped in a mild milk chocolate bringing creamy malt to the forefront. Also some of the darker roasted malts are also doing their part allowing a toasted nut scent to dance in the air. The taste leaves me with that creamy milk chocolate sweetness around my lips, along with the trickled chocolate and mild coffee tones comes a crisp smooth lager-like characteristic making this one amazingly smooth. The mouthfeel is full of those creamy sensations down the palate of this fairly heavy bodied beer. Drinkability I would love to find this on tap just to see if it gets any frothier than it already is, and I would like to experiment with mixing this with some Lindemann's Framboise.","WVbeergeek","May 02, 2003"
