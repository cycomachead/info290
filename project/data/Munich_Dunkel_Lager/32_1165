Whether you look at it as a dark ale or look at it as a ""Dunkel", it's a fail either way. I've had both styles, neither of which this beer represents. It's burnt, sour, earthy, and bitter. Just blech. What's even worse is that it's really the definition of mediocre.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Oct 19, 2014"

It satisfies one's desire for a darker beer and certainly can fill the need for roasted flavors.  I felt it was not as malty as I would have preferred.

1.88,-37.5,3,2.5,1.5,2,1.5," Since InBev domesticated it, it's turned into two-dimensional swill. Budweiser with a darker hue and different packaging. I gave the new stuff several chances in recent months, and for a period of time, I was able to compare it head to head with some of the older German-made stock some stores still had in inventory. It's been uniformly disappointing to the point I've given up entirely on it in search of a replacement. I guess they do this because the economics work - shave every production corner you can and drive up margins. It doesn't work for me. I don't drink a lot, so when I do, I want quality, and I'd rather pay a few bucks more if that's what it takes to keep a product authentic and good.","kenofken","Nov 04, 2013"

Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt, caramel, and a skunky aroma that I can only attribute to the green bottle. Taste is tart with dark malt, caramel, and a slight soy sauce flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer with some weird aromas and flavors that don't make it pleasant to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Jan 26, 2013"

Anyway, it pours a dark, clear garnet-russet topped by a short-lived finger of dusty off-tan foam. The nose comprises corn, light musty wheat, and the faintest possible touch of toasted caramel. Something tells me I'm lucky everything's faint, as it might just be offensive if more perceptible. The taste holds notes of mild char, light toasted caramel, hard water, vinyl, grass, and rice. The body is a hefty light, with a moderate carbonation, a watery feel, and a sorta drying finish. Overall, a pretty sad beer, frankly.

The body of this beer grows/builds through the finish, as initial flavors are a bit dry. I pick up lightly roasted notes, with increasing bitterness. Hops continue in the finish even after the pull has concluded. Honestly, since the brew doesn't come to fruition until much later, the body initially feel thin, due to a (possible) overcarbonated, watery contingency. Thus, this leaves a highly mediocre impression. Not terrible, but overall, just middle of the road.","CuriousMonk","Feb 08, 2011"

Sweet grainy malt, with toasted caramel malts, and a grassy hop back. More malty than hoppy by a 60/40 margin. Not bad but simple.

Pours brown with oodles of foam that forms a somewhat rocky head that sadly drops to nothing eventually. Smells a bit like burnt caramel and roasted grain. The aroma is by no means overpowering, but it is also not weak. Tastes of wet malt, touch burnt grains, a hint of toffee with some acceptable hop bitterness for the style.

It starts with a silky texture and heavy wheat flavor. Then it builds to a full-bodied combination of oats, cream, and spice. Beck's Dark slips off the tongue and leaves a very strong and rather unpleasant aftertaste that coats your tongue for at least a half-hour after the beer is gone.

The body is very thin for a Dunkel and the mouthfeel borderlines on being watery.  Malt complexity is lacking in this brew-- light roasted grain flavors manage to emerge, but nothing else supports them flavorwise.  Beck's Dark finishes dry, lightly bittersweet and quite bland.  Beck's Dark is to regular Beck's as Michelob Dark is to regular Michelob.","marc77","Jun 13, 2002"
3,-0.3,2.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,3,"Medium brown with reddish hue. Very little head or lace.  Fresh smelling.  Tastes generic with slight hop sharpness, with a sweet malt finish.  Feels very normal and generic. A typical German Macro","psugrad98","Jun 03, 2002"
2.65,-12,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Okay, this is probably one of the first dark beers I remember having.  While having a darker color, the overall taste just does little to give it much standing as a dark beer.","Wildman","Jun 01, 2002"
2.7,-10.3,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Beck’s Dark:  Nice appearance, and smells much better than the typical euro-lager.  However, the taste just simply is not there.  It has a very weak brown beer.  There are probably thousands of better dark beers out there.","jackndan","May 27, 2002"
2.9,-3.7,2.5,2.5,3,3.5,3,"Rather plain. Hints of chocoa and a bit of almond. Something about the smell turned me off, kinda like stale chocolate (you know when it loses color and such). I have fonder memories of this beer.","packetknife","May 03, 2002"
3.15,4.7,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Yep, it's a dunkel. Nope, not a great one. Beck's dark is just another small beer with a huge distribution area.","inebrius","Apr 26, 2002"
2.96,-1.7,4,3,3,3,2.5,"Notes: Sadly this brew turns into something that may have been good to something that is a tad hard to drink. There are better dark lagers in the world that will beat this one time and time again.","Jason","Apr 19, 2002"
3.13,4,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"nice and smooth with some sweet malty flavors on the tongue.  just hopped enough to add some crispness in the end.  nothing spectacular but solid enough not to complain.","budgood1","Apr 09, 2002"
3.98,32.2,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"My introduction into dark beers, yet not heavy/roasty. Light bodied with moderate hopping make this one great for those not sure about jumping into the dark. A nice way to break into the world of dark beers.","beerluvr","Apr 08, 2002"
3.13,4,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"I was not that impressed for a dark beer. the color is dark brown, with a medium body. The flavor has a mild malt sweetness and subtle hops. Overall not that bad, but nothing great.","WilliamPhilaPa","Mar 24, 2002"
3,-0.3,3,3,3,3,3,"Light to medium bodied with a mild malt sweetness and subtle hops. Not a bad beer when there's limited selection. Nothing special though, not worth seeking out.","John","Jan 03, 2002"
2.7,-10.3,2,2,3,3,3,"Dark, with a flat head, no aromas besides vague maltiness.  Not all that impressed.  I had it on tap, and although it started off flavorful, it quickly faded and became almost tastless.  Dark malt it present and this beer is smooth.  Not compelling at all.","AaronRed","Nov 06, 2001"
2.36,-21.6,3,2,2,3,3,"Not nearly as dark in flavor as in color.  Mildly caramel, without much depth.  Mass-produced character, but drinkable, particularly if fresh.","Brent","Aug 07, 2001"
