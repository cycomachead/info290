I do not want to sound like someone who dismisses macro brews but I feel like that is what is holding this beer back perhaps that's just my bias. Still it is worth a try and is a good option if the selection is otherwise limited.","laramis","Aug 22, 2014"

Flavor follows closely, with deep sweet malt flavors, roast, watery chocolate. The finish here is a bit rough just like other St. Pauli's.

In short it's just a below Average Dunkel and probably not the best example of the class, but it's still easily drinkable.

Small streaks and dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and bread. Taste is much the same with burnt and fruity flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a slightly below average beer that is drinkable but nothing I would want to drink again.","UCLABrewN84","Jan 26, 2013"

This stuff pours a clear garnet-brown topped by a finger of sandy tan foam. The nose comprises barley, very light and watered-down cola, and very-lightly-toasted biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, with a thorough sense of sourdough-ish bread pervading the proceedings. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, a pretty limp beer, with hardly any character to its name. Thankfully, though, this means it has little in the way of true offensiveness as well, but that's a pittance of a consolation.","TMoney2591","Jan 04, 2013"

Color was special and dark - it looked like a museum-quality ruby with NE-quality clarity. My uncle is a geologist who volunteers in a museum and I have held a ruby of this color. C'est magnifique! Nose smelled of coffee, chocolate and grassy hops. I love a mash-up/melange and this seemed poised to satisfy. Mouthfeel was on the thin side, but the flavor began with a Saaz hops bite, then kicked in with a light roastiness and I was sent. Man, this was about the best beer yet today, which my not be saying much, but it was more than I had hoped for going into it. Finish was semi-dry and the roasty/hoppy flavor lingered well after the swallow. Again, being realistic, it may not have been any great shakes, but if you see it next to its white bread, same-old, same-old sister, try some strange for yourself.

Minimal lacing slowly creeps down the glass and I am not able to determine the carbonation since I can not see through my glass. The aroma is malty, sweet, and bitter. I gave it a below average rating only because the aroma is very hard to detect, I'm forced to shove my nose down into my glass in order to pick up any scent. The flavor is definitely based on the original lager, but it appears to be altered with some sweet malts. The combination is very good and I sure do enjoy the overall taste of this one.

This started off at about a half inch and dissipated ti a thin, thin film quickly (maybe 1-2 minutes). Smell was a combination of caramel and mild chocolate with some hops there, but to faint to characterize their smell. taste reveals a bitterness that slides from hops to something else. (Some previous reviewers described their beers as skunked, but I might not go this far with this one.) To me, this particular bottle was more about getting uses to a lager after so may ales. I say this b/c at root it had the sharpness/bite that I associates with the ""big"" European lagers. Underneath this--in an interesting reversal from the smell--comes the caramel/chocolate mix. Not my favorite, but certainly not close to a train-wreck of a beer either. The mouth feel was actually a highpoint for me: good, thick body that was refreshing even despite the flaws in taste.

However, it finishes with a thin tanginess that seems to give it a watered-down character. I believe this beer may actually taste better straight out of the bottle... Mouthfeel is unusually thin for a beer that is this dark. Not horrible by any means, but it seems to be much too thin for the style. Overall, its a fairly drinkable offering, but not something I would consider very good stylistically. I have enjoyed the six pack I purchased and consumed prior to writing this review (not in one sitting mind you!), but for the price, I won't be buying it again anytime soon.","niknar","Sep 15, 2004"

Nose is sweet malt, caramel, crisp and fresh, not a bad sniffer this beer, start is decidedly sweet, fair malt profile and the top skinny in feel. Finish is brisk in its carbonations with the hops light but noticeable, very dry and lingering aftertaste, once again drinkable but light.","Gusler","Jul 30, 2004"

The taste is good. It has smooth and sweet flavor of mostly caramel and a hint of coffee. It feels good in the mouth but leaves a mildly unpleasant aftertaste. It is very drinkable though. I would like to sit and have a good session with this beer at some point. Also, this beer seems like it would make some very good beer bread or biscuits.","tang214","Apr 18, 2004"

Quite thin and left my mouth feeling like it had a bunch of nickels in it in the finish. Not terrible, but not worth it either.","granger10","Jan 25, 2004"

Its deep chestnut/mahogany body supports a creamy off-white head that holds quite well before dropping to a wide collar; and it leaves some minor spotty lacing throughout the glass as well. It's light and crisp in the mouth with a fine, standard carbonation that awakens the tastebuds and refreshes the palate. The flavor reveals a toasted, delicately grainy malt amidst some yeasty sulphur, a touch of floral hoppiness, and a firm bitterness. It finishes crisp, dry, and refreshing with a subtle reminder of it's toastiness left in the mouth. Quite nice!","NeroFiddled","Nov 11, 2003"

3.57,17.4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Dark brown in color, but accompanied by a sad, small head. Aroma is on the dry side, vegetal, small caramel notes, but a bit flinty, a touch on the non-distript side.

Toasty malt aroma reminiscent of German black bread with a slight molasses quality. Taste begins with nutty, toasty malt and carbonation that is a little too sharp, towards the middle of the taste metallic notes appear, finishes dry with more rich malt notes and a lingering bitterness. For my tastes, this is a nice middle of the range dark, although many other reviewers seemed to find less favor with it. Not a bad beer and certainly worth a try.","Pegasus","Jan 18, 2003"

2.54,-16.4,2,3,2.5,3,2,"Clear dark brown leaning toward the reddish side. Stubbornly refuses to generate a head, and it wont lace  almost like it was waxed. Somewhat biscuity aroma. Mildly malty flavors, some sense of distant molasses and dark Karo. Finishes over carbonated and faintly metallic. I didnt detect any skunk but this beer is no where close to the quality its price suggests.","ADR","Jan 08, 2003"

Got this at a wedding recep (it was either this or Corona Light) so I figured what the heck. Dark honey color with a medium thick beige head with little lacing.

Sampling two more of the six revealed skunking on those as well. I still have 2 beers left, so I'm one for four on the six pack so far. There should be a law about putting beer in green glass. These packages sit under the fluorescent lights of Kroger's beer shelves for who knows how long. I probably got lucky that one beer tasted good, so I can only give this one 2.5's. My only advice is avoid the DGB's at all costs unless you know the beer arrived that day, then buy it and keep it in the dark fridge until serving time.","brewdlyhooked13","Oct 29, 2002"

3.77,24,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours with a very nice head that lasts quite a while for a lager.  Once the head fades, theres not much left to remind you of the impressive display from the initial pour, just a very thin ring.  The beer is a nice deep color, reminiscent of a cola; it has some transparency and some deep amber higlights.  The aroma is of roasted malt sweetness.  Very nice, but no hops are evident.  The tase is smooth, with a good bit of roasted malt and a hint of bittersweet chocolate.  There is also a nice hop bitterness on the finish.  A bit more sweetness is evident as the beer warms. The beer sports a fairly good mouthfeel for a lager, with a slight creaminess.   While the flavor is not exceptional, I think I could drink these all night long with no complaints.","aaronh","Oct 07, 2002"
3.19,4.9,3.5,2,3.5,3,4,"The color is not too bad, a deep mahogany.  Not so dark that you cant see through the glass.  Very little hop attitude, which actually makes it quite thin in texture.  No real head to speak of, only a faint line around the top.  The flavor, however, makes up for some of the texture, with a fairly rich taste.  The down side of that is a slightly acidic after-taste.  Maybe its just me but the aroma is what kills me about this beer, a faint impression of ivory soap…and no its not just my glass, it’s the same in the bottle.  However with all of that said, still a good beer with personality.","faubs","Sep 30, 2002"

Uh oh-- it's slightly skunked. The initially earthy and spicy Hersbrucker hop nose is followed by sulfury mercaptans. If it weren't for the green bottle and my bad luck, this would've smelled quite nice.  Clean all around in flavor, but nothing stands out and make this beer particularly memorable.  The body is a bit thin.  Sweet caramel and slightly toasty Munich malt flavors are there, but aren't particularly assertive.  Finishes sweet and inoffensive.","marc77","Apr 28, 2002"
