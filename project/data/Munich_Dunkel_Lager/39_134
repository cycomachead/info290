4.5,13.6,4.25,4.25,4.75,4.25,4.5,"500 ml bottle from Cost Plus. Dark, dark brown. Shows signs of clarity with a big, off-white head. Good lacing. Nose of toasty, fruity malt and yeast. Flavors of bread crust and light caramel with hints of dark fruit, plum and touch of raisin. Hops are hardly noticeable, maybe a touch of grassy spiciness. Residual sweetness produces a fairly heavy body feel. Finishes semi-sweet. A very tasty, yet easy drinking lager beer.","loubar","Feb 05, 2015"

More bready than nutty with very little raisin taste.  I'm not a big fan of the raisin taste, so this is  welcome spectrum for a Dunkel.

The noe comprises mild nuts, wheat bread, light fruits (in the vaguest possible sense), and ahint of hard water. The taste brings in more of the same, the nuts and bread combining into a toffee/brittle situation and the fruit coming out a bit stronger. I think I get some dark greens in there, as well.

Very interesting aroma for a thin-bodied lager. Palate is chalky chocolate, more prune/raisin fruit, brown bread (pumpernickel), a hint of cola spice, a sour top note that almost evokes fresh citrus but probably more like rancid marmalade, nice deep dark flavors. Some brown sugar and coffee show up and cling to the palate along with a bit of cardboard. The faintest whiff of apricot. Minimal hop bitterness. I like this style and this is a good exemplar. Ayinger is workmanlike, never bad and always cleaving close to style guidelines. Carbonation is right where it needs to be. A nuttiness like bitter walnuts accumulates and builds a bit ... Some metallic notes that maybe detract a bit but one can always return to the fermented prune aroma and be intrigued.","CalgaryFMC","Aug 26, 2013"

There's a light bready malt aroma, but that is quickly drowned out by the other smells. The flavor follows the aroma quite well Dark sugars, caramel, crystallized sugar, prunes and raisins all meld together wonderfully. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet burnt sugary mouthfeel. This is a very nice, clean flavorful German Lager.","johnnnniee","Dec 08, 2012"

A tad overcarbonated, a little citrus zing at the finish and even though it has dunkel lager attributes, somehow this Ayinger misses my mark. I do love a good dark lager, and I look forward to enjoying more, but I'll leave this one alone, there are better options.","JimTeal","Dec 03, 2012"

Light spotty lacing on the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up retaining the head. Aromas of big brown bread, caramel, toast, molasses, chocolate, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, and light herbal hops. Damn nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of big brown bread, caramel, toast, biscuit, molasses, chocolate, roast, toffee, nuttiness, and earthy herbal spiciness. Light earthy spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of toast, biscuit, caramel, molasses, nuttiness, chocolate, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a short bit. Fantastic amount of pretty robust flavors; with great balance and complexity. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding Dunkel Lager. I have never had this style before, but this is nicely robust and complex; and extremely easy to drink. Very clean for a lager as well.

3.3,-16.7,4,4,3,3,3,"This beer pours a ruby-brown color. The head is one inch of light tan foam that recedes slowly into a firm cap of lacing. The aroma is caramel, toffee, and a nice mineral quality. Very pleasing. The taste is similar to the aroma, but lighter. It is still nice, but a bit too light for the style. The mouthfeel is on the lighterside of medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a watery texture. Overall, this is a nice beer, but there are much better dunkels out there that are far richer in depth of character than this one. I would most likely pass on drinking this beer again.","KarlHungus","Apr 04, 2011"

4.08,3,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours a deep amber with good clarity, good finger of khaki head with high retention and plenty of lacing. Aroma is quite worty or malt syrupy, fairly intense and appealing, perhaps a some treacle in there, a bit husky. Taste has lots of worty malt, some toast, not quite roasty, but robustly malty with a great malt finish that doesn't taste overly sweet or cookielike like I've had in a hundred beers. The body is light to moderate, seems to match its lagerness, luckily carbonation avoids being overdone, so pretty nice. I really like the use of munich malts here, it gives it a rich, worty flavor without being sweet.

The aroma is toasty, bready malt. It smells like molasses on toast. The flavor adds in a spicy note, but the malt is really the star. Hopping is light but appropriate for the style, just enough to cut the malt sweetness. The malt flavor is big and thick for a lager.

Taste reminded me a bit of winter spices like cinnamon and coriander. There was a good backbone of malt to this beer that gave it a nice body. It's smoothness and low abv made it very easy to drink.

Everything about the nose is subdued half-measures, coffee and heavy cream, lightly toasted malts, raisin fruit, fruitcake, carob, given the lack of hoppy scents, doesn't require that kind of counter-weight to stay in balance. Light-bodied, here the carbonation does tend to diffuse the flavors prematurely. Same mixture of dark fruits, coffee cream, butterscotch, at times there is a sourness which adds spark. Needs a bookmark, loses its place by the mid-palate. Smooth with nary a rough edge in sight, err, taste, but there's this nagging sense that something is missing.

Color is dark copper, with two fingers of white head. Dark bread and banana come to mind first when smelling, followed by some clove and bit of powdered chocolate. Taste is big on the dark bread factor, which gives it a sweet start, but then it becomes a bit sharper tasting, with dry grains and a hop bite. Those last impressions taste wise really distinguish it from the dark German Weiss beers I am used to. Mouthfeel is light and beautifully carbonated. This quenches my thirst as well as any light ale or lager. Drinking this one is about as easy as it gets.

The aroma had evidence of sweet, cyrstal barley with a slight, roasted quality. There was subtle evidence of bavarian yeast ester with a slight banana undertone. There was no hop aroma present. The flavor initially has a toasted grain quality with a dry breadiness. Hop bitterness is ever so slight along with a slight banana flavor. The beer ends up finishing on the sweet side due to clean lagering and good mouthfeel and carbonation. All things considered, I found this to be a really good beer. What I enjoyed the most about it was its finish. It left you with a slight, sweet linger that just invites the consumer to drink more.

As the crispness fades, these other flavors come out more. Finishes a bit drying alongside tones of grape juice, medium roast coffee, and floral hops.

In the nose is tons of fresh caramel, earthy rich crystal malt tones, and some nice sweet rye bread as well. Flavor wise, the caramel notes come in first, almost to the point of a bitter burnt caramel, some spicieness, with a very light body. It is a nice change from summer beers, as it is incredibly light but gives you the dark punch that a brown or porter would. Finish is extremely thin as the carbonation is quite low giving it a slight wateriness. It isn't a bad attribute given it is supposed to be a light bodied lager.

The flavor is also intensely malty, with notes of toasted bread, hazelnut, figs, prunes, dates, along with some spicy and floral hops. The mouthfeel is light with moderate carbonation and drinkability is excellent. This is a great beer, seems to be almost the ultimate expression of the style.","silver0rlead","Apr 30, 2006"

Small islands of lace cling above the glowing mahogany colored beer. Mild aroma of chestnuts, bread, and dash of cocoa. Light bodied beer with light carbonation is almost watery. Biscuit malt and cocoa up front give way to floral tea-flavored hops in the end. Not bad, but something seems to be missing. Reading the description of Munich Dunkel Lagers this one seems to be missing some the richness and creamy mouthfeel.

It pours a clear cola colored brown with an impressive 2 to 3 head that lasts for about ½ the Weizen Glass. The lacing is noticeable for the first ½ glass as well. It has a very smooth malty flavor similar to an Alt, Boch, and appropriate for a Dunkle Larger. A sweet and caramel experience that makes me instantly think of Bavaria. The mouthfeel is larger light with a very, very slight fizz. The aftertaste is pleasant and sweet. This would be a good substitute for dessert.

The overwhelmingness is much like cranberries in the first gush, then it mellows out but the bitterness still lingers. For mouthfeel and drinkablility I didn't think it was that special... there is a strange chalky sensation that overtakes the back of your mouth so to remedy it you take another sip, but then find yourself right back in the same predicament.

There is a slight dryness to the aftertaste with a nice ballance of hops. There is also a good nutty malt taste too. This is the second Ayinger I've tried after Celebrator Doppelbock.

Not a lot of hops in the aroma, but there is a distinctive yeasty quality. I love the smell. The brew itself is fairly sweet, but relatively light in body.

The body is excellent as it is more on the viscous side while also having an agressive carbonation that allows the flavors to cut through the body. Pretty good as a starter beer or as part of a series of beers in a tasting but i find that one of these at a time is plenty.","RenoZymurgist","Oct 02, 2004"

Despite the yeastiness, this beer is still light enough that it doesn't inflate your belly, so your friends won't have to roll you out of the biergarten.

There is about 3 fingers of tan head that fall to about a quarter inch cover of the beer. This is the thickest nose I have found on a beer in a long time. I can almost feel the thickness of the thickness of the brew through the smell. I'm impressed. It smells syrupy sweet (not maple) and of roasted sweet malts. I think it smells divine. The taste is not as strong as I expected from the smell. It starts out as a strong caramel sweet flavor, but ends up tasting like a sweet and grainey on the finish. Mmmm. I read others describe the bready flavors and I can see where that comes from, but I don't think I would have picked that flavor without having read it in other reviews. It is not as thick as I had hoped from the nose...still good.

3.88,-2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Notes: ""Old Bavarian Dark Beer"" is what Altbairisch Dunkel translates into. This beer is just chock-full of malt, the model dark lager for brewers to mold from. Absolutely Superb!","Jason","Jun 11, 2002"
4.33,9.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Clear mahogany color with light tan head. Slightly bitter but nicely malty as well. Extremely well balanced. After drinking the heineken dark in the same session, I was worried that I was not going to like the style, but the Altbairisch proved to be a wonderful beer. Dark fruit and sweetness came across in nose and flavor. Finished s little bitter. Very nice.","jreitman","Apr 21, 2002"
4.58,15.7,5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Very appealing crystal clear red hue, with a thick, creamy, persistent head.  It's beautiful.  The aroma is of rich, malty, toasty decocted Munich malt melanoidins.  Medium bodied.  Toasty malt flavors are noticeable initially, and are surprisingly well balanced by a slightly floral Hallertauer hop flavor and bitterness.  It finishes with just a touch of toasted flavor on the back of the tongue along with a bit of residual sweetness.  Wow-- what a balance.  Hop bitterness and flavor , malt, slightly roasted grain flavor coalesce perfectly.  It's been a while since I've had this beer and I'm pleasantly surprised.  I drank this one at cellar temps (approx. 55 deg.) to allow the malt favors to come through.  For a 5% ABV ""session"" beer, this is a highly enjoyable and complex one..  Give it a shot.","marc77","Mar 15, 2002"
4.25,7.3,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"This handsome leather-brown beer is sweetly aromatic with whiffs of caramel. The malts are whelming and hops indistinct, yet the beer has an underlying bitterness that betrays its malt profile. It's quite an impressive balancing act. The water feels very smooth and pillowy in the mouth, as with all of Aying's brews, and has their trademark compulsive drinkability (you'll find it disappearing from your glass faster than you it want to - always a good sign). Not my absolute favorite effort of theirs, but well worth drinking if you are interested in the style. Should pair wonderfully with the appropriate food (sausages, and tangier darker meats, perhaps?).","Thrasher","Mar 05, 2002"
4.34,9.6,4,5,4,5,4,"Gorgeous cloudy brown with a creamy tan head.  A potent whif of cocoa, malts, and gaseous alchohals.  Roasted nuts, malts, chocolate.  Well rounded, smooth texture.  Unfortunately I tasted a hint of metal.  -1 on taste for that.  Still a great beer.  Not entirely too expensive compared to say Samuel Smith, and almost the same quality.","Jordan","Dec 13, 2001"
