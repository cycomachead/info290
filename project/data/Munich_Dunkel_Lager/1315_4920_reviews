"Aroma is toasted malts, dark bread, cola caramel, molasses, dark fruit, nuts & a hint of dark chocolate. Taste is dark malts, molasses, coco, roasted nuts, dark fruit, a hint of orange slice candy & smoke with spicy grass & lemon hops in the finish. Aftertaste is cola caramel, toasted pumpernickel & spice. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with moderate carbonation, but smooth, low to medium carbonation, moderate prickle from mid-sip into finish, wet fronted, dry & lightly astringent aftertaste. A excellent example of the style."

"The most well-balanced beer I've ever had. Easy to drink, yet sweet, nutty, and hoppy. You can't beat a well-balanced beer!"
"A solid very drinkable Munich Dunkel for sure."
"This one was another very nice beer from the brewery, I'm not entirely sure but my thinking is that last years came out slightly better but this one is still an excellent beer and one well worth picking up. The taste was a sweet and nutty one but certainly wasn't overdone and managed to strike a great balance as I sipped away at it for quite some time; good stuff."
"Overall An excellent brew.  highly recommended"

"Pours a deep mahogany brown in color with ruby-red highlights. A good 1 to 2-finger foamy beige head is seen that settles down to about 2-3mm after a good bit. Lots of stick lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of sugary roasted malts with a hint of cocoa and caramel. Pretty much the same for the taste with some molasses as well as some dark fruit in the mix. Very tasty and smooth brew. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation which isn't too much for this great German brew (World's Oldest Monastery from 1050 AD). Overall, really like this one."

"Straightforward Dunkel, but also flavorful and easy to drink. This beer was first produced over 150 years ago, I wonder how this licensed version brewed in Brazil compare to the German one. By the descriptions it seems to fairly match."

"0,5 l bottle (bb 11.12.2014) into a pint glass. Clear ruby brown body, some bubbling, medium foam head with good retention and heavy lacing.  Smell - sweet malt, with plum and raisins. Taste - begins with semi sweet malt and the same dark fruits as in the smell, followed by a taste of toasted malt that builds up in the mouth, ending dry with a slight hop bitterness. Soft malty taste with a hint of metal. Semi-light body, medium-low carbonation. Overall a good flavorful dunkel, went down well with over-cooked pork."

"Overall - A smooth, complex, delicious lager that could only come from Germany. Here in Southern California, this is not an easy beer to find (Jagerhaus, in Anaheim, sells it in the bottle or on tap). Go find some. It's worth the effort."

"O: This is a beer with some good qualities that doesn't quite make it. Not the worst dunkel I've had, but not the best either."
"Decent Dunkel Lager. Coffee and caramel flavor. Easy to drink, not too much carbonation."

"O- it is an extremely solid lager. Highly recommended."

"I think this is a much better than average Dunkel, with more flavor while retaining that soft, mellow sensation. This would be the one to fill your big stein with. From the 500 ml bottle purchased at Bottleworks in Seattle."
"Nice dunkel, really drinkable and rich in taste. I can see why it's got quite some awards."
"500ml bottle. Mug. Bright amber color, clear appearance. Yellowish, creamy foam creates a rocky crown. A thin & lasting layer remains on top. Floral, crystal malt aromas & chocolate hues. Crispy upfront with slight sweetness & moderate toasted flavors. Light body. Moderate carbonation. Dense texture & spicy touch. Gentle chocolate, dry nut & bitter cocoa flavors in the middle linger into a dry bitter/sweet finish. Well balanced & easy drinkable beer."
""
""
"O: I suppose fairly flavorful and a touch more complex (rough, ragged) than usual for a dunkel"
"This pours a clear, dark amber color with a slight, foamy head. The aroma is inviting with toasted malts and hazelnut tones. This is highly drinkable with a smooth texture and a decent sweet grain taste that is perfect for the style. Very well made and delicious."

"O - the bottle claims its ""das Beste Dunkel der Welt""...certainly an overstatement, but not an utterly gross exaggeration. This is a very good dunkel, well worth the drink, and although there are better Dunkels in Germany, it is a nice and balanced beer with pretty even overtones for the most part."

"good not great. not as October as I wanted it to be, but still a tasty brew, quintessentially german in every way. the pours is clear for the genre, lacey on the sides of the glass, with a deep ruby color and a nose of german amber malts and lager yeast. it smells also like warm fermentation for a lager, a little acidic and funny for some reason, but not unattractive. notes of lager yeast and semisweet amber come though, toffee in the finish, with not quite enough hops to balance. yeasty and bold flavored, I wish it wasn't quite so sugary on the back end, but a drinkably dark german beer with a lot of character. decently carbonated, a little bland in the mouth, but a good beer overall, especially for the price."

"The label is marked with 'World Beer Cup - Gold award'. Well I've no idea what that is, but if it is as the name infers, I'm not hugely surprised."
""
"overall, another great german brew although they are starting to run together in a similar groove. not the commercial hofbrau malts, but a shade of variance. a great standard."
"O: Delicous piece of history that should be tried. Would go well with dark rye or pumpernickel breads with whipped butter, or with light cheeses. Saw it overpriced in China, got this one slightly cheaper in the US. Great German beer"
""
""
"Probably the best Munich Dark Lager I've ever had. A touch of metallic character is off-putting but otherwise it is a solid brew."
""
""
""
"Easy-drinking beer that would probably rise and fall repeatedly without becoming tiresome deep into a social evening filled with talk and laughter."
"Overall I had a feeling the Germans can make a kick ass Dunkel and it was well worth the price of admission. Seek out if you can."
""
""
""
"The beer poured an amazing translucent dark brown with a tan head. The aroma is of hints of coffee over a sweet malt base. The taste is a rich sweet malt with touches of coffee and chocolate on top of that. The feel is medium and wet. This was a great example of a Dunkel, rich a full bodied taste with some great flavors in it. This is a Dunkel I will come back to."
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-light bodied, with medium-high levels of carbonation that foams the beer up substantially on contact with the palate. Resulting mouthfeel is at first fizzy, then smooth and creamy. Finishes wet, with little residual stickiness around palate or lips."
"O: A flawless albeit straightforward Bavarian dunkel. Make the pilgrimage."
"O: Good drinkability. Bit too sweet but nice beer"
""
""
"A fair enough dark lager. Smooth and lightly flavored dark beer that's easy drinking. Nice balance with the roasted flavors and the hop bitterness."
""
"O: Pretty good for a rauchbier."
""
"2nd tasting brought dark toast and treacly syrup notes, verging on cloying. Needs more bitterness to balance. Good but not great."

"bready malts, some sweetness of toffee/caramel, but the mouthfeel is a bit watery for me. not all that complex, but enjoyable"
"Overall: superbly easy to drink dunkel. If you are looking for a nice malty dunkel, this one hits the spot."
"Drinkability: This is very good brew. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing, and it also offers a ton of complexity."
"Really drinkable, but a bit too sweet."
"Great Dunkel, great flavors for 4.7% and extremely drinkable."
"O - A good lightish, easy to drink dunkel."
"Pours dark chocolate brown with a tan fine tan head that lasts quite a while leaving some good lacing. Aroma is predominantly chocolate malts, roast malts and a hint of coffee. Flavour is very good with the aromas coming in to the flavour mix along with some toffee sweetness and some slight graininess of the roasted malts coming through. What impresses me most is that the body is rich and full for a 4.% ABV beer, normally there would be a hole in the palate range but this is spot on, no wateriness or thinness at all. Finally the finish is quite long a pleasant, mainly coffee with a touch of prune in there."
"O: A very nice Dunkel that was very easy to drink."
"Overall: Pretty good, bears some resemblance to a porter, but not quite. It also gets better as it warms."
"Overall: An interesting, if not particularly complex, well polished and rounded lager. Charming to say the least!"
"This brew pours out as a healthly looking brown color with a tan colored head on it. The aroma on this beer is pleasent, it had a real nice roasted malt smell and some lager yeast in there too. The taste of the beer is probably one of the better Dark Lagers out there. The mouthfeel is thicker then I expected, I really liked how it almost felt creamy. Overall this beer had a great feel to it and it was nicely flavored. Really worth trying, hell I want to try it again sometime."
"D/O: Low abv of 4.7% but somehow feels like it drank bigger in alcohol and flavor. For those that think low abv beers donâ€™t pack a punch or flavor should be referred to this beer. Smooth drinkability with a light dry sweetness from the malt and an overall flavor character suited well per style."
"drinkability: I love the dark lagers of germany and czech rep. this is a great examaple."
"O - Probably the best dunkel I have tried to date"
"O -- Probably the best imported Dunkel I've had, though transport - and probably Pasteurization - take their toll on German imports, and this one is no exception when you compare to the fresh beers in Bavaria. Nonetheless, this one is worth seeking out locally if you are a Dunkel fan."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Munich dunkel lager."
"Beer is medium and creamy in the mouth. Lead off is sweet and the finish is a little dry and bitter. Interesting. Its like a doppelbock but thinner and weaker overall. I like it overall, not sure I would order it again."
"Conclusion: This is the first higher quality example of this style that I have tasted, and I find it enjoyable. I can imagine this pairing well with some lightly spiced schnitzel or stuffed cabbage."
"Overall: What an excellent beer. An outstanding example of an excellent style that I drink far too infrequently."
"D - This was pretty good. I had never had anything from Weltenburger and I picked this up on a whim. Pretty nice."
"Don't be fooled by its BA overall score: this is an awesome beer, especially when you get a relatively fresh bottle as I have. I didn't expect to rate this so highly, but apparently Weltenburger Barock Dunkel is just what Herr Doktor ordered."
"Overall this beer is excellent. One of the best in it's style!"
"Picked this up at Hi-Times in Costa Mesa, always a solid selection. Poured a deep brown , somewhat chunky head. Big malts on the nose, ton of sweet caramel as well. Taste was very smooth, complex as it warms, but very drinkable with a strong malt finish, good stuff."
"drinkability - straightforward beer that isn't all that interesting, but drinks smoothly, I enjoyed this one"
"Great, great dunkel overall. Really surprising. A beer even worthy of ""Barock"" Obama (although I hear the prez prefers Bud Light, that sellout)."
"Dark brown, dense beige head excellent retention and lace. An almost perfect looking beer. The nose is delicate and complex, with chocolate, bread, light fruit, wheat and no real hop character. Beautiful chocolate bread character. Some caramel is also present. The palate opens light with wheat, a little toast, chocolate a light nutiness. As with the nose, the caramel character is light but present. Dry and clean finish, with a light body and crisp carbonation, this is excellent."
"Fresh keg on tap at Gourmet Haus Staudt. This one has a great color, somewhere between amber and brown, reminding me of chestnut shells. Two inches of beige head tops the body, slowly settling to a collar. The aroma is malty, toasty, lightly caramelized and fruity; it's bold but clean. It's similar on the palate: the malt profile reminds me of toasted whole grain bread, behind it there are notes of dark fruit, coffee and caramelized malt. Light-bodied with a dry and toasty finish, I could drink this all day. Might be the best dunkel I've had."
"Drinkability: quite drinkable. This has the good quality of being a light yet flavorful session beer."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a mahogany color and the beer poured a big thick pillow head that was brown. The beer had a bready/yeasty smell. The taste was malty, caramel a little sweet but not too much. The beer was a little watery, but still a good beer. I will buy again."
"500ml from Capital market, Salem. Nice dark brown beer with a gorgeous frothy,tan head. very bready malt aromas,..bread and oat cereal. Like it. Smooth milk chocolate and coffee with boiled milk flavours.Slight hints of bitterness in the end. Very smooth ..silky smooth palate. Overall i really liked this soft, malt driven beer."
"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty good beer. I would like to try a fresh one before I seriously cast judgment, but either way I am going to finish my beer whether it has a bit of oxidation or not and that is a pretty bold statement as I have some seriously choice beers lined up after this one. I wouldn't ""dis"" this one if you see it, but I would check out the ""born on"" date."
"At just 4.7% alcohol it is easy to drink, but I didn't find myself wanting another one. This is one of those cases where it looks and smells better than it tastes."
"D: Very easy to drink. Goes down suprisingly quickly. Good choice for an afternoon with friends or serving at an event. A conservative, relatively risk-free dunkel lager."
"Overall, this is better than expected. I don't know if the age helped or hurt this beer but it's still pretty solid even after almost 8 years."
"Good brew! Served with a full foamy, frothy light tan head and a little lace. Head settled down to a thin cover shortly. Color is a lovely, clear, deep, dark amber. Aroma is malty and a bit roasty with a hint of burnt sugar. Flavor is quite nice with the above nose qualities plus a bit of hop. Good carbonation tho the liquid seems just a tad thin. Very nice finish. Definitely a session beer."
"An awesome example of a flavorful dunkel. On par with the best examples of the style for sure."
"Overall, an enjoyable Dunkel. It says on the label and the cap that the beer has two gold medals in two World Beer Cups. Not sure if this beer is worth the gold, but ir certainly is not bad."
"A - 4.0, S - 4.0, T - 4.5, M - 4.0, D - 4.5."
"A great, drinkable beer which is easy to drink, tasty and well crafted. A nice, sessionable ABV also helps this beer along."
"Another very drinkable brew from Kloster Weltenburg"
"This is a pretty good Dunkel Lager, great if you are looking for a malty beer on a hot day."
"The foam was wheat/buckwheat in color, thick and smooth. The color was a nice amber/cola with hints of toasted wheat and a hops highlight. The smell was deep, robust with hints of wheat and hops highlight. Taste - a great balance of wheat and hops with a small molassis undertone, a little nutty and flowery. Mouthfeel - smooth, crisp, medium-bodied. Drinkability - smooth with a subtle tartness, a good session."
"A very drinkable beer. It had several good qualities that made it enjoyable. If it were less expensive I could drink this as a session beer."
"Cool bottle though."
"A nice soft and mild beer."
"Here is a toast the the President, may his presidency be better than this beer. The aroma is malty and papery with some chocolate, toast, corn, and hops. The appearance is dark red with a small head. The flavor is like the aroma with a better that expected taste. The palate is thin. Overall a decent drinking beer but not a great all around beer."
"Mouthfeel is thin and flat."
"D - One word...yum! 4.7% ABV ensures you can make it a decent session brew for moderation drinking. The oldest Monastery-Brewery in the world seems to know what they are doing by the taste of this Munich Dunkel Lager. I look forward to more of this in my future."
"Medium-bodied. Very smooth and drinkable. A classic dunkel lager. Not overly complex, but well-balanced with enough subtle complexities to enjoy it. Very smooth."
"Weltenbuger Kloster claim to be the oldest monastery brewery in the world, having been established in 1050 (or ten to eleven as it's sometimes called), though I very much doubt that the Barock Dunkel bears any major resemblance to whatever the monks were churning out then. This poured a very alluring ruby colour, with a big fluffy tan head and lots and lots of carbonation - which I wondered if it had anything to do with the glass, as there were streams of bubbles coming up from the pattern on the glass bottom. At first the nose worried me as it bore a resemblance to the detergenty smell but eventually it gave way to a predominantly ginger spiciness. Tastewise this was really nothing special, lightly malty but with a thin body it was quite disappointing to be frank - perhaps I like big beers too much these days?"
"Almost 1,000 years of brewing has created near perfection in the form of Weltenburger Barock-Dunkel. Has a dark brown color, but certainly not black with a large head and good lace throughout. This beer is considered by most to be rather plain in taste, but the traces of chocolate provide a solid, uncomplicated taste. It has a great full body and I miss being able to pick up 20 bottles of this at a time. I recommend this beer to anyone and everyone who is interested in dark German beer. Visiting the brewery itself is an amazing experience."
"D- Very rich beer without being overbearing; I will drink this again."
"3.5 M&3 D: pretty refreshing on the palate with light carbonation to soothe the palate; this light-bodied Dunkel smells richer than the palate, but the flavour still retains freshness to make it easy-drinking. Alas, the flaovur profile falls a bit dull after several sip, hence just an average mark for drinkability."
"Good sessionable beer. Probably a good alternative for a brown ale if one is looking for something different. Recommended."
"D - this is a very good beer. Not being very familiar with the style I am very glad I picked this up and will wait until it cools a bit outside to pick up some more..."
"M + D: Effervescent and light, a smooth body and a very easy drinker. With the mellow ABV, it's an easy session candidate and would perform well as such. The style seems to fly below the radar a bit, and perhaps undeservedly so... it's a fine style of lager, and well worth trying out."
"(Reviewed from notes while in Germany 5-2-08) This beer was a dark brown color, 1/2 in tan head that was more like a thick cap. There was a light roast smell, but more noticeable was the hops. The taste was of nice dark chocolate, hints of roasted coffee and a slight sweetness in the finish. This is an ""after dinner"" beer. Extremely smooth and well put together!"
"The beer's body is ruby brown with hues of orange. Head is good and frothy on top. I'll bring the glass to my nose and get a whiff of...dark malts and sweet bread. Taste is similar to the aroma, so I can save myself some typing. Okay, i'll add this: similar flavor characteristics to its doppelbock, and that's a good thing. Body is medium and pepped with a spring of carbonation (maybe a little too much on that). Save for very hot weather, I could see myself enjoying this during any time of year. I would also recommend this beer to those who want to train their palates to withstand doppelbocks."
"Basically, it is a near perfect beer. It is complex without sacrificing drinkability, rich and full without being too thick. Basically, this is why I drink beer. So good."
"Flavors were mainly caramel and almond, some toasted character developed in the aftertaste. A metallic note came and went, not present throughout. Fairly light bodied, good malt presence, nothing too out of the ordinary. Not bad for a session."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Pours an extremely dark ruby with a tan head that rises and does not stick around long but leaves a thick lacing on the way down. Nose is almost like old wood. Like a cleaned out old attic. Dusty and void of life. A mild bit of malt character there, but not a whole lot. Flavor is smooth and even. Nothing real crazy going on here. Thin malt influence. Has the body, but not a lot of character to follow. Feel is standard. A bit thin really. Drinkable, sure. It is a decent brew. Nice to try. But no home run to run back to."
"Overall: I did not appreciate this one. Too watery and characterless to deserve a higher grade."
"All in all, an odd beer. The smell is definitely off-key, and the taste is an improvement on the smell, but not by much. I was excited to try this beer, and it was a bit of a disappointment."
"Taste is strong malty like a lot of munich malt has been used. A little molasses and roasted notes. To me this beers body was a little too low, but I read on the label that this beer only has 4,7% alcohol, and this beer has more taste than the average beer. I especially like the combination of the roast and malt. Bitterness is low and drinkability is great."
"D: A good dunkel, not as good as the Ayinger, but few are. A good example of a German dunkel, easy to drink, I'd buy again and enjoy."
"d: not quite my cup of brew, but pretty straight-forward"
"A nice drinkable Dunkel bordering on Bock. Alcohol is such that 2 or 3 in a session is not unreasonable."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer."
"I reviewed this once before but after a massive explosion of flavour immediately before by some killer beers and I decided to revisit this beer with a neutral palate. This time I really noticed the deep coca cola colour and the creamy and persistent head. It's a beautiful beer to look at and the malty aroma wafting from the top continued to the end. The flavour is a complex malange of dark chocolate, coffee-mocha with some molasses and just a hint of bitterness at the end to prevent cloying. You could have this with a chocolate mousse or creme brulee or just by itself for a nice dessert. Its not quite a full bodied beer despite appearances and can seem watery after a fuller beer but it stands up as a well balanced and very complex dessert beer. I think you could only have one or two before becoming palate fatigued so it's not exactly a BBQ quaffer. It is a fabulous drop all the same."
"Drinkability: Decent drinkability, but slight bitter finish slows you down some."
"The drinkability is good a very easy drinker. Prosit MK"
"my guess is this would kick ass fresh."
"Pours to a dark brown with just a hint of ruby red, medium of-white head dissipates very quickly, and leaves little lacing. Aroma is a pleasnt mixture of roasted nuts and dark fruit with malty sweet undertones. Taste is along the same lines, nutty and sweet with a hint of fruit. Body is a little on the thin side, which accounts for a weak mouthfeel and short finish that is a little on the watery side, but still enjoyable."
"prost!"
"Poured a nice dense cream colored head. Dark amber colored beer is almost chestnut brown, surprisingly clear, and loaded with streams of bubbles. Aroma is all malt, fairly sweet, and reminiscent of a doppelbock. Moderately sweet malt with just a bit of cocoa. Mouthfeel is soft with just a bit of fizz from the carbonation. Sweetness fades in the finish and leaves with a bready cocoa flavor. There is something about the mix between the aroma and the taste that follows that makes this beer above average."
"at less than 5%, this would be a great session beer. it has all the characteristics i love about doppelbocks, but a much lower abv. tastes good, as you would expect after admiring the nice appearance and smell. it's not spectacular, but it really does the job. weltenburger's barock dunkel lager is a solid beer. very near the fine line between worth a try and recommended."
"16.9 ounce bottle. Dating on back label 18.01.02 K."
"Tasted a little skunky. This beer had chunks of yeast that settled at the bottom, but not too much to detract from the beer. I paid 2.59 at hollingshead, and yes, i'm still working on my german wheat beer purchase. Its been two months for one case. Some spicy undertones, a nice head that gave way about midway through the beer. I poured it in my new hefeweizen glass. cheers"
"This was a pleasant change of pace, as Dunkels are not a normal drinking repertoire for my tastebuds. I'll definitely go back to it when craving a darker beer."
"Poured an almost see-thru brown hue. The color did not catch my attention and left a lot to be desired. But the smell was of a flowery malt with a delicate hint of ice cream. The Head pours a great 2.5 finger head that dissipate over 2 minutes and leaves a a constant foam film on the beer. The mouthfeel was of malty vanilla witha refreshing carbonated palate that tickles the tongue. The taste maintaind the malt-vanilla flavor the a blck cherry after taste that was just extraordinary. I was pleasnatly surprised with the quality of this beer that was in the clearance beer section at Sam's Wine & Liqours on Butterfield."
"500 ml bottle, bought in Bier Spezi Hamburg. Clear brown to copper coloured, large light tan head. Pleasant aroma of lightly roasted malts, caramel, chocolate and bakery (including rye bread and Danish pastry). Lightly roasted malty flavour, fairly mellow, bready notes, some caramel but not really sweet, decent hops for a dunkel. Mouthfeel could have been fuller. Moderate but pleasant aftertaste. Okay."
"Smooth with a light carbonation, mellow aftertaste that fades fairly quickly. Good flavor and balance, well worth a try."
"Fizzy mineral start to the taste, quick and slight herbal hop bite. Then the malt follows, toasty and a little burnt around the edges, but full and round and delicious. Molasses and raisins, along with nut and stewed fruit flavors. The finish is drying, with a slightly bitter and dusty aftertaste. Healthy carbonation keeps it all bouncing around your tongue. Pretty darn tasty, especially with this bratwurst and bratkartoffeln."
"Medium-light body."
"Drinkability: The drinkability is high for me, because I got this beer for $1.59. If you can get at that price get some. But I can't see paying much more for this beer. I'll continue to stick with their Asam-Bock."
"Light bodied, but too coarse to be drinkable."
"It's interesting what one discovers when reading the fine print on labels. Along the side of the back label, in print so fine as to suggest embarrassment on the part of the brewers, are listed the ingredients: water, malted barley, hops and hop extract. Uh... yeast is necessary in the brewing of beer the last time I checked. Hop extract is an affront to my sensibilities as a hophead, but I'll try not to let that adversely affect my impressions of Barock-Dunkel. Bottom line: this is pretty close to average beer."
"Although the freshness date is 4-2-05 (which probably means Feb. 4, 2005 since this is brewed in Deutschland), I can't help but think that this bottle must have been sitting out in the bright lights of World Market for way too long. Or maybe the ""05"" means 1905. The objective reviewer in me says that a beer can't possibly be meant to taste like this and wants to buy another bottle just in case this one was horribly spoiled. The realistic part of me, however, would rather spend $2.29 on a pint of pureed cow manure."
"Drinkability Â– This is not my idea of the style, but it wasnÂ’t bad and definitely drinkable."
"Wow what a nice pour!A medium brown with a reddish tint with a huge foamy head that sticks nicely to the glass,aroma is very cracker-like with a touch of cocoa but just a touch.A very clean tasting beer lightly sweet and grainy with a touch of iron and a hint of clove.Now this is a beer to drink for any occasion clean but satisfying and just enough flavor to make it interesting a real winner."
"Dark brown color. Head is small and foamy white. Aroma is slightly sweet and malty. A mild bodied dunkel. Mild taste. Nice sweet malt flavor. Well balanced. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice beer"
"Rasins and mollasses in both nose and flavour, some burnt toast. Creamy and raisiny palate, with some nice burnt bitterness in the finish, some roast, slightly sticky and sweet, pleasant dunkel however it couyld be a little less sweet and could with a touch less of that mollasses flavour."
"Notes: All in all a subdued brew. Flavors need to be punched in the face. For better or worse, goes down like water."
"Pours a beautiful amber/brown color with a nice fluffy light brown/tan head that retains well.  Great aroma of nice earthy yeastiness and some smooth caramel maltiness.  The first taste is that of the caramel maltiness that nicely transitions into some great chocolatey flavors.  The earthy/herbal yeasty qualities are also very much present in the flavor as well and are very nicely done.  The maltiness of this brew gives it a great smoothness while it is kept fairly chewy by the yeasties and is also well carbonated.  This is one very drinkable brew and I would definitely suggest it to any who can find it."
