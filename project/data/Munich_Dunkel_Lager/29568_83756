3.65,-1.9,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"A good solid beer, not as malty, and roast character is not as subtle, as a Munich Dunkel, but roast is not as overdone as many American breweries attempting the style, but still one of the better attempts I've tasted from an American brewery. Darker than what the style calls for I believe. I'd definitely drink it again, but would seek out a true German Dunkel when wanting to satisfy my Dunkel craving.","beerman58","Jan 15, 2015"

4,7.5,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy dark reddish brown color with a small dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of chocolate, caramel, pear, apple, toast, toffee, biscuit, molasses, nuttiness, light roast, floral, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity of malt notes with light yeast fruitiness. Taste of chocolate, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, pear, apple, light roast, floral, and earthiness. Lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light fruits, light nuttiness, and earthiness on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance and robustness of malt flavors with light-moderate fruitiness; with good complexity and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an damn nice dunkel lager! Great balance and robustness of malt flavors with moderate fruitiness; and extremely smooth to drink. Really enjoyed this one; one of the better examples in the style I have had.","superspak","Mar 02, 2013"

The smells are of caramel, toffee and nuts. The feel is medium. The taste is okay, a little bitter roasted malts, some toffee, not bad.","DavidST","Dec 03, 2012"
3.67,-1.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Nice flavor profile too...sweetness is tangible but not overboard and the chocolate flavors are really nice. There is still a bit of nutty, caramel character too. The mouthfeel is a treat; rich and creamy for a lager and the carbonation is really fine-bubbled. Fits the style profile fairly well, but also has a bit of a milk stout aspect to it as well. After a bad introduction to Pedernales (the IPA), the Texas Lager and Negro Lobo have impressed me enough to pick up a sixer next time I see it around.","twiggamortis420","Nov 26, 2012"
