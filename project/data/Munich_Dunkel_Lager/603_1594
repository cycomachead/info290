The smell was a little odd to me, but enjoyable. This will sound weird but I got a baking soda and vinegar smell along with nutty, wheat. I also got a bit of a vinegar and baking soda taste from this beer which wasn't necessarily bad because it was very subtle, but it was odd. I also got some nutty flavors and a wheat back end. It had a decent mouthfeel but nothing overly special. I enjoyed this beer in a slightly odd way, but I don't know if I'll buy it again.","general_staal","Aug 03, 2013"

Im a sucker for a good dunkel and this beer scratches that itch quite well...I like it. It does show some lager brewing flaws, some diacetyl in particular, but it doesnt work against the beer too much. Its not too toasty that can sometimes just get a little acrid when combined with the hops. I wish this style was brewed more by American craft breweries, it really hits that 'malty, sessionable note'..for me at least.","twiggamortis420","May 05, 2013"

Flavor is a nice combination of lightly-toasted bread and very mild caramel along with a touch of sweetness and light hops. Light to medium body with moderate carbonation; fairly chewy.

3.41,-5.3,4,3,4,2.5,3,"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Boulevard Smokestack goblet. This beer pours a nice rich brown with a small head that quickly recedes into a lily pad on the center of the glass. The aroma is straight up malts, with absolutely no hop presence. I also detect some dark fruits, plums and apples. The taste follows suits with a big malty presence, dark fruits, and brown sugar. The mouthfeel reminds me of soda pop. Highly carbonated with a sharp carbonation, the kind that burns the roof of your mouth if you let it sit in your mouth and burns the back of your throat as you try to swallow. While I'm happy to try any beer once, the mouthfeel is enough to keep me for seeking it out again.","hwwty4","Sep 24, 2008"

Warm, sweet malty aroma, some brown sugar and a hint of roast, freshly milled grain, nuts, and some caramel. Mild bitterness. Toffee and light brown sugar up front, a bit of roast towards the end with growing bitterness. Pretty toasty and malty overall. Lightish body with carbonation that's not overpowering yet still lively. The texture is on the creamy side to start, then becomes a little more astringent and dry in the finish. I like it.

4.21,16.9,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This poured with a huge, bubbling, deep-tan head that simply reduced itself to wispiness in no time. The color was a deep, cola-brown with cherry-red highlights. The nose was lightly malty, but that was about all. I got a chocolaty flavor on the tongue and the mouthfeel was light, but about right for a lager. The finish had that same chocolate aspect that I noted on the tongue. Compared to the earlier Celestial Gold, this is eminently drinkable. I really liked this beer and would certainly consider it for a session, given its low ABV.","woodychandler","Mar 06, 2006"

3.55,-1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"22 oz. bottle. Pours a deep copper color with a light beige head. Subtle Munich malt chocolatey aromas, and some distinctively smelling German hops. It smells crisp. At first sip, it seems a little thin; but I suppose the good, roasty quality of the taste makes up for it. It has a mineral or hard water type of feel to it. Its maltiness is sweet and roasty/toasty and there's an inkling of fruitiness. It's a slighest bit tart in the finish, maybe some drying effects from both the malt and hops. Not a bad dunkel, a decent sessioner.","crookedhalo","0"
3.88,7.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Served as part of their beer sampler. This one was a deep and dark orange color that was one step away from brown. Very clear and topped off with a thin tan/orange creamsicle-like head of foam. The aroma is nutty, rich with semi-sweet caramel and has plenty of toffee-like malt character. After a few more whiffs, I could swear I was getting some buttery popcorn notes. Very interesting and somewhat complex. The taste is nice and malty, richly flavorful with dark and sweet candy. The body is just a few clicks above medium and has a very nice sticky malt finish. Overall, a very nice dunkel. Not too heavy, but still leaves a sweet tangy coating on the tongue. By far, the most malty of the nights beers.","pezoids","Jun 07, 2004"
