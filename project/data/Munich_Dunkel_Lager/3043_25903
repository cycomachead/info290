3.67,-3.7,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear, deep brown with a yellowish-tan head that dissipates quickly, leaving little lacing. Lots of things going on in the aroma, especially as it warms a bit. Bready Munich malt, chocolate, molasses, nutty and a strong sweet smell. Taste: The first thing that comes to mind is that this is not a Munich Dunkel style. Thereâ€™s some rye malt character there with a weaker hop profile, much like a Euro Dark Lager. Whether it fits the Munich Dunkel taste profile exactly or not, this is a great beer, in my opinion! Grainy, bready flavors with hints of dark chocolate, brown sugar and ripe fruity flavors. Medium bodied with a light-to-medium carbonation level, making it silky smooth. No alcohol warmth detected. Paired very nicely with the warm, buttered pumpernickel I had with it. Overall, this was a great beer for a great price! I paid $2.39 for a single 16.9 oz. bottle. I will definitely grab this one again.","kvnstfrd","Dec 10, 2012"

The taste is ever so slightly heavy in taste but not by much. There is a decent combination of hops, malts, and yeast to make a dark beer that drinks fairly easy. Although it drinks well, it really could use some work in flavor department as the taste is kind of bland. For a small city, this was a rather interesting find.","Lemke10","Sep 12, 2012"

The nose comprises dark fruit, very light roasted malts, light toffee, and raisins. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some extra roast, a touch of toasted bread, and a sprig of light clove.

3.53,-7.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured a capped 500ml bottle into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a deep mahogany brown with a massive 3 inch creamy cap that leaves some pretty substantial lacing down the sides of the glass. Good start. The aroma starts off with a little overly toasted bread with just a little bit of coffee and dry mocha powder. Nice roasted aroma but fairly one dimensional. The flavor continues that line. Nice roasted flavor starts off. Toasted bread with just a little chocolate powder mixed with with this odd underlying sweetness. Not sugary per say but almost like a generic grape juice sweetness. Just a touch of ripe tree fruits. No perceivable hop presence. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy with just a bit of dryness at the finish. While I'm a huge fan of crisp, clean lagers, I feel that this one is just a bit one dimensional.","hwwty4","Dec 11, 2010"

4.53,18.9,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The first thing that is impressive about this beer is an outstanding dark, ruby/garnet color. The head is rich and generous with excellent retention and even, thin lacing. The smell is sublime - roasted malt, chocolate, and caramel wafting above clean, light hops and slight hints of fruit. The flavor profile is fantastic, lighter than expected but quite rich. Mainly I get roasted malts and cocoa, but it washes down with a very refreshing lightness. It is actually very hard to describe the flavors hiding in this complex beer. There are some fruit undertones and a hint of very mellow hops, but it is all very subtle. The enjoyment is there is every sip, though. There are no downsides, and I can find nothing that detracts from the great flavor. The body is medium and the mouth feel is superb. Of course, I was lucky enough to have this on tap, and I understand from talking to others that this is definitely a ""better on tap"" beer. Or, maybe all beers are, after all? Please track this down and try it if at all possible.","MNJR","Aug 14, 2010"

The nose is mild but very enticing, with clear if not strong sweet caramel tones. The mouth is well carbonated and quite sticky, coating all sides with a viscous coating that prolongs the taste sensation. And the taste is quite good. Slightly roasted malt and a bit of sweetness at first yield to a slightly burnt espresso bitter aftertaste that lingers very well. This is definitely not your average Viennese Dunkel - it has spirit and character. Easily my favorite bottled Austrian beer after 2.5 months of fairly intensive research.","Globetrotter","0"
