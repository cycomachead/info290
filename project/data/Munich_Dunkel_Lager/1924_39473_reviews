"Actually really good, & interesting choice to make a pumpkin lager rather then a ale. Good job DuClaw!"
"Not my wife's favorite but a nice choice overall with a decent pumpkin spice flavor."

"Had two pints at dinner with Braised Short Ribs in Philadelphia. Not a spicy as I anticipated. Didn't get too much from the nose. Very tasty and drinkable. I think it's a nice fall selection beer on tap. I recommend it. It's not very hoppy and can be a session beer (in a safe environment, of course)."

" The taste is very good with nice spice flavor up front with light spice flavor up front with fruity element and caramel in the malt with dry cinnamon-like woody element in the spicy dry finish. This is a pretty good dark lager with some spice flavor -very crisp character with good blend of malt and spice flavor"

"O: A very  drinkable pumpkin lager. I notice that I'm guing rather than sipping - I need to buy a few more of these."

"O:  Not my kind of pumpkin beer.  Just like nutmeg and cinnamon in a lager."
""
""
"  Overall – This is a rather nice pumpkin brew with a good roasted pumpkin flavor and a nice blend of sweet and spice.  Overall, quite drinkable and enjoyable."

"This one had a good bit of inherent carbonation so I could not pour it as quickly as I would like, but I still got a pseudo-cascade, resulting in three fingers of foamy, tawny head with moderate retention. Color was a deep, coppery-amber (SRM = > 13, < 17) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had the characteristic ""pumpkin spice"" smell of at least cinnamon and allspice. Mouthfeel was medium and the spiciness was immediately evident on the tongue, especially cinnamon. Strangely enough, the taste put me more in mind of apple pie. I don't mean this as good or bad, just different. Actually, given the plethora of pumpkin beers that I ran through last year, this would make for a nice change of pace, especially since it has a lager as its base. The spices made the finish fairly dry, but pleasantly so, not gasping. I would put this one forth as an alternative to all of the pumpkin ales, if nothing else."

"O: Overall I think this a great fall time beer. I usually am not a big pumpkin fan with beer but this one is the perfect pumpkin beer for me. It is not overwhelming and still has that nice beer taste as opposed to a strong pumpkin pie taste."
"O- It's a middle of the road beer for me. Nothing that blows my socks off but it has a good flavor and is easy to drink. Kind of a winding down the season beer. After tasting at least half a dozen pumpkin and fall beers it fits just right for a tired palate."

"Overall: Damn, this is a good beer. No, this is a great beer. I love how complex the flavor profile it is, how nicely balanced between malt, and spice and hops it is. I’m always going to have some of this on hand."
""
"This beer has a dark rich mahogany color body with very little head. The smell has a light aroma of cinnamon and some some malt. The taste is not over powering of any spice just very well balanced between the cinnamon and nutmeg. It also has a nice malt back bone to it. Mouthfeel is nice and overall it is good but not great. I didn't get any pumpkin from it"

"O - Flat out disgusting, I cant see this being good in winter or any other time. I wouldnt let an un-welcomed guest drink this."
"Doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the beer. Besides the fact that it isn't all that interesting. Kind of has this clogged flavor profile thing going on. Decent, but too thick. I guess this isn't filtered? Pretty good, but thicker than you'd usually get for the style."

"O- Pretty good fall/winter beer. Almost like a pumpkin spice lager without the pumpkin (if that makes sense)."

"Overall nothing to seek out again but it was a good offering from these guys."

"was in a maryland beer shop decide to try another one of her native brews. been a good while since i had a dunkel . nice deep amber color . wonderful spicy aroma of cloves and i want to say allspice. reminds me of apple cider.not to complex in the flavor department but it suits this beer well. this is a great beer for a chilly fall evening."

"I have to admit. I saw the label at the store and bought some, but tried it on tap first at DuClaw in Arundel Mills. Now I'm glad I bought it. Deep mahogany to black in color, with subtle carbonation and virtually no head, though the foam at the edges laced the glass nicely all the way down. Subtle roasted malt (dunkel) in the nose and a very (emphasize very) smooth, moderate mouthfeel at initial taste. Flavor was fairly straightforward dunkel, not really sweet, but rich in flavor, with a nice bitterness at the end that was enhanced in a flavorful way by (I'm assuming) the cinnamon. Definitely not ""in your face"" spiced at all. Very balanced and flavorful. The spices, instead, enhance the flavors of the beer. Equally drinkable. Went down very quickly. Loved every second of it."
"4.0 D: Really enjoyed this. I've never had a beer so saturated with spices that also tasted quite good. Pick this up if you like spicy pumpkin beers."
"D - An interesting creation... Quite sessionable with good flavor and lots of character... I always enjoy what DuClaw has to offer in terms of creativity... A nice little beer that those into creative brewing should check out..."
""
"O: Come on people, let's give DuClaw credit for this one. I know this is not a popular style with the BA crowd due to its low ABV, but I personally think this is an awesome beer and deserves to be ranked up there with the big dogs. This is now my favorite DuClaw beer!"
""
""
"O: This was an awesome brew – my first time with a Double Spiced Munich Dunkel – and it did not disappoint."
""
"Overall: I thought this beer was just alright. The spices made it interesting, but nothing too special. I don't think I'll search it out again."
"O - I figured this would be an easy drinking lager with just a few spices added, but I was wrong...this came across pretty much as a pumpkin ale to me, minus the actual pumpkin...those pumpkin pie spices and lager characteristics really blended together nicely"
"D - Not bad but a bit too sweet for me to want more than one."
"Drinkability: this one grew a bit tiring as the pint glass emptied. Interesting effort, but a straight up dark lager would have worked much better without the spice."
"D: One and done for me. I still don't see the need for spices..."
"Much like last spring's limited seasonal, El Guapo, DuClaw has snuck this one in between monthly releases and has provided yet another enjoyable surprise of a beer that is both tasty and quaffable. Easy drinkablily and a satistying fall-like spice kick definitley make this Halloween release more treat than trick. Hopefully they will see fit to release this again sometime down the line."
