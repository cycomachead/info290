Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, nuttiness, biscuit, molasses, raisin, prune, light chocolate, and light earthy spiciness. Very nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, molasses, raisin, light chocolate, and light herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of caramel, toffee, nuttiness, toast, light chocolate, and biscuit on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robust flavors with great balance and very clean; no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy and very crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed at all on the finish. Overall this is an excellent Dunkel lager.

There was a slight head that quickly dissipated with a slight lacing on the glass. I took a good sniff and smelled roasted malts and some burnt chocolate. When I took that first mouthful the taste was pretty much like it smelled, roasted malts, a little bready with a burnt chocolate taste. The mouthfeel is a medium feel, a little thinner than some of the dunkels, but not light on taste. Not an abundance of carbonation. Also there isn’t a hint of alcohol. This Dunkel is a nice easy drinking Dunkel. I could have drank a bunch of these for sure. The taste is very nice with a sweeter taste.

I would prefer it to be a little thicker and flavorful but the lightness makes it a refreshing easy drinker and good selection for a hot afternoon. For $4 a bottle I don't think I will be revisiting it but if I just have to have a light Dunkel I might be inclined to buy this, but it would help if it was a dollar cheaper. If you want a lighter dunkel give it a try but it isn't worth going out of your way to find it. Not the ultimate dunkel I was searching for, the search continues.","StoutHunter","Nov 20, 2010"

4.15,7,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"The palate is just wonderful. Rather rich with a blend of toasted bread, caramel and a little burnt sugar, this beer is very flavorful. This is rather grainy, but in a way that makes me think of brown rice, if that makes any sense, with delicate flavor but very clean and not particularly husky, like wheat can be. Despite the sweet flavors, this is really light on the palate, and dries up on the finish with crisp carbonation, a little burnt sugar and some toast. Hops aren't really noticeable, but that might be because of age. Carbonation is medium-high and is pretty much perfect for this beer.

There's a pretty bubbly head with lots of different sized bubbles that goes away pretty quickly, not much lacing, a few little blotches randomly stick to the glass. Not much of an aroma to the smell. It smells very sweet. Caramelized malts seems too weak of an argument, I'd go with caramel soaked or topped. The taste is pretty good, again it's pretty sweet. Caramelized malts take the bulk of the flavor with some toffee notes. There's also a hint of nuts to it, candied though with the slightest taste of alcohol. Slight hop on the aftertaste.

4.83,24.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"I spotted this in my local store (Brawley's) and gave it a whirl. It poured with a little head, showing that it wasn't overly carbonated. The aroma immediately gave me hints of chocolate, some toasting, and a little floral tones. It had a great malty taste right away on the palate, a little nutty and with a nice chocolate finish. In the aftertaste, you get some of the hops, but a good continuing malty flavor. So smooth. When in Germany, I had the pleasure of going to Kloister Andechs. That was probably my favorite Dunkel of all, but this Ettaler stacks up nicely. If you find it, definitely pick one or ten of them up.","bdupree","Aug 25, 2006"

2.07,-46.6,3.5,1.5,2,4,1.5,"Appearance and mouthfeel were typical for the style. The aroma and flavor were awful. As I poured, I thought something must have gone bad in my kitchen, but a stale malt flavor was rising from the glass. The flavor reminded me most of rancid raisins. The date on the bottle was 10 10 05 (not sure if that is a drink by, or a made on date.) I will try re-reviewing this in the future, as I may have had a bad bottle, but I doubt it. One of only two or three beers I have ever dumped.","CH3CH2OH","Jun 16, 2006"
4.13,6.4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Taste; very malty, with caramel, chocolate and bread dough. The raisins and nutty flavors came through, but were not very strong. There was almost no bitterness to speak of, and the finish was on the sweet side. While this wasn't the most complex beer out there, it was a very enjoyable drink. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, and very drinkable.","RedHaze","Jun 03, 2006"

4.56,17.5,5,4,4.5,5,5,"Mmmm, dunkel. Pours a caramelly dark brown with a luscious tan head that sticks around throughout drinking. Smell is all dark malts, with molasses and caramel present, but highly attenuated by a dry, roasty malt note. The taste of this beer is quite pleasant and malty, with caramel and dried date leading the way in the flavor department. This beer is very, very smooth and easy drinking. I can't think of a better example of the dunkel style that I've tried. Highly recommended.","geexploitation","Mar 20, 2006"

October can't arrive soon enough!","yelterdow","Feb 27, 2006"
4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Big whiff of honeycakes and brown sugar in the aroma. Quite appealing smell. Dark brown to copper with a pinky thin white head. Fore is honey, malt sweet. Very substantial tasting like the aforementioned honeycake though the mouthfeel isnt thick or at least no thicker than it should be. Some caramel malt notes in there as well. The range is narrow, but the beer is very tasty.","Jredner","Feb 11, 2006"
3.95,1.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"An aggressive pour in my 23 ounce pilsner glass resulted in a HUGE off-white head, which faded into a soft ring that left nice lacing. Malt and pine hops on the nose, with rye bread. Smells kind of like a bock. Taste is clean hopped malt, with notes of chocolate and coffee. Dry finish, with light hop bitterness. Really pretty nice. Mouthfeel is good and round, pretty outstanding for a lager. Very easy to drink, with not too much carbonation and only 5.0%. This would make a nice session beer!","ColoradoBobs","Feb 02, 2006"

No real hop presence. Finishes sweet. Very good body for style. Extremely drinkable beer. Has to be the best dunkel I have had.

3.78,-2.6,3.5,3,4,4.5,4,"Poured out to more of a amber red, than a dark brown. Short lived head resulted in a thin layer of foam after a few moments. Minor lacing around the glass. Medium carbonation. Aromas of, well, not much. Traces of sweet malt and light hops were noted. Woulda been a helluva lot better if i didn't have to struggle to get some type of smell. Flavor was a nice pick-up point area for this brew. Notes of un-sweet caramel, medium malt and some smoke-like spice was also noted toward the finish, albeit weak. Nice mouthfeel, very crisp and refreshing. This could be a nice place to start for those looking for a gateway into German Dark Beers. Recommended.","Frozensoul327","Aug 28, 2005"

Nice chocolate color, the 1/2 inch head left pretty quick. I am picking up some rich malt, actually almost a low vinous and pleasant note in there as well.
