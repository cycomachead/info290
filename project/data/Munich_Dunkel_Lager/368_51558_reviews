"another fun unheard of brew from the beer census guys, they really hooked me up! this is loosely a german dark lager, and i think its pretty authentic. the malt is more like a brown ale with some chocolate character, more like dry cocoa, and a hint of caramel while staying dry and light on the palate. the lager yeast is evident here, it does a nice job drying up the finish and giving it a seasonally perfect crispness. im not sure why i expected this to be darker and heavier like a porter, but i am pleasantly surprised by its lightness overall. the grain captures all the darker flavors, but drinks like a blonde lager, just easy down with upbeat carbonation and a quick finish. probably one of the better american takes on this style i have come across, true to german roots but just different enough. i could drink a sixer of these no problem, and enjoy and appreciate the lower abv."

"A well-balanced, easy-drinking traditional dark lager! Enjoyable!"

"Capital Dark pours a dark brownish color with a small lacing head. There is a malty and yeasty aroma. The taste is much of the same, good yeasty flavors, with a good solid malty backbone. Good body, nice flavors, a bit on the watery side. Overall its a nice dunkel watery, but enjoyable."

"O- This beer is clean and well lagered with hints of flavor from some dark malt that takes on a bit of a woody oxidized flavor as it opens."

"Beer is medium-light to light in body, with a bit of wateriness noticeable around the edges. Carbonation is medium to medium-high, creating a fairly prickly mouthfeel at first, before the beer fizzes up on the palate to become more flowing and creamy. Finish is semi-dry."

"Overall - Not as malty as I'd hoped. Nothing horrible, but I wanted more."

"10-10-13-found a bottle of this that was sitting in the cellar since the 4/12 review. A beer that is definitely different fresh. After 1.5 years it has taken on a pretty strong raisin type flavor. Finish is long and moderately bitter. Still drinkable but now tastes like a hybrid dunkel/dubbel. It's not bad-just kind of odd. Growing on me as I finish it."

"Appears a transparent yet darker reddish-brown in color with a single finger of fizzy cream colored head that dissipates down to a collar in about two minutes, no lacing. Smells of medium levels of dark roasted malt character with a prune / fig garnish on top. Tastes mostly malty, but maintains strict levels of dryness throughout with a strong level of carbonation on a lighter body. I've had better and I've had worse than this one for the style."

"And, they kind of nailed it. It's dark ruby and smells like cereal malt, german yeast, and fruit. The worst part is the middle, which is a little too sour for the style. The best part is the end, where the yeast rubs up against the bitter malt and a lit wee bit of spicy hop and dark and ashen and refreshing."
"D: Good beer to go back to back with, refreshingly light in taste but with a quality that is savory."
"Very nice. Well put together, and certainly a bold flavor."
"overall this is an ok dark lager but not worth a repeat buy"
"Overall a decent Munich Dunkel. Good bit of roasted malt flavor."
"Very average, light with not much going on, even for a session lager a bit on the boring side."
"D: Not my favorite Capital, nor the best Dunkel. There are much better out there; that being said I could easily down a 6 pack of this...average."
"Second, the style listed herein, on Beer Advocate, is a Dunkel. Some other lesser regarded, but more commercial site (I didn't say ratebeer here) said Dunkel too. CD is a bit too tight and malty to carry the description of Dunkel but CD retains some of the crisper flavors of Dunkel to warrant it more of its cousin; there's enough of a hint of Dunkel in CD to know its in the family, but it has different parents. Dork, or Dunkel, lets just say CD, is rather like a blend of Munich Lager with some Dunkel added."
"Drink a very drinkable beer I could easily down a 6 pack."
"D -- Drinkability is definitely good, this is a dark beer to scare your friends with then watch their surprise at it smoothness and ""lightness."" I just wish this was more like a true Munich Dunkel; sort of like a Doppelbock in character without the high ABV kick."
"D: Very nice. Well put together, and certainly a bold flavor."
"Overall another solid lager from Capital. They sure do love the lagers."
"(D)- Truthfully, not one of my most favorite styles, but this is rather good for what it is. Fits the style well and works well as something for the early fall season next to a bonfire. Good stuff."
"A: Light brown in color, thin layer of light head, quite clear - 3.50, S: Initial whiff has a strong cacao and powered chocolate milk mix though the nose fades relatively quickly, faint fudge and candied dates, some roasted grains, no real hops that I can perceive - 3.00, T: Medium roasted malt on the palate, soft coffee, noticeable earthy hop bite - likely one of the nobles, a bready sweetness is present along with some chocolates - 3.75, M: Medium bodied - 3.50, D: All around a very drinkable beer - 3.50"
"An easy drinking flavorful lager. Not world class, but I'd have another."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a clear dark amber when held to the light has a great red hue. There was a 1 finger off white head that settled to a thin cap. The aroma is a spicy with some dark malt notes and a slight molasses hint. The taste is malty upfront with some dried fruit in the back, plums, raisins, and burnt caramel. The brew is a little thin and the light carbonation could be a little stronger. This is an OK brew, but not really a bold dark lager as I like."
"tasty brew. here's to subtlety!"
"Pleasent on the tongue, and very easy going down. I was thinking I could drink alot of these."
"Drinks pretty easy, a good shot at the style & by far the best of the 3 Capital brews sent here to Oklahoma recently..."
"D/O- Not impressed overall. Don't know that I'd want anymore than one of these even though I'd call it a session brew."
"This is a dark red-black beer with a mild coffee ground and grape aroma. It's light bodied and fizzy with coffee, cherry, and cola, with a nice hint of hops at the end. It goes down very easy, which might be the best thing for a dark lager. It doesn't have anything to bring me back, though."
"D - This isn't a bad brew, and the low ABV definitely lends to its sessionability. I probably won't make it a mainstay in my fridge but it was certainly worth a try."
"The nose could be a little stronger and the carbonation is a little higher than I expected -- I think that may be why my impression only improved as the beer warmed / rested. Overall great beer that will serve well as a good sessionable/easy drinking brew."
"Nothing extraordinary but a good solid brew."
"Darn fine brew, tasty and ""sessionable", as the 5+ % not really kicking in for a bottle or two. I'd have no problem picking up a sixer this winter."
"A nice simple dark beer, though not a lot to it. Poured from the bottle to a dark chocolate brown with medium thick tan head that lasted to mid-glass and left okay lacing. Aroma was a faint caramel toffee as was the flavor of this medium bodied. Finish was smooth and medium duration, but again left no distinguishing mark. Kind of just ho-hum."
"We had the pleasure of meeting head brewer Kirby Nelson at Steve's Liqours, where he was promoting some winter beers and offering tastings. He's a fantastically nice fellow, and a Zappa fan (he names all their fermenters after Zappa songs - pics coming). Having studied with a German lager master, this beer definitely plays to Kirby's strong points. Highly recommended."
"D - A decently rounded beer that really lacks panache. It's ok overall and would be a fine six-pack to purchase but I find it a mediocre tasting beer. Good drinkability steers this beer towards a session dark."
"The body is moderate to light. Would like a bit more depth there but overall a very nice beer. Would like a bit more Munich notes and a cleaner yeast but very easy to drink."
"Pours a clear, dark amber color. 1/2 inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and poor lacing. Smells of yeast, hops, sweet malt, very slight roasted malt, and some nut. Fits the style of a Munich Dunkel Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, hops, sweet malt, and slight roasted malt. Overall, a rather smooth yet full-bodied lager - I recommend."
"Friday my local store got the six-packs in stock and I couldn't wait to try it. Very nice dark amber appearance. Smelled very much like munich malt with hints of coffee. Tasted mostly like the munich malt. very smooth, dry. This could easily find its way back in my fridge. Its a knockout dark lager from one of my fav. local breweries."
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A fairly complex offering, with quite a bit of character. And fairly drinkable, both in texture and ABV. A great offering from Capital, it seems to have a creamier mouthfeel and more character both in texture and complexity than the Munich Dark of old, although maybe my mind is just playing tricks on me and they are both actually the same thing lol?"
"Thanks, kmadison, for the opportunity"
"This is not a complex beer, but what flavor it has is well-done. It is no Burgerbrau dark, but it is very well made for an American representation of an age-old style that hails from when beer was meant to be drunk in vast quantities because it was safer and more fun than water. Prosit!"
"I think it tastes better as it warms to room temperature; the malt is tasty and bready. Vaguely sweet, but not too extreme in any direction flavor-wise. This malt balances out nicely as it warms. Extremely drinkable brew, just not one I would seek out."
"My overall impression is that this is good enough to drink in most instances and I'd recommend it to anyone. However, it isn't very daring or unique, so it's not worth going out of your way to seek out. If you stumble upon it and want a good German-style beer, pick it up!"
"Worth a go."
"Notes from: 4/10/07"
"D - This is a pretty tasty dunkel lager. It was easy drinking and is sessionable."
"Great tasting beer from Capital Brewery. Good malt flavor comes through without being sweet. Pours a very light head with a rim of head holding on to the glass. Bitterness is very balanced and in the background. Very drinkable lager! Clean tasting and pretty smooth."
"Pours a clear maroon pour with a quick fading beige head. Smell is sweet toasty bready tart malt. Taste is thin with some metal and pumpernickel like breadiness. Appropriate balancing bitterness, a touch sweet though overall, and lightly yeasty. A medium to thin body and a touch high carbonation. Drinkable, but average."
"Another decent beer from my home state!!"
"Overall an easy drinking dark lager. Would definitely drink again though wouldn't go too far out of my way to purchase."
"It was nice, very tasty. Refreshing. I could drink this all night."
"You could easily pound back several of these before you realized you'd done so. A great beer for a cool fall day."
"I can't recall having many Munich Dunkel's but this one has some nice attributes. A better than decent brew."
"Clean, a little bland, mild toasted malt and very vague hop bitterness. Hint of diacetyl, but no sweet character at all. Moderate carbonation, it's sort of lively, but the dull flavors don't have much to add to the equation. Utilitarian, no flaws, just sort of ""there"". I enjoyed it a little more when it was very cold."
"Good beer, very flavorful."
"D: A good drinker."
"A nice easy drinking beer,very refreshing. Good to session."
"This is a pretty drinkable and approachable beer that won't blow your socks off, but is nothing to sneeze at either. I'd have it again."
"D: Extremely drinkable. Dare I say, sessionable? Heck, yeah! This one kept getting better the longer it warmed."
"Creamy, but sadly rather boring. Good, fresh malt aroma and quite a bit of foam, but this chestnut colored lager fails to impress. Perhaps it's that this my tasting of this beer is skewed after having a couple dark lagers from the European masters of the style, but that said, this brewery makes better beer. For example, the Capital Special Pilsner is fantastic (especially when fresh). Finishes just very slightly bitter and a touch dry and therefore fairly drinkable. Not a real complex dark lager and a touch ""cardboard-y"" meaning it hasn't held up very well in my fridge....leaky cap? Oh, well...."
"Pours a very dark amber and brown hue. Very awesome bubbling and good lacing. Mineraly malts mixed with some pumpernickel. The tate is a great roasted malt. Medium bread, mor like a hint of light chocolate cake. Very mild, bitter finish. Very girsty, gainy palae, but stil very smooth. Great tap beer I bet."
"Pours a light chestnut brown with a thin light tan head that disappears quickly. Light cocoa aroma with a grassy hop note in the background. A simple straightforward dunkel with decent malt body and just enough hops to not be unbalanced. A medium-light body appropriate for the style. There is certainly nothing in this beer to quickly sate you, but it doesn't do enough that is interesting to make each fresh serving an adventure."
"I will preface this review, by saying I love a well made dunkel... drinkable for days while still allowing multitudes of complexity to be enjoyed. This would be a staple beer if I had any access to it. Edit: This is my last bottle, and already I know I am going to miss it... it is probably the best domestic Dunkel I've had .... but that being said... if you ever make it to the Sun Valley area of Idaho, search out Trail Creek brewing and give theirs a try... fantastic too."
"overall, i really enjoyed this and will be acquiring more"
"This is a wonderful dunkel. Great brown color. Wonderful malt flavors that aren't overpowering. Has a great creamy quality. Munich malt really shines through. Roasted character and mild sweetness, then the hops hit you in the finish. This has great drinkability, and would make a decent session beer."
"drinkability is good. this is not a heavy or rich beer, but it does bring bold flavors and character to the palate, which is more than can be said about most other lighter lagers."
"Drinkability - this is very good beer and quite sessionable."
"Nicely done, it's quite ""on"" for the style. It has just enough low-level sugared-edge caramel maltiness and murky hops to keep it interesting but sublime. Very drinkable!!!"
"I was surprised to discover that of the eleven Capital offerings that I've had to date, only one has earned an overall score as high as 4.0. Of course I haven't yet had any of their most well-regarded beer. Munich Dark, along with Wisconsin Amber, is my favorite so far. A beer of this style has to be pretty good to impress me. Take that for what it's worth."
"Smooth film of almost microscopic bubbles in the tannish yellow seems to almost promise the smooth, full body that will follow. Ditto, the cloudy, very dark brown, red/brown hue. Promise is kept, as a wash of slightly sugary malt, bannana, and clove pushes a wave of sweet alcoholic vapors up into my nasal cavities. ""Noble hops."" I swear to God, I was thinking this after my first draught, and before I looked up the description of ""Munich Dunkel Lager," which confirmed that they are often a compoment of this style, Quite a lot of similarities between pub ales & brown ales I've had. I would not have believed a lager could be so complex! Capital beer! (heh heh)"
"Quite drinkable and refreshing. Yes another excellent lager from Capital, which is certainly under rated in my opinion on this site. Complex, yet approachable, ill definately be drinking this one again."
"A pretty average brew. Pours a clear red with some brown, and a foamy tan head. Nose is mostly roasted malts, but with some hints of sweetness. Taste is bitter hops, some malts, and a slight smokiness. Mouthfeel is ok, if thin. Drinkability is average."
"Good carbonation and mouthfeel. If you dig the taste this could easily be an all-nighter."
"Very good drinkability combining all the ingredients necessary. Do not disappoint and serve this beer too cold as I did with my first one. It really opens up when served at 50 degrees or warmer."
"I'm not completely sold on the combination of flavors. Sadly, I drank it too fast to find my complaint. I guess it wasn't so bad afterall. I'll need another and another to find out my problem, and I'm sure by then I'd have to admit I don't know."
"Mouthfeel is frankly ordinary. Drinkablility is very high. It's interesting and quite sessionable. If this was available in these parts it would be a regular for me for sure."
"Drinkability  This went down well enough. It was quite uneventful, which is a plus for the style."
"I liked this one, it was very malty and had a strong roasted flavor to it. It's a nice chocolate brown with a light head that's off white. The smell was unremarkable, giving more of the lager aroma than any hops or malts. Mouthfeel is full, but you know that it's not a stout or something that demands to be chewed. I'd drink a few more of these. (If I had them, and sadly, I don't. :( )"
"taken from the fridge of dirtylou"
"Drinkability: While this beer isn't light on flavor, it doesn't develop much by way of complexity. But as far as the style goes, this is a good rendition. The finish is perfect, and the flavors are balanced. I could certainly drink a lot of this, and appreciate the understated character (against more heavily engineered attempts at dark lagers)."
"Fully transparent copper with a thin creamy beige head and cherry red hues. Smells of caramel, roasted malts, bakers chocolate, and German hops. Toasty, medium, smooth body. Slightly powdery. Very authentic. Taste matches aroma with the clear addition of plum. Sessionable."
"I have tasted this with other Wisconsin dark lagers and never had it the top (and never at the bottom for that matter!) - but it sure tastes great on it's own today. Very enjoyable."
"Looks like cola and has a poor white head. Smells are faint, but I get a tiny bit of apples and caramel or chocolate malts. Flavors are mainly malts (caramel and very very slight chocolate), hops are very faint, but there are also some sour or cidery flavors. Mouthfeel is on the heavy side of thin, and there is a bit of astringency. I can pretty fairly say this is the worst Capital beer I've had, as nearly every aspect of this beer is a little bit lacking in some way."
"I tend to be hard on Capital, because 1) I used to drink it damned near everyday and 2) It is one of my favourite breweries. When I joined BA, I was simply spoiled on their beer."
"Not intensely complex, as is the case with many lagers, but what it lacks in depth it makes up for in refinement and definition. Very easy drinking, flavorful, and delicious. Quite refined and authentic, just as good as the imported stuff from Bavaria's capitol. This one's a gem."
"Slightly thin mouthfeel, but not watery in any way. A drinkable beer, suitable more for October or March (in Minnesota)."
"Opinion: First of all, I must mention that I am really picky about this style, and I really like them to be low-octane Bocks. This beer is still pretty low octane, but it seems like it was brewed primarily with the wrong base malt (like US 2-row). This leaves the beer dry and grainy. There is some CaraMunich and crystal malts thrown in to make the beer taste heavier, but this doesn't make up for the fact that there should have been a larger percentage of Munich malt used in the grist. It is a pretty drinkable beer, but it is an Americanized German Lager. Not as bad as Shiner Bock or the likes...but still lacking roundness."
"This brew pours a hazy brown color with reddish edges. The head is two-fingers in height, creamy, light tan in color, and recededs quickly into a solid cap which covers the liquid nicely. The aroma of caramel, malt, and more caramel. It is rather simple, but very strong and pleasing. The taste is a lot like the aroma, although the caramel taste is a little less intense than the overall malty sweetness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonationl. Overall, this is a very good brew. It is very sessionable, and definaitely something I will buy again."
"drinkabilty: would be higher if not for the mouthfeel"
"-UF"
"Pours a dark mahogany, remeniscent of a dark brown ale, with a minimal off-white head that fades quickly. Smell is bready and malty, got nostalgic for my Newcastle days. Taste is yeasty with toasted bicuit, roasted coffee, lactose, and a bit of belgian-style dark fruits. This seems like a melting pot of dark beers to me, a melange of english brown ale, oatmeal/sweet stout, and a mild belgian. A bit scatterbrained perhaps, but I rather enjoyed it. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but velvety smooth. I could drink quite a few of these until the lacotse sweetness got to me. A lot more character than I would have thought here, glad I gave it a try."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer pours out a dark brown color with an off-white head. The aroma is toasted malt and brown sugar. Toasted malt flavor. Some roastiness. Maybe just a little smoke. Spicy hops come in in the finish. The mouthfeel is a little thin. Good drinkability. Capital makes a number of solid offerings, and this is one of them."
"Nice creamy off-white head of about a 1/2", sitting atop a really dark iced tea looking body. Smell is very sweet with malt, like brown sugar, but less rich and more syrupy than a dopplebock. Taste is rich and fairly dry, good chocolate, and grassy malts, but also spicy with a nice hop bite. Well rounded with good carbonation for the style."
"Dark amber in colour with a slightly sweet aroma. Flavors are an interplay between sweet malts and bready/cracker-like malts. A nice clean finish from a slightly sweet beer is a remarkable thing. In the back of my mind, I tend to think of dunkels as ""mistake beers""... as in:"" I tried to make a lager, but used the wrong grains"". However, this one tastes ""right"" somehow. Well done!"
"Drinkability: This is becoming my favorite style of beer and this is a great example, very drinkable."
"Light-roast coffee brown/amber body with a thick, creamy, light tan head. Nice lacing. Soft, sweetish malt aroma with hints of spicy nuts, cocoa, plums and diet cola. Malt flavors up front; lightly sweet in a fruit cake way. Notes of tobacco, lightly-roasted coffee, plums, and caramel mix together. The light-roasted coffee gets more bitter toward the finish. Finish, however, is mostly soapy-sweet malts with a light veggie-twang and some spicy hop notes in the background. Medium-bodied with a creamy, soft mouthfeel. Very nice. Makes me want to try more beers in this style."
"Overall, this is a tasty beer. Nothing super special, just a nice, easy drinking malty lager. This'll definitely make a return visit to my fridge."
"This is an OK beer, but not a session brew. For a dark lager, it goes down rather easily, but still I can't drink more than one at a time."
"Nicely carbonated auburn brown colored beer with an off white head. Malty aroma with an estery yeast finish which is almost bock-like. The flavor is nice, roasted malt to toasted bread, with solid bitterness. The beer is creamy smooth and then finishes clean with a little astringency on the tongue. This beer is versatile, I could enjoy it with lunch, at a tailgate, or at the bar."
"Drinkability: a slightly above average beer. very subtle and adequate for an ""easy drinker""."
"A very good dunkel. A deep, brownish amber color, a roasty aroma that accentuates the creamy and sweet taste; has a nice malt overtone as a good lager should have, with fruitiness. The flavor is just gorgeous with the sweet finish balanced by a generous helping of bittering hops."
"A good pour of this dark mahogany lager offers a nice tan head that maintains and laces well. The aroma of sweet malt and spice please the nose. The taste backs it up with hints of caramel. A smooth easy drink though a little lite or watery mouthfeel. A good choice for a meal companion on the dark side."
"A good enjoyable Dunkel and I would have rated it higher had it had more umph to it. It poured a small sized tan head that contained fine-medium sized bubbles. The body was carbonated and clear with a reddish-brown hue. The nose was moderately malty and also had notes of caramel to it. The flavor was malty, and sweet with a smooth, somewhat thin and watery mouthfeel. The lacing was fair."
"Nice beer for style. Richness prevents from being a session beer. I liked the contrast of lager ease and ale richness."
"Dark clear reddish brown in color with a small white head doesn't last, with not much in lacing. Bready and nutty aromas, starts sweet and bready with some caramel and nutty flavors, medium bodied, with a nice rounded mouthfeel, finishes smooth and sweet."
"Had this bottled beforehand, and it didn't really impress me. But fresh from the tap, it's a different story. I can now taste a decent dark roast taste, and that's in the middle of an evening with several Oktoberfests on tap. I think I almost an allergic reaction from the hop nose, though actual hop bitterness is not pronouced. One to seek out fresh."
"This is a very dark colored copper/brown beer. On the top is a small tan colored head. The aroma is caramel malts. That goes for the taste as well, caramel is the dominant flavor of this beer. There isnt much contrast to the malty flavor. Slightly bitter tones show through. An alright drink."
"Drinkability: This is a pretty good beer. It's easy-going enough to make it drinkable in just about any weather, but has enough character to hold my attention."
"Munich Dark is a beer brewed in the dunkel style. A very nice domestic interpretation of the style. The beer pours a deep brown with reddish tints a nice soft white head forms leaving nice lacing as it reduces. The aroma is a slight sweet maltiness, no real toasted malt aromas or hop notes. The taste is mild, clean and slightly malty, some rich undertones from the darked malts are noted, but they are smooth, not biting. Likewise, the hop bitterness is only noticeable in the finish. The mouthfeel is a bit light and watery, but nonetheless this is a very nice beer."
"Pleasing."
"This beer pours a clear dark but translucent brown color with a massive dense off-white head. It has a strong grassy and sweet earthy grain smell along with roasted malt. The taste consists of chocolate and roasted malts with light hops and a lightly sweet burnt cocoa finish. This is a light to medium bodied brew and finishes a little sweet. Not bad, but not great. Thanks to budgood1 nonetheless! Cheers!"
"Pours to a ruby brown color with an off-white heat that dissipates quickly. It has a nice, sweet malty, biscuity, and chocolatey aroma. The flavor is malty, chocolatey and biscuity. It is an easy drinking brew. A very good medium bodied beer. Another good Capital brew."
"Nice deeply orangy/red color with an overall brownish tone, thin tannish head that fades leaving a thin haze and very fine stringy lace in small areas of coverage. Smell is soft and light of dark fruits, plum, banana, some nuttyness and creamy maltyness with a touch of light spice. Very subtle in approach on the nose, a bit to light though. Taste is more subtleties of dark fruits, banana, plum, raisin, a touch of sweetness and maltyness, but far to thin and shortly visited, weakened hops near the finish slightly. Feel is thin and lighter medium body, again, it doesn't have any staying power what so ever, just a short memory of what could be. It still makes for good easy drinking. This a short stay in Munich, barely overnite."
"For a dark lager, though, this leads the pack! Fruity, plummy flavor is well-received, but they've got to back it up!"
"This is a beautiful beer in the body. A gorgeous mahogany or dark cherry color that is perfectly clear. The head is fairly small and tan in color. There is no retention. Minimal lace effect and even that is short lived. The nose gives off some roasted notes and a bit of malt. The taste is of toasted malt and there are some subtle hints of nut, spicy hops, and caramel that drift in later. Smooth and creamy body keeps this from feeling too thin and watery. It is very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Dark cherry brown, translucent, light-tan head that reached a fingers worth, soapy retention, some lace. The noses does nothing for me, oddly hollow is it suppose to smell like this? Anyway the palate is lovely with toasty malt, roasted nuts, dry caramel hints and soft floral hops, faint bitterness too. Very tasty! The mouthfeel is thin but not watery not a big negative but a flaw nevertheless. The finish is abrupt with only faint lingering sweetness... dry too. If you want a dark session brew then Munich Dark is the way to go. Id drink it again and maybe next time the nose will jive with me. Regardless, try one."
"A deeper reddish burnt sienna color with a thin tanish head that lasts about 35 seconds. Simple laces. Aroma is quite biscuity and roasty. A shortbread and toffee-like sense to the initial flavor. Nice roasted and somewhat smokey malt flavors with a very well done balancing hop that doesn't call atention to itself. Some sense of thinness in the mouthfeel, but a pleasing finish and a growing sense of dark chocolate on further sips. One of the better Dunkels I've run across, this beer is also a decent candidate for a darker session brew."
"pours out a clear, rust red colour. a thin fizzy head appears which leaves little, if any lace. very pleasant malted aromas of caramel and chocolate, with a soft floral hoppiness that really sets the stage for a great dark lager experience. plenty of sweet maltiness in the flavor department, caramel and chocolate flavors swirl and stir on the palate. barely any hops to be noticed. quite sturdy in body, even for a dark lager. finishes sweet and smooth and slides right on down. easy drinking and extremely tasty. should be drank a little on the warm side for the full taste experience. a great example of the style. highly recommended."
"Poured a dark mahogany with a cream-colored head. Aroma consisted of caramel, chocolate malt and had a feint floral hoppiness to it. Medium bodied and smooth mouthfeel. Rich malty middle. Roasted malt flavors shine through at the start of the finish. Slight smokey nuttiness introduces itself also at this point. Hop bitterness pops up in the end. A fine offering from Capital."
"This beer is now called Munich Dark on the label, and it does show the characteristics of a Dunkel. Sweet caramel malt aroma. Dark brown color with a medium foamy head. Rich and malty with slight bitterness on the back end. Not too shabby."
"This beer is a clear dark ruby.  A thin creamy brown head sits on top and doesn't leave much for a lace.  Big Huge bready and biscuity tones on the nose.  These bread and biscuit tones show up in the taste as well.  Pretty nice.  There's a bit of a roasted aspect, but not much.  A sweet, almost bock-like, malt taste provides the backdrop for the bready, biscuity tones to work. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel.  About medium-full body.  This could work nicely as a dark session brew. While Capital does a lot of other brews that I enjoy more, this one is enjoyable as well."
"Dark bronze / light brown hue w/ brilliant clarity indicative of ample lagering.  Light beige head settles readily into a thin, dense layer. (The head of their other brews seem to settle quickly as well) Decent lace is left.  Mellow chocolate malt upfront in aroma, w/ secondary notes of rich, toasty Munich and dark caramel malt.  As the beer warms and breathes, a pleasant, light nuttiness emerges.  Virtually non existant Hersbrucker hop nose.  The initial flavor profile essentially mirrors the aroma, with chocolate notes and sweetness provided by caramel malt.  Mild hop and roasted grain derived bitterness surface mid palate and counters caramel sweetness well, facilitating overall balance and drinkabilty to this brew.  A bit too light in body and correspondingly light in mouthfeel.  Roasted grain and chocolate combine for a bittersweet, dry finish.  Munich Dark possesses all the characters of an outstanding Dunkel, but falls short bodywise.  All around it remains an enjoyable and well crafted lager."
"This Munich-style dark lager pours with a deep translucent brown color and a foamy off-white head.  The aroma is of generously spicy hops and sweet caramel malt.  The light bready sweet malt and delicate dark maltiness are balanced well by mellow softly spicy hops.   Quite a drinkable beer with a soft finish."
"Good session stuff.  Capital once again does lagers proud."
"This beer poured a very dark reddish amber, almost black color.  Off white head that had little lace.  A light aroma of malt and chocolate.  Some carbonation.  A flavor of malt and chocolate.  A good beer, but their Dopplebock is better."
