3.75,5.9,,,,,,"Had two pints at dinner with Braised Short Ribs in Philadelphia. Not a spicy as I anticipated. Didn't get too much from the nose. Very tasty and drinkable. I think it's a nice fall selection beer on tap. I recommend it. It's not very hoppy and can be a session beer (in a safe environment, of course).","psruss","0"

3.83,8.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This one had a good bit of inherent carbonation so I could not pour it as quickly as I would like, but I still got a pseudo-cascade, resulting in three fingers of foamy, tawny head with moderate retention. Color was a deep, coppery-amber (SRM = > 13, < 17) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had the characteristic ""pumpkin spice"" smell of at least cinnamon and allspice. Mouthfeel was medium and the spiciness was immediately evident on the tongue, especially cinnamon. Strangely enough, the taste put me more in mind of apple pie. I don't mean this as good or bad, just different. Actually, given the plethora of pumpkin beers that I ran through last year, this would make for a nice change of pace, especially since it has a lager as its base. The spices made the finish fairly dry, but pleasantly so, not gasping. I would put this one forth as an alternative to all of the pumpkin ales, if nothing else.","woodychandler","Feb 23, 2014"

4.35,22.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I have to admit. I saw the label at the store and bought some, but tried it on tap first at DuClaw in Arundel Mills. Now I'm glad I bought it. Deep mahogany to black in color, with subtle carbonation and virtually no head, though the foam at the edges laced the glass nicely all the way down. Subtle roasted malt (dunkel) in the nose and a very (emphasize very) smooth, moderate mouthfeel at initial taste. Flavor was fairly straightforward dunkel, not really sweet, but rich in flavor, with a nice bitterness at the end that was enhanced in a flavorful way by (I'm assuming) the cinnamon. Definitely not ""in your face"" spiced at all. Very balanced and flavorful. The spices, instead, enhance the flavors of the beer. Equally drinkable. Went down very quickly. Loved every second of it.","tugdriver7","Apr 28, 2012"
