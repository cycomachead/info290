I wouldn't say it's as smooth as many a Belgium beers but the Dunkel version is something to look forward to. A great tasting full body beer and can be drank in large amounts as I can attest to. I was a recipient of generosity by the Augustiner brew master for we bought direct a 50L keg and brought it back to the states. To say the American beer drinkers were in ahhh of this brew is an understatement.","TOMHONE","Jan 21, 2013"

4.2,8.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Aroma is deep and dark from the start. Rich dark caramel notes are all over this one. Roasted nuts, some brown sugar, dark frits, figs maybe? Really just complex as I even pull a touch of vanilla through after a few minutes. Really nice, and quite full feel for the style, due in most part to near perfect carbonation. This allows the flavor to roll across the palate and really just cling to every ounce of taste buds you have. Caramel, bready notes, hints of light spice are all leading the charge here as each sip seems to become better and better","mikesgroove","May 26, 2011"
4.3,10.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Tasted this one in Munchen, Bavaria on a perfect sunny summer day at the Augustiner brau hall. nice head retention over a clear mahogany/burnt amber body. the aroma is of a bready nature, though i could justify it being nutty as well. the flavor is bready too, but not rich enough to be nuttyÂ—clean, spritzy (once when i was a beer rookie i described a dunkel with the word "velvety") this beer is not velvety, nor should it be. the bitterness is minimal but hop flavor is good sweet and toatly german.","iLovehops23","Feb 18, 2011"

Good dunkel, balanced and tasty.","mtstatebeer","Beers"

3.16,-18.6,4,3,3,3,3.5,"The toasty malt aroma gets you right off the bat. There is a slightly metallic tone in both the flavor and the smell. It has a dark brown body with some little tan bubbles forming the tan head and lace. It has roasted malt taste but that is average for this style. It is a good beer. Do not get me wrong but it is average or less for this area. There is barely any hops bitterness. The mouthfeel is smooth.","MTNboy","May 24, 2009"
