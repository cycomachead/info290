3.43,-7.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"D- I could use a little more bitterness, but those who love a malty lighter lager should be into it. I have only seen it in the Czech Republic. Not complex or overly interesting but a good change of pace when in the land of pilsener","sleazo","Sep 03, 2007"
3.65,-1.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I had a half litre of this on tap in the Czech Inn, Dublin, Ireland on 5th Sept, 2007 (cost 4.60). Served in Kozel glass. Appearence was a dark mahogony brew with thinnish white head. Maybe some haze, but very dark so hard to see. Malty aroma. Tasted well; a not-too complex mix of maltiness and sweetness. A little too sweet for me, but a solid brew nonetheless. Nice beer.","JohnfromDublin","Aug 04, 2007"
3.88,4.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"I was impressed by this beer and have not had alot of this style before so I would like to try more now. I would definitely try some if I saw it here in Ireland or if I go back to Praha.","jspruit","Apr 04, 2007"

3.88,4.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Taste is good; drank it warmer than I prefer. Coffee, some chocolate, yeast and roasted. Yet was lighter than it looked, still easy drinking, though.","Mebuzzard","Jun 12, 2006"

3.48,-6.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"A nice dark, thanks to Radek bought in Poland. Wine brandy colour, bit of lace. Licorice, bit sour, despite malting including caramel. Tad chocolate malt as well. Bit of roast. Not complex, easy drink. A particular dunkel style, OK but not that I seek out.","Sammy","Jan 19, 2006"

2.91,-21.8,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"Pours a clear cola brown under a two finger beige head with decent body and retention, leaving a few lace strands. The nose is very mild - just a bit of grainy malt (not the expected caramel). Slightly viscous mouth with medium carbonation. The taste is mild all around, with some sweet caramel malt as the primary flavor. Essentially no hops to break it up, so the caramel lasts well into the aftertaste. It's drinkable enough, but also pretty ho hum.","Globetrotter","Aug 08, 2005"
3.91,5.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Its low carbonation and its integrated flavours make this a great beer and begs to be drunk in quantity","jarmby1711","Mar 31, 2005"

3.13,-15.9,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Not a lot to say about this one. Average in about all respects, although I did like its appearance. Nice deep red color to it. Otherwise very simple beer. Lots of sweet carmel. this stuff is really sweet. A tiny bit of hops hits at the end, but it's barely noticeable. In all it's an enjoyable brew, but there's lots of much much better ones to be had.","Enygma","Jul 05, 2004"
4.38,17.7,4,3.5,4.5,5,5,"Notes: I've always liked this beer, and its best quality is the way it keeps after travelling - this tastes the same out of the bottle in Australia as in a Bratislava bierkeller. My favourite beer of the style, and most similar styles.","Weizenmensch","Beers"

2.63,-29.3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Served a deep dark almost black with a hint of red color and a big tan headskie which was gone before I got a chance to blink or take a sip. Thin and lacking helpful mouthfeel. This one has that flavor which I like to avoid in beers so I will avoid this beer in the future. Very average and not worth seeking out.","scottum","Dec 03, 2002"
4.13,11,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Produced from special dark malts, which is why the foam is even dark. It is very sweet and light in body. Low alcohol and light cabronation makes it extremely drinkable. The light-to-medium malt body with caramel malt flavors only add to the delicousness of this brew. It's only weaknesses are that the aroma isn't remarkable (how could it be when the taste is so mild?) and the head retention is somewhat poor. Tastee!","stoutman","Aug 05, 2002"
2.63,-29.3,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,"I personally feel that this particular beer is overrated.The colour is nice, aroma is somewhat grainy, almost full bodied with a disappointing taste...tad heavy on the hops with some lingering after taste.....The packaging was impressive tho........","Shiloh","Mar 24, 2002"
2.5,-32.8,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"OK, i only ever sampled this once, and yes i will resample again, given the hight ratings given so far, mine was sweet with a raisiny chocolate flavour, short finish and quite a syruppy texture, i'm starting to think my bottle may not have been as fresh as it could have been.","rastaman","Aug 24, 2001"
4.27,14.8,4.5,5,4,5,3.5,"Very deep and rich amber appearance. Light tan head, with some stickiness/Belgian lace.  Wonderful rich chocolate/coffee smell.  Unbelievable dark, rich taste.  This beer tastes very much like cocoa.  I can not imagine drinking more than one of these at a time, as one bottle would take the place of  a whole German chocolate cake and a cup of sweetened espresso.","jackndan","Beers"
4.76,28,5,4,5,5,5,"One of my favorite Czech beers...Richly dark and chocolate in flavor...I'm not sure if you can get this in the states but if you can I highly recommend it...a great everyday beer","grdahl","0"
