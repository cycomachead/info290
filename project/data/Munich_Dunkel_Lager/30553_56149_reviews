"Very smooth dark beer with hints of an amber ale."

"Overall:  This is a damn tasty beer!  Itâ€™s an excellent version of a Bavarian Dunkel."
"Overall: A serviceable brew, and one that I could session a few of, but one on the lower end of the taste scale."
""
"Light for the style beer.  I had it on tap and was vary surprised by taste and smell. Highly recommended."

"$6.99 a six pack it's a great value. If I was rating on price alone it would be a 5 compared to other beers in that price range"

"Pours a pretty darker amber in color with a good almost 2-fingers beige head that settles down to about 2mm on top. Nice lacing is seen when sipped, some in rings even. Lots of streaming bubbles rising up from the bottom of the glass but perfect carbonation and isn't overdone. The aroma is of malts with a hint of toffee and caramel. Even more going on with the taste than the aroma suggests with a hint of nut and cocoa even. Very smooth and very easy to drink. No harsh or bitter aftertaste at all. Truly a really good brew!"

"O - Munich Dunkel might not be the most popular style in the craft beer world but this German-style brewer has nailed the classic dark German lager with Slingshot. Nutty, bread-like maltiness never becomes too sweet or aggressive, just finishing cleanly for a really tasty, easy drinking beer!"

"This is a solid beer. If the palate transferred the sweet complexities of the nose, this beer would be in my fridge indefinitely."

"Overall not too bad for a dunkel"

"O No glaring flaws, but no discernible character either. Honestly, it reminds me of an extract homebrew. If my buddy had home brewed this, I would drink it. I would however not pay for it."

"Overall - very well made beer. Worth a look if you like German beers. Could compete with some true German-made beers."

"Notes: Quite a nice example for the style. Wonderful body, and a nice flavor (not outstanding though). Great malt body and although it is sweet, it isn't cloying or sticky or too sweet. Nice hints of hops. Esters are also nice and not overpowering (thankfully)."

"Easily the best offering from old man river. A nice tasty sessionable malty lager, something of a rarity these days."
"M - This is a nice, drinkable beer. Goes great with an avocado black-bean burger (yes, I know, kind of an untraditional pairing). The mouthfeel isn't as clean and refreshing as the lighter wheat beer counterparts, but it's not overpoweringly sticky like some stouts or porters may be. Good carbonation."
"Flavor is similarly sweet, nutty (almond or walnut), with a mild dry bitter aftertaste. Mild and easygoing, light bodied. A pint or three would be easy to session. This was good stuff, it's not everyday you get to try a Dunkel from Iowa."
"A yummy session lager. For those who like the style, or lagers in general, this place is a nice stop. Craft drinkers demanding all big beers all the time should probably head elsewhere."
"Whoa. This is a study in average. At best. Poured with a fine foamy off white head and no lace. Color is a medium to dark amber. Aroma is very mild with malt and a bare hint of roastiness. Flavor is super mild too. Body is ok, ditto carbonation. Finish is ok and forgetable."
