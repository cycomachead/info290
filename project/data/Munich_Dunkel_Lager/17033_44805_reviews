"O-a good beer"
"Just wanted to update my rating."
"-Taste: All very similar. Seemingly flat out of the sheet beer glass. tinge of bitter aftertaste"
""
"Poured a really dark brown body with reddish highlights, along with a frothy light tan head. The aroma is full of roasted malt. Tastes almost exclusively of roasted malt and not much else. Pretty boring honestly and feels kinda watery. Overall it was fairly disappointing, kind of surprising considering I have loved every other beer I have tried from this brewery and I typically love dark beers like black lagers, stouts, and porters"

"It was ok...just ok....had a little chocolate taste to it but a strange overall flavor.....overall just meh"
"Not a bad beer. Seems like it's not as aggressive as it looks. I'd have another"
"I felt this beer was oddly harsh"

"O: It's alright. Franconia started in a town about 15 miles from where I grew up, and now they brew full-time about 20 miles from my current home. Considering that it's available at just about any establishment with a decent selection near me, it's well above the average fare, but not quite good enough that I'd seek it out in particular."

"Overall: I'm not sure how to rate this. Is this a German coffee stout or what? Call it that, and I say I love it. It's not as thick and creamy as say a Mikkeler Black or their other's Coffee Stouts, so it'd be missing that for a great coffee stout. So, it's not a stout, but a coffee-dunkel lager? That would be a great beer. That I'd pay for and in fact, rate it a 4.3 of 5. But an ""Authenitic"" Dunkel, a 2 of 5. Again, I like this beer; it's just shitty marketing to gullible Texans, I don't like. Strange, eh? I'm really torn here. I need y'all's opinion here."
"This isn't a beer I buy in bottle form, for home drinking, but it's definitely one that, if it's available, makes a great companion to a variety of lunch and dinner meals, not just trad german. It goes great with highly spicy thai or indian."

"This dunkel brew is an acceptable example of the style, but notice how many times I used the word “light” in my descriptions? That is probably the main problem I have with this beer. The thin body and light character make it seem like a beer with potential that hasn’t been met. I did notice that the character is better if you pour two- thirds of the bottle into a glass, swirl the remainder, and then quickly dump it into the same glass. But the lightness still remains, and that may be enough to ruin the tasting for some. It certainly isn’t a bad beer, but it may not have enough body and flavor to satisfy the harshest critics among us."

"Solid beer, easy drinking, I'd get it again."

"Overall: I'd have another. For a fairly new brewery, not a bad beer."
"Presentation: Packaged in a plain twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"Summary - Was looking forward to this brew, since the brewery is in TX and I'm always looking for good local stuff. Unfortunately, this one's not real memorable. There's nothing wrong with it, it's just average. I wouldn't turn one down if someone offered. Warsteiner and Spaten make better Dunkels."

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Dark hue, tight foamy head, and lots of lacing. Nose is oaky, chocolaty, and roasty. Oaky malt with some licorice and grass components. Bitter and earthy. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."

"Had the Franconia dunkel on tap at the local Whole Foods. This is the first Franconia beer that I have tasted and I must admit that I was impressed. It was very smooth with lots of malty sweetness and a nice chocolate flavor that was pleasant and not overpowering. One of the better dunkels that I have had."

"O: Easy to drink and refreshing, not as heavy as some beers in this style. Nice flavors and a wonderful appearance. Would pair very nicely with Texas BBQ brisket."
""
"A very dark brown in appearance with a thin tan head. Smells lightly of toasted grain. Taste is initially sweet coffee flavor followed by a woody mellow finish. Decent mouthfeel, low carbonation. Overall an excellent dunkel, I would certainly get this again."
"It's my 2nd favorite beer at this Brewery."
""
"The beer pours a dark brownish-red color with a tan head. The aroma has a lot of toffee and caramel malts with a little bit of chocolate malt mixed in. The flavor is full of chocolate and darker malts with a little bit of smoke character also coming through. The beer is pretty sweet due to all of the malts. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Reviewed 4/2/2009 (Tap @ Flying Saucer, Houston, TeXas): Pours a very dark brown colored body, small tan-white head, diminishing. Somewhat coffee effervescent aroma. But very weak. Somehat watery taste, Strong ground coffee taste. Tastes like a coffee - beer. Somewhat carbonated. Some mlk chocolate notes. Nice chocolately aflertaste as it warms up."
"Stumbled upon this rare find in the highland park area of dallas. Ordered a pint immediately and was very pleased with all aspects of this local brew. Half inch foamy head and dark brown almost a stout in color. Smell was of fresh roasted coffee and molasses which was perfect on a cold day. Taste was great but reminded me of a coffee porter which was fine with me but forces my score down as it is not accurate to the style. Mouthfeel and drinkability were excellent which is why I ordered a second pint with excitement. Highly recommend my first sample from this brewery."
"The mouthfeel was medium bodied, perfect for the style."
"Tried this and a lager after the Franconia Brewery tour."
"Drink: The nearly too-light mouthfeel is redeemed by the drinkability of this brew. Flavorful and complex enough to appreciate slowly, but light and refreshing enough to quench your thirst. A uniquely special beer."
"Chocolate notes carry through to the flavor along with a definite grain sweetness, more so than perhaps any dunkel I have had. Decent amount of roast and the hops are very tame to say the least. Nice and fresh tasting brew, a bit more robust than many of the style. Plenty of flavor, body is certainly not thin...this is solid. There's some good German brews coming out of Franconia, this guy knows what he's doing."
"On tap at the brewery. Very interesting dunkel. Pours a nice looking dark brown with tan head. Aroma of dark roasted notes with hints of cocoa. Flavor is very much the same. Mouth feel is light-medium body with medium-high carbonation. Overall, a tasty brew!"
"Thin carbonation adds to an already smooth and milky feeling beer. This beer is full bodied and ready to rumble. Dunkel is borderline chewy and extremely satisfying. At the pub they told me it was seasonal which made me a little misty eyed. I could drink it year round."
"this brewery gets not enough respect out here. a wonderful german... for being in texas... and for well. most of america to boot. pour is dark coca cola color with a thin viscosity. nice head of off white tan. predominant nougat. nice apple crisp and even some mild grape english porter qualities. palate is very well balanced. grape, apple, maltose, chocolate and earthy but very light. a must if you're in the dallas area because this town runs a bit dry for the beer dweebs."
"I am not very familiar with the style, but this is a nice little beer."
"Just an average beer. No real character. Nothing more to say."
"D - There were some little things going on with this beer that didn't get me excited the flavor is a little bland and the body was pretty watery"
"Pours a very dark brown colored body, small tan-white head, diminishing. Somewhat coffee effervescent aroma. But very weak. Somehat watery taste, Strong ground coffee taste. Tastes like a coffee - beer. Somewhat carbonated. Some mlk chocolate notes. Nice chocolately aflertaste as it warms up."
"Pretty good. Fairly clean, soft lager-like palate: easy on the tongue, and interesting enough to ponder. It is fairly true to the BJCP Munich Dunkel style guidelines, but more importantly I like it and would definitely try another Franconia brew. Solidly Good."
