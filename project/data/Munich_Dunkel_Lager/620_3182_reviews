"Overall decent, would buy again but it didn't impress that much."

"A good example of this classic style."
"i really enjoyed this beer. its very drinkable, slight sweetness which suits it. drank straight from the bottle."
"Solid Munich lager. Lacking a little hit of dryness to clean it up but the sweetness doesn't really hurt."

"The Holzar Bier, which they described as an Export, was lacking. It wasn't horrible, and I've had really good Exports, but there were very few sweet Pils malt flavors and some bitterness up front, but overall, bland. It was from the Allgäu, in Bayern, so I expected more, I guess. The mouthfeel was wonderfully thick, which helped me give it a 3."

"500ml bottle from ""Grocery Outlet"" of all places! $4.01 Pours a slightly hazy amber colour with a small yet persistent cream coloured head. Very enjoyable malty,fruity aromas..really stands out for me. Taste is similar to the aroma but the creamy maltiness steals the show.Some small amount of grassy hop in the end. Very smooth and thick palate..easy going. I have to go against the grain on this i really like this and will be buying more. Excellent rainy weather beer."

"Overall 4.0: Dry, smooth and imminently sessionable, this beer would also be excellent with food. I could see myself downing more than one stein of this bad vogel next time I get the chance."

"Feels light, with a slight tannic kick in the back during the finish."

"Pours a clear golden brown, generous head that dissipates quickly. Malty aroma - this bottle had a mash smell to it, somewhat metallic (it traveled far so may have suffered a bit as a result). Taste is similar to many dunker lagers - surprisingly light and refreshing, with a slightly bitter aftertaste (and metallic with this bottle). Bready and malty in the background. A good example of the surprisingly light dunked beers that I have tasted from Germany."

"Very clean, medium bodied with faint carbonation. Rounded sweetness and creamy mouthfeel. Same flavors in the mouth that are on the nose but everything is subtle and proportionate. Finishes clean and crisp. Delivers clean malt taste without being over bearing and without lingering sweetness while remaining refreshing. Simple but good. Very refreshing actually."

"Poured from the flip top bottle into a 1/2 liter stein a deep rich bronze color with a fluffy crown atop that never completely subsided,a great pour with deep rich color.Alot of caramel mixed with toasted grain in the nose,the nose suggests alot of sweetness.A little thin in the feel but it is pretty smooth,sweet caramel with underlying chocolate malts,slightly toasted flavors in the finish,a tinge iron comes into play as well.Not bad but not much complexity to the beer,I think it would be nice to drink next to a fire on a cold Bavarian night though."
"Overall: Easy to drink but a bit on the sweet side for the style"
"M: The sensation is nice, refreshing, not bitter as should also not sweet with a medium ending not to pronounced but nice to the pallet."
"This poured a two finger off white head upon a deep copper body ebbing to a nice collar of fine foam. Little in the way of lacing. The scent is a clean soapy hops with white grapes and raisin with some malt backing. The taste follows the nose although it did not quite live up to the scent. Slightly sweet with some grain and noble hops. Light bodied with a well balanced bitterness, this is a clean crisp drinkable brew with a dry lingering finish. Nothing spectacular but definitely an enjoyable brew."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""

"D: A well-done Dunkel, exactingly to-style, that's flavourful and exceedingly drinkable. It isn't complex or inventive, but does something simple and orthodox so well that it's more than worthwhile."
"Overall this is a great Lager! Need I say more!"
"I am not at all experienced with German lagers but I am glad I had a chance to review this style. I got a three pack of bottles as a gift from my friend who went to Europe. Poured into a hefty glass mug. No head until I got nuts with the pour it vanished quickly but left a fancy ring around the mug. The color is very appetizing like a very dark tea. Smell is malt dominated with a heavy bread smell, very sweet. Taste is bready malt sweet burnt sugar and a pleasant very mild bitterness that's only mildly noticeable on the exhale. Well carbonated and thin in the mouth but yet feels like a heavier beer. Very meal like. Overall a good experience and I am looking forward to some more lagers of this sort. As an American I have been turned off to lagers but when you go back to their roots you realize a reintroduction is needed."
"D - Very nice drinkable beer. Nothing complex, but a good session beer."
"Drink - out of all of the Der Hirsch Brau beers I've tried so far; I think I enjoyed this one the most. Pretty flavourful and definitely sesionable."
"Pretty much all German lagers are engineered for easy drinking, Munich Dunkels are no exception. In that regard, this get's its job done. As far as being 'characterized by depth and complexity' as the guidelines call for, this leaves something to be desired. In other words, Holzar-Bier is good for drinking, not savoring. Buyers bare that in mind."
"Poured a clear burgundy/brown, with a lofty and dense off-white head. Sticky lace, moderate retention. Nose of light honey sweetness, nuts, woodiness and some fruit esters. Taste is similar, earthy and spicy hops here, something that I guess I perceive as a general 'woodiness.' Toffee malt as well. Good smooth mouthfeel, medium low carbonation. Nice drink."
"Pours a dark amber colour with a head that's actually a bit too thick at first, and then rather sneakily diminishes down to nothing. The lace, however, is quite mesmerizing. It slowly creeps down the glass, changing shape. A bit silly, but it's quite fascinating to watch. Bit of an earthy smell. Plenty of grains, and a touch of honey and molasses. Bit biscuity as well. Taste is essentially similar to smell, with some caramel and grassiness in the end. For some reason, this reminds me a little bit of honey oatmeal. I wonder, did they add oats to this beer? It does have a similar smoothness I come to expect from oatmeal stouts. Very creamy, smooth and light bodied. I like Dunkel lagers, and believe they make a great session beer. They may not have strong, bold flavours, but they have good flavours. I would drink this again. I would even seek this out again. Another beer from this brewery that did not disappoint."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, feels a little thin. Similar to their other beers in that they're solid and drinkable but just not exciting at all."
"D - Really high. Nice beer. Not overly complex in any way but it would be a great session beer."
"Overall a very gentle profile, crisp in character. Decent, but a little too much on the light side for me."
"Pics at: http://definitionale.com/2010/11/19/tasting-the-der-hirschbrau-holzar-bier/"
"D: Well definitely purchase more if available."
"Lighter-bodied with a slightly creamy mouthfeel, quite pleasant. Not too familiar with the style, but I found this one rather enjoyable."
"A rather ruddy shade of brown in colour. It's small off-white head is poorly retained and doesn't lace. Mild toasty aroma with subtle floral notes. Smells pretty nice, but its very restrained. The flavour is sweet and malty. Nice caramelized flavour with a little bit of bread crust and some spicy hop character behind it all. It may not be a very bold beer, but the flavour is there. Light bodied and finely carbonated, yet rich and smooth on the palate at the same time. It tastes fairly pleasant, but its really the mouthfeel that keeps you coming back for me. Decent."
"Got this as part of a 3 bottle pack from the Control Board in Ontario. Pours an amber-brown colour with thick white head, but without much lacing. Smells of sweet caramel with a very mild grassy hop presence. Flavour is quite sweet, almost no bitterness to balance it out. Smooth carbonation level. A nice enough lager, but would prefer a bit more bitterness to it."
"Light cola brown color. Light metallic nose. Sweet malty wort taste, but not thick. Quick fizzy head that disappears quickly. Pretty basic pretty delicious. Could be consumed in bulk - like a German session beer."
"RB calls this a Keller, which would makes sense, as there's some mustiness going on here. Regardless, still not much to it. Not impressed by this brewer overall."
"I expected it to lean sweet, per the style, but there's a honey-ish sweetness in this one that limits drinkability for me, though I did enjoy the bottle well-enough. A solid, sweet, dunkel lager, though nothing great - it does have some balance - might be better fresher (? - no freshness date)."
"D: Not particularly exciting, but a very tasty drinker. Mouthfeel and drinkability are strong suits, and this is a beer that adds up to more than its individual parts. Recommended to anyone who enjoys dark lagers."
"Not the best dunkel, nor the worst. Just a good example that's right in the middle of the pack. Still with so few making it to the US, this is definitely a good bet for anyone who likes the style and doesn't have the ability to fly to Bavaria every time they want one!"
"Got this at the local Brat maker. I've had it on other occasions, but threw the bottle away without even seeing who made the stuff. Had a darkish amber color with a finger (at most) of head after a pretty weak pour. I did get the hint of grape, but it was merely a hint. Mostly just a bready, honey sweetness. It just doesn't do much for me, but when the wife tries to bring home a new beer for me to try, I can't complain too much."
"Overall, nicely done. Especially I liked that that the flavour was not as sweet as the nose suggested."
"Roasted malt flavor with a lot of earthy hops of front and a lot of smooth caramel, toffee, hazelnut and chocolate notes. Surprisingly hoppy for a German beer with a good amount of bready yeast. Very drinkable without being watered down. Subtle clove spiciness and a refreshing champagne effervescence. Slightly dry finish."
"D - This is a tasty brew and I assume that my bottle wasn't really the best one so with a little imagination (and carbonation) this would be a worthy brew to enjoy."
"Serving type: bottle, 0.5 liter flip-top"
"D - Though I prefer the smokier Schwarzbeirs (very similar styles.... except Munich Dunkels are crisper and cleaner), this is a great brew to have when you need a good thirst quencher but also want something a little darker and malty than a spicy German Pils or hoppy pale ale. This is far from the best example of the style (which can be sorta boring anyway), but it ain't al bad."
"It pours a dark brown with only a mildly fizzy head of cola-like foam. Very nice color, with blends of dark brown and deep reds; I didn't expect this, as I hadn't yet determined the style of this beer. (I assumed this may be traditional Bavarian lager, simply because the label was so lightly colored.) Aromas of dark malts and sweet brown sugar, light air of dark ripe fruit, and bread dominate the nose. The flavor is certainly not too big; it's mainly of dark sweet flavors reminiscent of rich bread, turbinado sugar, and mild fruits. Overall, I'd describe the flavor and mouthfeel as lean, but that's true of most lagers. Very drinkable, but with enough complexity to make it interesting."
"Pleasingly whipped up froth of a head, thin yet aggressively popping bubbles all over. A moderately deep brown sits in the middle of the glass, further out yellow wins out over any orange hues. Presents a sweet and soft profile in the nose without any truly overt malt notes, you get pumpernickel bread, rye, dried molasses, green apple to pear to red cherry fruit, brazil and hazelnuts, overall it's stripped down to an indistinguishable, if still correct, core. In the mouth it's Medium-bodied with a good degree of fluidity that knows when to slow down given its lack of flash. The carbonation is crisp and feels more like a higher quantity of smaller pinpricks than foam. Caramel, brown sugar, molasses flavors appear sans true sweetness. The same pumpernickel to rye bread profile exists here, more bready and doughy than grainy. The mineral water element evokes a splash of lemon peel. It seems intent on pleasing in the most self-effacing manner possible, a beer to be consumed heartily by local men with big hands and messy plates of food. As if you can smell the beer stains permeating the walls and floors of the Biergärten."
"D: On the whole, this is a drinkable beer. It didn't blow me away by any means, but it's a well made beer."
"Not a bad MDA, although this one is a touch on the sweeter side. Recommended."
""
"Light to average body."
"The taste was pretty malty with a medium body and light bitterness. It had a semi dry finish with moderate carbonation in the brew. Overall it is an enjoyable beer. 3 or 4 on a hot day would be wonderful."
"D: This beer is very drinkable and would make a great session beer if I could get ahold of it more frequently. There is a slightly off metallic taste to it though, and that is a bit offsetting, but all in all a really tasty beer."
"While pouring this into a plain pint glass t had a light amount of white head. The smell is pretty plain with no real mouth watering aromas. The beer itself is very light but has a nice bitterness after every sip. All around a sold beer with a nice dark amber color. ."
"Creamy mouthfeel and damn near full bodied. A really like the maltiness of this one. Its not a caramel malt or roasted malt, but just a nice solid, I would assume Munich malt flavor. Very nice. Glad I picked this one up."
"Pours a clear dark amber. Nose is mild. Slight grainy edge. A touch of malts. A bit of sweetness to it. Flavor has a good body to it with a thick malt influence that provides a hearty experience. Feel is pretty good with a slightly lower than average amount of carbonation. Drinakble, sure. I can't classify this as a great beer though. Even if you pass on trying it, you might not really be missing out on much."
"A very malty beer this is, with some roasted notes. But at the same time, it misses the body and refinement I want from a fine dark lager. On the other hand It seems like this is the way a Munich Dunkels is supposed to be."
"I suppose this is the meat of this brewery's market, which is sorry; however this brew is average and makes for a decent session beer."
"Clear brown color with amber highlights, a thin foam ring, and barely existent top lace. Light malt aroma with a fruity floral hop layer, faint aromas overall. Really smooth, thickish, slightly oily mouthfeel. Deep roasted malts and burnt caramel, slight prune and raison, tart fruitiness from the hop bill with a bitter spiciness developing midway. Balanced well overall. Prune and charred sugar sweetness for a finish."
"Not a bad beer by any means, just not something I'd seek out again. Perhaps a beer best served on the warm side, on a cool fall or winter evening. I've had much better beers of this type, but this will do in a pinch."
"Pours out a dark brown color that reminds me of coke with a nice head that goes away fairly slow but leave no lacing at all and doesn't stick around until the bottom of the glass. smells of malts and caramel. taste is malty with a touch of bitterness that dances on the tongue. it lingers in your mouth for a little while before leaving you wanting more. I enjoy this beer and would have another one!"
"D - Pretty easy to quaff, light & creamy and not too sweet. I would drink this with peas and asparagus next time to see which it tastes more like. It might bring out some of the beers muted qualities as well."
"Pours a cola like brown color with a small off-white head, nothing special going on here. The smell is of roasted malt, has a raisin bread aroma to it. The taste is pretty flavorful, nice lightly roasted malt backbone, raisin breadiness, a good balance between the bitter and sweet. The feel is light and not as crisp as a lager should be. Quite a drinkable brew, goes down easy with no offensive flavors and good balance."
"Taste is malty, again with the sulfuric and husky taste. The dark, caramel malts give the beer a woody, marmelade and light husky taste. Also something that reminds me of wort and biscuit, even some chocolate. I guess these are the burned malts which give a maltbitter. Mouthfeel is good, dry and not sticky. Drinkability is almost perfect, roasty and dry, which make the beer go down very easily."
"The drinkability is very good. Great drinking style and a very fine version of it. Prosit. MK"
"D: Due to this, the drinkability would definitely make it easy to kick a few of these back, and could serve as an ""old standby"" kind of beer, but nothing too spectacular. Still, a fresh and refreshing German beer like this, brewed to the Reinheitsgebot, can be hard to turn a nose up at."
"This was actually a bit of a suprise with how good it was. Poured a deep dark brown with a huge billowing white head that settled down to reveal some subtle lacing that was quite nice. Smell was of caramel, grains, and breads, yeast primarily. Taste was typical brown lager. Some subtle spiceness, great all around flavor. Lots of earthy tones, with a ever so slight sweetness. Mostly malts on this one. This was a decent beer, extremely sessionable and a samn fine call. A corked bottle to makes it a nice treat!"
"Worth a try."
"500 mL swingtop, served in a pilsner glass. It pours a dark copper/mahogany with medium carbonation and a two-finger, almost creamy head that leaves nice lacing. The aroma is spicy/grassy, a little sweet, with caramel and perhaps some dark fruits. There are toasted/caramel malts on the palate, with green/spicy Noble hops that contribute grass/fresh hay and a bitterness that starts mild but increases slightly as I drink. The body is medium to full, with medium carbonation, and it leaves a light to medium finish. Overall a more-than-adequate dunkel that is fairly refreshing and definitely sessionable."
"M&D: the texture is clean and refreshingly fizzy, befitting for the balanced flavour profile and medium body. Overall, the beer shows a rather subtle flavour profile, more subtle than many other Munich Dunkel that Ive tried..."
"To dan sweet to be drinkable, had to pour it out. I've had this before & it was better, will try again if I'm sure its fresher. the dopplehirsch I bought from the same store was nice...caveat emptor.."
"This beer starts with a dark, red, transparent, pour into my glass. It contains golden highlights. It has a very small head which dissipates quickly leaving very little lacing. There is sweet, very unhoppy nose to this beer. I can gather some molasses, caramel and something that smells like brown sugar. There is nothing floral about it at all. The taste and mouthfeel was somewhat lackluster. It had a medium body with the taste of molasses really sitting on the tip of my tongue. Very little carbonation as was expected. It goes down very smooth because of this. A slight bitterness sneaks out during the swallow along with a metallic lager taste which doesn't effect the flavor, but is noticable. All in all i think this beer is pretty good, but not great. It is my first dunkel lager and i went into tasting this purely on my taste and not comparing it to the style. If you like octoberfest beers that are sweeter you will like this beer."
"Der Hirsch Holzar-Bier is the light Munich dunkel lager lover's Munich dunkel lager. If you have any interest in this style whatsover, I recommend at least one bottle since you'll be amazed at how far the brewers can back off and stay true to the style. As for me, I was unimpressed by this brewery's offerings before popping open the stopper on this one... and I'm equally unimpressed now. Nice labels and bottles, though."
"500 ml swing top bottle pours a clear amber color with a decent off white head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Fruity sweet aroma, nutty, caramel flavors. Medium bodied with a smooth, creamy mouthfeel, finishes sweet. Very tasty and drinkable, I would like another one."
"Aroma is toasty malts, hay and summer grass. Amber/brown in color with a fast fading white head. Flavor is sweet malts with a very low hop presence. Fruits and sweetbread flavors dominate from fore to finish. The sweetness tastes a little like molasses soaked pancakes after a while and it does indeed get old, but with the right food I could see this being very enjoyable."
"Nothing about this beer is harsh or extreme, save perhaps the sweetness. It's simply tasty, and I'll likely buy it again. Who knows, more beers like this and maybe the lager style will grow on me."
"Serviceable lager that is lesser known. Decent malty aroma, little head. Some hops, a pinch of roast. OK taste, with above average carbonation that works. In a word, caramel. More sweet than bitter, but balanced.Medium-light mouthfeel. Quaffable. Thanks Radek."
"500 ml swingtop bottle, bought in Bier Spezi Hamburg. Brown colour, large off-white head. Malty and fruity sweet aroma (raisins), some caramel and spices too. Pleasant flavour with vinous notes, hints of oak, malts are well balanced with the hops. I wont need wood cutting as an excuse to drink this beer. Very nice!"
"funny that I picked this up tonight, considering I was on my way home thinking ''I need to find a dunkel"". it was destiny."
"BB 25-01-06. Nice head and a darkbrown beercolour. Nose is malts, hops and alcohol harmonicly melted together and overal fresh and full malty. Good taste giving a full mouth of darkmaltcomponents with hint of roastmalz and nice and well dosed bitterness on this dunkel. Overal good brew with fine not too high carbonisation and plesant mouthfeel. Yes to me one to enjoy on a nice but quiet cold day after a morning working in the garden. Goes wonderfully with bread and cheese."
"Drinkability  I wont seek this one out again. Id like a dunkel to be more malty and pronounced in its flavor. I didnt find any of the understatement here to seem intentional."
"Initial taste is of moderately dark, sweet malt...very smooth. I rather enjoy the slight sweetness of this beer. It is sweet, but only just to the point of being almost sticky. After that some light hops come into play, but only slightly. Finishes with a little sweetness in the nasal passages and some light bitterness on the tongue."
"Overall, another good, though not really great, German beer. Further proof that the number of good beers in this world outnumbers all the mediocre swill."
"Pours a crystal clear ruby/brown with a finger head and very good lace. Aroma of a nice caramel malt with just hints of hops. Flavors of caramel and toffee with a hint of coffee and chocolate. Medium carbonation. Fairly well balanced, hop presence is not strong at all but the malt presence is not overwhelming either. Finishes crisp and dry and is very drinkable. A nice dunkle in a nice bottle."
"This was a pretty good beer. Strong hints of caramel and malt. Appearance was very nice to the eye. A perfect amber color. A nice head forms and has good retention. well done from the brewers. many years of practice has paid off in a wonderful beer!!!"
"A darkMahogany beer with a very small, off white, fast fading head.Crystall clear in the glass. Mild tones of roasted malt and a slight caramel flavor is present. Hops are noticed on the finish with a dry slightly bitter feel. Also a bit watery on the mouthfeel . Things did improve as the beer warmed up. More of the hops and caramel tones came out. Other than being a bit watery at first, a decent and enjoyable brew."
"Pouring a chestnut color with 2 inches of foamy white head dissipating without much cling to the glass. However, it leaves a distinct edge layer; maybe a slight haze as I look through the glass. Aroma is of brown malts with slight caramel tones and a slight grape accent; not much else going on here. Taste is dry oak flavors and brown malts with a yeasty finish. Slightly sweet caramels scattered throughout, but nothing exciting. Feel is medium body with not much carbonation at room temp besides a little tingle on the tongue on the initial sip. Maybe a drying alcohol on the finish as well. Overall, not a bad brew, but the bottle really makes this one in my opinion."
"Beer is good. Happy beering. 25/3.65"
"Pours a two-finger white head that fades quickly and leaves a little lace. Light-medium carbonation, light to medium bodied. Color is clear amber. Light malty nose. Starts sweet, finishes light with very little aftertaste. $2.95 for a 500ml bottle at Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"This is my favorite from this Bavarian brewery. One of the better Munich, dunkel lagers that I've sampled. I could drink a few of these every day, after work, or several during a session."
"A solid little beer that I'd never heard of before I picked it up. Quite enjoyable, and if this were around when I was drinking, I'd probably have it again."
"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is good. It has a light, yet malty scent that boasts of crystal malts and dry lager yeast; very sweet smelling. The taste is good. It has a light, malty flavor which is dominated with crystal malts. It goes down easy and refreshes. It leaves a sweet aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with a little less than adequate carbonation. This is a fine tasting Dunkel, but the mouthfeel and appearance suck. Add some carbonation, please."
"A very refreshing and drinkable drink."
"Drinkability & Notes: Other than lacking a good head retention this certainly an above average Dunkel Lager. Paired well with a couple of beer steamed bratwursts and cabbage."
"Top popped with a audible and visible ""pop"" of CO2, and a bit of beer entered the atmosphere, but no overflow of liquid, so we're good to go. Poured into an imperial pint glass, a 1/2 inch but short-lived head formed, and quickly the caramel covered liquid was left with nothing but a slight layer of bubbles for a cap. Excellent malt nose, and the malt flavors dominate the taste as well. I'm leaning towards caramel as the strongest flavor, but another of the mid-range malts could be in charge. I keep wanting to think this could be darker or heartier in the mouthfeel, but then I look at the ""dark lager"" category and guess that we're doing admirably."
"Medium feel. Very drinkable, I could drink it all day long."
"I must have gotten a good bottle or something, but this was an awesome brew! It was dark amber color that faded to a reddish-orange color. The head was white as snow and faded rather quickly, but the laceing stayed around for a while. The aroma was a fruity boquet or grapes and some citrus. The taste was quite similar, but more on the malty side, but that's something I like. Not only was it nice and refreshing, but it was something that I felt I could drink at anytime. This was an exciting brew and I reccommend it to anyone."
"It comes in a nifty 16.9oz porcelain-type pop-top lidded brown bottle. This one pours an interesting dark motor oil amber with a big bubbly, fast fading white head. The malt aroma gives way to a wet grassy scent. The biscuity malt is somewhat sweet and fairly herbal. A slightly metallic tang gives an edgy quality to the fruity apple taste. A light flavor of pineapple lingers in the distance. This is an easy drinking brew."
"Poured a clear rich copper hue under a thin off-white head that required a pretty violent pour to start, then settled quickly to film and collar. No lace. The nose is very mild, with just a hint of caramel. As the brew warmed, the caramel notes came out a bit stronger. The mouth is very prickly and medium-bodied. The taste is a bit harsh, not quite sour and definitely not sweet. It's not malty smooth, either, but there's some malt here. A touch of caramel comes out in the finish, and there's a bit of hops in the aftertaste. The main taste is, well, a bit more substantial than water, but somehow tough to define. The warmer it got, the better it got, however, with more caramel to enjoy. Still, not a great beer."
"Drinkability  Im using this for me beer-basted bratwurst. Its not good enough to stand alone."
"It pours a crystal clear mahogany body that's capped by a thin layer of creamy off-white foam. The head drops, but it maintains a creamy collar and leaves some thin lace. The aroma is fresh and clean with a delicately toasted and lightly caramelish malt, and a lightly mineral-like characteristic that fades as it warms. The body is light and crisp in the mouth with a very fine carbonation. The flavor delivers a combination of almost juicy, toasted malt and spicy hops. It's not really complicated, but it is most compelling! It finishes with a short, lingering note of sweetish malt and spice. Well-balanced, refreshing, and highly drinkable with enough character to keep it interesting throughout several servings. Certainly worth trying."

"Sometimes I am caught off guard. I did not expect this beer to be outstanding. I thought it would be a good, standard, German dunkel. To my surprise, it was more. Nice dark amber color with creamy off white head as well as roasted malt aromas appeared when I poured this into a 22 ounce glass. A very clean looking beer. Taste was wonderful- smooth and with a slight lager-like bitterness, but balanced out with slightly sweet hint of caramel. This is really a very silky beer and one that can be imbibed at any time."
"This is their ""Special Amber Lager."" Indeed it is unique among dunkels and amber lagers and doesn't quite fit in but is an individual, at least in my limited experience. Hardly any odor, dirty copper/amber color unlike I've seen, good juicy head. Basically a tasty clean lager with sweet roasty hints, malty & hearty, with pleasant cleansing taste. Mellow hops balance the malts to make a toffeeish, buttery brew with a chewy mouthfeel and a very good finish. There's actually not much to this beer; it's a bit empty-tasting especially for the price. However, it's nice enough and very drinkable. The Der Hirschbrau line of beers is brewed by Privatbrauerei Hoss."
"I'm not too sure where to put this beer style wise. It makes no style claims on the label and it is someplace inbetween and dunkel and amber lager. It REALLY needs to be surved at cellar temp, when cold it had a metalic taste. It had a medium but persistant head, clean lager feel and a light carmel malt sweetness."
