This stuff pours a mostly clear russet topped by a finger or so of wan foam. The nose comprises dry caramel, barley, and a strong twinge of flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, the barley and flowers dominating the proceedings in a jack-cheddar string cheese twist sort of way. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a decent enough dunkel, but just not really my cup o' tea.","TMoney2591","Jul 06, 2013"

The taste is surprisingly quite a deal less sweet. In fact, I'd say it was more grainy and with a firm but subdues malt background.

Theres a little alcohol in the aroma, along with a hint of yeast, but almost no hop presence. The taste is similar: sweet, toasty, and malty. The finish is pretty sweet, and the whole experience is certainly malt-centered. I think that the brew is a little more fruity than necessary, and isnt quite balanced.

A bit of a nutty and sour element in there as well. Flavors matched the aromas. Lots of residual sugars in here and the body seems a bit thin. Maybe this wasn't lagered long enough? Hops are weak in the background. There are some nice toasted almond flavors deep down. The slight sourness I got from the pils is more prevalent here. Finish is nice and clean and dries out any off flavors. A decent offering but nowhere near the level of this brewery's pils offering.","granger10","Jun 07, 2005"

I'm a malt fanatic, so what might not be enough for me may satisfy someone else. There is also a surprising but subtle hop bite at the end with a nice warming alcohol feeling.
