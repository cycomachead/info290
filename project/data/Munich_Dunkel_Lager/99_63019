Medium body and level of carbonation with a slick sweet mouthfeel. I find it a bit of a stretch to call this a dunkel, but I guess it is a darker lager.

Perhaps a little too sweet for my liking, it lacked balance and overall just made me feel like the yeast never fully got around to doing their job in drying this out yet more noticeable alcohol in this style would not be welcomed.

It didn't produce much head, and like others have mentioned, the carbonation was somewhat fizzy like a soft drink. All in all this is one I will go back to again and recommend to many friends and family whom like beer.

The mahogany-copper pour ends with a decent head and little pearl drops of non-stop slow upward bound carbination bubbles.

4,16.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a dark copper hue with a thick white head that recedes to about a half inch and hangs around nicely. Aromas of sweet caramel, grains and a huge malt presence are noticeable. The taste consists of bold, malty and sweet notes, with a touch of hoppiness. A bit of ripened fruit makes it's way to the taste buds as well, with definite characteristics of dates and prunes. Overall, the medium-heavy body and moderate carbonation blend together nicely with this malt forward brew. Another solid beer from Saranac.","jsdunlop","Dec 05, 2010"
2.81,-18.3,3,2,3,3.5,3,"d - Wasn't a huge fan of this one. It wasn't that bad, but nothing really stood out about it to me. Not Saranac's best beer; wouldn't seek out again.","mdfb79","Dec 04, 2010"
3.85,11.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Gotta love the annual 12 beers of Xmas pack, it seems like as a whole they have put some well hopped beers into the mix. Only two new offerings this year, this Lake Effect Lager seems to be a nice German style dunkel lager at first glance. Appears a dark caramel amber bodied with a nice off white tan colored head forming thick fine bubbled head. Evenly strung thick chunky lacing, very nice look going on poured into my 1/2 liter Sam Adams krug style glass. Aromatics offer up dark roasted malt, slightly nutty touch of caramel. No overt sweetness, subtle bready German malts with Hallertau herbal spicy leafy toned hops coming in as well. Flavors work well together combining a semi dry roasted malt quality hints of caramel and nut with earthy/herbal/spicy hop accents a beautiful mix of true German style brewing. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied sturdily carbonated as the style typically prescribes to. Wonderful semi dry finish not a sweet or hoppy beer just a beautifully balanced dunkel lager. Drinkability overall is pretty nice no problem drinking a couple bottles of this stuff, wish I had another mixed 12 pack to top off the glass I'm drinking.","WVbeergeek","Nov 27, 2010"
3.28,-4.7,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Decent beer, but the sweetness could be tempered by a heartier level of bitterness. In the end, caramel is just way to prevalent.","BradLikesBrew","Nov 26, 2010"
3.16,-8.1,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Saranac Lake Effect Lager is a very clear blown beer with a dense light khaki head that fades to a film and leaves excellent lacing. It has a sweet aroma, like malt extract. It's medium-light bodied and crisp with a slightly watery finish. It's slightly sweet and very lightly bittered. It's a light, simple flavor and the bitterness comes out more at the finish. It's not a very noteworthy beer, but it's quite drinkable.","yesyouam","Nov 23, 2010"
3.78,9.9,4,3.5,4,3,4,"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of malts, a bit sweet. Taste is like the smell, plenty of malts, a light hopping, considerable sweetness. Feels light in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall this is a very good beer.","tone77","Nov 21, 2010"
3.71,7.8,4,3,4,3.5,4,"Overall - Saranac has offered a great full bodied some what ""darker"" lager. Definately worth a try.","Justin23060","Nov 20, 2010"
3.77,9.6,3.5,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Pours a deep brown color, nice head to it. Nice malty aroma to his one. Taste is medium bodied, some great breadiness to it, a touch of caramel, some nice malty taste. Very smooth, easy to drink beer with some decent taste to it. Definitely one of the better beers in the sampler pack; a lot of people hate on Saranac but this is for sure an above average beer that I would never turn down, solid brew!","oriolesfan4","Nov 17, 2010"
3.65,6.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12oz bottle. One of the beers from the 12 Beers of Winter mix pack. Pours a rich copper color with a thin head. Small amount of lacing. Aromas of molasses, earthiness, and malts. Taste is similar to the smell. Nice blend of malts with sweetness. A bit of caramel too. This is one of the 2 new styles by Saranac in the winter mix 12 and is a decent offering.","PicoPapa","Nov 13, 2010"
4.13,20.1,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"D- Another drinkable beer from Saranac. Not to be bias... I just feel these are great are all great gateway brews to craft. Lake Effect can be drank very smoothly all winter long","lovindahops","Nov 13, 2010"

3.6,4.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The beer pours a translucent brown color with a thick frothy tan head that quickly fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a sweet caramel malt scent along with a dry lager yeast aroma. It's full of fruity yeast esters which compliments the caramel malts. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an easy drinking beer. It's not overly complex, but it's full of malt flavor;a solid seasonal.","WesWes","Nov 05, 2010"
3.23,-6.1,3.5,3,3,4,3.5,"D - Goes down easy and is rather refreshing. Slightly warming and a nice cold-weather beer, just nothing particularly special.","greenmonstah","Nov 03, 2010"
3.56,3.5,4,3,3.5,4,4,"If you like a lager with a bit of character, this one is worth trying.","Ineedaride","Nov 02, 2010"
3.32,-3.5,3,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Better for a cold evening in the Northeast than a barely cool evening here in SoCal, and a bit short on malty complexity, but it's a clean, well-brewed, and moderately satisfying lager.","errantnight","Oct 30, 2010"
