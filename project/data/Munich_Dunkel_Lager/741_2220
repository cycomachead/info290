Almost a root beer like flavor, but without the carbonation, which is contrary to all the bubbles I see. Chocolate, honey, malt. All this yet it sits lightly, and not weighty like a doppelbock might. It would be easy to tip back a few of these. Easy drinking solid dark lager.","workingclassbrew","Mar 05, 2014"

Even if it is just straightforward stuff, the slight sweetness and the carbonation are big pluses for me. Feels extra pleasant in the mouth, and after, no sting. If that's what you like, you'll get it here. Any beer that is perfectly pleasant to drink gets high points from me.

A dusting of coffee lurks in the distance, but doesn't seem to pose much of a threat to the other elements. The taste rounds the nasal elements out a bit, bringing in some mild cocoa and light grass to the dark wheat/light roast party.

Herbal tea leaf notes in the finish with an air of smokiness, complex light beer...I like it. Flavor has a fruit sweetness under the light coffee and roasted milk chocolate layers, along with more of a slightly lactic mineral quality that just works in a dunkel. Hell this is better than Hofbrauhaus Pittsurgh's dunkel. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied really a dry roasty finish going with tartness lingering on the sides of my palate.

As I poured the beer into my pint glass, I could already smell very strong notes of coffee and heavy barley malts. The beer poured out into a nice deep chestnut mahogany color with a creamy off-white head. The head dissipated rather quickly, after a minute or so, leaving a wispy film on the top of the beer. The beer smelled of toasted barley, coffee, rich chocolate malts; comparable to the scent of a freshly baked loaf of wholegrain bread. The first drink had a nice balance of strong bittering hops, roasted malts, and coffee. After a few drinks, I noticed that the beer became a little acidic, but the acidity subsided further down the glass. All in all, the brew was a very smooth elixir of toasted grain, roasted malts, mixed nuts and freshly baked dark bread. The tastes reflect the nose perfectly. The beer is highly carbonated and stays that way through the whole glass. The most notable feature of this brew was the surprisingly smooth aftertaste. Usually dark lagers have a strong bitter aftertaste; this one was surprisingly sweet. This beer is fairly drinkable, but is rather filling. In all, this is a very good beer to sit back and enjoy.","KingNoonan","Aug 12, 2006"

Theres a tangy, sour quality to the nose which might lead one to think of an infected yeast strain, but Ive tasted this beer on a number of occasions and this quality has remained consistent. Sweet and tangy on the first sip, the tanginess coming from a collusion of malt and hops. Smooth on the palate, and the sweet / tangy interplay makes this beer seem a bit light but ultimately quite refreshing (the taste may seem a bit light / thin from the way it pours and looks, but its on-style.) Mild hop bitterness throughout is tempered by a floral quality present about midway through the palate. Nice roasted dark malt notes in here.

3.87,6,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"One of the best Stateside interpretations of the style I've ever had. Bravo. Pours out to a light brown amber color with a short lived head of foam that drifts away quite fast. Lower carbonation, and lace is absent. Aromas of roasted medium bodied malts, wood notes, saturated grains, some notes of sweet dark fruits. Nice. Taste is full bodied and has a good amount of complexity and depth. Toasty malt, wet grain and cereal, earthy woody notes, a touch of buttery toast. Sweet fired sugar cane finishs off this delectable beer. Mouthfeel is on the thicker side, but still quaffable. A good level of drinkability. Worth trying.","Frozensoul327","Feb 24, 2006"
4.22,15.6,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"This brew pours a dark brownish-black color. The head is one finger in height and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma shouts of caramel, but there is also roasted malt and butter. The tase is very relaxing. Caramel tries to dominate but is cut through by roasted malt and chocolate. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, this is a very good brew. I will certainly keep an eye out for this one.","KarlHungus","Jan 08, 2006"
2.13,-41.6,3.5,3,1.5,3,1.5,"This beer pours a reddish brown with decent head from a twelve ounce brown bottle. Smells a bit malty. The first sip was a nice roasted malt flavor. Unfortunately, things went down hill from here. The second and subsequent sips had an unpleasant sour taste that predominated. I shared this beer with a friend, who had to pour his out (he supplied the beer, and told me before we drank it that he didn't like it, but didn't say why, but he wanted my opinion). I was able to finish the half bottle I had, but it was not good. Apparently, the problem was not just with this bottle per my friend. I'm not sure if this was a bad batch or if it wasn't handled well after brewing, or if this is just how it is supposed to taste. Based on what I had, I can't recommend this.","Drew966","Jan 02, 2006"

3.97,8.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"D-This is a nice dark lager. It has good complexity yet subtle and the grain really comes through. The smooth lagering really makes this drinkable. It would be nice to see a bit more hops but this is a good solid beer.","rhoadsrage","Dec 23, 2005"

3.7,1.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a dark clear brown with a decent off white head and carbonation (although the head receded very quickly). The nose is all sweet toffee with just a touch of fruit on the finish (possibly dates). The flavor is sweet toffee, caramel and figs. No hop character at all. Reasonably smooth mouth feel, OK drinkability. If a dark lager is your style, this is an OK beer. Not my cup of tea though.","carln26","Nov 03, 2005"

3.22,-11.8,4.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Had this on tap at the Red Rock Cafe on Oakland. Looked very nice, dark with a substantial brownish-white head. Nice lacing. Smelled okay initially, a mixture of banana-y esters, buttery diacetyl, and some olives/prunes. As it warmed, though, the smell quickly went downhill, taking on the nose of a giant olive. The taste, thankfully, was not nearly as bad, a little olivey but pretty light and smooth, with just a little bit of a bitter, hoppy finish. Mouthfeel was okay, but the beer was just served too warm, I think. Drink it cold.","battlekow","May 10, 2005"

The flavor came across as very watered down, but there was a little bit of chocolate and some grean Christmasy seasonal tones. The mouthfeel was flat and very dissapointing. Not something I would choose again because it is overall quite lifeless on the tongue.","MuddyFeet","Feb 15, 2005"

If I were rating this as a dark lager, it would score horribly, but hey, it's a good beer, so I'll score it as it's own entity. I'm sure that this probably a very good dark lager, as the aroma was great for a style I generally abhor.","Mitchster","Jan 27, 2005"

3.55,-2.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Part of a monthly Beer of the Month Club selecetion. Not one of my favorite styles but still giving it a chance. Pours a very nice glass with a foamy head with lacing that sticks to the glass. Looks almost like root beer. Warmer serving temperature really extracts the floral aromas. Creamy frothiness does not really excite the mouth. Can drink one a night at most.","Backer2004","Dec 01, 2004"
3.9,6.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"This beer pours a dark brown color with nice ruby hues coming around the edges. The nose is toasted sesame seeds to me. The flavor is not bad at all. The lager flavors I dislike are not very prevalent in this. There is a somewhat burtn caramel sweetness in there, along with a nice roasted character. Not a bad beer. The feel is fairly thin. I would like a touch more thickness. Drinkability is not bad either. The beer is more than the sum of its parts. I like it for a lager.","kmpitz2","Nov 22, 2004"
3.52,-3.6,3,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Clear, dark brown with obvious ruby influences. Shiny yet dull as there wasnt much animation. The head was very skimpy, it only reached a sixteenth of an inch in height (give or take) before quickly disappearing, aside from a thin collar. There wasnt any subsequent lacing either. On a whole the appearance is boring, the color is nice enough but everything else... yawn. The nose is pleasantly roasty with coffee beans, chocolate, and charcoal with just a trace of earthy sweetness. The nose is very inviting, the roast doesnt remind me of a Dunkel but more of a Brown Ale. I like that. The potency is modest but the bouquet is very clean, straightforward and articulate. I like that too. The palate is just a nice as the nose. It is also dead-on as it tastes just like it smells. The only difference is the sweetness is a tickle louder than I was expecting. The roast is the show though, coffee with a kiss of milk, chocolate, and charred wood. There is a tickle of earthiness. Hops dont do much. This is a sweet beer that is balanced by the roast. I like it. Too bad it is not a little more complex or louder. Still Im digging it. I could drink this everyday. The roast reminds me a lot of Empyrean Third Stone Brown and, IMO, that is a good thing. I have no complaints with the palate. It is very likable, easy to drink, and I bet this would go nicely with many grilled meats & veggies, stews, chili, and cheese. My only beef with this beer is mouthfeel, the carbonation is too low (like every Lakefront beer Ive quaffed), it is also a little thin, a little slick and a little sticky. All those littles add up to a problem. This aspect of the beer could me much improved. Extremely drinkable, the abv seems low too (session beer material). Id kick back and quaff a few more any day of the week. It was purchased as part of a sampler-pack in Milwaukee, WI.","bditty187","Sep 23, 2004"

3.97,8.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Clear mahogany color with amber highlights. Sturdy head, pale yellow and settles at under 1/2 an inch in height. Dripping ring lace. Touch of burnt rasin bread crust to the aroma, muted but good. Very roasty flavor, cozy like morning toast with some elements of faint semi-sweet chocolate. Mouthfeel is light but works well with a good texture and the flavors. Finishes with a good and subtle transition to bare hay-like hopping, nothing jarring to the overall impression. This was a winner for me, very nice drinking and good for the style and expectations.","ADR","Oct 30, 2003"
