The beer has massive caramel qualities and flavors that dominate the tongue. The beer has a nice dark fruit presence as well. There is a dark grain presence in this beer that is again, all toffee and caramel. The feel of this beer is velvety smooth and quite creamy. There is a slight tart fruit flavor in this beer as well.

Head lasted only a few minutes before leaving some lacings that clung to the sides. Reasonable amount of carbonation rose from the bottom in no particular pattern. Aroma was very slightly sweet, that shifted to a subtle malty grain. Flavor reminded me a slightly spicy/peppery wheat bread. Felt a tad thin and bubbly in the mouth. Overall not a bad beer.

3.62,0,3,3.5,4,3,3.5,"affordable big bottle at old chicago on colorado boulevard. pours a very watered down looking light to medium brown color with a tan head comprised of huge bubbles, but they burst and retreat immediately. the glass may have been a little soapy still, so somebody comfirm this appearance. smells like chocolate malts and a bit of doughnuty sweet malt. flavor is the best asset, as it should be, with plenty of roasty and milk chocolately malt heft. no hops in here to speak of, and a quickly fading aftertaste. feel is on the weak side, light to medium body and fair carbonation. more body would do wonders for this beer. overall i liked this, unique flavor profile for a german beer, and its organic, so plus for that, but a bit more depth of feel could bring it up in my book.","StonedTrippin","May 07, 2012"

4.18,15.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall: It's generally fairly basic, but with an emphasis on malt flavor and a bit of sweetness, yet it's never cloying. It's maltiness is kind of like that of a bock, but less full, and not as 'dark'... think of it as a standard Munich dunkel but amped up a bit. It's really quite nice. It's remarkably drinkable, and it seems to go quite well with food. After tasting the initial bottle I had another one with a fresh, light pasta sauce made ingredients from my garden (tomato, onion, garlic, some green pepper, and basil/thyme/oregano) and olive oil, salt/pepper, and Pecorino Romano cheese and it was a splendid match - I have no doubt that it would be brilliant with pizza. Well worth trying!","NeroFiddled","Sep 30, 2011"

3.33,-8,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Opinion: Like the Altbier, this beer is all over the place. It still has the elements of a German beer, so it isn't completely off the mark...at least it is in the right country, but the beer is pretty far off for the style. This one isn't as far off as the Alt, but it, like it's brother, has too much of some qualities and not enough of others to make it stand up to the classics in the styles. Again, this beer is better overall than the Alt IMO, and comes closer to the style, but it just isn't the best representation I have found.","SkeeterHawk","Apr 14, 2011"

Nice touch of dark fruit roasted malts nothing too overbearing still very German in nature. Apples/raisins with hints of malted barley and grassy hops. Flavor has juicy caramel malts/hints of raisin and apple juiciness. Overall nice flavor going on I can't really get enough of the Pinkus offerings, their simple but yet really flavorful. Burp noble hops as you sip, enjoy the light crisp body with natural carbonation levels. Drinkability is awesome one of the best dark lagers I've come across recently.","WVbeergeek","Jan 17, 2011"

In the taste, starts caramel like and ends with a fruitiness of white grapes, but make no mistake, it is a lager all the way through. A somewhat of a lager bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry fruitiness and lager notes in the aftertaste. A clean lager and nice fruit notes.","OWSLEY069","Dec 15, 2010"

3.73,3,3.5,3,4,4,4,"This beer pours a dark copper with a thin eggshell head that provides sticky lacing. There is a slight haze as well. Carbonation is fine, and produces tiny bubbles. Aromas are almost non-existant. Faint hints of biscuit and caramel are all I get. Taste is more. Caramel and toast, and some cereal grains, along with some fruity traits. Hops give the beer a dry clean finish. Medium bodied, yet this brew is not filling. A good brew, and a very easy drinking brew, I might add.","WYVYRN527","Sep 17, 2010"

Toasty malt and cocoa with a mild floral hop bitterness in the finish. The flavor of the beer is pleasant enough, but it's a little underwhelming. Light bodied and slightly creamy with palate scrubbing carbonation. A little more body and depth of flavor would really help me like this beer more.

The taste starts off with some caramel sweetness that gives way to some nuttiness and a tiny bit of hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some moderate carbonation. This is a tasty beer that while it isn't anything that's going to blow your mind, is still worth grabbing if you see a bottle.","TheTrevor","Feb 22, 2009"

3.06,-15.5,4,3,3,3,3,"The aroma is sweet and somewhat sour with grain, hay, grass, and herbs. The appearance is deep amber with an average head. The flavor is like the aroma with a cereal finish. The palate is thin but OK. Overall its a quality beer but I am just not into it. It reminds me of an Oktoberfest beer.","nick76","Jan 11, 2009"
3.75,3.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Reddish brown body, high clarity, looks like sun tea. Soft edges with fine lacing. One finger of foam that fades into a skim after a couple minutes. Aroma was a little funky after the first pour, but seems to open up a little after that. Bready with mild caramel, wood, and tobacco notes. More of the same in the taste, light and somewhat dry in the woodsy finish. It's not overly sweet like some MDL's, more like an imperial Maerzen or something. Body feels more moderate thanks to the carbonation. Overall easy to drink, sort of hearty, halfway to a doppelbock. Clean and fairly tasty.","emerge077","Jan 06, 2009"
3.34,-7.7,4,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,"There is just enough complexity here that I could drink a few before getting bored of it. It is light and smooth enough to be sessionable but the alcohol starts to peek through a bit too much, especially since it is only 5.5%","Morbo","Dec 02, 2008"
3.68,1.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Organic Pinkus Jubilate Special Reserve Dark Lager pours a dark brown color with a white head from a brown half liter bottle. The aroma is quite mild, a bit malty perhaps. The flavor is also malty. Very drinkable, relatively light body (as appropriate for the style).","Drew966","Nov 26, 2008"
4.12,13.8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"It's also worth mentioning, that my label looks nothing like the one pictured. The label on my bottle is white with gold text and says, ""Pinkus Jubilate Special Reserve Dark Lager"".","SilentSabre","Sep 30, 2008"

3,-17.1,3,3,3,3,3,"Nice deep garnet, the head modest in size, frothy and the lace is quite decent. Nose is that earthy organic malt, slightly sweet, hints of caramel. Front is malt, the top slender in feel, the finish minimally acidic, the hops sparse in presence and bite, dry aftertaste, and a bit of a disappointment to me as I expected a bit more Â“RobustnessÂ” and body, average is the best I can do.","Gusler","Jan 03, 2003"
