3.65,0,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O - Overall this is a decent session beer, but more of a dark American lager than a Munich Dunkel. It lacks some richness and malt complexity of the Munich style, while seems to fit perfectly within the Dark American.","scoobybrew","Jul 03, 2011"

3.7,1.4,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Mouthfeel is creamy, slick and bordering on watery, with light carbonation, a light body and an overall lightness that’s just a tad bit too bitter to consider crisp. This is a gem for any malty beer fans out there, and even though it went down easy it would not be a session beer for me. A good beer overall, and true to its style, just not the type of beer I would have all night.","CHickman","0"

3.54,-3,4.5,3,4,3.5,3,"It pours out a dark brown with a surprising amount of head for a dark beer. As the beer settles, there is little to no lacing. The smell is a hint of barley with a roasted malt, not a strong smell. The taste is moslty roasted malt, with not much added complexity, perhaps a bit of barley. This beer seems like it has a lot of potential at first sip, but the lack of complexity and flavor, are a bit disappointing. The mouthfeel is very watery for a dark beer. surprisingly not substantial and thin feeling in my mouth. While this beer is not that thick and isn't exactly an assualt on the palate, I still couldn't see myself drinking many, as it is super filling and sits heavily with you.","pdoran10","Dec 05, 2009"
3.36,-7.9,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Fairly average all the way around. Poured a nice, deep, dark brown like furniture stain. Dark, sweet malts dominate the smell with little else in there. Flavour is sweet malts with some earthy, European style hop bittnerss toward the end. Very easy drinking beer. A nice example of a style I enjoy.","SilentSabre","Nov 19, 2009"
4.08,11.8,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Gosser has plenty of drinkability. It has a creamy mouth feel that still manages to be light. There is a finish, however, it is not long, rather, it lingers. More than one of this beer can be consumed in one sitting (with pleasure). It would be an excellent fall beer, but, can be enjoyed at any time.","ianjsullivan","Oct 02, 2009"

2.74,-24.9,4,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Drinkability: Well, it's no Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel, that much is certain. I've never been sure (or interested enough to find out) how to pronounce Gösser, but it always makes me think of Gozer the Gozerian from the movie Ghosterbusters. The beer is somewhat metallic which always gets an instant red card from me, so I cannot recommend it in good faith. However, I will instead cheerfully recommend Ghostbusters!","ChainGangGuy","Jun 25, 2009"
3.7,1.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall impression: A nice, sessionable, dark lager. A recommended for those seeking this style or if you get one in a mixed pack of imports.","RobH","Jun 12, 2009"
4.28,17.3,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a clear, dark amber color with lighter amber along the bottom and edges of the glass. One and one half inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of roasted malt, yeast, pale malt, and hops. Fits the style of a Munich Dunkel Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a low carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, pale malt, hops, yeast, and a general sweetness in the finish (fruit?). Overall, a really good beer - by far the best Munich Dunkel I've ever had. Really smooth, good body, great blend, and easy drinkability! I highly recommend this brew.","Tone","Jan 26, 2009"

3.8,4.1,4,4,3.5,4,4,"From a Beers of the World pack. Pours dark brown with a modest head and good amount of lacings. Aroma is caramel malts. Taste is sweet dark malts and just enough hops for the style. A slight taste of chocolate to go with the caramel. Light bodied, and quite sessionable. Would be a very good dessert beer without being very filling.","Spikester","Apr 04, 2007"
3.77,3.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours a rich brown color topped by a half-finger of creamy tan head. Sweet aroma of roasted malt, with notes of mocha and maybe some hazelnut. Palate is mainly smooth, sweet roasted malt, with a touch of fruitiness added by the hops. Body is nice and velvety smooth. Surprisingly tasty. I should check out more examples of this style.","ElGordo","Dec 15, 2006"
3.91,7.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"When I bought this beer, I really didn't think that I was going to like it. Little did I know that it is a solid brew. The beer opens up with a dark, but clear brown with ruby highlights and an unexpectly dense foam stand that showed great staying power during the session. Aromas of faint toasted barley, underlying sweetness, and an earthy / peat-et hints soon followed. Flavors of light confectionate sugar emerged first, but eventually balanced by a pronounced, yet soft, toasted / roasted flavor that gains intensity into the finish. Peat moss and earthy hops continued to add complexity and richness as well. The beer remained softly textured and very smooth throughout with no astingency or grainy flavors. Finihses with a fleeting sweetness, leaving only a hint of toast and hop bitterness left on the toung. Though not outstanding, the brew is solid.","BEERchitect","Nov 07, 2006"
3.79,3.8,3.5,4.5,3.5,3,4,"Pours a dark but clear amber brown color with light tan creamy head that takes a while to fade. Smells of roasted malt, a little chocolatey. You can taste the roast malt with some coffee and chocolate in there. A tiny bit of hop flavor on the back end. Mouthfeel is heavy and a little creamy, with a little fizz at the end. It actually finishes fairly dry. All in all, a very drinkable beer. I'll be getting this again.","Kulrak","Oct 30, 2006"

3.8,4.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours the color of color and just as clear, with a thin head that leaves lacing on my glass. Aromas are of roasted malts, typical of a Munich dunkel lager, but not as rich as some Bavarian examples. On the tongue, this first thing to come out is some light sweetness tinged with sourness, followed by drier roasted malt notes, with that light sourness coming back on the finish. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side, with brisk carbonation that hits especially had on the mid-palate. Overall, this is a good dunkel lager. Not the best, not terribly complex, but decent and drinkable.","geexploitation","0"

3.08,-15.6,4.5,4,2.5,2.5,3,"Beautiful color, like dark stained mahogany with ruby. Not much head to speak of, but a bit of lacing. Smell: smoke, malt, a bit of pumpkin or sweet potato? Not very heavy taste. Kind of dull, which I find often typical of the style. Lazy malt, no hops except for a slight bittering, some sweatsock flavor, not much character really. Disappointing mouthfeel too - sharp, small bubble that quickly foams in your mouth, robbing you of the beer's flavor. Drinkability is ok if you enjoy the taste, which is tolerable.","benmiliron","Dec 28, 2005"
4.35,19.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This beer poured a crystal clear dark amber that looked a bit like maple syrup. The head poured about a half cm. of light tan. Smelled of smoky molasses and caramel with a sweet peach and apple fruitiness beneath. Tasted of very dark fruits with a plumb crispness followed by a raisin and prune sweetness. Finished dry with a sweet and sour crispness. Mouth feel was medium bodied with a light and tingly carbonation.","DarkerTheBetter","Dec 17, 2005"

4.1,12.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This is a simple, clean, no-nonsense hearty dark lager. I found it to be a just tad roasty-toasty, with a malty-rich mouth-filling fullness that was quite enjoyable. It comes off like a good bock with that kind of grain profile, but just a little drier and toastier. I have not seen it in very many places, either stores or restaurants, shich is a bit of a shame. Also, it can be a little on the pricey side. It's worth a try anyway...I'd like to try it in Austria.","ctdfalconer","May 13, 2005"
3.45,-5.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall: I easily preferred the Gösser Dark from the standard offering which I tried earlier. A drinkable dark brew that is not too heavy on the palate.

4.2,15.1,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Seems like being an obscure green-bottled Austrian beer will automatically knock a good half point off a BA rating. Filtered espresso describes the sight and odor senses in the company of a pinch of chocolate shavings and raisins. A silky wash across the buds transports an herbed and fruitwood plank roasted grass clipping smoothie as drunk from old tin. I could drink a few.","inebrius","Oct 05, 2004"
3.55,-2.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"I actually enjoyed this beer. A good, malty dunkel altogether. Not really complex but would make for a good beer with a steak and potato.

3.63,-0.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Light bodied and sparkling in the mouth similar to a pils. Though, at times, this seems a bit washed-out and dilute, flavor-wise. This isn't particularly memorable, but it is quaffable en masse.","cokes","Oct 30, 2003"
3.55,-2.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"I had this on tap in two different bars in the western Ural city of Perm, in the heart of Russia. It came out a deep clear ruby red under a two finger beig head wiht nice retention and excellent lace. The nose was pleasantly strong, full of malt and caramel. The mouth was prickly and medium-bodied, with caramel sweetness. The taste is mild and mainly caramel, wiht a touch of hops in the finish. The aftertaste is sweet. This was a good dunkel, utterly quaffable.","Globetrotter","Aug 11, 2003"

3.25,-11,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Dark burgundy brown, rich, creamy, aromatic, tan head. Sweet notes of chocolate, raisins, plums, slightly roasty, toasty, nutty. Sharply metallic on the palate at first, with sweetness coming up from behind, like the caramel coating on a candy bar. Short, but sweet finish. Medium body. Just enough to grant some substance. One of the best lagers I've had lately.","feloniousmonk","May 19, 2002"

Light body, flavor is ""front-loaded"" and in the hazelnut range in taste.  Finishes light with a honey impression.  Certainly not a lot of hops going on.  Flavor is nice but this beer is a little sweet and fleeting in impression for me.","ADR","Beers"
