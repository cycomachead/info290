"Not bad.  Not my kind of style beer but a pretty good lager.  It gee on me and went for a 2nd one."
"3.36/5: Now, if only I had some tacos to drink this with..."
"I thought this was an 8 pack beer."
""
"Pours brown from the bottle with a hint of red. A little bit of a mocha head that leaves after a bit. The aroma is fairly straightforward: bready malts, some toffee and molasses. It tastes exactly like it smells - brown bread, molasses with just a hint of sweetness. Medium mouth. This tastes exactly like a dunkel should taste. It's well-made and very enjoyable."
""
""
"Nice roasty, semi-sweet smell with a kiss of bitterness. Medium body with a dark delicious taste. Medium bodied and smooth with pleasant effervesence."

"O - A nice local Dark Dunkel that is well made and pleasant to drink."

"The taste brings out a more sweeter dark malt character than the noses suggests.  Very thin bitterness.  Maybe the age of this bottle tainted my review,"

"Pours a medium to dark brown color with good clarity. Slight off white head forms and has good retention. Nutty aroma with hints of bread and cocoa. Just a whiff of herbal hops. The taste has more nutty and cocoa flavor with a slight bitterness. Sweet and doughy, a bit of caramel. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Overall, this is an average American Dunkel Lager."

"Overall- It doesn't try to hard. Doesn't want to impress in that sense, it does impress. It doesn't try to hard for something it's not. I wouldn't say it's a simple man's beer, but it's a dark beer for people that usually don't enjoy dark beers."
"The beer has a cola body with hints of ruby. A quarter inch of beige head quickly fades. The aroma offers bittersweet chocolates, light coffee, brown bread, malt. Ok flavor. Mild sweetness with moderate carbonation. Middle of the road."

"A tad spicy with lurking carbonation, but not enough to give the feel any bite. Body is squared up."

" Ahhh, very good. In the mouth this feels like a really light beer, but it is packed full of flavor. Sweet upfront, but it doesnt linger. Almost a root beer like flavor, but without the carbonation, which is contrary to all the bubbles I see. Chocolate, honey, malt. All this yet it sits lightly, and not weighty like a doppelbock might. It would be easy to tip back a few of these. Easy drinking solid dark lager."

"O=I was rather impressed, as I envisioned a more bitter beer. I love Lakefront's red, and this is another winner...will definitely buy again. This would pair well with hamburgers, I think, or even do by itself."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottoms up!"
""
""
"O - It is a tasty lager. I enjoy the cocoa and caramel flavors. It is probably the best domestic dark lager that I have tried."
"Overall: A good beer and one that I could likely drink several of in one sitting."
""
""
""
"O - flavors from a darker beer in a relatively light and drinkable beer. Not as complex or flavorful as a porter, but would enjoy this as a session beer"
"O - Another smooth and outrageously drinkable lager from Lakefront, Eastside Dark is, as the name suggests, dark but, it's bready, chocolatey malt profile has an almost creamy feel that finishes with a nice lager cleanliness. Flavorful but not heavy."
""

"Pours pale hazy cloudy yellow with high white fizzy foam. Orange peel nose, a little soapy. Coriander. Fizzy taste, sneaky orange citrus, quick finish. Chalky. Effervescent. Soda like carbonation, and a bubbly finish. Odd."
""
"Nicely done."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. :Pours very dark red with a small off white head that leaves nice lacing down the glass. Smells of dark roasted malt with fruit notes, especially berries. Tastes of chocolate and very slight fruit. Nice combination. Beer is slightly heavily carbonated medium bodied, finishes nice. Overall, a very good beer."
""
"Pours brown in color with copper edges. Much of the finger of beige head dissipated quickly leaving only a film of foam floating on top of the liquid. The nose is reminiscent of dark rye bread. Malt is prominent in the flavor profile and the finish is dry with an ever so slightly hop bitterness coming through. This offering is hearty and tasty for sure."
""
""
""
""
"The Rest: Not bad. It has a nice, medium mouthfeel, but is strangely watery in the middle. Beats a Bud Light."
""
""
""
"Pretty good beer to stumble across but I would only want a couple before moving on."

"Overall, this is EXCELLENT. Lakefront Lagers are WONDERFUL, and this is no different."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great Munich dunkel, presenting a complex malt flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ruby brown, like a good fancy pen ink. Fine head and lacing. Decent smell - mainly straightforward malt. The malt flavor is delicious though. Even if it is just straightforward stuff, the slight sweetness and the carbonation are big pluses for me. Feels extra pleasant in the mouth, and after, no sting. If that's what you like, you'll get it here. Any beer that is perfectly pleasant to drink gets high points from me. This may not be a brew with too much fancy complexity, but it is perfectly pleasant. I'd buy a twelve pack or a case in a heartbeat."
""
""
""
"O - Not my favorite style, but it hit all the characteristics that you'd expect from a dark lager. I wouldn't buy again but I'd recommend to a friend who likes the style."

"A tasty dark German-style lager, and where better stateside than Wisconsin to deliver that to us? I won't bore everyone with the obvious Canadian alternatives, so let's just say that I wouldn't mind a few more rounds of this if I were planted at some spartan pub table, eating salty, fatty snacks (back to you, America!), and thinking of breaking into songs in support of country or college football team."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, bread, and caramel. Taste is much the same with a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I think it has a better smell than taste."
""
"O: it's a nice beer though I think it could have gone darker and more bitter. i would love to try this with a bit of a rye kick."
""
""
""
""
""

"I enjoyed this. Nothing overly complicated, but clean and fairly bold for the style."

"Nutty and cocoa malt, a pinch of raisin, some lactic sourness that is a bit overwhelming, then chicory bitterness and more sweet cocoa on the finish. Not all of the flavor notes are where I would want them to be, but overall it's a satisfying beer that drinks well, nicely complex and bold for the style."
"O - Great color to this beer. I thought that malt character was wonderfully complex with a clean/refreshing finish that forms an overall satisfying brew."
""
""
"O -- Overall this is a great drinking beer, well worth trying by anyone who likes dark beers, but I still can't call it a good Dunkel with the roasted malts being so prominent."
""
"Overall this is a really good drinking dark German brew but I can't help but wonder what I am smelling. What hops are used for this? I would buy it again however."
""
""
"D: Excellent."
"12 oz bottle poured into Sam Adams glass. Pours a deep brown with quickly dissapating head. Roasty malt nose with some earth tones and chocolate. Taste has some toffee, dark fruit, and a fair amount of spicy hops. Nice snappy dry finish, well carbonated. This one actually exceeded expectations, probably wouldn't buy it again but certainly wouldn't turn it down if somewhat offered it."
""
"Not a bad little beer, but I probably will not seek it out again."

"yet another underwhelming beer out of my mixed 8 pack. I can't see myself buying it again, not that their bad beers but I've yet to be truly impressed for the cost"
"Liking this one as it combines a strong burnt malt , smoky flavour with a very drinkable finish. Mouthfeel is spot on for the style and the beer has a complexity to the taste that often dark lagers lack. Would like to try this again but sadly it only comes in the 8 pack in BC"
"Light body (4/10), somewhat complex, and easy to drink. Easily a session beer, had 4 of these the other night & was feelin damn good. If I recall correctly, was $7.99 for a 6pack at Total Wine & More. Good deal, looking forward to more Lakefront stuff!"
"It is a nice balance of hoppy and malty, with the emphasis on malty. Overall it is a nice experience, but I won't be seeking it out for repeat tasting."
"Overall an average beer, lacks a little crispness, not sure if I would run to the store to buy."
"SOLID, NOTHING SPECIAL!"
"This is one of the last of the Lakefront regular lineup for me to try, and I was pleasantly surprised by it. There's some really outstanding toasted malt flavor in this one--great smokiness and touches of coffee and chocolate throughout. I think I was hoping for a heavier mouthfeel, but it works just fine the way it is. Due to the richness of the flavors, I would probably drink this one more like a dessert beer, but it could certainly be more versatile than that. I'll definitely be revisiting this one."
"O- Overall, this was a decent beer but probably not something I would purchase again."
"O) A nice dark lager. The carbonation dominates too much of what is happening in the mouth - taste and feel - and is a distraction. Other than that true to form."
"Eric"
"O - It'll bet this beer is better if paired with food. I like it, although I prefer beers that are a little less bitter and a little less pungent and roasted in the background, especially beer of a style that's German/Bavarian in nature."
"Overall, a tasty beverage, but lightly off scents and a bit too much malt sweetness on the tongue make me relate it to a brown ale."
"A little thin in the mouthfeel. But, overall a very solid dunkel that is very drinkable."
"First had this brew during SummerFest a couple years ago, and it seemed pretty tasty then. Had to revisit to make sure. It pours a clear sunset garnet topped by a short finger of dusty ecru foam. The nose simply comprises dark wheat and very light roasted malts. A dusting of coffee lurks in the distance, but doesn't seem to pose much of a threat to the other elements. The taste rounds the nasal elements out a bit, bringing in some mild cocoa and light grass to the dark wheat/light roast party. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a nice li'l brew, nothing spectacular, but enjoyably drinkable nonetheless."
"Overall not a great beer but a good one."
"Pours a dark amber pour with medium white head. Aroma is very very faint. I got picked up by the nice light smokey taste of coffee, roasted malts, dark chocolate, mild spice, and nuttiness. Feels somewhat unbalanced but overall a good dunkel lager true to style."
"Nice mellow feel with a smooth bit of oiliness, but blended in with a solid carbonated crispness... This is a good bier."
"either this beer is slightly infected, or maybe it's actually a year (or hell, 2?) old and has gone bad."
"D: The beer is extremely easy to drink, especially since it's not filling. It is quite sessionable."
"Worth a try"
"Overall, this is a worthy example of a German-style dark lager; flavorful and refreshing without being too filling."
"Eastside dark is a treat! It pours a very dark brown as the scent of malts tickle your nose. Has a short lived head on it though. It has a semi-heavy nutty taste to it mixed with what tastes to be a few spices. Only complaint here is that it could use a little more carbonation to it."
"Overall: A stellar way to end the variety pack. I can see enjoying this one again soon during a football game. The balance and light body are what sell me on this variation of the style. It is not as robust as it could be, but I think that is one of this beers strengths."
"The mouth had a creamy feel to it and a licorice after taste. Man, not a fan of licorice. Maybe I'm picking up on a flavor that is not there, but that's how my tongue interprets it."
"A nice Milwaukee dark lager in the fashion of the Dunkel. Lighter then expected considering its color. I would buy again."
"Cheers...."
"Small degrees of milky cream downward. Not a heavy beer, thin, in a good way. Light smoke peat feel as well. Light carbonation to allow you to pick up on some of these nuances. A cool beer for a cool Milwaukee evening. Or day."
"Pretty good. Drinks very easy."
"D - Not a bad beer from Lakefront. This one can be enjoyed at any time of the year."
"Quite nice drinking a fresh lager beer that was bottled less than two weeks ago - sometime during the first week of August."
"This is easily drinkable and worth having. I suppose it would make a perfectly reasonable session beer."
"Overall this is a fairly complex lager with some nice roasted and dark flavors that manages to still be light enough to be easy drinking. It is malt focused yet not too sweet at all."
"Black colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is faint chocolate.Taste caramel,chocolate and a little coffee.Overall a decent beer that goes down relatively smmooth.This is something you can drink in any season.I'm pretty sure that I would buy again and would recommend to try at least once."
"D - Really good beer but nothing to really seek out than most dunkel style lagers I have tried. Very drinkable though"
"Pours a nice dark brown color, too much carbonation, HUGE foamy off-white head, with TONS of sticky lacing. The nose is malty, bready, with lots of caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, bready, with lots of caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, I was expecting alot more from this brew, disappointted."
"Still, the beer fares quite well. Just gotta like the toast character here. It's probably what Michelob's Amber Bock wants to be when it grows up."
"An enjoyable, well-balanced dark lager. A touch of roast, hops and a mild sour touch keep it from being too sweet while keeping it malt-forward. Easy-to-drink. Nice!"
"The body is thinner than I would like as well. Some mild carbonation on the tongue, but it's just lacking in depth. Sweet brown sugar right away in flavor. Some toasted breads in the middle, and a slightly sour syrup-y back end. This was alright, but I've had much better of the style, and much better from the brewery. Probably my least favorite of theirs so far."
"(D)- A solid beer that might be a bit richer than what the style typically is, but it is welcomed. A great alternative for the brown ale enthusiast looking for something new or different. One of lakefront's best in my opinion."
"Overall: I like East Side Dark and would certainly recommend it to friends. However, the taste is just a bit too light. It needs to be boosted, given a shot of flavor and character. At the end of the day, people will remember that they drank a good beer but will not remember the name. Lakefront is an amazing brewery! But I think they held back on this one a bit."
"D: Overall well balanced with good carbonation. Very light and drinkable for a darker beer. I will have to find and try more beers like this one."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable beer in a style that one does not see, at not least a lot around here. A good beer that I would pick up again."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my New Belgium globe glass. This beer pours a dark cola brown with a 2 inch beige head that leaves no lacing. The aroma is chocolate syrup, cola, and just a bit of toast. No hop presence. Honestly the flavor is almost exactly the same. Light chocolate, uncarbonated Coca Cola, toast with just a light medicinal bitterness. The mouthfeel is light with a light carbonation. Wow, I think this is the shortest review I've wrote in a while but there really wasn't much to say about it. Really mediocre."
"It has been difficult for me to find a bad year round beer from Lakefront, and this is no exception."
"No creeping imperialism here, just a nicely done dunkel. Worth a try by all."
"Overall this certainly wasn't a bad beer but it's not one I'll look for again."
"Flavor is similar, grainy and simple, slightly astringent with a mild nuttiness. Something mildy medicinal about it that doesn't sit well with me. No trace of hops whatsoever. Not as crisp as a true German Munich Dunkel. Body is light, and fairly easy drinking. Overall it's passable, but Riverwest Stein is much better."
"D: Starts good, but the finish lacks anything memorable. Good dunkel though, the sweetness is not overpowering and a rather enjoyable brew."
"D - This is pretty good brew. It was tasty and easy drinking."
"The drinkability is hurt by the sourness in my opinion. In fact, I could see this being a very good beer without that lactic twang because I do like the malt bill. However with it, I was looking forward to finishing this one."
"Pours a clear dark amber color with a finger of slightly tanned head. Nose is roasted grain, with some citrus hop zing. A little bit of a metallic twang is present in the aroma as well. Taste is a nice mixture of caramel and sweet malt in the front with some metallic notes jumbled around with the faint hop bitterness... it all gets wrapped up in a crisp finish. LIttle bit of buttery notes in the lingering aftertaste. It is medium bodied with low carb. Despite the minor metallic twang I am finding this beverage rather enjoyable and easy drinking."
"Overall a decent beer from Lakefront. I'm not sure anything will ever supplant Riverwest Stein as my favorite but this is a suitable stand in."
"Overall most Lakefront beers have been...kinda boring....All solid beers don't get me wrong, but mainly classic styles with classic interpretation. The same holds true with this one"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a 1 inch head. Smeel is mild, some notes of malts. Taste is lightly sweet and malty. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a pretty decent brew."
"Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with stronger than expected carbonation given the lack of head. Drinkability is limited just because it simply isn't very good."
"This beer didn't seem anything like the style to me, like whatsoever, besides color. I enjoyed it though, so I gave it a good review."
"D- Very sessionable. Best one of this style I've had a long time."
"through all that weird yeast flavor there is a touch of roasted barley. the finish is astringent. the body is watery. hopefully a bad bottle, but i won't assume it. since i bought the last sampler pack and they don't carry this separately, it will be some time before i can retest."
"Deep cola brown appearance much darker than the current Penn Dark being brewed at the Lion. Head is light beige, lacing is even but scant. Aroma has a tartness working it's magic amongst the darker malts, cocoa powder and coffee roasts in the forefront with mineral water yeast nuttiness that appears in most of the beers I've had from them. Herbal tea leaf notes in the finish with an air of smokiness, complex light beer...I like it. Flavor has a fruit sweetness under the light coffee and roasted milk chocolate layers, along with more of a slightly lactic mineral quality that just works in a dunkel. Hell this is better than Hofbrauhaus Pittsurgh's dunkel. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied really a dry roasty finish going with tartness lingering on the sides of my palate. Drinkability overall is pretty effin' good, one of those effortless beers that I would probably imbibe on while visiting the brewery."
"Drinkability: This is a very nice dunkel; probably the best beer I have had from this brewery"
"D: not a bad showing from Lakefront. I am not sure what I have had in the past from this Midwest Brewery but this brew ranks in the upper tier. I would have this again"
"Big tan head on a dark brown body. The taste is kind of like a dry stout. Roasty with some nice molasses sweetness. Seems a little watery to me, though. A bigger malt presence and more carbonation would have been nice. Roastiness and a little bitterness on the finish."
"Aroma is strong, malty and yeasty with just a touch of cinnamon. It pours a somewhat transparent amber-brown with a thick and fairly persistent tan head - quite appetizing. Flavor is malty and hast a subtle undertone of molasses. Texture is smooth, a little fizzy and just a tad thin - this beer's only weak point. Overall, a worthy brew."
"The feel is bubbly with some retention on the roof of the mouth. Milky. It's a solid dark beverage, malty and rich. The roasted malt and cola flavors dominate."
"Pours a dark amber color with lighter tan colors along the bottom of the glass. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, yeast cleanliness, and slight grass aroma. Fits the style of a Munich Dunkel Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt up front, then some roasted malt, yeast cleanliness, hints of pale hops, and some grass flavors."
"The mouthfeel is very effervescent, medium body, extremely drinkable."
"D: A really nice Munich Dunkel lager, nothing overly complex, easy to drink and enjoyable."
"Pours a dark brown with a coppery edge and a small head, with decent lacing. The aroma is fairly thin, though it has good smoky, chocolatey notes of dark malt. The flavor is rich and roasty, but sadly thin on the finish. The mouthfeel is thin, with some carbonation that brings up the roasted malt flavor."
"Overall a good beer and would have again any time."
"Of all the darks I have to say this is a pretty good beer. Reminds me of berghoff dark but with a better aroma and mouthfeel to it. It was a simple dark nothing that really hit you but still nice and smooth. All in all its a pretty good beer I would most likely buy it again."
"D - Nice beer that I would drink again if it were in my area."
"I poured this new beer (for me) into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was dark as it should be. It poured a tan bubbly head with tiny bubbles. Lacing was only fair. The taste starts sweet, chocolaty, and malty and finishes a little bitter, but not too bitter. I liked it and will buy again."
"this is a very good beer with alot to offer. i drank it after dinner and it went down quite smooth. would drink again"
"D: Very good, tasty and satisfying and easy to drink, and no alcohol flavor."
"Excellent example of this style. Best beer in the sampler hands down."
"Thanks to my friends at FSRI for the 2nd installment of my Beer of the Month club. 12oz. bottle served in a pilsener glass. Bottled during the 3rd week of January notched on the bottle. Poured cola brown with maroon highlights when backlit. One inch frothy, off-white head slowly recedes leaving generous strands of lacing in its wake. Mild nose - earthy, lactic acid, perhaps some cocoa. Taste is difficult to describe - earthy and vegetal. Mouthfeel is light and lively. Goes down easy, but kind of weird tasting."
"a medium brown in color with a one finger light tan head that did leave a ring with each sip. aroma was weak, faint coffee was the best i could smell. taste was better, roasted malt and fresh coffee with a slight nutty slightly bitter finish. light mouthfeel and carbonation held up well. overall very drinkable and has a nice taste."
" Drinkability: This is a very easy to drink beer with a desent taste. could easly see myself drinking alot of theses in one sitting. I would definitely buy this beer agian if only i could find it around where i live"
"I think this is a pretty competent dark lager. Smells, tastes, looks, feels very rich, but not thick. It does seem a little...hmm...""metallic""- but not distractingly so. I might have to drink 6 or 7 of these in a row to really assess the drinkability, but I'm pretty pleased with it. Seems like a good ""flagship"" beer (which I think they consider it)- if so, it's a great standard to hold to."
"I recieved this as part of a beer of the month club. I poured it from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It is dark with red hues when held up to a light. There is moderate head formation, no lacing. The aroma is slightly sweet with a hint of coffee. The flavor was sweet, almost nutty, without a hint of bitterness. The finish was dry and crisp. A light bodied brew with moderate carbonation it is highly quaffable. IMO it tasted similiar to a nut brown ale."
"Drinkability: Take it or leave it. I was hoping for more toasted bread qualities, but it kept giving me nuts! It's shrug-inducingly acceptable, but when shopping for a dunkel, I prefer Ayinger's Altbairisch Dunkel. That's just me though!"
"Not bad, a bit sweet for a session, but I'll give it shot tomorrow before/during the game."
"Pours a cloudy amber brown with a thin tan head. Not much retention, but decent laceing. Aroma is of fruit and sweet malts. Body is light and carbonated. Taste is sweet and fruity with a nice tart finish. Some honey notes make this a very enjoyable brew."
"D= Decent. pretty average beer."
"I would say that this was a good, chocolate, nutty lager. I'm a fan of this brewery and this beer was certainly solid."
"Pretty presentation, nice fluffy head, beautiful brown color and texture. Aroma of dark fruits (cherries), but in a bit off-putting way. Follows through with the flavor- more Sucrets than fruit, perhaps. I don't dislike it, it's actually decent enough, but just a bit odd for me."
"The taste is similar, mostly fresh, moist whole-wheat bread, hints of earth and pine, very light hints of caramel, herbs, and chocolate. It's zesty but very smooth, easy to drink, yet complex and full of flavour."
"Drinkability: A nice introduction to the style for me, and spot on as far as the BA and BJCP style guidelines go. Alcohol is low and undetectable, making this one very sessionable/drinkable. Though it's not the most interesting beer in the world, it's solid, and worth a recommendation."
"I just can't get past the wierd sourness, it ruins what could have been a decent beer for me."
"Not bad. Strong cocoa and earthy notes. Certainly worth a try if you are a fan of the style."
"Drinkability: superb session beer here. One of my favorites from Lakefront."
"The beer pours a translucent brown color with a 1/2"" offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry, roasted malt scent with not much else to speak of. The taste is decent as well. It's dry and roasted with little complexity. It tastes like a lagered nut brown. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a good drinking beer, although this is a pretty different dunkel than I'm used to drinking."
"D-Good session brew; probably my favorite thus far from this brewery."
"M/D: I'm sitting here, thinking about changing the ratings a bit. It is a very drinkable beer. It can be a session beer, no doubt. But, I am swinging back and forth about whether I just plain ""like"" the beer, or really ""love"" this stuff. This is what I think Michelob, or a top line version of Miller should be. At any rate, I am digging it."
"Taste is mostly roasted malt, more syrupy than I expected, good amount of carbonation, slight dry chocolate taste with a little chocolate bitterness."
"Notes: You could have this one during the summer and although not too complex it is a good beer to have. I will try this again as I like dark beers. Nice flavor,good balance. Not world class,but worthy of a purchase."
"12oz brown bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester as part of this brewery's sampler 8-pack. Pours dark brown with ruby-red highlights and a half inch of light tan head. Smells like chocolate, caramel, with just the slightest hint of hops. Tastes chocolatey and nutty with smoke and fruit notes on the finish. Full bodied with ample carbonation helps make this dunkel even more drinkable. Very tasty - a really solid dunkel."
"Don't drink and review."
"Pours a cola like dark brown color with an average head that settled into a light cap. The aroma is of roasted malt and stale coffee. I don't pick up much of the doughy/bready characteristics of the Munich style. The brew has a nice mocha like taste, with a touch of the munich malt characteristics that I mentioned was lacking in the aroma. The feel is light and watery and perhaps too soft on the carbonation, especially for a lager. Nice drinkability and a decent brew overall, nothing spectacular going on here."
"D - While I did enjoy it, this is not my favorite style. Still a solid, drinkable beer worthy of a session."
"Best consumed on-tap while smack dab in the extraordinary cultural mecca known as Milwaukee's East Side."
"Definitely a tasty lager that I would look for again."
"D - Easily drinkable. There are enough dark flavors here to keep you interested and the balance between the hops and malt is well maintained. The only flaw I can find is a slight over-carbonation that gives the beer some undesirable, soda like qualities in the finish."
"D - Extremely drinkable dark lager with good amount of flavor. Better than I had anticipated. Quite sweet and pretty heavy on the carbonation, but also very flavorful."
"Poured a deep, dark amber-brown. Head appears then fades quickly. Aroma is somewhat lacking, some graininess, some chocolate, faint hop. Decent sweet malty taste, dark malt bite is minimal, toffee or carmel peep out. This beer company would not survive in WA state."
"This beer poured a dark brown with a nice off-white head. The aroma is malty and a bit earthy. The taste is sweet with caramel and coffee notes. It has a big, well balanced flavor. It is full bodied. I bought this in a mixed box not thinking much about it - but I'm impressed! This is a very drinkable brew!"
"Overall a decent lager. Not as smooth as the typical dunkel."
"Pours a clear dark brown with a minimal tan head. Nose is so minimally earthy and leafy that it is almost non-existent. Flavor is earthy and leafy with a bitter tang to it. Feel has a decent bubble and the liquid is nice too, but overall this is a lackluster performance. Nothing to run to the store to grab hold of."
"Not exactly tops but a rather enjoyable brew nevertheless."
"D - Ok. Not an overly great beer but solid. If it came down to this or bmc's, there's no thought needed."
"This beer pours a pretty reddish brown color, with a small lacing on top. There is suprisingly little aroma. The taste is the best of this beer. It is very think for dark beer without much consistancy but it is drinkable. Overall worth a shot. This beer is one of LakeFronts best, it fits with there style."
"Pours a brownish red color, topped by a good finger of creamy off-white head that sticks around for a little while. Aroma of sweet Munich and dark malts, a hint of caramel, and a touch of fruity hops. Palate is mildly sweet up front, before the balance of fairly assertive fruity hops sets in. The body is pleasantly creamy, yet can be a bit foamy if you're not careful. Drinkable, but the sweetness is a bit much to handle at times. A decent offering."
"d - easily drinkable and enjoyable."
" ~ This is my favorite Lakefront brew. I'm always happy to indulge in an Eastsider."
"drinkability is great. this is a lighter brew that contains a great balance of flavors, yet doesn't feel heavy in the mouth or stomach. cheers!"
"A pleasnt beer. nothing great, yet still enjoyable."
"This is like a great brown ale, although it's a lager. A nice round flavor."
"Finish is clean, mouthfeel is good, medium just shy of full body. As with other ""oddly"" dried-malt brews, gets a little old. I can easily finish a bottle, no need for another."
"This beer is solidly drinkable and one I would enjoy sessioning. Definitely recommended. Cheers!"
"O - This is a damn solid brew. While certainly not anything groundbreaking, it's flavors are complex and balanced. All the while, this remains an excessively approachable beer both to session and to mix with a wide variety of pretty common foods."
"I had this on-tap at the brewery."
"era. Tasty."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a brown color with mohogany highlights and a thin creamy off-white head. The smell seems slightly complex; chocolate, roasted malts, toasted biscuits and a slight fruity aroma. Beer is well balanced with hops, almost to the point of being slightly more than I would expect for the style. The hops are grassy and earthy, the malt is there, but not overwhelming. There is also a slight hint of alcohol. The beer is pretty light in body with creamy carbonation and a dry finish. This is a decently drinkable beer; a pretty tasty lager."
"It is very good and drinkable."
"This is a full bodied lager with a pleasant mouth coat and a low to moderated degree of carbonation"
"Lakeside's Eastend Dark pours a very deep chestnut brown robe beneath a short but creamy head of light tan. The nose is rich with brown sugar, floral hops, and a cocoaish edge. In the mouth it's smooth with a moderate carbonation and medium body. Yeasty fruitiness, brown sugar, and mild notes of chocolate combine in the flavor along with a touch of floral and spicy hops. It's backed by a firm bitterness, and it finishes short and dry with a quick note of subtle cocoa and some lingering noble hops."
"D: Not bad. Bit unbalanced with the sourness vs the maltiness."
"White elephant BIF strikes again."
"Kind of a lighter woody amberish color with a sparse lightly tan head that fades. Doesn't look too appetizing. Smells really nutty. Really sweet with caramel notes as well. First sip delivers a rich smooth flavor one expects but often doesn't find in a Dunkel. A touch of roasted hazelnut flavor is there. Some semisweet chocolate flavors come around underneath the nuttyness. A touch herbal and acidic fruitiness in the back. Actually has more carbonation and liveliness on the palate than appearance would suggest. Better than most Dunkels, flavorful and drinkable."
"Eastside Dark is one of the better beers in the Lakefront lineup. It adheres to the dunkel lager guidelines--as I understand them--and manages to pack a considerable amount of flavor and a respectable amount of depth into a relatively light style. I'd consider buying this one in sixers on those rare occasions when I crave a well-rounded, easy drinking dark beer."
"Drinkability: Not sure of the ABV on this one, but with low bitterness and average carbonation, I could stand to have a few of these. Nothing over the top as far as complexity, but maybe a good session beer."
"I first had the Eastside Dark at one of my favorite pizza places in the city last summer. Now whenever I am in the city I will make it a point to pick some up. As I poured the beer into my pint glass, I could already smell very strong notes of coffee and heavy barley malts. The beer poured out into a nice deep chestnut mahogany color with a creamy off-white head. The head dissipated rather quickly, after a minute or so, leaving a wispy film on the top of the beer. The beer smelled of toasted barley, coffee, rich chocolate malts; comparable to the scent of a freshly baked loaf of wholegrain bread. The first drink had a nice balance of strong bittering hops, roasted malts, and coffee. After a few drinks, I noticed that the beer became a little acidic, but the acidity subsided further down the glass. All in all, the brew was a very smooth elixir of toasted grain, roasted malts, mixed nuts and freshly baked dark bread. The tastes reflect the nose perfectly. The beer is highly carbonated and stays that way through the whole glass. The most notable feature of this brew was the surprisingly smooth aftertaste. Usually dark lagers have a strong bitter aftertaste; this one was surprisingly sweet. This beer is fairly drinkable, but is rather filling. In all, this is a very good beer to sit back and enjoy."
"Overall, a good example of a Munich dark without going over the top."
"Pours dark amber in color, almost opaque, with a tan head that dissipates after a a couple of minutes, leaving a ring of lace and a few archipelagoes. Theres a tangy, sour quality to the nose which might lead one to think of an infected yeast strain, but Ive tasted this beer on a number of occasions and this quality has remained consistent. Sweet and tangy on the first sip, the tanginess coming from a collusion of malt and hops. Smooth on the palate, and the sweet / tangy interplay makes this beer seem a bit light but ultimately quite refreshing (the taste may seem a bit light / thin from the way it pours and looks, but its on-style.) Mild hop bitterness throughout is tempered by a floral quality present about midway through the palate. Nice roasted dark malt notes in here. This was the one I went back for on several occasions when I toured the brewery, even with their Big Easy on tap!"
"You know the fake Mona Lisa with the mustache painted on? This beer is that but with a stinky little Budweiser foamscud caterpillar 'stache. It tries to have body and be a dark being but if you rinse the mud off it has a corporate label taste across its chest and through the neck and away it goes to blasé land. Poor little penny ante brew."
"Not outstanding, but better than average. Poured a light chestnut. Head quickly diminished to a long-lasting ring of lace around the glass. Sweet, clean malt flavor, wiht less roastedness than I would have expected. Bitterness that hinted at coffee. Sharp, clean finish. Very refreshing."
"One of the best Stateside interpretations of the style I've ever had. Bravo. Pours out to a light brown amber color with a short lived head of foam that drifts away quite fast. Lower carbonation, and lace is absent. Aromas of roasted medium bodied malts, wood notes, saturated grains, some notes of sweet dark fruits. Nice. Taste is full bodied and has a good amount of complexity and depth. Toasty malt, wet grain and cereal, earthy woody notes, a touch of buttery toast. Sweet fired sugar cane finishs off this delectable beer. Mouthfeel is on the thicker side, but still quaffable. A good level of drinkability. Worth trying."
"This brew pours a dark brownish-black color. The head is one finger in height and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma shouts of caramel, but there is also roasted malt and butter. The tase is very relaxing. Caramel tries to dominate but is cut through by roasted malt and chocolate. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, this is a very good brew. I will certainly keep an eye out for this one."
"This beer pours a reddish brown with decent head from a twelve ounce brown bottle. Smells a bit malty. The first sip was a nice roasted malt flavor. Unfortunately, things went down hill from here. The second and subsequent sips had an unpleasant sour taste that predominated. I shared this beer with a friend, who had to pour his out (he supplied the beer, and told me before we drank it that he didn't like it, but didn't say why, but he wanted my opinion). I was able to finish the half bottle I had, but it was not good. Apparently, the problem was not just with this bottle per my friend. I'm not sure if this was a bad batch or if it wasn't handled well after brewing, or if this is just how it is supposed to taste. Based on what I had, I can't recommend this."
"This is pretty quaffable. Would good alone or with Ribs/BBQ or dessert"
"D-This is a nice dark lager. It has good complexity yet subtle and the grain really comes through. The smooth lagering really makes this drinkable. It would be nice to see a bit more hops but this is a good solid beer."
"The flavor is enjoyable and the beer goes down really easy. I wish the roasted notes were a bit more prominent. But a decent brew to sit down with and enjoy!"
"Pours a dark clear brown with a decent off white head and carbonation (although the head receded very quickly). The nose is all sweet toffee with just a touch of fruit on the finish (possibly dates). The flavor is sweet toffee, caramel and figs. No hop character at all. Reasonably smooth mouth feel, OK drinkability. If a dark lager is your style, this is an OK beer. Not my cup of tea though."
"Drinkability: Not too good. I would skip this one."
"D - A decent dark lager, thought I am, admittedly, not a big fan of this style. A little thin and not particularly visually pleasing. A drinkable lager, but not high on my list to revisit."
"Had this on tap at the Red Rock Cafe on Oakland. Looked very nice, dark with a substantial brownish-white head. Nice lacing. Smelled okay initially, a mixture of banana-y esters, buttery diacetyl, and some olives/prunes. As it warmed, though, the smell quickly went downhill, taking on the nose of a giant olive. The taste, thankfully, was not nearly as bad, a little olivey but pretty light and smooth, with just a little bit of a bitter, hoppy finish. Mouthfeel was okay, but the beer was just served too warm, I think. Drink it cold."
"Appearance is dark brown with no head upon the pour. Smell has a hint of chocolate and some sourness as well. Taste is pretty much the same, a hint of chocolate with a pleasant sour finish. Mouthfeel is somewhat full, but the carbonation is lacking. Overall drinkability is OK, better than what most of Milwaukee has to offer."
"Per Lakefront website: Barley malts, chocolate, black patent, and Munich malt. Original Gravity of 1060. Mt. Hood hops."
"In all fairness, this is better than the average dark lager. I think I could learn to appreciate the style more, at which time this review could be adjusted upwardly."
"Poured brown in color with no head and very little carbonation. The aroma is of burnt malts, and the hops are just slightly noticeable. The came across as a little grapefruity. The flavor came across as very watered down, but there was a little bit of chocolate and some grean Christmasy seasonal tones. The mouthfeel was flat and very dissapointing. Not something I would choose again because it is overall quite lifeless on the tongue."
"I stumbled upon quite an odd find here, but lucky me. I'll have to revisit this in the future as I've been happy with the rest of the sampler. If I were rating this as a dark lager, it would score horribly, but hey, it's a good beer, so I'll score it as it's own entity. I'm sure that this probably a very good dark lager, as the aroma was great for a style I generally abhor."
"Very drinkable, could be better on tap. Not a bad brew."
"I find this a nice beer. One that I would buy again. But not one that I would have to have too often."
"I would have preferred a little more bread crust & toast up-front and a little less caramel. The fruity alcohol esters are a bit misplaced in this style as well. A nice and tasty Munich-style dunkel, though surpassed by other examples in my opinion."
"Part of a monthly Beer of the Month Club selecetion. Not one of my favorite styles but still giving it a chance. Pours a very nice glass with a foamy head with lacing that sticks to the glass. Looks almost like root beer. Warmer serving temperature really extracts the floral aromas. Creamy frothiness does not really excite the mouth. Can drink one a night at most."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with nice ruby hues coming around the edges. The nose is toasted sesame seeds to me. The flavor is not bad at all. The lager flavors I dislike are not very prevalent in this. There is a somewhat burtn caramel sweetness in there, along with a nice roasted character. Not a bad beer. The feel is fairly thin. I would like a touch more thickness. Drinkability is not bad either. The beer is more than the sum of its parts. I like it for a lager."
"Clear, dark brown with obvious ruby influences. Shiny yet dull as there wasnt much animation. The head was very skimpy, it only reached a sixteenth of an inch in height (give or take) before quickly disappearing, aside from a thin collar. There wasnt any subsequent lacing either. On a whole the appearance is boring, the color is nice enough but everything else... yawn. The nose is pleasantly roasty with coffee beans, chocolate, and charcoal with just a trace of earthy sweetness. The nose is very inviting, the roast doesnt remind me of a Dunkel but more of a Brown Ale. I like that. The potency is modest but the bouquet is very clean, straightforward and articulate. I like that too. The palate is just a nice as the nose. It is also dead-on as it tastes just like it smells. The only difference is the sweetness is a tickle louder than I was expecting. The roast is the show though, coffee with a kiss of milk, chocolate, and charred wood. There is a tickle of earthiness. Hops dont do much. This is a sweet beer that is balanced by the roast. I like it. Too bad it is not a little more complex or louder. Still Im digging it. I could drink this everyday. The roast reminds me a lot of Empyrean Third Stone Brown and, IMO, that is a good thing. I have no complaints with the palate. It is very likable, easy to drink, and I bet this would go nicely with many grilled meats & veggies, stews, chili, and cheese. My only beef with this beer is mouthfeel, the carbonation is too low (like every Lakefront beer Ive quaffed), it is also a little thin, a little slick and a little sticky. All those littles add up to a problem. This aspect of the beer could me much improved. Extremely drinkable, the abv seems low too (session beer material). Id kick back and quaff a few more any day of the week. It was purchased as part of a sampler-pack in Milwaukee, WI."
"not as good as Kostritzer.. but for an American Dark... very presentable and enjoyable."
"Cola amber brown body with a small off-white head. Smells of roasted, caramelly malt and toasted bread. Taste starts off with lightly sweet malts, singed caramel, and molasses. Followed by roasted/toasted notes. Finish is lightly bitter with lingering roastiness. Medium bodied lager, fairly drinkable."
"A Dark Lager nod to Emperor BigHuge of the Dark Side for this one. May the force be with you Joe!"
"Clear mahogany color with amber highlights. Sturdy head, pale yellow and settles at under 1/2 an inch in height. Dripping ring lace. Touch of burnt rasin bread crust to the aroma, muted but good. Very roasty flavor, cozy like morning toast with some elements of faint semi-sweet chocolate. Mouthfeel is light but works well with a good texture and the flavors. Finishes with a good and subtle transition to bare hay-like hopping, nothing jarring to the overall impression. This was a winner for me, very nice drinking and good for the style and expectations."
"Drinkability factor very high. I'm not sure if this is the darker version of the Klisch pilsener, but whoever had the idea for a good, dark lager got it right here. Very much in the Munich style of dark lagers."
"I really enjoyed this Dunkel as it was very drinkable and it had a good flavor to it. It poured a very small sized lght brown head that contained fine-medium sized bubbles that mostly diminished. The body was carbonated and opaque with a dark brown hue. The nose was malty, chocolate and caramel with a sweet flavor from start to finish. The mouthfeel was very smooth which is much to my liking and it is medium bodied. There was a fair amount of lacing with this beer."
"This one is an orange/brown color with a light tan head. The aroma is of slightly roasted malt ,maybe a little chocolate chip cookielike. Light chocolate and roasted malts dominate the light and refreshing flavor profile. The light body makes it a perfect summer quaffer. +"
"A thorough taste treat, that I'd happily consume again!"
"thanks jeffboo"
"The perfect beer to have on hand to hoist as the UW-Milwaukee Panthers (the college is located on Milwaukee's Eastside) men's basketball team earned their first NCAA tournament berth by winning the Horizon League tournament championship game tonight. It's only taken 107 years. Go Panthers!"
"Worthwhile."
"A pretty good dark roasted malt aroma...very dark brown in color with a bubbly head that fades to a small lace..a very sweet taste with minimal hopping present...definitely a bit syruppy in the mouth..a nice sweet milk chocolate flavor...great taste, just a bit syruppy...I'll drink this one any day over say a Beck's dark..."
"This beer pours dark rubby and throws a medium creamy brown head that is gone in a minute. Nice aroma of roasted malt, chocolate and coffee bean. Nice taste. There's a musty burnt malt taste. Maybe a little molasses. Some chocolate too. A little brown sugar sweetness. The taste is very nice. No harsh bitterness detected at all. Very easy drinking. Medium body. I could drink quite a few of these without blinking an eye."
