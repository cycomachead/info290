"In a glass from a bottle pours very pale yellow and cloudy with a nice two finger foam head. A faint piney hop smell and a little more prominent in taste. Called a Hoppy Wheat. Hops are certainly present but not overboard which I was expecting. And that's not a bad thing. Loses some head but never completely. A little lace.  Goes down nice with no bite or lingering aftertaste. Very good and at 5.50% Very Drinkable  Bartender.....I'll have one more."

""
"Cool label, color and head looked nice after pouring, not crazy impressed after that"
""
"Brew pours a hazy golden-yellow in color with a good 2-finger foamy white head that finally settled down to around 5mm after a while. A good amount of sticky ring-like lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the sides of the glass.. The aroma is of pine and floral hops for the most part. Pretty much the same for the taste with some citrus zest also. Really not as hoppy as you might think and not a I.P.A. style brew either which I am not a big fan of. Just a very slight bitter finish is noted BUT wasn't bad and didn't last long. medium-bodied with good carbonation. Overall not a bad brew as I am not really a big fan of American Pale Ales for the most part."

"O - This is a very refreshing beer that is perfect for summer. The flavors are  very well rounded. Very enjoyable beer."

"Very nice hybrid beer. Good mix of hops & wheat. Not overpowering on either side. Very smooth. Good flavor. No strong bitter aftertaste. If you're expecting an IPA, it's not very piney, but would buy a 6 pack & be happy."

"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Nice head accumulation on the top with minimal lacing. At first smell, I couldn't pick up anything. It does have the citrusy bread smell associated with most wheats. I was a little underwhelmed. Its called Hoppy Wheat yet no smell of hops, no real taste of hops, and it looks like the IBU level is in the 20s. I expect quite a bit more for a beer with Hoppy in the name. That being said, it does have a different taste than a typical wheat. Its very drinkable and is a nice twist on wheat beers. Just wish they'd hopped it up a bit more."
""
"Will absolutely seek out and purchase again. This one was awesome. If it ever becomes available in cans, this could be a go to for float trips and outdoor excursions."
""
""
"this is my go to session beer."
"Well rounded taste, and I love the cloudy sediment/Hefe-pulp, but the texture is too effervescent (fizzy) for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the best beers Boulevard makes."

""

"Wish the hop flavoring matched the aroma."

"I am drinking this three months before its best by date and it has a big hop nose with pine over grass. It pours hazy pale straw under a thick, moussey 2” finely bubbled off-white foam cap. The flavors are very well rounded and the body and texture suggest the presence of some Belgian yeast. It has more hops than a normal wheat beer but they are restrained and not over powering. A hint of caramel on the palate combined with traces of bready wheat constrains and balances the hops. This is full bodied with above average creamy soft carbonation."
""
""
"The perfect combination of all things awesome.  Tasted wheaty but hoppy."
""
""
"Hoppy flavor without the heaviness"

"80 Acre Hoppy Wheat brewed by Boulevard Brewing Co., with an ABV of 5.50% This brew pours out a cloudy light amber color with a nice white head.  80 Acre Hoppy Wheat is an unfiltered brew, you can not see though it. The smell is sweet, citrus , with hops.   You also pick up on some grains and malts in the smell of this brew.  The taste is rich with flavor. You pick up citrus and some nice malts .  This is a nice wheat brew.  The mouthfeel is bold and smooth. You pick up on the citrus but it has a clean finish to it.  There is nothing overpowering in this brew. 80 Acre Hoppy Wheat has a nice balance to it.  Overall I'm giving  80 Acre Hoppy Wheat a 4.5 out 5"
"Overall, tasty and refreshing."

"Smooth wheat beer and one of my ""go-to"" beers for something different than 312."
""
""
""
"This is a very solid brew. There's never been a ton of Pale Wheat Ales out there, so this is definitely a worthy example of the style."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
"Was a little Leary about this beer when I read it was ""hoppy"" but was pleasantly surprised by the taste.  Light on the pallet with light aftertaste.  Recommend !"
""
""
"Pure white head, crests around half a finger and quickly sizzles off to a light surface dusting, while wispy what lacing there is sticks quite well to the glass sides. The liquid is cloudy but does not display any floating particulate, widespread and super-active bubbles fill the glass, overall a light orange to yellow color. The nose shows off the wheat proudly but it’s mainly an explosion of grapefruit and orange citrus, not overly hoppy, there is a bubblegum to pie dough element, at the same time there’s a burst of black pepper and green tea, strong presence without being overpowering. Medium-bodied, sour from all that muscular citrus, the powerful carbonation both brings prickle and limits the soaking in of the pucker factor. Floral with that same bubblegum aspect, delivers more peach, apricot, cherry fruit flavors here. Notes of clove and lesser pepper. Not that dry but closer to that end of the spectrum even as you never feel the flavors are truncated as a result. Maybe a too clingy for full-on refreshment but its liveliness is very attractive and it is easy to keep on sipping. Pulls it off well."

"Edit: makes for an excellent shower beer"

"Poured into a pint glass a very nice cloudy yellow color, very nice carbonation with a nice one-finger plus white fizzy head, which leaves some sticky lacing behind. The nose is slightly hoppy, mostly wheaty/grassy, some yeast notes. The taste is slightly hoppy, with lots of grassy notes. Medium body slightly dry finish. Overall not a bad brew, would have liked to get some fresher bottles."
"OVERALL:  this beer combines everything I like about wheat beer and gave it a better hop profile, but not too overpowering.  Another terrific beer from Boulevard.  I will definitely buy this again."

"Cloudy golden hay color with a stalwart head.  Smells like grass and bread dough.  Unmistakable new tire smell too.  A little sweet on the palette like sweet dough or a Twinkie with some grassy citrus.  Soapy at times. Some prickly resin on the tongue for depth."
""
""
"T/O: Tart citrus lemon squeezes into a sweet pale crackery malt base, and they play off of each other very well. Light passionfruit sweetness and very nuanced. It has a really good flavor, don't get me wrong, but the overall experience lacks in something. I don't want to sound snobbish for a BA, but it doesn't seem as elegant; and NEBCo is brewing out of the back parking lot of a car dealership. What I mean is this beer is best for warm weather whereas NEBCo's Alpha Weizen I could but can't drink all yr round."

"It is a wonder why I don't drink this more often?  Always spot on.  The wheat and hops work perfectly together.  While different interpretations, it is up there with Karbach's Weisse Versa as one of my favorite wheat hybrids that are not full on Hefe's."

"Overall: Despite being past the best by date on the bottle, the beer was good. I think it could be because the store I bought it from kept it refrigerated. The only thing that might identify this beer as a wheat beer to me is by the appearance...there really was no tell-tale sign in the aroma or flavor. The hop aroma and flavors are excellent. If you are an APA fan where you want a lot of hop flavor and aroma but not a ton of bitterness, this is right up your alley. If you don't like wheat beers, don't be turned off by this beer because it doesn't show. If you do like wheat beers, this leaves a lot to be desired. Overall it is a really good beer though, and the framework really relies on the hops...and if it were a house that frame would be made of solid oak."

"12 oz bottle from a variety pack.  Pours hazy golden with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head, nice lacing and lovely carbonation.  Aroma is of citrusy hops, wheat malt, spices and ripe pears and oranges. Body is medium and slightly crisp.  Citrusy hops, wheat malt, yeast, ripe pears and spices fill the mouth.  Finish is long and semi-dry. Nice, easy drinking brew."

"Pours hazy pale yellow with a medium slowly fading white head, some light lacing. Aroma is sweet citrus, mild grapefruity notes, wheat, citrus floral hops. Taste sane as aroma with a mild citrus grapefruit hops bitterness. Palate is medium body, mildly crisp on the palate. Finishes with a wheat some grassy flavor, mildly sweet citrus grapefruit hops bitterness. Overall a pleasant and easy going brew."

"Decent beer. Nice lemony hop profile, but I'm getting a strong herbal flavor and it's off-putting.  Seems to be subsiding as I'm making my way through the glass though. Orange is coming through a bit more. Finishes really clean and dry. I dk. Decent beer I guess, but I'm still getting these herbal notes that are typical of witbiers. Low carbonation and medium mouthfeel."

"Overall: An incredible pale wheat beer, and importantly, one that isn't trying to be something it's not. While Oberon is and remains the standard for traditional pale wheat ales, this in my book is a marvelous middle ground between Oberon and A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' which is a wheat ale that drinks like an IPA. This is definitely a wheat beer, but has just enough additional hops to really stand out without blurring the style line too much. Very impressed."

"The mouthfeel is medium-light, with a good amount of carbonation. The finish is slightly sticky. Overall, this is a very refreshing beer. The light feel, tropical and citrus notes, and higher levels of carbonation keep you going back for more."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very golden straw color with some foamy white head. Smell is pretty sweet, with a lot of wheat and malt aroma and a touch of hops. Taste is almost all wheat beer. Not bad at all, but not really any hop flavor. 3 or 4 years ago I would have absolutely loved this beer. It is just missing that kick that Sumpin' Sumpin' and Gumballhead have. Don't get me wrong. Still a very good beer and I will drink the 6 I have happily. However, if you are looking for a true ""hoppy wheat"" try one of the others. If you are looking for something more balanced, or even tipping the scale the other way, I would recommend this for sure."

"Good beer although it looks slightly like a urine specimen. This is overall a good beer with some citrus-lemon overtones and a slight nice hoppy touch. I could drink this in the summer more than any other season. A good effort but should be adapted to be a year round favorite"

"Overall- definitely a great beer overall. Easy to drink, has a solid ABV %, this would be a perfect beer for most outdoor occasions. I can see myself enjoying this on a day out fishing, going to the beach, camping, the list could go on. This beer feels like it would still be fairly good even after warming up a bit (happens to the best of us!)"
""
""
"Had this beer before but wanted to do a full review and se.e where it stacked up. Love the look of this beer, murky, nice head and even some sediment. The smell is great with the IPA citrus. Great flavor, it pops but is very smooth, very little bitter. Overall an outstanding beer that I hope to revisit many many times."

"O: Very tasty brew.... it mixes the two things I didn't think would go together. I was wrong, this really works. Worth looking for."
""
"This is a very good go to beer. Poured into weiss glass from bottle. Cloudy yellow color, white foamy head. Lemon on the nose, good acidity in the mouth. One of my favorite hoppy wheats; I will drink this anytime. I hate that everybody says its almost the same as GumballHead. Ok, its also a hoppy wheat beer and it has citrus flavors but lemons don't taste like oranges. Really enjoy drinking this beer."

"I can't get over how this beer has the perfect blend of hops in my opinion. Every time I have a bottle it shocks how everything in 80 Acre balances so well together. I'm jonesing for another red tractor six pack while writing this. Created my account just to say this beer is kind of a big deal."

"Overall, a nice version of a lighter pale wheat ale. I would have liked to have had a little more in the way of hops but all in all, a nice refreshing and easy to drink beer."
"As promised the biscuit malts and wheat are quickly overtaken by the hop presence that end clean and almost dry. A really nice brew even a month after I wasn't supposed to drink it!"
""
"Overall - solid beer and for the price, worth a look."
""
""
"Overall, this is one of my favorite beers from Boulevard. It's so good that if they replaced their standard Wheat beer with this one, I wouldn't be the slightest bit upset (although I speculate that there are others who would be...). In terms of comparison to other ""hoppy"" wheat beers, this one holds it's own just fine, and unlike some others, this one manages to remain a wheat beer with hops, rather than tasting like an IPA with some wheat in the grain bill."
""
"Great nose for starters, lacing holds up nicely and there is a good medium mouthfeel. Probably one of my favorite year round regular rotation Boulevard offerings. Pick this up and give it a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a well balanced beer. It has lots of hoppy flavor, but not overly bitter. The wheat base renders the beer very smooth. This is a very good wheat pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is good. Light to medium body with moderate carbonation. Crisp and refreshing."
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied, and almost nectary. Seriously, I love the way this one flows."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a nice lemony yellow with a one finger white head with decent retention. Smell is nice fruity orange with a little sweet malts in the background to balance things out fairly well. Taste is quite quite malty that reminds me of a little sweet syrup with a little Belgian yeast. Not too much but a tiny but of bananas. The hop bill is quite subdued but helps balance things out to some extent. This is a malt forward beer. Mouthfeel is slightly thick for the style due to carbonation. Overall not a bad beer but not a good one. It's just sort of OK. I like their Smokestack Series. Their normal beer is just a not that great."
""
""
"Overall I really like this beer hops, juicy, citrus easy to drink... Have had it a few times and keep going back. Not always the biggest fan of boulevard beers but this is probably my favorite of their line up that I have had. Great take on easy drinking wheat vs hop character! More please."
""
""
"This is a nice summer beer - a good twist on the classic American wheat. I really liked the combination of the crisp lemon/citrus hops combined with the smooth wheat malts. Makes for easy, fun drinking, though it's lacking a final oomf to make it truly fantastic. Recommended!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cloudy pale gold. White foam trace head but with decent lacing. Smells fairly light of wheat and is non-descript. Taste is lemony, crisp, mildly bitter and clean. A very light washing of sweetness. Decent medium body with a firm body. Crisp carbonation. Overall is crisp, refreshing and enjoyable if not fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: A bit too lemony for my taste buds, I almost find myself puckering from the tanginess; a nice twist on the style, nevertheless"
""
""
""
""

""

"Atmosphere is really nice. Great head, but sparse lacing. Nose is hay, with some crisp hop character, a little lemon citrus, and a bit of sweetness. Wheaty character, with a light yet crisp hop bite, balanced with lemon. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."

""
""

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a cloudy straw amber with a half finger white head that dissipates to a thick film and hefty ring around the glass. Aroma of lemon citrus, light stone fruit and citrus hops. Flavor is lemon, biscuit wheat, light wheat, finishing with citrus rind and mild grassy hops. Light bodied with nice peppery carbonation. An interesting take on a wheat ale, with a distinct emphasis on the lemon citrus and a deft hand with hopping. The lemon is so dominant that this seems almost to veer off into fruit-malt-beverage territory, but the quality of the wheat body and citrus hops carry through for a pleasant wheat ale experience. Light and refreshing."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a cloudy light yellow with good fizzy head that dies slow with little head retention. I pick up mostly typical yeast and orangey, citric notes with minimal spice and not much else (no large amounts of hops or sweet malts). Taste/mouthfeel seem to be opposite of nose as I get a smooth, filling body (yeast) that is citric hop laden and has some sweet malts and not much in terms of spice or sharp citric notes one might associate with a wheat ale. It is balance and easy to drink and enjoyable, so overall I have to say this experiment worked."
""
""
"Hazy light straw yellow colored. An inch of foam caps the top of this beer. Aroma of wheat and faint grapefruit like hops greets me. Mouthfeel is very light and crisp. The front of the palate is grapefruit like hops. I would describe this as a session IPA with wheat. Light, crisp, and refreshing."
""
"O - Excellent hopped up wheat, loved the aroma, nice use of hops to create a fresh and balanced flavor."
"Overall- An interesting beer, that has just enough hop character to be enjoyable but not overpowering. While I am not a fan of ""hoppy"" beers, I rather enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
"Taste is grassy and citrus lemon hops with a nice wheaty backbone. A little thin but overall a great refreshing brew. I like oberon a bit more when comparing the style."
""
""
"I've had this both on tap and in bottle, and as one would expect, I liked the draft version better. Extremely drinkable and pretty nice mouthfeel. A bit mild in flavors, not a lot of banana, but still reasonably enjoyable. Comes up a bit short from Boulevard's other offerings."
""
"O: Not a big fan and tastes like it could use some revisions -- reminds me of a so-so homebrew version of Gumballhead -- no nuance or complexity, just hits you over the head with a couple of of hops flavors without much else."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like 80 Acre, and have bought it more than once. I'm not the biggest fan of wheat beers, but saw ""hoppy"" and ""Boulevard"" and tried it, without remorse. This is a nice one to convert macro-drinkers with."
""
""

""
"The beer is hazy and yellow with a half inch of pure white head. Aromas of citrus fruits, wheat, fresh hops. Refreshing and delicious. The wheat and big hop character work so well together. A great summer beer. Light in body and easy drinking. It would be easy to toss back a few pints of this."

"Boulevard 80 Acre Hoppy Wheat Beer ---3.5/5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Pretty good wheat beer. Definitely more of a wheat ale than hop forward beer with wheat. The wheat really shines in the flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my favorite of Boulevards regular beers.  Good mix of citrusy, juicy hops and classic American wheat aromas/flavors.  Easy drinking."
""
""
"Overall: This has a similar profile as its Unfiltered Wheat stable mate, but far more interesting and satisfying on all counts. The hops are an awesome addition, making this a must buy for the Summer months."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden color with a thick foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are excellent.  Has a slightly hoppy wheat aroma.  Hints of citrus.  Slight hoppiness with a wheat flavor.  Bready.  Slight citrus at the end with a mild hoppy aftertaste.  Slightly soapy.  Good beer, but it does seem to be missing something."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A perfect summer session beer. Light and crisp yet with plenty of flavor and perfectly balanced."

"I think that this is a good beer but that fact that it's five months past its best by date has probably affected the quality of this beer. Still, I'll probably pick up a stronger batch later on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A great American Wheat Ale one may expect from the midwest. With the ""American"" aka hop twist, its a touch of midwest meets California."

"Poured into a nonic a hazed lemony color with a fluffy one finger bones white head atop.Aromas of toasted wheat and light citric hops,the aromaes underwhelmed me a little.Anice low carbonated feel to the beer,toasted with that tinge of iron on the palate with a smack of citric hops to save the day in the finish.With a good shot of hops I could see myself driniking this on a humid summer day and being satisfied with it."

"O - Nice hoppy wheat ale. A go-to for the style."
""
"O: The more I have from Boulevard, the more I grow to like them. When done right, this is a style I really enjoy, and this beer in particular is a success. I'd gladly make this a regular in my fridge."
""
""
""
""
""
"ok, boulevard, you sneaked this one under my radar. i had tried the unfiltered wheat and thought it was pretty good but plain, so i thought i would give this a shot. this is a great, clean, refreshing summer beer. hands down. the fruity hops are delivered in a light, carbonated, hazy brew that screams summertime. to me. this reminded me of a lighter, snappier version of little sumpin sumpin or gumballhead,,,same general hop profile but significantly lighter with not as much hop aftertaste, the hop burps are also not nearly as concentrated...again, a fine thirst quenching summer offering that i will enjoy often. good job, boulevard!"
""
"O: I'm very pleased with this beer. I could drink a ton of these and be a happy man! Perfect for these hot summer days!! They nailed it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body was nice, full, smooth, and with a clean finish. Drinkability was good, I'd maybe have a few at a cookout. Overall, a pleasant enough brew, not one that stands out, but probably a decent choice for refreshment. Worth trying if you see it."
""

"80 acre hoppy wheat pours a hazy yellow color, with a nice large frothy head. There is a dry hoppy aroma. The taste has a nice pale, and wheat like flavors, with hints of hops to finish the taste. Good flavors, refreshing, could use a little more carbonation and was slightly watery. Overall however this is a very nice hoppier wheat style beer."
""
"O: This one hits all of my buttons for a summer brew. Easy drinking, fairly low ABV, and looks great in the glass."

"Poured into a pint glass. A hazy pale straw color with a thick, dense white head that remains until the finish. A tangerine and grassy hop aroma. It has a nice wheat flavor with citrus and grassy hop notes. Finishes very smooth with a bit of tartness and a lingering grassy hop flavor. A great light summer beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoy both hoppy beers and wheat beers so this combination really worked for me. Easy to drink, enjoyable, and sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazy golden colored body; a poofy, lumpy head sits atop leaving behind some thick lacing. Aromas are initially floral hops before turning super juicy and bright. Freshly squeezed OJ, lemon, and other citrus surrounding a subtle biscuity wheat note. Pleasant, gentle hop flavors, lemon tea, wheat, mellow citrus juice, and a floral sweetness. Drying in the finish, fluffy, light, and crisp. I had one while grilling and I imagine that's a perfect situation for drinking this beer."
""
""
"O: Summer beer for sure. Wheats aren't my favorite style, but this does a nice combo of an IPA and a wheat. Nose was the star of the show however. Would make a great warm weather brew fur shur."
""
"This is a nice wheat beer and it is indeed hoppy, but the I prefer a bit of bitterness from my hops. This was about as much citrus as you could possibly get out hops. In the end it wasn't bad, but for something claiming to be ""a hoppy wheat beer", I'm expecting a bit more."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, highly recommend to anyone. Terrific combo of sweet and bitter. Great for someone who is on the fence about hop-centric beers. Cheers!"
""
""
"Pours a three finger white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Pale, almost clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Strong nose of pine hops, flavor is a balance of pine hops and caramel malt. Decent wheat. $2.19 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, MA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, but not seeing where this hoppy angle is suppose to come in. Decent brew, but I think I prefer the regular wheat than this."

"o. a pretty nice mix of wheat and hops here. would drink this regularly given it was available in my area and decently priced. the only change i would like would to be to tone down the sweetness a touch. a big thumbs up to the wife for picking this out of the blue for me on a trip to missouri based on the fact she knows i like wheat beers and ipas/hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This would be a great beer on a hot summer day. Clean and delicious even in the winter! Really nice beer that I will definitely enjoy again."
""
"Overall a tasty example of an American wheat ale with a subtle hop addition."
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it’s a very poundable beer worth drinking for a long time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I would define this as an excellent gateway for Blue Moon drinkers looking for more excitement."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is exactly the type of beer I should love: a light malt base with an exceedingly hop forward character. But I don't love this beer in the least. There is something about the juicy, citrus hops sit on that light wheat base that just doesn't sit right with me."
""
""
""
""
"sometimes I feel like I am too easy on beers, or like the .25 increments has made me a softer critic, because honestly, when you want a cold beer and the mellow factor, anything even half craft satisfies. if you disagree, you aren't a beer person. sorry, but that's a fact. this beer is that conundrum. its a mix of styles, wheaty and hoppy, fully American, but a little defunct in some way. the looks is hazy and pale yellow, like any standard wheat based unfiltered brew. but the nose is real hoppy for the color. bitter and west coast, like an American wheat meets an American pale meets dry hopping. not sure this is all of that, but it feels like it could be. I taste some fruity lighter yeast, delicate but raw wheat malt, and a fairly aggressive hoppy profile that year round boulevard concoction so curious. its got some pineapple notes too, which I find fitting. lighter in body but fulfilling texturally. well carbonated and clean but long in the finish, as contradictory as that seems. this is a beer that asks more questions than it answers, but I like it a lot, especially at this price point. boulevard is on a hot streak in my book, cant wait to try the wheat wine!"
"Overall: Super clean. For the style, this is one of my favorites. A perfect summer beer that I could have several of. Nice pilsner like taste with a touch of pleasant bitterness that is never too bitter. One of Boulevards better small beers that I have had the pleasure of trying."
""
""
"O: 4.5 I’m not a fan of wheat beers, but this one is quite good, thanks to the hop profile"
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great beer. If only this was available on tap to get an even fresher taste!"
""
""
"Overall, this is an interesting beer. A nice change of pace but probably not one I would seek out on a regular basis."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Well-done execute of part citrusy APA and a straight wheat beer. I'm sure this would be a great lawnmower beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mild hops, bitter/sweet wheat quality is my best description of this beer. Overall it has a solid mild quality with no dominating tastes. Good and balanced. This was a pretty impressive beer I will seek out."
""
""
""
""
"This is not bad, but just seems weird to me. I love that Boulevard (one of my favorite brewers by the way) tried something different, but I think that there is a reason that wheat beers are traditionally not very hoppy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A delightful, easy-drinking session ale that is my new ""go-to"" Boulevard beer. Bravo, as this is one I'll gladly return to!"
""
""
""
""
"O: I am so glad Boulevard released this beer; now, along with their porter they have to go-to ""regular"" beers"
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy, golden color. 5/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hop oil, floral hops, hint of pine, wheat, hint of sweet malt, hint of pale malt, and a hint of earthy malt. Fits the style of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. There is also a slight tartness. Tastes of wheat, hint of citrus, hint of pale malt, hop oil, and floral hops. Overall, great appearance, good body, and good aroma. It reminiscent of Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat and Boulevard Single-Wide IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Refreshing and tasty. Great Summer beer."
""
""
"Overall: a very refreshing and drinkable beer. This could make a pretty great session beer; good hop flavor without being overwhelming. I would definitely have this again."
""
""
""
"This beer really deserves it's own style, as do many normally called APWAs. How about Hoppy Wheat Ales? Or Hopped Wheat Ales? Naming conventions aside, this is a very tasty beer. Has a great haze, great nose that implies it's far more bitter than it is. Instead, it has all those great floral aromas as tastes without the bitterness. What a gold mine of taste, and a knock out brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a nice wheat beer."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied with surprising little carbonation. Okay though. Overall, by far one of the best wheats I've had. Great session beer too. Pretty impressed by this."
"The taste is pretty amazing."
""
""
"O- This is a pretty darn good beer. Perfect session ale or summer beer."
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-light bodied, with mid-level carbonation, creating a slightly fizzy, foamy, but smooth mouthfeel. Closes semi-dry, as expected from the substantial hop usage."
""
""
""
""
"M- Thin body with good carbonation. Very clean finish and quite drinkable."
""
"O-They were pushing this beer as a Gumball Head substitute, haven't had Gumball Head but this beer wasn't extraordinary."
""
"O: A step away from what they originally tested at the brewery but unique in the market nonetheless"
""
"The beer is quite refreshing and easy to drink. Nice hop flavor without all the bitterness of an IPA. Another good Boulevard beer."
""
"O: A very interesting brew unlike any other pale wheat I have had. If you can get I recommend trying it."
""
""
"Okay, so where's my mule, then!? This stuff pours a pale lemon-straw topped by over a finger of white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit zest, lightly funky wheat, grass, pine resin, and a touch of biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a slightly sweet bit of lemon zest, sort of along the lines of a Lemonhead. Everything works together very well. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a tasty APWA, one not afraid to hop it up a bit. Boulevard continues to impress."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is really enjoyable and right easy to drink. Recommended."
""
"First sampled from a 12 oz shorty, with a stamped on ""best by"" date. I live the in the KC metro, and this was a much anticipated release, and I wasn't disappointed. A pretty big nose of fruity and citrus hops. It definitely drinks like a wheat, with a mouthfeel much like their Unfiltered Wheat. Very refreshing, and it will certainly be a staple, especially when the Midwest summer heat cranks up."
""
""
""
""
""
"No doubt about it, I could quaff this one back on the regular basis. Love beers with wheat, love hops, etc. A win all around for me so a respectful nod to the brewery for this one."
"12oz bottle, pours a hazy yellow with a tall, bubbly, white head, decent retention, excellent lacing as the head fades. Citric hop, lemon rind, grapefruit, and orange permeate the nose. Tastes are fresh with citrus, lemon, grapefruit, grape, moderately bitter, finishes dry with faint pine. Not much for malt character; faint wheat. Mouth-feel is thinner than expected for a wheat ale, moderate carbonation. Overall, not bad, but comes across as drinking some sort of a lemon cleaner at times. I was hoping for some of the wheat and malt characteristics to come through, but hops prevail here."
""
""
""
"Overall, an interesting hoppy wheat."
"Pours a hazy yellow with a medium white head that has great retention and lacing. Aromas of a freshly mowed lawn. Taste begins with a huge lemon peel component, followed by a bit of saltine cracker, then a massive grassy, herbal flavor. Citrus aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good. Overall a quite good beer, but a little bit grassier tasting than I typically would like."
""
""
""
""
"Nice beer and certainly an enjoyable summer addition."
"Overall: I think my bottle may have been a little old which knocked down the aroma. The flavor was fine but not as hoppy as I was expecting, considering ""hoppy"" is in the name of the beer. Seems like a pale ale, just subbing in more wheat flavor instead of the barley. Nowhere near Gumballhead unfortunately."
""
""
"Overall - I really like this beer, as did my wife, which is shocking. I think it is well balanced, can be drank at anytime of the year (although fall is best), and is certainly worth the investment. Highly recommended, I may go buy a few more sixers so I have plenty. Good job Boulevard!"
""
""
""
""
"In appearance, this was defintely a wheat beer as it was golden in color with a white head that demonstrated carbonation. The aroma was a mild citrus with the sweetness of wheat in the background. The initial taste was sweet and hoppy. Notes of pineapple, peach and a little pine were evident. The sweetness of the wheat becomes more evident in the aftertaste as the hops fade. The carbonation is a little more potent than I might have expected, causing the fruity hops to be brushed away quickly. This is a smooth and easy drinker that could hit a wide audience. I would to see this beer become a staple in the Boulevard rotation."
""
"Overall a decent effort and a good brew."
""
""
"Overall not a bad wheat, just a bit to bland and a touch flawed to me."
"Light bodied, average carbonation, and a light lemon aftertaste. Crisp, easy to drink, and a nice beer to have on a warm autumn afternoon. Worth having again for sure."
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a slightly hazy straw color with a white head. The aroma has a good bit of pine, as well as some light orange citrus notes. There is also some nice wheat in the aroma. The flavor is very similar. The wheat really comes through up front, with some lighter pine and orange notes, as well as some grass and a bit of pepper. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice."
""
"Disappointed in this one, it tasted rancid and overly sweet. Not sure if I got a bad bottle, or what. Either way, I'm staying away from this one in the future."
""
"Feels refreshing and crisp, but also a slight dryness to the profile. This is the hoppiest wheat I've ever had!"
""
""
"American Pale Wheat Ale seems to be an emerging style that is predominately heading towards the refreshing fusion of a clean wheat beer with forward American hopping. 8 Acre out hops and beats another example from Boulevard's region, Tallgrass Halcyon, though it's no slouch."
"O: Overall, I really like this beer. It's a weird mix of a wheat beer and an ipa but it works. It's really enjoyable. I'd drink this beer again, no question about it."
"O: My first thought was disappointment for this, but the more of it I drank, the more I liked it. I expected more hop character, but actually enjoy the peppery, citrus, pine undertones. It's very, VERY light, and overall I expected more bang, but this an abive average pale wheat session ale. Perfect lawnmower brew."
"The focus is on the hops. This is what I'd want to drink during a run. It's fresh and clean but still has the wheat body to give it some substance. I'd take this over the regular Pale Wheat Ale any day."
""
""
""
""
"D/O: While this beer's application of hops isn't particularly inspired, it does reflect a purposeful step in the correct direction for the universe of American pale wheat ales. More interesting that a Bell's Oberon or Sam Adam's seasonal wheat-whatever, it could have benefited from a more aggressive application of Amarillo hops post-boil. Otherwise it is a solid wheat... which Boulevard should have pinned by now, right?"
""
""
"Another outstanding beer from the folks at Boulevard. A nice hoppy and refreshing brew. Summer just got a little more bearable."
"Finished with a clean, slight hop bitterness. Good beer and I would drink it again."
""
"o: impressed by this one."
""
"A crisp summer-sipper. I like the snap of this beer on the palate, but lacks depth and flavor profile."
""
"It's definitely a very different beer, and I like it. Wonderful for summer laziness. I'll definitely be drinking this one again. Great value too."
"Cheers..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A great addition to the Blvd roster - right there with Single-Wide in my book - hoppy, but not overblown. Tasty, but not pretentious."
""
"O: Man...this was almost really really good. But at the end, just when I expected some sweet & tart fruity hop flavors to take over near the swallow, the bready flavors take over in the hang. It definitely isn't a deal-breaker, but just enough to stop me from loving it. Definitely a solid beer, and I'm glad I had the chance to try it."
"12oz bottle from a sixer I picked up for $6.99, nice price. Bright yellow-orange color, sort of hazy appearance. Sticky lace, short head. Hoppy, citrusy smell, faintest hint of wheat and crackers. Flavor is slightly citrusy, hoppy, more faint wheat. I'd say this is more hop dominated but its not a hop bomb like say Lil' Sumpin Sumpin. Its quite easy to drink so"
""
""
"O: This is a pretty good beer but I still have to give the nod to Lil Sumpin' Sumpin' as the best Pale Wheat Ale I've had so far. I plan on drinking this one on occasion during the rest of the summer and years to come though."
"Nice smooth mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation. This beer will be a must in the summertime. I think Boulevard has done something special here. Right up there with little sumpin sumpin, oberon and gumballhead for me as top american wheats."
""
""
"Much anticipated. Pours a slightly hazy straw gold with a big-bubbled head of fizzy foam that collapses into thin lacing. Aroma is lightly citrusy with lemon drop, lime peel, and pineapple. More of the same on the palate. Subtle, but vibrant hoppiness with a faint background of crackery wheat. Clean, dry, and well carbonated. I was expecting an IPA level of hoppiness, which this is not. Just a slightly bigger and hoppier version of their wheat, but with a more nuanced and interesting hop character. I guess I can't say I'm disappointed since I have bought two sixers since its Oklahoma release last week. Certainly makes a great late summer beer."
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a overlayered, noisy beer. The complexity takes away from, rather than adds to the beer."
"This brew is great. True to the wheat ale style but with a nice refreshing hop kick that is lemony and citrusy without being a hop bomb. Nice earthy and grainy wheat notes with some nice herbal hop notes to back it up. My favorite of Blvds regular line up."
""
""
""
""
"O - This will be my new go-to Boulevard for when I want to enjoy multiple beers. The price is right and this is a great wheat style all it's own. Nice Job Boulevard!"
"O: Very well executed new entry by Boulevard. I believe this is going to be a year-round regular release, and may very well be my new favorite at this tier from Blvd."
"Very drinkable but not in the league of Lagunita's itteration"
""
""
"Overall, as others have said, I'm not getting so much hops, but I'm getting tons of fruit sweetness, and by God this is a delicious beer. There is hops in the finish, but by then you're so happy about the body that you couldn't care less."
"O- I am pleased. Boulevard calls this ""a delightfully distinctive ale with the aroma of and IPA and the refreshing taste of a wheat beer."" I think they got it right. This is an easy drinker that will make a great offering to an already solid line up."
"I wish it was a bit more harmonious but not a bad beer. I like it more than their wheat for sure. So I'd say it's worth trying at least once. Not bad, not great."
""
"I like Boulevard’s core lineup, but I don’t buy them often at all. I think that’s changed now with 80 Acre. I will be buying this one again soon, and I can’t wait to try it on tap somewhere. This is nice new beer by Boulevard, and I’m excited to see them offer something that’s a newer style."
""
"Be ready for a flavor that's a bit light, but in spite of that, this may be my new goto lawnmower beer for the summer months sub-planting the Bridgeport IPA's I've been keeping around. It's just a pleasure to gulp down even as you take in the aroma. A definite step up from Boulevard's mainstream beer Unfiltered Wheat."
"O - This is a delicious beer. I'm normally an IPA guy, so of course I like it. But this is more than just a great IPA or Wheat Beer alone. I'm glad to see that this is a year-round offering, because it has earned a permanent spot in my fridge."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy straw color with a white head. The aroma has a good bit of pine, as well as some light orange citrus notes. There is also some nice wheat in the aroma. The flavor is very similar. The wheat really comes through up front, with some lighter pine and orange notes, as well as some grass and a bit of pepper. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice."
""
""
"This should be available sometime this year (2012) according to the brewery in 6-pack bottles."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a tasty beer, reminiscent of Gumballhead and Little Sumpin Sumpin. Word is that this will appear in bottles sometime next year, and I know I'll be looking for it."
""
""
"O - This is a very good wheat ale. I can't wait til it is released to the general public."
"Overall- Never asked for the ABV but had to be between 4-5%. It was a nice, smooth beer, very enjoyable since it was so hot outside. Wasn't sure what I was going to be tasting here and still not 100% sure what I had. Almost tasted like a Hefeweizen with a lemon and hop twist. Not bad, not bad. If your ever at a festival or the Boulevard Brewing Co, this would be a great beer to start with!"
"I started getting strange with my analogy, let's just state this the way it is: Boulevard's Dry-Hop Unfiltered Wheat is an awesome drink that should be bottled and sold. Do it Boulevard. For realsies."
"I really hope that this... whatever it is (test batch, brewers' experiment, whatever) becomes an actual product in the future. This is every bit the peer of Lagunitas' Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale or Three Floyds' Gumbalhead in the category of hopped-up American Pale Wheat Ale. Super delicious and super drinkable. This deserves a wide release in bottles."
