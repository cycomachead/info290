"   I'll give Hop Sun (Summer Wheat Beer) - Southern Tier Brewing Company a 4.25 overall. This will probably will be a new warm weather staple for me."
"Hop Sun (Summer Wheat Beer) brewed by Southern Tier Brewing Company, with an ABV of 5.10%  This brew pours out a nice amber color with a nice white head. The smell is rich with flavors. You pick up grains and hops.  Now for the taste, it smooth but bold with flavor. You pick up on grains and malts in the taste of this brew.  Then there is mild bitterness of hops at the end of this brew. Southern Tier Brewing Company did a nice job with this one. There is nothing overpowering about this brew. Hop Sun has a nice balance to it.  The mouthfeel is nice clean and refreshing. This brew is a nice summer wheat beer.  I like how Hop Sun (Summer Wheat Beer) is different from most wheat brews on the market. One thing that stands out with Hop Sun is, this brew is filtered.  Overall I'm giving Hop Sun (Summer Wheat Beer) a 4.5 out of 5. I would buy this brew again."

"Pours a straw yellow with a fizzy head that dissipates quickly. The smell is full of citrus and floral notes to make a very bright scented beer. The taste was equally bright with hop notes coming first and then a bright wheat flavor that left hints of banana and clove to the beer. Very refreshing."

"06/09/12 At Shorty's 9th Ave. NYC. Had 1 on tap. Not as refreshing as they like to think. This brew is pleasant, but not a long distance summer quaffer. I like it but will keep looking for that perfect...whatever."

"It pours a light golden color with moderate head. It smells of lemony hops, and tastes like lemony hops and wheat. It goes down smooth and is refreshing while at the same time not sacrificing on flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint. Very golden in appearance. Smell is citrus/lemon and wheat. Nice taste. A lot of the reviews call this ""crisp"" and a nice summer beer and I would agree with that, although there is nothing outstanding about it. I will pick it up again sometime on a hot day."

"As you can see, this is a very clear beer. Had me worried initially. At first sip, I was thinking more like a Helles or Pils. May have had Sumpin' on the brain though. It started to show a little bit of crisp bite, but not much. Get a real nice mash aroma especially for just being in a pint glass. I find it really similar to a thinner/ lighter Boston Lager. Not sure how they got so much malt flavor in such a light colored/ bodied beer. If you love the smell of the rolling boil, give this one a try. At 5.1% and $10/6, this is a very drinkable and enjoyable summer brew."

"The best word I can use to describe Hop Sun is crisp. It has that light front of the tongue floral hop that breaks off really fast and as that refreshing almost pilsner aftertaste. A simple and complicated beer rolled into one."

"Poured a light clear gold with a creamier white head. Head has moderate retention but leaves nice lacing. The aroma is very mild, almost non-existent, with some very light hints of undefined hops. The taste is equally mild, it just has a little more flavor than the aroma indicated. There isn't really anything distinctive, especially from a wheat beer. It's a little thinner in weight and feel. I like the effort to make a flavorful summer beer that's lower ABV, but this one doesn't have the flavor to pull it off."

"From bottle into a pint glass, where it belongs... Nice 2 finger white head, hangs for a minute... Clear translucent yellow body.  Good carbonation. Smell is yeast wheat and citrus... Taste is crisp, clean, a bit hoppy..yum. Light, good seasonal summer beer.  I would recommend to friends."

"12 oz bottle poured into a wheat beer glass. Pours translucent pale straw with a foamy white head. Smells of some cirtus hops and a little sweetness from the wheat. Tastes of nice wheat taste with very slight hop tingle, slight fruitiness. Beer is light bodied nice carbonation, good finish. Overall a good beer."
""

"O/D - Very drinkable. Mellow but very flavourful character. Lovely hoppy wheat. Nice stuff."

"Poured from a 355ml bottle. Pours a deep, rich yellow. This is definitely a heavily filtered wheat beer. Nose is all about hops: pine, pineapple with a hint of tart apple. Taste is similar with a big hit of spicy, fruity hops. Great carbonation, creamy mouthfeel."

"O: This is an easy beer to drink. Its a good summer session beer. It has a super refreshing mouthfeel and good flavor, although it leaves me hungry for a bigger more complex beer. Overall this beer kind of reminds me of a diet IPA."

"O - A summer favorite, I cant believe I haven't reviewed this until now. This is an absolute go-to during hot weather for me. While there may be others that do this style better, I find the refreshing qualities of this beer along with a solid flavor to be what makes it stand out."
"Hop Sun is a fine summer drinking beer, suitable from late Spring but more full than a typical lawnmower beer. Off notes, however, do hold it back."
"Not ready for summer to go away. Pours a crystal clear light golden color with a nice fluffy white head that persists forever. Smells of lemon, cracked grain, light sugar and earthy and citrus hops. The flavor is light and refreshing with a spicy wheat grain against a light sweet sugary malt offset with some light lemony citrus hop. Light to medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Nice flavorful light easy drinking lawnmower beer."
""
""
""
"I guess it's a hoppy wheat beer as advertised; it's just lacking a bit. Comes off like a thin pale ale. I like the aroma and it's not ""bad"". But the combo just doesn't work for me and I wouldn't likely seek it out. Would much rather one of Souther Tier's other fine offerings."
""
""
"It's a refreshing brew. However, the taste is very much Pilsnerish, with a tiny bit of honey, lemon, and biscuits plopped into it. The finish is also quite dry. I probably wouldn't get it again."
"O- This beer reminds me very much of 312 Urban Wheat, which I guess they are similar lighter wheat beers. Just didn't much flavor at all from this one."

"Great summer session beer. Drink it on a bot, after mowing the lawn, after a great mountain bike ride. Nothing spectacular, but really drinkable."

"Overall, this might be my new favorite APWA. It manages to bring in a very hop forward profile (like a couple of other hoppy wheats I could name), but does so with great balance and subtlety. A perfect summertime beer."

"O. The aromas take a while to show up here. Otherwise, a fine summer brew."
"O - Absurdly drinkable. I'm reviewing the last of three that I have received as gifts this summer and I am sad to see them go. I've been enjoying the wheat beers that have come out this summer, both the traditional German style, as well as the versions that showcase the more citrusy hops. This is a solid addition to the Ommegang and Boulevard offerings."

"Clear w/ pillowy head. Good nose of mild citrus, spice & bready malt. First notes of pine, lemongrass followed by notes that are crisp, tangy from yeast & wheat. Fine bitterness, cracker-like + carbonation that enhances the smooth mouthfeel of this brew. A very good American wheat style."
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours like spun gold. Brilliant clarity. A pillowy head that fell lazy like a summer day to a thick cap and left all kinds of lace to look at. Nose is beer delight. Mild citrus, floral a little spice and a lightly breaddy malt. Pale malt has hints of sweetness, wheat is tall. Light pine, lemongrass and a touch of earth. Looks like sunshine in the glass and smells like it too. The lemon really comes forward sweetly as the beer warms. Taste is light, crisp and clean. Fruity lemon, grass, refreshing wheat, a little tangy. Has a fine bitter that doesn’t overwhelm but plays with the sour aspect of the wheat and finishes with a little cracker and not so much honey. The body is smooth and it drinks refreshing . You don’t even notice the carbonation it goes down so easy. Really excellent."
""
""
"Taste starts with bready light malts, then wheat, and has a wheaty citrus zest finish. Has a bready and slight zesty aftertaste. Body is very light with extremely high carbonation. This is definitley not your standard wheat beer, but I found it a very refreshing and drinkable summer beer."
""
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 3/20/2013. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of lemon, orange zest, floral, pine, grass, wheat, bread, light honey, and floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt and hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, orange zest, grapefruit, floral, grass, light honey, wheat, bread, light pine, and floral earthiness. Slight floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, floral, grass, light honey, wheat, bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance of hop and malt flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice pale wheat ale. Nice balance of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O - I am not much of a wheat beer fan -- I only sample them to work on my Karma but this was truely different. Much more likeable flavor. Not as harsh as your typical wheat. Can say I would buy this again"

"Poured this one into a glass, and it has a yellow color body with a small head. The smell has a citrus hop aroma with a quick malt hint in there also. The taste is refreshing of citrus and hops and some wheat, not much else going on. The mouth feel is very smooth and well carbonated.. Overall this is a really good, easy drinking beer and is refreshing also."
""
"D: very herbal. a little too tea-like one-note for me. not sure if this is a past its prime issue (as the born-on date was a bit blurred). not my ideal summer brew, but not a bad beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a glass mug. The beer pours clear golden with a thin, white head and lots of visible carbonation. The beer smells of lemon and pine, but not in an overpowering manner. I get some of the pale malt and the wheat in the smell as well, which brings a nice light breadiness. The flavor is pretty hop forward for the typical American wheat beer, but like in the aroma, the citrus and pine don't overpower. There's some nice back end piney bitterness. I also get some of the lightly bready malt, which provides some nice backbone. The body is light to medium with high carbonation. The beer is highly drinkable and goes down smoothly. This is an excellent beer."
"A really refreshing Wheat Beer that tastes like everyone’s favorite breakfast cereal!"
""

"Overall its a tasty summertime brew. Perfect for the warm weather. Not a bad intro for those moving from wheat beers to pale ales."

"O - Not what the doctor ordered, its not your typical wheat beer here. Its not a drain pour by any stretch; by contrast, not a bad summer beer. Close to a pilsner though."

"Poured from tap at tap and mallet Rochester. Pours a golden clear color with no head. Mellow hop and pine aromas...some lemon. Taste is wheaty mellow hops with a big lemon finish. Its somewhat bitter but still pleasant. Its easy to drink and a nice summer brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This one's okay. Maybe I'd like it better on a warmer afternoon (summer brews in April, what's next...Oktoberfest brews in August? Wait don't answer that) All in all, I'm a bit let down considering how much I enjoy a great hoppy wheat ale. Having said that, it's worth trying, if not seeking out."

""
""
""
"Overall - a decent showing for a wheat beer, but I have had some that I like more. A little better than average."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a solid summer, sessionable hoppy wheat beer. Nothing too revolutionary and I think the wheat and pale malt sweetness are a bit distracting. They take away from being able to identify the hop aromas and flavors and while I normally enjoy a nice balance in my beers, session beers needs to stand out in one way or another of just come across borning and weak bodied."
""
""
""
"Overall - An excellent wheat ale... so drinkable and refreshing.. recommended..."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, pale yellow color with a bubbly white head. Scent is very sweet with wheat and citrus tones with some hints of hops. Has a smooth mellow taste with a hint of bitterness that turns into a dry, organic wheat after taste. Starts off refreshing, but then goes into this bad pale ale type taste. Interesting, but not something I look for in a wheat beer personally."
""
""
""
"o - Overall a nice wheat beer. Ton of citrus in the taste which is awesome, and easy to drink. A nice, easy drinking summer beer."
"Overall: Goes down easy. A bit light on the wheat, too heavy on the hops. More bitter than sweet."
""
""
"Mouthfeel: This is a medium-light bodied beer that is easy drinking and smooth on the palate. Hop Sun is another great hot summer day beer that goes down as easy as any BMC."
"O: Great summer beer; light body and easy drinking; has some nice wheat and hop character."
"O: Truth be told, not a huge fan of this style. I was told this was a very good example of it, and it does have some more hop flavor than others I've had of this style. It is very drinkable on a hot day, but definitely not all that interesting of a beer."
""

"Overall: Great summer wheat beer with well-thought balances of flavors."

"Growler from GBX poured into a pint glass. Nice clear golden pour with a generous 2 finger head. Smell was hop forward with the piney, floural hit that settles into some of the bready malts and cloves. A bit strong on the hop smell was distracting. Taste was also hop forward with te pine hitting initially followed by floral and malts. A good hit of bitterness at the end. Some of the cloves and fruit are felt in the middle. Pretty well balanced after the hop hit. I prefer more bread, malts on my wheats, but this was interesting. ST usually goes over the top with their styles and this is definately different. Feel was okay with some hop dryness and quite a bit of carb. Overall- AN intersting take on the style. A bit too hop forward for me, but worth the try. Pretty complex for a summer brew. Wouldn't turn one down-"
""
""
""
""
"The was crisp and smooth. Drinkability was good, the beer went down quick and easy. Overall, a decent beer for a summer refresher. there are better, and much worse, options available. Probably worth a shot."
""
""
""
"O: A very easy to drink and enjoyable summer beer, went down quite easily on a warm summer evening at the local pub (with the windows open and fresh air). Easily sessionable and one I would likely get another time."
""
""
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a light orange straw with a half finger white head that dissipates to a ring around the glass and lacy film. Light aroma of wheat, sweet malt and a hint of lemon. Flavor follows aroma with wheat, malt, light bittering hops and a hint of citrus. Finishes with a light but distinct wheat flavor, with the residual sweetness, faintly of graham cracker. A nice subtly flavored light wheat ale. The flavor components were nice and well balanced, but I wish they were a little more assertive. Light bodied, which is appropriate for the style. Still a good summer sipping beer, which is what it offers."
""
""
""
""
"O: Extremely easy to drink and very refreshing, this is the kind of beer that ought to be a staple of easy drinking in the summertime. Its pleasant flavor guides things along well."
""
"Overall it looks like a macro, doesn't taste like one, but doesn't even taste like a decent APWA either. Pass on this one."

"Overall: A very tasty summer seasonal. Crisp, clean and very refreshing. I'm not always a Southern Tier fan but I'm enjoying Hop Sun very much."
"This is one of the best wheat beers I've had and the next time I get my hands on some FFF Gumballhead, I will give it a shot at the title. It drinks as if the brewers decided to make a perfectly balanced wheat beer, then at the last minute tossed in some extra hops. If I had to criticize it, I would say I wish it was a bit more carbonated and had just a bit more sparkle. Next, I might try a blend of hops instead of just one. Other than that, I wouldn't change much. It is always nice when brewers make dull styles interesting. ST did it here. Very, very well done."

"The beer pours like a clear, filtered, american lager; a straw yellow color with 10 seconds of a loose, white head...that definitely doesn't lace. The nose is sweet and slightly floral, but the hops are all in the taste and mouthfeel. Initial sweetness from the malt casts a light, lingering bitterness that remains floral and balanced. The mouth is slightly watery and it's definitely a drinkable summer ale. Once the beer warms it becomes even more lager-like with a bigger, fruitier backbone from the malt/wheat and almost no spice... Don't drink this beer if you're looking for hops."
""
""
""
"Despite the incredibly subtle aroma, Southern Tier's Hop Sun is still a decent American pale wheat ale. I could see this being a nice hot weather beer."

"O: Very enjoyable and worth seeking out."
""
"O: Certainly easy to drink but was expecting more from this beer. Maybe I am just drinking it in the wrong setting (indoors, spring). Might try once more in summer to see if a different impression."

""
""
"Pours a darker yellow with a frothy white head that fades fast. Smell is inviting, a nice hop aroma with some hints of pine. The taste is a nice duo of hop and malt. Neither overpower the other, but you get a nice depth of flavor with each. The beer ends with the hop and a hint of sweetness. A nice medium mouthfeel, good balance in flavor and good carbonation. No missteps here, just a good quality beer with nice flavors. A nice beer worth checking out, a great summer beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured on-tap and served in a weisse vase, the beer is a bright, vibrant, honey-gold color with a steady flow of carbonation and a light, fluffy, off-white head about a half an inch in height. Aromas are subtle, with a roasted grain and slight hop blending. Flavors are much more pronounced, with a heavy toasted backbone giving rise to a light, citrus and floral hops profile. Tangy, crisp mouthfeel at the end of the brew, with a roasty and hoppy aftertaste. Very interesting dynamic. The finish is astringent and slightly sharp, with a slight linger. Good, tasty brew that gives a different vibe to a Wheat beer."

"O- Overall, this beer will definitely be added to my spring/summer beer rotation. Highly recommended!"

"Absolutely refreshing. A jewel among beers of the style. Best kept simple and served cold. 4.0"
"Overall: Simple, well-done all day summer BBQ beer."

"Overall: the slight bitter finish hurts the drinkablity for beers of this genre. Well balanced flavor however overall."

"I don't think I'd had a summer beer that tasty since I've been drinking beer! I like how it was a light beer, but still was very flavorful. Even if you're not a hop fan, this beer will be good! The hops are present in the taste, but the bitterness is so mild. The mouthfeel with the taste of the wheat and malt plays so well overall in the beer. A+ for Southern Tier. Can we get this year-round please?!?!?"

"D/O: Very enjoyable. Light, refreshing, and well balanced. Next summer, I want a keg of this instead of Oberon."

"Bottle.Shaker glass.Enjoyed on jul´11.Bright golden color.White foam. Close,dense with fairly good retention crown.Floral,bready & yeasty aromas.Crisp hoppy & bready flavor.Undelying citric notes,smooth peppery touch. Mildy malts leave hoppy hints in mouth.Slightly buttery,mildy citric palate. Medium body,medium carbonation.Malty finish,hops on the aftertaste."

"Beer is medium in body, pretty sweet, light on the finish and bitterness, light on the hops throughout, basically a little candied orange peel and that's about it, not a repeat."
""
""
"O – Not bad, but the low carbonation hurts the profile."
"O - It was actually better than I anticipated. It had a lot of flavor for the style. It was a little on the hoppy side but quite good."
""
""
"Clear golden color - a bit too 'clear' for a wheat beer in my opinion. Soapy head with little to no retention on the glass. Nice fruity aroma with lemon and a subtle coconut scent coming through. The taste is grainy yet bittersweet and refreshing. Nice light mouthfeel and a good finish. A flavorful beer that is definitely good for the summer I'm sure but all in all nothing to write home about."

"Overall this is a fresh and interesting American wheat but I really don't like this much hop bitterness in my wheat beers."

"Poured from the bottle into my favorite pint glass. Foamy head disippating quickly into a thin layer of foam. Nice bright color, appealing look. Little bit of typical banana clove smell mixed with a nice hop presence. I really liked the mix of traditional wheat flavor and hops. The mouthfeel was great and easy drinking. I loved this and will seek it out next summer."
"O: My favorite summer beer so far. Very refreshing and easy to down."
"Nice soft wheat flavors with a grassy hoppyness. A nice soft, crisp drinking beer that's great for the summer time."
"Crisp and light, hint of bitter. Floral flavors . This is a good summer beer that is easily drinkable, but I don't notice anything that makes me like it more than just a average beer. This is really just an average beer ."
"A very nice summer offering...very drinkable and refreshing. In line with, but, a tick below Lil' Sumpin and two ticks below Gumballhead"
"O - Very enjoyable beer anytime. I can understand why this would be a summer beer though as it would do wonders on a hot day."
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 5/4/11. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear light gold color with about a half inch white head that went away pretty quickly. There's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is a bit light overall, the brew smells like wheat, lemon peel and sweet malt. The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but there's the addition of some grassy hops. Luckily the taste is much stronger than the aroma is. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's crisp and easy to drink with moderate carbonation. I think it's a decent brew, but next time I'll have to try a fresher bottle. Worth a try."
"For me, this is a ""meh"" beer. It's not bad, but I don't like it all that much. I've been drinking a lot of wheat ales this summer, and this is not in the upper tier of those I've had. Not much complexity to the flavor, mouthfeel is blah, and it's just not all that refreshing (which I want from a summer wheat)."
"this is the 3rd beer that I have had from southern tier. All 3 have been very good. The Hop Sun summer seasonal is a great combo of hoppiness and smooth drinkability. The color is a beautiful golden. The smell is sweet citrus and hops. The flavor delivers. The sweet lemon and orange blends well with the piney hoppiness. The only regret I have is that I discovered this beer so late in the summer, it's time for the fall beers to start rollin out, and I can't wait."
"Sampled on August 15, 2011. The pour is pale yellow with short lived fizzy white head that diminishes to nothing in no time. It is the lemon gras that takes oiver the aroma on first whiff so it is very summer-like in that regard. The wheat and hops are more subdued. The light body doesn't make you have to try to hard on a hot summer day. The taste is also zinging with lemon with muted malt flavor and a pungent but clean hop finish. A nice way to enjoy the dog days of August."
"D: Hm. Maybe the ""hop"" in this ""Hop Sun"" would be more pronounced fresher. Overall however, it's a very drinkable wheat beer with a well pronounced wheat taste."
"Pours a shiny, clear sunny color, effervescent, head is fluffy and white, sticks around for a while. Smell is of toasted wheat, some citrus notes, even floral as well. Taste comes across in the form of a very balanced wheat and citrus combination. Has a tang to it. Crisp and refreshing. Southern Tier rarely fails to disappoint. A new summer favorite."
"Overall: This really impressed me. This brew does a great job upping the hop flavors while still maintaining a light wheat body. Probably the best summer ale I've tasted so far."
"O: I like the american hop presence and lack of a big presence from the wheat or yeast. Sort of a poor man's gumballhead."
"O - I'm not a fan of the style overall, but this drank very well on a hot day. I'd get it again."
"Yeasty and husky grains aplenty along with a nice snappy lemon presence in the nose. Along with the lemony bite of wheat, a combo of earthy/spicy/citric hop notes make for quite a flavorful brew. Some lingering sweetness blunts the crispness of the finish, but it's overall pretty lively and goes down easy. Nice choice for escaping the heat on my front porch."
"This its a pretty flavorful summer wheat beer here. Unlike many, it has a good hop presence and balance. Very refreshing."
"Impressed with this immediately. The nose got me. Far more hops comes through in the nose than one would expect. On the palate the wheat and hops blend well to create a rather enjoyable beer. Mouthfeel is crisp and light. Probably one of the best summer beers I've had in a while."
"Greg Koch be danged, I like the visual of ""fizzy yellow beers"" and I do not care what he (or others) think of me. This got me a finger of rocky, bone-white head with great retention. Color was sunshine yellow with NE-quality clarity. It looked like summer in a glass. I would actually consider putting one aside for a dull, dreary day in mid-February when a pick-me-up might be nice. Nose was at once grassy and lemony, very evocative of summer. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a very grassy taste on the tongue. The bottle mentioned ""... 1 variety of hops and 3 types of malts"" and I would be curious to know what they were. This was very tasty, very refreshing and very welcome on a slow summer day. Finish was semi-dry and quite grassy."
"O: best for the very hot days with outdoor activities, baseball, grilling, the lake"
"I was unimpressed by the summer offering from Southern Tier several years ago when I first tried it and I am unimpressed now. For a good summer offering look elsewhere."
"O - It's good, not setting the world on fire, then again, I've grown quite fond of their ""big beers", so this one naturally tastes too thin to me. The other factor, not sure how old thi sbottle is since I bought it recently as a single (on sale which makes me nervous). It's O.K., but I'm willing to give this one another try if I know for sure the bottle is fresh."
"Overall, this is a good summer time beer but it needs some more flavor. This is my second Southern Tier beer and I've yet to be really impressed."
"Awesome beer for a scorching hot summer day like the one on which I enjoyed it, by the pool in South Florida. Clear pale color with a pillowy white head, nice aromas. Taste is lovely, with muted wheat and yeast, the hops come to the fore in a lemony, grassy way. Bitterness is restrained. Extremely drinkable, very quenching. Kind of surprising in the way it combines the traditional wheat flavors with modern American hop profile. I really liked this one."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavor and aroma are very solid, the beer just falls a bit short in the mouthfeel department. A bit more body and this could have been better."
"Clear light-gold colored brew, very large pillowy white head topping it off. Light scent, a touch of hops on top of a sweet malty scent. Nice light taste, pretty yeasty, light wheat grain, kiss of hops, a touch of lemon and grass. Pretty full bodied and soft. A nice light summer brew, perfect on this very hot day."
"O- A delightful summer ale, and competently done. It's not something that inspires reams of prose, but it's a tasty beer for a hot summer evening."
"Very refreshing. Delicious. Highly recommended."
"Biggest surprise is that this is a wheat beer. Overall, unremarkable."
"O/D: This is a great and easy beer to put down. Could definitely see drinking a lot of this in the summer, wanting to get a hop fix, while choosing something on the lighter side. One of the best in the style I've had."
"Pours a bright, lite golden-yellow. A white ring hangs around. Doesn't appear very carbonated. Smell is sort of muddied, yet lemony. Taste starts off with some mild, twangy hops mixed with a milder wheat base, and then folds into a dry-hopped neverland. Feel is sharp and thin. Meh - I am not impressed."
"One of my favorite summer wheat beers."
"Poured a slightly hazy copper color with a fairly active head. Smell was of wheat, also slightly grassy. Taste was first of wheat, followed by a nice hop sensation to dry it out, but the more I drank, the more the hop flavor came through for me, sort of overwhelming the wheat. Mouthfeel was good. Overall, this tasted pretty much like other good quality pale ales, but with a wheat note in there somewhere."
"Overall: decent beer from Southern Tier (hey, that rhymes!). Its nice and hoppy while being refreshing and a good example of a summer beer. Certainly worth a try if you're looking for a lawnmower beer. Cheers!"
"This is a sharp and crisp thirst quencher for a very hot early June day. I could use a little more body but the ale is extremely quaffable. It tastes better after it warms slightly in the glass."
"O - Pretty good for a style I'm not normall crazy about, definitly a solid summer ale. Minus"
"D - A simple and refreshing American Pale Wheat Ale that makes for a terrific seasonal offering..."
"O-this surprisingly goes down very quickly for a summer pale wheat. this is very impressive. the after-taste is quite complex and i love the bitterness within. it seems to bridge a gap between a pale wheat ale and a hoppier American Pale Ale."
"The HopSun was actually something that I like quite a bit. The pour of the beer was a cloudy yellowish orange color with a fluffy white head on it. The smell of the beer had a great mix of citrus and a gentle aroma of fresh wheat. The nose was very well balanced here. The taste reflected the same way, it was a nice wheat sweetness very mild upfront with a nice hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is mostly like any other wheat ale out there. It's bright and lively, also very refreshing for the summer season. Good stuff!"
"O: Nope. Not on board with this one. (1)"
"overall, this is what it is. an enjoyable, tasty summer offering; nothing more, nothing less. perfect for those july and august barbeques."
"12oz bottle. Pours a translucent light golden color with a small amount of head. Virtually no lacing. Aroma is floral hops and grains with hints of citrus hops and cut grass. Smells really good for a summer beer. Flavor is mostly of grains with a nice amount of hop bitterness. Some obligatory summer beer lemon as well. Pretty smooth and perfect for the warm weather. Solid amount of hops as well. Very light for a wheat beer but I'm guessing that's the point of this one. Overall, this is one of the best and most flavorful summer beers I've had. It is not unlike the 'Gansett Summer which also has a good amount of hop flavor. I'll be grabbing more of these for sure."
"O-A summer beer with Hops!!! Usually summer beers are not to my liking as they are too light but Hop Sun has enough hops present to keep a hop head happy."
"All-in-all a pretty decent beer."
"Overall- These hoppy wheat beers seem to be all the rage. Its no Gumballhead or Lil Sumpin, probably not even as good as Oberon, but its alright."
"O: A pretty good beer overall. Good beer to drink on a hot summer day."
"Overall I could see picking up a sixer of this. Was better than the 422 but I still prefer the Pale since they have two hop variety's. Still a very solid summer offering from ST."
"O/D-Overall, this is pretty nice. I am a flavor of the hop component in this brew. Is a great balance between flavor and light body. A six pack is perfect, I am glad to try it. It reminds me of Narragansett Summer. Except I may like Gansett's a bit better. But I will say that the six-pack of this went down far too easily. One of my more preferred summer seasonals."
"It's filtered clearer than the 422, for sure, though a vague wheat haze is certainly still apparent. Head's less durable than I'd hoped. Dude, just up (or change) the hops a bit, don't be shy, and this could rock my world (well, night? morning?). You have a decent beer regardless of my finicky, fickle tastes."
"Pours a hazy straw. Bone white head and lots of lace. Smells like a wheat beer, a little citrus hops too. In the flavor, wheat malt and a nice rind like bitterness. All the sweetness attributed to the wheat malt and yeast are bastardized by American hop additions (bittering variety). Tastes like a bitter pale wheat ale overall. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a sharp hop bite. Overall, a pretty interesting mesh of styles. If you like hops and wheat this beer is for you."
"Overall this beer is good. It won't blow you away but will be refreshing. Since it's made for the hot summer it's great that you could have a few and still enjoy them."
"O - Overall this is an awesome summer/lawnmower beer. Great refreshing wheat and grain notes balanced out by some nice hop notes."
"Overall summer beers tend to be great (oberon) or so so. I do not believe I will buy it again. its worth trying."
"D- 3.5 Though I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of this brew, I was relatively unimpressed overall. I could swig a couple, maybe, but I don't know that I'd seek it out again. It's probably more of a style issue than anything for me because I've really liked all of the other Southern Tier brews I've had at this point. Not bad, not great... I suppose it's worth a chance if you're a fan of wheats."
"Light body, active carbonation. Easy drinking, just what I was looking for after hitting some gold balls."
"Poured a very bright golden yellow, huge white billowing head, decent retention. Nice side glass lace, good cloudy appearence, lots of carbonation. Very light, lots of yeast with a touch of some lemon maybe, light in aromas, not in overall strength of smell. Very very nice, light palate with a bigtime yeast presence. Lots of grain with a hint of lemon or some other kind of bitter hops, great flavors. One of the best haefe flavor profiles I have tasted. Crisp, clean. very nice carbonation. Great overall feel. Superb, could drink this all night long. Was great when first cold, even better as it warmed up."
"It is nice to have Southern Tier here in Kentucky, but so far I’ve been pretty unimpressed by what we’re getting. I hope we get their stouts here soon, but their IPAs are ok at best."
"Overall - A good spring/summer beer to have on a hot day. Low alcohol and easy to drink. Nothing special here, just a decent easy drinker."
"D/O: Very clean and very drinkable but doesnt have a lot of weight to it. Very much has some big characteristics but does not give you much of an overall flavorful beer."
"O: I could drink this every day of the summer. The taste is clean and crisp, the mouthfeel is light. The hops and wheat play well off of each other to provide the drinker with a really great and refreshing beer. Not a typical wheat beer, and not your typical summer beer. Really great drinking. Defnitely worth checking out."
"O: The beer looked the part and felt the part, but I felt it was lacking with the hop profile. This is a solid offering, just not the best of the style. Skal."
"Love it."
"I think this is a really enjoyable seasonal beer. I would pick this up again, especially when the weather heats up."
"It'd be very easy to put back a 6-pack of this on a hot summer day, but the hop profile isn't my favorite."
"Overall: A very good summer time (lawn mower, pool party) beer, however I prefer this on tap than in the bottle."
"O-Overall a solid summer seasonal. I was looking for a different type of summer beer to try and Southern Tier did not disappoint. Very drinkable and reminds you of summer."
"O - Unimpressed. Only because this beer did not seem significantly different than Southern Tier's 422 Pale Wheat Ale. For a summer seasonal, this beer did not have enough significance or character to really warrant notice. Drink 422 or Hop Sun in the summer, but not both. Essentially the same beer. Still good. Just not different enough."
"A clear yellow slightly copper pour with almost no bubbles and a descent head that disappeared quickly but clung to the sides and left a solid amount of lacing. The aroma is dominated by some grassy, somewhat citrus hops. I'm thinking its simcoe by the slight earthy twist. I can't get much out of the body besides the hops. There is a lot of grass and lemon peel along with only a faint hint of wheat. An earthy lemon grass aftertaste and bitterness. Not too dry but the bitterness clings ridiculously. The abundance of earthy hops do not compliment the wheat body. I don't think the malt bill holds up to the hops."
"Like Three Floyds Gumballhead, Hop Sun has a crisp cracker-like wheaty taste that only shows it's maltiness in finish and aftertaste. It's all about the hops. It also reminds me a bit of Abita's Purple Haze, just better with the base beer and a focus on hops rather than the fruit."
"The mouthfeel is light and fairly carbonated, and the drinkability is quite good. Overall, this is an alright beer. Not the best I've had, but it's surely drinkable."
"Southern Tier Hop Sun has a yellow colour and a 3 mm that that fades away quickly. The smell is grainy with a hint of hops. The taste is a little sour up front with some hop bitterness. Nothing special. The mouthfeel is not that foamy. Overall, a decent session beer."

"This beer is confusing because its labeled as a summer wheat beer, but it smells like a pilsner, it looks like a pilsner...walks like a duck, talks like a duck. It pours a brillantly clear straw color with a disipating white fizzy head, very effervesent. The initial aroma is grassy hops but the longer it sits the more malt comes through. The mouthfeel is medium light, medium-high carbonation and high astringency. The flavor is of grassy hops with a medium bitterness. There is a solid malt backbone that quickly takes over with less wheat character than I expected. It finishes nice and dry and is more tolerant to warming up than your average big brewery pilsner. I know that American Wheats can be more aggressively hopped than the European versions, I'm just not getting enough wheat to consider it a wheat. Very refreshing though with high drinkability...your perfect grilling, horseshoes, after mowing the lawn, cleaning out the garage type of beer."
"As far as American wheat beers go, this is one of the better ones I have tried. Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a tall white that dissipates at a pretty average rate. Smell is Some wheat and some hops with a bit of citrus in there too. Taste is well balanced between hops and wheat. Sumpin sumpin and gumballhead have a little too much hops IMO (not saying they aren't great) so I like the balance that southern tier displays. Mouthfeel is medium wolith average carbonation. Overall, enjoyable summer beer. I'd certainly pay for another."
"Pours clear golden in color with white crystal, bubbly head that sticks around for a while. Wheat, sugar, floral, and sweet grains in the nose. Tastes of wheat, floral notes, slight honey and then hop backbone slaps the tongue and lasts for a dry finish. Light in body with crisp carbonation. Highly drinkable and refreshing. The hop presence is used perfectly to counter the sweetness of the wheat."
"The pale golden body was clear, and had a one finger thick foamy head fed by lively carbonation. The looks were more similar to an APA, and so was the muted hop aroma. This lacked any of the clove, banana, bubblegum wheat beer smells. The taste was a bit more wheaty, as the spicy hop bitterness was backed by a sweetness tinged with juicy fruit gum. The beer was very easy to drink, as should be the case for a summer seasonal, and there was a lingering sweet aftertaste. Picked up out of season as a one off at Green's, but will have to look for this during the dog days."
"I think I may have been expecting too much from this beer or something. I had heard it was good and picked it up as part of a build your own 6 pack. When I got home and tried it, it was more bitter than I was expecting. Not a lot of wheat flavor. Not a bad beer, I'll give it another shot sometime."
"D- Very easy to drink, no overwhelming flavor good balance with the hops. Wish there was a bit more wheat flavor."
"Though it may not be summer, I still feel that it's not cold enough to be out of season. This beer pours a light golden color with a puffy white head that leaves a nice lacing on the surface and down the glass. There is a decent aromatic hop quality when the head is present, but fades to a slight only citrus hint when the head fades away. The taste is surprisingly not too bitter. There is a good balance of malty sweetness and the citric acid from the hops. A light lemony zest feel to the flavor, it's rather nice for a hot summer day. The mouthfeel is a bit thicker than I would like to see it for something that is to be consumed in the summer sun. But for all times of the year it's not bad at all. This is a fairly nice drinking beer, but I feel it's not nearly as light as I would like it to be, though not really bad due to the crispness that it seems to bring to the table anyway. A pleasant beer and a good find."
"Drinkability is decent. I'm not sure I'd reach for another but if it was put in front of me I'd have no trouble drinking it."
"O: Average beer, but below average for Southern Tier."
"Drink - This beer was not what I was expecting; I thought it would be more of a wheat beer. Turns out to taste like a nice light and refreshing IPA. I really liked this one, and could see myself drinking it over and over again. Very highly sessionable."
"This has been a Southern Tier weekend for me (just came to Columbus). These folks know what they're doing."
"not a particularly wheat malt developed american wheat. Pour is golden orange and almost clear. Nose is a subtle grapefruit. And a palate that seems more hear to express hop freshness and anything but creamy hef traits. Although it has a nice brisk american blonde quality. Its not protein finish husky. Some centennial hop bitter. Poor malt core, but bright."
"Very drinkable beer, would compare to a nice summer session beer with a bit more hops. Not an IPA by an means, but agood beer for a hop head having a summer BBQ."
"This is definitely on the more mild side. Wasn't bad in any way, I just thought for some reason this would cater to hopheads. I'd drink it first beer of the day anytime though."
"Pale pilsner-like yellow color. Good head and residual lacing down the glass. Well balanced aroma of hops and malt. Slightly bitter citrus (grapefruit? bitter orange?) after taste. A little watery and thin which makes it very drinkable and thirst quenching - maybe good for long sessions."
"This beer has high carbonation but in other ways is a fairly thin, light refreshing beer. I liked a lot of the parts & this strikes me as a great lawnmower beer or a great beer to convert a BMC drinker to craft beer. Not super exciting but nice & easy to drink."
"Poured very pale yellow with little head.. Goes down quite easy but no real taste popped out for me.. Maybe because was drinking ayinger beers prior to this sample.. Does go down very easy so going to try another sample next year... Will have to have this on a hot summer day"
"- A great pale... very nice... and I could drink this a lot..."
"This beer poured a golden color with a good sized head that lasted throughout the beer. It had a pleasten smell very light just a little bit of hops, a good wheat smell too. The tasted had just a hint of hops, a strong wheat like taste, maybe a hint of citruis too. A lighter flavor made it easy to drink. Overall a really nice beer espically on a hot day."
"This one was a half-recommendation from my man down at Whole Foods. It pours a clear pale straw topped by a thick mass of white froth. The nose comprises coriander, wheat, light vague citrus, and a dash of cardamom. The taste tones the spices down a bit, and a good amount of orange-peel bitterness is introduced in lieu thereof. The body is quite light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly crisp finish. Overall, a very plain, uninteresting brew, but rather highly drinkable and, for those who stick to seasonal drinking schedules, a very nice summer beer."
"Drinkability is a little rough, in that it feels like an 8%ABV beer, even though it's under 5%. That being said, it is by far the most pronounced set of flavors I've ever experienced from a beer below 5%."
"On the hole I would have to say this is up there with my favorite summer beers. I wasn't disappointed at all."
"DB/Conclusion- Too zesty and bitterness feels out of place. Almost medicinal and grassy. First real ST letdown for me. Refreshment and mouthfeel is all I take out of this one. I finally realize it tastes like... corn."
"Light and softly carbonated this beer flowed down nice and easy on a hot summers day. Really pronouced all the great qualities of the wheat. I'm very impressed."
"Taste-Wheat, lemon zest, crisp, with a nice little hop bite. To me this beer tastes more along the lines of a Czech pilsener with some wheat thrown in. That being said, it is very refreshing and easy to drink. I would not turn one down."
"Very thin and easy drinking beer here, thin bodied as you can see from appearence. A nice prick from the carb but this is overall smooth. No trace of alcohol, this is pretty tame. Not really my thing but it was enjoyable to a degree."
"Pours a yellowish almost orange color with a one finger head which gives way to some lacing. The aroma is of a nice bready backbone with citrus notes present and a slight hop smell. The taste has a wheat, bread backbone with a nice orange and lemon taste as well as a slight earthy hop bite to it. The mouthfeel is moderately to heavily carbonated. The drinkability is high, a very easy drink, well balanced and a nice flavor. A great beer sitting outside on a hot day."
"very clear yellow/orange color with a nice large head that holds up pretty well. smells of wheat and citrus but not much else, although it does have a refreshing quality to it. very crisp nice flavor. just a tiny hint of hops and nice lemony notes with no bitterness. The beer is a bit thin, but that's just the way it should be. I could drink tons of these on a hot summer day. It's refreshing but not bland and leaves no aftertaste which is something I like in my summer brews."
"Overall, this immediately jumps up to my favorite summer wheat ale. It doesn't sacrifice balance or flavor at any point, but manages to stay drinkable and refreshing. More than anything, the hop character being used with discretion really impressed me."
"D: A very solid American Wheat ale that leans towards the bitter side, putting it slightly out of style... but that's the way a lot of these beers seem to be going now. Very tasty."
"went down really easy while playing a couple holes of disc golf yesterday. ill definatly be picking this up again, maybe even a case. southern tier makes some really great sessionals. old man winter, harvest ale, and now hopsun. highly recommended in my book!"
"very drinkable. if i had another 3 or 4 bottles, it'd be no problem."
"Pours a nice clean golden yellow with a disappearing white head. Moderate lacing. Smells of wheat malt with a bit of lemon citrus in the background. Sweet wheat/bready malt to start before grassy and lemon hops kick in for the finish. Everything about the flavor is very subtle, but well done. Meshes well together. Very crisp, fresh and clean taste. What a summer brew should be. Refreshing and drinkable."
"Beer is a light gold with a thin head that quickly dissipates. Smell is malty with a little bit of lemon. Taste is malty with a bit of hop bitterness. Not too much going on here, but it tastes fine. Mouthfeel is fine and the beer is definitely drinkable. It's quite light. All in all, this beer doesn't do much for me. Perhaps it's because I've had a lot of super-hoppy IPAs and DIPAs lately, so this tastes light. Nevertheless, this is a fine wheat beer. It's not like there is anything wrong with it, but it wasn't that exciting to me, either."
"D - love the style (hop heavy Wheats), like this one. really needs a bigger body as a base as it is very watery and light."
"Hop Sun is an impressive Summer sort of beer, as it were. Recommended for a post-bike ride refresher, or for whatever suits your fancy this time of year."
"Clear piss yellow appearance with a fluffy head. Nice lacing. Smell has hops and lemon dominating with some grassy aromas in back. Taste is hoppy up front with lemon and wheat as it receeds with hops present throughout. Mouthfeel is light and slightly watery. Extremely drinkable."
"This is a very sessionable; easy drinking unoffensive brew. Would be a nice change at a BBQ or instead of the Witbier and Hefe's I usually drink during the summer. Sometimes summer wheat brews become too orange, or spiced. This keeps the style closer to a beer. This would go easily all night."
"D- real drinkable because of how mild it is. One of the best pale wheats I've had...just really nonoffensive"
"This is very drinkable and an interesting summer beer."
"southern tier brewing company--hop sun summer wheat beer--summer good, summer better--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 4.90% ABV. 35 IBU's? (4.0 / 5.0) White mild lace medium head. Clear thin bright wheat gold color. Floral delicately dry hopped mild wheat ester front. Crisp zesty nicely carbonated mild sweet light spiced wheat fruit hint refreshing body. Clean mild hop citrus crisp tangy end. Sessionable burpy hoppy wheat brew. Flattens after 2 bottles. Sampled 7/5/2010. 6-Pack $10.99."
"Except for the high bitterness and carbonation, mouthfeel is good, very full. Pretty easy to drink but just lifeless, flavors aren't bad but nothing is there to reel you in and make you want more."
"Hops and wheat seem to play nicely with each other, I am surprised more brewers are not doing this. Has a significantly zesty, fresh wheat shock flavor that is enhanced by a citrus hop flavor and plenty of bitterness. Packs plenty of taste for such a low ABV brew. I believe I could drink this by the case were it available locally to me. I was impressed with the UberSun and now Hop Sun does the same. Deliciously drinkable beer, one of the best American Wheat beers I have had."
"Bitterness is a tad on the harsh side, this beer could use a little more sweetness to balance things out. I detect hops in the nose and with the bitterness, but not enough hop flavor. This beer is good, and could be great with just a few tweaks. I like how there is not too much yeasty flavor, and the nice yellow clarity."
"Pouring a clear golden yellow with a dense white head with great retention, this beer looks great. A little lacing is present too. The nose is quite excellent. Fresh and hoppy with plenty of bright citrus and grapefruit pith, this also has a solid wheat character on the nose. No yeast character (and none expected). There's a certain sharpness to the hop aroma that I find in amarillo-hopped beers, and this exhibits it too. The palate follows the nose, with a very good balance between hop flavor and bitterness. The wheat punctuates the transition between the sharp citrus up front and the moderate bitterness on the finish. Light in body, the beer has a nice, high level of carbonation, and a very enjoyable finish. Very drinkable stuff."
"D - easy drinking beer but kind of boring. I was really hoping for more of a hop presence considering the name but was let down. This beer could be great on a real hot day but I personally would prefer a crisp pils then. This was worth trying bu it certainly isn't Gumballhead. I don't think I would pick this one up again."
"D - Overall, Southern Tier delivers exactly what they promise ; a super quaffable summer beer that is great after mowing the lawn. I could easily drink a few of these on a long, hot Saturday."
"M/D - Mouthfeel was thin and week with a less than pleasant aftertaste. I would call this more drinkable than a bmc wheat, but not too much more"
"(D) an eminently drinkable beer with an almost-session ABV and perfect balance of flavors, this is one I'd look for in cases or bring to parties."
"Overall a really good wheat. One you'd drink all day while outside. One of my personal favorites for the style."
"D: A good beer. I don't agree with other reviews calling it spectacular. The hops are pheonomenal, but this beer lacks balance. Just a little more maltiness and this bber would be a solid A."
"D: The beer is very refreshing, thirst quenching and easy to drink. It's a sessionable beer for a hot summer day."
" Tastes sweet and bready up front with a nice citrus hoppy twang following quickly. Finish is fairly dry and refreshing. Cold, it tastes borderline watery, but it gets much better as it warms a bit. Very good session, summer ale...but why did they filter it ?"
"Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Pours a golden yellow with a one finger white head that subsides quickly to minimal. Maintains decent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of wheat and citrus. The flavor was of a subtle wheat, with an aftertaste of citrus with slight hops. It was light on a palate with low carbonation. Overall it was a nice smooth brew for hot summer days that would make an awesome lawnmower brew. However I don't think I would be able to drink a large amount. It was not bad, but it also wasn't great.."
"Taste: The taste was a little bit disappointing because the smell was so good. It has a sweet wheat flavor but is very watered down in taste."
"Carbonation is only medium and as such a tad low for the style. The body is medium low, and very drinkable, and overall the beer is close to greatness. however that finishing minerally, almost metallic flavor lowers the score just a bit."
"Light bodied. The carbonation offers little resistance. Disappointing, given my high opinion of Southern Tier."
"I was disappointed by this one and wouldn't recommend it."
"Summery hop hit that underplays the wheat."
"Poured a hazy deep yellow. Not much head. The typical wheat malt aromas but with a distinct freshness. The grapefruit aromas are very delicate almost like a breathe of fresh air. The wheat and hop flavors join almost immediately creating a very unique flavor. Very fresh citrus and grapefruit flavors. Nice light body in this summer ale, finishes very clean and is incredibly refreshing. An excellent ale for a hot summer day bbq."
"D - Incredibly easy to take a few of these down. I found this beer to be equally enjoyable sitting on my deck after work or working on my PC. A great summer offering from ST; it may be replacing SA Summer as my ""staple"" summer beer."
"Also this beer tastes far better cold. Drinking a warmer beer I get notes of apple and not as nice a tongue feel."
"Poured a clearish gold color that left lace all down the glass. A hoppy, citric smell along with lemon zest. An easy, mild beer to drink that contains some spicy citric hops and a little bit of sweetness all tucked in nice and neat. Nothing extraordinary about this beer but a great session beer to have in warm times."
"A good summer beer, but just a little light on flavor for me"
"Nothing special or profound going on here, but this is a clean, flavorful, easy to appreciate American wheat style beer."
"Light bodied, very refreshing but a little too much prickly fizz. However, I am starting to ask ""where's the wheat?"""
"D- I didn treally like this beer. This style is really not a very good style most of the time. That said, this is a drinkable beer for what it is."
"Very good drinkability. Has to be one of the best summer seasonals I've tried. Quality is there and it comes off like a mild belgian ale."
"Overall I was a big fan of this beer - a hopped-up wheat. Worth a shot, especially in hotter weather."
"Pours a pretty clear golden amber with a fine-bubbled cream white head. Hoppy, almost evergreen aroma has a hint of citrus to it. Lively, hoppy flavor has tones of evergreen and citrus, the latter mainly grapefruit. Tingly, fizzy texture leaves a nice buzz in the mouth."
"drinks well, as a summer beer should. too hoppy for many lighter beer drinkers, I would assume, but too light for hop lovers. Not enough sugary sweetness for wheat beer drinkers, but too much for pale ale drinkers. falls in between, but successfully creates its own identity that is pleasurable in its own way."
"Appearance: pours a clear gold with thin white head, couple spots of lace. Smell: lemon, grassy, spicy. Taste: spicy, a bit grassy, lemon citrus, on a pale malt backdrop. Mouthfeel: wheat finally makes some appearance, as the feel is a little prickly and fluffy. Summer wheat beer? Whatever. There's really nothing wheat going on in this. Reminds me of a mid-grade hoppy pils like SN Noble Pils."
"Drinkability: Hop Sun brings a bit more energy and liveliness to the typically bland, snooze-inducing APWA style. It's got the relative lightness of wheat ale, but a bright hop character to keep your tongue from falling asleep."
"D: Very drinkable. Although not nearly as good as Gumballhead, definitely the best I've found anywhere around DC."
"This is one of the best summer ales out there in my opinion. Put this next to some of the great PA pilseners in my fridge and I am a happy man on a hot summer day."
"D: Not a bad beer, and drinkable, but not particularly memorable."
"Notes: Overall a nice American Pale Wheat. I think this would be a better beer to drink when finishing mowing the lawn or another activity. Taste isn't as bold as one would like, but a lot of American Pale Wheats tend to slip into this. Such is life."
"I can see where this is a great summer beer. Super drinkible and very light ABV. However I don't get a lot of the wheat from this beer. Its definately more hoppy and malty then other wheats I have had. I get no citrus aroma, more Hops and a little malt. Its a little on the watery side, but that makes it easy to drink I suppose. I guess after being very pleased with all other Southern Tier brews, I was disapointed in this offering. Its just nothing special."
"Great start, middle, and finish"
"overall: a good beer but nothing stands out"
"D- This is a very drinkable beer...period. I was surprised how well made this beer is. Southern Tier made a fantastic beer that is both light body and full of flavor. The ABV is low enough to make this beer a sixer of good times."
"D - Big surprise, one of the best things I had of this style in a long time. Very, very drinkable summer seasonal."
"The people at the bar I was at all raved about this beer. I liked it ok but I didn't love it. It was not a very wheaty wheat beer. Like many of the beers from this brewery, the styles are kind of americanized. I like this and might like it better and would recommend it to those who want something light but aren't huge wheat fans."
"D - Decent, but the combination of wheat and American hops doesn't work particularly well for me. I love them both separately, but I don't think their sum is as good as their parts."
"D-very nice and refreshing beer but a little too carbonated for me."
"Overall this is a pretty light flavored beer. The citrus hoppy flavor is pretty good with the wheat base. A good summer drinking beer that I have purchased several times now."
"drinkability is great - low abv and light body with good flavors screams drink multiple"
"D - Wow...this is an extremely drinkable beer...this is perfect for any occasion over the summer...I enjoyed this one a little too late...I will be picking up a case of this next year as soon as it hits the shelves...Southern Tier does it fine without pushing the boarders on this one"
"Worth a try but maybe wait for a warm day to get the right feeling."
"Quality go-to on those hot-weather days."
"Drinkability is very good for a pale wheat. There is a lot of good tastes going on, but they are all undertoned enough to make each other taste better. Definitely one of those beers I could drink all day in the summer."
"I had this beer on a Labor day weekend, on my family's deck overlooking the Mississippi river. The beer is pale golden colorred with a thick sticky head. The aroma has light citrus like orange and lemon, assertively hoppy but with a hint of wheat (just a hint). The taste is everything I hoped for from the smell, maybe with a little extra added in a positive way. This is tart & sweet, a little bitter and tangy, everything I could want out of a summer wheat. Well carbonated and ultra-drinkable, these bottles emptied fast. Maybe the best of the category really, or at least solid competition for Gumballhead."
"Nice hoppy aroma. Good wheat summer look. Very nice flavor and intersting for a summer wheat. Hop sun has a great summer hop flavor. It stays on the tounge with a subtle and enjoyable hoppy aftertaste, but not outstanding. I thought it was a good wheat ale and I was impressed with the incorperation of a great hoppy flavor."
"Very drinkable, and the lower alcohol makes this a great beer to drink all day long on a hot summer day."
"Drinkability- Somewhat bland and immemorable"
"Morey's Bottom Line: Hands down the best wheat beer that I've ever had. I'm usually not a huge fan of the style, but this is more of a hybrid wheat/pale ale."
"What a pleasant surprise this beer is! I bought it without reading any reviews, and had passed it over on several previous trips to Whole Foods. My bad! I'll be buying this beer more frequently for certain."
"IPA for the summer. Or if you prefer, an IPWA (India Pale Wheat Ale). Good on a summer night."
"Southern Tier Hop Sun is a very clear straw colored beer with a thin, bubbly white head that leaves some lacing. It has a fresh, citrusy hop aroma that's clean and lemony. There's a note of biscuity malt and perhaps some sour dough. It starts almost medium bodied but it thins out. The finish is light and watery. It's very smooth overall. There's not much flavor here. There's a little bit of citrus from the hops and maybe some mint. This total lawn mowing beer."
"Conclusion: Great summer seasonal...light, low in alcohol, packed with flavor, and will even getcha your hop fix for awhile!"
"This is an excellent summer quaffer. Its beautifully light and easy to drink, with a nice clean flavour profile and just enough hops to keep things interesting. I really didn't know that Southern Tier could do toned-down session beers, but this makes a great counterpoint to their imperials."
"Drinkability: One of my new top 5 summer brews. Perfect sessionable ABV, tons of hop flavor and yet softness from the wheat, and just insanely drinkable. This is a good one to introduce to the BMC light beer drinkers too as far as trying to get someone to branch out. Thanks for making this one a staple, Southern Tier."
"Reviewing again because I have been drinking the hell out of these this summer. This is undoubtedly my favorite summer beer."
"12 oz bottle- Pours a sparkling gold with a two finger white cap that recedes to a thin ring. Nose is predominately hoppy, citric, quite grassy with some cookie and slight wheat malt. Quite hoppy in the flavour department. Lemon and grapefruit with grassy bitterness, a bit of sweet wheat malts, some spice with some banana and mango. Not really coming across as a wheat to me. More of an APA? Either way it is good ans tasty!"
"D: Hands dowm, my favorite summer seasonal. Great flavor with a strong dose of hops, but easily sessionable. I could drink this beer all year long. Another excellent offering from Southern Tier."
"I'd rate it higher except for the weird plastic taste I got."
"This is quite the drinkable beer. Easily could make a great deck party beer. Alcohol is not too high, approachable for the novice but flavorful and with a enough hop flavor and presence for the seasoned craft beer drinker. Really good."
"D: Great summer brew, nice and light with great taste and a nice body. Nice to see Southern Tier has such a breadth of capability, able to produce big extreme brews and less complex, high quality brews. Go grab this brew if you're looking for the perfect summer compliment."
"A solid beer, if unspectacular."
"A hop-forward wheat ale. Intriguing, sure, but not a combination that I'm a big fan of, apparently."
"Definitely a good buy, would appeal to non beer people decently well."
"Picked up in a pick a six, poured into pint glass fairly clear dark yellow to gold. Decent head little lace. Smells slight hops, fresh, not getting much. Tastes mostly citrus to spicy peppery hops. Mouthfeel is nice body - not too light and not too heavy and carbed moderately - excellent. Drinkability okay - spice hops kind of saturate the palate."
"D: Really drinkable beer, this might be my new choice for the lawnmower brew."
"A nice ligt golen color pour with a medium sized fluffy white head, good retention, spotty lacing,medium carbonation. Aroma of floral hops,a little wheat, and some nice little grapefruit notes. Flavor is a bit floral up front with some spice, citrus hops and just a little of the wheat malt, hoppy but with balance, light to medium body ,crisp,refreshing smooth mouthfeel, lightly sweet fuity finish. Very sessionable, I would buy this again"
"Drinkability: A great summer session beer. Because of the fresh, floral, citrus hops I would reach for this brew again and again. Nice!"
"This is a solid summer wheat beer with a good hop character. Perhaps it could use a little complexity, but it doesn't have any major flaws. It's a good beer to drink on a hot day or really any time. Recommended."
"Taste: Very tart. Cheek puckering tartness. Hard to pick out many flavors between the tartness and bitterness."
"D - this is a great summer beer and one that I definitely will buy again. It is up there with Oberon and Gumballhead for my favorite APWAs, which is good company to be in."
"There's nothing average about this beer. It excells in basically everything it does: all the categories above, ingenuity, brewing practice. I feel like I'd like to drink this in a beer garden in Germany, even though it's very far from classic German styles."
"d - i could chase the heat away all day with this one(if southern tier distributed here in denver)"
"From a growler obtained fom good ole DeCiccios in Ardsley, NY. Pours lighter goldeny amber, near white head and tehn leaving expansive zones of lace on the glass. Lemon and fresh hop notes in the nose. Ahh summer time and the time is right for zesty, refeshing summer wheat beer, this one continues on what the sniff has started, more citrus, more fresh hop bite. It all adds up to an assertive take on the style, full of flavor, zest, citrus, hop character and summery goodness. More quality brew from NY state's own ST"
"Pours a clear, golden/yellow color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of hops, wheat, slight grass, and slight coriander. Fits the style of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. The bitterness level is only slight. Tastes of hops, wheat, lemon, grass, and sweet malt background. Overall, a very hoppy pale wheat ale, but the sour wheat and bitter hops aren't the greatest combination."
"An easy drinker. Quenching and with a low abv for sessioning."
"D- I love Sam Adams Summer Ale. This is just like that, but hoppy. Nice change of pace from the other summer wheats. Will most definitely be drinking this again. I highly recommend it."
"Just got back from my 7 mile bike commute home on an 85 degree day, and man, does this ever hit the spot."
"Pours pale straw in color. Unremarkable in the way of head or lacing. Has an absolutely big hop smell, like a huge IPA. Unfortunately, it seems most of the hops were aroma hops. Tastes more like what they were going for. A pleasantly hoppy version of the run-of-the-mill summer wheat beers you find. Not too hoppy, just a bit. As it warms it mellows out nicely. Mouthfeel is a bit thin through. Drinkability definitely improves as it warms. It was nice to try, but I don't think I'll be making a habit out of it."
"Drinkability: With a low ABV this is exceptionally drinkable. I could really session this in the summer. A pleasant surprise as the hops are not as biting in the taste as they are on the nose. A great lawnmower beer."
"D: I'm going to use the word that comes along with the 5.0 rating on this site. EXCEPTIONAL drinkability is the only way to describe it. It's probably pretty easy to get caught up mowing the lawn or just relaxing in the yard and downing a 6 pack. With the low ABV, it would probably be hard to taste it also."
"Pours a nice light golden color, great head to it.. minimal amount of lacing. Light bodied (which is what I'm looking for on a nice hot day), some nice lemon type flavors in there. Goes down very smooth and easy.. incredibly refreshing! Nice balance going on here and not just a light bland summer beer like some other breweries do... good one to pick up here!"
"D - I would rate the drinkability of this as exceptional. The ABV is just right and the taste is very good"
"Drinkability: With the warmer weather starting to beat down on us, this is really a great beer that is light in body and low in ABV, so it's very easy to drink without much worry in getting too intoxicated, always (well, maybe not always) a plus."
"The feel gives a small bite on the way down. Light, but bubbly. It's not quite as sublime as I remember, but incredibly drinkable in the summertime."
"D - This is a great american pale wheat ale. Its hop character defies conventional wisdom."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into a nonic Imperial pint glass. The ale appears a hazed pale straw yellow color with about an inch of white foam. Nose and flavor are of light citrus (lemon), fruity, floral, slightly bitter. A notch better than medium bodied and amply carbonated. Excellent drinkability. A great warm weather wheat ale."
"Drinkability: Overall, a very enjoyable brew. I got a six pack and really liked several last night, so I wanted to review it today to dedicate some more careful attention. My sense is that the hoppiness is a bit too aggressive for its style, and dominates the aftertaste of the beer. Its name suits it though, and I'll never kick this sunshiney hoppy beauty out of my glass."
"Easy to drink and a great all occasion summer beer. Congratz to Southern Tier for getting their big beer taste in something this easy to session."
"Mouth is slightly over-carbonated and a bit oily but this is suprisingly refreshing and crisp. Drinkability is all day with this one and is a great pair for a summer cookout."
"D - Very drinkable. The hop is not overwhelming making it go down easier than some other hoppy beers."
"3.5 D: Fix the carbonation, and the drinkability goes way up."
"Nice golden hazy orange in color with a good white head and killer lacing noticed on the pint glass. Smells are of hops, wheat, lemon, and some light honey tones. Taste is nice and hoppy in the front and very refreshing overall. The wheat/honey notes come out in the back and give it a sort of fruity smoothness. Highly carbonated, ABV MIA, and light in body make this the perfect gulper for a session. Dangerously drinkable. My new summer beer of choice just has been confirmed for the '09 season."
"An interesting and delicious hybrid. A nice, bitter summer refresher"
"Pours a clear gold color with 2 fingers of foamy white head. OK retention and some decent lacing. Smells of grass, pineapple, lemon, honey, and toasted grains and wheat. Tastes of lemon, pineapple, and green apples up front, then some honey, toasted grain, wheat, and a grassy finish. Medium in body with pleasant carbonation. Smooth with a nice dry finish, nicely hopped. A really easy beer to session, great for a hot summer day."
"D: Excellent drinkability. I want more right now."
"not as good as gumballhead, but not bad at all"
"poured from a bottle into my sam adams glass. Pours a light golden color. Violent pour gave about 1/2 inch of head that quickly faded, good lacing throughout. Aroma is that of citrus/fruity and floral hops. Taste is crisp slight hop taste, hint of lemon also weak on the wheat. Taste is almost watered down in a way but still good. Aftertaste is refreshing, not really bitter, clean and very good. Great beer for drinking during the summer."
"D- A great summer session beer. Not filling, easy to drink, full of flavor, and refreshing. What else can you ask for?"
"A wheat beer that isn't as boring as most of the rest out there. It has a pleasant flavor and it's drink-ability is off the charts. It goes down like water on a hot day. This is in my top 3 favorite summer beers for sure. Since I can't get 3F Gumballhead in my area, I'll settle for this as my summer session beer."
"D- Very Drinkable makes for a great summertime beer."
"Drinkability? Yeah, totally. (Repeal the drinking laws and) Give this one to the neighborhood kids. But make sure to snap a couple for yourself."
"D - just great for the style. I would not hesitate to pick this up by the case. I could see it as a compliment to burgers or ribs for summer grilling events."
"D: This beer is fantastic, super drinkable, a fantastically sessionable beer that I could easy keep an constant case of the entire summer. Could look a little prettier and flavors tend to wash out a bit when the hops take over, but this beer packs so much into a small package that it almost makes up for any shortcomings. Good stuff, underrated and worthy of fridge space."
"Doesn't quite live up to Gumballhead, but still pretty solid."
"D- Easy drinking and a good make for a summer brew. No overwhelming flavors make it easily sessionable."
"Cheers!!!"
"Drinkability: Tastes good (some wheat presence too, combined with a hop dominant flavor)..good mouthfeel."
"D- Great. Perfect for the warm/hot weather. Extremely drinkable."
"Drinkable - not as clean as the appearance might lead you to believe, but easy to double up."
"D - Light ABV and comfortable flavors and scents make this a great summer brew."
"This is an interesting beer. Tastes to me like a wheaty, apa. Nice looking pour with some tracing and a disappating head but still pillowy down to the last sip. Strong, citrusy flavors compliment the wheat. Very clean and crisp and not overpowering. Finishes with a dry crispness. An interesting beer."
"Pours a very light, clear, gold in color. Smell is some very nice hops. Taste is bitter hops and crisp. Mouthfeel is good and full. There is the obvious wheat characteristics, but there's also the typical lemony flavors and grassy notes as well. This would be a great spending all weekend out in the sun and partying kind of beer. Good stuff."
"Feels more like an IPA than a pale wheat ale. Regardless, the hops add a bit more oomph to it. Drinkable but definitely not easy to categorize."
"Nice hoppy beer, a rarity in wheat beers."
"Nicely drinkable beer."
"Refreshing balanced summer brew that is one of my top rated active bottle beers for style."
"Smells Cascade-ish hops and a surprisingly sweet malt profile for an American wheat. Taste is cascade-ish hops and an eh American wheat malt profile. The sweetness I picked up in the aroma was fairly blase in taste. I'm used to Southern Tier's big beers and so maybe I was just expecting something bigger."
"D: A nice summer drinking wheat with a hoppy kick to it. Low abv and pleasant citrus and grass hoppiness is sure to satisfy and make for a summer time session."
"Pours a clear golden color with a thin white quickly dissipating head. Nothing special about the aroma or flavor. Hints of citrus peel, lemon zest, wheat and hops. Quite boring and flat. Dissapointing beer from a great brewery."
"Yellow with a foamy white head. Smells of light hoppiness and white grapes. Taste is light and refreshing, with just enough hops to give it a great flavor. Great for mowing the lawn on a summer day, without being too light. I'm surprised by this. I really like it."
"Overall: ISO"
"I believe this would be called ""sturdy"". Nothing too amazing, but the hops in a wheat beer make this a decent slugger, but not one I'd seek out personally."
"D: Highly refreshing, lower abv, I'd like a couple on a hot day."
"Drinkability: As good as it gets - a session beer to drink all day."
"Wheat texture is good also, but the carbonation is a bit overdone..if that was toned down a bit, this would be downright excellent. Honestly, I haven't had an American wheat this good in a long time..very glad I got the chance to try this one from Southern Tier."
"Decent enough; if Southern Tier could get rid of that lingering, bad-wheat-kernel aftertaste, this would be a good Thursday afternoon brew."
"Good one for the beach or an outdoor gathering in warmth...light but rather flavorful. One of the best of the ST ""regular"" offerings so far."
"Pours a highly carbonated clear straw color with a medium off-white head. Aroma is medium sweet, grapefruit, spicy and light floral. Flavor is grapefruit, grassy, spicy and light citrus. Finishes a bit more bitter and spicy. Light to medium body, thin texture."
"Is this the best summer beer ever? I think so. Pours a slightly hazy straw blonde with a dense white head. good retention, minimal lace. Aroma is very hoppy. Lemon peel and floral aromas dominate. Flavour is very crisp. Not as hoppy as the aroma would lead you to think. Like earthy lemon and sour dough bread. Very light on the palate and refreshing. Moderate bitterness. Easy drinking, hoppy and very refreshing. If you are a hop head, this is your wheat beer."
"My first beer from Southern Tier, thanks to Lum for the extra! Good dog!"
"D: A good summer ale with a bit on incongruity in the flavors. It is definitely flavorful, but I'm just not sure the flavors blend well which leaves it with a demarcated flavor profile."
"D/O: A phenomenal summer thirst-quencher. Not too heavy for those hot days, but enough taste and character to make you realize you drank something. An excellent warm-weather choice for hopheads. Perhaps my favorite seasonal of 2008."
"Drinkability - a great summer beer. A little to the hoppy side for a wheat style but I will enjoy quenching my thirst with these."
"Mouthfeel is fairly full and creamy no doubt aided by the wheat. Hugely drinkable and a great summer beer to enjoy all day in the warm weather. I've gone through many over the past few months. Probably more than any other beer this past summer."
"Received this as an extra in a trade. Perhaps from Beertruth? In any case it was a pleasant surprise. One of the tastier wheats I've had in a while. Pours a golden, apple juice-like color. Okay initial head that fades to a thin cap. Aromas of sweet malt, light sweet wheat, citrusy/earthy hops, some bitterness in the finish. Tastes clean and sweet and of Juicyfruit gum, clean wheat, and earthy and bitter hops at the end. Very vibrant flavors for the style. Very nice. Smooth and crisp in the mouth, this a great summer beer."
"Six 12oz bottles for $10 from Bauer Wines in Boston. Pours a clear, pale yellow with a bit of head. The appearance may be pedestrian, but the aroma most certainly is not. Hops, hops, hops. Nice. First sip is a letdown compared to that nose. First taste is a metallic taste that is bitter but not hoppy. That metallic taste remains throughout the beer, and is a serious problem. So disappointing after that wonderful aroma."
"Loving the Southern Tier."
"Body quite light, average carbonation and great drinkability."
"D - Not as flavorful as the Uber Sun, but this lesser ""Sun"" still a pleasant hop presence and is highly quaffable, which makes it ideal for warm weather consumption."
"This was my first offering from Southern Tier and the brewery definitely intrigued me and I will be looking for more of what this place has to offer."
"D- The more I drink this beer the less I like it. There's just something unapealling about the taste that is starting to invade the smell as well."
"(Thanks Charles!)"
"Other than looking like a cream soda, this is a good beer. Nicely hoppy but not over the top makes for a great summer thirst quencher. Too bad I haven't seen more of this in Minnesota."
"D- Oh so drinkable. Very good session beer that shows off a nice hop profile. I loved it! Too bad ST does not distribute to my area; I would pound this stuff in the summer."
"I'd like to see a little more head to it and maybe a touch more opacity. And, sigh, the one I'm drinking right now isn't as good as the rest of the six pack was! Drat! This one is a little bitter with a zingy twist. That's not how the one I had last night was! Ah well. Still, good stuff."
"Notes: This was a pleasing experience of a micro brew simply delivering on what it suggests that it will. It is a great choice on a hot summer day (or night) and it is very drinkable."
"Tremendously friendly esthers pair with hay and dry grassy hops--alluring! Golden, pilsner-esque smoothly effervescent body... white head settles into hazy 1/8-inch line--dark for a hefe? Yet an ale? Smooth, ticklish and bubbly on the tongue; soft aftertaste with a light-to-medium body... fruity yeasts meet metallic, dry pilsner malts in a mix that softens and cools hot evenings... complex and satisfying... the brew leaves a gentle hop/malt combination, pleasant enough to present flowers to the nostrils but memorable in its ability to touch all bases in the brewing process--dissecting this would be almost as rewarding as drinking!"
"D: exceptional, i could see myself sitting with a 6 pack on a dock somewhere"
"This is a very different beer. It has a nice up front piny hop taste. It also has the nice smoothness of a wheat beer. Served cold in a pint glass made the aroma excellent. The golden copper color is appealing. This is an easy beer to drink, and would love a 6er on a hot summer day."
"I really liked this beer, I thought at first it would be sub-par because Im not a fan of wheat beers, but I am a fan of Hops (HopHead). This beer had excellent aroma and flavoring hops, and none of that bittering hop taste youd expect from an IPA type. I got a 12 pack variety case of southern tier with my buddy NoahSYGG, we were very impressed with this brewery as a whole. Very good beer."
"I was definitely impressed with this beer and would buy again, as well as trying other Souther Tier beers."
"MF/Drinkability: Fairly bright and vibrant feel to this. Snappy carbonation and light-medium bodied. Hops add some quenching fruit like aspects. Overall, a nice summer drinker that I'll hit more often."
"Very good summer beer and a wheat beer at that. Amusing bottle design and a damn refreshing brew."
"It's no flavor juggernaut, but it's not a snoozer either. It succeeds as a superb summer season sessioner."
"D: I think this has to get top points for drinkability. It's the perfect combination of crisp, refreshing, flavorful and not overly intense that you can't session this. Kudos ST! Will definitely drink again (although it'll have to be via trade again)"
"Baked bread and flower/herbal hops combine for a unique twist on the American wheat ale. In fact, you could almost consider this a straight up APA, but it's up for debate. Mild tartness and a vanilla sweetness make up the finish. This is one of the better American wheats I've had, and certainly worth a try in the summer months."
"the hops are there strong, masking the general wheat flavors in there. the wheat is there but subtle and toned way down. the general flavors though are still very light and mild. the aftertaste is mild as well. very smooth and drinkable. not an average wheat."
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. With a vigorous pour the beer left a small white head that left little lacing on the beer and the appearance is a nice golden color. A nice light citrus smell a light hop spice and then you can smell the yeast. Wow, at first the citrus and hops come out strong. As I have more of this beer the spice from the hops becomes more apparent. The wheat is tough to detect and I would have to say this is more of a pale ale than a pale wheat ale. This beer is very light and decent carbonation make this beer a very drinkable beer for the summer time."
"D: Wonderful on this hot Florida summer afternoon. This is the best wheat beer made, as it's more IPA than wheat."
"Drinkability - With a lower abv and great taste I see no reason to drink a few of these. Do yourself a favor and pick up some."
"Overall a solid hot weather beer that I will probaly enjoy each year. I can see though that it lacks the complexity I sometimes seek, so this will have it's time and place to enjoy. Still, a solid brew from ST, like we expect anything else."
"Pours a nice golden color in a weizen glass with short lived head and lacing. Smell is clean, fresh, light wheat and a crisp significant fruity hop character. Taste is smooth dull wheaty malt, and light hops. Carbonation is low as well and it is milder flavored than the nose would indicate. Needs a touch more flavor, body, and crispness to really shine, but as is, it is still a pretty nice summer beer."
"Notes: I was always skeptical, as I'm not a huge fan of wheats. I shouldn't have doubted Southern Tier. I tried a sample of this at the ACBF and ran out and picked some up as soon as I got home. This could be a go to session beer for the rest of the summer."
"Drinkability: I loved this beer, very refreshing. Wasn't sure what to expect before I tried it but, I loved the combination of the amount of hops and the wheat. Would drink a few of these in a sitting."
"This taste more like a IPA than a pale wheat. It is rather tasty though."
"Good beer on a hot summer day, like today. Domo Hop Sun."
"D- I have to say although I do enjoy this beer and its refreshing characteristic I feel slightly let down by lack of flavor my particular bottle has. I was expecting a little more but a decent summertime brew nonetheless"
"Not really anything that I'd run out and buy again but it still was pretty decent. I usually expect a bit more flavor out of a Southern Tier brew."
"Pours a clear, bright golden yellow with a small bubbly head that has a slight bit of wispy retention and minimal lacing. Smell is of lemons, lots of lemons with sweet wheat and malt undertones. Taste is also a big lemony bitter kick up front with a very subtle malty wheat sweetness. Mouthfeel is super crisp and clean, light bodied. This is a great summer beer and very drinkable. Probably a little heavy on the lemon for my liking, but still a really good wheat beer."
"D. Hop Sun has too be one of the best session beers on a hot summer day.It's very refreshing with plenty of flavor.Easy to drink and after the first beer it has you coming back for more."
"A great drinking experience and a real authentic session brew. I'm so pleased I got to try this; I don't think I've had a better example of style. Southern Tier has done it again!"
"Another quality brew from Southern Tier. I've picked up a few of these this summer already and really enjoy it. The only downfall is that it disappears far too quickly. Hop Sun is hoppy wheat in the vein of Gumballhead. Although I prefer Gumballhead a little more this is another great beer of a hard to find sub-style."
"Give me more. As long as this beer is out and the weather is warm, I'm going to be buying more. Highly recommended!"
"A classic summer beer for hopheads."
"This great summer seasonal pours a perfect gold. Very little head with great lacing, like lace valences over a sun lit window. The aroma is very crisp and citrus. Overwhelming scent of cascade hops. The tast is not at all as you'd expect. The citrus is almost pure aroma, there's a strong malty feeling with substantial hop bite, but not a hop bomb at all. The sweetness of the wheat is nice and and undertone, but Not as mild as a hefeweizen. This beer is perfect for a hot summer day after doing yardwork. A great refreshing seasonal, like you'd expect anything less than perfection from Southern Tier."
"Very nice summer beer here from Southern Tier with a very hop forward profile that opens up the taste beyond other wheat beers out there. Flavorful, crisp, and hugely drinkable, this is a great summer sessioner."
"D: Overall a nice sessionable summer brew. Above average but also nothing spectacular. Wouldn't turn another down."
"Served in my Oberon weizen glass. Poured a translucent pale gold-orange. Two inch rocky off-white head dissipated within minutes into a thin consistent skim. Small bubbles present in solution. Some lacing, but spotty at best. Scent of wheat and hops. Taste similar to nose; however wheat is more pronounced and hops less so. A hint of citrus revealed through a slight astringency at the finish, as well as mild tea-like character that is barely detectable. Light crisp mouthfeel leaves one refreshed after each sip; however, drinkabililty is some hindered by a general lack of flavor."
"I find this a very refreshing beer. Great for sessioning, great for the summer. This is a little outside the style, actually taking the wrong path, but in this case this path leads to a better destination than the normal one. Generally I find APWA to be failed attempts at a German Hefe Weizen mimic, but this is a good idea at delivering hop flavor without overpowering the malts by dumping in pound after pound of hops. Recommended."
"A very easy beer to put down."
"While not ST's strongest offering, Hop Sun is a poster child for what a summer beer should be. It's low alcohol content makes it a great session brew, and the lightness of body and flavor won't slow you down too much in the heat. Along with Brooklyn Summer, I'd say this a great choice for BBQing and playing some wiffle with pals."
"got to sample two of these on tap at Bodega the other night. Poured into a pint glass a bright yellow color with a minimal amount of white head. Aroma was very much a wheat ale with plenty of grain aroma followed by a pinch of hops and citrus. Taste was at first a very pleasant hop kick but that faded away into a very muted wheat taste. Mouth feel was very smooth and I wound up ordering two at happy hour."
"Again very crisp and bright initially with a lighter to medium body and upbeat but fine textured carbonation. Definitely something I could drink quite a few of without spoiling a meal or getting to loaded. The combination of flavor, its bright/lighter nature, and a very modest ABV makes this brew probably my favorite summer session beer which just so happens to be from my favorite American Brewery at the moment. Don't just grab a few from the 6-pack shop, make sure to procure at least a case and get ready for summer in a bottle."
"A wheat beer for the inner hop-head in you."
"Good starter and summer beer."
"Definitely one of the better APWA's that I've had. This extremely sessionable summer beer will be a regular in my fridge this summer."
"D: Low alcohol and this is going to be a standard for the coming warm grilling months. The hopiness adds a ton of character, not really a wheat beer by me but thats more than fine. Cant think of a food outside of dessert that this wouldnt be smooth as hell with."
"Straw-colored beer, completely transparent. Tiny white head fades almost completely, not much lacing to speak of. Smell is way hoppy! This is not what I expect in a summer wheat, but it's exciting. Tastes amazing. Lemony/piney hop presence is unreal, balanced out by the wheaty/grainy tastes. I'm loving this beer. Not unlike anything I've had, but this is something I'd want to drink all summer. Well done, Southern Tier!"
"MK"
"Pours a very, very light and clear amber with sunshine highlights. Very clar for a wheat beer. I wish they didn't filter this beer. Very light filmy foam that lasts throughout the whole beer. This is one of the most hoppy smelling and tasting wheat beers I've ever had. Stron citrus with a herbal background. Bitter wheat beer has more of a bitter leaning than a notable wheatand malt prfile. Get a few hints of cloves mixed with some mild orange zest. Very refreshing an easy to drink."
"GC"
"This beer is smooth, but still only average drinkability."
"Good stuff from Southern Tier..."
"D: This is an awesome session beer. Sometimes I like having a few beers then operating heavy machinery. This beer is my solution. Thanks southern tier!"
"Medium gold with little head or lacing. The glass brought to me was quite clear, not a typical weizen look to it. Very bright, fresh malty aroma. The first sip brings a lemony apricot taste, which continues to dance along with the crisp wheaty malt. The flavor bottoms out in the midpalate and then is gone, leaving the beer a bit unsatisfying in the flavor department. Refreshing, though, and the subtle apricot is quite nice with each sip. A different and more refershing take on the style than many, I was happy not to be walloped with banana aromas here; but neverthe less a bit of a one-note brew."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Carbonation is excellent and it's extremely crisp and refreshing. The combo makes for a very fine summer beer. It's extremely drinkable and one I could no doubt drink many of for the approaching time of year. If only I could get some solid warm weather, life would be outstanding. Very fine offering from Southern Tier. Highly recommended."
"D - This is one to crack on a hot sunny day, hense the label. I was very pleased with this selection and would deffinetly reccomend it to anyone."
"Pours a bright golden hue with thin white head. Active carbonation with some big bubbles. Smell is fresh citrus hops, zesty lemon and orange along with a nice clean wheat smell. Taste is crisp wheat up front followed by juicy citrus hops. Not packed with flavor but what is there is very nice. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Good drinkability. Probably a little late on this so maybe a fresh bottle this summer will be better. Still, quite enjoyable."
"Pours a slightly clouded gold. No head. Nose is light citrus aromas. Kind of like fresh air really. A bit hoppy. Flavor is tangy with bright citrus. Nice and light. Pretty crisp. I am starting to think that I might just not like this style at all. Too light. Not enough there. Just doesn't seem like it is for me. Overall this one is good. Feel has a nice bubble to it and a good liquid feel. Drinkable, sure. Light and crisp and it is well made. (it's just not my cup of tea)"
"Just a fantastic summer ale, light, refreshing, wonderfully hoppy with great aromas of tropical fruit from the hops on top of clean american wheat profile, a beer worth seeking out each summer, a session beer with dimension for the hotter days of an New York August."
"The second half of my bounty for standing up in the wedding of a good friend--thanks again, Captain Pat--Hop Sun is rather enjoyable, sweet and citrusy with a prominent orange flavor, with a bit of grapefruit mixed in. Yet there was also a modest hop bite present that I liked. Easy to have a few with its smooth taste, Hop Sun is a good way to beat the heat of summer, or relax with at any time. A good brew all around."
"Mostly clear deep golden body with a small, cobwebby, off-white head. Honey wheat bread, sweet fruits, and bright citrus hops on the nose. Mellow, lightly toasted malt up front. Soft wheat, honey, and fruit flavors. Snappy citrus and floral hop bitterness into the finish. Moderate body with a soapy, wheaty feel. Good summer drinking beer!"
"crisp and pleasant a super easy drinking beer"
"This one pours an average, golden color with minimal head. The nose is malty and refreshing with fruity notes of oranes and dried apricots. The taste is decently interesting. Some bitter hops with notes of fruits. Very, very, dry feeling. Mouthfeel is average, I could easily enjoy a few of these. Not bad, but not much of a conversation starter either. I wouldnt search for this, but its a decent output."
"Highly recommended to accompany picnics, pool sides, beaches, lawn mowing, tanning, camping, cottaging, outdoor recreation, simple porch sitting, or any activity you may enjoy in the summer time!"
"D- Great job by Southren Tier. I tried Uber Sun before hop sun. The flavor is less intense here-but the brew is much more sessionable due to its low ABV. I will have this one again when summer rollls back around."
"Very good, a most enjoyable beer. Not your typical wheat, closer to GumballHead."
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, huge two-finger plus foamy white head, tons of sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, with a good hop note, citrusy, some pines, some caramel. The taste is malty/hoppy, slight citrus, and caramel. There's something else going on in there, but I cannot detect it, definitely not the usual grassy nose or taste. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is an awesome Pale Wheat Ale, glad to have had a chance to try it."
"I have nothing but good things to say about everything I've ever had from Southern Tier, so I picked this one up after hearing that they had a pale wheat ale. This one pours a mostly clear golden color with a finger of white head that dissolves into some circles of foam. Light lacing. Nose is strong on hops, a surprise for a wheat but not for something called Hop Sun or anything from Southern Tier. Light wheat, as well as bubble gum in there as well. A nice sweet nose. Taste is great: hops show up first, nice and fruity. A good amount of wheat, orange and some lemon as well. Body is medium with good carbonation (better than a lot of over-carbonated wheats). I really like this one - it's a great mix between the sweetness of a wheat and the bitterness of an IPA. Definitely one I'll be picking up again."
"Great summer beer,more of a pale ale than wheat,pleasing taste with a light mouthfeel makes for a great summer driniking beer. Can't wait to drink more next summer. Get some if you still can one of my top choices for summer drinking."
"D- Yes many times over. A favorite from ST that I can't get enough of. I find that this beer goes down faster than most beers for me due to its low ABV and the IPA light nature of this little gem."
"An American Pale Wheat with some attributes of a blonde or pale ale and a bit of helles too. It all comes together for a high quality summer quaffer. Recommended highly."
"Don't drink it out of the bottle, pour it out. It's too carbonated for that kind of activity."
"Pours a golden honey color with an average white head that left some nice lacing as it dissipated. The smell is of floral hops, grassy, honey suckle. It has a rather unique taste. The floral hops are not as present as in the smell, the wheat malt seems to cut the hop flavor. It has a touch of honey and lemon and finishes with some hop bitterness. The feel is light and crisp, well carbonated, leaves some lingering bitterness. Definitely on the hoppy side for what I assume is a summer seasonal. Good wheat crisp bite with a good hoppy taste."
"The taste almost reminds me of pine nuts.There's a very light smokiness to it, too. Not much else. For something with the word ""hop"" in the name, it's not very hoppy. I was let down after the nice aroma."
"Pours a clear golden, thin white head forms, laces very well, all over the glass, settles to a thin ring, slightly oily. Smell is sweet and malty, big floral hopping, light fruits, honey, citrus, strawberries, very refreshing. Taste is a bit of a letdown, wheaty, floral, bread, bit of fruit and citrus, not near as aggressively hopped as I was hoping. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, very refreshing, good hot weather beer. Aroma reminds me somewhat of Gumballhead but the flavour lacks depth and complexity, pretty weak finish."
"12 oz bottle pours a chill hazed medium pale yellow body with small white head that leaves a few flecks of lace. Aroma is unremarkable, with some wheat malt and faint lemony citrus. Mouthfeel is refreshing, with a light body and zesty carbonation. Taste is understated. Wheat malt and a tame earthy hop bitterness. The carbonation and mouthfeel hold things together to produce a pretty decent summer lawnmower beer. Otherwise, an average example of a pedestrian style."
"D: Excellent. Nice flavors, a good nose, the low ABV and a solid feel make it go down as fast and easy as any beer I've had. Perfect summer quaffing beer. Twelve ounces is far too little. . . ."
"Has a good mouthfeel about it. The hop taste does not linger too long and it's easy to drink."
"Easy drinking and enjoyable, a good choice for those inclined to seek more hops in this style."
"Rich golden color topped by a thin, off-white head that quickly fades to a ring of foam. Head leaves a hint of lacing on the glass. Aroma has a strong wheat aroma backed by a hint of herbal hops. More of a fresh malt aroma than most beers. Actually quite appealing. The flavor is solid, with moderate bitterness up front slowly giving way to toasted malt flavor. It finishes crisp, with a nice wheat snap and then some grassy and herbal hop notes find their way back to the palate. Mouthfeel is well balanced between effervescence and malt structure. It's light enough to be refreshing, but it still says it's a well crafted beer. Drinkability is exceptional. I really enjoy this beer. I bought a few sixers buy/get one, but I wish I'd bought more at that price. Still, it's well worth the $7 a sixer or so I've been seeing it sell for."
"D: Easy to drink, light ABV, crisp/refreshing - all the traits of a very nice summer seasonal. One I'd pick up if available around here and definitely among the better Pale Wheats I've tried. Thanks, Joe."
"Pours a bright golden yellow with a 1 finger white head on top. Head lacks body so it doesn't last long. Smells of citrus with a slight piney background. The first taste is lemony and possibly grapefruit as well, with a smooth caramel follow-up and finished nicely with pine. The suttle hint up pine keeps you wanting more. Reminds me of a California IPA with out the abv. This is a must have summer brew!"
"D: Souther Tier hit the nail on the head with this seasonal beer. Summer is here. Embrace this Hop Sun with an entire 6-pack."
"Excellent summer brew. Pours a crisp and clear gold with a nice frothy head. The smell of the hops are clearly evident. The hops smack you in the face with the first sip but fade quickly and aren't overbearing. I taste the lemon and a hint of wheat. The carbonation is perfect for this style. I could drink these all night in the summer. Another excellent offering from Southern Tier."
"Poured into a becker (I think) glass. A nice golden color, slight cloudiness, with lots of head. The head was foamy, and had at least a small layer the whole beer. Left lacings down the side that clung fairly well. Smelled slightly sweet, but had very noticable lemony aroma. Flavor was reasonable. The lemony flavor tasted fake, kinda like some lemon flavored iced teas I have had. Not bad, just not what I think of for lemon flavor. Slighty oily in the mouth which I am not a big fan of, but not as bad as some I have had. I could see having a few of these on a warm summer day."
"T-this is a damned tasty summer refresher and one I would get again"
"Poured into a standard pint glass (I immediately scolded myself for not using my new Magic Hat weizien style glass) it settles out a light golden with a good 1 inch white head that dissipated pretty quickly, but left a nice skim-coat of frothy bubbles that lasted pretty much to the bottom of the glass. A very pleasant, unexpectedly fruity hop aroma. A nice grapefruit nose. A soft mouthfeel played off of a light hop bite, with a creamy finish typical of the american wheat style. Enough hops to add a little extra interest to what can be a sometimes bland style, but not so much to lose the resreshing drinkability you're looking for in a summer wheat beer. I think they're doing good things out there in Central NY."
"D - very good drinkability, nice summer session beer."
"The hops bite up front, but it mellows quickly to wheat/lemongrassy flavor. Very light citrus aftertaste, with a very clean and crisp mouthfeel. There isnt much to this beer, it is plain and simple what they called it. If this is your cup of tea, they go down very easy, great sessionable beer."
"Drinkability: superb. This is an excellent example of a flavorful lower alcohol beer that is refreshing and easy to quaff. Awesome summertime beer."
"D- It's a pretty good beer. Going in I was expecting more to this beer. The label called it a ""summer wheat beer"" and I felt the wheat characteristics were lacking. While this beer didn't meet my initial expectations, I enjoy what it is and wouldn't mind drinking a few more this summer on the deck or out at the beach."
" The pour looked like that of a European Pils - light, clear, bubbly, and not a lot of head. There wasn't a lot of lacing either but the taste more than makes up for it! The mouthfeel is light and crisp - since the hops are not overpowering and very light in regards to the bitterness. I can feel citrus, lemon, and floral/soapy notes here, but this works well together and is appropriate for this time of the year. Most hoppy beers tend to have a bit of a warming effect on me, but this isn't like those. The aftertaste just has the slight lingering of the mouthfeel, and I still am amazed at what this is classified under. I'm not detecting much of the characteristics of a hefe here!"
"Nice, deep golden color. Nice floral and hoppy aroma. Deliciously hoppy and somewhat lemony. Very slight bite in the backround. Good body-holds up well for being on the lower end of the abv scale. Very drinkable and enjoyable. This is my kind of wheat beer. Perfect for the summer."
"A summer refresher, for sure. Hoppier and more to it than many other wheat ales that come out for the summer."
"I'd vote for this to be an all-year-round brew!"
"I wasn't too impressed with this beer. I thought it'd be a nice, wheat beer texture with some of that sweetness you usually get, but I don't what this beer is trying to do."
"It's pale, it's wheat, and it's hops. I didn't really know what I was buying when I picked this up but I'll have to be snagging some more of this for some beach days. This would also be a great beer to introduce somebody to craft brew."
"Pours a slightly cloudy (filtered) golden color with a thin medium sized white head. The head disappears quick to a thin covering on the top of the glass but leaves an average amount of lacing. The smell is the best part, very pronounced citrus (lemon), hint of wheat beer astringency and wheat malts. The taste doesn't match up to the smell but it is still a nice drink. Very smooth, citrus / wheat malt flavor with a hint of bitternesss. Mouthfeel is rich enough and there is no annoying sweetness or aftertaste. Drinkability is good. Smooth drink, crisp and refreshing with a low abv. Would be a good summertime session beer."
"Overall, why so sour? Age and lager yeast could have been a factor. I will try again when fresh."
"Simply delicious. So light and crisp and clean and smooth.Tons of hop flavor with absolutely minimal amounts of bitterness. Must be late boil additions. This was a great brew. Pretty original in my opinion and very delicious. This could be a beer for everyone as it isnt too bitter but eases one in to the hop flavor and characteristics. Thanks again to sinstaineddemon for this beaut."
"This beer poured a clear gold with almost no head. It is hard not to immediately notice the lemon and hop aroma. The citrus flavor is nothing too extraordinary for a summer wheat seasonal, but the hoppy finish sets this beer apart from others. The flavors transition well without any one dominating. There was nothing about this beer that I didnt enjoy."
"This beer wasn't what I expected. It pours a bright golden hue with a small foamy head. Smell is very zesty/fruity and quite refreshing which fits this summer beer perfectly. For a wheat beer, hops are very present, with wonderful hints of wheat and barley. Probably one of my favorite brews to sip on a hot summer day."
"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily, I would prefer a little bit more of a kick, however, with an APWA I don’t typically expect one. If I were going to drink something light, this would be one of my first choices."
"Taste is balanced and layered with hops but overall bitterness is low. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for a hop dominated beer and wheat flavors are pretty thin on the ground across the board. To me this is more like a light pale ale if such a thing exists but it is tasty and interesting, just a little lacking in body."
"A little light in the mouth and quite drinkable, I wish I had tried this when the weather was more atune to the style, I could see this going well with a lazy summer evening around the barbecue."
"Great looking and smelling American Hefe, but... a bit boring in taste/mouthfeel. Sorry. Easy drinking on a warm summer day, for sure."
"A nice offering from a good brewery. This one would go great with hot dogs off the grill on a summer afternoon with friends. Try is as a nice, decent priced choice for your cookout, and not be disappointed."
"Over all a very unique and delicious wheat beer that I recommend."
"Sampled at the Odds and Ends Tasting on 8/16/06: Hazy dark gold color with a medium thin and fluffy off-white head, with thin patches of lacing. Nice aroma of hops, malt and wheat. Light-bodied with a soft mouthfeel. Hops and wheat flavors dominate, with some citrus in the background. The finish is mostly bitter but still retains the wheaty character. Pretty enjoyable overall."
"This pours a light golden honey with a very large white foamy head. The smell is very strong with citrus hops, this is more like a mild IPA than a wheat beer. The taste,like the smell, is all hops. Grapefruit or tangerine dominate this beer making this very crisp and refreshing. The m/f is light and the flavors mix well. This is a great hoppy summer beer. however there is no way this is a wheat beer. I really liked this,but let's call an IPA an IPA."
"I very drinkable summer offering, not my first choice but i would be stoked to find a case of it at a random gathering."
"D: Great tasting and easy drinking makes this offering from Southern Tier a perfect summer ale. Southern Tier has put out some phenomenal brews and this falls right in line. Low abv=great summer session brew."
"D-Fine drinking summer beer, nicely balanced flavor, goes down nice and smooth."
"D: Could probably drink a few of these. It's not really in the American pale wheat style, but it's different. The hoppiness pretty firmly moves it out of the ""refresher"" category, but I could see keeping these around for a cooler summer evening."
"Pours a clear golden color with a medium white head. Head maintains well and there's good signs of carbonation. Aroma is lemony along with a bit of kumquat in there. The smell is fairly weak though. Taste follows suit. Basically no malt to be found and the body is quite light. Good levels of carbonation keep the beer somewhat lively and offset the lack of malt a bit. Hop flavors are there but only intense because of the lack of other flavors. Citric qualities show themselves and a bit of apricot flavor. Really, really dry. This was an ok ""summer beer"" but nothing more."
"Crystal-clear brass with sparse carbonation rising slowly to a thin, pristine-white head. Brazen spicy-floral-pine hop aromas -- Amarillo? Hallertauer like Big Red? -- with a deftly hidden candy sweetness lurking beneath. Immediate spicy Hallertauer attack, with a nearly sulfuric flavor and a light mineral finish. Some sweetish English muffin bready malt flavors arrive later on. Smooth and airy mouthfeel, light side of medium body. Supremely easy to drink and enough hop kick to keep it interesting; no middle-of-the-road, cloudy, unfiltered wheat beer here. Chalk up another hit for Southern Tier in my scorebook."
"Poured a golden raisin blonde color that leaves a thin white lace that disappears quickly. The aroma is citrus, hops, wheat, honey, musty grass dew. Very nice aroma different than your typical American wheat due to the big presence of hops. The taste mirrors the nose starting with a wheat twang, followed by a lemon citrus tartness backed by a hoppy bitterness I normally don't find in an American wheat beer but a pleasant surprise. This is good and different the finish is malty with again a sweetness of honey, that is backed up by a bitter bite that makes you want another sip."
"D - This is one damn fine drinkable summer beer. Give me more!"
"Drinkability is really, really high. This is a summer brew designed to be quaffed outdoors on a hot day. I will buy this again."
"Overall impression: Not nearly the funkiness I expect from an American Pale Wheat Ale which is a nice change. I can do without that. Punchy hops that keep this one interesting. Light enough for an enjoyable summer session. This one works for me. Another winner from Southern Tier. Recommended."
"A nice honey color in the glass with a fairly decent pure white head. What is this...citrusy hops on the nose? Can't be. American wheats are usually lackluster in this department. But to my surprise and delight as I sip, I get a nice mouthful of pleasing bitterness with the malt happy to follow in the background. Can and will drink lots of these as the opportunity exists."
"a tasty alternative in the summer, I wouldn't want to drink this all day, but it would be a nice beer to switch to @ a BBQ when you are eating, it has enough character to stand up to food but not enough to over power it... more interesting than most pilsners... it's a good option. honestly I would favor the Southern Tier pilsner over this.. same hop profile basically."
"Comments: I liked this beer BUT I didn't think of it as really a wheat beer as I generally think of wheat beers. This was closer to an APA or IPA than a summer wheat. Too hoppy for a wheat beer. Again, Southern Tier seems to use the same hop bill so it does come off as tasting similar to their other offerings."
"Overall: A solid summer time offering, nothing too special here. A crisp palate pleaser. Worth a try."
"I will definitely buy more of this beer. An excellent summer brew. I never had anything quite like it."
"D - medium, might be too spicy for some"
"As said before, this is an excellent summer beer. A highly sessionable cookout weather thirst quencher."
"This is a rather uncomplicated beer, very straight forward (something I don't expect from Southern Tier). No carefully engineered hop combination or malt. No spice. Still--as my friends point out--it's a good selection for those looking for a flavorful, yet modest brew. If you're looking to ease someone into hop-worshipdom but their taste-buds can't handle it yet, this beer's a good starting point. Not watered down, but light-bodied (there's a big difference), making it a good candidate for a hot summer's day."
"A great hot summer day beer. Nicely balanced, flavoful and soft."
"On tap @ Boston's. Golden, and crystal clear, with a very thick white pillow-like head. Good head retention. Fair amount of hop aroma, citrusy, maybe piney and grassy. Pretty pale malt, not any tartness for a pale wheat. Slight citrusy, bitter finish. Light in body, with appropriate carbonation. Good patches of lace left clinging to the sides of the glass. Very satisfying. This is a great example of a low ABV beer that is flavorful, and refreshing without being overwhelming. I may have to try this again."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a light body. The beer is nicely carbonated. The beer is highly drinkable. I wouldnt hesitate to purchase this one again."
"Ditto on the first nice day in Cleveland, 2011 (April 10). This beer works nicely, though I think some European wit's might work even better."
"Not an over the top pale ale but a very smooth easy drinking beer."
"A nice summer beer with hops. Golden-orange body with fluffy white head, so-so retention. Smells of floral, earthy hops. Taste has a light wheat backbone, but most of the flavor is in the hops. Fruity at first, then earthy and then heavily floral. Tasted like a pale ale at first, a pretty interesting beer. Its a little too light-bodied. A little more malt could turn this from a very good beer to a great beer. Give it try."
"This is a very nice summer offering from Southern Tier. They have really left an impression on me since they entered the Boston market. This offering to me is the best summer beer I have tried this side of Three Floyds. As it warms, the hop bitterness becomes more and more pronounced and it really does a great job of surrounding the inside of the mouth without being overpowering. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but it is definitely very drinkable in the southern months."
"overall- the store i got this advertised it as a ""wheat IPA", so i had to give something like that a try. Even here it is listed as a pale wheat ale, but really tastes more like an IPA. no other american wheats have this intense of a hop presence, besides gumballhead of course. It would be interesting to compare this side by side with gumball to see how they size up to eachother. The actual beer is very refreshing and suprisingly strong flavored, which is not the typical for american wheats...seek this one out!"
"Pours a two finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Crystal clear amber color. Clearest wheat I have ever seen. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Mild hoppy nose. Starts hoppy/malty and stays that way right to the finish. Some lingering bitter, piney aftertaste. $1.45 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"overall I'd say this is an excellent summertime session beer for hop fans, the refreshing character and light body partner really well with the hoppy goodness"
"Nice grapefruit, a C hop aroma, good initial foam in pour. Some creaminess wheat nice on palate. Decent hop bitterness,lemon and spice, above average carbonation. Balanced with malt, Drying finish. an above average brew, the paradigm of this brewery."
"Pours a pale straw yellow, slightly hazy. The head is quite large and lumpy, but it goes away quickly leaving several protein rich chunks. Clean smelling hoppy aroma, with a bit of a roasted grain smell. Tastes hoppy at first, but at the same time very malty and sweet. A smooth clean taste with the right amount of carbonation. Chocolatey/coffee sweetness in the end with a wheatness to it. Finishes clean, and easy to drink. A winner."
"A nice brew from Southern Tier. Poured out to a golden color with a nice quarter inch head and minute traces of lace around the glass. Medium low carbonation. Aromas of sweet cereal, floral notes, and hops. Unique and inviting. Taste was refreshing and satisfying; flavors of hops and smooth malts were abundant, with hints of caramel and earth. Very nice. Mouthfeel was refreshing and medium bodied. A good level of drinkability, this would be an ideal beer for after a long summer afternoon of gardening and cutting the grass. Recommended. Special thanks to rousee for the sample."
"Thanks to Shaughn256 for the supply!"
"Pours a golden color with virtually no head. The smell is of citrus, pine and hops. The taste clean clear with a citrus feel that finishes with the slight hoppy bite. The mouthfeel is clean, smooth, lightly carbonated. It was good, really good and because of the lower ABV it makes it a highly drinkable beer. Could knock back a few of these on any hot summer day."
"The mouthfeel on this is very nice and velvetty. At 4.3% --how can you go wrong with a few of these. I do think this beer very much holds its own against a 3 F gumballhead. But NY is a lot easier for me than Indiana."
"Almost a dirty and slightly cloudy golden in color; thin white head. Fresh citrus fruit and sweet hops on the nose. Crisp and oily hops noted up front; just a touch of wheat bread and underlying malts. Fresh bubble gum flavorings; unbelievably sweet, decent carbonation. Bordering on medium bodied. As it warms, and its tough, cause this is so smooth and slick, some bread dough offerings and lemon peel notes. One incredible quencher, and certainly something I can drink at any time. Superior!"
"I'm not a hop chaser personally and I know that is not a popular sentiment these days, but I would consider this a great choice for those who do enjoy such beers. I would certainly give this beer another go."
"Flavorful and quite interesting for the style; a hybrid of a wheat and lightly hopped IPA. Wonderfully drinkable for the summer heat, with more flavor than your typical wheat."
"Taste really reminded me of an alcoholic cider I had in Finland a few times. Very, very similar. Sour, citrus, pungent and hoppy, yet sweet in the background. Bubbly and smooth but too watery for my taste. Still, light and easy to drink. Very, very cidery. Refreshing, and a lot of fun to review. This guy's got character."
"This bugger is worth a go."
"Another solid offering from Southern Tier. Not that complex or groundbreaking, but nice to see a good twist on a summer ale."
"Nice golden color.Creamy white head,with good lacing. The kind of beer you can just sit back and enjoy. Smooth,refresing taste. Light, but full flavor.Nice hop kick. It goes down very easy on a hot summer's day. Southern tier has a winner here. Try one or two if you get a chance!!"
"Mmm. 12oz bottle. Nice white head and pours a nice dark gold color. Nice lacing. This smells like other southern tier offerings; PIney, floral hoppy and citrusy. The taste is so nice. Similar to other souther tier beers but milder. This is milder than their ""mild"" IPA but still great hoppage with a good maltiness to balance it out. Therefore we have a ncie refreshing beer this time around. THe mouthfeel is moderate, but crisp and a little bitey. Surprisingly low abv with this beer but thats allright. Incredibly drinkable and flavorful."
"This beer is great for a hot day and still has a decent amount of flavor."
"Beer is good. Happy Summer beering."
"On-tap and Collegetown Bagels. Pours with a golden body and a crisp white head. The head retention wasn't very good in the glass, but excellent in the pitcher it came in. Wonderfully hoppy nose but not very complex. Crisp and refreshing, a really clean bitterness. Very citrusy and hoppy taste, and a clean sweetness. Incredibally drinkable, great summer beer."
"light peachy orange, clear with draft-pour style thin head. palealeish in all its glory. fruity hop smell is very light, transcends normal citrus smell to a sort of pineapple. solid wheat profile provides a uniform basic bitterness, complexity and crisp texture. hops prolong the bitter and linger just enough to be the last flavor left on the palate. cute little bubble gum finish cuts off just prior. drinkable like crazy with flavor complexity to keep us beer nerds happy. that orangey pineapple flavor makes nice burps. why cant this be the world's bud?"
"A Hop Sun experience is amplified during a hot, muggy summer day when a great thirst has overtaken your mouth, tongue, and throat. A great session beer with an ABV of 4.4% - give or take a tenth. A guy with a beer ball of this stuff on his back serves it cold in the stands at my local AA ballpark. A superb alternative to the macro-swill that normally monopolizes sport stadiums. Excellent choice this summer..."
"Pours out clear light golden with a thinner white head leaving no lace behind,great aromas a real zesty/citrusy hop jumps out ya wich is unexpected but welcome along with a little buttery note that lingers softly.Alot of subtle but very refined nuances to this beer a dry wheaty malt backbone holds up well to a healthy dose of citrusy hop I mean its nearly perfect finishing pretty dry and buttery.Compares very well with Three Ffloyds G-Head man I like these hoppy American wheat ales!"
"Drinkability is excellent, refreshing and tasty with some definitive tastes, unlike some many lighter beers that just losse all flavor when trying to brew lighter fare. Another soild effort from the folks at ST."
"This is an obvious Americanized wheat beer, as its meant to be. The appearance is a dark gold with a fine white head. The aroma is hoppy and floral, with a comparable hop intensity to many APA's. The flavor is very crisp from the wheat with the citrusy kick of the hops. This is highly drinkable and thirst quenching, a sort of blend of SNPA and SN Wheat but really its own creation."
"Tongueland: Typical clean ST taste. Grassy wheat, dough-like, sweet fruit, sweet malts, touch of hop to balance, and dry yeast finish. A perfect summer session.Very dimensional."
"A combination of citrusy hops and wheat-based malt greets you in the nose of this delightful summer ale. It's deep gold body is slightly hazy beneath an average-sized head of bright white froth that, unfortunately, slips easily away. It does maintain a thin surface covering, however, and leaves sheets of tiny spots and splashes of lace that cling throughout the glass. It's crisp and slick across the palate with a light-medium body and very fine-bubbled carbonation. The flavor delivers the hops that the nose promises, along with a solid backbone of bitterness that leads it to a dry and citrusy finish. Clean, crisp and refreshing... worth trying!"
"Yellow-orange pour with a one-finger white head that remains for most of the time it took to drink it. Wow, I wasn't expecting this much of a hop aroma. Very strong bitter piney hops with some strong orange scents in there as well. Extremely juicy hop flavor with a lot of pine and bitterness thrown in there as well. The hops really dominate the flavor, and it's kind of hard to tell this one is a wheat beer and not an IPA until the wheat kind of slides in on the finish and lingers in the aftertaste. I really, really like this one's strong hoppiness on the wheat backbone. Probably the best summer brew I've had this early in the young season. Well done."
"Prosit!"
"I feel this is one brew that is just what it says it is...and that's a good thing...no surprises."
"Pours a pale, light yellow color with an average, unremarkable head. The nose is serious citrus and hops, sweet orange and apricot. The taste is lightly malty, with a big wheat-beer taste, full of lemon and grain. Its a light bodied beer, with a huge, satisfying taste. By the mid-taste, the hops start to kick in, ending with an aggressive hop finish. Its bitter and delicious."
"My first beer from Southern Tier. The only other beer I'd place in this category would perhaps be I'm so glad I got a couple bottles of each of their varieties at Half Time. Three Floyds' Gumballhead. India Wheat Ale. This stuff is delicious, probably immensely so in the summer heat. I'll be sure to try again next year."
"Hop Sun is my first Southern Tier beer and I'm impressed. It's tough to make a summer wheat stand out, but this beer is as radiant as Old Sol on a July afternoon. In fact, I'd love to have a few cases at the start of every summer. Thanks to HappyHourHero for the first of many bottles from New York State."
"This beer pours a beautiful hazy gold, especially bright for a beer. Head retention could use some work, though still lacy. I didnt smell much from this beer. Taste, however, was excellent. Amazingly refreshing, a very light beer. Citrus-like elements are dominant here, but very little confusion with the sweet malt and the light hop profiles. Pilsner-like, in the sense that this would go with nearly any meal. A great beer to try, a great conversion beer, and an excellent beer for any outdoor activities."
"Poured in an imperial pint glass, forms a 1/4"" white head, which laces acceptably. A sunny golden/amber brew, with a nose of some palts malts and a dominating hops scent. Taste seems almost two faced, with a pleasant pale malt flavor in one place, and hops going to town somewhere else. They work well together. Mouthfeel and drinkability are excellent. Wow, if this isn't a summer weekender, I'm ont sure what would be..."
"Drinkability & Notes: This has to be one of the best summer seasonals I have had to date."
"Pours out a light golden/amber color with a nice head that sticks around until the very end. Smell consisted of juiced hops along with some citrus aromas and some slight pine notes as well. Not bad so far. Taste was good. Some good malt undertones in this beer with the wheat and hops riding on top. Some nice citrus and pine aftertaste takes place but doesn't last all that long which was good to see, because if they did stick around, it could of become a little overwhelming. But this is a good pale wheat ale. Perhaps a litlte tough to find, but if you do see it, grab a case."
"Pours a deceivingly clear golden pils color with an off white head that leaves some good lacing. Smells gingery and hoppy; sans one's typical wheat ale characteristics. Very hoppy for a wheat ale, bordering IPA territory. The wheat shows up in the background of the malt profile. Very enjoyable and atypical for a wheat ale. Finished fruity sweet (blueberry?) and crisp. Kudos to the brewers at Southern Tier for reinventing the wheel in a summer quaffer. Usually when one thinks of a wheat beer, Hersbrucker or some other low alpha hop plays a minor role in the finished product. This beer is not that beer. A wheat ale for hopheads."
"Notes: Huge thanks to Schoolteacher for suggesting I pick some up while visiting the Empire State."
"The beer is so pale one might mistake it for a macro lager, but not after the first tasty taste."
"Given the summer conditions, I don't think you can go wrong buying a six pack or case of this beer."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has the best of both worlds. It has a light wheat/pale malt mix with a wonderful hoppy aroma that enhances the beer. The taste is great as well. It has a light wheat malt feel with a floral hop flavor that refreshes and makes this beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an awesome summer brew. It has great aroma and taste. What more can you ask for? This is a good drinker."
" A very tasty and easy to drink Summer ale. Hell, I could drink this anytime, especially as a starter beer. This is a great choice for introducing newbys to craft beer IMHO."
"The hop aroma is green and somewhat flowery--definitely dry hopped. This is evident in the taste, too. A touch of sweetness is noted in the flavor, although I could not detect it in the smell. (A friend claimed he tasted the wheat, but I didn't sense it.) The beer is full bodied and moderately carbonated. I wish this were available around Boston."
"Pours a clear, light gold. Slight thin white head. Hoppy tone to the aroma, as the name would suggest, offset with a subtle citrus (mostly lemon) tint. The mouthfeel is smooth and thin, very thin. The taste is a disappointment: indistinct, a little piney with a grainy hint, but the hops are pretty understated. An easy drinker for the warm months, and certainly a step up from macro-swill, but not really much to write about."
"Small, bright white head leaves scattered lace as it fades to a film. Nice piney hop aroma. Refreshing, resinous citrus hop flavor. Bitter sweet finish. Light, crisp mouthfeel. Hazy golden ""sun"" colored beer. Not your typical wheat beer, but a nice crisp refreshingly hoppy beer."
"Had this brew at Mahars the other night. The brew poured to a nice golden color with a nice sized pillow white head that had retention and left lacing through out. The aromas from this brew where all about the hop, pine and grassy notes where dominate with citrus highlights. I was very surprised by the aroma, was not expecting such a hop hit. Nice smelling brew! The taste is also dominated by the hoppyness of this brew, but your able to notice the malt and sweet flavors from the wheat. This is a fantastic brew for the hot months; enjoy this after working up a sweat working on the lawn, etc. The beer is a bit different but give it a try."
"This is sort of a frankentstein brew; wheat grainbill, pale ale hopping. It wouldn't be my first choice for hot summer refreshment due to the pine-resin hops, nor does the oddly sour wheat leave me licking my lips. By no means is it bad, it's just...a little too experimental. Southern Tier has been an excellent local upstart, but I hope they try something different next summer, maybe along the lines of allagash white."
"Appearance: Golden light amber nice white head leaves a full coating of lace on my mug, not bad at all. Aroma: A deep piney hop nose very nice mild citrus edge, noticeable bready wheat profile nice. Taste: High bitterness prodcues regular hop burps, light malt and wheat sweetness flavors of the hops over shadows but it's not unbalanced not overly bitter really nice summer wheat. Mouthfeel: Lighter bodied evenly carbonated lawnmower brew with a nice hop flavor. Drinkability: Refreshing and hoppy not very much like the typical American wheat ale, I like it."
"When I was having this with WVbeergeek at the Sharp Edge, I called this a ""wheat pilsner", and that's probably the best way I could describe it. A very strong hoppiness that dominates but doesn't totally kill the wheat, and Southern Tier has made another beer that I will be having in the future."
