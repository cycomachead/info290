Sweet bready aroma with some honey in there and some spice that I cannot make out.  Pretty good flavor, was expecting even more sweetness from the smell but still pretty sweet.  Not as much wheat as I expected.  The honey is there along with what seems like cinnamon and even some vanilla.  Really clean taste.  Good carbonation on the tongue when drinking, and the malts has me licking my lips between sips which is great.  Overall, a pretty good sweet wheat beer.","JamieDuncan","Jan 31, 2015"

Initially this beer really appealed to me. The first scents I picked up were floral notes. Tasting presented a clear honey note, and then hints of floral. Things went south from here. As I drank, the scent of the beer moved to overly sweet, and almost smelled ""flat"". Does not hold carbonation well in both bottle and draft experiences, and to me, this made the flavor feel heavy. As another reviewer said, maybe on a scorching summer day, this might feel and taste right, but I have not been able to finish the 6 pack I brought home.","Zackcavalier","Aug 30, 2013"

Aromas of subtle honey and lemon sweetness on a biscuit and wheat background. Smells like a cookie, almost. Flavors are rich and sweet on the forward tongue, almost like a Fall seasonal style. Rich, buttery tones on a biscuit backbone give the palate a heavier load than is usual for Summer beers, or wheats for that matter. Honey and banana highlights are accented with some cinnamon and clove spicing, leaning more towards the White style. No hops presence to speak of throughout the beer. The aftertaste is light, with some roasted qualities accompanying the dying sweetness. Clean, fairly crisp finish, the beer is kept light throughout by the carbonation and balancing flavors.","GarthDanielson","Aug 29, 2012"

A sip reveals a mellow, tasty balance between sweet malts and a mild vanilla/chamomile element going on. It finishes a touch sweet but not cloying. The mouthfeel is crisp and creamy. Overall, a unique take on an American wheat ale. It stands apart from the average american hefe for sure. Quite drinkable, and worth trying.","Finn","May 12, 2012"

However, I did learn from my experience to not judge this brew by its cover; don't be fooled from the clip-art label into thinking this is lightweight beer. The brewer certainly takes his/her art seriously, and you should too. I'll be on the lookout for more by this brewer in my area.","TheHoppiest","Nov 10, 2011"
4.17,13.6,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"An excellent organic wheat ale with a noticeable honey nose and a balanced honey taste upon drinking. A thick mouthfeel that reminds me of honey.

3.65,-0.5,3,3,4,3.5,4,"The appearance of this beer is misleading. Pours a goldenrod/orange yellow with no head to speak of. Lots of carbonation clinging to the outside of the glass. Smells of fresh baked bread and that's about it. Taking the first sip is indeed surprising, tastes of brown sugar, nutmeg and honey. Very little in the way of hops but slightly malty. Overall a surprising beer; glad I gave it a try!","Claudius424","Aug 19, 2011"

4.35,18.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a beautiful golden color, very summer-y. The aroma is delicious: honey and cinnamon dominate this spicy, flowery scent. Reminds me of Cinnamon Toast Crunch or Golden Grahams...yum. And taste leaves nothing to be desired: it's sweet, with a bit of a hops bite and a strong honey flavor. Combined with a crisp, refreshing mouthfeel, this beer is almost like candy; liquid alcoholic candy. This is a beautifully balanced beer, perfect for a summer afternoon. A very pleasant surprise for someone with low expectations for wheat beers.","BraveUlysses","Jul 24, 2011"
3.55,-3.3,3,3,4,3.5,3.5,"This is a very agreeable beer with a charming lightness to it. All of the action of this beer takes place within your first few seconds of ingesting it, and disappears before you even swallow. At the outset, the drinker is met with a crisp punch of sweet honey which rapidly dissipates to a neutral wheat taste. All around pleasant and inoffensive.","JamesRobbins","Jul 20, 2011"
3.57,-2.7,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a one finger white head that fades quickly, leaving traces of lace. Cloudy, pale amber color, yeast settles in glass. Light-medium carbonation and light bodied.

3.25,-11.4,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a thick frothy white head that fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a tart/citrus scent along with a basic pale and wheat malt aroma. The taste is average. It has a sweet and sour citrus feel with a basic pale and wheat malt flavor. It's muddled together and not very good. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation. This is a forgettable summer seasonal.

3.7,0.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Honey and wheat pretty much sums up what most people envision in a spring seasonal ... most. Sweet honey edge with some bready notes and a very fine camomile tea fill the nose. Had to take a sip to remind ourselves that this is a beer. Honey and wheat fit over taking the credit for the smoothness. Palate is semidry with up front camomile tea-like flavors; honey flavor diminishes quickly, though the breadiness form the malt pushes forward. Hops are very light, but everything is in bal- ance. For a delicate, dainty beer, it comes off as being drinkable, and the addition of camomile makes this beer EXTREME!","BeerAdvocate","Jun 28, 2011"
4.21,14.7,3,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"On tap at Iron Monkey in Jersey City. Serves in a pint glass. The beer has an initial honey aroma that is supported by its taste. It's light in color and slightly hazy as most wheat beers are. This, however, was less hoppy than I was expecting from an American wheat. It was very light in feel but had a nice honey and fruit flavor. The wheat taste didn't come through as much as I would like but the taste overall was very pleasant.","ESATIKKFAN","Jun 23, 2011"

3.85,4.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Sampled on May 19, 2011. This poured honey-amber with a quick head and slightly cloudy. The honey is noted in the aroma along with thinner wheat. The body has the sort of greasy texture of honey but not as heavy. The honey is in the taste but at the same time abstract with a slightly sharp hop finale. This seems like a very nice warm weather beer.","puboflyons","May 19, 2011"
3.08,-16.1,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Pours a hazy amber/orange with no head and reasonable lacing. Aroma is light, mostly of yeast, grassy, and some lemon peel. Mouthfeel is is light, with little carbonation.

3.73,1.6,3.5,3,4,4,4,"12oz bottle with a Bottled On Date of 041811 (I think). Pours a cloudy, bright burnt orange color with a 1/2 inch of head. Very little retention. Aroma is floral, grainy and bready. Flavor is mostly grains with a nice hint of honey to it. A bit floral with some sweetness that doesn't come from the honey. Maybe brown sugar and cinnamon. The mix of the honey with this one works really well and kind of surprised me how tasty it made it. Wheat beers are hit or miss in my experience, but this is a good one. Overall, I really liked this one and would consider buying a 6 pack of it.","PicoPapa","May 08, 2011"

4.07,10.9,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Wow, pleasantly surprised with this one. I had a pint at Volpe's in Emmaus, PA. Yes, you can taste the honey and chamomile (I'm not usually a fan of chamomile) but they're expertly balanced off the clean, crisp and distinct bready wheat malts. Typically I'd expect the spice or honey to dominate and define the beer, but really this is a complex American wheat that doesn't need to rely on massive hops flavor. Heck of a beer for the style, and just plain tasty overall. Check this out.","tempest","Mar 29, 2011"
4.12,12.3,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours a small half finger head that only hangs in there for a little bit, kinda disappointing there. The head is pure white and the body is orange, golden looking. It looks like a wheat beer should look, it's very cloudy and there is some sediment in the beer. It looks good despite the wimpy head. Well for starters on the smell you for sure get that flower smell, which smells really good, and then the honey and a vanilla smell, which both smell really good as well. The only thing that is a little off with the smell is the generic beer smell that I'm getting, which I don't like, but the beer still smells really good as a whole. Oh man, this beer is so f-ing tasty, wow. You first just get punched in the mouth with that honey flavor, then comes a little vanilla and that flower taste to polish it off. On some tastes I notice different things first, that's how well mixed in everything is. Not much in the way of hops or malts but who cares? Amazing taste, the generic beer taste is very small, if even there at all. Mouthfeel is a little thin for my liking of a wheat beer, but it's not the worst I've ever had, it's still got some back bone to it. Overall, the taste makes this a damn good beer, there are factors that are weak, and if they were better, this might be a perfect beer in my opinion. But as it stands now, damn good beer.","MaltsOfGlory","Mar 29, 2011"
