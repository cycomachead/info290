"Overall, yeah, a basic American Pale Wheat Ale, nothing more and nothing less."
""
""
""
""

"It feels like seltzer water, too, and the best I can say is that at least it's crisp. Even that tingle falls off in the end."

"The feel is lighy and crisp with more than moderate carbonation. It has a certain thinness but it is easy to drink."

"I enjoy blondes in the Spring (as well as brunettes, ravens, redheads)... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear brass-gold topped by a finger of relatively short-lived white foam. The nose comprises mild wheat, a kiss of grass, and a vague sense of citrus fruits. The taste brings in more of the same, with everything coming through a touch brighter and simultaneously a touch blander, as though everything were interpenetrating everything else to such a degree that the pieces are increasingly difficult to parse. The body is a hefty light, with a moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, an okay brew, nothing I'll overtly insult, but nothing I'll drink again on purpose."

"O - I'm not exactly sure why the other reviews slam this beer THAT badly. It's a little bland and certainly nothing to write home about, but it's not really terrible either. Am I buying it again? No. But I wouldn't turn down a free one if someone offered."

"O: highly drinkable alternative to a light beer. Certainly works as an accompaniment to yard work and summer weather. Not much flavor or aroma here, but no striking flaws in this refreshing brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: not much change from the blue moon base beer but the change hurts drinkability and adds little elsewhere."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Great tasting spring ale. Very close to a summe beer because of how easy drinking it is. The little bit of flavor really makes this beer stand out."
"O - My expectations weren't that high, but I must admit I was a tad disappointed. The citrus and orange notes were barely detectable, and the cereal malts were overwhelming. This was more reminiscent of a light adjunct than a flavoured wheat ale. I wouldn't go out of my way to try this again."
""
""
"This is a rather poor offering from the Blue Moon line. It's one dimensional and offers little besides grains. Avoid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I think this beer hits the mark for a slightly more interesting take on something like a Coors Light, etc. This is not an epic beer, or a complex beer but I think for a day on the golf course this beer would be great."

"Mouthfeel- Could barely feel my mouth due to excessive carbonation. I felt like i was drinking a talking rain tainted with malt liquor."
""
""
"overall this is a dumbed down version of a wheat ale that has very little redeeming virtue to it. quenching, yes. satisfying, no. weak, obvious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a transparent straw color with negligble head in spite of the vigorous carbonation. Aroma is bare and unappealing. Mouthfeel is perky on account of the carbonation, but the flavor is thin and watery, tasting of dilute, mass-produced wheat flavoring and mild cleaning solvent. This tastes almost like a Coors Light but with less purpose or identity. One of the most watered down beers I've tasted, and utterly forgetable if not for its inadequacy."
""
"Sweeter and fruitier than the run-of-the-mill light lager, but I can see the beer finding favor in the lover of those lagers who seek a more summery tone."

"Poured from bottle stamped JUL0912 to a Duvel tulip the beer pours a clear golden straw color with 1/2 finger white head with little retention or lacing. Looks average, really. The smells follows suit as there isn't much to report, a hint of wheat malt but that's about it. The flavor also is dominated by a strong wheat malt character, too much so. Little in terms of hop character or bitterness really. There isn't much aside from wheat. Adequately carbonated and light bodied. Overall, this is just an average beer. Not bad but not great. I'd easily pass on this again though it is easy to put down due to minimal taste, lol."

"O: this is a beer is just a tad above average to me. Maybe not something I would rush out to buy but I think I would have it again"
"Overall this beer is average to me. The smell and taste are not memorable, the beer is not that strong (5.4%) but I think it is smooth finishing and has some flavor to it. Would not recommend on a night out with friends but I am not going to thrown it under the bus driver from New Jersey either..."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle stamped JUL0912-CO5101620. Sampled on March 8, 2012. The best part about this beer is the way it looks with its golden yellow color, busy carbonation, clear clarity and small head. Beyond that the aroma is rather bland with a biscuti-like character and little else. The body is about right for the style as it falls into the light-medium range. The taste is also biscuit-like with a slightly bitter ending. I think it could have been better."

"Overall – The beer has a nice flavor, but for the most part is rather one dimensional. It’s refreshing and one for a hot day perhaps."
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pale golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some citrus notes. Taste is crisp, mild, slightly tart, some wheat and lemon, not exactly bursting with flavor. Feels light in the mouth and overall is a mediocre beer."
""
"O - This is a an okay wheat ale. There is nothing to make it stand out."
"Appears a very clear golden yellow with a disappearing soda head, which is sort of the exact opposite of what I expect on top of a wheat ale. Texture is very thin and watery, at least the carbonation is lively, but again that reinforces the soda notion in my head. Smells very much like the lemon-orange medicinal oily aroma from a Wet-Nap that has been soaking in a glass of diluted tonic water. Seriously, it actually does smell like that. Flavor is thankfully(?) a lot blander than the nose would have you believe, coming across as a sort of generic ghost of a wheat malt mixed with mushy stale oyster crackers and a twist of citrus. I'll be avoiding this one in the future."
"This brew pours a very clear and light gold, with a tight, thin white head that amounts to some decent lacing. A grainy nose is met with a little wheat aromas and the barest hints of orange and lemon. The flavor profile is much of the same, with grainy, husk-like malt blending with slight wheat, orange and lemon notes. A medium-high amount of carbonation rounds out this light bodied ale. After the great caramel maltiness of the Full Moon Winter seasonal, this Spring release leaves the pallet refreshed and renewed."
""
""
""
"The beer pours a yellow to orange color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of grain and wheat with not too much else going on. The flavor is more of the same, with a little bit of grain and orange citrus going on. I also get some other citrus but it is fairly faint. Medium mouthfeeel and medium carbonation."
"The palate doesnt live up...at first there is a fresh citrus but then a macrolager blandness washes across teh palate. Lemony zing tries to dance on the tongue in the finish but is weighted doen by an American Macrolager sweet adjunct malty effect. Weird--yet in th eend it's pretty refreshing, not bad."
"Overall- Not a bad brew, but I would prefer a regular Blue Moon over this."
""
""
""
"Overall - I think this beer would be a lot better in the summer.. but I do enjoy it quite a bit."
""
""
""
"O - Average at best, this might be the worst iteration of Blue Moon I've had. It's just not good."

"I handed this to my wife blindly and her evaluation was 'It tastes like wheat and Coors light.' I could not have said it better myself"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - While this beer does lack flavor, the flavor it does has tastes good and accomplishes being a refreshing spring beer."
"I detect mostly just light wheat, lemon peel, and carbonated water. And although it is simple, it's much more tasty, refreshing and pleasant than a regular Blue Moon."
"O: Where's the wheat? A blonde ale, perhaps, and a poor one at that. Coors should have stuck with Rising Moon and maybe played with the malts or yeast a bit. This brew is practically a a Bud Light Lime in sheep's clothing."
"Overall: Disappointing, considering the brewery...but not terrible."
"Overall: Hit or miss."
"O: It's an in-between brew, that doesn't try to be what it isn't. It's a spring time wheat ale and nothing more, while I feel that Sam Adams White ale is a better brew for the style, this one isn't too bad. It's a brew that true beer lovers would drink at a grill out and one that light ""beer"" drinkers wouldn't turn down."
"Crystal clear, tight head settles to nothing, no lace. Citrus and light grain nose. Light crisp lemony taste, with a dry wheat finish. There's something else there I can't quite place, but it doesn't taste good. Thin and fizzy, almost a drain pour."
"Overall this was very solid. Not the best I have had but not something I would shy away from. Very nicely done."
"I poured this into a pint glass, it has a clear yellow body to it with nothing of a head to it but a thin lace that you can barely see. The only thing i smell is a little bit of citrus and some hints of wheat. I get a sweet taste and citrus at the same time, on the back of the tongue is where the little bit of malt gets me. The mouth feel is ok. Overall not a good beer, but i would drink it over a BMC on a hot summer day."
"Overall: Not so good, really, and even a slight step down from the previous Rising Moon."
"I'll give it 3.0 overall, only because it's decently refreshing on a hot day (in the way a cold glass of water is), and there aren't any off or bad tastes. There's just barely any taste period!"
"O: Nothing flawed, but nothing really sets the beer apart."
"Served from refrigerator temperature into goblet. Pours dark golden with small head which dissipates quickly. Flavor is of malt and some sort of hops which I can't identify. Flavor is of separate malt and hops which aren't really well mixed. Neither is initially overpowering, but it isn't a single package. After a while, though, the malt begins to dominate. Overall, this is a very generic beer- more flavourful then most mass-markets but you can do better."
"Interesting looking beer here. The body looks nothing like a wheat ale, not cloudy at all, completely transparent, it looks like a lager, I doubt there is any wheat in here at all. The head on the other hand is really nice, frothy and about one finger in length, but of course it is almost gone now. The head is totally white and the body like I said looks like a lager, golden in color. The appearance overall is nothing impressive. On the smell you pretty much just get that generic beer smell, almost no other smells there at all. There is a small hint of lemon, but that's about it, no hops, small malt character, and no wheat. The smell is pretty freaking lame. Wow, that's not good, I wasn't expecting this beer to be this bad. Probably the most boring blue moon I've ever had, which is saying a lot. There really isn't anything to it, there is that small lemon flavor I picked up on the smell, and then that generic beer taste. There are basically no hops in here and very little malt. There is a slight slight feel of wheat, which just might keep the taste above a 2. Other than that there really isn't much to speak of. As for mouthfeel, it's ok because of that small amount of wheat, but pretty crappy overall. Drinkability is ok because it's so light, but still, nothing special there. It's only redeeming factor is the fact that it's refreshing, that's about it, other than that, not a good beer."
"Overall- They really missed the mark on this one. It does have a strong wheat taste but it is going to be a struggle to finish even a pint of this. Blue Moon isn't a bad beer but anything they try to brew otherwise, Honey Moon, this Spring ale, etc. turns out very rough to drink and missing many qualities of making it a decent ale."
"This? This is a wheat beer of some sort? There's nothing appearance-wise to seperate this from macro lager 52. Clear golden color, three fingers of white dense head that quickly fades, all that stuff. The aroma? Ugh. No. How does this smell so awful? It's basically just a super-cheap aroma. Hints of wheat, Pledge, and something that might have once passed for hops. The taste on this? Corn. Honey. Sticky-sweetness. It's passable, but just barely. I wouldn't really like another. The mouthfeel is thankfully thin, and the drinkability is alright. This is not a good beer. This is not a good beer at all. I'm fairly fond of the base Blue Moon, and Pale Moon is alright, but their seasonals aren't really all that great."
"Overall, this beer seems like just a bad version of blue moon to me. The taste is nothing you haven't tasted before, so therefore its not really a beer I would go out of my way to buy."
"Poured a pale straw color with little head on it. Smell is faint wheat and malt. Taste is average - kinda weak. Not a lot of wheat taste. Tastes cheap. Very light bodied. Not a bad tasting beer just nothing to it. Not worth the price at all. I will not be buying this again."
"O: OK. Falls a bit short. Perhaps a nice beer when your hot and you want it to go down quick."
"Pours to a thin white head (no retention) and golden color with filtered clarity. Aroma is wheat malt with none of the promised citrus to speak of. Flavor is clean, light and has a pleasant graininess with very little lemon or orange as promised. Light mouthfeel and generous CO2. Overall, a very bland, ordinary beer."
"As far as weissbeirs go this is not anything special. The mouthfeel is reminiscent of PBR or MGD, not how a wheat beer should taste. The beer has little to no body to it. The only redeeming characteristic of this beer is the smell, of course that could just be the lemon I added to it to make it tolerable. Not as bad as a domestic lager, but not worth the price, considering that it goes for the same as a Sam Adams or equivalent microbrew."
"This thing shouldn't carry the Blue Moon name. It should carry it's father's name (Coor's). This is what i pictured BL Wheat would taste like."
"Decent, but I probably won't purchase again with the better Keweenaw Bay Pick Axe Blonde cheaper and brewed closer."
"Light body and somewhat flat. Not at all crisp or refreshing or anything it aims to be. All around horrible."
"Pretty bad really even for Coors."
"D- Bad taste and it's a waste of money"
"Wow, can't believe I spent $7.99 a sixer for this trash. Someone should be ashamed."
"Weak sauce ... I expected a bit more out of this one. Not much to it at all and the addition of citrus fails IMO. They would have been better off sticking to their Rising Moon Spring Ale and simply tweaking as I said."
"D - Doesn't drink poorly, the more I had it the more I enjoyed it. But the flavors are on the weaker side with that damn off-putting aroma. Kinda dissapointed I have 3 more of these in the Brewmaster's pack I just bought..."
"Definitely would not buy again."
"Was very dissappointed in the generic and mediocre nature of this offering. Reminded me of Bud Light Wheat!!!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Very light body, high carbonation. Overall, this beer is pretty poor. I normally try to cut Blue Moon stuff a bit of slack, but I can't on this one."
"It is what it is: a weak imitation of a better hefeweizen. It is a *decent* effort but could use more work. To be honest, it could be worse though."
"Overall-so much for that Orange Peel, seems like imitation craft gimmickry, again Blue Moon drowned in OJ to me. Not many beers I despise, this seems to be one of them."
"Overall I would not recommend buying this beer but if you find it in you refridgerator not a bad offering."
"Pours a pale yellow with initially a good sized white head. Head fades quickly. Smells of lemon, orange and grass. Very grainy flavored with a hint of sweetness. Sharp lemon/orange flavors with some grassy hops. The hops are faint but they are there which suprises me a bit. Light bodied in the mouth. Not a great beer but not a bad one either considering the brewer."
"Overall this was a pretty mundane brew. When I think of spring beers I think of hops and this tasted like it didn't have any and relied on the citrus for its bitterness but it didn't do the trick. This might hit the spot after that first lawn mowing session of the year but other then that it's a one trick pony. I won't be buying this again."
"Incredibly unremarkable. I will take normal Blue Moon before this easily."
"Won't be picking this one up again. I'd rather just have a Blue Moon and that's saying a lot..."
"Thick white head and decent retention, minimal lacing. Crystal gold body. Extreme floral and grassy scent. Smells like the El Paso desert in the Spring, with a touch of womens perfume and soap. Sweet, hints of corn and hops. Extremely smooth mouthfeel. Goes right down without a trace. Not watery or full bodied, just a balanced mouthfeel that would go great with food pairings since it doesn't put a load on the palate. Depending on your mood, you might mistake it for bland. Floral, corny aftertaste, with crispness that eventually fades and lets the stickiness show. My main beef with this beer is that it's a called a wheat ale, but has none of the characteristics one would be hoping for when shopping for one."
"Pretty weak for a 'wheat ale.' poured into a tumbler the head reaches the top and dissipates very quickly. Orange-y yellow body. Smells yeast-y, sour, citrus-y and a little apple-y. The taste is grain dominated with hop bitterness. Very thin, a little gassy. Overall, not too pleasant."
"Extremely disappointing beer. Idk why it is priced at where it is especially since this tastes kind of like a miller light with a hint of lemon and orange. Overall really disappointed and needs more flavor like their other seasonal fall and winter beers."
"d-like most of the Blue Moon beers this is pretty drinkable."
"Not alot to say about it, it is what it is, has a slightly above average taste, smell is grainy. pours yellow, smells wheaty. Taste sort of seems like it attempts to get interesting but then it falls flat leaving more flavors of wheat and not enough of the more interesting notes that almost make it taste like a belgian blonde. It however is crisp which is good. It doesn't have alot though going for it to make it interesting, just a bit more good then bad though making it drinkable."
"This company should stop. They should stop making new kinds of beer and they should stop creating attractive names and label art for their crap product. This beer smells like corn and 7up. It taste like soupy adjuncts. Loads of creamed corn and artificial lime flavor. Nothing resembling a wheat beer. If they hadn't filtered it, had some hop character, or tasted like anything besideds coors light with skittles it would be an improvement."
"Verdict - Slightly disappointed in terms of Spring beers after having Samuel Adams Noble Pils and then having this follow it up. I really enjoy the heavy floral and lime taste, but there isn't too much else going on for the beer."
"Clean and crisp. This makes for a good warm weather beer. Not too much to ponder here when it's said all and done."
"D - Not bad, it is certainly quaffable but I have a hard time coming up with a reason why I would want to drink more than one of these. There is nothing particularly offensive here, but aside from some bland coriander character there isn't any real character at all. Not really worth the effort of twisting off the cap."
"Atmosphere is okay. Appearance is not much to speak of. Nose is not bad...grain and lime. Flavor is a fair combination of grain, citrus, and sweetness. Overall, this is a decent quaff."
"D - Even for the style this isn't a very enjoyable beer Coors filtered out any good flavors that could have been there the only reason to get this is if like me are currently in a beer waste land and want to try something new"
"Smooth but light feel and drink and drinks more like, and viewed as, an American Blonde Ale rather than an APWA as the contribution of the wheat malt is minor for this brew. But then the body is light as well. Pretty generic."
"ok well i feel a little jipped by this beer. wheat beer typically is cloudy and this beer was as crystal clear as a mountain stream. that was a little odd. the smell was nothing special. and then when i tasted it, it was like a regular american light beer. normally i like bluemoon as a go-to beer cause most places have it if you go out to eat- and it makes for a good replacement for a boring old coors light with a meal. the blonde wheat however tasted just like a run of the mill boring american style beer. not a thing to get excited about."
"This was okay. As with all Blue Moon products, they're what I go to when there's no really good microbrewery option available. Nothing too impressive, but not awful either. I'd call the beer average."
"Pretty drinkable, but I think it's really caused by the lack of a bold flavor or something to that extent. Sessionable, but I usually go for bolder, richer drinks, so I'm probably not going to be quick on buying more."
"D - won't have too much trouble finishing a 6er, but won't be rushing out for another. I hope Coors is smart enough to produce this into the early summer where it belongs. until then you'd be better off with regular ol' Blue Moon"
"Appears bright clear golden body with a bright white head, forms thin speckled lacing scattered around the sides of my glass. Aroma has some sharp wheat notes with hints of sweet fruit notes. A touch of citrus peels and grassiness going on as well. Flavor hits with a marshmallow like cremay sweetness with hints of citrus peel bitterness in the finish, seems like a wheat infused cream ale really. Mouthfeel is light bodied, carbonation is moderate, overall drinkability isn't anything to write home about. It's actually hard to drink more so than any golden beer should ever be."
"D: I am note usually a fan of the style and this is not a good example of the style. It is easy to drink, but so is water. Doesn't come across as refreshing or pleasant. Not something I would reach for again. I haven't had a regular Blue Moon in many years, but my recollection is that is a better beer. The 2nd one that was left in the fridge will be served to someone who doesn't like beer. Not worth trying, waste of calories."
"Blue Moon Brewing Company--Adolph J. Coors Brewing Company Spring Blonde Wheat Ale--Seasonal Collection--A delicious wheat ale brewed with orange and lemon peel for a refreshing taste and a crisp citrus finish--2011 12 oz. Bottle. 5.40% ABV. 10 IBU's? (2.0 / 5.0) Wit? Thin foamy mild lace pillowy big white head. Fizzy bright thin straw wheat gold color. Mild wheat ester no hop front. Thin dry sweet bland light wheat ale body. Mild citrus no hop refreshing end. Where is orange and lemon? Sampled 1/5/2011. 6-Pack purchased for $6.99 at Fred Meyer--Ballard, Seattle on 12/31/2010."
"D: Much, much too sweet for my tastes. The flavors are pretty good, but the overbearing sweetness of the beer kills it for me."
"Drink: I grew up in Colorado and admit to having peed in the tubing river that Coors uses for their beer. That said, I very much dislike the company, but thought that this was a very good session beer. Sorry for peeing in your river Coors...NOT."
