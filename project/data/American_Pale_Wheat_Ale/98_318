3.46,1.5,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 1/15/2015. Pours hazy deep golden color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, banana, white grape, wheat, bread, light clove, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Okay aromas with solid balance of fruity/earthy yeast and bready malt notes; with decent strength. A bit too fruity/slightly metallic in the nose. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, banana, white grape, wheat, bread, herbal, grass, light clove, and yeast earthiness. Light yeast spice/wheat tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, banana, white, grape, wheat, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast and bready malt flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is a solid pale wheat ale style. All around good robustness and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 14, 2015"

Instead, I would consider this more of a basic wheat beer. As a hefeweizen, this one just falls short on most levels. Nonetheless, this remains drinkable and easygoing, and would make a a solid session drink or a fine starter beer for future craft beer fans.","secondtooth","Mar 28, 2014"

The mouthfeel lacks that creaminess that good wheat ales possess. I know that it’s only semantics, but Harpoon has no business calling this a hefeweizen. American pale wheat ales should not have the clove and banana aromas or flavors that good German hefeweizens have, so it’s not fair to put them in the same category. Also, if they were trying to make a hefeweizen instead of an American pale wheat ale, they failed miserably. This is a decent beer, especially for the summer, but I probably won’t seek it out again.","BlackBelt5112203","Sep 04, 2012"

It's a decent beer for warm weather, but it's too tasteless for my liking. Personally, I don't like this trend in commercial beers of brewing hefeweizens without the estery goodness. I see that one of The Bros' reviewed this in 2001 and he said it was one of the best examples of an American wheat. The recipe must have changed from 11 years ago. This is not a good representation of a hefeweizen and should be avoided if you want to enjoy and appreciate the style.","NJBrewer","Aug 15, 2012"

The beer's flavors are mild, and the body is smooth, but slightly sharp at the end from the carbonation. Palate of slight citrus highlights along the banana bread backbone, with some spicy notes throughout the keep it clean.

Lemon oil, spicy yeast, and maybe a trace of banana in the aroma. Flavor is lemon, resin, yeast, slight banana-honey flavors at times. Light-medium body is soft, frothy, dryish, and not as acidic as I expected (good). Although I stand by my decree against labeling American Wheats as Hefeweizens, this one stands slightly above that crowd; I believe mainly on the basis of the hop flavors and slight esters that seem to dampen the acerbic citric-yeast tartness that overpowers most AW's.","CuriousMonk","Feb 02, 2011"

2.42,-29,4,2,2,4,2.5,"On the grounds of being labeled a Hefeweizen, this beer did not deliver. It has the right appearance, and the aroma was almost on par for the style (though it strayed a bit). The mouthfeel was very carbonated which is typical, and medium to light bodied. That's where it ends. The taste of the beer (IMO the most important part) was that of a skunky lager. It had MUCH more hop presence than should be found in any beer claiming to be a Hefeweizen and it totally lacked the banana and clove character of the style. If you want a REAL Hefe from a domestic brewery, go pick up Sierra Nevada's Kellerweis.","Thornton33","Aug 15, 2010"

The flavor comes on with bubblegum sweet wheat and tangy citrus. It has a lively feel with tasteful carbonation in a medium-light body. Very fresh and crisp feeling, nice for a cold and very easy drinking brew. The flavor factor is fine, the feel is good, but it's up to the best in this class at all.

Light tasting enough for some non craft drinkers, and just enough clove and banana with a slight hint of juicy fruit for me. UFO does come across a bit thin but this may add to the drinkability... even more so in the summer I would say. I do love a good wheat beer and this is one I greatly enjoy. I am very picky when it comes to wheat brews, I feel a lot of brewers leave balance to the way side, or maybe its just my tastes.

The aroma is very wheaty with a bit of creamyness in there, but overall, there is not a whole lot going on in this one. The first sip brings a fairly grainy flavor that is overlayed with a wheat creamyness. There is some very faint lemon zest hiding in the background that comes on in the finish. There is a touch of herbal/floral hop in there that just kisses the side of my tongue along with a mild bitterness, and these flavors really blend into the grainyness overall. Mouthfeel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. It has more body than I would have expected, but this is a good thing for this brew. Overall, this one is not a bad example of the style. It has a nice residual hop flavor and mild bitterness that carry through on the finish.

There were no sharp spices/clove that caught the tongue, no real banana or orange or something of that nature that was picked up or anything like a fruity aftertaste on the backbite. For those who like their hefe's/wheat beers real light on the citrus and more leaning on the hoppy part will like this beer a lot, but I tend to stray towards the more sweeter, fruitier hefe's/wheat.

The taste is just too watery, too light bodied, not enough of the banana flavors and not enough syrupy consistency to leave much of an impression.

The substantial, bright, off-white head is made up of fine (and at first fizzy) bubbles that last longer than expected, eventually falling away into a thin collar. I don't see the ""unfiltered"" part, though. Smell invokes a weak-grained pilsner initially but rounds out soon after. The wheaty grains remain in the nose, of course, but are joined by a bit of spice and hints of buttered popcorn. Light, clean grains dominate the taste, which is itself nicely complemented by the light, crisp mouthfeel. I prefer a German hefeweizen anytime, but this fits into its niche nicely.","BitteBier","Jul 17, 2007"

Ripe fruit ester and mild tartness suddenly become apparent, and create a unique ""pseudo-hefe"" yeast character that sets it apart from other American Pale Wheat ales. Drying aftertaste, with fading wheat and background low alpha-acid hop bitterness. Light body and high carbonation compliment the crisp yeast notes. Finishes dry with mellow ester, slightly vinous fruitiness, and very highly drinkable.

The tang of citrus is the first taste that crosses the palate, then the bread and yeast flavors start to combine with the citrus. That flavor slowly fades away as each taste is swallowed. In the mouth it is lite, but not watery, it has some consistancy to it, plus the carbonation is very strong. This is a very refreshing beer, easy to drink(even with the high amounts of carbonation), and is pretty smooth going down. A good beer for the very hot summer days.","cameraman","May 30, 2006"

The taste was good with plenty of malt taste, mild bitterness, and some fruity taste. Yet, it was still an average hefe weizen in my mind. The mouthfeel was average with a medium carbonation.

This is not a hefeweizen if you're hardcore into German versions, but by itself it's a good drinking wheat beer. Very light bodied though, with light carbonation.

The aroma is really the best part of this entire beer. The flavor is bready with a strong malt influence and some sour yeast flavor. There is a hint of alcohol and an earthy mushroom flavor. The ending is slightly watery. The flavor is convuluted and and more annoying than enjoyable. The beer feels strongly carbonated in the mouth though it doesn't look like it in the glass.

Initially feeble, vaguely grassy (from hops??) aroma finally develops into hints of dry yeast and lemon curd with warmth. Even after swirling the hell out of this glass, the strongest aroma I get out of it is maybe a bit of cinnamon. Nosefeel is practically nonexistent. After a full minute of holding a sip in my mouth, suggestions of honeydew (?), white grape juice (?), peach (??) and the faintest bit of clove (?) emerge in the flavor. Sure seems they filtered out the flavor, anyway. Any lasting tastes get washed out due to the flat, watery mouthfeel which, at best, grants it a modicum of drinkability.

3.35,-1.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"This beer pours a cloudy yellow color with a small head that leaves very little lacing on the glass. The aroma is a little wheaty with a tiny citrus hint. The flavor is a little malty, but mostly it tastes like a slightly watered down weiss beer. Not bad at all, but it is a little too watery for me.","clvand0","Aug 25, 2003"
3.55,4.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"12oz. bottle poured into a weizen glass. It pours a slightly hazy gold color with two fingers of head, a little small for a weizen. There is a bit of lace left on the glass. The only things detected in the smell were malt and a hint of citrus. Very very malty nose. The taste is extremely malty as well. Hints of lemon and other fruit are present. The mouthfeel is a little light and oily. The drinkability is fair. Not too bad for an American weizen.","SheepNutz","Aug 24, 2003"
3.8,11.4,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured a nice off yellow with the trademark Hefe-Weizen haze. Almost no head. Smells of a strong citrus presence with the grain in the background. Taste is quite good with a nice solid Hefe/grainy mouthfeel. Tastes like it should. A very drinkable brew from a very good brewery.","yankeeheel","Aug 15, 2003"
3.48,2.1,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured a cloudy golden yellow color and had very little head. Had an average citrus smell that is common to many wheat beers. It's taste was smooth and refreshing. The mouthfeel of this medium-bodied beer was smooth and creamy. Good drinkability too and great for a summer afternoon!","yosh","Aug 07, 2003"
2.76,-19.1,3.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,3,"At the Brewery: Standard appearance for a Weizen, straw yellow and cloudy with a white foamy head. Has a sweet wheat malt aroma yet lacked the bready yeasty aroma I've grown accustomed to in this style. Body is medium with a slight crispness. Flavor is weak though and not a true weizen flavor. Lacked character and depth.","BierReise","Aug 07, 2003"
3.69,8.2,3,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Taste: Thin and lacking for the style. Not a bad summertime choice if nothing else is available, but there are many American wheats I'd choose first. Refreshing and banana-y, with a slight citrus backdrop. Finishes smooth and creamy, but still lacking.","rabidawg","Jul 28, 2003"

3.05,-10.6,3,3,3,2.5,3.5,"Pours a hazed golden hue with a healthy sized two finger head and leaves a brilliant layer of lacing around my pint glass. This beer is definitely a bastardized example of a wheat lies under the American wheat category in my opinion. Aroma has slight lemony tones with hints of a metallic offness to it, no special fireworks missing some serious yeast characteristics. The taste is a slight buttery sweetness with some contrasting hop bitterness apparent in the flavor profile. Slight mild banana tones with a nice smoot finish one refreshing beer. Mouthfeel is a light to medium bodied and this example of a hefeweizen is a bit under carbonated in my opinion. The drinkability factor is good but nothing extradordinary from this mediocre Americanized classic style of yeast with wheat.","WVbeergeek","Jun 21, 2003"
4.09,19.9,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this was. Definitely on the sweeter side of the spectrum with wicked drinkability and was moderately complex keeping my taste buds happy all the way to the bottom of the glass.","bmills1608","Jun 15, 2003"
3.75,10,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"This beer poured a hazy light gold color and formed a huge bubbly white head that left trace lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt, hops, banana and cloves. A flavor of hops, some malt and citrus. A fairly light finish and another good session hefe, but not up there with the top ones.","Wildman","Jun 11, 2003"
3.83,12.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Nice and yeasty with wheat flavors on top. A touch fruity. Nice hop balance with nice lemon overtones added by the lemon. Redhook Hefe is my favorite local Hefe, but this is a close second. One of the better american hefeweizens on the market. Great to see this on tap all over Boston.","scottum","Apr 14, 2003"
4.08,19.6,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"UFO is up there with the most refreshing and best summer time brews. It poured a cloudy pale yellow color with a pure white head that had decent retention. Very fine sediment, no visible particles. Aroma is citrusy, lemons mostly along with some banana notes, very crisp. Taste was very smooth, citrusy hops with a pleasantly bitter finish. Again, very refreshing and also very drinkable - putting down a 6pack on this warm spring night should not be a problem. Highly recommended, this unfiltered exterrestrial entity is a must buy.","nixhecks","Apr 12, 2003"
3.7,8.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Tastes very crisp, lemony, wheat mouthfeel. Not much like a true hefeweizen, but a nice refreshing brew nonetheless. Reminded me a bit of Saranac's wheat pilsner. If this were just a little bit fuller-bodied and sweeter, it would be a very good brew for hot weather.","shirfan","Mar 29, 2003"
3.03,-11.1,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Cloudy amber beer pours with a white head and shows good retention. The smell is yeasty with a hint of coriander and citrus. Not bad, but nothing special. The taste is very mild, with malt, bitter hops, and some yeast all noticeable. It is fairly well balanced, but doesn't impress. The mouthfeel is thin and watery and leaves you yearning for just a little more malt body. The drinakbility is again average, as the flavor isn't overly satisfying and neither is the mouthfeel. A decent beer, but there are so many other hefe's that are more enjoyable that I don't expect to buy this one again.","aaronh","Jan 30, 2003"
3.26,-4.4,4,3,3,3,4,"Purchased a six pack of this beer. Followed the directions for pouring, down to the very swishing of the product. Cloudy and light. My conclusion: bland, with little taste. No wonder Harpoon recommends putting a lemon in it. They should put this out in the summer.","bewareOFpenguin","Jan 19, 2003"
3.93,15.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"The beer is a cloudy, golden color with very nice white foam that leaves good lace down the glass. The aroma is modest but with citrus and wheat coming through. The taste is good and smooth (wheat and yeast) but with a nice bitter hop finish. The mouthfeel is dry, medium body. The drinkability is very good for this refreshing hefeweizen style beer.","UncleJimbo","Jan 19, 2003"

3.7,8.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Harpoon's ""UnFiltered Offering."" Interesting name, rather standard wheat brew. Pour is a cloudy yellow with substantial white head that makes its presence known but for only a few seconds. Aroma is mostly earthy with some fruity characteristics, as well. Taste is somewhat sweet, citric and bitter all at once, in a good way. Mouthfeel is not bad, if a little over-carbonated. Could probably put back a few of these on a hot summer day, but I would probably elect for something else. Not to say it's a bad beer, I think I've just been inundated with wheat beers.","Jon","Nov 08, 2002"

4,17.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Very much in the American style of hefeweizen - yeast was a moderate flavoring component, clean without much contribution from the yeast other than a light bready flavor.  Very smooth and drinkable, and nice warm weather choice.","Brent","Jul 11, 2002"
3.83,12.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I am never one for American Hefewiezens, as they usually try to have too much of a tang in order to replicate the Germans.  However, this is one of the better Amercian versions I have tried.  A good amount of yeast is present, yet is not definable.  Crisp and tangy yeasty kick, but not overly.  Faint spice here, but again subtle.   This beer does not try to be more than it is, and that it why it is so enjoyable.","AaronRed","Jun 23, 2002"

3.81,11.7,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Pours a hazy bright yellow with a thick, creamy white head.  Smell is slightly weak and contains mostly wheat with slight yeast.  Taste is full of wheat but slightly lacking in the yeast department.  The yeast flavor is there but is a little on the weak side.  Nice creamy mouthfeel and very drinkable.  Not a bad offering from Harpoon, it could use a slightly fuller yeast flavor but beyond that it is a great offering.  At $2.75 for a 20 oz. draft and being as drinkable as it is, you will find me drinking it all night.","Murph","May 09, 2002"
4.13,21.1,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Nice deep yellow color with white foamy head. Good haziness like a good wheat should have.  Wheat malt is apparent in the flavor.  Crisp finish with a light to medium body.  This is a brew one can stick to for an evening.","beernut7","May 07, 2002"
2.73,-19.9,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,"Decent thirstquencher with balanced wheat flavor. All in all I think this is way too understated. Nothing is jumping out and grabbing me. Laughable that they call this a hefe. There is tartness and tasty citrus qualities - but there isn't any flavor. I would venture to say a larger dose of yeast could do the trick. However, it is not entirely unpleasant, each sip leads to another, and it's a real winner in the thirstquenching department. Good pick for a hot day, and could actually be an ok choice for someone who hasn't had any experience with hefes and doesn't want anything overwhelming on their first try.","Thrasher","Apr 19, 2002"
3,-12,3,3,3,3,3,"I wasn't crazy about this beer.  I couldn't detect too many of the classic hefeweizen flavors or aromas.  I guess it compares favorably to American competitors, but stick with the Germans if you want the real thing.","pbrian","Apr 04, 2002"
