What I wouldn't have given for one of these beers out of a cooler at lunchtime. Sadly, as a high school English teacher, beer is frowned upon in the building.

There is a lot going on here and the flavor profile does a good job of highlighting the locally grown wheat. The other flavors support and balance out the wheat.

Taking a sip, I get a light wheat, light herbal hop with a tailing bitterness, hat clings to the side of my tongue. It is extremely clean without a lot to it. Mouthfeel is light with a moderate to strong carbonation that stings a little on my tongue. I'm torn with this brew because it has been such a nice one to take camping for sitting around the fire and for enjoying in the heat of the day.

There's no off flavors or flaws in here which is most important when drinking a summer quencher like an American Wheat. Capital always shines in mouthfeel and drinkability and this is no different.

They make it seem crafty and unique in its gimmick - it's made from wheat exclusively grown on Washington Island, right off Door County - but this is probably the most boring beer I've had from Capital.
