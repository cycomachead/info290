"Pretty Smooth and not strong flavor, like a more beer water"

"Enjoyed from the can in a pint glass.  This blonde ale pours a lightly murky blonde with a moderate white head that dissipates quickly to a light ring and little lacing. Nose of lemon zest, orange zest, wheat, and light sweet bread.  Flavors follow the nose rather simply with lemon zest and orange appearing to the back followed by a light coriander bite, a mellow wheat flavor is also present on all sides.  Drinkable standard American Pale Wheat.  Perhaps a step up from Blue Moon as a decent session ale after a nice day of mowing the lawn.  All in all, nice without being overbearing on the citrus flavors with a smooth flowing mouth feel and light carbonation.  Solid ale."

"I like this and didn't think I would. Smells like cheap beer, but is smooth going down. Mellow flavor, this would be a great beer for newbies. Not the best I've had, but not a bad choice if you want something lighter."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled in 9/2014. Pours lightly hazy bright golden color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, orange peel, coriander, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, straw, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, spice, and earthy hop notes; with decent strength. Taste of lemon, orange peel, coriander, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, straw, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy herbal/spice bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange peel, coriander, wheat, cracker, bread, straw, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Good balance and robustness of pale malt, spice, and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a very solid spiced pale wheat ale style. All around good balance and robustness of pale malt, spice, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."
"Not much going for this brew. Extremely watered down, unbalanced, and low on flavor. I would rather drink a Pabst or Schlitz."
"Not that measure or taste"

"a generic blonde that tastes pretty good on the whole, and satisfies just fine when youve already been drinking all day, but probably cant hold its own against even the upper middle class of craft brewed blonde ales. its thicker, heavier, but that has its merit too. i like its uplifted carbonation and its thin sweetness. medium tinny middle though, and an old semi-stale hop complexion thats underdone and missing something. still, its refreshing in the right context, not as good as others from these guys, but a decent brew. i always find it a little weird when a brewery can rock out a barrel aged imperial brew, but cant dial in a real basic thing like this one, it almost seems lazy or complacent rather than incompetent, and maybe thats a greater offense..."

"O: A sold beer if you have been working outside all day and need a refreshing brew. Of you looking for a flavor bomb try something else."
""
""
"Sorry guys, it just wasn't good."

"Overal, a pretty unispiring beer. Refreshing on a very hot day, perhaps, cant think of any other positive reason for buying it."

"This is a cloud pale gold with a small head that quickly fades to film. The aroma is unpleasant... very vegetal. Ugh, flavor follows the smell, except also doughy, limpid, disgusting. Glad I only bought one of these. Probably the worst beer I've had in at least a couple years."

"Favoring a sweeter finish, the ale appeals to fans of fruitier and sweeter ale. But its reluctance to dry in finish limits its drinkability and refreshment. Its fruity center does however make this dirty blonde an irresistible choice."
""
""
""
""
"More fruit-forward than I expected. Certainly not the most complex profile, but a drinkable beer. Could use more wheat and malt character, along with some hops."

"i give this a 3.0. i would not buy this beer at the store for enjoyment, however i would have again if offered at a gathering where it was accessable vs. the Buds and the Millers."

"Lacks any kind of a kick. No head retention. If you don't aggressively pour this beer it has no head to start with. If you pour aggressively the weak bubbly head won't last two sips. Seems to taste better while cold. if you drink it slowly it'll lack any flavor at the end. Nice color but very weak carbonation. Not my cup of tea. I'm by no means a hop head as summer brews, helles, kolsch and Belgian Saison are my favs. I thought I liked Pale Wheat Ales but this one is telling me I don't."

"Slightly hazed body, eggshell white head forms a cloudy three fingers worth with fine even lacing. Aroma has a nice sharp wheat and citrus combo with very mild spice additions, limited coriander which is usually a good thing for my palate. Flavor wise there's some biscuit bread dough layers with a very chalky yeast in the finish, slight hint of citrus peel and coriander with a relatively lackluster overall flavor. Carbonation is light, not much on the palate as far as textures go but still not a horrible beer, under 4.5% it's light and refreshing and keeps you wanting to experience the next sip. It has a trademark Atwater characteristic it misses the mark on the style and ends in a generic watered down version of a witbier, I appreciate it for what it is but can't really look at this as a beer I want to keep buying."

"The flavor has a refreshing crispness to it. I get more life from the flavor than the aroma—there’s some coriander and orange peel, with a more pronounced yeasty ester profile. However it drops off with a flat finish and an unwelcome malty corn sweetness. Not one I’d have again."

"Trying the Dirty Blonde...that's how I like my blondes!!! Anyway...the beer pours a cloudy yellow with thin white head that is not lacing. The smell includes orange zest and floralness. The taste carries much the same as the smell but has a nice wheat base to it. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with decent carbonation. Overall it isnt a bad beer."

"I must ""down-rate"" this beer because it is labeled as a Belgian white, but comes across more like a nut-brown. Very sweet, caramel, roasted malt and nut flavor. I was convinced there was a bottling-line mix-up, but it has the hazy appearance of a wit, although a bit more golden-hued than straw-colored. I struggle to find the orange and coriander amidst the cloying sugariness and roasted grain flavors in this brew. If this were a nut-brown, I'd probably give it good marks."
""
"Poured into a weizen glass. Color was a slightly cloudy golden color with a 2 finger bubbly head. Head quickly started to dissapate, but switched to a thicker foam as it went. Fair amount of carbonation rose from the bottom. Didn't cling at all. Aroma was slightly grainy, but also seemed a bit sour. Flavor came across as a very watery fruity flavor. A hint of banana, but all was on the thin side. Felt overly watery in the mouth. Needed a little more chew, but was nicely carbonated. Overall not terrible, just seemed a little off."
""
""
""
""
"Slight drying in the finish. Forgettable little brew, would be decent on a very hot summer day with a light lunch. Besides that situation not much chance I would go for this one again"

"The Crack revealed another brimful CAN and the excitement led to an inverted Glug, it turn leading to a fizzy finger of bone-white head that quickly reduced to wisps. Color was a hazy lemon-yellow. Nose smelled more like a Wit (note from the CAN: ""Ale Brewed with Orange Peel and Coriander.""), thanks to the adjuncts. I definitely caught the orange peel initially, followed by the inherent spiciness of the coriander on the nose. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was much more like a Wit than an APWA. I would submit a correction, but the BFG program has been disestablished, so apparently the program will somehow pick up this discrepancy at some point. In the meantime, I will CANsider it as an APWA. It had a nice orange citrusiness on the tongue, followed by the peppery spiciness of the coriander. Finish was quite dry, very nice for summer. I'd take a Dirty Blonde to the beach with me."

"Overall: Eh. It's beer, and it's a little different, which is good on a tasting night like tonight. Still, won't be keeping this one in rotation."
"You know she's dirty 'cause o' the tramp stamp. And the fact she's a Tigers fan. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear straw topped by a finger of lightly cream-white foam. The nose comprises soapy orange peel, light wheat, and a touch of white bread. The taste takes this formula and adds a healthy amount of random funk, for lack of a better word, as well as a hint of lemon zest for the sake of it. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, a meek little beer, one that just plain didn't do it for me."

"D: Light, thin, lemony. Sort of a less than well done lemony summer beer. Not that anything is terribly worng, but nothing is very good either. Perhaps a hot weather throw ‘em back brew."
"Overall – Decent lawnmower beer but not on the buy list. I would not turn it down if I was offered one at a party."
""
"O: Good lawnmower beer, a basic wheat beer with a touch of fruit to help out. The ratings are low but don't be dissuaded, it's just simple."
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, pale, hazy, yellow-gold with a half inch, bright white, foamy head that settles rapidly into a thin film. Roasted malt nose, with a slight highlight of orange citrus and some spicing, but too faint to pick out specifics. The beer is watery, with a cereal roast initial flavor that stands over all other taste profiles. There is a tangy malt sweet highlight, and a splash of citrus, but all the flavors seem watered down, overall. The aftertaste is a very, very, very slight citrus tart, and the finish is blink of an eye quick. Not even long enough to think too much about the flavors that aren't there."
""

"O - While I’m not familiar with the style, I have to imagine there are much better blondes out there. This one is not my cup of tea. Looked rather gross and tasted average. Perhaps a hot summer day would have made a difference, but not much. Would opt to purchase something else."
"Beer from the D. Pale light yellow with a fizzy head throgh out. Aroma of orange citrus and fanit spice notes. Fresh grain malt summery flavor. It is like a tasty verson of a lager. An easy session beer. A decent drinkable beer to enjoy at a Tigers baseball game."
"After tasting Dirty Blonde I can see why the brew was classified [on B.A.] as an American Pale Wheat Ale as I thought that a beer spiced with coriander and orange should fall into the Witber style. Atwater, if you intended this brew to be a Witber you missed the mark."
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, a touch of wheat and oranges. Taste is good, orange, coriander, very refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall this is a highly enjoyable summer time beer."
"Poured a slightly cloudy light golden-yellow with a fizzy white head that didn't retain much at all. Grainy, bready aroma, lightly toasted, with hints of citrus zest. Similar taste, biscuity, grainy, a yeasty sensation, mild wheat profile, crisp citrus an a touch of spice. Pretty good blonde ale, but not really my style. Light body, and fairly drinkable for a hot summer day I suppose."
"O - Very acidic, over carbonated, didnt like this much but I could see a niche. It reminds me of Summer Shandy and lovers of that might really like this too."
"Overall, I'd say this is an ok beer to drink on a hot summer day, but for the price I was hoping for something a litter better."
"This beer has a lot of carbonation. The body is a pale gold color. The head and lace are both frothy white. I was pretty disappointed overall with almost everything about this beer. Aroma is fruity and citrusy. I thought the flavor is very sour and remind me of a grapefruit. The body was thin and watery."
"Drinkability: While this beer is not bad, it is certainly not good. If I want some wheat beers, there are better ones. If I want something light and refreshing, there are better things."
"Well this was not an exciting beer. The golden deliciousness of it's looks soon gave way to a quickly fading head. No carbonation lead to a flat taste (beer was not flat though). This is a very light bodied beer with no ill affects on the tongue as it passes by. Not a bad taste, but a little boring. Would probably be good on a very hot day when all you want is something cold."
"O: Overall I feel that this brew falls short of style and does not represent a refreshing summer ale very well. The main concern I have is the astrigent lemon aspect and the high level of carbonation that gives a soda sensation. This is a slightly older bottle that a friend gave me, which they are still selling in store, past prime, but still on the market (maybe it should'nt be sold this far past bottling)."
"The only reason I'm giving this a 3.5 is because out of a bottle the taste was stronger, I should have just kept to drinking it out of the bottle because once poured this is a very unappealing beer."
"Great name and label but a boring beer. Poured only a 1/4"" head which completely dissipated. Straw yellow color. Not much of an aroma at all, even after warming up. Very mild flavor and yes it has some orange peel and coriander but not really a showcase amount of it. Where's the excitement here folks? Not dirty, barely blonde."
"Overall this was a pretty lack luster brew with not a lot going for it. It seems like this beer was trying to be a nice summer time witbier like oberon but instead it came out too watered down. I don't think I will be revisiting this brew anytime soon."
"Not a lot to say about this one that's any better than ""average."" Taste & smell are both thin & a little flawed, & the mouthfeel is just kind of weird. Can't say I'm a fan."
"Pours with a slight yeasty haze. Light-golden color. The initial off-white head of about 1/2 inch dissipates almost immediately. Carbonation is light. The malt is very light with hints of straw. Some petillance on the initial palate, followed by a light center and finish. The finish is rather short. The body is very light. Lace does not form. The orange peel and coriander is not evident. Some ale and wheat characteristics in the nose, albeit very faint. Somewhat sweet and slick The alcohol is not noticeable. Refreshing but exciting."
"This didn't have the grass and clove taste that most Witbiers do but nevertheless, it's a good summer offering. Because the ABV% is low, it's not hard to down a few in a sitting. Nothing stands out about this but for me, it was a pleasant surprise and a fitting drink during the warm nights that we've had so far this month!"
"This ale comes out of the tap a hazy light golden yellow with a decent white head. Aroma is not strong but fairly wheaty and appealing. Flavor is firm and wheaty with a good citrusy, mainly lemony, undertone. Texture is fairly smooth and quite fizzy."
"D - Maybe if you like a one note beer made with a single spice...it would be for you. It simply is not for me."
"Cheers!"
"I picked up a single bottle of this from State Line Liquors in Elkton, Maryland when coming back from a trip to Baltimore. The appearance is a honey color a head just smaller than one finger, an good looking beer. Smell is a bit of citrus, but very faint other than that. Taking a sip, the taste has lemons, but also a near soapiness to it. Mouthfeel has more of that citrus, which is nearly overbearing. The drinkability of this beer from Atwater Block is not very good due to the aforementioned characteristics."
"Overall, a better beer from Atwater. Normally their beers have been pretty bad, but this one is at least palatable. I would buy again if there was nothing I haven't had yet and in the mood for a lighter refreshing beer..."
"Drinkability is just ok. It does go down easy and is pretty crisp, but the lack of complexity in the flavor doesn't make me want to come back for more."
"A decent wit beer, especially for the price i paid ($3.50 six-pack off a buddy who bought a case, thanks neil)"
"Overall a decent offering and better then I thought it would be although still nothing special."
"D- It was a touch over-spiced for my taste, which would keep me from drinking more than 1 or 2 in a sitting. I'd like a little more ""beer"" and less flavoring. It wasn't quite as refreshing as other examples of the style."
"Drinkability: I suppose I could drink a few of these in a sitting. But why would I want to?"
"Cheers!"
"d- tough to get a whole bottle down. Atwater usually makes enjoyable stuff, but they missed on this one. seems to me that they tried to copy SA summer ale but totally came up empty."
"The only positive thing that I can say about Dirty Blonde Ale is that it isn't as horrendous as most of what Atwater Block brews. Instantly forgettable beer is preferable sometimes because the truly wretched ones tend to stick with me longer than I'd like."
"Misses the style badly, not impressive when held to any standard much less your average APWA. About what I'd expect from Bud Light with Lemon. Glad I only bought one."
"D - This is an okay wheat beer. Just too much lemon for it to be a regular in my fridge."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my standard shaker glass. The ale appears a hazed deep yellow color with barely a finger of quickly fading off white head. Nose and flavor are of lightly toasted grains, sweet dinner rolls, very mild notes of citrus and spices. A tad thin in body with ample carbonation. As with most beers from this brewery, simply not worth your time or calories."
"On-tap at Liberty St. Tavern in Allentown, PA. Appears hazy dark blonde. There's nothing very remarkable about this beer. It was a slightly sweet wheat malt flavor so it kind of just tastes like sugary liquid bread. No hops to speak of and while it's easy-drinking and balanced, it's not really a pleasure to drink. It just does nothing for me."
"Pours a hazy golden with a thin white head. Not much retention,but a decent lacing. Aroma is of tart fruits. Body is light with a bit of carbonation.Taste is of orange peel and sweet tart fruits. This is a little too sugary for my taste, but you might like it."
"Overall a decent wit. What it lacks on complexity it makes up for in drinkability."
"Pours a hazy light yellow color with a small head that fades very quickly. The beer leaves no lacing at all to it. The smell is of wheat with a hint of floral aromas. The taste is of wheat with a little hint of citrus. There is a moderate to high amount of carbonation. The overall drinkability is okay. It isn't very complex and the beer leaves you wanting more as opposed to other wheat beers."
"It's got low abv and it goes down easy, it's just a little too sour/acidic for my liking."
"Drinkability: A great session beer. Not a mind-blowing beer, but it sure is smooth, tasty and easily approachable. A sizer would go down easily. Worth seeking and trying."
"First sip is refreshing...like water. Bland, bland, bland. fizzy, then nothing. There's a slight citrus/spice/irrelevant note. A bad beer."
"Credit for Bottle Art. Pours an ultra pale hazy golden color, visibly effervescent, with a loose foamy white head that fades quickly to spotty patterns of lacing. The smell is descent. From the bottle residue it was sweet and the initial pour was all about the orange peel with hints of the corriander that got stronger as it warmed. The mouth feel isn't as lively as it appears although it is light. The wheat flavor is initially strong up front then the spicy character kicks in. Drink it quickly while its cold."
"D: Overall better the average showing here. A nice dry pale wheat backing with wet citrus and lime notes blend together making for a decent summer time blonde. Goes down easily enough, would beat the heat with just the right amount of abv at 4.5% making for a good lawnmower beer."
"D - In conclusion, I don't know whether I personally like this beer or not. I got one of these for a friend so I'll be interested to see the reaction to this beer. Very few reviews on here and the range is pretty big. Overall, I believe this is sessionable and a nice summer brew"
"The other beers I've had from this brewery have had a tart/sour undertone. Maybe because of the style, it works well here. It's an American Pale Wheat with wit spicing, that works well here. A refreshing summer-time brew!"
"Hazy blonde with a skim of white foam that leaves a little sliding lace on the glass. Smells of dishwater, orange candy and faint spice. Tastes kind of like an orange dream = Orange and vanilla ice cream soda with some mild yeasty funkiness. Light bodied and creamy. Tastes too artificial and processed for me."
"Overall- Weak and watery but easy to drink and slightly refreshing on a hot day."
"D- too much carbonation. im glad i only bought 3 because they hard to put back and gives you gas."
"Not a very good beer. I think Atwater has some issues in the bottling line. Not recommended."
"Pours a hazy light gold,with a thin white head and some sediment floating about.Aroma of orange peel,coriander, some hints of grass,and other faint spices.Nice crisp fruit flavor,spice,and hops,would liked to have tasted more of the wheat,thin body,nice mouthfeel.Pretty darn drinkable."
"Drinkability is ok... could work nicely with an order of hot wings."
"pours a cloudy yellow with a two finger white head that looks good for a minute or two then quickly fades. very faint aroma of citrus and coriander. sharp taste of citrus more lemon than orange with a slightly pepper finish. mouthfeel was watery no body to it. lacking in many ways."
"I was looking forward to this one as i'd yet to try it. it came to me in a glass and the foam had been poured off. this isn't the fault of the brewer so maby it had great head. the main problem with this beer was infection. I'm sure it was an infection because when i sniffed it i thought for a second maybe i was at the movies about to dig into a 12 dollar medium popcorn. it had a very noticeable diacetyl aroma and taste. past the buttery flavor i could taste blueberry almost which i'm sure wasn't intended either. it'd be interesting to taste one from a different batch."
"Served in a tumbler. Poured a pale, translucent straw color with lots of tiny effervescent bubbles and some tiny yeast floaties. Two inch, rocky white head began to collapse within seconds before settling into a thin foamy cap. Some lacing, but poor adhesion. Scent was clean, pale wheat, some citrus and a light hoppiness. Taste was weak and watery; a pale comparison of the nose (no pun intended), with a great deal of citric acid coming forth. Mouthfeel was bitingly astringent and light-bodied. Carbonation was also a little high. Considering this brew would and should qualify for a session beer based on style and character, I was dissapointed at how it all came together and how unrefreshing it was."
"Cloudy and muddled light orange body. Creamy one finger white head. Lace comes in droopy rings. Strong aroma of coriander and orange peel. It's nice though. I like it. Plus some faint lemon zest and biscuity malt aromas. The flavor is a little too high on the artificial ""orange"" notes. There's some tangy wheat tones as well. A little too tangy and sour. Mouthfeel is a little flaccid and lifeless. This one is average at best."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light pale wheat scent along with a bit of coriander and orange peel. It's refreshing with a citrus edge. The taste is decent as well. It has a dry wheat malt flavor that's light and easy drinking. It's quite citrusy with just a hint of coriander. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a pretty good drinker. It's on par with Coors' Blue Moon."
"This is pretty lousy. Not very pleasant to drink at all. I won't be back."
"This is a reasonable beer to drink, but not to impress."
"mouthfeel is smooth light, very easy drinking, great for after doing something active in the hot sun."
"Drinkability is poor, as the taste is not very good."
"D- I am glad I only got a single of this. I guess it would be fine on a really hot day, but really, what's the point? The best part about this is the label"
"A new beer at Trader Joe's, I was warned that this wasn't the best beer we have over there. Boy, that was an understatement. Off smells and flavors are abound in this brew. Rather than there being a pronounced orange peel and coriander flavor, I taste hay and corn - not a good sign. The mouthfeel is almost water like with a touch of carbonation saving it just a little. The pale golden color and the nice sturdy head is really this beer's saving grace. Oh, and the cartoon lady on the label has a Detroit tramp stamp - that's awesome. Not recommended (except for the bottle)."
