Pours int a SAPP with a three finger head and a cloudy straw color. On the taste there is a nice feint bitterness right on the start that then gives way to more floral spicy fruit flavor with a touch of malty sweetness. The spices and fruit then fade away and are replaced by a broad flat bitterness that is balanced with the malt then it too fades quickly leaving a clean finish. Very refreshing and very light and crisp for a wheat beer.","mooseisloose","Oct 26, 2013"

Back to the beer. If you've had Blue Moon, you've had this. Big orange and coriander over a light body with noticeable adjuncts.

Memorable for being one of the most ""lemony fresh"" pale wheat ales I've ever had, and for a great mouthfeel.","WastingFreetime","Jan 27, 2012"

The New Belgium Sunshine Wheat is a filtered wheat beer. Light in color and fragrance, it has a very clean taste without the yeast common to unfiltered wheat beers. Given the added spices, it has a flavor that puts is somewhere between my standard Odell Easy Street and the true Belgian whitbeer, such as a Hoegaarden. Nice for a change of pace, but I in general prefer unfiltered brews during the all to short wheat beer season.","iSip","Jun 10, 2011"

3.15,-8.7,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Pours a perfect length two finger head that makes it right to the top of my wheat glass. The head is completely white with about half small bubbles and half big bubbles. Kinda creamy looking, but it's not hanging around very long. Pretty good lacing though. The body is see through in some areas and cloudy in other, but overall it's a lot lighter in color than it should be, and it's not as cloudy as it should be. The body is yellow, pretty much looks like a lager other than some of the cloudiness, way too much carbonation here as well. The only reason this beer is getting a 3.5 is because of the good lacing, and that's really a generous rating, it looks like a lager. The smell on this beer is good though, it sort of smell like a Hoegaarden, the spices are the most prominent thing, not too much fruit, but that's sometimes a good thing. I am picking up some small scents of fruit and a tiny bit of light malt, but for the most part it's all spice. The smell isn't very potent, and there isn't really much too it, but it's for sure better than the appearance. This beer really isn't impressing me at all, in any areas. The taste is no different, I get a little spice, and maybe some lemon or possibly orange on the taste, but that's about it. Some maltyness is present and a touch of wheat, but it's way too small for this to be considered a quality beer. Frankly it's just a little watery. Maybe this beer deserves better than a 3 on taste, but I think it's closer to a 3 than it is to a 3.5, what it comes down to is that the appearance was close to a 3 but the lacing bailed it out, and the smell was slightly better than the look, so that bailed it out, I can't keep cutting this beer more breaks, this maybe could get a 3.5, but it really doesn't deserve it, nothing about this is above average. Mouthfeel is the same story, it's close to being a 3.5, but not quite there, there is only a tiny tiny bit of wheat, and thats not going to fly in a wheat beer, especially for the mouthfeel. Other than the wheat it's just way too light, without any wheat it's obviously going to be light - and it is. I know wheat beers are a lighter style, but there really isn't much to this at all. Carbonation is better than I thought it would be, but overall, not a great mouthfeel. Drinkability is good, but only because it's so damn light, it's doesn't taste amazing or anything. Overall the best way to describe this beer is being one tiny step above a Blue Moon seasonal. The Blue Moon spring ale, and summer ale were pretty crappy, and this is just a little bit better than those two. The Blue Moon standard, the belgian white, was better than this beer. So overall, I can drink it, I won't mind drinking it, it's a spiced beer, so even though it's bad it's not terrible. But it's just not doing it for me in really any areas. Average beer.","MaltsOfGlory","Apr 16, 2011"
3.58,3.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the wheat with some coriander and some orange peel notes.

The body was watery, medium/light and the carbonation average. Not unpleasant, just forgettable.

Exhale and you taste what it tastes like to chew on a straw of wheat. The mouthfeel is vibrant and carbonated. This isn't a complex beer. There is not much thinking.

Somehow this feels very viscous in the mouth. Amazingly full body and mouthfeel for an american wheat, yet is crisp and refreshing at the same time. Nice light wheaty finish.

Boulevard Wheat blows it away. This is just a plain beer. Not bad, but not something I would seek out regularly.

Instead this was basically a purified and cleaned up macro. There was a lemony twang in the finish with a hint of spiciness, and the mouthfeel was a few notches above most macros.

Its better than your average american wheat beer, but it doesn't approach other belgian style offerings such as Blanche de Brooklyn or Whirlwind Wit from Victory. Its a bit of a paradox... a filtered spiced wheat beer. Pours almost lager-golden with a nice fluffy head. Spices and orange are evident in the smell. At first taste, the beer is a bit too carbonated in my opinion. Not nearly as smooth as it could be. Spicing is evident, but not as pronounced as I'd expect from a NB brew.

There wasn't a whole lot to the taste in this beer. It tasted like a watered down wheat. There was a very subtle hint of spices that were so weak I couldn't place them. I was hoping to find some complex yeast flavors, but found none. The bottle says it was brewed in Belgian wheat tradition, but how can that be if they don't bother with the secondary fermentation. All in all this seems sort of like the diet coke of wheat beers.

A little bubble gum is noticeable too. As for the flavor, it's very tasty, more full-flavored than many other Belgian wits. The wheat/graininess and coriander again play a large role, but further complexities exist here, such as orange peel and small, but definitely noticeable, hop bitterness.

3.52,2,3,3.5,4,3,3,"Pours a clear golden color with a small head that dissipates very rapidly.  The smell is that of an earthy burnt wheat.  Very bubbly and looks very thin.  Has a coriander spice that is very apparent followed by a mild wheat taste with some hops that hit in the middle and taper to the end.  Very interesting brew.  It is light bodied and drinkability doesn't really go as well as the flavor.  Cheers!","BeerAngel","Jul 12, 2002"
4.17,20.9,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Yet another masterpiece by New Belgium. This beers appearance is true to the name. It has a distinct citrus smell to it, mostly orange and lemon. The taste much like the smell is distinctly citrusy with a lighter wheat taste. Personally, I think I would have enjoyed a bit more of a wheat taste to it. It has a only decent mouthfeel to it, but the drinkability is great. This would be a perfect beer for a sweltering hot summer day.","tang214","Jun 01, 2002"

4.13,19.7,2.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Good for a wheat beer.  Not really a Belgian Wheat as it is portrayed.  It's not even close to the quality of a Celis White (in the  Belgian wheat class).  Appearance was the worst part.  Expecting a Belgian Wheat, but got a Kristall Weizen appearance.  Everything else about it was good.","pbnagel","May 01, 2002"
4,15.9,4,4,4,4,4,"A good, refreshing, and rather tasty beer. Clean, clear yellow-gold in appearance, poured with a foamy white head. Aromas of spice (coriander) and sweet orange peel. Taste is rather light, with a touch of spice and orange. Definitely a nice beer to have on a hot summer day.","mophie","Apr 28, 2002"
4.1,18.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pae gold color, large white head when poured, quickly fades to a thin layer with lots of lace.  Well carbonated, a constant stream of fine bubbles rises to the surface.  Pleasing fresh bread aroma with citrus fruits and coriander.  Crisp, tart taste with citrus, wheat, hops, and lots of carbonation, slightly sweet finish with no aftertaste.  Wonderfully refreshing, easy to drink, a perfect summer beer.","Pegasus","Beers"
3.7,7.2,4,4,3.5,3,4,"Crystal clear light golden color. Copious bubbles help support the fluffy white head. The soft citrus and spice notes in the aroma from the orange peel and coriander are quite pleasant.  Crisp, almost prickly mouthfeel from the high carbonation and lightly bodied. The citric contributions from the curacao, citrusy hop flavors and wheat tartness combine into a light lemon zest flavor.  Tastes like there's already a lemon in here.  (but not like those lemon alcopops)  Finishes slightly sweet and clean.  Sunshine Wheat's subtle flavors from the spices place it above the norm for the typically bland style.","marc77","0"
