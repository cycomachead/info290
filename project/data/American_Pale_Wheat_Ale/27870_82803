3.98,5.6,4,4,4,3.75,4,"O.  A decent beer that might be a little on the heavy side to be sessionable even tho the abv states otherwise.  But doable.  The orange taste kinda reminds me of tang.  Looks nice.  Smells ok.  Above average beer but nothing to search for.","IPAGeorge","Nov 29, 2014"
3.1,-17.8,3.5,3.5,2.75,3.5,3,"Sounds like my experience at SummerFest listening to Rodrigo y Gabriela...  Anyway, this stuff pours a hazy orange-brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam.  The nose comprises orange rind, very mild caramel, and a twinge of pine resin.  The taste mostly brings in more of the same, though the resin mixes with the rind in a strange way, creating a strong bitterness that ruins a lot of the synergy between the cracked wheat and citrus characters.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, this beer just didn't do it for me.  The bitterness offsets any enjoyable fruitiness and overpowers any hope of balance.  It's not terrible, but I'll likely never have this stuff again.","TMoney2591","Nov 23, 2014"

Pours hazy copper with a thick fluffy white head; which later retreats into a thin cover of sudsy foam with lacing on the glass. Heavy citrus aroma from the orange zest and hops. Citrus flavor with a muted but apparent hop bitterness. Nice and full bodied especially for 5% ABV, with a dry finish. A solid summer beer, that isn't available in my area but would reach heavy summer rotation if it was.","fitzIPAtrick","Aug 05, 2014"

Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but has a much better citrus hop smell.","UCLABrewN84","Sep 18, 2013"

The smell features nice bready wheat malts paired with big orange citrus character. Notes of lemon, pine, and grapefruit interplay nicely with cereal grains and bread. Taste is very fruity up front with notes of orange zest and pine. Heavy hop bitterness starts and finishes the flavor with sturdy wheat profile in the middle. Mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated. Overall, a very refreshing hoppy wheat beer, worth a try for sure.","homebrew311","Apr 18, 2013"
