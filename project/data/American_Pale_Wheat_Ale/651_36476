Heavy horse blanket, clove, and pepper all but overwhelmed the light pear flavor. I couldn't find any hop or wheat characteristics. The mouthfeel was light and airy while at the same time stinging the tongue in a a good way. I liked this well enough overall, but I'm glad I split this one.","DIM","Nov 30, 2014"

This beer has the characteristics of a brett fermented beer and it has developed nicely at approximately 9 mo to 1 yr of age. It has a bright yeasty fruitiness (apple and white grape with a touch of citrus) with some white pepper and a touch of tartness. There is a barnyard funkiness that keeps things interesting. There is a bit of sweetness and alcohol presence that moderates some of the refreshing aspects. Pleasantly effervescent. Overall, an enjoyable and nicely executed beer with brett yeast that develops with a little bit of age.","brianmandell","Jun 24, 2014"

Using French and American Malts, US Hops but with the kicker being Belgian, English and wild Yeast. This is ever so appearant when poured into a glass. Inches of foam appear unlike any American beer I have had. It paralells Duvel or a Belgian Quad with the amount of foam that lingers after the pour. Way more foam than actual liquid; which is something I happen to admire in a beer. The liquid hangs there as hazy unfiltered golden color. Herbal and fruit but definite unfiltered wheat characteristics.","Ryanm1","Mar 05, 2014"

There's also a lot of lacing. The brew smells like bready/wheat malt, lemon peel, floral hops, apples, and some grassiness. It tastes like bready/wheat malt, lemon peel, apricots, grass/hay and some light clove and peppery spice. I like the tartness in this brew, I didn't really expect that so it was a nice surprise. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and is well carbonated. I think this is good , I'd certainly like to try White Gold again in the future. $9.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Dec 26, 2013"

It had a bouquet that filled the nose. Traditional Belgian nose. Yeasty, barnyard, horse blanket, musty, pepper, and ripe fruit. Apples and white grapes with a touch of lemon, & caramel malt. What was missing, if you want to think that it was missing, was bubblegum and banana. No alcohol on the palate either. This drank well. it was dry, crisp and the ripe fruit washed over the palate juicy and a little tart. It drank like dry white wine. Earthy and bright. The malt stood up in the glass and was not weak. The beer had a fine balance. Prickly carbonation so it wasn’t soft but the mouthfeel was pretty good. It’s traditional Belgian. Refreshing and lively.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

Aromas of big grape, lemon, apricot, earth, tart apple, herbal, wheat, bread, hay, and funk. Some pretty nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of grape, lemon, apricot, apple, herbal, coriander, earth, funk, grass, and hay. Lingering notes of grape, lemon, apricot, grass, hay, and herbal on the finish for a while. A lot of malty flavors with good complexity; and no cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed at all on the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial wheat ale.

The smell of the beer had lots of wild yeast sour notes on the nose. I wasn't able to even get much besides that from the beer. The taste of it was also quite sour and really killed off any of the soft wheat flavors that might have been in there before the wild yeast was tossed in. The mouthfeel was a little like champagne, very bubbly and fizzed up inside the mouth. Overall this beer wasn't all that impressive to me. Had I read the label more or something I may not have even bought it.","Knapp85","Jan 03, 2012"

Yes, I smell wheat, and I spy esters and phenols, but what blows me away is how much this reminds me of pineapple upside-down cake. To me, nose is straight pineapple upside-down cake sprinkled with powdered sugar and topped with preserved lemons. If pineapple upside-down cake could drink dry with a hint of wet rock minerality, a touch of lemony goodness, and a hint of earthy funk, then this is what it would taste like. Medium body that translates light and fluffy with near perfect carbonation that leaves a pleasant prickly sensation and dry dry finish. Awesome.","timtim","Dec 06, 2011"

The amount of horse-stall funk in the bottle may turn away some wheat fans, but it's not overpowering. After all, who doesn't like a little manure in his beer? Nice color, light aroma and light body; easy to drink and has a sharp bite with a bubbly edge. Despite the high (for a wheat beer) ABV, this doesn't generate much heat or wobble.

Imagine a gold imperial stout in appearance. The aromas are earthy, grassy, lemon, and feature a tart yeasty aspect which is quite interesting. The flavors took me by surprise. It's moderately tart and you can pick up the different yeasts. It's very grassy and again features a lemon like tartness. It drinks kind of dry and is full in body. The viscosity makes this wheat a little harder to get through than most. Drinking a glass makes you feel like you just consumed a loaf of bread. It's definitely an interesting beer and I'm glad it had so much complexity for the style. I'd recommend trying this one, but probably sharing it with a friend.","aasher","Jun 20, 2011"

Not overpoweringly tart, but extremely pleasant with the contrast of a wheat beer with the belgian influence. moutfeel is highly carbonated and the melding of the flavors work well together. Extremely refreshing and effervescent. People often ask about good intros to sours, and even though this is not identified as such, would certainly be a good one to cut your teeth on.

3.82,-2.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5," The feel which is astringent at times leads to the tangy acidic citrus combination of bretty funk and American hop accents. The fruity yeast is countered by an almost lime-like character from the bitter hops with mild pineapple/grapefruit flavors and mellow lemon tinge w/ yeast complexity present but the hops have mild grassy flavors that are somewhat fighting for the spotlight and there is a rind like flavor w/ funky dry yeastiness in the finish. The malt which is obivously doing its part for the beer is not over the top bitter, but it doesn't really contribute much to the flavor either. Overall I find this beer to be interesting and has nice brett and hop flavors, but the combination of yeasts and hops are leaving an unbalanced experience and the only real detracting thing is the alcohol becomes noticeable as you continue to drink.","Slatetank","May 11, 2011"
4.15,6.1,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall this is a one hell of a good American Pale Wheat. The use of the belgium yeasts with the carbonation and the citrus and sour flavors make this the perfect summer drink. Good job Ithaca.","UMNbeerhunter","May 10, 2011"

Its a nice solid brew that has a flavor that have to say I have never had. I would have to say that this brew should be a standard for the style. The brew isn't too overpowering either, so it could be easily consumed by anyone that enjoys the style. Ithaca rocked the house with this brew.

The nose comprises wheat, orange zest, tart lemon zest, coriander, and black pepper. The taste holds notes of blood orange peel, black pepper, coriander, lightly tart mandarin oranges, wheat, and grass. Things don't quite meld together as well as one would hope. The body straddles the border between heavy light and light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish.

To quote the label again though, the Excelsior! Series defies ""existing style guidelines.""

The trappist yeast lends a distinctly Belgian sweetness to the flavor and the wild yeasts provide a layer of mustiness, though not outright funk. On top of that there is a strong citric sweetness like an APA. Appearance is a cloudy, straw golden yellow with a retentive bubbly white head with minimal lacing. Body is thick and creamy smooth, with mild carbonation that leaves a sloppy wet and musty finish. Aroma is dominated by the earthy and musty notes much more so than the flavor is with little presence of the yeast or fruitiness. Extremely drinkable and refreshing, but kind of sloppy and not very well balanced. Now to find a fresh bottle...","yourefragile","Jul 29, 2010"

Hints of apple, pear, grape and banana along with some zesty peppery spice and coriander. Very complex and flavorful with a long dry finish that leave e craving another sip.

At 8.0%, I'm still able to type after finishing off the bottle (always a plus), though it is somewhat hefty.

The depth of the yeast and hops is really bold, the light wheat malt adds just the right balance. This is one of my favorite yeast flavor's without being from an Abbey. The American, English and wild yeast adds up to IMPRESSIVE. A crisp, zippy feel and slightly dry. you can taste the wild variety in the finish most. Heat is well hidden but effective.

3.62,-7.4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This was an interesting brew for sure. It had some dry white wine-like characteristics it seemed to me, given the very low level of sweetness and the higher level of bitterness. Different for sure, and worth a try.","number1bum","Dec 18, 2007"

4.32,10.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured into a large tulip glass a hazed lighter gold with a hint or orange a tight fluffy,sticky white head atop leaving a sheet of lace as it settled slowly.The Belgo-American influences in this brew really show thru in the nose,a Belgian yeasty slightly smokey and tropical fruity notes really show thru upfront and then a real noticable floral and sharp American hop profile comes thru and really stands out very nice with equal billing to both.Wow complex to the hilt its sharp and spicey at one point and soft and fruity next,one thing is for sure the hops ring thru in a nice lingering finish.The Belgian yeast component upfront with its slight smokiness and spice just overpower or even come close to that everything just melds nicely,very well done.With more of the Excelsior brews coming in soo according to the rep at my local Consumers I will jump to get them for sure I am really looking forward to the Old Habit.","oberon","Jun 11, 2007"
4.12,5.4,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"D- The taste and smell of this beer are fantastic and something I would love to try again. If I can only muster up the beer budget to make it down to IBC for another bottle.","zdk9","Jun 10, 2007"

3.58,-8.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"A tad undrinable thanks to the alcohol. This beer should be due for some aging in my opinion to mellow out the bite to it. A touch out of balance thanks to the alcohol.","MuddyFeet","May 28, 2007"
4.18,6.9,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Has some aspects of a farmhouse saison, an abbey ale, and an american wheat rolled into one fantastic combination. My review does little justice to the depth of this brew, I highly recommend it.","shirfan","May 14, 2007"
4.12,5.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a light pale and wheat malt scent along with a fruity zest and slight coriander aroma. The taste is good. It has a dry earthy flavor that goes down easy and finishes fruity with a wheat malt edge. It's crisp and refreshing; a nice spring brew. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an interesting brew and a welcome change from the regular lineup. Keep up the good work.","WesWes","May 12, 2007"
4.08,4.3,4,3.5,4,4,5,"So here goes! Pours a murky straw color with a white fluffy head that dies down to almost nothing soon after pour. Lacing is somewhat spotty, here and there on the glass. Smell is that of mild banana with a hint of lemon/lime peels. I also detected a bit of honey that tickles the nose once and a while. Taste is very much the same as the odor, but the banana flavor is hardly present. More of a hoppy citrus flavor than a wheaty malt taste. I think the ""Strong Pale"" shines more in the flavor of the brew while the ""Wheat Ale"" is more powerful in the smell. Mouthfeel is quite dry, but not overly dry. Carbonation is just about nothing to the eye, but is very present on the tougne. Very clean going down. The balance in this brew is just about perfect. I love the drinkability of this brew. Perfect for a warm summer day with the grill cookin'. Pick this one up for sure, as well as the IPAbbey when and if you can make it to the Ithaca area. Good work once again Chief and the Ithaca Beer Co. Crew!","BeerTruth","Apr 22, 2007"
