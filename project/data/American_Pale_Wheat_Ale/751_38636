This beer pours with enough head to remind you it's had its Wheaties. The color is a beautiful gold and the nose is full of wheat goodness. The taste is bright, full of citrus and fresh baked bread. Tasting Trout Slayer is like finding a big Cutty in six inches of water - a very pleasant surprise!","Bunman3","Jan 02, 2015"

It pours crystal clear pale gold and the thick fluffy head confirms the presence of wheat, along with the rich texture. Grainy malt on the palate carries hoppy spice into the finish. Medium carbonation and body. Easy to drink.","pat61","Nov 04, 2014"

Pours hazy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, pepper, orange zest, wheat, clove, bread, floral, grass, herbal, and light banana. Very nice aromas with good strength and balance of malt and hop notes. Taste of lemon, pear, pepper, orange peel, wheat, clove, floral, grass, bread, herbal, and light banana. Lingering notes of citrus, light fruit, pepper, wheat, clove, floral, grass, herbal, and light banana on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance of citrus, malt, and spicy hop flavors; with a good amount of robustness for 5%; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice pale what ale! Very nice balance of citrus, malt, and hop flavors; and extremely smooth to drink with plenty of flavor. Really enjoyed this one.","superspak","Apr 02, 2013"

3.74,3.9,3,4,4,3,3.5,"The floral hop nature shows through somewhat better in the taste than in the nose, otherwise most of the flavor is what you see in the nose.... Sweet sharp wheat grains balanced well with noble-style floral and earth presence. Kept simple, but done relatively well. I almost forgot to mention, that the pale wheat bill on this one seems slightly heartier than your typical witbier as well. Like it was just a wee bit higher gravity than the statistically average Witbier, if you know what I mean. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium, well carbonated and crisp. I certainly appreciate the slightly bolder than typical flavors that come from this one!","WastingFreetime","Aug 24, 2011"

The taste is moderately carbonated and has a strong hops presence. There is a slight wheat note to the finish of the brew with a little banana in the after taste.

The taste is mostly a concoction of floral and light earthy hops, though some rather light caramel tries vainly to make itself heard over the hoppy din. The body is fairly light, with a light carbonation and a semi-watery feel.

Clear and golden, thick creamy head with great retention and lacing. Smell had a trace of hops but a little yeast and straw, somewhat like a pale wheat. Taste was very bland. Honestly it almost tasted like breadier macro brew. I really didnt notice anything special, some malt and that was better than a macro, but nothing much else really stood out.

Not much smell to it; vaguely citrus. As far as pale ale goes, it's less hop-bitter than most. The best comparison I can come up with is to Sam Adams, which isn't a pale ale at all, but tastes very similar. This one has a sweet and malty aftertaste that Sam Adams doesn't have - a little too sweet and cloying for my tastes, which cut the mouthfeel, drinkability, and taste scores. Given that it's a wheat pale ale, and I don't like wheat beers or pale ales (the label just says "ale"), the score it got is pretty darn solid. For those who like the style, I would expect a more positive response.","MadTown1000","Jul 24, 2008"

Pours a clear golden with a two-finger white head which fades quickly at first and ends up a leaving a nice fluffy small cloud on top. Lacing is spotty all around. Smells of coriander and citrus. Could easily be mistaken for a whitbeir if not for the color, and could be easily mistaken for a lager if not for the head, and could easily be mistaken for a straight on hefeweizen if not for the lack of haziness. Is this beer confused or is that why they call it a Kristalweizen? Ahh. Very clever. Tastes of malts, grass, orange peel and a bit of lemon in the background. Very smooth and drinkable and not bland as might be expected, with an undercurrent of sweetness that makes it a bit more satisfying. The light-bodied and crisp mouthfeel make for a good little beer you might get to if you're looking for a good summer sessioner. Seeing that it's 66 degrees outside today and the middle of December, that's close enough for me. I commend Big Sky for trying something different here and not just going for a straight up wheat beer, as most of the other brewers in their class do.","stephens101","Dec 21, 2007"

Warm bready malt tones and some citric hop aromas as well. Especially lemon. The base of this beer is that warm biscuity/bready maltiness. The hops play on top of that, with Palisade and Glacier being in the mix. Lemony hoppiness. Slightly pungent lemon rind tones. It fits though. This has a crisp feel to it and goes down pretty easy.

It's almost what you might consider a "light pale ale" with a malty taste and bitter aftertaste that you may consider fruity or citrusy depending on the palate. The mouthfeel has a medium body and an effervesence that is rooted in hot summer days. A little hoppier than a traditional blonde ale, this beer has a drinkablility that never gets tired.
