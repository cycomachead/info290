The nose carries elegant floral tones blossoming into a fruit salad arrangement of tangerine, apricot and peach while also boasting a sweet candied bubblegum. Seductive wheat sweetness and lemon citrus brightly tease the palate while tamed by assertive hop bitterness. Grass and rose petal sensations delicately join lemon and mango juiciness throughout the taste. The mildly lasting finish is semi-dry and allows the wheat notes to shine; refreshing and delicate enough on the palate to make this a perfect warm weather beverage.","_YellowBird_","Mar 04, 2014"

No, actually I employed an inverted Glug, resulting in a finger-and-a-half of rocky, bone-white head with decent retention. Color was a cloudy orangish-yellow. Nose had a lemon/grapefruit-citrusiness to it. Nose was more hoppy than I expected and I CANfess to unfamiliarity with that particular strain mentioned in the Notes. Mouthfeel was bubbly and effervescent and I felt as though I were picking up where I left off with that Radler earlier. The taste was odd, peppery, citrusy, quite unexpected. The finish was quite dry with the pepper and citrus flavors combining nicely. It did not seem to fit the style and I am not a style maven by any stretch, but it caught me off guard. It might be nice on a hot, humid summer's day, but I was left unimpressed.","woodychandler","Aug 15, 2013"

The nose comprises grapefruit rind, leek, light cantaloupe, light pineapple, and a pinch of coriander. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some orange rind, some overly-ripe mandarin orange, and a bit of wild rice. Unfortunately, a stiff bitterness pervades the finish, malingering for a tad too long, sorta ruining things a bit at the end. It's not enough to raze things completely, thankfully. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly grainy feel. Overall, a solid, fruity wheat beer, but it's nothing overtly special.","TMoney2591","Jun 24, 2012"

4.12,1.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pungent citrusy aroma at first, becoming grainy and wheaty over time. A certain sweet earthiness and grassy character from the Mouteka hop variety. First sips are very reminiscent of Tasty Waves and Daisy Cutter, albeit with wheat and a different hop variety. Smooth and extremely drinkable, earthy grassy bitterness lingers alongside bitter grapefruit zest. The NZ hops do lend some distinct character, and overall its pretty tasty, especially for the style. Definitely feeling the summer vibes with this one...","emerge077","Jun 17, 2012"
4.22,4.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"D - An American Pale Wheat Ale that does not suck. Really easy to drink and perfect for the hot summer weather. Also appropriately priced at $5.99/22oz. Watch out Gumballhead!","MasterSki","Jun 17, 2012"

4.12,1.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"O: A very drinkable American Wheat Ale. Aggressively hopped, but with with a lot more wheat character than is typically seen in this category. Wouldn't mind seeing this one make its way to cans one day.","Florida9","Jun 15, 2012"

This brew is classic Half Acre and kicks some serious IBU's! A great wheat ale that I am gonna enjoy all summer long.","vespahulb","Jun 13, 2012"
4.25,4.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"O: I'm not a fan of wheat beers but this one is pretty well done. Highly hopped for the style with citrus and pine notes.","WankelEngine","Jun 13, 2012"
4.3,6.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"O- A pretty damn tasty beer, it's very hop forward and probably tastes more like an IPA than a Hefeweizen, but is still an awesome beer, if this was available in four-packs it might be the first wheat beer I would actually pick up regularly.","WillCarrera","Beers"
