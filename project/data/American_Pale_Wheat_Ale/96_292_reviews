"Hocus Pocus isn't really outstanding, but it's not offensive either. It's worth drinking."

"10/24/12 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Applied orange slice as instructed. Couldn't salvage the flavor. Not sure if it's too tart or bitter or both. All I know it's not as crisp as my ideal summer refresher must be, orange or no."

"This was the fourth beer I tasted grom the Magic hat summer variety pack. A golden brown appearance that was slightly cloudy. Very little foam after the pour. Nothing to report regarding the smell. Its a very drinkable not bitter at all. Great beer for the summer time."

"Hocus Pocus brewed by Magic Hat Brewing Company with an ABV of 4.5. This is an wheat ale but it is filtered wheat ale. This is not not like your typical wheat brews on the market, that are unfiltered. Hocus Pocus pours out a nice golden amber color with a white head. Nice and crystal clear. The smell is nice and clean you pick up on kiss of wheat. The taste is bold with a little bite of citrus to it. There is some citrus and grains. Nothing bad about taste. This brew has a nice balance to it, there is nothing over powering in this beer. This beer goes down nice and smooth and clean. The finish is nice and clean. Magic Hat Brewing Company did a nice job with this one. I would get this brew again. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5"

" A 3.75 overall. I fully understand why this is a PALE wheat beer. Because, to me, this has all of the traits of a witbier, but to a lesser degree. This would be a very refreshing summer brew. I will buy this brew again."

"This pours a clear, yellow straw color with a thin, beige head. The aroma is of wheat and lemon zest. The taste is a watered down lemon, wheat beer. The after taste is slightly tart and a little off-putting. The texture is thin with not much happening. Not terrible but this could be better!"

"A decent wheat beer with just a hint of lemony hops, but not much in the way of flavor beyond that. A half step above the commercial beers."

"Beer is medium to light in body, sweet overall, a little hoppy, decent finish, meh, it's an american style wheat beer. Not a repeat for me"
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours up a crystal clear very pale straw color with a nice foamy two finger head, world class retention, and world class lacing. The smell is mostly oranges. Taste is fairly one dimensional. Just a hint of oranges without a lot of hops. Mouthfeel is kind of metallic. I guess this one is okay as a session beer, but for me I think I'll pass on more of these."
""
""
""
"This is a bit disappointing. The flavors seems a bit muddled. I'm impressed that this is only 13 IBUs. The hops to me are evident throughout with a toned down, herbal, spicy note. The overall flavor is a decent wheat beer, but this isn't something that I would drink again. I'll pass."

"I usually find Magic Hat's beers fairly bland, but this one was a pleasant surprise. It pours from the bottle with a bright yellow-orange color. The aroma is a light mix of musty yet bright hop bitterness, a little lemon, and some earthy wheat. The flavor largely features a biscuity, almost tangy, light malt sweetness, but there is also a bit of dry, herbal hops to balance. Like the flavor, the texture is light but not too thin. Overall, this beer is light and drinkable, but it has a nice mild yet varied flavor profile that lifts it above ""bland"" to ""subtly pleasant."""
""
""
""
""

"Hocus Pocus pours a golden color with tons of carbonation keeping a relatively small head afloat. The aroma is of lemon, sweet malts, grains, and wheat. The taste is simple and thirst-quenching, with lemon over a refreshing backbone of wheat and grains. Not as sweet as the nose suggests. The mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated, and the drinkability is great. Overall, this is a tasty American Wheat that won't set the world on fire, but is still a great drink."

"A light, drinkable summer wheat beer. It doesn't have any artificial or offensive flavors and I would have to say it is pretty refreshing. Good enough for what you pay."
""
"Overall - It's not my typical style of beer that I prefer. I would definitely choose my go-to Hefeweizens over it. In fact, I would probably say that it tastes like a mix between a good HW and a BMC beer, but without the wonderful Banana aromas I most desire from my favorite Hefeweizens. I don't see myself buying singles of this beer in the future. The variety pack, however, has many others I would choose of this beer. It rates ""average"" to my taste..."

"When poured it has a goldish color body with a very small fizzy head that fizzes away quickly. The smell is light citrus and wheat. The taste is crisp of a light citrus and wheat and some yeast flavor comes through, thats it not too much going on here. The mouth feel is crisp and nicely carbonated. Overall this is defently a summer time beer and a easy drinker."
""
""
"Overall: This beer is better than I was honestly expecting it to be. Magic Hat doesn't have the best track record with me, but this, a pretty hoppy summer wheat beer, isn't so bad. I don't understand why it's in their fall variety pack, but they have always been a little bit odd."

"Pours a golden yellow with a frothy white head that sticks around. The smell is mostly hoppy with some hints of yeast and sweet citrus notes. The taste is hoppy and crisp with a subtle sweetness kicking in at the end with a bit of an earthy/grassy flavor. The mouthfeel is light and smooth with a nice flavor balance. Overall a good beer, refreshing with lots of flavor."
"O: Why this got voted as the winner for their usual 'which beer will be the 4th in the pack' for their Fall mix-pack is beyond me.... Definitely a summery beer (hell, it's even listed as a summer seasonal on here; then again that's not true), and people probably didn't realize it. The name sounds more like a fall beer for sure. But it's not [/end rant]. Regardless of the season now, this is a good sessionable beer that has enough flavor to beat out the macro crew. Pick it up in the 12-pack mixer. Enjoy it. Agree with my rant. ;-)"

"Eh, so-so beer."

"O: This beer is very easy to drink and makes for a good lawnmower beer."

"The beer pours a very pale yellow, like a chardonnay with a hell of a lot of carbonation bubbles racing up to feed the finger-width head of fluffy white bubbles. Lacing is dry and sheet-like on the glass. The beer smells wet, fresh, and sweet with some light hop-spice and citrus accentuations and a ghost of biscuity malt behind it. The beer tastes bitterly wheat-like with some nice citrus accentuations. The flavor reminds me a lot of A Little Sumpin Sumpin Ale by Laguinitas, only not as tasty… There are some nice Cascade hop notes in the taste and an astringent bitter on the tongue. The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, like a nice summer ale with a little bit of an acidic bite from the carbonation. The mouth is left wet with saliva and a slight bitter burn on the tongue. Overall this is a nice example of the style, though I can’t say it is my favorite. The bitter is a little too present without a hop character to tenderize it out on the tongue. This beer is mediocre but worth a try."

"Pours a clear, golden/straw color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of slight wheat, slight yeast, strong pale malt, hint of hop, slight earthy malt, and a hint of citrus. Fits the style of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of wheat, slight sweet malt, pale malt, and a hint of hops. Overall, average body aroma, but good feel and blend."
"They said they haven't brewed this since 2008. I think it may have been prematurely resurrected."

"O/D-A bland one. Has its high points but it is far from memorable. Just another brew by Magic Hat."

"Overall, this is a solid summer ale, providing just the right amount of light, airy fare that you crave on hot days, but not sacrificing flavor or quality in the process. If you're a fan of Corona, I recommend this as a step up--and you won't even have to add the wedge of lime."
"I’ve not been a big fan of wheat beers, but this one is mild enough I found it easy to drink. It started with a couple of fingers of head, but lost the head fairly quickly. A light gold color and fairly clear for a wheat, although there is a bit of cloudiness to it. Mild aroma of wheat with a bit of hops citrus. The mouthfeel is pretty light but the taste was better than the aroma led me to believe it would be. Aftertaste is bitterness.This will never be confused with the bigger heavier beers, but when you’re in the mood for something other than a heavy beer, this works. This might also make a nice gateway beer into the world of craft beers."
"Got some of this before it was put to death by the brewery. The beer poured as a clean clear yellow colored beer. The head was a little fizzy and white. The smell of the beer had some nice suble wheat aromas with a light honey sweetness to it. The taste of the beer was light and refreshing. Just a touch of sweet honey with some malted wheat. The hops were kept to a minimal amount in this one. The mouthfeel was perfect for a summer brew. Overall I wasn't overly sad to see this beer retired but I know several people who were pretty pissed about it."
"Overall not bad. I was really not the biggest fan of this one, but to be honest I have had much worse. This was definitly a quality beer and something that I would probably not buy again, but would not snub my nose at it either."
"Poured a really light yellow color with a bit of a white head and some clearly visible carbonation. The nose is some light citrus along with quite a bit of grain. The taste is grainy and has some light lemon notes. Light and crisp, this was a pretty good summer brew."
"Light, somewhat refreshing, but doesn't stand out in comparison to other summer wheat beers."
"Poured from bottle to pint glass a hazy straw color with a frothy white head that diminished to minimal lacing. It has a mild lemony sweet honey aroma. The taste is a mild wheat flavor with hints of lemon. Feel is clean and very drinkable this is a respectable summer session beer."
"I had this on tap while at the brewery for tour. The aroma was light but you could notice certain scents. Bitter citrus like grapefruit and grainy malt aromas. Nice transparent yellow color with good head and lace. It has a balanced sweet and sour taste. Equal parts fruit and malt like flavor. The body is thin and easy to drink."
"it is a great summer drink. alot better than i remember primarily because hops are MUCH more present in the beer. beer isnt big in the flavor department but it is very well balanced. a little disappointed that it wont be around anymore."
"This would be a great beer to drink out at the beach on a warm day, but unfortunately I don't think it's coming back again for a while."
"(rated May 29, 2008)"
"Aroma has Very pleasingly subtle, spicy, lemony twang. Flavor pretty much carries this theme through...palate-tingling, lemony/sour edge, rereshing, fresh. A very good example of an American wheat beer. The best Magic Hat offering I hae tried to date--I was not hopeful after the awful Lucky Kat, this beer is thankfully much better."
"The taste is really crisp with a mild sweetness and almost tart like character. The body is light with plenty of carbonation to keep this refreshing. This makes for a great thirst quenching quaffable beer, whether its summer or early October (summer beers are on special!)"
"Drinkability: Not going to be a summer go-to beer for me. This one just doesn't have too much going on - it's crisp and tart and refreshing, but it's pretty boring, in my opinion. Not recommended."
"I had this beer throughout the summer and it never disappointed me. It's easily drinkable, light bodied, highly carbonated, and has a great lemon zest of flavor. It's also low ABV which helps because you can easily knock back a bunch of these.. a very easy drinker."
"Good session beer for the summertime. Enough flavor to make it worthwhile and light enough for mass quantities. May not be the best wheat beer in the world, but still an enjoyable drink."
"Off tap at their South Burlington brewery this beer was a slightly hazy gold. White head foamed up quickly and then receded again quickly to a thin ring that remained for the rest of the tasting. The nose was mostly lemon peel and grapefruit with some light hops underneath. The tastes were similar but well rounded, dry citrus up front followed by pale malt and green apples. Medium to light body and medium to high carbonation. Quite sessionable, genuinely refreshing and a good summer beer."
"Drinkability: Light and refreshing good summer beer. may not stand out amoung others in the summer series but still a solid, enjoyable beer."
"Had this at a BBQ the other night. I drank it straight from the bottle so I can't comment on the appearance. I'm a sucker for the ""seasonal"" ales so I went straight for this when I saw it in the cooler. The smell was refreshing and the taste was much of the same. A little wheat with something sweet that I couldn't place. It is a real smooth beer and if it wasn't for the fact that I had to drive home I could see myself enjoying the entire 6-pack on a lazy summer evening. I might go and try to procure some of this before the fall beers start pushing these off the shelves."
"Overall - its ok but not great."
"D: Pretty high because this is so light on flavor and easy drinking. This is decent, but I have had much better."
"i can't recommend this beer at all."
"Has a cloudy golden look. Poured a decent head and left a bit of lace. Has a sweet type of apricot, lemon taste to it, but not nearly as sweet as the #9. Pretty smooth going down, but tasted watery at times and not a ton of flavor to it. Still it's refreshing and a pretty good beer that I'd probably get again."
"Hocus Pocus is a pleasant surprise from Magic Hat. The drink has fine, zesty carbonation that fits the refreshing flavor profile just about perfectly. Crisp and medium bodied with superb drinkability."
"The beer poured a straw yellow with a light white head. The aroma was not really all that good. Slight citrus with a vague hint of the grain. My wife commented that it smelled like a band-aid. The taste was average, at best, and kind of followed the nose but with a mix of the grain and cirtus, seemed bland. The beer may have been a bit overcarbonated and was thin. Overall, I was not impressed with the beer and seeing how this was my first with Magic Hat, I am leary of the rest of their beer, but I am sure that I will give them a chance. Maybe I just don't care for the style."
"D: Drinks well, but I don't like the taste."
"Served a crisp pale orange with a thin diminishing head that leaves decent lacing on the glass. The aroma is some weak sweet malts and fruits. The taste is sweet fruits and slight citrus. The beer is crisp and refreshing. This is a decent Summer brew, just not one I'd likely seek out again."
"GC"
"Tastes like a wheat beer! Dry, tart, finish, without the puckering aftertaste too many wheats have. Overall a decent enough brew to set in the shade & grab each pass while mowing."
"There are plenty of better wheat beers out there, give them a shot before you try this one, but I wouldn't turn one of these down."
"Poured into a hefe glass and received a light gold body with solid two-finger head that held up well to some good carbonation; when it did slowly receed left a night lace ring. A very fruity smell; not jsut citric notes like orange peel and lemon but some bananas and pears as well as some minor spicings. A good citric hop taste hit my tongue as the medium-bodied beer passed over smooth, almost slick. The beer is light on spices but they're there and the yeast/wheat sediments in there give it a somewhat creamy and sweentness. Other might disagree but I think this is a great American Wheat beer."
"Worth giving a shot."
"This one pours a very light straw color with a hint of haziness. It has a nice big white head. The flavor is nice and light making this quite the lawnmower beer. It has no aftertaste and is an extremely clean tasting beer. I'm not a big fan of this style, but it is one of the most drinkable beers for sure. Definitely a great beer for a hot summer day."
"D: This one didn't impress me. It has its strong points, but it never wows you."
"Diving into this beer, I often wondered if this were a bad Kolsch, a Blonde Ale, a high temperature lager... didn't think of an American Wheat. The beer starts with a mostly clear straw color, fair initial head formation that didn't retain as well as prefered. Aromas are part-pilsner malt, part-grain, and with a soft herbal, floral hop note that saves the aroma. Flavors have a better malt profile than the nose suggests, however the cereal grain flavors do come though as well as a coarse astringency late. Soft wheat malt flavors are found but only after searching for them. But the wheat does little to soften the textures or give any rich breadiness, sweetness, or body. A subtle fruitiness comes though as pears and apples. Finishes with a linger of the herbal hops and cereal grains."
"D: Easy to drink and low ABV. Not very interesting, though. Mayber Oberon has ruined me."
"M/D: Light bodied, carbonation isn't too prickly, a little foamy. Decent drinkability. Nothing great, but entirely drinkable."
"This was a pretty average beer. I wouldn't mind drinking a few of these, but nothing really stood out."
"This is perfect for summertime. I don't usually gravitate towards this style of lawnmower beer but I definitely appreciate the craft and enjoyed this quite a bit."
"Don't drink and reivew."
"This is one of those beers that's a tough one to review. It's in a style that's not particularly outstanding (although that is certainly drinkable), and it basically does what it's supposed to there. It looks like a wheat ale, smells mildly like a wheat ale. It tastes like it should. The only thing moderately unique here is that it's very citrusy, moreso than most APWAs (although we're not talking Gumbalhead zest by any means). Feel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. I prefer it to Magic Hat's other widely available APWA, Circus Boy. Overall, it's fine for the summer, but (as with a lot of beers in this style) nothing I'd seek out."
"hints of citrus and nice clean finish, this poured golden with a good amount of head that quickley faded to a sloght ring arount the top. tir first sent was one of wheat and hop, the tast was super, i will have to get a few more of thees for the 4th of july"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Light bodied in the mouth with just enough carbonation to make it feel so. This beer is crisp and slightly drying in the finish. Very nice feel overall. as mentioned earlier I've had better, this won't be one that i""ll actively seek out in the future, it won't be one that I""d be caught in making a decision with -Hocus Pocus or Beer X- just average, nothing special, but worth a try I guess."
"D: Very drinkable, espeacially in the summer. Very refreshing...and would be great after a hard days work in the hard."
"D: One of the better summer ales -- far better than Samuel Adams' version. If Magic Hat would let go of the fruit-herbal-spiced vibe, they have a real knack for brewing some nice beers (see Odd Notion Summer '08, Circus Boy)."
"Taste is more citrus (lemon, tangerine, orange) and wheat, almost a bit acidic. A bit of bitter hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is crisp with a decent amount of carbonation, and it feels pretty light bodied. The down side is the slight stickiness it leaves. Not quite the clean finish that I want in a summer beer. Drinkability is also decent. It is almost a good summer session beer. If they tone down the citrus and the stickiness a tad then it'd be much better."
"All in all a good summer ale; not the best I've had (and not terribly distinct) but a good call when you want something both flavorful and refreshing."
"I'd likely never buy this in it's own 6 or 12-pack, but it's a welcome addition to the summer variety pack. I only wish I could have tried the ginger-lemon version of this beer before it was discontinued, just to see if it made the brew more interesting."
"D: Definitely a worthy Wheat Ale, good summertime brew. I enjoy wheats and while this is not my favorite, it was a decent selection that I would dabble with again."
" There are many other summer-style beers to choose from."
"Thin, watery, bland, and very forgettable. Had to chug an Oberon immediately afterwards to cleanse the palate."
"Drinkability: great, could do a whole sixer in a night (tastes great after a long run through the streets of Arlington)"
"A hoppy wheat beer. Some taste but rather ordinary. On-tap at the brewery. A bit of tartness,and lemon in the aroma. drinkable summer beer but bland. Oh and on the thinner side. Not my favorite, I wouldn't dress it up with a lemon slice.Non-offensive."
"Bottle (B-) - Slightly psychedelic green label, orginal idea, but I hate bees..."
"Worth a shot..."
" I would simply like to add that this is a beer one could stock up for nice picnic or just any gathering. No complaints. Very light,not too much lemon so it seems an ideal beer for what is intended."
"the worst offering i have had from magic hat, but still drinkable on a hot summer day.."
"D. Pretty drinkable. Not the first I'd go for but not a disappointing beer by any means."
"Pours a slightly cloudy, golden color with a white head that dissipates fairly quickly; highly carbonated. Has a sweet smell with wheat and lemon. Light, herby flavor with a dry, slightly skunky aftertaste. Carbonation cleans the palate but also leaves a very dry feeling. Lacks the flavor of most wheat beers, not craving another."
"Overall: A nice wheat beer. Has a bit more zing than some of the others in its category."
"Fairly smooth, good citrus taste with lemon taking the forefront. Not overly sweet as there is a little bit of hop action going on to lend some bitterness. Very easy to drink."
"Mouthfeel is light and carbonated - refreshing and drinkable ale."
"Taste is very mellow on the wheat side. There's a nice apricot fruit note to it as well. Smooth and oily in the glass, it is a very drinkable wheat beer."
"This beer is a clear golden color with a medium white head that dissipates steadily. Spotty lacing. Light aroma of wheat and citrus. Light-bodied and citrusy with some mild wheat and malt flavors. Clean, fruity finish with a touch of hops on the end. Clearly meant to be a lawnmower beer, but that is no excuse not to throw in a little more flavor."
"Drinkability - I am having a hard enough time forcing down just one of these."
"In my quest to try more of Magic Hat's delicious offerings, I've come across Hocus Pocus. A festive looking beer. 12 oz. bottle with a distinctive lemon and caramel malts smell. A bit sweet on the nose, and the taste follows. A bit overpowering on the caramel malts and sour lemon tanginess. Carbonated on the tongue, but nothing too special. Overall, probably would not drink more than one of these. I am a bit disappointed at Magic Hat for making such an overpowering pale wheat ale, not really in line with the category."
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy white head, some sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, slight hops, spicy, grassy, and some caramel. The taste is malty/hoppy, there are some spice's in there, good dose of grassiness, and some caramel. This is a re-freshing/smooth brew. Medium body. Drinkable, goes good on a hot day like today."
"Drinks okay for what it is. Watered down American Pale Wheats are not my bag"
"It is very refreshing on the palate. I could drink this in a single mouthful. The malts come threw along with a light yeasty fruitiness. The hops are faint but they are noticeable."
"d: three went down with easy, but the experience wasn't too enjoyable...still, quite drinkable"
"D- A drinkable wheat beer, but nothing spectacular... I have to say as more of these come to market, less of them are great."
"D - I could have 2 of these, but I think the bitterness would prove to be too much after the second. It's nice for a change of pace, but not a staple in my fridge."
"Its not great or anything but it is one of the better summer beers I have had this summer."
"Chuck full o' flavor. But something I might not get every week."
"Very light, little head. Aroma is kind of floral, maybe a hint of some herbal quality like cedar. The flavor is fairly light and crackery, just a hint of bitterness at the end, and maybe some light white wine character (not quite acidic but something like that). This is pretty light overall and its a good summer beer but not terribly exciting."
"Pours a little cloudy yellow with a white head that went away pretty quickly. It had the aroma of a lemony dryness. In the taste, well, it had a nice dry end, but no real taste at all. It kind of sticks to the top of the mouth, with somewhat of a flat beer charicteristic. It was ok, a bit malty for a wheat, and really not much flavor at all."
"Pours a four finger white head that fades quickly leaving some lace. Clear pale amber color. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Slight hoppy nose. Flavor begins with a hint of sweetness becomes balanced, fairly clean finsih, good summer ale. $1.50 for a 12oz bottle from Capital Convenience Concord, NH."
"Goes down smoothly. Through fine craftsmanship or lack of substance is debatable, but on a hot summer day this beer could actually be quite refreshing."
"Poors a hazy straw color, with quite the inital head, that goes away after a few mins. The smell is pretty sweet but plesant with some fruit. Taste is very easy going with some citrus and wheat flavors, good for a summer day. A good session brew, i would have to say better then sammy summer"
"Pours a slightly hazy yellow-gold with a one-finger frothy head. Tons of carbonation bubbles. Better head stickiness than described in other reviews. The smell was primarily tart citrus with a trace of malt. Taste was not bad but kind of pedestrian and forgettable -- some citrusy tartness up front moving to a mellow breadiness and finishing with a hoppy bitterness that was more fatigued than lively. The finish evolved back into a yeast flavor as the beer warmed. Very light-bodied and a little bit fizzy. Not the greatest offering and probably not one I'll be getting again, but not terrible."
"This beer poured a slightly hazy golden yellow color from its 12oz home. I gave the bottle a nice squish to get the rest of the goodness out. There was some slight sediment on the bottom of the bottle. Freshness date clearly marked on the label. This brew is really easy drinking and enjoyable. This one is perfect on any warm summer day just relaxing in the sun. The presentation was decent good fluffy white head that did thin out quickly. There was a slight lace left behind in the glass. Smell is light and dough like probably more from the wheat than yeast though. Hint of sweetness and an almost dull Euro lager scent. Maybe some touch of cloves and a hint of vanilla in the background. There is a certain floral scent mixed in. Light bodied brew with a smooth pale malt flavor subtle floral hint in the taste. Well balanced with the rather sweeter malt flavor followed by a slight bitterness of the hops. Good mouth feel and great drink ability. I certainly enjoy this brew during the summer months and look forward to drinking it. Overall this is a great easy drinking summertime session offering."
"Pours a clear golden with a nice head that disappears quickly. Aroma is light sweet malt, perhaps some grassy hops. Taste a bit of wheat at first but mostly malt. A light touch of hops. Not all that exciting. I was expecting this to be more of a wheat beer really so I was kind of surprised. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, fairly light mouthfeel that's about right for this beer. Quite drinkable. I could see having a good many of these at a picnic."
"Kind of a lifeless offering from Magic Hat. They have tons of different beers and they're obviously talented, you just get the idea the quality would be better if they concentrated more on each style than producing so many interesting but flawed brews."
"D- I enjoyed the flavors of this one if they could be blended better. A beer I would certainly drink again if I have the chance."
"Not horrible, but not something I would revisit. Just didn't sit right with me. For a wheat ale from this brewery, better off with Circus Boy."
"Overall: A decent intro to an American Wheat for a novice to the style. Just an average and generic flavor profile, nothing that stands out. Forgetful."
"D- This was a solid offering from Magic Hat. I would venture to have this one again. Its taste and mouthfeel make it very drinkable."
"D - good, easy drinking summer wheat beer. buy it, try it."
"D-It's crisp & refreshing, but other than that there's really nothing to keep me coming back."
"This beer has a spice-overload, there's just too much and they aren't mixing well in my book. Everything just comes off a bit meat-like if that makes any sense.The aroma is less intense and not bad with a hint of lemon, ginger, and wheat. Those flavors come together in the taste with god knows what else for a train wreck."
"Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel.Not a great first impression the beer seemed to get better with each taste. Would like to try again. Easy drinking and refreshing in the end."
"12 oz. bottle best before August 2007. Pours up a rich golden color with a two-fingered bone white head that sticks around for a while. Aromas of malted wheat, whole grain bread, with hints of mustiness, lemon zest and Hersbrucker hops. Rather tame is the taste department. Mainly watery tasting with some glimpses of pale wheat, citrus and a mildly sweet and faintly tart finish. Healthy carbonation gives it a crisp mouthfeel. Easy drinking because there's not a whole lot to it. Better than some other beers in the American pale wheat category, but certainly no show-stopper. A nice beer for the dog days of summer."
"I poured this beer from the bottle to a tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was pale and clean looking. The beer reeked I though in the smell department selling like something that had gone sour. Very yeasty smelling also. The beer had kinda of a grassy taste, yet clean with a sweet aftertaste. Still I was just not too keen on it and will not buy again."
"This beer pours a light pale color. Not much head. The aroma is very fruity with strong hints of wheat and malt. It reminds me of a hefeweizen but it's not quite that. Leaves a bready aftertaste with some resemblance to cider on the throat. Not too bad. Light and drinkable for sure."
"The beer is golden yellow with moderate carbonation and a 3/4 inch head that settles to a sticky thin film of white bubbles. The smell is that of buttery wheat, a tiny bit of hops, and a slight musty odor. It tastes like a typical wheat beer: light, crispy, mild taste, very easy to drink and unoffensive to the more avid macro drinker. Good starter beer, nothing very bold, though. Average, right across the board."
"This is a rather easy drinker but its also rather unexciting, a middle of the road beer. I'll go elsewhere for my American wheats in the future."
"Drinkability: This will be a great summer brew to enjoy."
"D - Maybe more enjoyable in the summer months, but I just couldn't get into it right now. Very thin and the flavors just weren't there. I'll try another in the summer, as I come to expect a little more from Magic Hat."
"D: This beer is extremely easy-to-drink and not filling at all because it’s so light, the only problem is the lack of flavor. It’s a beer you can drink a lot of in the same way you can drink a lot of any macro."
"small white head very little lacing clear gold color. smell is of honey taste is of honey with a little hop. clean light mouthfeel not overly carbonated and no after taste. i didn't really care for the honey taste in this beer but i'll give it another try to see if taste buds change otherwise i don't think i would buy this one again."
"As a side note, some macro lovers accidently drank one or two of mine while they werent paying attention. They enjoyed them, and their conversion to the dark side is just beginning."
"Good summer time brew."
"I'm glad I caught this beer before summertime ended completely, because it truly is a sunny brew. Bright lemon-yellow and hazy, the Hocus Pocus is only lightly carbonated. A powerful aroma of white wine and baked beans dominates the nose and imparts a refreshing flavor -- not too wet, not too dry. My only complaint is that it's a bit watery. Still, this would be a great beer to pair with a light meal -- say a goat cheese salad -- or enjoy as an evening drink while dinner is on the grill."
"Overall, a disappointment from this in general good brewery."
"Drinkability- fairly drinkable but a lack of taste and a bit of dryness keep me from wanting more. Wouldn't be bad for a hot summer day after mowing the lawn, but magic hat could do better by replacing this with batch 374, 375 or something else for next year."
"A crisp summer beer, you could drink a couple of these on a hot day, but I like a bit more flavor in mine."
"Hocus Pocus, besides being undoubtedly the best song by Focus, is a good, crisp summer brew with a twinge of lemon. How can you argue with a beer like this on a hot day? Loses some style points because it looks a bit too clear for a wheat beer."
"Medium-light body, average carbonation. Pretty well balanced. Seems pretty typical of the style, nothing really stands out. Crisp, refreshing....decent summer wheat. Could easily be a session beer."
"Overall: Next time I want something that isn't ""too"" anything, I'll reach for this. Its light, crisp, balanced, and extremely drinkable. Very nice warm weather beer."
"Comments: I liked this when looking for something cold, light & refreshing. Not overly complex or remarkable in terms of flavor, but average."
"Overall, a nice, refreshing beer that has some good flavors and depth while still being light and crisp for hot days or people that don't like big/hoppy/strong beers."
"This beer pours a clear, golden color with a decent head. A slightly bready aroma with a hint of citrus to it. An average American Wheat with subtle lemon highlights. A thin body contributes to this summer brew's drinkabilty. Something that I wouldn't care too much for unless I was really thirsty. An all right beer, just not great."
"Smell was grass, citrus and hops, and not deceivingly, as so was taste. Fairly light and refreshing, and in the fashion of ""hot day beers"" I drank it straight from the bottle. There was enough hop to it that I might reccomend it as a begginers IPA. My favorite offering from the magic hat bunch, so far."
"Overall: This beer is a little lacking in the flavor department, but it's not bad for something light and refreshing."
"Magic Hat is all over the map with respect to quality beer. I appreciate the fact that they take chances and that sometimes that means missing the target, but I wouldn't think it would be too difficult to brew a good APWA. Hocus Pocus could use a little bit of magic because there ain't no rabbit in the hat this time."
"Subjectivity: Not Magic Hat's best. Very light, but not unique at all. I'm saying that more and more about American pale wheat ales."
"A nice brew, goes good with the grill warming up outside and went well with the food. Nothing overpowering in the beer, good but not great."
"Pours a medium hazy straw-honey color, with a thin sudsy white cap. Aroma is wheat, biscuit, citrus, and a hint of maltiness. Flavor was a little honey-maltiness up front with some sour wheat and citrus coming out in the background. Flavor was subdued and on the watery side, making it a great quaffing lawnmower wheat ale, but that's about it. Took out the six pack I bought, but have had other more flavorful beers in this style."
"Poured a slightly hazy, straw yellow, with small head. Aroma was subdued, some sweetness, floral and citrus notes. Taste was very mild, hops were not particularly strong. What was present echoed the aroma with a light floral/citrus flavor. Body was light and carbonation was medium to high. A very drinkable beer, but not very exciting."
"Drinkability: Good summer offering from MH; not up to par with some of the other offerings I've had from them, but I don't think this beer is meant to be as heavy on the flavor anyway. Increasingly copper aroma is a little distracting after a while. Definitely drinkable, but nothing exciting."
"12oz brown bottle with best before end of September on the back. Pours a very slightly hazy medium gold with a 1 finger head, just so so longevity and lace. Smells of mild caramel malt, honey and citrus hops. Sweet honey and malt up front followed by a slight hop flavor. Citrus notes linger around as well. A tad bit watery and weak on the flavor end. Crisp and a good choice for a summertime beer, but nothing to write home about. There are better choices when it comes to flavorfull pale wheats."
"Does what it sets out to do...refresh your thirst. Not bad at all, just not terribly exciting."
"A tasty beer for sure, but not my first choice in the wheat ale department."
"""Don't mock a Soul hunderds of years Old"""
"Cheers!"
"I like Magic Hat, but this didn't seem the match up to some of the other Magic Hat brews I have had to date. A decent beer for the summer, but not outstanding. The head was small and very quick to disappear. Very faint lacing left behind. Lemon and maybe some other citrus come to the nose, along with a slight yeast smell. Fairly clean taste with a bit of hops thrown in there. Less carbonation than one would expect, but I think that helped this one. Give it a try but I'm not promising anything."
"A decent thing...so far from legendary. Go for it on a hot day. With that lower ABV you could stand to have a few in a row and hardly feel it. Not a mindblower, just a good simple beer that clearly has a purpose in hot weather."
"This beer was a clear yellow color with a medium head (aggressive pour). It had a sweet, citrusy aroma, as well as some grain. Fairly pleasant. It tasted somewhat tart, with a little hoppiness. To me, though, there was something vaguely displeasing about the taste. I'm not able to describe it, I just didn't like it. A little thin in the mouth also. I'll try other beers of this type before hitting this one again."
"This brew is a hazy, yellow-straw color with a small, film-like head. The aroma is clean, with wheat and citrus, with a bit of grain as well. No notable hop presence in the smell. The flavor has a characteristic wheat taste, with a bit of yeast and some lemon qualities. The brew is fairly dry, with an abrupt finish. Theres a somewhat bitter hop flourish that rounds out the finish. Medium body, with lower than average carbonation for the style. Its drinkable, but not a stand-out, by any means."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Excellent mouthfeel... high efferfescence, but it disperses and never gets in the way of the taste. The swallow is slick yet light, and effortless. High marks for drinkability... I wish there was more in the cooler. This is my favorite Magic Hat brew to date."
"D- What can I say, a good pick for a summer beer? Why not but certainly more on the refined side of things ... not a bad thing but this one does not shine past the many other summer beers out there."
"Crystal clear and two shades lighter than apple juice. Little head. The nose has a touch of fruit, but quite a bit of wheat and nothing in the ways of typical German wheat beer esters. On the palate, this one opens with a neutral grainyness that morphs into acidic tartness and then to a wheat finish. The emphasis here is on smoothness and approachability, which means this beer is not terribly interesting. It actually has very little to recommend it, except for being a clean, crisp refreshment substitute for a macro lager... and 150% of the price. No thanks."
"This pours a light yellow straw with a large white foamy head. The smell is a nice citrus aroma that's perfect for summer. The taste is weak and watery. The first sip tastes like citrus and floral flavors, but the aftertaste is bland and very watery. The m/f is light with the flavors not being very balanced. This really is nothing but a average to below average summer beer. I would pass on this again."
"Seems like a decent beer to me, albeit plain. Would probably be tasty on a hot summer evening. Easy drinking for sure."
"It was an easily drinkable beer because it was so light but scored lower on the drinkability scale due to its taste."
"Hocus Pocus presents itself as straw colored with golden highlights around the edges. Slight white head of small, densely packed bubbles and bold carbonation streams. The head quickly thins to a collar which leaves some lacing. Dry grass, crisp hops, and some mild wheat wafts from the glass. The tongue tingles with crispness and light carbonation, modest hop bite but extremely light body. Hints of lemon throughout. Not a particularly impressive MH beer."
"12 ounce bottle. Drink before end of O notched."
"Sometimes I'm not in the mood for this and it bores me. But, when you're looking for a summer APWA, this one is pretty tasty. More refreshing than most in the style, even. Another solid Magic Hat offering. Nothing outstanding, which is the style's biggest problem, but it's a nice example."
"Somewhat of a dissappointment when you consider all the marketing trouble they've gone to in packaging this beer. Pours a drab pale gold with a quickly falling head, some islands remain on the table, and a few fat lazy bubbles make their way to the top of the beer. Nose is that astringent, off-putting boiled grass smell with a slight bit of lemon zest to keep it from falling below a 3. Taste is slick and buttery with a tingling on the palate, but watery along the edge of the tongue. The wheat is noticeable, but nothing screams dynamic or complex here. Mouthfeel is aided by the buttery notes. Drinkable if you like this style. I'm not real happy with this one. I'll see if the spouse will drink my remaining bottles."
"I enjoyed this beer in the bottle but did not review it. I enjoyed it even more on tap and have notes that tell me I really liked it even more. Lemony summer wheat aroma of grass and doughy wheat malt. a clean tasting summer refresher that satisfies on a a Hazy, Hot and Humid day on Raritan Bay. This is a nice seasonal offering from the folks in south Burlington. The Missus liked it too."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable summer brew; a wheat beer for those who are not necessarily sold on the style but are looking for something light and refreshing, yet different"
"Drinks easily, and compliments a meal well."
"Another good beer for when you need a good thirst quencher or four. The lemon, Ringwood esters (?), and wheat character work really well together in this one to provide a unique and pleasantly balanced taste. A hard one not to like in the summer! Nice straw color and refreshing aroma."
"Tastes lemony, very lemony. Some hops, a fair amount of wheat, and a barely there sour/tangy finish. Not too complex, not too simple- a tasty mouthful. Mouthfeel is slick and kind of foamy, very bubbly and nice. Extremely light on the palate. Highly drinkable. Refreshing, light, tasty, and the sour in the background is really quite lovely."
"This is brewed as a summer seasonal and it suits that purpose pretty well but there's not much magic going on here."
"Appears as a yellowish hue, clear through, hardly any head at all. The aromas are a bit more promising that the look, providing a sense of lemon and wheat, suggesting crispness. Flavors are mild, but enjoyable; crisp, zingy, tiny bit of bitterness, a tiny diacetyl flavor also comes through. Overall, a refreshing brew on a warmer day...doesn't knock my socks off, but isn't disappointing either."
"The small is good, with lemon and wheat malt. The taste isn't as good. Wheat comes though, but the flavor is plain. The mouthfeel is reasonable and the drinkability is decent. It's a fairly refreshing beer but that's about it."
"poured an attractive amber color with moderate head that feel to a nice ring. Smell is of a nice lemony-citrus texture. Taste is a bit plain with fruity overtones that are thirst quenching. Finish is a bit dry and enjoyable. A very decent summer brew."
"Tasted: 07/17/05"
"Definitely highly drinkable, and in my opinion, what a summer seasonal should be."
"Hmm. Just saw that this is a pale wheat. I guess that explains alot of the tastes I found in it. If it's a wheat, why wasn't it cloudy?"
"This is a fairly average wheat beer. Appearance is pretty average looking like a typical golden pilsner. Smell was yeast like without much else coming through. Taste also had an extremely strong yeast component, not sweet at all, a little bland but containing just enough flavor to keep me drinking it. It's certainly not my favorite wheat beer but it's drinkable."
"Eh, wish Magic Hat would stick their necks out more with their offerings, as I just find them run-of-the-mill, for the most part, and this one is no different."
"I like my light colored Summer seasonals and I do not like this one.This beer reminds me of what many brewpubs create to appease bud drinkers. It is a waste of time. Strong honey smell and taste added to a very thin lite lager. Magic hat can do much better than this although I applaud them for trying to fill the pollenator void. Other smell and taste notes are citrus, grass, more honey, very slight malt. I think this might be better when it is really hot outside. Its not too hot here right now."
"Note: reviewed in late June 2005."
"Pours a pretty clear yellow color with little to no head. Smell is fruity like apricots with a hint of wheat, much like other summer offerings. The taste is pretty fruity as well with a terrific finish. Definitely a beer that is made for the summer and will keep you happy all summer long."
"This is a very crisp and refreshing wheat ale. Magic Hat has made another fantastic ale. This ale is very light and has quite a bit of citrus flavorings. Drank this ber at a very hot and very sunny Old Dom. brewery festival, and it was great. Perfect beer for those outside relaxing hot days. Very little head and what was there left fairly quickly."
"I am enjoying this beer and since its so drinkable Ill be enjoying a few more. This will be up near the top on my list this summer."
"This is a summer pounder. Too good to be called a ""lawnmower beer", I think you could drink this all day without getting bored. Well done."
"trash it well, to each their own."
"Pours light-medium amber with no head, lightly carbonated. Smells include a nice citrus with wheats, very light hops, slight sweetness, and a little hops. Taste was pretty good, a little too light though. Followed the nose, but I would have like the flavors a little more pronounced. Mouthfeel was very light, again, would have liked a little more body. Altogether, a pretty decent beer. For a BBQ or the beach, would be a great choice."
"Overall: kind of disappointing from Magic Hat since I usually really dig their seasonals. It's nowhere near as good as Hop Sun, which I think is available in mostly the same areas for the same or cheaper price."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. Purchased as one of Magic Hat's ""Seasonales"". Cute. Pours fast, lots of carbonation with a quickly forming, pale head. The color is ""hazy-lemon," and this just about covers the taste, too. The taste is refreshing (i.e., pretty thirst quenching), with the aroma and taste of wheat and lemon dominate. Although I do detect some honey flavor and hop floralness. This beer starts off better than it finishes. It is, not suprisingly, a little bit tart and a little bit dry -- but as the beer warmed, I detected a slight, not completely pleasant bitter flavor. This aside, it is not a bad offering from Magic Hat -- just not one of their best. If you want a beer for relief from the heat, you could do a lot worse that to try hocus pocus. That said, if you happen to still have a bottle of the no-longer-being-made Pollinator from Long Trail..."
"Well i thought this was going to be a great review but this beer is too damn dry. Not as refreshing as i thought it was going to be. It pours a hazy yellow orange with an allright head. the head was fruity. The taste is allright but not as wheaty as i would have expected. As stated before, too damn dry. The mouthfeel is light. Not as drinkable as i would haev thought but not bad."
"Drinkability: This was one of the more refreshing beers Ive had in a while. Goes down smooth and easy, and I could easily have tossed back several of these at a time if I hadnt shown some restraint. Another quality brew from a quality brewery. Definitely worth a try."
"Taste was also rather bland. Rather fruitty upfront and also very wattery. Taste and mouthfell were very thin and som malt flavor could be detected. Ample carbonation fed the head, but overall this beer was nothing special. Better than SA summer offering, but still did not do it for me."
"It's ok, dog."
"OVERALL: This beer is nothing special. Very unimpressed"
"A pretty damn approachable, basic, tasty and refreshing beer."
"Light and drinkable; nice for a hot summer day. The tartness of this brew gets to my tastebuds a little, and would prevent me from having more than one in a sitting."
"Served a hazy wheaty brewskie color with a white headskie. I've sampled quite a few wheat beers lately and I must say that Magic Hat's old classic Hocus Pocus is one of my favorites. Nice and clean with great mouthfeel and high drinkability. Worth checking out on draft around town even if it's out a bit early."
"Recomended."
"This appeared a slightly hazy yellow orange in the glad with about an inch of white foam. Some lace was left but the head dropped out of sight quickly. Aroma was a bit off with citric hops standing out over a sweet malt. There were notes of lemon and grain but overall the smell was a bit weak. The taste starts off wheaty with a hint of lemon and a slight odd taste in there I couldnt identify. Body is a bit light but it is sufficient. Not a bad beer but a rather boring one for me. With a little more work this could definitely be a good beer."
"Overall, A solid beer. One that I will try again next summer as a summer quincher."
"I would say a great summer brew!!!"
"Light bodied and dry, a bit tart, good summery session beer."
"EDIT: New cap reads, Better living through Alchemy."
"Final Thought: This cap'ed the four-type sampler from Magic Hat and I must say that I was very pleased with it and it shows they do know how to brew beer here in the USA."
"Mmmm light and refershing, I am getting happier every day that magic hat has come to pennsylvania. Light, floral nose, medium-yellow-straw color, good deal of head. Not much to describe- every has summed it up - lightly citrus, nothing overly imporessive, but its drinkablity and light mouhtfeel makes this a big one for my long summer. Enjoy"
"16oz pint glass presentation. Just a thin film of small bubbles for a head, lacing almost non-existant. Aroma is an odd combination of citrus, wheat, and something else that I couldn't identify, but it just wasn't very appealling. Taste was similar to the nose, with the slight wheat flavors not having much of a shot to be enjoyed before the lemon/unknown flavor took over. Mouthfeel and drinkability quite low, I had trouble finishing this one, and not too sure why I did."
"The mouthfeel was smooth at the start and finished quickly with a shortly lasting lemon tone. This is lighter in body, and almost thin. The tastebuds wanted some more flavor, so drinkability is down a notch even though this is a hot sun / lawn mowing type brew."
"This is a classic American wheat ale and well suited for the hot months. Crisp and clean. Nice summer session brew."
"12 ounce bottle, freshness dating notched in to the label. Pours medium amber and cloudy. White head nice and tiny bubble style. Leaves better then average amounts of lacing. Nose of wheat and floral hops. Medium bodied brew. fairly dull flavor profile, soft malts and slightly drying hoppy finish. Ehh, nothing too exciting going on here. Just a fairly pleasing light ale, decent for the summer."
"Pours a golden color with a small foamy head. Smells of a hint of lemon. The taste is like a pale ale that is a little bitter, with a little lemon. I found this to be a great summer beer. One that is best served as cold as possible, especially when you have a thirst to quench. This is a light bodied refreshing brew for a hot summers day."
"Well, the verdict is in. I just simply do not like wheat beers. An average brew from Magic Hat at best. This will probably be the last wheat beer I ever purchase."
"I enjoy Magic Hat brews so I figured I would give this one a try. I wasn't sure what kind of brew it was when I bought it but it appeared to be a pale ale, and one sip is all you need to taste that wheat. Very smooth taste. Hops are present but not overwhelming like in other pale ales. Probably the best Magic Hat brew I've tried to date. Very drinkable, average abv."
"you can't taste the wheat malt and if you want a pale, slightly hoppy, session beer, try their mother lager, which is much better, imho."
"Tastes like pot pourri. Way too much hops for my liking. Once you get past the bitterness of the hops, you are greeted by even more hops!!! I'm not a fan."
"Drank in between a Le Fin Du Monde and an Allagash Bruin. This beer doesn't even stand in the same league as those two. Very weak mouth feel. I don't think I will be having another. Disappointing, since I enjoy #9 and their other offerings. Perhaps just this keg? Summer beers should be much more enjoyable."
"This is good beer that doesn't fit any category well. That said, an open mind will make this an enjoyable and unique treat (although the aroma detracts). If you want a high quality wheat or pale ale, this won't fit the classic definition of either and therefore will be a disappointment."
"Drinkability  I actually sent back beer for the first time in my life (at the Tribeca Grand in NYC)."
"Not a bad beer, but not a beer that will live on in the annals of your taste buds either. Has a decent appearance. A bit of a sour smell, but I won't hold that against it. The taste is extra mediocre; a bit bland with some hops and a hint of a flavor that weirdly reminds me of lime juice. A little on the watery side. The carbonation level is about right, but I just can't excited enough about this one to come back too many times."
"The beer pours a gold color with a frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a fruity wheat scent with a dry, yet sweet honey aroma. The taste is good. It has a smooth and refreshing wheat flavor that goes down really easy. It has a fruity finish; a very light beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a decent wheat beer, but it is still a good drinker. It is quite refreshing; a good hot weather beer."
"Eh. Wasn't too impressed. Summer ale with a very citric taste, lemon and... orange maybe? Reminds me of Sam Adam's Summer Ale but not as drinkable. Don't get me wrong, decent beer but you have to have the taste for it... which I don't, citrus beers are starting to get on my bad side. Probably not something I'll buy again."
"Very clear light light gold with sticky white head. Decent retention. Funky ringwood aroma with a honey dirtiness to it. Very intriguing - I like it. Flavor is very dry with some astringency. Very bland flavors of spiciness that leave my mouth tingling a bit. The carbonation is medium, but combined with the taste it becomes harsh. Not a very (I need to stop saying very) good beer. I hope not to have it again."
"A dark golden colour with a small head of white foam that does not last long. The aromas are wheaty and citrus-like with that funky/fruity yeast strain of theirs (ringwood) in the mix as well. The taste is very citrus-like and wheaty with a nice fruity balance to it as well. The mouthfeel is light and the drinkability is good. A good, if uncomplex, american wheat beer. Definately a good summer pick."
"To be honest with you, Hocus Pocus really didn't knock my socks off. Sure, it's good, but to me, this is just average. Poured out a golden color with little carbonation. Aroma of some wheat, malts and some lemon pop up. Taste was actually a little smooth and creamy, with some hop bite at the end, but wasn't very impressive at all. Finishes quite dry. Granted, in the summer time I wouldn't mind buying a 6-pack once in a while, but I would rather go for something else. This beer is a little overpriced IMO."
"This oddly-named ale pours cremey, cloudy, and medium maber with a white head. Its aroma resembles sugar or spring air with a gentle suggestion of citrus. it starts witha bit of subtle bitterness over an acidic twinge. HP is medium bodied with lots of bitter hops flavor over some caramel foundations. It's finish is very bitter and dry, and manages to leave the mouth eager for another taste of ale."
"Hocus Pocus has made my Magic Hat experiance 3 for 3! Keep it coming!!"
"Magic Hat brews usually hit big or miss big with me and this one misses. I give them a bit of credit for trying to do something interesting with a light bodied beer but it doesn't work for me. This could be a decent summer brew but that's about it."
"Chill-hazed amber with nary but a halo-like trace of a head. Sweetish barley aroma with a hint of leafy hops. This aroma is surprisingy invigorating and fresh smelling. The flavor starts with a mildly sweet malt but is very well-balanced by just a hint of graininess and a subtle piney/leafy hop finish. Very clean and poppy -- though the sweetness starts to come through a bit too much as the beer warms, partly due to undercarbonation. Overall, though, this is definitely a good, wholesome, Vermont beer. Makes me feel like raising a barn with some Amish folk. Except that's Pennsylvania. And I guess the Amish don't drink. Or do they? Ah well, you get my drift."
"This beer poured out a hazy golden orange color and was topped with a small white head that thinned out fast. An interesting and lively aroma  Sweet honey, citrus and floral tones. Prominent are fresh berries and grapefruit. Beer has a pleasant bitterness and a biting dryness to it. Body is medium to light and finishes with leaving an orange taste in the mouth. This has a lot going for it  plenty of complex flavors, a perfect balance between dry and sweet, and most important, a very high drinkability. A very fine beer."
"Better than the Fat Angel, but not quite up there with Magic Hat's best offerings. Seems to be the lemon version of #9. A refreshing, light beer, good for summer, but not one of my personal favorites."
"Overall, this is a solid summer wheat."
"Appears a vibrant glowing golden orangish tone with a nice sized cream colored head leaving full patches of lacing in rings down my pint. Aroma fruit tones wrapped in pleasant floral hops slight citrus twang to it very clean smell to it no offness to be detected enough bready yeast and malt notes to blend together in harmony. Flavor is a spritzy rush of citrus I wanna say lemon sweetness no sourness here just the tone is light crisp and refreshing with the malts playing second fiddle to the party and a welcoming bitterness also exists in this great summer brew quite the experience in a bottle. Mouthfeel has a healthy carbonation not cloying in anyway with some texture in the form of watered down syrup not bad at all. Drinkability is pretty good but this bottle is wearing on me, I don't know if I could consume this in mass quantity."
"Overall - A very drinkable summer-style beer. Towards the end of the beer, the tart/sour characteristic began to somewhat take over any other flavors. A usual, difficult to classify, Magic Hat offering. I basically liked all their beers I have tried thus far, but they are kind of goofy."
"Definitely pale, with a thin off white head that dissipates quickly. Very fruity aroma with a decent hop note. Buttery, bitter taste that leaves me working my jaws like a dog licking peanut butter. The bitterness reminds me a bit of an old vegetable, maybe asparagus that grew too long in dry conditions. Mouthfeel is harsh carbonation accompanied by a sugary coating that just keeps clinging to your teeth and tongue. There is a solid malt backgorund, but there's way too much funkiness going on here. Drinkability isn't bad, but I'm glad I didn't pour a double of this. Hocus Pocus, please make it disappear."
"Taste: Very crisp and refreshing. Solid, yet light, mouthfeel. Initial sweet malt, lemony citrus, and a slight honey tinge. The ringwood works with this beer, instead of against it as in most (imho). Nicely clean and just dry enough in the finish."
"Pours a medium amber color, darker than I expected, with an impressively thick white head. Aroma is also surprisingly hoppy, much more assertive than I anticipated. Definite lemony wheaty scent, dry and a touch hoppy citric. The hops and lemon flavors work very very well together. Flavor is much less hoppy than the aroma would indicate, although hops come through somewhat in the middle and finish lightly in the end, providing a very pleasant clean dry finish when coupled with the wheat malt. Very very slight clove taste. Flavor is mostly crisp and dry wheatiness, with little in the way of esters. Body is light, carbonation is definitely active. While i wouldn't really like this any other time of the year, this is definitely lawn-mowing beer. Not bad, better than I expected. It's no german hefe, but it did the trick today."
"medium amber in color, with pure white head that lingers to the bottom. toasted malt smells, with some lemon in there too. possibly a little hops i'm not sure. balanced taste with some lemon to finish. appropriately light mouthfeel, not watery though. i wouldn't really change anything about this aspect of it. this is good for what it is: a summer beer. wouldn't be my first choice in beer all the time, but it has it's place and is good. one of my favorite summer seasonals"
"A hazy yellow gold body is capped by a decent-sized lid of bright white foam. And although it drops within a relatively short period, it does maintain a very nice creamy surface covering and leaves continuous rings of spotty lace throughout the glass. The aroma displays the typical Ringwood yeast nose and a touch of wheatish malt that's mildly lemonish. The body is light, as a summer beer should be, and the very fine carbonation gently caresses the tongue as it slides across the palate. In the flavor a delicate wheat-based malt is gently tangy and a touch citrusy and floral, backed by a supportive hop bitterness. It finishes clean and dry with the exception of some lingering yeast character and a mild touch of hops. This is the kind of beer that grows on you, and although it may seem very basic at first, it actually has enough going on to keep it interesting throughout a few. Well done!"
"Up front the taste is biscuity, raw grains, lemons, light acidity. It is crisp & tart. Finishes with a mouth puckering bitterness, including notes of pine, apples, and citrus. Very hoppy for a wheat beer."
"Overall this beer is a nice change when it comes to summery brews. It seemed to be more of an IPA with fruit flavors than just your normal summer brew. A nice easy drinking beer."
"probably my favourite summer brew. pours a light, healthy yellow gold (as opposed to a corona/bud-esque piss yellow) with a moderate head. smells of lemon and tastes echo the smell with a bit of honey as well. an excellent summer ale with a bit more body and bite to it than, say, a sam adams summer ale. a great thirst quencher on a summer day and just an excellent beer overall. another winner from magic hat."
"Poured a bright gold color with slowly rising carbonation and a pure white head. Head had low retention but very good lacing. Aroma was flat and citrusy with a bit of floral hops. The flavor is rather interesting, very soft on the tongue finishing with a slight bitterness. A great summer beer, and judging by the taste, I think this would pair beautifully with seafood dishes, especially shellfish. Interestingly enough, I noticed the same quality with MH's Single Chair, and the more I think about it, the more I am wondering if those two brews are actually the same brew. LOL."
"Im going to have to come back to this one because Im a bit stuffed up, but Im not all that impressed by this offering from Magic Hat. It certainly is unlike anything else Ive had, but there was too much out of place diacetyl, IMO. Im probably missing something because of my congestion so Ill shut up now."
"I was able to try this once while living up there,poured a nice orange/gold color with lemon zest smell to it.Very balanced ale,malt was the backbone to this with a grainy fruity ending to this.Would be good in summer,I think real good down here where the summers are stifling."
"This ale poured a light golden color with a creamy, bright white foam head. The smell was good and strong: very biscuity with a grain aroma, and a hint of floral hops and aromatics. The taste was very smooth and malty, with a hint of fruit, and low hop character. Kind of hard to describe, but reminiscent of a German dunkel. The mouthfeel was smooth and mellow - very pleasant! Slightly sweet, medium light bodied, but with a crisp finish. I found this ale to be very drinkable, but difficult to categorize (not surprising with a Magic Hat beer). In any event, I enjoyed it very much. It went down easy."
"Hazy light straw color. Some small yeast chunks are suspended. The nose is grassy wheat and lemony. Light grain breadiness shifts to tart, then fruity white grape and pear. Not stellar, but a decent thirst quenching summer wheat."
"Overall, a pretty good wheat beer though maybe a bit lighter and thinner than I expected."
"light and smooth with a somewhat strange flavor. it says it is a mix of 3 other magic hat brews humble patience, blind faith, and chaotic chemistry. this funky little mix goes down great"
"Golden body. Much effervescence. Big white head rapidly collapsing. Burst of fresh hay uncapping bottle. Not much nose out of glass at all. Barley and wheat malts present in taste, with hint of hops, but nothing jumps out. Picture of bee on label indicates that honey might be present, but I don't detect any, save for some smoothing out of the taste. An ok beer, and something to fill a cooler with for a big party as it won't offend. But not something to search out as anything special."
"Thanks go out to Davo for the sample."
"Tart, grainy, citrusy aroma.  Slightly sweet grainy start.  Tart, super-dry, stale, funkily-sour finish.  Not a very good summer drinking beer, too dry and funky tasting."
"Nice summer seasonal. Not much to the smell. Well balanced--neither malt nor hops really takes control. Light body, very refreshing, extremely easy going down."
"A some what hazy orange gold color with a fluffy head the clung till the end. Grainy, fruity and just sour enough."
