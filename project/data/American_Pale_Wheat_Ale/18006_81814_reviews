"Hard to be more refreshing than that. Who said you cannot add lots of hops to a wheat beer and still feels great? The only sin is its body; it sure could be bolder even being very light."

"To me, this looked and tasted like a summer beer, but I drank the one in my fridge rather than wait 6 months or so. It pour a relatively bright light color with a good head. The taste had lemon notes and not light and perhaps crisp hops."

"Taste is very nice. Bitter and crisp and very refreshing. Mouthfeel is very dry and light. Excellent. i could drink a number of these in a sitting."
"Hazy golden with a thick, white head. Hop forward aroma with underlying wheat, grass, floral notes. More IPA character than wheat beer, with hops leading the charge. Easy drinking. A tasty beer. It would be easy to have several of these in a session. Well done."

"Overall, really nice hoppy wheat beer. The hops definitely steal the show, but they're not too overpowering to prevent the wheat from playing too. Really, really enjoyable! Thanks to batfireman for sending this as an extra."

"O - refreshing and unique hoppy American Pale Wheat Ale featuring hops from New Zealand. I would buy this again, especially in the summertime."

"Overall: I did not expect a wheat beer to have such a hop presence, however, I really enjoyed this beer. It is good looking and great for the summer months."

"Overall - Nice to see Half Acre showing some restraint with the hops here. The wonderful wheat and malt flavors come through but the distinct bitterness leaves this a little less refreshing than I'd expect for a wheat beer especially as it warms."

"O: Crisp, crushable, and refreshing. So, so good."

"Akari Shogun is a summer drinker, my go to as a matter of fact. Citric hoppiness, wheat tang, manageable bitterness, and extreme drinkability give this guy a gold star. Too bad it's 37Â° out..."
""
"In the glass Akari Shogun pours a hazy pale straw hue topped with a moderately retained fluffy white head. The nose carries elegant floral tones blossoming into a fruit salad arrangement of tangerine, apricot and peach while also boasting a sweet candied bubblegum. Seductive wheat sweetness and lemon citrus brightly tease the palate while tamed by assertive hop bitterness. Grass and rose petal sensations delicately join lemon and mango juiciness throughout the taste. The mildly lasting finish is semi-dry and allows the wheat notes to shine; refreshing and delicate enough on the palate to make this a perfect warm weather beverage."

"On the whole, this is a world class brew. My expectations were non-existent, but this is great. On a whole different level than Gumballhead, which I previously thought was pretty solid."
""
""
"Pours a murky light orange with a foamy bone head that fades to nothing. No lacing on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, wheat, and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but the mouthfeel is off."

"O - one of my all time favorites. My favorite beer by half acre and one of the best out of Chicagoland. Outstanding and surprisingly sessionable if you clear he rest of your day..."

"Pours cloudy gold, small brown/offwhite head with a bit of lace remaining. Smells earthy/dirt with faded citrus. Taste and mouthfeel a bit off the mark for me. very bitter taste of earthy tones with a bit of citrus sweetness and a medium malt backbone that I can't quite pick out a flavor. I definitely can imagine a walnut type nut being used in this brew. Medium body with an extreme dry finish. Almost hard to swallow after taking a sip"

"Thanks to the creator of the canquest, woodychandler, for this beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is very lemony, a touch of wheat. Taste is good, lemons, wheat, some grapefruit, a good bit of hops are present, very easy drinking. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid brew."

"O - Exceptional from start to finish, Akari Shogun is a beautifully hopped beer that perfectly balances an elevated hop level with a smooth wheat body and crisp finish; perfect for the dog days of summer."

"The Crack revealed yet another brimful craft CAN and I executed a samurai Glug, cleaving the CAN in two and letting its CANtents spill into the glass. No, actually I employed an inverted Glug, resulting in a finger-and-a-half of rocky, bone-white head with decent retention. Color was a cloudy orangish-yellow. Nose had a lemon/grapefruit-citrusiness to it. Nose was more hoppy than I expected and I CANfess to unfamiliarity with that particular strain mentioned in the Notes. Mouthfeel was bubbly and effervescent and I felt as though I were picking up where I left off with that Radler earlier. The taste was odd, peppery, citrusy, quite unexpected. The finish was quite dry with the pepper and citrus flavors combining nicely. It did not seem to fit the style and I am not a style maven by any stretch, but it caught me off guard. It might be nice on a hot, humid summer's day, but I was left unimpressed."

"Got this in a very generous trade along with Gumballhead. Lots of people compare the two...huh? Not even close. Poured slightly hazy with a white foamy head and very little nose. It had even less flavor. I guess I'll just agree to disagree with the majority on this one."

"O/D-Loved it. Daisy Cutter is one of my favorite Pale Ales and this one is similar in some essences. In a very small sample size, Half Acre seems to be all its cracked up to be."

"Overall: A nice Gumballhead substitute."

"What a beer! Wasn't expecting much, was just lucky enough to get this as an extra in a trade. Funny thing was that one can busted during transport, but when it arrived I totally poured out what was left in the can (and the zip-lock bag!) and tried it on the spot. Even flat and warm, it was still delicious. ""Juicy"" is the one word I'd use to summarize this beer. Juicy, tropical, refreshing, sweet (but not too sweet), and completely delicious."

"This poured out as a slightly hazed yellow color with a nice foamy white head on top. some moderate lacing and retention here. The smell of the beer has some big lively citrusy hops on the nose. The taste has plenty of hop bitterness as well with the subtle softness of the wheat filling in later on. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and light bodied, very refreshing. Overall it's a very good brew, would drink this one again for sure."
"This is my new go-to wheat ale whenever I can get my hands on it. Delicious straight out of the can as well. One of the best new beers I've had this year."
"A light to moderate mouthfeel. A soft carbonation but the bitterness balances well. A great lingering hop finish. A bit too dry on the back end but still good. Overall a great hoppy IPA wheat."

"Overall: Another good American pale wheat ale that is hop forward. Obviously a refreshing beer for the summer."
"Overall this is pretty underwhelming, and weak watery wheat pale ale with no chewy backbone and virtually no flavor."
""
"This is an easy drinking wheat that satisfies hop cravings. I imagine this to be a great summer beer and am stoked they'll be canning it through the summer. J"

"Poured in a snifter. Appearance is a hazy yellow with a thin layer of head that leve some splotchy lacing. The nose features a strong wheaty grain profile with lemon drops and passion fruity. The hops are present but somewhat tame. The taste has plenty of wheat backbone and some dry grapefruit bitterness. Not much sweetness here. Mouthfeel is light and moderately carbonated. Decent little whet beer, nothing earth shattering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Really impressed with the balance and easy drinking of this beer. I hope this makes more appearances in the HA rotation."
"O: This tasted like a slightly wheated version of Daisy Cutter, which I'm not a huge fan of to begin with. Great aroma, but the taste is dry, grassy, and boring."
""
""
""
""
""
"Gotta love these Half Acre labels, amiright? Anyway, the beer itself pours a cloudy straw topped by a sturdy finger of ever-so-lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit rind, leek, light cantaloupe, light pineapple, and a pinch of coriander. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some orange rind, some overly-ripe mandarin orange, and a bit of wild rice. Unfortunately, a stiff bitterness pervades the finish, malingering for a tad too long, sorta ruining things a bit at the end. It's not enough to raze things completely, thankfully. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly grainy feel. Overall, a solid, fruity wheat beer, but it's nothing overtly special."
"O- The bright full hops have some nice depth and blends together a lot of different characteristics. This has a full mouthfeel but it is not a filling beer. Very sessionable."
""
""
"Pungent citrusy aroma at first, becoming grainy and wheaty over time. A certain sweet earthiness and grassy character from the Mouteka hop variety. First sips are very reminiscent of Tasty Waves and Daisy Cutter, albeit with wheat and a different hop variety. Smooth and extremely drinkable, earthy grassy bitterness lingers alongside bitter grapefruit zest. The NZ hops do lend some distinct character, and overall its pretty tasty, especially for the style. Definitely feeling the summer vibes with this one..."
"D - An American Pale Wheat Ale that does not suck. Really easy to drink and perfect for the hot summer weather. Also appropriately priced at $5.99/22oz. Watch out Gumballhead!"
""
"O: A very drinkable American Wheat Ale. Aggressively hopped, but with with a lot more wheat character than is typically seen in this category. Wouldn't mind seeing this one make its way to cans one day."
"O: This is going to be our summer beer...without a doubt."
"The balance is fantastic. I respect that they didn't go the safe route and brew something that you'd see the trixies swilling in Wrigleyville. This brew is classic Half Acre and kicks some serious IBU's! A great wheat ale that I am gonna enjoy all summer long."
"O: I'm not a fan of wheat beers but this one is pretty well done. Highly hopped for the style with citrus and pine notes."
"O- A pretty damn tasty beer, it's very hop forward and probably tastes more like an IPA than a Hefeweizen, but is still an awesome beer, if this was available in four-packs it might be the first wheat beer I would actually pick up regularly."
