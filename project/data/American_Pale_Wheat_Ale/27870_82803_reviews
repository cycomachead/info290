"Great looking beer....lots of citrus....orange zest creates an awkward aftertaste."
""
"O.  A decent beer that might be a little on the heavy side to be sessionable even tho the abv states otherwise.  But doable.  The orange taste kinda reminds me of tang.  Looks nice.  Smells ok.  Above average beer but nothing to search for."
"Sounds like my experience at SummerFest listening to Rodrigo y Gabriela...  Anyway, this stuff pours a hazy orange-brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam.  The nose comprises orange rind, very mild caramel, and a twinge of pine resin.  The taste mostly brings in more of the same, though the resin mixes with the rind in a strange way, creating a strong bitterness that ruins a lot of the synergy between the cracked wheat and citrus characters.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, this beer just didn't do it for me.  The bitterness offsets any enjoyable fruitiness and overpowers any hope of balance.  It's not terrible, but I'll likely never have this stuff again."

"Overall, this was a pretty solid pale wheat with orange zest certainly contributing to the flavor.  Enjoyable and pretty unique.  Would imagine fresh is best but this turned into an orange soda inspired wheat beer and the subtle bitterness kept me interested."

"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of oranges, some wheat. Taste is wheat, oranges, some tartness, decent flavor. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall a pretty good beer."

"O- I don't eat sugar cereal anymore, but this is nostalgic!  Every once in a while, a fun one."

"Overall, a quite tasty and easy drinking. Kind of like sucking on an orange peel, in a good way."

"O 3.5 - I like this for what it is. Thinking outside the box but still keeping it simple. I'll probably try this again next summer."

"Super floral, really well-crafted. Certainly worth picking up a sixer. It's definitely more on the session-y side, but it does not come up short in the flavor category whatsoever."

"Cracked the can and poured into my stemless wineglass. Pours hazy copper with a thick fluffy white head; which later retreats into a thin cover of sudsy foam with lacing on the glass. Heavy citrus aroma from the orange zest and hops. Citrus flavor with a muted but apparent hop bitterness. Nice and full bodied especially for 5% ABV, with a dry finish. A solid summer beer, that isn't available in my area but would reach heavy summer rotation if it was."

"RATHER NICE; WORTH TRYING!"
""
"Poured into a wine glass, golden hued with a wisp of tight white head. Smells of orange and flowers, a bit of malt sweetness. The taste is very floral up front with orange zest dominating the finish. Light and crisp, although, slightly under carbed. A nice summer beer for sure."

"Wheat + orange zest just didn't work well enough for me to break into even a mild lather. Decent."

"Light mouthfeel with a slightly dry finish. Overall, a solid offering that will work well in the summer rotation. 4 Hands is putting out some good stuff and canning is an added plus."

"Dark golden to light copper in color with a quarter inch thick light white foam cap resting on top. Citrus hop and orange aroma. The flavor is fresh, pungent citrus hops and pale wheat. The mouth is moderately carbonated and the hop bitterness pricks my tongue. This is likely dry hopped."
""
"Very orange forward in the nose, slightly sweet like candy orange slices. Taste is similar, candied orange peels, light bitterness, minor pale malt presence, wheaty lightness. Body is fairly light, it was pretty smooth and drinkable, would look for this one again."

"Overall I think four hands has done something wonderful here and this will be my summer drink of choice."

"O- This was ok, the adjunct made the beer worse in my opinion"

"Overall, a solid pale wheat ale, and one that I'll likely get again. Not sure it's up there with some of the best ""hoppy"" wheat beers that seem to becoming very popular, but it was light and refreshing and probably worth another go, since it's pretty easy to get around here."

"O - Very light and lots of orange zest."

"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but has a much better citrus hop smell."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer. Very refreshing and drinkable. Would drink again."

"O: very refreshing and great for this style. Nice aftertaste and good balance overall."

"Tasty, and definitely a warmer weather style."
""
"Well if this is a wheat, which I'm sure it is, the hops certainly have taken over things. Spiced up from it beyond where wheat characteristics can shine. Full and frothy carbonation. This is a good beer, sure. But standing as a wheat ale, it doesn't really fit to style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - One of the better summer brews of the season."
""
""

"Love these hoppy wheats that have popped up here and there. This does not disappoint. Well-crafted."
""
""
""
"Overall: A very well-constructed hoppy wheat; rarely do I seek out the style but this one is for real"

"Pours a pale orangeish yellow with a very lively head upon the pour that retains nicely. The smell features nice bready wheat malts paired with big orange citrus character. Notes of lemon, pine, and grapefruit interplay nicely with cereal grains and bread. Taste is very fruity up front with notes of orange zest and pine. Heavy hop bitterness starts and finishes the flavor with sturdy wheat profile in the middle. Mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated. Overall, a very refreshing hoppy wheat beer, worth a try for sure."
""
""
""
"Overall a very solid summer ale, one I'd drink regularly if I could."
"It's a nice hoppy wheat that drinks easy. I'd imagine this to be a good summer lawnmower beer. I just wish it had a little more body and pronounced flavor to it."
""
""
"Yep, I'll have another. Tasty, indeed."
""
""
""
"Pretty good brew. It seems like they have perfected this hop profile and vary it between their DIPA, IPA and APA and know utilize it for this wheat ale. Nice job 4 Hands."
""
""
"O - This is a great sessionable IPA. 4 Hands continues to impress!"
