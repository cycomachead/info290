3.58,11.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 8/3/2014. Pours lightly hazy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, citrus peel, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon/orange zest, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good robustness and balance of pale malt, citrus peel, and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a very solid pale wheat ale style. All around good balance and robustness of pale malt, citrus peel, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 15, 2015"

The taste generally brings in more of the same, but now the lemon takes command (and in quite the funky style), and some mild cardboard buts its way in as well. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, though I can see people actually enjoying such a lemonade-y beer in the Summer months, this stuff just ain't my schtick.

Spritzy carbonation forms a dainty head that shows modest staying power with some lacing. Aromas are bready, spicy, yeasty, grassy, and with an evident wheat aroma. Pretty well balanced, but does show some raw grain characteristics. Flavors intensify with the raw grain taste, especially the wheat, while giving a spicy, bready, lemony taste. White pepper, clove, and citrus notes round out the spiciness. Texture is a little thin for wheat-based beers, but lighten considerable for ease of consumption, albeit dumbing down in the process.

Smooth if somewhat flat mouthfeel mitigates things somewhat, as does the fact that the pint glass was empty in about ten minutes. Yet this isn't a great beer, fairly pedestrian like most of the wares I've had from Breckenridge, and among summer beers generally. In fact, after this bottled mediocrity, I have to say that the summer style, be it kolsch or the American Pale Wheat Ale that Breckenridge terms this, is easily one of my least favorite beer styles.

The smell is not really on par with a wheat, containing no smells of citrus or banana/clove. Instead there is a smell of rubbery sourdough and hop undertones. The taste is unique but does not fit this category either, starting with a high bitter start with hints of sweet malt, wheat, and a crisp hop finish. The sourdough taste overpowers most of the characteristics of a wheat beer but they do fade as it warms and surprisingly show a little more wheat flavor. I did however enjoy the hop finish after the wheat taste. Light mouthfeek with relatively moderate-high carbonation.

Wheat gluten comes across pastey due to the low intensity of other malt flavors. carbonation cleans the palette without any acrid sting. The beer could be sticky if not for the carb. Mild oranges could be from the hops, but they have an estery quality about them. More hop flavored (md) than bitter (low). Thicker mouthfeel seems to come from protein and dextrins. Hops are light floral and honey-like. The thickness sticks and just doesn't fit in a summer quencher, IMO.","mentor","Jul 25, 2007"

Taste was a let down, I dont know how to say it other than what everyone else said, there just wasnt much to it. Some citrus accents and some bitterness but not much else, not a great aftertaste either. Carbonation was good, and it is drinkable but thats due to the light mouthfeel and lack of taste.

On the palate, it is very biscuity, with the wheat dominating. There's a bit of a vegetal DMS like flavor, not very pleasant, but it is otherwise unoffending.

Wasn't sure about it at first, but after drinking most of the bottle I'm pretty sure that this tastes very much of a white wine. Not a bad thing, just different, but I like it.
