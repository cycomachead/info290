"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of wheat, oranges. Taste is crisp, wheat, spice, a bit of orange, easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a thirst quenching and enjoyable beer."

"Due to the wheat, coriander and orange peel I was expecting a wit influence. Doesn't looks, smell or taste like a wit at all, it's pure American style wheat. Which is just dandy after a 6 mile train run."

"This beer was vey unique to me. Had a flavor but more bitterness than the flavor. Wasn't bad at all tho I went to a local brew store in my home town where they said its a big favorite so Ihad to give it a try and was honestly impressed. Taste a little like a light beer I guess you could say. Very hard to really explain cause it was so different to me. Go try it"

"I imagine this is fairly popular & would work when it is hot & humid, but only for two at the most for me. There are way better wheat beers out there. One & done"

"Atmosphere is okay. No head and no lacing. Nose is light and bready. Light grainy flavor accentuated with a little hint of sweet. Overall, this is an okay quaff."

"Thanks to Brad for sending this out my way. Tick. The beer is golden hued with a thin, fleeting white head. the aroma offers sweet malt, grain, ripe fruit. Sweet and cloying with fairly low carbonation. Not something I would try more than once. Lacking wheat and hop character. Bland. No fun."

"O- This is one of the worst wheat beers I've ever had. At least Canebreak has some flavor even if it's not that good."

"This beer pours up a hazy pale gold with a small head, no retention, and no lacing. Smell is citrus, not bad, and maybe the strongest feature of this offering. Taste is very weak with notes of tangy orange and spicy coriander. A little aspiriny taste is there too. Mouthfeel is thin. This one is okay, but nowhere near being my favorite. But it beats the hell out of the Shocktop equivalent."

"This beer is, like most deep southern beers, a slightly simplified version of the style. I like the yeast and wheat melange with a touch of citrus at first but eventually it bores me. I do imagine it would be refreshing in warmer weather. The texture is okay at first but finishes dry and a touch chalky. A little sourness in the aftertaste isn't too encouraging either. Not worth driving eleven hours for."

"Drink- It was semi tasty. A little heavy handed at times, but then with 90+ degree heat was fine."

"Poured into a pint glass. Pours clear yellow with a tall, fizzy white head that dissipates quickly. Plenty of tiny bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. It looks super carbonated. There are aromas of bready malt, orange, and spices. The flavor is bready from the barley and wheat malts. There are mild contributions from the orange peel and the coriander. The hop presence is there, but not strong. The body is light with plentiful carbonation. It is crisp and refreshing. It's the sort of beer that would be very drinkable after being outside on a summer day. This is a good beer, if only a bit standard."
"Comes out of the tap a pretty, bubbly golden yellow; head is thin but this is apparently an artifact of the pour. Rich aroma is wheaty with firm tones of apple, lemon and banana. Satisfying flavor has a wheaty core and fruity notes plus a hint of butterscotch and a touch of hops. Lively texture has average body but plenty of tingle and sass. A truly satisfying summer brew, certain to cool you off on a hot day. (And itâ€™s hot as all-get-out in Atlanta right now - in May!)"
""
"Taste is just above average with a slight wheaty orange lager flavor. Nothing crazy here but crisp and refreshing. I could drink several of these with no trouble. While not amazing, this is a decent session summer brew."

"O-Imo, it's descent and very drinkable, but not impressive in the least. Glad my friend picked some up for me to try. Thanks Julie!"
"This beer has a medium amber color and is very transparent. The head is small and disappears quickly. The beer smells bready and sweet with a hint of citrus. The taste is malty, sweet, with very subtle hops and spice at the end. It's light bodied and refreshing. Overall, the beer is light, sweet, and very easy to drink."
"Mouthfeel-"
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, there are better beers in the style but this is a decent lighter beer to drink for a while."
"Overall: This is a throw back lawn mower beer. This would also work well for macro loving friends."
"Overall: A clean, if somewhat bland American Wheat. Could use some more spices and more protein to help hold some head."
"This claims to be a summer wheat, so I was expecting a Weizen style, and I expected some added spice as well. The best thing I can say about this is that it is inoffensive. Its sweetness is balanced by a slightly metallic zing. The orange flavor doesn't show as an orange-peel or essence--maybe it is folded into the sweetness. It has almost no wheat characteristics; it really looks like a lager in the glass, only faintly rusty; no conventional ""native"" wheat spiciness or fruitiness, and the added spice is nondescript. This beer reminds me of Shiner Bock--it shares that beer's somewhat papery overtone. It suggests a beer like Shiner also in that it comes from a nominally quirky brewery that is obviously trying not to startle people used to mainstream beers. These guys need to take the governor off their system and really make a Weizen-style with corriander and orange. It sounds good."
"Overall: This is good for the style, but the only Lazy Magnolia beer that did not blow me away. This one is not a bad beer, especially on a hot day, however it is the only LM I will not seek out again."
"M - a bit crisp and a little astringent. Medium carbonation."
"O: Average kinda beer. Can see why I would drink this without end on a hot and humid southern day. Great for sessioning, but loses points for originality - fairly simple."
"d-refreshing, would drink again, 2 or 3 probably preferable"
"Don't know why they're adding the coriander and orange peel if it's with such a light hand. Kinda like an upmarket Blue Moon, which is not a compliment. Too stick to be the summer drinker they want it to be."
"D-would be nice on a summer day."
"This would be one of the most drinkable beers I could think of on a hot day. Even though it isn't a hot day and I'm inside, I still enjoy this immensely. Probably one of the best sessionable beers around."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability - Fairly decent brew. Might be fun to experiment with adding lemon or lime, but certainly best to first taste this one alone to get the full experience of the true beer."
"I wonder if this is misclassified - not much wheat going on. Not much of anything going on, for that matter. Poured a slightly amber, light brown. None of the spices made much of an impression. Nondescript light malt flavor was the most noteworthy aspect."
"D - Goes down really quickly and easily. I could easily have a large quantity of this. Definitely for those warm weather days..."
"D= Decent beer for a summertime beer to have in the fridge, but it's really nothing to special..."
"Butterscotch in color with no head to speak of. The smell carries some herbs (cilantro, parsley, sage), but I'm not picking up any spice. The smell is of a saison that was brewed with a poor choice of spices and the taste is even worse. This beer is vegetal and it shouldn't be if it were done correctly. If someone had asked me what this beer had been brewed with I would have been tempted to answer ""celery"". Any sweetness or bitterness from any traditional ingredients is loss in the effort to block the vegetal taste from your tongue, but it's not easy. Still, there is a mild sweetness from the light malts, but no bitterness from the hops. I rarely pour a beer, but this one had to go and I also left behind 5 bottles form the six-pack for the next person to get the hotel room. I hope they have the good sense to pour it too."
"EDIT: had this beer on tap a couple weeks ago and was not impressed. I don't know what the deal was but it was very lackluster. I'm not going to edit the numbers but just leave a note in here. Could have been the keg, the glassware, or inconsistency in brewing. Without knowing more I can't take this beer down a peg or two based on one bad experience after having a better than average review of it before. If it happens again I'll play with the numbers and make note of it. otherwise I'll leave it where it sits."
"Great drinkable beer. I'm surprised at the low ratings. It's a 'summer beer' folks!!"
"Drinkability isn't good, though I imagine the big spiced character could potentially et out of hand. Certainly not bad though."
"D: Pretty drinkable. The label compliments itself on its superb drinkable in Southeastern summers, but having reviewed this beer outside in Alabama in July, I can say with authority this claim is overrated. Drinkable? Sure. Sublimely so? Nope."
"Overall just interesting I guess. Not something I would go after again I don't think, but a pleasant experience overall I would say. Like I said, I'm just not an ale guy, even during the summer months."
"Poured a decently clear (slight haze) tangerine with little specks of sediment on the bottom of the glass. Short lived 1.5"" white head that left a scant ring. A small patch of lacing. Looks somewhat disappointing... And yes, it is quite so. Aroma of metallic orange sherbet with a tangy wheat touch. And tastes exactly as it smells as well. This is lacking in orange and has a weird metallic off flavor that is definitely getting in the way of my enjoyment. Slight caramel in the finish. Bubbly and lots of carbonation. I'm not a fan, hope I can finish this..."
"Tastes like a witbier without the soft and mildly fruity wit yeast profile. Strong spicing and plenty of wheat flavors. Some pithy orange peel flavors dont quite meld with the coriander...was hoping for something a bit softer. Still fairly enjoyable though, crisp and refreshing, tart even. Not bad, worth a go in the summertime."
"D - Easy drinking refreshing beer that is pretty forgettable."
"D: Very drinkable, a solid little wheat ale. Glad Lazy Mag has started bottling more than just the Southern Pecan."
"Light bodied, with somewhat tingly carbonation. Not a bad summer beer. Not great, but a fairly easy drinker."
"Pours to a thin white head and no lacing. Orange-gold color, brilliant clarity. Aroma is strong wheat grain, orange peel and coriander. Flavor is (see aroma). Mouthfeel is light and clean with strong carbonation. Overall, a tasty, easy drinking, in-your-face herb-spice signature and tasty, refreshing wheat base that has broad appeal."
"Drinkability is not great find this brew kind of dull and boring."
"tastes just like your average wheat beer with the orange and coriander on top. pretty light and refreshing after a day of painting but a little too sweet and flowery for me."
"It would be highly drinkable and refreshing were it not for the grainy metallic finish, which i did not care for. A decent beer, but not one that I would seek out again"
"D - The harshness of the carbonation is the only real inhibitor here. This might be nice on a hot day down in the delta, but I can't see any other reason to re-visit this one."
"The Indian Summer wheat pours a clear golden orange color with a minimal white frothy head and lots of carbonation. Not much retention on the glass. Also no haze to the color. Smells of musky grains and some citrus fruits. Not overpowering but pretty pleasant. Taste has much more citrus fruits than the nose. Lots of grapefruit with some bitterness to the finish. Some spiciness as well. Mouthfeel is crisp and fairly thin. Drinkability is solid. I really enjoy this beer, not overpowering but a nice flavor profile. Simple and and enjoyable."
"Wow, BOTMC selection from Brett Favre's hometown, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top yields a nice spicy nutmeg and coriander with some citrus notes particularly orange and banana. Pours to a pale yellow orange with a foamy multi-sized bubble head. Taste is very summer-like, nice spicing, hint of coriander, banana and orange zest. Good mouthfeel, not over carbonated. Tastes perfect on this 88 degree day. Taste is consistant throughout. I like the finish as it gets real zesty and tangy leaving a hankering for the next sip. For what this is its spot on. A great summer beer."
"Overall a very bland lifeless beer. Not something I would ever pick up on my own."
"Drinkability: A drinkable brew due to its low alcohol content, light mouthfeel and non-overpowering flavors. However, since I found this to be kind of lifeless, I will not seek out again."
"I wasn't all that impressed, it was a little more bitter than I would have liked and lacked a punch of flavor that I expected."
"This beer takes me back to when I used to drink Hoegaarden and Blue Moon like it was my job. Those beers were ultimately my gateway to ""better beer"" and Indian Summer would have been a staple for me a decade ago had I been able to get my hands on some. Witbiers are no longer my cup of tea (or beer...whatever) but I'm glad I got to try this one. I actually wish I had another bottle or two so some of my non-craft drinking friends could give it a whirl."
"This was a nice beer sent as a extra. I am glad I got to try it. It pours a light haze yellow. Some bananna sugar. It is a light beer at heart and has a nice taste but does not really break any new boundries or even hold its own. This would only be a go to if this was all I had to choose."
"This is a beer that you could pound down all night long. Unfortunately, that's not what I really look for in a beer. It usually means that there just isn't alot going on with the beer, flavorwise. I can think of a few other beers that I'd reach for first the next time that I want a wheat beer."
"D: All in all pretty good brew, gonna be great on a hot summer weekend."
"I don't care for this style but Lazy Magnolia has produced a wheat ale that is as good as most. This would be enjoyable on a warm summer day."
"Drinkability: No weight to it and it tastes like water with an orange slice, so while you could drink a ton of it, but there's really no flavor or substance to it so why would you?"
"Nice pale copper sort of color. Not much in the way of carbonation. Bready and caramel like aromas. Nice solid malt flavor upfront. Soft bitterness in the backround. Lingering sweetness. Very solid body for the lower abv. A nice beer-a lot of flavor and body. I could see doing a lot of this in any season."
"Medium bodied, light effervesce on tongue tip. Slightly warming in throat. Very nice, will look for more from them."
"Comments: It was not what I expected. I anticipated something more like a Belgian Wit or a German Hefe, but it was neither. None of the cloudy, flavorful yeasts to be had in those styles. However, I don't think this was supposed to be one of those but rather it's own thing."
"Taste is a nice combination of wheaty and spicy. like a combo of an american wheat with a Belgian. It's quite drinkable and quite well done!"
"It's light and crisp, but that doesn't nearly make up for the taste. Oh, well. Lazy Magnolia makes better stuff, so when I visit family in Louisiana, at least I'll have better options."
"D - I'd drink this on the regular if I had to, as it is a good baseline craft beer. I wouldn't seek it out again though"
"Pours golden orange with a minimal white head. Not much aroma, but what is there is wheat and some unidentifiable fruit. The flavor is more pronounced with wheat, yeast and a citrus fruit, possibly apricot or orange. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Nothing special, but this would be a great beer to drink on a hot summer day."
"This one is meant for a hot day as it probably is in Mississippi during the Indian summer days down there. I felt like this beer would be more suited to drinking in September up here in New England."
"(D)- This is very nostalgic of my childhood when I would get sick and have to drink that orange flavored medicine; not the fondest memories considering they all surround me being sick or ill. Sorry, but this one doesnt sit well with me."
"Light up front with a heavier medium body towards the end of the palate with a nice amount of bready yeast, light sweet citrus fruit, subtle malt backbone and a prominent peppery/spicy character. Nice biscuit and graham crackery malt backbone with subtle bread flavor along with sweet citrus orange peel and a strong spicy corriander presence. The corriander flavor is the most prominent but there is also a good amount of the orange peel citrus. Well balanced and a refreshing session beer for the warmer months."
"D = This is a nice drinkable beer that would make a very good choice for a patio beer in good bar-b-que weather."
"D - I can't get over this incredibly awkward flavor! I don't know what it is but I don't like it. It's really not...bad per se but it's not something I'd want again."
"Thanks to piginapen for this one. It pours a fizzy yellow with a moderate white head. The aroma is bread infused with coriander. The flavor profile is heavy on orange and coriander, slightly sweet and zesty. The beer is a bit thin. A decent wheat beer that kinda works for me."
"This is an easy summer drinker, and a good offering from Lazy Mag."
"Thanks to JoeyR for bringing it to the tasting."
"This was my first offering from this brewery. While I probably wouldn't order it again, I would recommend it to those that want a light beer that is not an American adjunct lager."
"d - great summer beer."
"D - I wasn't expecting a lot, especially after smelling it and seeing the weak head, but this is very pleasant and drinkable. The spice character is distinct, but restrained enough that it doesn't overwhelm the palate. A nice, drinkable summer beer."
"M/D - light and crisp. medium carbonation and refreshing. Easy to put a couple down. Very enjoyable."
"D 3.5 - not bad, just not great. I would take and Oberon or most other wheat offering over this one. I would not say I disliked it, just would not pursue it. Smell rocks. Weak every other catergory."
"Nice mouthfeel and very drinkable. I don't love american wheats, but this is as good as most I have had. It is my first lazy magnolia that was bought in FL."
"A light beer with a medium amount of carbonation. Lightn and refreshing, an easy drinker in the summer as intended so points for fulfilling its purpose. Not something I'd regularly turn to but worth a try every now and again during the hot days."
"Yep, a good summer beer. Not much complexities, but still enjoyable and subtle. This is would be good for a BBQ or summer party."
"Had this the other night after work. Poured a bronze/copper color with thin white head that faded quickly and left no lacing. Smelled spicy with a little bit of malts. Tasted spicy (coriander?) and slightly citrusy. A little too fizzy for me, and while I didn't have to struggle to drink this, it did not go down easy."
"This one drinks quite well and has a few very cool twists. Would definitely snag a sixer of this every now and then if it was readily available."
"M/D - Light and crisp. Well carbonated and easy drinking. A drinkable wheat, but a little too much of the forced flavor for my liking."
"-Bye"
"Beer is a golden color with a slight tint of amber to it. The head is about avg and needed some work to have it form well. The aroma is faint but pleasant of a orangy tang with a bit of zest in the background. Taste is a pleasant and relaxed experience for me. A wheat flavor pushes threw with a malt sweetness in the background with just hint of some kind of bite. The brew is a tasty and light brew and I would welcome it on any hot day. Drinkability is high mainly for me due to the refreashing light flavor and body."
"D- This beer has a nice but soft flavor making it a good summer sipper. The spice flavors are subtle and don't get in the way of the malt or hops."
"The spicing is just enough to make it stand out a bit from a typical American Pale Wheat. A nice warm-weather refresher!"
"Mouthfeel: some carbonation but feels more like a light beer. Definitely could drink a six-pack without feeling full."
"Carbonation is nice on the tongue, very refreshing beer...probably good in the MS summer! Easy drinking stuff."
"Aroma is mostly grain, but a bit of wet cardboard distracts and joins the mix. Quaff is a subdued spice and coriander with a sturdy dose of wheat and a soapy finish. Not a lot of depth and overall rather bland. Drinkable in the summer heat, the rest of the sixer will be some lawn-mower brews."
"Overall a very nice, and very sessionable little ale. Lots of depth to the profile and a smooth, and very nice easy drinking to it. I would go here again for sure."
"Overall: The mouth feel is carbonated and smooth. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is light. I am not a big fan of this style of beer. This beer has renewed my faith that this is a descent drink beer. The spice is really nice addition to the beer. I enjoyed drinking this beer."
"I'm not nearly as impressed with this one as I have been with my previous 2 LM beers (Southern Pecan and Jefferson Stout), as I'm not exactly sure what they were aiming to do style-wise. That said, it's still fairly drinkable especially on a warm day."
"12oz bottle thanks to deepsouth. Nice golden color, effervescent, bubbly but the head doesn't last for shit. Smells like spices, almost Belgian but not quite. It tasted odd and I honestly couldn't tell if they were shooting for a Belgian witbier or an American wheat. It was easy enough to drink but it was still confused."
"D - This beer could be a very refreshing and sessionable beer, but the spiciness on the tongue is really ruining it for me, but it might be your thing, so give the latest offering from Lazy Magnolia a shot"
"O- Not a terrible beer. The orange is a little overemphasized for my taste. A good session beer if you like the taste. I would love this beer if they backed off on the orange flavor and fixed the fizzy carbonation level."
"Pours a perfectly clear, dark gold with a small white head that dissipates to nothing after just a few seconds--it's not the glass, either. Smells faintly of slightly tart wheat, some orange, and coriander. Not a whole lot there, really. The flavor is on the weak side as well. After an initially shock of wheat and citrus, it finishes like spiced water. Light feel. Its best quality is its drinkability; it's quite mild--it would certainly be nice on summer day on the gulf coast."
"Mouthfeel, like most of the Lazy Magnolia offerings, is a bit thin. It does have really nice carbonation. Drinkability on a hot summer day would be outstanding. Otherwise, it's just okay. Overall, this is a pretty ho-hum beer that really doesn't stand up to my LM favorites: Southern Pecan and the Jefferson Stout."
"It's not a bad beer and is worth a try, but I don't think I'll revisit it."
"Drinks with ease. Indian Summer is a great tasting local brew. I described it once as like the feeling you get early in the morning after you drink a glass of the best orange juice. One of my favorites. If you get the chance, at least try it. It's a good session beer for hot days."
"I was not impressed by the smell. kinda wheaty, not really all that good. The first glass I pored had a nice head, the rest of them didn't. This beer is better then it smells though, pretty interesting, like a spicy wheat beer. Not strong tasting at all though, I might buy a cask of this again next summer on a cook out, but other then that I am going to hold out for the bottled version which should be coming this way pretty soon."
"It's a clear light yellow gold with a white foamy head. Doesn't look like much. Nose is sweet wheaty hops. Gentle but nice. Taste is very floral hops, with oranges and sugar. Not what I was expecting, but pretty good. Slight mustiness. Mouthfeel falls flat. Low alcohol."
"Had one of these poured at the Gov't Street Grocery in Ocean Springs, MS. Appearance is gold with orangy tints and has a thin white head. It smells of citrusy hops with a little spice. The taste was not too good--artificial orange flavor, some hops with a hint of berries. Mouthfeel was only average, fairly clean. Not a very drinkable beer because it's essentially a Blue Moon knockoff with overpowering orange flavor."
"D: This is a great summer beer. It is cool and crisp, but still has the citrus and sweetness you are looking for is such a brew. Really enjoyable and a good follow up to the Southern Pecan."
"Pours a wheat yellow with an orange glowing tint. Little to no head coming off the cask. Pretty clear and light looking as one would figure with a ""summer"" beer. Doesn't really smell too strongly but has hints of light hops and a malty aroma. It tastes really good. Especially on a hot muggy day after the Magic City Brewfest. It tastes of subtle malt and a little citrus twist as it goes to the throat. Very light and fluffy mouthfeel and extremely drinkable. Looking forward to more of these."
"01/12/2009 Just had from the bottle. Still kind of bland."
"I really did not know what to make of this beer. I see that it is listed as a ""Pale Wheat Ale", but even at that, it was still lacking. The head was white but rapidly dissipating as it arrived. The color was a deep gold with NE-quality clarity. The nose was pretty light with a faint, sweet fruitiness. The mouthfeel was medium with a faint bitterness on the tongue. The finish also had a faint bitterness, but not enough to satisfy."
"D: A good beer that seems quite the easy drinker, especially in the summer heat. A refreshingly light and clean ale that should compete well if LMBC can keep spreading the word about their beers throughout the Gulf Region. Definitely worth trying and one I'd have again."
"D- Well, the first one was very drinkable, but with the party pig losing carbonation after the first pour, it's a pretty expensive beer ($34.99). I vowed to never buy another party pig (this was my second pig purchase the first was Blue Heron and yielded the same results). I based my scoring on the first beer, so I tried to maintain my objectivity. Good news though, word has it Lazy MAg will begin bottling their brew this month. Not sure about the distribution."
"D: Nothing to right home about, yet this beer is quite tasty and enjoyable. Could make a great session beer."
"Mouthfeel is fizzy, and citrusy with a dry finish."
