They added yeast before bottling to create a secondary fermentation and you can tell by smell. Taste leaves something to be desired. A little thin, drinks like water.

Aroma is of yeast, wheat malt, spices and ripe apples. Body is medium and smooth. Wheat malt, yeast, ripe fruit and spices fill the mouth. Finish is long and spicy. Quite good for a wheat beer.","mikeg67","Oct 13, 2014"

Aroma of sweet fruit perhaps fig or apricot.  Taste and mouthfeel are undesirable for me but in the realm of wheat beer in the higher levels of wheat beer.  Good for the genre.","bryanbullock","Apr 20, 2014"

Some streaky lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma is of wheat grains and yeast. The taste is the same with a hint of light spice as well. Clean and crisp and goes down easy. No harsh or bitterness at all. Great anytime of the year and one of my favorite wheats.","BeerWithMike","Apr 20, 2014"

Tangy, lemony aroma. Flavor is just not really there for me. I get some sweetness and some yeast and lemon, but overall this really hangs back. Mouthfeel is actually pretty satisfying; I feel like there's just some flavor there that I am not getting. I am a fan of hefeweizen in general but I'd handily take a Paulaner or White Rascal over this. This tastes like a fuller-bodied Blue Moon to me, but I wouldn't refuse one. This'd be great on a hot day or to take camping or boating. This would also probably greatly benefit from a lemon or orange wedge but I've already drank most of it so screw it. Decent, but there are a number of widely available wheats in the same price point that I would rather buy.","BeerWizard","Mar 09, 2014"

Smell is pretty malt forward. Definitely sweet caramel and almost a little lemon in the smell. Taste is definitely some nice caramel malt with a little hint of Belgian yeast which I think is quite tasty. There is definitely a little banana/clove taste from the yeast that really works well. Not really much flavor from any hops which seems really appropriate for the style. The mouthfeel is thin as here isn't too much carbonation in the beer. Overall a fairly nice tasting beer.

I assuming because this is an American Wheat Beer and most likely the yeast they use is not the same as Bavarian yeast. Lacing is acute and dwindles away. A very simplistic wheat beer with very little or any unique qualities. The head is solid white and dissipates quickly. A good amount of yeast floats about in this beer and settles with time. Not the best wheat beer by far but I have to admit its easy to drink and sure offers a lot more then the domestics to be found. Liquid white bread anyone?

The smell is yeast, bread, an initial hit of clove, and a touch of lemon with some hop finish. This has a nice mouthfeel, but its taste is lacking some body. Overall its taste is very much like a simple bread, but it lacks some character. While this won't fill you up on a hot day, its going to leave you feeling a bit empty in a different way - that initial hint of clove dissipates and there is no bannana flavor found in beers of a similar style.","innersanctum","Jun 21, 2012"

What showed up was a pint glass with a cloudy golden colored brew typical of a weizenbier. After checking with the bar, I discovered it was in fact the Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat beer. As a Wheat Beer this was at best unremarkable but drinkable. It tasted like a light beer with hardly any alcohol and had a slight wheat flavor with an early hint of citrus.

3.33,-6.2,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Starting my way through the current sampler box right here. It pours a pretty clear straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises lemon zest, black pepper, rock salt, and a touch of honey. Lemme see if I can properly put my impression of this smell into words: It's refreshing and pleasant, but also unexpected, which is slightly off-putting. God, I hope that makes some sense. The taste holds notes of wheat, light lemon zest, light black pepper, a pinch of salt, and a decidedly light undercurrent of caramel beneath it all. The body is pretty light, with a very light moderate carbonation and a very slightly grainy feel. Overall, an okay wheat beer, but the bit of salty character (which I normally welcome) seems very out-of-place, and everything else is just kinda bland and boring. Not a bad thirst-quencher, though.","TMoney2591","Aug 03, 2011"

The smell was only average, it was very yeasty- I did not pick up much citrus or hop aroma. The mouthfeel was average, slightly watered down. The taste was average. This is a great ""starter beer"" for trying to get someone out of the American Light Lager Box. 7 Years ago, I would have loved this.

3.98,12.1,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"12 oz. twist-off stubby, with clearly marked freshness date. Brewed to 11.5 Plato, hopped to 14 IBUs, fermented to 3.1% ABW, and bottle-conditioned to 2.8 volumes of carbonation. Before the yeast it is a crystal-clear bright gold, with lots of fizz that builds up a crackly white head and leaves light lacing. The yeast makes it opaque and pushes it into yellow territory. Light but pleasant aroma contributes yeast, wheat and a few esters. The flavor is very light as well, almost thin, but there are notes of lemon, toasty crackers, wheat, nutty yeast, grass/hay and a lightly spicy fruitiness. There is almost no bitterness, and the pH is a touch lower than expected, but it makes for a nice flavor-booster. It has a very light and tingly body, and as the carbonation subsides, the flavor grows. Very refreshing and an easy session brew - a solid example of the style.","mmmbeer","Jan 23, 2011"

A bread and yeast flavor hits the front of the palate, as it reaches the back a mild grassy, with touch of pine bitterness comes through. That bitterness lingers and the taste stays there long after the beer has washed away. A thin watery texture, with the strong feel of carbonation hitting at the halfway point, it continues all the way through till the finish. The beer as a whole is okay, the color is weak and a little lackluster. The scent and taste are true to the style and stay consistent. The feel had a lot more carbonation than I would like.

Nothing really jumped out to much. Compared to the smell, I was actually surprised by the taste. I didn't think I was going to be able to get into this one but once I tasted it I found I enjoyed it.

Started off my drinking night with Dale's Pale Ale, then Green Flash West Coast IPA, and then Boulevard's unfiltered wheat, and this one not only put out the hop fire in my mouth, but it was incredibly delicious. I don't understand all the negative reviews on here, because this one hits the mark with me. I guess that's the beauty of BA -- everyone's tastes are different. I wrote Boulevard and told them of my fondness for its unfiltered wheat and they thanked me for my nice comments. This will be a regular in my beer rotation.

It goes down smooth and easy, so it may be a decent transition beer for some, but I can only tentatively recommend that. This is by far the weakest of Boulevard's year-round beers.

The taste and smell left a lot to be desired, all I got from the bear was the remninse of the lemon on the side of the glass(which I removed), some yeast, and dull wheat. This beer was served at a BBQ restaurant and was served far too cold for good consumption, so I will leave that as a caveat to my initial dislike of the brew (although it would not improve the taste enough to make it rate much higher).

This is definately something that I could (and have done so in the past) drink in massive amounts in the summer time.

The retention is reasonable, a soapy collar forms and no lace gets produced during consumption. The nose does little for me; its wheaty with a little mustiness and splashes of citrus throughout. The potency is very mild and the invitation is subtle. Even though my eyes and nose tells me this is not appealing my mouth tells me otherwise. The palate is a quintessential American Wheat, as insipid as that is. The wheat taste leads with light citrus hints mixed with musty-yeastiness. This is far from a palate stimulator but it is refreshing and easy to drink. It is a cheap alternative that I take advantage of. It is not as crisp as some versions (Anchor Summer Wheat) but more well rounded than others (In-Heat Wheat). Medium-light in body, which is appropriate, low carbonation, natural on the tongue.
