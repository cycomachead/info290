Unfortunately Pomegranate juice is quite expensive, and rarely used to its awesome potential. I mostly smell wheat yeast in the aroma, and the smell is quite mild along with the carbonation. There is a slight redness to the head which is interesting. Pomegranate sits in the back of the sip, mild fruity flavor, slight tartness, that mixes well with wheat yeast estsers that are happening. Aside from that you have an American wheat. Highly drinkable. Refreshing summer beer. I definitely drank this beer offseason. Pretty good though.","mlazzaro","Nov 12, 2010"

Appears a cloudy light golden color with less than a finger of white head that is gone half way through the experience. Aroma smells primarily of wheat with a bit of sulfur and a slight hint of unidentifiable fruit in the back that is most likely the pomegranate's contribution. Taste is mostly wheat with again the same unidentifiable fruity sweetness. However, there is a lingering flavor in your mouth very similar to when/if you chew up the core of a pomegranate seed. Light feel with a moderately high level of carbonation. As it warms a bit more of the pomegranate flavor comes forward and contributes to the sweetness. As a lawnmower beer it is drinkable enough that I could see easily being able to drink a few of these. However, if really looking to sit and enjoy the flavor of a wheat beer, I would most likely pass on this in the future.","stakem","Jun 29, 2010"

I thought it was a decent taste, light-bodied and fluffy with some sweetness coming from the wheat and some fruit flavors.

Drinkability wise I could pass on another of these and I gasp at the thought of a whole twelve pack of this stuff like on the label I saw they're selling it in that format and cans.

The fruit taste does not seem distinctly pommegranate, but provides a dark and savory berry flavor albiet a somewhat processed and bruised character. The afteratste shows some very lightly spicy wheat yeast phenols like clove and bubblegum, as well and a faint light caramel taste. A low but balancing hop bitterness rounds out the sweetness along with the tart fruit and touch of yeasty spice. The sediment particles provide a little more texture to a light body and when matched with a med-high carbonation, a mouthfeel with an acceptable creaminess is achieved. While the overall flavor profile is varied and arguable complex, all the flavors are uniformily mild and some pleasent nuances are so background that the louder fruit character overshadows the tamer yeast and malt notes. The finish is clean and drying and allows a terriffic drinkability because there is no lingering fruit skin or tannic bite- an advantage this beer has over many other fruit beers.","PBRstreetgang","Sep 12, 2007"

2.93,-13.6,4,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Not having much of a pomegranate background, except through Bible references, I took my chance on our deck Memorial evening...my wife tells me they are also called ""Chinese apples"" and are rather expensive...one wonders how Saranac could ""afford"" to brew them into a sampler....pours an effervescent orange/brown haze; fizzing head reduces to small tracings...citrus notes with acidic appeal...all is working for this brew until the chew, which really is like chewing bark or some sort of forest timber...the taste mellows, unchallenging but leaving a lingering juicelike aftertaste...really not my thing, as authentic lambics, guezes and saisons handle the fruit realm with much more authority...","dacrza1","Jun 07, 2007"
3.5,3.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer is surprisingly better than I expected. It pours a slightly cloudy orangy and slightly reddish color with minimal lacing and some head. The smell is definitely sweet. If I didn't know it was pomegranate in there, I would have guessed at some other fruits. The taste is very subtle, sweet, and light, no doubt on the pomegranates and maybe some other slight fruity bits as well. The beer is moderately carbonated, very light on the alcohol, a little more malty than hoppy, but this is clearly a summer time refreshing beer that you could enjoy on a hot day.","albern","Jun 04, 2007"
3.21,-5.3,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Got this one cause it was something I'd never heard of before, so why not. Pours a lighter amber-light brown color, with about a finger of white head on top that dissolves pretty quickly. Nose is very mild, a hint of fruit (grape maybe?) and a touch of wheat. Taste is fairly similar, only a little stronger. Pomegranate - which seems to be a fairly mild, smooth fruit - comes through first, and is pretty tasty. However, aside from some wheat, there's not a lot going on there. Feel is average, medium body. Overall, a good beer to have every once in a while for a change, although its not one I'd want to drink that much.","soupyman10","Jun 03, 2007"
3.32,-2.1,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"D-a decent and refreshing beer for a hot summer afternoon. I probably couldn't have more than a few of these though due to the fruit. If you like ffruit beers this is a good choice. I am noting that the three I have tasted so far are all differenrt variations on the same theme","sleazo","Jun 02, 2007"
3.25,-4.1,3,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Pours a pale color with some lacing. The aroma isn't impressive at first, consisting of some fruitiness mixed in with the malt. The taste is the opposite as there's more of a sweet mix of pomegranate and wheat that seems to interact in some way. The end result is a bit sweet and hard to differentiate. Mind you, I've never had a beer with pomegranate flavors. Not too bad but feels somewhat off-balance.","Brad007","May 30, 2007"

3.31,-2.4,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,4,"Pours a clear light copper with a slight touch of redness. An average white head that did not leave much lacing on the glass. The smell is hard to detect, I really can't pick up anything. The taste has a nice wheat backbone with a nice touch of pomegranate. Though if I didn't know this was a pomegranate brew, I would not be able to tell what fruit flavor it has. The feel is well carbonate crisp and light. A very drinkable summer beer, no offensive or cloying flavors.","Gmann","May 22, 2007"

The taste isn't very strong but the flavors are balanced extremely well. The sweetness doesn't overpower the wheat, or dominate the beer, yet it adds a unique flavor. The mouthfeel is light and smooth, great for a summer beer. This one is a very easy drinker and wouldn't get annoying like some fruit beers after one. Worth checking out. Enjoy.","wingman14","May 20, 2007"

3.95,16.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"This is a very respectable, easy to drink fruit beer. In the same vein as the Boysenberry Wheat offering from Sam Adams (part of the Longshot series), this is better. Flavors of a nice light tongue tingling wheat are coupled with the sweetness of what I can only imagine is fresh pomegranate juice. Neither dominates the other. Rather they come together in harmony for a very enjoyable experience. This is a nice lawnmower ale, perfect, since the weather is starting to turn towards summer.","cbl2","May 12, 2007"

3.48,2.7,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"This beer is from the ""12 Beers of Summer"" pack. The beer pours a hazy gold/orange color with an inch white head which goes away quick. It smells like wheat and a bit of fruit, but the aroma is light. It tastes like wheat and some pomegranate. Luckily the pomegranate flavor is light and not overwhelming, and it's not light enough where you can't taste it, the fruit flavor is done right. Mouthfeel is light and a little bit watery, but it is crisp. Drinkability is good, I could drink a few of these on a hot day. It's a decent, refreshing beer that has just the right amount of fruit flavor to make it good and drinkable.","bluejacket74","May 04, 2007"

3.45,1.8,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Hazy golden orange. Small white head shrinks to a soapy film before too long. Softly fruity aroma dusted with a light sweetness. Reminds me of MH's #9 in its character. Sweet fruitiness sticks to the grainy wheat for a moment before giving way to a lingering cereal quality. Not too sweet or syrupy but, at the same time, not too light or watery. Fairly crisp and just enough flavor to keep things moderately interesting. I see nothing wrong with knocking back a couple of these on a hot day.","wedge","Apr 27, 2007"
3.16,-6.8,4,3,3,3,3.5," This is one of the better offerings from Saranac that I've had, but seeing how I didn't think too highly of their winter selection, that's not saying a whole lot. This is worthy a try for the novelty factor of the pomegranate, and for the relatively cheap price of the 6-pack. Beyond that, it's like most of their other beers - light, watery, and lacking in complexity.","JerzDevl2000","Apr 26, 2007"
3.65,7.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"It pours a light cloudy amber with a little bit of white head that left bits of lace on the glass. The smell has red fruit (obviously), but it's also got some yeastiness and a light herbal hop. Tastes a little candyish up on the front end of the taste, but the tartness of the pomegranate and a dry finish on the beer actually work well to make you want that next sip or that next bottle.","jbsteiny","Beers"

3.67,8.3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Brew pours to a cloudy orange/golden color with a small white head that broke down very quickly and only left a trace of lacing. The aromas seem to be mostly wheat with a sweet smell that I suppose would be the fruit mixing with the malt? The fruit smell to me does not scream pomegranate but is nice, I think what I like the most about it is that it is not in your face, seems to be just playing along with everything. The flavors are also nice, very east drinking with a crisp feel. You pick up a slight wheat flavor, which lead to semi-sweet flavor that seems to be from the juice. No bitterness that I can pick up. I am not usually a fruit beer drinking person, but this brew is not to bad. I can see this being a cheap, easy, refreshing summer brew and I will get this one again  before I tried this brew I thought I would never say that!","Stimack","Apr 14, 2007"
