Taste: out of nowhere this is tart... lactic... which is good because otherwise it would be just cloying undercarbonated pale malt overload. Sugary mango again, then tart jolly rancher finish. Sticky. Sneakily boozy post swallow. This is rough but there's one point in the sip where it's an interesting idea...then a sugar wave hits and it's rough again.

Maybe “Fruit/Vegetable Beer” would be better, or American Wild. Consequently, I’m rating this not to “style” but to whatever the hell impression it makes on me. That being the case, I think this is a fascinating and very enjoyable, even if not transcendent, exploration of style. It’s creative, it’s well-done, it pushes some boundaries but not outrageously so, and it’s memorable for how unique it is if nothing else.","fmccormi","Jul 14, 2014"

Taste is excellent, more sweet than tart but really smooth and the way the taste covers the alcohol makes it crazy easy to drink for the ABV.","JamieDuncan","Jul 08, 2014"

Although this an ageable brew, I would abstain, as I think the balance is remarkable now and think the tartness will gain momentum and become more prominent (i.e. more sour) as time passes. Their anniversary releases are always inventive and well-crafted of which Nineteen continues that trend. Happy Anniversary Weyerbacher and to many more! (4.5)","threeviews","Jun 28, 2014"

3.61,-6.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,3,3.5,"D: Extremely drinkable for a beer at 10%. All over the place with elements of different styles. It looks and feels like a pale ale, with a nice wheat flavor on the finish. You don't get too much hops as you may expect with a pale ale, and there really is no malt backing. It has elements of the Gose and Gueuze styles as well. Interesting beer, but would probably not purchase again.","antott0523","Jun 28, 2014"
