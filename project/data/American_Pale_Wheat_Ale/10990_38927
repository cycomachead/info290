It looks super carbonated. There are aromas of bready malt, orange, and spices. The flavor is bready from the barley and wheat malts. There are mild contributions from the orange peel and the coriander. The hop presence is there, but not strong. The body is light with plentiful carbonation. It is crisp and refreshing. It's the sort of beer that would be very drinkable after being outside on a summer day. This is a good beer, if only a bit standard.","acevenom","May 08, 2012"

3.04,-7.9,4,2.5,3,3,3.5,"This claims to be a summer wheat, so I was expecting a Weizen style, and I expected some added spice as well. The best thing I can say about this is that it is inoffensive. Its sweetness is balanced by a slightly metallic zing. The orange flavor doesn't show as an orange-peel or essence--maybe it is folded into the sweetness. It has almost no wheat characteristics; it really looks like a lager in the glass, only faintly rusty; no conventional "native" wheat spiciness or fruitiness, and the added spice is nondescript. This beer reminds me of Shiner Bock--it shares that beer's somewhat papery overtone. It suggests a beer like Shiner also in that it comes from a nominally quirky brewery that is obviously trying not to startle people used to mainstream beers. These guys need to take the governor off their system and really make a Weizen-style with corriander and orange. It sounds good.","heine1","Mar 23, 2011"

The smell is of a saison that was brewed with a poor choice of spices and the taste is even worse. This beer is vegetal and it shouldn't be if it were done correctly. If someone had asked me what this beer had been brewed with I would have been tempted to answer "celery". Any sweetness or bitterness from any traditional ingredients is loss in the effort to block the vegetal taste from your tongue, but it's not easy. Still, there is a mild sweetness from the light malts, but no bitterness from the hops. I rarely pour a beer, but this one had to go and I also left behind 5 bottles form the six-pack for the next person to get the hotel room. I hope they have the good sense to pour it too.","Naugros","Aug 04, 2010"

Lots of grapefruit with some bitterness to the finish. Some spiciness as well. Mouthfeel is crisp and fairly thin. Drinkability is solid.

Taste is very summer-like, nice spicing, hint of coriander, banana and orange zest. Good mouthfeel, not over carbonated. Tastes perfect on this 88 degree day. Taste is consistant throughout.
