3.75,19,,,,,,"Pours a golden-yellow in color with a small white head. Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is what would be excepted which is of sweet wheat grains for the most part. Pretty much the same for the taste with a very light dry finish. Different than other similar brews and close to the 'Goose Island '312 urban Wheat'. Lighter-bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall, this is a decent brew.","BeerWithMike","Nov 03, 2014"

AROMA: somewhat pungent, lemon dish detergent scent; some lager malts provide a backbone; slightest banana and apple... PALATE: medium-bodied slightly effervescent; almost sudsy in its aftertaste--fizzy...TASTE: such subtle flavors--lightly lemon; predominantly metallic ping akin to a pilsner; lacking a refreshing, clean drag--just dragging... OVERALL: I understand the attempt is a wheat ale, but Wheat Monkey straddles the styles without pulling the better elements of either into my mouth; instead, it's more like monkeying around, making use of a playful label and silly enough name to attract attention--by far the weakest of what was a successful mix pack...","dacrza1","Jan 21, 2014"

2.95,-6.3,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,3,"I feel that giving this beer an average rating is a bit generous. The cloudy orange color and white cap looked good but the almost complete lack carbonation seemed peculiar. The aroma had some orange and lemon on top of the wheat which was light. The taste was unimpressive, the wheat and citrus seemed thin to the point I could almost taste the water. Thin, we has it. I have had several similar brews that were better examples of the style and just plain more enjoyable.","DesMoinesMike","Apr 08, 2011"
3.28,4.1,3,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,"The mouthfeel is quite good, it's well-carbonated and pretty light. The drinkability, of course, is quite good. It's a pale wheat ale, if it's not drinkable, something's terribly wrong. Overall a pretty good pale what, nothing outstanding but perfectly serviceable with an excellent aftertaste.","shand","Mar 26, 2011"
2.88,-8.6,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,3,"Generally, I prefer Jethro Tull's "Steel Monkey", but I'll still give this beer a shot. It pours a clear somewhat pale straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises wheat and sweet flowers, both of which come through rather meekly. The taste converts the wheat into corn and sweetens things up decidedly. The flowers still come through, though, meek as ever. The body is a hefty-leaning light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, a kind of sad PWA, really one-dimensional in the wrong direction.","TMoney2591","Mar 05, 2011"

I smelled a little bit of banana, but it didn't necessarily come out in the taste. I don't like wheat beer that features coriander, and I did not pick that up in this one. This didn't have an odd complexity that some wheat beers have, so I am counting that a plus. It was light bodied and easy drinking. I very publicly do not like wheat beer, but this is a good find for something different.","beerdown77","Jan 04, 2011"

It has a decent wheat flavor to it but it is way too thin. Definetly needs more volume too it because it is just way too simple.

2.61,-17.1,3.5,2.5,2,4,3,"Poured very nicely with a great golden hue. Very complex taste that accompanies the standard wheat flavor. Could be a hint of clove.

2.68,-14.9,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Overall: As I said above, this is the weakest Lakefront offering I've had. Also, this style can vary dramatically, but there are way too many other great American Pale Wheats out there for me to ever come back to this one specifically.","soze47","Aug 24, 2010"
3.5,11.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pure white two-finger head, medium dissipation with minimal lacing over straw yellow a bit cloudy body, multiple streams of carbonation rising from bottom of glass. Nose is clean wheat, evidently a bit of wheat malt, some fruitiness. Taste mirrors nose, clean but pretty nondescript, faint bit of bitterness on the back end. Thinnish mouthfeel, which I would expect for this style, decent effervescence. At this ABV this is pretty drinkable. I think this may have been the new recipe trumpeted on brewery's website, so it may be an improvement over the (BA lambasted) version. It's not Widmer Hefe (which apparently BAs aren't too fond of, try it on tap at the brewery), but it ain't that bad.","jdense","Aug 20, 2010"

The aroma is muted, really just has a touch of light peach fruit, maybe some artificial sugar. The taste is really terrible. Has a budweiser corn taste to it that is gross. Almost tastes like keystone light that you threw up. Has the gross stomach acid taste to it. Might be the worst tasting beer i have had to date. I actually prefer warm keystone light to this. Mouthfeel is gross. too flat, too light, too bland and way to off for a wheat beer. Drinkability is not good either. Highest score in this category because its light and low abv, other than that you need to aviod this fucker.","Augustiner719","Jun 29, 2010"

It has a light pale and wheat malt flavor along with a dry, citrusy finish. It's not overly tasty or complex and it does have an off-putting musty character. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with too much carbonation. This is a forgettable wheat beer. It's light, but lacking flavor and is full of flaws.","WesWes","Nov 25, 2009"

No head to speak of, but the lacing was pretty nice. I couldn't catch much in the scent. Just a faint smell of wheat. Disappointing. For a beer that looked so light, this has a surprisingly nice body to it. Unfortunately, the body didn't have a taste to match. It was pretty bland, with just a hint of wheat and fruit. Last night I had this on tap at the brewery and it was much better then it was bottled. I rated the taste a little bit higher, just because I wonder if I got an older batch in these bottles.","billyzoom666","Jul 28, 2009"
