"Amazing flavor for such low abv."
""
"Drank from the bottle. Could tell it was a pale ale from the smell/taste. Didn't realize it was a wheat variant at first, although subconsciously I knew it from the name. A little thinner than I would expect from either a pale ale or a wheat ale. Still, a good, drinkable beer. Wish I could say more, but wasn't really prepared to take notes or inclined to think about it really hard. And then, as I said, straight from the bottle, so not much for looks or aroma. Would like to try again some time so I can update my review."

"One of those beers that you have to get your hands on."
"Malty soft nose with a generous dose fruit and hint of hop. The mouthfeel is smooth and sweet and really full, with pleasant mango hops and a clean, long candy finish."
""
"Three Floyd's staple.... I'm very lucky to live in an area where I can find this almost anytime I want.  If only I could say the same for it's cousin Zombie Dust.... But no complaints, this beer is amazing in its own right."

"Great pine aroma. Lemony hop flavor, but the malt bill seemed lacking. Not my favorite."
"My favorite beer! Smooth taste. Good character."
""
""
"When people say this is a session beer, they mean it. I was lucky enough to get a 6 pack of this, and as much as I would've loved to save it and enjoy it throughout the weekend...I have to admit, I blew through all six in an evening. It's delicious, amazing, and very easy to drink. I'd be buying this constantly if it were readily available."

"Awesome session beer... wish I could get this more often"

"This is a crisp wheat beer that is very heavy on the lemony hops. Its quite refreshing and would have better served me on a hot summer day."

""
"Perfect head retention hence 5 stars for look."
""
""

"Very refreshing, great beer to have around for any occasion"
"The best wheat beer I've ever had! They have set the bar very high in my opinion! None have come close since the first taste 2 years ago."
""
""
"This is some pretty good beer."
"Extremely refreshing summer beer. Wonderful Amarillo hop aroma. Slightly aggressive bittering for the style. Very enjoyable session beer!"

"2/3 - Monk's Pub (Downtown Chicago). I had this draft beer at Monk's pub. The smell, taste and feel were very strong. Not a very strong beer by way of alcohol content, but I really enjoyed the flavor. I ordered a second and was very pleased with both beers.I highly recommend- Great Job 3 Floyds!!!"

"Comfortable beer to have, anytime."
""
""
""
""
"Appearance 5, Aroma 4, Flavor 4, Palate 4.5, Overall 4.25"
""
""
""
""
"With the Amarillo hops tastes more of a pale than wheat. That is good for hop heads. Lite flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"At times is overrated around here, which is a shame..It gets built up to be just something its not. Its not earth shattering but it is a damn good beer"
"Like a sweet pale ale. Different and good. Not great for my palate."
""
""
""
"Not what I was expecting but still very good.  Seems more of a wheat pale ale rather than a pale wheat ale (if that makes any sense at all). An instant favorite."

"Tried and true. A reliable brew."

"one of the best session beers i have ever had!! great taste a pleasent earthy wheat taste just right amount snap at the end from the hops..a very well ballanced beer. i love this brew. sampled on tap and 12oz bottles far to many times than i want to admit.."
"I tried this recently in a pint glass that was poured fresh from a tap. For some reason it was significantly better than what I tried from bottles previously. I  enjoyed this beer and would definitely recommend it."
"Perfect. Nuff said. You can't find another beer at this level in this style. I have had a lot of different beers and none really get close to the quality of this beer. Makes sense why it is hard to find."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I love this beer.  Picked it up expecting it to taste like most wheat beers, lacking any real sustenance.  I could not have been more wrong.  What a refreshing beer for me, but also for the industry that I think is lacking in experimental wheat brews.  The Amarillo hops are very apparent and the after taste proves it."

"Taste of grapefruit with a hoppy finish."
""
""
""
"Perfect amber, fluffy white foam. Ripe orange/lime zest, fruity pebbles, cut grass. Over the top citrus hop, subdued body, and great finish."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, does it live up to the hype? I'm not sure. This is an amazing beer but Lagunitas really gives them a run for the money with their Sumpin' line. Nonetheless a very good brew that every beer geek needs to try."
""
"A really interesting beer for me as it is not what I would consider a standard wheat beer.  It has the same notes as a wheat as well as a beautiful hoppy punch at the end to ramp up the flavor profile.  Really nice and deliciously drinkable!"

"12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Clear golden color with minimal head.  Modest lacing. Hoppy aroma but not overpowering. Smooth start with pine/hop/pepper presence at back end. Crisp and light mouthfeel. Overall an excellent session beer."

"Can't say I've had any other American Pale Wheats, but GumballHead takes the cake."

""

"I was so excited to try this based on my inability to obtain this locally, and the reviews on BA. It was my favorite hoppy wheat, but didn't live up to the hype imho."
"Outstanding, the hops make this beer delicious, with an irresistible aroma and a sweet psychedelic look and feel."
""

"I've tried numerous ""Wheats", this is the only one I drink over-and-over again!  Superb!"

"It's a summer day out on your back porch. If one of these is in a glass and 3 more are in your cooler you will be a happy camper. Hoppy for a wheat ale, which i personally love, with a great 3Floyds nose. I find that my non beer guests always enjoy this so it is a great party beer."

"This American Wheat is a fantastic summer beer, refreshing and easy to drink.  The nose on this beer is amazing as are most Three Floyds beers...the Amarillo hops shine through both in the aroma and taste.  This beer pours golden and slightly cloudy with a light fluffy white head.  I don't review beers that suck and I won't start now, outstanding AW that is worth a try if you can get your hands on some."

"Pours a nice golden color with a small amount of cloudiness. head is no more than a finger and disappates very quickly with no visible lacing. Aroma is very hoppy and lemony. Taste is definately hop, grapefruit and a touch of well balanced sweetness. Flavor hits right up front and leaves very quickly mid swallow. Hardly any aftertaste or lingering hop bitterness. Carbonation is moderate and feels good on the palate. Expecting more but am very pleased with my first taste of FFF."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Definitely not really a flavor powerhouse here, but really instead, a quite crisp and refreshing tasting brew.  It has just enough herbal and grassy hop to give it life, but not too much to keep it from being refreshing."

"Got four of these in a trade with Remobsu. My first BA trade. Was totally psyched to try this brew, but ultimately was disappointed. Nose was less than I expected, but dug the cloudy golden yellow pour. First sip tasted quite odd. Was it the Amarillo hops? Second sip more of the same.. Really hard to describe but the taste was not familiar. Not horrible, but did not live up to the hype for me."
""
""
""

"Overall, by no means a revelation, but a real go to brew that you could drink volumes of if you were in that kind of mood."

"O: great brew, slight hoppy makes this wheat brew stand out, fantastic aroma"
""
""
"Similar to Sweet Action, though doesn't taste as hoppy to me.  I'm glad I can only seem to find it once a month as I'd probably drink it every day.  Definitely my favorite in its style."

"Overall- All the FFF hoppy beers I've had (with the exception to ZD) have powerful/beautiful noses but lack in flavor a bit. Great beer, but no Zombie dust."

"O: A simple concept wonderfully executed. Exactly matches my preferences for low bitterness, restrained hopping, and mild wheat sweetness. It's between a wheat and an IPA, I guess they can't appease both camps ('this IPA is weak!' 'this wheat has too much hops!'). All said and done, a great, easily repeatable beer."

"O: This is the ideal for a refreshing beer. Beautiful merger of a pale ale and wheat beer. Very Amarillo-centric and it makes sense with that big fruit flavor! Happy to have had this with such a fresh born on date!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

" Overall a very well deserved 4.25 for Gumballhead from Three Floyds Brewing Co. & Brewpub. Now I see why this became on demand for year-round supply as opposed to seasonal release. This is the best of the two dominant wheat styles I've had. I implore you to get your hands on this! I will buy this brew again, best believe it!"
"Gumballhead brewed by Three Floyds Brewing Co. & Brewpub with an ABV of 5.6% This brew pours out a nice cloudy amber color with a thick white head. This brew is an unfiltered brew it is cloudy. The smell is rich with citrus. You pick up on orange, lemon, and lime. There is also a spice to this brew. The taste is smooth and rich with a bitterness at the end . Gumballhead is a nice, balanced brew. Three Floyds Brewing Co. & Brewpub did a nice job with this brew. Mouthfeel is clean and relishing. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out of 5. I would get this brew again."
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is smoother and a bit more oily than other wheat beers -- I might like to see a tiny bit more crispness -- but it works nicely in this brew. Not too weak in ABV either."

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I may be going crazy, but this tastes a lot different than I remember. Gumballhead used to be a love it or hate it beer because of some big unique flavors. It seems like a watered down version of what it used to be... say it isn't always going to be like this."
""
""
""
"O: Not much bang for the swallow. Someone suggested the bottle wasn't fresh. Hopefully I'll get a better bottle next time. This is the only 3 Floyds that's let me down."

""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: A good, but not outstanding beer. Probably the best of its style, but again, doesn't really stand out too much"
""
""

"O - Great beer that I feel it quite overlooked by other FFF hoppy offerings. It's definitely worth seeking out."

"This is one of my favorite beers! It has a golden orange pour with a white head. Strong hops and citrus fruit are detected in the aroma with lemons and tangerines. The taste is how it smells with some peach. It is crisp, smooth and light! Great with all different kinds of foods!"

""
""
""

""

""

"O - This is an outstanding beer and easily one of the best wheats i've ever had. Most people shy away from wheat beers because of the blue moon's and hoegaardens, which in my opinion give wheats a bad name. This is a perfect example of what the style is capable of. A go to in warm summer days or when you crave something light but packed with flavor. Very surprised at the somewhat average/low rating by the bros."

"O - solid hoppy wheat beer. I see the catch and draw many have toward this beer. I'll buy it more often, but it's not a regular pick-up for me."
""
"Golden-yellow color with nice clarity, with a foamy white head that retained as a ringlet, leaving patchy lacing on the glass. Grassy aroma, somewhat floral, with light notes of citrus and toasted wheat. The taste is, again, grassy, leafy, herbal, floral, very light notes of citrus pith, the malt bill bringing in toasted wheat and grain husks. Herbal finish with a nicely drying bitterness. Light-medium body with a moderate carbonation. Comes across almost like an APA, which is a good thing. Drinks nicely and pairs with pretty much whatever you're doing."
""
""
""
""
"O - Wheat and pale ale makes for an interesting and unique flavored beer. I would take a good pale ale or a good wheat beer over this combo, but it's still a good beer that is worth a try if you like either of those styles. Prost!"

"My favorite wheat beer because it is not your typical wheat beer. Excellent smells of fruit and wheat all at once, the taste is even better. Lots of wheat flavor, but with the attitude of a pale ale. Good head and lacing for a lighter offering. Highly recommend this one to any beer drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was my first try at American Hoppy Wheat beers. Wow, what an eye opener. The appearance is a very clear pale orange/yellow color, small white head. The smell is all fruit: orange, peach and tangerine. I really like the fact that those flavors are not the only thing you get, this is a well integrated wheat beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was unimpressed with this one. The taste was very unbalanced and awkward, especially mid-swallow and after swallowing. The wheat seems to have thinned the beer and added weird astringent tastes rather than being used to build body and soft banana esters. I would like to see this one unfiltered and more like a hopped up Oberon, 312 Urban Wheat, or witbier. Disappointed."
""
""
""
"Gumballhead definitely pushes the limits of an American pale wheat ale. Although I typically love all types of extreme beers, I wish that this one had more wheat character and was truer to the style."

"I really don't care for wheat ales, but I will try any Three Floyds beer I can get my hands on. This is hands down the best wheat beer I've ever had. Nice and hoppy and it doesn't have that minty aroma/taste most wheat ales have. I would recommend this to anybody, but especially people like me who typically don't enjoy wheat ales. This one is truly a cut above the rest."

"I am not a wheat beer fan, and was hesitant to get many of these, but I was quite surprised. 3F never disappoints. Really great beer, drinkable, and would like to try it once the weather gets a little warmer. The hop presence is there but not overwhelming. Will definitely look to get some more of these in the near future."

"Overall doesnt taste anything like a traditional wheat beer. I really dig it. Obviously, the freshness helped!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours up golden, no lacing, small white head. Aromas of grapefruit, lemon peel, a lil peach. Taste is same as nose, grassy hops up front, white pepper, a crisp hefeweizen yeast. Doesn't taste too traditional. Clean finish, non aggressive carbo, light leaning medium body. Very tasty brew."
""
""
""
"Wow, IMO this is Three Floyds best beer, having had a bunch of them, none of them and that includes Zombie Dust an Alpha King hold a candle to this masterpiece of a beer!"
""
""
""
""
"This was my first FFF over three years ago. I still buy it in abundance to this day. The best wheat pale produced today. At one time I couldn't find Gumball Head and a store clerk told me to try a Lil Sumpin Sumpin-absolutely not the same and pales (excuse the pun) by comparison."
""
"O: Good wheat beer, very good use of hops, I enjoyed this but wouldn't go out of my way to trade for it."
""
""
"I may be a bit partial to Gumballhead, it is a top 5 beer for me. I had this on tap that they only had 22 ounce drafts (I was not complaining) It poured a pretty clear but smooth appearance, also noted a little head formed. The aroma is phenomenal, a very hop-forward yet APA scent. Obviously being three floyds the hops will definitely be prevalent and with Gumballhead they did not disappoint. Overall, I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Any time any restaurant has it on draft I will be purchasing."

""

"Finally got my hands on this one thanks to Rebekah. Thanks!! Bottle pours a mostly clear golden or light orange with a massive fluffy white head on top. Lots of lacing on the glass as the head recedes. Aroma is sweet lemony, grassy hops, malt sweetness and honey, peaches, then some floral potpourri. This smells like hop candies. Flavor is big lemon hops with a lightly sweet malt backbone and some peachy character. This has a big time punch of flavor and the floral lemon flavors longer on the palate. Very light bodied, a bit of slickness, and high carbonation. I can see why people love this one. Super quaffable and lots of flavor. Nicely balanced between the hops and malts. Might be one of the best beers for drinking a 6-pack that I have had."

"I was very pleased to be able to try this while visiting Indiana. Couldn't stop at just one big 22oz. pour, had to have another."
""
""
"Clear yellow color beneath a small, pure-white head. Aroma is lemony along with other bright, fruity hop characteristics I remember from past Three Floyds beers. Colorful and resinous with a quality pale malt and wheat presence. Deliciously hoppy in the flavor as well...oily lemon, black tea, apricot, a little piney greenness. This just makes me sad all over again that I can't regularly get this or Alpha King where I live. Light and crushable with some dryness on the tongue. Pretty sure I could drink this in vast quantities."
"Golden tangerine color, fluffy white head, good head retention, and some spotty lace. Aroma is lemon zesty, orange candy, fruit, caramelly, and wheaty. Taste is sweet, tangy, fruity, grassy, and lemony. Soft, dry bitterness lingers. Mouthfeel is juicy with some powdery grit. A very pleasant wheat beer and easy to enjoy."
""
""
""
""
"O- A solid beer but was a bit let down. With a name like Gumballhead and being a wheat beer, I expected more of a hefe-weizen quality to it."

"Old review: This poured a golden tan color. And by god—I smell bubblegum! It’s a light aroma but it’s definitely “gummy”. The flavor is hop forward with a pronounced full frontal assault… and then it turns into this smooth wheat beer finish. Coriander? Check. Orange peel? Check. And that oddly strange bubble-gum character? Check. It’s an easy drinking, hoppy wheat beer but it just didn’t do it for me."

"Kudus to 3 Floyds for taking a chance and winning with it."
""
""
"O - Very easy drinking beer. Perfect for a summer afternoon."
""
""
""
""
"Solid American wheat beer. Very hoppy as befits a Three Floyds beer. The only thing that separates this from an IPA is that nice floral sweetness with some type of semi-sharp spices contributing.. not quite bubble gum or cloves that you get out of a German hefeweizen, but its more of a short, to the point, sharp floral flavour. Good shelf beer, worth buying on a fairly regular basis if you like hops."
""
""
""
"Pours light amber with a 1 finger off white head. Lots of citrus in the nose, also a strong brown sugar note. Very balanced aroma, more of an IPA less of a wheat. The taste is very good, lots of citrus balanced with the malt. The bitterness only slightly outweigh the sugary malt. This is one of the most balanced pale ales I've had in a long time. Pair that with the light ABV and you got a winner. If only it was more readily available."

""

"Taste has a really nice citrusy flavor to it, but not overly bitter. It's a punch in the mouth for sure, but in a good way. It has a great soft, semi-sweet wheat character to it on the finish that really makes this a beer of two phases....brilliantly citrusy, then sweet and full of wheat. Yum. A great example of a hoppy wheat beer."

"This is the weaker lil' bro of Zombie Dust and I love it! Basically Zombie Dust light. The artwork is so raw it's fantastic. Did a child or mental patient design it, not an insult as I'm pretty much both. Very fun to track down in stores as well. This little brewery is something else. Yay-Yuhh!!!"

"Pours a nice clear golden color with one finger white head. Good lacing. Smell is citrus up front, much more like an IPA than a wheat. The taste follows the nose - sweet citrus with a very refreshing hefeweizen-like lemony finish. Light bodied and lightly carbonated, very refreshing. Overall an outstanding American wheat, extremely well balanced. Great job FFF!"

"O – This is a very, very well-done beer. It fits the style to a tee, is very tasty, and insanely drinkable. Like I said before, I’m not sure how they fit all the hop aromas and flavors in without giving this thing some inappropriately high bitterness, but it’s good news for everyone that they did. I’ve always been interested in how an American pale wheat ale had such a high score on a site where DIPAs and BA stouts rule the roost and now I know why – it’s simply a great beer. This was my first Three Floyds beer and I’d LOVE to try more. Thank you SO much for the opportunity to try this one, Jared!"

"One of the best beers that I have had in my life. It is a very smooth beer that tastes good as well. I hope everyone gets to try this in their lifetime. It is hard to get as it is rare to see in many liquor stores except for maybe once a month in some. There is a really nice beer bar in my college town that cycles through most of these top 250 beers a lot, but it's still hard to come by."

"Overall - Honestly, I expected better. This is good; I was expecting excellent. Good balance, but ultimately I felt it too one-dimensional. If I were in the mood for a hoppy wheat, I'd opt for a Lagunitas Lil' Sumpin Sumpin over this. I'm glad I traded for it, but it's unlikely I'd do that again."

"O - I've had this from a bottle and this review was taken off the 2nd time I had it from a growler poured fresh. I have to say this pour does not do this ale justice and ill have to track down a few bottles to get the review across. I'm not going to sit here and pound this ale as if I didn't enjoy it nor am I going to rip the girl that did the fill. But I'm not going to pretend like I loved it either bc its one of my go to breweries. This Is a very good pale wheat ale and one of the best. The problem is its a subpar style. It has all the right qualities to being the best pale wheat ale in the world as I'm sure a bottled version or a proper fill would have shined. I'm sure ill re-review this here soon with better results."
"Sweet but never too hoppy, Gumball head is a great beer for those who want something full-bodied but don't want too be overwhelmed by hops. It's lighter in color and finishes well. Great on draught and very drinkable. The cool character on the tapper is a nice touch as well."

"Overall, Three Floyds makes some of the better six pack beers available. Don't expect anything like a typical wheat beer when trying Gumballhead: it blurs the lines of wheat beer and American IPA, yet the end result is a interesting blend that is overall satisfying and recommended."

This beer is smooth, flavorful, and still refreshing."

"This is another winner from FFF, and one that I'm glad they make year-round. This is not as boozy or pungent as ZD, nor as syrupy or chewy as AK, but somehow it falls right in between, with the wheat malts making this stand out a bit more. Absolutely an excellent beer for the warmer weather, but this could work for any time of the year. Considering it's one of their tamer offerings, it's still chock-filled with fruity flavors and crispness that makes it a highly drinkable offering. I could have these all night if I needed to. A premier American wheat offering."
""
"Pours a crystal clear medium golden color with a huge fluffy white head that persists forever. Holy hop Batman, I wasn't expecting such an aroma from this. Earthy pine and grapefruit atop a solid base of bready and spicy malts. The flavor is pine and resin atop a spicy yeasty earthy wheat base. Lingering spicy hoppy finish long after each sip. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet resinous mouthfeel. Wow, now that's a wheat beer. Mild phenols don't distract my sensitive palette and the hop flavor and aroma makes this quite interesting."

"red wheat beer, not as common a style as it should be, and this one is executed well. thanks to claystation for this one, what a champion he is! this pours a slightly hazy sunset red color, pale, with almost two inches of off white head with lovely lacing. the nose is quite hoppy for a wheat beer, which is welcomed. citrus aroma on that, with a slightly sweet red malt base, the what makes the whole thing feel summery. flavor is interestingly hop forward. oranges and lemon zest are detectable, and the wheat malt is unique in the sense that it has some real oomph to it, really flavorful and not lost in the hoppy shuffle this beer has going. yeast is not the standard hefe stuff I expected it to be, but a mildly peppery soft flavored strain that lets the other flavors do most of the talking. finish is balanced, but bitterness does dial up a bit. excellent carbonation and a medium body that makes this much more of a beer drinkers beer than some others. three floyds gets so much hype from the beer community, sometimes I think their stuff doesn't live up to it very well, but this is a fine example of twisting a style to be something else entirely, and its outstanding. this one is worthy of the praise."
""
""
""
""
"O: Some of the most pronounced, yet smooth and balanced hop flavours I have tasted in a beer. I could drink this all night!"
"O: This is a great beer. My main gripe with it would be that I don't think it's true to style. It's missing that dry finish that a good wheat should have. However, like I said, this is a great beer, just not necessarily to style."

"Not sure that this is typical of pale wheat ales and that's probably why I like it more that the others I've tried in the style. A lot of flavor is packed in this relatively small package. Sweet, crisp, refreshing and easy drinking. If I ever decide to start the whole ""session"" thing, this would certainly become a go-to."

"This is a quality beer from the Floyds that would appease those that are not hop-heads. Gumballhead continues to be one of my favorites."

"D - Considering this is a style that seems to consistently disappoint, this brew was pretty tasty. It certainly doesn't have the same zesty and refreshing character that most wits and hefes have, but it isn't marketed as those either. As far as APWA's go, this was a solid brew, but it begs the question, is this an APWA at all? It's a little hoppy for the style, but it's also the most enjoyable of the style I've had."
"O: This is a great pale wheat ale; nice hop flavor and easy drinking malt character; this might be one of the top ""summer beers"" I can think of - would love to have access to this in SC. For a style that's usually not too exciting, this is pretty tasty."

"Overall: This beer shows the fundamental differences between American and European wheat beers. I had a Weinhenstephaner Hefeweissbier before this one and its hard to tell they are basically the same style. Hops are accented much more then the yeast in the European style. Easy to see why this is the flagship beer by Three Floyds, easily drinkable which gives it an overall commercial appeal."

"Had the second of the two Gumballhead that I was able to get. Pours a nice yellowish orange with an OK head. The smell is phenomenal. I'm a sucker for a sweet hoppy smell that is headed up with an abundance of citrus notes. The taste is very good as well. The citrus gets you up front followed by a relatively smooth hoppy finish. The only negative to say is that it doesn't go far enough with the citrus and hops. No doubt this is a very good beer that I would get again though."

"Gumballhead is one of my favorite beers. It is very hard to find in the Indianapolis area but when I do find it I buy it. Highly recommended as it is a very drinkable beer and one that if you offer it to your friends they will really appreciate it and trust your beer judgement."

"Wow, this is a wheat beer? Sure fooled me, this beer smells and tastes like a perfectly balanced IPA to me! Drinkability is outstanding on this one, sessionable... yes! Smells like pineapple, grapefruit and citrus. Taste is just as good as the aroma, hardley notice the wheat at all, and for me that is a good thing. I would recommend this to everybody who can get it."

"O- very nice beer for what it is. Definitely prefer zombie dust over this but a nice light, crisp citrus beer."
""
""
""
"D - This'd make a great session beer. I find myself wanting more of the hops, though. Not entirely complex, but it doesn't need to be. I'd definitely have it again."

"The taste is as one dimensional as the scent. Strong piney hops with an underlying of floral hoppiness, there is very little else. Im expecting orange, lemon or grapefruit and taste nothing but piney resins. Despite the use of Amarillo hops I get a progressive muskiness which seems uncharacteristic."
""
"Overall Drinkability: Excellent combination of an IPA, a hef, and light wheat ale or lager. I wish it would push the envelope a bit regarding the flavors, but I will definitely get this again."

"My wife's family had a weekend planned in the Windy City and since my Dodgers were in town to face the Cubs it was the perfect opportunity to take the kids to a ball game. Beautiful weather, a couple of beers, the smell of stale piss, and hot dogs, made for a great day. Towards the end of the game my brother-in-law, Clem, asked if I would be interested in hitting a few bars around Wrigleyville. He was familiar with the area, and I wasn't, so we got the ok from the rest of the family and started our wonderful beer journey. We hit up Goose Island and then went to what is known as an Iowa bar?, Merkles (www.merkleschicago.com). Seeing a sign advertising $3 draws of Dogfish Head Aprihop made it a relatively easy decision. Anyway... after a few Aprihops I decided to try Gumballhead, this was before 3 Floyds blew up as a brewery, and I was blown away by it! Calling it an American-wheat is kind of misleading as this beer packs a pretty amazing hop punch, not much wheat present in this beer, maybe a bit on the palate at the end of the beer, but I don't care, this a very drinkable, thirst quenching, brew."
""
""
""
""
"Light carbonation on the pour. Lots of piney notes on the nose and palate, that linger the longest with the aftertaste. Very easy drinking and enjoyable, do have to admit (only slightly) I preferred sumpin sumpin. Another great brew from FFF. Cheers"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Real easy to drink. Feels light. Low ABVs. Both wheat and hops combine really well. Carbonation gives a nice pop on the tongue. Would rate it higher but not a whole lot of smell. Regardless- very fine brew by FFF"
""
"Body is medium-light with carbonation levels that are moderately high, leading to a mouthfeel that is at first briefly fizzy, then quickly becoming foamy and smooth. Finishes semi-dry, with little stickiness on the palate."

"Taste/feel: It's likely just because of the name, and I know I'm drinking it, but I honestly feel like I get some bubblegum flavors out of this beer -- there's a lot of fruity hops at the front of the tongue, and then the wheat comes through on the finish. Maybe that bubblegum flavor is just the peach coming through, but I can pretend what I want! Anyway, just an awesomely refreshing beer without much bitterness. Any state that gets this beer shipped to them should consider themselves extremely lucky, as this would make for an ideal session beer... I'd drink it just about daily in the summer."

"Overall, there is a reason people living near me in the Hoosier state clamor for this beer. It lives up to expectations and is an extremely smooth and satisfying beer. The sum of the parts is definitely greater than the whole with this beer. Perfect for the beer drinker who likes wheat beers and is looking to transition to pale ales and IPA's."
""
"O- a moderately high hop session beer."
""
""
""
"O- I love this beer. This really has a decent complexity with not an overbearing amount of hops. I'm a malt guy and really enjoyed all that this has to offer. I don't know if this batch was better than my last one but it tasted so good."

"the beer pours a straw yellow with a wispy white head that fades quickly. the nose is slightly musty with some citrus and mango that doesn't pop like I'd expected. the beer drinks like a champ with a healthy amount of juicy citrus fruit, just like I expected, and some a modest malty backbone. the mouthfeel is sweet and juicy with a semi-dry finish. I'd love to try this beer fresh, but its held up pretty well."
"This beer is a very refreshing lighter beer with a distinct hop smell and flavor. It is golden yellow with a white that has good retention (most likely from the wheat in the beer). It is very aromatic for a light beer and has a floral and citrusy smell. The first taste will tell you that it is highly hopped, but what makes this beer so good is that they are late addition hops. This is not an overly bitter beer and the majority of the hop is in the smell and flavor. It finishes cleanly and is best served by the pitcher. Great beer to try!"
""
"In the interest of legitimating this review, I just tried Zombie Dust and found it slightly overrated (though certainly very good); this, on the other than, deserves the attention it gets. Anyway, believe the hype."

"The smell of citus hops, regular hops, Best wheat beer around never matched, i could drink this beer all day i love it one of my favorites, the red rye is yummy and the pale and hops add a great bitterness to the beer smooth and could drink all day cheers to gumball"

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass; no bottle dating, but was purchased recently. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense white head with excellent retention, that reduces to a nice cap that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass, with some good streaming carbonation. Aromas of pineapple, grapefruit, lemon zest, orange zest, floral, pine, herbal, grass, and wheat. Damn nice aromas with good strength and hop/malt balance and complexity. Taste of pineapple, grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, grass, pine, wheat, and herbal spiciness. Fair amount of floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, citrus zest, floral, grass, pine, wheat, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice amount of hop flavor and good complexity and balance; zero cloying flavors on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming on the finish. Overall this is an excellent pale wheat beer. Very nice hop flavor with good balance and complexity; extremely smooth and easy to drink. A highly enjoyable sessionable offering for sure."

"O-a delicious wheat ale with great balance, nice session beer"
""

""
""
""
""
""
"Very interesting flavor! It begins with a nice cereal-like graininess to it, and breaks way into flowers, lemon, lime, and bread. The finish is a bit peppery, like rye was used in making this beer. Very interesting, and it hits on all points. It's has a nice body, more full than expected, with moderate, smooth carbonation. It is crisp, smooth, and satisfying."

"Body is medium light; carbonation is medium, feel is crisp and smooth, lively without being fizzy. An easy drinking, quenching session brew great for a hot day or paired with a pizza dinner!"
"O - I love hop bombs, stouts and sours but I give alot of love to American Pale Wheat's. This one has been on the want's list from the beginning of my craft beer obsession and when I finally got it I was afraid it wasn't going to live up it's top ranking, but that simply wasn't the case. This beer is truly in a league all it's own. Do your self a favor, get one and enjoy it."

"I really didn't know what to expect from this, but it's just delicious. It sort of tastes like a sessionable version of little sumpin. It pours a pale straw color. The smell is just sweet wheat. Super sweet. Very light body. I could take down a whole bunch of these. Will seek out again. Well done. My first FFF beer did not disappoint."

"O: I normally don't like plain wheat ales, unless they're hoppy. This fits said criteria nicely, so it's plain to see that I enjoy this a whole lot. This was my first from FFF, and needless to say, it lived up to the hype for me. I would drink the shit out of this in hot weather - if only I didn't live in Maryland..."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is in my top 3 favorite beers. Wheat beer helped me get into craft beer and this a perfect breakaway. You get the wheat beer name I used to love plus the hops and flavors lacking in a lot of wheat beers. Its more like a Wheat IPA. If you can find this I definitely recommend getting a case of it. You wont regret it."

"Glad I tried this - swung by a bottle shop in Porter IN to get this on my way back from Chicago."

""
""
""
"O - This beer is one of my favorite summer thirst quenchers. Fantastic taste and very drinkable. Very well done!"
"O: Overall, Im not impressed.  I know its a summer style, and its meant to be crisp and refreshing, but it falls short in both aroma and flavor for me.  The wheat presence is not heavy, which I could happily deal with if the hops were kicked up a notch.  But as is, as I said above, it just comes off as pretty bland to me. If Im going to drink a pale wheat, give me Lil Sumpin Sumpin any day of the week!   This is not something I would likely drink again, but Im glad I got to try it.  Also happy to try the #1 rated beer in a given style.  "

"O - Exceedingly complex, beyond my high expectations. Just because a beer is refreshing doesn't mean it's not complicated. World-class."

"Pours straw gold with a decent sized head that sticks around for a while. Smells slightly of hops, the usual wheat base and some sort of lemon peel. Taste is much more malty than hoppy but I think that might be due to this bottle being a little bit older. The taste is not bad by any means but I just remembering it being alot more flavorfull the last time I tried it. Mouthfeel is light and carbonation is fairly high. Overall decent beer but im pretty sure this bottle is fairly old."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A quintessential summer beer. Lawnmower beer, food pairing beer, nerd beer. This has become an integral part of my FFF session summer (along with ZD, with a guest appearance from Alpha King)."
""
""
""
"Pours a light straw-like gold. Pine and citrus rind on the nose. Opens with hops just like the nose citrus rind and pine but certainly not overpowering. A touch of sweet malt joins and makes its presence know, but not in a way that would weigh down this brew. Finishes light, fairly dry and crisp with a pleasant hop bite. Overall very light bodied, but the malt backbone certainly is detectable but not overly so, slick mouthfeel. This is a perfect session beer, especially in the summer."
"This is a solid wheat beer. It's well hopped which gives it some character that others in this style lack. It's easily drinkable, smooth, and incredibly enjoyable. I wish I could get my hands on more of this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite happy I have 4 more of these to drink."
"Overall it tastes more to an American pale ale, very drinkable and will be great on a hot day by the pool"

"O- This was very good for pale wheat ale. Nice balance of fruitiness, hops, malts, etc.. Perfect light beer for the summer, could easily session a few of these. I think I actually liked this beer better then Zombie Dust. Glad to see FFF has this as a year round offering, just wish it was distributed around here."
""
"This is a fantastic beer. The hop flavor is enormous yet it's so refreshing and drinkable. It definitely gave me something to work on."
"Overall... eh. Maybe a good lawnmower beer but nothing I'd seek out again. Good for what it is I guess but I don't get how this made #45 on the top 100 ""beers of fame"" list. It just isn't all that great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is pretty light and the carbonation is aggressive. It works very well with food, especially mildly spicy food. Overall, this is one of the best American Pale Wheat Ales out there. I don't think it is as good of a hoppy wheat as the forthcoming Boulevard 80-Acre is, but this is a beer that deserves the loyal following it has."
""
"Overall this is a great beer, although expensive, but nonetheless I can always count on Gumballhead."
""
"Overall - I loved this! Three Floyds continues to impress me with their line-up, and in the process of doing so, have given me my new favorite wheat beer!"
""
"I love this beer!! SO deliscious, I get it everytime I am in the Indiana Area. Just a great beer all around. I highly suggest you try it, it's much better on tap but I would never ever turn down a bottle! I suppose I have to make this review a bit longer. Let's see 3 Floyds is an awesome place to check out. One of my favorite breweries to visit. The only downside of it is their menu, not much to eat there"
""
"Got get my Gumballhead. Simply incredible and if you are reading this wondering if you should buy it the answer is Yes, especially since it isn't distributed much. It's basically an IPA with wheat. The wheat (small amount detected) isn't prounounced and there isn't a wheat beer yeast character at all. I'm guessing the yeast is an IPA yeast or ale yeast and not a wheat ale yeast or hefe yeast. All the better. An elevation and transformation of styles. This beer is a classic."

"Pours a crystal clear, very light golden color with a quickly dissipating white head. The bouquet is characterized by a clean grapefruit perfume and lemon hard candy. They've changed the recipe since last I had it. And not for the better. The mouthfeel is still slick and moist, but the lovely Amarillo hops are quickly overcome by a peat flavor. It's not unpleasant, but to a man who spent a lot of time hunched over pints of Gumballhead in the recent past, disappointing."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle. Golden yellow is color with a good bit of white head that leaves lacing throughout. Smells is of hops, citrus, and wheat. Taste was similar to how it smelled but more hoppy then a traditional wheat beer. Mouthfeel was very crisp and well balanced. Overall this was a solid beer that is refreshing. Looking to have this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Big thanks goes out to the owner of NoDa (Todd) for sharing this one with me during a visit to the brewery! Served from bottle into a NoDa sampler shaker. Poured a hazy pale yellow with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, wheat, and bubblegum. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, wheat, and bubblegum. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I had this brew quite some time back before I was reviewing and took this opportunity to finally write a formal review. This one is definitely one of my favorite Pale Wheats out there as there is just so many things going on. I really liked the bubblegum aspect I picked up on this time around as it completely threw me off-guard. It also made this one quite refreshing and easy to drink. I would recommend this to anyone out there without hesitation."
""
"Beers like this really redefine the Wheat Ale style as this is so incredibly hoppy it is almost hard to believe that it is a wheat beer, which is a style I normally don’t go for, but I love my hops and this delivers in a big way."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Served in a pint glass"
""
""
""
"O: All the great characteristics of a Pale Ale but kicked up a notch with the addition of wheat, which gives it a unique and spicy flavor that is a nice change of pace from all the hoppy Pale Ales out there."
"O- One of my favorite APWAs and one I wish was easier to come across in Chi suburbs during the warm months"
""
""
""
""
"A better than normal example of an American wheat beer (which I usually dislike)."
""
"O - Gumballhead is a crisp, refreshing beer through and through, carefully balancing it's abundant hop additions as to not totally overpower the beer. The ability to session this Gumballhead might be Three Floyds' crowning achievement. Although it's part of the beauty of this beer, there's so much hop character going on, while well-balanced, it overtakes the subtle wheat profile I search for in this style."

"D/O: Great. Highly drinkable. I'd put this on draft in my basement every summer if I could. Typical for this brewery."
""
"Fresh bottle poured aggressively in a duvel tulip. Clean golden yellow with a 2 inch white head that shrinks to a half inch with awesome lacing. Aroma is Amarillo hops, grapefruit, flowers, caramel, and bread. Flavor is orange, grapefruit, biscuit, lemon. Very smooth with a light and somewhat sticky mouthfeel. I don't drink many wheat beers and this is awesome. I buy it when I can."
""
""
"American Pale Wheat Ale? sure why not? more proof to my theory that if you throw enough hops at something it will be very popular, hey what can I say it works on me. If you don't know you better recognize Rutager because he's the man for knocking off yet another want from my list"

"This beer deserves the praise that it gets for being a moderate strength, hop-focused American wheat. With so many boozy hop bombs on the market, I'm glad this one is tempered with moderation."
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours a hazy yellow and a nice white head, typical wheat beer. This beer has an amazing aroma, its very citrus dominant as well as some skunky hops, the aroma of the hops is lightly backed up by a wheat caramel smell. This is an easy drinker for sure. This beer has a light character and a very pleasant hop presence but its far from strong. Im the kind of person that can take down a dreadnought bomber with ease so this beer is rather lackluster in taste and feel. Having said that, it is a grade A example of what this beer is trying to be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is not my style of beer, but do appreciate what they have done here. I do understand the why so many people love it. I enjoy 3 Floyds IPA's a lot more but that is personal preference. I think that they but a god little twist on wheat beer with the traditional 3 Floyd's twist of Hops."

"Pours a slightly hazy honey yellow with a 1 inch puffy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy chunks of lace form randomly on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat, honey, and citrus zest. Taste is of wheat crackers and different types of citrus zest (especially lemon). There is a very mild bitterness that quickly fades from the palate. There is a nice crisp level of carbonation with each sip. Overall, this is a pretty good hopped-up wheat beer but not something I would seek out again."

"D and O: This is a great beer. Glad to finally sit down and give it a formal review. Many people rave about it, and I've been up in the air sometimes about it, but with so much flavor and depth, and 4.5% and an American Wheat...yep, winner by a landslide!"

"O: Really pleasant drinker. Totally sessionable, with a tasty hop bill. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
"One of the best wheat beers I've head. It's not for the faint of hops or one wanting an uninspiring summer chugger. This is a 'nuff said solid beer for any occasion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While it feels better on tap, I prefer the bottle for the excellent flavor without the medicinal bitter tinge."
"O - This beer is a treat and really takes me back to my college years. Awesome offering from FFF that is worth trying and appreciating."
""
""
""
""
"The mouth feel is also outstanding, making this a session pale to be reckoned with."
""
""
"O- Wish I had more than one, but thankful for the opportunity to try it. As mentioned by others, this one cries for the warm summer months. Nice work!"
"O - excellent. Perfect summer beer. Can drink a lot of this. I'm not a huge fan of wheat beer but this is fantastic."
""
"Nice, crisp, bright, toward the lighter end on the body. If not for the flavor explosion this would be really easy to drink, but your tongue wants to enjoy itself."
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the hops blending with the warmer spice in both the nose and the mouth. The hops were incredibly fresh, making for an inviting beverage. The flavor did not disappoint, and presented the wheat up front and with force, in a no-nonsense manner. With such a robust punch, however, we thought that the feel should have been fuller and creamier."

"O - this can be a very good beer for the summer, however it kind of sucks that i only had one - since it's so easy to drink!"
""

""

""
""
"Overall, this is a wonderful, tasty, refreshing beer. I'm not a huge fan of American wheat beers (I prefer the German variety), but 3F has taken what can be a boring style and made something really tasty out of it. This beer would definitely take the pain out of cutting the grass in the summertime. I wish I could get my hands on it more than just once or twice a year."
""
""
""
"Overall: Refreshing and highly drinkable, this would be a great beer for spring and summer drinking."
"Overall - Wow this is really good. Balance is unreal along with great additon of the fruity hops, makes this a wonderful, low alcohol beer to drink. Im not a wheat ale fan but i sucked this brew down without a issue and would buy again. Fantastic, world class, and a must try, even if not a fan of the style."

"Note that my ratings are pulled down by my opinion that this blurs the line too much to be called a wheat beer."
"Overall a very nice wheat beer."
"O – A great combination in my opinion. But I was missing some of the wheat characteristics. Still good nonetheless. Would def get more."

"O - the Gumballhead had much more flavor than expected for pale wheat ale and made for an enjoyable brew; at 4.5% ABV, and combined with ""light feel", one could put away this beer with ease"
""
""
"O- A highly sought-after brew from 3 Floyds. Is it completely worth the mythological hype? Maybe not, but this is a solid wheat beer. Honestly, I have not had the style in quite a while, but this is probably the best wheat beer I’ve had."
"Pours a light straw yellow. Very good clarity and decent head retention. Aroma of wheat, citrus and mild herbal qualities. In the taste, moderate wheat, and a good dose of hops. Hop flavors of citrus, tropical fruit (mango, pineapple) and mild pine. Still, the hops are in the background and don't steal the show. More wheat, with a grainy flavor and a touch of lemon. Mouthfeel is light/medium bodied. Overall, a really nice pale wheat, refreshing and enough hops to keep it interesting."
""
""
""
"O - This is a great beer that I would recommend to anyone. The aromas and flavor are refreshing. I love the combination of citrus and tropical fruits, and it finishes with enough bitterness to keep me wanting another drink."

"Reveal: FFF Gumballhead. Oof, I just had this a couple of days ago and didn't recognize it at all. Also whiffed on the amarillo. Once again, this bif does it's job and makes me reassess what I thought would be an instantly recognizeable beer."

"Overall - The quintessential lawnmower beer. Light and flavorful. Awesome. I wish I could have this in my fridge every day during the summer."

"O - A drinkable beer that goes down way too fast! Tastes more like a pale ale to me."
""
""
""
""
"O- It's great. It's that simple. This one might become a regular in the fridge again."
"O: Really surprised me. Not really a wheat beer fan or fruit beer fan but this won me over. It was quite drinkable and refreshing but each swig left me wanting more. The wheat was in the background, the fruit and hops balanced well and it just clicked."
""
"For this to be a wheat beer it really tastes like a pale ale to me. I like the hoppiness and this is a clean refreshing beer."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden amber, with little head. Looks like a beer in a commercial, that's not a bad thing. Smells of citrus and hops, not overpowering. Excellent. Has a little bit of hop bite up front, with the wheat coming in later, but coming in really strong. A hint of something citrusy...grapefruit maybe? At less than 5% ABV, this is one you can sip all day. I just might."
""
""
"Pours a golden orange/gold color with a great one finger off white head. Good lacing on my snifter glass. Looks much more substantial than most beers in the style. The nose is unsurpassed by any beer I've tried in the style. It smells like an IPA- that's how good it is. Pineapple, mango, and other fruits are in the front here, along with hops. By FAR the best in style I've ever smelled. Taste follows suit: fairly light, but great fruit, hops, and floral flavors. Some grass as well as it warms. Feel is light, with incredible carbonation/aftertaste. Overall, there's a reason this beer leads it's style. It's incredible, a great session brew. Really glad I got to try this one. Cheers."

"Great anytime beer. Light yellow in color hoppy smell on pour citrus taste. Small head disapates rather quickly. Had it New Years Eve but would definitely drink anytime. Three Floyds hit the mark again for me. The store where I usually buy my growlers sells out of this very fast and I was lucky to get some this time cant wait to have some again real soon."

"Gumballhead is a fantastic beer. While it is not one I reach for often when it is available to me, I also enjoy it when I do. Great warm weather beer but then again I would not be opposed to enjoying a few in the comfort of my home while watching the snow fly. Very drinkable, easy to enjoy."

"Had this beer last night thanks Alec for dropping this one off at my house. this beer pours a ligh yellow color with a slight haze to it and a nice white head that fades rather quickly. The smell is light lemony with a little wheat malt there too. I really like the flavor, there is the lemony tang to it and it's super light and refreshing. Overall a great beer"

"Overall: This beer has some sentimental value for me. I first drank it when I really shouldn't have :D My taste generally gravitates towards more acidic/hop centric brews, but this is a great balance of easy drinking while having a distinct hop flavor that doesn't overwhelm the majority of drinkers."

"Overall: Very refreshing and one of the best wheat beers I've encountered. The wheat plays a nice backing and rounding role and allows other flavors to play through and shine. Also, hops make it way better."
"This beer does not follow suit. It goes big for the style. Very unique. Bitter yet drinkable and just sweet enough to really savor. One of my go-to favorites."
"Pours pale orange with a small head. Nose is rainbow bubblegum, soft orange and grapefruit meat, some light spices. Mouth is lightly sweet, banana, bitter hops at the finish with some citrus rind. End of finish is sort of discordant. An interesting take on a wheat beer, one of the more brightly hopped ones I've had, and well done. That being said, I can't see this having a regular place among beers I would like to drink regularly as it's kind of too sweet for a pale ale and too brightly hopped for a wheat beer."
""
""
""
""
"Gumballhead pours a nice golden straw color with about 3/4 finger head. The smell is a pure fruity hoppy waft on the nose. You get a light, crisp, fruit taste with just enough bitterness. The balance between flavors and bitterness is the highlight of this brew in my opinion. overall a delicious brew for any season but especially during those hot summer days. The downfall of this beer is the hype vs. Availability. Although it's a great beer, having to call my local liqour store to check availabilty and then being laugh at doesnt make me want to drink it as much as I want to. If you see it grab it and buy it."

"Got this as part of a beer trade recently.. There seems to be a lot of hype around it and understandably so. From the time this showed up in the mail I was hyped on the label, when I opened the bottle for pouring it radiated an amazing hoppy tropical scent. Poured in a standard pint glass. Crystal clear yellow/ golden color with frothy white head. Smell.. Lots of citrus.. mango and pineapple, and a little bit of hops coming through. Taste is mild.. Light Tropical fruits as mentioned above and some citrus hops. After taste has a touch of biter hops. I could drink these all day. I hate not being able to drink this beer regularly."

"simple, yet tasty, done right, and super sessionable. maybe not as hoppy as i expected, but still hoppy enough to satisfy. i wish i could get this, cause it would be in my fridge more often than not. prolly my favorite american pale wheat to date."

"An excellent wheat beer that uses loads of hops to extenuate the wheat and fruity yeast. Has a lemon zest kick that is well placed and goes great with the hop profile. This may indeed be king of the wheat beers. No wonder it's always so hard to find."

"Pretty much a nice golden wheat color, with a poor head and minimal lacing. The color is wonderful though like a rich golden yellow. The aroma is fruity and citrusy, a nice balanced burst of hops, not to much. Bitter hoppiness up front, with great citrus and grapefruit quality following in the wake. A very clear presence of wheat with its distinct cracker like flavor and mouthfeel. Fluffy mouthfeel, light but some of that resin hop mouthfeel quality. If I had access to this beer I'd drink it all the time."

"O - Decent but I was expecting more. Probably a style I need to try more of to get a better understanding of what it should be. It is very drinkable and could be a great Sunday beer or something to share with the non-nerdy beer drinkers. Definitely growing on me as I drink it. I have never played with the scores as much as I have with this beer but recommend everyone should try."
""
""
""
"I'd say I could use some more of this Gumballhead!"
""
""
"Overall: Wow, a Wheat beer that manages to be both hoppy and balanced. And unlike Lagunitas Little Sumpin' Sumpin' (which is really more of an IPA), I can actually tell this is a wheat beer. If this was available in Minnesota, this would be a must-have lawnmower beer ever summer. By far the best American Wheat I have had."

"Overall: This beer shows the big differences between American and European beers. I had some european beers before this one and its hard to tell because they are basically the same style. Hops are accented much more then the yeast in the Europeans. Easy to see why this is the one of the regular beers by Three Floyds, easily drinkable which gives it an overall commercial appeal."
""

"i take it that it his doesn't sit well with the subtle banana undertones. very very subtle. this is properly hopped. as in a lot like all there other beers. brisk. the adjunct is like a charm. and american and adjunct is like a hex. they do it great. wonderful look for a session. although sort of watery in persona. still very accessible. probably the most being a three floyds when it comes to hop character. golden clear. small head. brisk hop... dry mild floral. and a hint of yeast starches in the back note which i'm sure may over develop over time. i would lavender zucchini bread... but um... beer."
"O: this is a damn good beer and one I would go to consistently in the summer if I had the option."
"On draft, appears light golden with half finger of head.  Appears very carbonated, but dies quickly. Smells of fresh grass and pines.  Complimemted by amazing floral tastes. The hops are not overbearing in the least. Very smooth taste and mouthfeel. This would make a great session beer. Very impressive. "
"O: Smells good but tastes amazing. Drinkability is off the scale as well. King of the pale wheats I think. Lil Sumpin Sumpin comes close but yet so far. I tried to grade this one by style and I have never had better, hence the 5s. Wish this were available in my area. Incredible beer."
"Overall: For a pale ale this is a damn good beer very sessionable and a very easy drinker anytime of the day or night"
"An incredibly easy drinking, delicious, low-ABV pale wheat with a ton of character. I can't think of a better pale wheat ale."
"It isn't dreadnaught, panzer, alpha king, or zombie dust...it is lighter yet still packs such a wonderful hop profile and presence that I just can't say enough about what this beer does. I want to knock it for something but damn...just can't."
"D/O: More or less as promised, this beer smells like Ballast Point's Sculpin IPA but embarks upon its own evolutionary path when it comes to flavor. It uses each of its marquee ingredients to full effect, wringing floral aromatics from the Amarillo hops and soft bread from the wheat. It is compelling and palate-friendly, but like the most interesting West Coast IPAs, does not play well with most other flavors."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and more than rich enough for the style, I could drink a ton of this, a very sessionable and tasty beer."
"Overall Very nice for the style. But don't make the mistake we made while trying FFF brews, drink this before Zombie Dust. But I do highly recommend this."
"Anyways this was my first review."
"O: this brew lived up to all of the hype, another great one from three floyds, id love to get my hands on some of their other brews"
"Overall: This beer might as well be a pale ale cause the wheat beer qualities are minimal and are only detected in the finish. Most importantly though, I’ve been sitting on this one for a month so its assy and not as fresh as it should be for a wheat low ABV brew!"
"Bottle into a pint glass. Have had this several times in the past but first time sitting down for a review. Pours a pale golden yellow. Not a huge head but it sticks around nicely. A little bit of floral hops in the scent, but mostly grassy and earthy notes. Flavor is right there with the nose. A bit of sharp bitterness up front, followed quickly by smooth bready earthy and grassy flavors. Nice smooth and balanced finish. Fairly light body without a ton of carbonation. Overall very refreshing and a really tasty brew."
"o: very good wheat beer that is definatly sesssionable. the only downfall is it leaves a soapy taste in my mouth."
"Give me Oberon, or Live Oak Hefe for that matter any day. I don't know if I keep getting old bottles, but this is nothing close to the better wheat beers out there. Let alone the far superior Hefes."
"Overall - Overall this is one of my favorite American Pale Wheat Ales for sure. Thanks so much arkansastroy for this as an extra in our recent trade! Very grateful for the chance to have tried this beer!"
"overall, this is an outstanding, sessionable beer. If I could get my hands on it more often, im sure it would replace oberon as my summer session brew."
"O - I'm enjoying this one quite a bit right now this is a damn good tasting beer thats lighter and refreshing I could drink a few of these in a sitting worth getting your hands on to try"
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied with quite a bit of carbonation....pretty smooth and easy drinking. Overall, it's one of the best wheat beers out there, no doubt. Definitely some good hoppiness in this one."
"O: Overall a hoppy slightly intense, yet utterly drinkable and very refreshing ale. I could suck down quite a few of these in a row for sure. Not ""blown away"" but very impressed at the same time."
"O - Another please! What a great beer and I was lucky enough to have a fresh bottle...thanks again Deuane...the aroma gets you hooked then you take that first sip and you're hooked even more"
"I'm guessing this stuff is dry-hopped; it's certainly got a ton of sweet citrus in the nose, backed up with wheat and yeast. A very tasty beer that's much hoppier than you typically see from the style. A minor complaint is that the hops somewhat overpower the wheat, but like I said, tasty stuff. Abundant carbonation and a fairly clean finish accentuate the moderate level of bitterness. The wheat pitches in there, too, no doubt. Toss in the light malt profile and crazy tropical fruit flavor combo, and this stuff is really more like a ""wheat IPA"" than anything. An easy recommendation for this unique brew."
"Thanks Todd (Renegade Reps)"
"Overall: The beer is good, the people who made it put a lot of time making this one, and it shows. I honestly would enjoy 1 maybe 2 depending on the weather. Other than that, the sweetness and the zest is a bit much for the lack of alcohol. Clean, refreshing after one, but I stop there."
"o: thank allah i can drink this ontap on a regular basis, the only thing better is zombie dust. both are perfection."
"O/D- Was lucky enough to obtain a bottle from a cool dude. I would absolutely love to have this beer available to me. Very different, and very yummy. This lived up to expectations for me. Really begging for another right now."
"O: This reminds me more of a pale ale than a wheat ale, but it is certainly well made and I like it."
"Thanks Casey!"
"I'm typically not a big fan of wheat beers, but I'll have a few of these on a nice summer day if I'm low on Alpha King or Ambergeddon."
"O: Great Pale Wheat Ale. I am thrilled that I was finally able to try Three Floyds. I look forward to the rest I have been able to get in trade."
"O Very easy drinking beer with lots of great flavor. This is a very well balanced beer. Would buy again."
"O - I really liked it. Excellent summer beer that will satisfy any hop head."
"Overall: This is a solid easy to drink beer. The sweetness of the wheat is well balanced with the slight bitterness and citrus notes of the Amarillo hops. It is basically a wheat pale ale (WPA?). I mowed the lawn earlier this morning and craved this beer when I came in so it is definitely an above average lawnmower beer."
"O - probably the best wheat out there. Super good beer! One of the best things about living in indiana."
"O: A delicious and extremely drinkable beer. Everything about the beer is mellow and soft, but the hop flavors are big enough to please a hop head. It might be a little bitter for the style, but I enjoy that."
"O - I like it well-enough as a pale ale. Reminds me a bit of a Full Sail IPA."
"O: Truly wonderful. As stated before, now one of my favorites and cannot wait to try again!"
"Overall: I'm glad I finally got around to trying this one. On a positive note, I really enjoyed the hoppy take on a wheat beer, and also the unique clean, clear profile. My personal opinion of the gumball note was that it was interesting at first, but tasted more and more out of place over time. I'd like to try this one again on draught, but it's likely that this one's just not for me. Please try, though, to see what you think about it."
"O: This isn't even close to any other American wheat. This is a fairly watery, boring style with no hop character, Three Floyds decided it didn't have to be and made this great beer. I'm impressed."
"Standard hazy golden body and lemony scent with a noticeable hoppy character. Flavor followed suite. This one fulfills the 'pale' in ""pale wheat ale"" nicely. I definitely puckered when I sipped, but it was a nice change of pace."
"*the label is dope also..."
"O-for not being a fan of wheat beer or pale ales this was a good beer with nice balance"
"It's not a great finish but very pleasant otherwise. And even better the second time around."
"O - Overall I am a hop head and like this. For a wheat beer its definitely what I would choose if available in my area. Its almost a wheat IPA if you ask me, and a good one at that. Thumbs UP!"
"This beer has a very nice yellow straw color with a frothy white head. It smells hoppy and like lemongrass a little peppery hop smell. The taste is great, a nice mouthfeel of lemon and hops. It really works well. I should drink this one more often. It's hard to find in fort wayne, and it's a little maybe overpriced around here though too."
"Three Floyds is giving midwest Brewing one heck of a reputation. These guys are fearless much like their art work for their beers. Gumball Head is by far my favorite wheat beer. The appearance is a clear yellow/golden color with nice carbonation that provides good white head that is lacing nicely. The scent is a wonderful bouquet spice and citrus formed by the Amarillo hops. The taste has a great citrus combo of lemon/grapefruit/apricot and touch of spice that I can't define. The mouthfeel is fine...session....no question. This wheat beer could be a pale ale easily. An absolute must try."
"O - Glad i finally got a chance to try this one. It's clearly a classic and deserves to be distributed far and wide, as to give all American craft beer lovers a chance at having it at least once."
"O-Not much of a fan of wheat beers but this is a very good one. Seek it out if you have the opportunity."
"Overall, Gumballhead is the best session-strength Pale Wheat Ale that I've sampled. While Little Sumpin' Sumpin' (7.5% ABV) is more flavourful, robust, and aromatic, this is the benchmark low alcohol APWA. A truly remarkable quaffer that I could drink for days on end. Superb."
"Light bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is super-refreshing. The body is not thick or sticky and, while it is not watery, certainly can be gulped easily. The carbonation is not fizzy but definitely helps to keep this beer awesomely drinkable. The bitterness at the end of the taste does not become drying in the least, making this beer as tasty as it is thirst-quenching."
"On a sidenote, it reminds me quite a bit of Jackie O's Golden Spice."
"Hazy golden color, a few little floaties. Head is generous but quick. Aromas are bright, lots of citrus and tropical fruit. Hints of pine and grapefruit waft in and out, orange and pineapple dominate. Flavor is a god reflection, similar to nose. Lots of citrus and pineappple fruit flavors. Finish is crisp and nicely bitter. Very impressed with this beer, wish I could get it in VA."
"Overall - A very refreshing and drinkable beer. The hop character is very pronounced but balances well with the malt character. I could see myself drinking a lot of these in a short period of time."
"I'll have to trade for more of this sometime soon. I have to say, I'm a big fan of this beer."
"It's strange, this beer doesn't knock my socks off, but it's so smooth and easy drinking, this would be Three Floyds answer to Coors, Bud, Miller Lite etc. This is a genuine everyday, all occasions drinker."
"I don't know what else to say about this beer that hasn't been mentioned already. Overall a fantastic beer and I hope someday soon I can get it here in Ohio whenever I need it."
"12 oz bottle with cartoonish graphics. This beer pours a golden color with a decent fluffy white head. It smells of hops. This beer tastes like an APA; the wheat flavors are minimal. This beer is pretty alright; I was not expecting it to taste as it did."
"overall - nice refreshing wheat, big citrus."
"O: Very light in taste and aroma. Still this is a very refreshing beer. The light candy taste is very different. Could drink a 6 pack of this in about 30-45 minutes on a hot day."
"O: For the record, I'm not the biggest fan of American Pale Wheat Ales, but this is about as good as you can get. Very light and easy to drink."
"Overall, I drink this beer almost as much as I can - when I can find it! It's not an easy one to locate and I can see why. Another great offering from FFF."
"nice smooth taste - hints again of a medley of fruits, the wheat works as a nice counter-balance. good mouthfeel, this is a great quencher."
"Very well done."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into an efes tulip. Thin, white head with low retention. Clear, oily lacing. Clear body, straw/gold in color. Aroma dominated by citrussy hops, tangerine, lemon, lime, grapefruit. Taste is a lovely blast of citrus as the hops dominate. The body is soft and very palatable, i assume by the addition of wheat. A great style of beer and along with sumpin, sumpin, a awesome version if the style."
"O: Nice hoppy twist on a pale wheat ale, very light, refreshing and drinkable."
"Pours a nice yellow-orange with a good head. Excellent citrus aroma - reminds me of a nice grapefruit smell. Not terribly bitter and very refreshing on a warm summer day. Nice hop balance and finishes very smooth with just a hint of bitterness. I would not actually describe this as a ""wheat ale"" but since I am relatively new to beer tasting, perhaps I just don't understand the style as well. I would love to have this in my refrigerator year-round as it could easily be a go-to standard beer."
"without breaking down every detail of this beer I wanted to rate it. It has plenty of people putting down any little particular they can identify. My local beer stores distributor no longer travles to our area and the new one dosen't carry FFF and it breaks my heart. So I just wanted to memorialize this delicious beer that there is never a bad time for and I cant get enough of."
"Overall I am in love with this beer and cant wait to get more of it."
"So, again, this is a great, great beer with tremendous personality. If I were to mix a six pack as a gift for a visiting German friend, there would be a 12oz bottle of Gumballhead, no doubt about it."
"Pours a suprisingly clean golden amber color, nice plume of white froth, decent lacing. First whiff is a remarkable rush of fruit from pineapple to mango to grapefruit to peach, light funky tartness from the wheat and a light whiff of simple syrup like sweetness. Taste brings the fruit to the front, but not as aggressive as the scent dictates and the tart and lightly funky wheat and yeast come into play, finishes with a touch of sweetness akin to a teaspoon full of powdered sugar. Medium bodied, surprisingly creamy and smooth. A very nice beer with a lot of positives, a little more kick of fruity hop flavor and I would be dying for more."
"O: drinkable, delicious, and not overpowering. I'd have it again if I could ever find it."
"O: This is probably the most drinkable beer I've ever had. I mean it feels like you could crush a vat of this thing. Thirst quenching fruity flavors, beautiful hop contrast, and a mouth that rivals the ambrosia of the gods. Such a treat to have a fresh offering of this beer, and to be able to drink it on a hot Southern California day. This beer is on the session ale dream team, a starter in any lineup. Seek this out, it's very well worth it. On second thought, get at least two."
"O: Very highly sessionable, delicious pale wheat ale. I don't see many trumping this. Great balance and high-quality flavors compose this wonderful brew. Definitely worth picking up a bottle-- or a growler."
"Had several bottles of this and was definitely let down a bit. Would love to try it on draft to see if it can live up to the hype."
" Overall a great summer beer that is refreshing and very drinkable.I don'tknow if it fits the style of pale wheat ale but nice beer all together. I want more!"
"O: Much hyped and not dissapointed. This beer wouldn't be in my top 10, however, it is a real bright star in a usually forgetable style of beer."
"O--This is a clean, crisp wheat beer. It could also serve as a hop fix when I need it. I wish this was available to me. Thanks again, Bay01."
"O - Perfect beer for the summer"
"O: I haven't had a lot of this style, but I have to think this is one of the better examples. It is very well balanced and nuanced for a wheat beer. Personally, the taste was a little bit of a let down from the smell, I expected more citrus notes. Nevertheless, if I lived in Indiana, this would be a staple in my fridge during the summer months. A very good beer, I'm grateful to have tried it."
"O: This beer isn't quite what I expected at all, but it was a great surprise and I can see why people go crazy over it. It's a fantastic summer beer that packs a ton of flavor."
"O - Another great one from FFF. These guys have to be considered one of the best American breweries. Great job."
"D- very drinkable with an assertive hop character. Bravo on breathing some life into a simple style."
"O: Very drinkable beer that would be perfect at a BBQ or on the lake. I like this beer and glad I tried it. With that said, when I'm back in Three Floyds territory, I'll probably reach for something else."
"O- Have had plenty of times on draft and bottled and while it's certainly a good brew, especially for a hoppy wheat, I think this beer gets hyped up a bit too much. Certainly a refreshing brew for summer, but not one of my favorites from FFF."
"Then that fine flavor! A well balanced wheat with a great hop kick. This is probably a wheat that would scare off a Blue Moon drinker. But the strong citrus flavor makes an orange unnecessary. The complex flavors and aromas make this beer a must for anyone who enjoys good beers."
"A very tasty wheat pale ale, worth drinking if you can get it."
"This ended up being a much better beer than it initially appeared. I'm glad I bought a six pack instead of a single."
"O) I have enjoyed drinking this beer the past few summers. I highly recommend you get a six pack today!"
"Poured into pint glass, nice golden color with a finger and a half of head. Nose is piney hops, bit of citrus. Taste is congruent, hoppy, I feel like I find some mango and orange. A little wheat. Overall, great beer, well balanced and refreshing, with agreat crisp to relieve summers woes"
"This wheat pours fairly clear deep straw/light golden with a quickly diminishing but clingy white head. The aroma is highly hoppy--citrus, mainly lemons. The flavor is also highly hoppy, lots of citrus, quite lively on the tongue. A bit of wheat malt flavor pokes through the hops at the swallow, a nice subtle surprise. The finish is smooth and just a bit dry. The carbonation is medium-high and body medium. Overall a refreshing, yet subtly complex APA (yes I call it an APA). Glad I've finally tried this beer and would gladly pick up a full 6er."
"Overall, this stuff is everything I hoped it would be. Just wish I had more than one six pack, so it looks like its back to the trading forum for me. I envy those with regular access to this."
"Mouthfeel is light with a nice zip of carbonation. Very refreshing, spritzy, and lemony with a hop kick. A perfect summer/session beer."
"One of my favorites! Definitely a beer I look for when I am out. And the bottle label is pretty badass!"
"I stopped in at Bass Pro Shop in Portage, IN. and they had this on tap as their house special. I knew 3 Floyds knew their shit about beer because they are one of the greats. This beer at first is not too impressive, but as Hank the Tank put it....once it hits your lips it taste so good. The beer pours a nice golden color with a decent head. Not too much aroma coming off but a slight citrus fragrance. In you mouth it is a great summer flavor explosion going on with taste of sweet summer citrus and honey going on. Feels so good on the palate. I would drink 12 of these if I had the time. BTW.... They are pretty close to the MICHIGAN border. No wonder they know their beer!"
"A good beer which if I could get it in Ca. would buy a 6 pack or 2 to get me through this hot summer."
"Overall - This isn't like any other wheat beer I've had. And since I haven't had may american pale wheat ales, it's hard to say if this beer is an outlier or just an example of a style I haven't explored. In any event, I wouldn't put this on my favorites list, but it is new to me - and that's gotta count for something."
"I kept thinking how does a brewery in middle of no where Indiana make beer that people arrange their day around trying to get... now I know. This is the perfect balance of a wheat beer and an IPA. This is an everyday beer and I wish I had access to it more often."
"Enjoy!"
"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The color is a cloudy goldish-yellow,, but not pale yellow like a bud or anything like that. It has a wonderful citrus aroma (the amarillo hops). It has a nice citrus hop flavor along with a touch of lemon in the taste. Carbonation seemed a little on the low side, and mouthfeel was just ok, not too full, but not too light. Overall, it's a very tasty beer and not your ordinary wheat beer by any means."
"O- Great beer. Probably my favorite summer beer."
"Overall Impression- The hop is too overpowering for the style but I can't diss this beer because its still awesome! Should be a American Pale Ale when it comes down to it... I would get this beer again if it was more available to me but not sure what style it is... Isn't anywhere CLOSE to an American Wheat."
"Easily the best wheat beer I've had. If I could get this one on a regular basis I would probably buy this by the case in the summer. A wonderful example of the style."
"o - goes down easy, but doesn't live up to its reputation. if it tasted as good as it smells, this would be amazing."
"Narrative: Parents were a little skeptical of Gumbalicitus, a shiny new fangled prescription drug for unruly Midwestern children. Settlers used to call it wind sickness, but they soon learned that it was an irascible desire to leave locations of concentrated boredom. That is, until this new drug arrived, served in 12oz doses, the highly enjoyable cocktail drug apparently makes even the flattest, most agricultural areas completely tolerable. Iowa parents noted that their students even volunteered to stay in-state upon being prescribed this barbituate calming drug. Side-effects include narcolepsy, contentment, desires to attend comicons, Xbox live subscriptions, and consumption of Hot Pockets. Gumbalicitus is only to be provided to those in need. Anyone living within 90 miles of the Pacific Ocean should not take this drug as it may result in an endorphine overload, burning out the neural cortex. SHIPPING IS STRICTLY DISALLOWED TO CALIFORNIA."
"Listen. I, as a, small minded, standard, do not care for wheat beers. I respect them I just don't love them. So when I had a couple of these Gumballheads I was not expecting too much. The great hops and red wheat combine like chocolate and peanutbutter(figuratively) to make a badass easy sipping beer that has a lot of grapefruit, Lemon, and peach notes. I loved it. In fact I want to go back and change my review scores...done. So three floyds (not sold in my great state) your winning streak continues in my book. Good Day."
"From my weekend notes: This bottle has a heart of gold, like any good eighties comic underworld character. Smells nothing like a wheat ale, but still incredibly satisfying. Dripping with citrus, piney hop madness, this killer nose relays perfectly into the wheat-beer anchor of the brew. The orange marmalade hops blend with the clovey, grassy malt, creating a benchmark American Wheat Beer."
"As a 5.5% brew, I'd love to see it here in MS, I'll have my next bottle side by side with a tallgrass Halcyon, which according to my husband is better. Tastewise it's a close call, but I give this brew my vote!"
"The taste on this is much more restrained than I imagined based on the nose, but it's still very delicious. Instead of the hop attack that I thought I'd be getting, I got a nice and smooth citrus (lemon and grapefruit mostly), hop, and wheat kick. This trio just walks in thandem all the way through the finish, with the wheat and lemon fading first, then the grapefruit, leaving a nice lingering hoppiness. The mouthfeel is very good, it's smooth and has a lively amount of carbonation. The drinkability is exceptional. Overall, this is just an extremely well crafted summer beer that I'd currently be drinking a lot of if it were in my area. But alas, there's only one."
"Overall a good beer. Not amazing but good. Wish I could get 6ers of this. Don't know why the bros only gave it a B."
"Definitely a beer to obtain again!"
"One of my favorite wheat beers when I want something slightly more bitter"
"Felt a bit watery, but a good beer overall."
"Gumballhead turned out to be much nicer than I thought it'd be. The pour was a hazy yellow color with a nice looking fluffy white head on it. The smell of the beer was hoppy, wasn't expecting that but I like it a lot. The soft aromas of grains and wheat are also in there. The taste of the beer has a wheat flavor upfront that is quickly kicked away by a rush of citrusy hop flavors. Kind of reminded me of HopSun from Southern Tier but on a better scale. The mouthfeel was smooth and yet had a good tingling finish. Overall this beer is a very nice release from 3 Floyd's. I'd buy this if they'd only distribute to PA again."
"O - I am completely in love with this beer. This beer drinks like a wheat but has the taste of a pale ale as well. You could seriously drink this all day, and the ABV is not ridiculously high to prohibit you from doing so on a fine summer day. This beer just fits well...its elements come together very well to form a nice cohesive experience."
"I’ll drink to that!"
"O - very refreshing very easy, i like the different malt influence, very good beer disappointing im having my only one i feel like i could get a keg of this for the summer if not year around...definitely recommend this to all that have the opportunity"
"Good feel. Gives you a jab of hops then goes."
"A summer favorite."
"Overall, it's alright, however I wish it had more bold flavors."
"O- This is the beer that started my journey into the world of craft. It took me so long to revisit because apparently people are catching on to the fact that 3Floyds makes an amazingly tasty and drinkable session brew."
"Drinkability: I will be able to put this one away no problem. Easy drinking and not to heavy on the palate so far. Good stuff but you can tell its lower in alcohol and not alot of malt going on."
"O- this beer lives up to the hype. it seems a little closer to a pale ale than a wheat but still very enjoyable. nice work three floyds."
"-JH-"
"Clear gold pour with a small white head. Nice juicy mango and grapefruit aroma with some grassy wheat maltiness. Estery citrus flavor with a fair amount of piny hop bitterness on the finish and a note of clover honey. Medium-thin body with lots of tingly carbonation. What an awesome summertime beer. I wish I could buy it locally. I would drink the crap out of this stuff!"
"My favorite American-style Wheat, although admittedly for it's combination of nontraditional aspects with the wheat character."
"Got another bottle of this as an extra from fear025 and drank it last night. I'm upping the appearance and taste scores. Color was a beautiful slightly hazy golden yellow color that just looked refreshing. Taste was a ton more citrus that I got the first time with more peach, mango, grapefruit and orange. Tasted really fresh. I'll retract my statement about Oberon. This beer is much better and much hoppier. Wish I had access to it all the time. Tasty and refreshing."
"I'd definitely return."
"O (D) - This beer is pretty good, but I don't think it's something I'd really want on a daily basis. I know people really like this beer, and I can see why, but for a wheat beer I'd rather have Oberon, and a hoppy beer I'd rather have Alpha King. It's good."
"Overall, this is a solid Pale Wheat Ale and I can see why it's considered one of the best. An excellent beer for a hot day. Very refreshing. No flaws. Just a solid Pale Wheat all around. Worth picking up."
"Overall I quite like this one. I'm not too familiar with the style, but this would definitely would be a go to beer for me in the summer or with almost any food."
"(D)- An easy drinking beer. Light, mild, and straightforward with some decent flavors."
"o - solid beer. i would probably drink a lot of this it was readily available. glad to have tried it."
"D: A wheat beer for the IPA drinker. Well balanced, great taste, and highly sessionable. I am definitely happy to have received this brew."
"O - Enjoyed this one, first offering from Three Floyds. Great refreshing summer beer - would seek out again."
"O - This is the most unique wheat beer I've ever had and like I mentioned earlier, it really blurs the taste line between a wheat and a pale ale with some IPA frutiness thrown in. American Pale Wheat Ale...the category nailed it. 5.5% for some folks may not be considered a ""session beer"" (I absolutely hate that term to begin with and all the debates that it seems to spark)...but falling to the cliche', this is about as good as it gets to that definition as the ultimate. I could stock this stuff year around but that won't happen, especially since I can't even get it where I live."
"Overall I must say that if all Wheats tasted as great as this one I might not be such a hater of the style. It goes to show us that the right brewery can do it a bit better (or a bit different) and change our opinions. As for all the Adjunct Lager or even Adjunct Wheat (IMO) fans. If you started drinking this by the twelve pack, as you floated down the river on a hot summer day, I wouldn't call all of you beer p***ies!! Thanks to HandsomeBrew for the extra. A must try!! Go Three Floyds!!"
"Very solid. I wish the appearance was better. Could use a little more carbonation as well. Wheat is very restrained, almost like an IPA light, but in a good way."
"Thank God I got two bottles of this because one was not enough. This beer is fantastic! I would say that it is just a little bit on the thin side, but the creaminess and the full flavor of this beer make up for it. Definitely worth seeking out"
"O: Wow, I really wanted to be blown away by this beer and I suppose that lead me to disappointment. Weird that I would use the word disappointment for a beer and gave it such a decent review. Oh well, I definitely will drink this again, just not necessarily going to seek it out so hard..."
"O -I could drink this unique beer all day long."
"O – I really enjoyed this one. It’s a damn easy drinker. Very crisp and refreshing. Bitterness is balanced well by the citrus and wheat. Solid all around."
"O: Great light pale ale with an amazingly smooth finish. I wish this was more readily available! Thank god for the six packs."
"O/D - I really liked this one. Whenever I hear wheat beer the last thing I am thinking is hops, but it was done very well here. It has good balance and drinkability, one could easily go back-to-back with this brew."
"O: Another quality beer from FFF. This beer is a good session beer. Refreshing and enjoyable."
"O: Great beer-- I can see why so many friends recommended it to me. The salesman at the store told me I was lucky to find it since it usually sells out the day it arrives. No surprise there. Worth seeking out."
"I love Gumballhead! Pours a light yellow with 1"" head that dissipates fairly quickly. This is quite a hoppy American Pale Wheat, and it works very well for this beer. Smells like grapefruit and is very citrusy. I did not detect any scent of gum or gumballs as some reviewers have claimed, and I think that's just a by-product of the name. Get this beer if you can!"
"This is probably one of my favorite beers and if where I am at has it on tap I always get atleast one. Pretty tough to find bottles cause the liquor store in my area sells out pretty quick whenever they get it in. Gumballhead is a fitting name because you can damn near chew it its so hoppy great beer and always a want."
"Overall, great year-round offering from FFF. You can't go wrong with a sixer of this stuff. Drinkable, delicious, and readily available."
"Overall- Three Floyds created another very different beer with this one. This is the wheat beer for the hophead!"
"O - Waite too long to try this beer. Great stuff."
"This is my new everyday beer. I am lucky whereby I can get it as needed in bottle, or on tap just a few miles away. The hoppy-fruity aromas titillate me each time I drink this. It goes down so smooth. I have had a dozen or so friends try this and it becomes a staple in their drinking as well. Three Floyds has a hit with this one."
"As far as American wheat ales go, Gumballhead is one of the best. Light enough to be thirst-quenching, flavorful enough to keep you coming back."
"O - Love it! I need to get more of this once the weather gets warmer out! Makes me want to try many more from Three Floyds"
"This was my first time trying the beer and wow, I like this beer a lot! I think it lives up to the hype as a perfect summer beer. I love the drinkability and refreshing qualities of a wheat beer, but I'm a hop head so this beer really hits the mark for me. I just wish it wasn't $11 a six pack."
"Cheers!"
"O- Another great offering from FFF. Would I take this beer over other FFF beers? No. Would I take this beer over other American Wheats? Hell YES!!! Definitely a great beer in a style that I find to mainly have forgettable offerings..."
"O: awesome balance, extremely refreshing. I now have a new opinion of this beer now that I've tasted it in its freshest state. Yum."
"I wish that I had easier access to this quaff-able APWA, I thought it was dynamite. Great nose filled with tropical fruits and nice spice balance from the wheat. If you have stable access to this beer, consider your self very fortunate. This is just about the perfect summer afternoon brew."
"Very easy drinking with very little aftertaste."
"T: Lots of caramel malts and a hint of citrusy hops. There's a bit of a peppery hop bite upfront and then the taste gets overwhelmed by the malt sweetness. The wheat gives it an incredible smoothness and a fantastic creamy mouthfeel. I would drink this every day if I could get it here."
"For whatever reason, I just don't trust that yellow guy on the label. Anyway, the beer behind him pours a clear golden sunlight-blonde topped by a nice finger of white foam. The nose comprises orange zest, pine, orange peel, light grapefruit, light raspberry, banana, light cardamom, and some nice honey-dripped biscuit in the background. The taste doesn't really change this recipe all that much, but it does come across to me as a slightly watered-down, slightly wheated-up version of the smell, which does take away from the tastiness imbibed by my 'strils. It still tastes pretty damn good, but not as good as it could have, if that makes any sense. The body is a nice light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisply-finishing wet feel. Overall, a very nice (if sort of elusive) APWA, one of the best things regularly put out by the Floyds."
"Had on tap at The Beer Trappe, poured a nice golden orange with a decent zesty white head that lingered for some time. Smell upfront was dominated by hops citrus and pine with a hint of grapefruit followed by an ever so faint bit of wheat and sweet caramel grain. Taste is very nice with a crisp hop presence up front with the smoothness of wheat coming through with a clean citrus hop finish. Everything balanced nicely in the taste. Mouthfeel was light and smooth not heavy like some of Three Floyds hoppier beers can be. Overall a tremendous APWA and a great beer to have when the summer grill outs arrive. Good sessionability."
"Overall, I don't think there could be a better APWA. This particular style, to me, is probably the most boring and uninteresting styles, but this is definitely not a boring APWA! Kudos FFF!"
"A nice wheat tang with a citrusy-tropical shitload of hop flavor. Not overly bitter, but just realy bright and fresh. I would absolutely love to have access to this all the time. I do get some of the gumball flavors I am assuming from the yeast melting together with hops. Juicy and thirst quenching as hell. Man, this is great!"
"Poured a golden color with a good amount of white head on it. Smell was very good citrusy wheat with some floral notes. Great tasting beer, well balanced wheat and slight malt taste coming trough. Light bodied beer and very easy to drink. This one went down very smooth. I'll definitely buy this again and probably have in my fridge pretty regularly."
"Pours a nice crystal clear old gold with a finger full of head that leaves sticky curtains on my spiegelau tulip. The nose consists of bready malts, some sweet pastry and lemon peel piney hops. Taste is very lemony followed by crisp bittering hops and malts, refereshing taste if not one dimensional. Drinkability is high as a sessionable beer though not too thought provoking."
"Overall this beer on draft is insanely better than the bottles version, I could not believe it actually was better after hearing so from a few friends. I am glad I tried this one on draft it definitely opened my eyes to how good gum ball head actually can be. Sorry for doubting the glory of the gum ball head."
"This was a really enjoyable, balanced beer that made me very happy. Those of you who can drink this often are lucky dogs."
"Taste is more lighter pale ale than wheat, but I'm not going to get caught up in the nuances of the style, this is great beer."
"Looks like a lager with a nice head sitting on it, clear, slightly dark yellow. Smells of faint piney hops, wheat and maybe a touch of corn or other sweetness. Taste is clean and crisp. Very impressive. Pine hops and some sort of wheat lager come together with a touch of sweetness to deliver a super clean taste. Mouthfeel is a little sweeter and heavier than I would expect. Sweetness just kind of hangs out in the mouth, but not really as a flavor, just as a feeling. Overall, this is a goto beer if I just want something light that still brings something to the table."
"I should note that I have heard people claim this beer to taste/smell like gumballs. I did not find this true at all in my case. It certainly smelled good, but nothing more than the typical tropical fruit-heavy pale/ipa. For this I was a little disappointed, and if that was the true intention of the brewery I might be compelled to dock the beer another half point for smell/taste."
"Thanks to itsthelibyans on reddit for this beer."
"O: This is decent, but nothing mind-blowing."
"D- This goes down really easy. I really like having this beer around because it's a nice beer to have in the summer."
"What a blast of hoppy goodness! Friend of mine bought me a 6pack of this because he thought I would like to give it a try, boy am i glad I did. This beer is just loaded with hops flavor, which is something that usually turns me away, but the balance with the maltyness was superb. While a lot of hops taste comes though, it seems to have a great finish and the bitterness of it is just right. I can't wait to drink the rest of the pack and share them with a few friends."
"This is my favorite beer. Amarillo Hops gives it a Grapefruit smell and Citrus taste. Perfect amount of bubbles.The Malt and Wheat makes it Warm and fuzzy in the winter but light and very refreshing in summer. I realize now I am a lucky SOB living in the the land of 3 Floyds."
"Overall this is a very solid offering. However, I feel like it falls a bit behind Lagunitas Lil Sumpin, which is an all-star in its class, in my opinion."
"D- I knew this was a hoppy taste for an American Pale Wheat, but the amount still surprised me a little. That being said, I think this would be a very refreshing beer for a warm day and would certainly get it again."
"Overall-- a very nice, albeit hoppy, take on the style."
"Mouthfeel is one of the lightest and most crisp I've had. It's perfect for this beer, and the lively carbonation keeps the mouth busy while preventing the beer from ever feeling watery. Drinkability is off the charts - the combo of the abv, light body, flavorful yet unimposing taste and tremendous mouthfeel is unstoppable. Probably the best wheat beer I've ever had."
"Overall a very good and unique creation by the folks at FFF. Well worth trying - and having again and again if you can get it."
"It's a solid hoppy beer. I apologize for the ratebeer style brief review, but I give this a solid 4.0"
"Pours a beautiful golden body with a bright white head that stays most of the way through. It leaves a nice white film on the glass with every drink. Smell is of hops and wheat. The smell is pretty straight-forward, nothing crazy going on there, but doesn't need to be. The taste is great, has good mellow hop taste with a wheat finish. Great balance between the two. Mouthful is what is to be expected of a great wheat beer, very thin, but that is a good thing. Overall this beer ranks up with my favorites. Believe it or not I'm not a huge wheat beer fan, but the blend of hops just makes this perfect. Great sessionable beer that you can drink on a hot summer day or a cold winters night."
"D: Definitely happy that I got to try this one, and I'm sure I'll be trading for it again in the future (unless Three Floyds comes back to Ohio, which would be ideal)."
"A sessionable and tastey beer that goes down easy. I could consume a few in a sitting, no problem."
"D- Very easy drink, low ABV, nice bear to drink on a warm sunny day. Nothing too outstanding, still a solid wheat beer from 3 Floyds."
"D: The drinkability of this is phenomenal. I'm enjoying it outside on a 75+ degree day and I'm sure I'm going to have no problem finishing the growler by myself. I'm not a huge fan of wheat beers, but this is really hitting the spot."
"Drinks pretty well. I like wheat beers for everyday drinking, especially for sporting events because they're light and easy to drink and of moderate alcohol. This one fits right in."
"The beer is a light gold color, with a thin white head that fades quickly and leaves a thin lace on the glass. The aroma is mostly of lemon with some wheat and quite a bit more hops than you usually get in this style. Citrus sweetness and a significant hops flavor hit you first. The wheat character comes out a little bit after the hops & citrus fade, but it's not very pronounced. After-taste is lemony sweet with a little bit of hops bitterness. Very crisp & very smooth, medium-to-high carbonation, medium body, clean finish."
"D- 4.5 The well-balanced, clean tastes of this brew and its unheaviness make this very drinkable for me. It is refreshing, hoppy, sweet and smooth. If only I could get this more frequently..."
"D: This is edged out by fresh Lagunitas Little Sumpin' Sumpin' if you were strictly talking about American Pale Wheat Ales. But in my head I'm comparing this against Pale Ales in general, and even then there are a few I like more. Hardly a bad beer, just not something I'm ga-ga over."
"D- This goes down really easy. I wish I could get lager quantities of this near me because I would love to be able have this waiting for me after a long day of work on a nice spring day."
"I liked the beer... don't get me wrong... But there's no wow factor that made me immediately wish I'd bought another growler of it.."
"D: I could definitely drink a sixer. There is no alcohol taste anywhere. I almost can't help but down this thing in a few minutes. The flavor just completely dominates the palate and leaves you with an almost dry mouth that needs something to wet it, oh and look I've got a beer in front of me, I'll use this."
"D - Very drinkable and refreshing. This is a great summer session beer. Lawnmower or patio...low level ABV make this a nice option. Pretty much like a wheat IPA."
"Drinkability: Well balanced and quite good. I will seek this out again in the future."
"Not your grandma's wheat beer. I love this one, especially on tap."
"D- I could see having a few of these, maybe when it warms up a bit more. I feel like this beer changes every time I have it. The first seemed to have this delicious crush of sweetness that is mellower the more times I try it."
"Put this next to an IPA and it will fall flat, but on its own, or compared to other pale wheat ales, Gumballhead really excels. Ridiculously easy to drink and refreshing, very simple beer that is a great standby to have around..."
"THINK SESSIONABLE; TRY IT!"
"The CPJ"
"Pours a hazy yellowish light amber. No head at all with a thin amount of lacing. Smell is mostly bready malt with a hint of hops. Taste is similar with an emphasis on the malt side of things. The hops are there and provide a citrus zest on the palate. Was hoping for more hop flavor but what's there is nice. The wheat gives this beer a real nice body and feel in your mouth. Carbonation is on the low side but adequate. Hardly any bitterness, good mouthfeel, and a flavor that is easily palatable all contribute to a very drinkable if not terribly exciting brew."
"Not being a big fan of wheat beers, I still find this Three Floyds offering refreshing and quite good. The addition of all Amarillo hops add a bit of a natural citrus character that do this style well. No need for an orange wedge on the glass. The orange flavor is right from the bottle as intended by the brewer. Admittedly, I'm enjoying the aftertaste more than the beer itself. Aftertaste is, again, wheat bread but with a lot of subtle sweetness from other malts and the lovely orange rind touches... Nice."
"Drinkability: I really enjoyed this beer. I could definitely see this being a great beer to relax with in the summer."
"D-I love this beer in the summer! HECK i love this in the winter. it is my go to beer so i might be alittle biased but def. give this beer a try if you havent"
"D: Quite a drinkable beer. I wish it were hotter out, it would pair well with a warm day."
"Poured from 12oz bottle (no date, but label shows 2007 copyright which makes me wonder how old this was) into tulip glass. Pours hazy yellow-golden with a small, rocky white head and a few small particles of sediment. The head fades quickly to a minimal cover but leaves some lace as it goes. The aroma has prominent, but bitter notes of citrus along with some floral and lemon notes from Amarillo hops. There is also a touch of yeast and grass, with some wheat. The flavor starts with a restrained sweetness up front and develops a tangy acidity through the middle. Hops are present all the way through and these grow towards the finish. The finish is long with hops and lemony lingering on the palate. Palate is light-medium in body with a watery texture and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a very unconventional example of a wheat ale, but it is good. It is more assertive than most wheat beers and much more complex for the style."
"D : A pleasant take on an American wheat beer. God, light citrus and hop flavor plays well with the wheat malt. I really enjoy the use of Amarillo hops."
"Medium bodied with a good balance of earthy and citrus hops, crisp, light fruit, citrus peel and spice. There is some earthy pine needle and citrus/tropical fruit notes from the hops but it isn't as hop forward as the aroma suggests. The wheat beer characteristics are much more prevalent in the palate and flavor. Good balance of bread/yeast, citrus peel and clove notes. Clean, crisp and easy drinking with a slightly dry finish."
"This beer was made for drinking. It isn't my favorite style, but of the American Pale Wheat Ales I've tried, this one stands out."
"Drinkability: One the more easily drinkable beers that I've tasted in a long time."
"Poured a mildly hazy light coppery orange with a short lived white head. A band of lace adorns the glass but not much remains. Kind of a weak smell. Slight citrus hints and wheat. Tangy and fizzy with a decently strong citrus body but light in other flavors. Mild wheat twang and bitterness in the finish. Light bodied, crisp, and refreshing. Not much else here. A decent lawnmower beer though."
"Drink- I have to say. I live in CA but I am really digging on Three Floyds lately. Thank god for trading my friends."
"A great pale wheat. What else can I say"
"A nice beer, but nothing special. Too much of a sweet biscuit and grain taste. Hops are a little floral, bitter, not a tropical punch. Does not hold a candle to sumpin sumpin. Easy to drink, but not terribly deep."
"Now that I'm thinking about it, with the limited supply of this that comes out of the brewery, maybe I shouldn't rave about this one so much...kidding, drink this if you have the opportunity, you won't be disappointed."
"Pours amber with big foamy head. Looks well carbonated. Great lacing. Smells a bit sharp and hoppy with some sweetness on the nose. Doesn't smell particularly citrusy like most wheat ales but rather some sweetness that melds well with the light wheat hints. Tastes sweet and hoppy with some background of wheat. a tasty beer with a great mouthfeel. Very drinkable and for sure my favourite wheat beer!"
"Verdict: STrange brew, not really my style. Worth trying out of novelty, though."
"Faint bread at first then a giant sweetness finishing off with a huge wheat field rush, hops, and aromatics... WOW just flat out neat, not bitter, not weak, even a crispness... I am wildly impressed by this beer and wish I could get more."
"D - A highly drinkable wheat beer that I'd love have again in the heat of summer on a super humid day sitting out in my yard after working on the garden."
"This is my number one refrigerator beer because more visitors seem to like it over other craft beers and the lowish ABV means I can drink it all day long. And I do."
"the original sumpin'... just sayin'. burnt gold with an off-white head that holds forever and leaves big lace. sweet, red wheat and fruity, fruity, citrusy amarillo rule this one in the nose and taste. to me it is a hop bomb, and all the fruity goodness and sweet wheat translate into a flavor that actually is reminiscent of the bubblegum we used to get as kids from machines. a little bit of lemon, citrus, tropical fruit and bubblegummy esters. really unique and quite hoppy, but more so in the dry-hop sense, seeing as there is minimal bitterness in the medium body that goes down slick, silky and a little chewy. very good, very unique, and masterfully balanced for such a hoppy beer. still as good as the first time i tried it."
"This beer has alot of the hop character, especially in the nose, of a good IPA or APA, but without the bitterness and as much booze. A great, easy drinking stepping stone toward the hoppy end of the beer spectrum."
"D:Hands down the best wheat brew out there, doesn't even taste like any other wheat beer I have ever had. Easy drink with great taste and aroma, could drink this all the time and usually do. Get your hands on some"
"I can give it props for doing the style well. Just doesn't seem to be a style that I much enjoy. Ho hum."
"Overall: Such a tasty beer, I'm not usually a huge fan of American Wheats but Gumballhead is hopped up enough. These will be great once summer comes around again, perfect to bring to the beach or just drink sitting around."
"Cheers..."
"Light bodied and modestly carbonated. This is a very drinkable beer that I would go to all summer long if it was regulary available. Surprisingly I found this bottled offering to be much more enjoyable then when I had it on tap back in April."
"D: Very drinkable; great refreshing and easy drinking beer"
"I found the beginning and the finish to be even. There was no change or crescendo in initial taste to swallow. This is odd to me as I find almost all beers to dramatically change in taste both during and after the drinking process. This quality combined with the fruity/wheat yumminess proves to be an excellent drinking beer. I will seek this out again with vigor. Highly recommend."
"d- gumballhead breaks the mold for what a apwa can be, this is definitely up there with little sumpin sumpin, i get more bitterness here than in alpha king. this is very drinkable - if i had access to this brewery this would be a staple in my fridge for sure."
"D: reminded me of a light version of their Pride & Joy."
"Subtle aroma, but followed with an eye-openingly brilliant taste. Amarillo hops, lots of them and beautifully done. Definitely a beer I will seek out again."
"D- very drinkable brew that I will enjoy finishing the 5 I have left. Definitely worthy of a try, but I'm not sure it lives up to all the hype it gets."
"I could easily drink a 6pack of this and love every drop! This is a great wheat ale but one of the hardest to find even though I work at a liquor store we only get a limited supply so if you fall in love, stock up!!"
"I have to applaud three floyds for having one of the best beers I have ever tasted"
"Overall I really like this. It is a thinner, smaller pale ale. Hard to even tell that there is wheat in there. Just a graininess in the finish. I don't detect any specialty grains at all. This is a simple refreshing summer beer for those that love American hops."
"I must say that I'm not entirely sold on this beer.  Don't get me wrong - there wasn't anything unpleasant about this beer, but as a pale wheat ale, I just was not getting as much of the wheat side as I expected.  The balance seemed to swing more towards an IPA, if anything.  It definitely has more flavor than your average American-style wheat beer thanks to the hop presence, so I'd say it sits above the likes of Sam Adams Summer Ale or GI's 312.  But the question - Is it worthy of all the hype it receives?  I'm not sure I can say after one tasting - will have to try another bottle to see if does enough to change my tastes or my opinion."
"This is super drinkable and by far the best American wheat beer that I have ever had. It makes me wish that more breweries were making wheat beers like this. Yet another great beer from Three Floyds."
"D - Just a fantastic drink; one of my personal favorites; I could have quite a few of these and be very happy; FFF brewers did a fantastic job coming up with a unique blend of ingredients to produce a memorable beer"
"D- Gumballhead is another unbelievable brew from FFF. I challenege anyone to find a better drinkable brew for a resfreshing drink. I will try to find more of these somehow, someway!"
"Gumballhead, my favorite beer. Love that its brewed here in Indiana as well, which makes it readily available. Pours a light bronze color with a light head. Leaves a lacy trail. The taste is wonderful. The wheat is prevalent and delicious. A great beer overall, enjoyed year round. Really though, with FFF, you can't go wrong."
"I received a 6-er of this from a trade with Atown from Illinois and I was quite pleased with the trade and this beer. I wish I was drinking this in the summer, because this looks quench-tastic. A slightly hazy golden color with bubbly carbonation floating through my glass. The head was about 3/4 of an inch and of average density. Unfortunately the head dissipated quickly after the first two sips. If I were to judge the style of beer by smell alone I would be convinced that this was a straight-up IPA. I did not detect any wheat in the nose. (though I'm no bloodhound) The taste was good, but not what I expected, which made trying this beer fun. It has interesting depth with the hop/wheat combo. The emphasis is certainly on the hops, and they have a pine flavor to them which I really liked. The wheat played second fiddle in this brew to the hops. The more subtle flavor of the wheat may be a letdown if you are looking for a good wheat beer, but if you enjoy wheat beers and IPAs then its a fun blend. Mouthfeel is medium to light and its pretty crisp and refreshing. Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. A good middle ground between two of my favorite summer styles."
"OVERALL: This is an easy beer for an IPA drinker to drink, but probably not what most wheat beer drinkers would have in mind. It is bold, strong and delicious."
"My favorite wheat beer and like most 3Floyds products deviates from the norm into areas that produce pleasant surprises."
"D: Despite the low mouthfeel score, Gumballhead is still an excellent brew and I would purchase cases of it during the summer months if only FFF would distribute to PA, the greedy SOBs."
"Certainly one of the most interesting American wheat beers that I've had, Gumballhead is a beverage that I will certainly look for again. Maybe it's just because I like hops so much, but I'd say it's my favorite wheat beer that I've tried so far. Yet another winner from 3 Floyds."
"D - Very drinkable. Mow the lawn in the summer drinkable"
"This is a fantastic beer, and I'm ashamed that it took me this long to get my hands on some. I sure wish Three Floyds would distribute to PA. I'm going to have to get tons more of this in trades. I love the combination of wheat and boat loads of hops."
"D: Nice carbonization and light. For me this beer starts out slow and finishes strong. This is quite different from most beers I drink."
"all in all i will re-review when i get more but as it stands right now this beer is awesome and SEEK IT OUT"
"D: All day, all night."
"Drinkability: This is a lot better than most of the boring beers in the category, and is a great light change of pace from a great Three Floyd's lineup."
"Overall: A truly remarkable brew. Its not really a wheat beer, its not a PA or IPA, its doesn't really have a style, but whatever it is, its great. A real masterpiece of subtlety from a brewery that isn't know for pulling punches, and the quintessential summer beer. Recommended!"
"The overall flavor isn't bursting but the flavor itself is very good. The hops in this show up much more in the flavor than the smell. The bitter herbal resinous hops rest underneath a crisp citrus edge on top. Chewed weak bubble gum shows up along with orange and lemon. Something in the flavor reminds me of fresh hop pellets before brewing and it's a nice addition. I wish I could get more Three Floyds in GA because this is a masterpiece of subtlety. Overall very drinkable and tasty."
"O: Solid flavor, but not the interpretation of the style that I am looking for."
"Pours a light golden color with two and a half fingers ifwhite head that stays for a while, and leaves nice lacing.  Smells are citrus hips, slight piney hips and some wheat.  The citrus hop smell makes my mouth water, amazing.  The taste is citrus hops up front, followed by some wheat and a nice, slightly bitter hop finish.  Mouthfeel is great and drinkability is off the charts.  This beer is definitely the best or one of the beat in this style, and it's easily sessionable."
"Pale golden with a thick pillowy head. Lemon zest and pinapple in the aroma. Similar flavors. Pineapple, lemon and grapefruit. The hops are wonderfully flavorful with out being over agressive. Other than the lemon there's not much that screams ""wheat beer"" to me. Nice light mouthfeel. The essential summer beer imo."
"D: Damn good. I can see why this is six packed and not in 22oz. If this was a local offering for me it would be a staple in my fridge, and a constant order at my local watering hole."
"this beer is tough to classify - not a true wheat but i guess americans twist on it hoppy - a great beer anytime of the year"
"M/D: Light to medium bodied, very crisp and refreshing. Overall a great beer, moves right near the top of my list. Could easily drink this one all night long."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy golden color. I'm not sure if it was just the way the bartender gave me the beer, but it had no real head on it to speak of. The aroma is decidedly hoppy and I must say I'm surprised at that for the style. However and nice and orange-piny the scent maybe I would still have liked to smells some wheat which did manage to elude my nostrils. The taste is surprisingly pleasant. I was, due to the aroma, expecting a mouth-full of juicy hops. Instead what I was awarded with was a sweet fruitiness. I believe that I was able to taste some nectarines and pineapple in the flavor. There was a hint of bitterness still which I didn't much care for, but I must admit this beer went down smooth as silk and was very easy to drink. I know most people would kill to have this on tap all the time, but as excellent as this beer is it doesn't have that ""wow factor"" that I look for. Still a great beer and a recommendation from me."
"Lighter to medium body, fair amount of carbonation, and a bit of creaminess. Crazy drinkability on this one; lighter ABV, great flavor, refreshing, and avoids becoming too dry or bitter. This was my first FFF beer and it's living up to the hype."
"Drinkability: A great wheat beer that doesn't overwhelm you with adjunct flavor. Would definitely come back to this one."
"D- Very drinkable beer. Would be great in the summer months."
"D - Beyond recommended."
"D: Extremely drinkable very session-able a go to drink among many of the FFF brewing! Everything I've had I've loved!"
"the bodi is light to medium with an aggressive carbonation level to make it seem lighter. The mouthfeel also has a texture of what I associate with a decent percentage of wheat malt used. It's kind of creamy and slick but not in a bad way, it's just what have recognized as a common trait in most beers with wheat. It's highly drinkable though and I can surely understand why there is such demand for this beer. Overall a really nice everyday beer."
"D- I could drink on this all day, I wish it were still in ohio."
"Drinkability: This is probably the best beer in this style that I've had. The best ones seem to be the hop forward ones, but this one retains some wheat-beer-ish-ness, unlike a beer like Little Sumpin Sumpin, which is more like an IPA with a little wheat malt. This would be a great summertime or barbeque beer."
"D- I can see why people go nuts over this. A fantastic beer. Worth it and then some."
"Mouthfeel is a bit of a weakpoint here. Medium in body but carbonation is low for a wheat ale. That being said, this would be a go-to beer for me if it were available locally, it's really quite enjoyable, particularly when it's fresh enough to bring out these wonderful citrus hops."
"D: I really enjoyed this beer. Very easy to drink with a soft and crisp flavor. Definitely want more. Thanks Kruthar for this!"
"I had heard a lot of hype surrounding gumballhead so I had to give it a try. While it is not a bad beer all the hype did not live up to my tasting. It has a very hoppy smell almost to the point of an IPA and pours a golden yellow color. The taste is smooth and mellow but doesn't have a whole lot of body and girth to it. On the plus side it is has no bad after taste. Worth a try to form your own opinion about it."
"Drinkability:This is a great sessionable IPA. There's not a huge amount of complexity in this beer, but it's got lots of drinkability."
"Pours a very pale golden color with a big white head the dies down, leaving sticky lace on the sides. Aroma, grapefruit and tangerine are dominant with some grainy base aroma underneath, the amarillo hops really dominate here. Flavor starts with sweet/bitter grapefruit up front and continues through to the finish. Moderate carbonation and refreshingly dry with a bit of resinous hop flavor that sticks to the tongue. This beer tastes like happy."
"Lower the alcohol by 1.5% ABV and we'll talk. Very good! Now that I am done singing praises, I have to say that 3 Floyds has done a pretty good job of making their mediocre beers look awesome. I have had Dark Lord on one occasion and that too is contributing towards my opinion."
"A wonderful treat of a wheat beer."
"D: Definitely a top-shelf American wheat ale but still doesn't hold a candle to Lagunitas Little Sumpin Sumpin. Glad I tried it all the same. Hoppiness is aggressive without making the feel too sticky."
"D. Probably the best hop smell of any beer that is not an IPA. I really like Amarillo hops and this beer is a fine showcase of their potential. This is a unique and tasty brew."
"D: Session beer, and a solid one, very drinkable."
"This is very drinkable and one of the better wheat beers I've had. I'm giving a few tenths of a point up on this category because the label is awesome."
"Drinkability: Unbelievably high."
"D - Oh so drinkable. I wish I had easy access to this because it would be forever in my fridge. This is a must try for any beer nerd."
"D: I could easily drink this all day. I'm so glad FFF made this part of their standard ""flagship"" line-up rather than an overpriced bomber the way it used to be."
"I had this one on tap and it was a cloudy pale straw yellow and golden in color with a light white head. It had a nice piny, citrusy (grapefruit?) aroma to it with light yeast and sweetness. The taste was excellent. It was very citrusy with slight hoppiness to it and had a dry, yeasty after taste. It was very light but well carbonated, crisp, and smooth. This has got to be one of the most drinkable beers around. It's excellent on tap so grab it if you can find it."
"D- Good. This is a refreshing, full-flavored beer that's pretty easy drinking. Very light lingering aftertaste is pleasant and calls me back for more..."
"FANTASTIC!"
"D: A really tasty beer overall. I just wish there was a hint more malt and body. Would be a quite enjoyable, summer hop fix. I'll buy it again, but only in the summer."
"While not as earth-shattering as I was expecting, a very nice APWA. Interesting to see such a hop-forward wheat beer, and I would definitely have this more often if it were available to me."
"Got a six pack of this from a great BA recently. Poured into a pint glass. This is pale, hazy yellow with a thin white head sitting atop a lively body. The aroma is sweet, like bananas and strawberries with a solid wheat and grain aroma in the background. Slight hop aroma with a mild sweetness make this fun to dip my nose into. Tastes like it smells, sweet fruits with solid grains. If this was local it would definitely be a go-to beer for me. Mouthfeel is light and carbonated nicely. A solid wheat beer that is easy to drink. I would take this anytime."
"Average mouthfeel and super high drinkability make this a fantastic offering. I would love more of this for the summer."
"O - While it's an outstanding everyday brew, the flavor is a bit lacking and leaves me wanting. Still very good."
"D - well, this beer is super drinkable, every day of the year. Hot, cold, in-between, it doesn't matter...it's smooth, refreshing, and smells awesome!!!"
"This is definitely somewhat of a hybrid ipa/wheat the taste and aroma of a wonderful ipa, mixed with the lightness of a refreshing wheat. 3F's was right... It's Not Normal."
"A very refreshing beer. One beer I would order and order over again. A great flavor, light bodied and nothing too bitter to where you can enjoy drinking 3-6 in a night. Might be a go to beer when going to a party that is BYOB."
"D: Very easy to drink, probably due to the low ABV. Good session beer."
"Man, this was delicious! Fairly light, easy-drinking, refreshing. The dryness hits at the perfect time to bring me back for more. Could definitely go through multiples of this in a row. Again, much love to Mavajo for the extra, this one kicks ass!"
"Pours a clear golden orange, with a tinge of straw yellow to it. One and half fingers of head here, quickly fades to a very thin layer of head with a bigger collar. Aroma is a very pleasant citrus hop, led by some orange, nectarine and peach. A touch of lemon rind here as well, with some malty sweetness underneath it. Taste has a nice wheat character to it (well duh!), decorated with citrus hop profile that's exceptionally refreshing for the style. Follows the aroma pretty well for the taste. Mouthfeel is good, medium carbonation and very drinkable. Approximates the perfect summer beer, and is incredibly sessionable."
"This is a good beer. One that I'll go to again for a nice summer drink or to remind me of summer."
"Gumballhead is the hoppiest American Pale Wheat Ale that I have consumed. Because of its higher hops, to me it is closer to an IPA [with an American Wheat base] than an American Pale Wheat Ale."
"Overall- i could drink this all day every day. If i could only drink one beer for the rest of my life, without a doubt, it would be this!"
"Drinkability - Damn drinkable and sessionable imo. Had this before and that is why I picked it up again. Good beer from a great brewery."
" Came damn close to getting a ""5" in this department, paired well with all the different foods at our table ,but could have easily drank this one solo for quite some time. If ya see it,grab it! CHOICE!!!!"
"D - This is my summer beer! It is perfect for a hot day hanging out by the pool..."
"D-good beer wasnt to bitter but not real sweet overall i really liked the beer I'm glad its a good Indiana beer since I'm from Indiana"
"Pours a clear, dark yellow color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of strong citrus hops, slight sweet malt, slight yeast, hint of citrus, and a hint of floral hops. Fits the style of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. There is a strong bitterness. Tastes of strong citrus hops, sweet malt, yeast, hint of wheat, hint of floral hops, and an odd (candy flavor). Overall, good aroma, feel, and body."
"highly drinkable, however I did notice the beer's carbonation on the throat as it went down. but for me, I always notice that with a good wheat beer. a great session beer that I could drink all day every day."
"Honestly, I could drink copious amounts of this beer. It is a pretty well balanced, yet light beer that has superb drinkability and kicks the crap out of BMC any day. Excellent for the summer."
"D - An excellent and unique beer and one that I would love to track down again."
"pours a pale, straw/orange with a frothy one finger off white head. smells of juicy orange hops that sting sweetly on the end of the nose. juicy and sweet from start to finish. mmm...amarillo by morning. the taste is orange rind sweetness that fades quickly to a bitter finish that lingers nicely. light bodied but not watery with a faint creaminess. this is my perfect summer beer. im not even going to use the ""S" word. don't want a thread to start."
"All in all, this is a delicious beer that hits all the right notes - with a crescendo of hops. Really, really enjoyed it."
"D: Very nice. I would drink this all day if it was available. I had this once before several months ago and didn't think much of it. But Justin hooked me up with a fresh sixer from the brewery and was very impressed."
"Thanks to Drew for tossing this in!"
"At first glance I was very dissapointed, little to no head or lacing. The hoppy smells got me excited again. This was a very solid Wheat for me, the extra hoppiness from the amirrilo hops is outstanding."
"Pours a yellowish cloudy golden with a thick frothy head that sticks around nicely. Very clean smell. Fresh cut grass with some pine and wheat notes. Some lemon or manderine orange is in there too. Wheat beers are usually not my favorite. I usually find them kind of bland with an aftertaste that doesn't do much for me. This beer has great flavor. There is a twang from the wheat that is blended nicely by a sweet toasty caramel flavor. Very nice pine and grapefruit bite at the finish reminded me somewhat of Seirra Nevada Pale Ale. Very nice crisp bitterness in this beer. More of thick creamy mouthfeel than you get from most wheats. I've heard about how good this stuff is for years, but this is the first time I've gotten around to try it. Good stuff. The other five bottles won't last long."
"Notes: Drinkability is definitely good. I could drink several of these, I only wish that I had that many to enjoy! For everyone who can get their hands on Gumballhead on a regular basis.... I am extremely jealous of you!"
"Extremely drinkable, a world class example of the style."
"Cheers!"
"Pours an nice golden orange colour with little head, well carbonated. Smells like grapefruit and lemon very citrusy with a little hop aroma behind it all. Tastes really good lots of citrus there with a sweet hop on the palate, very refreshing. Left almost no aftertaste probably the only downside of this beer, but that might be just my personal taste. Drinks really well overall. Would love to drink this again."
"D: Wheat beers are not my favorite, but this one is probably the best I've ever had. I think Anchor Summer is highly underrated, but this one is probably even better on a hot day. There is a lot more hops in this than I expected. Tastes a lot like a pale ale. Wheat is right there though to add that hay like flavor."
"Pours a medium golden, with a substantial head, that leaves about an inch of foam, and significant lacing. Aroma features an intense hops presence, with grapefruit/citrus notes very prominent. Taste features more hops/grapefruity intensity. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, and could benefit from more carbonation. The intensity of the hops in this beer is enjoyable, but it probably limits this beer's drinkability for those who prefer a more subtle approach."
"Seemed untraditional for a wheat beer, but wow this was tasty. My glass just disappeared. I will definitely pick this up again."
"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is strong resiny hops with some wheat mixed in. The flavor is resiny and piney with some wheat. Medium bitterness. This is basically an American India Wheat Ale and it is delicious. Slightly thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Overall a very refreshing hop forward beer that I would strain to call a wheat. That being said, it tastes good, and 3F has never been known for sticking to style."
"D - ...And another Three Floyds beer blows me away! I love this, especially since I just got home from a long, hot day at work. Crisp, refreshing, quaffable...absolutely the best Summer beer I've had. More please!"
"Pours an interesting yellow-orange hue into a perfect pint. Smell is hoppy with some wheat and a skunky sour apple undertone. Taste is dominated by what I'm guessing are summit hops then fades to a citrusy slightly wheaty taste. Mouthfeel is very smooth and a bit chewy. I could have a few of these."
"The key component of this beer is the carbonation. I've never noted how critical it was in the tasting of craft beer before today. Its departure and arrival into my glass ring in different experiences. Hell, if you weren't careful you may ruin this beer by deflating it too fast. There is no doubt in my mind that this beer is perfect for drinking regularly. I'd buy it again and again if there wasn't so much more to try in the world. The hype of a beer lived up to my expectations for once."
"D: Easy drinking and good taste and lots of hops. This is a hop delivery medium with some good wheat in the back. Nothing wrong here, except the appearance."
"D: Once it warmed up it tasted more like a Pale Ale and not a Wheat Pale. Very interesting and delicious! Goes down so smooth this could be a session beer and/or have a few of them in a night."
"D: Chuggable. It's no mistake that this is the highest rated American Pale Wheat Ale on Beeradvocate."
"Thanks Corey for sending me this one. This will be the closest I get to Sheffields in Chicago this year after spending 4 hours or so in the bleachers. I'll miss the 8 or so Gumballheads at Sheffields this week, but I will still feel that I was there by having this."
"It is very drinkable and refreshing. If you ever find yourself in the Chicago area pick yourself up a 6pck or find a bar that offers a pint. This is one worth trying."
"Cheers!"
"The fact that this is a wheat beer blows my mind. This is the one beer that truly builds up to the hype that surrounds it. Best wheat beer ever is a complete understatement. When I smelt this beer A smile came on my face and I was content with just sniffing it all night but then came the taste. I felt like I was punched in the face with the most intense hops of a strong IPA until they mellowed out and I was left with one of the most pleasant tastes ever. Hook me up to an IV of this and I'll be good forever. Three floyds please distribute in Ohio again because I will be honest, I hate going to Indiana. It is the flattest drive and bores me. We are good neighbors and your beer should probably come over the border in an easier manner."
"D - I could drink this all day every day and be more than happy."
"D- Incredibly drinkable... nay... quaffable!! I could easily put a 6-pack of this down in a sitting... and it's f-ing addicting! Do they put crack in this beer!?"
"Drinkability: Its alright. Basically this is your average brewpubs pale ale being called a american pale wheat ale. Nothing great."
"Poured a cloudy golden sparkling color with a very minimal head. Very strong hop aromas on this brew. A whole lot of fruitiness as well. Not just citrus fruits either. I'm picking up a lot of grapes and apple scents. The taste is definitely fruity. I get a lot of green grapes and apples on my palate, along with some very subtle hops. I nice sweet, fruity taste lingers on the back of my tongue. The mouthfeel is very delightful with a very crisp and refreshing bite. Extremely drinkable. Great summertime beer."
"I obtained a 12 ounce bottle from enelson. I poured into a weizen glass, hazy yellow with a sticky 2 finger white head. Lots of floral hops on the aroma. The beer is floral and fruity, very assertive hopping. It finishes with a lingering fruitiness. It was light in body, and high in carbonation. This worked for me, it drinks more like a APA than a wheat beer."
"This is interestingly hoppy for a wheat beer. Very solid."
"Light to medium gold, sediment in the bottom of the bottle, moderate head, lots of carbonation. Lemon, citrus grapefruit all in one, yum yum. Light crip, lemony grapefruit. finishes clean. Super summer beer. Full of flavor without any heaviness. I could really put these down. Edit: the more I drank this there were peach undertones that started to come out."
"D - a wonderfully executed hoppy wheat ale. both light bodied and dangerously drinkable, yet full flavored, unique, and delicious. i would buy this by the case if it was readily available."
"Overall, a very good summer beer. I enjoyed this quite a bit and would recommend it as a beer to have on hand in the warmer months if you have access."
"Incredibly drinkable. I would definitely session this... if only 3F's were distributed in California."
"D-this is a hugely drinkable wheat beer but more like an ipa. ftons of hops with a light note of wheat. the acetone in the finish is a little off putting but the hops are huge."
"d - A pretty good wheat ale. Very easy to drink and enjoyable floral and citrus hops. Would try again."
"Really an impressive wheat beer from this obviously very talented brewery."
"Comments: Thanks goes out to dvelcich! He sent this beer to me as an extra in a trade. A hoppy wheat beer, certainly not conventional. Nonetheless, an interesting experimentation within the style."
"Notes: Highly Recommended. Thanks Bliss in Wauconda, IL for the great singles selection."
"Pours a golden colour with thick head that left some lacing. The smell of hops immediately hit me before I even lift the glass. It still has the smell of a wheat beer, just with a lot of hops in it. The taste is wonderfully refreshing, with the hop bitterness combining with the banana and lemon of the wheat beer. Wonderful to drink and I wish I could have had more than one."
"I have a housewarming party coming up and this will be the keg I choose! A GREAT summer beer..."
"A very solid beer. Not outstanding, but very good."
"D: Big time. Super easy to drink, way too fast. This and New Glarus Crack'd Wheat are twins, seprated at birth. I did a side-by tasting of the two, and they were SO close, I had a tough time choosing what beer was what."
"The great nose, flavors and thin mf make this one of the (if not the) most drinkable beers on the market today. I would rate this higher than a 5 if possible!"
"M/D: Light and prickly mouthfeel, highly refreshing. I could drink this all day.."
"Mouthfeel: Light but coats the mouth; Very sessionable, I enjoyed a few of these while watching the cubs on TV a few blocks from Wrigley field."
"The head is nice and tall and the body is slightly hazy and a shade darker in the golden color spectrum. crisp hops up front that fade considerably, toasted biscuits, light tropical fruits, mango orange juice. more viscosity and not as dry as expected for the style, enjoyable non the less. easy drinking especially when the hot midwest summer months roll around, will probally be buy a few packs over the summer."
"This was a very crisp and refreshing drink. My wife's comment was that this would be good with barbecue and I think she hit the nail on the head. If you brought some of this to your next outdoor dinner with friends, I believe it would go over well in spades."
"Light golden amber with a one-finger head which quickly settled to a coating. Lacing was thin but lasting. Nose was lemon zest, wheat and floral, with a sweet bready undertone. Good carbonation. Taste follows the nose. Hops are there and up front like an APA or IPA but they are quickly beaten back by the malty sweetness. The aftertaste remains sweet but with a nice dry finish. Mouthfeel was smooth, thin and pleasantly sticky. At a little over 4%, this beer is definitely sessionable. Yep, already I want more..."
"D - This is a brew I could drink all day long in the Summertime. FFF outdid themselves brewing this one, and I wish it was more readily available in my area. I will certainly be recommending this to my friends!"
"Would have given it another .5 if didn't have to deal with the hassle of getting the beer."
"D: was kinda flat for the style but I always enjoy a FFF beer. Overall had a good nose and a decent flavor. Wouldn't mind having some more."
"D - Amazing. Seriously, I could drink this all day without getting tired of it. Easily the best American Wheat beer I've had. Too bad Three Floyds beers aren't available anywhere close to here."
"D: The best (although I may be hop-biased) wheat beer I've had to date. Great summer beer. Easy drinking and leaves you wanting more."
"d- Goes down very very easy. I imagine a six pack of this could be killed quite easily. I'll let you know how it goes..."
"D- Seemed pretty easy to drink, not my favorite style but I'd probably pick up another if I ever come across it again."
"Uber refreshing, delicious, low in ABV, and goes down like water. This beer IS drinkability."
"D: Definition of a session beer. Could put back quite a few on a hot summer day. Overall I really don't think it lives up to the hype of one of the best wheat beers out there."
"Pours a very pale orange with a fluffy 2-finger white head. Eventually a ring, leaves barely any lacing. Quite a bit of sediment floats in a standstill. Although this looks like a pretty typical pale wheat, the smell and taste is anything but. Lots of fresh, fruity hops, orange peel, and pine. The taste is excellent, I'm getting citrus, pine and lemon. Nice caramel malt and an amount hops that could be sufficient for an IPA, I'm already getting hop burps after a few sips. If you're really looking for a wheat taste you will probably be disappointed, I'm not getting any until the end, a nice fruity wheat finish. Gumballhead is easily a stand-out in a usually dull style, there is so much flavor and body here for a 4.8% beer. SO drinkable. Drinkability is through the roof, I finished this very quickly and enjoyed every second of it. This may be the ultimate session beer, if I ever am in their distribution area I will try to pick up a case of it. Three Floyds is definitely solid in my book right now. Thanks to sportscrazed2 for sending this out my way."
"D: Very high drinkabilty! I think this beer is perfect for any occasion! This is the beer that got me into craft beer, so i'll be drinking this one till the end. Always stocked in my fridge!"
"Medium-bodied, slightly fizzy up front but finishes smooth and malty with a banana aftertaste. Pretty good and a nice transition brew from the megas to real beers."
"D- Unlike any wheat brew I have ever tried. It's EASILY my favorite. Might not be the poster beer for the style, however, it's 10x better than any wheat I've had before. This would def be a go to brew for me! I could drink this all day!!! PERFECT 5 here!"
"Great beer! The hoppy wheat thing works perfectly here! Poured with a nice fine foamy frothy off white head and good lace. Color is a clear amber. Aroma is malty hoppy and fruity. Flavor's similar. Body is excellent ditto carbonation. Finish is a tad sweet but very well balanced. Very drinkable. Session beer."
"D. High drinkability here. Nice complexity too for its measly 4.8% ABV. If this stuff was a couple bucks cheaper a 6-pack, it would have a permanent spot in my fridge during the summer. I need to do a side-by-side comparison between this and NG's Crack'd Wheat for fun."
"Amazingly refreshing and clean, the ultimate session beer, along with Weihenstephaner Hefeweiss, and I can only imagine this to be the best tailgate beer. My only regret is living outside of the FFF distribution range."
"D - This is damn drinkable... I only wish I had a second."
"The flavor pops amarillo, piney and citrusy hop notes with a background of caramel malt. The finish has floral notes, lingering bitterness (a bit out of place for a wheat, again) and somewhat dry cookielike malt finish too. This is one of those beers that in a BJCP competition would totally flunk out of the style guidelines, but I can't really hold that against it because this is a delicious beer. The mouthfeel has a bit of that milkshake thickness from the wheat with a prickly carbonation that isn't quite spritzy. The wheat adds good body for this sessionable brew. Drinkability is very high, flavorful, very hoppy, not palatewrecking, though intense for something in this category. I'll go ahead and call it a good thing though."
"D - Very easy to drink. I could get used to this...if I lived where this was distributed. Great sessionable beer."
"Overall, the Gumballhead drinks like some kind of hybrid between a wheat ale and an American pale ale. The hop flavor and aroma don't overpower, though, but merely makes you stop and think about what you are drinking."
"D - This just doesn't have enough flavor for me, way to light tasting, it is nice and refreshing but definitely want more flavor."
"M/D- light bodied, good hearty carbonation make this beer one that would be great to enjoy on a nice hot summer day. one of the tastier wheat beers i've had. truely enjoyed."
"D - This is an amazingly drinkable beer. Hops are crisp and bitter sitting on top of soft malt flavors. The nice lemony touches really round things out. Extremely smooth and easy drinking, goes down as easy as water...perfect craft beer for spring yard work. Excellent."
"Definitely a beer to pour cold into a cold glass on a HOT day. I dare say it is the most ""refreshing"" beer I have ever experienced."
"D= I rated this beer as a session beer and it would make a wonderful one at that. Citrus and yeast make this beer a wonderful beer for the summer time. Great job FFF"
"Overall: A pleasant take on an American wheat beer. God, light citrus and hop flavor 	plays well with the wheat malt. I really enjoy the use of Amarillo hops."
"Notes - I wish FFF distributed here because I would consider keeping this in my fridge all the time."
"D/O- Wheats generally aren't my favorite but I could definitely imbibe on this and only this on a summer night in the not-to-distant future. Will drink again...thanks for the beer John!"
"Drinkability - I love this beer, I wish it made it to New York. Thank god I travel for work and I will pick this up for then and now everytime I am in Chi Town!"
"D: Incredibly refreshing. Remarkably crisp and clean throughout. A superb Pale Wheat Ale that I look forward to diving into this summer."
"Easy drinking and refreshing. Well made wheat beer."
"Drinkability: I could see myself drinking a ton of these on a warm summer day. Hell I would drink this beer anytime of the year, very refreshing!"
"D: Very drinkable ,Like I said would never leave but to get more grains ,hops ,yeast.3 Floyds always a quality brew."
"D: A very unique wheat beer that exhibits a lot of creativity in my opinion. Gumballhead succeeds because of its high drinkability and because even though, the flavors are quite experimental, they work well and are not overpowering. Worth seeking out though I'm not sure how I'm gonna get my hands on another of these."
"YESS finally Three Floyds Gumballhead! This beer so many people have told me about for such a long time. ""Dude this is the best beer"" "Man you have to try this beer"". Honestly it was good, not great. For a beer it sort-a threw a curve ball. The nose was strong Hops like an IPA, and then you take a sip of this and realize that it is a wheat beer. Sweet notes take over then the hops come back for a nice visit at the end. Good beer, and as the bottle says ""its not normal."" Worth a try if you can land a bottle, GREAT SUMMER BEER!"
"SkÅL!"
"This makes for a great warm weather beer you can drink all day and into the evening, ideally on your front porch. If you have access to this beer and love pale ales, don't deny yourself. This is another winner from Three Floyds."
"Golden haze, more gold than haze mind you. It's floral, candy, sunshine, first loves and progress in a bottle form. The hops are big but sweet somehow, like a fine honeydew melon ripening in the sun. The wheat hits at the end, coating my mouth in a sensual slippery grain. It's delightful, the taste and smell of a hoppy pale, the finish of a wheat. Dangerous when you get close, but cute enough to bring home to mother."
"Overall a good beer but I didn't get as much of a citrus/fruit flavor from the hops are the brewers describe."
"Pours out a hazy golden orange, small head with light thin lacing as it dissipates. Smells of citrus and hops and i noticed a fruit juice aroma after a few drinks. Not a strong smell at all. Tastes very good with the hops dominant over the wheat and yeast in a nicely balanced presentation. Much hoppier than other wheat ales. Light, tart mouthfeel with an amazingly good drinkability. 3 Floyds has taken a wheat ale and kicked it up a notch! I am glad that this is readily available to me!"
"Mouthfeel is light and it has moderate to above average carbonation. Drinkability is very good, I found it to be a very tasty and easy drinking beer with a lot of flavor. Would definitely buy this again."
"(d) I could drink pint after pint growler after growler of this stuff. Find a place with it on draft and never leave. (5/5)"
"Drinkability: Three Floyds, how I love thee beer. Another winner. I'll be picking up a six pack of this in the Summer."
"D: This is what I would call a great session beer. There is a lot of flavor for a low ABV beer. I will definitely be looking to get my hands of more of these come spring time. My first Three Floyd's beer, looking forward to trying more in the future"
"Libation: A very nice, very interesting hoppy beer, but not one I'd offer to someone looking for a wheat beer itself. True to form, Three Floyd's has made this beer far from style, but that doesn't take anything away from the great flavors, low 4.8% ABV, and the fact that I'll be back whenever I'm looking for a quality sessionable summer beverage."
"Thanks again Dan, I hope to trade with you again in the future!"
"The question is can I drink it? Sure, and I can have a lot. It tastes OK but not good and definitely not great. I don't mind boatloads of hops, just keep them away from wheats."
"Good crisp body to this. Finishes with a soft mellow smoothness. Flavor is hoppy at the onset. Some grapefruit notes, and pine. Not too bitter though. Finishes bready and warm. There's the wheat! Without that finish I would swear this is a mild IPA. Three Floyds has a nice take on this style. I could drink this all the time if I had better access. Recommend."
"Deep yellow haze with some clarity,wheaty floral head,solid citrus slightly pine aroma,this is a perfect example of FFF take on a wheat beer,This is the beer I could drink many of on a hot summer day,this beer will pair with most foods and never overpower"
"Drinkability: High. This ale should satisfy a number of enthusiasts' appetites. Wheat, hops, fruit. What's not to like."
"d- this reminds me a lot of sam adams summer ale. take that as you may... thats not a bad thing, BUT i was expecting a little bit more from three floyds. pretty average and thats about it."
"Drinkability:This seems pretty close to an ideal summer sessionable beer. Definitely a beer you buy 6 of instead of a single. This beer smelled nothing short of great, and I loved how a thin head stuck around all the way down on this. I'd probably get another six of this sometime in the summer, overall i wouldn't go out of my way for this myself though. Just the extremely sweet scent made the subtle flavors pale in comparison a bit too much."
"Drinkability - I could drink these all day, easily, the only problem would be the drive to get them, about 30 minutes, but a 6 pack could easily be drank in a sitting or within a few hours. The abv is right for it too."
"Has a hazy gold color with a white one finger head with decent retention. Smells of hops, lemon, and some orange. The taste is surprisingly sweeter than I expected. The hops come through, but are balanced by the sweetness, and the lemon and orange flavors. Light to medium bodied, smooth, and nicely carbonated. A nice sessionable beer that I would buy again."
"This is my new favorite beer for sitting back a drinking a few."
"Thanks BigBry for this nice discovery!"
"Smell of hops, musky and sweet. Good clear golden pour and a slight head. Extremely nice hop character for a wheat beer. Bitter hop profile in the beer with a citrus/sap finish. Nice crisp carbonation very smooth. Nice to sit and drink to quench the thirst on a hot summer day."
"D: This would be a nice one for the summer months. A refreshing beer, no doubt, and low alcohol would make this a staple in my fridge (could I easily attain it)."
"This beer is super smooth. I love it. The hop flavor is nice, citrus and sweet. There is some wheaty characteristics that come up at the end, the overall bitterness is rather mild but really good. Mouthfeel, medium body good palate connectivity, and drinkability is really high."
"Gumballhead is a beer I hadn't had in a long time, as it is no longer imported into the state of Iowa. It was one of the first beers I remember liking when I was in college, one of the first beers I drank for the taste rather than any other sort of effect. It pours out as kind a straw color, easily identifiable as an American wheat style beer. However, you will notice immediately upon the first sniff that this is no ordinary beer. Strong citrus and fruit smells are present. The taste carries through with this promise, as grapefruit, possibly apricot, and of course wheat combine for a complex and satisifying experience. I was glad to see that even after having many other high quality beers since I had last enjoyed Gumballhead, it still holds up."
"D: This beer screams summertime IMO. I also imagine this beer has a gigantic audience because it's drinkability, probably a commercial success for the 3F boys. The ABV makes putting another one down a laughable challenge."
"Gumballhead is pretty light on the tongue with a slightly watery texture and very subdued carbonation. I felt the beer was a decent representation of an American Wheat, but honestly it doesn't hold a candle to NG's Crack'd Wheat (which I consider an American Wheat even though it's fermented with Hefe yeast). I don't think I'll pick up anymore, not when I have a tastier and easier to find American Wheat option right in my own backyard. Not to mention there is ABSOLUTELY NO REASON this should cost $11 a six-pack."
"D - Its a shame I can't get this more easily, as it would easily replace all my regulars as my go to beer."
"Purchased at Discount Liquors in Milwaukee, WI. Pours a hazy, golden body with a thin white head. Aroma is of spicy citrus hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a spicy high carbonation level. The hop flavors dominate and really cover up the wheat flavors for me. Very good, but a not very balanced. I'd have this one again though."
"Thanks goes out to Immy for hooking a brother up! Sparkling gold, topped by a fizzy white head, which lasts a while, and leaves some pretty nice lacing. Scads of grapefruit and hops in the aroma. Mild pine aromas as well. Bitter hops and cirtus flavours, orange rind acidity, semi sweet malt to balance out the bitterness. Pretty damn good. Crisp and refreshing. Thanks again TIm!"
"This is like no othe pale wheat ale I have ever had. From the pour till the last drop is resting in my stomach, it far exceeded my expectations of wheat beers. Has a clear golden color with a large head that had good retention. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. Wonderful hop aroma of citrus fruit, such as grapefruit and oranges. Also a touch of bubblegum which is odd since there is no yeast left in the beer. The flavor features the hops without all the bitterness. Grapefruit, pineapple, and tangerines all tantalize the tastebuds. Bitterness is detectable but low. Under 20 IBUs if I was to guess. Not much if any wheat malt is detected so it is not perfect. Has a bigger body than others in the style and carbonation is bubbly without being harsh. Wonderful to drink in the summer or any season for that matter. Nice sessionable ABV. The one major nitpick I have for this great beer is the price at over $11 for a six pack. Ouch."
"I want to taste this and Oberon side by side on a hot summer day to get a better feel for which one I'd put as my favorite wheat ale."
"Pours a very light pale color and just slightly hazy...I was expecting more from a wheat ale. The smell was definitely the highlight of this beer for me...A hopped up wheat is something new for me, but I love amarillo hops, and the smell is quite enjoyable. For all the good things I've heard about this beer, I was kind of let down by the taste. I was expecting alot of flavor, but got just a dry wheat flavor with little hop taste... Too light for my tastes. This beer is drinkable for sure, but I'm looking for a little more flavor in my wheat beers."
"But this is some nice stuff...like I said before pours a medium clear gold with a little bit a floaties not much though, has white head sticks around for a bit. The carbonation will stick to the sides of the glass a bit. Cool. Smells like grapfruit hops then if you sniff hard enough the clove and wheat smell you were expecting. Taste hops to start with gum bananna clove and to boot some wheat. Pretty nice indeed. (Indeed!) So I like this stuff k, But I will try not to buy much since I will drink it all in one night...and its not local...top notch overall"
"Mouthfeel may have been less than I was originally expecting, but my ""clones"" were a higher abv. The watery thinness adds to drinkability and I my friends would drink more of these."
"D: Easy drinking, but the sensational aroma isn't as apparent after two beers. It's expensive, so I tend to stop at two and wait a day for my mouth to rest and relive the first beer experience."
"Drinkability: Very tasty and refreshing. I will look for this again. This is not overly hoppy, but hops are present. It tastes different from other wheat beers, but i cannot peg the taste."
"D- With the low abv and the refreshingness of this beer, it is very high. I am a big fan of this beer and can see what all the hype surrounding this one is all about. If you have a chance to try it, do so and you won't be disappointed."
"Good on drinkability. Could easily handle several of these in one sitting."
"D: Sessionability to the max. This would be a great tailgating beer and a good one to give to people who are not hugely into craft."
"Really hard to believe that this checks in below 5%. This would make a nice session beer for hopheads. Really light, yet flavorful. Would be awesome to drink on warm summer days."
"D: Solid brew indeed. I wish I could get this beer locally. Its unique and drinkable, a great combination."
"This is an India Wheat Ale. Super hoppy flavors/aromas refreshing. Great for warm weather."
"Smell is of citrusy hops, like an IPA. Taste is very interesting, not overly hoppy, but there is an interesting tangy flavor. Perhaps some lemon? Carbonation is slightly high and maybe contributing to this. A little late for this, but could definitely have been a summer scorcher beer. Will have to be on the lookout for this if I ever head out into the distribution area. Really a unique beer to me."
"Bottle to pint glass. Pours a light golden color with a small white head. Has ok retention which leaves decent lacing down the side of the glass. The smell is wheaty and hoppy right away. I can get some lemon in there too. Overall kind of a sweet smell. The taste is good. Wheaty yet hoppy. Some lemon and citrus is in the taste, not over powering though. Goes down smooth. Don't know what to really say about this one. Wheat ales and pale wheat ales aren't really my thing, I have my favorites and regulars I pick up from time to time and usually stick by those. This is one I can easily say I'll pick up more often. Very drinkable and low ABV makes it one I could drink all night. Overall just another great beer from Three Floyds."
"I almost wish it was warm outside drinking this, I can see how this would be a great summer session beer. It's about 30 outside, and this is still doing it's job. A great beer, no matter the weather. Thanks Don for the chance!"
"D - A fantastic wheat w/ a great amount of flavor- hoppy, yet clean w/ lemony bright citrus and just highly drinkable qualities. The beer is so easy to drink at 4.8%, with such quaffability. I could drink this year round if only it were available."
"This beer drank pretty easy, and I could see me drinking it more often if it were readily available. A good beer for a quick hop fix."
"D - Very refreshing wheat with a great hop kick."
"D: Can easily put back numerous of these in one sitting..."
"D - A stellar session beer with wonderfully complexity in all facets... A only wish this was available to me on a regular basis.... This beer lived up to the lofty expectations the BA world has bestowed upon it..."
"D: Unsurpassed drinkability. This is one that I wouldn't mind loading up with several cases of to drink throughout the warmer months, and I plan to do just that next year."
"D - Extremely drinkable and sessionable. Could have one after another without a problem. Not overwhelmingly flavorful, which is not a bad thing, when its delicious as it is."
"this was perfect. shared this with family and it was a hit. as noted above, this had a bit more bitterness that made this much much better than the bottle version im used to."
"Notes: Not my favorite pale wheat ale, but a nice beer with good hop aroma and flavor from three floyds. Definitely has their characteristics in it. The aroma may be one of my favorites for this style. Definitely worth a try and worth buying when you want a lighter flavorful beer."
"Very drinkable. This is a great ""Intro to bitter"" beer for those looking to explore beyond their thin American Pilseners. Not tongue splitting or overpowering in any department, yet manages to be very flavorful, complex, and most importantly sessionable."
"Not exactly what I would expect from a wheat beer, but very enjoyable. I will definatately put this into my regular rotation. Kudos to Three Floyds"
"This is probably the best American Wheat I've ever had. Pours golden yellow, slightly hazy with thick and creamy white head. Great retention and lacing. Smell was strong of hops, which surprised me and well as a lemon citrus with some spice. Taste is citrusy, slightly sweet and fruity and a nice grassy, bitter hops. Smooth and light, leaves a bitter aftertaste. Overall a great beer and good example of the style. Would love to try fresh on tap!"
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with a nice bite of carbonation."
"Bought a 6 on my latest trip to Chicago. Poured to a golden orange with thin white head that lingered awhile and left okay lacing. Nose was an interesting mix of hoppy citrus fruits, ilke an IPA and a cookie dough-banana wheat. Mouthfeel was slightly bitter, yet full, and the tate resembled the flavors found in the nose. Although I agree with other raters that it's hard to call this a straight wheat beer, it was nonetheless a darn good summer cooler."
"Final thoughts: I'm about 3/4 of the way through his beer already just reviewing it and sipping, sipping, sipping. This is probably the best session beer I can think of and a wicked unique experience. ALl the interesting flavors meld together very well, I'm surprised this beer hasn't been rated higher, perhaps people are looking for a huge bitter beer, or its just too unique for them. I think this beer is completely misunderstood. I've also only had a few FFF beers so far, and I'm a big fan. Their level of experimentation and consistency on great beers seems to remind me a lot of Dogfish Head. Keep on truckin you magnificent bastards."
"D - Quite drinkable, almost a session beer, but I think the citris would get to me after a few."
"M/D - This is an exceedingly easy drinker for just about every season. The mouthfeel is rich, but it doesn't fill and coat the mouth."
"The color was a fuzzy gold with a moderate head that had little retention. The aroma was lemon, but had that wheaty/naner-naner smell too. The taste was a crisp, refreshing, lemony tang. Light bodied with moderate carbonation. The drinkability was very good. Love the bad-ass cat."
"Ok all around. More of a second string for me, though. I'd like to try it on tap. Mild alcohol makes it sessionable. Gumballhead seems to age pretty quickly; get if fresh if you can."
"D - another nice brew from 3 floyds that I could easily drink a lot of."
"The wheat beers I've experienced all vary...and this one seem to stand out as a more drinkable variety...I really like what Three Floyds has created here. a hoppy wheat beer, but decently balanced and quite drinkable. This is a beer I could cuddle up to all night."
"Mf and drink-crisp finish = drinkable beer , low abv , maybe a session beer , light to medium feel that is enjoyable to swish around in my mouth."
"This poured a slightly hazy bright gold with a bit of white head. It smelled like fresh peaches and persimmons, with some grassy hops and fresh wheat and wild onions. It tasted like unripe peaches, with wild onion and fresh wheat and honey. It was watery with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a strange beer. It didn't taste as sugary sweet as the name suggests. It was clean and mostly enjoyable, with decent body, so it was pretty easy to drink. This beer was fun to try once, but I have no real interest in ever having it again. And I really don't understand the hype over it - this is a B+ beer at best. If you want an exceptional American Wheat Ale, try Little Sumpin' Sumpin'."
"Thanks Rhoadsrage on a awesome trade! I have been wanting to try this one for quite some time and missed it when it was in Ohio. Poured into a wheat glass pours a yellow red with a fluffy head that leaves nice lace on the glass. Smell is exceptional with citrus, tangerine, pear, orange, beautiful smelling beer. Taste is very impressive with low carbonation and a smooth taste of hops that are not overpowering but sweet and done right. Malt finish on the backend and a high drinkability. Overall this was a very impressive beer and one that went higher than my expectations. I have never been dissapointed with Three Floyds, can't wait to make a trip to the brewpub."
"D- For a beer with a big hop flavor, it is very drinkable. Hmm to bad this isn't available in Massachusetts, because I'd be capable of drinking these even when it's 95 degrees out."
"I can see how this would be enjoyed by many people and in great quantities, most likely. On a warm summer day, I could probably even drink a few of them. Maybe."
"D: As this is a quite refreshing beer, it is quite easy to drink, especially in the warmer months. I can say this is one of my favorite wheat beers, though that is probably because this is one of the least wheat beer-like wheat beers I've had. High in hops, low in fruity esters."
"D: If I lived in a state that Three Floyds was distributed to, I would buy this anytime I saw the thermometer creeping upward."
"Drinkability: It's definitely a low ABV thirst-quencher, but to call it a true wheat beer, even an American wheat, is almost a stretch of the definition. It tastes more like some saaz-hopped pilsners or APAs I've had than anything else. While an unfair comparison due to the ABV, an American wheat like Lagunitas Little Sumpin' Sumpin' blows it away while having many of the same features."
"Notes: Out of the three, I enjoy Lagunitas Sumpin' Sumpin' more, and Bell's Oberon comes in third."
"The drinkability is exceptional. Perfect summer beer, I wish I could get this regularly."
"D: Goes down very easy on a hot day. Not as heavy as some APAs, but has a lot of the same characteristics. A very good beer, I wish I could get this in KY. Thanks Jason!!"
"Nice hazy golden color with a big 2 finger fluffy head. Taste is nice and wheaty, with a bit of breat and yeast. Taste is somewhat light a good amount of carbonation. Sweet and tame. Overall a very solid wheat beer and I would seek it out if I was in the midwest!"
"This is one of my favorite main stay beers. I love they hoppiness of Three Floyds beers and this is a great example of a well balanced array of flavors. The beer is a refreshing wheat beer with a zesty hoppy after taste. This is a beer that I can enjoy several pints without getting bored/overwhelmed with the taste or feel full and bloated."
"D: Bring on the summer heat and the bbq's! This is the one to break out on your ipa loving friends who claim wheat beers belong in Europe. Very drinkable, crisp, wonderful wheat beer characteristics, but a nice presence of hops! Loved this one as it is 85 outside!"
"D--This is what summer beer drinking is all about. This is a beer for everyone to enjoy, if you are looking for something to bring to a barbecue that your macro loving friends will enjoy then look no further than Gumballhead. Nice bottle art also. Three Floyds does everything right."
"overall,a really nice summer beer.would make a great session beer.it sucks that i have to go to indiana to buy this."
"Thanks to heliosphann for sending me my first bottle of Gumballhead! Cheers!"
"This is a great summer sessional beer that I could drink all night a long."
"Pours a rich golden colour. Opaque and murky. Lots of yeast and some floaty sediment thingys. Moderate head, with nice lacing. The head stuck around for half the beer. Very hoppy aroma, high notes of citrus. Tastes of yummy hops and lemon hangings around for a little bit. Very tasty. Perfectly carbonated. Bites to the end. I could drink this all afternoon."
"D - great summer beer. Has the lightness of a wheat ale with a hop kick to it...very delicious. I just wish I had regular access to this brew."
"very light with a good bit of carbonation. a very good summer brew. unique, but nothing that blew me away."
"I finally got to enjoy this beer this weekend at Murphy's outside Wrigley. A fresh keg to boot. I talked my whole group into getting one so we could ""talk about it"" It poured a bit more yellow then I anticipated but I'm not a stickler on color. I got a slight fruity aroma with lemon and pine needles. The head was intense and lasted for the first couple sips. The flavor was very earthy with hints of grass and plenty of lemon. Not as sweet as some wheats I've had but still nice. The carbonation was present with a nice bite on the wash down. I had a few more after my initial so I can say this beer has a great drinkabilty."
"Draft. A darker yellow pour, some white head. Smell is quite floral, citrus, banana and pine. Good carbonation to off set the sticky nature of a wheat beer. Taste matches the aroma, a constant battle of sweet wheat malt, fruits and hops. The over hops for a wheat make this pleasant and drinkable. One of the different/better wheat brews I've had."
"Poured a golden straw color with a nice thick off white head. Has a large 2-3 finger head that lowered to about a finger quickly and had noticeable lacing. Aroma has a nice hoppy citrus smell with a little lemon and grapefruit. The aroma is one of the most impressive qualities of this beer as it lingers the entire time it's drank. Tastes clean and balanced, not malty and has a slight bitterness. I would drink this everyday. Would love to homebrew a clone to keep around the house during the summer. If you couldn't decide between a nice moderately hoppy pale ale or a good wheat beer, this is definitely the beer for you."
"Pours a hazy straw yellow color, with a massive white head. Leaves beautiful lacing from the wispy pillowy foam that floats on top, a very nice looking beer. The smell is almost pure amarillo hops, pure, raw and delicious really. I mean, there's a bit of grassiness, a kind of skunkiness, maybe some tartness - very leafy and floral. There is also a hint of pale malt and wheat sweetness. This smells as advertised, though if you were expected a wheat beer, you would be thrown off. The taste isn't quite as floral or leafy as the smell, there's not a lot of bitterness, which is good, not too much on the resin front, but the taste is of tart cherries, oranges, grapefruit, though lacking acerbic rind taste. The malts kind of provide a kind of fruit soda taste, like berries or plums, but the balance is actually quite nice. There is just a hint of some leafy, grassy hops, which is nice in some applications, but I'm not sure I wanted here. Good mouthfeel, light and crisp, a nice bite of carbonation, and the wheat provides just enough body, when combined with the resinous hops, to make this a very pleasant delivery. This beer drinks very well, and is very enjoyable. The relatively low ABV is nice in the afternoon, and this is one I could stick with for a while. It drinks very well right through the middle, and except for the tiny bit of overdone grassiness in the finish, an excellent beer. A beer that you must try out of novelty at least."
"Poured to about a 1 inch head. Had some nice big bubbles. Head was slightly offwhite in color. Beer was a cloudy yellow. Head didnt hand around very long, but left some lacing with every drink. Smelled of grapefruit, piney hops, very citrusy. Smelled good. Had a stong citrus grapefruit flavor. Also that pine flavor going on. Slightly sweet. Maybe a hair bitter aftertaste. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was about right. At 4.8 alcohol, you could make this a good session beer. FFF makes some good stuff."
"Drinkability is insane, one bottle was not enough, it is so good I and low abv and smoothness makes me just want to drink this all afternoon on the back porch. Summer beer of the year this year for sure!"
"Very unique to the style...definitely not normal by any means. A great summer staple in Indiana, and if you are ever given the opportunity to have this on tap, take it. It's even better on tap."
"The beer is light bodied with good carbonation"
"D= extremely high. This is a very fine wheat beer and I would highly reccomend it to anyone."
"when I tried it."
"D - exellent beer, great in the summer, but i could see myself drinking this one anytime really. (that is if 3floyd's showed Colorado more love, oh well)"
"Cheers Bry!"
"Thanks again Dave for the great trade and the great beers. You are a champ!"
"D: Limitless."
"Overall I found this to be a very interesting beer. Original and inventive. I figure the funky package has helped with the success of the beer. Hipsters probably gravitate towards the cartoon character smoking a cigarette on the label. Nice beer, good for a session or two."
"D: Very easy to drink. If I could get this where I live, I'd have it almost every day. Stupid PA."
"It's crazy drinkable. I've downed it pretty quick trying to understand it. It's a very neat beer and, as I come to terms with what this beer is, I'm very pleased with this Three Floyds selection. Many thanks to mynie for providing this selection. It's a really unique wheat beer. I may have gotten a little ahead of myself embracing the look and the smell, but it's undoubtedly an enjoyable beer."
"D: Pretty good, though I think this beer is way too hoppy for a wheat.. I appreciate the style, and creating something different, but if I wanted hops, I would get an IPA. ( and on a side note, not worth the hype.)"
"D: Wish we could get this around here. This is a great warm weather drinker. With the low abv and high taste this has session written all over it."
"Future outlook: Good. One of the more interesting/pleasing wheat beers I've encountered."
"Highly drinkable with the body."
"D :: I could drink this often especially on a warm day. I sat down this evening and wished I was out mowing the grass just to enjoy this in the warm weather."
"D- Great session beer here. Delicious and nothing that will kill your palate."
"Overall I've been wanting to try this one for a while and it did not disappoint. Certainly not a traditional wheat ale but definitely worth a try."
"Maybe the best american wheat I've had this one is really quite nice. Highly recommended to anyone."
"D - ya kiddin? absolutely... this stands up to just about any pale ale out there. this beer is very light and enjoyable, it may be pretty expensive but this beer is definitely worth it every once in a while. Great warm weather brew!"
"Had this on tap the night before DLD 2009. I remember it having a bit better flavor profile and highly suggest you have it at the brewery if you can. Overall, a great summer beer that I could drink all day."
"Overall, this was a good beer and fairly well balanced. I could see how many people like it and I do think it competes, but it definitely not what I would usually drink."
"D-Without question one of the most flavourful, refreshing and delicious sub 5% ABV brew out there. I wish I could make Gumballhead my go to summer beer. But alas I have to enjoy random 6'er when my travels take me westward! Kudos to FFF for concocting such a fine beverage."
"D - This is a HIGH drinkability beer. I've been a huge fan of Sam Adams Summer Ale but this beer has surpassed it as my new fave."
"D- Bring on some more!"
"an amazing wheat beer!..it pours a light straw color with an outstanding head..the smell is hops and spice and floral citrus..unlike any wheat beer ive ever had it has a huge hop presence for a wheat with nice rounded out malts it hits it spot on.. the taste is outstanding its subtle wheat meets hops and malt in a perfect blend this is such a perfectly balanced brew i could drink 3 in row quickly no problem im not a huge wheat beer fan but im a huge gumball fan again this is unlike any wheat beer ive ever tried .. highly recommended"
"One of my first FFF offerings. I was not disappointed. This beer is awesome. It looks like a run of the mill wheat. Lively carbonation, yellow in color. The aroma was awesome. All hops. I wasn't sure what to expect .... The taste was epic. All wheat with a nice hoppy finish. Extremely drinkable. Wonderful session beer. No overly sweet flavors, no banana or clove or coriander just a straightforward kick ass brew."
"Very east to drink and I want to try more to male sure my palate isn't fooling me into thinking this is weaker than it really is."
"What a fantastic beer, i'm saving the other one for a sunny day. Perfect beer for this style, stop reading this and go buy one..."
"On the palate, tropical fruit notes provide a nice complement to the wheat. It has that candied pineapple flavor that I love so much, as well as ruby red grapefruit. There is a great deal of spicy crispness. The finish is bitter, but not exceedingly so. The wheat is subdued, and provides a nice background for the hops, which is why i like this more than any other wheat beer I've had. Mouthfeel is light, with a fair amount of carbonation. And it really doesn't get much more drinkable than this. This beer is so good, I would drink it all the time if I could."
"I often go by this particular style because I figure the Germans do it better with their traditional Hefeweizens. Alas, Three Floyds usually tends to do something interesting so I am pumped to try this one. Pour is a nice bright gold, with a finger worth of white head. Smell is pungent in a good way. I get lots of wild flowers, grassy notes, and lots of lemon. Taste is more oriented towards the hops, which do show a nice mix of grapefruit, grass and spice. The wheat is not really that apparent, at least to my palate. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, and endlessly drinkable. This is a beautiful creation from Three Floyds. It totally did something different with the style. This would do the trick as a Summer thirst quencher. Cheers"
"Off the charts drinkability. This is what I would want lounging on the beach all day. Pass on the margaritas, give me a Gumballhead. Highly recommended."
"D - This is one to kick back all day."
"I don't know where I would be without Gumballhead. This stuff is like my candy. Plus I always enjoy looking at the 6 pack boxes. So colorful and for that alone it should get a couple extra brownie points."
"Like all of the beers from them I've tasted, it has a nice hop aroma. Hazy copper appearance with thin pillowy head. The wheat is balanced nicely with the sweet hop flavor. Very refreshing and drinkable. One of my favs from FFF so far."
"The second beer in a recent east-coast Three Floyds tasting. Another stellar brew. Haven't delved into the more high-octane stuff from FFF but so far I'm really impressed at how they are able to make such sessionable brews that are still really hoppy, and in not-so-popular styles too. This beer is a slightly hazed light golden. Zesty hops hit first and combine perfectly with tangy wheat base imparting an almost citrusy lemon flavor. Yeah, it says that right on the side of the bottle, but it's also true, it does have a lemony tang often associated with Hefes. So light and crisp, totally refreshing, plenty of hops. Interesting. My kind of beer for sure."
"pretty good for what it is, refreshing and light. a good balance between the wheat aspects and the hoppy aspect. balanced, if not spectacular."
"Got this in a Educators BIF from bergands and am happy to have gotten this. To me this seems more like an IPA than American Pale Wheat Ale, but I diegress. Good all around beer that if available here would be on my rotating beer list."
"Solid stuff"
"This was my first 3F beer and I was very impressed to have a low abv beer that met my thirst for hops. This would be a staple in my house if it was available in CA. It would make a great keg beer for parties."
"Excellent. Typically I'm not a huge fan of this style. While this style is usually extremely drink-able, there is usually just not enough flavor to keep me interested. This beer has a perfect blind of refreshment and taste to leave you craving another. It's a shame I can't buy this in my area, because this would be my go to session beer hands down."
"This is a very drinkable beer with the low alcohol content and great for warm summer days when you dont want something to heavy i would highly recommend this beer."
"Good stuff."
"Poured from a bottle into a glass (also drink it on tap at FFFs...A LOT!). This beer is gold in color with a nice creamy head. This is my all-time favorite session beer...no question about it. You can smell the hops and also nice notes of fruit as well. The taste? Well, it's out-freakin-standing...wheat/hops/fruit...just plain good. Overall, one of my favorite session beers...when I want something refreshing, this is what I drink."
"I really like this beer. I can tell the score is going to be one of my highest. Its one of the few times that a true session beer has really kept my interest. If I lived in Indiana, I could see this being a staple beer in my fridge. That says a lot, because I have never had a staple beer in my fridge."
" another home run from quite possibly my favorite North American brewery that I cant buy ( and there arent many in phillly)"
"D - In spite of the overbearing hops, a drinker, for sure."
"This is an ever so drinkable brew. I knocked this one down and was wanting four or five more. I'll be working a trade for more of this one."
"D - Fantastic and very unique flavor IMO. Light bodied but not in the way of BMC brews. Low alcohol level plus great tastes equals a highly sessionable ale. I wish this was more widely available."
"Looks like a heady Swiller Light with the easily identifiable nose of a 3F beer, a sort of candyesque gummy bear quality. As 3F beers are hit or miss for me, I'm apprehensive. Upon tasting, this beer is more hit, which is surprising. I don't typically dig wheat beers, but this offering hits hoopy and candy-like, easy drinking, and slightly watery. Hesitant of a serious rochambo, I'll dub this sessionable."
"Pours a slightly hazy straw color with a one inch white head. I had heard that FFF has a reputation for over-hopping all of their beers, and this one was no exception. A citrusy hoppy aroma was pleasantly apparent. Not too hoppy in the taste, but refreshing nonetheless. A slightly lemon like finish, which is helped by the relatively high carbonation. A sure winner in the hotter months for sure- very drinkable."
"Gumballhead left me highly impressed. I figured this would be a good APWA. Not only was it great, it was also one of the very best offerings I've ever had from Three Floyds. Tremendous."
"Overall: Very good and different wheat! Easy to drink, very refreshing. Very well balanced with no alcohol presence."
"Feels light and good in the mouth. Extremely drinkable beer -- very refreshing, very tasty, very interesting. I could drink it all night long and be quite happy."
"Thanks to stfun37 for this 12oz beer. It smells very lemony just as the label states. Golden yellow with some fizz at the top. This has a very strange taste some lemon but also slightly fishy, what the hell? There is something very strange about this beer that I just don't quite get."
"Poured a dark gold color, not the prettiest but it's not the color here I'm after. The aroma is sweet, smells of fruit and malt. The taste is also fruity as well as malty - I'm not going to rule out the possibility of gumballs - complemented by hops. The body is nice and medium with a great drinkability. This beer is a great option for a session beer due to the great flavor and low abv."
"Very light and crisp, greatly smoothed out malty backbone, some slights of caramel, very sweet banana, lemon. Fairly carbonated. This beer is so incredibly refreshing, I would love to have a keg of this for the summertime."
"Pours pale yellow with a big head. Smells predominantly of citrus and piney hops with a spicy wheat in the background. Taste is similar tp smell with the hops being the attraction and the wheat playing a supporting role. Good carbonation on a medium body beer. Drinkability is good especially in the hotter weather...a thirst quencher."
"Drinkability: Rather high - the lower ABV helps with this and it's rather light in stature. Not heavy at all so I don't feel bloated or heavy after drinking it. I could easily get through a few of these with no worries."
"This is great version of a wheat beer, american style. It has inspired me to brew my own american wheat and do some dry hopping with amarillo."
"I have had it in both Bottle and on tap and really enjoy both. Great job FFF..."
"Great beer, glad to have tried it."
"Drinkability: A very impressive brew. Leave it up to 3Fs to sit around and think ""How can we make the American Pale Wheat Ale more interesting? I know. Let's toss in a boatload of hops."" Well, it worked, and the result - though perhaps not the more stylistically accurate APWA out there - nonetheless manages to combine some of the best elements of a wheat ale (a crisp, low in abv%, and refreshing brew) with those of its more highly-hopped cousins (flavor, improved head retention and lacing). You're looking at the best of both worlds here, and if you want a great lawnmower beer, Gumballhead may just very well be your brew."
"The idea of a hoppy American Wheat is, in my opinion, long overdue. FFF busting this out was brilliant. Refreshing yet more complex than I expected, even as I started this glass, I would love to have a case of this so I could have some sessions without having to ponder so much. More hoppy wheat beers for the summer please!"
"D: Overall, this beer is quite good. My only real gripe is that the nose doesn't have the balance between the wheat and the hops that I would like, but it makes up for it in the flavor for sure. The feel is a bit thin, but thats great if you need an easy drinking summer brew. The ABV is light and further adds to the drinkability of this sucker. Very nice."
"Pours a transparent light gold with a thin white head that dissapates quickly. The smell is impressive as you are bombarded by the hops loaded in. Has a very nice citrus smell like lemon. Wheat taste comes up front followed by hops and citrus accents. Nice citrus aftertaste. Fairly light body with great coating and exceptional drinkability. This is one of the best Wheat beers I've had in a long time. I'm glad I have five more left!"
"Cloudy, golden colored body with lots of suspended yeast in the glass. Decent rocky off white head that settles into a thin skim of suds. Smells of lemons and pineappley hops, with just a touch of banana. Tastes like your typical summer brew on steroids, Lemon zest and puckering hops mix with tropical fruits. Finishes dry.Medium light mouthfeel, highly drinkable."
"Notes: I'd say this is a shoe-in for my favorite wheat beer of all time."
"T: light and crisp very easy to drink there is an obvious wheat background that is the support of this beer with a subtle fruity hops that balance it out. you are not burdened by the unfortunate banana taste of a classic wheat beer, and for that i am very grateful this is probably the most sessionable beer ive had to date. its not big or flashy but it nails a style and niche al the same"
"The hops make it drinkeable. Adding another dimension to the brew."
"Very odd having a beer while grocery shopping, but I hope that Whole Foods adds more options to match their also-awesome wine tasting station."
"This is my new favorite brew. I picked up a six pack at Strack Van Til's in Munster, IN the day after Christmas and I was pleasantly surprised at this offering from Three Floyds. I had always heard about its merits but was afraid to try it, I guess, due to its name. But I'm glad I picked up a sixpack. There were two sixpacks on the shelf and when I went back the next day the other one was gone. Still, I'm gonna enjoy this brew and won't sit on it too long. I'll be visiting family in the Chicago area after New Year's and will definitely look for this beer again. I have a couple places where I might find it. Anyway, the beer is an excellent american wheat beer. Taste, mouthful and drinkability are perfect 5s and I don't think it's just me because it gets high marks with others here on beer advocate. If you have the chance to try this Three Floyds offering, go for it. You won't be disappointed."
"Overall, a fantastic beer, probably the best wheat beer every made."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, perhaps the strongest aspect of the beer. A decent beer from those Munster guys."
"Pretty drinkable beer. Definitely an interesting one that I am glad I got a chance to try."
"M/D: The beer was light and easy to drink. Overall, I was very surprised and I enjoyed the beer. I may have to give it another shot just to see if it will grow on me. Very good beer."
"M/D: Light bodied, carbonation is about right. Drinkability is exceptional. Overall, a very simple beer, bordering on average. But entirely drinkable in large quanties."
"Drinkability is really good. This is a very flavorful session ale. Would be a staple in my fridge during hot Northern California summer days if it was available here. Excellent thirst quenching brew!"
"Try one!"
"D- Easy to drink, and could be a regular if it was sold out in the PNW."
"D- This beer is awesome. I knew with how much I love UberSun that I would really like this. Ubersun, hopsun, and gumball head are all similar...but gumballhead seems to offer a similar punch to ubersun without the extra ABV associated. I'm really happy I have 3 bottles of this!"
"Like some others, I'm a little confused by it's style classification."
"This is a fantastic wheat, easily my favorite. The only thing holding it back is the appearance, which is just a touch bland. One of the best smelling beers out there. Floral, hoppy, piney, it's all that. Fantastic to smell, darn fun to drink. Superb session beer, I could drink a lot of these. In my opinion, this is the best of FFF's ""available all the time"" beers. A top ten beer for me, one I go back to over and over again."
"I will say that you could drink this beer all day with no problem. But I do not think I would want to."
"This is an exceptional beer, especially for the style. I was a bit disappointed in the appearance. To me there is nothing special here. Smell is phenominal- a nice blast of floral hops and citrus fruit. Taste is similar, but more complex. Such a clean finish and great slightly sweet malt to finish. Mouthfeel is above average, but little to no carbonation. Drinkability is the best I have ever had."
"D_A clear sessioner as the hops are not too prominent as to become overwhelming."
"D- 5.0 period. This may not be the most complex beer but as far as I'm concerned this should be the NUMBER ONE SESSION. Only 4 something percent alc. Only problem is the price. $12.50 a six pack is harsh."
"D- Delicious and easy. I could drink this all day and I wish I could get this is Michigan."
"Easily my favorite American-style wheat brew, surpassing Oberon."
"This goes down so easily. It's a combination of appealing aroma, enjoyable flavors, light body and satisfying finish. What a great beer. It is easily the best in it's category and should be a top 100 beer (IMHO)."
"D - Very high. It's hard for me to have only one of these. Great with food, great by itself, too. A delicious brew. A hop lover's wheat beer."
"A very enjoyable American Pale Wheat! One of the better ones I have tried."
"overall this is a good beer. and i am not disappointed but im not sure this is what i was expecting the beer that i got. i would visit here again if i had the chance. maybe i just had a fizzy bottle. but other than that good job three floyds."
"D: Wow. What a great beer for a warm day. Satisfies the hop craving while being crisp and refreshing. I'm going to have to find a way to get this to California more often! Delicious."
"If you are a hophead, seek this out. An awesome twist on the style. Highly recommended."
"This is an amazing brew. Very sessionable. Easy drinking yet full flavored and hoppy. And the artwork is pretty cool, the cat looks like hes sessioned alot of this beer:)"
"I'm not a huge fan of wheat beers in general, but the hoppyness of this one made it very drinkable for me."
"This is a nice light beer that refreshes and is super easy to drink. This is a hopheads summer beer."
"Cheers MacDomer"
"Very refreshing Pale Wheat Ale. Definitely a favorite and could drink more than a few in a night."
"Bottom line: This a hugely flavourful American Pale Wheat! It gets some darn good reviews here so Three Floyds must be doing something right, again, but for me, it went overboard with the hoppiness.. for the style. I'd still recommend it though."
"This is one of my top favorites."
"This beer was SO easy to drink. I can see why people rave about FFF beer."
"Crystal-clear, clean drinking. Definitely what a lawnmower beer should be. Again, slight overpromise with the hugely-enjoyable citrus/floral hop aroma when considering the supreme cleanliness of this offering, as the palate feel can't quite live up to the power of the aroma. This one deserves its own canning line 'cause it would be spectacular for the beach."
"I like this beer too, but come on, I lived in Philadelphia, this isn't god's work here as Swifty might have you think. It is the best wheat beer I've ever had by far, so I'll give it that. I've had some other wheat beers and always find them too sweet and chalky. 3Fs somehow avoids those extremes and gives a very complex yet smooth beer."
"D: Very drinkable. I really like this beer. Three Floyd's never disappoints. I am glad I am back home in Indiana for a short stay. A growler of this delivered by my brother was the right way to kick off my trip."
"Drinkability takes a small hit due to the intense flavors in this beer. It is the beer equivalent of a rich double-chocolate cake: so delicious, but it would be overwhelming to have it for an entire meal. It is the most expensive APWA I have seen... and now I understand why, and that it is worth every penny."
"This is an amazing summer beer which I am quite fond of. It has huge citrusy hop flavor, but it's really not very bitter. Definitely not a traditional APWA - it doesn't suck. The Floyds are on to something."
"This is the most drinkable wheat beer I've ever had. I'm not a huge fan of wheats, but this is exceptional. The American hopping provides an adequate balance for the sweetness that is wheat malt... overall quite satisfying."
"Poured into my New Belgium globe. This beer pours a slightly hazy straw with a small half a finger head that left just a tiny bit of lacing. The aroma is slightly happy, a hint of oranges, and a bit of a wheat tang. The taste is wheat in nature, a bit of coriander, but the flavor was mostly a slight hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing. Slight effervescent. This would be a great summer beer, when its hot and humid outside."
"D - Not only could I have drank several, I did. My friend was so impressed that he went out after we polished off the 6 pack and got another."
"Drinkability: I could drink this all day long - absolutely delicious, tasty and satisfyingly refreshing without being overpowering or heavy in any way."
"Overall, a great, crisp, clean ale that is intensely hopped! At 4.8ABV, one could drink these all day."
"Thanks to ThirstyBird for generously sharing this and thanks to Wes for carting it back from Indiana to Rhode Island. Served in a tumbler. Poured a murky yellow-gold. No head or lacing during the session. Nose is primarily grapefruit, but character was not at all sharp. Also picked up a mild hops presence towards the back. Taste is consistent with nose. Very smooth and balanced. Mouthfeel was light-bodied with even carbonation throughout. Drinkability was fantastic. So easy drinking; easily the best APA I've ever had."
"D--A heavy, heady beer for 4.8 ABV. Not a pounder, but why wouldn't you want to slowly savor this? Refreshing nonetheless."
"M/D - Light to medium bodied and very smooth. Not the chewiness of many wheat ales. Incredibly easy drinking."
"D: One of the most drinkable beers ever and one of my all time favorite session beers without a doubt!"
"Gumballhead is the ultimate in drinkability and big flavor. Can't think of another 4.8% beer where the ""Wow""-factor is so high. If I could get this where I live, it would already have trumped my recently-discovered Green Flash Hop Head Red as the favored every-day beer. Three Floyds does it again."
"This is one of my favorite wheat beers which says a lot because wheat beers do not excite me at all. Pours a beautiful golden color with a nice head. Smells of sweet candy and fruit.Taste is mildy sweet in the beginning almost like the shell of a gumball, but flows nicely into hoppy territory with a bombardment of amarillo hops. Definitely try this if you haven't. Its definitely the session wheat beer, for people who like an interesting twist."
"D- Not too bitter, not too sweet and amazingly well-rounded"
"D: Super drinkable, very refreshing and tastes much larger than it is, I could probably drink these all day."
"Great beer, great flavor, possibly the greatest sessioner of all time, absolutely perfect for the summer."
"T: Light body with high carbonation. Immediate hop bitterness, with slight sweetness from malt trying to balance it and finishes with wheat taste and dry hop taste. Strong lemony citrus flavor in the body as well. Very crisp and refreshing, great summertime beer."
"I just still am in shock at how much I have fallen in love with this beer... Wheat beers have never really been on my top favorites, but this changes that for sure! The aroma was so fresh and crisp... Such a well hopped wheat is going to have to be the next beer I plan on brewing and it will probably be a clone of Gumballhead..."
"D - Man, another awesome creation from FFF! This brew boasts superior drinkability and tons of fresh flavors and aromas that will keep me coming back for more. I'm glad I have a couple of these on hand, as I will definitely be revisiting this gem very soon!"
"FFF is far too hard to find, but well worth the effort."
"Smooth finish no strange or overpowering after tastes"
"Mainly a hoppy flavor, but a bit of wheat as well. Malty aftertaste and it is smooth from beginning to finish. Very good - I'll definitely have this again."
"Tried this for the first time as a surprise purchase from my sister.. Pale golden color with thin white head. Head does not leave marks on the glass. Excellent aroma, smells like citrus. Different citrus flavors and smells throughout. Very unusual and pleasant aftertaste. Very drinkable, goes down quick. Low alcohol level. I'm not a big wheat beer man, but will try this again. Three Floyds rules!!!"
"Overall: Gonna have to agree with the Bros here. This is a ""good"" beer, but not amazing."
"O - a delicious session beer for sure!"
"I hope I just rec'd a bad bottle after all the positive reviews. My first failing grade. Drain-pour."
"Recommended."
"Overall: I should start out by noting that I'm not a big fan of American wheats (without some kind of yeast contribution--like a Hefeweizen--or spicing--like a Belgian Wit--they just seem kind of pointless), and I'm not a big IPA fan, so it's not surprising that I wouldn't like what's basically a scaled-down wheat IPA. That being said, I've given plenty of IPA's good reviews and my mediocre rating of this beer isn't the result of my personal preference. Rather I think this beer is too one-dimensional. If you want to make a hoppy wheat beer, go nuts. However, I think it needs a bit more malt body to stand up to the hops. If you're a hophead looking for a lawnmower beer, this is for you. But if you're looking for any semblance of balance or complexity, skip this one."
"d: Super easy-drinking. A wheat beer that isn't boring. Superb balance. The way wheat beer should be, the best one I have had. Add this to the list of world-class beer made by Three Floyds."
"D: Very drinkable."
"Yum."
"Mouthfeel is very light with some good carbonation. Very drinkable. This would be a good session beer on a hot summer day while doing some BBQing and relaxing with freinds and family."
"M&D: Just a little too much carbonation. The mouthfeel is downgraded because of the distinctive bite. But, at only 4.8% ABV you could have plenty of these after a long day of yardwork. Skal."
"These guys know how to brew; they are certainly among the best in the United States. If there's anything they may very be the best at it's brewing hoppy beers. Three Floyds has mastered this to the point of flawlessness. Point in case: the Gumballhead."
"Pours a straw/yellowy color, with lots of sediment floating in the glass. Head fades extremely fast, minimal lacing. Nice piney, lemony/citrus aromas. Taste is bitter, lemony, hoppy tartness. Tasty!! Really active carbonation, with a crisp and drying finish. An excellent beer for the warm weather....if only I could get this locally."
"Been dying to try some more FFF stuff, so very excited about the prospect of digging into this one. Pours a deep orange, fairly clean with a few bits of floating yeast. A two finger off-white head on top that dissolves fairly quickly down to a fine film. Some subtle lacing. Looks good. Nose is...wow, tons of hops. Fruity hops, principally. Some very light wheatiness, but overall, it smells like an APA or even IPA. Interesting...this one must be along the lines of the ST Hop Sun. Flavor is interesting. Biting carbonation on the top up front moves into more floral hops this time. Tons of citrus in there, and very mild wheat and yeast flavors as well. A highly bitter brew, especially for an APWA. Carbonation's high, but good for what they seem to be going for here. Overall, it's extremely unique...not necessarily an APWA I'd be grabbing for on a hot summer day, but tasty nonetheless."
"Drinkability is excellent, i could see this becoming my favorite summer brew."
"Thickerfreakness rules for sending me this one! Decanted from the bottle into a weizen glass. Pours a golden color with a one-finger head that fizzes away quickly. Big aromas of pineapples and wheat, with a little spice underneath. Tastes of slightly bitter hops, wheat, biscuity malts, and a general fruitiness. The fruit really shows up after swallowing the beer. Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium and well carbonated. This is one of the most drinkable beers I've had, period. Overall this isn't quite what I expected, but totally awesome."
"Easy to drink, quite refreshing, it displays more bitterness than the average, but most of its hoppiness it still just floral and fruity, not really stingy bitter. A very interesting wheat beer."
"When will I be able to buy it in PA???"
"My wife enjoyed a sip of this before she had to leave for the evening. I will stay in her good graces and not finish the entire growler by myself even though it is tempting. I am guessing she will ask if there is any left when she comes home. This is an enjoyable beer with a lot going on. Well enough of this, I'm going back to enjoying."
"d: Thanks to scubarex for the chance to try this uniquely awesome beer. I'd love to have this as a local."
"Drinks really easy, but the complexity draws you in as well; One of the better American Pale Wheats out there!"
"Three Floyd's ROCK."
"M/D- really light, but really good. This might have just become my standard of a ""summer beer."" I'm probably gonna need to arrange for another couple 6'rs of this before Summer is over."
"D - Quite drinkable. Definitely sessionable. A great beer to share with your friends (assuming you don't drink it all yourself)."
"Poured a cloudy yellow gold with an attractive white head. As the head dissipated, a small amount of sticky lace dotted the glass. The smell was that of sweet citrus fruits and mild hops. I really like the way this beer tastes...and I'm not a wheat beer fan. This is nothing like a wheat beer in my opinion. It's more like a hopped up, non-filtered pale ale. Very easy to drink, very easy to like. I would love to have this as a staple in my fridge but alas, FFF doesn't get this far south."
"Good drinkability in this wheat beer. Great refreshing beer in the summer heat. Because of the strong hops, it would be a little hard to drink too many of these. I would definitely like to get my hands on this one again."
"Poured a very pale golden yellow color with some sudsy lacing resting on top. Aroma is very crisp with plenty of hopped goodness that fills my nostrils. There is some grain and maybe some slight citrus scent in the aroma. The Flavor is where this really takes off with plenty of complimenting flavors that makes this one so smooth. Mouthfeeling is crisp and refreshing."
"D: Probably one of the most tasty session beer candidates I've had in a while. Could go through a few of these on a hot summer day. Loving the candy/sweet fruit aroma and taste on this one."
"22 oz bottle. Pours a hazy dull gold with massive white foamy head that is mostly lasting. Aroma of hops, kind of citrusy, mostly pine. Initial flavor has the presence of a wheat plus all the hops. Balanced taste throughout, hoppiness overtakes at the end. Moderate lacing, light to medium body, moderate carbonation, without any signs of alcohol. Very drinkable, especially for hop heads or open minded fans of wheat beers."
"The appearance is at first sort of off putting. It pours a fizzy filtered yellow with a white head that fades fast, but once you get to the smell you know its a whole different ballgame. It smells of strong citrus hops and a nice wheat sweetness. The taste is similar to the smell and its just perfect. A nice hop bitterness with a sweet wheat after taste. Its more like a plain pale ale but with an added wheat sweetness. This is an exceptional beer. The mouthfeel is sort of thin but its ever so drinkable. I wish I could get this all summer in Texas!"
"D: This one is seriously drinkable if not easily categorized. As summer approaches here in Atlanta, this one would be a staple in the fridge if I had access to it. Very refreshing."
"D: The beer is drinkable. I think that it is quite refreshing, and I could definitely drink more of this."
"Great session beer with a unique spring time feel to it. If I see this on tap, It'll be my starter for sure."
"It's got the body of a wheat and everything else screams Pale Ale."
"D- This is certainly an easy drinker. Glad I have 3 because now I know what i'm going to pop open on a warm summer day."
"A superbly drinkable beer. Sessionable to the max."
"This is about as drinkable of a beer as you can get. Light and refreshing on the palate and the flavors are so well crafted and played against each other that the glass doesn't spend much time on the table. Definitely a summer staple. Well done FFF."
"Wasn't expecting this flavor from a wheat beer. What I thought would be grainy and light ended up being a nice medium bodied hoppy beer. Poured thick and golden with great retention. Smelled strongly of hops, oranges, lemon, and citrus fruits. Taste was big and bold. Huge on hops, quite bitter, with a hint of malt sweetness in the aftertaste. Crisp, medium bodied, and probably the best wheat beer I've ever had."
"I was disappointed, given the label & brewery's reputation. And I certainly don't know why I paid $7 for the bomber when i could've had a slew of better beers for half that amount. Will be awhile before I give Three Floyd's another try."
"Thanks to my friend TheodorHrzl for this one. Told me it was his favorite summer beer so I decided to pop it open on the warmest day of the year so far. Great brew!"
"If you're into Wheat Beers that smell (and taste) like APAs, then this beer will not disappoint. If you're looking for a classic wheat beer, look elsewhere."
"D- Very drinkable. Tastey, smooth and nice!!!"
"Pours a nice golden straw color with good (for a wheat) head, but little lacing. Excellent scent, a nice crisp wheat ale with a huge spicy (peppery) aroma. Nice taste, a good crisp wheat ale, although the pepper overpowers it a little bit. Goes down very smoothly, an excellent wheat ale."
"D: Very drinkable. Kinda sweet but this beer is one of the best American wheat beer I've tried. You should try one on."
"Overall an amazing beer, not exactly what I expected from a summery wheat beer but very good nonetheless. I've never had a wheat beer with this level of complexity and excellent drinkability. I'm really glad that FFF has started brewing this year-round and I can't wait to get my hands on more of it!!"
"A delicious wheat that leaves you burping hops. Could you ask for more?"
"D: This is one i'll definitely run through a ton of them."
"This is a good summer session beer. I'd drink this often."
"And here comes Gumballhead, the best beer that's ever been brewed anywhere by anybody. The hop profile is perfect. The pour is perfect. The aroma is like an herb garden that fucked a flower and had a bunch of a cute little pink and green babies. It's not overwhelming. It's just... it's just perfect."
"D= I would pair this beer with many types of food (pizza, burgers, and a million other things) as well as enjoy it on any hot day. Its a winner."
"Drinkability is high. Easy to consume as it is smooth and refreshing with moderate flavors and low alcohol. Makes for a great session."
"This is the first time I've ever had gumballhead and I'm wishing I could get it here. The drinkability seems very high to me on this one and I'd like nothing more than to have a 6 pack of this on hand at the moment."
"Pours with a white head that disapates quickly leaving a lacing on the glass. Quite clear for a wheat beer. Carbonation is high and flows through the almost straw-colored body. Aromas of spiciness, fruity esters typical for wheat beers. Taste of hops that coats the tongue followed by a spiciness, almost yeasty bite."
"Poured into a snifter. Gumballhead pours a pale yellow, translucent, with a nice white head. Little retention, and the head eventually drops down into the halo effect. Faint lacing. A shocking hop aroma for a wheat beer, yeasty, citrus and some earthy tones. Hops are upfront in the initial taste, but it fades and hides behind the sweet malty flavors as well as the citrus from the wheat. Clean and crisp mouthfeel, not heavy at all. Interesting palate with the Amarillo hops. Not what I expected style wise, but as a hophead I loved it."
"Thanks to Sephiroth for this one! Poured into a sam ultimate glass. Clear, golden color with a wispy white head that dissapates quickly. Hey... I thought this was a wheat beer- all I can smell is hops! Not a bad thing. Not what I was thinking, but great first sip- Some yeasty, wheaty flavor followed by a hop punch! Now the flavor is all the amarillo bitter hops! Much crisper than your usual wheat style beer. Light body keeps it easy to drink."
"one was enough... but i can see a hophead enjoying more than one pint."
"Brilliant golden color with a nice fluffy white head poured into a weizen glass. Nice fragrant, sweet and fruity citric hops. Some candy like sweetness in there, and a hint of wheat as it warms, but the hops are the star. Taste is smooth, balanced, yet hops play a big role in the taste as well and make the flavor pop unlike in any wheat beer I’ve ever had. Subtle, and slightly lingering wheat finish. The hops are so crisp, bright, and refreshingly flavorful with the perfect amount of bitterness. Wow, this is simply awesome. I wish this were available in Texas. Damn near perfect. One of my favorite beers, and FFF's hop profile is probably the cleanest, most citrusy and refreshing that I've ever had."
"Pale orange with very little head. Not a lot of aroma. Crisp mouthfeel with a very nice bready, wheat flavor. Not yeasty with banana flavors--not anything like a Hefeweizen, really. The hops add to the flavor without disturbing it--without taking over. Instead, they add a nice balance to the bready wheat. This is a nicely constructed beer. It would be easy to drink at least a bomber by myself, though I am sharing it today. Cheers!"
"A great refreshing beer. I understand why it ranks among the best session beers."
"D - overall a nice interpretation of the style with more hops than expected. I was a big fan of the hop and mango presence in this one and I think that's what makes it stick out from some of the others that there are. Definitely a good beer that I would try to get whenever out if they had it on tap and i think it would be especially good with food since it is kinda lighter bodied and crisp. Also a good session beer but not the best session beer from FFF as I think that would still goto Alpha King. I enjoyed this one esp for the style which I am usually not a huge fan of."
"Drinkability is compromised by the overly high carbonation and bitterness, otherwise this is decent example of APWA (not too many of these in SoCal) that has good balance, low alcohol presence, but lacking in complexity"
"Highly recommended. One of the best APWAs I've had. Good flavors with some great drinkability."
"D- Not complex enough to be amazing, but a decent beer."
"Very drinkable beer made me think it was summertime even though Im looking at snow outside my window right now"
"Taste is straight up intriguing, a hearty and full flavoured mix of hops (grapefruit, pine, herbs (medicinal), pepper, and maybe some juniper?) with bready malt with some tasty yeast flavours, bubblegum sweetness with a bit of banana, apple, pear, and clove. Lighter body keeps this really drinkable though, carbonation isn't too obnoxious either, which is nice. Nice balance, full of flavour, and certainly better than most beers I've had in this style."
"Overall, I think I would like to make this brew a regular. Its mighty tasty"
"Pours a hazy gold with a good 1 inch+ of foamy head (enough to go over the pint glass rim, but not spill over) which dissipates well, leaving a small layer of cream colored head and good lacing. Smells of straw, cereal, citrus notes like lemon peel and a slight hint of sour apple. The taste of honey and sugar cereal up front follow with a good malt backbone, and the citrus and bitter hops leave this a very balanced and unique tasting wheat beer with a crisp finish. Medium in body with great fizzy carbonation throughout. One of my favorite beers from Three Floyds, good to enjoy at any time, not just in the summer."
"D-This would make a great summer beer but I would enjoy this during any season.This is a good example of the style and another great brew from FFF's."
"Flavors include some crisp spicy zing and a citrus-lemon kick. Superb! With a distinctive sweet-to-bitter followthrough, this exceptional brew is a standout in a sea of American wheat beers. Plus, they score big-time cool points for the bottle's icon and namesake, the Skin Graft Records comic character, Gumballhead the cat. A winner!"
"D - Good beer. I am not too familiar with pale wheat beers but I think it fits the description based on what I would think from other wheat beers and a pale style mixed."
"Slightly hazy straw color. Aroma of fresh hay and Pacific North-West hops. This beer tasted like a cross between an American Wheat beer and an American Pale Ale. There were some clean, light grainy flavors with some soft late addition hop character. Really nice spin on a wheat beer. Just enough extra hops to match the tartness of the wheat. Bell's Oberon meets Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. A little summer in the middle of January."
"One of my favorite offerings from Three Floyds. I love the flavor balance, crisp nature, and way easy drinkibility of this guy. A great summertime beer that is still going strong well into the winter."
"And just like that, it's gone. I sure could use another."
"Medium mouthfeel. Hop bitterness has a nice bite at the end. Somewhat slick on the tongue and teeth. Absolutely wonderful. I was searching through my cellar, looking for something other than a DIPA or RIS or Barleywine. My palate is a bit fatigued of those at the moment so I was looking for something a little lighter. This certianly fit the bill and was delicious. I had heard good things about this beer and was glad I got to try it."
"Nice, but nothing special. It immediately reminds me of Southern Tier's HopSun as a light an relatively hoppy wheat beer. The juicy, citrus hops are quite crisp but the malt flavor simply provides a sweet background for the hops. Overall, it's not that complex, but it's a refreshing beer for hops fans."
"Pours a glowing, hazy gold, with a two-inch head that dissipates quickly. Smell is boatloads of grapefruit, orange rind, and lemon; really fantastic in the aroma department. Taste is brisk, with a light but flavorful hop attack, refreshing wheat tartness, and perfect carbonation. Mouthfeel is perhaps a bit thin, but this beer is extremely flavorful and refreshing."
"D  Refreshing without being light, retaining its satisfaction. Not for heavy consumption, but a very drinkable beer for refreshment with some body to it."
"This is not the wheat beer I expected. But it was not an experience I regret either. By the time the beer reached our table, there was no head present. Served in a pint glass, color was a dark gold, not quite amber. Floral hops and some citrus were the most up front smell. Hops were all over the taste. Sigh. I'm a bit tired of potent hop taste in every other beer regardless of style, but that is a rant for a forum, not a beer review. Mouthfeel was smooth and quite nice. Likewise for drinkablity. Very sessionable. Will certainly have this again."
"love the smell, love the taste, and love the beer. one of the best brews to pass my lips in my time as a BA and beer lover."
"Pours slightly golden orange and looks very tasty. it was hoppy as hell and a little bit overly carbonated. i took around a half hour to kill this guy and air bubbles were still rising at the very end. a good citrusy scent. there are some 'herbal' aspects to this beer too. its tastes like chronic. wow. quite tasty though, and the packaging was amongst the best i've ever seen on a beer."
"Overall: excellent red beer with masterful hoppiness. Great selection especially for the price. FFF continues to impress."
"D - One of the most drinkable beers I have had. One of my go to beers."
"Light and drinkable, would definitely buy as a session beer if available around here. Best wheat beer I can remember drinking."
"Thanks to kirok1999 for sending me this in the Secret Halloween BIF. Served chilled into a pint glass, from a twelve ounce bottle. Poured a brilliant, bright, hazy golden yellow color, with some tiny white floaties. Two good fingers of dense, bubbly white head formed with a bit of a vigorous pour. Head faded pretty quickly and left some spotty lace behind. Smell is wheat, citrus, pine and HOPS! Tons of hops in the nose with a bit of spice. Never smelled a wheat beer quite like this. Wow! What a great flavor as well. A nice wheat flavor with a bit of lemon zest, some nice pine notes in the background, and a serious hop bite. Quite smooth though. The hops are pretty much king in this beer. A nice light to medium body with minimal carbonation. Very drinkable and very refreshing. Definitely not what I expected from a wheat beer."
"D: The low abv makes this a good quaffin' beer but the harshness of the hops will limit mass consumption."
"Thoroughly enjoyable and refreshing brew. A nice treat to find this so many miles from home on draft."
"A pale golden color with a half inch white head, that dissolves away quickly. The aroma starts with pine and grassy fragrances and blends into this light citrusy, lemon scent. The light taste of wheat stands put at the start, but it is more dominated by citrus flavors in the middle. Then at the end a earthy hop bitterness, attacks the palate at the end. A light mouthfeel, it is not thin or watery, it has crisp finish finish for an ale. This beer is incredible drinkable, fantastic aroma, added on with a light feel and flavor make this a must have beer on those summertime camping trips."
"The first thing you notice when you open this beer is the huge hop aroma. As you pour the beer it is even more evident. Mine poured a hazy yellow color with a really outstanding head that left lacing all the way down. The flavor was of the usual wheat character but, with the huge hop presence. I loved this beer; the best American wheat I have tried. Good mouthfeel and excellent drinkability."
"This beer is very easy to drink and I wish I could get it where I lived. Thanks to DavidEddie as this was an extra in a trade and he knew I really wanted it."
"The taste of this beer is absolutely delicious, my only comment is that the mouth feel seemed just a bit thin."
"Drinkability- Couldnt be better. This is the most sessionable, drinkable taste treat Ive ever had. Its light and refreshing yet still full of flavor. I would do anything for a six pack of this stuff. Thanks again to SPLITGRIN for sharing the wealth!"
"Drinkability: One could session this all day... refreshing and an all around solid ale!"
"So I finally was able to get a hold of a Gumball head, not only did I find one, but I managed to score 4! So needless to say this one had better be good. Poured a nice bright golden amber with lots of haze and cloudiness and some sediment gathering on the bottom. A very fluffy large head of white formed on the top and this gradually gave way to copious side glass lace. A great aroma hear, very light with lots of floral light hop[s in the back a really nice grassy and yeast like front to it. This translated over very well to the flavor. A very light floral and bright flavor dominated by grass like flavors, punctuated with peaches, and orange hop flavors. Very light bodied with ample carbonation made this one that was not too filling, and this almost qualified as a water substitute it was so good. I thoroughly enjoyed every last drop of this. It has to be hands down the best I have ever had in the style and one of the best session ales I have ever tried. I would buy a case if they sold it here and have one for dinner every night. This was definitely a very very fine brew and I look forward to the rest of them, get your hands on this if you can!"
"Big thanks to Faustgeist for hauling this back from Cali."
"Not one I was impressed with and probably need to try again."
"Drinkability - I have five more, I'm sure I'll find good use for these. All in all, a very fine offering for not only the hop-minded, but also those who are willing to explore something beyond just the malt-minded brews."
"Pours a cloudy gold with thick 2 1/2 inch head that reduces to a thin sticky foam than laces wonderfully down the pint. Strong wheat and red grapefruit smell. Tastes like it smells, chewy wheat and suble grapefruit. It does not make your mouth pucker with sourness, but leaves a good fruity aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation is just right, glides over the tounge and leaves you feeling refreshed. Definately a thirsty drinkers beer. It makes me wish that Three Floyds will come back to Wisconsin."
"Hazy golden pour with tremendous white foamy head. Aroma is grapefruit and Amarillo hops. Flavor is very hoppy and citrusy. Mouthfeel is good and this is a very sessionable beer. This is one of the best wheat beers Ive had. I wish this was available in Mississippi."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, forming a big ole 3"" white head over the clear light golden brew. Forthy head fades ever so slowly, with lots of sticky lacing. Aroma is citrus and wheat. Taste imitates the nose, balanced between lemony bite and chewy wheat. Mouthfeel is smooth with the expected citrus bite, and drinking is very high. An enjoyable brew, but not as nice as I remember it being in the 22oz bottle a few years ago."
"Pours a pale cloudy yellow color with a white head. Aromas that are citrusy and hoppy. In the taste, a dry wheaty taste and also, it is hoppy smooth. A smooth, dry mouthfeel and a dry hoppy aftertaste. A different wheat, with big hops. I enjoy the smooth dryness and again, anything with a nice hop presence is always good."
"Very highly recommended"
"A nice light golden color with a white head. It was crystal clear, which I'm not used to in a wheat beer. There was a very citrusy hop aroma with grapefruit shoving it's way to the front. The flavor is much the same. The citrus pushes it's way to the front but the slightly heavier wheat flavor emerges a bit later and balances very nicely. The wheat doesn't weight the beer down though and it still remains very light bodied. All around a great summer drinker."
"Overall, sweet and refreshing. Very crisp flavors.This is exactly what I needed to drink. There isn't much for carbonation, and the body is moderately heavy. I'm going to be getting some more of this down the road. I wish it was available in my area, it'd be a terrific session beer IMO."
"Of course, I wondered what this might be like on tap or even with divine intervention, from a cask."
"Drinkability: Very high. Tasy, smooth, refreshing. What more could you want. Very good beer that I'm glad I was able to try while it was still warm out. Could do a few of these in a row, which I find myself unable to say about some of my favorites, which are too big to do several of."
"I only bought one bottle (why? why? why?), so I expect that there are other flavors here to be found and enjoyed. For a wheat beer, it's fairly complex, but it's also light enough and straightforward enough to go down easily."
"D - Exceptionally drinkable at 4.8% abv., wonderfully complex tastes, sweet and refreshing. This is an excellent beer to have in the summer, or anytime. I'm glad I found this."
"Pours a clear/clean golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice huge two finger plus creamy/foamy white head, which then leaves some nice sticky lacing. The nose is malty, slightly hoppy, some spices, yeast, grassy, and slight caramel. The taste is nice, malty/hoppy, yeasty/grassy, slight spice, and some caramel. The finish is slightly dry and slightly bitter. Medium body. Drinkable, I'm glad I finally got a chance to try this one out."
"Poured into my new favorite Sam Adams glass, Gumballhead is vibrant gold with hints of orange. I think maize seems to be a fitting descriptor. Expected wheat induced haze only adds to the appearance. Little particles do swim around in the glass, but that's not always a bad thing. Light white head dissipates very quickly to almost nothing. Smells great! Hop nose is floral and seems to be perfect for the wheaty malt character. Tastes like I wish every wheat beer would taste. The wheats I have tasted seem to miss the hop character that FFF's has found with this beer. Of course, it is FFF's we're talking about here! Mouthfeel is hard to nail down. Seems a little watery, but at the same time I get the cloying feeling that most wheats leave on my tongue. This is an extremely drinkable beer and I don't think that these 6 are going to make it 24 hours in my fridge! Perfect Summer refreshment. And Spring... And Fall."
"D: I wish I could buy this out here in MA! I'm not a huge wheat beer fan to begin with, but they did a damn nice job with this one. The hoppiness adds a great element you don't see in a lot of wheat beers, yet it remains nicely balanced."
"Oh, the artwork on the bottle and more so on the 6 pack is strangely awesome."
"This tropical fruit smell is also evident in the taste. The taste almost reminds me of a tropical mixed drink with the orange and lemon flavor. There is very little malt flavor. This tastes like a highly hopped, flavored witbier. This is the most unique interpretation of an American Wheat beer I have tasted. I would not say this is my favorite style of beer, but I am glad I finally had the opportunity to try it. Due to the high acidity, I am not sure I would enjoy more than a couple at a time."
"Drinkability was ok. Not great, but pretty damn good for a normally bland style"
"Gumballhead is all the hype. Probably the best tasting & most enjoyable sub 5% beer I've ever had, and definitely one of the Top 20 beers I've enjoyed....period. A true testament to the potential that low ABV beers can have. This would be great with Thai food, Pacific Rim, a crisp salad, whitefish or chicken with citrus, and any zesty, lighter fare. Very impressed. Would drink this again in a heartbeat, and would highly recommend it to anyone....an outstanding beer by any standard!"
"This brew pours a hazy orange color. The head is large, billowy, and recedes slowly into thick lacing. The aroma is of citrus, banana, clove, and wheat. The taste has more wheat, and clove than the aroma, with only a touch of citrus. There is a slight bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is perfect for a wheat beer. It is meiudm bodied, with high carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is one of the best American wheat beers I have had. I would like to drink this more often."
"Pours a hazy light orange with a decent head that diminishes to a ring. The aroma is of sweet malts, bubblegum, sweet fruits and a hint of wheat. The taste is dominated by sweet fruits and bubblegum. The beer is relatively light bodied, but not as much as I'd expect for the style and strength of the beer. Overall, this is an enjoyable beer, but considering I'm not really a huge fan of the style, I wouldn't regularly shell out $5.99 a bomber for it if it were available in my area."
"On draft at the Comet. I do believe that I have found a new summertime favorite beer. A nice wheat with the patented Three Floyds twist. It poured a nice light golden color with a short lived small head. Smell is wheat, hops, and a hint of slight lemon. Taste is much the same, except with the presence of some well placed hops. Mouthfeel is smooth and refreshing, with just enough hop bitterness to it. A very crisp, well balanced beer."
"Drinkability of of this light beer is exceptional, the price may keep it out of reach more than the taste."
"D: A great wheat beer, probably the best American wheat beer that I have ever had, probably not worth $10 a bomber, but would definitely seek it out again if I were in a part of the country where it is normally distributed, a great summer refresher."
"Bravo."
"Cheers!"
"I had this several times on tap at 3F, where it probably scored a couple tenths higher than the bottled version. Still, the bottled version was no slouch. I didn't know APA and APW could produce offspring, but this is a great effort!"
"The beer pours slightly darker that traffic signal yellow, with a persistent head in keeping with the wheat, though it does not have that hefe cloudiness. The aroma is the real prize here, just overflowing with Amarillo hops, lemony and bright, just unstoppable. The flavor is more muted and even a little sweet. The hops come to the rescue, cutting a potentially saccharine beer down to size, and keeping the mouthfeel quite mild. A very drinkable brew. Certainly one of the stranger brews I've had, almost defying one to force-fit it into a BJCP category."
"Rereview after almost three years. I'm still not a big fan of highly hopped wheats or American pale wheats, but here goes. From one of the new 12 oz bottles, this pours a hazy canary yellow body with over an inch of creamy white head. Good retention and extravagant lacing make for an excellent appearance. Bold aroma of pine cones, grapefruit, and a hint of yeast. Medium to light medium body with strong carbonation. Taste is aggressively hopped. Pine cone and citrus rind run amok. Black pepper and lemon hints underneath. Granted, the hops elevate this above its mundane style but the hop bitterness seems somehow out of place. Still, a good summer thirst quencher."
"The carbonation helped to keep the beer from being too syrupy. A great beer."
"This is the hoppiest wheat beer I've ever had. It tastes surprisingly like Dreadnaught, which I assume isn't an accident...since I don't personally like an excessively ""wheaty"" taste, this is a definite plus. It's quite spicy but has a nice mellow finish. I think it smells like an IPA more than it tastes like one, but it is very similar to that style. And very easy to drink....I just spent all evening cleaning my apartment and this is the perfect end to the day."
"The taste is crisp and refreshing, and now I know Im drinking a wheat beer, but it's quite a subtle wheat flavor. Im glad they have this one in six packs now, and I may have to trade for one or two six packs to enjoy the summer days."
"This beer is very drinkable; in fact Ive had over five in one sitting. An awesome beer for the backyard barbeque or for the one beer a night flavor. This is an all around great beer."
"This beer is great to say the least. Poured with a two inch head that took about 3mins to clear. The lacing around the glass was soo sticky you could count how many sips i had taken.Nice golden tan color. Great citrus taste without a big bite, great for sitin back on the front porch watchin pedestrians pass. I would drink this again no question."
"D: Quite possibly the penultimate summer beer. A true classic!"
"I flew to Chicago and drove to Munster, Indiana for this beer. After loading the rent-a-suv, I drove straight home, to Boston with it. This is really a great beer! AND a great Brewery/Brew Pub"
"Enough hops to enliven the tongue, with a citrus flavor laced throughout. Gorgeous pour, nice head for this type of beer. Not to be missed."
"This is my first run into the 3F fray. With that, I'm hopeful the next ones would be as good."
"Exceptionally smooth medium body. Nicely carbonated. Slight bitterness in the aftertaste reminds you about the hops. Drinkability .... you're kidding, right? I could drink this beer all afternoon and night and into the early morning. Or at least until I see those little green fairies I was looking for when I had that Absinthe. Amazing beer. Great job 3F's."
"D- Awesome....once the 6rs come out it will be a staple..."
"The smell is full of citrus grapefruit hops; not your typical wheat beer. Medium bodied, the mouth feel from the bitter hops is the primary attraction at first. The flavor is lightly hopped and lemony. The wheat element seems to help it finish very clean. As the mix warms the beverage settles out; quite drinkable. Scores points for imagination. At 4.8 % ABV this will session well."
" Moderate carbination, and refreshing light mouthfeel makes this a very drinkable and enjoyable treat from a great brewery.. get this one."
"Highly drinkable. Being a hophead with a passion for Imperial IPA's I could down quite a few of these bombers. A pefect beer for these summer months and another winner from Three Floyd's. I look forward to giving this as gifts to friends and family in German beer loving Cincinnati."
"Low alcohol, incredible smoothness, refreshing qualities, and balanced flavors make this beer supremely drinkable."
"Pours a clear tinted golden color with a fluffy white two finger head that quickly dies down to a bubble filled thin layer. Not much lacing or stickiness at all. Smell is a sweet but not overpowering candy like odor. A very nice clean citrus hop is mixed in there as well. Taste was very surprising for a wheat ale. I've heard its quite hoppy for this style, but wow. Taste starts of with a strong amarillo hop bite but is quickly taken back by the wheat. A tiny bit of bready malt comes to the tongue in the aftertaste, could probably use a bit more IMO. Mouthfeel is light/medium bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation, love how this one feels. I could easily put these down on a hot summer day, or any day. I definitely need to trade for this one again. This style is slowly growing on me. Tough to decide between this and Southern Tier Hop Sun, but I think Gumballhead has the slight edge."
"D - Leaves your mouth feeling clean with a slight bitterness on the tongue, I would prefer Hop Sun for price reasons, but still an awesome beer."
"I went into this not having a clue what to expect. I must say, I am very pleased with what this turned out to be. It poured a medium orange colour with a pure white head that faded away in about 30 seconds. Body of the liquid was a bit cloudy. Smell was pleasantly sweet and rather hoppy, like smelling a bowl of assorted candies and hop flowers. Very nice. Taste is a bit light, but there is still easily enough flavour present; substantial hops with the the lightness of the wheat. This quite good and actually thirst quenching. With an abv of 4,8%, this is highly drinkable! Smashing!"
"Wish I could find more of this around my area."
"22oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a slightly cloudy golden color with a tiny beige head. The head dissappears very quickly. No lacing. Aromas include orange, lemon, and a suprisingly big dose of hops. Flavor is very crisp with a lemony bite. A hint of banana in there also. This beer could almost be described as an IPA mixed with a wheat beer. The mouthfeel is very light and refreshing with a good amount of carbonation. A pleasent surprise in the wheat category!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Carbonation is excellent. Definitely smooth and sessionable. Overall, it's a great beer. Clearly I have a new favorite for the summer."
"Very smooth and easy drinking. Can't wait for the six-packs..."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"This is one helluva beer. I just wish I didn't have to drive two states away to find it. Who am I kidding...I'd go for it again in a heartbeat."
"D: This is a perfect summer beer. I already see myself playing bags and drinking many Gumball's as the summer heats up."
"Carbonation was low and did not give a lot of fizz. Body is medium."
"The Foodery is a little expensive so I'm sure I overpaid for this but it was worth it just to try it"
"On a hot day I could guzzle three or four of these 22ozers without thinking about it, but it pales to complex ales and robust weisbiers. Next picknick I go to will include at least one of these."
"This is one of those beers that is just enjoyable to drink from first sip to the last. Gumballhead is a great tasting craft beer that doesnt need to be extreme in IBUs or AC to make it good, and I suspect if more BMC drinkers tried this one, they would be converted to craft beers for sure!"
"Many thanks to jpm30 for the opportunity to try this refreshing beverage. Pours a straw, golden color with some haze to it. Medium sized head with a great deal of carbonation but it faded somewhat quickly. The smell isn't too strong, some nice fruit scents are what come first and a small scent of hops. At first I was taking sips of this beer and it was too cold to make a good judgement. I thought bland and carbonated but as it warmed it became clear what this is all about. Lemon zest with other fruits intermingling. I can almost taste a little honey, melon type sweetness. It literally improved sip by sip and seemed pretty phenominal to me. Mouthfeel was a little light and a little too carbonated but nothing too serious to fuss about. Drinkability makes this one choice for a nice summer day. I could down these without hesitation and still remember to enjoy them in the meantime. When I'm playing golf this summer I'll pray to have obtained a case of this stuff beforehand. YUM!"
"Poured from a bomber into a Weizen Glass, the beer appeared a cloudy yellow copper, no head and sparse lacing. Smell is fruity hops, with a malt backing. Lemon zest. Taste is outstanding. Hoppy grapefruit, mellowed by malt and sweetness. Mouthful is exceptionally refreshing and crisp. I can't wait to sip one of these on a hot day. Very drinkable, a great wheat beer."
"Drinkability: If all Three Floyds beers are like this, maybe I should consider a move to Indiana. Really exceptional, this one. Only 4.8% alcohol? Very sessionable."
"Poured into a weizen glass a bright gold color that is relatively clear with little head (maybe this isn't the freshest bottle, but with no date code, I can't tell). Minimal lacing. Smell is very mild -- some citrus, some hops, some wheat. Taste is outstanding. Great mix of fruit, wheat, and hops. More refreshing than most wheats. Hops give a very nice finish. Not as cloying as some wheats. Exceptional drinkability -- the 22oz bomber left me wanting another, and if I had one on hand, I would have had another."
"d - this is as good a summer beer as there is. it begs you to take long deep quaffs and with the low ABV i could drink this all day long on an alabama summer's day..."
"D: Bolder than most wheat beers that I have sampled. Very clean and refreshing. A summer picnic brew if ever there was one. Enjoy in the sun."
"I could drink quite a few of these babies in row and it was pleasure to get my hands on one. My first FFF beer and it was a great start."
"I may have found the perfect summer beer. Perfect for me, anyway, and anyone else who is a big fan of hops. It's ingenious, really. A hoppy wheat beer. Why didn't I think of this? I love my IPA's, but they're a little heavy for the summer months, so I tend to move towards wheats/hefes. This beer gives you the benefits of wheat...a little lighter, a little more crisp, but you get to keep the hops! I've taken off points of other beers for not being within style guidelines and think I need to be somewhat consistent or this score would be even higher. The IBU's on this one would certainly exceed the norm, but if you're going to stray from the guidelines do it on the side of hops as far as I'm concerned. Very well done!"
"Drinkability: I like what FFF's is doing in this beer, but Amarillo hops have yet to truly impress me. Gumballhead with mostly Centennials would be tremendous. It's still very refreshing and quaffable."
"Cheers2Beers"
"lingering bitterness, fruitiness, and wheat texture make for a really nice aftertaste. if it went into my mouth the way it tasted after it left, it'd be all fives for sure."
"Overall: Thanks very much to ggaughan for another great beer. I liked this one a lot. I would drink it more often if I could get it."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle with no dating info. Was a hazy golden yellow color. Had a small head that quickly dissipated to a constant film. Some lacing and good carb. The aroma is heavy on the hops along with the citrus notes. Heavy on pine. The mouthfeel is good but not as good as other wheats. The taste is also pretty good. Starts off very hoppy with a good bite of bitter but finishes smooth. The only issue I have is that it's not what I what/expect when I get a wheat. I'm expecting some much smoother and obviously less hoppy. As such, this is a great beer but not a great wheat in my book. Still, highly recommend because whatever you call it it's still good (4, RR, T, Y)"
"Poured into a pint glass - vibrant yellow like sunshine in a glass with a nice white & foamy head that sticks around for a while. Lots of tiny carbonation bubbles are floating to surface as well. Smell is citrusy with a some floral character. Reminds me of summer - light and refreshing. Taste is crisp and refreshing - lemon and bread upfront with a hoppy kick in the back. Very complex and different from any other wheat beer I've tried. Mouthfeel is perfect and emphasizes the strong characteristics of this beer. I could drink this all night long. Perfect for a long summer day. Highly Recommended."
"Poured out gold with a little fluffy head. Smelled floral and citrusy. Tasted sweet and bitter, fairly hoppy aftertaste, a little malt. Smooth on the tounge, though the aftertaste lingers. Not bad for a Texas winter day (eg 72 and sunny out and I took down the christmas lights), but not one of my favorites."
"A light bodied wheat ale that is smooth and very drinkable. This bottle seems fresh and in it's prime."
"Thanks to DavidEddie for this one."
"The mouthfeel of this beer is great. Is heavily carbonated with light, small bubbles, and is lighter than many other big-time APAs. A very good beer that is worth picking up whenever you can find it."
"Pours a clear bright golden color with a foamy white head that fades into a sticky lace. Nose is fresh pine and ripe grapefruit along with a bit of wheat. The key player in the taste is the zesty citrusy hop bitterness but there is also fruity lemon, some mint, and bubblegum flavors blended in. A bit of pine resin is present in the finish. This is a very refreshing and easy drinking beer. Sure wish this was available locally."
"Drinkability is insane. I would have no problem drinking another bomber of this and I'm not yet finished with this one. FFF rolled the dice and it paid off. This is a delicious brew."
"Drinkability was good, seeing as I drank both bombers, but I won't be switching over right away."
"I had almost written off this whole beer style, but this beer here blew me away. Bad ass."
"D - Excellent. Just about the most thirst quenching brew I've ever tasted. Even my belches tasted wonderful. Alas, I am not a rich man, and this is one very expensive brew that is not really worth the ticket price IMO."
"Pours a medium golden color into my tall pilsner glass ... decent-sized head of white fluff. Dissipates rather quickly. Lots of lacing in the inner wall of the glassware. Nose is ... wow ... hoppy. Predominent citrus, spice and floral notes. Not your typical wheat beer scent. Palate is hoppy right up front, with subdued notes of citrus and wheat grains. Slightly sweet in the finish, but dries quickly. Mouthfeel is medium and somewhat acidic. Plenty of bittering hop character throughout. This is a very unusual wheat beer. This is a wheat beer for the IPA lover. Very hoppy, crisp, and clean. Marry a Bell's Oberon with a Bell's Two Hearted ale and you'll find something very similar to this offering from Three Floyds."
"Excellent mouthfeel, and extremely drinkable."
"Poured from a 22oz. bomber into a pint glass a dark yellow, almost orange along with half an inch of white head. Minimal lacing on the glass. I literally smelled the citrus and pine from the hops the second my bottle opener cracked the seal (and the bottle was a good 12 inches from my nose), The first taste is lemon then orange followed by grapefruit and malt. I swear I caught the slightest hint of peppermint in the finish as well as a good dose of resinous pine. Medium bodied with above average carbonation and a light oily coating on the tongue. Delicious. I always have this on hand in the warmer months and reward myself with a bottle every few weeks. It is quite a unique wheat beer and one that I would love to drink on a regular basis if it were not for the price. Worth seeking out."
"This ale poured a light golden amber with a thin creamy head, with nice lacings. Nose is caramel, some wheat and nuttiness, with big grapefruit and piney hoppiness. The taste is one hoppy wheat beer, with more on the hops than the wheat. Good mouthfeel, well carbonated light bodied beer."
"t"
"Drinkability and notes: Only had half the bomber, but I could of had it all. A nice beer that probably goes better in the summer months with its low alcohol level and refreshing character."
"all the other stuff is pretty good"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer; however, I think is presents itself more like an IPA or double IPA than an American Pale Wheat Ale."
"The drinkability is good, Better then good but I was expecting a little More. MK"
"Deep golden, clear, with a gauze-y, persistent, glass-crawling, off-white head. Nose is hopalicious. Pungent cannabis-y resins suggest Columbus hops, buckets of them. Sweetbread malt dances in the background. Toasted malt up front soon gives way to a fruitier, wheaty base. But this is all about the hops. Im picking up sea-air Saaz funk, raw, resinous chronic, herbal mintiness, and citrus zest hoppiness. Wow. Light malt sweetness plays its part, though, making this very drinkable. Medium-bodied, with a quaffable feel. Finish is long and hoppy. Very refreshing and appetizing. This should be available in 12 packs throughout the summer, all over the place."
"Gumballhead was a golden orange color with a thick white head. The head had good retention and lacing. The aroma was great with lots of fruity hops. The taste was great as well with plenty of fruity hop flavor and a slightly bitter, longlasting, dry finish. The body was medium and so was the carbonation. Drinkability was excellent. This was the most hoppy and best wheat beer I have tried. A superb beer that I highly recommend."
"Note: There was no sediment in the bottle despite the label claim that it was bottle conditioned."
"Drinkability is excellent. This beer is not overly powerful in flavor but a delightful sipper. An excellent choice for a hot summer day."
"D: Extremely tasty, not very filling, quite easy to drink, with the low ABV, this is a beer that you can just keep on drinking and drinking. As a huge Dreadnaught fan, I think the best way to describe this beer is “Dreadnaught Lite”."
"Slainte!"
"I do love that some of the Dreadnaught hop flavors (exclusively from the Armarillo hops?) are in here. Could improve by a little bit more action toward the finish. A very good beer though, and hoppy for the style. Recommended."
"Thanks to BA NucularGeorge for the bottle. Once again, f'n george!!!"
"Poured a 22oz bomber into a tall boy. The minute I took the first whiff I knew I was going to love this one. Nice golden haze with an inch of white head. Lacing follows all the way to the last sip. Hoppy citrus at the nose. Nice hop bittnerness rounded out with smooth citrus notes. Superb mouthfeel with a crisp, refreshing citrus finish. This is a fantastic beer. The best way to sum this up is a Corona commercial. A perfect summertime beer with all the refreshment one could ask for. No lime needed here folks. Three Floyd's does it again. For me this is one of the best beers I have ever tasted. I probably love it so much because of the APA characteristics it has. If you didn't see wheat written on the bottle you would have no idea it was one. If you are a big fan of the wheat taste you may not be too impressed here. Glad I have a nice stash of these to enjoy over the winter. Very expensive for me though. The 22oz bombers were $5.99 each. Would I buy again? Without question....yes!"
"A very nice offering. A great beer to enjoy on a summer day. Would go great with a nice chicken ceaser salad. This is a nice must try for anyone who likes hops or wheat, and even better if you are a fan of both."
"For a good wheat beer thats full of wheat flavour and true wheat gumminess i will stick to Capital Island Wheat, its like chewing on wheat from a bottle."
"Loved it."
"Gumballhead pours a dirty bright yellow, a very pasty thin white swirling head. The nose is an on/off combo of faint hops, fresh fruit, herbs and definitive citrus-like aromas, more noticeable towards the middle-to-end of this beverage. The initial taste could confuse some of the most experienced beer lovers--a hop-infused wheaty biscuity blend. There is a fair amount of carbonation, in fact a bit over-powering at times. Zesty, creamy and hoppy; each sip and drink develops a sort of a different blend of flavorings, am I enjoying a hop-infused-wheat beer here? Yes. Lemon peels, orange juice and table crackers noted in the body. With 3-Floyds, it's not a surprise that they've ""hopped up"" another brew, but this AP Wheat Ale tops em' all--this is a gem, smooth and slick and a winner in my book."
"Overall this has been a great drinking experience, much better than I had thought as a not so big fan of wheat beers. I'd buy it again for sure."
"Final Notes: What a fantastic beer. Extremely easy to drink with a ton of flavor to boot. Hoppy as can be with a really nice wheat profile thrown in to balance things out. A hopheads wheat. A great session beer at 4.8 % abv. Gumballhead has been a favorite of mine for sometime. Don't know why it took me so long to review. I wish 3 Floyds would make this a year long offering. I highly recommend Gumballhead. What a true session beer is all about. Seek and thoroughly enjoy."
"In all, I still find Gumballhead to be another pleasing offering from our boys in Munster & its wonderful to see a summer beer focusing on something other than the standard takes on the weizen or kölsch styles. A great change of pace, Im just sad that summer is at an end & this is my last chance to enjoy it until next year."
"Gumballhead pours a straw color with a white head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma has a citrus note. The flavor is really nice, citrus is dominant. Wheat definitely gives its flavor to this beer as well. Excellent American wheat beer. Highly recommended."
"This might be the most drinkable beer I've ever laid my hands on. High scores across the board, nice warm feeling and yet not even slightly buzzing after a 22oz'er.... Is it possible to get this in the keg? I want one, for my wedding. Not even kidding. Not in the slightest, this is so drinkable I'm almost wishing I live in Indiana. Almost."
"22oz. bottle. Poured a clear light gold color, with a moderate white head. Aroma was citrus and flowers, faint honey, and a grape/wine note near the end? Flavor was quite mild, mainly hops, but balanced with citrus and wheat very well. Body was light and effervescent, highly carbonated and very easy to drink. A very enjoyable beer, probably my favorite wheat beer out there. I hope 3F continues to distribute in MD."
"I would buy this again and again if I could. If I wanted a refreshing beer this would fit the bill. If I wanted a hoppy beer this would do the job."
"D - Very easy drinker. I could easily have a few of these in an evening."
"D- Very good! This is an excellent brew. Goes down very easy and could drink a lot of this especially with it's low ABV. Would be perfect on a very hot summer day."
"Overall, I was really pleasantly surprised by this brew. It's still a wheat, but it's been bastardized and morphed into something so much more. Very much worth the effort to try it, and one I'd recommend to anyone who is a wheat fan, as well as anyone who thinks American wheats have to suck by their very nature."
"I got to try this out one night on tap, but the others I tried before ruined my palate. Now that I've had a 22 oz. bomber, I can say this is one fo the best wheat or pale ale, let alone wheat pale ale. Very very easy to consume. Nice balance of malts and hops, just one great beer to consume . . . over and over."
"Bomber from Bowling Green. Pours a pretty crystal clear dark gold with nice lively carbonation. Medium white head recedes quickly and leaves some nice lacing on the surface. Aroma is citrusy and herbal hops and sweetness. Taste is sweet grapefruit from the combination of the citrusy hops and sweet malt and wheat. Nice clean lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth and nicely carbonated. Quite drinkable. Very good beer and very unique."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Easy and smooth, great for this style. I do prefer the bottled version over the draft, I think the bottle conditioning has a lot to do with the subtle complexities that really make this beer a standout."
"Rates very on on drinkability. It has great flavor and complexity, yet remains gracefully balanced."
"It's a very unique taste and is quite delicious. The sweetness is different but very welcome. I sure wish I could get this in LA."
"Poured into a pint glass at the brewpub with a mildly cloudy body, orangish deliciousness floated about. The nose was slightly floral, but very hoppy. A good amount of typical wheat smell, which I admit I don't care for too much, but the hops masked the smells I usually don't like in a wheat. Amarillo hop bite on top of a subtle, fruity beer was good, the hops stayed in my mouth to prevent that overly fruity aftertaste in most wheats. Fascinating, a wheat I was able to finish!"
"D- Goes down well for being so hoppy the 22oz if enough for one sitting IMHO."
"A golden honey-colored body, topped by a prodigious white head. A candy-like sweet smell really reminds you of gumballs. Go figure! The taste is amazingly different than many IPAs. A citrus/orange/tangerine flavour greets you before the sweetness of the malt hits you. Then a nice bittering hop bite comes through at the end of the swallow. A really interesting beer. Mouthfeel is medium, with low carbonation. Drinkability is fantastic."
"Drinkability/Overall: another hoppy Three Floyds rendition of anotherwise mild style. A cheater for the style, but still tasty and drinkable enough. Now the price tag is a whole other story, I still don't know where they get off charging $8-9 a bottle for this stuff, especially after it was $5 last year."
"Poured with a low head that died quickly. The color is somewhere between orange and gold, but I've saw it only in artificial light so I could be off. What strikes you about the smell is the sweetness more than anything else. The smell makes you treat the beer as you would a sweet beverage and you tend to twirl it around the tip of your tongue - and you'll notice the sweetness is there all right. Reminds me of wine made from litchi fruit. Eminently drinkable for its taste, mouthfeel (it does tend to leave your mouth ever so slightly dry) and low abv. This one is another hell of a beer coming out of Three Floyds."
"I'm not a big fan of wheat beers, but this one I enjoy. Thoroughly drinkable. At 4.8% abv, this is a great (all-day) session beer I suppose, but I prefer a stronger brew. Easily the most flavorful beer I've had under 5% abv."
"drinkability is good. relatively low ABV makes it easy to go through the bottle. wish i had a bunch of these."
"Drinkability: A great summer beer--one that shows how great hops can be as a cleanser on a hot day. Truly refreshing, as the wheat keeps the beer light and quaffable. But I can't help feeling that this is almost a wheat APA or IPA (the hops profile is about the same as Alpha King), rather than a APWA. I can't make up my mind if this is style-defiance, too much of a hop thing, or perhaps a little cheatery. But never let that get in the way of drinking another exceptional FFF offering."
"Beer pours with a hazy dark golden color. There is little head, but an interesting lacing pattern left on top of the beer once poured. Taste is phenomenally balanced. A perfect mix of strong hops and malts, with a wonderful kiss of wheat throughout. Maybe its just the name getting to me, but there is also a hint of bubblegum to it, like some hops are known to have. I must say that the wheat is the most impressive part. Its hard for many beers to balance the hops and wheat, but this succeeds wildly."
"Overall, this is one nice Heffe. Refreshing for those warm summer days and smooth for those cool summer nights. Believe the hype, this one is a keeper!"
"Drinkability: Not a hop-bomb like some of the other offerings from Three Floyds. All in all pretty nice. I could stand to have a few pints of this."
" Such a shame that the rest of their offerings, except for the Robert the Bruce Scottish Ale, are not to be found in my beloved Garden State. Sure, this isn't a typical Pale Wheat Ale, since they may as put the ""wheat"" in small letters on the bottle. It doesn't matter to me - I really enjoyed this and think that Three Floyd's has hit another home run here. Highly recommended!"
"Extremely full body, as expected with Three Floyd's. Lots of flavor, a joy to drink, especially on a hot day. My compadres were drinking Rolling Rock and all I could do was laugh. Paid $5 and I'll do it again."
"The mouth is crisp and tart. Very drinkable beer. This is not your everyday wheat beer. Seek it out!"
"I had this on tap at the Three Floyd's brewpub and was quite impressed. I was told they use Amarillo hops in this wheat and that is one of the reasons I was very interested in trying it out. While technically it is an American wheat ale, it is unlike any other I have ever had. I tend to dislike standard American wheat ales finding them to be very bland and definitely needing the lemon wedge they are served with. This beer destroyed that stereotype. The amarillo hop addition gives this beer quite a bit of flavor. The hops have a citrusy, similar to grapefruit flavor to go along with their bite and it really makes quite an impression when drinking Gumballhead. I can find this beer in 22oz bottles, but most liquor stores want $6 / bottle, and unfortunately I just can't justify spending that kind of money. Great beer, but the limited production quantities keeps the price a little too high."
"A must try."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and pleasant, but IMO this beer is overly hopped, leading to a somewhat astringent bitterness that masks the subtle nuances of the wheat beer. This is a blend between an IPA and a wheat, and it does a disservice to both."
"Pours gold to straw in color with a decent white head that recedes quickly. Although the bottle reads bottle conditioned, it looks pretty clear to me. The smell is distinctive three floyds with big citrusy hops. There is some grapefruit and sweet peach aroma. Taste is also quite hoppy with the wheat adding a little sweetness to the orange and peach flavors. The wheat is barely discernible behind the citrusy hops, maybe just a little nutty flavor. A little spiciness and dryness in the finish, light to medium body. This one definitely doesn'y typify the style category, more like a pale ale maybe even an ipa, but a very good and highly drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: A most unusual but extraordinary brew"
"Then I tried Gumballhead, due to people constantly complimenting it. Poured a golden, light orange bubbly brew. Decent head that goes away pretty quickly with very light lacing to be left behind. A tad cloudy due to the yeast conditioning. Smelled of lemony citrus and hops. Very pleasing aroma. This is a very unique wheat beer and has much depth; something severely lacking in many wheats imo. When the beer is still very cold, you would swear you were drinking an IPA. Hop bitterness, grassiness, smacking you all over the place. When it warms up a bit, the wheat presence shows it's face and the hops bitterness becomes a little more sweet and citrusy. Mouthfeel is light, slippery, and crisp. Great beer for these hot summer days. I am highly impressed with this offering from FFF, who never fail to impress me. They pulled off the unthinkable, they turned me onto a wheat beer!!"
"A bit of a different wheat beer. Had this on tap at KClingers (Hanover). Can definitely smell and taste the hops. Great lemony aroma. Hops adds a little bit of a bite to the taste. Not my favorite wheat, but I'm glad I tried it. Actually has a bit of a hoppy finish."
"Overall this beer is over-rated. I will not buy another. I have liked all other Three Floyds offerings but I would say that the FFF name may be skewing the ratings for this one. If the label said ""BUD"" I doubt this would rate so high."
"D: I could probably drink these all day in the sun. Smooth, refreshing, thirst quenching, all with a low abv. Three Floyds has got it figured out."
"Mouthfeel- The best bitter tasting APWA I've ver head. very complex palate for a wheat beer. Lots of surprises that were very pleasant."
"This beer is very very drinkable. A great beer to session with great flavor and is nice around the edges. An all around great beer."
"Picked this up a couple weeks ago in Council Bluffs. It lived up to my expectations--hoppy yet light. Too bad 3F doesn't distribute in Minnesota otherwise this could be a constant session beer for me."
"Poured from a 22oz. bomber into two weizen glasses. Appearance is a hazy golden brass-hued amber color with a thin head with a constant ring of white lacing that clings to the glass. Aroma is sweet and hoppy, citrusy notes mainly grapefruit, no real wheat or grain smells present, although may very well be the source of the sweetness I can't quite put my finger on. Taste is very similar to the smell, wheat is exceptionally well hidden behind the hoppiness, and can only taste any wheat in the aftertaste. Tastes much like a milder version of an IPA, maybe a hoppier APA, nothing like any other wheat beer I've had the pleasure of sampling. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied, lighter end of the carbonation spectrum. Finishes dry and crisp with a slight grassiness from the high amount of hops in this beer. Overall, a very enjoyable and delectable beer that I will definitely purchase again. Yet another fine offering from the good folks at FFF's."
"Cheers!"
"The tough part is that $10.99 sticker on the bottle. Still, I will be revisiting this when the opportunity presents itself. And as of today, Munster, Indiana will now officially be part of my route if and when I take another drive across the country."
"Peachy gold, miniscule carbonation streams, dense, crater-pocked snow-white foam. Honeyed orange blossom and otherwise variegated citric aromas mix with melon and berry scents. Fierce yet subtly melded hop flavors of orange rind, peach nectar, sugared nasturtiums, etc. I honestly don't taste much in the way of wheat, but there's some sort of sturdy but definitely understated malt bill going on here. The cool thing about this beer is that the hops are definitely the star of the show, so the malt just gets out of the way, playing a strong but demure supporting role. But the hops are anything but brash. They're just all summery floral and the like. Light and airy mouthfeel, goes down substantially enough but remains devastatingly refreshing. I am so goddam jealous of those of you out there with regular access to this beer (not to mention other Three Floyds offerings). I had to drive to freakin' New Jersey to get this bottle! Aah, but it was worth it. Excellent beer."
"This beer is exceptional. It pours a nice dark golden, with no haze, but also very little head. The nose is very nice- some nice crisp hops and some pronounced fruitiness. The taste is amazing, some nice hop bitterness and spiciness up front followed by a surge of juicy fruitiness that tastes almost like a gumball, followed by a nice clean but full wheat finish. The mouthfeel is rich for a wheat beer and a little less crisp than some, as it coats the mouth a little, but still quite good. I could drink this all night. The flavor keeps pulling you back for another swallow. Unique!"
"This is quickly becoming one of my favorites. The taste is amazing, the smell is great, it has a amber color that looks inviting...I have nothing bad to say about this beer...Is is such a shame it is a seasonal beer, I could drink this year-round. It is nice to know there is a keg at the bar waiting for me to get off work, makes my day!"
"Pretty highly carbonated, and it comes across a bit harsh, as if they've monkeyed with the mineral treatment. Definitely easy to knock back a few of these, and a fine companion to bright summer day. Kudos to FFF for making a moderate-alcohol beer with a big hop presence, but I'd prefer more malt to balance it out."
"This is an extremely drinkable beer, especially on hot summer days. Very enjoyable. It is the only beer I can think of where a little burp after drinking tasted as good as the beer did going down."
"I like the fact this beer is so flavorful (but not complex) and low in alcohol. This is a true session beer aside from the fact it is almost $7 a bomber. I like this beer on face value. I think this beer is very lame once I deconstruct it. I cant help but think what is the point? If I want an American Wheat beer I want, well, wheatiness to be prevalent. Likewise, if I want a hoppy beer I know where to look (APA, IPA, etc) plus its not very bitter. So, Gumballhead is a wheatless American Wheat with tons of hops? Why? See, now I am just ranting and going of the point. This is a very drinkable beer. Enough said. I am happy I finally tried it. I purchased by bombers in Council Bluffs, IA."
"As other reviewers have said, this is no pale wheat ale, much more like a pale ale or ipa with its intense hop taste. The combination of amarillo hops and the wheat make this a unique beer. If you're in the mood for a wheat beer, maybe go for something else, but I'm reaching for this over any true pale wheat anyday. I'm very excited that Gumballhead has finally made it to Iowa!"
"It's kinda silly to call this beer a Pale Wheat Ale. It's not accurate and it's not fair. It's not accurate because this beer is certainly an IPA with an American wheat / barley malt base; whereas most IPAs have a standard barley malt base only. It's not fair because this beer is hands-down a better beer than any other Pale Wheat Ale that I have ever drank. Calling this beer a Pale Wheat is misleading and completely over-hopped for it's style. The alcohols show an interesting evaporative cooling effect without much drying. The hops, although pleasantly citrus, adds a mild dish-soap flavor that becomes distracting as the beer warms. Though I can see why so many BA's rate this beer so high, I'm not going to get carried away with the hype."
"A wee bit watery, but that's even better for the sun. I could've gone for a bit more carbonation. Hoppy like a pale ale, but it plays well at a refreshingly low temp. This stuff is summertime gold. And I just drank my only bottle. Better stock up. There's a lot of July to go."
"The fabled gumballhead. A nice beer...pours up crystal clear honey gold color with a frothy all white head....no lacing to speak of but a nice cap on the beer. The smell is predominately piney hops, not what I expect from a wheat beer but intriguing, also a bit of dry grain and some buttery notes...diacetyl? The taste is good not awe inspiring but good light malts up front, citrus and pine in the center, and a nice hop kick followed by some oily grain aftertaste...decent. The mouthfeel is too watery for me....the smoothness of the flavor is overshadowed by the watery texture. I do have to say that on the top level..for all folks this would be a mighty quaffable entry...you could drink these all night and keep coming back for more...enough endearing features to keep me coming back again...if I could pick this up in a seasonal six pack I could convert some macro drinkers in a hurry."
"Very drinkable and refreshing. An excellent all seasons ale. Thanks to orbitalr0x for this gem."
"Excellent quality product, kind of weird. worth trying."
"Hazy orange-amber with a small, white, creamy, mostly diminishing head. I didnt read the label first because I dont like to first try a beer with any preconceived ideas about the beer. So all I read was the front, Gumaballhead, Three Floyds, Wheat Beer. Yeah, wheat beer. So of course I was shocked when I took a whiff of this stuff and got bitch-slapped by some serious hops. NOT what I was expecting. Once I regrouped and knew what I was smelling, and took some time to really enjoy the wonderful citrus and piney hops aromas supported by some nice, bready, caramel malts and THEN the wheat, which is pretty far in the background of the nose. In the taste, theres more of a wheat presence here than in the aroma, but still not very strong. Theres a good marriage of bitter citrus and sweet malts going on here. The light flavor of wheat brings along a little bit of bubblegum toward the finish but is quickly pushed aside. It has a medium body, dry texture and light carbonation. This beer was a very unique and wonderful experience. Surprisingly easy-drinking for as hoppy as the aroma is. Wish I had more than 1 bottle of this stuff. Thanks to hero27 for allowing me the pleasure of trying this fine beverage."
"Very high drinkability. I could drink another right now."
"Clear gold with a frothy white head. Decent retention and a fair amount of lacing. Very fragrant, powdery citrus hops (kind of like crushed up sweet tarts) dominate the aroma, with fruity and piney character as well. Aspirin bitterness with fruity hops and smooth sweetness from the malt and wheat. Fruity bitterness lingers. Moderate carbonation provides a bit of crispness while the body was a little heavier than I expected, but still light enough to make this a highly drinkable beer. The balance was great and the flavour profile was quite unique. Very enjoyable."
"Tastes of hops, wheat, malt, and your citrus flavors shine threw for this tasty brew, not to mention the almost honey like after taste. The carbonation was good, the mouthfeel was great and the drinkablilty excellent. I really enjoyed this wheat beer from 3F and I thank DOC Jordison from Tucson for sending it up to ames Iowa for me."
"Taste; those piney and citric hops are right there in your face, but I like it. The sweet malts definitely make a nice appearance, once you let this warm up a bit. The wheat is more felt than tasted, and lightly at that, which gives this a close to medium bodied mouthfeel. This reminds me more of an APA or IPA than it did of a wheat beer, but despite the lack of any wheat flavors, I still like this offering from Three Floyds. I just wish it felt and tasted more like a wheat beer."
"A perfect session beer and the quintessential summer brew."
"I look forward to seeking out a greater quantity of this one, for sure!"
"Jen: From first whiff I knew that this was going to be different. I don't normally expect to smell hops, but that is all I could smell. Although shocked, I was looking forward to my first sip. All I could taste at first was the hops, but after I swallowed, I got a definite taste of wheat and a slight honey that was fun. This may be low in ABV, but it is definitely good. Light and crisp and it goes down smoothly."
"The carbonation was just right and added a good bite to this summer brew."
"I really like this beer, and it had some complex flavor, though I wish it was a bit more balanced. I will be buying this again though, no doubt."
"This ones light, creamy and very easy to drink."
"delicious but puckering and big for a wheat beer, limiting consumption possibility."
"This is a standout in the class. Crisp wheat malt flavors with a touch of citrus. Bold hopping that balanced nicely against the malt for a sharp, refreshing finish. Perhaps the best example of a highly hopped wheat ale I've run across. Hard to find a beer with this hopping and still a low abv."
"Drinkability: Definitely wouldn't have issues slamming down a couple of these brews."
"I think Gumballhead is almost as cool as Fritz the Cat."
"D: Tasty beer. Bit too bitter without the high range hop flavors."
"Drinkability: I wish I had more!"
"Color runs between gold and light copper. High clarity, strong appearance of carbonation. Head is wispy and white, but short with decent retention. Smell of sweet malt and grapefruit-like hop aroma is very strong, much like an IPA. The taste opens with a rich grapefruit/citrus flavor, fading toward a relatively clean finish with mild alcohol and moderate bitterness. Mouthfeel is light and perhaps a bit watery, but with nice carbonation. To review this beer honestly, I believe its an average wheat beer, but the over-addition of amarillo hops gives it a strong Alpha King-like flavor to please the hop loving crowd. I just thought it could have been built better, with more balance perhaps..."
"Let me explain something I'm really not a fan of Wheat beers for the reason of the lack of hops, just a matter of personal taste. So while this wheat beer is not the traditional style of wheat beer it works for me."
"Served in a weizen glass, it's dark gold with about a 3/4 inch head. The aroma is flowery, citrus and hops. It tastes like hops and citrus, with a good medium body and a light oily mouthfeel. It's very drinkable, goes down relatively easy, but with a slightly bitter floral aftertaste which lingers a little while (which isn't a bad thing). I can't taste much wheat in it, to me it's closer to a pale ale than a wheat beer, even though it's a combination of both. The lace stays on the glass for a while, too. I'm not a big pale ale/hoppy beer person, but this beer is pretty good. It's hoppy, but not overpowering. Nice and refreshing! I would drink this again, it's a quality brew. Not too bad getting a deuce deuce bomber of it for $6.99."
"I really like the 3F interpretation of the wheat beer. Their hop additions to the standard wheat beer make this very tasty. I really like the balance between the biscuity feel and the hop/citrus goodness. Very tasty beer. I could definitely drink more than one of these in a sitting."
" I can, and have, put a hurting on a bunch of these bad boys. VERY DRINKABLE, IMO."
"A solid brew no doubt, but it didn't live up to the hype in my eyes."
"Pours a golden, light-amber color with a huge, billowy, rocky head that lasted to some degree until the very last sip. Left amazing lacing along my glass. Aroma is fairly hoppy, sweet, fruity, a bit of citrus and bready, yeasty smell. Taste is rather light, clean, and fruity with a bit of hops in the finish. Finish is clean and slightly bitter. Mouthfeel is light, very smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. The most restrained Three Floyds beer I've had so far, but this only makes it quite drinkable. I could easily see drinking a couple of these over a summer day and would expect most people to like it."
"It tasted awesome, I don't know why I waited so long to try this beer. It had the body and the yeasty fruity flavor of a hefeweizen, but tasted kind of more citrucy. I placed the drinkability at 5 because it goes down so easy and has pretty low alcohol content."
"From a bottle brought to beer club meeting. Fairly clear, orangey, white foamy head. apricot, aromatic hop odor. smells fantastic. peachy apricot taste. bitterness grows over time and becomes very full and hoppy aftertaste is a nice hop flavor with some citrus grapefruitness on the finish. full and strong mouthfeel. another delicious offering from 3F."
"This is an extremely drinkable beer. Great flavor, not very filling, refreashing, and low in alcohol. A great summer beer. It was great to try this beer once. However, I probably won't buy it again due to the hefty price tag. $6.99 is kind of a lot to pay for a 22oz wheat ale. At least in my opinion."
"Brassy pale orange under a thin white froth. Big Amarillo piney aroma, bits of yeast, and loads of citrus but no wheat. Tastes almost rye like, very spicy but perfectly balanced with grapefruit and other citrus. Drinkable in huge quantities. Wonderful mouthfeel has all the best qualities of an APA and a wheat beer. Does this fit the style? Does this fit any style? I dont know but I do know that this is damn fine stuff. If it wasnt so pricy I drink it by the barrel. As it is, I cant justify drinking this more than once."
"Tasted 3 Floyds brewerey pre dark lord day."
"Drinkability - this goes down very easy, and is very satisfying. I could drink one after another and another anytime, and the abv of 4.8 makes it easier to do so without worry."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This is a full bodied beer. The balance of the beer may be slightly off but it is a treat. This is a very drinkable and sessionable beer."
"I found out from the staff that this is getting bottled currently and should be in stores within a few weeks or less. I hope some make it out my way as I'll definitely keep this in stock until it's all sold out for the year. Another 3F winner."
"Pours a surprising clear yellow-orange. I thought there would be cloudiness to it but there was none. Nice 1 inch white head that lasted a while and left great lacing. Slightly more carbonation than your average beer. Good pop on the nose. Great grassy aromas with a touch of citrus. Flavor was outstanding. Probably the best example of the style, at least that I've had. Grass and citrus with a yeasty, hoppy finish. AMAZING. Not heavy on the pallet making this very easy to drink. This is a great beer for the warmer season coming up."
"This is in my book the ultimate lawnmower beer and simply the best American Style Wheat Beer by at least a factor of two, nothing else comes close. Only real defect is that the hops hide from your nose, but that might not be what you need in a summer beer. Best wheat beer in the USA, all the other brewers could learn a lot from this beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium and clean, crisp, well-carbonated. Not a lot that would characterize this as a weizen, hefe or otherwise (maybe I've been misinformed). Good beer, but if I were tasting it blind, I'd call it a light pale ale. A refreshing summer beer, nonetheless."
"22 oz., bottle-conditioned, with no freshness date - served chilled in a weizen glass. It pours an unfiltered orange/honey color with a 2 finger tan head that leaves big-bubbled lacing. The unfiltered particles look more like hop bits than a yeast cloud. It has a pleasant aroma of wheat and piney/citric hops. The first sip reveals lemon and orange rind with a wheat tang and a good hop bitterness on top of a medium body that feels like it belongs to a beer almost twice its strength. Quite a tasty beer, and even though it has a low ABV, it seems almost like a precurser to wheat wines with the very pronounced wheat and hop characters. I like it, but I wish it weren't $5 a bottle."
"Amen."
"Pouring out a golden hue, with little head retention, some lacing though. Aroma of hops, spice, coriander, lemon, and some grapefruit. Taste of lemon, grapefruit, hops, hops, and hops. Some spice inthe begining but seems to fade quickly for me. the hop bitterness is exception. Although for being a wheat beer this is somewhat of the mark but for an interpretation this is excellent. Citrus overtones, with few hints of bread. Mouthfeel is some what dry and bitter, I find the appeal for IPA's, not so much for wheat beers. Overall this is great. Interpretation, by the Floyd family. Very much a great session beer low alcohol, with great taste. This is one of the Floyd family's best I beleive. Keep on brewing your interpretations."
"Bottle: Poured a slightly hazy gold color beer with a huge bubbly head with average retention. Aroma of citrusy hops is overpowering and I could not discern any wheat. Taste is also totally dominated by the hops and leave very little place for the wheat. Not bad overall, I just dont see were the American wheat fits in because I could not detect any presence of wheat in this beer."
"Pale yellowish copper with about a finger of off-white head. Fruity aroma with citrusy and grassy hops. Also some fairly noticable clove notes. Maybe a touch of caramel too. Well rounded flavor with a nice bitterness up front with some citrus notes and a nice clean wheat finish.. A little caramel provides a nice backbone. Medium bodied. This is a very refeshing beer, I just wish this is something I could enjoy all summer!"
"This is one delicious beer. It had aged in the basement of Table Wine and Spirits for about 6 months, so it is possible that the hops has dissipated a bit. There was, nonetheless, a strong hoppiness. What makes this beer worderful is the way the wheat taste shines through. It is extremely drinkable, and I know it sounds ridiculous to say about a beer that's only 4.8 abv beer, but with an unlimited supply, it could be dangerously so."
"Props to hero27 for supplying."
"Thanks to Rick & Betty for bringing this one back from the heartland."
"D: Quite interesting. I don't think I would drink this all the time, especially at the price, but it would be a welcome diversion from my usual quaffs."
"I'm guessing this beer is dry hopped from the large amount of hops in the aroma. If you blindfolded me and put it in front of me to smell, I'd probably guess it was an IPA. The beer bar that I was at (Fire Waters) sold this bomber for $16. A delicious brew this definitely is, but $16 it is definitely not worth. Seek this beer out, but avoid paying too much for it."
"Additional information: My bottle was refridgerated since its summer release, and is still this good now, that's just crazy, I was afraid to buy it at first because of how long it was sitting there, but I'm so glad I did."
"I could drink this beer all day long... I can't even imagine how nice this is in the summer months. To all you bastards who can get this beer on a regular basis (and more fresh), I am supremely jealous. I can see how this brewery is consistently talked about as one of the top 5 in the U.S."
"Pours a golden color with very small particles in suspension. Head tan with a slight yellow/green tint. Large bubbles can be seen in the head and through the beer. Smell hits you almost as soon as you open the bottle. Orange citrus and more orange. In the first sip, a smooth almost creamy mouthfeel is evident. Hop taste (orange, a bit of lemon) is evident, but not overwhelming. Very pale ale-ish with more body and smoothness. Lingering dry bitterness in the aftertaste. Very smooth and easy to drink. Very enjoyable. Still kind of expensive, but one of the cheaper Three Floyds bombers as well."
"Drinkability - a very good wheat beer, with or without the yeast."
"This poured a hazy deep straw yellow with hints of orange and a small white head. I get a big whiff of orange rind some lemon and not much else. The taste is good, fruity with a hint of bitterness. The fruit is like oranges with a hint of lemon. It has a medium body, low carbonation and has a mostly dry finish. This is very refreshing and very drinkable. I think the hops got attenuated a bit too much from sitting around, I would like to try this when it is fresh."
"In my Jever goblet (courtesy of Dan from the Buy-Rite on Oak Tree Rd. - Thanks!) this beer looks like a mild pilsener with a golden hue that flutters due to the intense carbonation. Aromas of grains, alcohol, tropical fruit, and lemons was just wonderful. The taste was incredible with a crisp lemon-lime like flavor that flows into a hop bitter finish. The smoothness of this beer lends itself to being had in the warmer months with a refreshing character that is absolutely addictive. I just wanted more and more of this beer after my first few sips."
"I know this is billed as a wheat, but I got a mostly hoppy ale feeling from this beer. Don't get me wrong, it was right up there with some of the best pale ales and IPAs I've had recently, but not much of a wheat. Overall, extremely complex and 100% unique."
"Re-review 1/24/13-The carbonation seems much higher than my prior review, closer to 3.0 carbs. Although it says it's bottle conditioned on the label, my beer was very clear with no sediment in the bottle. The carbonation really helps with the head, forming a peaking, rocky light yellow head with awesome retention and great lacing. The nose is still full of grapefruit and mandarin oranges, like a fruit salad or biting into a grapefruit. Wonderful nose. Light bodied, easy to drink, clean, very crisp and refreshing mouthfeel. Finishes bone dry. Medium firm bitterness. A really nice brew. I wish we got 3F up here in northern michigan."
"D: My new favorite summertime brew. I could drink these all day long."
"Edit: After drinking again on multiple occaisions, I had to bump the drinkability and taste up to 5. This beer is simply summer in a bottle - The best drinker I have had to date"
"I have got to hand it to 3F for this one. A big beutiful light amber with a good head that leaves lots of lace. Smells wheaty with traces of honey nicely blended with the big citrus and slight pine smell of Amarillo. The taste is damn close to perfect as the full wheat flavor is a touch sweet and well meet by the hops. A great mouthfeel full and direct even at such a low alcohol content. Very drinkable, just sorry to see this go until next year as this was my last bottle."
"I would consider this a good session brew. Low alcohol content and a light bodied feel makes for easy drinkin'. I will plan on heading to Toledo sometime soon to pick up some more of Three Floyds brews."
"As it warms the nose begins to take on a beautiful Belgian tone. Many thanks to Brewfan for this bomber!"
"Pours a very cloudy golden, medium white head forms, lots of sticky lace. Smell is pine and citrus hops, some floral, wheat and caramel. Taste is caramel, some pine and citrus, grassy malt and a clean bitter finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, medium carbonation, very tasty and unique take on an American wheat, 3F style."
"into my weizen glass it pours a beautiful golden honey color with a nice two in pure foam head that leaves nice lacing down the sides of the glass. A beautiful looking beer. Smells of honey and wheat and mild fruit. A very nice taste as well. You can definatley tastet the honey and wheat. Mouthfeel is superb very light and crisp. I'm sorry i waited this long to crack this one open. I have to say one of my favorites"
"This beer pours a cloudy golden color, with a thin almost tan lace. The smell is of wheat, lemon, honey, some grass essence. The taste is very smooth, kind of sweet from the honey and a little tart from the lemons. It really goes well together. This is a great wheat ale one that I could drink all year around."
"Drinkability: I really could drink this brew all day, Summer, Winter, Autumn, Spring.. Interesting (very hoppy) interpetation of this style."
"Poured a pale golden colour with a big white head that eventually settled down to a thin white layer of small bubbles. The aroma is all citrus and floral hops with a slight graininess. The hops is equally strong in the flavour with a hint of the wheat. A bit of a green, grassy finish that mellowed slightly as the beer warmed. You definitely need to be a big fan of Amarillo hops to enjoy this beer and fortunately, I am! A delicious and highly drinkable beer, particularly for the summer months."
"Drinkability: I paid about $6 for the bomber, and this is going down quickly because it's damn tasty and easy to drink. But overall a pretty incredible beer, and surely worth a try. Pretty complex and simultaneously easy and pleasurable to drink."
"I have heard a lot of good things about this beer, so I was excited to try it. It is fantastic! Aroma is tons of Amarillo hops (which I can't get enough of) with just a little bit of sweetness. Taste is fanatastic as well, lots of flavor from the Amarillo. Good amount of bitterness, but malt characteristics still come through. Mouthfeel is great, and this is really the only place that I can tell it is a wheat beer. Very smooth feel. This beer has held up to the hype. It sure isn't what I'd normally expect from a wheat beer, but other than that, it's hard to criticize this beer."
"Drinkability: I have to give this a 3.5 based solely on price. This is a very good, very refreshing beer. But I bought this at Beverage Warehouse in Cleveland Heights, OH for $6.99. That's just too damn much for a bomber of a light summer wheat ale. Next time I'm in Tacoma, I'm going to stop in at Harmon (because I just HATE doing that) and pick up a bomber of their wheat and see how it stands up to the Gumballhead. I'm going to make the wild-ass guess that it will hold up very, very nicely, at $3 less per bomber.."
"Picked this one up in New Jersey of all places on my swing through the northern states last month. Pours a hazy golden color without a whole lot of visible carbonation. A whispy white creamy head recedes to just a bit of lace after a few minutes. Aroma is hops, hops, and more amarillo hops, with a subtle sweetness mixed in (almost honey, but not quite). The palate is an enjoyable blend of an unfiltered wheat character with some assertive, sharp hop flavor. Bitterness comes through mid-palate, but smooths out on the finish. A bit of an astringent character strikes somewhere along the line, too, providing a bracing effect. Body is nice, crispy and not too light, with decent carbonation. Very drinkable, even during a cool fall evening. Wish I could score some more of this stuff here in NC."
" It's good, but it has an extemely long lasting flavor, almost to the point of being cloying. It is like an odd combination of a summer brew and a winter warmer. Personaly, I would go for something either more refreshing or more potent."
"Finishes very dry. Very good."
"To me, wheat beers are supposed to be smooth and easy drinking. This is hoppy with bite. A like that it is very unique in taste, but I think per style its off, so thus down on the drinkability."
"I could drink this a lot. I wish I had been able to find more than 1 bomber. What a treat!"
"D - Nice summer session beer, but a bit too bitter for my taste."
"overall: this is what i'm talkin' about! a nice change of pace from traditional hefes, without the bananas and cloves. very drinkable, smooth, aromatic and flavorful. what more can you ask for? nice session brew. i'll take this any time."
"The beer pours a nice gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a wonderful hop scent that really refreshes along with a good malt aroma. It has wheat, pale, and some light crystal malts; very complex aroma. The taste is great. It has a smooth pale and wheat malt flavor with loads of hops all the way through. This is probably the most hops I've ever had in a wheat beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is best American wheat beer I've ever had. I love a hoppy wheat ale."
"Side: awfully high priced ($5.20 for 22oz)  Id rather spent $6 on a sixer of Sammy/Schalfly wheat ales."
"Not bad, but nothing I'll be seeking out again any time soon."
"Hazy golden body is topped by a light white head displaying slight lace. Strong Amarillo hops nose. A gentle biscuity feel coats the nostrils. The wheat is obvious and provides a refreshing character, but theres not much else to me. Im not sure how well the hops mix with the rest, it is very citrusy, mandarine/lemon profile and tart, definitely not my favourite balance, but thats probably just my preference for less abrasive citrusy hops. It doesnt feel too fresh as it is. At the same time, the palate is globally thin, though it has a slight creamy tinge. Moderately high thin-bubbled carbonation cleans the tongue nicely though. Nevertheless, Id get bored of having this as my main summer quencher. Give me a burgerbrau helles anywhen over 3 of these."
"Nice golden color with a thin white head. The only real knock i would have on this beer is that the appearance dosn't blow you away. Not much carbonation and just dosn't look lively. Having said that, the smell more than makes up for the lack of appearance. Awesome floral smell to go along with a piney hops. Taste is just as awesome. Great wheat malt flavor that is matched with an amazing amount of hops. Mouthfeal is smooth and light, no bitter bite which is surprising for the level of hops. Drinkability of this it great. I would highly recomend this. I wish I could get it easily in PA. Good thing my brother lives in Indiana."
"Drinkability: Smooth, clean, hoppy and low ABV; you could really lose track of how many you've had of these, you'll enjoy it that much."
"22 ounce bomber. This beer pours out a slightly hazy golden color with an inch of white head. The aroma is an unusual mix of juicy fruit and hops. The flavor is a wheat body, with more hops than I've ever had in a wheat beer. Hops are juicy and piney. Resultant burps taste like bubblegum. Drinkability is fantastic. One of the most unique wheat beers I've had, and also very good."
"Gumballhead is a beautifully clear golden color, with an ample white head. Really nice-looking. It smells sweet when you open the bottle--""cotton candy""--but the hops quickly assert themselves in both scent and taste. I was surprised at how hoppy it was; Gumballhead is certainly the hoppiest wheat ale I've had. Despite this, it does have a tasty toasted malt finish. Pretty good, but intensely hoppy."
"Drinkability: This beer would make an excellent session beer, if it wasn't so expensive. This is one beer that everyone should try for themselves. You will not be disappointed. Keep up the good work Three Floyds!"
"Excellent beer here."
"Pours a beautiful golden color with a nice fluffy white head after I swirl that last few ounces out of the bottle. The flowery smell is what draws me in at first. Citrus, sunflowers and spring...nothing better. The taste is really unlike anything else I have ever had. I guess sweet comes to mind, but not overwhelming. Hoppy, which makes this wheat really unique in my mind. My only knock on this is that I wish it had a little more depth to it. I find myself wishing it was a little more creamy I guess. Why oh why can't they make this in a six pack. One bomber rarely makes it a day or two in my fridge. Truly enjoyable and my favorite summer brew."
"Pours a finger and a half nearly white head (yellow hints) over a cloudy dark straw colored liquid. Smells citrus and pine. Grapefruity pith is gentle in a bath of orange oil and faint hints of fresh pine needles. No sign of rough grassy that many hoppy beer have, it's smooth, perhaps even a bit sugary. Tastes mostly hoppy but with enough underlying sweet to carry them well. Hops start with a tang and pine followed by a grapefruit kick and refreshing orange. Hop bitter is clean and in line with the intensity of the hop flavors and the sweetness. Although beneath the hops, the sweetness is a rich sugary treat, like some crazy kids candy. Some lighter fruity esters (apricot and peach). Md body and highly carbonated."
"This thing is 4.8%?? Holy Shit, bring it on by the caseload please."
"Poured a golden color with a small white head and some lacing. Sticky sweet hop, some lemon, and wheat aroma. Citrus and bitter hops, balanced nicely by a sweetness and the wheat. This is one of my favorite wheat beers, I'd love to have this on draft in my basement!"
"Outstanding amarillo aroma. Straw yellow served with no head. It was hard to get a good look at it becasue 3F serves their beer in a plastic cup. I love the flavor of amarillo hops. Very bitter for the style. I thought it was kind of harsh to drink. Overall, I wouldnt expect any less that this from these guys."
"Simply a delight, and now one of my two favorite wheat beers (with Ramstein Winter Wheat - which it has absolutely nothing in common)."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and full. Rolls over the palate smoothly...being light enough to still be refreshing. This is probably my all time favorite summer brew as I could drink it by the case no problem. I wouldn't mind seeing this in six packs...as it would be a bit more convenient. All in all...this is a great wheat beer."
"hazy light orange with a white head. very piney floral mildly citrusy hop aroma dominates. hints of grainy wheat peak through on occasion. on closer inspection the hops have an almost asprin like smell as jason said in his review. it really is a good description of how it smells, in a good way of course. the taste is very similar to the aroma, though not nearly as bitter as the smell would let on, very mild in fact. hints of wheat and caramel show themselves particularly as it warms, but are clearly backseat to the hops. a faint woody character develops as the temp rises. the mouthfeel is where this really shines. it has a light airy quality with delicate carbonation that is very light without being watery in the least. dry and very sweet at the back of the mouth at the same time. it makes you want to drink it faster just to feel it in your mouth. as a result it has excellent drinkability. i could drink this all night long. this is a really superb summer beer, but i would drink it any time of year. really a very unique experience, especially the mouthfeel."
"drinkability: if it werent for the price you could drink this all night long"
"As on the nose, there is a huge hop presence in the flavor of this wheat. Many of the wheat characteristics are covered by the hops. The first flavors are of fresh green hops and a slight tropical fruitiness. The finish is a lingering bitterness. This is the most hoppy/bitter American Pale Wheat I've ever had."
"Forget hoegaarden and the other so-called thirst quenchers. American micros are king. Gumballhead is the best American Wheat I've ever had."
"This is a very nice beer, one that I would never turn down. But it would not be my first choice if a wheat beer was what my palate craved."
"Emerged from the 22 ounce as a medium amber liquid with a thick foamy head. Smell is a nice mixture of bready malt, citrus, and hops Taste is just plain enjoyable, as the malts, citrus, and hops combine to make an excellent brew. Finish is dry, yet fruity. An excellent drinking beer."
"overall- very different from any other wheat beer ive tried. besides the stronger hop presence there just something about the flavor that makes it very unique. $6.00 for a bomer is a bit steep, but its definitely worth it."
"If the comic book is as good as the beer, I just might have to take up reading."
"Like the bottle says, ""It's not normal."" Certainly not a normal wheat beer. You know what, though, who cares. This is just great beer. I am becoming a huge fan of 3F. I can't wait to try all their others."
"Overall- a delicious beer that went well with the veggie portobello burger."
"-UF"
"Drinkability: Could EASILY knock back a sixer of this. Would make a great session brew. I'll have to remember this one."
"You should try it."
"This is a damn tasty brew overall and a great summer session brew. It far and away has the most flavour of any summer brew I've ever sampled, yet remains pretty simple and thirst quenching at the same time. Yum."
"The beer came with a beautiful white head that stuck around through the beer and left lacing on the side of glass. The beer was a just slightly hazy golden yellow. It smelled of citrous and and aromatically hoppy, and the beer tasted with the sort of flavor expected of its aroma. Its taste is just so well balanced, much less bitter than what I had expected because of the IBUs listed at the bar. The beer tasted of the citrous and hops with just enough malt. My girlfriend, like a few other reviews I have seen, really enjoyed this one as well, which doesn't mean it's a light or sweet beer but instead something very well made and balanced. This is a perfect beer for the hott summer months. I'll definitely be picking these up in the store when I get the chance."
"What a great summer beer, hell, anytime of the year beer. I gave some buddies dough before they went on a trip to 3F's, and I was surprised with Gumballhead. I'm not generally a fan of wheat beers, (I tend to find them cloying); I would drink this any time."
"This poured with very little head at all and was a clear, golden yellow in the glass. The nose was very fruity, sweet like a stick of JuicyFruit gum or a gumball (!). The sweetness carried through on the palate, although it had a light mouthfeel. The finish was citrusy, like lime or lemon, giving way to a faint taste of dill. I found it to be just a bit too sweet for my liking, even sweet for the style."
"A beauty in a big Weizen Glass, hazy orange yellow with a 1/2 inch head that stubbornly sticks to the glass. Nothing but champagne bubbles firing up from the depths of the glass. Smell is sweet wheat with a mild freshwater odor over the top. Taste is surprisingly sugary, with a hop bite ever present. Oily hoppy finish, then a longer finish of sugary hops. Strange, yet tasty. Mouthfeel is medium with a cohesive body. The flavors are separate and blend like rainbow colors do...distinct, but you can't see where one begins and the other ends. A nice quaff, but more than a couple might cause a bit of sensory overload for the palate."
"How do you classify this great wheat beer. It really does not fit into any regular parameters that you judge a wheat by, but boy, was it fantastic. This poured with a thin white head that clung to the glass, with a pale yellow hue and some cloudiness. The Amarillo Hops jump out at you. The aroma is pure wheat. The first sip is all wheat, but then some subtle grapefruit is tasted. This was an awesome beer, right on par with the other fine beers out of Three Floyds."
"D- I could see having a pint or two if I needed a quick hop fix."
"(Edited: 6/8/06)"
"Active carbonation persists, partnering with the crisp flavor for a tingling, refreshing mouthfeel. Highly drinkable, particularly for hot days and nights. Quintessential summer brew, in my opinion."
"With the name, I thought this beer had captured the bubblegum flavor of a true hefe and that's what they were pushing. Boy, was I wrong but still a great beer. It's almost as if they thought to themselves, ""Hey, it's hard for us American brewers to make a true German style wheat so let's not try. Let's do something original."" And it is a true original."
"Decanted from a bomber, this ale showcases a light blonde to gold color with some cloudiness. Bubbly white head on top that leaves some nice sticky patches of lacing. Hops are apparent in the nose with lots of citrous bubbling up. Also a hint of fruit, as well as a dose wheat, pale malt, and yeast. Crisp flavor showcases the ""boat loads"" of amarillo hops. Hops are immediately prickly on the tongue, and are complimented surprisingly well by the big wheat flavor. Lemons and orange peel jump out, assisted by some tangerine and maybe even a bit of apple. Yeast is not unnoticed in the flavor, although it is subtle. Toasty malt is also there, setting some solid ground for the hops and wheat to tread upon. Carbonation is about perfect, mouthfeel is full and unwavering. Really quite the wheat beer, especially in the summertime. Would be a seriously kick ass offering for a BBQ."
"Suprizingly enough, even my wife likes this beer; and she really doesn't like hoppy beers. That is not to say, this is a 'girly beer' but rather that it has good balance and smoothness for all the hops it contains."
"Finger licking good."
"Glad to be trying one more beer from Three Floyds...so many great offerings."
"What an amazing wheat beer. This is exactly what one should expect from an American Wheat, smooth and quenching, with a bitter smack...incredible...perfect!"
"i've heard this described as the 'girly' 3 floyds beer.. let em call me girly, i dig it."
"Bright golden color topped by a thick cream colored head. The aroma has a wonderful hop flower aroma up front followed by a light fig/date sweetness. Think Mojo. The citrus/grapefruit and hop flower taste hits the second the beer touches your mouth. Sharp, pleasant bitterness spreads through your mouth. Its followed by a delicate sweetness, candy and fig that finishes nicely. The mouth feel has is slightly slick, but still has some fullness. Great drinakbility. This is what an American Wheat ale should be. A new favorite."
"Drinkability is great on this IPA like wheat beer, I love it."
"Drinkable? A great summer beer."
"nice beer but to me it was more of a pale ale then a wheat."
"Overall surprisingly fantastic American wheat. VERY unconventional and masterful. I am amazed how lovely the softness and sweetness of the wheat dances with the Amarillo hops - genius. I think Jason (or maybe it was Todd) said it best...'Madness that I like'."
" This wheat offer no clove or banna as usually expected in a wheat - correct for an American Pale wheat Ale. A little alcoholic aroma emerged about half glass as it warmed. very nice round mouth feel and those hops! The after taste offer a brief bitter send off in a very clean finish. With the taste suggesting a well hopped IPA, I am amazed that the malts balance the hop level so well. When you let this cat out of the growler your going to fight over the last highly drinkable drop."
"If you are looking for a great tasting ""lawnmower beer", or enjoy Amarillo hops, this is your baby. I paid $11 for this bomber, which seems a little steep, but I will definitely be getting this again. A well made beer."
"Drinkability is off the charts. You simply must find this stuff for yourself. Summer officially starts the 21st of this month (June), so stock up for the lawnmower season. You'll be glad you did."
"Talk about getting run over with amarillo hops. For this style, very hoppy and very nice. Pours very pale gold in color. Clear too. Thin head that receded fairly quickly but lots of stringy lace. Aroma is all hops. Reminds me of the smell of the boiling hops in my kettle when I homebrew. Taste is more of the same, cut grass hops. But with a nice and sweet malt backbone to the beer to provide some balance. Some pine. Some light citrus. Can't find any of the wheat, but I almost prefer not to find any. Fairly well carbonated. Very crisp with a light body--not thin but light on the tongue. At first was not prepared for the hops but it quickly grew on me."
"Drinkability is great very drinkable beer hell of a hoppy APA with some wheat hints. Would buy this again loved it actually, score is based on it being listed as a wheat ale and me being generous. Listed as a APA it would be a 4.5 Anyway thanks to gimmehead for this nice miss styled beer."
"Bottom line, Couldnt find much of the wheat flavor. It is a monster on the hops. If you like hops and see this beerget it."
"I usuaully shy away from wheat beers (I just personally dont like them too much) but damn me in the pants if I am not buying this stuff this summer. Light enough to pass off on novices to lure them to the dark side but yet definitely interesting enough to keep the beer snob sated. this is one damn fine brew."
"Note: On tap is even better with a smoother mouthfeel and much fresher grapefruity hop character."
"Perfectly clear gold, with a white head that doesn't quite last long enough. The smell is wonderful. Lots of sweet malt and fruity wheat smell along with the characteristic amarillo hops smell which comes off as sweet citrusy fruit. Very pungent indeed. Taste is at first a very nice light sweetness from the malt. Then the hops take over and give this more citrus flavor than any wheat beer I've ever had, except when a server decided to cram an orange slice into my Blue Moon for some reason. A light bitterness is in the finish. Wow, this is refreshing. It could use a little bit more carbonation though, maybe I let this bottle sit for a bit too long in the fridge. I remember it being better on tap at the brewery."
"Mouthfeel is wickedly creamy, but I don't know if my lips could take more than two of these."
"Prosit!"
"The idea is interesting and I realize I am in the minority here so try it and form your own opinion."
"Comes in an eye-catching bomber with no date noted anywhere. Careful not to disturb the sediment, the beer pours golden, clear, and with a thick rocky head and tons of carbonation bubbles. Smell is wonderously hoppy---floral and piney primarily, but a little citrus as well. Taste is more of the same hops upfront, with a nice wheaty backbone and a somewhat tart citric taste in the middle giving way to a quickly fading bitter aftertaste. Medium body with a creamy mouthfeel makes for very easy drinking. This is unlike any wheat beer I've ever had, in a stupendously good way. This is the absolute best summer brew for hopheads that I've yet come across."
"Slightly tart, lemony, rustic, & very hoppy. I found the hops a bit overpowering in this particular beer. Light bodied, moderate carbonation."
"Pour full. Dont fear the yeast. What a refreshing brew. Gumballhead has summer written all over it. Props to FFF."
"Pours a hazy peach with a thinner head than expected that was gone pretty quickly,oh man the aromas!Loads of Amarrilo hops give it a big piney aroma intermingled with some citrus and clove like wheatiness,man what a combination.The different refreshing flavors of this beer are just awesome, definent hop profile of grapefruit and pine along with a wheat beer -lemon and spice make this a one of a kind.Damn now I see why this beer is so highly regarded and Amarillo hops are a big favorite of mine."
"Pours a very pale golden color. Lots of tiny carbonation bubbles make up the frothy white head that leaves a nice lacing on the side of my pint glass. Smells fruity. Lemons, pineapple, passion fruit, pine needles, oranges, limes, all rolled into one sweet scent. Holy amarillo batman, if you've ever hombrewed with amarillo you know what I mean. Taste is very light. There is definitely the signiture three floyds sweet malt backbone, but it is subdued due to the wheat. The hops really take the forefront here. Quite the amarillo taste. Basically tastes of all the fruits I mentioned above, plus other un-nameable tropic fruits. Moutfeel is so light and fluffy, making this a perfect summer beer. Very quaffable without taking the price into account. Unique as hell, also tasty as hell"
"This 3F's offering pours a slightly hazy gold color with a nice sturdy medium off white head. Decent lacing. Aroma is very floral, like walking into a garden. There's also a dry grain note in there. I like it a lot. Taste is fruitier and wheatier then the aroma would suggest. Not sweet and not bitter either. Starts out with that wheat characteristic becomes more yeasty and fruitier as it goes along then finishes with an herbal dryness. Quite nice. Body is medium, thicker than most wheats, but still refreshing. Another great 3F's beer but not quite as good as the Brian Boru I had last week."
"Drinkability: The drinkability factor is strong in this one. Compelling even. Let's all have some crazy cigarette smoking cat beer."
"A clean pale yellow beer . Has a big foamy white head some lace. The aroma is spicey kinda like clove mixed with hops. The flavor has more of that clove hops interplay with a hint of yeast in the background. This is one the best tasting American wheat beers I've had!"
"D- This is a great beer for a summer session beer. It has the great hops coming through and a nice softness from the wheat that gives it a base to stand on. When I see this on the shelves I know summer is close."
"This one is just real tasty and interesting and I could drink it all night. Yet another generous donation from BuckeyeNation. Thanks."
"Hmm. Where do I start? First off I must admit that I was a fan of Skin Graft records long before Gumballhead was even bottled. Rob Syers (Gumballhead the Cat) and Mark Fisher (Hot Satan) have always been some of my favorite comic book superheroes. That said, the beer itself lives up to it's name. The beer pours a clear gold color with a fluffy white head from the malted wheat. The lacing clings to the glass. The smell is quite citric with a lemony zest to it and also reminds me a little of tangerine. The taste is more balanced. Definitely has those signature Three Floyd malts which remind me of cotton candy. Mouthfeel is just right for a wheat ale. Very drinkable, though for the price I wish it had a little more a.b.v."
"Notable for its impressive lace and sustained head retention. Special thanks to cmaruschak."
"The beer fills the glass with hazy golden goodness topped with a pillowy 2 inch white head. Nice yeasty, wheaty aroma, with banana, papaya, and a floral hop nose. Fresh and sprightly in the mouth without sacrificing body. Wheat and tropical fruits mostly with a subtle hoppiness and a dash of lemon on the finish. Creamy and finely carbonated, excessively drinkable."
"I must admit, I don't normally like American Wheat Beers, but this is outstanding! A fine example. I would try it again if I had access."
"this puppy is well crafted. oh yeah, drinkability is really good. certainly a unique brew."
"Pours a cloudy straw yellow with no head and little lace. Smells of citrus and pine trees. Taste is very lemony with a hint of honey and apricots. Doesn't have any of the clove and banana taste that most wheat beers seem to have. I'd say it resembles more an american pale ale in that the aroma and bittering hops hit you in the face but the subtleties of the wheat do come through. Extremely drinkable and a definitely a great summer brew. No wonder this beer is so sought after."
"Poured a slightly hazy medium gold with very little head and almost non existant lace. Smells of aromatic hops and some slight citrus wheat malt. Taste is unique for an American wheat, that is to say it is more heavily hopped than the typical but it is wonderful. A very crisp, clean hop presence that finishes with some nice lemony overtones. It does not leave an overwhelming hop aftertaste (I am not a hop head). Very nicely balanced and huge drinkability. I will, with out a doubt pick up some more for the summertime. An excellent brew."
"Well now. I am witnessing perfection. It is in a glass right in front of me. Not perfect in respect to beer guidelines, or style specifications. Its just friggin perfect! Believe me, I know of FFFs propensity to over-hop anything that travels through their tanks, but this is working for me big time - The floral and piney hoppiness that comes out of this beer is so soft and matches so well with the rest of the beer. There's also touches of apricot and clover honey. This beer is very light in color  pale and golden, with a slight haziness making an appearance after the 2nd pour, due to the rousing of the yeast. The initial pour and tasting was from a perfectly lucid beer. The wheat malt lays a perfectly sweet foundation for those floral gummy hops. Not too sweet or too hoppy by any means. Any bitterness is beaten down with a sweet wheat malt stick. The finish is clean and has just the right amount of sour tang. It seems like most hefs have an abundance of sourness. Its not a bad thing, but the tempered sourness in this beer, along with the hops, made drinking this beer an extremely enjoyable experience. Perfection"
"Medium body though the hops and carbonation tingle the tongue and it goes down creamy and smooth. Some lingering sweetness and/or hop bitterness, depending on the swig. Tasty and worth another."
"Drinkability and Overall: This is an obvious summer beer, but I just happened to acquire one in a trade (thank you PatYoda!!). While this may not have been the freshest sample in the world, it was still excellent. The best part was the smell, but I'd have to say the initial hop bite is the only thing that turned me off."
"Notes: Not a big fan of wheat beers but I don't think this one quite fits the bill. It seems more like a straight up APA to me. That being said, it's a fabulous beer that I would recommend to anyone. Good stuff."
"Thanks for the bottle, Rob!"
"I cracked a 22oz of this while brewing a batch of belgian trappist ale. This beer is so freakin cool it is scary. The whole time you are drinking it, you think that it is an APA but then you switch back to thinking it is a wheat beer. The hops definatelymix well with the wheat and produces a wonderful sweet finish. The appearance is golden and there is tiny particles of pulp free-floating in the glass. I had some spicy chinese while drinking this and it was a perfect compliment. This beer is by far, one of the best session beers that I have had. And by the way, the label is so bad-ass!"
"Drinkability- If I had easy access to this beer I would have a case on hand at all times. A true taste experience. So much flavor in this beer. Thank you so much Meathookjones for this sample. Truly an all time great one."
"A top 10% beer for me. An easy drink with lower than average alcohol. Just a great taste and wonderful grapefuit aroma. The wheat, some nice complementary spice and beautifully hopped. Too big a bottle to finish on my own, but I can drink this anywhere anytime. Medium mouthfeel."
"This beer poured a hazy, peach-amber color with white foam that settled. The smell was fruity and aromatic with some spice and peppery hops. The taste was spicy and hoppy and peppery and fruity (melon?) with hints of wheat and a hoppy finish. A taste like no other American Wheat beer that I have tried. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium body and moderate carbonation. The hops lingered in the finish. This was a very nice wheat ale!"
"This beer has a sturdy astringent backbone sinewed with sweet and hearty muscle that has been arrived at honestly. No high-altitude/HGH treatments here. I drank a 22oz. bomber and really look forward to the next. This is not a wheat beer. Yeah, it was made with wheat, but if you put a lemon in it, I wouldn't be surprised if it gave you a black eye."
"(22 oz. bottle)"
"This one was aged only a few months. It poured an amber color with a fluffy white head that dies off after a few minutes. The aroma was very hoppy - some kind of a grapefruit character in the hops. The flavor is quite a bit hoppy as well, with a pine feel. There is a bit of malt character, but this doesn't really fit the category that it's in. Not a bad beer, but it's not what I expected."
"On draught at Barley's Smokehouse: As with the bottled, this beer definitely does not fall within the normal the definition of the style, but it is still one of the best Wheat beers I have ever had. The draught version is a golden yellow color with nice effervescence (tiny bubbles). The head is medium thin milky white and did not last long. Nice aroma of floral hops, wheat and a touch of citrus. Light-bodied and very easy to drink, with less hops in the flavor than in the nose but still a great amount. There is also a nice wheat presence along with some lemon and grass. Overall, the wheat overlaid with the hops texture makes this pretty close to the perfect summer beer for me. I will enjoy this beer as long as it is around."
"Well, fellow BA Goz was kind enough to share a bottle of this with us yesterday at our BA fest meeting, and I finally got to try some. This is the least wheat beer like wheat beer I have ever tried, but the aroma seemed pretty consistent with what can be expected from Three Floyds. And I Iike that abv! Anyway clear golden when poured, no head (I didn't see any in anyone else's glass either). Heady hop aroma, full of spun sugar and cinnamon. Taste wise, it starts out as a typical hoppy 3F's (I am thinking about dreadnaught)...the one thing that reveals it's wheat moniker in my opinion is that it finishes light, as opposed to bitter or syurpy. Very enjoyable, especially if you appreciate candied hops."
"If you are lucky enough to see this beer on the shelf, please try one. If you want more, hurry back because I understand the supply is limited."
"Gumballhead is far and away the best American wheat beer I've tried. It had just the right balance. I've got one left and I doubt it will survive the first quarter of tonight's MNF game. Big thanks to qarre for the hook-up!"
"22oz bomber. A dreary golden color with a fantastic white head atop that refuses to die. The aroma is powerful, complex, and simply put, great. Just a touch of wheat in the nose, yielding more of a piney hop aroma and fresh citrus fruits. This is a wheat beer right? Upon sipping it, I am reminded of this fact. The aroma is deceiving from the flavor, and I must say I did expect a bit more complexity in the taste. Wheat malts and a pleasant, lingering sweetness are the story here. Mouthfeel is slightly dry, crisp, and extremely refreshing. One of the best session beers ever I am guessing, and one of the most unique beers of its kind. Very impressive."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Pours out to a bright and satin colored dark gold in the glass with a moderate head. The aroma is wonderful and gives of hints of pine, wheat and citrus. The taste is very good to near exceptional. It starts off like a Pale Ale, with hints of pine, spruce, citrus and hops and weaves its way into honey, wheat and spice. I've never experienced a wheat or summer beer with such a range of tastes. Excellent."
"Clear, golden honeyed. The head came and went quick... after only a minute there was just a bit of creamy white froth in a ring at the edges and a slight dusting left in the center. Sharp hoppy and sweetness float from the glass... Juicyfruit gum and grapefruit as an aroma... hmmmm.... Such an interesting taste... Honey taste and honey feeling. Sweet and wheaty, yet hoppy. Lemon hard candy in the background, -not the good LemonHead ones, the crappy ones you find in the doctor office candydishes (my Dad is a Psychologist, I know them oh-too-well) Fills your mouth with a medium bodied, almost smooth but not really creamy texture. I'm not seeing the carbination but I can feel it a bit on my tongue. I'm really liking this one, great session. Such good flavors, and like I said, interesting. The body makes it an easy drinker. Nothing is too overpowering to make it annoying, just nice and yummy."
"Big froathy white head leaves a scattered islands of lace as it slowly to a thin coating. Transparent straw colored beer with dozens of tiny carbonation streams rising from the bottom. Beer is at cellar temp and there is a mellow bubblegum flavor to the beer, not much else, a light malt base. Nice soft mouthfeel carries the flavor to the tongue. Resinous hop aroma. A nice tasting, simple beer that's easy drinking. I"
"Mellow taste and addictive aftertaste, combined with the awesome body, make this brew exceptionally drinkable."
"An interesting, unorthodox approach to the style but I don't find this to be all that different from loads of others. It is hoppier, no doubt, but whatever the hops bring they take away equally. Notes of lemon and other citrus fruits."
"Very very very drinkable."
"Might as well stick to 3Floyds brews, right? I am lucky enough to have an ample supply of Gumballhead available to me at the Village Bottle Shop in Lafayette (no, I won't complain about the price here). This is a truly great brew which brings me pride when thinking of it's Indiana origins. It pours a golden/orange color with a magnificent white head which has good retention. Aroma is nice and hoppy, very citric for a wheat beer. Finally some grassy notes seep through. Taste is extremely well balanced. A little bit of hoppiness backed up by some nice sweet malt flavors. Mouthfeel is nice and thick. If only I had the money to make this my session beer (ok, i did complain). This is a marvel of brewing and I have yet to have anything similiar. One of my favorite 3Floyds beers. Try it if you can."
"Pours golden amber with a white head. Thick aroma of piney hops bubble gum, lemony citrus and tropical fruit (papaya and pineapple). The mouthfeel is medium bodied and soft. Straight-forward wheat malt upfront. Some caramel flavors emerge also. Bitterness from the amarillo hops pops about about midway and introduces the lone piney finish. Excellent! The hoppiness for a wheat beer is unique and fits the 3F's profile to a tee."
"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a August Schell weiss glass. Copper rust in color, with a moderate sized foamy head. Smells mainly of hops, with some bubblegum sweetness. Taste is hop dominant, with a sweet carmel flavor that is very reminiscent of bubblegum. Aftertaste is very dry, but very appealing. Defintely a tribute to it's style."
"Big whiff of slightly lemony Amarillo hops open opening. Light copper in color with a slightly uneven, big white head. Juicy orange hop flavor dominates without contributing much bitterness. Slightly piney in the finish with a bit of wheaty tang. A mild sweetness waxes as the beer warms, and lingers a bit in the aftertaste. Quite ""big"" in terms of flavor but fairly light in the mouth. A terrifically drinkable summertime ale."
"Poured a clear amber with a whte frothy head. The head dissipated relatively shortly, which was disappointing. The aroma is luxuriously hoppy with hints of citrus orange rind. The taste starts off as smooth as a typical American wheat, then goes all Emeril and kicks it up a notch with a stellar, yet still muted and balanced, hop finish. The malts are soft and easy on the palate, and then the hops roll in to town like a biker gang trying an image reconstruction plan. This is a great summer offering from Three Floyd's, and if it were distributed down here I would buy it case after case after tasty case."
"22oz bomber: hazy golden delicious apple color topped with a bright white creamy layer of foam. head dissipates rather rapidly to nothing. sugary sweet citric hop aroma and not much else. light to medium bodied with a nice crisp level of carbonation. soft bubblegum and sugar-coated hop cone flavor. like dreadnaught in the juicy hop flavor department, minus all the bitterness. seems wheat beer like in texture only, finsishes rather crisp and amazingly somewhat dry. certainly unique...i tend to like originals, and i tend to like originals done well even more. this is a fantastic beer that isn't constrained to a specific style. great summertime drinking...i only wish it were cheaper. $8 for 22oz....ouch."
"This beer is awesome, really refreshing as well. A great beer to have with lunch, lush and flavorful, but a few of them wouldnt knock you on your ass. I only wish it were more available around here.."
"A very interesting wheat beer, refreshing on hot days, but packs the hop dose I need."
"Let me preface this review by saying that this is one weird beera pale, wheat ale. Immediately, my taste buds were expecting that typical wheat beer taste but they were totally caught off guard by the heavy duty hops. It poured a deep golden color, slightly hazy, with a fluffy, off-white head that left tight lacing behind. The aroma was nearly all hopsIt smelled entirely of grapefruit, some black pepper, and a slight wheat thing happening in the background. The taste was all hops up front, big grapefruit flavors and plenty spicy. Gently sweet, delicate wheat flavors come through ever so slightly just before a mellow, barely bitter aftertaste sets in. The mouthfeel was medium with medium carbonation. Stuff is highly drinkable. Each swallow leaves you thirsting for another gulp. Good, interesting stuff. Never had a wheat beer like this before."
"Pours with a hazy orange body with a decent head. Can smell the grapefruityness of the hops in the nose. But what a taste - the palate is almost confused - the mellow wheatiness on the front with the grapefruitiness of the hops in the back makes for a VERY good beer. Eminently quaffable, with a lighter mouthfeel one would expect from a wheat beer more so than an ale. Highly recommended (from someone who is not a hophead)."
"I got one bomber in trade from francisweizen, and have another one brought from Chicago by Southernbrew."
"Gumballhead is one of the most drinkable brews I've ever had. It has the look of a wheat beer -- light hazy and fluffy --and the creamy texture of a wheat beer -- but this has hops -- lots of hops. The citrussy yeasty wheat character is there too, but those delicious hops are upfront, and the combination is perfection. If this is Dreadnaught's little brother then ol' Dread deserves its reputation. I even like the weirdo cartoon label. Thumbs up!"
"Pours a nice pale cloudy golden color with amber hues. A billowing head about an inch and a half high rises and recedes with a nice lace on the glass. Initial aromas are wheaty sweet, with some malts and a nice spicy piney hop tone. The flavor of this beer starts off initially sweet with the wheat and other malts giving a nice bready, malty and wheat flavoring. Carbonation to this beer is subtle and crisp with a nice light body to match and an almost creamy texture to it. Following the wheat and malty backbone this beer shows off its nice hop profile with some citrusy zing, a bit of floral notes, some zesty flavors and a final slight bitterness at the end to keep things in check. A little caramel like flavors sneak there way in towards the end of this brew also. Overall an interesting offering from Three Floyd's, that's just in a style of its own really. Definetly a great brew for the summer with a nice hop kick to any of the hop heads out there that needs a change from an IPA."
"Pours a light amber with a large white puffy head. Lots of carbonation and I had to be careful to pour slowly. Smell is a bit of grain and wheat followed by piney hops. Taste is at first one of a nice refreshing wheat, but the Amarillo hops then sneak in and turn the beer into a little hop monkey. Its almost like two beers in one. At first you think you are getting a wheat ale, but by the end you are thinking you might have gotten your glass switched with a pale ale. Mouthfeel is good with pretty hardy carbonation, but for this beer the effervencene works. Drinkability is nice as well as one could put down a few of these quite easily. Might be a bit overpriced and it would be nice if these came in 6 packs. Over all I nice offering."
"I've been saving this one for my week with my best friend...one of the many great beers waiting for us both. Beer is a nice light golden color. The head starts out strong and thick, about one finger high, and fades a thick coating around the glass with a light cover over the top of the beer. There is a good malt and hop aroma, with the hops being more prevalent. The hops hit me first followed by a sweetness from the malt finishing with a second coming of the hops. Overall, a very nice flavor combination, as the hops don't linger too long, but just enough for my taste. The beer is moderately thick, but not offensively so. There is not a lot of carbonation burning on my tongue, I had expected more with the bubbling present in the glass. I am highly impressed with this beer and would actively seek it out like I had to trying to find it in the first place. This is a perfect session beer in my opinion."
"I've been waiting for almost a year to write a beer review and tonight I came to the conclusion that Gumballhead would be fit for my first. I've recently moved to Chicago from Connecticut where we cannot find Three Floyds. Now that I'm here, I treat myself to a bomber or two of Gumball every week. I have even been considering driving the 900 miles back home so that I could stop at the brewery to pick up a keg to share with my friends. At almost $6.00 a bottle, this brew isn't cheap, but like they say -- you get what you pay for. I think I've found my favorite beer."
"Drinkability: My wallet (thin as it is) will not allow me to drink this as I should. This is an exceptional beer. I'm almost angry because I can't get more of this except by shelling out $8 for a bomber. The sad thing is...it's so good, I know I'll be back."
"Nice light mouthfeel leaving a slight coating but nothing too overpowering. Very enjoyable drink, I will have this again."
"22 ounce bottle. (Thanks to Skidz I now have another bottle for the stash so I can rate this one!)"
"Funky looking label. As is the beer I might add. But damn does this taste good. Poured out a golden/orange color with some carbonation visible and stays with you until the end. Some lacing left on the glass when you're done with it. Smell is mostly hops to my surprise. Some sweet aromas come in as well along with some citrus notes that you can taste quite a bit of. Taste is where it's at. Hops alone with some pine flavors hit the palate first with some wheat in the middle and finally blends in with some grapefruit like flavors in the end and lasts into the aftertaste. These just blend in so well it's amazing. The aftertaste isn't all that powerful with just a wheat aftertaste along with that grapefruit taste. It just makes you want to sip more and more. A damn fine brew."
"The name is fitting, as it is a bit reminiscent of gum. Also hoppy for a wheat beer, which is not uncommon for US versions. Give 'em credit for doing something unique, and definitely worth trying. Overall, it can't hold a candle to the real thing, but a good brew nonetheless. Thanks to the BeirReise for the sample."
"Drinkability: Exceptional! I could drink this beer year round, but this is a wonderful summer ale. I would keep this stocked in my fridge if I didn't have to drive to Virginia to get it. A unique beer unlike anything else I've tried."
"Hops alert! You know the hops are in the glass before you taste it. I tasted flavors of apricots, lemons and yes, gumballs. If you ever wondered what the spawn of a Bavarian Hefeweizen and an IPA would be, this is it."
"Comments  Big thanks to feloniousmonk for sending this one all the way to Seattle. Ive found a new standard."
"Cloudy amber-orange color with a huge creamy head that leaves a thick sticky lacing in my glass. Hoppy aroma of grapefruits and candy, flavors of pine and citrus, never had a wheat beer taste like this before. Medium body with a somewhat sticky mouthfeel, finishes bitter."
"Three Floyds has hit another home run. This is a superb wheat beer; the best, by far, that I've ever had. I can't imagine a more delicious, more easy drinking, more flat-out enjoyable summer seasonal. The bomber is almost gone and it hasn't taken me all that long to write this review. Have the boys at 3F sold their souls to Old Scratch? Gumballhead met my high expectations and then some."
"Drinkability: Not all wheat beers need to be light and ""wimpy."" A nice mix of a Pale Ale/IPA and a wheat ale. Take the light body of a wheat beer and chuck in the small scale sensual assault of hops from an IPA and you have this. Schweeeet."
"Wow...probably the best wheat beer in the world!! I have no idea how a beer like this can be so well hopped and still manage to let the wheat's mellow character shine through, but somehow 3F manages it. I'm glad we have another bottle to enjoy, and if and when 3F makes it to Western PA, this will be one of my personal favorites."
"22oz. bomber poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a slightly hazy medium orange color with two fingers of head. There is a little lacing left on the glass. The smell is fantastic, with a slight bit of wheat malt hiding behind a large dose of fresh citrus hops. It smells like a wheaty IPA. Very strong aromas. The taste is weird in that it starts with sharp hops on the tongue, and ends with a wheaty finish. Still crisp and refreshing. The mouthfeel is very thick and heavy, great for a wheat beer. The drinkability is fantastic too, at only 4.8%. A great summer beer!"
"The appearance is decent. Looks like a hazier version of your average macro lager. There is a decent white head here. Aroma has my attention. It's sweet & full of citrousy hop aroma, almost as if there were citric acid in there, The taste is quite good for a beer that is not too strong. Full of citrousy flavors mixed with the usual hefe tropical tastes make this a wiiner. Initial grainy wheat flavors are spruced up by some fruity hops, ending with a decently bitter & fruity aftertaste. This one actually gets more complex as I go along. The Mouthfeel comes off rather thin, but 'fluffy' at times. Drinkabilty is good, and this a great low ABV session brew. My current flavor of the month. Love the taste, and love the low ABV."
"Hazed dark auric hue. Thin, but well retained cream white head leaves sparse lace. Pine sap and lemon atop grainy, tart wheat with a splash of light lovibond caramel malt. Bubblegum hints. Clean and enticing aromawise. Flavor is a facsimile of the aroma. Pine dominates, although there's a juicy honeydew melon presence that melds well with the stately wheat presence. Bitterness is well above the norm for the typically insipid style, and is within range for an APA. Wheat lends a slight tartness that adds to the impressive thirst quenching nature of this brew. Not deep maltwise, nor is it intended to be. The assertive hopping has elevated what would be a prosaic American wheat to a very respectable level. Thinnish in mouthfeel, but with a light viscosity that feigns richness. Finishes slightly soapy, with trace lemon Pine Sol hints, but otherwise squeaky clean. American wheats have their limitations, and Gumballhead overcomes one typical banality-- lack of any noteable hop presence. Any other alteration would have overly bastardized the style. It retains the effortless drinkability of American wheats, yet adds savourability. Truly unique."
"A big crayon drawn cartoon bubble saying ""Thanks!"" is made by this kid at heart to silenius! You sir deserve one of those Bugs Bunny kisses often given to Elmer Fudd just after his gun blows off his own face. Or is it before his face gets all blackened?"
"Mouthfeel was crisp with a long dry finish. Medium bodied with strong floral and citrus lasting long on the tongue after swallowing. Extremely drinkable and refreshing. This is a great brew."
"As it stands, I have to thank Jahred and his messenger, incongruity for their gallant work!"
"The beer relinquishes all ties with the 22 ounce brown bottle and takes up residence in my special wheat beer glass a limpid amber color, the head is modest in size, creamy in texture and a very light tan color, as it dematerializes the lace formed is a thin veil to hide the glass. Nose is spicy, citrus crisp with a nice underlying floral tone, very fresh and clean to the senses, the start is a light to the taste buds feel of the wheat and malted grain, spun sugar sweet, the top is fair to middling in its feel. Finish is ineffable in its acidity with the hops agreeable in their spicy presence, the aftertaste desert dry and long lasting, another fine beer from a fine brewery."
"Thanks to Mikeys01 for the bottle! I owe you bigtime."
"Nice golden yellow with a frothy head. Lots of hoppy goodness, with the malt almost non-existent. Lovely aroma for a summer brew. Hops dominate, but don't overpower the palate. Wheat malt adds nicely to the finish.. Not too heavy, not too light. Nicely balanced with hops first and what malt last. Well done. Quickly becoming a summer fave of mine. Glad to see this one bottled."
"The cloudy light gold body is topped by a nice frothy head that shrinks back to a nice residual that laces well. The nose is full of fruit, fruit, and more more fruit from the excellent hopping. Normally not much of a wheat fan I found this beer to be excellent in its drinkability, being light and refreshing from the excellent blend of ingredients. A bit pricey, but well worth the money as a novelty experience to be savored on occasion."
"Notes: Good beer. Not one I would suggest to a first time wheat beer drinker, simply because of the way it differs greatly from others in the category. Nice beer for the price."
"I am rating it per style...doesn't measure up as an IPA but as an American Wheat it blows things out of the water.."
"For the style of American Wheat Ales, this is light years ahead of the competition. I would surely buy it often, but the price ($8 a bomber) is a bit much for me right now. Regardless, you will not find a more amenable non-weizen wheat out there."
"This is both an excellent beer and a disappointment. With a name like Gumballhead, I was looking for huge esters, but instead I found a beer that proved to me that American hops dont clash hopelessly with wheat beers after all. The color is a slightly hazy (not very cloudy at all) dark gold topped by a moderately sized white head. The aroma pits slight esters against a moderate fresh Amarillo aroma over fresh-baked bread. The flavor is a good amount of crisp wheatiness livened up with some grapefruit/juniper hops, making a very crisp, very refreshing brew. This is imminently drinkable. I could probably drink a dozen of them and fall over dead. Itd be interesting to see the same grain and hop recipe fermented on real Bavarian hefeweizen yeast instead of the yeast strain they used here."
"22oz bomber bottle with an odd looking comic charecter on the label named gumballhead. Pours a cloudy golden orange color with a rocky white head. Left a fantastic lacing on the glass as it was drank. Aroma is hoppy with citrus grapefruit notes as well as mild malts. Flavor is definatly wheat heavy with a nice hoppy kick to it with a bit of lemon detected. Very smooth and easy drinking especially for a wheatbeer. This has a great mouthfeel. I will definatly be picking some more of this up and doing some research to see what ""Gumballhead"" did to have such a great beer named after him."
"This is now my favorite ""wheat beer"". But I think of it as a sessionable Wheat-IPA. I could easily suck down 3 of these bombers, but my wallet sure wouldn't like me for it."
"Served from a 22oz bobmber graced with some interesting artwork of a punk ass cat or something like that. You can certainly count on 3F for interesting labels. Pours out a bright orange color, with just a hint of haze and wisps of swirling white head. Nose is shockingly hoppy for a wheat beer, smelling like a citrus orchard at picking time. No hint of bananas here. Slight wheatiness is also noticeable in the aroma. Very clean flavor, lightly wheaty and loaded with amarillo hop flavor. Highly bitter towards the finish, and just a bit lemony and sweet. Definitely different, nearly perfectly so. Body is medium but light enough to go down very easily, this is an eminently drinkable summer beer. Quite complex for a wheat beer, 3F does an excelent job with the hops as usual...mmmm, want more...."
"From the bomber pours a hazy golden/orange color with a thin white head. The head disappeared quickly. There was a great amount of lace on the glass. What a smell! Huge notes of pine and citrus. Sort of like a grapefruit crossed with a Christmas tree! On closer inspection, it almost smells like a handful of what else, gumballs.The taste begins very briefly with a good wheat sourness, however that is quickly interrupted by hops, hops and more hops! Again, grapefruit and pine flavored hops with a great, but not overwhelming amount of bitterness. Several times, I swear I could faintly taste crunchberries. This is a wheat beer? Oh yes, 3 Floyds means hops. Light to medium body with good amount of carbonation. Overall, wow! I would certainly have another. I would never have thought that a wheat ale would be this intense, but it is and it works great. This is a fantastic beer."
"It's got a big lotta wheat with a raft of Amarillo to match, and they balance and blend to offer up loads of sassy refreshment. Earthy and fruity and spicy, its playfulness captures the imagination, as the tidier parts pull together to deliver a big sum total, and that in turn yields some truly impressive drinkability. If the name and the label put a grin on your face, then the beer itself will turn that grin in to one full, satisfied smile."
"At $2.75 per bomber (for now, at least), I will load up the fridge for the coming months. Kudos to 3F for another winner!"
"Overall, this is one of the better American style wheat beers out there."
"Appearance: Honey golden hue a huge massive off white cream in color big chunky mountainous texture very resilient leaves heavy streaks of random lacing. Aroma: Amazing absolutely one of the most pleasant and alluring hop profiles I've ever come across from an American wheat ale, who could have guessed that. Deep buttery pinecone scented hops as the label describes ""loads of Amarillo hops"" with a touch of banana ester, man this hop profile is kickin'. Taste: Heavenly, layer upon layer of this orgy of wheat, vanilla, and banana along with such a generous helping of Amarillo hops. Really hoppy flavored yet not that bitter extremely balanced, it's easy to say there's no other beer drinking experience like this out there. Mouthfeel: Creamy silky yet rediculously smooth going down, medium bodied with an even carbonation, a pure hop nectar. Drinkability: A dream come true for people who love both hoppy beers and wheat infused ales. If you don't like American wheats give this a try nothing like any other example of the style. Let me thank CRJMellor for this beauty I've been salivating to try this one."
"Drinkability is enormously high. This one could go down my gullet all night."
"Mouthfeel is nice and smooth with moderate carbonation. The medium body is packed full of hops and will give anyone craving hops their fix."
"Okay, we in Columbus finally got this brew, and as is often the case with Three Floyds, I am somewhat confused, if pleasantly. This beer poured a light, clear golden color and fomred a small off white head the coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, citrus, caramel, some hint of pine and more hops. A flavor of hops, citrus, pine and more hops. The finish was bittersweet and refreshing. As you can see by my review, I was not expecting such hop influence in a supposedly wheat beer. But like so many other American craft brewers, Three Floyds continues to surprise me."
"This is a slightly cloudy golden orange colour with a nice head of white foam that lasts and lasts. The aromas are of gumballs, other german yeast notes (such as bananas, cloves, grapes, etc...), fresh citrus hops, and lovely bready malts. The taste is absolutely awesome as this is a very flavorful blend of strong hopping and delicate yeast play. At 4.8% this beer is one of the most complex wheat beers I have ever had! The mouthfeel is creamy and sharp and the drinkability is stellar! FFF's does it again!"
"Pours a clear straw gold with a tight white head that sits on top of a clear straw colored brew. The amarillo aroma is just wonderful. A citrisy, spicy flavor accompanies a grainy maltiness. The finish is a little dry and crisp with the amarillo featured in the end. A great warm weather drinker."
"It pours a hazy orange-gold with a head that dissipates fast. The head is a dissappointment for a wheat beer, but I'll get over it. The aroma is grainy with some cirtus and pine and a wheat tinge. The crisp body does not have much malt taste, but some sweet breadiness is detectable and there is also a touch of bubblegum. The hops fesh hop flavors are excellent. There is lemon/grapefruit juiciness and some pine. It is refreshing and crisp with a clean finish."
"If this was $6 for a 6pack, as opposed to a single bomber, I'd drink a whole shitload of it during the summer. But as is, it seems like a rather rotten deal, aside from getting to try it."
"This is a great drinking beer, and at 4.8%, what a great session beer it makes."
"Thanks to jackndan/BIF 6 for the bomber!"
"I said god damn, god damn. What have we here? It's a wheat & it is spectacular. Poured this bad boy into a glass & it was cloudy, straw colored, & held a perfect white bubbly head. Holy crap - the aroma is a regular thing of beauty. When 3 Floyd's writes that they add ""a boatload of amarillo hops"" on the bottle's label - they are telling the truth. Every sip is better than the one before it. Hops are everywhere, but the wheat flavor is still there to keep this brew clean & refreshing. The hop profile is wonderful - floral & citrus fruit (lemon, orange, grapefruit). Drinkability is absurd. If possible, I would drink this for breakfast, lunch, & dinner for the months of April through August for the rest of my life. To quote andre 3000, ""I think I'm in love again...""."
"ng"
"Slightly hazed dark golden/ light amber appearance. Thin dirty white head leaves some ample lace. The first thing that hits my nose is that sweet, resiny, canabis-like aroma that I love so much. All about the 'Rillos. But there's also a little spiciness to the nose and a little wheat ""tang."" Now this is my kind of an ""American Wheat."" The pine sap, burnt citric tones of the hops blend with some bubblegum esters and wheat spiciness to create one enjoyable beer. The dichotomy of the lingering sweet bubblegum and bitter 'rillos makes for a nice interplay. Nicely carbonated and about medium-full in body. I'm liking 3 Floyd's more and more by the minute (now that I'm not tasting the contract brewed stuff)."
"A hazy, deep amber-orange body reveals golden highlights at the base of the glass and teems with tiny effervescent bubbles. The off-white head is full and densely creamy; and displays excellent retention and leaves wide swatches of lacing about the glass. The nose is loaded with bright, fresh hops that are citrusy and lightly spicy with hints of pine over a delicately sweet, wheatish malt. The body is medium; and its lightly zesty effervescence leaves a lingering tingle on the front of the tongue as the rest of the beer fades smoothly away with a light creaminess. The hops displayed in the nose are clearly carried over into the flavor, dominating upfront but blending most exquisitely across the middle in a wash of sweetish, wheat-accented malt. The bitterness is held in check as it should be (@20 IBU's perhaps); yet the hop aromas and flavors shine! It finishes with some lingering malt sugar and piney and spicy hops that fade to a dull residual bitterness by the time you're ready for another sip. An extraordinary American wheat that's well worth seeking out."
"Props to cretemixer for delivering this to my door."
"Pours an golden amber with a nice white head and good lacing. Smells overwhelmingly of citrus fruits. Lemons and a sweet swide round out the smells. Taste is nice. Starts with a nice citrusy punch that comes around with a sweeter malty finish. The wheat in here is slightly masked by overwhelming hops flavors. It's a very well rounded drinkable beer and I should have assumed an overhopped Hefe from 3floyds. It's a very interesting brew to say the least. It's medium bodied a pretty good ammount of carbonation, but it just goes down so damn smooth. It's crazy. Great beer by a great brewery."
"Drinkability is insane, one bottle was not enough, it is so good I and low abv and smoothness makes me just want to drink this all afternoon on the back porch. Summer beer of the year this year for sure!"
"Very good and very drinkable."
"I love this stuff! Damned, if Oberon is in the same league. Faaagett about it! This one through me for a loop for sure. I thought it would be more of a Belgium White ale, and what I found was a beer with a very unique and distinct persona! The beer pours a wonderful, deep golden, and has none of the hazey yeast I love in the style. This beer throws style out the window. The head is a clean, creamy, buttery white. Aromas are super fresh and hop focused. An orange malt aroma adds an initial summery feel, and once in the mouth the beer explodes with freshness. Ahhh, what a flavor! Spicy, citrusy, hoppy, grainy, smooth and again ohh so fresh. As the beer finishes one could swear that all the complexities of this beer combine to actually offer the taster the flavor of a gumball...I swear it!! The flavor of the sweet shell, the tang of the fruity gumball, and the bitter of the gum itself. This is a one of a kind drink! Cool stuff"
"Enjoyed this right off the brewery tap. This is quite unlike any other beer out there. American Wheats are a little bland, unless they've been brewed with the spicy flavor of German wheats, but the Floyds never cared for following style. This has a big zesty wheat taste that I somehow guessed was North Dakota winter wheat, and Nick said I was right, but I don't know how I knew. Like with most 3F beers, there's a big smack in the face of hops, this one is all Amarillo, giving a different more orangey taste. Pleasing orange color, too. Gotta get out and find this stuff while it's around!"
"Pours a clear deep gold color, and it is topped by a tan head. A wonderful aroma of candied fruit rises up from my glass, the aroma definitely lives up to its name. I smell notes of apricot, lemon, and grapefruit. The taste is light bodied, and slightly sweet, and thick with pungent hop flavors. A clean crisp beer hides under the domination hop flavors of apricot and lemon. this beer is not overly bitter, like perhaps the hop flavor and aroma my suggest, it has a medium level of bitterness in the finish. I definitely know of no gumball that is quite so exquisite as this elixir. This is a damn good Summer offering, certainly not a traditional wheat beer, but the wheat lightens this beer up and makes it a great summer refresher. This is a straight forward, one-dimensional attack of Amarillo hops, if you like them then this is the beer for you."
"On Tap at BW3's downtown Indy. Poured a clear golden orange with a smallish head, and no lacing. I know this is suppose to be a American Wheat, and as a lover of wheat beer, I usually don't like what American wheat tastes like. But rating this as a stand alone beer, not going by style, this is one tasty beer. From the moment of the pour you get that big hop aroma, followed by the bubble gum, and some wheat beer characteristics.The taste starts out with the sweetness from the malt then the hops kick in. You can pick up a little banana in the finish. Very good. A great session beer. Too bad this is seasonal."
"I found this beer to be fantastic! However, my rating for this one is not comparing the beer to the style, but my opinion of the beer itself as is. It is not your typical Hefe, if at all. I'd call it an Ordinary Bitter-Weizen. The smell was very nice, with good malt and hop aroma, and a touch of the classic weizen yeast esters. Taste was a blast of interesting yet delightful flavors. Starts out malty sweet with a balanced hop flavor and bitterness. Gumball flavors actually came through, which suprise me, and a hint of banana was also there. Finish was smooth with a good overall mouthfeel, nice hoppy finish and lingering sweetness. Could drink this beer all day!"
"This brew pours a small head of fine to medium sized white colored bubbles and a weak wheat yellow colored body. It had a mild malt-hop aroma. Its flavor contained the typical 3 Floyds hop bite that is strong initailly yet softens in the finish. My favorite Indiana brewer!"
"The flavor has just a touch of the wheat sweetness and very little malt to cut through the intense citrus hop burn. Towards the end a strong taste of bubble gum (yes.. I imagine this is part of the name) comes in to rescue the taste buds from a neverending load of hop bitterness."
"This beer was advertised to me as a summer pale, and I really wouldn't have known it was a wheat beer unless I did some additional research. This one pours a straw color with a miniscule head from the tap. Lacing is not present. Smell is that of an American IPA, not a typical wheat beer. This alone tells you this is a Three Floyds product -- I love it! Big notes of fruity hops are present, along with a sweet, gumball aroma. Taste is a great balance between sweet and hoppy, with the hoppiness winning out. Mouthfeel is mildly carbonated and pleasant. This is an incredibly refreshing brew, and one I wish Three Floyds bottled (hopefully they will sometime soon). Going along with the typical Three Floyds mantra of ""We're not normal," they pull through once again with this unique offering. Very nice, whatever it is!"
"Wheat? I am not so sure about that. It is a very crisp brew with nice refreshing qualities. The hops are in full order and every last sip gets a rich blast of hops. Citrus also plays a big role in this one. This is an interesting brew, and you should not miss out on it. Great for sessions IMHO. A wonderful outdoor working beer."
"A light body and medium carbonation make for a very refreshing beer. A great session beer with a good deal of character, something that is often very elusive. Not only can you drink a lot, but you really want to. (at least I do anyway)"
