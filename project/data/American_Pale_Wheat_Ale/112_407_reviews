"Incredibly full mouthfeel. What a wheat! Drinkable and round and solid."

"Very solid wheat beer. Has a subtle sweetness to the aftertaste. Fairly light overall, but heavy enough to compliment the flavor."

"More sweetness and the same. Wheat is the primary flavor, but it's short of bready. That artificial peach candy note is evident, along with hints of tangerine and floral hop bitterness. Remains juicy without ample hoppiness. Even the body seems like a glaze in the mouth. Wet enough to wash down, but this would be better if it was drier. More bubbles would help, also."

"The finish becomes minerally. Strange for the style. Just not much there."

"Overall â€“ A rather crisp, refreshing, and easy drinking wheat beer with a good blend of citrus and wheat. A nice summer style brew."
"Crusty wheat with a nice citrus aspect complimenting that. I applaud brewers who still make beers like this today when hops, barrels and adjuncts are starting to rule the world. Simple on the surface but solid."

"It's a good wheat beer. They aren't aiming to make a unique and original beer and thats what i like about it the most. It is very simple and just easy to enjoy. Not a must have but not bad. Would definitely buy again but i wouldn't go out of my way to look for it."

"O: Simple but gratifying, as a good American wheat ale should be. Many view the style as being rather boring and uninspired, but when you come across a well-crafted brew like this you can appreciate the simple pleasures it has to offer. It makes for a great summer quaff or beach beer. Pick up a sixer of this as a nice change of pace from the ubiquitous Sam Summer. You may find that it scratches that summer wheat beer itch even better."
"Overall, this is exactly how I want my wheat beers. Very refreshing with a clean, citric quality."

"Sampled a 12 oz. tulip glass at Beer Revolution in Calgary. Odd serving choice for an American wheat but they do that with the more pricy US imports. This one is a semi-cloudy bright yellow brew, maybe just a hint of orange, with a light spray of white bubbles riding on top. Aroma is bright and citric, with lemon and orange hops front and center, wheat spice and doughy sweet rolls in the background. Tastes like dilute orange juice or vitamin C chews, lemon rind, gummy worms, perhaps a little noble hop peppered flower water ... Sweet and hoppy for an American wheat and fucking tasty on a certain level (e.g., if you are sitting outside and its blazing hot). Like some a-hole squeezed a citrus wedge into the beer except no one actually did thank God, this is all hops doing the talking. Rather fizzy and has an interesting slick (almost oily) mouthfeel but finishes crisp, dry, and clean as expected. Gotta say, this stands out from the pedestrian mass of dull safe American wheat beers and does so quite handily. If I were to compare it to an aggressively hopped wheat like Lagunitas Little Sumpin, this is like a little brother session alternative, with hop flavor trumping the bitterness."

"A decent American-oriented wheat ale, the fruitiness (i.e. lemon character) going a long way in differentiating this from the dregs of the masses of the style. Hardly mind-blowing, but agreeable enough, especially as a potential harbinger of the days where I can kick back on my new house's deck with a few rounds of this kind of thing."
""
""
" My wife put it wonderfully. This would be a great beer at the end of the night where you don't want to drink any more of your regular beer but don't want to stop drinking. Great third or fourth beer to cleanse the palate. To me this beer definitely screams Northern California."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and the lemony flavors make the taste a little more palatable."
""
"It does not stand up to other North Coast offerings. Quite plain and assertive, but still a very refreshing American Wheat. A Session summer beer."

"O: an exceptionally refreshing barley/wheat ale, with fine citrus overtones."
""
""
""

"Drinkability: A good refreshing beer. Would be great for a outside bar-b-que with friends. And I know you're not supposed to drink iced cold beer, but this one may be good a little extra cold."

"Pours a golden color with a finger of head that disappates to a rim around the glass. Aroma is crisp and clean with a some pilsner hops present. Flavor is dry to start and finishes with the pilsner. Slight presence of citrus - maybe some grapefruit and lemon. Clean and refreshing brew and would be good for a hot summer day."

"Light color almost like apple cider. Very light in the taste, a weiss bier taste without the fullness. Not much to say for taste. Nice and frothy. A little hoppy for a wheat beer.. A simple wheat beer probably for people who want to try wheat beers but are not into them. Crisp!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like it. It is very refreshing and has a nice flavor that I guess is that of yeast. It hits the spot and is totally sessionable."
""
"O-There is a reason Gumballhead's label has a line about a wheat beer that doesn't suck. This beer isn't awful but brings little to the table."
"This was a beer that cried out to be agitated before the pour. Well, actually, it was hard to hear what it was saying over the howling of Hurricane/Tropical Storm Sandy, but I extrapolated based on previous knowledge. As such, I got a finger of thin, bone-white head with low retention off of my pour. Chalk the dying head up to barometric conditions, which are less than optimal right now. Color was a deeply cloudy orangish-yellow. Nose was very wheat-like with that sweetish scent that wheat imparts in beer. I always think of my Pops and his Wheaties when I was a kid when I smell it in beer. No question in my mind that wheat malts were in play here. Mouthfeel was medium it had a slight lemony tartness on the tongue which another feature of wheat beers. Finish was semi-dry and very refreshing. This would be an excellent summertime beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"No ""wow"" factor here, but it's still a decent wheat ale. I liked it."
""
""
"Overall: I like it. It has a very refreshing taste and is certainly very drinkable. Would go well with heavy foods like pizza and goulash."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, wheat, some lemon. Taste is refreshing, malts, a bit of hops, some lemon is present, very easy drinking. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer, best enjoyed during the summer."

"Blue star is a simple, easy drinking pale wheat ale. The low abv and relatively straight forward, yet interesting old-school flavor profile would make this an ideal session beer. Although not good enough for me to seek out in ABQ, I would give this strong consideration if I stumbled across it in a grocery store while looking for a solid wheat beer."
""
""
""
"This beer pours a hazy golden orange with a small one finger white head. The taste and smell is not quite as hoppy as I was expecting from North Coast. It has a smooth and light wheat body. There is a good deal of light malts and I get a tiny bit of rye. For the low ABV, this beer has a nice feel. Drinkable and not watery. A decent enough wheat ale, definitely not up to par with Oberon in my opinion but a decent enough beer to enjoy your evening with."

"Turns the style on its ear. Nothing soft or bread or sweet here. Aggressive and bitter and a little harsh. This could work well with food. I have some trouble going beyond one of these at a time though."
""
""
"Pours a murky honey orange with a 2 inch foamy orange-white head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Foamy patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat and malt mainly with maybe some light citrus aromas. Taste is of malt and wheat with a herbal and citrus zest hop flavor on the finish. There is a very mild hint of bitterness on the palate with each sip. There is also a weird, slightly funky aftertaste that comes out more as the beer warms. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average wheat beer but nothing I would go after again."
""
"O: I hold Oberon has the gold standard for wheat pale ales. This brew can stand up against it. Balance is key here, you get just enough of both the barley malt and the Nobel hops. Its highly quaffable and highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o Would not suggest. Would choose another/new wheat over this. All it does well is the citrus/tart/yeast overload."
"Sampled on April 14, 2012. The color is golden yellow with busy carbonation and a long lasting foamy off-white head. There is a little wheat on the nose but the aroma tends to be more hopped and citrus-based. The body is actually kind of nice with a medium texture and smooth. The taste is grainy and hoppy. This beer has a bigger bitter punch than most wheats I have had so in that regard it is unique."
""
""
""
""
"A cellar temperature that was shipped to me from CA is poured into a pint glass. The beer is cloudy and has a golden wheat color. A small white foam head sits on top. A decent amount of rising carbonation can be seen within. Aromas of wheat and some pale malt sweetness can be smelled coming off of the beer. The beer has a very pleasing pale wheat flavor. There is a healthy amount of grain here, but it isn't too sweet. The noble hops and some balance, but they do not posess a very strong flavor. They may add to the kiss of spiciness in the finish, but that could be only the yeast. Like many beers of this style, this ones tastes refreshing and would probably be best consumed on a warm day. It's medium body isn't sticky, and the carbonation levels are just right. It is a good example of the style, though not impressive enough for me to have it shipped across country again, as there are many fine examples produced closer to home. For anyone on the west coast, this is a good one to try."

"I would never have guessed that this was a wheat beer, but that does not make it a bad beer."
""
""
"With Spring on the horizon, I am looking for brews suitable to warmer weather, food from the grill/smoker, and a refresher after mowing. The beer had little lacing poured into a pint glass. A very mild but fresh smell. It constantly streamed bubbles and tingled my tongue. It cleansed my palate pleasingly after finishing a bowl of lobster bisque. it would pair well with BBQ sauces and burgers. The aftertaste was mild and refreshing. It would be a nice session drink while sitting on the deck."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a light and refreshing beer which is nice, but the flavor profile throws me. The lemony, orangey taste is not really what I'm looking for. This would probably be a great summer beer, but overall I'm unimpressed."
""
"O - as the temp goes up, down a few of these. Very enjoyable wheat beer with a few nice surprises."
"O - i wasn't expecting much out of this and am not a big big fan of wheat beers but this was definitely a job well done for north coast."
""
""
""
"On tap at Local Habit in San Diego. I liked it better as it warmed and I got used to the flavor."
""
"Excellent example of the type. Cloudy golden appearance with a nice white head that disappeared quickly. Nice wheat aroma with very smooth taste resulting in very refreshing experience. Very drinkable and would rate this as one of the better wheat beers I've had."
""
""
"Overall: Average, but wouldn't have again."
""
""
"Overall, a solid American Wheat that I would not hesitate to consume in quantity during warmer weather (or any other time for that matter). Clean and drinkable, a good session ale."
""
"Pours a light, cloudy yellow color with a one finger white head. Good lacing on my snifter glass. The nose is wheat, hops, lemon, and maybe a little grass thrown in there. Very light, and not offensive. Taste follows suit- same profile as the nose. Feel is very light, with average carbonation. Fairly average for this style. Overall, this is a decent beer- but not a great one. I probably won't look for this again. Cheers."
""

"Overall a great wheat beer. The balance is what sets this beer apart from so many others."
""
""

""
""
""

"Strange of me to order this, as I wasn't really in the wheat beer mood, but then I rarely am, so I figured I'd sample it. Poured a very hazy golden yellow, nearly opaque, with a small cap of white head that dissipated rather quickly. Aroma of pale malts, wheat, and bready yeast. Similar taste, with notes of pale malts, wheat, yeast, lemon pith and apple skins. Pretty nice actually, even if not overly flavorful or distinctive. Light-medium body, and decently drinkable for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Needs to be a tad more bitter for my liking but great on a hot summer day."
"Overall: Again, another beer that BMC drinkers will not be shocked by. On the other hand, a solid beer that more jaded beer drinkers, me included, might pass up in favor of something a little more substantial. Has great flavor and character but is not beefy."
"o - just as the bottle states, only the bare ingredients were used. impressively simple and quite drinkable."
"Overall: Pleasant enough and a cut above average for the style"
"Batting second is the Blue Star Wheat Ale...and it is very good! The color is a cloudy yellow with thin white head. The aroma included spice and citrus. The taste is very good; starts spicy then comes hints of citrus with a final spice on the pallet. The mouthfeel is very good and easy to drink. definitely a good wheat."
"O: Could have used more wheat flavor and less blandness."
"D - Overall, good drink; I found it to be very enjoyable and easy to handle; not a bad summer drink; I like the orange/peach blend in this drink, this wheat is not that overpowering and the fruits stand out very well"
"O: I have mixed feelings about this beer. Its lightness makes a great choice for summer days because the beer goes down easy and can be enjoyed in BBQ, parties, etc. but at the same time the taste wasn't as complete as I was hoping for."
"O: Not my favorite of the style. I know itâ€™s supposed to be light and refreshing in flavor, but I still felt this could use more. And what flavors were there were not the best. I would drink the Anchor, FFF, Lagunitas or SN versions over this any day."
"Overall: good run of the mill wheat. Its cheap and tasty just the way I like my hookers"
"Pours a hazy pale honey golden with a decent white head. Aroma is wheaty and fruity, the latter component almost entirely apple, and has a hint of honey. Wheaty flavor has a subtle apple undertone. Smooth, slightly fizzy texture is just a teensy watery but still acceptable."
"Plenty of head on top of the cloudy bright body. Super clean aroma with wheat sharpness and a delightful yeast dance in your nose. It's crisp and refreshing and sharp. Low ABV makes it extremely sessionable. It's hard not to just chug it. Great straight out of the bottle too. Highly recommended."
"Overall a nice hoppy wheat beer, by no means a hopfenweisse, but it doesn't proclaim to be. Great summer drinking and as i'm drinking this in the middle of winter, it is good enough to be had all year round."
"O- a decent wheat but not a choice for the style"
"Nice cloudy gold color creates a rocky white head on top. Great retention; lots of sticky lace. The nose is sharp with hops, a nice clean fruity balance, and mild grainy finish. Good nose. The body is firm with oily moments. Carbonation must have put all its strength into the foam at the top as this lacks a needed bite. A little slick at times. The Noble hops make their presence known with a nice bitter start; mild yeasty tartness in the middle, and a smooth bready finish with oat-like characteristics. Good hoppy Wheat here. I like it. Not one of my go-to styles, but this beer was a treat. Great summer brew."
"A simple, refreshing wheat ale with enough flavour to be worth drinking but maybe just a little too much body to truly be quaffable."
"Final Notes: The wheat beer lover would probably enjoy this beer, but it doesn't even compare to the true German Weizenbiers. Definitely tolerable, though."
"O: a decent pale wheat.. has nice flavors, just a tad bit muted."
"Taste-Fresh wheat, cracker malt, biscuit, lemon zest, nice spicy hop prescence makes itself known and provides a wonderfull balance and flavor. Very refreshing and tasty. Great flavor and character in a wheat ale. Another winner from North Coast. Salute the Summer with a case of these! Yummy!"
"This wheat beer pours out as a cloudy yellowish orange color. The head was fluffy and white before is settled and turned into just a thin little coating of the beer. The smell of this brew was of grains and wheat. The taste was soft with lots of wheat, grains and malts. There wasn't much of a hop flavor at all. The mouthfeel was smooth and is worth having in the warmer months of the year. Overall it's an ok brew, North Coast has much better beers out there."
"Overall I like how sweet this beer was and close to style. I would pick up the pilsner just to tick it since it may also be well done. A definite summer ale on a hot day."
"Where American wheat ales are generally less favorable to more authentic German counterparts, this one falls a hair better than average in this lesser catagory. But on a 90 degree day at the ball park, this one is welcome in my cup!"
"Flavor is light, easygoing, with a little citrus spice. Blue Star is refreshing and easy to drink, and likely a superlative gateway to craft beers. Solid and worthy."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable, but not an outstanding beer. I could have another, but I probably would not go out of my way for this beer."
"D: Not very satisfying... leaves you hollow. I'l be sticking to Oberon and Gumbalhead"
"Final thought - Wheat beer isn't my style, but I could hang with this one every so often, when it's nice and warm outside"
"Pours a very hazed yellowish orange color with a thick yellowish white head and a little lacing. Smells of coriander, orange, and wheat. Tastes of wheat, coriander, spice, and citrus. Mouthfeel is medium with a good carbonation. Drinkability is high. I like this one."
"Beer is medium to light in body, a little grainy but not bad, it has a decent finish but there isn't much in the flavor department...not much at all. It's a throw away boring average beer, nothing much to say about it. I won't have it again."
"D- This beer is fantastic and shows what the style should be without taking a brewer's approach to it. The low flavor and ABV makes this a perfect gateway beer. I am always impressed with North Coast and their basic yet great drinking beers."
"D - A refreshing and very drinkable offering although I would like a bit more depth."
"Overall: A nice, lightly spiced and lightly hoppy wheat. Still clean and crisp yet with a bit more bite to keep things interesting."
"D: went down like water and was a very sessionable that you can drink on a hot summer day."
"D - The drinkability is very good here. This is a solid wheat beer. I could easily drink a lot of these in a sitting. It is definitely one of the better wheat beers that I've had. I recommend giving it a shot."
"First time I have had this beer. It does not remind me of a German Hefe, but is not bad. More citrus notes, and a little thin. Reminds me of Widmer."
"EDIT: after trying another bottle of this, I've found that the unusual sweetness on the finish tastes just like Gold Rum. I'm not sure if I like this or not, so I will continue through the six pack and edit again with a verdict."
"Dry finish, gritty taste, seems like the malt percentage that is wheat is really high on this one. A very agreeable beer when that's what you are looking for. I wonder why this isn't more popular given some of the ones that are. Good hydration beer."
"To be honest, the beer is a bit one-dimensional...but it is very, very drinkable. I could put down quite a few of these without a second thought."
"This beer smells very heavily of wheat and pours a golden yellow color. It has a smooth mellow taste that goes down on the lighter side. And oh yeah the head of foam stick around, even with a little left at the last sip. Can tell this a beer is made with quality materials. Definetly worth a try."
"I find it pretty comparable to a ""Summer Ale"" or one of Sam Adams' Coastal Wheats, the taste is similarly mild and refreshing. I would like to try one again, although wheat beers aren't my favorite style."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and rich enough for the style. Drinkability is pretty good for a very mild and subtle beer. The low abv lends itself to the classic ""session beer"" requirements."
"Damn late running board meetings!!! Almost missed today...Pours a tasty gold with the slightest haze to it, lots of carbonation and almost no head to speak of, but there is a bit of lace. Kind of like the straight A high school girl who is also captain of the cheerleaders. Lots of lemon and citrus in the nose, and some maltiness. Flavor is wonderful, again like the cheer captain. Bright, crisp, clean, but also very full of wheat and long on the finish, which carries a great bitter balance. This is really excellent beer, and as drinkable as keg beer on a Friday night after the big game. Really well priced, too, so find and drink up kids, practice tomrrow morning and homework!!"
"D - I plan on making this a go-to summer beer, assuming I can find it in Illinois."
"D: session brew. Accommodating and rewarding, flat out...just a great drinker"
"D - Good summertime quaffer. As far as APWAs, this and Bell's Oberon are the only ones I'd buy again (just read about the Three Floyds' take, haven't tried it yet)."
"D: The APWA style is not going to make anyone go crazy. Blue Star and Gumballhead are about as good as it gets, go with them."
"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Really deep, rich hue, and a pretty nice head. Nose is not profound, but does have a nice mix of components. Flavor, again, is pretty basic, but has a nice easy balance. Overall, this is pretty good quaff."
"D: Fair flavor, moderate abv and refrewhing finish make it easily drinkable."
"Going through Naked Pint book (HIGHLY recommended) and trying their various recommendations for good examples of particular styles. This one was recommended as a good example of an American Wheat beer. It's everything I expected, smooth, not hoppy at all. Light-medium carbonation. Yellow to goldish color. Just nothing a/b it blew me away. I guess I now know what to expect from a wheat beer."
"D: Good ABV, a great balance and flavor... I could drink a few of these.... Maybe one of my new favorites... I'll look out for this one over the summer."
"pours an apple cider brown with a half inch off white head. sediment dances around my glass. smells of lemon and citrus, strong yeast, orange, spice, clove, and coriander. the taste is sharp, but short. grain, orange rind, and slightly bitter finish. crisp and refreshing. a good summer brew."
"Overall I thought this was a very Americanized wheat with loads of hops. Not a bad thing but know what to expect."
"Drinkability good - not heavy and with moderate ABV. No problem tossing a few back."
"D - This is a very refreshing & thirst quenching brew, great for the summer and extremely drinkable. I would of liked a bit more citrus in there along with more flavor on the finish, but still worth a try, I wouldn't seek this one out though, in fact I'll still be looking for better before trying this one again."
"M - Mouthfeel is medium bodied, lots of residual sugars left in here. Carbonation is medium too, adequate, but less than I'd expect for a wheat ale."
"D: Solid, APWA. Good in the spring and summer months. I'm drinking it during the butthole of winter because I didn't know what this was until I took a closer look at a single. I haven't seen it in six packs in the store I normally go to, though."
"Value: I've seen it for $9.99 a sixer. Awesome deal!"
"D) A good summer wheat. Have more than one."
"A very odd beer. But I must admit, the more I drink the better it seems to taste. I guess you just need to get acclimated to it. Strangely medicinal with virtually no hop crispness. Unfortunately, the flavor is very muddled."
"Pours into a New Belgium balloon as a nice light hazy yellow with a super fast white head that leaves no lacing. The wheat smell is strong but appealing. I'm not usually a big fan of wheat beers but this one in my opinion is very smooth and tasteful. Mouthfeel is nice with the brew rolling easily across the palate. Not too malty or grainy making this one pretty easy to drink. Much better than average for the style. I think this one would be pretty good for an easy drinking warm summer day."
"Overall, not a bad beer. Nothing I would drink on a regular basis, but it is decent. Has some things I like and don't like to it. Drinkable, however."
"Poured into a standard pint glass. Lovley golden color, minimal lacing, minimal head. Smells and tastes wheaty (of course) with some mild hoppiness and a slight honey aftertaste. It felt a bit thin on my pallate. Good drinkability, a nice beer for a summer afternoon, nothing special though."
"The dinner pairing would have worked fine but I slathered Sriracha all over my chicken to add some flavor and the spiciness ended up overpowering the beer."
"Drinkability is respectable, not one of the best NCBC offerings, but a semi respectable attempt of the style."
"High drinkability as the low alcohol content and the easy drinking make this a great summer brew."
"D: It would be a decently drinkable beer, if it only had more flavor."
"Drinks slow & not that interesting, just another wheat beer out there. Had this on draft a decade ago in San Francisco, thought it was slightly better, maybe my least favorite north Coast brew, I guess the 5 remaining will get choked down with football season looming..."
"So this is what a west coast American wheat tastes like. First time I've had a APWA that pulled that much hop flavor."
"Pours a nice golden yellow making it almost look like juice. This bubbly white head that dissipates rather quickly. Light aroma of sweet malts and some citrus. Taste mimiced the aroma but wasn't too strong. Carbonation is there, but the beer felt a little bit too thin. Overall a good beer for anyday drinking."
"Cloves, bananas, peach, and some spiciness. Powerdy yeastiness in the flavor too. peppery spice. Very tasty. Smooth creamy mouthfeel and a fairly nice drinker."
"Not a bad wheat ale. Poured up as pale wheat ale should, with an egg yolk yellow-orange colour and a nice sized frothy white head. Smell was pleasant and gentle with detectable wheat present and a bit of what I perceived to be a mild peppery aroma. Nice. Taste was flavourful, again with the presence of wheat and the modest peppery nuance. Mouthfeel, to me, was a bit heavy considering the style and the relatively low abv. I was somewhat surprised, actually. Overall drinkability is about average I would say. It's no 3F's Gumball Head, to be sure, but it's still a good pale wheat. I would buy it again."
"Notes: The first North Coast beer that I would pass over in a selection of same style offerings."
"Drinkability- It was pretty good. I would have it again. I'm not rushing out to get it but it is good."
"Drinkability: A very nice brew that lacks the up front banana and clove that we all want. Not bad, though."
"Drinkability: It's not that impressive -- not your typical wheat. It certainly lives up to the ""American"" in the American Wheat Ale style. However, it's not offensive, and is smooth drinking."
"overall very different from your normal wheat beer."
"D - Very refreshing, low ABV equals something extremely drinkable."
"Drinkability: Fair to decent. I'd do it again."
"But give this to someone looking for a Widmer of a Blue Moon and they might come over to our side."
"Average color for unfiltered wheat beer. Nothing remarkable in the flavor department. Not complex, but not terrible. Beyond the wheaty and pleasant finish, not much flavor at all. Perhaps on tap and very VERY cold would have been a better experience."
"Solid wheat character on the palate--a little chewy with some pleasant prickliness. The flavor starts out a little fruity, a twang in the center, ending with a little spice. Pretty standard stuff here."
"Pours a lightly hazed yellow-orange color with a smallish head of white foam. Nose is bright, fresh citrus - lemon and tangerines - with a bit of wheat and peach. Quite light and dry on the tongue, with a pronounced husky grain flavour and something resembling those fuzzy peach gummy candies. Some orangey hops and wheaty twang finish this off. Carbonation is quite hard. Interesting, tasty brew suitable for summer drinking."
"Drinkable, but nothing I'd reach for."
"If this were a person, it would be a mid level human resources clerk. Just getting by, picking up their check, numb and happy."
"A cloudy golden color pour with about two fingers of white head, medium to heavy carbonation. Aroma is on the light side a little wheaty,yeasty,with mild citrus notes. Flavor of dry wheat,doughy yeast,lemon,lime,and maybe some peach, and more light malty sweetness,and lemon. Creamy mouthfeel,medium body,this would be quite sessionable, I would buy this again."
"But the taste is lacking. Even the smell is not up to par. It just doesn't have much taste, it's a crisp taste, kinda like pears, but there is not much umph."
"Pours a nice cloudy yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger foamy white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, grassy, with some pears. The taste is malty, sweet, grassy, fruity. Medium body. Drinkable, not too bad."
"Pretty drinkable beer, not bad overall."
"Pale/golden in color with a decent looking head. Smells like wheat/grains with a bit of hoppage in the nose. The taste is very reminiscent of a lemon peel with a bit of bitterness at the end. This is very well carbonated and is pretty light on the palate. This is the best installment of the style that I have had to this point. I can see it being pretty darn drinkable on a hot summer day."
"Drinkability: I am really glad we can finally get this beer here in town, better then the average wheatbeer, excellent to introduce people to Northcoast brewery also"
"Poured a hazy yellow with thin white head. Smelled fairly sweet with good amounts of wheat and yest. Tasted sweet with a quick finish. This is a light bodied beer with decent drinkability. I was fairly disappointed in this beer. While there isn't anything wrong with it I was just expecting more and was a little disappointed, with that being said I could see how some people will find this to be a nice summer beer."
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow color with a nice white head that stays a while. Smells of wheat. Tastes of thin wheat flavors, a lighter beer with background citrus taste, lemon particularly. Mouthfeel was good just as in any other wheat beer, smooth and easy to drink. Nothing stood out about this beer but is wasn't bad..."
"A highly drinkable beer - sure I had mine in the completely wrong season, but I could easily see having a bunch of these in a bucket of ice on a summer day - very refreshing."
"Notes: Definitely one of the best wheats I have ever tasted."
"M - Mouthfeel is good, thin/medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation."
"Poured a hazy, dirty golden color with decent white head that dissipated to a thin white film along the top. Aroma was of wheat, grain. Taste was also wheaty, but of little else. Mouthfeel was okay. I was not impressed with this beer at all, which coming from North Coast surprises me. Maybe I got an old one."
"The yellow-orange hue is light enough for the cloudiness to show fully, looks warm even if it's icy cold. Very pretty white head comprised of tiny bubbles, disappears swiftly leaving residue around the rims. Clean, if heavy, nose of grain, wheat, wild yeasts with an interesting saline edge, allusion to apricot and peach pits, not especially citrusy, sheer weight sticks around in your nostrils longer than the scents. Medium-bodied, as in the nose attains freshness in spite of its weight and relative lack of movement. Hint of orange rind, otherwise it's the grain, hops, wheat to keep things more tart than not. Above average carbonation really works to lift things off the tongue. Admirably, doesn't leave much behind after you swallow, not out to over-impress. Could drink a lot. Just probably not remember it a week later."
"Pours a slightly hazed yellow with a small white head that leaves small lacing as it slowly departs. The nose is sweet and yeasty. Full of lemon flavors and touch of clove or some spice(maybe the yeast shining through), slightly tart middle finishing pretty crisp and clean,with a sweet aftertaste. The body is light which lends to good drinkability while not being at all watery or too thin. Good summer brew and not a bad winter one either."
"Pours a cloudy, dark golden orange color with a thin foamy off-white head. Aroma is hoppy with hints of citrus fruit peel and banana. Tastes like a bitter, hoppy wheat beer with hints of citus fruit, lemon zest, cloves, and bananas. Slightly sour finish."
"Not a bad beer, but not much of a wheat, and nothing I would go to any trouble to have again."
"M/D - good mouthfeel and a nice brew overall. its a nice hot day kind of a beer."
"I had this one at North Coast's taproom. They served it with a slice of lemon, which I'm not a fan of, more's the pity. Even so, I found this to have relatively good flavor for a wheat beer. There are good grain notes and some citrus. The malt comes through when it's needed. The beer is bright yellow with some haziness, although it was hard to tell how much that lemon was altering things. It was cold and foggy when I had this beer and that was probably not the optimal setting for such a light, smooth beer."
"Pours a pale, golden body that is moderately cloudy and leaves a one-finger head that leaves minor lacings. The smell leaves noticeable aromas of fruit and yeast but not so much malt. The taste and mouthfeel are very smooth. You could say the lack of malt in the beer hurts it if you like a dry finish. Nothing too good to brag about though. Had at Moe's in Lee, MA."
"D - Pretty refreshing, easy to session, great hot weather beer"
"D: Absolutely drinkable, I'm sad I didn't discover this beer until the end of the summer but there are still some more warm Texas months to enjoy this beer this year."
"Pours a hazy golden color topped with a moderate off-white head that does settle down a bit. It certainly has a dirty water look to it. Very wheaty aroma with hints of lemon and an overall fresh type of smell to it but it's subtle and could be mistaken for the smell you get after cleaning your house. The flavor is mild lemon spice with a mix of citrus malts. It's not a bad wheat but something is missing to make it a good beer. I'd have no problem having it again on a hot day but it's definitely limited. And for the record, if I'm going to drink a North Coast brew on a warm day I'll take a Scrimshaw Pils."
"nice beer. I would gladly suck on a few of these on a hot day."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured a medium foamy head on a cloudy light orange body. Smelled of hoppiness, sweetness, with hints of banana and cloves, as well as caramel. There was no hoppiness in the taste, though, which I was happy about. The orange and banana came through in the taste, but the caramel was surprisingly strong, but in a good way. Also surprising was the smoothness...very, very smooth, despite a more than average carbonation. Went down very easily. A good wheat, not among the greats, but the caramel and smoothness really made it a good brew."
"D- a knockout of an APWA, a single that i almost didn't buy, and another example of my foolish underestimation. suited to my tastes, this is without a doubt the best APWA i've ever had ever."
"Recommended..."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, very mild kick, good representation of style, not quite the best wheat beer but it's still a decent beer to pound for a while when you want something light."
"Lightly hazy light golden wheat with a fizzy lid of off-white. Light nose of softly sweet wheaty grain, lightly lemony and yeasty estery. Soft light-medium body with modestly creamy carb and flavors of mellowly sweet/tangy wheat with some lemony citrus and estery yeastiness. A bit of spice in the end. Pleasant and sessionable."
"The mouthfeel is fairly light and a little drying. Wouldn't be that bad if it wasn't for the plastic taste."
"Drinkability- Quite nice."
"this was kind of a boob of a beer, not a nice young firm one, more like a granny teet .... a bit thin in the mouth ... geez, such a simple dumbed down beer .. some lacing ... needs more- everything ..""make me a bike, clown!!"" ... lacks character, integrity, and morals.... and fuck the people who ask for this.."
"Nice semi-clear yellow in color with a nice white head that disappears very quickly and leaves no lace to speak of. Subdued aroma of bread crust and some citrus with a nice hop profile sitting underneath. Taste is clean and refreshing with a bready start giving way to just enough hops to make it interesting and finishing sweetly with some banana peel and apple. medium to light feel but with more carbonation than expected helping to fill it out. On this 96 degree day I find this to be very drinkable, but all in all I don't think it's quite enough to be in regular rotation."
"Poured like a traditional wheat. No head on the clear straw colored pour,had some good carbonation as it bubbled for a while. The nose was wheat and floral. Subtle lemon flavors, with wheat and some smoothness to it but not ebough wheat for me. Not a fan of wheats/hefes but this one did not have enough wheat for me. The body was a little weak, not much backbone and nothing really spectacular. It was average but nothing I would drink again."
"Notes: Solid stuff. Excellent for long sessions, BBQs or any other time when you'd want a simple refreshing beer."
"I could drink a whole case of this stuff if I can find it. Otherwise, I'll just buy a good amount of six-packs in the meantime; great stuff!"
"The drinkability is ok is this is a style you like, otherwise it is pretty average and not worth seeking out. MK"
"Sudsy, slick,clean and refreshing. High levels of carbonation, but easily drinkable."
"I like this beer. It pours a very pale, almost shocking, golden color with a sizable head that lingers longer than one would expect. It lacks much in the way of an aroma, but the flavor was pleasantly wheaty, with overtones of tropical fruit. It has a satisfying mouthfeel. The flavor and texture sustain through to the finish. This is a solid American Wheat and would be refreshing on a hot day. I don't know that it lives up to the excellence of some other North Coast offerings, but neither is it anything to be ashamed of."
"Easy drinker, although overall, I was thoroughly unimpressed. On the chance the bottle was bad, I may edit later on, but I have a feeling the bottle wasn't bad, it's just a fairly unimpressive example of the style."
"Semi-hazy blonde in appearance with a low dense head on top. The aroma brings out some fruit notes and some hops as well. The begining of each drink crisp wheat malt, a twang of fruit, and a moderate representation of hops for the style. As a beer, this is solid. Keep it cold for a warm day and enjoy."
"Final thoughts - Very light. Not much in the way of flavor."
"D: This is a pretty drinkable beer despite its debits. It's certainly not my favorite among this style, but it's still good."
"A cloudy yellow beer. Had a small white head that evaporated before I even got the glass to my lips. There is a light wheat aroma with hints of herbs and spices in the background. Light and lemony with a nice herbal character and a hint of clove in the background. While I don't generally like American wheat beers. This had more flavor and character than most of the rest."
"Cracked a bottle open after a long bike ride and this really hit the spot. Light and refreshing, yet full of flavor. The wheat malt isn't as clean as I'd expect for an American wheat, it's a pleasant sweet bread flavor. Balanced by the malt are very fruity hops, lots of citrus and no harsh bitterness. There's also a little kick of yeasty earthyness. All in all, this is relatively complex session beer. At times I got a slight cilantro aroma, which makes me think they used Summit hops. I also could have used a little bitterness, but maybe that's just me."
"Drinkability: An easy drinker, sessionable, I guess. For me this is just another ""American Wheat Beer"". I put two of these in a mixed 6 pack. It will be a long while before I buy this again."
"Perfect hazy golden pour with a big lasting white head in a weizen glass. Smell is lemony, lightly wheaty, and refreshingly simple. Taste is fairly light, lemony, very mildly wheat, and a bit of tartness. Perfectly crisp bite and finish, yet smooth at the same time. A nice wheat which although lacking some flavor, is a good easy drinking summer beer nonetheless."
"pours a pretty dark orange color without alot of head, has a TON of sediment in it, lots of big chunks floating around in there. smell is kinda weak, but not bad, just doesn't jump out at me like other beers, but to its defense i'm not using the proper vessel. the taste is good though, has your normal citrus flavor, but has a little more body to it than other wheat beers. from what i can remember alot of wheat beers are kinda weak when it comes to alcohol volume and such, this beer keeps up a more normal 4-5 range. good beer all around."
"Poured out a light hazy color. Small head retention. Good clove and banana aromas, finished witha slight lemony bite. Thank God the bartender knows better than to put a lemon in any of my beers. Nice light, crisp mouthfeel. I would compare this more to the Kristall-Weizens I had in Deutchland rather than a Hefe, makes drinkability high, and a very enjoyable Amer. wheat for the summer to look foward to"
"Pours a pale, golden body that is moderately cloudy and leaves a one-finger head that leaves minor lacings. The smell leaves noticeable aromas of fruit and yeast but not so much malt. The taste and mouthfeel are very smooth, with the citrus and yeast a little overpowering the hops for a sweeter drink, but I am not complaining. You could say the lack of malt in the beer hurts it if you like a dry finish, but I think for an American Pale Wheat it was nice having a smooth flow. Nothing too complex here to write about, but I bought a 6-pack the other day and it is gone"
"Taste is mild. Citrus is up front. Orange rind. Good carbonation. The finish is also strong such as yeast and a little sour. Good drinking."
"This beer smelled hoppy, with a faint bit of citrus, and wheat breadish. The taste was kind of bland, moved from the malts to a strong wheat aftertaste that lets you know itÂ’s a wheat. It was easy to drink due to it being a watery wheat. I wasn't very impressed with this offering, but that's not to say I would never have it again."
"Overall not bad. I was really not the biggest fan of this one, but to be honest I have had much worse. This was definitly a quality beer and something that I would probably not buy again, but would not snub my nose at it either."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is unfiltered and cloudy (as expected) and appears a yellow-orange color in the glass with a thin head comprised of many fine bubbles. The smell is what you might expect from an American wheat beer; wheat (duh), a hint of citrus fruitiness and maybe just a touch of yeast. The taste is much the same, starts slightly sweet with the wheat and citrus notes shining through but it finishes with a mild bitterness that is transparent in the smell, making for a well balanced beer. The mouthfeel is a light-medium body with a fairly agressive carbonation that suits the beer well. Overall a very enjoyable and sessionable beer. Quaffable even. Good example of an APWA."
"Blue Star Great American Wheat Beer pours a hazy lemon yellow color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a touch of lemon in the aroma. There is a light flavor, you can taste the wheat and then there's some lemon. A simple, sessionable beer."
"When I poured it, I thought that it looked like lemon juice. It ended up being a telltale sign. The lemon flavor is very heavy, but not so overpowering that it ruins the beer in itÂ’s entirety, I felt. I will admit that I like strong flavors in a beer, so anything that is very full will most likely get more points from me. It might be so strong that it makes it that you have to dig that lemon flavor in your wheat beer (or full flavors in general), otherwise you might not appreciate it that much."
"There's a fair amount of hops, though they do weave in and out a bit - enough to make it stand out a bit in its style. All-together a fine refresher and better than the run-of-the mill APWA."
"My friend picked up a 6 pack this week and brought it over. Pours a golden yellow color with sparkling carbonation. Creamy 3"" bright white head sits on top. Smell is of grains, corn, malt, cheap smelling with a little spice. Taste is grains and a little sweet honey. Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth. Not really a typical Wheat beer."
"Feels dry in the wheat feel, but wet in the fruity feel. Really thirst-quenching. A little tingly, but smooth. Thick, surprisingly. A good sweet wheat beer. Light, fruity, refreshing."
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz. bottle. The beer pours a hazy light gold, forming a 1 inch head that quickly fades, leaving light spots of lace. The aroma is a very light mix of wheat malt and hops. The taste starts out with a light taste of malt, and slight fruitiness, and ends with a noticeable hop presence. Light smooth mouthfeel. Very drinkable brew. Overall, I didnt know what to expect from this beer, but I wasnt dissappointed. Not too much flavor is present, but I can see this being an afternoon summer beer. Worth a try."
"Just okay. Thirst-quenching, but not tasty."
"This is a very light and refreshing beer. Perfect for the summer."
"Pours out a murky nectarine with a thick 3 finger head that maintains its fluffy and dimpled presence for a while. Smells like malted wheat, pale malt, citrus, and grass. Hops come out most in the flavor with the wheat and malt more in the background. Some apricot too. Mouthfeel is light, but some weight from the yeast sediment, but the carbonation is weak. Solid drinkability. Tasty and refreshing."
"Drinkability: A likeable, even welcome wheat beer for the summer. Shine on, lil' Blue Star, shine on!"
"As noted, too fizzy and slightly watery. This is on the list with Goose Island 312 as uninspired wheat beers produced by top-notch breweries. Not offensive, just not really worth the time."
"Taste is a refreshing splash of wheat. Texture is a bit watery and thin with a slightly oily aftertaste that sticks to the insides of my mouth until it breaks down or I sip again. A bit of a one trick pony with the wheat, no complexity or other layers but still adept for picking one up on a hot summer's day."
"It's light bodied, but displays good complexity for the style. Very drinkable. A very good choice for a summer beer."
"Had this on tap at Little Star Pizza in San Francisco. Poured a cloudy off yellow with a fizzy head. Smell reminded me of honey and beeswax (or a floral candle). The taste had a nice hoppy tang but didn't have much complexity. Mouthfeel had a light carbonation. An average wheat all around."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a hazy golden orange color with a creamy white head that leaves a decent amount of lacing around the sides of the glass. There is not much going on in the aroma with some malted wheat, yeast and just a hint of hops. Much like the aroma, the taste is pretty bland. Overall, this is a pretty bland offering that really does not have any qualities that stand out in any way to make me want to drink another."
"this is one beer that i will be re-reviewing in the future, and i will be discussing this with my beer ""hook up"" to obtain a better sample."
"Dirty yellow, with not so great head, and lackluster retention. Smell is a wheat field, malty and cool. After this the taste is surprising... American micro toffee, with plenty of fluffy wheat, and a late sting of hops on the back of the tongue. This feels nice going down, and is damn drinkable."
"bought this beer at the premiere store as a single bottle, very very carbonated, almost like a soda-fizz to it. very refreshing beer that was very easy to drink, light bitterness and a good citrus smell to it. if your not too crazy into bitter pale beers, this one is a good american pale wheat to have. very easy on the taste buds, but not with a lack of flavor."
"Drinkability - a good session pick, probably would be ideal with anything off the grill."
"D- I love wheat beers and this is just not the example I was looking for. Its too thin, too watery, too overcarbonated, and too acidic."
"12 oz. bottle- color of pale hazy yellow , with a thick white head - nose of cereal , dried bananas , slight cloves , sweet lemon , and barnyard Â– taste of citrus , wheat , yeast, and that sweet lemon - body sparkely , and with sight acidity Â– aftertaste of sour acidic, and cereal"
"Drinkability: Easy drinking, like most wheat beers. A good, tart taste."
"Good stuff."
"D: Aw, it's ok I guess. I'd take it again over macro swill, but I hope to never be in that position. Otherwise, I don't see it in the fridge again."
"Pretty decent, but really not all that remarkable."
"Very nice pour there Â– lemon yellow with a pillowy white head, and nice laces, which can be hard to come by with a wheat."
"Pours an opaque white-gold with next to no head, which is disappointing. Aromas hint at sweetness beneath -- a bit of caramel in there, along with a few more fruity esters of the citrus variety. Pretty typical for an American wheat beer -- mildly citric, very little spice. On the tongue, the citrus flavors are the biggest story here. At first the beer is sharply carbonated and a little sweet, but at the mid-palate it starts to dry out, with the citrusy acid components taking over. The finish is quite dry and slightly bitter, with lingering tingles on the tongue. Overall, this is a very good wheat beer for an American producer; it's slick and refreshing enough to suit many palates, but has enough citrus notes to interest those looking for style points. Rather good."
"I am not a huge fan of hefe's or wheat beers in general, and that is probably why I enjoyed this very mild wheat beer. A: Cloudy as one would expect in a wheat beer S: Grainy and yeasty aromas with a fair amount of lemony zest T: Very smooth and no yeast induced bite that I find unappealing in most wheat beers M: medium to light bodied with a feel that is smoother than usual for a weizen D: All in all a drinkable mild wheat beer that is best suited for warm weather consumption."
"D - Overall, I'd say this is a good Am. Pale Wheat Ale."
"Overall an apwa i can enjoy. Usually this style falls short compared to many others with wheat, imho, but this is quite enjoyable. crisp and light, but enough complexity to keep it interesting."
"A mediocre beer that has the look and feel of a wheat beer, but with a taste that is really lacking. Not bad; just uninspiring. Really overpriced, so I won't be getting it again."
"A sweet barley, wheaty intro, with an earthy malt coming through till the the hops kick in, giving a bitter and crisp finish too this brew. The alcohol goes unnoticed and there is a bit of a tangy as well as grainy flavor/ texture to this unique wheat beer. A bit of a lemony aftertaste, quite refreshing and ultra easy to drink. A good Summer sessioner that's worth tasting."
"While it's not outstanding anywhere, each part has just enough going on to be credible, and it's here that it comes together, with the light, airy nature making it quite drinkable. I won't look here ot be wowed, because that won't happen, but on a damned hot night, like tonight, it has a refreshing spin that makes it a decent option."
"D- i think this is best served when in need of refreshment. Im beginning to think that pale wheats are just not my thing. Though this is one of the better wheats ive ran into."
"Pours hazy golden color with white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is wonderful, cascade hops. Taste is hop bitterness, not much more. Doesn't linger in finish very long. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium with a little bite from carbonation. This is a great summer beer, too bad it cost $10 for a six pack or I would drink this more. If you like American wheat beers and hops, you'll like this."
"A good summer beer, but nothing too special."
"This wheat beer poured out a nice deep golden color, with typical wheat haziness. Gave a decent light head, but it did not stick around long, some mild lacing produced as the beer went down. Nothing really stuck out in the smell, mild citrus and wheat. The mouthfeel was light, and noticed a good deal of carbonation at that point. Beer went down smooth with a light crisp taste, again with just mild hints of citrus and wheat. If you gave me this for a summer night I wouldn't complain, but I wouldn't remember you in the morning either."
"d - finishes much stronger. would purchase again but wouldn't seek out."
"D - Very drinkable beer. I've seen this at the supermarket many times but always pass it up. I'll be sure to have a few of these on hand from now on. Nice summer beer!"
"Overall a pretty decent Pale Wheat Ale not the best but not the worst."
"Again, my first real experience with a wheat beer and it was quite enjoyable. I will definitely have this again and wil further explore this style."
"guy at the store recommended this one...had never tried it, so i was game. Flavors on this one are subdued..not much hops..but mild wheat/grain flavor. appearance was a nice cloudy unfiltered yellow. Head was about an inch with some lacing. Smell was a definate yeast...but you taste less than you smell. Had a fairly thick mouthfeel..but was rather bland..was hopeing for more of a kick at the end...no kick...just a subdued wheat taste. Overall average...could have used a little more citris whang to it...or more hopps...not a bad beer, but not terribley outstanding...would be pretty good with some foods..since it wouldnt cover up the flavor of the dish."
"This one was okay but fairly ho-hum for the most part. Nothing bad about it but nothing overwhelming by any stretch. Drinkable but not memorable."
"Extremely cloudy wheat, with a white-yellow hue. A thin bubbly, quickly dissapating head. Smells mild, mostly of yeast, and surprising clean, with a faint but focused hop aroma. Taste - oh, this is definitely not a witbier, which is what I was anticipating when I excitedly and hurriedly saw a North Coast wheat beer and picked it up as part of a mix-a-six. That definitely comes into play here as I don't enjoy most other wheat beer styles... Taste is tangy, bitey, and citrusy, not sweet. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light though, with too much carbonation especially for a wheat beer. On the tounge it is not as heavy as I would expect it to be. This is light years better than Magic Hat's circus boy, for certain. And it is drinkable. If you like this style, I think it would be an fine beer to stock for casual drinking. Keep in mind that nothing legitimately 'bad' comes out of North Coast. But all around this one seems mostly to sing ""average."" Your mileage may vary."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow with a nice off white head. The aroma has notes of citrusy hops, sour wheat, toasted bread and yeast; appealing and light. The flavor starts off with hoppy citrus notes, followed by toasted bread, mild cane sugar sweetness, yeast and a wheaty twang. The mouthfeel is light and crisp with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good. A very nice pale wheat ale from north coast, refreshing and crisp with a lot of flavor."
"Poured a smallish head with no retention. Color was a pale yet golden sunshine color. The lacing was defiently subpar with any average wheat beer. Smell was tart and a little metallic. The flavor was a tart banana and wheat melange with some plae malts in the mix. But all these flavors were pretty muted. Mouthfeel was dry and run of the mill as far as wheat beers go."
"I have to tell you, I like this one. It's got a FULL body, for a wheat, nice thick mouthfeel. Goes down smoothly and you can drink quite a few of these. A great session beer, moderately priced, low hops, strong malt and wheat. An unusually terrific smell for a wheat. If you want to drink a lot of sessions, give this one a whirl."
"A very drinkable American wheat, a style I generally don't care for if brewers go overboard on hops or if the yeast character is non-existent. This is a flavorful beer, delicate and light, but with good character."
"May be too subtle for some, again, i recommend you try this as the first beer of the day, not after anything else. this is the only american wheat(not hefe) that I buy with any regularlity."
"I'll pass on this one next time I come across it."
"Drinkability: This is an easy drinking wheat beer."
"Overall- a damn fine Wheat beer. Maybe to light to drink on a cold winter evening but perfect for a bbq or baseball game!"
"Good mouthfeel; not heavy, not watery. Just good beer. I usually buy a few of these to keep in my beer fridge."
"Nice beer."
"Satisfying smooth drinking wheat beer. Just nice at end of a long hot day. Good yeast. Grain. Nice sweet malt and hops. Some citrus, vanilla, coriander. Perfect carbonation and mid mouthfeel. Not a big beer, done very well. Its white and also has an Orange hue. Recommended."
"North Coast is impressive with their offerings. This is a highly reccomended beer to at least test out."
"Poured a cloudy golden orange, frothy head dissappated almost immediately to side glass lacing. Smell wasn't very strong, fruity and somewhat yeasty. Though I wasn't impressed by the appearance or smell. The taste was great. Very sweet and biscuity tasting at the front. Then fruity and slightly floral hops, with a crisp dry slightly tart finish. Mouthfeel was creamy and malty. I could drink this one over and over. Loved it. Not much like most wheats I've had, but very good!!!"
"Mouth feel is light, but is a bit oily in the finish. Easy drinking, but nothing spectacular."
"Finish is a tad dry, otherwise a decent american wheat. Goes down quick, not too bad considering its 1am and itÂ’s still about 100 degrees outside."
"medium to light body make this a summer thirst quencher"
"Hazy honey in colour. Head plummets quickly. No lace. Some carbonation. The nose carries a bready and lemony scent almost like lemon squares if you've ever eaten one. Good citrus layers. The taste dances across the palate with a bitter and sour sting. This beer has some flavor. There is an aftertaste that is less than pleasant. Yeasty wheat or something. The body is medium and the drinkability is good despite the funky aftertaste."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a smallish white head that dissipates rather quickly. Slightly sweet nose of wheat, grassy hops, and a hint of citrus. Palate is nice, light, and crisp, with notes of grassy hops, tangy wheat, citrus, and orange peel, with a muted herby character in the background. Body is light, but slightly foamy. Overall, nice and refreshing, but not exactly a groundbreaking beer."
"This one pours a soft, golden yellow color. Not quite copper, but close. The head retention is minimal. The scents are faint. A little bready, a little malty. The taste is citrusy at first, followed by a good wheat flavor with a hop kick. This also has an excellent finishing flavor. No bad aftertaste whatsoever. The drink finishes smooth and clean. Refreshing. Mouthfeel is average on this one and I find it quite easy to drink. Although this one is not great, I do find it hard to complain about this beer. Good enough to be good, but not quite spectacular."
"Body is medium and smooth, with rolling carbonation and a wheaty mouthfeel."
"Pours a cloudy light honey color with a two inch head that retains well. Aroma is very mild, faintly sour. Hops are mild as well, but a little sweet, like lemongrass. Malts are very light with a saltine cracker taste. Light body, even for a wheat, mouth feel ok but with a very high carbonation level. Overall nothing really stands out, but it's very drinkable and would be great on a hot summer day."
"Pours light copper with good head retention. Poor lacing. No noticiable aroma that I could pick up. Flavor is lacking, just not much going on here, other than a sour note at the end of it. Almost lemony sour. Mouthfeel is okay. Not a great example of this style, but not awful."
"Thin white head, opaque golden color with yeast clouds abundant. Smell clean with nice hop aroma. Taste is clean as well, and finishes very cleanly. A well balanced wheat with a nice hop touch. For an American Wheat, I like this beer. Good for warm weather."
"Coudy orange with yeast chunks at the bottom of the glass. Nice bubbley head that laces around the glass. Smells fruity with bread like malts. the body is light and crisp. Taste is an up front fruitiness from the yeast and hops. Cracker like malts and wheat balance out the tartness. Very refreshing! A great brew for warm weather!"
"Tap@North Coast. Lemony and tangy, wheaty, grainy malts, a bit short, American wheats never seem to work, and this is no exception. Just not a whole lot happening in here, not yeasty banana esters, just zingy hops and sweet, lightly wheaty, drinkable."
"I dont usually enjoy wheat beer. I typically equate them to ""drinking a breadstick"" but this one was a nice surprise. It had all the elements of a wheat beer but they were all relatively tame and no one element overpowered the others. Specifically, you could taste, the wheatiness, lemon, and hops but they were very manageable. There was a mild fruitiness in the aroma. I would tell hard core wheat beer drinkers to stay away. Everyone else should give it a try."
"Imagine your favorite hefeweizen, murky, golden/yellow, voluminous head, enticing to the eyes, now take away all the banana/clove scent that usually tickles the fancy of your nose, take away the fruity esters that make your palate so happy and you have this beer, all the promise of a hefe, missing all the reasons that you reach for it in the first place, I do not buy into this as being a separate style as in ""american wheat", it's just an inferior knock off"
"Like several other North Coast beers IÂ’ve now tried, it sets a good standard for the style. Nothing out of the ordinary (or better said, nothing strange or out of whack), but in this case thatÂ’s good, because everything good is in perfect balance here."
"Purchased in a bottle, pours a slightly hazy blond color with minimal head that quickly dissipates. The smell is not significant with a slight undetermined sweet background. The mouthfeel is comfortable with a slightly sweet wheat and carbonation throughout. The taste is the same slightly sweet wheat but overshadowed by the carbonation that dominates through to the aftertaste. The aftertaste has a sweetness overpowered by the carbonation that quickly disappears. Drinkability would be better if the carbonation was better balanced however I may be biased to cask ales, so I will consider that when I rate this."
"The beer pours a hazy/cloudy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice wheat malt scent with some subtle lemon zest. The taste is good good also. It has a dry wheat flavor with lemon zest It is light and refreshing with a bit of fruitiness. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking wheat beer. It has good flavor and aroma. It just is a little too carbonated."
"Another good offering from North Coast. This beer poured a hazy golden color with a huge frothy white head that left great ammounts of lace down my glass. The smell was quite lemon-y with slight grain in there too. The taste was good but did not grab my attention too much. It had a good lemon flavor with a decent ammount of malt and just a touch of bitterness from the hops but nothing that was really interesting. Although is is not the most interesting beer in the world, it is still highly drinkable and would be a great choice for a session beer."
"Interesting unfiltered look, this golden brew did not pour much of a head. Smell is wheaty with a slight hint of fruits. Taste is well...wheaty... with a dry hopped finish. Mouthfeel is a bit lively and cleansing of the palate. A very nice brew...recommended."
"Pale yellow doesn't always mean poor quality. Blue Star pours without much head, unlike its German cousins, but the nose promises a nice malt backbone. This American wheat beer has a mild, but pleasant and peppery hop profile with citrus hints and a playful yeastiness."
"1.5"" dancing, fizzy head. Then pocks and crust. A slightly hazy, dirty, dark yellow beer. Cloudy on last pour. Faint aroma of grains and sharp citrus. Front is spicy, fruity, peppery, dry. Middle is foamy, full, creamy, almost cheesy. Finish is a nice, fresh bitter; dry and somewhat toasty. This is pretty good for an American wheat."
"Cloudy, hazy yellow color, with a huge white frothy and foamy head that doesn't last long. This has citrus and wheat aromas, light wheaty, and very mild yeasty flavors with some lemon, light to medium in body, crisp and cabonated mouthfeel, has a nice clean and refreshing finish."
"Having been said, I love my monsters. Highly Recommended"
"Blue Star is better than expected. It would be a splendid session wheat, good to quaff in quantity when the mercury starts to rise."
"The taste was wheat, with a little citrus, yeast and spice. Not a vibrant beer, but a pleasant warm weather refresher."
"This beer pours a straw-like color with orange highlights. Nice fluffy white head. Smell is really bready and slightly citric. Taste brings me a wheat base flavor combined with other grain malts that creates a little more complexity than other American wheats. There a slight fruitiness in the background and a hoppy aspect that seems to meld perfectly with this beer. Yeast is noticeable in flavor and provides a spicy bready aspect along with an acidic dry finish. The body is light but light in a good way. I gotta say that this was an excellent American wheat. Great session beer for the summer time. Or one to have at a cookout for sure."
"This is definitely the best example of an ""American Wheat"" (Not to be confused with a Bavarian weizen, much to the chagrin of several previous reviewers) that I have drank up to this point. An exceptionally well-balanced and piquant brew, refreshing, well-crafted, easy to drink, very clean...everything a well-made American Wheat should be. I would urge people to seek this out. Definitely a summer session brew"
"Got this as part of a North Coast sampler case which I know was on the shelf for at least a couple of months... shouldn't be an issue overall. I haven't had a wheat beer (hefe, weiss or wit) in years and definitely not since I joined BA. Man, I'm looking forward to the coming months to see what the world has to offer in these styles, but this was pretty lackluster. I found the color pale and a little cloudy, the smell was of lemon zest and a little bananna. No real spicey kick to speak of and overall the taste was watery.... I mean, at times it was like drinking lemonade. There was just enough scent and taste of the style of a wheat beer to make me want to hunt down the great versions, but this was lacking. I could probably drink a case of this and still be wanting more... of something else. I do love North Coast but this was just too bland."
"Nice tart beer, but not too tart."
"Blue Star Great American Wheat Beer: in a stubby brown bottle. Yellow/gold brew that is extremely hazy. Virtually no head, and what there was left no Belgian lace. The aroma is clean and lemon orange. Taste, not much to write home about, very fruity, but not much of that yeasty/banana/clove/wheat beer taste that I had been hoping for. Tart, a little sour and lemon bitter, not hop bitter. Long lasting citrus aftertaste. Fairly well made, but unless you like a lemon-y brew, I would not bother with this one."
"I was a little disappointed with the looks of this beer. There was virtually no head to this whatsoever. The smell and taste were nothing better than average. There was a taste of bananas and honey and it had a soft buttery texture. Normally I dont care too much for wheat beers, but I love when one blows me away...this one however did not. I have had just about everything from North Coast and this one was not up there with there other brews."
"Cloudy, golden amber with a nice white head that settles slowly. Great so far.... Smell is sweet and fruity, with a wheat base and a citric yeast. Woah, the taste is very citric. Some lemon, tangerine, and orange. Not too bad, but not very complex. Unique, and good in its own way, but not great. Also, it seems to bne weakly carbonated."
"Poured a cloudy, yellowy gold color with a vigorous beige head that dissipated rather quickly. Aromas of yeast, wheat and malt, and a slight fruitiness. Kind of lackluster; with an aroma in there I can't quite place, but it seems like it doesn't belong. Tastes rather thin, in body and taste. Has wheat ale qualities, but does not stand up to other US counterparts. Not really impressed."
"Taste: soft, smooth, mellow, easily consumed. Happily greets the tongue, and floods it with delcious citric flavor, washed it with tasty yeast and spice. Medium bodied, rather uncomplicated, but tasty, tasty, tasty. This did the trick as the beer for when you just need a beer right now, not one to settle back and savor."
"Drinkability Â– The Blue Star was a struggle to get down."
"Decent enogh but nothing calls out to me and says ""Zap...come have me""...I don't think I would buy this again, although like I said it is a solid enough American Wheat.."
"Light gold color, slightly cloudy, medium head. A medium bodied wheat beer. Mild malts and hops. Nice flavor, citrus (lemony) and dry malts. Wheat beer yet nice malts and slightly bitter hops. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet and lemony, yet there is some hop bitterness."
"Appears a pale hazy orange golden hue with a vibrantly white foaming head leaving trickled lace as it dwindles down slowly. Aroma: Doesn't have the characteristic yeast notes of the banana clove combo but it is filled with a bouquet of spices and different tones and an underlying citrus tone that blends well with the sharp sweetness of the wheat malt just ties it all together. Taste is a wonderful mix of yeasty mustiness, sharp sweet malted wheat, a mild huskiness to it and definite hops seems a bit medicinal but in a good way if that makes sense. Mouthfeel: Although no chewy there's still a great deal of texture spurred by the healthy amount of carbonation this one goes down as one of the better American wheat beers I have come across. Drinkability: Refreshing perfect for the style for the summertime, I must say. Good overall shot at making a wheat beer every North Coast brew I've tried has been remarkable in their own way, while this one may not compare to Red Seal, Old No. 38, Scrimshaw, or Old Rasputin it really hits the spot. Very solid mild flavors refreshing quality but in the end it hits a tender spot in my heart."
"Hazy orange tinted golden. Nice size fluffy white head with good retention. Light nose of wheat, lemmon pepper and freshly cut grass. Highly carbonated almost ""stinging"" mouthfeel. There's a tangy lemon-like taste in this beer. Some peppery spiciness. And a little bitterness. Not overly tasty, but decent enough to quaff a few if the situation presented itself."
"Decent."
"Apricot color, hazy with nice dark yeasties floating around as well. Solid 1/4 inch head after a minute. Good thick lacing. Lightly lemony aroma, some sense of zest, not overly yeasty. Flavor is well done, cottony and rich mouthfeel and a nice thick but not pronounced elements of restrained nutmeg and the barest banana ester. A little sweet grape jelly. Some wheat beers strike it extremly well with me, others fall out in emphasizing one element too much, some have few defining characteristics at all. This is a good middle-of-the-road entry that has the potential to strike it positive with a variety of beer drinkers."
"Wheat beers are one of my favorite styles of beer and unfortunately this one was a big disappointment in my opinion.It was flat, thin and nothing special stood out with this beer.It had a small white head with fine-small sized bubbles that quickly diminished.The body was carbonated and slightly cloudy.The hue was pale yellow and there was very little lacing.The nose was that of bananas, some clove and some hops.The flavor was flat and somewhat sweet tasting.The mouthfeel was smooth, thin, watery and light bodied."
"($6.99 / 6-pack)"
"I was expecting alot from this beer, since I have enjoyed many other brews from North Coast, however I was somewhat let down by Blue Star. It poured a pale golden color with a nice thick head, and the bottle had a large amount of yeast in it, however the smells of the beer while pouring were very bland. The flavor of the beer is very dry, not any overwhelming flavors. Not bad as far as American wheat beers go, but not great. Not something i would go out of my way to buy again."
"This beer poured a hazy pale yellow. It looks perfect and looks like a nice cloudy Hefe. Fruity aroma, with some banana and spices coming through. The taste is delicious, not overly sweet, although there is a nice malty body there. Very drinkable and a great American Hefe-weizen, just not as flavorful as some German versions IÂ’ve had. This is a great warm weather/summer beer."
"This wheat beer poured a straw or light brown color, with a decent head and retention. Some half-expected, but still slightly peculiar floating cloudiness was apparent when held to the light. The smell hinted of cloves and was very full and pleasant. The taste was exceptionally mild, fairly sweet but nicely balanced by some hop bitterness. The lighter body and reduced carbonation also contributed to this beer's good mouthfeel and overall drinkability. The Blue Star Wheat was simple, pleasantly mild and a real thirst quencher. Recommended for the beginning wheat-style explorer, and for all lawn warriors who need refueling on those hot summer days."
"This wheat syle ale had a different feel than most wheats. Hints of apricot slide down the throat that leave a nice taste leftover on the tongue. It pours a light yellow color with minimal head. Not my favorite of the wheats, but surely a solid beer."
"Average head, but it goes away too quickly. The beer is not completely transparent. A golden yellow color. As far smell: not much going on here. Some spices, but I can't even put my finger on which ones. Tastes only slightly above average. Very light... creamy for a wheat. not very crisp or refreshing. feels pretty good on the palate, though. Very drinkable."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom, short twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"This isn't a beer or a style that I get really excited about. But it would be a good beer to introduce beer newbies into the world of wheat."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a creamy white head that fades into a nice amount of lace. Nose is fresh wheat and yeast with a touch of floral hops. Taste is dominated by sweet grains and wheat with additional notes of yeast and a touch of fruit. Mildly bitter hops and an acidic citrus bite come through in the end leaving a very dry finish. A nice crisp and refreshing American wheat beer. The highlight of this beer is the big blue star on the front of the label as the blue star is an emblem that is holy to me. Now, if only theyÂ’d change the yellow background to silver and whiteÂ…"
"Very much the American variety of wheat beer - clean fermentation with little flavors produced by the yeast. In the case of this beer, the virtue was taken a little far - the flavor profile was a little too barren - clean to a fault. Pleasant and refreshing, but not much to add character."
"Picked up at Hollingshead Deli in Orange, CA. Dark yellow with a thin white head. Aroma is mildly hoppy. Very light and crisp flavor of hops and fruit. Finish is a little hoppy, a little yeasty. Not bad for the style but give me an Old Rasputin over this any day."
"Traditional cloudy straw-like appearance,aroma was floral and wheat beer-like.Kind of a weak body,a little thin does have some apple tinge in flavor to it.I pretty drinkable but not to comples,have had much better,not something I would probably recommend."
"The beer pours a pleasant if somewhat light Â“Chill HazedÂ” golden yellow color with the head bright white, modest in size and frothy in its texture, as it decays, it leaves behind a fine sheet of lace to coat the glass. Light hints of the wheat, citrus crisp, clean and a pleasant enough nose, the start being sweet, nicely malted, the top middling in feel. Finish has a biting acidity, the hops apropos to the style, and the aftertaste quite dry and long lasting. Average comes to mind when I describe this beer, drinkable and pleasant enough overall."
"True to the style, it's hazy gold with a big white head. It's quite effervescent, and little bubbles make their way to the top until the bottom of the glass. The smell is slightly lacking, with some citrus smell and just a hint of spice. I didn't detect any of the banana smell or taste usually found in wheat beer. The taste is by no means overwhelming, but it is very pleasant, with notes of lemon or grapefruit and just a bit of spice. It's very refreshing and makes a good outdoor drink on a warm day. Another winner from North Coast."
"Generally, I am not the biggest fan of wheat beers.  However, this is one that I would gladly drink again.  It is not as wheaty as many that I have tried in the past, which is probably its appeal to me.  It is smooth and pretty clean.  It drinks well and does not leave any heavy taste on the palate.  Prost!"
"Blue Star is the best American Wheat beer that I've tasted from California in a bottle, up until now. It is unfiltered with a citrus flavor. Nice wheat haze in color, light golden, aromatic and very delicious in the after taste. But there is a bitterness that does not help this beer. Not as good as first thought!"
"Cloudy, golden with an orange tint. The bright white head falls fairly quickly for the style however, leaving just a whispy covering across the surface and a limited collar. The aroma is nicely fruity with some background malt. The body is light with a spritzy carbonation, giving a tingle in the mouth and a thin, somewhat watery mouthfeel. The flavor is well balanced between light, sweet wheat flavor & a lightly tart yeasty note, and limited bitterness. Finishes quickly with just a reminder of the light tart quality and some drying grain. Quite enjoyable and refreshing. A perfect summer quencher with a delicate but enjoyable character."
"This brew is on the mediocre side once it's past your eyes. Faint citrus hop aroma with bits of grain and fruit. Thin body holds a minimal malt spine and finishes like a green apple and hop tea. Certainly not one of the best American wheats I've tried, and considering the price, I won't be trying again."
"This beer poured a cloudy straw color and formed a nice white head that left some lace.  The aroma was of hops and wheat.  The flavor was of hops and lightly of citrus with elements of yeast.  The yeast gave it a slightly breadlike finish.  Not a bad wheat beer."
"Was a very cloudy straw color after I poured in the yeast at the bottom of the bottle.  Nice white head that left little lace. Good wheat taste, smooth and very drinkable.  Went down well with dinner on this miserably hot evening.  Wheat beer is not my favorite style but this is a good one, it dosen't buzz you right away. North Coast puts out good brew."
"Pours ahazy light straw, almost the color of grapefruit juice, with no head to speak of.  The smell is very fruity.yeasty with nice banana and juicy fruit qualities.  Crisp taste that starts off very yeasty and fruity and is then complimented by the wheat flavors.  Crisp and creamy and very drinkable.  A very nice american wheat.  Yet another good offering from North Coast."
"Notes: A very refreshingly crisp brew, flavours are delicate and extremely enjoyable. A great American Wheat to be had here."
