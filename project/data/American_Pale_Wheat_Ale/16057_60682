The lack of pineapple on the palate was a missed opportunity and overall this beer did very little for me. I think the explanation for this lies in my expectation of a beer which would have fruity and wheaty characteristics. If you go into it expecting a slightly wheaty lager with pineapple in the nose you might not be as disappointed. Forgettable yet drinkable.","abeeronthebeach","Beers"

I don't know what that's about, but I want to say it has something to do with pineapple. Overall, it is pretty drinkable, but there is something about it that seems muted.

When I found out that MBC made a wheat ale with Maui Gold, I had to jump on it! I thought this one had a great balance between the Maui Gold and the wheat. Maui Gold is very sweet and has very low acidity to it, so I figured it would be a bit over powering, but they did a good job, not letting that happen. It's a great beer for the hot weather down here, I just wish I didn't have to bring it from Cali or Hawai'i, when I visit.","JISurfer","Jun 15, 2012"

It's a little bit slick with sugar and gluten but overall quite refreshing, and unlike a lot of wheat beers, it's not overly gassy.

4.3,22.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Bottom line, I could drink this refreshing brew as a castaway. But as I write this review, I'm reminded that the price, at least for a Coloradon, could really only be afforded by Thurston Howell III. However, I would gladly pay it!!!","Kjendahl","Dec 13, 2010"
3.45,-1.4,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Drinkability: Very refreshing, especially in Maui, but this really did not seem all that different from other American Wheats. Some reviews mention too much pineapple, others (like mine) mention just the barest touch. Consistency issues? Regardless, it was still quite enjoyable and refreshing.","bsp77","Nov 30, 2010"

2.4,-31.4,5,2.5,2,4,1.5,"Who put pineapple in my hefe??? Ok, so I clearly knew there was gonna be pineapple in this, and that's why I wanted to try it. The pineapple, however, completely overshadows everything else in this beer. Couldn't drink more than one.","billshmeinke","Oct 30, 2010"
3.4,-2.9,3,3,3.5,4,3.5,"D- Overall this is a decent wheat beer but not quite as good as I had hoped.","projectflam86","Oct 24, 2010"
3.65,4.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Clouded orange golden body with a nice large bubbled white head, fine lacing spread across the glass. Aroma has a nice citrus flow to it with hints of tart pineapple around the edges. This is a pretty cool concept nice base wheat beer with Maui Gold pineapples. Flavors bring a nice fruity roll between tropical fruit/citrus blend with wheat beer base coming through. Phenolic mildly spiced character works well together. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied even soft carbonation nothing off here. Drinkability overall it's nice to have some pineapple burps rather than the typical hop burp, nice experience works well.","WVbeergeek","Oct 20, 2010"
3.98,13.7,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Overall, very drinkable. Interesting. Due to ABV and refreshing taste you can definitely have a few of these.","atigerlife","Oct 13, 2010"
3.25,-7.1,3.5,3.5,3,4,3,"An interesting beer, but the advertised component blew away most of the other attributes which could have made this better.","xnicknj","Beers"
3.87,10.6,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Poured a dark yellow into Steinlager glass. The smell of pineapples are definitely there. Taste of a wheat ale with pineapples. Good mouthfeel. It has a refreshing taste to it. Good drinkability. Pineapple juice with a bite!","Westsidebuddha","0"
3.88,10.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is very interesting. In addition to wheat, I get a lot of smoke. Very odd. The flavor is a mix of smoke, wheat and some citrus fruit - possibly pineapple or mangoes. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.","Mora2000","Sep 30, 2010"
3.92,12,3.5,4,4,2.5,4.5,"A wheat beer with pineapple, perfect after a long day of surfing!","pixieskid","Sep 19, 2010"
3.98,13.7,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Very nice wheat ale with some interesting flavors. Nice fruitiness, but the medicinal flavor is a bit off-putting at first. Once it dies down a bit, this is good stuff. Overall, very nice.","geryeb624","Sep 09, 2010"
3.63,3.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Light, refreshing and easy drinking. No overwheliming flavors. A nice wheat ale from the isles. I wish I were there drinking this!","BlackBearForge","Sep 05, 2010"
3.18,-9.1,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"D: I was disappointed by this one. Perhaps it's a beer that fairs better being freshly kegged, because it was nothing like what I remember having.","womencantsail","Aug 31, 2010"
3.31,-5.4,2,3.5,3,3.5,4,"Beer is light in body and has a clean finish. Its OK, no real pineapple flavor, kind of thin and flat. Its not a great wheat beer, just another novelty.","drabmuh","Aug 29, 2010"
3.82,9.1,3,3.5,4,4,4,"M/D - Mouthfeel is thin and light but not watery (an improvement over most of this style). Very drinkable beer that I could easily see a sixer being killed by accident just going one after the other.","mwa423","Aug 28, 2010"
3.61,3.1,2,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"An approachable summer beer - good for a picnic or pool party - but not too impressive on its own.","augustgarage","Aug 22, 2010"
4,14.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Appearance is a nice cloudy orange, clearly unfiltered, just the way I like it. Smells of wheat and pineapple, strong on both and nothing else distinctive. Taste is the same as smell, a nice unfiltered wheat taste with moderate to strong carbonation and a nice pineapple flavor. Very drinkable, and very impressed. I would definitely order this beer again.","grannun","Aug 21, 2010"
3.53,0.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Stopped by at one of my favorite beer stores and discovered they had the new mana wheat in by Maui brewing! Picked up a sixer and went to a friends house to share it with her. It pours a really golden color mixed with a little orange in it. The beer is hazy, but not to dense. The smell was what you would expect from a wheat beer with the little exception of pineapples, yep, pineapples. The taste was yeasty, but the acidity of the pineapples really balanced out the flavor quite well. It was going down nice and smooth on a hot Hawaiian day!!!","Kala1073","Aug 19, 2010"
3.02,-13.7,2.5,3,3,3.5,3,"D: Certainly not difficult to drink, but the smoke on the nose is a negative, and it's not really good enough to want more than one.","Xul","Aug 15, 2010"

3.48,-0.6,2,4,3.5,3,3.5,"D: A solid wheat beer, I liked how the hefe and pineapple came together, but not a beer I'd rush out and by again.","Halcyondays","Beers"
