"nice taste...light, with lemon notes...slightly creamy as well!"
"Tasty summer beer, really refreshing"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light, wheat smell with hints of lemon.  Smooth taste with grapefruit flavors."
"Light taste, refreshing, a little tart"
""
""
""
""
"Pale color, pale flavor. Really, very easy to drink but not anything to call home about"
""
""
""
"Had at smokey bones"
""
""
""
""
""
"Also: hella foamy."
""
"One of my standards that I keep around. Just a good beer that doesn't disappoint. Pretty smooth with a nice aroma."
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like a classy Budweiser."
"This wheat ale is not particularly memorable or remarkable in any way. It's actually the weakest of all of Goose Islands products that I have tried so far. Not to say it's bad, but their beers are usually very good. Ok, whatever beer here"
""
"O- Solid beer, not as flavourful as say, Gumball Head; for what it is, its a solid beer with a nice mouthfeel and decent flavour to it. And it's cheap to boot."
"Hazy straw color with a small white head. Smells like wheat malt with hints of lemon, but the scent is very faint. Very mild malt taste with some lemon flavor. Has a typical wheat beer mouth feel. Overall I feel like this beer left a bit to be desired in the taste department. I feel like a lemon wedge would have benefited this beer a great deal."
""
""
"Pours a slightly dark straw color. Interesting aroma, a blend of earthy tones and some malt. Taste is wheaty, spicy and some elements of mineral water. An easy drinking light and crisp feel. Not a bad brew but a tad on the bland side."
""
""
""
"I like this beer a lot."
""
"Hazy, tart, and crisp. Refreshing wheat ale."
"312 is my go to domestic!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Easy Drinking, light and pleasant enough, just not a lot of flavor. I think I could pound these all night, no problem."
"Had this beer for Sunday lunch. On tap bar Louis  in Denver. I enjoyed it. Refreshing and easy drinking."
""
""
"This is average in every sense of the word."
""
""
""
"Overall: If I was blind-tasting this, I'd be able to guess it's an AB product. It's probably mind-blowing for people used to drinking Bud Light, but I'll be honest, I almost would rather drink a Bud Light because it's easier to swallow. I had to drain pour this, and I hate drain pouring beers."
"Meh. Just another low abv bland wheat"

"Overall, and to be honest, this is their “lowest common denominator” offering.  This is not meant to be a jab, but rather just to explain how this is clearly their beer to sway craft fringers, in recognition of the fact that many, many beer drinkers still reach for BMC.  The thing drinks light enough like one, and the flavor profile is crisp and equally as comparable.  You get just a little more sweetness, and a bit more of that savory metallic quality from the wheat.  Actually, as the beer warms, you get this curious zesty lemon flavoring that is part yeast and part citric inclusion.  Otherwise, you shouldn’t expect much else different from your typical American adjunct lager, despite the differently labeled style on the side of the bottle."
""
""
"O-  not the best american wheat I've had, but certainly not the worst.  Another ""Gateway beer"" offering from Goose Island.  My friends who are not into craft beer would certainly drink this."
"My go to beer good taste."
""
"After living in Germany for four years and drinking a lot of wheat beers I was slightly disappointed in this one.  I guess they call it a ""pale"" American Wheat beer for a reason.  It just didn't have the strong wheat taste I've come to expect in a wheat beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smooth taste for a wheat ale and no after taste..."
""
""
"very flat taste, from the the very touch of your tongue till the finish...just flat"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Absolutely delicious light wheat beer."
""
""
""
""
"Fruity taste, yet smooth. Fun beer."
"For my pallet, a superb choice"
""
""
"It is a decent beer for the price and goes well with many different meals. I always keep a few in my fridge for after class. I consider this my Bud Light replacement as my taste buds matured."

"Not very aromatic but a nice beer for bowling!"
"i would drink it again"
""
""
"After one sip, this beer became a favorite!"
"Almost like a less in your face witbier. Doesn't have the orangyness like a bluemoon, but definitely a nice smooth easy to drink wheat beer. Would love to try again."
""
"It's a very good American Wheat Ale."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Honestly, it's better than I expected after reading the other reviews. When it comes to wheat I've only had this and Blue Moon and prefer this over Blue Moon."
""
""
"this beer is terrible.. i rather get Iced"
""
""
""

"This is a hazy golden beer.  The head is slim and soapy.  Smell of mild wheat, a hint of twang and some yeast.  Grain and some citrus.  This is an everyday, average wheat...nothing special."
"The result is a taste I would only accept if I were a sixteen year old desperate to get drunk. The taste is bold, enormous and overwhelming, just like ""city lights on beer Michigan", and has a bitter, long lasting aftertaste. It makes me want to stop drinking beer. Avoid at all costs."
""
""
""
""
"O – This is THE first Goose Island beer I tried after moving to Chicago in 2004.  I even called it “three-twelve” instead of the correct colloquial version of “three-one-two” (after the Chicago area code).  But I digress.  It had been a few years since I’d tried it, and I was pleasantly reminded of what a great everyday, sessionable beer this really is.  Very pleased to try it again and enjoy it so much."
""
"i love chicago, this beer is pretty dece"
""
"Great beer from a great city"
"Great wheat beer, nice smooth finish without the bitter finish like most other wheat. Very goos beer"

"Pretty good wheat beer that doesn't stand out from the crowd, but doesn't suck, either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very light! Could drink a bunch! Wouldn't buy a 12 but a pint at a bar!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Goose Island has been a bit hit and miss for me, but this is an absolute bullseye. Don't try and compare it to a Belgian or German wheat beer because this is a totally different animal - an American spin on weissbier? Who cares - it's pretty damned good and I could quite imagine myself revisiting this again. And again. Two thumbs up."

"Poured into wheat glass. Very light yellow half finger head disappearing. Good lacing. Smell is lemony a little yeast but super subtle. Taste is light but not crazy light. A lot of carbonation. Lemony. Hops, yeast almost like a euro lager such as becks or st pauli. I liked this a lot"
"Overall a good beer, not quite as heavy as some other wheat beers and with a much crisper taste. Not as thick feeling, and the citrus tones are down some from other witbiers."

"worst thing goose island makes which is saying something because none of it is very good anyway"
""
""
"Taste, colour not bad as such. But tastes very light which presumable is due to the low alcohol content being only 4,2% for this beer. A wheat beer should have minimum 5% in order to be full bodied. Increase alcohol content, and this will be a great beer."

"Pours a beautiful light gold, fairly clear. Head is plenty as is with most wheats. Lacing is minimal. Aroma is sweet, candy-like with hints of grain. Taste is of yeast, sweetness and a light ending of bitter, very light. Overall a good wheat, slightly sweeter than most I have had. Feels good and slick on the palate. A very very light wheat.."

"If it is above 85 degrees outside, this is a decent session beer.  Otherwise, average."
"Overall-  Just a simple beer, but its definitely got its place for me whether it'd be for a cookout or quick afternoon beer to go with lunch.   At 4.2% abv its a good session beer that I'd imagine could convert alot of budwesier drinkers (a little cannabalistic for inbev, but I really don't care).  When I need something light or for session purposes this is a solid bet that I'd gladly revisit."

"Pours a hazy yellowish-brown. Aroma is very muted, with a slight wheat aroma. Taste was similarly muted, slightly bitter, but not unpleasant. Wheat, bread and a little lemony flavor, with a bit of a bitter finish that lingered too long. Very thin mouthfeel, not overly carb'd. Overall, not one of the better representation of the styles, but not a bad beer at all."

"Overall (3.12 - just like its name) : To make lemonade out of lemons, I'm glad it wasn't another beer that got spilled. So I guess that's my roundabout way of saying that it isn't the best beer that's graced my lips. It ain't half bad but I've sure had better wheat beers. I haven't had anything from Goose Island yet that has overly impressed me, so I guess we'll see what else they have to offer. Still pissed that I spilt my beer."
""
""

"Serviceable, but there are inch better wheats out there. Dry. A bit bland at the finish."

"Its a good clean beer, way better on draft than out of a bottle (like usual)"
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Just about passable, but not something I’d go out of my way to have again.  Perhaps I didn’t get a fresh bottle? (The sediment makes me wonder…).  Either way, this is a style that I just have not had a lot of luck with."

"Thirst-quenching but uneventful - an average wheat beer. Looks alright, while the aroma and flavour are dominated by dry yeast and wheat notes with faint hop undertones. Body is OK if a tad light. Goes down easily enough; would be nice on a hot day. Nothing to write home about though - no need to hunt it down."

"Overall: Innocuous and pleasant while airborne. Unlikely to seek out while on the ground, but happy to choose given limited options."
""
"The taste is excellent. Light as you would expect from a wheat beer, with greater depth from the malt, hops, and citrus. It comes just to the line of crossing over into being too ""hoppy"". I'm definitely a fan of this brewery now, having tried a few of their other offerings and this beer in particular. I know a beer is good when I'm surprised out how quickly I'm emptying a glass."

"07-27-2011 Tried on tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Nice. Creamy & crisp w/some body. Sounds like a contradiction but isn't."

"I now have a fridge full of this, the pale and the wimpy IPA from 312. Fortunately there is other stuff in there too, but these are pretty decent beers for the afternoon of yard work I am putting off to write this review."
""
""
""
""
"312 Urban Wheat brewed by Goose Island Beer Co. This brew pours out a cloudy amber color with a small white head. This is an unfiltered brew like most wheat beers. Keep in mind, this brew has an abv of 4.2. The smell is citrus and beer. This brew has the smell of most wheat brews on the market. The taste is bitter at first but smooth at the end. I like how it is different from most wheat brews on the market. 312 Urban Wheat is a clean and fresh and smooth brew. The mouthfeel is is nice at the end. There is nothing bad about this brew. Overall I giving this brew a 4 out 5 I feel this is a good wheat brew to try out. I would get get this brew again."
""
""
""
"BOD 11/23/13. Fairly clear light golden pour with a good head. Well formed lacing and moderate retention. Light nose of lemon with a hint of banana over a touch of clove against a light biscuit sweetness. Light medium body that is smooth. Normal carbonation level with good effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is laid back and a bit weak. Some light tart lemon flavor is predominant with only hints of clove. The finish is clean and somewhat crisp."
""
"On-tap at the local BWW. Pours a semi-cloudy golden yellow color with a slight bubbly white head. The aroma is weak with grains, wheat, and citrus. The taste is smooth, with a mild grassy grain taste. Not a bad lighter craft brew but really lacks depth in the taste."

"Pours a hazy straw-yellow with a 1-finger fizzy white head that has some spotty lacing when sipped. The aroma is of sweet malt and wheat. Very nice. Taste was very pleasant with just the right amount of carbonation and just like a good wheat ale should taste. Also has a hint of light lemon and orange . Very easy to drink! I would get this one again."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Picked this one up along with the 312 pale ale in a mixed six because I tend to like Goose Island beers. Not a great looking wheat, way to pretty and clean with little head. Decent smell but nothing that jumps up and grabs you. But very tasty, excellent wheat flavor that surprised. Clean and crisp with smooth finish. Had to ding it a little overall for low ABV. This is one I would definitely look to get again and considerably better than the 312 pale."
"Overall: Good brew. It would be nice on a hot summer day while grillin'."

"Overall: Goose Island does a great job with this beer. Very nice crisp and clean beer. Great beer at this time of the year. Enjoyable in every sense and I would recommend."

"Overall this one is very drinkable, tasty and not too heavy. I really like it and look forward to drinking more. I see this as a great companion beer to spicy foods like Super hot wings and real boiled crawfish that are not made for tourist."
""
"Rating as an American Wheat it's well above average. From the 12 oz can purchased at Special Brews in Lynnwood, Washington."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer was similar to the 312 Urban Ale I had the same night, but I slightly preferred the Urban Wheat, since at least this beer had ~some~ flavor. And that flavor is: wheat (no surprise there). Not an incredibly complex or challenging beer, but the wheat flavor is fairly strong here, which adds a nice sweetness to the beer and brings to mind sitting on lawns in the summer (in my mind at least). Moderate hops and carbonation. Because this beer has a fairly strong wheat flavor, its a little more of a slow-drinking beer than the Urban Ale, but you'll pay more attention to it."

"Ordered a torpedo keg of this for our kegerator. This was one of my transition beers into the craft world so I'm pretty high on it. Cloudy yellow appearance with a white head. Flavor is good, wheat, slight metallic flavor, and lingering yeast. It keeps me coming back for more though. The flavor is good enough and the drinkability is amazing, less calories than a Budweiser. Awesome go to light beer and one that anyone new to craft should try!"

"The beer is quite refreshing, easy drinking, and would make a great session beer during warm weather or simply as a nice break from heavier beers. The subtle lemon flavor, light body, and low ABV is reminiscent of a shandy. While I'm sure there are higher quality examples of this particular style, this is very drinkable and worth the price I paid for the sixer (I think it was about 6.99)."

"312 has a lot of flavor for a lighter beer. This is one of my go-to beers, especially if I need to entertain and have beer that I know most will like. In my experience it goes well with chicken and fish, or after a long day of work. If you haven't tried it I strongly recommend that you do."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Frothy head, maintaining effervescence and fair lacing. Nose is light and citrusy. Light and wheaty flavor accentuated with a bit of lemon citrus. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
""
"Better than all the BMC products but still disappointing. There's a mild orange flavor that is pleasant. Mouthfeel is a little chalky and unpleasant."
"O: First part of the GI tasting and you've got to start someplace. Not something I'd revisit."

"This is a wheat ale for people who like light beers. It is very clear compared to other wheat ales, and it also feels light in your mouth. This beer tastes smooth with a little after taste, but I feel this beer is missing some flavor like fruits, spices, or anything other than light beer flavor."

"O- Overall Its an overpriced generic beer that claims to be craft. I don't deny that its quite drinkable, almost enjoyable. Its just not worth $8.50 a six pack."
""
""
"O- A very refreshing beer that would be perfect on a summers day. A much more interesting alternative to a traditional Belgium style wheat beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not too much on the nose. Hints of yeasty white bread and malts. As the beer warmed up the hops made their presence known much to my delight. Taste matches the smell. Clean. Simple. Easy drinker for a hot summer afternoon. I am not usually a big wheat beer fan but this is one I would be happy to have handed to me as a refresher after mowing the lawn."
""
""
""
""
"O=Enjoyable at times, and I could see it being rather refreshing in the summer, but not enjoyable. I may try this beer again in the summer if I find it on tap, but I would not buy a six-pack based on this sample."
""
""
""
""
" easy & fast :) Very slight hops at 1st but not discernible after drinking a few of then. would go great with shellfish like raw oysters and clams. Most goose island beers are drinkable but not outstanding or particularly memorable but most are enjoyable. Most of my local deli's mcarry a good variety of Goose Island beer so when I can't get to my regular supply of great craft beer these do the trick."

"Pours a golden color with thin foaming. I get a light wheaten aroma, with a hint of coriander and some citrus. It’s smooth and easy drinking, without anything that stands out. Struck me as pretty run of the mill."

""

"O: I like this beer an find it refreshing and easy to drink. It finishes slightly bitter and with a little too much lemon aftertaste. That lemon taste really makes it hard to enjoy the second one. The first one is very good and then hard to finish the second."

""

"A weak, unassuming beer. Taste-wise, it comes across more like a decent (yet unexciting) American adjunct lager. Despite some decent carbonation, the head wouldn't stick around, but otherwise an okay looking beer. Not really a good example of a wheat-based beer; it lacks some of the smooth graininess I would look for. Nope, nothing to get wrapped around the axle with here. Drinkable yet wholly forgettable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"doey, yeasty smell. pleasant appearance with a nice head, crisp clear body. Thicker mouth feel for a wheat beer. Full tongue heavy taste for wheat beer with a slightly dry finish. Reminds me of dough going down, not all that pleasant. sort. of a wash of yeast flavor for me. Not very many other deep or well rounded flavors. disclaimer not much of a yeast flavor fan. I hate vegamite. Not a poor drink, but less than OK."

"The taste was crisp and clean with a wheat bread maltiness and a bit of piney hops. Very easy and sessionable but not substantial, this beer nicely pairs with spicy foods, as a quencher but not built for craft beer enthusiasts."
""
""
""
"Just too light of a beer. Well carbonated, decent head and lacing, murky yellow against the light, and the taste is a little lemony, tastes like a light lager. Definitely not one of those overspiced american wheats you see all the time. Nothing special, wouldnt seek this out again."

"I'm a big wheat beer guy in the summer, but this one didn't do it for me. The were citrus notes, but it was largely watery and a bit boring. R color was hazy, but not too hazy and belied the mild flavor. The smell was wheat, not a ton of the citrus or malt. Couldn't get there."

"This a simple beer, one without a bold or complex flavor profile but one that seems to work better than your average wheat ale. On the nose I only pick up wheat and grass, but when drinking I taste a relatively significant hop presence for a wheat ale, grass, and light citrus flavors. The beer is fairly thin but has enough substance to avoid tasting like a Bud Light, and the carbonation is just active enough. Overall, I can't say I'll be looking for this again, as it's not that interesting. However, this would make a good session beer and is overall pretty solid as a summer ale as its fresh, easy to drink, and refreshing."

"O- I really enjoyed This beer light and crisp not intense by any means"
"Tastes like regular Bud with some wheat aspects. Easy drinking low abv summer beer."
""
""
""

"O- This is a solid wheat beer. They weren't trying to do anything fancy with it. There aren't any frills. But it's a good, easy drinking summer beer, and one I have been having as long as I have been drinking beer. The can makes it even better for summer."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Beautiful, light to medium bodied with creamy finish; and moderate carbonation. Great summer feel."
""
""
""
" The flavor is as light as the feel with some mild maltiness which comes off as slightly wheat in the sweet quality of grain with some mild pilsner toastiness perhaps with some mild hop flavor which adds to the low spice accent in the back, very clean in general with mild yeast fruitiness. Overall this is a refreshing beer and a good wheat for summer refreshment, it is not bad in any way. I can see how some may be turned off by its simplicity or low abv, but to me that is what a pale wheat is designed for -this is a good example of that style."

"The body was a bit thinner than I would have liked, but was clean and had a medium dry finish. Drinkability was good, the beer went down quickly and easily. Overall, not a terrible beer by any means, but not one really worth the time, even for for a hot weather quaff. Try it or don't, whatevs."
""

"Well, it's good. But I probably wouldn't drink any more than two in one sitting unlike other wheat ales that I've had in the past. It definitely has an appeal, but it's just not quite my cup of tea...er--beer. Yeah, that's what I meant to say. Anyway, it's worth a try."

"Goose Island 312 Urban Wheat has a thick, rumply head and a very bubbly, hazy, yellow-golden appearance, with thick lacing left on the glass. The aroma is of stinging white bread, a touch of lemon, and a lot of tap water. Flavor is of the same, with a subdued bitterness, underneath. Mouthfeel is soft and medium, and Goose Island 312 Urban Wheat finishes dry, refreshing, and very drinkable. Overall, this is a good beer. RJT"

"This beer is certainly no classic and is not a perfect example of its style, but I like what it does offer and it is more than good enough to recommend. It’s a nice way to cool off and its lighter body and lower alcohol level make it a safer beer for everyday consumption."

"a rather generic wheat beer, although plenty refreshing in the summer, and very crisp with a light citrusy profile. its cloudy on the pour, but only mildly so, not too much sediment floating around or anything, and a fluffy white head over an inch tall, but it doesn't last real long. plenty of white wheat malt happening, light herbal notes of coriander and a seemingly authentic german hefe yeast. It does smell a little funky in the finish, a slight off flavor, lets see what it tastes like. relatively clean and refreshing, lemons are prevalent, as is the nice yeast, but it seems a little overdone, like a little more than necessary in terms of yeast. just a touch of pepper in there as well, and its a little more filling that I wish it was. as a down easy beer at a wedding, it seemed just slightly off the mark. it also doesn't taste a whole lot different than their summertime ale, which just seemed strange to me. is goose island going down the tubes? maybe too early to tell, but don't hate this."

"Date tasted: June 19, 2013... Glassware: pilsner glass... Occasion: NBA Finals Game 7--it better be fantastic for the Spurs!... Appearance: golden body with enough effervescence to steady a massive off-white head that fills the 22 oz. glass; laces to a misty top... Aroma: citric refreshment with Cascade and lemony zest; fresh and appropriate for a fan-cooled evening... Palate: soft yet active at the throat; enough substance to be considered between sips--refreshing and drinkable... Taste: not as much taste as the aroma suggests; lemony fizz and some undergirding hops... Overall: Lucky enough to have had this on tap a week ago in Chicago; this bottle is similar in mouthfeel and sudsy flavor; crisp and effective in its refreshment--haven't really had a bad Goose Island yet...."

"Very crisp and refreshing. Hints of fresh fruit with a barely noticeable hop profile The color was pale yellow and slightly cloudy. The head was light. Smell was very mild, yeasty. Good mouthfeel, light and not overly carbonated. I enjoyed it. This a wheat beer that I would buy again."
""
"Overall: A good beer for what it is. Definitely more flavorful than macros and whatnot. And yes, I know that Goose Island ""sold out", but they have some damn solid offerings. This is easily probably their simplest option, good for non-craft drinkers. If I ever lived in an area without good craft options, but could get this one because the buyout made GI more widely distributed, I would definitely pick this up. Also wouldn't hesitate bringing this to a party or something if there weren't better local options available. I intend on comparing this one to Bell's Oberon and Upland Wheat when I have a chance. We will see how those stack up."

"Pours a clear, pale straw color with two fingers of white head. The nose is grassy. Mild and light wheat flavor that lacks the funky tartness of many American wheat beers. There just a touch of hoppiness on the finish. As wheat beers go, this one is amazingly ok."

Maybe a good beer to introduce to someone who is used to light lagers?"

"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a hazy light golden amber with a half finger white head that dissipates to a thick film with a ring around the glass. Aroma of wheat, bready malt and a hint of banana. Flavor of grassy hops, biscuit malt, wheat. Closer in taste to a light pilsner than a wheat beer. Light bodied. Pleasant, but would have liked a bit more wheat character, this leaned towards a light standard ale in flavor. Finished the glass and enjoyed it, but would probably not buy this if I was in the mood for a wheat ale again."

"o: I would love to sample this ale just after produced to see how much I am missing by drinking an older one. Make sure to pay attention to the label and I have overlooked as the sour taste really took away from the enjoyment of this beer.

"I've gotta say, I'd be lying if I wasn't excited to try this. 312 is one of the most popular crafts in the Northeast, and I haven't had a chance to try it yet. There's gotta be some reason it's popular! It pours out a hazy yellow-golden color with a head that retains very well. The aroma is a citrus and wheat affair, with a light touch of citrus hoppiness. The taste is very nice, it manages to do a smooth wheat and citrus thing, but minus the graininess that often accompanies this flavor profile. I like grainy flavors, don't get me wrong, but this is a nice switch-up that really makes the beer seem delicate. There's also a nice subtle hop character that adds just a touch of spiciness. The mouthfeel is spot-on, this beer goes down way too easy. I really love trying a region's ""gateway crafts," they're almost always very well-made if not especially to the average BA's taste. 312 is a solid and extremely drinkable wheat. I think we'll make good friends over the summer."
""
""
"Poured into a tulip glass. Pours cloudy golden with a thick white head. There are some visible bubbles rising in the glass. The beer smells of barley and wheat malt with some light citrus. The taste follows the nose. I get the barley and wheat as well as the citrus. There's just a touch of back end bitterness. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The beer is smooth and refreshingly drinkable. This is a straightforward, yet very good beer."

"Poured this American Pale Wheat Ale from a bottle into a pint glass. Poured a hazy yellow color, produced an average white head, average retention and it left some lacing on the glass. The aroma contained fresh baked bread and lemon citrus. Medium bodied, the ale had a foundation of malted wheat, fresh baked bread, herbal hop bitterness and lemon citrus, smooth mouthfeel and finishes dry.

"Had this one while hanging out with beermeX2 at Potent Potables! Served from tap into a shaker. Poured a hazy pale yellow with a two finger white head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, spice, grain, and subtle citrus. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, grain, fruit, subtle citrus, and subtle spice. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. As far as the style goes, most people do not go into these looking to be completely blown away when they first approach it. However sometimes you do come across some good examples of the style with just a touch of difference from others to make it stand out. This was one of those cases where it did have just a little bit extra going on to keep you interested. The nice subtle notes of citrus helped out on the balance of this one quite a bit and made it rather refreshing and enjoyable. A pretty well done example of the style, but as I stated, it will not blow you away. Definitely worth your time trying if you have not done so before or are looking for something light and refreshing."

"O: Pretty average wheat beer, good mix of everything you need in a wheat ale with low ABV, so you could drink quite a few of these."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is really thin and wtaery. There really isn't aything there. I would recommend this as a first beer for the macro-brew types for conversion. Fro the regular craft drinkers, there isn't enough in the body going on. The upside is that this leads to some really easy mouthfeel."

"Nasty, garbage beer. Bought a bucket of four at a DC bar while watching a bears game because they were on special and supposed to be a Chicago beer. Can said ""made in NY"". That wouldn't really bother me but this beer is vomitous. I honestly would rather have a budweiser and I hate budweiser."
""
""
""
""
"Pours nice and pale yellow smells is weak nonexistent would like more banana and clove from this taste is easy drinking thirst quenching but light could easily put a few of these back but not the first wheat I'd reach for would go for it over boulevard"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I would pair with seafood."
"Pours a murky light yellow with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, and yeast. Taste is much the same with a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. White head, low retention, disappearing completely pretty quickly. Clear lacing. Body is extremely clear light yellow. Aroma dominated by a candy-like artificial sweetness, not really picking up any other flavors because of it. Taste is very light, very low hop bitterness, not picking up on any wheat related flavors. Not a bad beer, just more of a gateway beer for bmc drinkers I suppose, lacking in the flavor department."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a banal beer, but an effective one. It's sessionable, and no part of this is bad. It's not exciting, but I can't complain about it at all. It's possible the prototypical American Pale Wheat in this sense."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The simplicity of the brew is what is best about it. I see this as a great session beer, and that is just what I'll do with this six pack as I watch my Bills."
""
"This is a very simple but subtle beer. It doesn't have any great or profound flavors, but it has some nice, balanced subtleties. I probably won't have this again, but it was nice once."

"Thanks to woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a cloudy, rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mostly of lemons. Taste has a light lemon tartness, a bit of wheat tang, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall would have probably been enjoyed more on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"312 Urban Wheat pours a clear straw yellow color with a very small head. There is a very dry lemon like aroma. The taste has a nice crisp malty backbone, with hints of lemon, nice full flavor, but a bit too carbonated. Overall this is a decent wheat ale, very clean and crisp, but not watery."
"This is a light bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. It is light, refreshing and easy drinking. I think i would have enjoyed this even more if the lemon aspect didnt come across so candy-like. Also, the grainy sweetness of the wheat only over-emphasized the candy feel to this. Regardless, the alcohol is well integrated and this was effortlessly drinkable. It really hit the spot after getting shit done around the house and breaking a bit of a sweat. In the summertime, I would have no issues throwing back a bunch of these. Thanks for the gift Heath!"

"Bottle from customized variety pack at the Daybreak in Nashotah, WI. Very slightly hazy gold beer with a medium head. Light body that is crisp on the palate. Lagerish light malt turns softer and silky as the carbonation settles. Subtle hop fruit and bitterness in the taste. Finishes dry. Not bad."

"Served on a chilled glass, had to taste this beer as many beer connossieurs agree that it is a good brew. Had it while eating dinner at Chili's. Its color was a light transparent yellow, minimal head formation. The aroma was very citrusy. The taste on the other hand was very bitter almost like drinking sour orange juice. The aftertaste also was horrible, at least it was on happy hour. Overall I would not recommend this beer."
""
"O: decent beer, nice that it's available in a can at the grocery store in Chicago at $8 for a 6-pack. I'd buy it again if I'm in a pinch to get cans at the grocery store until something better comes."
""
"Looked great, the taste was a letdown, which makes it fairly average for a wheat."
""
""
""
""

"other than some bread, plenty of water and very mild hint of orange and lemon, not much here. It's pretty much your run-of-the-mill pale wheat ale."

"O: I think Goose Island shines best with their more ""Imperial"" efforts. I could take them or leave them on the flagships."

"O/D - Nice beer for the style. Light and fruity with some light but tasty flavours. Could drink a few."
""
""
""

"D - Overall, not a bad summer beer; easy to drink and light tastes of wheat and straw; nothing to brag about, but enjoyable for the masses"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light yellow in the glass with a respectable head and some lacing. The nose is citrusy and heavy lemon. Mouthfeel is good with a nice amount of carbonation. Taste is light and refreshing - good summer time beer - more citrus and a hint of grass. Overall a nice beer beer for a hot day but not remarkable as there are others out there that are similar."

"O: Causual drinker overall, does not have enough flavor interest to hold my interest to the end of the drink, let alone have another. The definition of mediocrity. Ive waited awhile to get the chance to try some of thier products and have to say haven't been to impressed, even with thier ipa. I like my beers big and bold but also can appreciate a light drinking easy going beer (ie. hacker pschorr helles, gold, paulaner munich) so i do not feel i am prejudice against light drinking beers, just those that lack flavor as with this one."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a lightly hazed gold color, moderate cap of bubbly white froth, gone quickly. Scent is pale, mild yeast and citrus zest and not much more. Taste follows scents lead... mild with a touch of bready yeast and citrus zest. Light bodied, slightly bubbly. Pale, light but refreshing."

"312 is a pretty standard wheat ale. Hazy golden color, lemon & wheat smell/taste. Crisp, refreshing, etc. If you're in the Chicago area, this is going to be a common tap beer and it'll probably be the saving grace of certain bars with average/poor selections (at least in my experience). I wouldn't buy a 6 pack of it, but I also wouldn't refuse it."

"I wanted to like this one more but man; this is a really average take on a Wheat beer that is just boring feeling at times. I’m not usually one to just come out and call a beer that either but this unfortunately was the only thought going through my brain as I drank this. Disappointing."

"Peace, babies, I’m out!"

"I've had this before AB took over and cannot tell a difference. Still 2nd only to Boulevard Wheat as far as I'm concerned, for a pale wheat."
""
""
""
""
""
"O it is a beer I would buy again and drink again and again."
""
""
""
"O. Overall all a decent brew. Not the best, not the worst. Not quite sure what ""Urban"" wheat exactly means."
"O. A very approachable pale wheat in that it has some good, but not bold, flavoring. Should be a lot more crisp for the style...can't figure out why this wouldn't have more carb since it seems like an automatic summer porch sipper. This drinks like a mass produced hefe rather than a pale wheat, but it's decent."

"On a side note, Anheuser-Busch recently purchased Goose Island Brewery and moved production of the beer to Baldwinsville, NY. I never had the 312 while it was still brewed locally, so I don't know if the move affected the overall quality."

""
""

""

""

""
""
""

"O: This is a great beer for the style. It's perfect. Light, smooth, refreshing. Sure it's not very strong or complex, but that's not what it's supposed to be. This is a great session/summer beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad beer, necessarily, but reminds me a bit of Magic Hat's defunct Hocus Pocus cross-bred with a Hoegaarden of lesser quality. The 4.2% ABV is right in the session range as a summer heat-stopper, but outside of using it to cool the heat of my buffalo wings, I didn't thoroughly enjoy it on its own. Not bad, but not a top pick from Goose Island's year-round lineup."
""
""
"O- Not a bad wheat beer, but there are better out there. Worth trying, but Goose Island has a lot of other beers that I would pick up before this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a decent wheat. Certainly easy enough to drink."
""
"O-easy drinkability, but flavor not overly compelling"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" Straightforward, nice but nothing to go out of my way to try again"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It's a very easy drinking, hot 100 degree day beer. Perfect beer for the hot summer days and nights. Not much flavor or hop bitterness, again, very easy to drink. Lower alc percentage makes this a great summer session beer. I would definitely buy it again for the summer days."
""
"On draft in a cold mug. Hazy gold color without head that promises a good wheat ale. The nose is spicy though, very surprising. The taste again is dominated with the spicy hops, and not all that much fruit. I like it. Just not so much what I expect from a wheat."
""
""
""
""
"Living in Chicago and drinking beer, you will certainly run across Goose Island's 312. It's their basic beer and it tastes like it. There's nothing wrong with it. I like it. But there's nothing special about it either. Over the past few years, I have found it consistent, and consistently average."
"From a bottle stamped Bottled on 04/16/12. Sampled on June 17, 2012. It pours a hazy pale yellow with a white fizzy head that fades to a ring but lingers in ring-form. There is lots of upward carbonation. The aroma is of pale malts, wheat, and citrus. The body is light. The taste plays down the wheat in favor of the citrus sensation to make it a reasonable summertime beer. It finishes clean and crisp."
""
""
"Pours golden with a fluffy white head. Wet dog and yeast aroma, some hay. The flavor follows with watered down wheaty, light citrus, some hay, and just a hint of sweetness. Overall pretty light bodied, finishes well for the style, with medium high carbonation. Not bad. Definitely not Goose Island's top effort, but we know this is on the mass produced side."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's easy to drink but it lacks much flavor. It's just kind of a generic beer, nothing really stands out."
""
""
"O - I've really enjoyed this beer in the past, but this iteration's metallic flavor destroys the delicate nature of 312, really making it bland and not worthwhile."
""
"This is a decent brew. It has a decent smell and some good taste, but it is slightly watery."
"Inoffensive. Drinkable. What more do you need? So I didn't think highly of it? SO WHAT! Go out and try it anyway!"
""
"The body is light with good carbonation. Overall this one is pretty forgettable. I'm sure I'll have it again at some point, but there are just better beers just as available; even from Goose Island."
"Lighter medium body, medium-high carbonation, bubbly and smooth on the tongue. This is pretty drinkable and refreshing for the summertime, although there's plenty of others like it out there."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pleasant warm weather session beer. Enjoy it for what it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a surprisingly clear looking brew, the color was golden and the head was white. The smell of the beer gives off some sweet wheat aromas, perhaps some other sweet grains as well. The nose of this beer is very light, nothing too pronounced here really. The taste of the beer is soft, quite refreshing, not fruity just light and enjoyable without much of a hop bitterness. The mouthfeel of the beer is light with a moderate carbonation. Overall it's a good drinking beer, isn't something I'd want all the time but it was nice to try."
""
"Taste wasn't as big or interesting as the smell had me expecting. The malt was upfront and the finish has some hop. Not the best of the style, but it goes down easy enough. Light enough for the heat of summer... I would like to try it on tap."
"O: Extremely refreshing and extremely easy to drink - this is a very sessionable beer and is great for the summer. I enjoyed the lightness of the flavor and that made this a beer that I could easily have a couple."
"Pours transparent golden color (real pretty) with white bubble head. Very vague scent of floral notes, slight honey and lemon cookie. Some pleasant flavors of lemon cookie, honey, floral notes, and slight acidity with vanilla to ride it out. Very light in body with medium carbonation. Good looking brew, tasty but I miss the heavier body and vanilla, clove of a traditional wheat."
""
"Overall - A nice easy sessionable summer drinker but there a few more flavorful offerings out there. A ""safe"" conservatively crafted offering from Goose Island."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Welcome to Virginia, Goose Island! I'm more then stoked to see GI on our retail shelves, and part of the reason is this beer right here. This screams flavorful summer sessioning, and I plan on having sixers of this around every dog day this summer season. Easily recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Its a nice beer to have cold on a hot and humid day. Not much more, but in that scenario its great."
""
"Overall: obviously very drinkable. Nice flavor for a usually bland genre. one of the better for the style."
""
""
""
"O: A decent beer that I would drink again if better options were not available."
""
""
""
"O- for what this is, it's a damn good beer. Very easy drinking and nonoffensive"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O/D-A moderately enjoyable brew. I have probably almost tried this beer about 20 times. After finally trying it, I now understand why I chose other brews before it in those 20 instances."

"With a hiss from the cap pry three one two goes in looking light yellow in color with some slight golden beams shooting through. Looks like a berliner weisse. A stealth pour yields the smallest cap of white possible, leaving a ring around the collar, no lace. Smell is on the wheaty side for sure with some pale malt backing. Traces of lemon with a semi sweet scent coming through with warming. Taste is pretty even keeled. Not overly malty, not overly hoppy, with wheat taking the center stage. Small traces of fruit and grassy hops, but wheat is king here. Feel is light bodied with not prickly carb, this goes down very smooth with no bite at all, perfect for the warmer months. At 4.2% a few of these would be easy. While the lower octane offerings from goose island are simple styles and not overly flavorful, the particular style was nailed down pretty well. This wont be a regular in my fridge, but it's a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the first time I've had the Goose Island 312 Urban Wheat ale, and I'm definitely a fan. Where I come from we do our best to keep the freezer full of geese, but now that Goose Island is available in Connecticut, the hunt is going to be a lot easier."
""
""
""
""

"O: this is a pretty good brew that would make me want to come back and get it again, and hopefully next time I'll make sure I have it in a pilsener."

"12oz bottle purchased at Shaw's in North Hampton. Pours a hazy very light yellow body with a good inch of white-ish head that leaves some decent lacing as it dissipates. Smells mainly fruity, though lightly, with lemon, orange, and pithy notes. Tastes initially sweet with fruity orange, lemon, melon, and pith. Light-bodied with ample effervescent carbonation. Dry finish with little aftertaste. Tasty and super-drinkable. I could see this being a good summer session beer on a hot day."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and though not complex at all, keeps you coming back because of the finish. Great summer beer, as it's low in abv and light enough to drink a few"
""
"Overall - It's enjoyable. I'd have it again if I were in the mood for a simple wheat beer."
""
""
""
"The taste is watery. Adjunct grains, wheat, a touch of honey sweetness as well. Its not overly complex, but very drinkable. much, much better than SA Summer Ale."
"a clear golden yellow pour with a minimal amount of head. barely any lacing. smells bready with a hint of honey. tastes very bready and yeasty.. slight taste of citrus. light bodied with moderate carbonation. extremely refreshing. this is a very generic tasting wheat beer with a slight citrus zest.. very refreshing for hot summer days."
"O- It's a pretty standard light wheat beer. Enjoyable and easy drinking."
""
""
""
"D - Refreshing and easy drinking but nothing out of the ordinary."
""
"O: I don't find anything off-putting about the beer, but there's not much to excite either. They were out of Jai Alai on tap, and this seemed like the next best option."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a weisse vase, the beer is a pale, slightly hazy, yellow coloring with only the slightest trace of filmy edging along the surface of the beer. Steady flow of carbonation bubbling throughout the body of the beer. Aromas are roasted grains, with a slight lemony citrus highlight. Flavors have a citrus tang throughout, with a light body and grainy backbone. Lemon zest flavors make the majority of the palate, and the beer is light, but surprisingly smooth when considering the carbonation and flavors. Slightly toasted and syrupy sweet aftertaste, transitioning into a clean, smooth finish. Decent beer, and extremely sessionable. Great for hot weather."
""
""

"Decent for what it is, there are clearly some other American Wheat Ales that are a few notches up. I'd still gladly order this if the selection looked dismal."

"O: Good example of the style, nothing fancy but quite solid. Perfect way to recover from an hour of mowing the yard."
""
""
""
"This is my go-to beer. I had to force myself to stop drinking it so much, but it has a good amount of sweetness without being cloying, some nice dryness to balance (I actually think it could take more). It's easy to drink, and I like to return to it when in doubt in the beer aisle."
""
"O- Not a huge fan of the style, and would never order a 312 at a bar, but had some cans from a party and thought it was just ok. Would be a good lawnmower beer on a hot day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Much more assertive than most pale wheats I've had. Relatively sweet and very pleasing."
"Overall; the beer was heavier than I was expecting, enjoyed this beer and will have some this summer again. Reminded me of Boddingtons."
""
""
""
"o - Overall an average wheat beer. Nose is a bit bland thought the taste is better with some citrus to it. Easy to drink, but probably wouldn't have it again."
"still trying to decide what to make of goose island- sell outs or success story? a decidedly un-west-coast wheat, it wasn't unpleasant to have a change of pace (just not a beer i would stock up on!)"
""
""
""
"M. Medium body and carbonation levels, but also smooth in texture. Refreshing like the body of a lawnmower beer but with more flavor being carried forth to my palate."
"Very light straw-yellow with a fluffy white head that settles to a squat cap. Big aromas of honey, biscuit malt, banana, and wheat. Crisp and refreshing. Taste is similar to the nose, crisp wheat, honey, and malt with a touch of lemon zest. Light-bodied, nicely drinkable, and just what I needed after a long day at work. Overall a decent Wheat Beer, not a lot going on but it's a nice step up from BMC on a hot Summer day."

"had on tap at the silver bullet in peoria. beer was served in proper goose island glassware. a cloudy bananna taffy colored body with a half inch of white head that had good retention and lacing. i could pick up hints of lemon, wheat and citrus in the nose. taste had the afore mentioned with hints of biscuit. mouthfeel was a full body, almost chewy. nice and smooth with good carbonation and the slightest hop presence on the backend. overall this is a good wheat beer that should be higher regarded than it is."

"O - I think that a lot of people unfairly associate this beer with some of the wannabe wheat beers made by the macro-breweries, but it is honestly better than that. 312 is an excellent light beer, perfect for an occasion when you have a variety of drinkers and want something flavourful"

"D/O: As advertised, this beer follows the model established by American-brewed pale lagers in which no one is offended and the needs of the least-common denominator of the beer-drinking world are faithfully served. It yields honest cereal qualities in small doses both cleanly and with a powerful potential to cleanse the palate. Not surprisingly, its soul-less nature leaves the adventurous palate wanting more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It doesn't do anything special, but it's easy to drink and the flavor, while not spectacular, isn't bad either. I'm not exactly a big fan of wheat beers, but this one was alright."
""
""
"A summer beer without question, but even a little more effort could have created a vastly better beer. As a result this one is bland and extremely boring."

""
"Poured from a bottle the beer pours well with a thin foamy head, appearance is a cloudy pale yellow color with a lemon smell. tastewise for a wheat the beer is neither wheaty enough or bitter enough for my taste, a bland nothing beer, drinkable but nothing exceptional and disappointing from Goose Island."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A style that is enjoyable when done correctly, but there isn't enough wheat and the slight bitterness is lacking. Goose Island can make some stouts but this is a boring beer."
""
""
""
"O - definitely a one shot deal. Would drink it again if it was offered, but don't think I'll be buying it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I want this to be better, but it's not. In light of other reviews, I consider the possibility that this has skunked or there was a line issue. If this was a 312, I left 156 of it in the glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not a whole lot going on taste wise, but it would work well as a gateway beer to get others into craft. It's kind of like a spiced up basic lager."
""
""
"O: This beer just didn’t do it for me it. It was drinkable but nothing I would grab again."
""
"Overall-refreshingly light, a decent amount of flavor given its character. I would have this again. Worth a try."

""
""
"Overall - A pretty non-descript Wheat beer... maybe worth a try once..."

"As a Chicago native, I wish they would have chosen a stronger beer to bear the city's area code. It's weak even for a wheat beer and should be called 847 to represent the suburbs."

"Pours a cloudy pale yellow color with a decent white head. Smells of lemon, mainly wheat, some citrus hop notes. Taste of mild wheat, lemon zest, and citrus hops (cascade).

"This beer looks very nice for a pale wheat ale, pale, slightly cloudy, short head with a bit of nice lacing, but minimal staying power. The aroma is pretty nice. Get a good lemon zest aroma with a mild breadiness. Subtle, but nice. Taste is way off. There is a difference between light and subtle, and just watery. The kick that was there in the aroma from the zest and the nice breadiness were nowhere to be found. Not much in terms of hops either. A bit of a letdown after the aroma. Mouthfeel is nice and light with good carbonation. Nothing to complain about, but nothing noticeably great. Overall this beer is nice. It is a damn good beer, especially for one that is everywhere in Chi."

"Sure, it remains to be seen what InBev ownership will do to the future of Goose Island. But what awful influence this corporatist political system will have on craft brewers is a forgone conclusion. What's good for the Goose isn't always good for the gander."

"O - Not really my cup of tea but I still enjoyed this one. It was a perfect beer for the beach with just enough flavor to keep me coming back for more."
"M&D: overall the palate is light and refreshing, never too fizzy, against a medium body with a decent amount of sediments to add to the body; this is one of very few examples of “American Wheat Ale” I’ve tried, and by far the most balanced one, although I wouldn’t have the interest to try another bottle to be perfectly honest."
"Drink- It's a good intro in the style and is meant to be a little less of a blast of flavor. Pretty good balance and nice flavors. When in a bind I would have again but not something or style I will go out of way for."
"Really enjoyed this beer. Looking forward to another!"
"Overall- I really enjoyed this beer. I think it is one of the better wheat beers out there."
"Mouthfeel: Medium body. Quite fizzy, perhaps a bit too much so."
"This beer is super easy to drink and the flavor and nose were both more complex than I anticipated upon selecting the bottle."
"O: A generic sort of wheat beer, but it's still good. Probably not excellent enough to recommend, partially because its appeal fades with time."
"Overall – A good beer to quaff. Nothing special and there are better wheat beers out there. However, since I’m back in Chicago this is on tap everywhere and it’s better than nothing."
"Overall too neat and tidy."
"For a style that normally leaves me looking to the next one, this is actually quite good - refreshing, enjoyable, and easy to drink."
"D - It's kind of boring, but it's pretty easy to drink. As far as this style goes, this is one of the better examples, but it's a far cry from Gumballhead."
"Fuller in body than I expected for a low ABV beer, but still on the medium side. Wheat is the main character of this beer, with light twinges of other, more complex flavors that compliment it. Lemon adds the smallest hint of a tang and a sweet flavor that goes well for the style. No off flavors at all here, but the overall experience is a somewhat bland one all things considered. The mouthfeel is a finely carbonated one, with a dry and lingering finish. It's a fine example of the style at the very least, a decent brew at the best, but probably not something I would seek out much of. Easy to drink after nice summer day though."
"D - A straightforward beer, good brew for the summer"
"Eh. Glad summer is over. Beer like this is boredom in a bottle. Consumable but nothing special."
"Taste is very similar to other American wheats: a lot of graininess with some lemon zest to give it a little tartness. Hops are a little more grassy than citrusy. Mouthfeel is light and just a little watery. A refreshing, if imperfect, summer brew."
"O- a good summertime brew, light and refreshing and void of any dominating flavors. Solid but nothing great."
"This was a pleasant enough beer that I imagine would be quite thirst quenching. Nothing overwhelming."
"I tried this beer because being from Chicago i was the guy people laughed at for not having tried GI 312 and by stroke of luck when i went to restaurant one day since they were out of what i had ordered, they offered me a free glass of this for free. I was not impressed at all, It was OK, but a lot of my friends made it out to be like one of the best beers out there and it is not, It is OK, but too expensive, but that is just my opinion i can respect the opinion of others who do really like this, but if I had to drink something from the GI company, i would wait for the time they release Matilda."
"appearance was a hazy yellowish golden color with a small, foamy, white head. The foam settles quickly to a thin film. The aroma is fairly mundane, with notes of fresh wheat, light cereal grains, and pale malt showing strongest. There is a wisp of floral hop character, along with a drop of honey sweetness. Flavors follow suit, light and clean but boring overall. Basically just wheat and honeyed pale malt. The palate falls somewhere between thin and medium bodied, with balanced carbonation and a lightly prickly, semi-dry finish. Sessionable on a hot summer’s day,"
"Just an okay beer overall. I wouldn’t try it again unless I was in the Chicago area. I’ve heard the IPA is better, so I’ll have to take a look."
"Then the taste was surprisingly good! Light and flavorful, nice honey wheat combo. I can almost taste either an orange blossom flavor or some genuine honey. I'd gladly try this beer again!"
"Pours a hazy, light straw color with a finger of creamy head and good carbonation. Smells of wheat and some citrus. Tastes of wheat and mild citrus, finishing with a fruity and very minute bitterness. Smooth and refreshing mouthfeel. This is a pretty reliable beer and will be seen in my fridge again in the near future."
"312 Urban Wheat arrives a fairly hazy sunshine yellow. There's about a finger max of white foam that displays nondescript lacing and head retention. The nose is disappointingly dull, but a small amount of lemon aroma does manage to pop. The flavor has a bit more character to it though. There's an almost tart bit of wheat twang that announces each sip to my palate.The bitterness that pops up halfway through is pronounced for a wheat beer, but doesn't become too much and dominate the flavor. The close is a nice citrusy lemon note that makes me think of a blend of Cascade and Sorachi Ace hops (though Sorachi Ace isn't listed on Goose Island's info page for 312). The body is surpemely light, and is paired with a fairly spritzy level of carbonation. The balance is just right though, the carbonation doesn't become overbearing, and the beer comes across as very quaffable. This is one that I could definitely see myself enjoying again, especially in the warm weather."
"Very good for the summer, i'll have this again. (good thing I bought 5 bottles!)"
"Overall- Had a nice clean, crisp wheat taste. This would be a nice summertime hot wheather beer. Can't see myself drinking this one too often as there are other wheat beers I like better."
"A quality product of Goose Island. I purchase a case of 312 everytime I visit the Chicago area and I am never disappointed. I have had it on tap a few times as well and I am very excited every time I see it available when I'm out at the bars. Goes down smooth. Is a refreshing and tasty beverage for any time of the year. It pours a pretty light straw color with a decent head that slowly fades away."
"This is a pleasant American wheat, but it's not especially engaging on any level. It does have nice flavor, but it's not especially memorable. This is clearly very drinkable, and a good one to have around in the summer months."
"o: not terrible, but not what I expected. A nice flavor overall but could have used a bit more follow through on it. could enjoy this on a hot day, but I have others I prefer over it."
"A decent wheat ale, but nothing special. Could use a stronger grain bill and better carbonation. Not particularly memorable, but not bad."
"o - good summertime beer, but not one of the better examples of the style. seems light on everything, flavor, smell, feel and enjoyment."
"I have had this beer in a bottle and on tap, I think tap is better if you can get it that way. It has a great color and a lot of flavor, it is on of my favorits on a hot day. It has a citrus flavor that I usually don't love in beer but it is done right by Goose Island."
"D/O- Not for me but most likely a great summer beer for others. A style that I don't usually care for...this one gets a passing grade."
"Golden hazy yellow. Small fluffy layer of head with good retention. In the nose there is lemon, wheat, grassy hops and light yeast. Light on the flavors but refreshing. Flavor is simple. Wheat and subtle lemon with a crisp faintly yeasty finish. Hops are not as present as the nose. Creamy and crisp body goes down quickly. A six of these sounds good on a hot day."
"This was probably the first beer I had that wasn't a Bud, Miller, Keystone, Natty Light or whatever horrible crap I used to drink in college, so I have a sort of special place in my heart for it. Now, I find that this one just falls short. Too bad that Goose Island was sold. I fear that the quality may just slide downhill now."
"O - This is a great summertime brew! It's amazingly drinkable and refreshing, but doesn't do much for me besides that. I think it would be a great beer to introduce others to craft beer with, but that's only because there isn't anything out of the box about it."
"Lemon yellow body with a slight haziness to it. Only downside is a very weak head. Very sweet, floral and fruity in the nose. Kind of reminds me of one of my favorite cereals Fruity Pebbles. Taste is very dry and biscuity with a sour citrus twist. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated. It has a sharpness that is thirst quenching and a tad oily. Great summertime brew!"
"I haven't had a ton of GI beers but I really really like Pere Jacques, Sofie, and Matilda. Had the IPA on the same night and liked it, although I found it to be middle of the road. This one was utterly forgettable, a waste of calories. Lightweight and with no real distinguishing characteristics. THis is one for the macro light beer fans only, I think. Don't get it."
"Drinkability: Overall, a very good beer. It is very easy to drink and the taste is great. Very refreshing and would enjoy drinking again."
"-JH-"
"O: Decent pale wheat ale. Lacks in nose and nothing much going on with the taste. Definitely refreshing though."
"Overall a nice beer, its funny I really liked this beer when I had it before but it must have been much fresher the bottling date is 5/19 on this. Damn you Jewel Osco!"
"Overall: A clean and light representation of the style. A very drinkable wheat ale but perhaps forgettable."
"Overall: It's an APWA alright, though thankfully not as cheerless and lifeless as some, and, after going out rowing for the afternoon, it really provides for some substantial refreshment."
"Overall: Some, who might demand bolder, maltier, and hoppier beers might be let down. But I think this beer is very well done, and has a subtle complexity and balance."
"M- Very full and appealing. Great carbonation, goes down very smooth. Could put down a few with no problem."
"This was drank in the perfect environment. Warm, breezy, after yard work by the fire. Pours the palest of golds, white meringue head, shiny. Smells like a wheat field. Tastes of wheat, and some sweet malt, a bit of bitterness on the back, but refreshing and man, it is drinkable. Mouthfeel was smooth and clean. Overall, a very enjoyable brew."
"It's fine"
"Overall a decent beer, I'd definitely drink again. I don't care *that* much about the AB deal, this is still a solid drink in my opinion and widely available."
"Overall: A good beer within it's category. Strongly recommend Montana Trout Slayer from Big Sky Brewing Co. if you like this style of a beer."
"Overall this beer is as advertised: crisp, clean and refreshing. Nothing more and nothing less. I'm not crazy about it, but I don't dislike it either. Now if only I could find some of that 3 Floyds Gumball I've been hearing so much about around here."
"Overall: A very solid summer ale. Light but very tasty."
"O - I really enjoy this beer. It is a great session brew. Easy to drink, light, crisp, refreshing. One of my favorite American Wheats."
"cloudy straw colored brew the a decent head and a bit of lace sticking as I drink. Malty aromas with a healthy wheat component and lemony zing. Taste is dry gains, malt sweetness and lemon. mild wheat malt presence and bit of yeasty dough as well. Smooth soft crispness in the feel with a pleasurable amount of carbonation and quenching dryness. A great summer quencher and session A lawn mower beer with flavor and a bit of pizazz."
"Overall- Great beer during the summer! I hope people are going to still order and enjoy all of Goose Island's beer after this merge with A.B. I have had this many times and now I'm reviewing it, it feel like an average wheat beer to me. The drinkability was outstanding and the group I was with all ordered this beer as well. I'm always wanting to push people into a new direction with beer and at the Fox n Hound Pub, besides their adjuncts and usual domestics on-tap, this one is not too extreme but different for many non-craft beer drinkers. Cheers to Craft Beer!"
"Overall: Seems like a generic version of a Hefe. Better than most domestics but not great for the style. I can't wait to see how much worse this beer gets with A-B buying Goose Island. It already tastes like shocktop. . ."
"Very nice zippy and pungent taste. Fruit flavors are apparent (apples and lemons) plus a nice little hoppy bite (more like a nibble). Very smooth and refreshing, but not a lot of substance to it. I suppose this is indicative of pale wheat ales, but try some Three Floyds Gumballhead if you want to see what CAN be done with this style."
"O - This beer was overall fantastic to me, light and fresh, but full of flavor. I could have had these all night with no problem."
"not a strong wheat flavor or aroma though, but a good beer just the same."
"A very good overal offering that is a nice representation of this style. I enjoy this every time I have it."
"This is my favorite refreshing summer beer. This beer isn't overly sweet, sour, bitter, or hoppy. Imagine a generic American lager (Bud, Miller, whatever) if it was wheatier, more well-built, more opaque in appearance, and had a subtle but pleasant (rather than skunky) smell. This is every bit as easy to drink as those American lagers, which makes it the perfect drink-it-all-afternoon beer option for the summer."
"O – Refreshing and drinkable."
"O - overall, a great solid American style wheat beer. Stacks up very well next to others in the style. Great for a hot day sitting on the patio."
"I did not enjoy, tasted plain, but now I see why people drink this in the Midwest quit often. It is very light and may be a new session beer for me. Very wheaty with a hint of fruit trying to poke through. To make this a B it would need some lemon or orange zest, but then it wouldn't be as drinkable. This is very light, crisp, and drinkable, definitely a Blue Moon substitute."
"In all, in case one wonders- this Froegaarden-like deal is very spring/summery and a delight to session."
"This is one of the first craft beers I've had and it really opened my eyes to how good beer can actually taste (compared to BMC). For this reason, I rate it a bit higher for nostalgic purposes. I really like this beer for what it is: an extremely refreshing and drinkable beer for those dog days of summer. It doesn't drink like a German hefe, not does it claim to be one."
"Pours a straw yellow. Not much of a head, but nice carbonation streaming from the bottom. Smells of malt, bready notes, lemon zest, light floral. Light smell overall, but it's good. The taste follows the nose, rather bready with a nice lemon zing to it. It's a good wheat ale, I drink it quite often and it's a good beer to session. It's not my favorite wheat ale, but I would not pass one of these up. Solid B."
"O - Nothing to seek out; way decent when the other options are BL and Stella."
"I particularly like the value and the fact that she found a beer she can enjoy with me. I am a fan of Goose Island and will do my best to keep this one in stock for her and encourage her to try more with me."
"Overall / Drinkability: It's a refreshing beer, but I'm not sure about it. I feel it's solidly above average, but not solidly good. I had it by itself but I wonder if I would enjoy it more with food."
"Fine mouthfeel...usually a decent value and a decent beer overall."
"O - don't know how much more I could expect from the style"
"Tap: Poured a light bright yellow color ale with a small foamy head with limited retention. Aroma consists of wheat malt with semi-sweet notes. Taste is also dominated by wheat malt with light sugary notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Not much more then a middle of the road wheat ale."
"O: Okay beer. Not particularly good. Wish there was more dedication in one direction or the other as far as the style goes: hops or yeast/grain highlights."
"O (D) - Very drinkable beer, not great tasting by any means. It's ok, I should say. Perhaps its better fresher, though its really not that far out. Not something I will likely buy again unless it's on sale."
"O: A great summertime American Pale Wheat. I prefer this to the (locally) very popular Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat. 312 is less yeasty and has a touch of hops that makes it a better choice in my opinion."
"A"
"Overall: nothing particularly excites me about this and I wouldn't really want to get it again. It could use some more boldness or at least some more complexity. While some beers benefit from subtlety, this beer resembles a light lager a little too much for its own good. I wouldn't bother and would go for a different wheat beer instead. Cheers!"
"O: I didn't think this was anything amazing. Picked this up because my spouse calls it the Obama beer. Just reminded me of an amped up BMC. I would drink it again, but wouldn't buy it for myself."
"Goose Island 312 Urban Wheat Ale is a cloudy, pale straw colored beer with a thin white head that fades to film and leaves decent lacing on the glass. There's not much aroma, just a faint metallic whiff and a note of lemon. It has a very Lively light body with a crisp, dry finish. There's not much flavor; a little wheat with a hint of grassy bitterness. It has good balance. This is like doing it in a canoe, so it goes down quite easily. It has no faults."
"This beer looks good, I think its appearance is the best quality about it. The aromas are difficult to detect but the taste is bitter enough to get my attention. Decent for a warm day after doing some work in the garden."
"O: As far as the Pale Wheat style of beer goes, this isn't bad, but it's still not something I'd care to drink again."
"I gotta say that this will probally become my new ""hot summer day"" beer because the smell and taste is very refreshing and my hats off to Goose Island because the two beers I've tried from them have been really good."
"Overall this is one of my favorite home town brews and the brewers at goose island never seem to let me Down. This is my standard go to craft beer at the various pubs around Illinois."
"Re-rating as a wheat beer doesn't really change any of my scores, surprisingly. I always had a somewhat negative view of this beer, but I also always recommended it to non-craft loving friends whenever I was in Chicago, so at least that's consistent."
"Overall: Nothing mind-blowing about this beer, but I think it accomplished its mission. This is an easy-drinking, light, subtle brew that will appeal to all sorts of people. No one will absolutely love this, but I can't see how anyone would hate it."
"Overall a beer which is just above average."
"D: Very good wheat beer. One of the few I enjoy with a lemon (forgive me), although it is completely unnecessary."
"The 312 was served in a pint glass. Color was a hazy yellow, with small yeast particles. I wasn't able to pick up much with the scent as the pub I was in had it's own overwhelming scent that really stood out. The body was very smooth, nice and creamy with a pleasant crisp, fruity flavor. This would be extremely enjoyable in the summer. I can see it being very refreshing on a warm day and easily enjoying quite a few of these."
"Medium mouthfeel and very drinkable. Decent summer beer."
"D: a good lawnmower beer, and not much else."
"The 847 reppin' the 312. ...Or is it t'other way 'round? I can never remember. Either way, this stuff pours a clear pale straw topped by over a finger of white mini-froth. The nose comprises wheat, lemon peel, light coriander, and flowers. The taste, unfortunately, leans excessively heavily on the wheat and flowers, allowing the fruitier notes to fall by the wayside. In the end, not much is goin' on on my tongue. The body is fairly light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, an okay brew, something I could see downing to cool off in the summer or something, but not something to purposely seek out for only pleasure."
"This will be a great hot sunny day beer to have cold after mowing the lawn."
"Would be a great summer session beer; flavor is just decent/average, much less complex than a Hefeweizen, and not outstanding, but this is highly drinkable and easy to put down. I'd have it again"
"D- this is an ok Wheat beer. Not my favorite by GI but will prob. get again sometime!"
"I could see 312 Urban Wheat being quite refreshing on a summer day. I, however, consumed it when it was about 5 degrees F outside and it wasn't bad at all."
"D- this was barely an average wheat beer, it seemed watered down and nearly flavorless, i expected better from goose island who has impressed me with a majority of their beers"
"I first had this beer on tap in the Chicagoland area and loved it. It's a simple, refreshing beer to have served very cold on a hot day. And its sessionable ABV allows you to have a few of them, too."
"The flavor is well balanced and almost meaty for a wheat beer; it probably benefits from the lack of filtering. Grain and citrus fruit acidity up front are followed with a nicely matched hop bill to give it a tangy finish."
"Overall I was really quite impressed Just a downright tasty hefe."
"You could drink this all day everyday if you didn't require any flavor. It sucks."
"This beer pours a very thin yet hazy straw golden yellow in color with a poofy one finger white head. The aromas are very grassy, herbal, and lemony. They're pretty subtle though. The flavors consist of yeast, light spice, with light lemon yet they're kind of weak. It drinks fine with light carbonation and is very thing and easy to drink. I know this is Goose Island's most available beer but it tastes a little too much like a mass produced what. That said, it is a little better out of a bottle that's had a little time to sit around but this review was from a fresh tap. It's ok, nothing special."
"Drinkability - this is there signature beer, nothing special but just good. would like to try on tap but overall a good purchase."
"D - Very easy to drink. Nothing great, but very solid. This would be a great summer beer to enjoy. Would pick up a sixer of this to split with friends, craft and macro drinkers both."
"Pours to a fluffy white head and pale yellow color. Hazy with yeast. Aroma is creamy, wheaty and slight citrus and noble hops. Flavor is mostly sweet malt and wheat with a slight lemony and hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, not your typical wheat ale. Overall, this is a pleasant, tasty beer to be had anytime. The bottle I am enjoying was filled on 5/2010 and here it is 2/2011 and it has held up well."
"D: This is a pretty strong version of what's become a pretty nondescript style. I'd prefer if they'd filter this less (or not at all) and let some more yeasty character shine through to complement what is a pretty good base of wheat malt and American hops."
"D - really easy to drink. goes down like water. just an average wheat beer. I was a little disappointed by this one."
"Highly drinkable. Not overwhelming to the palate. Would be a good kick-back brew for a summer night. Well done."
"Very drinkable beer, my go to beer as a replacement for BMC with company and summer parties."
"drinkability is good - this beer should not win any awards for flavor but if you are looking for an non thinker idiot beer this is a good one"
"Drinkability: Better to consume on a hot summer day than the dead of winter in MN, but since it was available on tap for Old Chicago's world beer tour. Not memorable, but very drinkable, I may revist this again in July."
"noteworthy in that it is very well balanced with the body of this beer. not too filling, and the ABV isn't very overpowering, in which you can enjoy multiples."
"O: Light and drinkable. This would make a good lawnmower beer and would work well on hot summer days when something else would be too heavy. The style is rather plain, of course (pale wheat), but this eliminates the need for anyone ever needing a macro for a summer, light beer."
"On tap from GI Wrigleyville summer of 2008. A cloudy pale yellow beer with a decent white that manages to leave some good lacing. Sweet aroma of wheat, apricot and oranges. So far the beer gushes cool refreshing summer beer. Light citrus flavor and wheat. Mild carbonation hits the tongue and the beer finishes with a light citrusy wheat bite at the end. There is not much to this beer but it is easily drinkable and enjoyable especially in the summer."
"Good beer. Very smooth and refreshing but not a whole lot of flavor. Nothing off-putting though. A great beer for a hot summer day."
"has a good mouthfeel lots of carbonation and is very drinkable and all around a great beer."
"Disappointingly plain."
"D- This beer has an amazing low ABV which makes it drink rather great. Not my favorite of wheats but it is far from the worst as well. A nice stepping stone beer for people looking to get into craft beer."
"D-A very good lawnmower beer to drink on a hot summer's day. A little thin and underwhelming, but a good alternative to the BMC that is available at your local drinking establishment. Very easy to drink several pints in one sitting."
"This is my Second favorite wheat beer, i have lived in Chicago for 3 years and just recently had it. it came in a 312 Pint glass its gold in color with a lemon smell to it, with a cloudy look to it, i like this beer all year round but it is a great summer beer. if you like Wheat beers like Blue Moon or Shock Top i would try it"
"Overall light and refreshing."
"D: It's easy to see why GI sells a shit ton of this stuff. Refreshing, very easy to drink, and a little unchallenging (not that that's a bad thing). Great for when the merecury begins its' summer climb."
"I give a Schlitz about 312 Urban Wheat Ale. It's a one-trick pony but I wouldn't hesitate to offer it up to one of my BMC-drinking friends."
"D. A nice light bodied feel to this beer makes it easy to drink."
"D/M: smooth drinking, goes down very easy, slight carbonation, very thin"
"D: Low abv, light taste make this an easy beer to drink."
"Mouthfeel/drinkablility: Light bodied and medium to high carbonation. Very crisp."
"I had 312 in the middle of an Iowa winter, probably left over from a long-ago Iowa summer. It's still as good a beer as I remember, and in its proper context would be even more quenching. Goose Island makes some damn fine beers and 312 is another hit."
"Fairly drinkable, nothing mind blowing here, but a nice clean tasting thirst quencher. I will say this is better than any bottle or draft 312 I've had in the past, but this NOW my official baseline. Based on previous experinces with this one I venture to say you best be drinking it fresh..."
"D: Way too easy."
"Goose Island 312. I had no clue this came in a bomber. Very enjoyable."
"Overall this is one of my favorite new beers. I found it by goofing around of this site and checking reviews, and I'm glad I tried it. Very balenced taste. Great session beer for my crew and me. GREAT BEER GOOSE ISLAND BEER CO.!!"
"Pours a hazy golden straw color with a small pillowy pure white head that leaves some lacing on the pint glass. Smell is slightly skunky with some grains and little malts. Not that great smelling. Taste is slightly watery but some hops and grains. Goes down easily and taste much better than it smells. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. Drinkability is mediocre. Low abv makes is sessionable for a night out on the town."
"I am a big fan of Wheat beers. I am kind of new in the beer culture, so I haven't had a lot of opportunity to drink a whole lot of wheats. I've had Blue Moon and Shock Top, and I thought those were really good. But this blows them out of the water. I would highly suggest this beer if you like American Pale Wheat Ales."
"Drinkablilty with the low ABV is a piece of cake makes you want to have another!"
"A bit lacking on the flavour and aroma fronts but overall enjoyable."
"It is a nice beer to just drink in the middle of the day, with lunch, or with a decent blonde cigar."
"D: So, so easy to drink. I could drink this like soda. Great thirst quencher."
"Notes: Very nice pale wheat beer that is quite refreshing. Good summertime, thirst quencher. Also has a good amount of spice, zest, and hints of hops to kick up the wheat a bit."
"Overall this is a pretty solid ""Urban Wheat"". The lemon and spice is excellent and the funk adds a nice edge. The only downside is that it feels very watery (especially with the subdued carbonation). This would be a nice beer for a warm summer afternoon."
"Taste is that of a wheat beer it starts with a slight malttyness it finishes with a wheat taste and finishes quickly a typical wheat beer taste nothing special"
"Mouthfeel- not at all to my taste, the beer is a little overcarbonated. and leaves a bit of a chalky aftertaste"
"D: Good drinkability. Easy drinking. Refreshing."
"Truth be told I think Blue Moon is actually a more interesting and flavorful beer."
"A pleasant and cloudy gold, this wheat ale boasts of an appealing banana and biscuit scent. First taste is subtle, with a slight citrus hint, though it is fairly subdued. Like most unfiltered wheat beers, this one's rather heavy and solid. It may not be frilly or challenging, but I found this one comfortable and a fine easygoing brew."
"Beer is harsh and has a horrible finish. Its not sweet or cloves / bananas in the midpalate. Just a thin mess of a beer. Nope, not enjoying."
"This beer is served with no head on it at all and a slight haze on what is essentially a nice golden body. The smell while pleasant isn't very potent if I do say so. The faint aromas are wheat, lemon, and a bit of earthy hop note. The taste is pretty darn good. As far as this style is concerned I consider it a standard bearer. The flavors are lemon, cardamon, wheat, fresh hop flavor that doesn't bitter in the slightest. There is a overall bready feeling to the beer. The mouthfeel is really nice on this beer it's just the right viscosity and it has a good carb, nothing great, but really good. Overall this beer drinks extraordinarily well for an APWA. It's a paramount of the style and my go to beer when there's really nothing else."
"Temperature is 60 degrees F, poured into standard American pint glass, color is slightly cloudy pale-gold, 1-finger head that dissipates quickly, and nothing special about lacing. Typical light wheat ale. Aroma is a tiny bit lemony and bready. Taste is not bad. It's wheaty and a little citrusy with very little aftertaste. Carbonation isn't overwhelming. Decent session beer."
"Drank from pilsner glass. Poured a clear straw color, one finger white head that receded quickly. Herbal notes, wheat smell, little bit of lemon...and some odd soapy/funky smell. Tasted bready, tart, some citrus, bitter at the end. Light to medium body with a crisp finish."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Hefe glass a bright golden hazy yellow with a pillowy soft white head. Not the typical head you see on some wheat beers this one faded rather quickly. Smell is of light citrus fruit notes with a bit of wheat yeasty esters. Taste is lemony, light, witha a small bit of wheat on the pallet. Mouthfeel is very light clean and crisp reminds me of Goose Island Summer ale with a twiste of wheat. Drinkability is very high on this beer very easy to drink."
"A friend mentioned it tasted different in the bottle than on-tap. As it stands I would not purchase in the bottle again, but would give it a shot on-tap if available and make a change to the review if it is better."
"D: An average tasting beer from a terrific brewery."
"D - A lighter craft beer that has body. Features crisp, refreshing hops. Not so much a pale as an over-hopped wheat without the banana/clove, which is probably why GI calls is an ""urban wheat"". A tasty summer afternoon session beer."
"Overall, I gave the drinkability a 3.5 but would've appreciated a stronger flavor profile. It came recommended and I would drink it again, but would be more likely to try something new."
"On tap at Midway Airport. Relatively clear with a golden yellow color. One finger white head that left healthy lacing. Some pepperiness but primarily graininess and grassiness. Good feel with ample crispness and carbonation. Overall a good wheat beer."
"D - Very clean, drinkable wheat beer."
"D - Very pleasant beer to enjoy especially in the summer. Also, would make a great session beer."
"It pours an opaque burnt orange with a one finger white head that fades to a ring and an island without lacing. On the nose it's a sourish, wet wheat base with some slight orange notes. On the tongue the slightly sour note is a center with some citrus notes and a decent amount of hop bitterness on the periphery. In the mouth there is a good deal of prickliness, but the body is quite light and pretty refreshing. This is certainly sessionable as it isn't overwhelming to any of the senses or to the skull. A decent beer to have around especially when it's hot."
"Notes - Just an easy drinking beer that doesn't have a lot of alcohol. I bought a keg of this for the 4th of July and it went down pretty well."
"Off in South Dakota there was little in the way of interesting beers so it's time to have a session beer. Lots of lemon, not quite to the point of alcopop but getting in the same area code. The tartness was a little surprising. Very easy to drink."
"I find this beer to be one of the better American wheats I have had so far. Often times many American wheats need lemon to add some semblance of flavor, but this has all the flavor you need right in the bottle. Pours a golden hugh with a nice lasting head. The carbonation is just right and adds to the refreshing side of the beer. Smells of cloves and citrus with a hint of banana. Initially the body seems to be very light, but thickens nicely as it goes down. Considering the well balanced nature of this beer it is very drinkable."
"D: Not quite tasty, but flavorful. Moderate"
"very nice drinkability, a great beer for the summer. one of the better american wheat ales out there. ill come back to this beer in the future."
"D: Could be one of my very favorites todrink from GI they master what a wheat beer should be. Very Drinkable."
"Putting that aside, the drinkability is still pretty good. It's still sort of light even though it's heavier than most wheats. It was not too hard to finish."
"Notes: There not much to say. It hits its mark as a basic Pale Wheat Ale."
"On tap at BW3 into a 16oz plastic cup, way to keep it classy...A light hazy gold with a decent white head, good retention...The aroma is light wheat, slightly skunky. The taste is boring as heck, skunky bite to it, light sweet wheat. Not sure why people think this is a good, a small step above a macro."
"Taste starts fine; light citrus and floral. Then the stale malt comes in. I'm not sure what this is, but I get it from BMC stuff a lot, but not this intense. It makes the aftertaste unbearable to me. Didn't finish this bottle."
"D - A session beer for sure. Nothing stopping me from having one after the another."
"Would go well with chicken."
"D - easy to drink and for the most part fairly refreshing."
"The mouthfeel is light and carbonation is moderate to above average. Drinkability is decent, it would be a good choice to drink a few in hot weather. It definitely went down easy, but just wasn't anything special overall. Decent beer overall, but not one of my favorite wheat beers."
"All in all, I wish it was a little more balanced. It seems to be very citrus-balanced, but it would have been nice to get more wheat out of this beer or at least something else other than just citrus. Oh well."
"Good brewing company, not so good of a wheat beer. My least favorite of the Goose island line.This just doesn't taste exciting, or anything like a traditional wheat beer."
"Light, crisp, refreshing, and a decent taste. On a hot summer day, you could drink this all afternoon long."
"Pours a one finger white head that vanishes, leaving no lace. Very pale, hazy yellow/green color. Light carbonation and very light bodied. Lemon nose. Flavor is more lemon than wheat some sweetness. Good session beer but needs more backbone. $1.95 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Drinkability - Mouthfeel and low ABV makes it easy to drink but the taste makes it hard to finish even one. I really didn't enjoy this one."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and quite refreshing. I would definitely consider having this again on a hot summer day if I was looking for something sessionable."
"M/D: The feel is good on this one, maybe it is a bit light bodied i.e. they should have left some more yeast in. For some reason I can't bring myself to drink more than one of these. Poor job from Goose Island. Thats too bad, usually their beers are really good."
"Eric"
"D - Well, I have to say this isn't an amazingly special beer to rush out and try, but I really like this one. This is a very easy drinker - refreshing, crisp, just a slight citrusy tartness, enough hops to balance and add to the crispness of the flavor. Good summer everyday drinker. I wouldn't go out of my way for this, but at the same time could easily be happy quaffing these on a regular basis. If there is a big sale on a case of these...I think I'll buy it. Otherwise, probably will come back to this for a 6er on an annual basis and move on to put other lighter favorites in the rotation."
"I poured into a pint glass to a couple fingers of white head. It actually left some nice lacing. This beer has a hazy, yellow color. It has a yeast and grassy smell to it. The taste has some yeast in there. It has a pretty clean finish and doesn't taste too bad on a hot summer day."
"Drinkability is ok, but would be a full point higher if canned and able to take out on the boat for a day of fishin'."
"D= very drinkable if you're not paying attention and just want a dependable beer for a sitting or a night. I've had this on-tap at their Wrigleyville location and it was a decent non-obtrusive ""talking beer."""
"It's crisp clean and perfect for hot summer days. I was wanting somethign in the finish as it seemed to just be flat, but all in all I would buy it again."
"D: Nothing special here, and the President could have given a much better beer to represent the US, or even GI in general."
"D- All tough it's not one of my favorite styles of beer I did enjoy this beer, I could probably only drink a few at the most."
"pours a nice hazy straw yellow color with an of white semi fluffy head..smell is some bananas and some clove with some nutmeg and other spices....taste was some citrus peel .clove ,fruit and spice but very average and weak..mouth feel was watery and light not alot for the taste buds to savor..overall an average wheat that goes down nicely on a humid mpls day..try it but not recommended"
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side, and it is crisp with good carbonation. Great drinkabilty during the summer."
"A tasty and refreshing wheat beer, great for warm weather. Would be easy to throw back a bunch. Excellent session beer."
"Notes: Can't help but describe this by comparing it to what it's not: it's not a hefe with banana and clovey flavors. It's a cleaner, clearer American version, with more hoppiness than yeastiness (if that's a word). Good for what it is -- an inexpensive (paid $2.99 for the bomber) summer quaffer."
"Had this on tap because it was all around Chicago in places that didn't have any other craft option, so thought it would be a good time to try it out. It pours a light straw-yellow colour with a thin white head. Smell is fairly muted, some faint lemon with wheat. Taste is subtle, but pleasant of citrus and wheat. Certainly not one of the better wheat beers I've had, but it is nice enough to order when the selection at the bar sucks."
"Pours a very hazy amber color without much of a head. Well there is a film of foam on the surface, but its not much for a head. Smell is fruity and spicy and just a tad malty but not bready. Taste is a little on the thin side, fairly smooth and one dimensional. Mouthfeel and drinkability are OK."
"D: Goes down very easy, an excellent example of the style, would be a great intro beer for a beginning BA or father in law. I could happily drink a six pack of this, especially with the alcohol level. At the same time, there would be nothing memorable about the experience. That's not a knock against the beer, it is the style."
"Drinkability - Overall not the most complex but it is very refreshing and a good beer for the summer heat."
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied and pretty drinakable. It has a nice crisp finish and is pretty refreshing."
"12oz. bottle served in a weizen glass at 49 degrees. Best by 04/28/10 indicated on the label. Poured a hazy, straw gold with a dense, frothy, 2.5 inch bright white head. Head eventually settles into a half inch cap with some residual strands of lacing revealed during the session. Nose is somewhat meh - some light cereal grains, maybe a hint of citrus. Taste follows nose - a little bland and watery; however, the wheat finally quality comes out. Pleasant mouthfeel; light-bodied with an easy carbonation and a clean finish. Nose and flavors are a bit lackluster, but the mouthfeel and sessionability help balance out other aspects. A pretty refreshing brew on a warm day."
"This is the quintessential example of an American Pale Wheat Ale in my opinion. Lovely straw color, mildly hazy, with a well formed and retaining white fluffy head. Bit of twang from the wheat, earthy and citrus hops, all in good balance. Bubbly carbonation, but not bitingly so. Fantastic drinker for everyday consumption."
"Overall a decent thirst quencher. Nothing real sexy but this style isn't really know for boldness. One thing is for certain. Gumballhead it ain't!"
"Overall, very easy drinking and refreshing if a bit ""plain Jane"" in the flavor department. A decent summer refresher."
"I have a feeling this six-pack won't stick around my fridge that long."
"D: I'm not big on wheat beers but this is a nice summer beer and could have more that one. Very sessionable beer."
"DB- Definitely sessionable. The lighter flavor and low price allow this. A subtle but balanced taste that is refreshing. Not a bad beer to drink on a hot summer day."
"Very nice looking color and clarity wise, just the head seemed to have little protiens holding it together so it didn't last long before forming a very thin band. light estery aroma, yeasty and bready flavors, with a nice refreshing amount of lemony hops and carbination giving it a clean mouthfeel making me drink this pint in just mins, as if i'm dying of dehydration and this is the first thing i've drank in days. Nope, just rode 5 hours."
"D: Very easy drinking and refreshing, great summer beer"
"pours a slightly cloudy pale yellow about a one finger white head that did hold well with a powdery sheet like lace. strong citrus aromas. taste is light and dry with lemon and a touch of spice and a light wheat malt. carbonation is crisp would have been better with a little more body to it. if your looking for lemon taste this is the one or orange taste it would be blue moon."
"Pours a hazy pale yellow with some bone white head that fades rapidly. Aroma is not too strong, lemons and some paler malt. Taste follows, pretty typical of the APWA, with a little more lemon to it than normal. A bit of yeast, wheat, and pale malt. MF is crisp and refreshing, light body with decent carbonation. Drinkability is good with the ABV, but the lack of strong flavors just makes this one not very interesting."
"D- This is not a stunner, but a very, very drinkable beer. I find it light and refreshing, I have found this style to be a good one for the summer sessioner."
"D- A good summer beer, but would opt for a different wheat beer in the winter if available."
"The bottom line is, there is really little reason to reach for 312 Urban Wheat when so many superior wheat beers are out there. Maybe I got a weird bottle... maybe not. Tough to recommend unless you're craving the lightest of the light craft wheat beers."
"I guess this would be good if I wanted something really cold and refreshing after I had worked up a sweat. It's something good to have around for people who aren't into craft beer. But I can think of better local things that cost less."
"A really nice wheat beer, not usually a fan of these beers, but this brought enough character to drink on a really hot day and enjoy."
"Poured into a hefeweizen glass. A nice golden amber color with a nice 2 finger white head. The head left a thin white head that clung to the sides. Consistent amounts of carbonation rose from the bottom with small amounts of sediment/yeast suspending mid beer. Aroma had a slight sweetness, and touches of white bread. Taste was clean, slightly sweet, with a small bit of citrus on the back end. Felt very good in the mouth. Nice and clean, slightly carbonated, coated well. Very easy to drink, definitely possible to session this beer."
"Light effervescence on the tip of the tongue, smoothish with a somewhat tangy finish, Malt, pepper and banana notes linger. Quite good, I think I'll have another."
"The taste is as expected, definitely a middle-of-the-road wheat ale. High level of carbonation leaves the beer feeling thinner than some wheats. No errors, but no complexity either. A good baseline wheat beer."
"Hazy pale lemon yellow brew could pass for lemonade, if not for the head. 3/4"" white head settles slowly to a thick layer. Leaves nice lace webbing throughout the tasting. Nose is mild... lemon and light malts, not much else. Taste is also pretty light... a bit bready, yeast, lemon, touch of caramel sweetness. Finish is crisp and dry with lingering flavors of lemon and soap. Mouthfeel is very light and refreshing, would be great on a hot summer day. Chuggable. Good for what it is... a light, refreshing, chuggable ale, and doesn't try to be anything else. I would get this regularly in the summer if it was available locally in a sixer and was priced reasonably."
"D - Very smooth and easy drinking. With the low ABV, this is a great session beer."
"D. Easily drinkable. This is a good beer to introduce the general public to craft beer. Tasty, but not really pushing any boundaries."
"312 Urban Wheat is a good all around American Pale Wheat Ale. It is thirst quenching and an easy drinker while soft and tasty in the flavor category."
"A beer that is too light in all aspects, with odd notes of dough and flour."
"Overall: They actually served this stuff for after the Chicago Marathon to the runners the year I did it! It didn't make sense then. Since then, I've tried this and and was quite pleased. Very easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Relaxing, easy to drink. Makes me think about sitting outside in a Chicago beer garden and having a few over the summer. Simple and easy to drink."
"A nice wheat beer that has some bitterness."
"Pours straw yellow, fine fluffy white head. Thousands of suspended particles show themselves as of the style. Smell is citrusy and a bit metallic. First taste is the same, unfolding into a wide malt base and a dagger-like hop finish. The taste is over before long. Feel is ok, a bit sour and drinkability ordinary. In the end, it actually tastes similar to straw.. An ordinary brew, but I'm not gaga for this kind of wheat ale."
"Drinkability: This is really an all-day kind of beer that's perfect for the warm summer months; crisp and light bitterness with that sweet malty aftertaste with really not much weight to the body, along with a really light ABV at 4.2%, this is really a beer that could be easily sessioned."
"Another so-so wheat beer. Just what the world needs more of. Mehhh..."
"D- High, although not very interesting. Good summertime beer, but I can think of a baker's dozen better wheats than this one. I doubt I'll buy it again."
"Overall: Not the most impressive token of this style, but a fair offering perhaps for a hot summer day. Wheat has a presence, though none of the flavors are complex and are ultimately forgettable."
"D- Highly drinkable. It is a good beer to transition people from macros to wheats and APAs."
"Drinkability? Well, I could certainly drink a few of these easily. A good quaffable American Pale Wheat Ale."
"(d) Overall, a great wheat, but there are plenty others that I would take over. (Upland, 3Flloyds) Good to drink on a hot summer day. (3/5)"
"Drinkability- This is where this beer shines. It wasn't the greatest choice for the cold weather but this beer would be perfect for a hot summer day! It is very crisp and refreshing and is the perfect session beer. Not my favorite example of the style but it is worthy of an occaisional buy when the weather is favorable."
"Not much to say, really, as it's not the most complex beer--everything feels a bit flattened out."
"D: A refreshing beer. But to me it's to little of exactly everything."
"Probably quite nice on a hot summer day!"
"This beer starts out really promising with its inviting appearance in the glass and pleasant wheat and lemon aroma"
"D: This beer would be a great summer beer as it provided easy drinkability and good wheat flavor. Good overall and affordable American wheat."
"Poured to a nice two fingered head that was white in color. Ale itsself was a very light yellow. Also had some floaties in it. Head hung around for a while. Had some lacing, but not alot. Was very light smelling. Just of maybe some lemon and slight malt. Tasted about like it smelled, very light. Then again that lemon and some malt. Not a lot of flavor going on. I stopped writing this review to let the ale warm up a little bit so see if I could get some additional flavor. But that didnt happen. Felt thin in the mouth. I thought maybe a little to much carbonation. Ive had other Goose Island products, and liked them. But I didnt think this one was for me."
"Mouthfeel grows, starts to take on other citrus flavors, keeps a degree of bitterness not usually associated w/ hefes. Quite drinkable, not at all boozy, good hot weather high humidity beer."
"The other aspects of this beer are great, but I can't really say that I'd die to drink this beer. In the end, it really doesn't do anything special for me. A very enjoyable beer to drink."
"D - For an American wheat it's pretty good it doesn't claim to be a Hefe like most other wheat beers so for what it is it's a damn good beer that's good and refreshing"
"Picked up a single at the Party Source in Syracuse. Bottled in September according to the label. The appearance is a pale hazy yellow with a short white head. This is basically a low-flavor summer beer. There's a little lemon and mild wheat bread, but it's otherwise very clean. It's probably good stadium beer. It's completely inoffensive and probably great on a hot sweaty day, I just wouldn't want to buy this."
"Served from a 12 ounce bottle. Pours a semi-cloudy medium golden, with a moderate head that shrinks to a thin layer of foam. Aroma lacks classic malty yeasty notes one would normally expect. There is a presence of lemon/citrus though. There's also a noticeable absence of malt/yeast on the palate, which is dominated by grapefruit and other citrus flavors. Mouthfeel is initialy pleasant, but there is an unpleasant lingering harshness in the sftertaste. Not an awful brew, but certainly not the most drinkable either."
"The taste really focuses on clean wheat flavors. There is a bit of yeasty breadiness in there but I like the fact that it does not try to be a hefe and really does a nice job of keeping yeast esters to a minimum. Nice hop balance, great carbonation, this is one of the best American wheat style beers I have had. A well balanced, easy to drink thirst quencher. Bueno!"
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a 1/2"" fizzy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry, pale and wheat malt scent along with little to no hop aroma and some light breadiness. The taste is decent as well. It has a crisp, wheat flavor with little malt character at all. It's light and refreshing with some prickly carbonation on the way down. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with a little too much CO2. This is your basic pale wheat beer. It's light and accessable with just a hint of citrus in the finish."
"Flavor is light wheat accented with apricot fruitiness. The beer's weakest link is the white bread finish with an acute bitterness that isn't necessarily welcome. Medium-light, somewhat creamy body with medium-high carbonation yields a solid mouthfeel. For a style with high drinkability, 312 doesn't set itself apart. A decent American wheat, but nothing too special."
"Color is a pale yellow, like straw, and lightly cloudy with a white head that disappears quickly. Aroma is grapefruit and orange, but on the tart side. Taste follows the nose beginning with a tangy-sweet citrus like sour orange leading into a bready malt with a hint of caramel. Body was light with medium to high carbonation. Overall, this offering was light and refreshing, although not my favorite style."
"Pours a hazy straw yellow color with a bubbly white head, smooth and creamy on the palate, medium body and carbonation."
"Poured into a tall bottle in a restaurant in Chicago yielded a pure golden yellow color with a pallet of fine foam and a hazy cloudy appearance. Toasted nuts, dried citrus, fresh bread, and spicy aromas. Body was a dry medium toasty bread followed by the crispy, fruity ale flavor delivered in a smooth, creamy body. Finish was a with a nice mix of nut and citrus stuff. A solid drinkable brew. Goes well with food."
"Drinkability- Amazing. A perfect sit back and chill beer. At 6.99 a 6 pack it's cheap and delicious. I'm definitely going buy more of these!"
"I may have found my standby/session beer in 312. Plus I'm supporting Chicago's economy and my roommate's investment in the Craft Brewers Alliance! It's a win-win"
"D-Sessionable brew."
"Drinkability; nice smooth brew. Session beer definately. I would put a 6er of this away over a lot of other wheat beers."
"Overall, this beer seems inviting with its nice label and pleasant appearance in the glass, but don't be fooled; when it counts, this beer falls flat."
"A solid drinkable brew. As good on tap as in the bottle and available everywhere. Reliable and tasty."
"Drinkability: A very decent wheat ale. The citrus is not overpowering. Like a less in your face sunset wheat. I could have several."
"Drinkability: Well, nothing here is offensive, but nothing is that enjoyable either. Pretty bland and boring. Maybe a good transition beer or one to have around to feed to BMC drinkers, but nothing I will seek out again."
"D= pretty decent. Nothing crazy or really delicious but if I'm woth buddies and I wanna drink something super light and crisp to match their miller lite this isn't a bad choice."
"Pours a hazy straw color with a thin white head. Decent retention and a nice lacing. Aroma is of floral hops and tangy fruits. Body is medium with a good amount carbonation. Taste is of sweet tart candy, with a lemony finish. Refreshing and easy to drink."
"Light and refreshing, how I like my APWA's, but just an average brew."
"The flavor of this beer is a balance of oranges and floral hops. I actually like the blend though it is a little thin. It has a nice bitter finish and leaves pretty dry. Overall its very drinkable. crisp and refreshing. I think it makes a nice summer beer -- perhaps even a good lawnmower beer if you have it available."
"Nice, easy drinking brew."
"Final thoughts: All in all a very light and pretty refreshing beer. It's a little awkward with all the strange sweet flavors and some not so pleasant bitterness on the finish. The carbonation is huge bubbles and it's not so pleasant that way. But it does finish pretty dry and it's a very light beer so it would be a great thirst quenching summer beer, but that's about all it's good for... or a palate cleanser between beers with more taste."
"I like it. 312 seems like a beer that crosses the rusticness of a wheat with the explosion of flavor that is a white. I've had better (read: more expensive) beer, but this is damn good. If you live in the Chicagoland area, where this stuff is like Fat Tire to us, it's definitely worth a look."
"Just a bad offering from Goose Island, who I have come to respect so much. I will stick to some Bourbon County Stout from now on, as this just doesn't compare to Goose Island's other offerings."
"Drinkability - Very mild beer, but not without its charm. Could certainly take the place of a macro on a hot summer's day. Nothing about this beer, however, would make me hunt one down."
"Overall a tasty brew, I would probably buy this again. Would work very well if it was hot out. Compared to a Pyramid haywire Which is similar i would get a 312 over that anyday"
"D- Would've been an easy session beer if I had more than one. Probably wont look for it again but glad I tried it!"
"D - Quite quaffable... Extremely sessionable at 4.2% ABV... A solid offering that stands out ever so slightly from the many wheat beers of summer which often tend to bore me... 312 has that little something extra to keep me interested and wanting more..."
"D - Easy to drink, could drink these all day with a wide variety of food. Nothing too crazy, but solid and somewhat enjoyable."
"Notes: Fits perfectly into the Pale Wheat Ale category. I haven't tried many from this style, but it is a nice alternative to a Hefe. A good balance of hops and wheat, but not so fruity like Hefe's. The flavors are nicely balanced."
"Had this on tap in suburban Chicago area, not far from the source. Golden color, similar to a pilsner, with creamy white head. Aroma was light, with subtle hops and herbaceous notes. Taste was also light, with relatively little of the fruit and clove flavor typical of a wheat beer. Drinkable and inoffensive, but nothing special. Best as a lawnmower beer."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with a modest head. Not a lot jumps out at you upon first smell, but what does is mostly lemon and clove but not lots of spice otherwise. This is a fairly light-bodied beer with great refreshing effervescence. The taste is a lot of grain with lemon squeezed all over it. The flavor is not particularly complex, but it's wonderfully balanced. Overall, it's a very agreeable American pale wheat that doesn't have a lot to write home about except for a lovable simplicity. It's definitely one to come back to, especially for those not terribly adventurous."
"This will be a great summer session beer. Reminds me of Southern Tier's 422 wheat, probably better."
"Notes: An excellent session beer."
"[resample;P-BO]"
"D: While I personally will never have this again, If you are a fan of Pale beers, or wheat beers, This could be very sessionable. A solid summer beer if you're into this genre."
"The taste mimics but doesn't live up to the smell. Tastes almost like this beer had lemon wedge dropped in. Very dry, a little sweet, a little sour. Very refreshing, but the more I drink the less special I feel it is. A few years back I was in Chicago in the summer and this was my favorite beer of the trip. Unfortunately not living up to memory."
"Hazy yellow color, poured on in a tall glass on a hot Chicago humid day. Smells of lemon and wheat. Tastes crisp, nice lemon flavor mixed with the wheat gives it the the taste of a lemon bar. Nice carbonation, easy to drink i order and drank a second."
"Pours bright golden with a 2-inch white head that settles slowly. The ale has a very slight haze and the haze aside, looks like a pilsner. The lacing is very modest. Hints of hops in the nose. Light on the palate. Light body. An unexpected, and to me undesirable after-taste. The unpleasant, but yet unidentified aftertaste lingers. Fortunately, the after taste is light as well. Carbonation is moderate. The wheat characteristics are barely perceptible. This is a light ale and may appeal to many for that reason. I find it a decent summer, quaffing beer, but wish it had more to offer than the pervasive lightness (carbonation, nose, body, and flavor)."
"312 Urban Wheat is pretty refreshing and smooth, and I can't really fault it any for drinkability. A decent choice for a lighter, summery wheat ale."
"D: This beer looks great, but the rest doesn't match up. The flavor is too subdued for my tastes. Not macro subdued mind you; just overly light. The low ABV; however, makes it go down quick and quite suitable as a summer yard work beer."
"Super easy to drink. Light, crisp, refreshing beer that was made for summer. Nice session beer."
"Nice one inch bubbly head. Color is yellow like pineapple juice, little floaties all over. Their is a faint hop smell coming off of it not much else. Taste is wattery not much flavor, i am not really tasting the hops that i smelled and was hoping for some citris. I take that back, i just burped and it tasted like the hops i was smelling. This has slightly more flavor then a macro and has a high drinkability because the low abv and not too strong of flavors. Not recommended."
"This is my first Goose Island product and I must say I was impressed. It tastes really good, is refreshing, and is very easy drink. I will be buying some again as soon as I can. I have absolutely fallen in love with this beer. This may soon be my go to beer after Killian's Irish Red."
"Drinkability: Pretty good for a summer day. Nice example of an American Wheat."
"Pours a nice hazy golden color with a white foam head that leaves quickly, Wheat and light citrus notes come on the first whiff. The taste is pretty good crisp wheat, some amarillo hops that give just a small amount of lemon zest, a dry finish that has a medium mouthfeel and a good after taste. Very drinkable could drink quite a few no problem , those 12 ounces went very quickly."
"3.5 D: Very smooth the whole way through. I find most APWAs extremely drinkable and this is no different. Tasty enough to make another a good idea."
"Drinks very well, it's pretty refreshing but being sessionable isn't out of the ordinary at 4.2%. Solid."
"This is really nasty beer. Like any bad beer, when it's really cold it's drinkable, but as it warms up - even just a little bit - the true profile comes through. This stuff needs to be near freezing to drink. Mouthfeel is grainy, taste is like stale wheat bread floating in Busch Light with a couple drops of lemon. It smells like a pile of decomposing grass clippings. Choking one down may be impossible, and after that you will not want another. I know this beer well, unfortunately, because as one other reviewer noted it is ubiquitous at Chicago street fests and bars. The smell coming off of dozens of pre-poured cups of this crap, and the pools of foamy 312 slop on the ground at outdoor beer tents is really nauseating. My neighbor presented me with a 12 pack for watching his cat, and it has been sitting by my front door for four months, which is somewhat vexing. But, I can't bring myself to just throw it out, because after all, it is technically beer. If anyone wants it, come by and you can have it for free. As The mighty Killdozer sez: ""I'd rather drink from the dick of a goat!"""
"Poured 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass, yellow body that produces a short head, that after some time turns into a thin white ring atop the beer. It smells of lemons and wheat. Taking my first swig, 312 tastes of malts, some more of that lemon, and very refreshing on a nice summer evening. MF is not too stimulating, but its basic crispness does fine for the style of the beer. Drinkability is there, great session beer. Very good American wheat."
"The mouthfeel was pretty good and it was definitely drinkable, but it did let me down a bit."
"Has a kind of dirty blonde color with good head retention. Smell was good. I usually get disappointed with wheat beers in their taste, and only have found a few that really create a satisfying wheat taste. This is one of them that do that. It's got a very robust flavor with just the right about of wheat malt to be present yet not overpowering. It feels great going down and is easy to pick up a second."
"Drinkability: A great drinker for the summer season. Basic flavors make a great session brew. I would drink a lot of these."
"Drinkability - One was enough. I wouldn't do a session with this one. Not great, but not terrible either. A solid midde-of-the-road wheat beer."
"On the thin side, especially for an unfiltered wheat. Lightly creamy and smooth, but a little watery. Too light in body to make this particularly desirable. Were it more crisp it might be refreshing, but the light body and round palate don't make a good combination here, at least as far as I'm concerned. I'm a pretty big fan of American pale wheat ales, and 312 has seriously let me down."
"D. Its drinkable. Not much flavor going on. Overall pretty bland."
"D= A solid example of the style, but had a little too much sulfur in it for me. Definitely sessionable."
"This beer pours a slight hazy golden yellow with a thin white head. Nose is of light pale malts, slightly grainy and a faint yeasty bread smell. Taste is a nice spicy possibly piney hop flavor with mild wheat that follows. Medium mouthfeel, decent carbonation, clean and crisp - goes down easily. This is a pretty average beer. The malts and hops are well balanced - but I am hard pressed to point to anything to REALLY say that it's wheat. It's highly drinkable but not very distinct."
"Nothing too special about this wheat ale, though it's still drinkable enough and serves its intended purpose on a hot summer day."
"I'm not a fan of wheat beers and this one proves it for me. Almost flavorless seltzer water in my opinion. I imagine the drinkability should be high with such a light, flavorless beer, but I'd have a hard time getting down anymore than one of these."
"Very drinkable - I really like this beer."
"D- Wanted to like this beer but it has some nasty flavors and smells goin on."
"Slightly sweet smell, lemon citrus, and some spice. Sweetish flavor, citrus fruit, some yeast kick it a nice spice kick at the end. Light, refreshing, palate cleansing. Very good drinkabitilty (it was a hot day), went down very easy. A great summer beer."
"D: Clean, light, refreshing. Good summer beer."
"Cheers!!!"
"Not exactly ""hazy"" like most wheat beers. 312 leaves behind thousands of little clumps of yeast which isn't exactly appetizing, but it won't slow down my consumption. Despite very lively carbonation, the head never amounted to much. Very nice aroma showcases some citric hops. The taste is a great conglomeration of the gently used hops, refreshing wheat malt, and yeast. Definitely a quality Midwest wheat beer."
"Poured a hazy pale yellow with a white head. Temperature seemed slightly too cold, but not complaining. Aromas were mild - yeast, bread, slight lemony citrus and wheat. Mouth-feel was better than I remember (tap vs bottle perhaps). Tastes were of wheat, yeast, mild citrus hop with hints of lemon, some earthy notes as well."
"this is a good wheat beer, interesting enough and definitely quaffable enough to make it sessionable or down right refreshing on a hot day"
"My advice would be to serve this at a BBQ. It would appeal to the masses. Not packed with flavor, but interesting enough. The definition of ""refreshing."""
"Hazy golden wheat look, not much on the nose, it has a freshness and soft wheat taste, lack of hops doesn't help. A bit weak, I guess that's what goes for you at 4.2%. This is a summer quaffer, not much more, it grows on you though, as good as any others - I'm not a big Oberon fan either, leave these for the challenged beer sippers."
"22ozBottle. A slightly hazy golden color whit a two finger white lasting head. Aroma is a little lemon grass,some light bready yeast, and a touch of spice,very faint banana.Flavor is subtle, light wheat malt,some faint citrus fruit,bubblegum and a little bready yeast, some sort of light spice notes but all very balanced and subtle. Very drinkable, a geed summer and session brew."
"312 is one of my favorite session beers. It hits all the marks you're looking for in an American wheat beer. Mellow, easy drinking, flavorful but not overbearing. I love this stuff. I find it's better on tap and I have had batches that taste very different but never bad. Good stuff, I'd be happy to drink this all the time."
"The only non positive about 312 is it doesn't give a person much clue by the smell as to what it is about, other than that, this is one good, smooth drinking sessionable beer. Very wheaty and you can see this in the glass, all kinds of wheat particles floating in the glass. Very clean, almost sweet, but not cloying and highly refreshing. Great beer for the spring and summer."
"Basically a by-the-book chill-out wheat beer. It's refreshing, no doubt, but not really distinguishable beyond. Not bad, tasty really, just not memorable."
"Pours a pale yellow with a fluffy white head. The smell is slight lemon and grass with a bready aroma as well. The taste is light and refreshing. Its doughy and grassy with a tart lemon finish. Its not overly flavorful but the mouthfeel isn't too thin and it is incredibly drinkable. I could drink these all summer long and at the low price I think I might try. This is a great rendition of the style and a great offering from a great brewery. I always expect great things from them and they never let me down."
"M & D - Very light mouthfeel...finishes dry with no aftertaste. I can see that this would make for a very sessionable brew in the summertime. I'm pretty sure a cooler full of these would never get old. As a matter of fact, I might just give that a shot to make sure I'm right."
"Overall, I would recommend this more highly as a summer beer. It isn't particularly complex though it is probably better than your average wheat beer and definitely more refreshing."
"Future outlook: Good. Not a wheat fanatic, but this was a very pleasant change of pace. I can see grabbing some of these for a summer night of pounding beers when the weather heats up."
"Overall impression: A refreshing, easy drinking American wheat ale. Perfect for the return of spring in Central Ohio. Not something I would choose all the time but a well crafted beer."
"D- Easy to drink with no standout flavors. A decent beer that may have been lacking just a bit on wheat flavor as compared to other wheats and lacking in hops compared to other APAs."
"Vs. the style, this beer is very smooth. Nothing about is overwhelming. Just the right citrus touch. Unfiltered but yet very clear, some yeast sediment on the bottom. It has a good appearance. Wheats usually have a very strong distinct smell but this only has hints of a traditional wheat ale. Considering the drinkability and soft, well balanced flavors, one might think it would be a bit watered down but that is not the case at all. A good beer."
"D - Pretty easy to drink, for sure."
"Poured into a ""tall"" pint glass as recommended on the bottle, this brew has an unusual light yellow transparent color with a weak thin white head. The brew has this strange quality that when it settles and sits on my table is seems to have ""suspended"" yeast that just sits throughout the beer? The aroma is of lemon, yeast, and some light malts. The taste is ok. Not sure what to think of it, carbonation is decent, lighter brew with a hop finish that I was not expecting. I could drink a few of these, but more because they are light and crisp, rather than being a fully satisfying brew."
"D: Very drinkable beer in a very drinkable style. A good American wheat."
"Lots of carbonation, but not that prickly. Light bodied and easy drinking. A thirst quencher, certainly."
"Overall I think this is a solid beer. I don't drink too many wheat beers, not because I don't like them I just like others better I guess. This one however I would come back to. Goose Island does a really good job"
"Although I respect other peoples' opinions and reviews, I'm surprised this one did not get better ratings."
"D: I like a Wheat beer once in a while but this would not be a go-to."
"I dont see what the big deal is with this beer. I picked up a bomber at my local Kroger thinking this was going be a game changer. I was wrong. It is refreshing, dont get me wrong. It is very clear, akin to a bud or miller. The wheat profile is weak and unpronounced. No hops to speak of. I could drink a number of these on a hot summer day I think. So what is all the fuss about? Maybe this is the ""gateway"" beer my high school teachers were warning me about.."
"MF&D - Light and refreshing. Not too big in the taste department, but I could see this one as a decent summer session brew."
"Easily my least favorite GI beer, 312 is so middle-of-the-road that it makes me a little sad. It's just sorta there, which could lead to downing multiples with no problem. Doesn't mean that I want to, though."
"Makes winter a little harder to take. I'll definately be putting back more of these come July."
"Still, I'm impressed that Goose Island has so many beers to I find very drinkable, and they are able to do it in large quantities."
"Normally I don't like wheat beers that are this light in color, but this one is ok. It almost leans in the direction of a Belgian White beer, but not quite. Definitely sweeter than that."
"It's a very refreshing beer that looks as good as it tastes."
"Poured into a 312 pilsner glass I picked up on my last trip to the brewery. Pours a cloudy but bright gold color with a half finger of head. Light lacing on the glass. Smells very lemony and citrusy. Taste is also very citrusy, lemon and orange under a wheat body. Very light mouthfeel, very refreshing. Very drinkable, my favorite summer beer. Hard for a beer to be more drinkable than this one IMO."
"(If you like this beer, try Magic Hat's Circus Boy)"
"D. This is an solid, flavorful beer with a lot of body given the style. This is the standard by which all american pale wheats should respect."
"6/4/7/4/14 (3.5/5)"
"Pours a clear yellow with short head (1/5 inch) and poor retention. Only very slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, wheat, and a bit similar to light lager. Fits the style pretty well. Tastes of sweet wheat malts and is very smooth. Relatively sweet and easy to drink. A hint of fruit (lemon probably). Overall, a little weaker body than I would have liked, but very smooth and easy to drink."
"This was another great beer from goose island. The color was a light copper color with a little haze. the aroma was nice and yeasty but with a hop backbone. The flavor was hoppy with a great taste of yeast. I could put back a bakers dozen of these on a hot summer day. great effort."
"Overall: it is an okay beer Goose Island has made better beer than this. It has a nice flavor that is thin and unrefined."
"Nice summer beer for outside gatherings, as most wheat ales are.."
"D- What can I say. Not only is this a crazy drinkable beer but it is also a crazy drinkable wheat ale. Not all wheats are the same. Some are very bad. 312 is a simple delicious drink."
"This guy is pretty damn drinkable. A great session beer."
"This is one of those wheat beers that just tastes like a generic wheat beer to me. Right up the lines of what I'm looking for, but still (and in keeping with the style), a little bland. Appearance and head were a little weak, but otherwise, it's just as you'd expect - lots of wheat, a hint of yeast, and a good amount of citrus flavors as well. A highly sweet beer, with a slightly thin body. Overall, not bad, but not particularly memorable either."
"This pours a cloudy golden color with a nice beige head. The nose has a good amount of wheat malts, citrus fruits and some unique herbs. The taste is also strong of the interesting herb and hop profile and well balanced by sweet yet tart citrus and wheat. Crisp body goes down easy. A tasty wheat."
"Overall I'd say it's a solid but not spectacular example of a wheat ale."
"I had this beer in Chicago while visiting Lollapalooza last summer. In my opinion, it had a little bit of a metallic taste. Other than that it was enjoyable. I also tasted a few fruity notes as well. (the good kind, i liked that.) The first time I had Goose Island and not my last."
"Solid GI offering. Their mass produced offerings continue to not overly impress, but never underdeliver."
"This is my favorite wheat ale. A pleasant citrus smell is the first thing you notice when opening it. It pours a nice golden color with acceptable head but that quickly dissipates. The taste is citrus and hops with a perfect clean finish with no after taste. Quite nice during hot months of the year. This beer is perfect for a summer BBQ. Any fan of mass market beers should give this a shot as it could be the bridge to craft beers with its good but not heavy taste."
"D- Quite enjoyable. The increased hoppiness in an american wheat is interesting."
"drinkability is good. this is a solid pale wheat ale, with a wonderfully fresh profile and a good composition. a huge improvement from the bottled version. there is no staleness or over-sweetening going on here, which tends to plague the lighter styles. a good starter brew at the brewpub. cheers!"
"D: Since this beer isn't as bitter as most pale ales and has a very even taste with a smooth feel. Would be a very good hot afternoon beer to relax and have a few."
"Comment a fairly easy drinking beer with some mild flavors. Nothing I'd seek out myself, but I'm not a big wheat fan either."
"D: High. This would be great for an afternoon in the summer heat or out on a boat."
"Pours a cloudy light gold in color. About a half inch of head on the pour, but it's quickly gone. Smell is spicy, but off slightly. Taste is hoppy, but rather BMC'ish. Highly carbonated in the mouthfeel. Refreshing, but not good enough to warrant another purchase."
"Go Cubs!"
"Notes: A fair alternative to mass market beers but I will not likely order this again. It is just too forgettable to be ordered again. It tastes too much like mass market beers to justify the price of a craft beer."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I have had many sessions with this beer, and will have many more in the future. It stands well on its own or with a variety of foods."
"I would drink it but not buy it again, I could easily kill a six pack of it because of the smooth mouthfeel."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, very mild kick, decent representation of style, this is definitely one of your typical lawnmower/BBQ beers because it's light, kind of refreshing and very easy to pound down. However, it's not the first lawnmower/BBQ beer I would choose."
"Not much doing with this beer, no bad aspects but nothing spectacular either. Aroma is a mellow wheat with an ever so slight citrus scent. Nice appearance, hazy golden yellow with a good white head, very crisp. Mouthfeel is full and clean. Flavor is basically standard for an American Wheat. It is enjoyable but I really wanted more out of this beer."
"Pours a hazy corn color with a two finger white head that dies down to absolutely nothing. Some stickiness here and there on the sides, but what is there doesn't last long. Smell consists of wheat, sugar, and corn. Some kettle corn popcorn and a touch of lemon citrus in the nose as well. I could use more hops in the aroma, please? Taste begins pretty pale and bland. Grains and some zesty lemon with a faint wheat backbone. The flavor seems to be pretty watered down overall with a very empty aftertaste. Fluffy and soft feel with a light body. Steady carbonation which makes this fairly refreshing. Once again, if this is an ale I could use more hops. I guess I enjoy Hop Sun and Gumballhead too much to really get into 312. With Hop Sun all over the place in CNY, this will be a one and done for me. Thanks for the opportunity Josh."
""
"Pours a hazy yellow/ gold color, with a white head. In the aroma, a light dry wheatiness. In the taste, clean, small wheat presence. Quite watery and bland. A smooth, light mouthfeel, and a small dry citrus in the aftertaste. Mostly bland and watery, felt like a watered down wheat."
"Na Zdravje!"
"D-Obviously if you give me one I would drink it buy I doubt I would buy again. Once again can easily be used as a session beer due to its ease of consumption."
"D: I could sip on these all day long or pound them long into the night. A very approachable session ale."
"Whoa, very little floating particles for a wheat! How appetizing! Nice straw yellow color clouded a little bit. I am not impressed with the smell, as it reminds me of a wet morning in a cornfield. Acidic flavor, compounded by strong wheat flavor. Has a note of apple. The texture is light yet full, begging you to take another sip. I wouldn't like much more than a few more sips. There are more complex and appealing wheats out there."
"Not a bad little summer session beer. I could easily knock back a bunch of these on a hot day. Good thirst quencher."
"D- I guess if you are really thirsty you could drink alot of these. I'll pass on this one."
"A crisp and refreshing beer, lacks on flavor but has a nice tingly carbonation on the tongue. Average outdoor summer brew and easy to drink."
"This has a a nice juicy/spicy flavor profile and a low abv...fits perfectly as a summer beer..."
"I think the key to appreciating this beer is to pretend its not really a wheat ale, as the appearance and taste lack some of the distinctive characteristics of citrus, clove, and the nuances of unfiltered wheat. The strength of this brew is better understood as an alternative to American macrolagers-- clean, crisp, drinkable, and moderate flavor without the defects of macros. There isn't anything wrong with 312, its just not a noteworthy wheat ale. I think it would be a great gateway to craft beers for macro drinkers."
"Pours a very nice dark straw/yellow color, with good head and nice lacing (for a wheat beer). The scent and taste were both extremely wheaty, with very little else. Most wheat beers have a citrus or clove flavor, but this one went all out on wheat. It's interesting, and very good as well."
"This is my ultimate lawnmower beer. Skip adding an orange slice, this baby has a beautiful delicate balance that should be enjoyed as is."
"Also grabbed this while celebrating with friends. Clear, dark golden body with little head; patches of white foam hide on the perimeter. Fairly decent grassy malt nose, sweetness that certainly comes through in the taste, but is moderately offset by more hops than I anticipated. Nice texture, surprisingly fresh when finishing considering the limp to start, making up for a lot. Pretty decent beer to session, but one that Goose Island should do much more with. More of a decent, straight-up macro than Goose Island typically offers. Not bad, though."
"Solid for what it is. If I live in the area, I think I'd keep this around for a lawnmower brew."
"D - Nothing to offend. A very drinkable beer."
"Not bad, but not that great either, nothing really jumps out at you with this beer."
"Pours out a pale straw color and a little head, some sediment. Then I changed to a tall glass, as recommended on the bottle, and got two fingers of head and a cascade of bubbles. That was better. It smells of hay and hops. The taste is citrusy, specifically lemony, and somewhat bready. In the mouth it's crisp and fizzy, and overall was quite tasty and refreshing. I was happy with it."
"Not a bad beer, but nothing great."
"Pours a slighty hazy light copper gold color with a big, fluffy white head that becomes a film with a bit of lacing. Mild citrus aroma. Light taste with wheat, citrus, and a slight bit of sweetness at the finish. Light- to medium-bodied and generally smooth with moderate carbonation. A decent beer worth trying, but it doesn't quite catch my attention."
"There's some fruit on the nose, but nothing too interesting. I was thoroughly underwhelmed by the taste. With a wheat beer, I'm expecting some notes of fruit, solid wheat flavor and maybe some clove. This beer had none of those. Frankly it tasted a lot like a slightly better version of Miller Lite. Just very very little going on. I guess I could drink several of these, but I wouldn't want to with all the other options out there."
"good carbonation. smooth light body. good beer. i would drink this again. i will try it on tap the next time i am out."
"Drinkability is nice. Very smooth wheat beer with a nice feel. Nothing incredibly about this beer, but very solid pale wheat ale that is a great standard for its category."
"OK beer but not a great one. Think I will be reaching for any good lager before this one again."
"This beer is too easy to drink and enjoy with as many friends, beer appreciative or not, or by yourself."
"Coming from Goose Island, I had expected more."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Appearance is a clear straw yellow with a finger of puffy bone-white foam that quickly dissipates to a light ring of lacing. Scent is weak and watery, light wheaty spiciness present, grain and malt notes lingering. Taste is also light and watery, more of the same light wheat and graininess, light malty undertones. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate levels of carbonation, washes down easily. Drinkability is superb, lack of character and complexity make this an ideal summer thirst-quenching beer. Fair representation of the style, lesser breweries have managed to create far better examples for equal or lesser price to the consumer. Wouldn't necessarily seek out again, but by no means a bad beer."
"D- despite its shortcomings, lightness of body, mild flavor, and low abv skyrocket the D score as far as i'm concerned, and from the 330, this 312 is A-OK."
"Pale straw yellow with a big white head. Fairly clear for an unfiltered wheat. Just a little sediment in the bottom of the bottle. Usual citrus smell that you expect with a wheat, with a little banana. Nothing special about the flavor. Well balanced, but kind of bland. Not bad, just boring. Medium carbonation with light body. Drinkable because it doesn't taste bad, but nothing I look forward to when thinking about having another."
"There is not much to this beer. The appearance of this beer is about the best part. It has a really nice golden yellow color, with a thin white head on it not much retention. There really is no smell to this beer and the taste is very light. It does go down very smooth and I could drink a lot of this beer on a warm summer day. Other than that I can't really see any reason to keep this beer in my collection."
"Drinkability - Gave me a little gas not too drinkable."
"D - Not impressed. Won't be buying this again."
"Tasted on 3/15/08."
"I am dissapointed with this beer. As far as aroma and taste go, there is no depth, and it is light and fizzy in the mouth. Goose Island has so many better beers than this."
"I've tried the 312 a couple of previous times but have recently started reviewing. Poured a cloudy straw color finger width of straight white head. Some lacing as it dissapated. Still learning as far as describing aromas and flavors but regardless I'm just not impressed. Huge fan of Goose Island and a fan of quite a few American wheat ales but this just isn't doing it for me."
"Pours a hazy, pale yellow with a thin white head. It had some descent lacing, thinly covering the sides of the glass. Its nose had up front notes of wheat, and in the back hints of banana and lemon. Taste is light and refreshing, definitely not bold. Notes of light hops with grassy undertones. Mouthfeel is nice, perfect for early spring! High carbonation and refreshing as stated before. Good beer from a great Chicago brewery."
"I can't hardly wait for the hot days of summer to try this beer, it isn't the best wheat beer that I've had but it's right up there. The appearance was a little disappointing, being a bottle conditioned beer I was expecting it to be a little more cloudy. But the flavor and aroma made up for it, both being slightly sweet and citrusy. It feels very good on the tongue, with nothing being very over powering, this is definitely a fine session beer for a hot day anywhere."
"Not terribly bubbly or bright despite its mild, watery nature. Kind of just matted and dull throughout with a starchy, dry finish. Nothing too special at all actually. I guess it would be a somewhat refreshing beer for summer time but I was just plain unimpressed."
"Very light while retaining a nice, though far from complex, flavor. Pretty good."
"Appears hazy pale golden with a large foaming bright white head, leaves behind speckled lacing. Aroma sharp wheat notes mild grassy wheat note definitely an American Pale wheat I don't get why the bottle states it's so important to pour into a tall glass. Flavor is pretty bland yeast gives bread notes wheat gives a mild acidity, and there's really no citrus just a smooth flow of malt and wheat sweetness with that tartness to balance it out. Mouthfeel is smooth with some spritzy carbonation noted on the palate, light bodied refreshing overall. Drinkability is easy going definitely a summer time beer one for hot balmy days."
"It has an average color and smell, but an above average taste. I understand if you wouldn't want to bring some home, but in the majority of restaurants and bars out there you can't go to wrong by choosing this one."
"Pours a sickly pale, cloudy yellow in a Weizen. Smell is obvious of wheat and big on a light citrusy lemon smell as well and is overall quite nice. Taste is wheaty, somewhat tart and lemony, and I can swear I taste the alcohol in this 4.2% beer though... Very thin, watery, and somehow tastes a bit boozy. I actually like wheats, but this wasn't worth revisiting."
"Retired? Shame."
"The taste is a tad strange. I will have to think about this to be completely objective. There is an interesting hop blend in this beer. It is refreshing to drink. Not real strong or rich tasting; rather watered down. Overall easy to drink; geared toward summer."
"Drinkability- It was alright. I would not go out of my way to get it again."
"Drinkability - Ugh. This is the third GI beer I have sampled, and I expected a lot more than what this beer delivers. It drinks down okay, but the flavor and scent aren't very good."
"Easy to drink, I may try it again as the weather gets warm. Actually would rather have a Budweiser, than this."
"Overall: Pretty disappointing. Glad I drank it as it was taking up valuable space in my beer fridge. It is not one of the better Goose Island offerings, though that is to be expected because those come in the black and white bottles."
"Once again I don't understand why this won a GABF medal, but much of the rest of their lineup is quality and even awesome in nature."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tall pilsner-like glass resulting in a storng frothy two fingured head sitting upon a clear golden body with a slight chill haze. There's signifigant yeasty biscuty aroma eminating from my glass. Aross your tounge you get a clean wheaty flavor mixed in hints of spice and lemon. 312 end up being simple subitle and easy drinking. This is a good crossover beer and a great way to highlight wheat and yeast in beer. With all of the wheat ales out there this just dosent quite add up for me."
"This beer pours well, pale yellow with a nice head that stays around for a while. It smelled very wheaty and citrusy. 312 tastes citrusy and a bit watery, with a lot of wheat after-tone heavy wheat...can't really detect the hops very well. Overall, it is refreshing and very easy to drink."
"12 ounce bottle, best before 02/24/08. Single bottle purchased at Blacklick Wine and Spirits for $1.29. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy straw gold color with a half inch white head. Head retention is low, lacing is OK. Aroma is very wheaty with a little bit of lemon. Taste is the same as the aroma, it's mostly wheat with a little bit of lemon. It does taste pretty good, it's sweet but not too sweet. It's also the ""wheatiest"" wheat beer by taste that I've had. Mouthfeel/body is light, with a little above average carbonation. It's also crisp and smooth. Drinkability is pretty good, I could drink this all night long. It would be very sessionable on a nice summer day, especially with the low ABV. Overall I think this is a pretty decent, sessionable wheat beer. Not bad at all!"
"had about two of these and moved on but will return."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Big fan of the ""wheat's", but this was very disappointing. Looks like a standard APWA, and the smell is fairly uninspiring. But the taste, from first drink to last, is poor. Citrus, tart, bitter...all come through far more than the wheat. No thanks."
"One can drink these with buddies who have never had a wheat beer and they'd be none the wiser...a session beer perhaps...good for card games...light easy-going...This reminds me of a blonde...not alot going on upstairs...but beautiful to look at nonetheless..."
"This was a light beer and enjoyable to drink. Probably better in the hot days of summer when it is cool and you are warm."
"Served on tap, minimal head, clear, straw color. Smell is wheaty with some lemon. Taste is the same, very lemony, some spicyness as well. The mouthfell was pretty light almost watery, but not horrible. I really cant beleive how fast and easy this went down. Overall its a good tasting beer nothing special, a little light in body, but would make a good session beer."
"Overall- Just too watery."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't rate it as a great Weisse beer nor would I say that it's a bad one. I just wouldn't go out of my way to purchase any, but if someone would give me more I wouldn't turn it down."
"Drinkability: As far as wheat beers go, this is a very drinkable one. I drank this a lot this summer. I guess you could call it a nice summer session beer. I don't think I'll crave it in the colder months as it is a little too light for the Minnesota winter."
"Refreshing, has some substance for a mass produced beer, and is turning BMC drinkers into almost craft drinkers. That ain't bad. Beer is mass produced and cheap, but for your buck you can't do much better at the local big chain supermarket."
"ng"
"Pours a cloudy yellow liquid with a white head that slowly fell leaving a little lacing. The aroma was fruity (lemon and banana, maybe?) and slightly grassy. The taste was similar with a little wheat in there. Mouthfeel was fine but carbonation was light. Sessionable on a warm afternoon."
"Pours a cloudy yellow color with a foamy white head that lingers around on top of the glass. Smell is lemony and wheat smells. Some spice, but very little in the nose. Taste is wheat and a little grains, some light spice flavors too. Mostly a light nice wheat beer."
"Pours from the bottle to a copper color with thin off-white head that lingers well and leaves good lacing ont he glass. Aroma is a mixture of grassy-floral hops, and the flavor follows suit. Mouthfeel is non-exciting, probably due to the low carbonation. This leads to a finish that is at first satisfying, but that quickly fades to stale grass. Not a bad beer, but not nearly as good as a couple others Ive had from this little start-up brewery."
"One of the more impressive summer-wheat beers I've had so far."
"served on-tap, this was a golden, mostly clear straw in color. i really could not pick up too much aroma-wise, maybe some lemony and bready notes. taste is mostly of lemony tartness with a hint of sweet wheaty malt. mouthfeel is actually pretty good, i almost expected this to be watery for a 4.2% beer but it wasn't. drinkability is good considering the tart crispness and light body of this beer. definitely a summer beer as the name suggests."
"312 is meant to be light and refreshing with maximum flavour, and that's what it is. the low ABV makes it a perfect summer quencher which allows it to be sessionable and a nice match for summer grilling grub. i liked it and hopefully it will be a summertime staple in future years."
"Drinkability: A nice summer quaffer"
"Hazy first morning piss look with minimal head and lacing. Smell was a bit cellarish at first then pledge(lemon). Small floaters that stayed in a nice tight pattern. mouthfeel was medium to light which is pretty typical for this style. Taste was citrus with a bit of wonderbread and kisses of spice. This is a good summer beer but I prefer a little more personality. Forgettable but not regrettable."
"Nicely done wheat beer. The paleish yellow color was just average and there was very little lacing in the glass. This was spiced just right to produce a zesty, wheaty and citrusy aroma and taste that was very refreshing. The flavors were very well-balanced. This is an ideal summer beer."
"A cloudy pale yellow, almost pissy, with lots of tiny suspended particles. The head is a finger or so and the lacing is minor. I pick up a distinct honey aroma mixed with some lemon and dank well water. The taste is tart , wheaty with some biscuit. It is pretty thin, drinkable enough, probably a refreshing choice in general. Some cracker & citrus noted in the front. Trying this right after an iipa was probably not the most fair condition so I will be happy to sample again, but generally this isn't my favorite variety and seems a bit too tart to rate highly on my list."
"This is an easy dinking beer. Something I can give to everyone to enjoy."
"Just had this beer again....Just wanted to say this beer is great on a hot day!"
"Overall a good, but there's nothing special about this beer happening. A good utility beer for the summer months where refreshment is as high of a priority as enjoyment. I did enjoy the fine carbonation to this beer though."
"Pours a nice hazy golden color with a decent head that dissipates quickly into lacing. Nice smell of wheat and citrus. The taste, mostly wheat and citrus, is pleasing. Decent mouthfeel, not crisp, not watery. A good beer that is a little light, but a good fit for warmer weather."
"D: Yes, this is drinkable - like a chilled lemonade is drinkable. Low alcohol, good flavors and aroma...just wish it had a little more 'oomph' to it, so it wasn't so weak/lackluster in the mouth. A good summer beer, a 'thirst quencher' (if there's such a thing with beers), but ultimately not one I'd want to have more than one, maybe two, of before either shutting it down or moving on."
"Drinkability: no problems .... but nothing to knock your socks off either. Sure, give it a try.... it's a nice safe summer-time wheat beer... But, I've had better... both Franziskaner and Weihenstephaner are much preferred over this one."
"D - With pizza in the summer, this would be pretty good I think. Overall a nice example of the style."
"312 Urban Wheat Ale was a hazy pale yellow color with a white head. The head didn't last long, but did leave a little lacing behind. The aroma was light malt with a little lemon. The taste was citric with some wheat malt and a dry finish. It was light bodied and a little watery. Drinkability was good. Overall It's just another boring wheat beer."
"Drinkability: a nice summertime beer that quenches your thirst even thought there is a bit of graininess in the body. Nice beer to have on tap minus the lemon."
"I poured this bottled beer into a pint glass. A decent white froth formed with some lacing on the side of the pint glass, but did not last very long. The beer has a yellow color, and unexciting smell. Overall this is a pretty average beer, but a good buy for the price."
"Poured into my Weizen glass the ale look a brilliant hazy yellow. Definitely some particulate. Moderate carbonation drifts up to a nice thick cap. Not much retention and little lace. Scent is grains and some citrus hops. Taste is a great balance of the wheat and citrus. Mostly lemon and orange. The hops are noted as well. A very dry crisp finish rounds this beer off nicely. Goose Island scores again."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a slightly cloudy, light straw color with a sudsy white head. Smell is clean and is of wheat and citrusy hops. Taste has a bit of wheat and lemon, a decently refreshing beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a minimal carbonation. Overall, this beer is fairly quaffable. I always enjoy GI's offerings, this one is no exception."
"Pours a clear light golden with a decent head and pretty good lacing. The smell is somewhat light, but what's there is mostly light yeast and bananas. The taste is also quite light, with some grainy wheat, light banana, and a little lemon on the finish. Mouthfeel is light, but not as crisp as it could be, veering toward the slick instead. A decent summer brew, if a little forgettable."
"Cloudy, golden yellow color. Has a warm sunlight quality to it. The head starts out large and airy, then quickly collapses to a spotty sheet the beer struggles to maintain. Little lacing to speak of. The nose starts with a very noticeable lemon bread aroma. Also detectable are grapefruit and malt. Overall, the nose is mild but pleasing. Taste has a lemon zing up front, followed by slightly bready malt and wheat sweetness. A dash of grapefruit is thrown in for good measure. Lemon is a bit too prominent on the palate. Finish is citrusy and dry. Body is medium light, with a good carbonation that gives the beer a smooth feel. Carbonation doesn't seem quite as crisp as it should be. Thirst quenching and drinkable."
"What ya get here is a lightly carbonated and very clean (almost too clean) tasting beer with hot day summertime drinking in mind. A slight hint of citrus in on the tastebuds with a slight bready aftertaste. Not much when it comes to tasting the hops. Yeast seems to take the lead. Not even close to be an exciting beer or something I imagine I would recommend to anything but a novice wanting to try ""one of them fancy beers"" (312 has enough character to show the drinker of average domestics a bit of zing but still gateway/bland enough not to make them run back to their watery security blanket that comes in can) and a big let down compared to other Goose Island things I have tried."
"Definitely a beer for the summer. A bit to watery in my opinion to rank with my favorite summer wheats. But a good beer as it is."
"Light clean mouth feel great beer for summer days very drinkable"
"Drinkability: Very smooth and easy to drink, especially on hot days, but nothing here really excites me like most offerings from Goose Island."
"This brew, despite it being very light in taste, is actually very drinkable. What comes to mind for this beer is if a typical macro lager were to become an ale, this is kind of how I would imagine it tasting: very light on taste, easy to drink, low bitterness. This brew is good choice for the warm summer months as a refresher, but there just isn't enough to this brew to recommend it for year round enjoyment."
"wouldn't hesitate to have another."
"Not an earthshaking beer, but definatley a great summer option. Very easy to drink and quite thirst quenching."
"Overall, kind of a waste. There aren't really any flavors to speak of, super thin, and not very enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Finishes somewhat dry. This brew also has a super light body with higher levels of carbonation-okay, these are appropriate for the style. Very easy to drink, goes down like cold water in a hot desert. I will not be buying this brew again. There are much better out there....one word-Oberon."
"Pours a piss yellow, the kind after a long night of drinking. Smells sweet and grainy, closer to a pilsner than a wheat beer. An inch head that faded away quickly. Tastes of the hops initially for a second and then sweet grains/wheat, slight citrus hoppy finish. Almost tasted like a very weak pale ale at first. Light bodied, goes down like water. I picked it up at Kroger for $5.95 so it certainly would be worth it over some other beers for mass consumption on a hot summers day. I wouldn't seek this beer out if I wanted to enjoy just a few."
"Very good beer that is very easy to drink. Good flavor and a good feel in the mouth. I recommend it because it is much better than most beer in it's class. I also thought the taste was crisp and refreshing without any bitterness that would have damaged the overall taste. Relatively low alcohol content."
"s"
"Mouthfeel is light. Somewhat refreshing beer, but a tad bit sugary for my taste"
"Poured into a pint glass. Pale yellow color that has a tiny amount of head with some fairly decent lacing - some visibly strong carbonation. Smell is dominated by lemon with a faint bread-like sweetness in the background. The taste is nice at first with some strong lemon character, but then there is an awful artificial sweetener taste on the back end. I'm not quite sure what it is, but man, it's rough. Mouthfeel is fine - carbonation is refreshing, but I've had better version of this style. This would be drinkable if that odd sweet flavor wasn't there. Recommendation to try if you like the style."
"You can feel the carbonation, but it's a very light, drinkable beer. It would make a great session beer outdoors on a summer day. It is as easy to drink and as refreshing as water, but at the same time it's not so light that you forget you're drinking beer."
"Poured a cloudy pale yellow with a small bright white head. This beer was poured way too cold. So at first there was little flavor and I was dissapointed, until it warmed some. The scent was very much earthy and slightly spicy. Taste was a lemon zing and slightly grassy. Was a good beer overall."
"Drinkability: It isnt as easy to drink as one would expect. It is good, but not amazing."
"D: Pretty good. Hope I can find this come the warmer months of July and August."
"but you go just perfect with a slice of lou malnati's stuffed pizza, so I just can't hate you."
"Drinkability: I had to give it a 4 because it disappeared way too quick. Did the Goose Island goose drink it down while I wasn't looking? Nope, it was all me. It was so light with some flavor in it that it was hard to put down. Even though I was drinking this in the middle of winter, it was still quite refreshing. If it's this refreshing in the winter time, I would like to see what it's like in the summer time."
"D: Very drinkable beer. Theres something missing here though, theres a lot more wheats out there that I would drink before this one."
"I take back what I said earlier... this beer IS horrible enough that I will refuse to drink it again, but only if there is not a better option. The chances of that is zero, however, as any bar that would stock this would definitely have something better. Honker's for instance."
"D - A very good Am. Pale Wheat Ale. A great combo of wheat and fruit tastes."
"A trade from jhammerly. Pours a cloudy yellowish color, nice carbonation, head quickly disappates, basically no lacing afterwards. Scents of malts, hops, wheat, yeast, and some citrus. The taste is grassy like with a dry finish. Light-Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad brew at all, would make an excellent summer time session brew."
"Has a hazy yellow color with little head. Smells fruity, orange and lemon mostly come through. It has a very light taste, some spice is noticeable. Is also high in carbonation. Not impressed with this one from Goose Island. They definitely have better offerings."
"I don't plan on having this again. Honker's Ale and the Christmas beer from Goose Island are much, much better."
"Overall I would say this is a pretty boring beer, but I would drink it in a world of macros. I would expect more from Goose Island."
"D: Boring beer, but this is an American wheat after all. Probably would be better with a lemon wedge."
"Cloudy yellow, hard to get a decent head but I won't hold that against it so much. The taste is a smooth at first, and then it is followed by a burst of hops (at least I think I know what hops is now). In the end I would love to drink again. Cheers!"
"Overall, this is a mellow beer. Not too harsh or extravagant in any direction. I can see people liking this if they're taking a break from their macro beers (As was I long ago with Spotted Cow) I think more experienced palettes can find better Wheat Brews out there."
"This was a decent beer, but I was not overly impressed. I compare this wheat beer to my favorite, Hacker Pschorr Weiss. By comparison, the taste was weak. There was a citrus taste to it, which was refreshing, but I like a stronger beer. On it's own, it was alright, but I would not buy it again."
"Refreshing and light bodied, this one is lemony and quite highly hopped. This is an interesting blend of a wheat beer and a pale ale that is worth trying. I would like to pick up a sixer of this next summer for sessioning."
"Medium bodied, very drinkable, but not outstanding overall."
"Pours a light yellow with a large head that quickly disapates leaving decent lacing. Nose is light, bready with a very thin fruity component. Flavor is watered down, somewhat skunky, apple juice. It's not undrinkable, just not something to be seeking out. Thanks to JeffKrenner for the bottle."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are decent as well. Not too carbonated but not a lot of body."
"I've had non-beer friends recommend this to me. To them, it's a flavorful change of pace. To me, it's pretty crappy. Still, it's a good hot day slammin' brew with a thick body that makes it go down smooth as silk."
"So if you are going to a Chicago Street fest.... sneak something in a baby stroller"
"Low ABV is nice for the style, not simple in a boring way just in a pleasant and ""I get it, it's good"" way. Normally pricey but under a buck a bottle I can drink these all day on a sunny afternoon."
"Drinkability/Overall: A fairly standard APWA. Sour wheat and lemon...been there. Inoffensive yet entirely unremarkable."
" Not my favorite of the style, but it does have a certain drinkability."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, highly consumable beer. With its crisp refreshing qualities and low alcohol content this is a good summer beer. Just don't expect anything to wow you with this one though."
"Light and refreshing, not complex at all, very simple. Nothing special, frankly. I was hoping for more, but I was disappointed in the basic, almost macro-brew nature of the beer."
"Nothing wrong here, just nothing over whelmingly attractive either. Good standard Am. style wheat to beat the heat."
"Notes: perfect summer beer. Pairs well with fruit salad, pasta prima vera or a light marinara sauce."
"Had this one on tap whilst in Chicago ... presents itself as a mirky yellow color with a super huge white head. Nose is of citrus and floral notes. Slight spiciness as well. Palate is lively, somewhat dry and only a subtle wheat taste upfront. The citrus and floral notes play well in the mouth. Where's the wheat though? Mouthfeel is on the light side. Decnt carbonation, but tends to flatten quickly as it warms. This does wake up the wheat in this beer, however. Okay for an American Wheat beer. Readily available and user-friendly."
"Drinking more than one of these would be a waste of time and energy. Don't bother with this one."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tumbler. The appearance was light and hazy yellow with a wispy head. The aroma was really faint wheat, nothing stood out very strong. Same with the flavor really, a little taste of wheat base and a tought of hops bitterness. Not bad but kind of bland."
"This brew pours a clear pale yellowish-orange color. The head is large enough, but fades rather quickly. The aroma is of bubble gum with a mild wheat tanginess if you look really hard for it. The taste is even more faint than the aroma, with nothing really to speak of. The mouthfeel is probably the thinnest of any wheat beer I have ever had. Overall, like so many other American wheat beers, is a drain pour."
"312 is a beer that pours with a medium amount of carbonation. The bread-like aroma of wheat is fairly obvious, while the flavor of this slightly hazy, yelllow ale is inoffensively like a liquid low salt whean thin. A very slight tart finish adds just a little bit of compexity. Overall, this is a very drinkable beer and definitely fits into the category of ""lawnmower"" beer in that respect."
"drinkability: i will admit, its quite quaffable, and i seem to recall knocking back 4 dollar glasses all day long in the summer sun, so at least it has a purpose"
"Pours a cloudy straw with the yeast pour. Fizzy three finger head shows poor retention but good lacing. Powdery yeast and wheat nose, pretty clean. First sip is sweet flaked wheat malt, and a spicy clove flavor in the aftertaste along with a healthy yeast bite. Low carbonation in a thin body results in a very quaffable mouthfeel, but the drinkability suffers due to mild astringent charcter that comes on in the finish."
"Much better head, good lacing. Lemony notes throughout. Clean finishing. A bit thin. S'okay, but not what Pres should'a sent the EPM."
"Not bad, but the beer is pretty mild and lacks anything mentionable. It's unoffending, but not spectacular. Might be used as a 'gateway' beer for someone used to typical mass-produced/mass-marketed ""American beer""."
"Cloudy sun yellow body with particulates suspended in the media. Aroma is very tangy and citrusy and lemony. This beer is lifeless. And I thought the Island Wheat from Capital I just had was bland. Carbonation is slightly prickly. Body is barely medium. And the flavor in indescribable. Not a lot to talk about. A little of that lemon and citrus tang. Not a lot else. Watery. A disappointment."
"I liked this one. It's not a great beer, but it's enjoyable as far as american wheats go. Goose Island are consistently very good and this doesn't disappoint, even though the style generally does. I'd drink it again."
"(review found in old notes...not sure what date reviewed, but sometime this last winter)"
"Drinkablity - This goes down easy. Is very light, so would be good in warm weather for those with less bold tastes, - but not so much for me."
"I am sure this would taste great on draugh but in the bottle is lacking."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This is a light bodied beer. The carbonation gives the beer a big lift in the mouthfeel. A very nice well balanced beer. This beer is highly quaffable and very sessionable."
"I am a big fan of Goose Island. I can always count on them to give me something that is better than most of the competition for a great price and they are always dead on the style. The 312 may be in a relatively broad category, but it neither pins it down or pushes the boundaries. It just sort of sits there limply. They, and you, can do better."
"312 is a great looking beer."
"O--Ugh, What does ""Urban"" mean? I'll give it another shot, but I'm not impressed yet."
"DGlad I tried this one. A solid wheat ale that will be great for the summer months. Another good selection for after yard work."
"I'm revisiting this one after not having one for probably a year or so. Goes great with Mexican food and would make a great session beer. Great balance of flavor and drinkability. If this is available in your area, I highly recommend it."
"Rock on man, rock on."
"A decent pale wheat brew that can be enjoyed by many a glass full."
"Drinkability: Beats a Macro any day, but I would generally choose to wait for a real german wheat beer if i knew that the opportunity to drink one would soon present itself"
"Drinkability - Very drinkable due to the light body and clean taste. This would make a refreshing lawnmower beer in a hot summer."
"Need some cheddar cheese & crackers to go with them. Final self note: not worth the $8 for a sixer price."
"An excellent American wheat. Not complex, but a good, refreshing beer."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable. Could be a session beer. Nothing complex, but nothing bad."
"Even for the style, 312 could use a little more kick. Yet, by the light of its balanced taste and the approachability of the next sip/bottle, it stands as an easy pour, a lock as an intro beer for a macro drinker. Very approachable in July."
"On tap at the Clyborne brew pub. Pale, clear yellow color with a wispy, thin head. Watery mouthfeel. Has a weak grainy, slightly tart malt taste. Fizzy carbonation. Weak stale bread smell. A little better than your average macro is the best I can say here"
"price: $1.00 12oz bottle"
"My first beer from the Goose Island Brewery. Look forward to trying their other selections."
"There was nothing bad about this beer, it was just bland and boring. It was drinkable, but so is water."
"Where I generally enjoy the fuller flavor of authentic Hefeweizens, I can see this crisper, cleaner, and more simplified palate finding way into my glass while enjoying a game at Wrigley Field."
"12 ounce bottle. Pours out a hazy yellow color with suspended particles and a white head. The aroma is tangy wheat, lemon, honey, and cereal grain. Grain flavor with lemons. Wheat flavor, but not at all hefe weizen like. Maybe it could use some more hop flavor, but it's fine the way it is. Medium mouthfeel. Great drinkability. This is a simple beer, but it is tasty and quaffable."
"Hazy yellow color with a small, foamy head..actually leaves nice patterns of lacing on the pint glass. Citrusy aroma and lingering hops. Soft, dry mouthfeel with typical wheat qualities. The wheat character gives this a nice mouthfeel and, while having a fairly light body, it is a solid offering from Goose Island. Very easy to drink and a great fallback, as it's served on-tap at many places in my area."
"Drinkability: I'd say skip it, there are many more better, crisper, and refreshing Pale Wheat Ales out there."
"I owed it to the brewers to give this a second review."
"This is certainly drinkable, and largely inoffensive, just so long as you shut your brain off prior to the first sip."
"In some aspects, 312 Urban Wheat seems to have been created for the masses. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it seems to lack any real flavor characteristics. It reminds me a lot, although the style is different, to beers such as New Glarus Spotted Cow and Lakefront's Cattail Ale. The later being a more recent example of a beer catered to appeal to those who normally drink bland American lagers. Again, this doesn't take anything away from the beer, I just seem to get the sense that Goose Island was trying to create a summer entry or lawnmower beer for someone who typically would enjoy a BMC product. And if that's what turns a person like that on to better beer, than so be it. I'm sure that wasn't their intention when crafting this, but they may have hit that market in the process."
"If that silly distributor would have let me pick this up in a 6-pack, I surely would have gone through plenty over the summer."
"In case anyone is interested, 312 refers to the telephone area code for the Goose Island brewery. It seems to me the folks at GI have achieved what they set out to achieve with this beer. That is, to give an often lackluster style a kick in the ass with Cascade hops and to give the lawnmower beer category a quality newcomer. Mission accomplished on both counts."
"Pours the usual yellow colour of a wheat which almost matches the label. Only a slight haziness in the glass. Definitly a strong wheat flavour and aroma with a slight lemony finish. Fairly thin mouthfeel and relatively low carbonation. A decent wheat but rather bland. Refreshing on a hot day, perhaps as the first beer after coming in from the heat before moving on."
"Straw yellow with a slight haziness and a rocky, bright white head. Lemon citrus and wheat dominate the aroma and flavour, along with a bit of hop character. Subdued bitterness with some malty sweetness as well. Short, balanced finish with some dryness. Creamy texture with moderate carbonation and a lightish body. Nice flavour, light and drinkable. Great for the heat of summer. Thanks Viggo."
"This is worth experiencing if it is available, but I would not go out of my way for it, nor would I pay a premium price for it."
"Dry lemon wheat bread flavor, a bit light but very refreshing"
"Very refreshing. A good wheat beer and not overpowering. With the carbination, which I feel it has just the right amount, it almost goes down like a light beer (easy and refreshing) but has the richness of a medium bodied beer."
"Pale golden/straw color. Slightly hazy. Thick white foamr head shrinks quickly, but a decent rocky head remains for a fair period of time. Slight citrusy nose, other pale smells like that of a lager, or adjunct. Slightly tart and acidic, grainy finish. Not much hop bitterness or flavor here. Light body, good amount of carbonation. Refreshing, but not very exciting. More hop character might do this some good."
"Pours a hazy yellow/amber, a pretty interesting colour. Big white head that goes away relatively quickly, little bit of lace. Has a malty smell with some lemon and maybe orange peel, not bad. Has a fruity taste up front with some hops and a little bitterness. Kind of a lemony zest there too without being sour. Very pleasant beer, low carbonation and very refreshing in the summer, good for sessioning."
"Thanks to Darkover for the trade. Apparently wheat doesnt grow too well in urban areas. Hazy yellow-gold color with a thin white head and scant lacing. The aroma is faintly wheaty with a touch of malt. Light-bodied with a slick mouthfeel. Tastes like a cross between a Wheat and an Adjunct Lager. Mild wheat, hops and corn are the prevalent flavors. The finish is crisp and lightly hoppy and fruity. Not bad really, it just doesnt need to be this bland."
"Drinkability: I drank it with no problem and it wasn't intolerable, so average, but there are other/better wheats out there."
"Tasty. Simple. Drinkable. I like this beer, I wouldnt seek it out but the three (and then six) bottles I acquired, as part of the Summer Sampler(s), will find a good home, first in the DBF and then my belly. Purchased in Omaha. Decent. Need not avoid."
"Cloudy, hazy yellow color, with a huge white frothy and sticky head that stays around for awhile. This has citrus and wheat aromas, light wheaty, and some lemon flavor, medium in body, nice soft and creamy mouthfeel, has a nice clean and refreshing finish, a bit on the bland side."
"D-This is an average beer. None of the flavors really tell you its a wheat beer but they hops and grain are balanced flavors. Its nice for someone who wants to switch from American adjunct lagers but I'm rather bored after drinking it. I had it on cask a few years ago and really liked it but in the bottle its dead."
"Not impressed with you at all, watery beer."
"This brew is a somewhat hazy lighter gold/straw color, small white head at the crown. Light wheat brew smell, not much going on (i got a cold, take the grain of salt). Light malt front, fairly sweet. Light floral hop presence. Wheaty characteristics, not as intense as a hefe, quite refreshing and quaffable. While i would prefer a hefe to this, this is one of those beers that you could drink by the pool by the case. Excellent refreshing summer brew."
"This is the first bottled Goose Island to let me down. Poured a beautiful hazy gold. Initial flavor is a lemony, citric tartness. Nothing of much consequence follows up on the citric front, sort of a case of waiting for the other shoe to drop, and it never does. Finish is a neutral astringency. Yeast appears to contribute nothing much but cloudyness. Normally, I'd assign a tart, reserved wheat such as this to the ""good on a hot summer day"" category, but this falls short of delivering that sort of refreshment. Just too shallow in the flavor profile to make me want another."
"12 oz bottle from the brewery's summer sampler box. Served into a tall weizen glass, the body is a hazed, lemonade yellow with a one finger white head that retains well and leaves good patchy lace. Aroma is subdued, with citrusy lemon, grainy wheat, and a hint of noble hops. Mouthfeel is light medium bodied with spritzy carbonation. Taste is lemon zest, grainy wheat, mild coriander and white pepper spices, and some restrained grassy and herbal hopping. Clean and crisp. This is a laid back, easy going, beer that is user friendly. Excellent drinkability."
"I had this at Charlie's Ale House in Munster, Indiana for $2.50/pint. Nice deal and a good starter imo. This beer has a golden glow to it with a nice fluffy white head that holds well. Lacing is moderate. A few bubbles show themselves in the transparent bronze body. Aroma is a bit weak to me as most wheats have a weak aroma but I notice a clean pale malt flavor and some bready notes, but not much. Flavor is just a nice clean wheat backed by a solid hop bitterness to even out the sweetness. Yeast flavor is a bit on the low side but it provides a drying effect. Good lively body really helps this beer in drinkability and the finish is nice and crisp. Nothing spectacular but definitely a nice drinker and a beer that one could have quite a few of no prob."
"Sampled on tap last night at Jet on Milwaukee Ave. in Chicago. Served in a tall 312 glass and had a cloudy gold appearance, looked like a German HefeWeizen. Smell was fruity, with banana esters. Quite nice. Tasted vanilla, banana, and some American hop bitterness. Don't recall much clove or spiciness but overall very quaffable. Mouthfeel was about right; sorta thin like most Goose Island brews. I will definitely be drinking more!"
"This beer is very tasty and extremely drinkable. I will definitely pick up more of this during the summer."
"Thanks to orbitalr0x for bringing this one down to me. Pours a slightly hazy yellow color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is very subdued for an American Wheat. Slight hops, slight spices, but very subdued. The flavor doesn't have as much of the US hops as I expected it to, which I like. It still has a slight hoppiness which differentiates it from the standard wheat beers. This is one of the better examples of this style that I've had, actually."
"Thanks to orbitalr0x for bringing this to me. It pours a slightly hazy straw color with a 2 finger head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is nice, with a slight citrusy lemon and sweet honey hiding behind the minimally harsh wheat and moderately aggressive noble hop. I like it. The flavor is full on the spicey noble hop, followed by a slight lemoney burst, finishing true to its roots as an American wheat, with a wheaty graineyness. The feel is moderate to thick, with a full carbnation. Outside of the Gumballhead, this is one of the best American wheat beers I have had. Very good show."
" A good looking wheat beer that pours a bright yellow with a fair amount of cloud. A nice snow white, two finger head sits on top that offers a good amount of lace as the carbonation purks up the citric aroma. The taste is of wheat with a nice amount of lemon zest. A tartness is felt through the crisp hops while a nice solid malt hints the background of this medium bodied brew. The carbonation softens the mouthfeel which aids its drinkability. A great warm wheather beer im sure. If you can get it, try it. A good drinkable offering of this style."
"Drinkability is pretty solid on this one. Definitly one of the better wheat beers I have had, will be a great session beer on hot summer days."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice wave of small bubbly carbonation that fills the mouth. Refreshing and easy to drink...this would make a great summer session brew. I could see myself having quite a few of these on a sunny day working in the yard. Definetly worth a try."
"Hazy yellow with some tiny sediment and loose bubbly carbonation. Great white capped head that offers bananas, freshly peeled oranges, wheat bread and some oats. Tarty and sour-sweet, a sharp offering of lemon peel, coriander and some wheat. Medium bodied; medium carbonation. Strong bitter hops, kisses of black pepper on the palate; decent malt-based undertone. Pretty easy drinkin here, nothing wrong with this offering."
"Pours a hazy yellow with a pillowy white head that diminishes greatly but sticks around until the end. The nose is the greatest part of this beer: toasted cereal, bready, a hint of banana and an uderlying citric aroma. Taste is much the same as the nose, but less intense. Wheaty and grassy, slightly fruity, with a little bitter hop finish. Lightly carbonated and very clean. This should make for a great session beer, especially in the summer."
"Easy drinking summer type beer with excellent carbonation per style. Very enjoyable beer."
"Bottled and Draft at the Brewery: The next beer in their specialty retail line (as soon as they get approval for the labels). Baseline example of an American wheat: pale yellow beer under a bubbly head that clings a little to the plastic glass. Not as fizzy as other wheats. Hop taste is more traditionally bitter, not fruity like 3F's Gumballhead, and very well balanced to the malt profile. Sampling from the bottle reveals a slightly fruitier profile."
