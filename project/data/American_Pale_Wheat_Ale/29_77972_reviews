"Gross. I couldn't finish it. That says a lot."

"Smells of sweet wheat with some light citrus. They call it an ipa but I only get a subtle piney flavor. Not an ipa."

"I don't understand how this beer is being so bashed. I suppose naming it an IPA is a bit misleading, however, name aside, it's a great tasting spring and summer brew. Very easy to drink and drink and drink. One of my all time favorites and unfortunately, it's no longer kegged by AB."

"I was disappointed with this beer as I thought it would be better. It is way overhopped and lacking in maltiness. It is almost flavorless if you put aside the hop taste. It has a poor color and almost no mouth. The head seems to just disappear as soon as it was poured. I did not detect any wheat aroma at all and wonder if they used any wheat malt when brewing this beer."
""
""
""
"Very light, very little hop flavor. This should not be considered an IPA by any means. Pathetic head with nonexistent lacing. Other than that, really not a bad beer. Nice color, easy drinking smooth taste. If they could add some more carbonation and call this just a wheat ale instead of a wheat IPA I would have much more respect for this brew."
""

"These guys know about carbonation. The smell is not very inviting. Flavors are muted and a little muddy. This one tastes like it has some margarita mix in it. Not sweet, however. Not malty, not hoppy. It's just a beery taste with some earthy, murky flavors. I can't actually taste anything like hops, but it does have a bitter aftertaste that is far from pleasant. There's really nothing to hate in this, but it doesn't seem to have any of the good flavors of either an IPA or a Witbier. Plenty of concept, though."

"Purchased only one bottle, and that was enough."

"Overall: Very disappointing. In my attempts to always try new beers, I decided to give this one a shot despite my tendency to shy away from Shock Top (homebrewer and I can't reuse their twist off bottles). Save your money on this one and buy something else."

"O - I wondered why this was listed as a wheat beer and not an IPA. My first drink answered that question. It tastes like Blue Moon. Put an orange slice in it and that is what you have. There are no discernible IPA characteristics to this beer. It's just a below average wheat beer."
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall, I don't think this is an IPA. It would fare better in the Wheat Ale category."
""
""
""

"This pours a cloudy, golden copper color with a beige head. The scent is a mild aroma of wheat and hops. The taste is not really a wheat beer and not really an IPA. There is a lot more of a mellow citrus taste than anything. The taste isn’t very strong and the texture is kind of weak. This is probably one of the weaker offerings from the Shocktop line."
""
""
""
"The whole entire character of the beer meets the nose and palate halfway, then just drops off like it was never even there. What is the reason for such a lackluster aftertaste? It had potential. Perhaps this beer is what differentiates between macros and what is going on deep in the craft beer world."
""
""
""
"There is a watered-down honeysuckle taste with heavy citrus overtones. The hops are present, but do not introduce themselves. This is the Anheuser-Busch of IPA's with a citrus-wheat twist. I enjoy pounding these because they don't have a heavy or pronounced flavor, but make us hop-lovers laugh in a ""hey, this ain't too terrible"" sorta way. This is why I like this beer."
"Poured from tap into pint at bww Shreveport. Pours a slight amber with about 2 fingers of head. Looks nice but too dark for a pale wheat. Faint corny citrus aroma with some slight faint wheaty notes. Super mild citrus flavor meets a bit of wheat malts but also has a bit of astringent cleaner like flavor but its very mild. Its really an easy drinking beer but I will most likely never have another..."
""

"Pours sort of a cloudy dark tan, with a very light head. It says on the bottle to pour until a half inch is left in bottle, swirl that around, and pour to produce ""a rich, thick collar of foam to release citrusy cascade hop aroma"". I did this but there wasn't very much of a thick head. It has a very faint citrus smell, certainly nothing offensive, but not overwhelming either. Taste is average, like the smell not offensive and certainly drinkable, but not great either. It is probably something that you could drink a couple of, might quench your thirst, but wouldn't ever hit you where you stop and say ""damn that is good"". That citrus taste has that hoppy ipa kick at the end, but is less encouraging then other, better ipa. Mouthfeel doesn't have a lot of texture or anything going on.A non offensive tolerable beer that won't knock your socks off but won't kill you either."

"O - real disappointed, I think that Shock Top Belgian White is a decent wheat beer and had high hopes for this one, not a very good attempt from anheuser busch here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, there are several better wheat beers, several better IPA’s and several beers that do a much better job of combining the two styles that I would choose before this one."
""
"Overall - IPA? What a joke. I've had brown ales with more hop character than this. Just another beer trying to cash in on the IPA trend. This is the last of the Shock Top I'm ever trying. I can't do this to myself anymore. I expect them to be bad, and they're even worse than the already low expectations I have for them."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: Easily Shock Top's best spin-off."
""
""
"I'd suggest passing this up."

"I had this after ordered this simply because I had never tried it before. Needless to say it left me regretting this decision when the bar had better IPA's in bottles. For a wheat ""IPA"" it really lacked that hoppy goodness I look for, in both taste and smell. It was a decent refreshing beer, but I won't be buying another."

"Overall- this is an underrated American gas-station beer. You all want it to be something that its not, and its saying ""no ways bro", I'm the price of bud light but without the guilt!"
"O - an interesting combination, but nothing spectacular"
""
""
""
"Overall just an average beer. Not a good wheat ale or an IPA. Probably trying too hard to be to be a crossover beer. Glad I tried it, but I won't have it again."

"IPA? I don't know - it's a hoppy, slightly more alcoholic Belgian wheat. The cascade hops are there, but it's no ""hop-bomb"". It's ""Shocktop"" with more hops and a bit higher abv. Not bad for what it is, IMO."
"I could see this beer impressing BMC drinkers because I'll give some credit; there actually is some flavor here... It just doesn't cut it in the big leagues."
"Fairly dissapointing. The orange notes in the nose come off as orange flavor candy, though it is a little better executed in the taste. Plus slightly low carbonation."
"Pours a hazy, copper/amber color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, pale malt, hint of alcohol, hint of citrus hops, hint of wheat, and a hint of sugar. Fits the style of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of earthy malt, slight pale malt, hint of wheat, hint of sweet malt, and slight citrus hops. Overall, the blend is not very pleasing (almost comes off buttery, but not quite) and the aroma is muted. The appearance and feel are both decent."
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden orange color. with a tall white head. Nose is nice with citrus and floral hop notes, a good bready aroma, and a bit of citrus peel and wheat. Might be a little grass both on the palate and aroma to go along with the floral and citrus notes. A touch sweet, but a mild bitterness on the finish. Nice and dry with high carbonation. Quite a bit of orange on the palate. Not bad, actually."

"O: Overall, its not a terrible beer but this is the absolute worst IPA Ive ever had, if you want to even call it an IPA. I guess there is a reason its being pulled!"
""
""
"Overall you could be doing a lot worse, but compared to regular APWAs, and even hoppy ones this just doesn't hold a candle."
"Overall this is a drain pour. AB could have created a drinkable beer if they had just cut the malts way down."
""

"Bottle: Poured a light gold/orangey color ale with a medium size foamy head. Aroma of light piney and citrus hoppy notes with some sweet wheat malt notes. Taste is also a good mix between some light piney and citrus hoppy notes and some lightly sweet wheat malt notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Better then I had expected but not sure I would buy this again since it is lacking a bit of a hops punch."
"Overall – Wow.. just wow. This beer is a mess. The taste is all over the place and I'm not sure I've ever had anything quite like it. It honest tastes like someone mixed a bad IPA with a bad wit beer on the spot. Not something I'd buy again. On the bright side, the appearance wasn't bad."

"From the 12 fl oz. bottle marked 12019-BG22. Sampled on June 27, 2012. It pours a slightly hazy amber orange with a small head that becomes a ring for the remainder of the session. The aromas bring out the wheat, citrus zest, and the spiciness of coriander. The body is light but creamy. The taste falls down a bit after the nice aroma but it is still a wheat-filled, lemony flavor with moderate bitterness at the finale. Not a bad job by Shock Top."
""
""
""
""
""
"This isn't an awful beer, but it doesn't do a whole lot right. The hops are non-existant and there isn't a malt presence either. Very sweet with alcohol in the finish, I feel like this should be in a 40oz bottle."
""
"If you want an IPA, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere because there is little to nothing present in this flavor combination from Shock Top that will satisfy your IPA hop cravings. The combination of wheat and IPA sounds intriguing, but it just doesn’t work very well with this product."
"Pours a dark amber with some light haze throughout. 3cm of off-white head that dissapates with no lacing to speak of. Even with a deep whiff I get almost nothing except a very faint citrus hop. The hop disappear on the palate and it’s just an underwhelming light sweetness, like maybe honeysuckle, and then a tang of bitterness somewhere in there. Very watery, finishes with a whimper."
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle to a pint glass, Color is an amber/orange with a 1/8"" white head that leaves good lacing. Aroma is that of wheat and faint munich malt. Tase is the same as aroma, zero hop flavor or aroma, and maybe 30 IBUs. Not bitter enough. Mouthfeel is too sweet, and not enough carbonation. This is not an IPA."
""
"I poured this beer into a pint glass. It has a nice dark golden color body with not head or lace. The smell of wheat. The taste is of wheat with a faint taste of hops. The mouthfeel is ok and overall i don't like this beer and i don't know why it says it is a wheat IPA, when there are no characters of a ipa in it."
"Overall a good idea that lacked identity in practice."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Another faux craft beer from the macros to avoid. Not good at all."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a hazy golden-orange color with a white head. The aroma is fairly faint, with a hint of perfume and a little bit of wheat. The flavor is also fairly faint. There is some light fruit and some perfume, as well as a little bit of grass and some wheat. The flavor is fairly muddled, with nothing really standing out. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
""
"Pours a murky dark orange with a 1 inch foamy orange-white head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of moldy bread, cooked veggies, and some slight herbal aromas. Taste is of wheat, herbal hops, and a slightly vegetal flavor on the finish. There is a slight bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a a pretty average beer taste wise but the smell is pretty horrible in my opinion."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours an orange/amber with a small white/gray head that dissipates quickly but leaves some lacing. Smells of wheat and some hops with a citrusy overtone, but mainly wheat. Tastes of wheat beer with a nice little hop bite, but nothing terribly strong. Beer goes down real smooth but is a little overcarbonated. Overall, a slightly above average beer."
""
"Good golden color with a yeasty hazy. Soap like head with excellent retention and sticky lacing. Hint of wheat and pine in the aroma. Solid malt backbone with a wheat bread like character. Pine and soap flavors from the hops initially then turns into an off soil and medicinal character. Descent balance. Medium bodied, well carbonated and smooth feel. Definitely fits the style of pale wheat ale better than IPA and for what it is, it's not bad. One of the best AB products I have drank lately."
""
""
""

""
""
"Taste is light to medium bodied. Not really sure where the IPA part comes in; tastes like a fruity wheat beer, some orange comes through. Nice clean finish and pretty good drinkability, just think the label is a bit of a misnomer. A decent beer to have on a hot summer day, but really no other reason to seek it out. Meh."
" The flavor is tangy with some mild malt flavors which lead to more wheaty bready flavor and slight tinge of citrus from the hops in the background, but pretty muted as far as hop flavor, maybe a tinge of spice in there with some yeast elements adding to the wheat malt which has a light toasted and creamy element. The overall enjoyment was not terrible, but I approached this more as a wheat beer than an IPA, so take that how you will. I think it is decent, just should not be labeled an ipa since it is unbalanced toward the wheat side."
""
"Wheaty? Maybe. IPA? Hell to the no. But maybe that's not the idea - my girl just described this to the point of an AB marketing exec's wildest dream - as for me, it is neither all that wheat-like, or all that bitter. Target demographics, indeed."
""
""
"It may have been fun in concept. Ultimately, Shock Top's Wheat IPA isn't exactly ""pale", nor is it ""India", nor anything I'm going to fondly remember."
""
""
"O-Not a great beer but valiant effort from AB in the craft field. Will continue to try their new brews they are creating to compete with the craft market."
""
""
"YUK"
""
""
"O: I was excited to try a wheat ipa – but this was not what I expected – too bland and not very interesting."
""
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy orange color with a half inch off-white head that didn't stay around for too long. The brew smells like wheat, bready malt, and some orange. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also a weird bitter taste. And it's not a good hoppy bitter flavor, either. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit oily with decent carbonation. Overall it's not bad, but not exactly good either. I think for the most part it's mostly average overall. But I can't really complain since I picked up a single of this for $1.29. I wouldn't buy a six pack of this, but I also wouldn't turn down a bottle either."
""
""
"About as good as expected with a Shock Top."
"12oz bottle purchased at Market Basket. Pours a murky amber with a good inch of off-white head that leaves some decent lacing. Smells slightly hoppy. Lemon and orange dominate the flavor. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Fairly pleasant and drinkable. Not bad. Really just a more citrussy version of the original, the hops add that but pretty much stay out of the way otherwise."
""
""
""
""
"O: I'll admit that I'm a fan of the wheat IPA style. This one is pretty average. Yes, it's from a macro, but there are no adjuncty flavors at all. It's inoffensive, easy to drink, and tastes fairly good."
""
""
"This beer won't blow you away but it is definitely worth the money spent on it ($6.99 in Georgia). I will definitely drink this again, especially with summer on its way. It would make a great, inexpensive session beer for those that enjoy a beer with a little taste, even if they are going to drink a few of them. This beer makes me wonder why craft breweries haven't released more Wheat IPA offerings."
"O: Have to say I kind of like this one... would make a pretty good session beer... Hard to get bored with a mix of flavors like this one.... Good job on this one."
""
""
""
"M: Has a little too much carbonation, but does leave nice coating."
""
"Will not have this beer again."
""
"Not terribly bad but not very good. With IPA on the label I'm comparing it to those. Less hops than expected, not enough aroma or bitterness. Needs more body to hold this together."
"O: An interesting beer and one I'm glad I tried once--especially not a bad option if all you have are AB"
"Overall - Basically.. this is a pretty decent beer. I enjoy it compared to other IPAs. But it's not nearly as bitter as most, which may be a downfall to a majority of the people."
"A lot of white and very little IPA, but I still enjoyed it quite a bit. Pours a copper with a thin white head that is gone fast. Nose is dominated by wheat and citrus. Taste is is more complex than I anticipated from Shock Top. Begins like a typical Belgian White - wheat and Belgian mix of spices, followed by a very understated hop finish that resembles celery, only there is another light""finish"" of Beligian candy sugar that cleanses the light hop bite. I am not a huge fan of Shock Top's white, to me this more interesting."
""
""
""
"Appears a nice deep copper with hints of apricot in the color with an off white creamy textured head billowing thick. Aroma has sharp citrus notes amongst at billowing white ale malt base with hints of coriander and sharp wheat. Aroma has a citrus notes with some eartlhy hop highlights hints of spice and yeast with some coriander go along. Flavor bitterness with pale malts citrus, spice notes in the finish not as bad or horrible as it sounds. Even bodied carbonation going on smooth, yet oily textured wtih chewy yeast body moments. Drinkability is decent not the base wheat IPA I've had or the worse...a decent shot at it really."
""
""
""
"Overall not a bad beer, but not a good one either. So much for AB Inbev trying to break into the Craft Beer market…"
"The taste is worse than I expected. The coriander, which I thought was a good thing in the smell, is dull, the wheat flavour is dull, the bitterness is duller than hell and in now way represents what a finely crafted Wheat IPA CAN offer my taste buds. This is a real mess and I'm dumping the rest of my glass and the rest of the bottle. Terrible beer."
""
""
"Although the beer isn't a train wreck, it misses the mark on the tangibles that make good wheat beers and IPAs."
"O/D-Overall it had the workings of being okay, but ultimately it just flat out failed. The only IPA-ish beer on tap at the bar I went to. Pretty bad; not a good take on a cool style."
"Pours hazy, light amber with a thin bubbly head that quickly withdraws. Smells mostly of wheat with little hop aroma, makes me wonder just how much of an IPA it really is. Mouthfeel is a bit full and chunky, almost like you’re chewing it a bit, as most American wheat beers tend to be. Heavy orange and coriander up front with a bit of sweetness that is balanced by the hops. However, I don’t really taste any additional hops. It doesn’t taste that much different than a regular wheat to me, but then again, I don’t drink wheats very often. But in the end, it’s kind of fruity."
""
"Taste-Some citrus fruit, citrus peel hop note. Actually pretty refreshing with decent flavor. I know this is an AB product but I try to judge with an open mind, or at least palate. I could see having a couple of these on a hot day or as a ""safe"" crowd pleaser at a cookout. Good value and decent flavor overall."
""
""
"Grabbed a bottle of this with minimal expectations of how it might be. The beer poured out as a decent looking hazy golden color with a nice looking white head on top. The aroma didn't give off too much in the way of hops in my opinion. The taste of the beer was honestly just not good at all to me. I found it to be weak and the hops that I was tasting were awful. The mouthfeel was smooth and moderately carbonated. Overall I just found the taste of this to be unpleasant on every level. Just a poor attempt at getting this beer off the ground I think. I'll keep this one on the shelves."
"Pours a clouded dirty orange color. Small silky head forms and little to no lace is left. Light aroma of wheat malt, sweetness, and a hint of hops. In the flavor, wheaty citrus, mild yet discernible hop bitterness and flavor. Reminds me of a wheat version of Budweiser's now defunct American Ale. Sweet, malty, watery, mild hops, and wheat. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and thin. Overall, not too bad, if surrounded by macro beers this one can do in a pinch."
""
""
"Yeah, its better than what they usually make and I applaud the effort, but they still have a ways to go IMHO to truly impress the craft beer market."
"Overall Not worth buying maybe I should have not picked up this ""novelty"" beer."
"This is a middle-of-the-road beer of its style, but the Shock Top brand shows some promise and ambition. This won't do as a keeper, neither for the serious beer drinker, nor the regular Joe."
""
"It definitely clashes, but not quite as drain-pouringly bad as I thought it would. The coriander is just not very good with the hops. It is cringe-inducing, but I might actually be able to finish the bottle. The wheat tang only makes things worse with a zest-filled citricly spiced acidic taste that is damn near vomit-inducing. I lied earlier...I will be pouring out about 1/4 of the bottle. It is foul. Way worse than regular shock top...to quote my boy Samir from Office Space...""Yes, this is horrible, this idea"". Who the fuck thought this would be good?!"
""
""
"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer, I thought it wasn't that IPA like and a below average American Pale Wheat Ale, it didn't have good balance to it. This beer had ok drinkability it went down smooth and was a little refreshing, but the taste doesn't hold my interest at all and it starts to ware on me, one is enough. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance, nothing was off about it and it looked good. What I liked least about this beer was the flavor and aroma, they were both a disappointment and were way too similar to the original beer, I don'k think I would be able to tell a difference. This beer was a good deal but I wouldn't buy it again and I don't really recommend. I wasn't expecting much with this beer, and not much is exactly what I got, beers shouldn't call themselves an IPA when there is hardly and hop flavor and no bitterness whatsoever, I really don't see how this beer is different then regular Shock Top. I am going to steer clear of this beer, if I want a good Wheat IPA I am going to have to stick with Lagunitas, cause INBEV isn't cutting it."
""
""
"O: wheat IPA, you say, interesting, hats off to try to make something new, but honestly wasn't that into this one"
""
""
""
""
"This is an above average beer at best. It is not bad but it is not great. It is close to being pretty damn good though. It tastes eerily similar to regular Shock Top but Shock Top Wheat does not have as bitter an after taste in my opinion. The color is grainy yellow with a hazy overcast. The smell is nothing special, just the hops have a hint of order. The taste actually pretty good and it does not leave a bad taste in your mouth. It is easy to drink and rather enjoyable. I recommend this beer if you have a chance to run across it."
""
""
"Overall: It's just not good, so, if nothing else, at least the Shock Tops are consistent in their continued failures. It's not particular wheat-y, even putting IPA on the label is a sham, and it's far enough removed from the standard Shock Top that I'm not really sure who this beer is for (other than suckers like me)."
"Overall its a OK beer not going to overwhelm the wheat beer drinker but someone that loves IPA like myself isn't going to dump it out either. If anything maybe it will get people that only drink macro beers to venture out more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - 3.5/5 -flavor is a big factor in my sense of a beer, and in this case, that is the weakest point if this beer. This comes from a dedicated IPA fan"
"This is a rather hoppy beer for a pale wheat, but it comes across a little unbalanced. The malt character isn't built to withstand the citrusy, bitter hop character. It's a good idea, but I'd go for a Lil Sumpin Sumpin or a Saranac White IPA before I get another one of these."
""
"I don't really think much of this as an IPA, but it is drinkable enough. I think AB should've just called this a cascade wheat beer & that would've been more accurate. I have to deduct .5 on aroma & taste just due the muted use of hops. This would suffice as a choice in many bars around here, although I still think the Wit is better"
""
"Overall- For the price of the brew it really is quite nice. The aroma is definitely lacking but the taste makes up for it. A good session beer; easy to drink and affordable."
""
"I don't taste the IPA part here. Not bad but why bother?"
"Overall, more of a wheat beer than an ipa by far. Not something I'll revisit."
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard Pilsener glass."
"I somehow don't think ""wheat IPA"" is gonna catch on as a style name... This stuff pours a lightly hazy pale straw topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises light greens, light orange rind, and a pinch of what may or may not be pepper (I don't like that I can't tell...). The taste brings in more of the same, with everything coming in muted, faded, and with a touch of tartar sauce in the background. Hrm... A mild bitterness pervades throughout the finish. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, a pretty sad brew. I'm not a Shock Top hater, and I applaud the attempt here, but this just came out pretty poorly, if you ask me."
"O: I hate to say it but I would drink this again. I won’t BUY it again because I already feel bad enough having given AB my money for this one bottle, but I was surprised not by how good this beer was, but how bad it wasn’t. It’s still a bit synthetic tasting, and definitely a fast food style Belgian IPA, but it’s a decent effort on their part."
""
"Up an down the label, this is an ipa with flourishing citrus hoppiness... utter BS. I can't say I've ever tasted such misrepresentation before. Pass."
"O - Not a fan. Maybe I don't get the ""Wheat IPA"" thing yet, but it isn't working for me."
"Mahalo for the sample bottle."
"O - In short, the label is misleading. If you can deal witht hat it actually is a decent beer. Just understand this is a wheat ale, and not an ipa."
"Once again why call it IPA if there are no hops, even taking that into account it would be a very substandard Belgian Wheat."
"Overall -- If you're just looking for a refreshing beer, you've found it. But if you're looking for a wheat ipa, you need to keep looking."
""
"Definitely strikes me more as a American Pale Wheat Ale....it has some soft citrus (oranges) on the nose and more so on the taste....feels thin and fizzy in texture....a little orange peel tartness on the finish....not a real enjoyable beer. Preferred ther whit and raspberry whit better....I'd be shocked if we see this one around in another year...their demo won't drink it and it fails with people who would drink it.."
""
"I tried this just the other day. I loved the original Shock Top aka Summer Heat, Spiced Wheat. It was a really good summer beer. I haven't tried any of their recent offerings up until this. It's not a bad beer, it just isn't a really good beer. It pours a quickly dissipating head. It is citrusy but the hops don't pack much of a punch. I'm intrigued by the Wheat IPA variety. However, I hope the next few I try are a little better."
"overall - first calling this an ""ipa"" is very deceptive and wrong - however the wheat flavors are there and for the price its not half bad - i do think the wheat beers from michelob are better"
"With that said, this beer is labeled as an IPA and I've held it to those standards. Despite it being a fair beer otherwise, I refuse to let ""American Pale Wheat Ale"" be a crutch for it to gimp along on. Even the less educated BMC drinkers deserve a little more oomph in this beer."
"O- I wouldn't really call this an IPA, but it's a very drinkable beer. However if you are looking for a hop fix, this isn't for you."

"12oz bottle, pours a cloudy but bright orange with a thick, foamy head that dissipates to a thin foam atop the ale and leaves some lacing on the glass in the process. Aromas are orange, wheat, and spice - nothing special...I was hoping for more hop aroma. Tastes are muddled: orange, wheat, bready malt, and a sort of spiciness that resembles coriander but is odd in flavor (familiar to the other Shock Tops and the Bud Light Wheat AB made in the past), and maybe some herbal hops that are just muddled in the mix of odd flavors. Overall, I've had the other Shock Tops and was unimpressed, but felt compelled to try this just for the sake of trying it. It was worse than I expected, and expectations were not set very high. Avoid this beer."

"Conclusion: This beer is a baby step towards hop-forward macro beer, but the starting place was far from being ""hoppy"". However for a macro-brewed offering it could be much worse and it does grab with a slightly more bitter feel and brighter flavors than is typical with this class of craft lookalikes."
