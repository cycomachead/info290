"355ml bottle. Shaker glass. Enjoyed on agt´11. Bright golden color, chill haze in appearance. Brief, white, head leaves some spotty lacing on sides. Yeasty – fresh bread- & fruity aromas. Moderate fruit sweetness followed by dry bitterness with grape zest notes. Bread crust hues in the middle, slightly harsh grainy sensation. Medium body, medium carbonation. Quite bland & flat. Not as refreshing as expected from a Pale Wheat."

"Overall - It doesn't taste like I expected but it's pretty good."

"Pours a cloudy, golden/copper color. 7/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and slight lacing. Smells of wheat, sweet malt, slight pale malt, and yeast. Fits the style of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, yeast, wheat, slight grain, slight sweet malt, and a hint of citrus. Overall, a good wheat beer, but the citrus is almost non-existent."

"M - Fairly carbonated"
"D: Not too many Pomegranate Wheat beers other there – so props for that. While the focus is on the fruit, this does have some things going on in the base wheat beer. Given the fruit and sweetness, this could be seen as a “chick beer.” I can’t see myself having more than one or maybe two in a row, but it does make a nice summer – light and refreshing – desert beer."
"Makes for a nice beer at the pool. It's also a much better summer offering from Saranac than their Summer Ale or their Summer Brew."
"Slightly opaque color then it is a style of white. Nose of wheat which is, as was thought, quite light and strong body weak and watery. Fortunately, the aftertaste safety, such as flavored with apple pectin and seed grenades just a little dope mix. Despite the lack of finish, the grenade brings a real plus and it is far from grenadine syrup commercially available that give too much glucose in beer. Here everything is light and the taste is that of the first Wheat although it is far from exceptional."
"This is a good fruit beer and not one to shy away from."
"O: I liked since it had some malt character. I'm not partial to flavored beer that are so much so that they are one-dimensional."
"Taste is light grain, crisp, faint yeastiness & faint juiciness, lightly sweet with faint tartness at finish. No Pomegranate taste is really evident. It’s not great, but it’s not bad, either."
"Picked this one up for my wife yesterday as part of a mixed six pack. Luckily I only grabbed one, as this one really sucked. After about half the bottle between us, we gave it to Hank the Dog, who looked at it and walked away. Poured a lightly hazy golden color with a fluffy white head. Very muted aromas, a little wheat and a little pomegranate but not much else. Same on the palate, not a lot of flavor, crisp and light bodied."
"D: Very drinkable and refreshing brew. Highly recommended!"
"D- A great idea, but I just find it lacking. Some tweaks could turn this into a better beer, but right now, it's just subpar."
"This wheat beer pours out as a cloudy golden color with a fluffy white head that settles down pretty quickly. The aroma is a little tart smelling on the nose. The taste of this beer is a little on the weak side. I know how strong Pomegranates can be so I thought that this would have a bigger flavor. There is a light tartness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light and soft like most wheat beers."
"It poured a thick head of a typical wheat, and very hazy. Not much to smell it would have been a very faint pomegranatey slightly citrusy fruity notes. The taste wasn't bad, you could tell it was a wheat beer from the appearance but didnt taste much of one. Very carbonated but didnt feel like it on my palate. I would probably drink this beer again, but I'm a sucker for wheat bears."
"The mouthfeel and drinkability are both great - it's crisp and light-bodied. The juiciness of the flavor especially helps the drinkability. Don't come in here expecting anything more than what the bottle says - pomegranates and wheat. A successful beer."
"Pomegranate Wheat pours a light gold color with minimal head and no lasting lace. The aroma has hints of dough, fruit, and vanilla followed by a flavor with a good balance of pomegranate juice, sweetness, and a citrusy tang. It has a medium mouthfeel with more pomegranate showing through in the finish. This beer is a very drinkable and refreshing brew. Highly recommended!"
"D - It's not an awful beer but it's not the greatest either. Average across the board, it's not something I'd ever seek out again."
"12 oz bottle. Pours golden, hazy from yeast with a nice head. Lots of carbonation. Aroma is fruity (reminds me of soda), bready. Light body. Taste like sweet, carbonated fruit juice. Sugar and honey dominate the flavor, some pomegranate perhaps. Good for thirst quenching but not much else"
"D-This is OK, but I am certainly not jonesing for another."
"Looks like an extremely clear wheat beer. The absolute lack of red color shows how little pomegranate is really in this beer. Either that or they used a non-colored extract. Unfortunately Pomegranate juice is quite expensive, and rarely used to its awesome potential. I mostly smell wheat yeast in the aroma, and the smell is quite mild along with the carbonation. There is a slight redness to the head which is interesting. Pomegranate sits in the back of the sip, mild fruity flavor, slight tartness, that mixes well with wheat yeast estsers that are happening. Aside from that you have an American wheat. Highly drinkable. Refreshing summer beer. I definitely drank this beer offseason. Pretty good though."
"D - Very drinkable beer. The overall mix of fruit flavors on top of the wheat beer is fairly well balanced and the beer overall is pretty refreshing."
"drinkability is really good. bought this for my girlfriend and she thought it was very ""krunkable"". i would buy this again, just because its cheap and local, and a very easy drinker, but i wouldnt really recommend this. nothing special."
"D - Decent fruit beer, but not really something I would go out of my way for."
"I really don't know why these beers cost more $10 for a case. Basically I guess a college kid could get drunk on these."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer on fire sale for $3 served in a standard pint glass a hazy orange with a thin off white head. Aroma is sweet fruits and not much else. The taste is sweet fruits with slight malts and hops, but not enough to overcome the lingering sweetness. The beer is of course light, but the sweetness gets in the way. This is a beer almost worth trying, but also worth passing by."
"D- Easy to drink, a little sweet but it goes down very smooth."
"D: Great little summer brew here.... Low ABV and very good flavors... Not overly fruited up... nice blend. Worth a shot."
"Drinks really easy, much better than I thought it would be. Pretty refreshing"
"good smooth mouth feel it is pretty average in body the fruit flavor has a good ratio in it and is not over powering at all that makes this beer a good summer beer to have"
"D - I have never tried pomegranate so don't really know what to look for but quite enjoyed this brew."
"The only other pomegranate beer I've had was from Moylan's, which was merely okay, so I'll admit I was a little worried about Saranac's version. This is a nice little surprise."
"A faddish beer. Could have some appeal to a type of beer drinker, but only for a short time."
"D- eh, its alright. Pomegranate doesn't mix well with beer...maybe if the flavors were a little stronger, it would. As is...meh"
"D - A nice decent beer."
"I was excepting better."
"Drinkability: I would have this again on a hot summer day. I recommends to those seeking a solid wheat profile wit a subtle red fruit tang. Better alternative than BMC."
"Brown bottle with no indication of freshness poured into a weizen glass. Appears a cloudy light golden color with less than a finger of white head that is gone half way through the experience. Aroma smells primarily of wheat with a bit of sulfur and a slight hint of unidentifiable fruit in the back that is most likely the pomegranate's contribution. Taste is mostly wheat with again the same unidentifiable fruity sweetness. However, there is a lingering flavor in your mouth very similar to when/if you chew up the core of a pomegranate seed. Light feel with a moderately high level of carbonation. As it warms a bit more of the pomegranate flavor comes forward and contributes to the sweetness. As a lawnmower beer it is drinkable enough that I could see easily being able to drink a few of these. However, if really looking to sit and enjoy the flavor of a wheat beer, I would most likely pass on this in the future."
"This is a solid good wheat, nothing to get you out of your seat and go out and by a case, but easy drinking ale. Its light too which helps make it work as an session brew. Has a malty/hoppy flavor that is seems to merge into the pomegranate which seems to somehow hide its bitter aftertaste in some hidden place. Nothing exciting but a good brew none the less."
"D - Really a treat and have three more. A fruit beer done right that is also affordable. Also great tasting. Well done Saranac."
"Taste, a sweet mess. Just drink Kool Aid and amp up the sugar, blend it with one of their other questionable beers (amber wheat) and you've got this beer. Just a brutal drainpour. Save this for a sugar craving or something."
"Offers just enough fruitiness to keep things interesting, yet without overwhelming the senses and compliments the wheat flavors well."
"Overall: Worth the price? Probably. Would I buy it again? No. Recommend it? No. Search it out? No."
"D: The 2nd best Saranac brew I've had so far, a nice little fruit beer which would be a real crowd pleaser."
"Pours a hazy . rusty gold color with fluffy white head, diminishes quickly. Scent is tart and acidic with very little touches of grain. Taste is rather mild, the pomegrantate is forward, slightly tart and acidic, touches of lemon, and the wheat is pale to the extent it does not shine through. Light bodied, active carbonation, slightly dry. A decent beer that is light and refreshing and doesnt overpower."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip. Thin white head quickly dissipates leaving only a straw colored body and some minimal soapyish lacing. Aroma is of mildly sweet malt and some mild fruit flavor that I assume is pomegranate. Taste is actually pretty refreshing, again, mildly fruity, not too sweet, I'm sure because of an addition of wheat. Light citrus notes round it off. Nothing exceptional but solid summery-type beer. Paired pretty well with french toast."
"This beet is light and pretty drinkable. Going down smooth with a good amount of carbonation, this would go well with some nice BBQ."
"(D) i have fond memories early on in my beer drinking of happily sessioning these. for whatever reason, i had trouble finishing this one tonight."
"Comments: The surprise is how well they have accentuated a refreshing wheat beer with a very well done balance between the normal wheat flavor/tartness and pomegranate fruit. The pomegranate adds just enough complexity to keep this beer interesting without interfering with its basic refreshing nature. The Columbus hops character comes out more as the beer warms, so if you like citrusy American hops, let this beer warm slightly before you drink it."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of fruit and grains. Taste is good, fruits but not really sweet, well balanced. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality brew."
"Pretty good summer beer but its too sweet for my taste."
"D: Great for a hot summer day, However I probably wouldn't have more than two or three in one sitting. It can become alittle too sweet."
"D - Sits light enough. Wouldn't protest another. A very modest beer, nothing wrong with it though. Any wheat fan may find this interesting. Go for it."
"Taste is pretty decent! The fruit is mild and crisp so it's not overwhelming. It's very easy drinking and the fruity flavors are subdued by the wheat leadi to a real easy drinking fruit beer."
"D: Nothing complex about this beer and about what I expected but refreshing nonetheless. Not over the top with the pomegranate and it actually goes well in this beer."
"I'm wary of fruit beers, especially of fruit wheats, and doubly especially weary of fruit wheats with cute animals on the label. But this isn't bad."
"This is a beer that could be sipped or drank very quickly as a refresher - I drank mine way too quickly but that s cause I enjoyed it."
"D: Hate to call it a hot weather brew, because tonight was anything but, however I'd probably enjoy it more outside in the sunshine. Paired pretty well with my nachos & salsa con queso. At 4.7% ABV, it's meant to be a light session refresher for those warmer days or for the non-discriminating fruit beer fan you know."
"Pours a cloudy pale straw white a thick white fomay head that retreats quickly, leaving behind some mild lacing. The smell is rather weak, with a watered-down pomegranate trying to clash with an even weaker banana-clove. The taste has more strength to it, but not by all that much. The pomegranate is still quite watered-down, while the yeastiness fights with it at all sides, resulting in something of a confused weissbier taste. Luckily, though, the body isn't too thick or heavy, keeping the drinkability at a relatively high level."
"Hazy, honey blonde with a big soapy white head that leaves some lace behind. Pomegranate and wheat malt make up the smell. Fruity, light and a tad under malted pretty much sums it up. Light bodied, borderline watery with soft carbonation. Easy drinking enough, you could do worse but you could do a lot better too."
"Ok this beer didn't have a huge pomegranate taste, but it was still enjoyable."
"It's a quaffer with some light flavour which keeps it crisp, refreshing but lacking the X-factor that would make it appeal to me."
"Value: $1.50 for a single, not bad at all."
"A very good wheat beer, with the added Pomegranate flavours. Certaintly something I could drink more of."
"I must admit ive been looking forward to trying this beer as i have never tried a brew which has been infused with pomegranate so here goes,it pours a semi cloudy very pale amber hue with nice carbonation that leaves a foamy two finger head that hangs around with very nice lacing,the aromas are straight out pomegranate its very dominant on the nose with feint hints of wheat aswell,the taste doenst fair so well to be honest it has a averagely thin mouthfeel with a semi sweet/sour taste almost funky with pomegranate being abit too stand outish in this beer for my liking and the wheat definately plays second fiddle even though you still taste it id prefer a better pairing or less pomegranate,so obviously this brew doesnt fair to well with me on a drinkabilty scale."
"i like the effort and for the summer its a good beer."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a clear, very slightly reddish tinged golden yellow color. There was a large, fizzy white head on it that dropped away almost immediately. The aroma is mild. Some slightly sour pomegranates as well as some wheat. Slightly sour taste, some wheat and some pomegranate. It's not bad, but I'm not sure if I like it or not."
"On-tap at the Buffalo Brewpub. A chick drink, but not bad. A good appearance, with a lasting white head. Super lacey, with cloudy bannana bodyA juice infusion of pomegranate whatever makes the combination with real sourish wheat very pineapple. Fresh though neutral aroma. Creamy mouthfeel, representing this sweet beer style found everywhere."
"Poured a cloudy amber with a moderate head that faded to a collar. The aroma was pretty weak, I got nothing. I was expecting something very sweet, but the taste was actually just a bit sweet and more sour (I liked it). The feel was light bodied with decent carbonation. Drinkability was good. I did like this one better than the BA average."
"Got this bottle in the mixed 12-pack of summer. I probably never would have bought this on its own. Poured into my pint glass. Pours a murky reddish gold with no head on top at all. No lace either. Smells of faint fruits and mealy bread. The mouth is highly carbonated to an almost harsh level. Not pleasant. Mild unoffensive flavors in this. Some subtle fruitiness, honey, and slight bittering grass finish. Not as bready as I thought it was going to be. Not too bad, but not that great."
"The finsh is again lacking with some vague aftertaste that is not unpleasant, just lacking."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, not the type of beer that I normally drink, but there are better fruity wheat beers out there."
"Would be nice with BBQ chicken or anything with a sweet tangy sauce"
"I would say this beer is pretty drinkable and refreshing. I would drink it again, but there isn't too much I would pass up if offered instead."
"Overall, a swing and a miss (amybe a foul tip at best) on this one. Nothing really drawing you to take the next sip. Not horrific, and easy to drink as the flavors are muted and mellow, but you will not seek this one out. Multi-pack residual purchase at best."
"Pomegranates are a bitter fruit, and I think they captured an authentic taste in that respect. It might be an unusual combination but it was a pleasant surprise, even with a thicker body than expected. It would be easy to go through these on a hot day."
"Pretty drinkable, but this has to be your thing. Right on the border between an American Pale Wheat and a Fruit Beer."
"A cold hazy, dark yellow color with a decent cap of foam. Banana, apples, clove and cinnamon in the nose. The body of the beer reflects the wheat character. Spice and malt upfront. It moves dryly through the center. A tart (pomegranate?) and citrus finish laced with spice. Overall better than I expected."
"D - I struggled a bit to get thru this beer both times I had it. The sickly sweet pomegranate flavors and wheat taste conflict with each other and the result is an unpleasant, simple beer which I can only assume was targeted at females and macro beer drinkers. I've never been a fan of flavored wheat beers and this is no exception. Thumbs down from me Saranac. Maybe you should have kept that honey you traded and used it to brew something decent."
"Pours a hazy orange color with a pinky finger head which gives way to good lacing. The smell is of fruit and floral aromas. The taste is a harsh pomegrante taste. The taste isn't overly fruity and you can't really grasp what the other flavors are. The mouthfeel is harsh, there is a moderate amount of carbonation. The drinkability is okay, it is slightly refreshing yet it does have a harsh bite to it."
"Pours a slightly cloudy dark lemon with a quickly dissipating head. Smell is light on the nose...hints of fruit with a slight wheat presence. Taste is surprising. It has a real juice presence that is rich, yet not cloying. The wheat aspect is understated, but there. Mouthfeel is rcih and smooth...very surprising...not crisp like other wheats. Drinkability is good due to smooth quality..actually a tad heavier than most wheats...but a nice quality."
"D: Certainly not the most drinkable brew in the summer pack but drinkability is high nonetheless."
"overall - Once again, another offering from the summer pack that's not groundbreaking, but solid."
"Drinkability: An above average lawnmower beer. The fruit is not overpowering. One of Saranac's better offerings. I could have several."
"The pour was what you would expect from a wheat, with a decent amount of head. There wasn't the overpowering pomegranate flavor that i was worried about, but in this case it wasnt a good thing. The traditional wheat flavors were masked by a bitter, slightly fruity tang that left my toungue itchy. The mouthfeel was rough and i struggled to get through it. Not a horrible beer but just not good. Not really what i wanted to accompany my bacon and eggs. There are better fruit wheat beers to be had."
"Cloudy gold in color with little to no head. Mild fruitiness to the nose but it stays pretty neutral by comparison to other fruit beers. The attack is sweet. There are no traditional beer flavors at first as the sweetness stands out. The flavor is definitely fruity and a bit syrupy. The finish is surprisingly clean. The beer is good, but it is not nearly as unique as the name might suggest. Its just another type of fruit that has been used in a beer and no earth shattering new flavor has come from it. The sweetness imparts a thickness to the mouthfeel."
"D: For what it is, it really hits the spot, a simple wheat ale that has enough pomegranate to really stand out."
"D - About halfway through this and didn't even notice. Seems like a good picnic beer. (Edit: This last half is getting harder and harder to drink. Definitely a little cloying going on here)"
"Drinkability: Enjoyable, but not really beer flavored, more juice flavored. I think I will enjoy the next beer, but would not buy a six pack."
"D-Under 5% with enough flavour and a sharp crisp feel this is a VERY nice summertime drinker. Certainly the kind of beer begging for a bbq or concert on the lawn."
"i don't know, catching maybe some sense of hops as this warms up. a nice try, but no sense of pomegranates..."
"The last time I had this it was at the Boilermaker 15k race up near the brewery and they were handing out free glasses outside to the runners. Managed to snag some even tho I didn't run a foot. Brings back those memories and makes me look forward to summer a bit more."
"I really liked it, will definitely get it again. Probably take with me to the beach on vacay. No complaints."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle marked 1119-1800. Sampled on May 20, 2009. It pours a cloudy lemony-looking amber with a dash of fuzzy head that sticks around for most of the sampling. I really do not catch whiff of anything extraordinary in the aroma. It has a faint wheat-like or grassy smell but I did not notice any pomegranate. Kind of a watered down mouth feel. The flavor lends itself OK for a hot day but it is rather tart and sour. I notice a tidbit of pomegranate in the taste but not the aroma. Eh, nothing to write home about."
"I don't know what I was expecting, but I am surprised this beer has been rated so highly by the rest of the BA community."
"If this beer stuck true to the name POMEGRANATE and put more of it in the drink this probably would have been a damn near perfect beverage."
"D- Easy to drink. Would never turn one down and may look for it again."
"D= I'd survive if it was the only beer available but I really prefer standard Wheat Beer (or any beer) without the curiosity factor."
"Beer number two out of my summer sampler pack. Poured into a weizen glass. Color is an orange-amber color with about 1/4 to 1/2 inch of light head. Smell is light and fruity. Taste is light and smooth, wheaty with a nice splash of pomegranate. Mouthfeel is light and smooth. Drinkability is very good. The light, smooth wheat flavor with the crisp splash of pomegranate makes for a wonderful beer to enjoy in the sunshine."
"Final Thoughts - This is a standout for Saranac. It's unusual without straying too far from what a wheat beer should be. I will definitely keep enjoying this one. Give it a try, and be surprised at how good Saranac can be."
"Overall, tastes more like a honey wheat. Needs both more pomegranate and wheat."
"great light beer for an early friday afternoon off work..."
"D- slightly above average for the style. The sweetness cuts the wheat flavor well. Overall a very bland brew."
"Not my kind of beer, but I appreciate its uniqueness."
"Drinkability is a bit above average. This is an interesting take on the style and I wouldn't have expected someone to choose pomegranate as a fruit flavor to blend it with, however with the current craze being pomegranates I understand why. Not a bad beer, just not my bag."
"12 oz brown bottle with one cool juggling bear on the label. Pours a honey/gold color with a thin white head. I was expecting a little more of a reddish hue. Faint aroma of wheat malt. Taste is very predestrian with no outstanding qualities. Some malt with a little fruity sweetness. Not over the top like some fruit beers are. Very refreshing. Good for parties if for no other reason than showing off the label."
"Overall - The pomegranate tones are too weak. Sourness is there but the flavor of the brew is weak overall. Tastes like a sour Belgian witte. I probably won't be eager to try this again."
"(rated May 8, 2007)"
"Reviewed on 4/17/08. Bottle. An interesting beer. Aroma of apple juice. Flavor of more apple and pear and pomegranate I guess (I've never actually had pomegranate before, but I'd assume it's somewhere in here). Slight wheat presence. I enjoyed this at first, but then it started to get a little too sweet. Decent though. I suppose I would get this again if I was in the mood for a fruity, sweet, light-bodied beer. 6/4/5/3/11 (2.9/5)"
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, a part of a Saranac sampler pack picked up at the grocery store. Pours a medium yellow, slightly cloudy. Both the smell and the taste are a little too sour for my taste, too fruity, though not particularly pomagranate. I probably wouldn't do this one again."
"D - Average but would probably be refreshing on a warm summer day."
"I find this very drinkable, despite not going wild over it. Not a huge fan of the brewery in general, but this is okay. Am I glad I tried it? Yes. Would I buy it again? Probably not."
"Drinkability: Well its easy to drink, it tastes fine. Overall, I think the flavor is weak so I'm not too excited about it, even if I could easily have a couple."
"D - Not bad good as a summer beer"
"Overall - The pomegranate flavor is not overwhelming. Its just enough to give it that wow factor."
"Cloudy, yellowish red. Minimal white head that disappears quickly. Smell is light. Wheat with fruit, but it doesn't remind me of pomegranate. Taste is hard to pin down. Yeasty and wheaty and slight fruit-like taste but it doesn't taste like pomegranates to me. There's a strange taste, and now that I notice it the smell is similar. I'm assuming it comes from the malt and wheat, but I can't describe it. It kind of tastes like some breweries smell. That strange malt-like aroma, but I've never tasted it in a beer before. Lots of carbonation. Thin. Would be refreshing if it were a little fruitier. You could throw down a bunch of these if you wanted, but I wouldn't. This is my first Saranac Brew. Hopefully their other offerings are a little better."
"Nice beer to have on pic nics, camping trips, BBQs, and tailgaiting when your friends are drinking BMC."
"D: Good drinkability"
"Truly, I've never had a pomegranate so I'm not sure what it's exactly supposed to taste like. Also, this beer had such little flavor of this fruit I couldn't really make an opinion. I don't like my fruit beers overpowering in anyway but this one seemed to not have enough and tastes like a bland, wheat ale basically."
"This created a finger of off-white head with very low retention. The color was a cloudy orangish-amber. The nose was on the sour side with a light fruitiness underlying the sourness. The mouthfeel was medium with a slightly sour taste on the tongue, followed by a light, sweet fruitiness. The finish was dry and refreshing. This was definitely a nice beer to have on a humid summer evening."
"There's a gentle creaminess to the palate, too, that makes this one especially drinkable. All in all, not a bad Summer beer. I'd drink it again."
"Large off-white head with very good retention and impressive lacing. Honey colored with orange hues. Aromas are light, generic fruits, sour wheat and a pleasant sweetness. Flavors are not as sweet as the aromas suggests. Wheat flavors come through clearly especially on the finish. Pomegranate flavors are underneath but present. Tangy with a pleasant crisp nip at the end. Light body and very summery, a good version of a fruit beer because it refrains from being too sugary and the flavors are unique."
"id want a 6 of these if i was at one of these drug friendly 'music festivals' where i could carry one around and wait for some hippy chick to stumble into me... she'd be amazed at how yummy and organic a pomegranate beer sounds and ask for some assuming that her somewhat clear skin and carefree attitude were charming enough to get a free beer from any guy at the place... i'd let her finish mine of course as we walked back to my tent for the rest..."
"This was the first beer I reviewed, however it was on tap that time. It was much better on tap. I don't think I will be revisiting this one in a bottle, but if it's hot out and it's on tap I may be tempted."
"overall- An enjoyable summer beer, not to sweet but easy to quaff."
"Poured into a weizen glass and received a dark gold body with medium cloudiness and a two finger head that died slowly and left some lacings. A somewhat standard wheat beer smell, some yeast strains along with minor spice and a decent amount of fruit. The smell was a little strained though, a little different due to the pomegranate berries. I thought it was a decent taste, light-bodied and fluffy with some sweetness coming from the wheat and some fruit flavors. Being that I like to drink Pomegranate flavored Aquafina, I could pick out the Pomegranate and it is mixed in alright, but it sticks out and gives a typical wheat beer a somewhat sour strain and a little syrupiness. A good beer, but I hope they tweak with the recipe a little for next summer."
"D - I tihnk I found a favorite American Pale Wheat Ale. Uncomplicated, but without really being ""boring."" Judging within style, to me this seems underrated. A very good warm weather beer, though I could enjoy this anytime. Unfiltered, that's also a nice touch. File under ""A Pleasant Surprise."" Definitely give this one a go."
"I generally prefer something other than wheat beers and fruit beers, but this fruity wheat really hits the spot. It is smooth, mellow, and crisp with great drinkability."
"Try it!"
"D: This a good summer wheat brew. Has a touch of fruit flavors coming out, but the wheat does has front and center stage. Good brew for the style."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Low alcohol and decent flavor make this one easy to drink. Not overly complex and slightly sweet. An enjoyable brew."
"D: Refreshing, a highly drinkable summer beer. I could put back 3-4 on a sunny day. However, the supposed pomegranate is nowhere to be found (other than a general fruitiness), and the flavor's not very complex. A good wheat ale, but I wouldn't drink it out of season."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't buy a 6-pack of this, but overall it isn't too bad, and I could certainly drink a few, which is more than I would say for a lot of fruit beers, even though the wheat certainly helps it be more tolerable than if it were just a lager."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a hazy golden orange color with a creamy white head that leaves a good amount of lacing around the glass. The slightly floral aroma features some wheat and pomegranate. The taste is a little sweet, but not overly cloying which is definitely a good thing as some fruit beers tend to be. Overall, Saranac Pomegranate Wheat is a pretty solid American Wheat that does not overdo the fruit flavors like some tend to do. It is highly drinkable, and would be a perfect thirst quencher on a warm day. Worth a shot."
"Too sweet, but the pomegranate flavor is nice."
"Worth a shot..."
"D: not my style, but a nice fruit wheat beer nonetheless. good summer brew."
"Very drinkable on its own or with a meal. Great summertime, man its hot, brew. Refreshing indeed."
"This beer poured a cloudy copper with a single finger head that lingered. The smell is very fruity with somemild wheat characteristics. The taste starts off with some citrus that is cut rather quickly by slightly tart pomegranate. The mouthfeel is a little watery with less carbonation than I expected. This is a pretty tasty drink, but it's more flavor than beer. I'm not normally much for flavored beers, but this came in the summer sampler and I was pleasantly surprised."
"Easily accessible and refreshing. This could make some people curious about craft beer. Those that already like craft should find this to be a nice palate cleanser as well as a nice take on a style that is easy to get wrong."
"Body medium, soft and slick. Good drinkability for a hot summer day."
"D. Pretty good. Nothing special, but by no means bad."
"Notes: This may be my new favorite summertime outdoor party drink."
"It sounds good, but all I can think is that it's a blander and less adventurous version of Sam Adams Cherry Wheat."
"Another clouded wheat ale with a touch of a pink haze going on large white head that sticks around for quite awhile nice bands of lacing form as well. Aromatics a little bit of random tart smelling jam, with some citrus and yeast qualities going on pretty tame in the scent. Flavor sweet tart I guess pomegranate, but I'm not an avid Indian apple eater. So, if you ask me that could be any tart fruit flavor with a standard American Wheat. Not a bad combo just forgettable and nothing more memorable even though it's high in anti-oxidants. Body is light and crisp with carbonation, nothing extraordinary only bland yeast stays on the palate. Drinkability wise I could pass on another of these and I gasp at the thought of a whole twelve pack of this stuff like on the label I saw they're selling it in that format and cans. I was excited about the cans but why can't they just put the Kolsch or Golden Pilsner in those instead I'd buy either."
"The grain is soured by the pomegranate in the aftertaste. The fruit has taken over by this point, but because of the specific taste of pomegranate, the taste isn't what I consider desirable. In my opinion, pomegranate fruit itself has a wonderful starting flavor but bad aftertaste. The beer holds to this and although some people may love it, it doesn't necessarily turn my screws."
"D: Nice but not great. I found this to be refreshing and enjoyable. I would probably drink this again but I don't know that I would go out of my way for it."
"This is an okay wheat beer, probably the most enjoyable on a hot summer day. It's slightly refreshing overall. Don't pick this one up thinking you're going to get a blast of pomegranate though. It's there in the flavor, but it's not the main flavor element in the beer."
"It's pretty good for a fruit beer, if you like fruit beer. Not my thing, really, but I can certainly see this one appealing to people that like the style."
"Flavorful and unique. I could drink these all day. One of the best fruit beers in my opinion. Worth the cash."
"Nice enough as a lunch time beer, probably fairly decent as a summertime cooler as well. Worth a try and would likely fit in nicely in certain situations, but not one I'd go looking for. Maybe the kind of beer to have when you're not looking for a beer?"
"Saranac Pomegranate Wheat has potential, but it will probably have to be brewed by some other brewery for that potential to be realized. That pretty much sums it up. The end."
"Saranac Pomegranate Wheat pours a hazy amber with a thin white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. I don't get much out of the aroma. This is a light bodied, wheaty beer that has a touch of what I guess is pomegranate. It's not unpleasant, but I wouldn't buy it again."
"D - A tremendous session beer... Truly is a relaxing beer to be enjoyed... While it may be a spring/summer seasonal, I could enjoy this all year long..."
"Found this seaosnla option at the Saranac brewpub at the Albany airport on draft. My expectations were definitely low. Looked a nice ruby with a fair abount of head and carbonation. They could not have balanced out the fruit with the hops and malts any better. Actually quite tasty but not over the top. Not a bad choice at all and worth trying again."
"I could drink a boatload of this based on the sheer quenching it does on the thirst, but honestly, not a real great brew IMO."
"D: I think I have finally figured it out. Just drink a Saranac beer do not review it. Much more enjoyable that way. Would be a nice summer beer and has been for me."
"D- One was fine for me, but I can see this as a good summer poolside beer"
"Probably belongs in the class of lawn mower beers, although I would say this more flavorful."
"Wonderfully surpised by the taste of this beer. I am usually very adverse to Fruit beers, but was in an adventurous mood and figured what the hell. Defninitely a great summer beer. Ended up buying an entire case. Have not been able to find it in my area, will have to travel up to NY in the summer to buy more. Very tasty."
"D: Not to drinkable, like a sour v8 only with a thiner body. pass."
"Drinkability: Much like the bear on the label, this beer does an decent job at juggling the pomegranates, though maybe this beer would be better had I not drank it in the dead of winter."
"I really enjoyed this beer. I was at first wary of it because of the recent fad of putting pomegranate in everything, but I was proven wrong. It smells about how you would expect, fresh wheat beer and a hint of pomegranate. The taste was very refreshing with medium carbonation and a very pleasant touch of wild fruit. This beer could easily have mass appeal. I would buy it again in a heartbeat."
"not a typical fruit beer. well balanced, not too sweet. crisp and refreshing. great wheat flavor with a hint of pomegranate (which is one of the best fruits ever, in case you didnt know) if you're a fan of Long Trail's Blackbeary Wheat, be sure to give this a try."
"Overall? Let's be honest... if you've tried it you probably liked it, but don't want to admit it to your friends. It's like a guilty pleasure. You see the girls at the bar drinking Smirnoff Pomegranate and you don't want anything to do with something that sounds remotely close to that. Do yourself a favor, and try this if you haven't. This is a great summer beer, but there's a reason why the West End made this a year round brew."
"Pours a clouded straw/gold. Nose is slightly fruity with pomegranate. I mean it just smells like you would expect. I am starting to think that most of these fruit beers are all the same. Anyways. Onward. Flavor is actually a bit more full bodied that I had expected. Smooth and even. I am not really sure how much it tastes like pomegranate, but there it is. Mild wheat characteristics. The strongest part here is the fruit. Not much else. Feel is a bit thick on the liquid with a typical carbonation. Overall it is actually pretty drinkable. IMO it doesn't totally suck as a lot of these fruit beers end up being."
"Pours a cloudy yellow-bronze color with a thin bone white head that burns off quickly. Spotty lacing. Berry fruits and honey in the nose. Light-bodied and sweet with tart berry (I have to assume it is pomegranate), malt and honey flavors. The finish is short and sweet with a sweet fruit aftertaste. Nothing really noteworthy overall, but now I can check off another random fruit added to beer."
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date - served in a weizen glass. The beer pours a translucent orangey copper, with medium carbonation and a finger of loose, tan head. Smells like a nondescript wheat beer, with hints of pomegranate and maybe lemon. It has a pleasant flavor, with pomegranate, nutty wheat, and some green hops on top of a lightly-carbonated, medium body that leaves a light finish. Decent, but there are better fruit/wheat beers out there - this one needs a bit more depth."
"Tastes fruity esters over gentle malt sweet and mild hop bitter and flavor. Finishes dry with a cleansing carbonation that doesn't provide acid or sting. Pomegranate is present early and ghosts hang around into the aftertaste. Some red apple accompanies. Hop bitter is gentle and clean of grassy and coho. Hop flavor is lemony and light winterfresh. Malt sweet is definitely wheat gluteny. Aftertaste has a bit metallic. Light body and mouthfeel with strong carbonation. Much better than I was expecting."
"****Just to let you know i just paid 7.49 for a six pack less than a year later. DAMNIT!!! Saranac used to be the route for a decent microISH tasting brew for less price than a micro. Now its only 50 cents cheaper than a sam adams!"
"The delicate taste and clean finish make this a very drinkable beer. Good for beer-drinkers and non-beer-drinkers alike."
"cloudy amber color with a nice thick head but little lacing. Given the name I wonder if presenting it with a few fresh pomegranate pieces wouldn't help; similar to some blueberry ales. Aromatics are weak with hops but not insulting . Pomegranate is present, but not over bearing, plus a good balance of hops, malt and barley. Not to mention some airy notes of wheat and yeast for good measure. Smooth and with an even finish it drinks quickly. A good all around beer and not prohibitively expensive as some other brews, I found this a nice reminder of what summer was and will be."
"Pours a nice straw color, with very little head and little lacing. It has a nice crisp and malty scent to it, but with little in the way of a fruit scent. The pomegranate does come through in the taste, although not very strong. It does add a nice little fruit zip to a good wheat beer. They go down very easily. Worth a shot, especially if you like fruited wheat beers, as the pomegranate is pretty neat."
"Very refreshing beer, especially if you like pomegranates. Pours a nice reddish amber color with a nice white head with a a very light tint of pink. It has a very sweet smell of wheat and pomegranate. The taste is just as good. Very sweet, but not too sweet. The right mix of wheat and pomegranate makes it really refreshing, especially on a hot summer day. Very crisp, fresh mouthfeel and good clean aftertaste. A very very drinkable beer. Can't wait for next summer's batch!"
"The sweetness limits this beer's drinkability."
"Poured a cloudy bronze/copper color with a nice slightyly off-white head that stayed a while. Aroma was fruity and malty. Flavor is dominated by the fruit with a bit of tartness. I was afraid this one might be too sweet, but wasnt. Moutfeel was good, carbonation was soft. Not too bad, I enjoyed it."
"Overall, not an incredible beer...but one of my favorite wheat brews."
"As for my random thoughts; if your looking to taste a lot of fruit get a wine cooler, if you want lots of hops get an IPA; but if you want a flavourful Wheat beer with just enough fruit to give if good flavour and stay in balance this is what your looking for, it certainly delivers on its promises. This beer will certainly make it to my fridge every summer from this year forward."
"Pours a dull gold hue with a slight orange tint. Creamy one figner head shows decent retention and a few wisps of lace. Weak bouquet, some mild sweet fruit and faint pale malt aroma. Sweet two-row and wheat malt upfront, followed by mellow grainy taste and a blast of tart fruit puree flavor. The fruit taste does not seem distinctly pommegranate, but provides a dark and savory berry flavor albiet a somewhat processed and bruised character. The afteratste shows some very lightly spicy wheat yeast phenols like clove and bubblegum, as well and a faint light caramel taste. A low but balancing hop bitterness rounds out the sweetness along with the tart fruit and touch of yeasty spice. The sediment particles provide a little more texture to a light body and when matched with a med-high carbonation, a mouthfeel with an acceptable creaminess is achieved. While the overall flavor profile is varied and arguable complex, all the flavors are uniformily mild and some pleasent nuances are so background that the louder fruit character overshadows the tamer yeast and malt notes. The finish is clean and drying and allows a terriffic drinkability because there is no lingering fruit skin or tannic bite- an advantage this beer has over many other fruit beers."
"Drinkable and better than expected."
"Pours a cloudy orange-ish color with a white head. Aromas that are fruity and a dry sweetness characteristic. In the taste, dry and fruity, I am assumming pomegranate, a fruit I cannot say I have had. It also has a small tartness. A small syrupy mouthfeel, with a sweet / fruity aftertaste. It was quite nice with the pomegranate, a small tartness, yet a but syrupy."
"Drinkability - no problem knocking this sixer off while getting some valuable anti-oxidants to boot! :-)"
"Honestly, I'm rather impressed, the last Wheat/Fruit combo I had was a bit disappointing, this however was not. A unique but nice refreshing beer."
"The taste is fruity with the pomegranate coming trough nicely. Also has some sweet malt and a bit of wheat. This one is very drinkable."
"D- No question...able to drink quite a few of these. A quality beer imo."
"Light and tangy mouthfeel. Couldn't get past the syrupy feel knocked down the drinkability. Not very pleasing like a wheat beer should be. Saranac usually makes a decent and affordable beer this one was a bit of a letdown."
"Part of the 'Twelve Beers Of Summer' sampler pack. Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a frosty pint glass. Not much of a head on this one, but appearance is nice. Gotta love the wonderful wheat ale aroma....mmm. Taste is well above average for this style. Having been disappointed with fruit beers in the past, this one surely pleases. The pomeganate flavor is there, but stays in the back, where it should. Very drinkable. This is a definite 'session' canidate, which is rare for a fruit brew. No 'sickening sweet' going on here..(hello Sam's Cherry Wheat). As far as the sampler pack goes, the hefe was ok, the belgian white was average, the kolsch was excelent, but this one takes the blue ribbon. Another fine brew from a fine brewery."
"Finish is slightly spicy or peppery. Good drinkability, due to how well balanced it is."
"Drinkability is average, didn't have to pour it out. Not sure what the point of this is. Adding fruit juice to the fermentation? Why? There are some great weissbiers out there that stand on their own without any juices added, and some great fruit beers made with genuine whole fruit. IMO this is an experiment that shouldn't have made it past the pilot batch state."
"I had this on tap at Mister Moto's in Burlington IA. The appearance was hazy golden orange, thin 2-finger head. I don't know what pomegranate smells like, but after this beer I have an idea. It was a very nice contrast with the hefe-weizen yeasty esters, fruity and a little sweet. A very easy-to-drink beer, I had a couple."
"D - This isn't bad. It could be overpoweringly sweet but it isn't. I sample it after mowing my lawn and it was perfect for such an occasion."
"Decent wheat beer. Kind of a let down w/ a name like a pomegranate wheat. I was expecting more of an attempt of pomegranate but ended up tasting more like cherry and orange."
"Overall this was excellent and so far my favorite of the mixed pack. I could drink this fairly regular and thought it was a great addition to the lineup. Look forward to having another!"
"Pours a hazy, golden, slightly amber color with about a finger and a half of white head that sticks around for awhile but leaves only bits of spotty lacing. Aromas are mild all around. Smells like a weizen: a bit yeasty, some hints banana and clove but with some faint fruity notes, namely, as the name indicates, pomegranate. The taste, like the smell, is quite mild. Very weizen-like with the previously mentioned flavors but with a slight pomegranate flavor that takes control and is dominate, but still not overpowering, in the finish. Mouthfeel is pretty good. Light-medium body with low-moderate carbonation. In terms of drinkability this is pretty good. I enjoyed this beer and look forward to having another."
"12 oz brown bottle with no freshness date. Pours a cloudy medium amber with a one finger head, OK longevity and OK lace. Not much aroma, but I do get a bit of malt, fruit abd citrus. Taste is watered down. I get some malt and a grapefruit like bitterness. It is spritzy and easy drinking. A good hot weather beer but not a full flavored one."
"Usually when I sample beers for review, I do all the tasting last, but it was late, I poured this one and had a few swallows and this would be a beer I could reach for every day. It's nothing special, but the Pomegranate, it smoothed the taste and made this like an amber beer with a sweetness of honey and bitterness of sour fruit. It was almost average but something stuck out. Maybe it was the overall swallow of the beer that made this stick out, like a dessert beer, like something that you treat yourself too rather than drink regular. I'd get this again, it was that unique and familiar."
"pours a cloudy light amber color with a one finger white head and a small amount of lacing. pomegranate aromas in the nose. taste, pomegranate mixes nicely with the wheat malt and yeast. nice fruity taste. mouthfeel light to medium and carbonation is good. very enjoyable summer beer. i would buy it again."
"I like!"
"Pours a three finger thick white head that fades to a thin layer leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Fruity nose. Flavor is smooth, some fruity sweetness (pomegranate?), slight tart finish. Good summer beer. $1.50 for a 12oz bottle from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH."
"Not bad for a run-of-the-mill fruit wheat beer, which it pretty-much is. At least it doesn't have the syrupy or artificial taste that some fruit beers have."
"Overall light and refreshing wheat ale. The pomegranate was subtle, which was probably a good thing."
"Finish was decent, and as it turns out, this is about the only Saranac beer Ive tried so far that that I might actually buy again."
"Overall... a bit underwhelming, but not bad as such."
"Pretty good beer."
"This is the first pomegranate beer I've had. It poured a golden body with a reddish tint. Decent, white head with ok retention; does pretty well holding with the beer, There was really nothing to the smell of the beer; maybe a slight sweetness? The taste had nothing really in it either; kind of a bitter sweetness that held throughout the beer, but nothing too impressive. The mouthfeel was nice and full-bodied. The beer is nice and light and very drinkable overall. A good summer beer, but I was hoping for something with a little bit more of a taste. The beer was refreshing though."
"d: easy, not much at all hinders the drinkability here...not a bad beer at all from 'ol saranac"
"Saranac Pomegranite Wheat pours a hazy amber-orange body with a brass cast beneath a solid head of creamy white froth. The retention is good and it leaves short splashes and streaks of lace about the glass. The nose displays the typical Matt yeast and wheaty malt base with a subtle hint of apricot-like fruit. The flavor, however, displays more fruitiness, and the pomegranite is discernable, but without the tart quality normally found. It's well balanced and fairly drinkable. Interesting and enjoyable but not particularly exciting. A great beer for backyard barbeques, camping trips, and picnics!"
"Da: After really enjoying the amazing sam adam's Long-shot boysenberry-wheat ale not that long ago, i've come to respect these fruit beers on a new level. Overall: refreshing is it's best quality."
"Light and refreshing, but not something I would regularly seek out."
"The beer pours a golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light pomegranite scent laid over a mild wheat and pale malt aroma. The taste is good. It has a light and refreshing wheat malt flavor that goes down smooth and finishes sweet and fruity with a nice pomegranite touch. It's like most Saranac beers. It's a bit middle of the road, but it drinks well. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It's nothing over the top, but it goes down easy. That's the key, especially during these warm summer months."
"M&D - a soda like fizziness denies this beer smoothness, but gives it some life on the palate, not a great beer, but neat to try once, had it at the Ct Beer fest, was a bit better there, maybe it just needs to be colder"
"Drinkability: nice and refreshing. The fruitiness is not offensive, and this was a good beer to drink on a hot summer day. Give it a shot."
"Somewhat subdued in the first taste and not as sweet as I feared. It is refreshing but the texture is watery and can't hold up the taste. Somewhat flat and lifeless in the mouth. Hatte to say it, but this is typical Saranac: tease you with a nice appearance and nose and let you down when it really matters. Drinkable but so are hundreds of beers. I'll avoid in the future unless free."
"Notes: while I wouldn't buy a six-pack for myself (this bottle came in the Saranac summer sampler 12-pack), I could see this being a good beer to have on hand for the ladies in the summer."
"Drinkability- Great was a very enjoyable beer."
"Pours a hazy golden orange color with a thick tan head. Head dies out very quickly. Light carbonation. Aroma is fruity, pomegranate is noticeable, with a light yeast note. Flavor follows suit. Creamy. Fruit is not overbearing. Aftertaste is lightly of fermented fruit, but does not stick around long. I think they got this one right. Nice and refreshing. Not over the top or syrupy like some fruit beers."
"Drinkability - I could see finishing this one. Glad that i had the opportunity to try it, but am not really a wheat person, so won't be going back again. Saranac can keep hook'n me up with their Imperial IPA though."
"I was excited to try this beer as I find pomegranate to be a very interesting flavor addition, though I had never before tried it in a beer. The beer fell far short of my expectations though as this wheat brew is a weak addition to the saranac line up. Pours out a light gold with a finger of head and no lacing. Nose contains some light maltiness, along with just a touch of spice. The spice continues onto the tongue, but overall the taste is very light, and I would consider, Weak. Mouthfeel was decent, but this was overshadowed by the watery taste of the beer. Not recommended."
"Not having much of a pomegranate background, except through Bible references, I took my chance on our deck Memorial evening...my wife tells me they are also called ""Chinese apples"" and are rather expensive...one wonders how Saranac could ""afford"" to brew them into a sampler....pours an effervescent orange/brown haze; fizzing head reduces to small tracings...citrus notes with acidic appeal...all is working for this brew until the chew, which really is like chewing bark or some sort of forest timber...the taste mellows, unchallenging but leaving a lingering juicelike aftertaste...really not my thing, as authentic lambics, guezes and saisons handle the fruit realm with much more authority..."
"This beer is surprisingly better than I expected. It pours a slightly cloudy orangy and slightly reddish color with minimal lacing and some head. The smell is definitely sweet. If I didn't know it was pomegranate in there, I would have guessed at some other fruits. The taste is very subtle, sweet, and light, no doubt on the pomegranates and maybe some other slight fruity bits as well. The beer is moderately carbonated, very light on the alcohol, a little more malty than hoppy, but this is clearly a summer time refreshing beer that you could enjoy on a hot day."
"Got this one cause it was something I'd never heard of before, so why not. Pours a lighter amber-light brown color, with about a finger of white head on top that dissolves pretty quickly. Nose is very mild, a hint of fruit (grape maybe?) and a touch of wheat. Taste is fairly similar, only a little stronger. Pomegranate - which seems to be a fairly mild, smooth fruit - comes through first, and is pretty tasty. However, aside from some wheat, there's not a lot going on there. Feel is average, medium body. Overall, a good beer to have every once in a while for a change, although its not one I'd want to drink that much."
"D-a decent and refreshing beer for a hot summer afternoon. I probably couldn't have more than a few of these though due to the fruit. If you like ffruit beers this is a good choice. I am noting that the three I have tasted so far are all differenrt variations on the same theme"
"Pours a pale color with some lacing. The aroma isn't impressive at first, consisting of some fruitiness mixed in with the malt. The taste is the opposite as there's more of a sweet mix of pomegranate and wheat that seems to interact in some way. The end result is a bit sweet and hard to differentiate. Mind you, I've never had a beer with pomegranate flavors. Not too bad but feels somewhat off-balance."
"An OK beer but not a great one and one I need never try again."
"Pass."
"The wheat definitely gives a dry, bready feel. It's a decent fruity beer. Decent, but really nothing amazing. Best probably for non-beer drinkers."
"Pours a clear light copper with a slight touch of redness. An average white head that did not leave much lacing on the glass. The smell is hard to detect, I really can't pick up anything. The taste has a nice wheat backbone with a nice touch of pomegranate. Though if I didn't know this was a pomegranate brew, I would not be able to tell what fruit flavor it has. The feel is well carbonate crisp and light. A very drinkable summer beer, no offensive or cloying flavors."
"Overall, a good light beer. I would like to see some thicker beers of this style out there though."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a hazy light orange with a frothy white head. The smell is underwhelming, sweet notes from the fruit with some wheat characteristics. The taste isn't very strong but the flavors are balanced extremely well. The sweetness doesn't overpower the wheat, or dominate the beer, yet it adds a unique flavor. The mouthfeel is light and smooth, great for a summer beer. This one is a very easy drinker and wouldn't get annoying like some fruit beers after one. Worth checking out. Enjoy."
"D - very drinkable beer, good seasonal offering from Saranac."
"A refreshing, interesting Pale Wheat. Good for the novelty and the summer season."
"This is a very respectable, easy to drink fruit beer. In the same vein as the Boysenberry Wheat offering from Sam Adams (part of the Longshot series), this is better. Flavors of a nice light tongue tingling wheat are coupled with the sweetness of what I can only imagine is fresh pomegranate juice. Neither dominates the other. Rather they come together in harmony for a very enjoyable experience. This is a nice lawnmower ale, perfect, since the weather is starting to turn towards summer."
"Good brew from Saranac. Highly drinkable spring time choice. Now lets add the pale, ipa, and some others brews and make this a real 12 beers of summer."
"Very drinkable. Perfect summer afternoon beer."
"This beer is from the ""12 Beers of Summer"" pack. The beer pours a hazy gold/orange color with an inch white head which goes away quick. It smells like wheat and a bit of fruit, but the aroma is light. It tastes like wheat and some pomegranate. Luckily the pomegranate flavor is light and not overwhelming, and it's not light enough where you can't taste it, the fruit flavor is done right. Mouthfeel is light and a little bit watery, but it is crisp. Drinkability is good, I could drink a few of these on a hot day. It's a decent, refreshing beer that has just the right amount of fruit flavor to make it good and drinkable."
"Not bad hot day drinking."
"Hazy golden orange. Small white head shrinks to a soapy film before too long. Softly fruity aroma dusted with a light sweetness. Reminds me of MH's #9 in its character. Sweet fruitiness sticks to the grainy wheat for a moment before giving way to a lingering cereal quality. Not too sweet or syrupy but, at the same time, not too light or watery. Fairly crisp and just enough flavor to keep things moderately interesting. I see nothing wrong with knocking back a couple of these on a hot day."
" This is one of the better offerings from Saranac that I've had, but seeing how I didn't think too highly of their winter selection, that's not saying a whole lot. This is worthy a try for the novelty factor of the pomegranate, and for the relatively cheap price of the 6-pack. Beyond that, it's like most of their other beers - light, watery, and lacking in complexity."
"It pours a light cloudy amber with a little bit of white head that left bits of lace on the glass. The smell has red fruit (obviously), but it's also got some yeastiness and a light herbal hop. Tastes a little candyish up on the front end of the taste, but the tartness of the pomegranate and a dry finish on the beer actually work well to make you want that next sip or that next bottle."
"Overall- Quite bland. Not worth the $2 I paid for a 12oz."
"Um... So yeah, pours an amber type color with a white headskie... but um, where do we go from there? Taste is nice and smooth, but nothing wonderful. Not well drinkable or mouthfelt at hand. Alas, Saranac has yet another subpar brew on their hands..."
"Well I THINK spring has sprung here in western NY so I picked a beer to go along with the warmer weather theme.Poured into weizen glazz a dull hazed peachy color with a nice tight,sticky 1 1/2 finger head that left spotty lace as it settled slowly,toasty wheat malt a long with pomegranate juice aromas a hint of leafy hop shows up as well.Somewhat sweet from the pomegranate juice drying out pretty well with toasty dry almost leafy finish.Although my wife loves the beer its not a ""girly"" beer it has subtle complexity,a decent offering from Saranac better than expected."
"drinkability - I'm a POM guy so I was very interested in this. Taste great, would buy again. Even though it is a very small percent of Pom juice in it I would think. It is the beer that is good for you!"
"Brew pours to a cloudy orange/golden color with a small white head that broke down very quickly and only left a trace of lacing. The aromas seem to be mostly wheat with a sweet smell that I suppose would be the fruit mixing with the malt? The fruit smell to me does not scream pomegranate but is nice, I think what I like the most about it is that it is not in your face, seems to be just playing along with everything. The flavors are also nice, very east drinking with a crisp feel. You pick up a slight wheat flavor, which lead to semi-sweet flavor that seems to be from the juice. No bitterness that I can pick up. I am not usually a fruit beer drinking person, but this brew is not to bad. I can see this being a cheap, easy, refreshing summer brew and I will get this one again  before I tried this brew I thought I would never say that!"
"D  Overall, I wasnt very impressed with this offering. Between the loud bottle design and promise of a fruitier drink, this one fails to deliver much of a memorable taste. As a pale Wheat, its middle of the road, as a fruit beer, its lackluster. Maybe I just got a bad bottle."
"Overall it was a refreshing summer beer."
"This one is nice however. Tastes light and crisp, the pomegranate is there, but not overpowering. The brew is also not overly sweet -- another common flaw of fruited beer."
"Nice beer. Not one that I would drink lots of, but very drinkable."
"I think it's a tremendous appearance, the smell is perhaps a bit too subtle. Loved the taste but I prefer a more subdued fruit beer as a rule, so someone who likes to get hammered by a sweet taste may be disappointed. Nothing spectacular in terms of mouthfeel, but I'll buy it again."
"Ephemere it is not, but a light, very drinkable wheat'n'fruit it is. I'm pleasantly surprised that one of Saranac's wilder creations came out well. I'm definitely going to stash some for hot summer days."
"I will be getting this again, can't say as I've ever had anything like it before."
"Drinkability: Saranac did a really nice job with this beer. The pomegranate flavor was there but it still tasted like beer, unlike some beers that taste like a 50/50 mixture of fruit juice and beer. This is a nice summer time beer. Well worth a try."
"Pours a cloudy golden. Thin head, not much retention, decent lacing. Smell is of honey,and orange spice.Smell is nice, but weak. Body is light to medium, and carbionated. Taste is of spiced fruit, again nice,but a bit weak. This beer is not among the greats, but well worth a try this summer!"
"One of the better fruit beers because the fruit isn't overpowering. It's just nice. This beer centers around the pomegranate. Some fruit beers, you know its just fruit extract. You know, overly sweet and not very drinkable. This one, however, is a nice middle ground. If you like a little fruit in our beer, give it a try."
