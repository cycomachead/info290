4.64,22.8,4,4.25,5,4.75,4.5,"Hop Sun (Summer Wheat Beer) brewed by Southern Tier Brewing Company, with an ABV of 5.10%  This brew pours out a nice amber color with a nice white head. The smell is rich with flavors. You pick up grains and hops.  Now for the taste, it smooth but bold with flavor. You pick up on grains and malts in the taste of this brew.  Then there is mild bitterness of hops at the end of this brew. Southern Tier Brewing Company did a nice job with this one. There is nothing overpowering about this brew. Hop Sun has a nice balance to it.  The mouthfeel is nice clean and refreshing. This brew is a nice summer wheat beer.  I like how Hop Sun (Summer Wheat Beer) is different from most wheat brews on the market. One thing that stands out with Hop Sun is, this brew is filtered.  Overall I'm giving Hop Sun (Summer Wheat Beer) a 4.5 out of 5. I would buy this brew again.","nicholas2121","Mar 26, 2015"

It started to show a little bit of crisp bite, but not much. Get a real nice mash aroma especially for just being in a pint glass. I find it really similar to a thinner/ lighter Boston Lager. Not sure how they got so much malt flavor in such a light colored/ bodied beer. If you love the smell of the rolling boil, give this one a try. At 5.1% and $10/6, this is a very drinkable and enjoyable summer brew.","WesMantooth","May 25, 2014"

The aroma is very mild, almost non-existent, with some very light hints of undefined hops. The taste is equally mild, it just has a little more flavor than the aroma indicated. There isn't really anything distinctive, especially from a wheat beer. It's a little thinner in weight and feel. I like the effort to make a flavorful summer beer that's lower ABV, but this one doesn't have the flavor to pull it off.","delta490","Apr 26, 2014"

Mild citrus, floral a little spice and a lightly breaddy malt. Pale malt has hints of sweetness, wheat is tall. Light pine, lemongrass and a touch of earth. Looks like sunshine in the glass and smells like it too. The lemon really comes forward sweetly as the beer warms. Taste is light, crisp and clean. Fruity lemon, grass, refreshing wheat, a little tangy. Has a fine bitter that doesn’t overwhelm but plays with the sour aspect of the wheat and finishes with a little cracker and not so much honey.

3.88,2.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 3/20/2013. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of lemon, orange zest, floral, pine, grass, wheat, bread, light honey, and floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt and hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, orange zest, grapefruit, floral, grass, light honey, wheat, bread, light pine, and floral earthiness. Slight floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, floral, grass, light honey, wheat, bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance of hop and malt flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice pale wheat ale. Nice balance of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 09, 2013"

The beer smells of lemon and pine, but not in an overpowering manner. I get some of the pale malt and the wheat in the smell as well, which brings a nice light breadiness. The flavor is pretty hop forward for the typical American wheat beer, but like in the aroma, the citrus and pine don't overpower. There's some nice back end piney bitterness. I also get some of the lightly bready malt, which provides some nice backbone. The body is light to medium with high carbonation. The beer is highly drinkable and goes down smoothly. This is an excellent beer.","acevenom","May 17, 2013"

3.83,1.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Growler from GBX poured into a pint glass. Nice clear golden pour with a generous 2 finger head. Smell was hop forward with the piney, floural hit that settles into some of the bready malts and cloves. A bit strong on the hop smell was distracting. Taste was also hop forward with te pine hitting initially followed by floral and malts. A good hit of bitterness at the end. Some of the cloves and fruit are felt in the middle. Pretty well balanced after the hop hit. I prefer more bread, malts on my wheats, but this was interesting. ST usually goes over the top with their styles and this is definately different. Feel was okay with some hop dryness and quite a bit of carb. Overall- AN intersting take on the style. A bit too hop forward for me, but worth the try. Pretty complex for a summer brew. Wouldn't turn one down-","TheDinger","Jul 29, 2012"

Light aroma of wheat, sweet malt and a hint of lemon. Flavor follows aroma with wheat, malt, light bittering hops and a hint of citrus. Finishes with a light but distinct wheat flavor, with the residual sweetness, faintly of graham cracker. A nice subtly flavored light wheat ale. The flavor components were nice and well balanced, but I wish they were a little more assertive. Light bodied, which is appropriate for the style. Still a good summer sipping beer, which is what it offers.","LiquidAmber","Jul 14, 2012"

It drinks as if the brewers decided to make a perfectly balanced wheat beer, then at the last minute tossed in some extra hops. If I had to criticize it, I would say I wish it was a bit more carbonated and had just a bit more sparkle. Next, I might try a blend of hops instead of just one. Other than that, I wouldn't change much. It is always nice when brewers make dull styles interesting. ST did it here. Very, very well done.","deadonhisfeet","Jun 24, 2012"

The nose is sweet and slightly floral, but the hops are all in the taste and mouthfeel. Initial sweetness from the malt casts a light, lingering bitterness that remains floral and balanced. The mouth is slightly watery and it's definitely a drinkable summer ale. Once the beer warms it becomes even more lager-like with a bigger, fruitier backbone from the malt/wheat and almost no spice... Don't drink this beer if you're looking for hops.","ThePorterSorter","Jun 15, 2012"

Tangy, crisp mouthfeel at the end of the brew, with a roasty and hoppy aftertaste. Very interesting dynamic. The finish is astringent and slightly sharp, with a slight linger.

3.58,-5.3,3.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 5/4/11. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear light gold color with about a half inch white head that went away pretty quickly. There's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is a bit light overall, the brew smells like wheat, lemon peel and sweet malt. The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but there's the addition of some grassy hops. Luckily the taste is much stronger than the aroma is. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's crisp and easy to drink with moderate carbonation. I think it's a decent brew, but next time I'll have to try a fresher bottle. Worth a try.","bluejacket74","Aug 20, 2011"

Not much complexity to the flavor, mouthfeel is blah, and it's just not all that refreshing (which I want from a summer wheat).","zeledonia","Aug 16, 2011"
4.08,7.9,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"this is the 3rd beer that I have had from southern tier. All 3 have been very good. The Hop Sun summer seasonal is a great combo of hoppiness and smooth drinkability. The color is a beautiful golden. The smell is sweet citrus and hops. The flavor delivers. The sweet lemon and orange blends well with the piney hoppiness. The only regret I have is that I discovered this beer so late in the summer, it's time for the fall beers to start rollin out, and I can't wait.","mattkoon","Aug 16, 2011"
3.79,0.3,3,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Sampled on August 15, 2011. The pour is pale yellow with short lived fizzy white head that diminishes to nothing in no time. It is the lemon gras that takes oiver the aroma on first whiff so it is very summer-like in that regard. The wheat and hops are more subdued. The light body doesn't make you have to try to hard on a hot summer day. The taste is also zinging with lemon with muted malt flavor and a pungent but clean hop finish. A nice way to enjoy the dog days of August.","puboflyons","Aug 15, 2011"

Along with the lemony bite of wheat, a combo of earthy/spicy/citric hop notes make for quite a flavorful brew.

This got me a finger of rocky, bone-white head with great retention. Color was sunshine yellow with NE-quality clarity. It looked like summer in a glass. I would actually consider putting one aside for a dull, dreary day in mid-February when a pick-me-up might be nice. Nose was at once grassy and lemony, very evocative of summer. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a very grassy taste on the tongue. The bottle mentioned ""... 1 variety of hops and 3 types of malts"" and I would be curious to know what they were. This was very tasty, very refreshing and very welcome on a slow summer day. Finish was semi-dry and quite grassy.","woodychandler","Jul 18, 2011"

Solid amount of hops as well. Very light for a wheat beer but I'm guessing that's the point of this one. Overall, this is one of the best and most flavorful summer beers I've had.

All the sweetness attributed to the wheat malt and yeast are bastardized by American hop additions (bittering variety). Tastes like a bitter pale wheat ale overall.

There is a lot of grass and lemon peel along with only a faint hint of wheat. An earthy lemon grass aftertaste and bitterness. Not too dry but the bitterness clings ridiculously. The abundance of earthy hops do not compliment the wheat body. I don't think the malt bill holds up to the hops.","DrinkingDrake","Apr 04, 2011"

3.9,3.2,4,4,4,4,3.5,"This beer is confusing because its labeled as a summer wheat beer, but it smells like a pilsner, it looks like a pilsner...walks like a duck, talks like a duck. It pours a brillantly clear straw color with a disipating white fizzy head, very effervesent. The initial aroma is grassy hops but the longer it sits the more malt comes through. The mouthfeel is medium light, medium-high carbonation and high astringency. The flavor is of grassy hops with a medium bitterness. There is a solid malt backbone that quickly takes over with less wheat character than I expected. It finishes nice and dry and is more tolerant to warming up than your average big brewery pilsner. I know that American Wheats can be more aggressively hopped than the European versions, I'm just not getting enough wheat to consider it a wheat. Very refreshing though with high drinkability...your perfect grilling, horseshoes, after mowing the lawn, cleaning out the garage type of beer.","alexkeil","Mar 20, 2011"

Sumpin sumpin and gumballhead have a little too much hops IMO (not saying they aren't great) so I like the balance that southern tier displays. Mouthfeel is medium wolith average carbonation.

3.53,-6.6,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"The pale golden body was clear, and had a one finger thick foamy head fed by lively carbonation. The looks were more similar to an APA, and so was the muted hop aroma. This lacked any of the clove, banana, bubblegum wheat beer smells. The taste was a bit more wheaty, as the spicy hop bitterness was backed by a sweetness tinged with juicy fruit gum. The beer was very easy to drink, as should be the case for a summer seasonal, and there was a lingering sweet aftertaste. Picked up out of season as a one off at Green's, but will have to look for this during the dog days.","rajendra82","Jan 11, 2011"

This beer pours a light golden color with a puffy white head that leaves a nice lacing on the surface and down the glass. There is a decent aromatic hop quality when the head is present, but fades to a slight only citrus hint when the head fades away. The taste is surprisingly not too bitter. There is a good balance of malty sweetness and the citric acid from the hops. A light lemony zest feel to the flavor, it's rather nice for a hot summer day. The mouthfeel is a bit thicker than I would like to see it for something that is to be consumed in the summer sun. But for all times of the year it's not bad at all. This is a fairly nice drinking beer, but I feel it's not nearly as light as I would like it to be, though not really bad due to the crispness that it seems to bring to the table anyway. A pleasant beer and a good find.","Vdubb86","Oct 23, 2010"

The aroma has light citrus like orange and lemon, assertively hoppy but with a hint of wheat (just a hint). The taste is everything I hoped for from the smell, maybe with a little extra added in a positive way. This is tart & sweet, a little bitter and tangy, everything I could want out of a summer wheat. Well carbonated and ultra-drinkable, these bottles emptied fast. Maybe the best of the category really, or at least solid competition for Gumballhead.","TurdFurgison","Sep 06, 2009"

Nose is strong on hops, a surprise for a wheat but not for something called Hop Sun or anything from Southern Tier. Light wheat, as well as bubble gum in there as well. A nice sweet nose. Taste is great: hops show up first, nice and fruity. A good amount of wheat, orange and some lemon as well. Body is medium with good carbonation (better than a lot of over-carbonated wheats). I really like this one - it's a great mix between the sweetness of a wheat and the bitterness of an IPA. Definitely one I'll be picking up again.","soupyman10","Aug 21, 2007"

It has a rather unique taste. The floral hops are not as present as in the smell, the wheat malt seems to cut the hop flavor. It has a touch of honey and lemon and finishes with some hop bitterness.

Wheat malt and a tame earthy hop bitterness. The carbonation and mouthfeel hold things together to produce a pretty decent summer lawnmower beer.

Aroma has a strong wheat aroma backed by a hint of herbal hops. More of a fresh malt aroma than most beers. Actually quite appealing. The flavor is solid, with moderate bitterness up front slowly giving way to toasted malt flavor. It finishes crisp, with a nice wheat snap and then some grassy and herbal hop notes find their way back to the palate. Mouthfeel is well balanced between effervescence and malt structure. It's light enough to be refreshing, but it still says it's a well crafted beer. Drinkability is exceptional. I really enjoy this beer. I bought a few sixers buy/get one, but I wish I'd bought more at that price. Still, it's well worth the $7 a sixer or so I've been seeing it sell for.","aaronh","Jul 25, 2007"

Left lacings down the side that clung fairly well. Smelled slightly sweet, but had very noticable lemony aroma. Flavor was reasonable. The lemony flavor tasted fake, kinda like some lemon flavored iced teas I have had. Not bad, just not what I think of for lemon flavor.

A very pleasant, unexpectedly fruity hop aroma. A nice grapefruit nose. A soft mouthfeel played off of a light hop bite, with a creamy finish typical of the american wheat style. Enough hops to add a little extra interest to what can be a sometimes bland style, but not so much to lose the resreshing drinkability you're looking for in a summer wheat beer. I think they're doing good things out there in Central NY.","awall422","Jun 16, 2007"

The mouthfeel is light and crisp - since the hops are not overpowering and very light in regards to the bitterness. I can feel citrus, lemon, and floral/soapy notes here, but this works well together and is appropriate for this time of the year. Most hoppy beers tend to have a bit of a warming effect on me, but this isn't like those. The aftertaste just has the slight lingering of the mouthfeel, and I still am amazed at what this is classified under.

The smell is fairly weak though. Taste follows suit. Basically no malt to be found and the body is quite light. Good levels of carbonation keep the beer somewhat lively and offset the lack of malt a bit. Hop flavors are there but only intense because of the lack of other flavors.

Some sweetish English muffin bready malt flavors arrive later on. Smooth and airy mouthfeel, light side of medium body.

Aromas of sweet cereal, floral notes, and hops. Unique and inviting. Taste was refreshing and satisfying; flavors of hops and smooth malts were abundant, with hints of caramel and earth. Very nice. Mouthfeel was refreshing and medium bodied. A good level of drinkability, this would be an ideal beer for after a long summer afternoon of gardening and cutting the grass. Recommended. Special thanks to rousee for the sample.","Frozensoul327","Oct 03, 2005"

4.04,6.9,3,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a golden color with virtually no head. The smell is of citrus, pine and hops. The taste clean clear with a citrus feel that finishes with the slight hoppy bite. The mouthfeel is clean, smooth, lightly carbonated. It was good, really good and because of the lower ABV it makes it a highly drinkable beer. Could knock back a few of these on any hot summer day.","LucaBrasi","Sep 11, 2005"
4.81,27.2,3.5,5,5,4,5,"The mouthfeel on this is very nice and velvetty. At 4.3% --how can you go wrong with a few of these. I do think this beer very much holds its own against a 3 F gumballhead. But NY is a lot easier for me than Indiana.","rousee","Sep 06, 2005"
4.62,22.2,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Almost a dirty and slightly cloudy golden in color; thin white head. Fresh citrus fruit and sweet hops on the nose. Crisp and oily hops noted up front; just a touch of wheat bread and underlying malts. Fresh bubble gum flavorings; unbelievably sweet, decent carbonation. Bordering on medium bodied. As it warms, and its tough, cause this is so smooth and slick, some bread dough offerings and lemon peel notes. One incredible quencher, and certainly something I can drink at any time. Superior!","GeoffRizzo","Sep 02, 2005"

The taste is so nice. Similar to other souther tier beers but milder. This is milder than their ""mild"" IPA but still great hoppage with a good maltiness to balance it out. Therefore we have a ncie refreshing beer this time around. THe mouthfeel is moderate, but crisp and a little bitey. Surprisingly low abv with this beer but thats allright.

A great session beer with an ABV of 4.4% - give or take a tenth. A guy with a beer ball of this stuff on his back serves it cold in the stands at my local AA ballpark.

The aroma is hoppy and floral, with a comparable hop intensity to many APA's. The flavor is very crisp from the wheat with the citrusy kick of the hops. This is highly drinkable and thirst quenching, a sort of blend of SNPA and SN Wheat but really its own creation.","yeagerbm","May 12, 2005"

4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"A combination of citrusy hops and wheat-based malt greets you in the nose of this delightful summer ale. It's deep gold body is slightly hazy beneath an average-sized head of bright white froth that, unfortunately, slips easily away. It does maintain a thin surface covering, however, and leaves sheets of tiny spots and splashes of lace that cling throughout the glass. It's crisp and slick across the palate with a light-medium body and very fine-bubbled carbonation. The flavor delivers the hops that the nose promises, along with a solid backbone of bitterness that leads it to a dry and citrusy finish. Clean, crisp and refreshing... worth trying!","NeroFiddled","May 09, 2005"
4.27,13,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Yellow-orange pour with a one-finger white head that remains for most of the time it took to drink it. Wow, I wasn't expecting this much of a hop aroma. Very strong bitter piney hops with some strong orange scents in there as well. Extremely juicy hop flavor with a lot of pine and bitterness thrown in there as well. The hops really dominate the flavor, and it's kind of hard to tell this one is a wheat beer and not an IPA until the wheat kind of slides in on the finish and lingers in the aftertaste. I really, really like this one's strong hoppiness on the wheat backbone. Probably the best summer brew I've had this early in the young season. Well done.","whartontallboy","Apr 29, 2005"

The taste is lightly malty, with a big wheat-beer taste, full of lemon and grain. Its a light bodied beer, with a huge, satisfying taste. By the mid-taste, the hops start to kick in, ending with an aggressive hop finish. Its bitter and delicious.","Suds","Dec 20, 2004"

Taste, however, was excellent. Amazingly refreshing, a very light beer. Citrus-like elements are dominant here, but very little confusion with the sweet malt and the light hop profiles. Pilsner-like, in the sense that this would go with nearly any meal. A great beer to try, a great conversion beer, and an excellent beer for any outdoor activities.","RocketWidget","Oct 21, 2004"

Smell consisted of juiced hops along with some citrus aromas and some slight pine notes as well. Not bad so far. Taste was good. Some good malt undertones in this beer with the wheat and hops riding on top. Some nice citrus and pine aftertaste takes place but doesn't last all that long which was good to see, because if they did stick around, it could of become a little overwhelming. But this is a good pale wheat ale. Perhaps a litlte tough to find, but if you do see it, grab a case.","necoadam","Aug 02, 2004"
4.07,7.7,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a deceivingly clear golden pils color with an off white head that leaves some good lacing. Smells gingery and hoppy; sans one's typical wheat ale characteristics. Very hoppy for a wheat ale, bordering IPA territory. The wheat shows up in the background of the malt profile. Very enjoyable and atypical for a wheat ale. Finished fruity sweet (blueberry?) and crisp. Kudos to the brewers at Southern Tier for reinventing the wheel in a summer quaffer. Usually when one thinks of a wheat beer, Hersbrucker or some other low alpha hop plays a minor role in the finished product. This beer is not that beer. A wheat ale for hopheads.","crookedhalo","Jul 23, 2004"

The mouthfeel is smooth and thin, very thin. The taste is a disappointment: indistinct, a little piney with a grainy hint, but the hops are pretty understated.

The aromas from this brew where all about the hop, pine and grassy notes where dominate with citrus highlights. I was very surprised by the aroma, was not expecting such a hop hit. Nice smelling brew! The taste is also dominated by the hoppyness of this brew, but your able to notice the malt and sweet flavors from the wheat. This is a fantastic brew for the hot months; enjoy this after working up a sweat working on the lawn, etc. The beer is a bit different but give it a try.","Stimack","May 31, 2004"

It wouldn't be my first choice for hot summer refreshment due to the pine-resin hops, nor does the oddly sour wheat leave me licking my lips. By no means is it bad, it's just...a little too experimental. Southern Tier has been an excellent local upstart, but I hope they try something different next summer, maybe along the lines of allagash white.","shirfan","May 30, 2004"
