The hops are decent though which might be the saving grace of this beer. It's light and drinkable for a summer beer though, so definitely sessionable, but probably wouldn't get it again.

4.19,17,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Peak Organic Summer Session Ale is a very clear, golden ale with a thick, fluffy, white head that has great retention and lacing. It has a very earthy smell with a fresh hop aroma that's bright and citrusy. It smells great. It's medium light bodied, smooth and soft. The finish is quick and dry, leaving the mouth a little slick. It has a nice, tight, dry, bitter flavor with lots of lemon peel and a hint of grass and herbs. The bitterness lingers for a while after the taste. This beer is a very pleasant surprise. It has a lot more flavor than I was expecting and it's very refreshing. I'm a fan.","yesyouam","Sep 07, 2012"

Aromas of toasted grains and a surprising hops presence. Bitter and slightly resiny on the nose, which is a nice change of pace. Flavors are definitely hop-centric, with a green, peppery, bitter influence overshadowing a subtle toasted grain backbone. A little unbalanced on the palate. The aftertaste is light, crisp, and clean, with some citrus influence on the green hops characteristics. Crisp, light, and slightly drying finish. Very tasty.","GarthDanielson","Aug 22, 2012"

The mouthfeel is light and heavily carbonated, and the drinkability is very good. This is just a really good American Wheat. It's very flavorful for it's small profile.

Not as complex or hoppy as I'd have liked, yet it's something you could bring to a party and not offend anyone. I'd prefer more complexity, but in the end it's still quaffable and easily approachable.","Rhettroactive","Apr 07, 2012"

3.62,1.1,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Sampled from a bottle at the April 7, 2012 Keene, NH Beerfest. The pour is pale yellow with a fizzy, short-lived head. The aroma has a moderate malt character but there is also a citrus, or more likely a pineapple character. The wheat is playing second fiddle. The body is light, which is typical for the style. The taste also brings out the same sort of light malt, citrus flavor with an extra tart finish winding things down. I could see having a few of these on a hot, summer day.","puboflyons","Mar 24, 2012"

3.42,-4.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured a 2"" white head. Clear bright straw yellow color body. Smells mildy of citrus. Taste has some citrus peel plus malt and a mild bitter hops finish. Certainly a step up from other summer ales, and quite refreshing, but not overly complex. Definitely above average though, and so far I've liked every single thing I tried from Peak Organic.","MoreThanWine","Aug 22, 2011"
3.43,-4.2,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Picked up a single at EuroMarket. For such a light beer, the Ringwood (creamy, earthy fruit) character is too heavy. There is, however, a pleasant fruity citrus burst that remind me of Citra hops and Narragansett Summer Ale. The hops are complemented by a mild, sweet wheat bread. The body is appropriately light and drinkable for session/summer beer. Worth a try if you enjoy Ringwood beers.","tempest","Aug 14, 2011"

3.67,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Bottle poured into a pint glass: Pours a nice clear golden yellow with plenty of head and generous lacing. Strong malt and sweet wheat aroma leads to a concentrated grain taste, some burnt malts, balanced by light bitterness. Very easy drinking, perfect carbonation, gets you in the mood for a baseball game. Session is the perfect description for this summer brew.","bld81","Jun 28, 2011"
3.18,-11.2,3.5,3,3.5,2.5,3,"Crisp and light bodied with a decent balance of bready yeast, earthy hops, peppery spice and citrus rind.

4.22,17.9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"D - I'm quite impressed with this one and even a little bit surprised at how nice it is. This beer is much better than average, both as a summer beer and an American wheat ale. The aroma is surprisingly complex as spices and a very nice lemon zest character hit your in the nose along with a hint of pine hops. The flavor profile operates along the same lines with the addition of vanilla and some more potent malt. Really well done and very drinkable, I continue to be impressed with Peak as they are making beers that stand up for themselves regardless of their organic status.","nickfl","Jun 20, 2011"
3.25,-9.2,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Pouring a clear light orange-yellow with a dense, white head that falls off leaving no lacing, this beer looks decent. The nose is decent as well. Moderate hop character, fruity and citrusy with a rather clean, cracker-like malt backbone. Grainy with a moderate dry wheat aroma, there's not too much going on here. The palate opens with some hop flavor, moderately citrus-like. Rather mild in flavor, there's no real bitterness here, and even the hops taste a little muted. Moderate grain flavor is present with a definite wheat presence. Drying on the finish with no real lingering flavors, this feels just a touch watery. Crisply carbonated, this is a refreshing beverage, though not particularly tasty.","DefenCorps","Jun 16, 2011"
3.55,-0.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Summer Session Ale is a solid beer that doesn't quite stand out from the crowd. More hops would have been nice, making this a hopped-up wheat beer. Less hops and a focus on the malted wheat might have been better too.","Hojaminbag","May 30, 2011"
3.8,6.1,4,4,3.5,4,4,"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light and refreshing pale and wheat malt scent along with a touch of citrus and a subtle yeast fruitiness. The taste is decent. It has a dry pale and wheat malt flavor. It has a mild bitterness and well as a faint citrus character in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a tasty brew with incredible drinkability; a fine summer seasonal.","WesWes","May 29, 2011"

3.55,-0.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured into a standard pint glass a dull lemony color with a thin wispy bone white head atop,muted citric hops in the nose along with some toasted grain,pleasant but again muted.Muted hops again in the flavor,present but a little light,somewhat grainy and toasted as well.I like the hoppy wheat ales like Gumballhead,and Hop Sun,and I thought this would be more in their category but it doesnt bring as much hop punch.I wish that style would reamerge.","oberon","May 08, 2011"
3.88,8.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a medium golden with a thin white head. Just a little bit of retention,with a decent lace. Aroma is of piny hops and citrus. Body is light and carbonated.

3.63,1.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a slightly dark ambe with a decent stream of bubbles rising from the bottom. Very thin white head that didn't last long, but clung to the sides and slowly slid down. Aroma was slightly sweet, reminded me of vanilla and bubblegum with a small amount of grain in the end. Taste started out slightly hoppy, a small touch of sweet, then ended with a tarty tang. Felt ok in the mouth, fairly mouthy with a small kick, seemed almost over carbonated. Easy to drink, could definitely do several on a hot day.","mountdew1","Jul 27, 2010"

3.68,2.8,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"The taste is light, refreshing, a true summer ale. The lemony tartness is most noticeable, with some sweetish malts and wheatiness coming through. Things dry up a bit in the finish. There is not much aftertaste for better or worse. The texture is a touch course, but only a touch, due to the wheat, but not mouth prickly. It isn't a smooth beer, but neither is it particularly rough. The herbal lemony flavors are pretty much what defines this beer. There is a slightly drying, leafy hop, pepperiness in the finish and that keeps things a bit interesting too. I'd come back for another. If it means anything, I had this after a very boozy DIPA and this really cleansed the palate. Points added right there.","albern","Beers"
