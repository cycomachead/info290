"It taste exactly like a more subtle version of White Christmas, I believe it is called, but without leaving your palate extremely dry afterwards. Excellent!"
"4/3/15 (Draft - Finley Dunnes Chicago IL) Light brown, murky appearance, minimal carbonation and head. Minimal aroma and taste, malt and fruit present and balanced. Smooth taste. Standard beer."

""

"okay. taste is kinda sour for me idk."
""
""
""
"It is sweet and smooth drink."

"Has to be one of my fav American beers. In-between Hefeweizen, Belgian, and Summer Ale and done perfectly. A Lite BBQ beer That has the heaviness to make it worth it."
"A very solid, crisp summertime brew. Notes of citrus are prominent. Very refreshing."
""
""
"O:  Decent beer."
"All time Best summer beer"
""
"Loved this when I first turned 21, maybe it was because it was summertime and always around me. Hasn't really been the same since though"
""
"I kind of like the peppery notes from that spice they used. It's a unique and fruity flavor but its not for me.... Nick Websters review totally ruined it for me by comparing it to the smell of band aids... I can see where he's coming from. I'd drink this any day over a Bud Light but Sam Adams needs to up their game."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, best before 11/2014. Pours hazy bright golden color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, orange, apricot, pear, apple, coriander, pepper, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, spice, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, orange, apricot, pear, apple, coriander, pepper, wheat, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Minimal herbal spice bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange, apricot, pear, apple, coriander, pepper, wheat, cracker, bread, light honey, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and robustness of pale malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/yeast/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 5.3%. Overall this is a nice spiced pale wheat ale style. All around good balance and robustness of pale malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
"One of my favorite summer time beers. Picked one up 2 days ago in Massachusetts....I guess Sammy forgot to buy that one back bc it was definitely expired, but good enough to hold me over until this year's release"

"The beer that got me into pale wheat ales. Great representation of the style: wonderful golden color and the smell and taste you'd expect from a pale wheat."

"Not the best from Sam, but decent flavor and look."
"On tap at the keystone Pub in Bethlehem, Pa. Way too much lemon. Not a fan."
""
"Aweful. Maybe it deserves a better rating.... This is not my style of beer, but sometimes even styles one doesn't care for end up being somewhat enjoyable. Not this."
""
""
""
"Used to love this beer, but recently it hasn't been doing it for me.  As strange as this may sound, the taste reminds me of how band aids smell..."

"I've love the peppery notes in this beer. The citrus is nice too. It's my go-to fishing beer during the summer."

"I really enjoyed this one. Ever since i was 18, i was like, when i drink, i want to try SA summer ale. I did on my 21st birthday. Not gonna go into lacing or anything of the sort as i don't really know how to review in that way. I drank this ale straight from the bottle. Has some hoppy and citrusy flavor. medium/ light body. Great for what its meant to be. A beer for the summer. All i know is when i worked unloading trucks, on the weekend, and going to the lake, having these was so refreshing and its just a great easy drinking ale. I rate it a  5 out of 5. Considering this was my first  beer, it will always be special to me."

"Rating based on recollection of this as mainstay summer brew for several years, before I discovered BA (and thus better choices). Had it again this summer, and all I tasted was the lemon zest."

"Taste is light and citrus-oriented, with plenty of wheat and spice malt notes. A decent and drinkable Summer ale — not all that unique nor complex, but tasty enough to enjoy."
"OVERALL: this is a good beer.  A good middle of the road summertime ale.  If you like seasonals during the season and still like beer to taste like beer... This is a good summer ale for you."
""
""
""
""
"Rich gold color. Good taste to it with a nice finish. A little bolder than I expected for a summer ale, but no complaints."

"good stuff"

"I love summer ale,usually buy a case each and every spring,doesn't transfer well to a late summer beer for me,at that point I'm reaching for a true hefe, but the lemon zest is completely natura and refreshing"

"Sam Adams misses the mark with this one...very average tasting ale, not a refreshing beer."
""
"Single bottle poured into a weizen glass. A honey yellow amber with a small amount of fizzy white effervescence that does retain its form fairly well. Smells like sweet boiled grains, lemon zest, maybe a little candied ginger, dried apple pomace and musty, hay-like noble hops. Actually a rather nice vessel for that dry wheat spice that many of us have been trained to appreciate in the summer months, quenching and a little tart. Someone at this brewery has an infatuation with grains of paradise and these do work here, adding a dusty, almost leathery spice note to the zesty lemon and orange (vitamin C tablet?) citrus rind. More dried grass and white pepper notes in the crisp finish. There is a yeasty sweetness in the background that I am not wild about.  Although I prefer this to certain local wheat beer offerings, the classic Sam Adams noble hop flavor does not come off as well here as is typically the case and the background sweetness clashes with the tart spice elements. The grains are a tad coarse and the finish leaves a vaguely metallic aftereffect in its wake."
"OVERALL:  this is a good beer but there are better wheat beers to be had so I will probably not seek this one out again."

"Overall a really good brew in my opinion. I bought a six pack at publix and the first one was great but the last one was even better. This beer really grew on me with each one that I drank. I really like wheat beer and I also like sweet beer and this beer is both. Really great unfiltered wheat taste and character with the sweetness and taste from the orange."

"Samuel Adams Summer Ale brewed by Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams), with an ABV of 5.3% This brew pours out a cloudy amber color with a thick white head. This is an unfiltered brew you can not see thought it . The smell is fruity with a hit of grains. Summer Ale has a different smell to it. It's not bad it is just different . The taste is light and crisp you pick on some fruits in the taste. The mouthfeel is light and clean. There is nothing overpowering in this brew, it has a nice balance to it. Samuel Adams did a nice job with this one. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5. I would get this brew again."

"I do enjoy sam adams as whole, and this beer is no exception, while the citrus can border on to much, I don't think it crosses the line into to overpowering. Overall a good staple beer, which is what i have come to expect from the sam adams line. I have had both cans and bottles, and i prefer the bottles, but that is almost always true of any beer."

"O: Good light beer for a hot day"
""

""
"It's your typical Sam Adams. Nothing special but its worth trying."
""
"O: I can see why it's popular. I'm sure I'll drink it again on a hot day because it has a really good taste, better than most other wheats, but not something I'd order over a good, malty, rich lager, strong IPA or bitter."
"O - Very good summer session beer. Finishes clean."

"Samuel Adams is one of my favorite everyday beers and I was happy to give this a try with a burrito at a Tijuana Flats. It was okay, worked fine on a summer day with a casual meal. citrusy flavor, obviously, I would drink it again, but won't await it's release like I do for the Octoberfest."

"Pours a hazy, gold color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of lemon, sweet malt, pale malt, hint of hop, grass, slight yeast, earthy malt, and a hint of pepper. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, hint of sweet malt, strong wheat, hint of hop, and slight lemon. Overall, average appearance, good aroma, and average body."

"O - Samuel Adams Summer Ale steps slightly away from the usual coriander and orange peel-type of combination usually found in these beers, opting instead for peppery grains of paradise and lemon peel that gives the beer an almost lemonade feel to it. The flavor is quite refreshing but this beer could use a little more dryness and carbonation on the finish to up the summer time drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at McNellie's OKC. Pours a hazy gold with a billowy white head that only stays for a bit. Not much of an aroma beyond a hint of hay and bread. Tastes of lemon with a touch of malt. Light mouth that's cool and crisp. It's not bad, but fairly unremarkable. There are much better wheat beers to be had."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It does exactly what it is supposed to: refresh and relax you on a hot summer day. It's definitely not hoppy for a APWA (not even close to Lagunitas Sumpin' Sumpin'). Still, enough flavor to keep it interesting."
""
""
""
"Out of the bottle the beer pours a nice orange tinged hue, haw ever it does have a weak head with little staying power or lacing. The scent was appealing though, definite smell of oranges and coriander. The mouthfeel is what u remember the most - crisp, refreshing and very smooth. It just felt like a sessionable beer. It's taste was nothing out of the ordinary. But the simple flavor mixed well with the hops. Overall, it was another great offering from SA."

"This beer I had already tried, but tried again for the review. The appearance is very light yellow with a white head with a very light smell as well, although I was able to pick up hints of citrus. The taste was pretty good with a lot of citrus coming through. The beer itself was a little thin for my taste but I thought it was a decent beer. Not bad, but not great either."
""
""
""
""
"(O) This beer is OK and I prefer to drink it paired with some seafood(clams). The overall lemon theme is a bit too much for me on its own. Should there be a lemon law for lemon flavored beers?"
""
""

"O- this is another one of those beers that serves a purpose, it's an easy drinking beer for hot summer days. It's not something that I would sip and linger on the flavors, but it makes a great beach beer"

"Pours a hazy golden-orange in color with a very thin white head. Some spotty lacing was seen. The aroma is of some citrus and hops. The taste isn't as good as on tap but is of malts, lemon and some spice. Perfect carbonation and goes down easy. On draught, it is at least a half a point higher if not a full point. :)"

Get more of the citrus in the taste. Its kind of crisp. A lot of carbonation. Really fizzy. Goes down pretty easy. Probably would be a good hot day beer."

"Very refreshing citrusy ale. The pour yields a nice frothy head. Slightly hazy, but still a nice golden color. Aroma bursting with citrus, smells as refreshing as it is. More malt than hop, but very smooth and sweet. Finishes with a bit of that hop bitterness you'd expect. Overall very nice beer for, as it describes, Summer. Refreshing without sacrificing taste."

"Overall: I really did not like this beer at all, and it looks like I've run into my first true failure in this series. Still, I do have that feeling that the bottle may be too old. It is a possibility. Over time the lemon peel and spice can serriouly degrade the beer, but still, It seemed like a bad idea from the start. An American wheat ale should not be spiced and flavored like a wit...if this was instead a hoppy flavored (not bittered) wheat ale I feel like it could had worked. The beer itself looks great, its just a fact that it went very downhill very quickly. 2\5, and FYI I poured this one down the drain."

"This is a good beer for anybody who like a good fruity flavor in my oppinion. I tried one night with a buddy just to try something new. Has a strong taste of lemon and other fruity flavors. However don't be fulled. After about one or two of these the flavor gets old fast! Not something I could drink every day even during the summer."

"Slightly hazed yellow orange color with a white thin head that settles quickly and leaves a foamy ring around the top of the beer. Aroma of corn and butter. Subtle flavor of biscuity malt, Ron and butter notes, faint offsetting bitterness. Full mouthfeel. Overall an okay beer. Not overly flavorful, but not offensive, and I'm not much of a fan of pale wheats."

"All in all, nothing gross about this one, just nothing exciting, either. I wouldn't go out of my way to pick it up again, but I wouldn't be offended or go all ""Beer Advocate"" on someone if they offered me one. I can see this being a good way to convert non-craft beer people into the craft world... but given the seasonal release and style, I would recommend Oberon much more than this."

"not very impressed with this offering. beer was flat tasting and rather boring. it had a taste not unlike lemon furniture cleaner that would simply not leave my tastebuds even after the swallow was over. i totally chilled the next one i drank for 20 min in the freezer and the enjoyment level went up considerably...the off lemon taste was basically nonexistent and it tasted like a bland wheat beer. very mundane brew."

"Calories per bottle 159. ABV 5.3%. The Lemon taste compliments the Summer Theme. I am not a fan of this summer seasonal combination.

"Overall: Samuel Adams Summer Ale is a decent beer, not great, but not bad. I enjoyed the flavors of the beer, but nothing knocked my socks off, or made me remember it after it was finished. It does its job of being refreshing on a hot summer day. According to the label, this ale is a wheat beer, but it doesn’t have any of the typical bubblegum, clove and banana flavors that most, if not all wheat beers have, which I guess would make this a poor example of a wheat beer, but because I don’t typically like wheat beers, specifically, because I don’t like those flavors, I found this beer to be, while not very memorable or exciting, drinkable. While I won’t go looking for this beer specifically, if offered it, I won’t turn up my nose at it."

"It's unfair to judge this beer by the same mental standard you use for your favorite beers, if you're a serious beerhead. This is a nicely-done, flavorful, wheat, where (I admit) the lemon overpowers the wheat. The grains of paradise add a little spiciness. It's a warm weather beer, and it's something you can serve when it's not a beerhead crowd. Never my first choice for me, but a go-to for the summertime gang."

"Bright Orange cloudy color with a thing ring of white head with spotty lace. Smell wheat bread and lemon maybe a banana in there. The taste is wheat with a pepper bit up front and a tart bitter lemon on the end, a litte spicy. Mouthfeel is thin with a touch of medium but perfect for what a summer beer should be to me. Overall this beer gets called plan and boring but its awsome for summer and I love it for sitting out on the deck. I think it has nice flavor for a beer that needs to be thin and drinkable during a hot day."

"Sam's Summer Ale (2013) - Sam's Seasonal brews vary oh so slightly year to year as they continue to perfect and evolve the brew to keep things fresh. So it is with this fine Summer beer. Smells of wheat grass, lemons, and orange citrus. Bright cloudy yellow body reminiscent of a Heffenweizen or a thick fruit beer. Low lacing and small head on aggressive pour. Good mouth feel for warmer weather. Light. Crisp. Smooth and not too dry. Refreshing to say the least. Skunked hops lager like front taste. Hints of coriander, limes, and lemons throughout. Mid-palate it goes fruity and there is a mild spice. Almost cinnamon though they claim pepper from Grains of Paradise. I can see that. But it's not a hot pepper, it's a gentle bite transitioning the last taste where everything goes all copper hoppy as any true ale should thus revealing its real origin. Slight lemon and orange after taste. A little ale and alcohol. Very full and complex. Yet so drinkable despite all those flavors and transitions. The citrus and slow roll off of the hops to a mild malt works well. Creates a real Saison session feel to it. Good with poultry or on its own to refresh. Nice job Sam's. Definitely moved up a notch on my list-- no longer overbearing of citrus to the point of turning my stomach after more than 2 in an evening. I remember hating this beer a year ago. Clearly I was not alone and someone noticed; progress is sometimes a good thing! Cheers. 3.5 out of 5. Very good."
""
"Overall - A good brew, but not a great brew, almost more like a fruit beer category than a wheat ale, in my opinion. A drinking beer, not a tasting beer."

"No more no less than expected it's nice for a hot day on the porch but not for a tasting with friends."
""
""

"Overall: A good refreshing summer beer. It is a winner!"

"O=Reminds me of a cream ale with lemonade...I've never had Leinie's Summer Shandy, but this is sweet and creamy enough to keep me from trying Leinie's...may buy again...want enough to try the tap version."

"Its a tasty beer for what it is. Nothing worth really paying for. Drink it if you're offered one, I guess. There are quite a few better beers from the BBC but this one is much easier to find, quite to my dismay. This tastes of lemon peels and citrus fruits. Its good for people who dislike beer with any distinct flavor and enjoy the flavor of a sweet, rounded, juicy beer-like concoction instead."

"O: Overall it's just another wheat beer to me. I guess it's got a summer thing going to it but I felt the lemon and other ""summer"" characteristics were a bit faint if not barely noticeable. Still, its an A-OK beer that I could see me consuming large quantities during a barbecue and I'd buy it again if there was nothing better, not to hate on it but Sam Adams has some much better beers you could drink."

It is not as light as a bud light coors light etc. but if your looking for a lighter beer with some flavor then this is the beer for you"
""
""

"Totally decent wheat beer for summer. Had this poured from a bottle into a pint gass. I've always liked the soft hazy yellow-gold of a Sam Summer, I think it has a color that is less pale and hazy than a lot of wheat beers, but isn't too gold. Just a somewhat unique appearance. The lemon flavor is...a bit strong, but not so bad as to be a turn-off."
""

"It's mediocre beer."

"the first sip reveals a light body, a crisp finish, wheat bread aftertaste. There is a nice spiciness, a very nice lightness to the body, no cloying sweetness. Obviously this is a ubiquitous summer beer, usually served in a pint glass. the swirlability in a tulip improved this beer tremendously. Its a nice summer offering, a party beer sure to please those looking for a not too imposing wheat beer."
"Relatively complex for a ""summer"" ale. Orangish cloudly look. Decent mouthfeel. The smell was very lemony and the taste followed suit. It just had too much lemon taste for me. I was expecting more from this beer, but the lemon flavor overpowered everything else."

"Samuel Adams Summer Ale ---3/5."
"O- Another solid entry from Boston Beer. While most of their beers don't blow you away, they are all well-made and solid craft beers and I've never had a bad one. This year's Summer Ale is better than those I've had before (which were underwhelming and very bland), so kudos to them for that."

"Yup, taste is a wheat pale ale. There doesn't seem to be that big of a distinction between these wheat ales. This is just a typical everyday refreshing beer. This won't blow anybodies socks off but is perfect for sitting on the beach. If found for the right price this is totally worth it on a hot day."
""

This is all I have to say, this is all I have to say, this is all I have to say. I'm listening to Titus Andronicus right now. Hopefully tickets to Americanarama Bob Dylan, Wilco, and MMJ aren't too expensive. These reviews are largely for myself."

"Overal, the wheat and the lemon citrus seem to make up the majority of smell and taste that this brew has to offer. Yet, both are certainly underwhelming. I would not get this again (but probably will if it comes in next year's summer sampler, which I'm sure it will). It's not a bad drink; probably best enjoyed colder on a hot day."
""
""
"O - This is not a bad beer, but following on the heels of Alpine Spring is tough. In fact, it looks, smells, and tastes like they removed 50% of the flavor from Alpine Spring and re-branded it as Summer Ale. I've tried it on tap from two different establishments this week, and the experience was the same. It makes a nice accompaniment with a meal, and it's better than standard macro fare, but not much."

"Golden yellow color with minimal head and heavy carbonation. Sweet, citrus, and fruity aroma. Tart citrus taste with yeast, bread notes. Peppery spice aftertaste. Light body. Good for times in the summer when you want a summer beer but not a Bud Light with Lime."

"Hazy yellow orange in color with a very fizzy head that leaves a nice ring of lace on top. Aroma is suprisingly heavy on the malt with a bread dough aroma add in some orange and lemon peel. Kind of taste like a flavorful unsweet tea, heavy on the lemon, with a spice kick. I can't quite figure out what the spice is. I'm guessing ""Grains of Paradise"" because that's what it says on the bottle. Thin mouthfeel that's perfect for Summertime sessions. Overall not a bad summer beer. Not great but not bad either. Good beach beer."

A solid brew that is well worth picking up, particularly if you are a fan of wheaty beers in general."

"Of all the seasonal beers that Sam Adams produces, this is certainly my least favorite. This brew is better than most of the gimmicky seasonals that you will find on the shelf of your local supermarket, but certainly at the bottom end of what the Samuel Adams brewery puts out. Not a bad beer, but not something that I will go out of my way to find, or even order in a bar."

"Overall: Definatly one of my favorites and always will be."
"Overall: I had really high hopes for this one after hearing the ad on the radio. This is a run of the mill wheat beer. Nothing too special."
"Pours a hazy yellow with a thin, creamy white head. Smells like iced tea with lemon. Taste is initially some fresh wheat dough, followed by a hint of pepper. After that is a big lemony sweet component. It finishes with a whipped cream flavor along with a hint of herbal hops. Quite creamy mouthfeel. Overall a pretty good wheat beer."
""

""
"Out of a bottle this beer was a cloudy golden-orange color with a nice white head. The lacing off the fine collar was impressive and sticky leaving fishnets all the way down my glass. The aroma was of pale malt, light crystal malts and a hint of must. The flavors were clean and refreshing but a bit blase. I tasted pale malts, a hint of spice from the grains of paradise but almost no hop presence. The mouthfeel was average, the body light/medium and the carbonation moderate. I know this beer is very popular but truth be told I find it rather forgettable."

"The beer pours a piss yellow with some orange flame towards the middle of the glass and thin frothy Styrofoam white that bubbles like nothing, and dissipates pretty quickly leaving edged up light lacing that really doesn’t last either and fades away to a clean glass edge. The smell is light and wheat-like with some nice spicy notes that almost remind of oregano, but must be the grains of paradise. The citrus layers-in throughout the smell as well. The beer tastes similar to the smell. It’s a little thicker with its wheat taste, but the spices play nicely on the sides of the tongue, again drawing to mind the grains of a paradise flavor and some citrusy sides. There are definitely some other spicy notes present that suggest that the yeast did some nice things to the flavor, but they are faint beside the citrus, wheat, and grains of paradise. This beer is very smooth on the tongue, but a little thin and watery over all. Carbonation is a little coarse and bubbly on the tongue, but overall quite nice. There is also a slight jelly-like feel that is left on the tongue after the beer washes through. The after feel of the mouth is actually quite nicely refreshed and wetted, which is very nice. Overall this is a decent summer wheat ale. I definitely like it more than Smuttynose’s Summer Weizen, which is the only other summer wheat ale I have really had this summer. Not my favorite beer, but not terrible either. I would have it again. A great cheaper price for decent beer."
"This bier is light and dry, with the lemon peel quite evident and refreshing. The Aframomum melegueta is found in the lightly spicy and peppery finish, and lingers slightly on the palate. I don't usually go for these summery type biers, but this one hit the spot, especially on a hot July day... Prosit!"

"Mouthfeel: This is a light bodied and easy drinking session beer that a person could drink several of without getting too full or your tongue taking a beating from too intense of flavor. This is a great beer for a hot day at the lake or at the campground."

"Paid $10 for a 6 pack of this. Poured from a bottle into a lager glass. Pours a deep yellowish orange with about a finger and a half of head. The smell is of banana and wheat, With a little bit of odd skunk. The taste was of stale lemons and perhaps some stale wheat and oranges?. Sounds appealing but keep in mind that they all tasted like fruits long passed their due date. The mouthfeel was heavily carbonated with almost none of the flavors coming through except for some extreme bitterness from sitting it in the mouth for more than a few seconds at a time. Overall this beer was NOT worth the money whatsoever. It's too bad, I wanted this beer to be good but I just couldn't get passed the lemon dish soap mouthfeel. I wouldn't buy it again."

"On tap at Rainforest Cafe, Grapevine, TX. Served in a ""brewtus"" style glass 23oz. Pours out to thin white head and hazy yellow color. Aroma is sharp wheat malt and muted lemon, grass and pepper. Flavor is a strong wheat graininess and tartness with a grassy dry finish. Mouthfeel is light but rough and a bit parching. Overall this tastes like a typical American wheat ale. The lemon peel and grains of paradise don't really stand out."
""
""
""
""
"""Blink and you miss it"" head, smells way stronger than it tastes. Slightly bitter at the tip of the tongue then lemony all the way down. Not a fan of 'fruity' beers per se, but this is as fruity as I will go. Delightful beer to sip on while mowing the lawn in my opinion."
"O: This beer is easy to drink and can be considered a bit refreshing but the taste is not that interesting, except that the grains of paradise prevent it from being bland."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A pretty interesting beer, the spice is a nice new flavor, though a little overpowering. Making the other flavors heavier and lightening the carbonation would add to it. Good beer for the summer time."
""
""
"O: A bit boring imo but it gets the job done in the summertime playing horse shoes or grilling burgers. But there are much better summer options out there."
""

"O:  Crisp and refreshing with a sweet wheat and tart fruits. Nice and drinkable especially on hot days. A summer favorite for sure.  "

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 9 oz glass. Pours a cloudy orange straw with a froffy head, but it dissipates quickly and leaves little lacing. Smells of wheat and spices, very clean and nice. Tastes of wheat with orange flavors, very nice. This light bodied beer is very refreshing and has perfect carbonation. Overall a very good beer."

"Pilsner glass on tap. Hazy pale golden color. Small head with no lacing. Flowery and sweet nose. Sweet and fruit flavor. Flower notes. Almost slightly buttery. Thick and fizzy on the palate with a long cloying finish. Overall a little too sweet for me."

"Pours a hazy brown with an orangey hue. Wheaty, peppery citrus aroma. Taste was a bit overly malted for me, but crisp and refreshing. Nice summer session brew, and widely available from Applebees to mom and pop places. You cant really go to wrong with it."
"Cheers !!"
"O-A boring summer beer whose lemon is almost artificial."

"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer and I thought that it was an average example of the style, nothing about this beer was bad, but there was also nothing that stuck out as being well done. This beer had ok drinkability, it was pretty smooth, and a little refreshing, but the flavors don't hold my interest and one is enough for me. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't that bad and had most of the aspects that I look for in this style. What I like least about this beer was the flavor, it was a little lighter then it should be and the flavors didn't come together as well as some of the better beers in the style. I wouldn't buy this beer on it's own, I would much rather have Oberon for a similar price, Oberon is much better all the way around, this is worth a try but don't expect it to be the new summer staple. This beer was ok as far as summer ales go, but Oberon is still my favorite of the style, this beer doesn't come close to being as good, and is pretty average all the way around, this is pretty much the perfect example if what an average APWA is like, this beer is going to need some work if they want it to be a great example of the style, but it is what is."
"O- Good flavor for an outdoor summer beer."
""
""
""
"O - This is an average American wheat ale. Nothing really stands out anywhere. The use of grains of paradise is unique, but it comes across just like peppery yeast that is commonly used in wheat beers. All this being said, it is very drinkable and refreshing beer that is fit for the summer. Also, it seems like this would be a good “gateway” beer - something for which Sam Adams is pretty famous."

"Overall – Absolutely not a beer I would drink again or recommend. I had a feeling this was going to be similar to the way people described Summer Shandy to me, and that didn’t sound like my bag, and this beer certainly is not my type. The artificial fruit flavoring, just like that in almost any beer, really ruins any flavoring or drinkability. Maybe this is beer is right up some’s alley, but not mine. I have done my best to write an objective review, but I couldn’t help but for a little bit of opinion to seep in."

"underrated in my opinion. intriguing nose of fresh fruit juice, black pepper, and light malts. flavor is complex for a summer beer, some spice happening up front, followed by a lemongrassy citrus thing that isnt acidic but it is sharp. some hops in the finish, and the grains of paradise seasoning really adds some depth without being distracting. i like this beer a lot, always have. when its ice cold it is as good a summer beer as any, the malt profile is perfectly light, the body is light, the carbonation is right on, and its an easy 12pack on hot summer afternoon. i have very little to critique about this beer, maybe a bit of a funky aftertaste, but just keep sipping and its real good."

"O- I've had the Sam's Summer quite a few times and I've never been a huge fan. There are much better summer beers/wheat beers out there. To me it has a pleasant lemony smell, but the taste isn't quite there. It has too much of a watery taste, that doesn't quite taste right. I tried the Dogfish Namaste right before this to compare and it was significantly better. That beer had much more flavor, something Sam's Summer should definitely try to strive for. It's a decent local beer for hot summer days, but there are definitely some better options out there."
"If I wasn't from Massachusetts, the desire to try this beer probably wouldn't be as high as if I were from somewhere other than New England. With that being said, this beer is only a notch above Blue Moon and Shock Top. I like how there isn't an adjunct used in the brewing process, but it still just tastes too similar to Blue Moon and Shock Top, and not enough like a craft brewer made it."

"Samuel Adams Summer Ale is practically ubiquitous in bars and restaurants across the country during the warm months. In typical Samuel Adams fashion, its quality falls about directly in between a high quality micro brew and a macro. I found the lemon grass notes a little off-putting in this beer, but appreciated the attempt at complexity non-the-less. I would drink this if given to me, but would much rather pick up Widmer Hef for a heat-beating American Pale Wheat."
"Maybe this was just a bad bottle, but this is my least favorite Sam's by far."

"Mouthfeel is fine- very light body, light to moderate carbonation. I'll never get this again- boring, mildly offensive flavor and aroma."
"O: Drinkable and refreshing. I enjoyed it."
""
""
"Pours slightly hazy golden with an abundant white head that dissipates. Carbonation does not appear to be abundant. Aromas of wheat and citrus are present in the smell. There isn't much spice in the smell if it is detectable at all. The citrus flavor melds well with the flavors of the wheat. The peppery nature of the grains of paradise cuts in nicely to help balance the flavors of this beer. The mouthfeel is light with moderate carbonation. It's very refreshing now that temperatures have reached the 80's here in Louisiana. It will only become more refreshing as the temperatures climb. Overall, this is a good beer that is crisp and refreshing. It serves its purpose in many ways and I feel it does it well."
""
""
""
""
"Man the smell's check bounced on this one. Very light. but unbalanced. Slight hints of lemons balance out the wheat twang, and the grains of paradise (which I can only assume taste peppery) come through only very slightly."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange color with a bright white head. Orange rind and lemon zest on the nose. Bits of sweetened biscuits as well. Creamy mouthfeel with lower than average carbonation. Sweet fruitiness of citrus and orange. A bit grainy, some detectable wheatiness. Almost clove like finish with a very modest spicy hop profile on the back end. Big but slightly bland as well. I don't mind the taste it is unique but heavy for a summer seasonal. Would be really really good with breakfast though oddly enough haha. I guess its a good summer day started."

"Appears as a somewhat murky amber with orangish highlights and a fluffy two finger head with fairly decent lacing...looks like a hefeweizen in appearance, not a pale wheat ale. The grains of paradise produce a funky aroma that I really like: sort of like a cross between cracked peppercorns, nutmeg, cinnamon, and anise. Almost like a chinese five spice blend on top of a fragrant lemon peel and wheat malt. Flavor is spiced similarly to the nose but at a slightly more muted level, texture is kind of thick but not syrupy, finish is also kind of strange because all the spicing drops away leaving the orange peel all by its lonesome in the end."

"Overall, this is good fare, nicely fitting the ""summer ale"" moniker as a light, refreshing beer good for hot summer months when heavy flavors and high ABVs might not be so appealing. The flavors are nice--though I found the pepper profile slightly overpowering--and leave a clean citrus feeling in the mouth. I could see this being a nice mid-day beer as a break from the August honey-do list."

"Considering the fact that it's currently freezing outside, I figured it was about time to get this out of my fridge and review it. I've had this probably once or twice a year for the past couple of years, and I always have the same issue. It lacks balance. For a summer beer, the flavors need to mellow."
"Low C"
"Overall, a solid example of the style. Great and refreshing for a hot summer day."
"While I choose not to partake of this particular draught again, I would recommend it to anyone that has a predilection for grapefruit. I was disappointed by Summer Ale, but Sam Adams has a good selection of some other, fairly palatable pilseners and beers."
"Overall: Very good beer. All four categories are well accounted for. The only thing keeping it from being perfect is the under use of grain"
"It tasted like peach and tires but without the bitterness."
"Overall: I have found that for my personal taste, ales are tastier than lagers. I'm not a huge fan of the Witbier, but if SASA is a good representation of the American Pale Wheat Ale style, I'm going to strongly consider looking for them as opposed to straight Witbiers. VERY, very tasty."
"About what I expected from this beer. Not that interesting but perfectly drinkable."
"B- (3.5)"
" Overall, very much what I expected it to be: middle of the road, ""summer"" lager typical of Samuel Adams."
"I don't know. I figured with this being Samuel Adams, it would be good. But wow, I was very disappointed."
"Or adequate to quote a friend."
"Overall just by its pale almost straw appearance this beer will help cool you off as well provide something light on the pallet. I recommend this brew as one of those beers that you should have wioth light food or just to sit outside on your patio and drink."
"Not the simple quencher that I expexted from this. Drinkable and interesting."
"This has been a favorite summer beer of mine since I started drinking. It's got that nice, refreshing, summery vibe to it with a unique lemony zest built right in. Over the years I've found myself drinking it a bit less than I used to (to be fair I started really high and I have diversified my tastes greatly since). Nevertheless, I will still grab one of these from time to time and enjoy it thoroughly. Sam Adams does some really solid seasonal beers."
"I bought the summer mix pack because it was hot and I felt like a summer beer. Sadly I'm reminded why I avoid Sam Adams's attempts at summer beers. They really don't have enough character, depth, and being flawless in execution of a bad beer isn't really something to hang your hat on."
"This is a pleasant example of an American wheat beer."
"Light to medium bodied with decent carbonation, this beer is crisp and refreshing. The body may be a little thick for the style but is certainly light enough to make it very drinkable. The carbonation is not overly apparent and seems to operate more in the background."
"Light mouthfeel that goes down very easy. Not the best effort from SA, but I could.see this being a decent hot weather beer when the choices are limited."
"A hazy lemon yellow in color,no head to speak of with light lacing of the glass. Soft lemon citrus taste with a hint of spice. Very refreshing with a pleasant aftertaste, as you would expect for a summer seasonal!"
"On tap @ Outback Steakhouse, Springfield NJ. Pours a nice golden pale yellow hue with a nice lasting white head. A nice citrus and lemon aroma, with some wheat and light grassy notes. Taste is sweet citrus and lemon peel, wheat and grassiness with some light malt. Palate is light bodied, with a nice crisp mouthful and light carbonation. Finish light sweet malt, wheat, some citrus notes ending in a slight lingering nutty flavor. Overall a nice easy drinking and refreshing summer ale."
"Drink- Just a very unique summer beer, way to lemony and tart and not in a good way."
"Slight wheaty flavor hits your mouth first, then is overtaken by nicely-balanced hops and some lemon zest. I think the lemon zest is a tad overdone. If I wanted lemon in a wheat beer, I'd put it in there myself. Still, the beer is quite refreshing, nicely priced, and generally easy to find when the weather gets hot."
"it gets a meh."
"Overall, this is a simple but refreshing and satisfying beer for the summer time."
"Just average. I could definitely pound these at a family cookout and would drink them if available, but don't see myself picking up a six-pack again anytime soon. Flavors and aromas too subtle, but this beer would probably be enjoyable to the BMC crowd."
"This is a great American Pale Wheat and it's quite the crowd-pleaser. Nice silky feel from the wheat and it even speaks of a flaked grain with the oily bits and how it coats the tongue. In short, this beer speaks to alot of folks and I see nothing wrong with that or this beer. Tasty."
"M: Simple yet refreshing. Carbonated, wet, with decent wheat finish."
"Another good beer after a round of golf or that cutting the lawn thing. Really enjoyed this with a hibachi dinner tonight."
"It is a good introduction beer to get your friends out of the typical macros. Unfortunately it is lacking too much in flavor for most beer lovers."
"Cheers"
"D: Sort of reminds you of a really clean and anodyne Wit. Muted wheat, minimal haze, no yeasty notes, mild spice, plentiful lemon. Approachable BBQ beer. Should be good for getting folks to think of something other than macro swill. Better with food than on its own."
"Not a bad beer. I had thought I didn’t like this that much, but it must have been their winter lager. Clean, crisp and refreshing, perfect for the summer."
"Anyways it smells of wheat and lemon and pretty much follows that on the Taste. Mouth is substantial with just enough body. Overall this is am easy drinker for hot days and nights and someone new to craft beer might be able to enjoy this simple summer ale."
"A nice drinkable beer. Very satisfying and a hot summer day."
"Drinkability - boy, these are thirst-quenching. Not too sweet so perfect to complement a summer afternoon or evening."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with slightly bland flavours and aromas. A bit too lemony for my liking."
"Overall: One of the better summer ales. If you rate this for overall appeal, it falls in line with many of the others out there but for a summer ale, it is one of the better ones."
"Interesting refreshing session beer, but nothing special."
"O - Avg at best, sometimes the only non BMC available, but nothing I would ever seek out"
"Overall: Not a bad summer brew. Nice an refreshing, not too heavy. Very enjoyable, and nice part of the summer sampler."
"Another solid offering from Boston Beer. Not amazing, but pretty tasty. Refreshing - a nice summer session beer."
"Final Thoughts: It's alright. Nothing special, but I suppose they cater to a pretty wide audience."
"O- I'm not a big fan. There are much better wheat ales, and much better summer seasonals that I prefer."
" My least favorate Sam Adams brew to date.Just to much lemon as I said many times. I know alot of people that enjoy this,It's just not for me."
"Orangey body that lacks cloudiness, but has a nice white head that drops quickly to a non-lacing ring. Notes of orange and lemon peel and spice (pepper?) are on the nose. The body follows up with much the same, and could be described as refreshing, hence the ""summer"" I suppose. The fruitiness tastes a little pithy to me though. A little viscous with a very heavy bite from the carbonation. Finishes cleanly. Nothing special, and not something I would seek out again."
"O: not my cup of tea. actually thought that it tasted much better before it warmed and the spice kicked in."
"M: went down smooth, like a summer beer should. Would have liked more of the lemon sensation in its sourness or bitterness. Was just a note."
"This has always been one of my favorite seasonals. It is sessionable and refreshing."
"Way to go Jim, keep putting out horrible beer!"
"I give two Schlitz about Samuel Adams Summer Ale."
"This could be the LCBO's fault, as the beer was bottled over 2 months ago and likely stored improperly along the way, but this is a huge letdown after trying the Noble Pils in the springtime. Will give it another shot if I see it on tap, but this one literally left me with a bad taste in my mouth."
"O - Overall, not a bad summer beer for a hot day. Easily sessionable."
"I don’t know that I would seek this one out. It’s probably one of the most disappointing seasonals from Boston Beer Co. It was the best beer That Grotto’s had on tap at the time, so no regrets here."
"O-Not a bad interpretation of the style.Really nothing exciting or unique with this beer, but im not a real fan of this style i much prefer a Saison or a Pilsner for a good summer time drink."
"It is definetly refreshing, and its spicy and sweet, gets a bit tiresome to drink but I guess I'd drink it again."
"malty taste, slight hops. orange peel again/citrus. good carbonation and drinkability, overall was pretty average."
"Beer pours a slightly hazy yellow with a thin, quickly dissipating head. Aroma is slightly toasted, crackery grain, lemon and just a slightly spicy note, really slight. Lemon and grain on the front followed by a bit of spice (again, just a slight bit) and then a long persistent, bitter finish. Not really a pleasantly floral hop bitterness bit more of an acrid bitterness. Carbonation is a bit unrefined as well, I wanted something a little creamier given the style. Definitely not one of Boston Beer's finest, although I remain a fan of some of their other stuff."
"I can't help but feel that this would be a much better beer without the inclusion of the lemon peel. As it is, I'm left with more of a lemon pledge sensation in my mouth than summer refreshment. Not a bad beer beer, but certainly not one of my favorite seasonal offerings from Sam Adams."
"D/O: This wheat beer takes a few plays from the Belgian book, incorporating the clean citrus and spice notes from the flavor adjuncts it features, while yeast stays politely out of the picture. Flavors are appropriate to the style and the seasonal theme, but may be constrained by the need to not offend."
"Overall – A decent summer refresher. Probably not something I'd go out of my way to seek out again, but still decent."
"O: overall not a very good addition to the style, bland notes of hay and grass, not one of the best from Sam Adams."
"Overall, I really enjoy this beer. I highly recommend it."
"Pours a deep golden straw color with a smallish white head that quickly dissipates to a cap. Spicy aroma that smells of lemon, pepper, and sweet malts. Taste is sweet with honey like malts, lemon and pepper and that spicy wheat taste. Moderate level of carbonation, medium body, slick sweet mouthfeel. Nice Summer ale if not a bit boring. Not bad but nothing I would regularly seek out."
"O: There were some nice flavors, but nothing really stood out. It was a refreshing brew though."
"My sample poured a 2"" off-white head. Body is an attractive hazy sunny yellow. Smells faintly of malt and citrus. Taste to me though falls into fairly standard BMC style. The lemon peel is barely a suggestion during the drink, and a little stronger in the finish. There's a moderate acidic zing in the finish and I suspect that's the grains of paradise (pepper). You know I've heard some comment Summer Ales don't always come out the same way and I think this is the case. Clearly some reviewers got a whole lot more or whole lot less out of their samples."
"Overall, this beer had a lot of flavor for such great drinkability. This beer really grew on me the last year or so and is a true summer favorite of mine. Buy a sixer at least and give it a shot."
"M./O. The mouthfeel is a light bodied slightly watery feel that is smooth and very easy to drink. This is a decent lemon flavored summer beer, even though I would prefer Leinie's Summer Shandy over this,"
"I tasted of citrus, some wheat, bread, yeast. It was pretty light with a little bite at the end, but was a very nice summer beer. great for the sand."
"Easy drinker and serves its purpose well as a summer beer."
"I think it's a great and somewhat unique flavor for a summer brew. It's perfect on a hot summer day. And is my personal favorite of the Sam seasonals. It does seem to taste a little different to me this year though, as though they may have tweaked the recipe a tiny bit this year. Could be wrong though."
"The beer is mostly clear and appears golden yellow in color. The head is minimal, thanks to a most generous pour from a gracious bartender. The aroma is weak, with some hints of lemon. The flavor is akin to Lemon Pledge...not digging it. The beer tastes of artificial additives. The back half is just too odd and artificial for me to enjoy. Not a repeat for me."
"sam summer is a nice zesty beer. Most ""summer"" beers tend to be wheat ales- that lean to the lighter and fruitier side- but ol sammy aint holdin back. This is a full bodied summer. There are nice citrus flavors mixed in with the full boddiedness that is kindred to sams boston lagar. I really like all of sam adams seasonals- and the summer ale hangs with the best of 'em."
"O - I used to enjoy this much more but lately find other, much better, summer seasonals. This is a good beer to start that BBQ with, before you move on."
"Smells inoffensive. Looks allright. Citric acid taste with a finish reminiscent of medicinal alcohol. Give me the good old fashioned Sam Adams."
"D- Not something I would go back for, finishing one feels a bit like a labor. There are WAY better summer ales out there (Heavy Seas comes to mind). This is another example of a bad use of flavorings by Boston Beer Company."
"D/O- not my favorite style but their are some GREAT examples (Gumballhead, A Little Sumpin Sumpin Ale) and this one doesn't even compare. Others may like this one (BMCers?) but I don't care for it much."
"D- Zestiness comes through in the nose but on the palate it never really gets going. A little malty sweetness dying and this zestiness that comes up the back trying to provide balance but its too late. Not one i would consider a first choice summer beer."
"Overall +0.5 points added for being drinkable and even a bit refreshing."
"The pour netted a finger of rocky, off-white head that was burbling and bubbling its way out of existence pretty quickly. Color was an oh-so-slightly hazy golden yellow, suggesting that they did not filter the life out of it like that extra clear Blue Moon Summer wack nonsense. Nose was initially lemon citrusy, but then I got a real whiff of those Grains of Paradise and I felt like I had inhaled black pepper. Zounds! Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, not quite creamy, but close. This tasted really good, especially after those last two Summer losers, with an initial lemon citrusiness that quickly got out of the way for those Grains of Paradise, which filled my sinuses like there was room or I wanted them there. I kid you not, I was so close to a sneezing fit that it was not funny! Finish was pleasantly dry and I would highly recommend it were it not for the fact that it is not in a CAN and bottles are frowned upon at many summer destinations."
" Loyalty to Sam is not unlike loyalty to the Red Sox I guess. I won't go away, will just hope for better."
"O- This a very good summer ale, it' s refreshing like a summer ale should be. Much better than coastal wheat."
"Overall really middle of the road beer for me here. Not getting much out of this one."
"Overall this is a solid session beer. One I will enjoy with the love of my life. This is her favorite beer. Not bad but, not the best I have had when it come to wheat beers."
"Note: I love BBC, but I had to drainpour the final 4 oz or so, this got gross."
"O- The dry crisp taste is refreshing but the soapy notes and lemon pepper flavor are to strong and don't have any support making this a bit rough to finish a glass. The flavors described on the bottle are all there but that is all that is there."
"A very unique summer beer in my opinion. A little too sweet for my taste, but still very delicious and refreshing on a hot day, and certainly more interesting than some other summer beers I've had this year. I'd pick it up again, though I'd rather see what else I could find first."
"Food match: Chinese food mixed with Mexican cuisine might just work with this."
"Kind of a biting carbonation...not the smooth summer quencher I was looking for. Interesting attempt, but not for me."
"O- A good beer for a hot day and one I can have a few of without the taste becoming overpowering or bland."
"Poured this 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The American Wheat Ale poured a cloudy orange color and it produced a white head. The Head Retention for this ale was very poor, especially for a Boston Beer Company product. The ale did leave behind moderate lacing.The aroma of the ale consisted of light wheat, lemon and yeast. The beer is light in body and is very smooth. The taste was a very soft wheat with citrus lemon and a slightly spicy finish. The spice could be coriander and pepper. Overall an average beer- a bit below of what I am used to when it comes to the Sam Adams line."
"The Summer Ale by Sammy A is not one of my favorite....there are many other summer beers I would choose over this one. The appearance is a pale yellow with white head that laced nicely. The smell is dominated by lemon citrus. The taste leaned on the acidic side and was not overly refreshing to me. The mouthfeel is fine...if you like a tartness to your beer."
"style that typically goes down easy for hours, I never desire more than one of these."
"O: I would recommend this. The grains of paradise is a nice, unique touch that makes this beer stand out from the run-of-the-mill American Pale Wheat Ale. The lemon rind compliments the overall flavor nicely as well. If you're looking for a good summer beer, I think this is a good choice."
"Overall - interesting but not my speed. the peppery flavors throw the whole beer off for me."
"O: An ok summer brew – nothing I would grab for all the time though."
"Summary - I am a disappointed in this Sam Adams. Not that there is anything necessarily wrong with it, but nothing really impressed me. It is a balanced brew and a little heavy on the carbonation. Not much else to say."
"Pours a crystal clear pale yellow color with a big 2 inch off-white head that fades to a thin cap. Random splotches of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smells of wheat, citrus zest, and spices. Taste of of wheat and spices with a slightly bitter citrus zest finish. Mild hop bitterness quickly fades between sips. This beer has a lower carbonation level with a crisp but slightly thick mouthfeeel. Overall, this is a pretty good Summer beer. My wife really liked this one so I bet this is going to be a staple in our fridge this season."
"This brew pours a pale honey hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a creamy two finger head and heaps of lacing,the smell is lemon zest,citrus and peppery hops,it has a light bodied well carbonated mouthfeel and the taste is pretty much the same as smell with lemon zest,pungent citrus,light toffee and finished with a hit of dry,spicy,peppery hops and overall a nice Summer drop but thats it for me cheers."
"O - A great summer pounder that has any number of fond associations for me. Nostalgia aside, it's a solid summer beer that I'm happy to see on tap throughout the bar-o-sphere this time of year. Cheers,"
"Pours a hazy golden with a nice white head that recedes fairly quickly to a thin layer of bubbles. Light malty aroma, lemony, grainy. Typical wheat bite in the mouth, with obvious lemon and peppery spice; a little harshness to it, but for a major label, not a bad beer. Good balance of flavors. Light bodied and easily drinkable; best in summertime...obviously."
"D - Good summer drink; something I would consider picking up, but would most likely pass on if there were other options to consider"
"Overall: this beer has a few good points, but they are mostly blown away by the inappropriateness of this grain in this beer. I'm sure it would work well in a saison, but in this beer it is neither particularly tasty nor refreshing."
"Overall: Bad beer that seems to want to be refreshing as well as interesting and a bit esoteric. Fails on both counts; not too many distinct flavors, and they get tiresome early on, plus it simply is not refreshing. The pepper and unpleasant bitterness are too prominent. I highly prefer water to this."
"Overall it is less than I would expect for a summer ale, but well suited for a hot afternoon with the promise of many beer enjoying hours."
"O: A nice little, refreshing summer ale; this is one of those beers that you could drink one after another from bottle or glass; this is a beer you give to your BMC drinking friends to help them see the light"
"Overall: While this is a decent beer, I don't feel it represents summer in any way. I feel the spices are more suited to an Autumn brew. There are just too many good summer beers out there to waste your time on this one."
"Overall an ok beer. Good for BBQ's to get other non beer drinkers into beer I guess."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tumbler. Best by Sept. Pours a very pale stray color with two fingers of light foam and lots of big bubbly carbonation. Minimal lacing. Lemon and yeast on the nose with a little malty sweetness. Mouthfeel has good carbonation but there is a syrupy texture that is off putting. Palate is sweet, spicy, and mildly bitter like a lager. Lemon and honey notes. Not really my cup o tea. Can't imagine it being anyone else's either."
"Hazy bright yellow with a large amount of bubbly head. It dissipates quickly however to leave almost nothing. A lot of spice in the nose with a some lemon and sweet wheat malt. The flavor is an extremely tangy lemon zest with a malty sweet but spicy middle. The finish is dry and bitter from the yeast and lemon. I have to drink them quickly because once it got slightly warm it was harder to put down."
"O – Oppressive herbal note comes off almost like cleaning fluid. If the not was toned down to about 70% of it’s current intensity I think it’d be a much better beer."
"O: Overall, I really liked this beer. I wouldn't treat Summer Ale as a special beer to drink when celebrating something, but it tastes good and is easy to drink. This is an excellent beer to drink during hot summers."
"Everything except the taste is good for a lawnmower beer. But the pith flavor really sucked. I mean really sucked hard."
"Overall Impression- I was hoping Samuel Adam's Summer Ale was going to be superb! Not the case. The hype was about this beer inside the bar, and when I went to go swim and drink this beer, I wasn't satisfied at all! Would say that you could drink many in a day (for those who are expecting a totally different beer) but I actually struggled to finish this one. Once again, nothing against Samuel Adams, but this didn't hit the style well."
"O: I guess an ok summer ale, the citrus comes through too strong."
"D: Don't know if this is extremely sessionable due to the pepperiness but it is very good and unique. A nice change to summer wheat beers. Strays more savory than the typical sweet."
"Mehhh... suitable for quenching one's thirst at an airport while waiting for one's flight during a storm delay, but not really much else. Can't imagine ordering this one again any time soon."
"O: Alright, at the very best. My impressions of Sam Adams have always been that it’s a brewery with a good heart, but a salesman’s brain. It’s capitalism at its finest: show commercials that insinuate your product is made with tons of the best ingredients and care, then watch your cheaply-made product fly off the shelves. Hopefully I find something in the Sam Adams lineup (that doesn't cost $150+ per bottle, mind you) which will change my mind. For now, though, my opinion remains unchanged."
"Overall, its an ok flavoring, not very refreshing but still easy to drink. Rather disappointing to be honest. Barely acceptable if offerred."
"Nothing complex or exciting here but this beer is a fine refresher on a summer's day. It's a toned down, drinkable version of all the lemon/lime abominations that are on the market now."
"T: This was pretty refreshing, with some light grain and pale malt flavor along with a light bit of lemon. It wasn't mindblowing and the mouthfeel was a bit light, but there could be a place for this in the summertime."
"O: Its ok, not bad, but I am not really a fan of it. Not bad on a hot day outside, which is where I had this one, but plenty of other beer out there I would prefer."
"Below average offering here. Just not much flavor, and what there is isn't very good. Has that strange underlying flavor, and is also watery. I'd have been disappointed had I bought this alone rather than part of a package deal."
"I thought I'd had bad beer before- Colt 45, Pearl that had ""turned""- but this one beat them all. Imagine a glass of goat urine with a lemon-rind pitched in. It's baaad."
"The mouthfeel is light and very brisk, the carbonation level is very high here. The drinkability is actually fairly low due to the sweetness, I wish this was toned down a bit. Overall, the most disappointing seasonal I've had from Sam Adams. It could be a really good beer with some tweaking, but is just average as it stands."
"The only redeeming aspect is with how pretty the beer is. The coloring was nice, and the lacing looks really good at the end."
"A lot of people I know really don't like this beer at all, they claim it's ""too perfumey"". I don't really feel that this beer is a bad summer brew at all. The beer pours out as a hazy yellow color with decent sized white head that leaves a pretty nice lacing. The smell of the beer is bright and fresh, it's got some lemon in there and perhaps a few spices on the nose. The taste is a citrusy and grainy blast of freshness. It's a little sweet and it's got a good balance of fruit and beer. The mouthfeel is very easy going. lightly carbonated and soft. This beer is a great for a hot day in the summer to kill off the heat. I wouldn't drink a lot of these in a sitting but one here and there is usually enough."
"Another well-made and very light beer from BBC, though one of my least favorites. I think it is much improved mixed with Rampage DIPA."
"Inoffensive but forgettable."
"Appearance is a darkish yellow with a fuzzy head that recedes fairly quickly. Not much cloudiness like some wheat beers, although that isn't unusual for American beers in that category. Smell is of wheat and some malts. Not too complex but decent. The taste up front is rather pleasant - wheat and spice combine for something light but not bland. It is the aftertaste that gets me. It is overwhelmingly sour, almost soapy. Maybe it was just a bad batch but it is hard for me to overcome the aftertaste. That brings the beer down considerably."
"O: This beer is balanced really well. All the different tastes blend together nicely. I wasn’t sure what to expect coming into this beer but it surprised me on how good it was. This would hit the spot outside on a hot summer day. It’s too bad we can’t get this in Canada."
"O: This is okay; it is very drinkable but not very flavorful."
"Overall: A good version of a pale wheat ale. Nice balance of malts and citrus."
"An OK summer beer but there are a lot better seasonal options out there than this. Not bad if this is your only craft option at a restaurant or BBQ but there are better options."
"Lot's of better attempts out there than this.."
"A simple lager would be better and less offensive than this."
"Overall: This is my first time having this beer so I can't compare it to previous years, but this is probably one of the better summer seasonals out there, and probably the best American Wheat Ale I've had so far, lemons be darned. If the lemons were a little more balanced with the other flavors and not as artificial, I'd give it a higher grade. But it gets kinda gross after the beer warms. Worth a try, though."
"Don't know why I get jazzed to drink this every year. I had it on tap once in the desert (Phoenix) and it tasted so good. It's never that hot here so I ponder... but anyway, I can like this as a great companion to grilled BBQ food with respectable flavor for a summer wheat, but thought they used to leave more tasty floaties behind. And why is Sam approaching $40/cs here in PA?"
"A refreshing summer beer, no doubt. The aroma is better than the taste but not by much. I like it but I think their Spring Seasonal Nobile Pils will be missed more than this Summer Seasonal."
"The Rest: Not what I was expecting for a summer ale. Much more body, but with a fair amount of citrus stuff going on. Overall, pretty decent."
"It's not one of their best beers by any means, nor is it one of their better seasonal releases but it's still a refreshing beer to have on occasion. Nothing worth buying a 6-pack of, but still enjoyable when it needs to be."
"Overall this is a decent beer at times. I would recommend working through a six-pack to decide if you like it or not."
"O-i like sour beers but this has a tangyness to it that makes this one difficult to drink in my opinion. i can see how this might be up some BA's alley, but not mine. this is one of the worst offering of the style that I've ever had."
"Presented well for the style, very drinkable"
"Pours a dark yellow, with a faint white head that dissipates fast. Smell is very wheaty, with a slight lemon/citrus smell. Very fruity hint at the end of the taste, with a wheat taste as well. Very crisp and refreshing. Very easy to drink, great for summer. Very simple."
"Overall it will still be a great beer to enjoy outside in the sun."
"D - It starts out very promising with a nice, spicy and fruity character but things really fall apart in the finish. It gets really medicinal and almost burnt tasting with a stale spice character that lingers long after all of the pleasant aspects have faded away. Too bad really."
"Some flaws in flavor and aroma, but all in all a fairly average offering of a sometimes boring style."
"O: Okay, I know lots of people really don't get excited about pale wheat ales, myself included (except gumballhead). And there seems to be a consensus that Boston Beer Company almosts always comes in as second best or below. But this beer has a few things going for it. 1. Very light and refreshing for hot summer days. 2. The spiciness from the grains of paradise is pretty unique and well showcased in this beer. So, I think I'll see this one in the fridge again."
"O- Overall an ok beer but I buy them basically to have around for people who aren't really that into craft beer because I don't keep any BMC products at my house."
"O: Overall, this is a simplistic brew without much to offer. That's not to say it's bad, but in my opinion it didn't live up to its potential. I was hoping for a bit more flavor and a bit of substance, maybe something that would break outside of the realm of being ""just another Samuel Adam's beer."" That said, it is drinkable and better than most mass-produced American offerings, but I wouldn't go out of my way for one."
"The feel of this beer on my pallet was not as pleasant as most of the beers I have tried from Samuel Adams. I was rather disappointed actually, I expected more. The aroma smelled like most standard wheat beers. In my opinion, this beer was mediocre at best."
"O (D) - Well, I'd been reading about how this beer has gone downhill this year, but I don't know that I've had it before, so I can't refer to anything. However, I can imagine that it used to be better. It's alright, but theres so many better summer beers."
"O - I'm not too impressed with this one. Its an average PWA. Not necessarily bad, but not really one I'd like to drink on a hot summer day."
"I could take it or leave it, you wouldn't need to look further then this brewery for a better ""Summer Beer"" that being said I had no issues finishing it or the one after it for that matter but I doubt I'll be buying another 6er when its on the shelf beside their Nobel Pils for the same price"
"O- I never much cared for this beer before I had this one tonight. Not sure if my palate has changed that much since I have had one or if this if this beer has changed. There is a nice tropical fruit taste and aroma to this beer that I don't remember before and not as much graininess as I remember."
"Overall- I remembered liking last years Summer Ale- I probably would have given last year's a B to B+, but this is very underwhelming especially compared to what I remember. I judged this on its own without the comparison to last year and just going off of what I am seeing, smelling, and tasting currently and I am not a fan. This is the second Sam Adams seasonal in a row that I have been extremely disappointed with."
"Pours a transparent golden color with lasting visible carbonation. An average pour yielded a 1 finger white head. Head slowly dissipated to a thick film on top of my beer, but it gives off no lacing. Smell is of wheat, malt and slight amounts of lemon. Taste has starts off with slight sweetness from the wheat, then it finishes with a slightly spicy note. Mouthfeel is appropriate. Overall, this is by no means a bad beer, it is pretty average for a APWA. The taste is relatively simple, but that is okay with me, it just fills a different niche. Share this with a friend who doesn't drink craft beer."
"O: A below average American Pale Wheat Ale and overall a beer I simply don't enjoy. I won't be trying this again."
"A bit filling compared to something like the Goose Island Summertime. Fantastic for the golf course and summertime grilling."
"overall, few will mistake this for a world class beer, and it generally doesn't garner a lot of love from BAs. however i find it reasonably flavorful and refreshing, pairing well with it's season namesake. you could do a lot worse."
"Overall Drinkability - The bitter sourness ruins this beer."
"Overall I would never purchase this beer again and would almost prefer a bmc."
"Overall: not impressed. I don't know why but I expected this to be a little bit better than it was. The Sam Adams seasonals tend to be decent and well, this was pretty much a macro-lager on a craft tap. I wouldn't bother. Cheers!"
"Poured a straw/yellow color with a nice creamy white head that quickly disapated. Aromas of malt, wheat, and a touch of citrus/lemon. Taste was ok: malt, lemon, a bit of biscut, and no bitterness at all on the finish. Mouthfeel was like any other BMC brew. Not bad for a hot summer day but I won't be seeking this one out again. Definitely better on draft."
"O: Didn't care for it. Probably would not get again. Not my favorite one of this style."
"There are some really tastefully done American Wheats that showcase a citrus/fruity vibe out there, and this is not one of them."
"O - Not my bag, baby. The finish is almost unbearable. Everything else is fine, but I can't stand the way this leaves my mouth."
"Beer is medium to light in body, nothing up front with a mild sweetness on the finish. There is a grainy aftertaste that really takes me out of the beer. I had 500 ml of this (why was this served in 500 ml glasses?) and that was more than enough. I'd have it again if it were the only beer at the party and my alcoholism needed to be fed, otherwise I'd pass."
"Pours just under a two finger head made up of whispy white suds. Unlike other beers where the head is somewhat off-white, summer ale is a soild white. The beer itself is a light straw color with v Some lacingery high levels of carbonation. Champagne levels. The smell is malt dominate with vanilla, lemon, citrus, and a touch of coriander and spice at the finish. The taste is light and refreshing but with a nice citrus and spice note at the end. Overall, I love this beer for summer."
"D - Extremely drinkable. Super crisp and refreshing. The flavors are could use a touch of kick, but they are far from empty and well balanced."
"O- Overall an ok beer but not one I'll be buying again soon."
"A decent, flavoursome wheat ale with nice flavours. It's a little over the top and I'd like a bit less of the lemon and spice."
"O: At first, I didn't care much for this beer. But sip by sip, I enjoyed it more and more. I purchased the summer sampler, and was least excited about this one (and Sam Adams Light), but it's good. I prefer Boulevard, but still, it's a good beer; something different."
" I could see why people would go either way with this beer because on the initial sip you get that crisp lemon wheat beer that people would expect but then ends with that bitter like grains of paradise taste. I really like it and I will drink this beer throughout the whole summer."
"OA: Every year you seem to get something different with this seasonal release, and this year I think Sam's got it right bottle dated with best consumed by August 2011 and it reminds me of their 2006 release."
"D: Outstanding! I can say this brew has plently of complexity and flavor for the beer geek, but wouldn't offend too many macro drinkers either. I am very impressed the BBC has improved the finish from last seasons. The only knock (and this is coming from a light weight, go ahead, send me an e-mail and call me a wussy), is that the ABV may be a tad high for the style. It's just too easy to knock back a few too many of these!"
"O: I have had sam adams summer in the past, and to be honest, it has gotten worse over the years. The 2010 summer batch was lame and the 2011 batch is even worse. I won't be buying any six packs this summer, and I will give away the summers if I buy a 12 pack mix."
"O - Ok so I realise I'm going to be well down on the deviation for this review but this beer is really not that great. It's got a massive hit of lemon which drowns out everything else in pretty much every category. Tastes like someone has taken a decent ale and poured a heap of processed lemon juice into it. Not impressed."
"12oz bottle with a Best Before Date notched at Aug. Pours a slightly hazy, slightly translucent straw yellow with a thin head. Some lacing. Aroma is of lemon peel, spices, bread and slightly floral. Taste is mostly of lemon and grains. A bit bready. Lemon peel aftertaste. Definitely tastes like a wheat beer, but a bit more grainy than I'd like. Somewhat drinkable but I find the wheat and lemon combination a bit too harsh. Overall, its alright but I wouldn't get it on its own."
"D/O: It definitely fits the Summer style well, and is pretty easy to drink once you let the carbonation die down a bit"
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle that expires August 2011. Sampled on April 9, 2011. The pour is a hazy pale yellow-orange combination with a short bursting fizzy white head the goes away quickly. The aroma highlights the lemon zest and grains far beyond anything wheat like. The taste is summer tart with a zing of lemon, black pepper, and a moderate hop note at the end. The wheat taste is downplayed too much."
"This is the quintessential summer beer. The ale has a very smooth ale feeling to it, and does not leave your mouth dry. The flavor has a nice fruit taste without over powering you with too much sweetness. Some places garnish this one with fruit, but I like it as it is. Cheers."
"Overall, this indeed comes off as a good summer beer. To bad I got this off season. I'd say it's worth a try. Good to different varieties of Sam Adams coming to Canada (or at least Western Canada)."
"Notes: you can find much better wheat beers/summer beers out there, use this website as a guide."
"This beer has a lot of very good qualities. Good color, nice citrus smell, very summery. Very drinkable as well. The taste is very unique, you get the wheat, and you get a lot of different fruit and other tastes, you can taste the grains of paradise and all the fruit they mix in. All in all it's not outstanding, but a very good wheat beer non the less, I will get this one again."
"D- Easy to drink, refreshing."
"D - The drinkability is decent. It goes down fairly smooth, and it'd be easy to drink a 6-pack of this in a sitting. Overall, it is a decent beer. It's a beer I'm glad I got the chance to try, but I wouldn't buy it again if I came across it at the store."
"Boston Beer Company--Samuel Adams--Samuel Adams Summer Ale Seasonal Brew--Wheat Ale Brewed With Lemon Zest And Grains Of Paradise--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 5.30% ABV. 10 IBU's? (3.5 / 5.0) Wheat Ale--Spiced. Thin fizzy light lace white head. Light tight sediment. Clear thin bright soft gold color. Tangy lemon pepper mild hop wheat ester front. Crisp zesty dry sweet light thin wheat lemon citrus body. Clean refreshing hot pepper hint mild hop clean citrus end. Aged fizzy. Sampled 1/6/2011. Purchased 6-Pack for $6.99 @ Fred Meyer--Ballard, Seattle on 5/3/2010."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours golden hazy color with a negligible white head. Soda like carbonation. Nose is of lemon, yeast and some malt. Light body, tart and crisp. Flavor is of citrus fruit and sweet malt . Finish is short and dry. Nice, very refreshing beer."
"Did not enjoy this at all. Most went down the drain. The aroma in particular is just repulsive...."
"Drinkability: With a slight aftertaste of lemon and alcohol, this isn't exactly my favorite beer. I want to run to something else to cover up the strong lemon flavor. Probably won't buy again."
"D - Drinkability is low. Tangy, artificial lemon is almost mouth-puckeringly sour, and not in a good way. May be good for a session beer in the summer but I can't see me searching it out again."
"D: I didn't order another. So take what you will from that."
"D - I enjoyed this beer. Picked it up with several other SA's in a build your own deal at a grocery store."
"This beer is more complex than a summer seasonal needs to be. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but it's a pretty bold move to put out a murky, com- plex ale for a summer seasonal while everyone else is lobbing their crystal clear Blonde Ales into the market. Maple-glazed jalapeño turkey burgers with potato salad stood up to this very well."
"D - I would not call this refreshing or drinkable. I give the brewer credit for trying something different than a standard American Wheat style, but I don't care for the heavy-handed, strange combination of spices."
"Not too much citrus, hops just right. Quality, average summer ale, exactly what I'd expect from Samuel Adams, give it a try (might have to wait until next year)"
"Overall, this is a weak showing by Sam Adams, not sure how others rated it a B- or above. Not impressed by the beer at all. In fact, I only had it a second time because my friend got me the drink, I asked for Sam Adams lager, he came back with the Summer crap. I'll wait for the Winter Bock."
"Pours a light golden color with a decent amount of haze and a several finger white head, although this doesn't leave behind much lacing. Nose is a large dose of lemon and a lighter amount of spice. Taste is lemon, light spice, and a bit of wheat. Light body with moderate carbonation, although the spice takes over a bit. Not too much going on with this, and I would prefer it without the extra additions."
"D - Not bad overall but would not be having this one again in the future."
"This is definitely a good brew. It is well balanced, smooth, and pleasant. It has a very refreshing aftertaste."
"Poured a pale yellow straw color. Smelled of lemon zest, hops, and orange peels with peppers. Tasted quite spicy (which did not really do anything for me) hoppy, and all around kindy nasty. Mouthfeel was fairly average with some crisp carbonation to it. Fairly drinkable, not a bad summer choice -- far better than some I have had."
"Overall, this is not a bad effort from Sam Adams, although I do prefer their marzen and winter lager by leaps and bounds over this one. I'm not the biggest fan of wheat beers, and so I am a little underwhelmed by this offering; however, I can see the SA Summer as a legitimate, easy-going tailgate beer for fans of this style."
"Appearance is a hazy golden yellow with a head that dissapates quickly leaving no head. Smell has a light nose of sweet malt. Taste has an interesting light cream soda sweetness followed by a light hop that has good balance with the malt. Mouthfeel is medium with good body and carbonation. Overall its a easy going non complex summer ale."
"Overall, not the beer I have wonderful memories of but that's probably not because the recipe has changed. I see the changes more within myself."
"Drinks good, pretty average summer beer. I wasn't very impressed with this one."
"I've never had a Sam Adams beer that tasted bad and this Summer Ale keeps the record going. Summer Ale pours a golden yellow with a decent head of foam that has some longevity to it. Definetly can taste the wheat in it. It has a deep rich taste to it that makes it not weak but yet not to stong. Very tasty on a warm summer day."
"Very yellow fizzy looking with a soft white head that recedes quickly with no lacing. The bubbles are streaming from the bottom of the glass and the beer fizzes like lemon lime soda. There are aromas of bitter orange and lemon peel, corriander spice and some grassy aromas. Flavors are similar to the aroma but its got a real astrigent flavor that puckers the palate. The lemon is much more predominant this year and the flavor profile has been watered down from what i can remember. Mouthfeel is astrignent and light, but very refreshing. Artificial sweetness cloys and makes this somewhat hard to put down after it warms too much. Drink cold and enjoy!"
"EDIT: After having this prior to anything else today, as opposed to after a few others previously, The true awfulness came through! Nearly couldn't finish it. Looks ok, and tastes awful, average body, undrinkable."
"Drinkability: Pretty poor taste, not something I'd want again."
"For a summer style beer this pours with a surprisingly opaque-ness quality. Very little aroma as is expected with such a light beer. A nice smooth mouthfeel. The finish has notes of vanilla and honey. Possibly the perfect beer to make 'shandies' with. Best enjoyed on a sunny back deck."
"D-easy drinker, and has a quenching quality also, making it a good inexpensive summer session ale, as far as mass craft goes."
"d - A decent, easy to drink beer by Sam Adams. Not my favorite seasonal from them, but a decent beer to get when out to eat. Would never seek out but will drink again at some point."
"Decent looking beer and was in the mood for a lighter summer quaffer. Average head with no lacing. Smelled very citrusy but almost like a cough drop. Tasted also like a cough drop and not a good one. Really bummed on this one as I continually want to like Sam Adams and try their offerings but I think I am done after this one. So many better options for the price it's not even close any more. A bummer and I want my money back. Surprised really, that SA put this into a seasonal. If I brewed this I would not share it with anyone."
"WOW this beer is a train wreck IMO. I had to buy the 6er (Ontario only sells 6, 12 and 24. Unless otherwise noted) and this thankfully was my last. I wanted to give it a chance. I wanted to like it. I haven't had a bad SA yet. But my god this was an abomination... I feel like I should scrub my mouth out with a dirty toilet brush to get the taste out..."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. Clear straw color with a filmy white head. Wheaty aroma with a slight lemony tinge and an even slighter hint of unripe stone fruit. Flavor is grainy and wheaty with minor notes of peach pit and mineral water. Watery but smoother than most crap-ass American wheats. Not quite crisp enough if I'm looking purely for refreshment."
"Libation: I like the beverage, but it seems a bit too muted and made for the mass market. Better than most macros by far, but there are better wheat ales available."
"Pours a nice cloudy golden yellow color with a finger of white foam. The smells are faint which for the flavor of this beer is rather odd. What I do smell however are citrus smells of lemon and orange zest as well as a pepper note to follow. The initial sip hits the tongue and oddly reminds of a dreamsicle which is pleasant but definitely unexpected. This is due to the creaminess of the body of the beer along with the strong citrus flavor. The more I drink it the more I realize how intense the flavors are, and there are a lot of flavors in here. The wheat flavor is almost lost to it. It almost seems like I'm drinking a beer that has had an entire fruit salad steeped in it. The mouthfeel is quite nice, as I previously stated it is creamy in nature. The beer is quite drinkable for a fresh summery beer. Recommended if on a budget during the summer."
"D - a very very good beer to cook out with when the thermometer goes up. the tart spice enhances meat flavors rather than mutes them. also great on its own to just sit in the sun and relax"
"Not my favorite and the last time I will buy it, it is to light, and to citrusy, it taste funny."
"D - This beer is very easy to drink. Goes down easy and smooth."
"Decided on a whim to have this with lunch today. God what a mistake. Suffice to say there was no lacing, and it tasted like lemon grass and pepper. I admire Sam Adams for what they have done for the craft beer industry, but lament them for their lack of imagination with beers. Their only TRULY good beers are that bullshit marketing ""Imperial"" series that come in over priced 4 packs. Those are actually good beers. The rest of their line-up is soulless and an embarrassment to craft beer."
"Hazy yellow appearance in my pint glass with little head, but good retention. Not much on the nose, but a good lemony wheat taste to this one. Definitely one of the more citrus-heavy wheat beers I've ever had, and yet done so tactfully--still tastes very much like a beer, which is more than I can say for some overly citrused wheats. Sorta boring and not overly impressive in any way, but it sure is refreshing. A situational beer for sure--perfect on the beach or with the right dinner. Loved it with my chicken dish. Not sure its worth the hype that surrounds it in the Boston area, but definitely one of my most ordered dinner accompaniments. Good stuff."
"Taste isn't much better than the nose. It's also medicinal and all sorths of weird flavors I'm not Shure what's going on here but it isn't good."
"D- A pretty drinkable and tasty beer. Not my favorite from Sam Adams, but it is often the best option in summer at less beer-centric establishments."
"This isn't a hard beer to drink by any stretch of the imagination. Sam Adams is renowned for making very approachable beers and the Summer Ale is no different. I just wish there was more character to it than simply some sourness and malts. I think I'll stick to hefeweizens for my wheat beer cravings."
"Very drinkable & good for summer."
"Aroma and taste is nice, has a bit of sweet lemon and hops that combine nicely, not too bitter. Highly drinkable, it isn't much more filling than a lager but has more flavor. I definitely recommend this beer if you can find it."
"Not a bad seasonal."
"Recommended."
"Notes: The spices and lemon zest are a little too unbalanced to me. An interesting beer and it does have some refreshing abilities for a summer day, it just seems a little too off balance to me."
"Pretty drinkable, but the bitterness does build a bit, though. Unlike the somewhat similar Trashy Blonde, though, you can have a few of these and not have your tongue destroyed by bitterness."
"D- Not my favourite Sam Adams. I was disappointed. I probably will not buy this again."
"Drinking straight from the bottle, the first thing I tasted was a chemical lemon flavor, upon finishing and stepping on my back portch I smell citronella, which smelled exactly like the lemon taste in this beer. On the bright side it was smooth and not to strong to be unbearable. In a world of great summer ales there is no need to try this again."
"Tasty, reliable summer brew. I feel like I have either liked this better in year's past or have just tasted better summers. Tasty, but not refreshing, and gets a little heavy after a while."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer."
"Very drinkable--can drink this all day and all night. Very high marks--maybe my favorite summer beer."
"Easy going and sessionable, but nothing game changing about it. Good, but I've had better."
"Nice Head, almost three fingers, with some lasting power. Good lacing that clings to the side of the glass like glue, good and thick. Not bad color for a light ale, a 6 on the SRM chart. Good trace of wheat, but not overpowering. More of a smell of wheat in the field, not the barn. Lots of carbonation that tingles the tongue as I retain it in my mouth, just a little more than I like. Very little after taste, but what there is...is pleasing. Much better than the other wheat ale's I have tasted. Still a little pricey, I would splurge for those who like wheat ale. I would not turn this beer down if someone gave me one."
"I expect a lot from sam adams. With summer ale, i was not fully satisfied. The original citrus taste is satisfying, but i hate the bitter aftertaste. A slight bitterness is perfect among beers, but summer ale slightly overdoes itself. Is it too harsh to finish a six pack on a hot day? No. Is it better than a Corona? Yes. But is it the beer that I would prefer to be drinking? No."
"Taste was similar -- not much desirable going on here. Nothing bad, just nothing of note. The two bottles I drank were very fizzy but light bodied. Not a beer that made me want to drink more; I had two but only because it was the only beer available."
"It's still highly drinkable and quenches your thirst. Had this over the weekend for free at a charity event and was happy to drink 3 or so glasses nonetheless."
"Ok, well I've seen most reviews out and about giving this ale an average of a B-.. This is not acceptable! This ale achieves a great complexity of taste and yet such simplicity in drinkability that I do not understand why this ale is rated a somewhat above average B-! Summer Ales are meant to be drinkable, but with this much flavor?? Wow! Where to start? Ill Opt to not.. This is a great Ale! Enjoy the grains of paradise!!"
"It poured a golden straw wheat yellow, slightly cloudy with barely any head. It smells of yeast, citrus, and coriander and smells pretty good. It tastes of light yeast with the citrus, perhaps orange peel, coming through. It's slightly sweet and tastes pretty solid, definitely better out of a bottle than on tap. The mouthfeel is just ok. It's very light with just slight carbonation. It's extremely drinkable, being both tasty and light. It's something worth drinking if on funds are tight. It's probably my favorite Sam Adams brew after the Boston Lager."
"D: so much better than the bottle I had!"
"(you can float a cap on water.)"
"Pours a cloudy golden pale colour, little head no lacing present on the glass. Smells strong of citrus and yeast, that was pretty much all that was going on in the aroma department for this one. Lots of green apple and bready sweet malt in this. Medium to light in the mouth, not terrible but lots to be desired here. I could drink one of these but thats about it. By far not my favorite from Sam Adams. Glad to have tried it though."
"Overall good beer. Good go to beer if looking for a summer style."
"All in all an above average pale wheat. Nothing more."
"Pours an extremely cloudy golden color with a big white head. Aromas of wheat, citrus fruits, meat (smokiness), and spices. The taste is initially full of flavor. Lots of meat and spices...very delicious. The mouthfeel is awesome, and the drinkability is high."
"D- Good, easy light tasting, good drinker."
"D - Solid summer beer, very crisp and refreshing. Could have a few of these on a hot afternoon."
"Rather aggressive pour into a hefeweizen glass for nice three-finger head with heavy lacing remaining and a translucent golden body; the classical image of ""beer."" Not as textured or wheaty as on-tap, but still refreshing. Very light citrus notes, not bitter at all. Taste (primarily of cereal grains) is subdued for good sessionability and drinkability; this beer is unassuming and straightforward. Fans of German lager and wheat beers will appreciate this domestic standby, though it's priced appropriately as a quality beer."
"--MB"
"Despite Boston Beer Company's refusal to can any of their beers. This would be a good candidate for such portability. Take this one outside and pour into a glass."
"D: It's refreshing and it's light, I'll give it that. Goes real well with sandwiches and warm days."
"Summer is always better with Samuel Adams Summer Ale."
"The beer poured a very nice pale gold color; with a 2"" white head that quickly lay down to a thin lace around the edge of the glass. It has a light aroma of lemon and wheat. The taste is very crisp and refreshing, with a little hint of lemon followed by wheat. I think it is very drinkable and is one of my favorite summer seasonal."
"D - fantastic summer drink, very easy drinking and refreshing with enough interesting flavours to keep my attention"
"D - I can see the carbonation holding the drinkability back a bit but this is really refreshing for a summer day. The lemon zest is a nice touch for a summer ale."
"I enjoyed this beer served on draft in an Imperial Pint glass. (Not a Sam Adams glass.) Bright yellow straw color with an abundance of sticky lacey head. Smell of oats and bread like notes. Taste had plenty of yeast, biscuit like flavors, also some spices as pepper and faint ginger. Mouthfeel was a bit dry. Drinkability certainly easy and laid back for the summer, easy to sip, chug with some BBQ or a steak on the grill and reach for another."
"M/D: Medium body and lower carbonation. Tons of bitterness is clinging to the palate. With a summer beer, I'd expect fresh, diverse flavors and high drinkability. The intense and undefinable bitterness really kills the ""summer"" ease with which a beer like this should be enjoyed."
"(There's 1200 other reviews for this beer - is someone really reading this???)"
"Straw gold with a thin, poorly retained head. No lace. Soapy lemon aroma with a hint of vanilla. It's pleasant lemon flavour is marred by that same soapy character in its aroma. Mild unpleasant aftertaste reminds me of tylenol. Light, spritzy, and quenching. The fact it tastes like it's meant for washing away sweat and dirt instead of washing down a meal detracts from it's drinkability."
"Very drinkable...an awesome summer quencher here!"
"A simple wheat ale, nothing particularly remarkable, despite the pseudo-exotic guest spice ingredient. However, given my 'predicament' right now, this came off as pretty thirst quenching, and a worthy kick-off to wandering back out into the pavement-enhanced sunshine."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and has some good substance to it. Drinkability is good. Refreshing, no overpowering tastes, a solid warm weather staple."
"D: I've had this one in the past and remember it being a lot better. This one was pulled out of the summer selection. The draft version is better."
"Looks good and has a summer appearance label on the bottle. Smells of lemon and spices. Has little head. Taste is above average but not the best. The lemony flavor makes this beer taste great, so mouthful has the same rating as taste. Drinkability is excellent not the best, but very close. This is a beer one could drink all day. Goes down smooth and refreshing."
"Pretty drinkable, but nothing to write home about. Pretty much middle of the road for a summertime beer."
"Smells somewhat wheaty, with a little lemon in there and some odd spices I can't put my finger on. Taste is not for me, I usually like summers but this is a little heavier, and definitely has a heavy lemon tinge. Eh"
"I'm not a huge wheat fan, but found this one pretty drinkable even with its large lemony flavor."
"as my sam adams key chain bottle opener would annotate i am a fan of the Boston Beer Company but that being said this beer is not one of my favorites by them."
"Clear gold with a fine cap of white foam, good head retention, a bit of sticky lace, mostly sheets. The initial aroma after the pour was very nice, but it lost some of its punch fairly quick. Nice orange blossom and spice up front, fading to a crackery malt aroma. More orange and lemon citrus in the flavour, light bitterness, faint spiciness with sort of a soapy character. Light bodied with some dryness, moderate carbonation, a bit crisp. Pretty refreshing and nicely balanced."
"I am a little disappointed in this beer. I have always enjoyed Sam Adams lagers but this one did not meet my standards to their other beers."
"Overall the scent was more like a clean pils with lots of citrus and zip. The flavor is definitely that of a soft wheat ale that bathes the tongue is down feather-like softness. It all balances out into a nonintrusive, pleasant, easy to drink and enjoyable summer beer. A little bland, so it's more of a quencher than a 'ponderer'. I'll order it on tap on hot nights at pedestrian-type restaurants when I see this summer."
"Cloudy golden color with some orange hues. Small head, even with a hard pour. Smells interesting with the spices and a healthy dose of lemon. Tastes decent but is a little over spiced for my liking. Mild wheat flavor and lemon zest add a somewhat refreshing aspect. Fluid mouthfeel with ample carbonation. A good beer for a hot day, but the dominate flavors wear on the palate after a few."
"standard pale wheat beer look, with substandard head and lacing - no torrified wheat? smell nicely peppery and citrusy, but disturbingly chemical and soapy. taste is clementines and bleachy solvents. almost unspeakable. i sincerely hope there is merely something wrong with the glass than with the beer, but a quick chat with the bartender, who has overseen innummeable kegs of this stuff pass through the draught line in the last two months, and another sample confirms my worst suspicions. african spices be damned. hideous."
"D. Drinkability is pretty good. It is a good summer beer but the faint sour aftertaste would prevent me from having too many."
"Overall a pretty good beer that's especially easy to drink and perfect for summer. Who woulda thought?"
"Samuel Adams Summer Ale is a very decent beer for the summer season. This beer has a nice yellowish tint to it, good head. The smell definitely can make you think of summer. It is easy to smell the citrusy flavors. The taste is good in this beer, good flavor with the citrus and wheat. There is a slight bitterness to the taste that may turn some off. Not my favorite Sam Adams beer, but a good one."
"Drinkability? A summer thirst quencher if there ever was one. I'll be picking up more of this beauty, no worries."
"The perfect cure for a summer heat wave. Bought a case the other week. Pours a hazy copper yellow. Nice white head that lingers slightly. Smells of wheat and a lemon citrus character. Hops are evident but tucked away in the background. Tastes of the same vein in that lemon & wheat dominate. Does have a slight puckering but the carbonation gently displays the flavors. This one is an extremely drinkable ale in the prime of summer. Not sure how it would hold up in other months but it's a really good BBQ brew."
"The ale arrived a cloudy golden-yellow color with a small white-head. Spicy aroma with some sweet malt - not much more. The flavor was refreshing and slightly sharp on the tongue due to the additional spices and orange added. The taste ended with a husky wheat flavor. The carbonation was adequate and the body was light but flavorful. It would be easy to have a few of these during the hot and humid summer months."
"D - Simple, refreshing beer good for summertime drinking. This beer paired well with the blue crabs I was feasting on, and I would probably get it again."
"Drink: The ""off"" spiciness just gets worse as I work down the glass."
"although this beer lacks that clean, crisp bite one might expect... I did find it fairly drinkable. this is a good little wheat ale to throw back on a summer night while enjoying a pizza"
"Way too much lemon flavoring, I don't think this could be real lemon unless they put 1 lemon per 12 ounces in. The lemon hides any flavor of the beer, you can catch a little hop bitterness in the after taste, but I think they need to dial the lemon back, a lot. Maybe I am being too harsh, but that is what I am tasting at this moment. I will come back for a re-review if I feel differently at another time, but right now I am not feeling this beer. Good beer for parties and cookouts though because alot of people like it. Along the lines of bud light."
"It's good. Definitely way better than the bottled version or they've improved from previous years."
"I typically like Sam Adams' product (and I've enjoyed this one in the past), but--and maybe this is just the particular bottle I had this time around--I wasn't a big fan of the Summer Ale. I shouldn't say avoid (and you probably shouldn't listen to me anyway), but if I were you, reach for a different SA than their Summer Ale."
"Sam Summer arrives at my table a slightly hazy pale yellow with a bright white, lacy head. Very attractive and refreshing looking. The aroma is crisp and clean with some sweet wheat malt and a bit of graininess as well as some sour citrus bite. The flavor is very similar with a very grainy malt base that also carries some wheat notes. Citrus zest and some spicy pepperyness are also present, but everything is pretty subdued. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium and has a nice smoothness to it and a clean finish. Not overly carbonated and very refreshing, this beer goes down easily. A decent summer beer to be sure, but I find it lacking a bit in the flavor department. There are definitely better American wheat beers to be had, but none are as widely available as this one."
"Thumbs down."
"Medium bodied with a fairly mild case of the bubbles. A good summer brew that is easy drinking, mild on the brain and pretty refreshing."
"D: This is a good summer beer, as well as a good ""beginner"" beer. True to style, but not great. I would like a little more hop or yeast character. I would have no problem pulling one of these out of the cooler at a picnic, but I would not search one out."
"M/D: Pretty easy to drink, good beer; drinkable of course."
"Cheers!"
"D - Perfect summer drink! Nothing that will completely blown your mind with respect to flavour, but it does offer the unique flavours from the grains of paradise, and the lemon makes it incredibly refreshing. Easily sessionable and perfect for chillin' on your patio in the sun."
"Golden, slightly hazy with the typical ester-esque aroma found in wheat beers. No head. Hard to descrbe. Slightly grainy front, middle, and finish. Medium mouthfeel. Very light hopping with a crisp/citrusy middle. A passable version of a light summer beer. A good lawn mower beer, but not much more."
"Yellow hue, clear close up but cloudy at a distance. Light lemony aroma with a decent head and strong carbonation. There is a clear second flavor above and beyond the classic wheat beer taste. If you can get through the idiosyncratic taste, you'll enjoy another."
"Good as a summer quencher, but not really interesting enough to be sessionable."
"All told, this definitely isn't my favorite in the variety pack. It definitely sits above the light lager, though it just about ties their regular lager. It is ok for a summer beer, although I think that the chalky/creamy aspect to its taste really detracts from its draw as a refreshing beer of the summer."
"Light body and a crisp mouthfeel. Pretty nicely balanced beer -- just a bit sweet and just a bit bitter. I found this beer a bit disappointing, I remember past years being a little better than this one. Overall I would rate it less drinkable than many other summer seasonals I've tried this year."
"Bottom line- Good not great. Nothing here that will draw me to drink this one anytime soon unless it is screaming hot and there is no other good choices. It is what it is but it is kind of disappointing for a seasonal. Good baby step or training wheel beer but nothing more. So all in all don't turn it down but if you have other options lean that way"
"I don't know if my tastes have changed or the beer has but I seem to remember the last time I tried this being more pleasantly surprised by the grains of paradise and other spices. This time around it seems very subdued and more lemony. Too bad."
"I wanted the Latitude 48, so I had to get the whole Summer Styles box. Oh well, I guess I'll suck it up and drink the extraneous bottles. Tee hee. This one pours a clear pale golden straw topped by a half-finger of white micro-foam. The nose comprises lemon zest and a very light bit o' wheat. Uncomplicated, yet still pretty nice. The taste holds quite a bit of cardamom, along with a bit o' coriander and some light grains. Too much spicy flavors, not enough of the grains. Something like that. The body is light, with with moderate carbonation and a crisp, refreshing finish. Overall, a decent lemonade-style brew, but nothing great."
"D: Very drinkable, especially on the aforementioned hot summer day, but not something I'm going to go out of my way to have again. This sort of beer isn't going to push any new ground, but it's a solid, well-made beer that definitely quenches your thirst."
"All in all, a fairly decent take on the style. I wouldn't turn it away if I was offered another. Not exactly worth seeking out, but definitely worth a try if the opportunity presents itself."
"Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with an average amount of carbonation. This is very crisp and refreshing, and goes great after a hot day. Not a great or overly impressive beer, but a decent brew, especially on hot days."
"Final Notes: A nice refreshing brew on a hot day. Great for parties and backyard barbecues."
"Pours a hazy bright yellow, like the sun piercing a fog. Has a nice white head that settles to collar. Aromas of wheat and lemon zest. Taste is big on the malts, light on the yeastiness, and balanced by a lemon bitterness. Finishes sweet. A very enjoyable summer brew."
"D: Enjoyable and flavorful. A little too sweet to really throw them back."
"overall, i like it. similar to a yuengling to be honest. i am fond of these lighter ales, so this is one that i will deffinately pick up again. i recommend for a sunny day."
"The mouthfeel is decent and it is drinkable. I didn't order a second one though."
"D: Drinkable enough for a hot summer day to cool off."
"Served from bottle into Samuel Smith imperial pint. Pours a hazy golden yellow with one finger white head that subsides to minimal. There was no apparent lacing present. The aroma was comprised of citrus and wheat. The flavor was of wheat with a lemon followthrough. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was not a bad brew, not great however. It was nicely drinkable as a lawnmower brew, but it needs more flavor and aroma to be great."
"Had this beer years ago when it available in BC liqour stores but the one I picked up in Oak Harbour was fresher and full of citrus notes than the ones I remember. Nice combination of a golden ale , wheat beer and saison in a sessionable 12 oz bottle. I wish we could get this in BC again as I would keep a sixer in the fridge for those hot day and warma nights to come"
"Beer was fairly drinkable, but there are better Sam Adams brews for me. This beer didn't really seem too ""summer-y or lemon-y"" and I can think of better things to drink in the heat. However, it is better than adjucts and their partners like Shock Top and Blue Moon, and certainly better than other Sam Adams wheat beers."
"A decent seasonal from Sam Adams. Not one of my favorites but I'll always end up having at least a few of these every summer."
"ETA2: This beer has grown on me some, it's pretty decent and I do wind up buying a sixer of it every now and then. I like the body most of all, along with the flavor, which is quite tasty."
"Drinkability - it was a little too far on the creamy side for me, so I gave it just an average drinkability. Not a bad beer, but also not one I would likely go back for again."
"Sam Adams hit it out of the park with their Noble Pils, their spring seasonal beer. This wheat, the summer seasonal, is just average, a decent beer for a summer picnic or whatever but Uncle Sam really should just distribute their Noble Pils over the summer, it's so superior to this brew."
"High carbonation, but not at all refreshing."
"I've decided to try this beer again in the future to rule out that my beer was somehow adulterated as I expected better from Samuel Adams."
"D-This is a knock 'em back summer brew. Nothing amazing, nothing special, just a decent solid summer thirst quencher for a session by the pool. I'd be pretty bored after a few of these, but this may just be the ticket for a BBQ beer that might have widespread appeal."
"A little simpleminded in all the lemon character, partly reminding more of lemon soda than beer."
"Sam Adams knows what they're doing, but that doesn't give them an automatic A. The color was a nice summer ale yellow, with a noticeable citrus flavor. Overall, I described it somewhere between decent and okay. It was my first beer of the night, and I decided to try other things afterward."
"Poured a clear golden yellow with about a half inch white head. Smells like malt and lemon with a touch of hops. Tastes about the same. Lemon and malt and hops. Carbonation is about right. These are nice in the evening after a long. walk. Nothing spectacular, but a good solid beer."
"D: This was a decent light summer beer that was easy to drink, but not really recommended. The hops dominate but don't add the best flavor, and the body is too fizzy for my taste."
"I'm not trusting an airport to serve a pint in good condition. Nevertheless, this one came out thin and sour, like a bad Summer Lightning, with no sign of the spice."
"Sam Summer Ale is an easy drinking, no frills kinda beer that appeals to the masses. I find this beer to be really non offensive but at the same time there is nothing to keep me interest in it at all. With that said I'll be reaching for something else this summer."
"D- very drinkable for the summer months of the year. Not a whole lot can beat sitting on the deck BSing with the boys and having a 12 pack of this by your side. If you're just going to be alone though...meh"
"When I had this before, I distinctly remember the character of the grains of paradise being totally dominating in both the flavor and aroma. The lemon character was slim to none but it was there. I don't know if that was from a previous recipe or maybe that has to do with the freshness. Regardless it was an interesting example of the style."
"Overall an OK beer to be had, very drinkable, but there are better wheat ales / witbiers out there."
"D - all-in-all not bad, very refreshing. the lemon can be overwhelming after a bit especially with nothing besides wheaty sweetness to balance it."
"Over all this is a very nice round summer beer to be enjoyed outdoors. Maybe even with a little grilling going on."
"D: There are some nice elements in there, but it doesn't come together as a drinkable whole for me. I enjoyed the one I had, but I couldn't see reaching for another."
"Drinkability: I've had this before this year (about a month ago) and thought it was pretty good, so I also wonder if the flavor gets lost as it warms up and ages from its original brew date. Went okay with a burger and fries, but in the summer, with a beer that will warm up fast, I think the flavor should be more balanced through a wider temperature range. Sure you could chug it cold, but then what is there to enjoy taste wise. I can't see myself getting this again. After having it again from another batch (best by 11/2010) it's not getting any better and I think I like it even less - it does not age well."
"This beer really built me up with its looks and smell, but could not really deliver on what counts."
"Drinkability- I really enjoyed it. I love lemons so I loved the lemony flavor. Great for a hot day."
"Light beer good to drink on a hot night."
"Drinkability - I like it compared to the other summer ales i have had. A good beer to bring to the lake."
"Overall, this wasn't a bad beer. I liked what the beer put on the table, I just wish it had a bit more 'oomph' behind it in certain spots. Still, another tasty one from Sam Adams. If I see it on tap again at local restaurants, I'll probably go for it again. Still beats the hell out of most things they offer on draft at big chain restaurants."
"D: This is definitely drinkable, and refreshing. I threw back 4 of these and did not feel weighted down at all. That being said, it did't particularly strike me as memorable. A good ""safe"" beer widely available on tap when you're out and want something light and inoffensive."
"A refreshing beer for a hot day, for sure. Doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table, but then that's not the point, is it?"
"Texture: This is where it got me. Drinking a swig of this Summer Ale is like drinking beer flavored heavy cream. It's very thick on the tongue and seems cohesive when you swallow. Very strange."
"EDIT- After reading the Bros review in this months BA, I'd argue that this beer is mis-classified, the above review based on the APWA category. Given the Belgian take on this 'hybrid' style, the taste profile makes sense, but I'll still pass next time."
"D: I can't say I'm a big fan of this one. It seems like it's trying to be a lighter version of their Winter Lager, but it lacks the great spicy flavor and crisp finish that I love from the Winter Lager. The soapy flavor that I tasted turns me off, and I think there are many more attractive options for a refreshing summer session beer."
"M/D: Lighter body, lots of zippy carbonation bubbles. Very average. Drinkability is okay, if it was a hot day in the sun this would be better, but I had this at night on a rooftop deck."
"D- the beer is drinkable, no doubt about it. The hype on the brew overall is not for me. You can put these down, no problem. I just think there are some other seasonals out there that embrace the season."
"Pale-yellow liquid poured into SA glass, retains thin white foam head. All citrus orange and lemon aromas. Carbonated tingle and medium body gives way to pleasant wheat and orange aftertaste. Smooth and refreshing on a hot summer day or while tending the grill. Can certainly tip back a few and have room for the ribs."
"D- Alright drinkability. Not the best summer ale out there but then again this is the one most places have on tap. This is not one of my favorite beers from BBC but I feel it's made for more of the BMC crowd."
"D: This is a nice summer ale. Very refreshing, but the tang and citrus is a little bit too strong to make it a session beer."
"T: It has a wet citrus flavor. The lemon is still the main event on this one. A little subdued from the aroma. This makes me think of great beer to have after mowing the lawn in 90 degree heat. I once thought this was a decent beer, but after sitting down and reviewing it there isn't too much to it."
"Slainte."
"It would be easy to drink a few of these if your taste buds were blasted by chile peppers or something like Ruination. After extreme palate fatigue this might be pretty good."
"Drinkability - fairly easy but with so many better choices out there, I would steer clear."
"I am glad to see that this is back on the shelves. I'm not a huge fan of wheat type beers or beers with fruit or spices added, but for some reason this stuff works for me. Pours a hazy, cloudy, almost dirty looking golden amber. Not much to look at. Smell is fruity and grainy. grainy wheat up front with a little clove, some spicy pepper flavors. Bitter hop flavors are there, but way in the background. A sharp, very noticable smack of lemon in the finish. I think this is what pulls it all together and makes it refreshing and very drinkable. What can I say? Based on other beers that are similar, I shouldn't like this but I do. Maybe I'm just glad it's almost Memorial Day."
"Pours a nice pale gold color with some frothy white head. Scent is of musty wheat with hints of citrus and spice. The taste is much fresher than the scent with a nice clean lemon taste and spice to it - all backed by a clean pale wheat charachter. Medium bodied, some grainyness to it. A nice, refreshing summer brew - the grains of paradise give it just enough uniqueness and charachter."
"Carbonation is acceptable, but I'd prefer a bit more... The body is a tad heavy for me to really consider this refreshing summer beer... It isn't bad, but I'll stick with Oberon."
"D- It's pretty refreshing initially. The added zest and spice kind of overwhelm the flavor. While it doesn't seem artificial, it's just a bit too much. It might be an easier drinker when served at very cold temperatures. Mine wasn't ""ice cold"" to begin with. I'd definitely drink it during the summer months when a tap list is kind of on the short side, but I'm not going to seek it out."
"Well, it's citrussy and it goes down remarkably quickly, so chock this one up as a decent summer thirst quencher, though in typical Ontario fashion its quite pricy (over $13 for the sixpack). Still, it'll work for the weekend ahead."
"Drinkability - This would be, of course, easily drinkable during the hot days of summer. I just couldn't get over the smell!!!"
"sort of yellowish with a fluffy white head. Taste is intensely of wheat with a bit of a honey finish. smell is kind of fragrant of spices behind the smell of the wheat and hops. Kind of light bodied and crisp for the summer months. Light enough to drink 2 or more."
"The introduction of spice is interesting. Fairly thirst quenching and smooth. Overall, though, it is just a fairly average beer. Still a decent choice when in the sun."
"D - For something I'm assuming should be sessionable, this is not. IT tastes too bad, with it's overly lemoned flavoring and skunkness."
"Cheers!"
"Very easy drinking, refreshing summer brew."
"Nice creamy mouthfeel and very drinkable. It is a summer ale, but not my favorite style."
"I don't buy this very often, but I always really like it when I do. Another solid Sam Adams offering."
"D - There are a lot of bad beers in the style, but this one is really horrid."
"D. Do you like drinking urine?"
"The finish is crisp and clean. This would be a great beer to quench your thirst after mowing the lawn."
"D: A real easy drinking beer that does work quite well for the warm weather. I wouldn't mind having one of these on a hot day outside."
"Overall not a bad beer but I can think of better for the style and price range."
"D: I wouldn't go in search of this on a nice summer day, but I wouldn't shy away from it either."
"D- Didn't have that crisp, refreshing feel I was expecting from a summer ale. Left me wanting, similar to the Coastal Wheat Ale."
"I really enjoyed this one from SA. I tend to like their seasonal brews and I was able to appreciate this one too. There's a reason they brew this one during the summer. It pairs well with a hot summer night. This was also the first beer I had on my 21st birthday, so it will be remembered. I would pick this one up again, even now that summer is relatively close."
"Notes - A fairly nondescript American wheat ale. You can definitely do worse, but there's much better wheat beers out there."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"I remember that I enjoyed this beer a lot more this year than I did last. My tastes and knowledge for beer have grown exponentially since then. In the end I wouldnt buy this beer but I will totally be drinking most of Jimmy V's stock."
"M: not as carbonated as other beers of this style, which i like. medium body seems a little heavy for drinking outside on a hot and humid day in arkansas. finishes crisp and dry"
"D: It's not bad, and would make a decent summer-drinker. But it's not my favorite SA beer, not by a long shot."
"D- High marks for drinkability. I like the choice of spices in this, I like the dry citrus zest finish, but it's watery complexion is a bit off putting. Still, I could drink a lot of this and it's light character makes it a little too easy to put back. I already want another one."
"D- this is something i can see myself drinking outside in the summer quite often."
"I don't find this beer particularly refreshing. The beer had high carbonation, but a very wet mouthfeel. Sorry, but I've had much better examples of this style."
"Smells of lemon, light grain, and that white peppery citrus grains of paradise smell. Good stuff. Taste is similarly lemon citrus with light grain. Crisp and ridiculously refreshing, the hotter the day the better this beer is. Today it was pretty good."
"I can tell you with certainty that Samuel Adams Summer Ale (or Sam Summer) is VERY popular in Boston, especially amongst my Medford friends. It is certainly a good looking beer: hazy gold in color, with a large pillow like white head. Citrus and wheat are what I am getting mainly from the nose. Very bright in places, the grains of paradise add a nice element overall. Taste is not quite as impressive, with a lot of that wheat and fruit flavor getting lost in the carbonation. That being said, the finish is really pleasing: very well rounded and showcasing the sweetness of the wheat. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and perfect for a hot day like today. Putting back a few of these has never been a problem for me, especially in a barbecue setting. In the past, I have dumped on this beer a bit, but right now I have to say that I am enjoying it a lot. It begs for a good food pairing...burgers sound perfect."
"I would not call this one of my top beers of choice just because of my preferences but still a good drink."
"Drinkability is very high here, these go down very smooth and easy..great summer brew!"
"Consider this a positive review."
"D-Really easy drinking with some nice things going on. I don't know that I would buy a sixer or a 12 pack of it, but if someone handed me one, I wouldn't refuse it."
"D: another easy very drinkable, would also be good to steam some shrimp in maybe"
"Pours a pale foggy amber color with a small head that lasts for a little while but doesnt leave much lacing. The smell is strong with a combination of grain and lemon zest with a little bit of malt. Reminds me a little of sam adams light. The taste is very light, it has a strong grainy presence with a lot of lemon and a very tangy feel to it. The tanginess remindes me of dogfish head festina peche. Pretty flavorful for how light it is, but it still has too much of a grainy taste to it that I dont like. Pretty refreshing but overall an average beer."
"Personally, buying a single of Samuel Adams' Summer Ale to try it out is fine (I paid about $1.67), but I' m not going near a case."
"Drinkability: This is really a poor melange of flavor. I think it was brewed with the intention of adding some complexity to the pale wheat ale category, but it just did not end up well. The soapiness was particularly off-putting, and the full body causes it to drag."
"Overall: Attractive, crisp, and refreshing summer beer. The overall flavor mixture could use some work though."
"Major disappointment from what's usually a fantastic brewer."
"Drinkability: For a summer time beer and easy drinking this beer fits the bill quite nicely. I could see having a second and I'd certainly not turn down one in the future if offered. It certainly was a reasonable choice to accompany the dinner salad I was having. One other nice thing about this beer is that my wife, who isn't a big fan of beer, enjoyed a few sips as well."
"Pours a foggy golden yellow. Creamy white head patches to the sides of the glass in clumps. Smell is perfumy, it almost seems like lemons and plums(?) are duking it out to see who is dominant. First taste was surprisingly sour, with a strange carbonated wallop of grapefruit at the end. The wheat doesn't have near enough body to support the other flavors. Astringent finish, not good at all. I am disappointed because I really enjoyed this release a few years ago, now it doesn't even taste like the same beer. Odd, because this happened to me with SA's winter lager as well."
"Definitely drinkable, I bought a twelve-pack because it went so well with my chicken and pasta. I like what Sam Adams is trying to do here. Sam Adams is getting so big, however, that there seems to be an unwarranted bias against their offerings. This is a good beer. Different and not overdone."
"Taste-Wheat, lots of lemon zest, peppery spiciness. First few gulps were refreshing and tangy, but overall taste became increasingly infused with lemon, leaving a bitter lemon-rind aftertaste. A bit too unbalanced to make a good summer session beer."
"Definitely drinkable, I would choose other wheat ales over this one, but hey, it was free due to me and my teammate's badass drinking game ownage...go team rock wall!"
"d-great drinkability not to heavy, clean taste, good for those warm summer days"
"d-more than drinkable....this beer was made for a hot summer afternoon by a pool or with yard work."
"had on tap and was a slight hazy yellow wheat color..the smell was lemon and wet bread some pepper and citrus..the taste was worse it was a lemon zinger with pepperbread aftertaste that was just not good..the mouth fell was medium/thin ..not real drinkable..not one ill have again this summer"
"Usually impressed with the Sam but not with this beer. I won't be purchasing this ever again."
"Feel/Drink: Medium bodied, highly carbonated. Drinkability is great if you enjoy the flavor."
" pleasant approachable wheat ale...good for sessioning"
"Cheers!!"
"Taste is lightly citrus, with a light body, but I find it a really enjoyable drink, particularly for the style. Its well balanced, not overly flavorful or hop, but has subtle elements. Overall, it just has a summer feel to it, which makes it ideally suited for the season, and for its primary use."
"D-High marks in this area. This beer was made for hot summer days. Very refreshing and goes down easy. I've lost count of how many places I drank this beer at last summer, but please keep your orange wedge and frosted glass. This brew is better without them."
"D=There are just so damn many beers like this, and there's nothing to raise this one into the 75th percentile. The lemon's a nice touch. But if I wanted another beer like this, I would get some Leinie's or something, and use the buck I saved to buy an actual lemon. More Vitamin C that way."
"D- A very ready beer that is pretty drinkable, especially on those hot summer nights."
"Drinkability and Mouthfeel: Very light and refreshing beer that pairs really well with a lemon on a hot day to add some tang. Great summer beer to just sit and enjoy."
"Poured into a perfect pint glass. Very cloudy yellow/straw color with 1 finger white sudsy head. The smell is mild - wheat, lemon, yeast. The taste matches the smell. A strong wheat flavor with a bit of citrus. The bitter wheat, slightly sour lemon, ends with a touch of spice. It's a pretty good summer ale but feels a little heavy after a while. Not bad, but not my favorite of Sam Adams."
"Overall, I'm glad I had this one again. If you can get this beer fresh on tap or decently fresh in a bottle, don't hesitate to call on this after a hot day. I still think that older examples of this have a wierd after taste, but this iteration certaintly disproved that notion."
"Drinkability - for all my complaints, it isn't the worst thing in the world, but certainly no better than 'Okay'. I am glad it has a decent ABV though, if not I would probably let it stay in the fridge for desperate times."
"pours a golden yellow color with a little bit of pearl white head and light carbonation. there is malty wheat taste with some hints of lemon. neither were apparent in the smell. o.k. beer nothing great. probably wouldn't drink again unless it was the best beer available as it was last night when i was eating dinner at red lobster"
"Pours a cloudy golden straw with a fluffy white head. Smells of very faint lemon and a bit of spices which I would normally associate with a wheat beer. Taste is lemon with an adequate citrus hoppy taste coming in, a bit of a wheaty spicy flavor ends it. Mouthfeel is very crisp and light, pretty good for a warm summer day. Drinkability is also fairly high on this beer, it's perfect for a nice easy relaxing summer day. Overall nothing to write home about but adequately quenchable when the time calls for a nice refresher."
"Serving type: Tap"
"Sam Adams Summer ale poured a hazy golden color with a small head, that dispated quickly. I found the smell of it to be a bit offensive. There was a strong wheat taste, with lemon, and a delightful aftertaste, it was lighter, but still falvorfull, overall not their best seasonal, but still good."
"D - I think it's okay, but I can only see myself having one on occasion."
"Drinkability: This is a pretty average beer. Nothing really stands out about it. It's a good summer seasonal and is very refreshing on warm days but not something I'd seek out on a regular basis. There are many better wheat beers out there."
"A nice, and unique take on the style. It's great for hot summer drinking and pairs well with a variety of light fare."
"Overall, a decent brew and a nice summer seasonal. Some interesting flavors are detectable and are pretty well balanced. A nice choice when you want something refreshing and not too filling or bitter."
"Not bad overall. There are just much better other choices available. I will not buy this again."
"Drinkability - For me, this is a bit too funky for me to have again. This is coming from someone who likes wheat beer a lot. I guess its the 'grains of paradise' pepper that is the selling point and also the culprit at the same time. Maybe with fish, chicken, or white meat like that. Maybe. I can't believe the consensus has this better than the coastal wheat."
"Drinkability: Nothing special at all here. Not bad, and probably a good beer for hot summer days, but overall pretty average."
"All said, this was simply a very mediocre beer. I live in a very hot climate, but I can't see myself purchasing this one again. There are far too many beers of it's style out there that are superior."
"Certainly in the running for my favorite wheatbeer. This brew is exactly what it says it is, Summer Ale, its perfect for summer. Its appearance is cloudy amber. It smells of slight hops, wheat and zesty citrus. It tastes refreshing, its a wheat beer but with the taste of zesty lemon citrus flavors, very Similar to MagicHats Circus Boy. It has no flavors that overwhelm at any point, from first sip to aftertaste it presents a very even & pleasant palette, through and through. Its mouthfeel is average, nothing real special to report here, certainly not unpleasant, but not really unique. As far a drinkability, on a hot summer day, on the beach, out sailing, camping, hiking, grilling, enjoying a number of BBQ treats, polish-wiffle ball, or any other number of outdoor summer activities, this beer ice-chilled is a prime choice. Several of them in a row can and should be enjoyed on the regular this spring and summer."
"Notes: I reviewed the Blackberry Wit the other day and in terms of appearance and body it's much of the same, hence the similar review. I'd say I prefer the Blackberry to this one, though."
"Overall, I enjoyed the brew, and as with the others in the variety pack, I think they compliment each other very well."
"Drinkability: Oh so drinkable on a hot summer day (minus the heavy carbonation). Very refreshing with the powerful lemon taste and light body. Could probably fly through a 6-pack of this if it were hot enough!"
"For the last two years I was a huge fan of Sam's Summer Ale. When I first tasted Summer Ale in 08, I thought it was wonderful. It had a great taste from start to finish. Last year I was a little less impressed. This year's Summer Ale totally missed the mark in my opinion. It is great when it first hit my tongue, but then there was nothing! I thought maybe it was me and I asked others with me what they thought, and they agreed that when it first hits your tongue there is a party, but no finish... nothing. I know that every batch of a seasonal brew is different, but when I have and expectation of how something should taste, based on past experience, it is much more disappointing. I only hope that Sam's October Fest doesn't disappointment like this beer did."
"Meh. Pretty drinkable in the summer even though nothing really stands out. I think the citrus and odd spicing give it some redeeming qualities."
"D-when its really hot out and you just did some lawn work or w/e its pretty refreshing, but other than that it's kind of forgettable"
"Taste, lemon more nuanced, a good light wheat style. Good introductory thing goin' on. Wheat not heavy, but its there. Mouthfeel, goes from mild sour to mild sweet. Easy to drink. Save for hot days."
"An okay summer beer. After several of these I noticed that the aftertaste is almost like a cough drop or something like that. Kinda weird. I would drink this again, but would probably not buy again."
"Drinkability- Have to say this was highly drinkable and I really did enjoy the balance to it, very easily sessionable and I can look forward to seeing trying this on a hotter summer day, what took me back from what i remember it in the past is it has a touch more bitterness then I remember and its more drying on the finish then sweet, a good and highly drinkable beer I will visit again in the summer when looking for something I dont need to think about to much and just be refreshed by"
"Drinkablity: Decent wheat brew. I am not a big fan of wheat brews, but this was pretty good."
"Overall, a decent summer brew worth a taste. I wouldn't recommend it too highly, though."
"D - Eh, its nothing to write home about - but it would be a great alternative to the mass produced crap for a BBQ or other event. Think of it as the beer snobs party beer....I surely wouldn't get a 12 pack for myself, but a party full of naughty coeds??? Hey they gotta learn about real beer at some point"
"12oz. Eh how many times does somebody bring this to a party? Average summer lemony light beer. This is about as average as it gets for a summer. Wouldn't mind never having again, but I'll take it over coors any day. Not taking too much pride in this one."
"O: Respectable showing, but the tank isn't what I'm looking for in the style."
"Quite disappointed with this Sam Adams offering. Being the same, premium price as the Boston Lager, I would go with that any day over this. Won't be buying this one again."
"Overall I think this is an ok beer, but it doesn't have a great deal going for it. A step up from a Bud Light for sure.. but nothing to write home about."
"Final Thoughts: It's a bit odd, I mean it's drinkable but really this really reminds me of a cheaper, blander Creemore Kellerbier with wheat added into the mix. All in all, I'd recommend a try and it might be your thing but don't buy a whole six pack until you scout it out."
"Certainly not my favorite wheat ale, probably worse one I've tried although I honestly havent had tons of this type."
"Decent stuff, and perhaps I should have tried it when it was fresher (and when it wasn't a cold and drizzly early autumn day). Recommended, but only if you can't get your hands on Oberon, Dreamweaver or a great Belgian wit, which perform that same function with greater results."
"Nose is filled with lemon zest, those pesky, peppery grains of paradise, snappy wheat and mangoes. Taste is light and spicy, with the grains o' paradise and wheat flavors leading the way. The flavor feels a bit 'softer' out of the bottle than it does on tap."
"Not a good beer, and very disappointing. The spices didn't mix well with the lemon and/or wheat or grains and I did not find this beer refreshing at all. Not a summer ale I would seek out or have again."
"D: Flavor and smell kill it for me. patently average."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smeel is slightly sweet, some lemon and wheat. Taste is light and sweet, some hints of lemon, a touch of hops is present.Feels medium bodiedin the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this makes a pretty good selection."
"Nice and hazy. Thin head. Subtle to the nose. Crisp sharp and quenching but there is a muddy aftertaste. I can't say that i am really a fan of this. Too bad it might of been better. just not what I'm looking for in a wheat beer. What I want is something like the Mill street Wit beer. lot's of bready goodness with those citrus notes from good yeast."
"drinkability: not heavy at all, lemon is refreshing, though makes you thirsty because of the citrus"
"Moderate head of clean white that drops off into islands across the surface, close to zero lacing. Very mild haze to the yellow-orange color, lightens appreciably at the outer limits. Taut nose of hay, straw, wheat, lemon peel, more muted clove, allspice notes, becomes more bready as it warms, no fruit to speak of. Medium-bodied, in spite of the active and focused carbonation comes across as bottom heavy, moves slowly after mouth entry. The lemon and orange citrus more pronounced, the same for the grassiness, hence has more bitterness and bite. The spice is more diffused and has less impact. The grain and cereal keep coming at you, if without clear purpose. There's little here that others in the category don't do better, pretty sure the units move due to brand clout."
"Drinkability - a stable sessioner for summer/fall. Tasty without being too heavy."
"Overall, this isn't a bad beer. It is just spicy sweet if that makes sense. It is drinkable, especially on a warm day, but that is about it. Nothing to exciting, but nothing bad either."
"D: I have mixed feelings about this beer. The 1st bottle I had I didn't care for. The 2nd I had hours later was really good and the 3rd that I am now having it not so good again. I think the lemon and the malts clash and make this beer just so-so."
"Definitely will never buy this again. Couldn't wait to finish the case (my dog said no)"
"D: I didn't much care for this the first time I had it, but it's grown on me. A good summer beer."
"D - A good summer brew and a good wheat beer. Definitely drinkable."
"On a hot day by the pool this beer would be a good contender. If nothing else is around that is."
"Definitely a beer I would take out fishing with me and or to a BBQ out at the lake. It is a good substitute to a Hefeweizen, and it is a beer I would recommend to those who are exploring beers with a citrus hint."
"Don't drink and review."
"D- Ranks very high in my book on a summer night. I think it is a perfect summer beer, tasty, refreshing, goes well with or without food, and can easily be drank all night if need be. I haven't tried yet but I think it could also balance out a heavy winter dinner very well. This isn't a wheat beer with overpowering clove taste, which I find to be an unfavorable quality in wheat beers. Sam Adams hit the spot with this summer ale."
"Drinkability - I could see myself drinking this with pizza, burgers, something like that, but on it's own just as a drink to be enjoyed it really doesn't stand up."
"Am I the only person who thinks that Sam Adams is, in general, over-rated?"
"Nothing special about this one but the price."
" ~ This is certainly a summer brew. I'm not a big fan a beers such as this, however, I do believe that for a light summer brew, this is well done."
"Good example of a wheat beer that doesn't overpower with banana and clove flavors. Wouldn't mind drinking again, but wouldn't go out of my way to buy more either."
"Taste is light and spicy, with the grains o' paradise and wheat flavors leading the way. The flavor feels a bit 'softer' out of the bottle than it does on tap. I do not like the aftertaste on this beer, it is a bit sour, citrusly pithy and lingers for far too long. This falls somewhere between a witbier and an American wheat ale, but does nothing to impress. This is extremely far from my favorite summer beers."
"After numerous different beers tasted over the years, I have to remove my hat for Summer Ale. It has to be my all-time favorite. A fan of Sam to begin with, I could not help but easily enjoy Summer Ale. I miss it when it's off the shelves and I buy out the store when it's in season."
"a great, refreshing taste. a summer ale with some nice heft. the mouthfeel keeps things crisp and light, but quite full, making this quite drinakable alone but i can just see this going with grilled garlic shrimp."
"D - I've tried this beer over and over before I reviewed it, trying to like it. I just can't do it. The tastes are so odd to me. It's like it wants to be a good-tasting beer but the flavors just don't meld well and become odd. Could hardly finish one, and I was really thirsty."
"Crisp and refreshing, what more could you ask for a summer wheat ale. A very good seasonal, you could easily drink many of these with friends at a backyard barbecue!"
"The taste has very little to report because it is a pretty simple, uni-dimensional beer, it is just refreshing, there is a touch of some grainy husk, there is some lemony tartness, maybe, but overall it is a lawn mower beer with fancy labeling. It's okay for a barbeque on a hot summer day."
"However, for some reason at the brewery, the spices seemed subtler, in the background, and since theres not much else going on in the flavor department, made this beer quite refreshing considering the heat."
"A slight malt sweetness comes in after hay wheat flavor and the spice is slight but lingers on the palate. Mouthfeel is fine, you can really feel the flavors, which is a victory considering how little there seems to be. Very drinkable but also kind of drab. Tastes like an upgraded BMC with wheat flavor. There could be alot more here."
"T: This is a highly drinkable ale, and the first beer I think of when it comes to Summer Ales. Not my favorite summer seasonal, but still a quality ale."
"Drinkability: Definitely a solid summer brew. Not much in the nose, and not much in the way of taste, but the sessionability of this one on a summer day is going to be tough to beat."
"Drinkability - Easy drinking. Not much to this one though."
"I like this beer. this is one of the few Sam products I'll consistently order in the summer. Pours a light straw yellow with minimal head. Goes great paired with food and is perfect on a hot day. Taste is mainly a lemony acidity and a hop crispness, with a mild spice. Good, solid flavor composition. This beer is highly drinkable, too. One could drink 4-6 of these on a beach and feel fantastic. Light enought to be a good summer beer but not light on flavor, this is a perfect warm-weather brew, and at a buck a bottle (retail give or take) or $3-4 a pint, it's an incredible deal!"
"Poured a cloudy hazy yellow with a medium white head. Nose is floral hops, lemon,orange peel and a wheaty grain. Taste is smooth, hoppy a bit of malt but not much and a slight yeast aftertaste. Easily drinkable especially and I would think a great session beer. I really liked it."
"Overall: not seeing this as a solid summer offering--in fact, it seems a bit too malty, like some other Sam Adams beers are that lager a bit too heavy--zesty, perhaps, but the malt seems to suck much of the refreshment out of it--and refreshment is a summer ale's first priority, no?"
"D_A great summer ale that isn't too light. Brings plenty of flavour yet is something you can drink a lot of on a warm day"
"This was a very easy drinker. I'm usually enjoy the majority of Sam Adams offerings but this wasn't for me. A little too watery and thin."
"Pours a yellow orange slightly hazy color with a one finger head that is fluffy and white. The smell is of spice notes with a small amount of malt and some lemon aroma's. The taste is of citrus up front, in the middle there is a spicy note finished off by a lemon taste. The mouthfeel is moderately high in carbonation. Overall the drinkability on this is good. You will for sure want more than one, but the lemon could get old after a good amount."
"12oz. bottle served in my Weihenstephaner weizen glass. Poured a translucent orange-gold with a two-inch, billowy bright white head that lost half its volume within a minute. Nose reveals a sweet, spicy character, light malt and the merest suggestion of citrus. Taste is somewhat consistent with nose, but also buttery and biscuity, with a slight citrus astringency at the finish. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied, lightly effervescent and also a little slick. Not loving the taste on this one - perhaps one of my least favorite SA offerings; there's just a weird cloying/sweet/spicy character to this one that impacts its sessionability."
"Pours a cloudy yellow/golden color with a fair amount of lacing on the glass. The smell & taste are very good -- hoppy & citrusy. Hints of grapefruit. Nice, dry finish. Pretty smooth for a wheat ale. I'd rate the drinkability as pretty high, but I must admit that at a summer BBQ, after three or four of these, I was kinda yearning for something a little crisper. Overall, tho, very good beer."
"Sadly I must say that whatever appeal this beer once had for me is greatly reduced."
"D: Drinkable enough, just not much in terms of remarkable flavor. Seems to be a very safe middle of the road, brew. I think this would be good at gatherings, but I would get bored with too much of this...there just isn't much to offer here..."
"Very drinkable and very non offensive. This brew lacks alot of character but is still good for a session. Nice on a hot day."
"Cheers!"
"A fairly decent brew, but I seem to remember it being significantly better on-tap."
"Overall, pretty good. Not a lot to make it stand out from other summery, citrus wheat beers however."
"Drinkability: I must say this simple refreshing drink was the perfect beer to have when being done with a hot day at the beach. Otherwise, I do not think I will be picking this one up again."
"I poured into a pint glass to an inch of creamy white head. It was gold in color and cloudy. I got the lemon scent right away followed by the wheat. I tasted the lemon up front and got the spicy, bready taste on the back end. It tastes a lot better than I remember. I am on my second and see no problem finishing the other two I have left. I may drink it again."
"This beer has become one of my favorites from SA. Can't go wrong on a hot summer night with some of these around!"
"D- Pretty easy drink. I went through a couple of these before I knew it. The only problem is that the citrus flavor becomes a little too much after a couple."
"Drinkability - A good beer to have on a hot California summer Sunday. Sitting outside doing this review and drinking this makes me enjoy it all the more and it really does hit the spot right now."
"Drinkability was excellent. This beer complemented my steak and mashed potatoes perfectly on a summer day. An enjoyable brew!"
"It's above average for the style, but not spectacular."
"I think this is a great beer for the summer. It's not complex and it's not packed with flavor, but it is incredibly easy to drink. It is also very refreshing on a hot and humid day. It's even something that most non-craft beer drinkers can enjoy. Definitely something I look forward to every summer."
"Taste: The taste doesn't come together quite as nicely as the smell of the beer does. Still pretty tasty, though. The grains of paradise give it a certain ""hearty"" character that sets it apart from other wheat beers."
"By far my worst experience with the Boston Brewing Company"
"Summer ale was not nearly as good as we had hoped, and we were scratching our heads trying to figure out what we were missing. I started to wonder if we got a bad six. However, there was nothing obvious to say that this beer was damaged or very old. I hate blasting this beer, but compared to Gumballhead, Honey Moon, 312, etc this one didn't live up to the mark."
"Not much to talk about here. A basic example of the style. Altogether a nice beer for what it is. It's a thirst quencher which makes it drinkable on a hot summer day."
"D- Although not my favorite flavor profile, I could definitely drink quite a few of these."
"Pours a hazy, cloudy orangish-yellow with a thick foamy head that quickly settles down to about 1/4"". Active carbonation, lots of tiiny bubbles rising to the top. Aroma is tangy and citrus-y, definite hints of lemon. Taste is crisp & refreshing, clean wheatiness with a nice lemon peel bite. A hint of spiciness. There's a nice creaminess to the mouthfeel. Overall, a really good thirst quenching summer beer. After working in the hot sun all day, a couple of these REALLY hit the spot!"
"I not a big fan of wheat beers so if you like them then you shouldnt have read this review"
"Best before date: April 2010."
"Pretty nice appearance. Good combination of components in the nose, although subtle. Nice light flavor with good combo of summer elements in there. Overall, this is a really nice quaff, summer or otherwise."
"Prost!"
"A nice hazy golden color with a 1.5 finger head that faded quickly. The taste is citrus with a hint of spice that I can't put my finger on. Possibly corriander? Overall a very light, refreshing taste. Pretty good drinkability as it is not hoppy in the least. A good basic beer, but not something I would ""have to have"" as it were."
"Two in & I'm done here."
"Overall pretty nice and refreshing."
"D -- This beer isn't drinkable at all in my opinion. I would definatly not recommend it."
"I've had this beer before at bars, but since I can't smell very well I never noticed this beer's odd smell. It's not strong, but doesn't give a good intro to the beer. Decent tasting beer for the summer though."
"Overall: One of my new favorites from Sam Adams! And I believe I'll be downing these all summer because Spec's has them on sale for 5.99 a six pack till August 1st!"
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - This beer was not surprisingly crisp, and very refreshing. Has an almost watered down taste to it on the finish, as well as a crisp mouthfeel, and that really makes this beer highly drinkable. You could easily throw back several of these on a scorching hot day, I really loved the way the mouthfeel compliments the flavor profile. Nothing was really lacking with this one, it's pretty well balanced & highly enjoyable. I say run out on the hottest day of the summer & pick up a case of this zesty and refreshing brew. You wont be disappointed. Cheers!"
"Very bright, slightly cloudy in the glass with a whitish yellow head. Citrus-ey with a crisp fruity aroma. I'm going to compare this one to the Nit Wit@BJ's as far as initial taste. I consider this one to be much better though. The taste is much better throughout. Heavier, fuller flavor in this one with a spicy after. Sweeter than I expected. Nice heavier texture like an ale should be with a smooth swallow. Drinkability is very good. Heavy flavors and spices are definitely a good paring with a nice ribeye or tri-tip."
"Good drinking summer beer but not especially noteworthy."
"While you could drink a bunch of these if you wanted, would you want to? I tried giving this beer another chance looking for a good lighter warm weather beer, but it just doesn't do it for me. I drank this sixer quickly just to get rid of it."
"an okay wheat beer for the summer."
"D -- I may have to change this to a 5 after another, but this beer takes the American Wheat style up a couple steps from the usual expectations. As is its title, this is a great Summer thirst-quencher."
"Not exactly the kind of beer I'd crave on a hot summer day. But definitely not bad."
"D- Easily drinkable, if only it tasted a little better."
"D 3.5 - goes down easy, this brew is my least favorite seasonal from BBC to date, not bad, just not ""great""."
"Drinkability: the name says it all, cause i wouldn't be drinking this any other time than the summer, nor would i ask for this at a bar/restaurant. definitely an average beer."
"A good beer to have with a steak or burger because it will not be too filling and would complement food made on the grill pretty well"
"D-This crisp summer ale is a very good beer to have on a hot day."
"Had on tap at a restaurant at Dallas Fort Worth airport during a nearly infinite layover. The beer was clear golden color with a standard foam cap. Not much in the aroma, very muted spice maybe but more likely just the smell of malt and hope (not hops). The taste is not spiced, nor hopped, more just a bland American wheat ale. Meh, this is nothing to write home about, I should have gone for the Boston Lager. Not recommended."
"This is my favorite of all the Sam Adams beers...say what you will. I really only buy this one consistently and only during the summer obviously. I've yet to find an American brewery producing a ""Summer Ale"" that is as good or better than this. Is it the best beer in the world? No. Of course not. Is it crisp and refreshing and great on a hot summer day outside? Yes."
"It's an okay beer but I can't imagine seeking it out."
"The appearance was pretty typical of a summer brew, poured with a little bit of head that faded quickly. Smell was average for a similar beers. The taste was something I wasn't expecting at all, it was very tangy and was almost a chore to swallow after awhile. The mouthfeel was usual, but the tanginess was very undesirable and made the drinkability score pretty low too. I will definitely not be picking this one up again."
"Taste is fruity, but tart and a bit yeasty. Slightly off-tasting, not terribly clean. Ever so bitter aftertaste. Sweet spice, touch of coriander perhaps. Mouthfeel was decent, carbonation was acceptable. Goes down easily, no struggle. Overall not a bad Sam Adams offering, but nothing special either."
"D - I'm not too sure about the drinkability based on the first impression. I'm going to have to go out and buy a six pack of this to rate it correctly. Based on the body and how the beer is supposed to taste I'd imagine it would be pretty drinkable."
"Wonderfully drinkable and one of the better American-style wheat ales dominating the seasonal summer releases. Easy-downing yet interesting, well-balanced, and very refreshing."
"Drinkability: I thoroughly enjoy this beer. It's great on a hot day; and for me, it would be great just about any other time."
"D - High. This is my go to beer for summer. The grains of paradise in this must be the ticket. It just goes very well with hot weather."
"Drinkability - I'll use the word ""unique"" again. I liked it and recommend it. Heavier than most summer brews but that's probably why I liked it."
"D. I could drink this brew on a warm summer day, quenching and refreshing brew"
"Drinks very well and is incredibly refreshing."
"Sam Adams Summer Ale pours a hazy gold with a small white head and decent lacing. The smell was very interesting, hints of sea shore, and lemon. The taste was of sea salt, with hints of lemon and bread. Mouthfeel was a little heavy. The drinkability was nice, spot on for a summer wheat beer. Overall this beer was ok. Nothing really challenging here, but this serves its purpose. Its a nice easy drinker, good for summer drinking in the sun."
"Not Sam Adams' best offering, but still might be a decent choice in a bar with limited selection or as a refreshing brew on a hot day."
"Pours a hazy straw yellow. Smells fairly ""bright."" Citrus (dunno if its from actual citrus or the yeast) is dominant on the nose. I can also smell some floral hops. Mouthfeel is smooth, I feel like it should be a bit more carbonated for a wheat. A little sweet, and bready. Spices run throughout it, I taste a lot of coriander. It certainly isn't as boring as a lot of other American Wheats are."
"When poured into the glass, it carried a small amount of foam, very light wheat in color, almost white and dissapated quickly. The color was a rich, hazy golden honey. The smell had a lemony/orange zest with an equal balance of hops and wheat and a hint of honey. The taste was an exact mirror of the smell. Drinkability - easy on the palate and easy going down witha dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel - light to medium bodied with a very subtle graininess."
"Like almost all of the other beers from the Boston Beer Company, this one does not disappoint. I would rate this as an excellent summer beer. It's a well-balanced beer because each element of flavor remains distinct without being too overpowering. This beer would be as great of a companion on a grilling oddesy as it would be after doing yardwork all day. Enjoy it while it's out!"
"D - Moderate flavor strength and refreshing enough. Quite drinkable."
"Had this at the Philly airport. Poured a light golden color with white head that faded quickly but left good lacing. Smelled of wheat malts and lemon. Tasted lemony and a bit grainy. Fairly smooth, but a little dry on the finish. Overall, not a beer that I would have more than one of."
"I was expecting this to be very refreshing and more unique than other beer. i felt it did ok in both those areas but it could have been better. It certainly wasn't a bad beer at all, it had good flavor and i liked the subtle differences it had but in the end i wish it would have maintained the drinkability but had more flavor like i later found boston lager to have. I think i would try it again one day, but so far i would reach for something else before i went for this again on a warm summer night"
"D: Very drinkable. Easy to know a few back."
"This one pours a cloudy amber color with a decent head that leaves some thin lacing. The smell is that of malt, grains, spice and citrus. The taste is a nice grainy, citrus taste, quite flavorfully but not overpoweringly sweet and spicy. The body is light to medium and the mouthfeel is pretty crisp. It finishes dry and lingers well. This one could easily be a regular."
"Pours a very light orange with a thin head that fades quickly and does not lace at all. Smells faintly spicy and a tad hoppy, but no malt character. Tastes very bitter and over hopped. There is a large dose of spices which is unwelcome without some sweet malt backbone but this beer has no malt presence whatsoever. Mouthfeel is too thick for a beer that is supposed to be refreshing. Drinkability is low, this should be much lighter and much milder and much tastier."
"As for drinkability, I can't complain."
"Drinkability: So my first bottle out of this sixer may not have done it for me, but this one seems to be right on par with what I remember. Not the best APWA going (tough to compete with the likes of Gumballhead), but it's certainly solid and I will enjoy it for the rest of the summer."
"This was a decent beer that I would have again for sure. And now I know what summer tastes like..."
"Drinkability - A great mowing the lawn or session beer. Perfect for summer."
"A great summer ale, certainly successful in completing its intentions. I recommend it."
"D- If I were going to buy an ale for a hot summer day, this would not be my top choice. Not as refreshing or crisp as I had expected."
"Nikki"
"From the bottle to a pint glass it showed a nice white head and a clear yellowish light wheat color. Good carbonation. Aroma was not strong. Slight grains, citrus and malt evident. Taste is light on hops with a touch of citrus, grain and malt that became less evident over time. It has a rather smooth mouthfeel and goes down really easy. A very pleasant and enjoyable Summer Ale. I was pleasantly surprised."
"Conclusion: Just kind of unsorted (also kind of an odd bitterness on the finish)...I tried this a year or two ago and wasn't a huge fan...now that I'm reviewing it...I'm still not."
"D: Goes down really easy, good beer to drink at the beach."
"D: A good sunshine brew, one of my top three as a matter of fact. Recommended."
"Drink is good a little to sweet for my liking but a definite for a hot summer day. Not really a session beer."
"An interesting beer for sure. It has a nice light golden color and the aroma is different. You get a lot of lemon and spice immediately. The taste matches the smell as well. Strong citrus flavors in a light, crisp taste. Very nice on a hot summer day. While not in more normal taste range, it was interesting to try it out. I would chose this again."
"I ate some strawberries with this beer on a hot day in late May and they went well together."
"D - The drinkability would be there for me if there was a little more flavor...it's a great summer beer...very refreshing"
"just not nearly as good as goose islands summertime to warrant buying this seasonal again"
"m/d- surprisingly dry finish, felt alcohol in the throat"
"This beer pours a hazy golden/orange with a medium-sized white head, wispy lacing left on the glass. Nose is mostly of citrus, lemon being the most prevalent, with a touch of malts and yeast. Taste is starts with grany malts malts, and then of sweet malts and spices. It is then followed by sharp lemon flavor and a slight bitterness. This is a lighter bodied beer, decent carbonation, lemon bitterness aftertaste to it. Relatively drinkable especially to the ABV, not my favorite style, but I wouldn't pass it up."
"so this makes for a great beer for what it is, a summer ale, and i can't wait to have a few after a hot day cutting the grass, would be a great camping session-type beer"
"D- Very drinkable, fresh and light, definitely a good summer ale..."
"Overall it's one of my least favorite Sam Adams but still a decent pick up."
"d- very drinkable, delicious wheat ale for spring and summer, need to be sitting outside to fully enjoy this one, mmm."
"It's a rather refreshing brew. I think the taste is about equal on tap and bottle. I think I will be buying this beer again pretty soon. It goes great with BBQ on a nice hot sunny day."
"Final Thoughts: An interesting twist on the style but I expected something more from such a well respected brewery and what is supposedly their best selling of all seasonals"
"Until I had the Brooklyn Summer Ale this was my favorite summer ale. I have had this on many occasions both on tap and bottle but most recently in a bottle. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a nice hazy golden color with a decent white head. Aroma of mostly citrus and some light pepper. Taste has more of lemon, orange, and some light spices. Some light acidity kicks in as well. It has a nice dry finish. Will definately try again."
"D: A solid, refreshing option from Sam Adams. I had this on tap last night and was pretty unimpressed, but this is somewhat more focused and coherent from the bottle. This would be nice to drink while grilling or sitting on the beach."
"This is a decent beer made for the summer. With temperatures close to ninety, it's a good fit for today. Though the lemon is part of the equation, it's not as overpowering as I expected it to be. Overall, a little bland, but I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again if there were few choices."
"The beer is certainly refreshing, but the sour is a bit off putting all the way throught the beer. Good but not great."
"Cloudy and muddy, quite opaque, can barely see my hand on the other side through glass. Head is big and pillowy with lacing all down the sides. Smell is grassy, and lemony, quite malty. The spices aren't really noticable in the nose. Taste is lemon at the end, then comes a floral spiciness. The spices they use do come through in the taste, but seem rather out of place. Overall, kind of a strange taste to this. Mouthfeel is kind of chewy, a good level of carbonation."
"D: This beer makes me sad, very poor offering from a company that can do much better. This beer is an odd mix of flavors on a very heavy beer for a ""Summer Brew""."
"D: Ridiculously drinkable, the aim of every summer beer."
"D. Good brew here. Drinkable, you bet. Not as easy drinking as some summer brews, but great for what it is."
"Not a mindblowing experience, but nothing to turn down either. I had a couple before moving on..."
"D - there was too much citrus fruit/spice flavor going on here for me to enjoy the wheat. i've had this from a bottle before and it seemed way more subdued so I'll probably stick to that."
"Overall, not the best I've had like this. I much prefer North Coasts Blue Star but this is pretty good and easier to get fresh."
"I prefer to drink this out of the bottle. For some reason, I didn't like the tap version of the Summer Ale. However, it wasn't horrible. It remains my top choice of on-tap beers at my local bar. It was served to me in a pint glass with no head. I could smell an aroma of fruit and mild hops. It is very drinkable, but as I said, I prefer to drink it from the bottle. It's one of the best wheat ales Sam Adams has to offer."
"Gotten out of the Sam Adams Variety Pack."
"I believe this was the first wheat beer I enjoyed. I used to hate everything wheat other than this. Still holds up pretty well for me."
"A gold appearance. Smells a lot like lemon rinds.All at once Citrus, mixed with a slight hop character, and the tastes classic of a wheat. Decent drinkability, and decent mouthfeel. I generally cant appreciate wheat beers for their lackluster light uncompromising style. I want depth, not something to drink on the beach. This has as much depth as a kiddy pool."
"Overall, a sessionable summer beer with sone nice flavors. However, it is a bit generic as there is nothing particularly unique about this beer. A good option either as a light summer beer or a gateway beer for macro drinkers."
"The feel of this beer is light. The flavors bring about the feeling of summer. It is a really good beer for the summer and would go well with some nice baribcue chicken and hot dogs."
"D - Very drinkable. Could easily drink a few of these with no problem. Would be very refreshing during the summer."
"Drinkability: I had this on tap last night at the 99 because there were not many alternatives. Maybe it is new recipe but I liked this a lot more than I remembered liking it before. I have not had one in a couple of years. It seemed fresh and tasty. I could session these based off of last night's draft experience."
"This is a golden beer without alot going on as far as head is concerned. Smells of sweet bread. The taste is better than the Spring Ale though with the citrus and spiciness. Very drinkable and it has a nice mouthfeel for a summer beer, plenty of carbonation. Its ok."
"D - This was a very good beer, the addition of the spice did make this quite as refreshing as Summer Ale should be in my opinion, but it was still good"
"D- One or two would be alright. Whatever that taste/feel I am calling chalky is leaves me feeling that it is not up to par with other summer beers. However I have heard it is better on tap so I will give it another chance."
"Overall - Late night in the basement isn't exactly the perfect place to be drinking summer ale. Nevertheless, it's a solid summer offering; will definitely consider again."
"High drinkability. The flavors never get old to me, and is another good offering from Samuel Adams. Cheers!"
"D: Very drinkable.... this will be great on a hot day... I'm looking forward to having some of these over the summer... This is the first summer ale of the year... Yea, summer is here."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer, especially when it gets hot in Florida...for example, it was in the upper 80's low 90's today and the first one I had, disappeared like a Copperfield act!"
"I couldn't drink more than a bottle of this, and as a summer seasonal, the astringent, plasticky taste is enough to ruin the thirst-quenching potential of this beer."
"Final Thoughts - Decent beer from Sam Adams. When I first tried this beer, I was absolutely obsessed with it and purchased it as often as I could. Since I have gotten into craft beers, I have discovered better options, however this is not a bad offering."
"Cheers!!!"
"D- Excellent. Nothing to wow you here, just a pleasant easy drinking ""Summer"" ale. This brew has really grown on me and is now sort of a guilty pleasure for me."
"Light in taste. I wished for a little more in that department. But it seems like it would be a good summer session. Great pair with thai food."
"Pretty drinkable on a hot day or maybe good as a lawn mower beer. Like most SA products, nothing great but still a pretty solid offering and a decent seasonal."
"A well put together and refreshing beer worth trying and definetly a sessionable one for the summer."
"The taste is about the same, thin white wine, hints of fruit candy and lemon with a finish of lemon, crackers, and hint of bread. It's light and zesty with some flavour, yet with a definite alcoholic note that soon detracts and the charscter soon becomes a bit rough and thin."
"I guess I expected more, just not a beer I would want to go out and buy again."
"D: Quite easy to drink really. This is a great summer afternoon beer. Easy to drink and pretty refreshing."
"Pours an orangish body, not purely see-through. White head, small & diminishing. Very malty aroma Some spices, some hops. Very weak. Somewhat bitter, some spice & flowers. Floral on the aftertaste. Carbonated, but flat on flavor."
"Pours a deep gold with a touch of cloudy haze,big lasting fluffy white head The aroma is zesty,malty, wheaty, and has a little spice (a hint of pepper, from the grains of paradise I guess). The flavor is delightful and quenching. It starts with tasty, bready/biscuit malts with a distinct note of wheat malt. There is a refreshing touch of citrus from the lemon zest there is a balancing level of hop bitterness, but the beer is not particularly bitter. It finishes a little dry, refreshing, and spicy from noble hops and grains of paradise. There is a subtle touch of lemon zest lingering in the finish, too. The mouthfeel is rich and full for such a refreshing, light-feeling beer.Lots of carbonation that seems to make it just a little lighter. A very nice beer"
"Drinkability: A bit of a plebeian brew from ""America's first craft brewery""... drinkable, of course, but which typical Sam Adams brew really isn't? Nothing stands out though, and I think this might actually suffer from blandness. (Other beers, it's their badness that gives them character). In their attempt to appeal to the masses, Sam Adams has made their beers TOO generic-tasting."
"Nahh.. the run of good Samuel Adams brews ended with this one.. Golden yellow pour into a medium, white frothy head that quickly dissipates. Aroma of yeasty malts, wheat bread, lemon and citrus with hints of peppery spices. Initial flavor of malty citrus with a dry lightly hopped finish. Too citrusy for my taste buds."
"Orange yellow pour with fading white head. Smells some light spices very lemon. More body than expected, hops, orange, lots of lemon again and citrus taste, medium carbonation. I like this relative to similar beers, but I prefer most other Sam Adams products over this. I could drink a few of these sitting by the lake in the summertime with friends."
"(rated Jul 11, 2007)"
"Citrus aroma. The beer could benefit from being a bit stronger on the nose. Golden yellow hue that fits the seasonal beverage. Flavor is a little bit weak- I remember enjoying this brew a lot more a few years past than I do now- but still satisfying on a hot summer day. Strong lemon/citrus presence throughout the aroma, hue, and flavor of this beer. Mouthfeel is pretty average, nothing to write home about. This beer was one of my favorites a few years ago. I still enjoy it, but have since discovered other beers- namely certain Hefeweizens such as Franziskaner- that I prefer over Samuel Adam's Summer Ale as my summer drink."
"The beer was cloudy with a one finger head. The pleasing aromas of lemons, malt and wheat together got my taste buds watering. The malt and lemons and wheat was palate pleasing. but the finish was slightly askew. The finished tasted like a very sour lemon, but overall it was refreshing."
"Smooth, citrusy wheat beer. Pours murky orange, almost like a watered-down orange juice. Lots of lemons in the aroma, with a mellower wheat background. Infinitely simple and refreshing, yet also very average. It looks better than it tastes, making it a slightly above average American Wheat."
"5/4/4/3/11 (2.7/5)"
"D - Highly drinkable, refreshing, and flavorful. I've spent many a great evening by the grill with a Summer Ale in my hand, and I look forward to many more."
"It has a real faint aroma. There are some bean and malt tones. The body was nice. There was an off white nice two and half fingers of head. The body is a golden honey like amber. It has a great citrus and mildly spicy taste. A little hop bitterness at the end. Mouthfeel is average a little bite but not much at all."
"A crisp, clean beer with very little, if any aftertaste. Sometimes the beer would have an excellent light and crisp citrusy note and sometimes it would not. Very minimal lace around the glass as I drank this beer. Overall i would consider this a beer that would be very palatable on hot summer days."
"Drinkability: Crisp, refreshing, light to medium...so good for this. Could go through these fairly easily. Not the best of the style, but a solid performer nonetheless."
"I'd take this over a Blue Moon any day"
"Another fine Sam Adams session beer. Nothing thats going to take your breath away but a very drinkable and refreshing summer beer."
"This is not the best beer that Sam Adams has done but it is a beer I do enjoy in the summer months. It has a nice taste with just a bit of citric to it. Not a beer that will blow you away, but a good go to beer for the summer days. Refreshing and very drinkable."
"Its a refreshing ale and goes good with a hamburger right off the grill."
"i would recommend this one, but don't go out of your way to find it. Good but somewhat average."
"Nothing beats a nice Sam Adams Summer Ale on a hot day in June/July. So damn refreshing and crisp it is super drinkable. Has just enough of that lemon/citrusy kick at the end ot make it interesting but not too much. I look forward to every May when this begins to start rolling out."
"D- A good, drinkable beer. I wouldn't mind having a few of these in the summer after a day outside."
"Poured a hazed orange/red color with a thin stable white head. Did not smell good, I think it was a little old, smelled a little skunked, didnt taste that way though. Lots of wheat flavors with a slight ctirus taste, decent hops, didnt go perfectly with the citrus but it was decent. One was enough, not too crazy about it, but try it if you havent had it.."
"D: A nice summer cooler from SA. The tanginess is a touch that increases the quench factor."
"D - Not to bad, easy to knock back a few"
"As the name implies, Sam Adams Summer Ale is made for a hot summer day or night- a thirst quencher."
"Not a bad beer, but nothing all that exciting. A fall back for me if there is nothing better."
"to ad a slight zing. I like this SA style very much."
"1.5	D yuck. doesn't seem worthy of ""beer"" label. dumped last couple inches."
"I'm not impressed with this beer. It has almost no taste! It is certainly better than a Bud Light or Coors or junk like that, but I expect more flavor than this. It has a smell, average, but present, and the feel is also average. Depending on your standards, the drinkability will vary - I like to be interested with every sip, and since this beer doesn't have much taste, I wouldn't drink another one. Not recommended, but if you're not looking for much in a beer, and you don't like Bud or Coors, I guess check it out."
"D: Definitely drinkable on a hot summer day."
"D-- It is a definite summer beer. It is already cooling off where I live, so it felt a bit out of place. Definitely a good daytime barbecue or picnic beer."
"Nice light honey color with a lot of suspended yeast. Foamy white head that leaves fine lace. Smells of citrusy lemon zest and spice (Grains of paradise ?). Taste is lemony and fairly refreshing, squeaky clean on the finish. Drinkability is decent. I think this beer, like most summer beers is good on a hot day but unremarkable."
"I poured a cold bottle into a tall, cyclindrical glass for this tasting. This seasonal brew is a fine summer compliment to the other Sam Adams offerings. I need to research this ""grain of paradise"" in more depth!"
"D - Seriously, how can you not like this beer? I don't understand the B- rating at all."
"This would be very refreshing on a nice, hot day."
"D - extremely drinkable. On e of my favorite Sam Adams beers."
"D: Drinkability is light, refreshing, and crisp, good enjoyability on a hot summer day."
"Pours a hazy, dirty golden color with a moderate sized off-white head. Aroma is rather fresh with some citrus zing to it. This has a lemon, citrusy wheaty flavor with mild spices. Nice and refreshing. Nothing too complex but this really does work for the summer. Good patio beer and a nice seasonal offering from Sam Adams."
"D. Very good brew to enjoy with friends and a summer evening. I could go for another. Right now in fact."
"Drinkability- Very Good, highly drinkable. This would be perfect for a BBQ, cutting the grass or just because."
"Drinkability: Everything about this beer says SUBTLE but definitely not simple, everything in this beer is very well balanced no one ingredient really stands out but together they make the beer as a whole stand out."
"Appearance is cloudy yellow-gold with an off-white head. Decent lacing. Hmm, I definately see some floaties about the size of pepper grains. There are some weird aromas going on here, too. I smell some faint lemon, floral hops and cereal grains (all OK) but there's an odd aroma of like saran wrap or something ""artificial"" that doesn't belong there. Flavor is similar to aroma including the weird saran wrap thing. Medium to medium low hop bitterness and flavor. Strong flavors of lemon abound that renders this a rather tart if not almost sour brew. Mouthfeel is pretty thin for an American wheat. I like Sam Adams but this beer had some issues."
"Medium mouth feel maybe more creamy than crisp. Carbonation not lively enough to be crisp. Very smooth drinker. Good summer ale."
"12oz bottle from LCBO at $13.45 for a six-pack. Pours a cloudy pale gold with a head that fades quickly. Light metallic aroma. Initial taste has a gentle yeast spiciness (is that those ""grains of paradise""?), but the taste ends on a watery note. Any wheatness falls squarely into the ""American Wheat"" category as opposed to Belgian or German. Light mouthfeel. I'll give this a pass if it comes back to the LCBO next summer."
"I rated this beer the way I did because compared to other Summer Ales, this one is not balanced enough...it is not refreshing, clean, and really does not have any summer aspects in it"
"D - I could drink these all day long, especially on a hot day."
"Drinkability: I love this beer in the summer very drinkable and refreshing but bold and flavorful."
"Drinkability is the best part of this beer. There is a reason this beer is so popular in the summertime. It may not have the great taste profile of some wheat beers, but it has a strong taste and is drinkable enough to drink all day long in the heat. Great summer beer."
"Solid drinkability for setting (Uno's) - wouldn't seek this out but given this as only choice is a decent option."
"This is an okay American Pale Wheat Ale, but I feel it isn't as refreshing as the other ones out there, which makes it a not-so-great summer beer. The flavor just seems a little tart and harsh."
"drinkability is good. this is a good brew for a hot summer day, with good proportioning and flavors that compliment eachother well. cheers!"
"D - Great light crisp beer. Easy to drink for any occasion."
"www.theviceblog.com"
"D= This isn't the best summer wheat ale out there, but sometimes in restaurants you have to pick the beer that is the least bad. All in all, a fine beer for summer swilling."
"The Summer Ale pours a hazy orange yellow with a good 2 finger foam head with minimal retention. The aroma is unique with the stated Grains of Paradise used. It has a good wheat smell to it. The taste is clean and the malt slathers the tongue and the second half is the lemony spice flavor. It is highly carbonated as the massive amounts of little bubbles rush to the top. It is a pretty darn good summer time session beer."
"D: Scores well here. This is typical mass-produced Sam Adams offering - solid and consistent, but not great. I'm always happy to get a sixer of this on sale and enjoy it without thinking too hard about it."
"Decent carbonation, a bit of a tart aftertaste. I know that this is the drinkable summer beer, but I'm not digging it that much. For body, you could knock these back on a hot day. I just don't like the taste enough."
"May not be a thick beer lover's beer but I think it does exactly what it's supposed to do. I would love to leisurely sit back and have this whole twelve back over the course of an entire day. And I probably will."
"Drinkability- Wow these are easy to drink. Not very filling, has a good taste but isn't too full bodied to make you want to not have another."
"I have never really been a big Sam Adams fan. And I will never forgive them for the bullet aimed at all humanity known as ""cherry wheat."" This beer isn't nearly that bad, but it does remind me a bit of ACC football--hovering somewhere around mediocrity, never really breaking out of it, but not quite sinking below it either. The beer pours a fairly light golden color with a heat about the size of Ally McBeal, and retains nothing while the bubbles lethargically fondle themselves in the corner. The beer tastes to me like a lager with some wheat and lemon thrown in, and I'm pretty sure that's about all there is. You can quaff it on a summer day, sure, but any wheat beer in hot temperatures probably isn't the best idea in the first place, and I would rather spend less money on Coronas and lime. Still, its not a disaster if you've already grabbed a sixer, just surreptitiously pawn it off to your peripheral friends and hope to get something better from them at a later time."
"I love this beer! Started with an average sized, frothy, white, and mostly diminishing head. The body hue was medium yellow/light orange with tiny particles averagely dispersed. The aroma was a nice heavy dough with moderate malts and light hops. The flavor was definately sweet that calms down until a nice average bready finish. The body was medium to full, dry, and softly carbonated. I really love this beer and is in my top 5 of favorite beers right now."
"D - Solid but forgettable summer ale..."
"I really liked this beer. I should also mention that it hit something like 106 degrees today in Dallas, so if there ever was a perfect day for a beer like this, today is it. It came as part of a mixed case from Sam's Club, so you never know how fresh it is. Didn't think to check for a born on date before tossing the bottle. It poured a light golden. Nice head that stood up for a few minutes before dissipating. Took a big sniff. Very pleasant fruitiness. Lemon. Big expectations for a beer that will fight off this oppressive heat. No bitterness at all, but wasn't expecting any and true to style. Very refreshing. Despite the very light quality to it, there is a discernable maltiness. Well balanced for its type. I had mine with a lightly seasoned grilled chicken and it was a very nice companion. I recommend this beer for hot days or for a session beer (although my case only came with four). Cheers!"
"I would not recommend this beer."
"On tap at a questionable establishment I'm tempted to pick up a sixer to compare yet I'm also cautious to not waste more money on this beer. The aroma was mild and pleasant. The beer poured a strange orange-peach color with minimal head. It just looked fake in the glass, not offensive just odd to put it best. As I sipped on this beer I was able to detect the wheat influence. There is a spicy taste that compliments the wheat, but I'm not sure if I like it. Other than those two aspects the overall flavor was borderline bland. Mouthfeel is somewhat pleasant and the finish is relatively smooth. Overall I'm hoping this beer is better than what was poured from the tap. Revisit (as promised) Well it's July and my friend brought over a 12 pack of this for dinner the other night. Having this fresh from the bottle and drunk from a nice clean glass my opinion has slightly changed for the better. Looks better, feels better, and tastes much better. Still a tad weak in my opinion but it is more crisp and inviting this time around. The flavor needs a boost to really let this one soar. Decent summer time beer."
"For some reason I guess I expected this beer to really have some zing to it. Other reviews have hit accurately on its qualities. Wheaty and a little grassy smelling, slightly cloudy gold, light wheat ale flavor. Anyway, it's very underwhelming for me. Maybe it's because this tastes exactly like the cherry wheat (which I had to endure six of) except with lemon replacing the cherry. Another bland pale wheat ale offering from Sam Adams."
"D, notes: This is a fine beer to relax with on a nice summer day. I imagine a good beer for cooking with as well."
"Smell, sweet, and lemony. Tasted very crisp, slightly spicing and slight hop taste. Very smooth, and a very drinalble summer beer. A nice one to have in the fridge on those 110+ degree Arizona summer afternoons!"
"Overall an ok beer, but nothing special. I prefer the Southern Tier AWA or Bells AWA over this one for sure, they both carry more hops. Still, an easy drinking beer that is refreshing in the summer."
"mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, good amount of flavor.. not much else to say - there are way better offerings from boston brewing, a refreshing and interesting summer take for sure"
"I guess it's a fair summer ale, nothing special and a little too light with very little flavor."
"This pours pretty clear with a nice head. Smells of lemon, a tad bit of malts and hops as well; not too much going on. Tastes kind of bland. A little citrus, followed by some hop bitterness, and finally a huge hit of wheat. Overall, this was a decent summer beer. I prefer something with a tad bit more taste and balance, but this was very drinkable and extremely refreshing. Great summer beer."
"Drinkability: A fine, refreshing summertime offering, Samuel Adams Summer Ale walks the fine line between delivering the goods on flavor and being super easy to gulp down."
"I see it, the yellow label grabs me and says, drink me, it's summer, but I just can't be very excited once I've tried it. It's mainstream, which isn't in itself a bad thing, but it could be more. Still it drinks quite easily. The issue is, with so many things out there, will I grab another one? So I've tried it, and I'll finish the six, but that's likely the end of this little tryst."
"D: Nothing special at all. If your looking to put down a fair amount and not know it, much less taste, this is your backyard hot beer. A great session beer because I could down a sixer and go back to work and not even know I drank that much. One of the mildest Sam creations I have quaffed."
"Hey what a delight! I finally tried this summer brew not knowing anything about it and was pleasantly surprised indeed. I was happy to find that Sam Adams strayed from the common banana or orange-infused summer wheats. The lemon zest and grains of paradise do a great job relaying that summer feel in an original way. Smelled good, tasted good, and was very drinkable, not to mention affordable."
"D- easy to put these down and a nice beer from sam adams. I had a troegs hop back right after it. Not a good idea. the flavors really collided."
"I've been working my way through various summer beers. Most of them being some variation of an American lager (which is not my favorite) I usually end up disappointed. Not the case with Sam's Summer. It pours a hazy yellow, not as cloudy as the Spring White (if your familiar with Sam's Spring offering) There was a two finger head that quickly dissipated into a thin lace. The taste is refreshing especially on a hot summer day. This is one beer that I would definitely drink again. There is a taste (possibly the lemon zest) that I can quite place but makes the beer very appealing."
"D: Better on a hot summer afternoon than a night slaving in front of the computer, but it was here and it was cold!"
"On tap poured into tall narrow glass - tappered at top and bottom. Hazy body creamy head. Smells of lemony zest citrus and spice. Tastes as it smells but was expecting a little more substantial flavor - finishes quickly and dry. Nicely carbed with a creamy/grainy sensation. Drinkable enough - not very strong - but the spice seemed to tickle my noise (I might be allergic to their grains of paradise or it could have been something I ate) and I was left wanting more - just not necessarily another one of these."
"D: sessionable for sure, this is a light bodied, refreshing and uniquely flavorful brew that deviates from the norm in their use of ingredients. Nice job, and excellent execution!"
"Again a great beer that I like to drink but I consider this way out of style."
"Drinkability is moderate. Decent flavor and low alcohol make the beer sessionable. However, it is a bit boring."
"d: great beer for the summer. nice balance, not too sweet. what a summer seasonal should be."
"If you want a nice drink that is light at flavorfull, Sam Adams Summer Ale is just what you need."
"On this very hot and muggy July day in Georgia they seem to slide down pretty easy once you get past the initial taste surprise. Still, I won't go out of my way to get more."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Medium foam head on an only slightly cloudy body. Smell of citrus was immediate, with ""wheatness"" a distinct second. Something else in there too, something not so good, which came through in the taste: dusty, or moldy, maybe. May have gotten a bad bottle or something, but that taste was certainly unappealing. The citrus flavor was just about right, but the wheat was lost amid the lemon and dust. Also not as thick as other wheat's. Not too special, and certainly not among the best."
"D: nice and refreshing with a light body. I just got in from working outside for about three hours and felt that this was the best choice. definitely a good lawnmower beer. I might find myself kicking back a few on a hot summer night outside. nicely balanced and clean"
"I wish bartenders would stop putting lemon on the rim when this is ordered. ASK first"
"The beer pours a hazy yellow color. It had some head when I poured it, but it quickly disappeared. You can smell some spices and a subtle hop aroma. It tastes very smooth and light on the palate, with a soft bitterness in the end. I could also taste a slight citrus flavor. Its a good summer beer, very drinkable, as my roommate and I finished a six pack very quickly."
"Beer is colored in a hazed golden hew. Smell shows hops, but also a little spice as well. The Taste is smooth, with lite hops and easily drinkable. Goes down easy, with a very littly bitter aftertaste. Summer ale is a staple of summer drinking, and for good reason. Its light hop aroma and simple mouthfeel make it a good session beer for the summer."
"Got this in the Sam Adams Summer variety pack. This beer pours deep gold in color with light head. It smells of citrus, lemon, and I got honey as well. The taste is crisp with hints of lemon and orange and a sweet after taste. Its a smooth beer and very drinkable, especially on a warm evening."
"I would enjoy this again, although next time I would like it in the middle of the afternoon on a hot day instead of the evening. Overall, a decently drinkable pale ale with a bit of a twist."
"I liked it and I have never before liked a wheat beer."
"Fantastically drinkable. This is one of my favorite beers, especially on a hot summer day whilst barbecuing massive amounts of food. Certainly not a complaint, but if you're looking for a beer that will get you hammered, this isn't it. Sits too heavy on the stomach (for me at least) to drink massive quantities."
"Pours gold with a medium sized head, maybe a bit small for a wheat beer. Nice lacing though. A bit hazy but mostly clear. Very light aroma. Somewhat yeasty. Perhaps some light fruit notes. Taste is sweet but not too much so with a bit of wheat tang and lemon notes. Some spiciness in the finish. Little to no bitterness. Medium bodied. Not as much carbonation as some wheat beers but enough. Very drinkable on a summer day. Maybe a little subdued, but pleasant overall."
"light to mid body. good carbonation. drinks nice. i could drink many laying in the sun. good summer beer."
"I'm afraid this one just does not agree with me. Maybe it's just me, but the lemon/citrus taste is gnarly.Gave me a rotten case of heartburn, which I've never gotten from any other beer, even from adding real lemon or lime to Mexican beers. To me, doesn't compare well to the other Sam Adams brews I've sampled. Would not buy again."
"Tastes lemony upfront, finishes bitter and sour -maybe too sour in the aftertaste, but very refreshing and nice and drinkable!!"
"D: Definitely drinkable, great beer for the summer. I could definitely put back a few of these on a hot summer day!"
"Purchased in the standard Samuel Adams bottle. Poured to a goblet. Medium-golden color and minimal head. Extreme aroma of lemon. The lemon smell really came through with this beer and it was exceptional. It felt wonderful around the mouth and went down extremely smooth. It was extremely light-bodied and reminded me of a good pinot grigio. Definitely something I could drink regularly and something I would recommend to anyone wanting something easy to find, cheap, and very good."
"D - Nice on a hot day and easy to drink."
"Pours a clear golden color with a one finer white head that dissipates quickly leaving spidery lacing. Aromas of lemon, wheat, and some tropical fruit. Up front flavor of tropical fruit and wheat with some lemon rind bitterness and a slightly skunky aftertaste. Light body, medium carbonation with a dry finish."
"Flavor is better than the aroma.. but not a whole lot. Pale malts and wheat.. with above lemon and a background spice that reminds me of earthy hops... but not really hops if that make sense. Body is creamy lite medium and carbonation is fairly soft. Drinkablity is fairly high.. but I probably won't ever buy it again."
"Had on tap at Judie's restaurant in Amherst. Good appearance: murky yellow with some lacing and a decent sized head. Its aromas were strong with lemon and citrus. Also a noticeable grainy aspect to the smells. Taste included those hinted flavors but lacked the sort of breadyness I thought it would have. Still pretty sour and sweet. Mouthfeel was average, giving it a medium crispness that is not too harsh for summer days. Overall, it was pretty good."
"M/D - Chewy and a touch astringetnt. A decent summer wheat, but not my first choice."
"Overall a nice, light, refreshing summer beer."
"Drinkability is moderate, great spice and flavor profile, unique, can be a bit biting for drinking in larger quantities, refreshing ale that surprised me as i am not a huge fan of the style"
"D: Good for a one time try, but I doubt I'd purchase again."
"Overall an easy drinking wheat without alot of character is a great thirst quencher."
"D-Easy to drink but lacks a little flavor."
"D: I'll pass on this again."
"Latest of the Sam Adams seasonals, so lets see how this does on a hot summer night. Color is a hazy gold with a ever so slight orange tint to it. Head did foam up to a nice puffy white two finger length. Smells kind of grainy with a lemon tang to it. Can smell some hops and malt floating around as well. Taste is of a bitter lemon hop with a fading malt in the back to attempt to even it out. It doesn't work so well. Some sort of funk in the smell and taste that just turns me off on this brew."
"---"
"Very drinkable. But the carbonation may get to you."
"This is a great summer beer ( duh, it says so right on the label ) and it would also serve as a good crossover as well."
"D: Not sessionable."
"Feels smooth, crisp, and full, without feeling like a burden. Perfect feel for a summer brew, and combined with it's good, crisp flavor, it will make plenty of visits to my fridge."
"I got no qualms with this one. Sure, there are better summertime patio beers, but in a crunch this will do just fine. In fact, I can see this being enjoyed by the more casual crowd of beer drinkers as well as the more demanding aficionados. Indeed, come summer, this is exactly the kind of refreshing, endlessly quaffable ale one wishes were more widely available."
"Drinkability: Yes, i could drink a lot of these. No, I do not want to drink a lot of these. Sam Adams Summer Ale, you get a 3. Nevermind, the other wise man present likes it more. Sam Adams Summer Ale, you get a 4."
"D: Nice summer offering. I'd have to be in the right mood to visit this again, however. This is not your typical wheat beer."
"A good lookin' average beer."
"Light-bodied, started sweet and sharp with a slight bitterness at the end. Very smooth and goes well with summer. This is a very refreshing beer."
"While not a flavor bomb, this is a refreshing take on a much-maligned style. It would make an excellent lawnmower beer and hit the spot on what is the warmest day thus far this year."
"D: Brewed for session drinking. So far, the best of the SA Summer Styles."
"Different, which is nice, wouldn't buy again."
"I had this back to back with a Corona, and the Corona kicked Sam Summer's ass. Totally unexpected. I'm a Boston Beer Company fan, but their Summer Ale misses the mark, doesn't satisfy. They should take this one out of their rotation and push their much better White Ale more strongly in the market."
"M&D: Light bodied beer. The agressive carbonation makes it a bit sharp on the palate. I think there is too much lemon in this. But, this beer was one of the first to turn me on to the craft beer scene, so I search it out every year. I really enjoy Summer Ale, not the best of the style, but at 5.2% ABV this is very easy to drink out at the BBQ. Skal."
"Overall this brew was just way too tangy. I just felt like i was sucking on a lemon the whole time. Last years batch was way different. Note: 6 hours have passed and I still can't shake the tangyness from my palate. 2weeks later shared 6 pack with a freind at the beach but very drinkable in the summer heat."
"Bottle: Poured a clear golden color ale with a light foamy head with average retention and no lacing. Aroma of light wheat with some grain of paradise. Taste is a mix between some grains of paradise with some very light wheat. Taste is very dry with the spices also coming through. Light body with average carbonation. Malt base is just too light for this beer to be truly interesting."
"While writing this review in December of a ""summer ale", I asked myself whether it was a bit long in the bottle for a fair assessment. However, as the label specified that it was best before April 2010, I concluded that this must be pretty much what the beer tastes like and, with all due respects, I doubt I'd buy this again."
"Poured into a pint glass (from a Sam Adams variety pack) this brew has a pale orange color with a 1/2 inch head, leaving minimal lacing. I am not one for summer brews (seem to be marketed for the ladies) but this one was ok. The smell left something to be desired with mild wheat notes and some slight spice. The tasted was more than the aroma led to believe. It was a fresh brew with some clove and mild balance. The carbonation was more than I like, but this was a decent brew. On a hot summer day I could put a few back!"
"I remembered trying this last year and it being a great pale wheat; that isn't the case this year. Pours a orangish body with a great one-finger head that was very creamy. Picked up some citric notes and clove, among other spices, in aroma but kinda weak. The beer threw me off. It was smooth, a little creamy, had a nice taste, but everything was kinda blase. Had some orangish, citric taste, and some spices, but overall was a little bland and watery. Not a bad beer, but I can think of other summer ales this season to try first."
"D: An interesting mix of flavours, but just wasn't into it at the end, I'd choose others for a summer refresher."
"12oz bottle poured into a SABL glass. Pours a hazy straw yellow with a thin head that diminishes to a ring. Aroma is citrus hops, sweet fruits and a hint of bubblegum. The taste is an interesting blend of hops and wheat with just a touch of fruity spice. The beer is very crisp and refreshing with decent carbonation. While I'm not a huge fan of wheat beers, this one is certainly enjoyable and would be great on any hot Summer evening."
"It's not terrible, but it's also not special."
"Not a whole lot to thos beer. Good for hot summer afternoon when a thirst-quencher is needed."
"This beer is not what I expected from the description. Not very complex and the component parts end up being redundant. It is still a certainly refreshing and enjoyable beer though!"
"Overall, I had no problem finishing this, but it didn't really leave a lasting impression either way."
"Overall - A good beer that can be paired with a number of different meals or just a refresher on a warm day. This reminded me somewhat of the Shocktop Belgian Wheat, only better. Very good, will buy again."
"D - A fabulous summer ale that is very light and refreshing, and possesses a great balance of each element. I could easily have countless numbers of these in one go, especially on a sweltering hot summer day."
"Poured a golden straw yellow color with a slim amount of white lace and almost no head. Smell is very wheat with some citrus, and spicy notes from the grains of paradise. Taste is very much a wheat beer with a kind of weak finish. Mouth is a little carbonated, but nothing too heavy."
"I tried this beer on June 5, 2008 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto. This beer poured a slightly hazy yellow with a generous white head. The aroma was slightly wheaty, with some hops and citrus notes. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation and a dry finish. The flavour had a 'burnt' finish to it, and it was slightly tart on the sides of the tongue. I would not order this beer again."
"An old summer session stand by."
"Tastes of wheat, some spice and lemons. One of those drinkable and refreshing hot summers day kind of beers."
"This ale is certainly drinkable but I wouldn't seek it out."
"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass, looked a rich golden yellow with just under two fingers of white head which faded and did leave some lacing on glass. Didn't get too much as far as the smell goes but did have a slightly sweet odor. Tastes of refreshing wheat and had a kind of crisp taste to it, if lemon zest is in there it's hard to tell as I didn't detect it. Nice refreshing easy drinking summer beer, but I wish some of the other flavors in it were more pronounced."
"Taste is light and crisp, carbonation amount is just right, lemon zest hits the mouth first with a slight tartness, very smooth and easy drinking, has some subtle spices and can even make out some banana aftertaste, perfect session beer for the summertime BBQ-ing."
"D: Quite drinkable."
"A great summer session ale, perect for a nice day on the back porch while the wife mows the lawn and does all the yard work for you while you just relax. It's great for when you're not dreaming too!"
"D = Nowhere near my favorite Summer ale, but eminently drinkable. Good and refreshing, and complex for such a light brew."
"A pretty flavorful and supremely sessionable summer offering from BBC that most will enjoy."
"D - I had a few pints so it wasn't too bad, but uninspiring and forgettable."
"Poured into a Coke glass which somewhat resembles the Sam Glass. Little bit of lacing, color not quite as dark as I thought it would be. I like the lack of hops and the citrus taste. Not too crazy about the smell. Good lawnmower beer. Walk behind of course, no drinking and mowing..."
"i really don't know what it is about this beer, but i don't like it at all. from the tap it had a decent head and interesting aroma, but i didn't think it tasted good at all. i couldn't really put my finger on it, but honestly, i can't get into this beer. maybe i got a bad pint or something, but there was nothing remotely close to making me feel like this is a beer i'd want to drink during the summer. the spices almost made me not want to finish my beer, with an almost overbearing taste that detracted from the beer a lot and i had no desire to get another."
"Pours lemony orange with some white head that dissipates quite quickly. Nose is some metallic slight wheat and a bit of spice. Taste is very kolsch like with some wheat flavors and noticeable spice but lacking in both. Mouthfeel is on the thin side and very undercarbonated. Drinkability is good for hot days, and clearly a summer beer. Not the best of summer ales, but certainly one that is sessionable and much better than your average macro lawnmower beer. Another ok one from america's macro-micro brewing co."
"I poured this bottle into a glass. It had a cloudy light yellow color with a small foam that disappeared quickly. I would like to have seen a little more foam on this one. The aroma was very sweet with a strong citrus smell. The taste was very good. It tasted much like a typical American hefeweizen. Mildly sweet with a strong citrus flavor and a hint of banana. The mouthfeel was somewhat chewy (more so than Widmer hefeweizen), but not too thick. A very drinkable beer."
"d: These are great on a hot evening after a game. Not a darn thing wrong with these."
"MF&D - Medium bodied with decent carbonation. A decent summer beer."
"drinkability is pretty average, not much sticking to the palate to leave a craving for more."
"M/D: Carbonation is a bit prickly. Nothing spectacular on the tongue. Above average drinkability. Easy to go down but nothing great."
"Cheers..."
"Overall it was not terrible and i have had much worse, I just thought it was far too libght and really just a touch too bland for my tastes. A nice beer for tailgating through and in the more popular establishments, if this was all that was on tap, you could do far worse."
"Yes, a good summer beer. I wouldn't purchase this individually, but it was a nice variety in the Sam Adam's Summer Pack, which has a little bit for everyone. These are good beers for people just starting to get into craft beers."
"D- Lawn mowing, gardening, boat sailing hot weather, thirst quenching brew. Not my favorite Sam Adams but I wouldn't turn it down."
"Drinkablilty- An ok summer session beer. Not overpowering but not underclassed."
"A good looking pour, hazy golden with a decent head. The aroma is slightly malty with a good whiff of lemon. The flavor is lemony, a bit of malt. When cold, there is no hops complexity at all, though some gentle hopiness comes out as it warms. There isn't a hint of bitterness, however. I realize this is no place for a hop bomb, but a little bitterness, however slight, would have improved this beer considerably. The mouthfeel is a little thin, but not unacceptably given that this is intended to be a summer beer. This is an inoffensive, forgettable entry into the summer seasonal genre."
"D : On a hot summer day, it's a great beer to drink."
"Had one on tap last night. Had my first pint of the season when it first hit the market in 2008, and thought it tasted a bit off. But the few times I've had it since, I've enjoyed it. Pours with a cloudy hazy yellow, mostly opaque, and with a fluffy head. Smells a bit spicy. The taste is what you'd want from a summer beer, with citrus and spice intertwined. Very light in the body, which makes it easy to drink. No one wants a heavy summer beer, right? Overall, a good choice to have on a warm night, or before a softball game, in my case."
"This certainly is a PALE wheat ale. As if most wheat beers are note pale enough already. Pours a hazy straw and has an ample white head. The nose has some sweet wheat malts and light citrus fruits. The flavor profile is more of the same. Light body is over carbonated. As said, pretty light, even for the style."
"Not bad. I wouldn't seek it out, but I wouldn't turn up my nose at it."
"No noticable flaws, an overall good drinker."
"D - This is a perfect summer beer in fact I'm drinking this after coming back home from the driving range and its hitting the spot right now"
"D- Just washed the car, it has to be 97F outside. This is just what I needed. A great summer beer, in fact I'd probably drink this even if it wasn't summer."
"D - This is a decent summer beer. It seems to fit its marketed description. While I can't say that I'd go out of my way for this beer, it's a nice widely distributed option from BMC. This would be a great gateway beer."
"Cheers!"
"M + D: A crisp carbonation, more likely better fresh straight out of the fridge without leaving it a lot of time to 'open up.' Fairly refreshing, though maybe a little bit on the heavy side when all is said and done. I probably wouldn't avoid it if drinking another assortment of Sam Adams, but I'd lean more towards some of their other offerings over this one."
"D- I was really let down by this S.A. offering and don't see it being that drinkable. I could hardly finish the one bottle I opened."
"D: I like wheat beers and this is worth a drink, but I prefer more hefeweizen's then this, but not real bad by any stretch."
"Pours a light saison straw color. Nose is very light of wheat and lemon, somewhat false initially but expanding with hints of white pepper. No hops noted at first, with some noble hops arriving with warming. Delicate and spicy in flavor, the nuances of this beer are lost if consumed from the bottle. Not as sweet as it once was, the Recipe Roulette that is Boston Beer's mantra gets a thumbs up for this. But perhaps we should just call it a different beer??? Boosted from a C- to a B..."
"Had on tap at a local restaurant. Server who claimed to ""know his beer"" tabbed this as a ""Summer lager," which upon taking the first sip, it was clearly not. Was a very hazy, yellow color with a small head and minimal lacing on the glass. Not much of a smell - a little bit of lemon and grain. Taste is actually pretty refreshing. A zesty, citrusy taste that would be great on a hot Summer day. A very drinkable brew. Overall, not an outstanding brew, but a solid Summer beer nonetheless."
"M&D: Crisp, yet grainy mouthfeel with a high amount of carbonation, light body, and a lingering dry finish. It fits well with the beer. This beer's ""forced"" flavor keeps it from being highly drinkable, but it is very crisp and decently refreshing. I can think of many other lighter beers I'd much rather drink in the summer, though."
"I'm one of these funny people who can't find much to like about Sam Adams, but this is a surprisingly good offering; one of my favorite wheat beers. Refreshing and easy to drink."
"D: I found this brew to be light, refreshing, and easy to drink. Overall it's pretty good."
"D: Overall, this one didn't really impress me. There are so many better wheat beers out there than this one."
"Either way, I was kind of disappointed to see this coming from Sam Adams. I expected better."
"D: This is a very good summer ale. The carbonation makes this beer very refreshing and it is very drinkable in hot weather situations."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a short but medium bodied white head that fades pretty fast and settles as a film on top of the glass. It laces very nicely on the way down. It has an aroma of very sweet wheat malt, a tiny bit of citrisy hops, and a nice citrisy aroma to it. The taste delivers as well. It has a very nice sweet wheat base that is pretty easy to detect from underneath a mix of lemony and orangy flavors but finishes with a clean citrisy hop bitterness that is not overwhelming but very complementing. The mouthfeel was nice and crisp and refreshing which made it very drinkable. I will stock up on this beer at the end of the summer because it is very light and drinkable beer."
"D: Good for summer swilling. Easy to get down just lacking a bit in the nose."
"16 oz on tap. Pours a clear, light gold, with a thin film of head. Aroma = skunk :(. Initial flavor was sweet and citrusy. Flavor ends more balanced and with some spice. Light to medium body, light carbonation, limited lacing, and no hint of alcohol noted. I have had this before and I have enjoyed it before, but for me and my buddy, this was the worst summer ale experience we had have yet."
"Drinkability is fine - this is a low ABV and nonoffensive offering from Boston Brewing. In my mind, simply not one of their better efforts. For those looking for a summer beer there are better out there - Uber Sun or Dreamweaver Wheat are vastly superior."
"Slightly fizzy feel in the Belgian way (though clearly not a Belgian). Medium body. It's a nice summer beer that isn't for weaklings. Has good body for being a blatant summer brew."
"Last year this was my beer candy. I was just getting into craft beers and I thought this was amazing and completely unique. Since then I've expanded my knowledge a great deal and I didn't expect to give it a ovely high rating but it lived up to my recollection of it to a point, with only a few flaws. If anything I do remember all the flavors mixing together just a little better, but I still think it's a pretty good beer."
"It pours a hazy pale golden color with a thin white head that leaves behind some lace on the glass. Its aroma is has hints of wheat, citrus fruit and some spicy notes. It has a smooth medium body with delicate wheat malts and a zesty kick from the grains of paradise and lemon. The hops are very low key here and only add some light bitterness to the finish which is crisp and refreshing."
"D - A decent beer. I was expecting an attempt at a hefeweizen like other makers try to do with the style. Actually this beer is unique and easily distinguishable from a hefe. Good Job Sam Adams. Probably won't have again though, just not my cup of tea but good beer nonetheless."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a two finger off white head that fades to a ring on the glass and a small amount of lacing. smell of wheat and yeast and spice. wheat malts up front then some lemon comes through then the spice hits making for a great taste. mouthfeel light to medium, crisp and good carbonation make for a nice summer beer that can be drank in succession."
"D- A very drinkable brew nice crisp and sharp."
"D- This one is extremely light, and flavorful enough to keep me interested. Not a bad American wheat... a style I usually hate. Of course I'd rather take a German hefe over this... but I wouldn't turn it down."
"D- Very smooth and very little aftertaste. This beer would be great at summer Bar B Q's. I guess that why it's a summer ale."
"If you like the flavor this one is drinkable, I just can't get past the flavor."
"Not my favorite style, but this definitely works as a summer brew after mowing the lawn or working out."
"It's quaffable, but that seems part of the attraction, unfortunately. This is fine, but not one to blow one away. Fine on a hot day."
" Crisp and lively, slightly dry finish is perfect for summer."
"Straw gold color with a dense cap of foam that quickly disappeared. A light pale malt aroma. On the palate, slightly chewy perhaps from wheat. Mostly sweet malt flavors until it pivots into a nimble finish with little bitterness. Easily drinkable and a good session beer. Another solid brew from Sam Adams."
"D-Very high. It is a summer beer."
"Light orange colored ale with a aroma of wheat and lemony citrus.Taste is wheat and citrus.The bottle says there are grains of paradise in it.I don't know what they are but man this is good!!Like most of their beers this is another winner!! Highly recommended!!"
"Thsi hazy orange brew smells of wheat and spice. The taste is smooth and light. It's not a flavorless macro lager, but just a nice, easy drinking wheat ale with a spicy lemony finish. Great for drinking before, during, and after yard work."
"D- Drinks great and is quite refreshing in the heat."
"Flavors of banana, sweet wheat, very mild hopping, a lemony citrus, and a bit of spices. Spices seem to include white pepper and clove. Finish is bready with yeast."
"All in all, this is a drinkable sixer, tho not one I would rush out to buy again. The upcoming spring & summer months will bring many choices, and if BBC want to make people choose theirs somewhere other than a gas station or supermarket chain, they'll need to step up their game a little."
"**That extra 'B' is a typo."
"Good drinkability on this one, a decent beer to kick back with on a summer day."
"Flavor is politely tangy with a rich wheat component and a nice buttery mouthfeel highlighted by a mild peppery heat from the featured spices (Grains of Paradise). A little carbonation. Very refreshing and drinkable."
"D - This went down very easy, and reminded me of how much I used to enjoy these in summers past. Great session beer for the hot days ahead."
"Pours a hazy gold with fast fading head and minimal lacing. Smell: wheat, lemon, hint of spicy hops. Taste: sweet malt, wheat, lemon, crisp graininess, very mild floral hop presence. Finally got around to trying this one, pretty decent. Light bodied, tangy, crisp, and fairly refreshing."
"Worth a try..."
"Notes: I would buy this again and I intend to have more for summer. Not the best,but worthy. I do not think it is Sam Adams best beer-they can do better."
"This batch was a test batch and reportedly first of the season at Sam, so it wasn;t quite the same as stores will get in the spring. This is a great summer beer to have, as it's sweet, crisp and light, while offering a complexity that other American Pale Wheats of summer can't compare to. It's definitely got a time and a place."
"Light hazy gold pour with a smallish head in a weizen glass. Smell is lightly wheaty, a bit metallic. Taste is a nice light wheat, with a good finish. Wheaty taste up front is milder than it is in the aftertaste. A smooth, nice example of an American wheat beer that I'd buy again."
"D: While nothing about this beer was incredibly good or bad, I do enjoy drinking this (well, in the summer) and is a reliable beer at a chain restaurant in the summer and worth picking up a 6 pack for an outdoor afternoon"
"Very drinkable, especially at a ball game, or after mowing the lawn."
"Sam does a great job of a summer ale. A light golden color and a small but attractive top. Upon first taste, a nice light and refreshing flavor. From the first taste, you must continue and have a few of these. Grab a burger and fries with Sam Summer and you will be living the good life."
"The bottom line: A fine summer offering by the Sam Adams folks. Assertively malty with some interesting spice depth. Well worth checking out."
"Very murky, medium bodied ale. citrus/ spicy smell. Not my bag anymore."
"Medium body, medium effervescence with a degree of crispness. Taste becomes aftertaste and just slowly fades away with an excellent balance. I would definitely recommend this one, one of Sam's finest brews."
"Pours out a nice light, slightly orange color, a very nice summer hue. Has an excellent crisp and light smell, with a nice wheat aroma and hints of orange. A very nice summery taste, a light and crisp feel with a good wheat flavor, with excellent hints of orange and some slight spiciness. Goes down fairly smooth and is a nice drink on the porch at the end of a summer (or even fall) day."
"Tastes of lemon with hints of wheat. Very light in both taste and mouthfeel. A little on the thin side, but I can see enjoying these in the blazing summer months. A little too late in the year for this, but still quite pleasant."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability: The beer is far to thin on the palate. Sure pale wheats are supposed to be thinner, but this is too much so, and its got carbonation which I find is just a bit too much, making the thin body more apparent. The brew has a fairly dry finish. This is a beer that I won't buy again. To me there is nothing about it that makes it superb, that makes it really stand out....sure the grains of paradise are neat, but the body is lacking, and there are many that are much better and there are also those that are much better that are just as uniquely different too. Really nothing to write home about."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass... Had a fairly good head. Had the appearance of an orange drink to me. Citrus tones covered the smell. The taste has a slight lemon aftertaste and a piney taste as well. Might be a tiny hint of malt. Overall prett good lacing in the glass. Not too heavy and not too light on the mouth makes this offering from Sam Adams very drinkable."
"Drinkability - Not a bad beer."
"means try it, it's a competent brew."
"Poured it into a goblet ... It was to me ...""homebrewie"". Apricot on the nose. Fruity sweetness followed by grainy bitterness. A bigger body then needed for a summer beer. However the grainy sharpness WOULD cut thru a grilled burger and I would drink it if offered."
"Can drink several of these if you wanted to"
"Nothing too special about this beer. Just your typical summer ale."
"This is a very light blonde ale with plenty of carbonation and a nice thin head that doesnt fade away too quick and has a good citrusy aroma to it. It has some good spicy flavors in it, nothing too strong; it has a light lemony crispness throughout and has a bit of bitterness in its aftertaste, but nothing too overwhelming. Not bad over all."
"Sam Adams Summer Ale pours a cloudy gold with a thin but lingering head. Aroma is mostly spices, with a light malty sweetness. Flavor is crisp not sweet but not dry, the spices come through but not overpowering. There is a light bitterness, but no real hop flavor to speak of. I gotta give Sam Adams credit for brewing a cloudy wheat beer with some flavor for their Summer beer, a decent change from a lot of other pale wheat beer Summer beers."
"Hazy yellow gold. Smells of grainy wheat, lemon, some sweetness, and that Sam Adams aroma. You know what I'm talking about. Tangy wheat flavor, zesty and almost berry-like. Much better than I remembered actually. Lightish body - pretty clean and crisp. Its not going to blow anybody away, but its a solid choice for a hot day."
"Drinkability- A very light, drinkable summer beer."
"Had this at dinner tonight. I'm going to blame the lack of head on the bartender and I don't think I got the best pour possible, little bit of lace but not much. Nose on this was a little grassy and had a hint of toast with malts but not very strong at all. Taste was very good with the malty/toasty backbone cut by the hops but it was very balanced. The beer was carbonated to the right level. Overall I thought it was very good and it went well with dinner. I ordered a Guinness after this one...I should've stuck with this as it was much better than the Guinness"
"D: A pretty easy drinking brew. Light and refreshing body as well as a good taste makes it go down easy."
"Mouthfeel is light as you'd probably want in a summer beer. Drinkability is good on this one. Several of these could be entertained on a hot day."
"Drinkability: good summer heat thirst quencher. Fresh taste without too much body goes down easily."
"Did I get a bad six, cause GOD DAMN! This has the ingredients of the beer i had last year, but the tannins were out of control and I gagged very very hard on this beer."
"Eric"
"A yellow golden color brew with a thin but stubborn head and moderate lacing. The aroma is pretty weak yet hints at a biscuit-malt blend. The taste reveals a bready and kind of woody flavor. Sort of dull but with a subtle complexity. A little tart from tongue to throat with a bitter finish. Pretty thin stuff, not much body. It's OK. Fairly drinkable, however, I wouldn't be too interested in more than one or two of these given some choice."
"D- good for a hot summer day but once the leaves start a changin this will probably get pushed to the back of the fridge. even now i'd like an ale of this style which emphasizes something besides CITRUS!!!"
"As the label says, this is definitely a summer beer. Not a ton of personality to it but I guess I really didn't expect it."
"D: OK for summer -- light in body, low in ABV and pretty creamy makes it pretty quaffable."
"The beer poured a golden yellow with a thick, nice white head. Quite nice. Aromas of citrus, and bread - later. The taste was pretty much the same with citrus flavors, tangerine, and a slight apple in the finish. All this was wrapped up in a creamy mouthfeel with a dry finish. Quite nice."
"Easy session beer but is very lackluster overall, I have heard good things about this beer but wasn't impressed."
"Decent body and carbonation. Mouth seems a bit creamy. The husky element hurts the drinkability, and the refreshing character of the beer."
"Poured with vigor into SA glass"
"Overall: a quick read of the bottle sums this beer up quite well, wheat, grains of paradise, lemon. All the flavors are easy to pick out and strait forward. Simple beer that some may say leans a little too heavily on the lemon rind. Though I can no longer find much about this beer to inspire me to drink it, I do credit it as one of, if not the first beer I ever liked other than an American domestic pils, way back my sophmore year of college. Thanks for that SA."
"served on tap, this was straw in color with a bit of haze to it. smell was dominated by spice (which i thought was coriander until reading the blurb here), bread dough, and zesty citrus-not the usual sweet grapefruity citrus i am used to. taste was a light sweetness balanced by the spiciness that dominated this beer...very interesting, i did not expect this out of a ""summer ale."" mouthfeel was light and a bit puckering. decent drinkability, the spiciness makes it kind of snappy, if that means anything."
"I didn't like this beer, but this is only the second time I've been disappointed with a Sam Adams offering, so I really hate to give Jim a bad grade."
"Cloudy orange-yellow color. Minimal head. Light citrusy flavor. Not bad, but nothing special. Poured with decent head that did not stay around for long. Minimal lacing on glass. Fruity taste with tangy bite. I thought this was ok but not great. Sam Adams best efforts are with their dark beers."
"Pours a cloudy yellow, with a small white head that went away quickly. In the nose was a European pilsner hop, yet very small, and some sweetness. In the taste, I get a sweet lemon presence, and a dry finish. It is kind of sticky yet refreshing. Easy to drink, a decent summer ale."
"Tastes mildly sweet with a thick non-flavor umami (ie, protein) character. Flavor of a mealy orange could be from the hops. Strong fine carbonation fights flavors from being detected by the tongue and keeps the sweet from hanging. During the swallow, the flavor is fruity and a little bit floral from the hops. Aftertaste comes across as musky wheat (like rye without the zing). Md thick body seems less because of the strong carbonation."
"D: After drinking these I think the only one I'd ever want to pick up again is the Boston Lager, the rest are nice but don't seem as finished to me, all good or average but not great."
"I'll need to try this beer again. It may be possible that I got a bad bottle. I have a hard time believing that Sam could do such a poor job with such an appealing style of brew."
"Recommended"
"Great crossover beer for sure."
""
"Pours a pale gold that's actually a bit translucent--but not cloudy. Head dies quickly to a thin film. Decent lacing. Smell brings a touch of citrus hops. taste is quite nice and fresh. Lemon/citrus in up front but not overpowering and the malts are underneath with a solid backing sweetness: not too much not too little. Nice, crisp mouth feel with medium carbonation, but it's actually the sweetness that seems to linger. A tad more crispness might make this a more drinkable summer beer, but a good choice for a few with friends after work. In baseball terms this is a solid base hit, bordering on a double."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and clean with moderate carbonation. A good cookout beer. Fairly uneventful but of high quality."
"Overall a decent beer."
"The beer is very drinkable and on my first bottle, the lemon zest really came through. But as I continued drinking, the taste faded. This beer is drinkable but not something I'll reach for again."
"Nice fresh wheaty base with surpisingly dry but still refreshing mouthfeel and finish. Slight hoppiness to the aftertaste. Not overly special but still a decent summer selection. Light, airy texture that isn't too carbonated. A good choice for beach or barbecue."
"Overall summary: Pretty hearty for a summer beer, but pretty refreshing, too."
"After my initial experiences with the bottled version, I was quite pleased to find out my local Red Robin had this on tap. The server brought it out in a 22oz mug, color was clear yellow, with a strong (if somewhat small) head that somehow managed to last the entire beer. Scent was yeasty, citric, and slightly hoppy, with just a hint of spiciness underneath. Taste was very yeasty, much more so than the bottled version, with a bit of hops, just a hint of the grains of paradise, and a nice lemony zest serving to balance everything out. Mouthfeel was clean and crisp, very refreshing. Drinkability was very good, almost deceptively so. It would seem that I need to start trying summer ales now, having this one on tap sealed the deal for me."
"Drinkability - I wanted to give this 2007 offering a try as a possible summer beer. I've been partial to hefe's and wanted to see if this one would fit the bill. I'm not sure. So far I'm having to go with the Harpoon Raspberry UFO for this year."
"Pours a lighter orange color with good head but little retention, slightly cloudy appearance to it. Hops are present in the smell along with some sour citrus to it as well. Tastes pretty good, I didnt have high expectations but its not bad. Just like the smell a slight hops kick to it and the citrus is definitely present in the taste, almost slightly sour with a sweet aftertaste if thats possible. High carbonation and a very crisp taste leaves the mouthfeel light and a pretty drinkable beer. I would recommend this much more than there hefe for a Sam Adams summer beer."
"This brew pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is large and fluffy. it recedes slowly into thick lacing. The aroma is of wheat, lemons, and sweet grass. The taste is of tangy wheat, with the lemon and sweet grass coming in for the aftertaste, and sticking around for a while. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation. Overall, this beer reminds me of a wheat beer after it has been sodomized by a lemon, and I don't like wheat beers to be served with lemons. I will not drink this again."
"Oh, and I ""accidentally"" had to much of this wonderful brew...so I had to leave my car at B-Dubs. Thankfully my fiance met me there after work...so I had a ride home. Damn those big 23 oz glasses!"
"quite sessionable."
"This is an excellent summer brew that for me personally has that typical Sam Adams character. I poured it into my Weizen glass and it was a cloudy yellow color typical of many wheat beers. It had a mild hop smell with a stronger lemon/citrus smell. The taste was really smooth and the citrus flavor was pronounced. Overall, a good refreshing beer to drink on a hot day."
"I don't know what it is about this beer, but I can drink it all day. It's got a fairly unique and refreshing flavor, but it is a bit unbalanced. The wheat flavor is pronounced but not overwhelming. There are grassy and pine hops as well as a decent amount of citrusy sweetness. It's not the tastiest beer in the world, but once I get going on this one, they just keep going down the hatch. A great summer sessioner."
"Light bodied and carbonation was just about right. It's easy to drink 2 or 3 of the big ones at the local bar and grill."
"This isn't a bad beer, I wouldn't mind drinking one, but I don't think that it is something that I will seek out in the future."
"From my notes 5/25/07 - Pours a two-finger white head that fades quickly to a ring leaving some lace. Clear amber color. Faint wheat nose. Light-medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Flavor is light citrusy wheat. Clean finish. $5.50 on-tap 14oz at Houlihan's Logan airport Boston, Ma."
"D: medium-light body with lots of carbonation feels right for summer. Would go over well at a barbeque."
"poured into a pint glass from a 12oz bottle, it poured a very cloudy amber color that you cant really see through with a nice white head that retained fairly well. smell is citrisy and spicy. the flavor is very lemony with a nice balance of bitterness. has a nice medium bodied crisp mouthfeel to it. this beer is very drinkable, i bought a case not too long ago and it is almost gone, i will probaly wait until next summer to try it again."
"pours a slightly hazy dark orange color, has a slight head on it with a minimal amount of lacing. not too much going on in the smell department, some slight citrus notes but thats all i can pick up. Taste is pretty darn good, it doesn't hurt that i just got off work :), but has a nice unique taste to it, not like other summer beers i've had, it doesn't have the boring wheat taste. mouthfeel is full and right now i feel like i can drink a hundred of these. great deal as usual from sam adams"
"drinkability - Nice summer beer. I always enjoy the seasonal brews from Sam Adams."
"This is an extremely drinkable beer; I'd put away a couple of glasses before I knew it, and I easily could have knocked back a few more. I would definitely order this again."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, the beer leaves a one finger head with lacing down the glass. The aroma of the beer is quite underwhelming, as barely a hint of spice is noticed. The taste is crisp and has nice hints of spice and malt, leading to a dry peanuty aftertaste. The beer has a nice level of carbonation, and is drinkable, perfectly suited for this time of the year. Is it the best I've ever had, no, the worst, no. I find that this beer is in the middle of the spectrum for me, I would buy it again but only if in an outdoor setting where it would really shine."
"D: The light body, which is somewhat watery, makes for a good summer beer. This seems like it'd hit the spot at an outside BBQ party, as it's not too over the top, and is quite the thirst quencher. Its composition makes it very easy to drink."
" Once the taste for the brew is acquired, this beer is very refreshing and perfect for a warm summer afternoon in the yard."
"Easily drinkable but kind of boring"
"A good summer backup, no doubt."
"Taste and aroma very nice, but a bit fizzy."
"A decent sumer brew...went well with a grilled tuna dinner."
"This is part of the Sam Adams summer pack. Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer pours a light slighlty hazy gold, forming a very thin head, that dissipated quickly. Very light spots of lace on the glass. The aroma is a very interesting mix of wheat malt, hops, and spices. The aroma reminds me alot of the holiday releases by Sam Adams. The taste is a nice combination of wheat, followed by a slight lemon flavor, and finishing with the spices. Medium mouthfeel. A good abv. and smooth finish make this a very drinkable beer. Overall, this was a suprise. Most ""summertime"" beers tend to be weak and very lacking in the flavoring, but this beer proved that wrong. I think I'll be having several of these throughout the summer."
"This is another SA that I really enjoy!"
"overall this is a nice example of a Pale Wheat Ale i really enjoyed it"
"D- Very drinkable, of course. Made to enjoy several cold ones on a dog day here in South Carolina. I'll reach for this one when the heat index hits 115."
"A summer ale that really suits summer days."
"Great ale. Sam you did it again."
"Not at all a good summer beer. Will avoid."
"Pours a hazy straw color with a thick white head. Lemon and lightly grassy aroma. Taste is a mellow lemon/herbal flavor with a clean bitterness that lingers well into the aftertaste. Smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel. Easy to drink, and a little something different. Enjoyed after mowing the lawn on a 90F afternoon."
"Drinkability - Perfect for a nice light beer that won't slow you down. Also GREAT as an introductory beer to offer the BMC Crowd to entice them away from tasteless beers that are full of fillers."
"2007 edition. 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a hazy golden orange color with a white head. The aroma features malt and citrus. The taste is more malt and fruity citrus flavors. Overall, this is a pretty decent brew to down in the hot outdoors, but it is does not possess enough character to enjoy on a regular basis."
"This is a very good summer beer, and i have notices it is extreamly unoffensive to a non beer drinker. Poors a hazy straw color, with a deacent head that dosent stick around to long. Smells malty with a hint of spice. Taste starts malty and turns citrus witha good clean mouthfeel and finish. A good sesion beer for a warm summer night"
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a hazy bright golden color with a small foamy white head that quickly dissapears. Aromas are of very sweet citrus and some malts. Taste is a big dose of orange, some wheat, and some unwanted metallic elements. The mouthfeel is very watery with a good amount of carbonation. If I was in the mood for a wheat beer, this would not be on the top of my list. Average at best."
"This beer is decent, but its a little too subdued."
"Overall: Another good one from Sam Adams, nothing that will set the world on fire, but an enjoyable beer nevertheless. Worth a try."
"It hazy orange in color with a pretty good head. It glows in the rather dark surroundings of Roscoe's. Not much to smell but yeast, perhaps being too cold. The first half of the beer was boring because it was too cold. But as it warmed up, it got better. Some mango, apricot, yeast, pepper, and spice become noticable. Smooth and creamy from draft. It must be more refeshing when it's warm, because I consumed this after midnight, when it's, you know, cool."
"Taste is awful. Stale hops, malt, citrus. Nothing fresh or refreshing. Too sweet if anything. this must have been a keg from last year. It ain't good. Blah"
"Single 12 ounce bottle bought from Trader Joe's, bottle says best before August 2007. Head retention and lacing are both OK. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy yellow/orange color with an inch white head. It smells like lemon, grain and some peppery spicyness. The taste is pretty much the same as it smells, except that there's a slight tangy finish. Mouthfeel is light, and the beer is smooth. Drinkability is OK, it's easy to drink. It's a good choice as a summer beer, I think it could be very sessionable on a hot day. Not a bad choice at all, overall I think it's a decent, non-offensive brew."
"exceptional drinkability. Not impressive, but it's not suposed to be, just simple and good."
"Pours a color similar to apple juice. Bright white foamy head settles fairly quickly. moderate carbonation. Smells very similar to a witbier, but without the coriander. A little citrusy odor as well. Tastes faintly sweet, with a lemony bitterness and a faint malty sweet taste as well. Mouthfeel to me seems a bit syrupy, but other than that is very smooth. Very well balanced, very drinkable, easily more enjoyable than the other Sam Adams' I can remember trying."
"Pours a cloudy yellowish-orange with a white head that sticks to the glass. Smell was of fresh grain, lemon, and some spiciness. Taste was great, some of the wheat phenols and a burst of citrus and spiciness again. Mouthfeel was fairly standard for a witbier, a little creaminess and a drying at the end. Very drinkable on a hot day when it is served chilled."
"Light and refreshing, Summer Ale is best an inoffensive all-night kick-backer  yeah!"
"D- A great beer for your tongue to traverse and discover interesting and well blended flavors. Certainly one I would enjoy again on a hot summer day (or even a cool spring day)."
"Grains of Paradise? What are they? I don't know. Put them in a beer and the results are amazing. Each and every year I wait for this brew. Each and every year it is somewhat different and somehow better. Great in the bottle, better on draft. Excellent choice for mowing the lawn, or just being lazy on the porch."
"It pours a lovely, cloudy honey-golden with a nice thick head. Aroma is somewhat scanty but nice and malty, with lemony hints. Taste is smooth and malty with citrus overtones, as well as hints of hops and wheat. Laid-back and refreshing, this is a great warm-weather beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Very smooth and easy to drink. Definitely nice on a hot day. Very drinkable. Pretty good session beer. Overall, it's a pretty good beer."
"Drinkability - This definetly jumps to the top of my list of comfort brews (even above SA and Yunegling Lagers) and will always have a place in my fridge. Makes for a great summer outdoor/grilling brew and is extremely findable, this is a classic brew which also doubles as a great gateaway brew."
"Appearance is a clear gold with a slight head that fades fast. Smell has a citurs aroma to it with something weird? I don't know what it is but I think it is strange. The strange smell is in the taste but so is a good wheat flavor. Also some orange or lemmon flavor. Maybe this beer would be better if it was really hot out. All in all ok but not one of my favorite SA offerings."
"A hazy straw color with a nice white head. Looks like a summer ale. Nose is slight hops and slight lemon with cereal grains. Taste is mild corn, even milder hops, a slightly sweet toffee finish and hints of metal. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both average. Overall, a pleasant but forgetable beer."
"D - A fine ale indeed. Crisp and clean taste yet complex enough to keep you interested. Definitely a great summertime drink."
"Samuel Adams Summer Ale was a golden orange color and a little hazy. It had a white head that quickly became a thin layer. The aroma was lemon and wheat. The taste was lemon as well with a touch of pepper and a dry finish. It was medium-light bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability was good. It's a decent beer for a hot day, but not something I would want very often."
"D - Light body, relatively low abv, and refreshing taste make this beer good for an afternoon bbq or a long summer night session beer."
"On-tap at the Fox and the Hound in Philly, cause I've tried everything else there. Pours a fairly opaque orange-yellow color with a nice looking head.. Nose is extremely mild and straightforward citrus. Taste is similar, if a little stronger and more in your face. Feel is a little thin for the style, in my opinion. Overall, its an alright beer, but there's a lot better by Sam Adams and a lot better in this style."
"The taste this time was very wheaty. Somewhat harsh like I find other Sam Adams beers, but not horrible."
"Drinkabily is good as there is nothing here to offend."
"Maybe the best American wheat beer I've had. There's a tinge of vanilla, and hefeweizen spice to it along with mellow wheat and malt. Hops are present, though only an afterthought. All in all there is a gentle complexity that makes this a good beer. Not too dumbed down like most light wheat beers. Worth a try."
"D- Great SA brew. Great summer brew. very sessionable."
"The brew pours to a golden color, maybe a pale orange with a slight haze. Has a nice sized white head that has great retention and leaves a nice amount of sticky lace down the side of the glass. The aroma is very enticing, nice citrus (mostly lemon) scents, slight spice and malts (the much hyped grains of paradise?) which just seem to scream drink me during the warm months. The malt in my mind seems to dominate the taste with grainy flavor, little toasted notes. A fair zest flavor as well with lemon seeming to be the most persistent. An easy drinking brew which seems to go well while just kicking back enjoying the spring and summers warm months."
"If you want a high quality beer, go somewhere else. If you want a refreshing, ""are you sure it's not water"" summer beer, go somewhere else. Either way, go somewhere else."
"Drinkability - As stated this a good summer ale."
"Another beer part of the Sam Summer Pack. The Summer Ale pours a light amber color with a decent, frothy head. Overcarbonation? Anyway, the aroma seems light and crisp with spiciness. The flavor starts out malty at first and then segues into what appears to be lemon zest and the spiciness makes itself known. Goes down very smoothly and seems quite drinkable for the style. I think it is definitely a good beer for those long, hot days of summer."
"This beer pours a light amber yellow with head that does not lace. The smell is a little sweet and citrus-like. The taste is clean with citrus and the normal wheat malt experience. The beer is very crisp so it becomes very drinkable and very session-able."
"Good light body and bright and zesty flavor. Was surprised to even see this at my local beer store. It was a nice change from the Boston Lager. Nice lemony and orangy overtones and very smooth on the way down. Not as bitter as I had hoped but the sudden bite of zest at the beginning makes up for the lack of hoppiness."
"d - very enjoyable and a great summer sipper."
"Not a big fan of the taste though. There is a faint taste of detergent here, or some other lemon cleaning product. I can't detect any pleasant flavors. Even though the carbonation seems about right, the beer still seems flat, so perhaps it needs more hops. Or perhaps my palate and this beer just don't agree."
"Drank the beer on a hot summer day from the bottle. It was something that I would drink again but it lacks the real beer flavor that I have come to expect from Sam Adams. It is watery and it leaves you wanting more flavor. Its mouth feel is alright but again I expected it to be better. Overall it is alright but If I am really hot on a summer day I might grab the water first."
"Light and tangy mouthfeel. Easy drinking on a summer day,refreshing and enjoyable enough. American yeast characteristics clean, smooth no cloviness light on the spicieness."
"pours a hazy golden color with a two finger off white head that fades to a ring on the glass and a small amount of lacing. smell of wheat and yeast and spice. wheat malts up front then some lemon comes through then the spice hits making for a great taste. mouthfeel light to medium, crisp and good carbonation make for a nice summer beer."
"M&D: very light on the palate making it refreshing and easy to drink. I think it would pair will w\ some spicy BBQ."
"I really enjoyed this beer. It had a nice golden color with a slight haze. The head slowly disapated to a small head that just covers the surface. It smells of wheat, with strong undertones of zesty lemon. The taste comes on smooth at first, then becomes a little more robust as soon as your lips come off the glass. I liked the flavors of citrus and wheat. The grains of paradise add a distict zest to the beer, which makes this one of my favorite summer beers around. Very easy to drink (and refreshing), especially in the warm weather."
"A ""good"" beer. Goes down easy, refreshing."
"This is one of my favorite summer seasonals, as it's not too thin and watery, but it also quite refreshing and distinct. I've never tasted something with such an understated ""beer"" flavor. To quickly explain my rankings, the appearance is nothing special and the aroma is very unusual. I've found a lot of American 'hefeweizen's to be really thin and watery, and this is just not that at all. It's a full bodied ale that calls your attention and doesn't let go. And I had a 4 for drinkability, but when I didn't get through ""Smell"" without finishing the first 12-oz. bottle...it would be a 5 for drinkability but the ""unique"" factor has a tendency to inch its way towards ""cloying"" after a couple. Bottom line: perfect six pack with a partner or a 32-oz. bottle to oneself (I think that's what they come in...are those 40s?!) on a hot summer night when others just can't quench."
"Poured a hazy straw color with a hint of orange, nice soapy white head that dissipates into a thin cap. The smell is not very present, maybe a hint of lemon and a metallic twang. It has an American wheat base, with a hint of lemon and slight funk taste. Nothing fantastic but at least the hint of lemon is subtle. The feel is a bit too fizzy and leaves a dry aftertaste. This is a refreshing summer ale but does not stand out, drinks easy."
"Overall I was a little disappointed, I remembered this beer having a lot more flavor last year. It's probably just that my tastes have changed, but it's still an easy-drinking and enjoyable summer beer."
"Overall I think this is not a bad summertime beer. A spiced up version of some of the other American wheat ales."
"Not all that impressive. It's just not that flavorful. It's probably Sam Adams' weakest seasonal, IMO. Still, it's not bad. I suppose it's a good choice for summer due to its light body and taste. I'm sure it's a good thirst quencher. Quite average."
"Better than most macro beers but compared to most spiced wheat beers, this one is a disappointment."
"On tap. Pours a light golden color with lots of carbonation racing up the beer. No head to speak of. It has a thin mouthfeel with a decent amount of hops holding it up. There is an undeniable lemon zest on the finish. Its a pretty good beer, but its a little too dry on the finish."
"Taste features a slightly malty sweetness, with a pretty strong lemon pressence noted in the aroma, and pretty high level of slightly peppery spice especially for a summer beer, really a little more than I would prefer. There is a lingering lemon zest flavor on the palate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and pleasantly carbonated, at a good level for a summer beer. Spice brings drinkability down some. Not a bad brew, and one of my gateway beers into the craft world. Still I would rather other American Wheat beers."
"Pours a hazy tangerine with constant bubbles, and a massive, frothy, fluffy head that leaves huge raised lacing all over the glass. Smell reminds me of a fainter Boston Lager but with citrus and spicing in the way far background. Flavors are of pale malt, some graininess, wheat like cracker flavors, grains of paradise, and mild citrus. Finishes dry, with a little bitterness and herbal hoppiness. I think it tastes great, but it's all very understated. I wanted for more present flavors. Carbonation is very soft in the mouth and fluffy. However, this is a bit too light bodied. I'm not blown away by this beer, but it is really drinkable."
"Cheers!"
"Decent mouthfeel and good drinkability make this an across-the-board 4 for me. There's nothing like a clean and refreshing wheat brew on a hot afternoon. This would pair great with barbecue or burgers. I'll give it another go next summer for sure. Very crisp."
"D - Refreshing and very drinkable."
"'06, the taste was light - definitely not a hoppy brew, but nice on a warm night. Not sure what the brewer did, but the taste has changed (or I've moved to a higher beer awareness). Would not recommend."
"A deep golden color with a slihjt white head, that dissolves away quickly. A very strong bread aroma, followed by a bit of spiciness at the end. A very mellow wheat taste, nothing to overpowering in the hop area, a light citrusy taste. Very smooth and mellow feel, a little bit of a tingle at the end. This very easy to drink, solid flavor and very good feel, makes you want to drink several more."
"An overall good beer from Sam Adams. Its a refreshing wheat ale brewed with lemon zest that tastes great after one or two, but after a few, they loose their initial luster. Ive also heard its great with a lemon wedge, although Ive never tried that myself. All in all, its a good beer for those hot summer days when you need something that goes down easy."
"D- Goes soen easy, not a filling as adrks beers so drinking a lot of these would be pretty easy."
"Overall a very quaffable summer wheat."
"Bright Yellow and Cloudy orange in color with a half inch white head. Smells of lemon and wheat. Refreshing in yaste. Light with a full flavor of hops and wheat. Smooth drinking beer with good lacing on the glass and a good finish. A good and standard summer beer that won't fill you up."
"D- Not the best example but better than average. Very quaffible and refreshing. Good for at least one go round."
"Drinkability-- okay I've had one-third of the bottle in order to finish this review. The rest goes down the drain."
"Another good brew from Sam Adams."
"Drinkability: These can be consumed almost like water."
"A smooth and even creamy drink for a summer afternoon. A bit of spice but otherwise nothing above ordinary in taste. Nice wheaty head, with beige colour. Muted citrus taste and aroma. Quite consistent creaminess which may be popular, but for me worth saving to add to hamburger."
"If you like Bass Ale, you will like this for sure."
"D - This beer is quite nice for a warmer day, and is a pretty easy drinker. Pretty solid across the line."
"I enjoyed drinking this beer this summer. It was crisp and light wheat beer. The flavors of lemon and spice were well balanced. Great for serving at a summer cook out. This beer was closer in taste to a true weisse beer from Germany than the Samuel Adams Hefeweizen."
"Pours a cloudy golden. Thin white head. Not much retention, with a bit of lacing. Smell is weak,some yeast and spice. Body is light to medium, and carbonated. Taste is spiced with a pepper finish.This a refreshing, beer. Average in most ways, but worth a try."
"Kinda weird to put this Pale Wheat Ale as a summer brew. It is good after a long hot day but the lightier body isn't a good thing in my opinion. I just thought that was the only thing really lacking."
"Drinkability: An easy drinker, a decent beer and a nice one to have outside on a summer evening, but nothing here makes me take notice."
"Pours a golden copper in color with a surprisingly long lasting off-white head. Smells of wheat, hops, lemon, and slightly of yeast. Tastes a bit grainy, with hops and lemon dominant. Great mouthfeel, moderate amount of carbonation with good body. Good drinkability, very sessionable."
"Drinkability: As mentioned, a very easy drinking beer."
"D: This beer goes down very easily and is quite refreshing & tasty, well-worth staying with, especially in places where Sam Adams & Sam Adams Seasonal are your only choices aside from macros."
"D: Very drinkable, a perfect beer for a lazy hazy beach day."
"Summer's almost over and so is this beer."
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Color is a hazy orange. Solid white head, about 2 fingers width. Pulls back to a sticky lace cap. MSells like a standard wheat, grainy and slightly sour. A lemon flavor comes through strong, as if the un-asked for lemon wedge was laready added. Finishes with a dry wheat flavor. Mouthfeel is what it is. For being a very average wheat, this is pretty drinkable. Definately a good summer brew."
"This beer pours a hazy golden without much of a head to speak of, perhaps the pourer's mistake. The smell is of citrus and wheat beer, a delicious combination. The beer is fairly balanced, but I couldn't have more than say, two before the lemon taste started to get to me. A great offering from the Boston Beer Company, and one I'll have on any hot day."
"D: Not a bad refresher, but there are better brews for summer. I wonder if it's this fizzy on tap."
"Pours a light orange. Slightly opaque, but not dense. Nice lemony, citrus aroma; not overpowering - nothing special, but nice nonetheless. Head dissipated rather quickly. It tasted nice as well. A hint of citrus again, lemon and maybe some tangerine? Maybe a malted tangerine, whatever that tastes like. Malts were nice too. Not too much for a summer ale, but noticeably present. Solid mouthfeel. This is a great summer brew. Good for hot days after working in the yard, and just as comforting after a long day at the office. I think a lot of Sam Adams beers are unjustly criticized, but the fact remains that the brewery makes some quality beers. Their Black Lager is another example of an overlooked gem. Sam Adams Summer Ale is a brew that I'll revisit again next summer."
"I am, however, drinkig this in the heat wave of 2006 in Ala-freaking-bama, so perhaps I am just drinking this at the right time."
"Drinkability? High during the summer. In any other season forget about it. But, since Sam is marketing this as a seasonal, that's all I'm going to score it on. It's a great summer drink, bar none. It goes phenomenolly well with lemon lime chicken, and I implore you to try that. All critiquing aside, I just really like this beer and while not the best summer beer I've drank, it's probably the most drinkable...if you don't mind the peppery grains of paradise."
"D-The nice blend of flavors, and the fact that it goes down nice and smooth make this a pretty good summer beer."
"A basic and fundimental summertime refresher. Similar to a standard blonde ale (with a grain and pilsner flavor under a light, carbonated body). This beer has an added citrus (lemons) with a mild peppery, spicy flavor. A mild haze illudes to a very pale wheat addition that helps with a breadiness and sweetness that disquise the grain flavors. Still, the body fades into a watery brew fairly quickly, but adds to the drinkability. A mild grain, citrus, and hop character persists into the finish. It's ok beer, but I prefer many other Sam Adams' beer more."
"This was an easy drinking and refreshing beer, yet it lack of flavor and disappointing mouthfeel made it rather undesirable."
"Pours a slightly hazy amber, small white head forms, settles to a thin ring, some lacing. Smell is sweet, some lemon and spice, caramel and yeast. Taste is sweet up front, citrus and caramel, some spice in the finish, pretty dry. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium to high carbonation. Really not too bad, complexity is not its forte, but a pretty refreshing beer."
"I've had this before on tap and I remember it boring me, but this isn't so bad. It's certainly better than their hefeweizen."
"As far as drinkability goes... uh, yeah give me another on a hot summer day like this."
"Overall a good refreshing brew, I'm enjoying it in this God awful heat."
" Bottom Line: I'd highly reccomend this to anyone, a very well done ale and gets my two thumbs way up. ta ta"
"When I got it, the beer was a hazy dark orange color with a disappointing head of foam. The head of foam was white in color, but it had almost completely dissipated into some foamy rings and very little lace around the glass. The initial smell was just the faintest of hops, but when I swirled it around the hops were still there but with just a hint of fruits in the background. The taste was very crisp with a nice balance of malts and hops and with just a slight taste of juicy fruits at the very end. I enjoyed the mouthfeel because it was so crisp, smooth, creamy, and with an aftertaste of malts and fruits. This would make a nice choice for a summer beer because it was so crisp and refreshing. It's probably not the most complex summer beer out there, but damn if it isn't tasty. If I ever saw this on-tap and there wasn't much of a selection, I'd probably get it again."
"Mild wheat flavor with a hint of lemon. Finishes with an odd mouth drying quality. Not the best Sam Adams, with an offputting wrongness to it."
"A good hot weather beer. A bit too dry on the finish, left my mouth feeling powdery. Other than that pretty good."
"Drinkability/Overall: A unique marriage of an APWA and their Winter Lager. A Summer Warmer? Plenty complex, refreshing and innovative."
"Drinkability - this is good, goes down well, and is very sessionable."
"A category society needs, but being the snob I am, I can skip this kind of stuff. Carbonated lemonade would be too harsh, but you know what I mean."
"Let's make it country simple: summer is a nasty little wench. You sweat, the dogs get fleas, the grass burns up and your woman makes merry behind the bush with a man with muscles and tattoos and a goatee. Summer isn't for you. But being as misery is man's constant companion he needs something to knock back his head like a soft little hammer and bring on subtle displays of fireworks and enjoyment. Here's where Samuel Adams comes into play. You see, they make the best beer in America. I know all of these brew-gurus blast off little soliliquoys expounding upon foreign yeasts by companies with intricate brew talents and clever little brand names but these guys are the microbrew with the big company expertise in consistency and quality. Snap the top off this thing like one of those wax bottles of sugar juice you used to get as a kid and sop it up with your hot swollen tongue. It's like drinking nectar from a sponge with subtle hints of mushrooms? Yeast, fungii, rock candy. Stand back with your piss-pucker salute ye drinkers of Budweiser while I explode like a rocket over Damascus."
"I reviewed this beer served on tap, frosty cold in a frosted beer mug. It is definitely improved at more normal temperatures. The head is larger, hangs in there a little longer and the smell is sweeter and more pronounced. The flavor is about the same but a little stronger citrus/wheat/slight sweetness. Mouthfeel is about the same, rich enough for this style of beer. Drinkability is better at a normal temperature than frozen, mainly because the flavor is crisper and more interesting. A nice summer drink."
"Not a bad hot weather beer. Had several on the golf course a few days ago, but actually rated it today. Strong aroma of wheat and cookie dough. Pours to a hazy golden color, with thin white head and minimal lacing. Taste of hops and wheat in early bottle. Actually had a salty, wheaty taste at mid-glass, and okay finish."
"(Bottle was different than shown in the picture above, mine was the normal sam adams cover with a summer ale logo with similar colors) Pours a hazy yellow with a white head. Smell is mostly citrus, with yeasty characteristics and some wheat notes. Taste is very similar, mostly of lemon notes and yeast. The wheat lends itself to the infusion of flavors. It is a very light body with notable flavors that do not over power you but definitely show themselves. This is a great summer beer because it is light and very tasty when it is cold. The mouthfeel is normal with a bit of carbonation which doesn't take away from the overall balance of the beer. This is a great beer for a warm summer day, fits most occasions. I have enjoyed most sam adams selections and this one did not disappoint. I would suggest checking this one out especially if you are a fan of lighter wheat beers."
"Overall: To be honest I fancied a good but cheap brew from Ralphs last night. The change of label design had me pick up a Six Pack of this one just out of intrigue to see if the beer itself had changed. It hasnt. Nice to revisit it and a decent enough Wheat ale, but it is nothing more than a once-or-twice-a-summer pick up and not a regular one."
"This beer pours a hazy yellow with a fluffy white head that dissapaed to not much of a film and leaves a little lace. The smell is mildly of wheat with some citrusy aroma. The taste is also mild with some lemony flavors and slightly spiced. The mouthfeel is a little creamy with heavy carbonation. Overall highly drinkable summer beer."
"D: Great beer. Better than I was expecting."
"Maybe my girlfriend would like this one?"
"Smells lightly of lemon and citrus. Appears opaque, cloudy, and orange-yellow. A white head fades fast to nothing on top. This beer is full-bodied but sweet, light, and sugary. Lemon and other fruit flavors are apparent. There is an oily and rich finish with matching aftertaste."
"Cheers!"
"I've always enjoyed this particular ale, but this year it seems a little spicier than usual. I don't know if those are esthers from it being a wheat ale or if they are adding something more than lemon zest this year. But I like it. The mouthfeel is mellow for a wheat but not completely eradicated. The head is nice a lofty with some lacing. They brew it about 4 miles from here too so perhaps this is my first fresh Samual Adams Summer Ale."
"Drinkability: Accessible. Refreshing on a summer day. Jason called this a ""tone-downed white ale"" and I think that's a good description."
"Sammy makes some really good ones. Sammy makes some so-so ones. This is one of the good ones. Cloudy, gold and smooth in appearance. Head is decent, little lacing, but what the hell, let's have a swig. Light hoppy and malty flavor combine very well. There is that under-lying sweetness that is soooo wonderful in the summertime. Some fruityness. Lemon / Orange? Good stuff. Carb is really right - not too much. Drinkability? - drink it and then drink another one. If it's a warm summer evening - sit out on the dock by the river and drink another. Thank you Mr. Sam. Keep up the excellent work."
"Clear golden body with yellow highlights. The short but creamy white head holds fairly well and leaves some minor lacing. The nose is interesting with a hint of lemon and some wheat. Medium bodied. Crisp. The flavor is similar to the aroma with clear notes of wheat and a lemony side. Some peppery spiciness helps to balance the malt, and a firm bitterness backs it. Well-made, enjoyable, and refreshing."
"This ale is great for cookouts; however, the spicy tartness may leave the palate exhausted after a couple bottles."
"Overall: Not an amazing beer, but nice enough. Definitely good for a hot and humid day."
"Aptly named, this beer is perfect for summer drinking. It poured a light corn color and the smell of citris storms up one's nose at first whiff. Drinking, it's heavy on the lemon and orange peel. It's tart, but not overly sweet. Its very easy to drink, but the tart may get annoying after a while if the beer warms up. I found myself getting tired of the lemony taste after a while. Not the best summer seasonal out there, but as a Sam Adams beer, it does have the advantage of popping up in the majority of bars during the hotter months."
"Drinkability/Notes - I have a soft spot for this brew. It was one of the first micros that I feel in love with. Now I realize it is not the best or most complex, but still a solid brew. Highly drinkable and very enjoyable. Simple but fun beer. Always a hit at BBQs."
"Any easily quaffable brew. Think front porch, watching thirsty people walking by--here's the beer for that."
"This is probably one of Sam Adams' better offerings"
"12 oz bottle pours out an orange/gold color. It had a nice foamy head. The beer smelled of lemon and citrus. The lemon flavor was complimented by the wheat taste and a hint of malt. The mouthfeel was pretty good, slightly grainy. It is a nice light brew for summer and very drinkable."
"Goes down easy and a good choice for the patio."
"Drinkability: Although the peppery finish adds an interesting twist, this beer just doesn't have enough other attributes to make me want to have another"
"The aroma was great, lemon and grains with hints of spice. I hope it tastes like it smells... Ah, it does. Light mouthfeel that goes down smooth, not an over bearing wheat grain as I have not liked in the past. I really enjoyed this beer and will have another and can't wait to try others in this style."
"I always like season beers because if done right they embody and fit the season for which they are brewed. This summer ale is a good example of such. This beers appearance is not much to brag about. It has a hazy golden color with a full white head. The scent is a bit better, a soft wheat, citrus smell. But the taste is far better than its aesthetics. The beer has a delicious soft wheat taste followed by a crisp citrus aftertaste. The mouthfeel is also very superb. A very drinkable beer, even when fairly warm. Overall a very good beer and a perfect drink for a hot summer day."
"Cloudy golden orange in color with a foamy white head that falls fairly quickly. Grainy lemony citrousy smell. The taste is good. A a crisp, citrousy taste with the wheat taste only slighly noticeable. Good hot weather beer. These go down easy. Nice to have around throughout the summer."
"Smooth and easy to drink. Definitely worth a try."
"Poured a golden blonde leaving a thick white lace that stayed with the entire glass. The smell is sweetly laced, upfront is honey, wheat, and grass. The taste starts with a tart wheat twang that is pleasantly balanced by a honey, bready mouthfeel, that finishes with a fruit rind bitterness on the palate. Overall this is a great session, summer brew, not complicated it tastes great on a hot day not flavorless but nothing exciting as well."
"It poured out of a bottle into a regular pint glass with a nice golden color with about an inch of head at the top, a pretty good appearance. The scent had hints of citrus to it, possibly orange or lemon?? My first impression of the taste was that it was fairly crisp and went down very smooth...definitely something I could sit down and enjoy on occasion. I would say that the overall drinkability is good for this beer. On the whole, I really liked the beer. Killing a 6er of this would be an enjoyable task for an evening."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is light bodied. The beer has an odd buttery mouthfeel. The beer is drinkable and isnt bad. The beer doesnt rise to above average."
"Poured a hazy amber with little head. This beer was served very very cold. I know that wheat beers should be about the coldest of them, but this was almost numbingly cold. The first few sips were refreshing though. Because of the temp, it was hard to pick up on much in the nose beyond the typical wheat and slightly hopped smell. As the beer got to a normal drinking temp, I was able to pick up on more of the citrus feel and more of the hop florals. As far as the drinkability goes, this beer can be sessioned as easily as anything. I started and finished a session off with this beer and really enjoyed it at both ends. For what this beer is, it's quite refreshing and does the job as good as any."
"D- goes down pretty easy"
"Overall: This is a great beer to have on a hot day. I spent a year living in the Persian Gulf the base liquor store sold this stuff during the summer months. I ended many a day on my balcony sipping one of these as the sun set. Maybe it's those memories but I really enjoy this one."
"D: I'm adding a point because some people (e.g. my wife, who doesn't normally drink beer) seem to like this. But this didn't do it at all for me. If you like some of the weirder fruity beers (Magic Hat's #9 comes to mind) this might be right up your alley. But if you like your beer to taste like, well, beer, then drink with caution."
"I think mine was a bit too cold, which affected the mouthfeel and taste at first. I let it warm up in my hand and it became much more pleasant. The color is a fuzzy orange. The lemon is very prevalent in the smell and taste. The lemon flavor makes it refreshing, which is nice for a summer beer, even though I feel the whole ""summer beer"" thing is a bit of a scam. Enjoy."
"D: At first it as a big sour bite too it. If you let it warm a little you will do just fine."
"Overall, it's a really great beer but nothing about it particularly catches the drinker's attention. For some beers, however, that's a good thing. This would be great to drink on a warm summer evening outdoors. Very relaxing and refreshing."
"I drink the blue moon beer in the summer time and this is an interesting alternative -"
"Overall its a decent summer beer though more powerful than most other ""summer"" beers."
"One of my original gateway beers from macro to micro. Hazy, golden yellow color with a white head that quickly vanishes. Great aroma; very citrusy. Taste is refreshing, dominated by citrus and yeasty. Fairly tart, this beer is delicious, especially on a hot summer day in New England."
"Had this on-tap while waiting for my flight back from Detroit. This beer poured a cloudy golden-orange color. Nice head that left some lacing. The smell wasn't very strong but wheat and lemon were noticeable. Taste was very refreshing. Wheat, citrusy lemon and a touch of spice all balanced nicely. Goes down smooth with just the right carbonation for a warm summer day. I'm sure I will be having more of these as the weather warms."
"This on my top ten list for hot weather beers with flavor. These flavors include a sort of lemon-buttery character (that rather oddly reminds me of some lemon poppy seed bread I had the other day), along with a pleasant wheat maltiness. This beer requires a really strong pour in order to really get a good dose of its aroma, which as indicated on the bottle, is spiked with lemons. The carbonation is quite good and produces a large rocky head. The mouthfeel is quite smooth and adds to the incredible drinkability. Again, one of my favorite hot weather beers."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date. Was a nice cloudy, golden honey color with good head - looked like a good wheat. Smell was very average, on the weaker side. The taste was also really weak even for an APWA. Mouthfeel was OK. Think I'll stick to New Belgium Sunshine Wheat in this category. (2.5,RB,ML,O)"
"Drinkability - I don't see many positives about this beer and the lemony aftertaste ruins it for me. This tastes more like lemonade and beer."
"Not a terrible beer for a hot summer day, but not one I'd pick from a decent selection either."
"Samuel Adams Summer Ale pours a hazy orange with a fluffy white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Aroma seems to be dominated by wheat and a bit of citrus. Wheat makes up a big part of the taste, some citrus is present too. Some funky tastes too, not really off, just not what I would expect. This beer just doesn't do it for me. Your mileage may vary."
" nothing spectacular . though I' d drink it before any thing with ""lite "" in the name in your cooler ."
"This one remided me more of a Wheat Ale than American Pale. I associate hoppier beers with the American Pale style, which this one didn't have very much on the hop side. It definately had the unfiltered body to it, much like the Wheat Ales, so this seemed more of a Wheat Ale than anything to me. The taste was nice and crisp, something you'd want after mowing the lawn or any type of manual labor during the hot summer months. Seeing that I am leaving the Educational field for the summer and going to the Manual Labor field, I'll be drinking this one more often than not."
"Yellowy gold look with a small white head. Little bit of a citrusy scent. Very crisp wheaty taste. I don't like adding lemons to my beers, but it wouldn't hurt this one. For a Sam Adams it's pretty smooth, but still too carbonated for me, like most of their stuff I've had. Overall though, their Summer Ale is quite a drinkable beer. Great for an afternoon in the sun."
"Drinkability - will be good to have a few of these at an evening ball game."
"Beer pours a somewhat cloudy Amber color and has a nice think head. Not the best of smells, but if you can try you might be able to make out a citrus smell. lemon maybe? Its tastes kinda thick (not in a bad way) and has a very citrus taste. Not so strong that you can;t taste the hops, but citrus is no doubt the main taste you get. Very easy to drink and you can defiantly drink several of these in a row, especially after work on a hot day."
"This does and excellent session on those hot summer nights where you want something to quench your thirst."
"Drinkability is very good. I have fond memories of sweating in the summer heat, finding refuge in my basement with a cooler full of summer ale. On those days when it's just too damn hot to go outside for any reason, this is a great, drinkable beer. It also, as I discovered last night, goes well with nachos and spicy chili-cheese."
"Mouthfeel is appropriate for the style. Not too thin, but i'm kind of in limbo about it. Definitely meant to be a refreshing, easy-drinking beer (and it is) but I guess i'm looking for something more from it."
"I love Sam Adams beer because they have have such a wide variety of different beers to suit everyone's taste buds. I first sampled this beer on tap at the 2nd annual Blews n' Brews Festival in Fayetteville, NC. This easily became my favorite beer of the fest. This is a great session beer since it is sort of light. I really enjoyed the tase of the beer. The other great thing is that I can get this beer in a keg (Raleigh, NC) if I want to make the hour drive up there. I stock up on this beer every summer now and since it is semi easy to find here in the south, I drink this when I don't have my favorites on hand."
"Like many of sam adams products its decent but very standard run of the mill type stuff thats neither offensive or interesting beyond just a solid drinking brew."
"I took the Summer Ale in slowly to devour all its elements as it made me think of daydreams long since forgotten in years past. I also thought this beer would be great with Jamaican jerk-chicken, mustard-glazed sirloin steaks, and bunch of good friends sitting a round a picnic table this summer."
" I could drink a few of these. Actually this might be good with a wedge of citrus in it."
"I have never been dissapointed in a Sam beer. This ale has a great bottle smell. Poured into a chalice and it formed a nice frthy head that held up well. Color is a translucent maize. Smell is very whole grain with hints of citrus and pepper. Mouthfeel is great, different flavors from tongue to cheek to back of throat. A very talented ale. Starts sweeter gets robust then finishes with a peppery sweetness though not really sweet. A unique concoction. I will be back for more."
"I don't understand how Sam gets it so wrong with their main brand but rocks the world with their seasonals?!"
"Probably my least favorite Sam Seasonal, but still a good beer. Not my favorite style. Very drinkable, and clean."
"pours a hazy copper tone with a two finger cap. Fell into slight taverns leaving light lacings up side. Smell was citrus, biscuit, and yeast. Reminded of a witbier. Same for taste. Had grain, yeast, and citrus. Had a musty bitterness. Very refreshing beer, mild carbonation, and a little on the watery side."
"NOTES: According to the brewer this is not a Witbier, but an American Pale Wheat Ale instead. The picture of the bottle is apparently out of date."
"Witbier ehh? I'm a big fan of wits, but calling this a wit is doing both the style and this ale a disservice. Classification aside, this ale is a refreshing exploration of some unique flavors. The grains of paradise addition provides a crisp and refreshing complexity that is in the perfect amount: detectable, but doesnt demand center stage or overwhelm the other flavors of the beer. A well balanced crisp ale, perfect for backyard BBQ season."
"There are better selections for a summer day, but if offered, I certainly wouldn't turn it down."
"SA's Summer Ale pours as a cloudy, light bronze brew with a light foamy head. After several minutes the head dissipates to a foamy froth, and eventually leaves behind a thin lace. Seems they leave a little yeast behind to maintain a heffe weizen appearance. The malt is immediately present, but you can easily detect the lemon presence with a tinge of hop aroma. This seems kind of thin, and with plenty of CO2. This is a refreshing beer to enjoy on a nice summer evening. I'd give it another try."
"A nice presentation, but faltering delivery. Pours out to a hazed yellow color with a royal richness about it. Medium head of foam and medium low carbonation. No lace. Aromas of fresh citrus, grassy notes, and some wheat and grain. Taste was bland, and a definite let down; malt and weak peppery notes of citrus die quickly, and touches of hops and grain are noted in the mix. Way too weak on the flavors. Mouthfeel was like a b-rate movie. Doable, but boring. Drinkability is fair, but there are far better witbiers out there. Worth a try."
"Overall, this is a decent Wheat Beer, however not one of my favorites."
"D: A dead-average beer on almost every count, and yet I find myself quite enjoying it. Goes well with food or on a hot day. Good summer beer."
"This poured a nice cloudy orangey yellow with a decent white head. The aroma is fruity and sweet with definite hints of wheat, hops and citrus smells.Also in the taste we have the lemony citrus flavors which rock. Malt flavor is nicely noticeable at the end of the gulp. Nice and wheaty. Mouthfeel is weird, kinda heavy but in a light grainy full way. This is incredibly drinkable. Where this beer lacks is in creativty and complexity. How many beers have we had that taste EXACTLY like this? I have had a fuckload. But this one is one of the cleaner ones when it comes to taste. Very defined. A very pleasant brew that I wouldn't limit to a summer day."
"good beer, it does not fit the defination of a wit for me, it seems more like a spiced american wheat. but it is a good beer."
"Very tasty and refreshing, but the presence of the tannic note makes it a little less desirable as a session brew for me. Overall, a very good Wheat Ale. Perfect for a hot Summer afternoon."
"Drinkablity: this beer is very drinkable perfect in the heat, I love this beer like all sam adams"
"D: Easy to drink all day on the porch or at a BBQ."
"One of the more impressive beers that I've had from Sam Adam's. Most of thier beers are at least decent, but this one is actually quite good. I think I'll have to go buy another 6-pack of this."
"Overall this is a ho-hum wit (probably more accurate to call it a pale wheat), but what it lacks in subtlety or complexity of flavor, it makes up for in drinkability. I still could kick back and down a sixer of these without batting an eye. And if my Pistons make it to the NBA finals again, I might have to pick up a sixer of this as a good luck charm. For old time's sake."
"All in all, I enjoy it. This is one of the few Sam Adams varieties I haven't tried yet, like the commercials says, there are 19. This isn't the best, but it's certainly lives up to its name."
"Cheers!"
"Really, more of a slightly-interesting American wheat than a traditional wit."
"this was a bit of a disappointment, not much going on in the flavor department, the beer looks and smells nice though, unimpressive overall."
"D - high, easy to pound, would be mighty easy to kill a 30 pack of these on a summer evening"
"Pale straw color, small white frothy head. Smell is light orange peel with some yeast thrown in. The taste is a combination of dusty pale malts, spices, and zesty citrus. Light body makes it an easy drinker. Overall, it was a good thirstquencher and helped my burger slide down the hatch a little easier, but nothing too extraordinary here."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Very, very nice carbonation and resulting experience in the mouth... gently foamy on a good mouthful of beer."
"Ddifferent to me, but still drinkable. I can see this as a good pool side beer, but as I finished this one it started feeling a little heavy for a summer brew. To that point, about 1 more would be enough."
"12oz brown bottle with a best before date of August 06. Pours a cloudy gold/slight amber with a 2 finger head, good longevity and equally good lace. Smells of wheat malt with citrus and some spice. Not a big hop presence. Again good wheat malt with some citrus zing and twang. Hop presence is more detectable but still not a major factor. Spices are a bit odd but they do work in this beer. A bit thick but still very drinkable. Not a lawnmower beer but still a decent summertime ale."
"This is an excellent if not overly complicated ale. I had this on tap at the house of cues in Cleveland. Very yeasty in taste and a little more sweet than your average wit beer. It doesn't have the tangyness assosiacted with the style but is very smooth going down. It isn't too complicated overall but it is very good. This is one of those beers that you want to have a sixer of when you are out griling or just sitting in the backyard."
"This offering from Sam Adams poured out on draft to a golden color,slightly cloudy,yet appealing.The aromas were of wheat,citrus and yeasts as well as spice.The taste had many of the aromas listed above and you could really get the citrus or lemon in the flavor.The body was slighly thin and the head on the beer quickly dissappeared.This is a pretty good and refreshing beer,very good on a hot summer day."
"Overall a nice drinkable summer wheat beer from Sam Adams. Nothing I'd yearn for, a nice 6 pack of this would be fine for a summer day watching the Sox."
"Brown 12 ounce longneck with best by August 2006 notched on the label. Pours a hazy, light golden color with a nice fluffy head and good retention. Plenty a sticky lacing clings to the glass. Refreshing citrusy aroma with a little malt and dry yeast in the background. Taste is smooth and refreshing with subtle citrus and spice notes. This is a beer I could have again and again on a hot summer day. Did I say it was refreshing?"
"This pours a clear light yellow with a small white head. It's alittle disappointing looking. The smell is light with only a hint of malt sweetness and lemon to it. The taste is light and crisp with lemon,wheat and malt sweetness to it. The m/f is light and the flavors are well balanced. This isn't a bad beer, and like the label says not a bad summer beer."
"Ah, summertime, when the wheat beers come out, and body and flavor take a back seat. Maybe a little harsh, but I'd prefer an IPA or anything more like a winter brew. This beer was a cloudy orange with a small head. It had a sweet, fruity odor. It tasted of lemon, with maybe some hops in there (I couldn't tell for sure. An average, nondescript beer."
"Tried the just-released 2006 batch during a recent tour at the brewery in Boston. Overall, a very drinkable wheat beer. Visually it has a cloudy, amber color and a very mild nose. It still has the lemon zest taste it did last year, however, compared to the ""white ale"" we had sampled just before, the summer ale's flavors are mild in comparison. The finish is also mild, but does last. I can see myself drinking this beer on a hot summer day."
"I did not think that a SA got better than the boston lager. I was wrong, this is my favorite of a generally great line of beers."
"Verdict- Light and effortlessly drinkable. This is a good way to welcome the warmer weather."
"Good carbonation adds to the pleasant mouthfeel. Not a beer to seek out, but not a beer to turn down. Not as good as the offerings from Point or Coors/Blue Moon."
"This beer seems to taste pretty much the same from year-to-year, and it keeps well also, since the cases I got earlier this year were the 2004 edition. Recommended, regardless of what the score is on here."
"The spice is a little over the top and generic, and it's a little dry, but not bad. Better summer beers out there, and after drinking a bunch of these over the course of a few months, I don't want any more."
"Note-it's better on tap if you ask me. I've had it outta the bottle, and it is not as good."
"from the bottle. poured a cloudy yellow with a white head that didnt last but left some lacing. aroma wheat, lemon, orange, spicey. flavor, peppery, orange, lemon. nice clean and crisp enjoted this one. for a company that puts out a lot of beer they sure do a good job on their beers."
"it was my summer brew of choice in '05."
"Nice lil hazy chill, orange/yellow, weak head. Very citrusy with malt in the nose, and in the quaff the lemon mixes in well. Hints of spice, a tidbit of clove. Lite and tangy  great session bres. This one could have been classified as a Hefe, but still a pleasant Wit."
"Final notes: My biggest complaint about this beer is the sweetness/fruitiness flavor to it. I've only had Sam Adams Boston Lager and this and reccomoned the Boston Lager"
"Its alright, but nothing that I will go back to."
"Being that it is summer time I figured Id great me some local freshys. Around these parts Sam Summer reigns supreme. The style is a bit uninspired, but when its fresh there is not much more you could ask for. I had this beer on tap at Land Ho in Orleans; poured deep gold with good head retention, murky coloring. Slight fruitiness to close out the beer, beyond lemony. Great seasonal beer."
"initial sizable light foamy head fell to a quarter of its original size. hazy orangey-yellow with particles because unfiltered. left some rings of lacing smell of citrus (lemon) rind and some wheaty, earthy grain. unexciting tangy citric quality dominates the taste. . . a bit cloying. maybe on a killer heat day. otherwise a little wheat. nothing special. thin mouthfeel with little texture to entice the palate. only reasonably drinkable as a refresher at a scorcher of a summer grill-out or something. not terrible, but pretty average."
"Drinkability: There are other summer beers that are better than this. I expected a bit more from Sam Adams."
"Not bad... not horrible... probably wouldn't buy again."
"Better on tap than in the bottle, also seems a bit less sweet."
"I had this on tap at the South Street Seaport at the Pizzeria Uno. I had a very bad experience with the bottle version some time ago so I was not expecting too much. I was pleasantly surprised. Arrived at the table with half an inch of creamy white head over a hazy lemon yellow brew. A nicely done pour IMHO. The aroma was fruity, floral, spices and fresh hay. The taste was mild somewhat citrusy, faint wheat malt and short dry finish. Body was light. This is a tasty brew worth trying again."
"this thing was free, i would never have the urge to spend money on a 6 pack of these things when much better alternatives exist"
"Light mouthfeel that is what is expected per the style. I'm not much of a wit drinker, but I can appreciate a good dinner beer when I taste one."
"Overall I will still enjoy one of these guys on occasion - because I am a Sam fan, but there are a bunch of other summer ales that I prefer."
"Overall, an easy drinking, good summer ale for when you don't want to have to think too hard about beer."
"Not bad, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to buy a sixer."
"Light to medium body, medium-low carbonation. Definately not something I would drink a lot of, however it's a good start after a long day of work, something I wouldn't mind making a habit of buying in these hot summer months."
"Last swigs: Part of a mixed case that I picked up for some Summer fun."
"Nice summer quincher in the heat or anytime really. It poured a hazy golden yellow with white foam and a fair amount of lace was on the glass while drinking this ale. The smell of a mild, sweet hop filled the nose, along what seem like spicies. The taste was of a tart/sweet hoppy flavor along with spicies and a hint of wheat and yeast! Not bad for a summer quincher!"
"The taste is of light wheat malt with not much hops to speak of. There is plenty of citrus and light fruity flavor present, as well as some slight yeasty flavors. The sip finishes with a touch of hop bitterness."
"Poured a cloudy golden orange hue with a dense 3 finger head. Excellent retention. Lemon and wheat nose with hint of malt. The taste is strong with lemons and spice..too strong. It boarders on astringent and a beer with thick consistency needs more carbonation than this to have a smooth mouthfeel. The lemonspice bite leaves an aftertaste in the finish. The unbalanced flavor; and the low carbonation defeat the purpose of the refreshing witbier."
"Very nice summer ale, well made, and very sessionable."
"Drinkability: Smooth drinkin with no character. Take it or leave it."
"Pours a semi-cloudy, orange-tinged yellow color with a thick, frothy white head...a nice lookin summer brew. Smell is wheaty, with yeast and lemon peel accents. Taste begins with a light grainy flavor followed by a lemon and orange fruitiness (cant tell if it's the ale yeast or just some lemon shit they put it in), and a lightly spicy flavor reminiscent of a witbier (corrainder mostly). Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth as a summer beer should be, and the drinkability is very high. Not an excellent brew, but a good summer thirst quencher thats easily sessionable, especially in the warmer months."
"Age date was Aug 05. Poured a cloudly yellow with a very small head, with not much lacing. Bottle sez wheat ale brewed with lemon and grains of paradise. Has a grassy scent with a very nice taste. This is a very socialable brew, many can be had. Will I buy it again, probably not."
"Pours a cloudy light gold with a thick frothy head. Smell was a little bit fruity and a little bit funky, but not really a whole lot of either. Taste is the same way: a little wheat, a little hops, a little of the citrus and spice you expect from a wit, but none of them were really distinctive. Odd, watery mouthfeel as well. Easy to drink, but disappointing. Pretty wack for a witbier, but decent for an American Wheat (which is what the Sam Adams website classifies it as)"
"Despite the relative blandness the Summer Ale rates high for me in drinkability. It is very refreshing and light and goes down very easy. Good for a summer session while stationed at the bbq pit."
"This beer poured a very rich amber color. You can definitely taste the lemon/wheat in it. Has a very crisp taste to it, yet its very refreshing and the aftertaste sticks around for a bit. BUt I don't mind that cuz the aftertaste is great. Hurry up and get some before September otherwise it'll be kinda hard to find."
"Mouthfeel is very refreshing and bubbly and not too heavy- sticks around for a bit- is lovely. Drinkable for sure- I could have plenty of these. A lovely summer brew. Or any season brew. Try it."
"Body is light and seltzery, not bad for summer quaffing. If yer' looking for a witbier, stay away. Otherwise drinkability is good."
"Having just had a Moat Mountain Weiss, though different styles, I would choose the former for summer sippin."
"Drinkability wise, it's light and refreshing. It's lighter than other witbiers I've experienced which has its pros and cons. It's not especially interesting but it is pleasant. I'll try this on-tap next time I get a chance."
"Pours a cloudy golden-orange hue with a small flourish of a white head that vanishes almost immediately. Aroma of light sweet malt mixed with diacetyl and some background notes of clove, banana, and honey. Palate is mostly a tangy wheat, with some light floral hops and an interesting interplay of clove, coriander, banana, and honey. Medium-bodied but a tad watery, with little carbonation. Decent, but for a summer ale or witbier I would tend to reach for something else before this."
"The pour was rich and full bodied with a steady single finger head. Coloring of deep amber gold with a burnt orange hue. A nice smell of hoppy freshness wrapped in a blanket of orange cream with a hint of spearmint. I quite enjoyed the instant taste of wheaty citrus. The smooth finished accounted for an ale that goes down quick without realizing you have hit the bottom of the glass. The draft version is a nice compliment to a plate of raw oysters."
"Drinkability: Quite good. The sweetness takes a half off -- it might be a bit much after a few -- but otherwise a very refreshing summer beer indeed. Very well done; I think this beer is a bit better than a lot of the folks who have reviewed it care to admit."
"This is not a bad beer, it just isn't a spectacular drink I yearn for. Try it if you bump into it, but don't go out of your way to seek it out."
"Drinkability: I had one, didn't care either way for another."
"I wish they did. This beer is worth a try to see if you like it. Just not for me."
"Finger licking good."
"An interesting mix of flavors and definitely refreshing on a summer day, but nothing really to note. Either the citrus is a little too much or the other flavors don't balance it out properly."
"Drinkability: I was bored by this beer. There wasnt anything really all that out of balance here, it was just dull. I know this style usually produces a milder beer with more subtle characteristics, but I think this is a bit too mild for my tastes. I think a beer like Allagash White is a better representation of this style. This one is not worth seeking out."
"Much better this time off of the tap. A bit cloudy through the orange-yellow with a white fluffy head that held well. Smelled of lemons and grass, reminded me of Florida. Very subtle hoppiness with citrus, just acidic enough, and a sharp but quickly clearing finish. Felt just a tad thin but was very drinkable on that warm summer day."
"Overall: Pretty drinkable, if ordinary, summer beer. The best choice at the bar I was in, and I'd drink another couple if need be."
"I want to like this brew but the flavors just don't meld ... it just does not do it for me."
"Went well with a few burgers and my wife drinks it."
"I like witbiers, and while I am certain this was served colder than it should be, it was enjoyable. I can certain see people not immediately recognizing it as such. It did have more of a wheat ale taste. It would probably go well with summer style foods. I would drink it again."
"Overall, I would recommend it with reservations. It's a good starter to the Witbier style, but there are better examples of it. If it had a little bit more of a body to it, my style scores would go up. But it's a decent thirst-quencher."
"Overall, not something I'd be in a hurry to get back to again. Too much like an American wheat ale for my taste."
"Smells of lemons and cream. I would have expected this to be rather yeasty, but it isn't at all. At first there is some creaminess, and it feels rather watery, but then suddenly a rather fake but still pleasant lemon flavour takes over and is backed by a subtle hoppy bitterness and a grainy flavour. Not filling or overly satisfying, but it would be a doddle to knock back a few of these, so it makes for a good session beer."
"Poured a dark hazy yellow with a thin half finger of head that faded quick. Just a little lacing. Smell is rather weak, but is mainly of lemons and spices with a faint maltiness detectable. Taste is spices, lemons, bananaas, cloves, and just a bit of bitterness. Pretty well balanced and a lot better tasting than the nose would indicate. The beer was a little thin bodied. Overall, this is a decent spicy witbier--not something I'd go out of my way to drink but nice to have a pint on a hot spring day."
"Overall one of the weaker offereings from SA. Mildy refreshing with the citrus crispness it delivers but falls way short of a ""go to"" summer brew. As a side note I tried at two slightly different temperatures: it was much easier to drink at the colder temp. than the slightly warmer temp."
"Comments - Certainly a good summer beer. I say that it is worth a try, and probably at least a siz pack."
"Not bad, not outstanding. Refreshing I think might be the best adjective. Pours a light amber color, more on the yellow side, murky, with very little head. Smell is almost non existant, but I'm picking up some spritzy notes and spicyness. In the taste, there's a lot of lemon character and corriander perhaps, on top of a pretty well balanced spicy hop and light malt body. Mouthfeel is a little off. Drinkable and refreshing though, so keep some around for a hot summer day, though there are better options for the ""summer ale"" style."
"This is an easy to drink beer. Not as refreshing as I might want on a hot summer day, but I think it gets the job done. Not my favorite seasonal variety from Sam Adams either, but it is worth a try."
"This one pours a cloudy golden color with some orange hues. The smell is very fruity and citrusy. Oranges, lemon-lime, grapefruit, and possibly even strawberries are detected. It also seems to smell a bit flowery. The taste is not overly sweet like I had expected. Its very zesty. I taste lemons and limes, spices, and wheat grains. The flavor is very sharp and to the point, and the incredible zestiness is quite an eye-opener. The mouthfeel of this beer is great. Sam Adams' brews always seem to score very well with me in this category. They do an excellent job with the carbonation and creating the perfect body for a beer. Overall, this is a nice, good quality beer. I'll be sure to buy this one again a few times while its available throughout the summer."
"Overall = This is a very average ""good quality"" beer. Nice to have around for company but nothing at all for special occasions."
"It's like they received so many complaints that the beer was clear and crisp that need need to explain themselevs to the consumer. I just thought this was funny. Tastes like a wheat beer mixed with dishwater. Disappointing compared to the so many other great beers by the Boston Beer Compnay."
"Pours light orange with a short creamy head, a little bit of lacing. Robust carbonation. Aromas of nutty wheats, whiffs of citrus. A little subdued nose. Taste is good, not too strong, not too weak. A good balance of wheats with minor citrusy notes. I don't taste any spice in it, though. Seems to be more of a summer wheat ale instead of a witbier. But, very drinkable nonetheless. I'd definitely have it again."
"Drinkability: This was refreshing. It's lack of strong flavor works in it's favor here...it goes down so easy. Definitly for the summer."
"A witbier? I hardly think so. It pours a clear golden with light copper accents and a scant eggshell colored head. Pale malts, light wheat notes and a light hoppiness with faint citrus mainly makes up the aroma. Some husky malt astringency and moderate hopping raises further questioning on whether this should be categorized as a witbier. It's rather lifeless and bland. Better suited for summer, but even then I could think of a thousand beers I'd have before this."
"In terms of quality and enjoyability, Sam Adams beer covers a fairly wide range for me. While far from bad, this one is solidly in the bottom half. I'm not sure how often they change recipes, but Summer Ale is long overdue."
"I even checked the notch on this one, and it's December, so they can't blame this one on out-of-code...it's just not very damn good! I'm glad my roommate bought this 12-pack (and even he doesn't want another one), so I don't ever have to deal with this again."
"Bottle. Yuck. Cloudy orange colour is OK - neither sufficiently attractive nor sufficiently unappealing to draw much attention to itself. Aroma is pleasing - soft citric notes plus some cloves. But the taste is initially quite bland, then stunningly foul. Mouldy oak - possible oxidisation, but best before date is May 2004 - 10 months away. ecrvich also notes a similar experience. I can't get past that foul taste. And the after-taste is a long lingering peppery burn - no doubt from the grains of paradise. It's now creeping up my nose. By god, this is one foul, foul beer. Drain pour."
"Translucent straw in color, served with a very little white head. Very malty, and bread like aroma. The wheat shines through, with a sweet and clean flavor, malty and without hops. It's also without any citrus or spice as the style suggests. It should be listed as an American wheat and not a witbier. This is an okay beer but not one of my favorites from the Boston Beer Company."
"Nice summer afternoon brew, but not an earthshaker."
"I gave it a plus on drinkability beacuse it is a thirst quencher, but I'll pass it over for a good pilsner any day."
"And average beer at best. This one poured a nice orange color with a small white head that faded quickly. It smelled of grain and spice and not much else. The taste was decent but there was just too much of the citrus bitterness there to enjoy thoroughly. If it is on sale get it, if not do not pay full price for this one."
"I usually enjoy most Sam Adams seasonals. Unfortunately this is one that I wont be recommending. Appearance is the best part of this brew, dark orange, with lots of carbonation and a very good head. Smell seems off to me, though I cant identify why. Taste is, at best, interesting. Bottle claims this was brewed with wheat malt, lemon zest, and grains of paradise, but all Im really getting from it is the lemon zest. Slightly sweet, but mostly sour, there isnt anything special from the taste of this. Not especially refreshing either, a trait which should be a wheat beers forte."
"Bottomline: A rather unhappy marriage of that distinctive Sam Adams taste with the wheat beer style. I'd blame the citrus-ness of it as being out of balance."
"Had this on tap at Hard Times in Herndon, VA. This appeared a very cloudy golden yellow color with a slight bubbling coating atop the body. Not much lace was left either as this was consumed. Smell is a rather weak lemony wheat scent that has a touch of spice that peaks out from time to time. Taste is that of a weak wheat beer that has been watered down. The spiciness was about as minimal as I have ever had in a wit beer. Mouthfeel was thin and watered down a bit. It was refreshing and went down easy but after a 23oz glass of this I had enough of it for the night and switched to something else. I wouldnt really recommend this for a wit beer but it would be a decent macro replacement."
"A very cloudy amber ale. Pours with no head at all. The aroma is vaguely sweet but no particular sweet aspect can be determined from it. A very fruity flavor witha light hop characteristic in the background. The fruity flavor reminded me of mango. I could not finish drinking this. It was like drinking a V8 Splash mixed with beer."
"Pours a hazy light golden amber color with a white head that falls to half finger for ride down the glass leaving light lace. Smell is faint wheat malts lemon and light on spices. Taste is light wheat, sour then lightly bitter, get light spice flavors and a dash of lemon. Tastes like a good wheat beer that has been filtered a little and watered down for mass consumption. It is light and goes down quickly good thirst quencher. Body is light side of medium drinkablity is ok if options are macros but otherwise wouldn't purchase again. Picked up at closest grocery store to home hadn't had before so I tried it, damn BA always has me buying something new :)"
"This poured a cloudy golden yellow color with a decent amount of carbonation and a healthy head of creamy white foam. The aroma is almost like sour Lemonheads candy. Citrusy and sour. The taste is light and refreshing. Bittersweet with floral notes and small amounts of buttery malt. This is very refreshing! Sour and slightly yeasty. This is another good poolside summer beer."
"Ncie,cloudy,straw yellow color.Decent head that lingers all the way down.No real discernable aroma.Slight malt and spiciness but nothing special.Crisp and clean on the palate.Somewhat grainy flavor with a touch of spices and lemon.Average body-lends it to being a beer that is great for a hot day.Overall a decent enough beer-take some to a party with macro drinkers and let them try it on a hot summers day."
"If I wasn't totally exhausted I could have drank these all night, but as things were I only ordered one and went home to bed after dinner. Great summertime beer, but not my first choice."
"The taste is grainy, crisp, dry and refreshing. This tastes like a classic wheat ale to me with a lemon backdrop. Great for summer months."
"Appeared a pale amber color with no head but nice lacing. The aroma was very light... lemons and spice. As for taste it was slightly fruity and reminiscent of a wheat beer with a tinge of lemon and spice. It had a medium to light mouthfeel with good carbonation. It was crisp and refreshing and very drinkable. It wasn't that exciting for a wit (is it even a wit?) but one could easily enjoy many of these on a hot summer day."
"Sam Adams Summer Ale poured a nice hazy golden yellowish orange color with a sweet wheat aroma. A nice size head turns into decent lacing around the glass. First sip is a bit fruity and smooth. I like it. Definetly a good drinking beer. As far as wheat beers go this is one of the better ones I've had. It's not spectacular...but it's a good brew and I will be coming back to it :-)"
"Drinkability  With both the temperature and humidity hovering in the mid-90s, I was looking forward to a refreshing summer ale. This one just did do the trick."
"This beer should probably be classified as an American wheat rather than a wit. I would have rated it slightly higher."
"A little too heavy on the carbonation and body for my summer ale desires at the time."
"Pours an orangish-yellow color with a thin head and faint aroma. I really didn't pick up a lot of citrus in the aroma. I didn't expect a lot of lemon flavor as it's actually brewed with lemon zest which to me has a slightly different flavor than lemon. Perhaps that's what I was tasting because I really couldn't put my finger on it. It's not a bad tasting brew, but not one I would seek out. I'd prefer the Boston Lager or Boston Ale over this. It is refreshing though on a hot, humid day, but I think there's better choices."
"Someone said this years was better than last years and I have to agree. They have toned down the ""grains of paradise"" and citrus and given it a little more body."
"Smell is kind of crispy like the American light beers. The taste is sort of lemony w/hints of wheat. Goes down easy and pretty drinkable."
"Pours out a slightly hazy amber with a white headskie. Hops are light, but still add flavor. Malts are a touch thin, but still give the impression of a full beer. This is not a great beer, but it stands tall as a dumbed down ale. Quality is here, but the audience is not the BA. I'd have another, but not if there were a selection to choose from."
"Drinkability is above average...I'll buy again."
"Very drinkable. Quite good."
"Naturally, this is a better beer than something like Bud or MGD, but it's a lot more expensive, and for a specialty beer it's not that interesting. Doubt I'll buy it again."
"I notice that the picture provided of the bottle on this site is not the current look of this beer for Summer 2004, so note that my review is of a bottle that had a ""drink by"" date of December 2004. Let me state up front that I LOVE Sam Adams beers. But this one, not so much. It was very disappointing and is indeed, as Mitchster so ably pointed out in his review, it leaves a cardboard taste in one's mouth. Boring! Watery! The only thing that can be said is it may be refreshing, but is not much better than most Lite beers. Appearance is unfiltered golden orange, good head and lacing, light carbonation, aroma contains corn, lemon and faint spice ('paradise' is the spice, according to the bottle). Smooth mouthfeel, taste of wheat, honey and bitter herbal with a dry unpleasant finish."
"Taste has hints of banana encircling the crisp wheat malt. Spicy and quite lemony. Mouth is crisp with a long longering lemon flavor and a light bitterness in the finish. A very smooth brew and a fine (and perhaps underated) summer ale."
"Overall, Samuel Adams Summer Ale 2004 is quite excellent. I was very impressed. I am glad I made the purchase, and will do so again."
"i had this one a few years ago and thought that i would give it another go. it is a wheat ale. first smell and taste tells you that. smell is citrus. taste is citrus and a little hops. pretty clean and crisp. also a citrus taste to it. i think it is pretty damn tasty myself. but it is a little too much to be considered a summer to me. too filling, but hey, it does have flavour."
"This is the most drinkable wheat beer I've had yet. It has the characteristics of wheat beer, but the negative ones are muted."
"This was OK... but not nearly as good as their White Ale."
"At first, I didn't like what I was tasting, almost like envelope glue. I couldn't believe I was tasting this so I did a few more tastes and this beer is a light flavored ..hell, it was as advertised. There were a few stronger flavors that made the envelope flavor diminsh and when I had food, the taste got more complex. Still, this beer was thin and while average in drinkability, if you can get regular Sammy , choose that over this."
"This is in many ways a typical Sam Adams beer: unexciting but overall slightly above average. It is an unimpressive golden color with a little lace. It smells like a corny macro. The taste, however, is better than the smell. I definitely detect a bit of lemon and spice along with the slight maltiness and hopiness. The beer is definitely easygoing and agreeable, and I could picture myself drinking several at a summer barbeque."
"Note- This is a fairly mediocre beer by Samuel Adam's standards. Their similiarly styled White Ale is better than this."
"Light and refreshing tones of peaches and lemons with a pleasant spiciness. Very nice. Quit dissing Sammy, this is a keeper!"
"This is the kind of beer that I would drink straight out of a bottle, during a picnic or outdoor party, and Sam Adams' trademark low carbonation makes slugging it straight an easy task. When poured into a glass it's nothing exceptional, yellow with a small head. It doesn't smell nearly as spicy as it tastes."
"Refreshing, drinkable as all hell, simple... Not too shabby."
"There is a one-inch, almost white, coarsish, bumpy head. A slightly hazy, dirty gold body. Sweet, fruity nose with a sourish grainsiness underneath. Nutty in the front with some ripe fruit. Middle is fizzy, thinnish, still a little sour. Still, the sourness persists through the bitter finish. Well. It's not my favorite Sammy, that's for sure. It's a little worse than the average, crappy, micro American wheat."
"The first Witbier I think I've had that I can truly say I enjoy. A very good brew, and I'd definitelly buy it again."
"Pours a bubbly, rather hazy honey color with a one-inch whitish head. First to the nose is a lemon/bubble gum combination, a characteristic witbier aroma that to me is rubbbery in its more potent varietals. Though a bit flat in the mouthfeel, the taste is passable, particularly for a warm summer's evening. There is only a touch of hops, a few light spices, and a breadlike finish. OK but not inspiring. Too expensive (hence low drinkability)!"
"The taste is somewhat sweet but watery, however, it is fairly drinkable, especially at at a party. With Heinekin, Mic Ultra and Corona available, this was by far the best choice."
"It's not bad, certainly good for the season it's intended for, but I'm not going to knock anyone over to get at one. If you're truly in love with the lemon-hefe idea, just buy Paulaner and stick a lemon wedge in it."
"Overall I probably won't keep buying this one because Boulevard does this style just as good if not a bit better and is local and cheaper. But it is OK and worth a try."
"hate to rate a sam adams beer badly but you got to call it how it tastes, this beer in my opinion is not one of the better sam adams sesonal brews. looks and smeels nice, not watered down, has a flavor, just not a very plesent flavor i think. better than bud or corona, but i wouldent use it in the same sentence as the boston lager or the cherry wheat."
"Served at the restraunt on tap with no head and a slice of orange that I quickly discarded. Didn't need any fruit messing up the beer. Looks like a muddy carmel in the glass. Smells of hops and grain but very subtle. Nice mix of spice, carbonation, hops, and a hint of citrus. A pretty straight forward, almost simple beer. This is great on a humid summer evening. This refreshing beer really hits the spot. I wouldn't drink it all year round but enjoy this one at a cookout over some good conversation and you won't be disappointed."
"The beer pours a cloudy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a wonderful wheat scent accented with lemon zest; very nice. The taste is decent. It has a dry wheat flavor which is drenched with lemons; quite tart. It goes down slow and finishes bitter. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a unique seasonal. It has good wit qualities, but the lemon contribution is a bit much. Other than that, it's not a bad drinking brew."
"12 ounce bottle, with new graphics and purchase before dating notched onto label. Pours a nice cloudy honey color, white head, tiny bubble film, some lacing left behind. Flowery nose. herbal notes, yeast present. Some resiny hops in finish. Sort of non descript wheat/wit brew. Crowd pleaser for sure, on a hot summer day, but not really too interesting for a BA palate"
"Cloudy, golden tanish in color. Alot of carbination with a light head. Fruit cup scent. Heavy lacing. Nice flavor, first sip gives a slight bite. Light citrus but not too much as to be overpowering. Sam's Seasonal was my session beer for my Thursday night drinkin', and this one held me thru a good amount of months. Not too heavy as too keep from a long night of drinking, great with food too."
"Had this for the Memorial Day BBQ and it hit the spot, although wouldn't drink unless in the heat of summer. Poured a gold copper with a fog haze, head was decent, nothing spectacular, white lacing slopped around the glass with each gulp. The smell is of strong citrus with a robust malt, light and refreshing to the nose, very spring like, the taste is a average balance of malt and hop bitterness, the lemon notes are light, a strong wheat taste brings up the end, light and crisp in the mouth. A drinkable beer on a hot day but otherwise just lacks that smooth refreshing summer ale quality."
"This beer pours a hazy gold and has decent head retention. Lacing is scattered. Has a strong wheat taste accentuated with some lemon and grains of paradise. I don't know that I can identify the latter, but the lemon is some what noticible. Something about the overall taste profile I just don't care for. O.K. once in a while but I would opt for a lager or Sierra Summerfest any time over this one."
"I was dissapointed..though it could be drinkable after a hike in the hot summer sun or something."
"Absolutely nothing special about this ""witbier"". It arrived in a pint glass with golden color and slightly cloudy appearance. There was a minimal head. The smell is very mild and of a citrus nature. Taste is rather bland-a slightly citrus taste. Really couldn't taste malts or hops, or anything else. This beer is really not worth purchasing."
"Not a bad brew. Sort of bridges the gap in between straight ahead weiss beers and the usually knock-off American descendents. Complexity of flavor, and strange fake-banana qualities knock down drinkability."
"Dark gold color, big fluffy white head, that leaves sticky lace on the side of the glass. Smells light and grassy, lots of malt, and a hint of lemon. Reminds me a lot of the scent of a euro lager. Taste is very light on the palate, yet somehow sharp. It's a humid, rainy spring day, and this beer goes down nicely."
"The body just walked away rather quietly. I guess this means it qualifies as quite drinkable- for a summer thirst quencher."
"Had a few of these tonight for the first time. Very light beer with a citrusy/pepper taste. After a few I started getting sick of the lemon. Needless to say I wasn't blown away, but it's an average to decent beer that will probably be a lot better when it gets hot out."
"Pours out a cloudy orange color. Decent sized head but little lacing. Lots of lemon scent with spicy pepper overtones. The guy at the Samuel Adams brewery said the ""Grains of Paradise"" are an actual spice that is has a slight pepper flavor (and yes, that is the real name of the spice). The taste is average, dominated by lemon and pepper again. Could do with a little less carbonation. Not a bad brew, but I have to say, it's perfect for a hot summer day. Man, I can't wait to break out the grill on the back porch."
"Definitely someone's interpretation of a witbier. Strange stuff."
"Witbier? This is more of a Pale wheat beer if anything. Poured out a light gold color with a decent amount of carbonation. Smell was spicy. Some malts and wheat also detected. There was some citrus but very, very light. Wheat and malt set up the backbone of this brew. Some lemon mixes in the middle. Grains of paradise comes in the middle as well that lasts the entire way through. Some of that wheat stays through the aftertaste. Not a bad brew whatsoever. I don't know if I would call this a witbier, but not bad for the summer months."
"Pours a slightly cloudy yellow/orange. Smells of lemon zest and grain. Taste is similar, but more watered down than one would expect from its initial appearance. Mouthfeel is smooth, although lacking of flavor, which knocks it down a point. Drinkability is high due to its flavorless, watery consistency. Could be a great lawnmower beer, but I much prefer the White Ale as a seasonal. Even though it was only 9.99 for a case, I feel cheated."
"As for drinkability: Eh. I wouldn't refuse it - but I won't seek it out."
"Drinkability: I could drink this pretty often, but why drink this if Sam Adams White is still available?"
"Overall- a mediorce summer ale that goes nice on a nice warm day. Wish I had the Harpoon though."
"What the Hell did they do to this beer? It used to be one of my favorites, not anymore. The taste of lemon was overwhelming and I couldn't even finish the twelve pack. They need to get back to the old recipe (and label) because this new one really sucks."
"This seems to have changed a bit from last year. It tastes more lemony, especially in the aftertaste. Not such a bad thing, but I think I liked it better last year. It smells pretty wretched though, not sure what's going on there. It kinda smells like some cheap malt liquor, maybe Steel Reserve. I still enjoy the taste, and it's a solid summer beer. Drinkable all day long or until your throat hurts from the lemon."
"This has been one of my favorites for many years. It pours a slight gold in color with a thin head that dissipitates fairly quickly. The aroms is best described as bitter sweet. The taste is stroing in hops and the lemon flavor is more than just a hint. There is something else that adds to the sweetness. I want to say there is a little bit of honey, but I do not think that is correct. The beer goes down smooth with a quite pleasant aftertaste. This is a great beer for the summer."
"The aroma is sweat and spicy. The label states that it is brewed with lemon zest and I guess I can find a hint of it in there. The first taste doesnt really have much to it. Spicy and smooth. Finishes very clean. Very refreshing and great after my long day of playing pick-up basketball. The mouthfeel is thin, but suits the style well. Who wants a full bodied beer on a hot summer day? Very drinkable, but it leaves me wanting more."
"Typical appearance for a wheat ale... amber with a cloudy hue. Smells slightly citrus, but also yeasty. The taste is light and a little fruity, with some yeast typical wheat beer flavors lingering. Overall I think it is a solid offering from a great brewery. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but then again it should be! This is a thinner, lighter beer for spring / summer enjoyment...not a beer that feels like eating as sandwhich... like you'd want in November or February. It is very drinkable, but not something I plan on stocking in the fridge as a regular drink. Good thing, since its only available for a few months of the year. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves Samuel Adams (me) and likes to change what they drink to fit the seasons."
"Big fluffy slightly off-white head on a slightly cloudy orangy-gold hued brew. Bready, but citrus-y aroma, which the taste resembled. A bit thin body-wise, but certainly an acceptable offering from Boston Beer. Perfect sidekick for my late lunch with the family on a nice spring day."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with small white head. The head quickly turns into a fine sheet sitting atop the liquid, and leaves little lacing. Clean and crisp wheat aroma with a hint of citrus and spice. Malt sweetness and crisp, dry wheat flavors dominate this brew. Some lemon and spice are also present, along with the hops, all of which balance the malt. Finished with a dry graimy note. I did not find the lemon as overpowering as others. Medium in body and smooth on the tounge. Not as crisp as I expected it to be. Not bad, but nothing special. I'd rather a traditonal Wit."
"Light drinkable brew, good but pass the German Weizen please."
"Notes: I had this last night. It was a batch from last summer. I am quite sure it has gone bad, so Im not going to rate against it, as this was my fault. This is a great crisp, lemon beer."
"With the Sam Adams seasonals, I'm always happy to see the new one out on tap, becuase I'm usually tired of the previous one."
"A good choice in such a place. The nose is subdued, just a trace of weiss odor. Head is thin, becomes nice and lacy. Color is hazy yellow like a good wheat beer. Lemon taste is definitely there, some spiciness. Worth tasting in season, though not a ""craft brew"" type anymore."
"All in all, not a bad stab at the witbier style, a good interpretation from these guys, highly drinkable, nice job."
"The ""grains of paradise"" in this beer weren't detectable by me, and the lemon was very lightly done. While this wasn't too spectacular in any area, this was a pretty drinkable beverage and it fits the summer well."
"Great beer to have in the Summer time. Has a nice golden haze when poured and a thin creamy head. It's a ""light"" Summer beer that's nice to have after working out in the yard. Taste is a little strong on the lemon side but you/I can always throw down quite a few. Goes down very smooth. Nothing like having this beer during a BBQ and sitting out in the sun relaxing. I miss it...now it's onto Octoberfest."
"A hazy golden color with a nice foamy white head. This beer smells of wheat and lemons. The taste is even heavy on lemons. I hate having a lemon in my wheat beer and this was like they put one in for you. It is very light in taste and hops. I will say that on a hot day this is a good beer to have. I had this beer quite a few times this past summer at local establishments and while it is drinkable I would not say by any means that given a place with a good selection this would be the beer I would chouse. I would say that this is a very average beer."
"Medium gold color, small white foamy head. Aroma is grainy and sweet. Lightly malted, lightly hopped. Distinct kind of overpowering lemony taste. Light refreshing taste, not a lot of beer taste (hops and malts). Finish is clean. Aftertaste is lemony."
"A medieocre offering from boston beer, but not bad. Pours out a pale yellow with a little cloudyness. Smells of lemons and greenery. Has a somewhat smooth taste with very little hops, lemon is detected in the flavor as well, little malt. All in all average best describes this beer, but make sure to drink it when its cold as it sours a bit when warm."
"Notes: Taste much like a corona extra with a slice of lime, seems to be a good beer to get drunk by as it's easy to drink and all. Nothing interesting about the brew really, just another beer, not bad, not memorable, just another beer."
"Notes: Solid if unremarkable."
"It was light and refreshing. Had a nice flavor of wheat with small hops. A Very nice brew for the summer months."
"ng"
"Not as cloudy as the best white beers, and there is only a faint spiciness. I wasn't sure what type of beer this was ahead of time and couldn't tell from the smell. Hints of yeast and lemon make me suspect...ahh, so it's trying to be a witbier... A lot of carbonation in this guy, some lemon, more lemon, a little yeast flavor, spices don't let their presence be admired. Not a very good Witbier, but a drinkable and refreshing offering from Sam Adams."
"Pours a hazy golden/orange with a medium-sized white head. Smell is tangy yeast, with a touch of malts, and lotsa lemon. Taste is light grainy malts--not sweet, but a little medicinal--followed by sharp, sour lemon flavor and a slight bitterness. Acidic all the way, with lingering lemon zest. Very interesting. A little too much lemon tartness; reminds me of the lemon juice in the fridge. I prefer traditional witbiers methinks. A good summer quencher, however."
"Brewed with ""lemon zest and grains of paradise"" as taken from the bottle, there is definitely unique taste to it. I had this beer at a BBQ on a hot florida 4th of July and it was perfect for the occasion."
"Just got done golfing and these hit the spot..it's that type of beer...I am actually surprised I like this that much as my expectations were pretty low.."
"A nice dark yellow color, with a good, fluffy white head. Give it a whiff and it smells a lot like lemons. Very light, citrus taste, and not much else. Surprisingly easy to drink. This is the sort of thing I might like a six pack of next to me on a beach, sitting in some sun. I'm not saying it's a lemonade flavored beer, it's clearly a fairly serious ale, but it's a lighter, more frivolous ale. Quite fun."
"Overall, a decent Wit, but nothing more."
"This beer was golden yellow colored that had a brown hue to the edges. It was cloudy but carbonation bubbles were noticeable. It produced a fluffy white head that was thick and creamy, lasted fairly well, and produced a light lace on parts of the inside glass. The aromas that came from the glass were light, but I nosed lemon fruit, wheat grains, malt, and some spices. The flavors were slightly more pronounced then the aroma, tastes of light spices, lemon zest, bread, spices and malt were all present. It produced an aftertaste of mostly bread and wheat grains. It was light to medium bodied. Semi sweet and semi-dry on the pallet. Seems to me to be a simple wheat beer that has that something extra added to it. But it was a crisp, clean and fairly refreshing beer on the hot day, and that is what I needed."
"Poured nicely enough with a nice white head that quickly vanished. Real lemon smell with a little hops thrown in. Taste was not bad, but could only smell lemon, or something like it. Not a session beer, but good once in a while. Not worth what they charge."
"I really enjoyed this beer. Probally the best aspect was the mouth feel. A lot of pilsner beers have little to no body. This was totally diffrent. It had a pronounced presence, the way beer should. Other than that this is a fairly typical entry. However, I would recommend this to all the bud/coors drinkers I know."
"Yes, it's light alright. Can't recommend, as there are so many better versions of this style out there. pat"
"Slightly cloudy with cream-white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is slighty yeasty and slightly citrusy. Flavor is a bit on the tart side and crisp but crispness doesn't hold up well. Hops don't come through very well. I'm sure this beer is better on draught than bottled. This is about as good as Bluemoons version."
"I had high expectations for this one. This was a light bodied beer that looked nice. However it smelled real lemony, too lemony. The body was thicker than I had imagined it would be and also pretty creamy making it easy to drink. However the taste was not too good but also not too bad. It just seemed to be lacking in flavor. Slight hop bitterness in the finish, no real malt sweetness. A decent brew, but BBC has done better."
"Pours a hazy golden amber color with a tall foamy white head that settles into a creamy lace. Nose is grainy with notes of wheat and lemongrass. Light to medium in body and slightly chewy in texture. Taste is grassy grains and sweet malt followed by some mild spicy notes and citrusy hops that lead to an odd bitter twang and somewhat musty aftertaste. Seems to be a cross between an American wheat beer and a wit beer. Interesting and definitely worth a try on a hot summer day."
"this is a wit? oh please. not that this is a horrible beer, but i had it on tap and didn't even realize it used wheat. this beer tasted to me just like a lightened and citrified (is that a word) regular sam adams boston lager. it still has that familiar sam adams yeast flavor in it (which isn't bad), but there is nothing wit-esque about this one. appearance is way to clear and straw-colored. there's no spiciness (but there is some lemon flavor coming through). it's a nice refreshing ale, but is way way toned down from the usual conception of a belgian-style wit."
"ok, i had this on tap at the espn sports bar one night and thought it was pretty good but i was also already intoxicated which may be the reason this was such a dissapointment the second time sround. pours a nice somewhat deep golden color with a small white head. it smells like lemons with a hint of spice. taste, ugh....it tastes like an average beer that someone squeezed a bunch of lemon juice into. its not horrible, but it is pretty crappy. it just has this weird off taste to it. the mouth feel is ok, light and with a nice amount of carbonation. i would drink one if it was the only thing around, 2 if a gun was pointed at me."
"I am trying to be objective and I can understand that some people will enjoy this ale. I am sure much effort went in to creating it. Bleack! Just not my style of beer. Someone else review it."
"12 oz bottle. Poured a deep orange color, with very little head. Some very fine lacing can be seen. Aroma is citrus and malt. Taste is clean, with medium carbonation, and slightly tart. No detectable hops. This particular wheat is kind of thin and watery. There is also an acidic after taste that lingers on the tongue long after you finish. Not a great beer but not all that bad either."
"When I poured this brew into my glass it poured a medium white creamy head with small bubbles. The body was cloudy, and the hue was orange. The lacing was excellent on all sides of my glass. It had a light malty and lemon aroma. The palate was light and creamy. This brew also had a sweet flavor to it."
"This beer has a slightly citric aroma. The flavors is faitn with a very light wheat flavor. It's a bit bland. It's very easy drinking which I guess is appropriate for the season, but I kind of like even my ""summer"" beers to have more flavor."
"This brew poured a mostly diminishing fizzy medium sized head of small to medium sized white bubbles and a semi-transparent hazy thin light amber orange colored body. It had a moderate straw, bread, malt aroma with some hoppy and lemon notes to it. It begins somewhat bitter and acetic with a finish that's lightly acidic with an after taste that lingers around for a fair amount of time. Its palate was light and a bit dry while being softly tingling."
"Great semi-hazy golden in color, decent size white head that leaves sheets of lace in the glass, has a musty stale aroma of wheat and hay, light wheaty grainy flavors, watery and thin, fizzy and crisp mouthfeel, finishes crisp, a very average light ale."
"Recomended."
"I seem to like this brew more than many others,its on tap at alot of local places,so I get it alot.Pours a hazy orange/yellow color usually with a pretty decent head.The a roma is lightly spicey and of wheat malt pretty appetizing.Taste is very wheaty slightly fruity,I think its a pleasant highly drinkable ale,I think a bit underrated."
"This wheat ale had a cloudy orange appearance, with a very small head and little to no lacing. A fruity scent of citrus, faint spices and some traces of wheat was rather pleasant, but overall fairly average for the style. While the taste, too, was only average for a wheat beer, I rather enjoyed the fruity and citric characteristics. The malt and hop balance was nice, too. The mouthfeel was just right for the style, medium body with appropriate carbonation and feel. The Summer Ale was very refreshing on this summer evening. While I'd opt for a better wheat beer when in the mood for the style, this makes for a interesting and fruity substitute."
"Tasted: 06/08/03"
"A nice cloudy ale with a white head, this does look a little different than your average summer ale. The aroma was nice- a lemony sweetness, with maybe some other citrus as well. Taste was fine, a little more on the malty side then I would have expected. Whatever slight bite this beer has, is gone by the third sip. Overall a good light summer ale, probably also a beer to serve to friends who do not have that much experience with wheat ales."
"Cloudy golden in appearance with a thin and short-lived white head. Aroma consists of wheat with some hints of lemon. Mouthfeel is thin and crisp. Taste consists of a light wheat with a tangy lemon flavor that's quite noticable throughout. Somewhat dry and grainy finish. Has potential to be a pretty decent summer thirst quencher."
"New label. Zesty lemon taste and acidic aroma."
"Pours to a cloudy yellow color, with a white head that quickly diminishes. The aroma is grainy, spicy, with a slight citrusy, wheat aroma. The flavor is grainy, and spicy with the slight citrus hop flavor. It is light in body, not as smooth as I was expecting. This one just does not stand out in any area."
"Fairly thin on the aroma: not really anything too much to speak of. Taste has a little bit of malts to it, but no real hoppiness to it. Didn't really taste the citrus that they claim to be in it.It is a bit refreshing. Good, but a little thin on flavor. I expect something from 'Sam' to have a little more body. Best described as a ""chick"" beer."
"OK, this was available at the local corner grocery store. I was looking for a filler beer to have a few without tapping into my special stuff. The bottle is marked as good until Sep '03. I didn't bother to do a full review except for the taste. I was hoping for more grain flavor or at least a little lemon. I got a very bland beer without much flavor at all. The mouthfeel was disappointing. It was overly carbonated. This combined with the dry flavor to not be very refreshing at all. My patience is wearing as thin as this beer with Sam Adams. Not sure why my sample was more carbonated than other reviews."
"Appearance was a nice cloudy gold. I drank this offering a bit warm, so my review may change a bit when I try a cold one. The smell was a tad fruity, but a bit off on aroma. Taste was ok, but not as full-bodied and robust as I would have liked. Mothfeel also was ok, but a bit on the watery side. Average drinkability. Will evaluate once again under ""colder"" circumstances."
"Pours a pale hazy golden color. Aroma is lemony and spicy. The taste is citrusy, but seems a little water-downed. Not much flavor here at all. It seems like they're trying to make a refreshing wheat beer, but are also trying to cater to the average drinker by making it a little bland. There are much better examples of the style."
"this is a tasty beer, good for summer. this is one of my summer standbys, good drinakability in context of summer."
"This is a decent summer beer. Nothing truly fantastic about it, but good overall. Pours a pale golden color with a crisp white head. The aromas are light and citrusy, with a hint of malt. The taste is also very light, with a hint of yeatiness, but a strong lemon note. Mouthfeel is decent, sort of light and refreshing. Drinkability is very good, Serve this with some salmon or a nice summer salad, or just swig one down after mowing the lawn. A very enjoyable beer that is good for the summer months."
"Happy Drinking!"
"sam summer has lost alot of appeal to me the past few years thanks to bolder statements made by other summer micros. it's certainly not a bad beer, but nothing great. pours a slightly cloudy golden colour with a surprisingly strong head. smells of citrus with a lemony taste to it. the problem here is that this brew isn't anything daring. at times it even tastes a bit watered down. thanks to its widespread availability, it is usually a summer staple, but it's nothing grand overall."
"Certainly a refreshing addition to Sammy's line up. Not as good as the Vienna or Oktoberfest, but certainly a top 3 from this brewery."
"Pours out a cloudy hazy yellow with a medium froth. Aroma of floral hops, a slight lemon twist and a wheaty grain. Taste is smooth, hoppy a bit of malt but not much and a slight yeast aftertaste. Easily drinkable especially on a hot day at the beach. Summertime classic."
"A nice summer brew but nothing to write home about. Pours to a golden color with a slight haze with a bubbly white head that sits on top. Nice belgian lace. Taste is pretty straight forward lemony spice with a slight hop kick. I think that it's missing something though."
"On another note the artwork on the Summer Ale label is what lead me to become a collector of bottle labels. The picture along with the beer are the quintisential evocation of summer. Bright, full of wind and sails and ocean."
"Comes out with a nice fluffy white head. Golden in color, it is a bit on the cloudy side. Tastes pretty grainy, very much like most wheat beers that i have had. The bottle claims to contain a lemon zest and i can verify this. I dont think this is a bad beer, it will serve better under a nice hot sun. If you havent had it give it a go."
"I think i would grow tired of this after one or two, so the drinkability suffers."
"On Tap: Color is a pale dark yellow-orange with a big creamy, heavy white froth about an inch high and leaves some light lacing. Smells mostly of lemon citrus and wheat grain malt notes. Taste is about the same as the smell with a soild lemony citrus flavor fairly smooth and a light and bright hop with some wheaty yeastness thats a little uneven, but still pretty good drinking for a summer soother. Feels medium body sort of grainy and bittering of lemon peels in the holding finish. Its pretty good and refreshing, I wouldn't pass it up on a hot day."
"It's murky yellow/burnt orange in color with a very large fluffy white head that forms a thick coating after a few minutes. Lemon, citrus, and wheat are all in the aroma, lemon being the strongest. This is a very crisp and refreshing beer....lemon flavor mixed with a pleasant maltiness and graininess. The finish and aftertaste have a spicy hop character with a slightly annoying lemon tartness. Overall, it's a very refreshing warm weather beer."
"A nice, refreshing beer from Sam. This came from the tap a cloudy, light amber with a decent white head. It held the head for a while and laced quite nicely. The beer smelled fresh and clean, and tasted the same. Mostly a bready sense with some nice light citrus overlay. The feel was fairly light bodied and crisp in the finish. This seems as if it could be a good beer for a long haul. Nice."
"Not very fond of this one. Cloudy yellow with a decent head, but has a bitter, sour, lemony taste. Refreshing for a few sips, but then difficult to get past. Admittedly, I am not a fan of summer brews or tangy beers; still, it would have to be very hot in order for me to want another of these."
"This beer pours with an orangish golden tone with a nice frothing orangish white head that left me relatively quickly. Another sorry attempt for Sam Adams to make a classic style, it's not horrible it's just Sammed out. Has the same background flavors as many of their beers, which I am not crazy about. The aroma is full of the lemon zest aroma that is nice but the beer shouldn't just have the bitter taste of lemon zest. It cancels out the pleasure of the smell when you taste the bitter offness of the lemon zest. Overall not very drinkable or enjoyable for me. I don't consider this a true witte bit if I did it would be on the bottom of the wittes I have tried. Will not go for this one again."
"Taste is wheat at first with a lemon at the end. A dry crisp finish at the end. This is a lite refreshing beer on a hot summer day. It seems like I can drink it forever. I enjoyed the bit of lemon zest in the flavor. Compared to the other beers that I have had in this category, this is a light bit above average."
"The pours a cloudless golden amber color, the head generous in it presence, bright white in color, and the lace nice sheets to cover the glass. Malt dominates, crisp and citrus fresh, quite nice nose, the start malt and lightly sweet, the top skinny in feel. Finish is tartly acidic, hops quite pleasant and the aftertaste dry and long lasting, another good everyday drinking beer, well at least during the summer."
"A pretty good stab at the Belgian White style by Samuel Adams.  Although this beer poured a wonderful colour it did not really have the head retention that White Style beers are generally known for.  Also this beer did not have a very pungent aroma or strong taste, but what it did have was good.  Still this is a very drinkable beer, with a nice creamy mouthfeel.  Overall a decent job by Sam Adams on this one..."
"Rather malty for a wit beer.  The golden color is attractive but the head doesnt last anything like the head of hoegarrden does.  I liked the lemon scent, was different and alluring.  Of the barrel of wit beers ive tried this would be on the bottom, but it is still a solid beer, good just not great."
"The yellow label says it all. This stuff is just plain bad. A copper hued beer, the citris just overpowers the hops and malts on my palate. If I wanted a Corona, I would just drink one. BBC should not just brew a beer to get into a niche market without any thought."
"2002 edition. Copper color and a big white head, which takes a while to go down and leaves some lace. Defined lemony aroma with wheat-like malt character supporting it. Lemon and spicy hop bitterness combine in the taste and overpower the wheat-like maltiness. I find the lemon in this a bit out of place and overpowering. It seems to kill the other characteristics of this brew. This is definitely not what I'd judge this company by, in fact I'm surprised, I usually love Sam Adams beers."
"I am not a huge fan of wheat style beers, but this one is OK.  Personally, for a summer quencher I prefer a light lager like Yuengling Premium."
"For a wheat Ale, while refreshing and very tasty, I find it is lacking in the characteristics of the same.  Most of the taste is masked by the lemon zest which is ok for a nice summer beverage, though I would have preferred that at least some of the tart taste came from the wheat malt."
"Fairly busy aroma with aspects of wheat, malt, lemon and, other fruitiness, but also a characteristic Sam Adams quality.  Head a little thin and not that persistent.  Gold with mild cloudiness.  Drink has a nice thirst quenching quality and a flavor that, while mild, holds many tastes, including the base of wheat, but also some citrus acidity and a little sourness.  Fullness in the mouthfeel from richness and carbonation.  Dryness to finish, but not bitter.  I don't know that I would pick this all the time, but it's a nice offering and presents several interesting components."
"I am not a bg fan of many wheat beers and this is a solid, middle-road offering.  Dig it if you like the wheat/summers, otherwise, not much to offer.  Sam is still boss, regardless.  Cheers"
"Hazy ""wheaty"" orange/brown color, much darker than I expected for a Wit.  Creamy head that settles at 1/4 of an inch.  Citric and straw aroma.    Flavor has a deep character, an interesting ester-like quality combined with citron and a trace of nutmeg.  Transforms to a twang of lemon/lime at the end, nice swap of flavors.  I actually like this better than more accurate representatives for style.  Thanks, Sammy, for a more interesting summer brew than most."
"Wouldn't be bad to down quickly in the summer sun, but not something I would make a session of.   I'll take a traditional wit, thank you."
"Based on appearances, this would have been a great beer for me. Dark golden color with a nice thick white head looked very attractive. However I thought it had a very hoppy bitter aftertaste that didn't quite agree with me. Hint of lemon apparent in both smell and taste. I must note that I had this after another beer of a very different style, so I will definitely try again to see if anything changes."
"Prosit!"
"Good Stuff!"
"a great summer brew. it is second on my list to pete's. a kick of lemon. goes down very crisp clean and smooth. perfect for a barbeque on a hot day. very refreshing"
"Hazy gold color, rocky, tight, sticky off white head. Aroma suggests lemons, peppery spiciness. Flavor delivers much of same with some prickly hops. Smooth, light/medium bodied mouthfeel. It also sort of defies catagorization...probably falls somewhere between a Belgian Wit and a hearty American wheat. This was a pleasant surprise as normally I find summer brews lacking flavor and substance. An excellent summertime thirst quencher. Interesting beer...cheers to SA for creating a unique and inspired summer brew."
"I was skeptical as this was not my usual style but I promised myself that I'd be objective.  Wow, I didn't have to be simply objective, I loved it.  This yellowish wheat has a slight orangish haze.  Appearance is appropriate for the style.   The head is thick and white, retention is good and head life is average.  The smell is lemony but not overpowering.  The taste starts lemony, crisp, clean, and refreshing.  The wheat hop hits you but then finishes out crisp and refreshing."
"hazy deep golden color, almost copperish.  nice rocky head that laces down the glass.  definite lemony/peppery aroma.  taste is ever so slightly complex, teasing me with citrus, wheat, malt and spice.  it leaves me longing for more, but i shouldn't complain.  a hop bite in the end that lingers in the mouth.  a very refreshing brew that is light enough for the summer season.  would be great with some spicy barbeque!"
"Surprisingly refreshing!  Pours a slightly cloudy golden color with a 3 finger head.  It's aroma is slightly weaker, but consistent with it's taste.  The taste is that of a mild wheat and a fairly nice balance of hops and with alcohol on the tip of the tail.  The mouthfeel is quite nice for the hot summer days here in Texas.  I enjoyed this brew and for the sale price of 3.99 per six, you can't beat it.  Cheers!"
"I had visions of lemon Pledge before trying this, but it actually worked well on this brew. Not a favorite but I can see it being refreshing after a lawn mowing. Nice golden color and a citrusy aroma."
"Not a bad brew from Sam Adams.  I saw it on tap and was hesitant, but tried it anyway.  It is quite murky with a nice aroma.  The first taste of this brew offers a sample of things to come.  Tis is a nice and refreshing summer ale.  The surprise is the hints of earthiness within it.  When I say that, I mean wheat in this case.  Not too overpowering, but it is there.  A very nice beer from start to finish."
"Pours a cloudy light amber beer with a creamy white lace that sticks and retains well. Aroma is grainy, spicy and citric. Mouthfeel is creamy and coarse. Flavour contains dry crisp grain, lemon zest that lends a nice sharp bitter twang, and a soft touch of caramel and malt sweetness. Finish is grainy, faint musty yeast and dry with grain tannins."
"Beautiful color and dangerously drinkable.  Carbonation was good, but smell was unremarkable.  Taste is refreshingly light--a good *summer* beer.  If this beer shows up at a cookout, I'm a happy guy."
"Hazy orange body with nice, light carbonation. Rocky white head. Lemons and spice in the nose. Tangy, spicey taste. Wheat and spice dominate taste, hops and lemon are secondary. Lemon slightly more prevalent in aftertaste. An OK summer quencher, but I would prefer to have the Spring Ale available until Octoberfest."
"Colder is better! I had one at about 60 degrees and didn't care for it.I thought it was the wheat.I cooled one to 45 like Sam says-to. Iwaited for a hot day after mowing the grass.Imagine this--itwas good stuff! Crisp,drinkable and very refreshing.The lemon is just-rite for summer."
"A quality brew, as can be expected from Sam Adams, but one which I am personally not fond of.  The grains of paradise might be interesting, in a different brew, but the sour lemon turned me off.  I would not buy this beer again, simply as a matter of personal preference... others may enjoy it."
"In all aspects, you get a well crafted brew.  Aromas of whole wheat, spurced up with a strong lemony note.  Very pleasing for the palate, smooth and light bodied.  Soothing.  A true summer delight in every respect."
"Not that good, kind of boring really, especially for a wheat beer, it pretty much had zero flavour except for a bit of maltiness in the middle."
"This beer is somewhat cloudy golden in color, with a smell of lemongrass.  The smell reminds me somewhat of a seaside ocean grass waving in the wind.  The taste is somewhat sweet, with a hint of lemon, and spice. Chewey mouthfeel. An all around compotent ale."
"Just an ok beer, I really liked it much better last summer, before my beer exploration really started. Better than average, yellow color with a nice fluffy head. I expected a little stronger citrus floral smell. Tasted nice and fuzzy like I remember, but maybe should be a little crisper, more hops, for a summer beer. Still an easy to drink, refreshing summer thirst quencher. Easy to get non ba's to try one. I had it at the Atlanta airport, Samuel Adams brewpub, that could have effected the review. I think the Allagash is better in this style."
"I'm not he biggest fan of grains of paradise, but this is a decent full-flavored wheat beer that I'd pick over many other brewer's summer offerings.  And fortunately, a lot of non-beer geek people have this on hand in the summer.  That's not such a bad thing."
"Cloudy, golden colored beer with a thick, white head.  Perceptible citrus aroma and taste.  Also has perceptible light hopping and wheat character.  Very pleasant on a sunny spring day."
"I was pretty excited to see a Sam Adams Belgian Wit style brew.  As other reviewers have noted this just doesn't get the job done for that.  I really have no idea what 'grains of paradise' are and I don't really detect any spice in this beer to speak of.  Nevertheless, it's a very enjoyable easy-drinker.  Enough hoppiness to give it a good dry finish.  There is a certain amount of  sweetness from the wheat and a soft, persistent head and lace to the bottom of the glass.  I found it quite tasty, probably great with barbecue or mexican food.... it's just not really what I was hoping for in a Belgian Wit style."
"i must have gotten a bad bottle of this because the pour gave no head like a date with a nun. the taste was nothing to write home about either. another example on why i stockpile my favorite winter seasonals for when this time a year roles around."
"Pours hazy light golden with a sticky white head.  Nice aroma of malted wheat and vanilla.  Nice malty wheat backbone.  Tangy taste.  A bit of lemon.  I do get somewhat of a bite in this one too.  Similar to the nice hop bite you'll find in properly brewed European Pilseners, but not as harsh.  A case of these would be a nice way to fill up the poolside cooler."
"Cool Winslow Homer on the bottle though."
"Is this actually supposed to be a wit???  Pours a perfectly clear? straw color with a nice whit head that sticks around nicely.  Smell is very weak and almost completely of lemon, faint wheat and yeast aromas.  There is so much lemon in this brew that it almost makes my mouth pucker when I drink it.  There are some vague wheat flavors in the brew and no discernable yeast or spice flavors.  Somewhat creamy but not nearly as it should be for the style.  Somewhat drinkable.  When Coors can make a better wit (Blue Moon) than Sam Adams something is very wrong.  I more than likely won't purchase this again."
"Pours an off-white cloudy color. On the nose there is aromas of wheat malt and lemon zest. The same two things lemon and wheat malt on the palate too. Im not a big on wheats, but 2 or 3 on a nice warm day served ice cold, does the trick. Nice summer quencher, I actually prefer to be eating something while drinking these types of beers, but overall not to shabby for a wheat brew"
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a decent and rather sticky white head and moderate lace.  Strong aromas of wheat, lemon and spices.  Upon tasting, malt notes assert themselves very briefly, followed by lemon and spices and a hoppy finish.  A refreshing summer beer."
"Attractive and dense white head. Cloudy light orange in hue. Grainy, lemony, slightly phenolic aroma. Subtle coriander is present as well. Definitely more mild in aroma that most Wits. Surprisingly bland in flavor-- complexity added by the yeast is sorely lacking in this brew. Spice flavor is quite minimal, but a touch of bitter orange peel is there. The mouthfeel is fairly silky and the medium body is perhaps due to the use of oats. Finishes w/ wheat tartness w/ not much else. A bit dissapointing. It's a dumbened down version of a Wit. Hand me a Vuuve now!"
"A decent offering from the Boston Beer Co.  I'll pick up a sixer of this from time to time during the summer.  There is just a touch too much lemon-taste on the finish, but it is a crisp, easy to drink brew."
"The lemon and wheat work well against each other. This is a refreshing, thirst-quenching beer. Doesn't do much to advance the wit style, in fact I don't think it has much in common. Still a pleasant brew, not one that bears much scrutiny, but fine for simple quaffing. Doesn't stand up to much in the way of flavorful food, but could be enjoyed with very light fare like a salad or something."
"Sam Adams Summer Ale for 2002.  Considering that we are about 10 days into spring around here, seems a little early to have this seasonal released.  This is a wheat beer based on a Belgian White Ale (according to the label).  Compared to last years, seems significantly darker, and I seem to recall that last years had more of a weiss haze.  White, dense head. Very pronounced lemon aroma and taste.  I'll enjoy this beer all Summer long."
"mmmmm...summer beers...nothing like watching a redsox game and knocking back a couple of 'em. I have two Summer ale favourites and this is definatley one of them."
"good bbq beer"
"I probably would have liked this ale more if the label had not lead me to expect a spiced white ale.  Overall, it seemed too restrained.  What the heck are ""Grains of Paradise"" anyway?"
