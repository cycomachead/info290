"Serving type: bottle"
"Pours a hazy gold, producing a somewhat lasting, foamy, white head that leaves slim motes, streaks & wisps of lace. Aroma is sweet wheat, lemony citrus & a hint of grass. Taste is a tug-of-war between wheat, lemon & mineral water prickly carbonation with hint of grain & grass. Tongue numbing mineral/carbonation bite in the finish blocks the flavors which reappear as mineral, wheat & lemon in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with intense carbonation, crisp, very prickly but creamy among the spice bite. This pale wheat ale screams Berliner Weissbier."
"Hazy golden color, no nutmeg scent which j like, great feel and taste."

"This is a pretty typical wheat beer, though a bit heavier on the citrus than most.  Not my favorite style, but certainly very drinkable."

"These wheat-based beers do not produce much in the way of lasting head. I initially had two fingers of fizzing, bone-white head before it simply fell to wisps.  Color was a very cloudy Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 -5) and I will readily cop to agitating it to get the lees back into suspension. Nose had a very pleasant lemoniness to it and my mouth began to water at the thought. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. Taste had an immediate tartness on the tongue that slowly revealed itself as its inherent lemony flavor. Finish was dry and even slightly puckering with a lingering lip-smacking quality. Another perfect Summer beer that I wonder how it would fly during other times of the year."

"The Jack Whacker wheat is a nice beer. The beer poured a pale yellow with thin white head that is not lacing. The smell and the taste had hints of lemon citrus. The mouthfeel was light and crisp with good carbonation. Overall this is a decent wheat....maybe a touch too fruity for me....but not bad. Great on warmer days!"

"Sounds like a euphemism for something... Anyway, this stuff pours a hazy straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises light wheat, very light grass, and a decent smattering of watered-down lemonade. The taste brings in more of the same, with the lemonade definitely not watered-down anymore: it's in your face, together with a bit of orange rind for good measure. Things on the tongue just spiting the absolute hell out of the label for it's fallacious ""hint of citrus"" comment. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, just too much citrus for this stuff to work, especially considering the consequent lack of any other character."

"O: Overall, not a bad beer, but I like my wheats with a bit more velvet."

"Overall it's not a complex flavorful brew, but a nice refreshing option none the less. Tommy Knocker makes some solid beers for sure. If you are a Hefeweizen lover then it's definitely worth a try. Personally I prefer Swetty Betty Blonde from Boulder Beer Company."

"Mildly cloudy golden yellow with a pure white frothy head. Citrus fruits, lemon zest, wheat grass, creamy malts and molasses in the aroma. Sweet citrus uplift and buttery malts on the first sip. Rich, milky mouthfeel with fresh hops, thick malts and lemongrass with a lingering soft citrus blend. Sweet, citrusy finish. A really wonderful beer!"
""
""
""
"edit: in bottled form this is a vastly superior to on tap. the lemon is balanced out, more of a lemongrass flavor, and its much cleaner to drink. don't write this off if the tap version turned you off too. im bumping up a few scores accordingly."

"Poured from a bottle into a lager glass. Pours a dark, Murky gold with absolutely no head. The smell was of light lemon and wheat. And that was it. The taste was once again of light lemon and wheat. The mouthfeel allowed no other flavors through, It actually lessened the flavors. I thought that this beer was decent for a wheat ale ( which is my thus far least favorite type of beer ), However after looking at the freshness date, Which was 07/06/2009, I could understand why it was as bland as it was. I was drinking it 3 years passed it's freshness date. Had it been fresh, It would have probably been my favorite wheat ale, but given what I was, It wasn't that impressive. Oh well, For a free bottle, I can't complain"

"D: Extremely drinkable and refreshing. Perfect for a hot summer picnic by the lake or beach. A solid wheat beer. I like what the lemon grass imparts to this brew."
""
""
"Overall: Actually surprised that this wheat beer had this much flavor that was sweet and somewhat bitter. Liked it, but couldn't say I love it. Must say I would totally recommend it to a friend."
"Taste: A real disappointment; the idea of lemongrass sounded interesting, but the beer lacks finesse; making it more in the style of a Wit might make it work better"
""
"I personally really liked this beer. I was thoroughly impressed with the BrewPub in Idaho Springs; the food was good and the beer was fresh. I'm not much for the appearance or smell of beer, all I care about is whether or not a beer tastes goood. At the end of the day, this is a solid wheat ale; I really enjoy the lemon peel taste that they add."
""
""
""
"It had a nice aroma, one that really intriged me. However the aroma did not transalate into a great taste. The mouthfeel felt a little heavy for this style. To me it almost came across as sour. I've had beers with lemon grass before and I did not get that same taste/mouthfeel. I actually gave this beer 3 tries before rating it. I wanted to be able give it a good unbiased rating. I'm glad I tried it, but probably would not pick up another one."

"Pours a hazy soft golden with zero head. Looks like apple cider. Smells like moldy hay. Tastes like a crappy cider with a heap of metallic zest that bumps the roof of the mouth. No carbonation really. Overall a shitty, shitty beer. I don't know what the hell happened here. What am I suppose to do with the other 5?"
""
""
""
"Medium bodied at best with a strong astringency and high effervescence. A lot of lemon in the aftertaste with some weaker malt. A decent beer, along the lines of a Blue Moon with an astringent streak."
""
"Just unimpressive all around, every thought I had comparitively was not a beer."
""
""
"I do like wheat ales, but this one is a major step down for me. There are absolutely much better ones out there."
""
"Overall - This is a good beer for any situation, and especially for the one described above. Ironically, although I don't typically do this with wheats and did not intend to, I let it get a little warmer before I finished it. In my opinion, the taste and aroma of this beer was accentuated by the raised temperature. I know that sounds more like an imperial or other stronger style, but I'm serious, I really think it was better at a warmer temp. I would recommend this beer, it's just as good as many of the American pale wheats I have had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Don't know if this beer is marketed as a ""summer ale"" regardless if it isn't this might be your year round go to. Tastes great and flavor to carbonation is evenly distributed. Hope you all enjoy!"
"This is a pretty standard light, simple wheat beer. The flavor is a little sweet and the apple juice notes aren't pleasing. I probably won't have this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: For some reason, I've had a hard time finding an American Wheat ale that I have liked. I definitely like this one. Flavors are really nice and stray away from the traditional over-citrusy ales."
""
"O- I really like this beer. lemon taste is a touch strong so you need to like lemons to really enjoy. great warm weather beer or after any work at all."
""
"Overall, this beer is alright, but nothing special. I definitely won't buy it on its own. However, if this is the weak link in a variety 6-pack, I think I can deal with that."
"Overall a nice wheat ale. Worth a try but I probably wouldn't pick up a sixer until next summer."
"This one's pretty good actually."
"The body of this beer is on the light side of medium, with more heft and depth than most APWAs. It's gently crisp and a bit smooth."
"Overall impression: meh. Another overly filtered wheat with some citrus added. Definitely mediocre."
"Overall, I would move on to another."
"Overall: A good sessionable wheat ale. I love the maltiness in this one. This one is subtle but is one of Tommyknocker's better brews."
"Overall, pretty good for this style, but the style doesn't suit me"
"O- This is a pretty decent wheat beer. I would enjoy this beer on any hot summer day."
"Dr: Well priced and very drinkable, but of mundane quality. I'd have it again if it were well priced. Would likely be better on draught."
"Overall not my favorite of the style since it is more yeast forward but I wouldn't turn it down if offered. Good enjoying two in a row so session able."
"Overall, this beer is pretty good, but it just needs another layer of complexity to make it great. Hops, yeast, malt... it just needs a contribution from something else. Not bad by any stretch of the imagination."
"Delicious and flavorful, a real winner and good session candidate. I could drink a ton of these on a hot summer day without complaint. The lemongrass is a great touch. Definitely worth trying."
"This beer pours a clear, gold color with a thin head and no lacing. The aroma is mainly banana with hints of lemon and dough. The flavor is lemony with banana, cake, and some nutty notes. It has a light-medium mouthfeel, light, and very smooth. Tommyknocker Jack Whacker Wheat Ale is a very good beer, represents the style well, and is very enjoyable. Highly recommended."
"O: This is by far the best American Wheat I have ever had. I love the flavor that lemongrass brings to the drink and how refreshing this beer is. Perfect for chilling out during summer. Great beer!"
"Probably decent on a hot day but still not what it could have been had the brewer laid off the bubbles."
"This one is just so refreshing. A nice addition to my palate after a long day at work."
"This is average tasting at best. A summer beer for sure. This could be a session beer. I wouldn't mind having another one since it isn't horrible."
"Overall this was a pretty good beer. This was a very unique tasting beer, I haven't had a wheat beer that tasted similar to this. I feel like the addition of lemon grass is what made this beer stick out, I have never had a beer brewed with that before but I wouldn't mind checking out some more beers that utilize lemon grass, especially a wheat beer. I liked Jack Wacker and it ranks up there as one of the better ones from the six pack so far. I would buy this again, with all the citrus notes in this beer I think it would make a good summertime brew. I would recommend this people who like wheat beers that are heavy on the citrus."
"Hazy golden color with a thin white head that fades fast. No lace. Smells good. Wheat, grapes, and lemon. Sweeter than expected. Sweet pilsner malts, honey, and wheat with a background hint of citrus...probably the lemon grass. Not a faint beer, but nice and light. Refreshing, tasty and easy to drink."
"Poured in a bayern-weissbier glass. Look: Dull golden color, two finger of foam, with David the Gnome on the logo; Smell: Cirtus with some sweetness; Taste: Wheat, lemon peel, sugar; Mouthfeel: Refreshing and citrus, sometimes sweet, medium body and slight carbonation; Drinkability: Tasty and off thirst but something simple."
"This was a very refreshing, easy to drink beer with good flavor."
"Tommyknocker Jack Whacker Wheat Ale was golden in color and very hazy with fine particles floating about. It had a large off-white head with good retention and decent lacing. The smell was mainly lemons. The taste was lemony as well with some light malt, wheat and a dry, lightly bitter finish. The mouthfeel was good with a medium-light body and medium carbonation. The drinkability was above average. This is a good wheat beer and worth a try."
"(Drinkability): The high carbonation completely throws this one off. Assuming it doesn't ruin the drinking experience for you, the beer is relatively light and fairly low in ABV, so it could be a decent session beer. Unfortunately, it's not a beer that would make the session very enjoyable."
"Notes: This beer does not remind me of any other beer I have ever had; it really sticks out as unique. I was put off by the goofy label on the bottle, but I am glad I tried it. Tastes great on draft as well. Recommended..."
"Pleasing and somewhat interesting, but not enough ""oomph"" to be memorable. On the other hand, very easygoing and easy to down, but the sweetness builds up too easily. Somewhat like a more restrained version of Leinenkugel's Berry Weiss crossed with a subdued Magic Hat Circus Boy."
"D: Drinkable? Yes. Enjoyable? Not sure...."
"Drinkability - Interesting taste, but perhaps a bad bottle, I may come back and reevaluate my review when I can next find another bottle."
"Drinkability - Nice and would definitely drink this again. Just an over all good wheat, but there are ones that are better, but again all in all this is a good one and should be tried."
"Conclusion: Nothing is wrong with this example of the style, but I can't find one thing about it to praise, however the lemongrass is interesting and if you like lemongrass you will probably enjoy this beer. I like Thai food and thus I like lemongrass.."
"D - The appearance was a little weak, but the rest came through, with an outstanding flavour coming as a great surprise. Highly recommended to any Wheat Ale fan, or anyone looking for a fruity twist to their bevy!"
"D - Considering it doesn't really have a taste. It is real easy to drink, just not very enjoyable."
"My 300th review. Pours a cloudy gold with a small white head. Aromas are big on the sourdough bread dough and yeast, not nearly as wheaty as many wheat beers but definitely pleasant and interesting. Lots of carbonation on the palate that wasn't apparent on the head. Tastes like a buttered piece of sourdough bread with just a dab of honey. It's somewhat wheaty, but not nearly as much as many other wheat beers. I agree with the reviewers who said that it has a ""chalky"" element to its taste. The uniqueness of its flavor profile makes it fun to try but I wouldn't want another."
"D: Could very well drink a few pints of these no preob."
"Pours a clouded apricot hue orange golden really with a large bubbled thicket of bright white head. Lacing is sporadic and finely speckled. Aroma has a nice citric note between the typical yeast character and the lemongrass adjuncts. Smell has a really nie bready wheat tone to it. Flavor really is nice brings an earthy grass feel with the citrus/bready wheat profile. Yeast gives a bit of chalky character amongst everything else going on slightly spicy finish this brew would pair nicely with some Thai food. Mouthfeel is spritzy with carbonation really cleans the palate with fine bubbles, sharp acidity does add a bit of dryness. A nice light bodied wheat ale, that does a good job of not being a boring bland pale wheat ale that I've come to expect with most American micros. Drinkability overall was solid especially after being outdoors for most of the early part of today, I needed something refreshing to go with my water."
"The beer pours a golden color with a white head. The aroma is full of wheat and perfume. Not what I expected and not very good. The flavor is very similar. I get a lot of flowers and perfume notes to go along with wheat and some grassy hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not one I wish to try again."
"One of the more favorable wheats that I have had."
"You know, I could down this easy on a hot day. It's not hot today, and this is just pizza beer. OK."
"All in all, though there are a few great pale wheat brews, this brew defines the pale wheat genre for me. Personally, without a doubt, I think that this beer is an A beer."
"Golden bodied brew, slight haze but mostly clear. Small white head doesnt last very long. Filtered wheat. Wheat grain nose, some citrus hints and a bit of banana. Wheat malt pretty much owns the taste, has a bit of the ole bubblegum thing going on. Not much in the way of malts. Kinda thin on the mouth, but overall pretty refreshing and tasty"
"D - High. I could have two or three of these in a row without feeling weighed down, which I can't say for Blue Moon. While some wheat beers are complimented by a twist of orange I think this beer is best on its own. I can picture myself picking up a six pack of this for a party, or just to enjoy on my own."
"Drinkability is relatively high. The flavor profile is ok. The ABV is low making this sessionable. It's an ok drinking experience, but it wouldn't be my first choice for a wheat."
"This was a recommendaton by the bartender during the summer. His presentation sparked my interest, but his serving of the beer was even more important. He put the pint glass upside down on top of the bottle, flip them around so the bottle was now upside down and poured slowly in a circular motion (for the wheat). Once finished, he spun the bottle back and forth (palms of hand on the bottle, Mr. Miyagi stlye) to collapse the wheat and pour the foamy head on top. Then, garnished with a slice of lemon. Do it this way to capture all the flavors and enjoy a great beer!"
"Bought a single bottle of this looking for something different. It pours a near clear yellow, so my expectations for wheat flavor immediately lowered. The bouquet promised lemongrass, which was readily apparent upon first sip. However, that is all that was present in this thin beer. I could see how people would love it on a warm day as a session beer, but a single bottle, I didn't feel it was an attention grabber."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy light brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smells of lemons. Taste is also of lemons, tart, some malts. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall not bad, but definatly nothing great."
"Poured into Sam Smith nonic. Hazy orange color dominates with finger white head leaving negligible lacing. Smell is of orange and coriander and taste is, unsurprisingly, orange and coriander. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and this is a sessionable yet average beer. The most disappointing out of the sampler."
"D: Nothing really flawed with this beer but nothing making it stand out and make me want another."
"D - Moderate to high drinkability. The flavors are well, non-existent at times - avoid palette fatigue. Lightly filling. Drinkability in this occasion may not be a compliment."
"d - this is an easy drinker with just enough flavor to keep you intrigued. If I want a light wheat beer this is just what I'm looking for."
"D- Drinkable, but a bit too sweet...not something I would drink too much of. I can think of more balanced wheat ales that I think are more complex that I would rather have. Interesting idea with the lemon grass, but nothing that makes it stand out."
"Pours a yellow hazy color with a half finger to finger head. The smell is of wheat and some fruity notes, but there is not much in the way of smell to be had. The taste is bland and kinda watery. The taste is wheat with a hint of maybe coriander. The mouthfeel is a little overly carbonated and it is slightly too watery. The overall drinkability of the beer is about average, the beer goes down smooth but there is too much water and not enough guts to this beer."
"D- Very refreshing. I could drink these all day."
"Drink ability is barely above average. It is session able but very boring. Glad i bought this for 99 cents, would not spend any more on it"
"Goes down very smoothly."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale yellow color. The head is a half inch in height, and recedes quickly into almost no lacing. Very disappointing for a wheat beer. The aroma has a faint wheaty tang to it, but really nothing else. The taste is has a more pronounced wheatiness than the arome, with the addition of some nice lemony citrus notes. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with carbonation that is a little too high. Overall, this is a decent American Wheat beer at best. I would be upset if I had to drink this again, but I would be excited either."
"Solid choice for a thirst quencher on a hot summer day."
"D: For a wheat ale, not a bad one for a hot summer day. Gets better as it warms, more of the wheat malt come out. Easily drinkable if you like wheat ales."
"Pours a cloudy, golden color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of wheat, pale malt, some citrus flavors (lemon), and some sweet malt. Fits the style an American Pale Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is really smooth and slightly thick with an average carbonation. Tastes of lemon up front, but not just lemon juice. It's more of a lemon with a zesty/earthy kick, probably from the lemon grass added. After the lemon comes some slight spice, and then finishes with a smooth sweet malt flavor. The initial zest on the tongue is intriguing and along with the smooth finish this beer is amazingly easy to drink. Overall, this is a really good brew that I could drink quite a few of - worth a try. On a bad note, it does not get better with warmth, actually quite the reverse."
"Great balanced feel on the palate, a bit watery. Goes down smooth with no unpleasant after taste. A very refreshing and drinkable brew, by far the best thing I've had from TommyKnocker."
"The drinkability was pretty great and would be the perfect day to enjoy after a day on the mountain or on a hot summer day. I am usually a bigger fan of Belgian style wheat's but this has to be one of the best American wheat's I have had."
"D- lemon grass and wheat ale seems to be a winning combination. mild in character but with likable nuances, i could slam about a billion of these in the summertime."
"Drinkability: A slightly toned down carbonation would, for me, be appreciate. Otherwise, it's a fairly pleasant wheat ale."
"D: Very drinkable beer in a drinkable style. Especially since its local, this will make a summer session beer for the back yard."
"Overall, this is a very easy to drink beer. I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to pick up this beer, but it could be a decent session beer."
"Nikki"
"I don't mean to knock this beer so hard, cuz the idea is really neat, but something went wrong with the batch this one came from. I'd like to try it again on tap or from a new bottle. As it stands though, this one is not good at all."
"Taste is a nice wheat with overtones of citrus little malt and a slight hint of esters and citrus. Overall it is a good beer."
"D: This beer just didn't excite me that much. Decent for a session, but not one I'm anxious to revisit. I'm still convinced that this style is meant to be a safe microbrew starting point for the macro drinker. My mom certainly liked it."
"D: Fine for an American wheat ale, but nothing to write home about (like most of this style)"
"M/D - to me, it was too much wheat to be drinkable for more than a few"
"This one was sort of bland for me. A pretty high ABV for a pale wheat ale and is very drinkable, I could see myself having this on a nice hot day. As a beer though, it's a little boring aroma and taste wise and can definitely be improved. One of the better beers from this brewery though."
"D: Very high. This beer goes down easy as water, but tastes much better. Very refreshing."
"overall, i really enjoyed this brew i think ill look for it again, it was a decent price"
"Overall- Light but quite tasty. Very good for a BBQ beer."
"Cloudy gold colored ale with a slowly fading head.I got nothing on aroma.Taste is very weak and bland.I got some lemon and wheat but again not strong at all.I can't say that this is bad or good,there's not much to work with.Probably as average and boring as a beer can get."
"A light gold/yellow with a two-finger head that died quickly. A stronger sweet malt smell than most pale wheats, but real lemon and clove/spice come through. A light to medium body, a little slick for my taste, with an intense, almost overpowering lemon bite. Kind of reminded me of a wit for a second. Not a bad beer by any stretch, but i just thought the lemongrass overpowered the brew a little, taking away from the malts and the wheat."
"The addition of lemon grass gives this brew its distinctive flavor. Without it, it'd be a really subpar wheat. Still, look to maybe Magic Hat's Hocus Pocus for a better example of the style."
"Overall - Excellent wheat beer. Very drinkable. Very well balanced."
"HV"
"D - this is pretty good. Reminded me a bit of a hefeweizen instead of an american wheat ale."
"D - This is a nice wheat. Great on a 100+ degree day."
"d: goes down easy, strong wheat flavor. meh, its alright."
"The carbonation is lively and appropriate and the drink soft and flavorful with good drinkability."
"D: Drinkable, but the lemon textures might get a little old after a few. Could definitely put down a few on a hot summer day though."
"Drinkability - I kinda like this one, and it drinks real easy. Might pick it up again in the future."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Medium foamy head on a lovely cloudy body. Lemon comes through in initial sniffs, wheat not so much. Rather faint. There's a funk to the smell as well, can't put my finger on it. Taste is about the same, minus the funk, which was a good thing. Again, the wheat was a tad underwhelming. Thickness was also a tad low, at least as far a wheats go. A good beer, not among the greats, but certainly drinkable. Very pleased they got lemon balanced just right."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a nice white head. In the aroma, banana and small hints of citrus. In the taste, dry banana, small clove presence and just a small bitterness. A nice bitterness and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry clove and citrusy aftertaste. A nice balance, good flavor, a really nice wheat."
"D- i think the lemon is a lil bit overkill with this brew but it is still decent. I think it is just a tad too much acidic but that could just be my thoughts. I could only do two or three of these before my stomach would be turning knots."
"Cloudy yellow color with zero head and therefore no lace. Not looking very good but the smell holds some promise. Fresh, clean smell. The bottle says lemon grass is added and you can easily pick it up along with a light grainyness. Taste matches the smell but is a little underwhelming. Mouth is clean but somehow manages to not be watery. A nice summer brew which is what I think they set out to make, so I'll give it a thumbs up. Worth a try on a hot summer day."
"D- Good, a nice session wheat beer worth keeping a six pack around for a warm day."
"Very easy to drink. Sor tof a weak mouthfeel, but definetely nice on a summer day. A little bit more crispness and fullness of flavor might make the beer more drinkability."
"Overall, well drinkable. I'm not a fan of wheat ales, but this is pretty solid and something that I would consider drinking more often, especially as a summertime brew."
"D - A really solid wheat beer. Excellent on a hot summer day! I like it."
"Not a bad beer but I like them less sweet."
"D: An enjoyable Pale Wheat Ale, there are others I would drink over this, but it is worth a shot."
"D - Quite drinkable because it's so light. Just a little too much ABV for a session beer, but I'd be willing to fake it ;-)."
"Drinkability is once again nothing special. But I think all wheat beers are pretty damn drinkable, espcially in the summer, so I bump it up from average."
"Not bad, but nothing above and beyond..."
"A pretty nice brew, the lemon grass is a nice touch ... good foam 4 an american wheat ... a cross between a witbier and a fruity kolsch ... a saving grace from Tommy! ... ""skippy and his lunch"" ...this would be good at a bbq on a warm day, decent.."
"The first beer I've had from Tommyknocker, Jack Whacker Wheat is a pleasant surprise. The presentation is mediocre, with a thin layer of white head leaving town way too fast over a yellow-golden body. Very nice aroma, with some fruitiness and a decent hop load. I'm impressed with the taste, more hopped than I expected, but balanced by tasty fruit--orange, lemon especially. Creamy smooth, this is a terrific accompaniment to a warm weekend day. Delicious, one I'll be sure to grab again as the weather warms."
"A pretty decent all around brew. This style isnt my favorite, admittedly but it was rather interesting. I have found that a lot of these have a random spice that they kind of make dominate the beer. This beer chose lemon grass, and it was delicious. The smell has a lot of the lemony smell, but a bit earthier. In the taste, the earthiness is stronger than the lemon. However, I like both so I won't complain. A bit light on mouthfeel, but on par for the style."
"Initial lemon zing followed by hops bitterness results in a complex but balanced taste. This would be a great beer pool side."
"The lemon grass/wheat thing is still going on. Sweeter than I expected, as I had the assumption the lemon grass would provide tartness. It does, however counterpoint the sweetness a bit and the beer has an easy-drinking wheat smoothness to it. Not much hop or pop, but I appreciate what's going on here. Probably one of Tommyknocker's better offerings. I'd take some fishing or golfing. Would be good with a veggie/fruit tray."
"This is by far one of the breweries best beers. Well balanced and a good example of the style. A glowing golden with a silky white head. Aromas of citrus fruits and light malts. Body is crisp and refreshing, yet still full on the palate. Taste is a nice blend of bready malts, floral hops and tart fruit."
"Slightly light golden color with a fairly thin head atop. Smell is light, nice wheatiness along with some tart lemony note. Taste is also a touch tart, with a sweet honey wheat like kick to it as well. I tend to like american wheats although they're not generally a highly rated snobby beer, and I'd say this one was above average. I thought it was quite good, while slightly unique, for the style and would get it again."
"edit: After savoring another, I noticed aftertaste and finish going a little thin and lowered taste and drinkability #'s a notch, still a very nice beer though."
"D - I'm not usually a fan of wheats..just not much my style but this was a pretty darn good beer and I would've had another had this not been the last one"
"Pours a cloudy golden color with very little head. Smell has some fruity aromas. Goes down extremely smooth and is a little dry on the tongue. Taste is very malty with some hints of fruit. I'm not a fan of wheat beers but I really liked this one. I only expected a lot more head for a wheat beer. Regardless, this one should be given a try."
"Part of the Trail Mix 6 pack. Unfiltered. Evidently bottled 6/13/07 per the notching on the label. Pours out to a very clear deep golden, forming a creamy white head which has good retention and good lacing. Carbonation is moderate. The aroma is rather nondistinct...definitely an American Wheat. Smells like a Pyramid product. Some suggestion of orange peel and corn. Oh, now I see it's brewed with Lemon grass. Mouthfeel is crisp and a little sizzly. Refreshingly light bodied and clean. Well, what's to say? It's a beer. There's not a whole lot of flavor going on. Some distant pale malts, crackers, some yeasty fruity esters, a little citrus. Finish is lightly sweet, and the aftertaste suggests adjuncts and a hint of metal. Best served ice cold, because as it warms, they all become more apparent. Nothing I would ever care to have again."
"D:I would love to drink this beer again. It has a very interesting taste and a light body."
"Drinkability: Probably ok on a warm summer day (not a cold winter night). Still, not real good, one is enough, and I will probably not seek this out again."
"Overall: one of my favorites from the mix pack, will definitly get again, probably on a nice summer day it would do well with me."
"Overall a very strong offering from Tommy Knockers. I have had a couple off ones lately, but this seemed to restore my hope that they are putting out some quality products. Not the best I have ever had, but nowhere near the worst. I would grab for this one again without hesitation if it were around."
"D - Very drinkable beer. Smooth and crisp. The aftertaste doesn't build up. A great session beer."
"-Oelergud"
"D: Falls below the medium in terms of a wheat beer"
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Enjoyed most of the Tommyknocker brews that I poured at the Charlotte Oktoberfest. However, the wheat was not to my fancy. Nothing spectacular, though a lot of the girls who needed something ""light"" enjoyed this. Medium straw color that looked mostly filtered, easy to consume. Good choice ona hot summer day."
"Apparently a ""Jack Whacker"" had the job of whipping the last mule to keep the supply train moving along in mining camps... I bought this beer thinking it was something completely different...damn marketing campaigns."
"I try very hard to not slam a beer but, there is nothing going on with this one, this is better than BMC but not much. I am glad only only have 1 of these"
"Thanks to Pegasus for the karma point."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Appearance is hazy yellow with little to no head. Aroma is dirty diaper and slight cloves. Flavor mimics the aroma; soiled underpants with slight lemon and citrus flavors. Average mouthfeel, not really drinkable. Another dud from Tommyknocker."
"D: Not quite up to par. There are better APWA's to be had. One and done for me"
"This is a beer that has no reason to exist."
"Poured into a wehat glass, pours a pale yellow with a bit of a head that doesn't hang around to long, little yeast particles float around. Smell is slight citrusy with sweet amber in there as well also a bit of wheat. The taste is pretty good nice and smooth and goes down extremly well, taste of slight bitterness, lemon twang also a bit of lime in there. This is a pretty good offering and the drinkability is amazing you could littlerly go through a bunch of these in no time."
"The beer pours a bright clear gold color with a few small yeast chunks floating. A fizzy bleached white head foams up 1 cm and fades quickly to a thin surface layer. Aroma is some lemon zest and tangy wheat with also a bit of general sugar sweetness. The first sip reveals a light crisp body with fine tingly carbonation. Flavor is similar to nose with light sweetness, some mild wheat twang, and a bit of lemon. Overall mild and crisp good for a hot day, but not overly interesting in terms of flavor. No hint of 5.5% ABV so could be easily sessionable."
"Nothing more to say. Big disappointment."
"Not a bad drinking beer, just not much of a wheat beer."
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Crisp & light, with reasonable balance, but overall not a lot of flavor really. Drinkability would be good on a hot day, but I don't think there is really enough here to make me want to try another."
"Drinkability: Good, I found that after a couple the lemony taste starts to were on you, all an all a good beer."
"A nice wheat beer with whispers of citrus thanks to the addition of lemon grass. Color is cloudy amber, so you know it hasn't been filtered. Aroma has a hint of lemon, as does the taste, which is typical of a wheat beer. Pleasant and uncomplex, it has just a little bit of a hoppy bite. Good for spring or summer outings."
"The mouth is very low carbonation which also hurts this beer. Drinability suffers from the beer's flaws. Not a beer I will be searching for."
"and goes down nice"
"The pour into my Blanche De Chambly glass raises a 1.5 finger head over a hazy yellow gold body, looking much like the Pils I had earlier. The head, though, doesn't last long, especially for a wheat beer. It falls after a minute or two to surface lacing, but manages to leave some nice tracks on the glass's sides. The nose has a lemon-pepper smell to it, but is quite mild in all categories. The lemon is very noticeable, and actually adds a very interesting dimension to this beer. There's a lot of sweetness too, but not anything usually associated with wheat beers. Still, it's a fun departure. The mouth is light, with a mellow carbonation. I think the lower carbonation helps the soft lemon flavor come through more clearly. A fun and refreshing beer, which would be even better in warm weather."
" A nice option when the weather warms, but nothing special here."
"pours a very cloudy golden color with a white three finger head that held for a short time then settled to a ring on the glass with a fair amount of lacing. smell is of fruit and citrus. lemon grass comes right out but can't pick anything else out of the taste. mouthfeel is light and clean slight lemon after taste. i would buy it again as a summer refresher."
"Again from the ""Motherlode"" 12 pack mix. Poured a hazy yellow (gray?) in the glass with a soft cream-colored head that disappeared quickly. Clean smelling. I guess I expected more lemon (seeing ""lemongrass"" on the label as an ingredient). But the lemon taste was very subdued, almost smooth in its subtlety. Obvious wheat taste with a nice mouthfeel (again thanks to the wheat); but surprisingly drinkable and tasty. I find that if I enjoy every sip, looking forward to the next all the way to the bottom of the glass, I give the beer a thumbs up. This was not all that complex in flavor, but everything was so well balanced that it was a refreshing change of pace. Like Tommyknocker's Glacier Lager, I would buy this for the summer barbeque."
"Another solid beer from Tommyknocker."
"Drinkability - easy session pick but it's on the pricy side at close to $8 a sixer."
"Pours a nice straw-yellow into my Duvel glass. A substantial head of at least a quarter-inch formed, but it didn't last long. I always like the view of sediment swirling at the bottom of any beer! The aroma is of fruity citrus and lemongrass, but it's very light overall. I found the initial flavor to be quite enjoyable; it was crisp and bright, with lemon, wheat, and light summer fruit dominating. The mouthfeel was nice as well, with a subtle cloying effect followed by a warm sensation that outlasted the aftertaste. The only negative aspect to this beer is that it weakened in flavor over the 45 minutes I sipped it. By the end, almost no big flavor characteristic stood out and the aftertaste vanished. Not bad. Interesting to try."
"Dnot bad, but not what I was expectingits more like a spiced ale to me, I have another, but probably not a sessionable beer."
"Overall it was decent."
"Poured a cloudy light apricot color with massive white puffy head. Smell is very light, with only a mild fruity sweetness to be found. Taste is also very mild, with a bit of sweetness from the lemon grass, and a moderate tartness to balance it. Finish is nice and full in the mouth and very refreshing. A nice beer for a warm eary autumn afternoon,"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" off-white head above the almost clear golden amber brew. Head fades gradually, with frothy lacing. Aroma is lightly flowery wheat. Taste follows along, slightly floral, almost sickly sweet wheat flavor, with a chalky close. Mouthfeel and drinkability are okay, but this is not something I would search out again."
"The drinkability is good. I like the taste, I will add this is no German Hefe but they don't say it is. This is a very good American Wheat, better then most. MK"
"This is an interesting wheat. You can definitely say that it is not bland, unlike most other American wheat beers. There is a lot of noticeable lemongrass and other seasonings added to it. The lingering aftertaste may be a bit disagreeable, but its not a huge deal. If it didnt have all the extra spices, etc added to it, it would be pretty boring, but at the very least this beer is worth a try out of curiosity."
"12 oz bottle, best within 4 months of 6/27/06, pours a dark hazy yellow with a finger of bright white head that fades after a couple minutes, some slight lacing. Aroma is lemony and grassy, slight graininess, very subdued. Taste is similar, the lemongrass definitely dominating upfront, very light yeastiness, a bit of wheat, and a lingering lemon finish. Very different from an normal American Wheat, a little offputting on the first sip, but the taste grew on me and I found this to be a pretty refreshing beer. Light and crisp, this makes a good thirst quencher on a hot summer day."
"Pours a cloudy golden color. Thin head fades fast. Light citrus and grass clippings in the aroma. Taste is similar to the aroma, with a significant bitter contribution compared to most wheats. Light to medium body. Aftertaste fades into a vegetal bitterness. Not very exciting, but not terrible either. Inoffensive and a bit different form standard American wheats."
"Pours a moderate golden color, with a slight head and little retention (poured from a bottle into a weizen glass). Cloudy. Smells like LEMONS, followed by a hint of wheat. The taste is pretty muchy the same...a strong taste of lemon, as well as a taste of wheat. A moderate beer, with a nice, crisp finish. Perfect amount of carbonation. A fairly tasty beer."
"This is a pretty tasty brew. Maybe the best I've had from Tommyknockers. I rather enjoyed this one."
"Not terrible if you want something very lemony without any citrusy sweetness, good hot weather beer for sure."
"Flavor had a good wallop of lemongrass, not as bad as a streetside Thai soup, but more of a hint. Personally, I didn't care for it. Felt overly perfumy, then citrusy with some grassy chalky malts. Overall, not bad, interesting."
"Pours a two finger white head that fades quickly leaving a little lace. Light cloudy amber color. Light carbonation and Light bodied. Sweet lemony nose. A little sweeter than a typical wheat, must be the lemon grass, slight lemon aftertaste. Good summer beer. $1.29 for a 12oz bottle from Blue Max Liquor Burnsville, Mn."
"Somewhat cloudy yellow color. Not a lot of aroma-the label says lemongrass but I cant find any thats for sure. Rubbery and plastic like flavor-makes me think of a new set of smeakers as a kid! Sort of crisp and dry but the plastic flavor really overpowers the whole deal. OK mouthfeel-neither up nor down. While not a wheat beer fan I have had many that were way more enjoyable. This one falls flat on all counts. A big miss for me."
"Jack Whacker Wheat Ale pours a hazy yellow with a thin off white head. The aroma tends to the lemon side, not much else is noticeable. Tastes fairly good, the wheat is not really noticeable. Lemon is dominant, but not overpowering. A little bit of hops toward the end, but not much. Worth a try, it's not bad."
"D: Eh. Whatever."
"The label explains that a jack whacker's role was to whip the last mule to keep the supply train moving along. In essence, he was an ass whipper. Jack Whacker Wheat Ale isn't quite an ass whipper of a beer, but it is a very good one considering the style. I could go for a few more of these this summer."
"A quality wheat brew from Tommyknocker."
"Poured a hazy, dull gold. A bit of lemon rind in the aroma. Nothing in the malt profile really set it out as a wheat ale, and there was a significant grainy note that blossoms toward the end. A lighter note from the lemongrass helps salvage the beer, and the finish is just barely tart. Pleasant enough, but nothing noteworthy."
"12 ounce bottle. Jack Whacker Wheat pours out a light golden brown color. The head is small and fades away quickly. Weak malty flavor with a sour fruitiness. The flavor starts off sweet. This beer is brewed with lemongrass. The flavor is quite noticable. It adds a tanginess to the finish, almost a minty flavor. Mouthfeel is light to medium. Good drinkability. I enjoy some of the flavors in this beer, but it also has a stale wheat beer taste. Not a great beer, but certainly worth a try."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is light bodied and well carbonated. This is a very easy to drink beer and I wouldnt turn it down again."
"Not too crazy about this one, but as Ive said before in other reviews, Im not a huge fan of Pale Wheat ales. This particular example is a bit watery with a bland finish. Sure, it was quaffable enough but it didnt really make me want to have another bottle either. Still, it wasnt awful, so if you like the style more than I do, give it a try."
"Beer is good. Happy different beering."
"Not overpowering by any aspect, but a solid little wheat to drink in the summer heat, or if someone in the group is ready for a cross-over into brew with more taste and body. In fact, I knew the wifey would like these, she did, and I'll get some more the next time I spot these at the store."
"Uniformly translucent greenish gold appearance. Head is small and turns into patches very quickly. A couple of globs for lace, not much of anything. Aroma is not very satisfying, mostly Lemon Pledge without an accompanying estery sense. Light mouthfeel with more-or-less medium carbonation. Not very fun to drink for me, the lemongrass is somewhat like infused iced tea, with a brightening mid tone. Washes out a bit at the end with some off flavors that I pick up as stale water. Not much of a Wheat beer profile to help give more interest to the lemony flavor, what's here doesn't strike me as that good though it may appeal to some as refreshing during the warmer weather."
"The beer pours a cloudy dark yellow color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a fruity banana/clove scent as well as a wheat malt aroma. It's light and yeasty. The taste is decent. It has a dry and slightly fruity wheat flavor. The yeast character isn't as pronounced in the flavor. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an easy drinking wheat beer. It's pretty run of the mill, but it works."
"Surprised of the low ratings from other BAers. Sure it's not as good as it could be, but the intentions, creativity, and execution went quite well. It has an obvious American Wheat base that would have been better with a German Hefeweizen yeast to accentuate the clove, citrus, and bananna characteristics. The addition of lemon grass adds a nice citric, earthy tone that dominates the, otherwise, bland wheat character. Very clean and refreshing in the finish with a light, minty-dryness. A true thirstquincher."
"Saw a mixed 12-pack and I hadn't really heard of the brewery, so I picked it up. 12 oz., best within 4 months of Feb. '05.... hmm.... Anywho, it's my first American wheat, and after the pour, it sits in the weizen glass a hazy gold at the bottom and an opaque peach at the top, with 1 inch of white head and fairly active carbonation with bubbles that keep some of the sediment near the top of the glass. Near the end it is very dark and looks like cider with a bit of a head. It smells of toasty/grainy malts with sweet wheat, some fruitiness, citrus, and perhaps molasses - a combination I haven't met yet, but I like it. The flavor follows suit, but with a low bitterness, almost no hops detectable by taste, and a light body. I could drink a few of these in a row, but I imagine it's a better summer beer."
"This is an okay beer for a hot day or with some asian or hot/spicy food of what ever ilk."
"Appearance is a hazy yellow with a nice white head that quickly disappeared. Aroma has wheat and citrus. Initial taste is coriander and lemon with notes of yeast and some hops. The citrus in the middle dissipates tot a dry finish. Might be good with some foods."
"Pours a cloudy amber/yellow with a small short-lived bubbly head. Nose is of citrus, grass, wheat, and hops. Taste follows suit - Very lemony (the front label says it's flavored with lemon grass) with a hoppy finish. Very refreshing in the humid Wisconsin summer. Not sure I could drink a ton of them as the lemon grass is rather overpowering, but one or two would be a refreshing start to a session. An interesting brew."
"Dark golden color, hazy bodt with little head. Smell is sweet, like artificial banana flavoring was added. Taste is more like a Engl;ish Pale ale than a wheat beer, murky underpowered hops, and slight fruity flavors are the only things going on in this one. As a pale wheat, not that good."
" Mouthfeel is to light over carbonated just to fizzy for my liking. Drinkability is well bad has to be the worst wheat beer I have had to date. Thanks go to merlin48 for the sample though just can't win them all."
"This one is crisp and refreshing, but so is carbonated water."
"Finally, a Tommyknocker beer that I like. It is a cloudy, orangish yellow color and had a foamy white head that disappeared in a hurry. It smell of lemons and has distinct wheat malt notes. If it wasn't for the lemon grass zing in the aroma it would be average, but the lemony aroma is very pleasing. The flavor is very tart... lemon and grassy, but very drinkable, especially on a hot day. This beer actually benefits from the thin body that all Tommyknocker beers seem to have. With so many good summer beers available it will be hard to revisit this beer."
"This beer pours a light golden color with very little head and no lacing. The aroma was a little skunky. Nothing much more than that. The flavor had a lemon and grass taste. I really didn't enjoy this beer very much. I've not been terribly impressed with the beers from this company, and this falls into place. Not much else to say about it."
"The beer pours a clear golden color with less than a finger of head that falls quickly. The nose is mostly sweet wheat with a bit of a citrusy hop finish. The beer is light on flavor, with a sweet wheat flavor being most dominant. There's not much hop coming through. The beer is rather light in my mouth, not what I was expecting. It would be easy to sit down and drink many of these, but I wouldn't really want to have this beer again due to the lack of flavor and watered down taste, I would drink it again, but it's definately not the best wheat I've had."
"Added the next day: After further review, it appears that skunky smell is from the tap water I used to rinse the soap residue off the glass. I guess I need to install my water filters."
"Semi-cloudy, off-yellow hue, thin fluffy paper white head. Has a decent citrus aroma, some apple peel detection. Crisp and tarty, a solid light ale. Becomes rather sweet, the palate is quickly grazed nicely with some fruit, banana and apple notes in the tasting; lemon grass notes later on, with a tender amount of hops. A quickly dissolving aftertaste; yet a lemony feel on the palate. Solid unfiltered ale, perhaps a bit under-rated on the scales, not as sour or as sweet as some beers, yet it's just a simple, laid back wheat. A solid offering here."
"I didn't enjoy the citrus tones this beer had to offer, I think without the lemon grass this would have been a good beer. I think I'll skip this one next time."
"Its cloudy yellow-gold body is capped by a decent-sized head of creamy bright-white foam that holds really well and leaves some splashes of lace here and there about the glass. The nose is clean, and delivers the expected delicate tartness and grainy wheatiness of an American wheat beer along with a soft, bready sweetness and subtle note of lemon-grass. The lemon grass becomes more apparent as it warms and adds a unique and refreshing character. The body is distinctly medium; and it's nicely creamy and smooth in the mouth due to its very fine, natural carbonation. Lightly sweet and bready wheat malt dominates the palate with just a subtle accent of fruit (even banana?). And although it's sweetish, it's still fairly well-balanced and finishes nicely dry with just a mild, lightly acidic note of cookie-dough-like malt. The tartness suggested by the nose is just barely present in the flavor other than the finish; and the lemon grass doesn't seem to have left any significant contribution other than to help balance the doughy malt in the aftertaste. It's an interesting twist on an American wheat that takes the ball but just doesn't run with it."
"Pours a murky straw color with a thin white head. Quick lacing. Aroma is light hops and spice. Light bodied with flavors of citrus, floral hops and very little wheat. Finish is rather crisp and carbonated. This is a mediocre beer overall, but not bad on the scale of other American Wheats I have tried."
"This brew pours a large head of fine and medium sized white bubbles with a cloudy straw yellow body. It has a mild bread-fruit aroma with a slight initial tingle then its fruit flavor and the lemon come on. Acceptable, but somehow I just don't care that ,much for the lemon flavoring."
"When poured into my glass this brew had a large white frothy head with mostly fine bubbles. The body was cloudy and the hue was straw. It had a lemon aroma to it and a taste of lemon along with an acidic taste. This brew had good lacing. It tasted thin and a bit watery. This brew lacked character as nothing really special stood out with this particular American Wheat. It was on the flat side in my opinion."
"Farily light goden color hazy beer topped by a moderate, but loosely formed, white head. The head fades rather quickly. A hint of yeast on the aroma gives way quickly to a wheat crispness and some citrus notes. The taste is rather light, exhibiting little yeast qualities. There is a substantial crispness to the beer, as well as a decent citrus note, presumably from the hops. The body is very thin, almost watery. Drinkability is poor, as the watery body and the citrus notes remind me more of lemonade than a wheat beer/ wheat ale. This is about as enjoyable as a kick in the groin after the Erdinger I had earlier."
"Color is a cloudy medium gold, I poured the sediment in - after all it is a wheat beer. It poured with a medium head that disappeared rather quickly - nice lace though. Aroma is very subtle - by the third sniff I couldn't even smell it any more. Flavor is nothing special. Kind of lemony bitter with a touch of malt and hops. If this beer was clear it would almost be a macro - almost, but not quite that bland. Wheats were never my favorite, and this one is no exception. It's not a bad brew, it's just not my style."
"Turbid pale golden in color, topped by a thin, spotty white head that leaves isolated aggregates of foam. Tart lemon grass and doughy, maltose like sweetness upfront in aroma, ensued by understated banana esters and token grainy wheat. Sticky, sucrose sweetness hits the palate at first, then is ceded by a brief snap of hop bitterness then mild notes of stale cracker and cracked wheat. Suggestions of cold, chunky cream of wheat drizzled with lemon and confectioners sugar. Decently proteinaceous mouthfeel. Finishes with notes of vanilla and soured cream. An odd, off balanced brew that approaches cloying in its sweetness. Not an improvement on the typical insipid American wheat. At least they're clean."
"The beer pours a lightly chill hazed golden orange color with the head adequate in size and the texture frothy with lots of fine lace to conceal the glass. The aroma of yeast, the typical Bread Dough description fits nicely, citrus crisp and fresh. Start is sweet with the top middling in feel, the finish sparsely hopped, moderately carbonated and the aftertaste typically dry. Drinkable beer, but overall quite plain and nothing separates it from a million other beers, so the average rating applies per my rating criteria."
"The beer looks fairly viscous as it glugs into my glass.  Very murky golden with shades of orange.  No head.  Just a rimming.  Fairly light odor for a weizen, but there are some nice subtle notes of lemon, pepper and citrus.  Body of this beer is between medium and medium-full.  The taste begs for your attention.  (I understand why this is in the herb and spice category now.)  This doesn't taste like your typical hefe weizen.  The lemon grass adds a nice touch though.  A thirst quenching taste that makes you want to keep drinking more, and fast.  Pretty decent beer here."
"Jack Wacker.....cool name..even more interesting beer....Lemon grass eh???  Now that's unique...you can definitely taste it...the nose is pretty mellow but there are hints of citrus evident.  I don't get the typical wheat flavor, but it is very drinkable and thirst quenching...very little carbonation...solid and unique...a good combo in my book..."
"This unfiltered wheat ale pours with a slightly hazy golden color and a thin, yet lasting head.  The aroma is nicely balanced between malt and the addition of lemon grass which imparts (surprise) a slightly lemony character to the perfume. The flavor is very close to that of a true German hefeweizen with an addition of a lemon tartness that grows from the sip to the finish.  Very interesting and tasty brew."
"Notes: Very drinkable and makes for a great hot weather brew ... nice addition of lemon grass in the brew to kick it up a notch."
"lemony, grassy....iced tea comes to mind while sipping this brew.  very tasty and i imagine myself pounding down a sixer of these on a hot summer day."
