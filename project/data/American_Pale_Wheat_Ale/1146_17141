This is not meant to be a jab, but rather just to explain how this is clearly their beer to sway craft fringers, in recognition of the fact that many, many beer drinkers still reach for BMC.  The thing drinks light enough like one, and the flavor profile is crisp and equally as comparable.  You get just a little more sweetness, and a bit more of that savory metallic quality from the wheat.  Actually, as the beer warms, you get this curious zesty lemon flavoring that is part yeast and part citric inclusion.  Otherwise, you shouldn’t expect much else different from your typical American adjunct lager, despite the differently labeled style on the side of the bottle.","TheBrewo","Feb 09, 2015"

It had been a few years since I’d tried it, and I was pleasantly reminded of what a great everyday, sessionable beer this really is.

At 4.2% abv its a good session beer that I'd imagine could convert alot of budwesier drinkers (a little cannabalistic for inbev, but I really don't care).  When I need something light or for session purposes this is a solid bet that I'd gladly revisit.","CTbrew32","Oct 02, 2014"

Keep in mind, this brew has an abv of 4.2. The smell is citrus and beer. This brew has the smell of most wheat brews on the market. The taste is bitter at first but smooth at the end. I like how it is different from most wheat brews on the market. 312 Urban Wheat is a clean and fresh and smooth brew. The mouthfeel is is nice at the end. There is nothing bad about this brew. Overall I giving this brew a 4 out 5 I feel this is a good wheat brew to try out. I would get get this brew again.","nicholas2121","May 29, 2014"

Light nose of lemon with a hint of banana over a touch of clove against a light biscuit sweetness. Light medium body that is smooth. Normal carbonation level with good effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is laid back and a bit weak. Some light tart lemon flavor is predominant with only hints of clove. The finish is clean and somewhat crisp.","tillmac62","May 28, 2014"

4,18,3.25,3.75,4.25,4,4,"Picked this one up along with the 312 pale ale in a mixed six because I tend to like Goose Island beers. Not a great looking wheat, way to pretty and clean with little head. Decent smell but nothing that jumps up and grabs you. But very tasty, excellent wheat flavor that surprised. Clean and crisp with smooth finish. Had to ding it a little overall for low ABV. This is one I would definitely look to get again and considerably better than the 312 pale.","JamieDuncan","Apr 21, 2014"

And that flavor is: wheat (no surprise there). Not an incredibly complex or challenging beer, but the wheat flavor is fairly strong here, which adds a nice sweetness to the beer and brings to mind sitting on lawns in the summer (in my mind at least). Moderate hops and carbonation. Because this beer has a fairly strong wheat flavor, its a little more of a slow-drinking beer than the Urban Ale, but you'll pay more attention to it.","AmyfaceNYC","Apr 13, 2014"

Despite some decent carbonation, the head wouldn't stick around, but otherwise an okay looking beer. Not really a good example of a wheat-based beer; it lacks some of the smooth graininess I would look for. Nope, nothing to get wrapped around the axle with here.

On the nose I only pick up wheat and grass, but when drinking I taste a relatively significant hop presence for a wheat ale, grass, and light citrus flavors. The beer is fairly thin but has enough substance to avoid tasting like a Bud Light, and the carbonation is just active enough. Overall, I can't say I'll be looking for this again, as it's not that interesting. However, this would make a good session beer and is overall pretty solid as a summer ale as its fresh, easy to drink, and refreshing.","DeFaz","Aug 12, 2013"

Overall this is a refreshing beer and a good wheat for summer refreshment, it is not bad in any way. I can see how some may be turned off by its simplicity or low abv, but to me that is what a pale wheat is designed for -this is a good example of that style.","Slatetank","Aug 03, 2013"

It does smell a little funky in the finish, a slight off flavor, lets see what it tastes like. relatively clean and refreshing, lemons are prevalent, as is the nice yeast, but it seems a little overdone, like a little more than necessary in terms of yeast. just a touch of pepper in there as well, and its a little more filling that I wish it was. as a down easy beer at a wedding, it seemed just slightly off the mark. it also doesn't taste a whole lot different than their summertime ale, which just seemed strange to me. is goose island going down the tubes? maybe too early to tell, but don't hate this.","StonedTrippin","Jul 08, 2013"

Aroma: citric refreshment with Cascade and lemony zest; fresh and appropriate for a fan-cooled evening... Palate: soft yet active at the throat; enough substance to be considered between sips--refreshing and drinkable... Taste: not as much taste as the aroma suggests; lemony fizz and some undergirding hops... Overall: Lucky enough to have had this on tap a week ago in Chicago; this bottle is similar in mouthfeel and sudsy flavor; crisp and effective in its refreshment--haven't really had a bad Goose Island yet....","dacrza1","Jun 25, 2013"

If I ever lived in an area without good craft options, but could get this one because the buyout made GI more widely distributed, I would definitely pick this up. Also wouldn't hesitate bringing this to a party or something if there weren't better local options available. I intend on comparing this one to Bell's Oberon and Upland Wheat when I have a chance.

Aroma of wheat, bready malt and a hint of banana. Flavor of grassy hops, biscuit malt, wheat. Closer in taste to a light pilsner than a wheat beer. Light bodied. Pleasant, but would have liked a bit more wheat character, this leaned towards a light standard ale in flavor. Finished the glass and enjoyed it, but would probably not buy this if I was in the mood for a wheat ale again.","LiquidAmber","Mar 23, 2013"

There's gotta be some reason it's popular! It pours out a hazy yellow-golden color with a head that retains very well. The aroma is a citrus and wheat affair, with a light touch of citrus hoppiness. The taste is very nice, it manages to do a smooth wheat and citrus thing, but minus the graininess that often accompanies this flavor profile. I like grainy flavors, don't get me wrong, but this is a nice switch-up that really makes the beer seem delicate. There's also a nice subtle hop character that adds just a touch of spiciness. The mouthfeel is spot-on, this beer goes down way too easy. I really love trying a region's ""gateway crafts," they're almost always very well-made if not especially to the average BA's taste. 312 is a solid and extremely drinkable wheat. I think we'll make good friends over the summer.","shand","Mar 03, 2013"

Poured a hazy pale yellow with a two finger white head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, spice, grain, and subtle citrus. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, grain, fruit, subtle citrus, and subtle spice. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. As far as the style goes, most people do not go into these looking to be completely blown away when they first approach it. However sometimes you do come across some good examples of the style with just a touch of difference from others to make it stand out. This was one of those cases where it did have just a little bit extra going on to keep you interested. The nice subtle notes of citrus helped out on the balance of this one quite a bit and made it rather refreshing and enjoyable. A pretty well done example of the style, but as I stated, it will not blow you away. Definitely worth your time trying if you have not done so before or are looking for something light and refreshing.","thagr81us","Feb 01, 2013"

I think i would have enjoyed this even more if the lemon aspect didnt come across so candy-like. Also, the grainy sweetness of the wheat only over-emphasized the candy feel to this. Regardless, the alcohol is well integrated and this was effortlessly drinkable. It really hit the spot after getting shit done around the house and breaking a bit of a sweat. In the summertime, I would have no issues throwing back a bunch of these. Thanks for the gift Heath!","stakem","Nov 01, 2012"

The smell of the beer gives off some sweet wheat aromas, perhaps some other sweet grains as well. The nose of this beer is very light, nothing too pronounced here really. The taste of the beer is soft, quite refreshing, not fruity just light and enjoyable without much of a hop bitterness. The mouthfeel of the beer is light with a moderate carbonation.

A stealth pour yields the smallest cap of white possible, leaving a ring around the collar, no lace. Smell is on the wheaty side for sure with some pale malt backing. Traces of lemon with a semi sweet scent coming through with warming. Taste is pretty even keeled. Not overly malty, not overly hoppy, with wheat taking the center stage. Small traces of fruit and grassy hops, but wheat is king here. Feel is light bodied with not prickly carb, this goes down very smooth with no bite at all, perfect for the warmer months. At 4.2% a few of these would be easy. While the lower octane offerings from goose island are simple styles and not overly flavorful, the particular style was nailed down pretty well. This wont be a regular in my fridge, but it's a good beer.","BARFLYB","May 07, 2012"

Flavors have a citrus tang throughout, with a light body and grainy backbone. Lemon zest flavors make the majority of the palate, and the beer is light, but surprisingly smooth when considering the carbonation and flavors. Slightly toasted and syrupy sweet aftertaste, transitioning into a clean, smooth finish. Decent beer, and extremely sessionable. Great for hot weather.","GarthDanielson","Apr 07, 2012"

Overall a decent Wheat Beer, not a lot going on but it's a nice step up from BMC on a hot Summer day.","jsanford","Mar 03, 2012"

No off flavors at all here, but the overall experience is a somewhat bland one all things considered. The mouthfeel is a finely carbonated one, with a dry and lingering finish.

The nose is disappointingly dull, but a small amount of lemon aroma does manage to pop. The flavor has a bit more character to it though. There's an almost tart bit of wheat twang that announces each sip to my palate.The bitterness that pops up halfway through is pronounced for a wheat beer, but doesn't become too much and dominate the flavor. The close is a nice citrusy lemon note that makes me think of a blend of Cascade and Sorachi Ace hops (though Sorachi Ace isn't listed on Goose Island's info page for 312). The body is surpemely light, and is paired with a fairly spritzy level of carbonation. The balance is just right though, the carbonation doesn't become overbearing, and the beer comes across as very quaffable. This is one that I could definitely see myself enjoying again, especially in the warm weather.","axeman9182","Jul 29, 2011"

In the end, not much is goin' on on my tongue. The body is fairly light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.

Initially the body seems to be very light, but thickens nicely as it goes down. Considering the well balanced nature of this beer it is very drinkable.","DamDweller","Oct 06, 2010"

Taste follows nose - a little bland and watery; however, the wheat finally quality comes out. Pleasant mouthfeel; light-bodied with an easy carbonation and a clean finish.

Fortunately, the after taste is light as well. Carbonation is moderate. The wheat characteristics are barely perceptible. This is a light ale and may appeal to many for that reason.

It smells like a pile of decomposing grass clippings. Choking one down may be impossible, and after that you will not want another. I know this beer well, unfortunately, because as one other reviewer noted it is ubiquitous at Chicago street fests and bars. The smell coming off of dozens of pre-poured cups of this crap, and the pools of foamy 312 slop on the ground at outdoor beer tents is really nauseating. My neighbor presented me with a 12 pack for watching his cat, and it has been sitting by my front door for four months, which is somewhat vexing.

The later being a more recent example of a beer catered to appeal to those who normally drink bland American lagers. Again, this doesn't take anything away from the beer, I just seem to get the sense that Goose Island was trying to create a summer entry or lawnmower beer for someone who typically would enjoy a BMC product.

Yeast appears to contribute nothing much but cloudyness. Normally, I'd assign a tart, reserved wheat such as this to the ""good on a hot summer day"" category, but this falls short of delivering that sort of refreshment.

Aroma is a bit weak to me as most wheats have a weak aroma but I notice a clean pale malt flavor and some bready notes, but not much.
