"Poured from a bottle into a mug. Produces a very thin head which dissipates quickly. Golden with a hint of orange hue. For an unfiltered beer, there is curiously no hint of sediment. Medium to high amount of bubbly carbonation seen around the edges and in towards the middle. Smell is of wheat malts, astringent. taste is of wheat, orange, honey. Feels heavier than expected not he palette and salty. Overall a decent but forgettable brew."

"I'm trying not to be too harsh, but I really could not drink this beer. It poured well, had a nice hazy unfiltered look with a descent head (what you should expect from an unfiltered wheat beer), but immediately I could tell that I wasn't going to like it. The aroma was overwhelmingly of banana esters and sweet off 'bubble-gum' like flavors. I took a sip and it was just more of the same. After two sips I decided that I couldn't drink it. It's probably just my personal preference, since I HATE bananas. If it was a flavor that I enjoyed this probably could have been a good beer. Odd that it has such a distinct and odd flavor profile. Oh well...."

"An excellent unfiltered heff. Very smooth, but has a tangy zest to it. No much wheat or chew, but an excellent overall heff. Thing of Blue Moon but more character and flavor. Mouthfeel was ok, I found myself trying to get rid of some of the bubbles, bit I can deal deal with that. Overal I thought it was outstanding and would buy this over blue moon or pyramid."

"O-Would be highly drinkable if it weren't so aggressively carbonated. Maybe a style thing, but I wouldn't buy this again, although I would drink it if offered."
"12oz single was bottled on 4/18/13. Chilled. Pours into pint glass a sickly yellow, nicely cloudy, with a moderate white head which rapidly falls. Aroma of lemon, wheat, and a hint of clove. Sharply fizzy and of moderate body. The carbonation helps to accentuate the tart flavors here, which I'm going to attribute (having cheated and looked at the brewer's notes) to the acidulated malt. Spicy clove flavors come through in the taste as well, but not much else does. Mild and enjoyable, and it would be a great summer session wheat ale *except* for the overly carbonated mouthfeel."

"O- The great blend of flavors compliment each other with unripe fruit hops and green fruit esters in a very sessionable, drinkable beer."

"Firestone Walker's seasonal Solace pours a slightly hazed, honey-orange. An inch of white head sits atop the brew, and it fades away to leave a minimal amount of lacing. Bready malt and wheat notes create a foundation that allows slight citrus and banana aromas to shine. The same pale malt and wheat base underlies subtle hints of banana, pepper, and an earthy yeastiness. A touch of tartness rounds out this easy-drinking, medium bodied ""Summertime Fusion Wheat Beer."""
""
""
""

"A hybrid saison and wheat beer, spice notes make it bright and things interesting on an overall average brew. Easy to put down a few."

"12oz bottle, hazy, pale-golden colored ale topped with a foamy, white head that holds decent retention. Fresh aroma with plenty of yeast, wheat, citrus, faint bubblegum. Tastes are nutty, wheat, yeast, grassy, lemon zest - nice balance. Fuller bodied, creamy, nice carbonation. What I expect from a APWA. Nothing wrong with it, nothing extraordinary, but just a great example of the style."
""
"If I had known it was these easy to find Solace, I would have immediately hit the liquor store during my times of distress. Anyway, this stuff pours a hazy straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises sweet biscuit, powdered sugar, a pinch of nutmeg, a tiny touch of lemon peel, and some banana throughout the background. The taste holds notes of orange zest, coriander, and light banana. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, a nice little pale wheat, one with a mild wit character that makes it pretty easy-going."

"O: this is a really nice summer beer. A light, crisps, clean, refreshing wheat with a really clean citrus taste. Definitely worth picking up for the beach or a summer BBQ, especially if the crowd is the Blue Moon type. I'd rather drink this than a Blue Moon and probably Oberon."

"Poured a cloudy golden yellow with a one finger white head. Pretty standard for the style. Scents of clove and banana. Flavor is mild with doughy bread overtones, a bit of spice, slight citrus peel and a bit of hop bitterness on the finish. Light and refreshing. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation. Another good summer wheat beer, refreshing and sessionable without being overwhelming."
""
""
""
""
"Reminds me of, along the lines, Allagash White and Ommegang Witte. As always fresh is the best and FSW labels such visibly. Definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Excellent. Well balanced and tasty, this is the best summer seasonal I’ve had this year. I really need to try and get up to the brewery soon and try a fresh draft of this."

"O: This is a bottle from the summer that has been around for awhile. I'm sure I would enjoy it even more if it was fresh."
"Thanks mom for retrieving this one from the Left Coast. Fizzy pour that kicks up a big although very transient bubbly head leaving zero lace or trace of foam. Body is slightly hazy, honey colored. Smell is lemongrass, chalky, hint of bananas. Taste is nice. Faintly lemony, hint of bananas, light sweetness, refreshing and wet. Body is medium light and crisply carbonated, works well with the taste. Overall I could drink a half gallon of this very thirst quenching beer, even better if it wasn't January in Minnesota but rather July."
""
""
""
""
"An above average ale.."
""
"Overall this is a nice wheat beer that is very refreshing."
"Overall this is a typical wheat beer. It is technically flawless but it does not jump out as anything amazing. That being said the beer is very refreshing and rather enjoyable."

"O - Refreshing with a bolder flavor profile than most summer seasonals. Nice raw wheat character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fine, whatever, but at 6% I'd expect a very different experience, more esters to start with, and a bit more grain and maybe hops on the palate. This SHOULD be better."
""
""
"The palate is light in body and opens moderately strong on the clove but without enough banana. The fruit profile (from the yeast, of course),is a bit on the weak side, and coupled with the thin palate with bready flavors but without the fullness from the wheat, this beer does come across as flawed. In addition, the acidity, while higher than you'd expect, doesn't really work with the flavor profile. The carbonation is medium-high, adding to the acidity and keeping the finish from picking up too much flavor. While this is a rather excellent combination of an American Pale Wheat Ale and a Hefeweizen, it does, by definition, come up short on the hedonic scale. Worthy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light sap color with solid white, thick sheet. Nose of some citrusy hops, and plenty of sweet wheat with a bit of yeasty character. Very delicate flavor profile - some sweetness, some yeast, some floral tones; all low players. Way too thin for my preference and low carb as well leave this beer watery and disappointing. I'm not a fan, could be the 5 months in the bottle, but I don't find American what beers to generally be much better fresh."
""
""
""
"A good beer - flavorful, especially good in warmer weather. However, I thought it was considerably more flavorful last year, when I had it on draft a few times."
""
""
""
"Medium bodied but fuller than expected with a balance of earthy hops, tart yeast and light fruit.  Tight carbonation with spicy coriander and clove followed by lemon rind, bread and pale malts. Dry, tart finish."
"Review from 9/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a light orange amber. Mild wheat and malt aroma. Starts with a moderate wheat ale with fruit, strong citrus flavor Finish is sour, acidic and soapy. Starts out OK, but not a very pleasant finish. Medium bodied and a decent mouth feel, otherwise a rare FW miss for me. No solace here."
""
"Pours a hazy golden color with nice head. The aroma is a little on the funky side with yeasty and gummy notes. I know that's what they are going for, but for me it can be off-putting. The yeast and spices dominate the palate with hop bitterness coming through and a dry finish. It's definitely a hybrid of sorts - not a true American Pale Wheat - with certain characteristics of a Saison and even a traditional Hef. I appreciate what they are going for, but for me this is not the summer beer I wanted it to be. It's a little too busy to lay back with, but from a technical standpoint FW can be commended."
"No bottled on stamp but I saw the place on the label where it should have gone. Go figure."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Hello summertime in a bottle. If this doesn't make your list of hot summer beer, nothing will."
""
""
""
""
"DOA"
"O: Quite nice brew!"
""
""
""
""
"O: I would def. purchase again. A very tasty light wheat brew to compliment a day out during summer."
"Classic wheat beer that doesn't deviate from the formula, but is very easy on the lips. Good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This beer is simply fantastic. I'm really impressed. Drinks closer to a hefeweizen, but I can definitely taste the saison influence, particularly in the finish. Only available in the summer months? Boo! We want year-round release!"
""
"An easy drinking, well made beer. Definitely well suited for warm weather."
"D - Extra cold on a hot day, not too bad, I would bet!"
""
""
"I’ve had the Solace many times before, but this was the first time I rated it. It was just like I remembered it, decent, but not good. It is good for a June/July day, though."
"Overall this is very good. A pretty simplistic beer, but a great representation of the style"
""
""
""
"It's another flavorful beer in the lower-alcohol range, so I give it some credit. But that bitterish, cardboard aftertaste just doesn't go away. 12 oz bottle from Trader Joe's."
"O: A very good wheat beer that I would gladly drink again. And hopefully will be able to again on draft."
""
"O- Very drinkable but ultimately plain wheat beer."
"Overall: Straightforward wheat beer that doesn't have much to distinguish itself from others within the style."
""
""
"O: the overall flavor is clean and crisp. A great beer for a hot summer afternoon. A very good wheat with some German roots."
"i thought this was a very nice fruity summer wheat beer, maybe my favorite of the season thus far. pours a hazy golden to brassy orange color, with an average white head. smells like hefe yeast, banana notes, some spice. flavor is equally yeast dominated with a major fresh banana palate. also some good wheat malts in there that give it a light but flavorful body, and some late hop additions that crisp it right up in the finish and make it feel lighter than it is. feel is excellent for a summer beer, enough body there to maintain interest, but also very drinkable. a good outdoors beer. bright carbonation and quick finish make it a nice refresher without being too fruity or citric. overall a well balanced summer beer, and a major departure from the woody hop bombs firestone walker usually produces."
""
""
"Nevertheless, it is very refreshing. The inclusion of lemon-like spices make a great substitute for an actual lemon or orange, and it's still full of great flavors. I really wish this was as juicy in feel (or spicier in taste), but it's still a good take on the style and is recommended a try."
""
"Overall: I thought I'd try something different. Firestone markets it as a limited edition. It should remain that way. To be fair, I usually go for stouts, mostly porters."
""
""
"Overall: This one may have a bit of age on it - hence the prominence of the sour twang; still, the combination of flavors of an American Wheat and a Saison are not something I would really crave again"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'll be curious to see how this does in the warmer upcoming weather. Seems like a nice refreshing American Pale Wheat Ale."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was a delicious version of american wheat ale. Probably one of my more favorite ones. Flavors are well rounded and you could easily drink alot of these."
""
""
""
""
"Pours hazy orange with slight head that fades quickly. The banana and cloves remind me of a German hef rather than an american...Also oranges as well ...a bit of spice from the yeast reminds me a little of a saison...A great summer beer. I love you Firestone Walker"
"Overall: an easy to consume beer. This one is not overly exciting either, but drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy, maize/gold color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of yeast, hint of alcohol, citrus, hint of hop, and a hint of dough. Fits the style of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of dough, yeast, slight citrus, hint of alcohol, and a hint of hop. Overall, poor appearance, but good aroma, feel, and body."

"O – Wow, is this good. A complex, flavorful, brew that Blue Moon only wishes it could be. This is my new favorite for the style. Kudos to Firestone Walker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this beer does not wow me in any way. It is decent, but like a lot of other APWAs I don't feel the need to revisit this well again anytime soon."
"Overall impression: Great wheat beer, could definitely enjoy several of these. I can't think of another wheat off hand that I'd rather have."
"Taste is grain, light raisiny alcohol, fermented pears, hint of clove-like bubblegum, lemony zestiness. It's a bit sweet, but has good, well-rounded character and good depth. It has a nice, full feel and is very enjoyable."
"Overall Impression- This Hefe was almost stronger than the ABV's are listed! I didn't mind this though since the citrus flavor was so dominant. Since this is a limited release, I don't think I'm going to be seeing this one anytime soon (until next summer if I go back to Cali)."
"I am drinking this in the mid to upper 40's and it really brings out some great flavors. Still clean and easy drinking but tons of layers of flavors. Very easy drinking beer that I would love to have one tap."
"O: I didn't believe. I thought Firestone was a meh brewery. This beer proves me wrong. Nicely done, Firestone."
"Pours a murky honey orange with a 1 inch fluffy bone colored head that fades to a small cap. Sticky chunks of foam line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat, spices, yeast, and some citrus aromas. Taste is of wheat bread, mild spices, yeast, and some citrus zest. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good wheat beer that is nice and refreshing to drink."
"Dr: It's very drinkable, and with how light it is I'm impressed it's 6%. I'd have it again on draught. I wish it were more complex, but for what it's trying to do it's successful. I look forward to trying more beers from this brewery."
"Poured a bright golden color, with a decent cap of bubbly off-white foam. Aromas of floral hops, somewhat grassy, bubblegum and biscuit. On the palate, this one was light to medium bodied, with flavors of good hops, as well as some pears, peaches and biscuit malt."
"O: Beyond its lackluster appearance, nothing really wrong with the beer. Nose a little muted and maybe should be a bit more carbonated. Just seemed to have a couple misses here and there."
"Overall a very drinkable and flavorful wheat ale."
"O- not a huge fan of wheat beers, but always good alternative on a hot day. Better of the style in my opioin. I could probably sit down and drink a 6 pack to myself. Light and resfreshing. Wish it came in cans so I can take it to the pool! Lol"
"O: Disappointing, only because this is Firestone. I'm getting to a point where if their beer doesn't blow me away then I'm disappointed. Still a good beer."
"The aroma was odd. Very light and almost non existent at times. What was there seemed a touch artificial to me to be honest. Light grain and some off fruit notes, not very appealing at all. The flavor was a little bit better, but still very weak in my eyes. It started with a nice rush of light grain, some mild fruitiness as well. Light touches of peach and passion fruit I guess highlighting it, but leaving quickly with only a touch of light grass like flavor in the finish, which was itself short-lived."
"Hazy yellow/amber with a thin skim and collar of white bubbles. Wheat cracker aroma, slight fruitiness, toast, mild citrus and spiciness. Low bitterness with wheat and malt, not a lot of sweetness, toasty with a flash of grassy hops and slight spiciness in the finish. Light bodied with carbonation on the low side, fairly dry. It's well done for what it is, a subtle beer that's not out to clobber you with over the top aromas or flavours."
"Overall, I was not too impressed especially at $10 for a 6 pack. It's watery with too much banana for me. It does get a bit better as it warms."
"O- A great summer beer. A Bavarian style hef. Flavorfull without the fillingness."
"A refreshing summer seasonal ale that's worth a try."
"Overall: A tasty-enough beer, but, I rate it around average. A bit more sweet spice to it than anticipated for an American wheat ale. It's likely that this one is better on draught, so I will keep my eyes out for it."
"Overall, this is definately a good version of the style. I'm not sure why the other reviewers don't see it that way. Maybe if they used wild yeasts, barrel aged it, and made it 12% ABV it would score higher."
"I don't know that Firestone Walker could release any brand of ordinary-style beer that would come anywhere close to matching the ratings of their limited, higher gravity offerings. Still, Solace is a terribly disappointing offering from a brewery capable of not only complex blended beers, but great conventional brands like Union Jack and Double Barrel as well."
"Overall I did not like this. I generally don't like wheats or Hefe's. So for me to not like this is pretty on par. For the style I must say it stayed musty and earthy. This was a bit sweet though."
"O- Great summer beer! Refreshing!"
"I'm not nearly as learned as most, I'd bet, but this reminded me more of a saison ala Great Divide's Colette. Somewhere between juicy and semi-dry, this is beer has a smooth, semi-full mouthfeel, with spicy and fruity notes. I'm getting a flashback from my cider days in Edinburgh.There's also yeast, of course. Carbonation is assertive. Definitely worth a try!"
"Firestone Walker does so much great...but maybe they need to revamp the recipe for Solace to really drive sales on this one."
"A solid if unexceptional witbier. Fine."
"O: The flavor was decent enough but the carbonation was distracting. I would drink this again if it were there but I don’t think I’d spend any money on it."
"Good, wouldn't turn it down, but there are more interesting summer offerings."
"O - Very drinkable and a decent summer beer overall. Probably would not go well with food."
"O: Overall, a decent beer. It kind of reminds me of a Belgian farmhouse ale, but not completely there. It is a little sweet for my liking, and the taste just makes me want to have a nice saison."
"I’m not finding solace in Solace. The flavors aren't bad, but there are better, more refreshing wheats out there."
"O: Though I'm not a fan of the style, Firestone's Solace is a nice little beer. The ability to showcase more then the banana profile really made this one worth returning to sip after sip. Yet another drinkable brew from Firestone-Walker."
"Cloudy gold pour with a wispy white head. Aroma is sweet and fruit-salady, mainly banana with a candied citrus note. Smooth wheaty palate with a refreshing citric twang and the odd watermelon seed note. Drinkable and quenching, maybe a bit on the watery side. A nice warm-weather beer."
"overall this is a nice beer, very drinkable but a bit too sweet"
"T: And here's where it goes wrong for me. Starts with wheaty/hef taste and then goes to a creamy finish with some orange, honey and spice. The problem is that it's way over-carbonated. The flavors are subtle and it feels like this beer would have a lot to offer if the carbonation didn't blast all the flavor off your tongue. So much potential but not that great in the end."
"In the upper echelon of wheat beers with Sierra Nevada Kellerweisse and Bell's Oberon. A spicy, yeasty brew with soft complimenting fruitiness and slight hops for balance. Thank you Firestone for showing the public that wheat beers can be interesting. I will definitely return to this during the hotter months."
"Carbonation produces a light tingle when first sipped, but isn't really present otherwise. Highly drinkable beer, as the finish is crisped by the hops that are there. Well balanced, tasty wheat beer."
"Why just a summer seasonal? The brewer surely knows this rivals many of the well- known Wheat Ales. Firestone raises the bar for Wheat Ales everywhere."
"Drink>Probably couldn't have much of this. Sad face."
"Drinkability is good. A nice refreshing beverage. Strikes me as being a good gateway to craft beer."
"Pretty boring beer overall. Not necessarily bad, but decidedly mediocre."
"Poured a murky golden orange with yellow highlights that had a thin head and left a little lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma really had a big wheat character with banana, clove spice, slight citrus and bready malty notes. Upfront on the palate the maltiness stike first that did mesh quite well with the banana and clove spice flavors but also had slight citrus accents. The brew was medium in body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a sweet slight citric but bready grainy malt finish. It drank alright but not great and was pretty tasty. I could probably drink 2 12oz but that's it. Good offering from firestone;good job."
"I love the flavor, could not care less what the officionados think about it, this is very good beer. Let's not make false pretense with a bunch of over analytic Bull Shit...it's a good beer."
"d - A pretty easy drinking pale ale. I would have liked more fruit in the smell and less musty/earthy tones, but the taste made up for it. Could definitely drink a few of these. Would give another shot."
"Poured into a Firestone Walker shaker pint glass, Solace pours a hazy yellow-orangey-pale brown with a slight white head that dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing. Aroma is very slight but some agitation and warming yields a mild fruitiness. Definitely an American Wheat. Taste is fruity, but not overly, with no real hop bitterness. Aftertaste is kinda earthy. Mouthfeel is crisp and brisk across the tongue. With such a light body and mild flavor, but still packing a decent 6% abv, this beer is highly drinkable and would make a great summer in the backyard beer."
"Firestone Walker Brewing Company solace--Craftily Unfiltered Ale--Limited Release 2010--12 oz. Bottle. 6.00% ABV. 15 IBU's. (3.75 / 5.0) Wheat Ale--Foamy mild lace white head.

Tangy dry sweet creamy malty wheat mild fruit delicate spice smooth refreshing body. Dry citrus end. Sampled. 8/19/2010. 6- Pack--$9.49."
"Drinkability is great, even at 6%. Great summer beer, hot weather is perfect for this beer."
"Not a huge fan of wheat beers and to be honest didnt know this was one when I bought it. Really like the flavor of this beer as it's got a distinct flavor that I dont find in any other weizens around. At %6 it's pretty worthy and very drinkable at that. Has become a regular pick up and turned me around on good wheat beer."
"Firestone I always want to like all there beers cause there brewery is 30 minutes from my house. This one just wasn't what they can do. Advice is if this is you first firestone try the double barrel its a much better beer."
"D - This is probably the most flavorful American Wheat Ive had! Flavors are awesome & thirst quenching, a few of these would be great with fish or chicken. Very drinkable & highly recommended. Cheers!"
"d: One of the better wheats i've had so far, very drinkable."
"Drinkability - A very unimposing beer. Not really a good conversation starter, but good enough in and of itself. Easy to come back to."
"D- This is a great, refreshing summer beer. Not one that I would drink everyday but its a nice change of pace."
"Success. Firestone Walker has created an American Wheat Ale that's worth a damn, and worth at least a six-pack purchase for the summer."
"Above average drinkability."
"Its not my favorite for sure but I might not mind drinking these on a hot day, but thats about it."
"Flavor carries forward the wheat influence and is somewhat sweet of lemon, particularly given the light carbonation which seems at odds to the rest of the six pack. Offers a smooth feel and finish with a nice touch of spice on the close and a long citric finish."
"D: Goes down very easy and it wouldn't be hard to session...however, I'm not sure I'd really want more than one, it's just not an interesting beer. Glad I just got a single of this."
"T: Nice creamy smooth body with a little bite of carbonation underneath. Flavor of mostly spices that slowly rolls into a long, earthy/grainy finish."
"Very drinkable beer, I am quite impressed with it."
"The body is smooth, crisp and well-rounded. Drinkability was very nice, it went down easily and left me wanting another one. Another fine brew from a fine brewery."
"When poured into a pint glass, the color was an hazy golden yellow with an orange hue. The smell of yeast and mild hops were evident in the aroma. The taste had a pleasant flavor of fruits and spice. Although, even with the pleasant flavor, it was just a little on the weak side, of flavor. But, overal it would be a great summer sipper!"
"D: Lack of taste or complexity definitely makes this less drinkable, but it's light and refreshing if anything."
"A bit disappointed in this offering, as I'm a fan of most other FW beers. The whole beer just seems muddy and confused."
"Not what I expect from FWB but I guess they need a patio wheat beer to compete in that growing and lucrative market. That being said this is pretty good for the style though it verges on the Wit side with some cloves and banana notes in the nose and finish. Very drinkable though a little thin this is patio fodder and worth picking up for that reason."
"overall: This beer needs the yeast! without swirl and pour at the end it would get a much lower grade from me. I am shocked they dont tell you to pour this like a German hefe. A very good beer."
"Drinkability: Good summertime beer. Nothing to write home about. But defiantly a good summer BBQ beer. Will seek out again."
"D - Out of this world. Instantly a summer BBQ must have IMO"
"Firestone Walker deserves credit for not brewing yet another bland American pale wheat ale that would bore the palate of most craft beer lover to tears. Solace is an outstanding summertime quaffer. I find some solace in the fact that it's available on-line. Too bad shipping is ridiculously expensive."
"Light golden fairly clear body (chill haze?) one finger white head, medium dissipation with some lacing. Nose is pretty spicy, coriander with some lemon zest. The taste is quite sweet, more like a wit than a APWA, a bit too sweet for the style, may be attributable to the yeast, a bit funky. Mouthfeel is medium, minimal effervescence. Pretty drinkable, but once again too sweet for the style. My least favorite Firestone Walker beer to date."
"Drinkability - I guess if I was drinking this on a hot summer day it might be better, but I'm just not feeling this beer."
"Kind of an oxidized malty flavor and sweet wheat. Somewhat creamy with too heavy of an alcohol presence for a summer brew. Almost gets cloying, but a little hop bite on the end keeps it from being so. Undercarbonated, for sure as not even a swirl can not get any bubbles to rise to the top. I was really looking forward to drinking this, my first FW brew. I would like to try it again to give it a fair shake, but this bottle was a bit disappointing."
"Mouthfeel is light and has a smooth amount of carbonation."
"drinkability is high, not my favorite wheat beer, but definitely one I will have again."
"D - Very refreshing on a warm day, and I liked the mix of styles. Will pick up more of this while it is in season."
"Had on tap at Lucky Baldwin's in Pasadena, CA. Quite cloudy medium maize colour. About a finger of whitish head that disippated very quickly. Smells like a wheat beer. Tastes citruisy with bready malts. Reminds me a lot of New Belgium Sunshine Wheat or Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat. A tiny bit of spiciness, a smidge of cloves, absolutely no hint of bananas. Mouthfeel is thin but refreshing, very drinkable. Decent wheat beer, almost approaching a Saison, but nothing to write home about."
"Pours with a hazy dark gold color with generous white head at first that dissipates to not much soon thereafter. Nose is very faint with some lemon/orange. Palate has light malt & wheaty flavors with a hint of citrus. Light bodied and light on the finish. Easy drinking."
"City Beer Store. Oddly bland and boring for Firestone Walker. I don't think this one was a very good choice for their new six-pack beer. Pours a cloudy light golden color with a decent white head that dissipated a bit quickly. The aroma is weak - mild but decent malt, a touch of citrus/orange, nondescript yeast. The flavor is just nondescript. I'm not a big fan of ""summer beers," and I imagine that was what they were shooting for here, but this is a beer that I won't remember in a week. For that matter, this beer is getting a healthy style bump - I don't get why there are so many bland American-style wheat ales. Sorry, FW, you make a lot of incredible beers, but this isn't one of them."
"Really not sure what they were going for. Too bubbly with a light mouthfeel."
"This is great on a hot summer day."
"Not a bad beer, just would like some more flavor. No offense to the women out there, but I think this is a good beer for the ladies."
"Medium body, light carbonation. Pretty easy drinking, just left wanting slightly more from the beer than it gave me."
"D: One of the only ""meh"" offerings I've come across from Firestone Walker. This isn't bad, but I wouldn't really be interested in having this one again."
"Aroma is rising bread dough. Taste is somewhat puzzling though. First thing I thought there was some macro-type corniness which transitioned to a Belgian type yeast. Has all the goodness of a wheat beer with the take no prisoners yeast flavor. I like it though it probably won't be have a regular place in my cooler."
"This is pretty drinkable, and definitely a reasonable summer wheat beer. Very enjoyable in the right situation. I heard this one was a flop from one of the first people I knew who had it, but I'd disagree. This one should go over pretty well with Joe Sixpack and shouldn't offend the serious beer geek. For an American Pale Wheat Ale, it's pretty damned good."
"Poured a cloudy yellow with good carbonation and a nice white head. Nose is light wheat, banana and citrus. Taste is some citrus, banana and clove. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied with clove, banana and some wheat. Drinkability is good. Would drink again but not to seek out."
"**EDIT** I think it bears mentioning that this review was done as this beer was classified as a saison, not an American Wheat Beer. I guess that's the problem with ""hybrids"" and reviewing according to BJCP style guidelines."
"They should come up with a new term to describe how drinkable this stuff is. Would be perfect on a hot sunny day or for just lounging and watching the Royals kick some ass!! Yeah, I said it. Royals!!"
"Are they testing this in the Vegas area? I think the last 5 reviews are all from us in town! Anyways tried this from a pint glass. Hazy golden, on the light side of the color spectrum, with virtually no head and subsequently no retention or lacing. I was really surprised about that. Smell was very pleasant, almost hefe like. Some banana, yeast, straw and biscuit, a little citrus. Taste was good but not as nice as the smell. A subtle dry malt with some lemon and citrus. Some grassy/straw parts there too. Overall thought it was under carbonated and left a dry feeling in the mouth behind. This was not a bad beer at all. I applaud Firestone for doing something that probably isnt their specialty and doing a good job. Just not a great job."
"Witbiers are my go to for warmer weather, but considering I can't ever get Allagash White this is going to be my new choice! If it stays stocked that is. This was very smooth and drinkable, and at 6% its not really a slouch in the ABV department."
"D- It's very drinkable, but finishing one doesn't make me instinctively reach for another the way some other summer session beers might on a nice, warm spring day like this."
"Overall, I really dig this beer. Very well balanced and drinkable. I swear, one day I will find something on here to write a scathing review about."
"As mentioned, I enjoy nearly everything Firestone puts out, but this beer misses the mark IMO and I'd say it just might be my least favorite of anything they've released. Maybe it will grow on me with time, but for now I'll be reaching for their other beers first."
"D: This could make a nice summer refresher, but it's not very complex and is really more like an American Wheat Beer than a Saison."
"Quite drinkable, the smoothness, sweet and sour dichotemy, and great fruity flavors in here make this an extremely enjoyable beer. It's got the base of a wheat beer but it's so much more at the same time. Whereas many wheat brews seem to require a slice of lemon or orange to make them drinkable this one stands all on its own and I think that's the way a beer should be broken into."
"D: Great replacement for Blue Moon-like beers in my fridge: Light, refreshing, and just way too easy to drink. Seems like it would pair very well a salad on a warm day."
"Drinkability is OK. This is a sort of weird beer that doesn't really have a style. I would have preferred a saison and a wheat beer as separate beers."
"Nothing really speacial going on here, but I otherwise thoght this a nice enough beer."
"Drinkability: I preferred the preliminary batch I tried about six weeks ago, which had a lot more funk and sourness than this version. However, Firestone is trying to woo Blue Moon and Shock Top drinkers, and I believe this will do just that. Solace is a very easy-drinking, balanced, wheat ale. I'll happily purchase a six pack or two. (4.5)"
