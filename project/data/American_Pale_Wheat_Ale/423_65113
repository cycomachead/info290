Called a Hoppy Wheat. Hops are certainly present but not overboard which I was expecting. And that's not a bad thing. Loses some head but never completely. A little lace.  Goes down nice with no bite or lingering aftertaste. Very good and at 5.50% Very Drinkable  Bartender.....I'll have one more.","chuckpalka","Saturday at 04:34 PM"

A good amount of sticky ring-like lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the sides of the glass.. The aroma is of pine and floral hops for the most part. Pretty much the same for the taste with some citrus zest also. Really not as hoppy as you might think and not a I.P.A. style brew either which I am not a big fan of. Just a very slight bitter finish is noted BUT wasn't bad and didn't last long. medium-bodied with good carbonation. Overall not a bad brew as I am not really a big fan of American Pale Ales for the most part.","BeerWithMike","Mar 26, 2015"

It does have the citrusy bread smell associated with most wheats. I was a little underwhelmed. Its called Hoppy Wheat yet no smell of hops, no real taste of hops, and it looks like the IBU level is in the 20s. I expect quite a bit more for a beer with Hoppy in the name. That being said, it does have a different taste than a typical wheat. Its very drinkable and is a nice twist on wheat beers. Just wish they'd hopped it up a bit more.","MikeyLegend","Feb 12, 2015"

It pours hazy pale straw under a thick, moussey 2” finely bubbled off-white foam cap. The flavors are very well rounded and the body and texture suggest the presence of some Belgian yeast. It has more hops than a normal wheat beer but they are restrained and not over powering. A hint of caramel on the palate combined with traces of bready wheat constrains and balances the hops. This is full bodied with above average creamy soft carbonation.","pat61","Jan 24, 2015"

The liquid is cloudy but does not display any floating particulate, widespread and super-active bubbles fill the glass, overall a light orange to yellow color. The nose shows off the wheat proudly but it’s mainly an explosion of grapefruit and orange citrus, not overly hoppy, there is a bubblegum to pie dough element, at the same time there’s a burst of black pepper and green tea, strong presence without being overpowering. Medium-bodied, sour from all that muscular citrus, the powerful carbonation both brings prickle and limits the soaking in of the pucker factor. Floral with that same bubblegum aspect, delivers more peach, apricot, cherry fruit flavors here. Notes of clove and lesser pepper. Not that dry but closer to that end of the spectrum even as you never feel the flavors are truncated as a result. Maybe a too clingy for full-on refreshment but its liveliness is very attractive and it is easy to keep on sipping. Pulls it off well.","farrago","Jan 04, 2015"

It has a really good flavor, don't get me wrong, but the overall experience lacks in something. I don't want to sound snobbish for a BA, but it doesn't seem as elegant; and NEBCo is brewing out of the back parking lot of a car dealership. What I mean is this beer is best for warm weather whereas NEBCo's Alpha Weizen I could but can't drink all yr round.","orcrist_cleaver","Nov 02, 2014"

The only thing that might identify this beer as a wheat beer to me is by the appearance...there really was no tell-tale sign in the aroma or flavor. The hop aroma and flavors are excellent. If you are an APA fan where you want a lot of hop flavor and aroma but not a ton of bitterness, this is right up your alley. If you don't like wheat beers, don't be turned off by this beer because it doesn't show. If you do like wheat beers, this leaves a lot to be desired. Overall it is a really good beer though, and the framework really relies on the hops...and if it were a house that frame would be made of solid oak.","teromous","Oct 18, 2014"

While Oberon is and remains the standard for traditional pale wheat ales, this in my book is a marvelous middle ground between Oberon and A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' which is a wheat ale that drinks like an IPA. This is definitely a wheat beer, but has just enough additional hops to really stand out without blurring the style line too much. Very impressed.","Beric","Aug 22, 2014"

Taste is almost all wheat beer. Not bad at all, but not really any hop flavor. 3 or 4 years ago I would have absolutely loved this beer. It is just missing that kick that Sumpin' Sumpin' and Gumballhead have. Don't get me wrong. Still a very good beer and I will drink the 6 I have happily. However, if you are looking for a true "hoppy wheat" try one of the others. If you are looking for something more balanced, or even tipping the scale the other way, I would recommend this for sure.","WesMantooth","Jul 15, 2014"

Smell is nice fruity orange with a little sweet malts in the background to balance things out fairly well. Taste is quite quite malty that reminds me of a little sweet syrup with a little Belgian yeast. Not too much but a tiny but of bananas. The hop bill is quite subdued but helps balance things out to some extent. This is a malt forward beer. Mouthfeel is slightly thick for the style due to carbonation. Overall not a bad beer but not a good one. It's just sort of OK. I like their Smokestack Series. Their normal beer is just a not that great.","NeedBeerHere","Dec 20, 2013"

Aroma of lemon citrus, light stone fruit and citrus hops. Flavor is lemon, biscuit wheat, light wheat, finishing with citrus rind and mild grassy hops. Light bodied with nice peppery carbonation. An interesting take on a wheat ale, with a distinct emphasis on the lemon citrus and a deft hand with hopping. The lemon is so dominant that this seems almost to veer off into fruit-malt-beverage territory, but the quality of the wheat body and citrus hops carry through for a pleasant wheat ale experience. Light and refreshing.","LiquidAmber","Oct 05, 2013"

The taste has a nice pale, and wheat like flavors, with hints of hops to finish the taste. Good flavors, refreshing, could use a little more carbonation and was slightly watery. Overall however this is a very nice hoppier wheat style beer.","vette2006c5r","May 30, 2013"

I taste some fruity lighter yeast, delicate but raw wheat malt, and a fairly aggressive hoppy profile that year round boulevard concoction so curious. its got some pineapple notes too, which I find fitting. lighter in body but fulfilling texturally. well carbonated and clean but long in the finish, as contradictory as that seems. this is a beer that asks more questions than it answers, but I like it a lot, especially at this price point. boulevard is on a hot streak in my book, cant wait to try the wheat wine!","StonedTrippin","Feb 18, 2013"

Not much for malt character; faint wheat. Mouth-feel is thinner than expected for a wheat ale, moderate carbonation.

The aroma was a mild citrus with the sweetness of wheat in the background. The initial taste was sweet and hoppy. Notes of pineapple, peach and a little pine were evident. The sweetness of the wheat becomes more evident in the aftertaste as the hops fade. The carbonation is a little more potent than I might have expected, causing the fruity hops to be brushed away quickly. This is a smooth and easy drinker that could hit a wide audience.

4.56,16.3,3.5,5,4.5,3.5,5,"I really hope that this... whatever it is (test batch, brewers' experiment, whatever) becomes an actual product in the future. This is every bit the peer of Lagunitas' Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale or Three Floyds' Gumbalhead in the category of hopped-up American Pale Wheat Ale. Super delicious and super drinkable. This deserves a wide release in bottles.","Reaper16","Jan 06, 2011"
