"This actually surprised me, the lemon smell is right off the bat, and you can really taste it in the flavor as well. I really like the lemon flavor in a summer beer and this does not disappoint. This is just a solid beer and doesn't try to do too much and knows what it is."

"pours a clear golden with a small white head. barely perceptible light grain aroma. taste begins with some honey sweetness, then a hawaiian bread middle, and a lightly earthy finish. mouthfeel is light, medium carbonation. overall a decent beer though a little bit bland."
""
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, there are definitely a lot of other beers in the style that I would pick first."

"More sweet, touch of corn, touch of wheat, lemon on the first sip. Just too much of the honey/sweetness thing for me to really get behind this beer. They should bulk up the wheat to offset this. Not a horrible beer, pretty much what you'd expect. Feed these to unsuspecting women in the summer."
"O: Great improvement coming from Blue Moon. While the beer is good, it won't have that lasting appeal other APAs have."
"overall, not a great beer by a long shot, but far from a drainpour. i can think of worse things to be offered at a summer barbecue-type setting."
"The drinkability is relatively high. Although it lacks in the nose and taste, it's not terrible. It's a pleasant enough sessionable beer. Barbeque worthy if nothing else."
"The beer pours a clear golden yellow color with a white head. The aroma is grain and wheat with some grass from the hops mixed in. I don't get any honey in the aroma. The flavor is somewhat bland. I get a lot of wheat notes as well as quite a bit of sugar, possibly from the honey. I also get a little bit of a honey flavor. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Overall: A solid beer here. The honey addition really makes this otherwise 'normal' pale wheat ale something really special...and they did it perfectly."
"Overall: Worth a shot."
"Okay beer, but in my opinion Blue Moon's original Witbier and Winter offering are much better, heck I would even take a Harvest Moon over this. I would recommend this to the BMC drinker who wanted something a bit ""craftier""."
"This beer pours out a little on the clear side. The head comes and goes not leaving much behind. The smell is mostly sweet malts and some wheat. The taste is pretty light and has a slight honey sweetness to it. There is a hint of yeast in there too but not much. The mouthfeel is pretty clean and smooth. A bit too light overall for me. Would have liked something a little more flavorful."
"Overall, Honey Moon (or whatever the name's been changed to) is average at best. I've had other Blue Moon seasonals that I believe were better, but I'd still take this over any of the Coors line up. It's a nice, light, easy drinking beer for the summer season; have one while grilling or mowing the lawn. But if you're looking for more taste, look elsewhere ..."
"Mouth feel is light and thin making this brew easy drinking. Its an original concept but doesn't offer anything all that great."
"I'm growing tired of all these pseudo-craft BMC endeavors. Leave the brewing to the real craftsmen and go back to your chemistry experiments."
"A nice summer thirst quencher. Light gold with a fast fading head. No lacing to speak of. Smell is light wheat malt and lemony citrus. Nice clean taste with sweet wheat malt, orangey citrus notes, a bit of mild hops leading to a smooth honeyed finish. Some spices as well. Medium weight with a mild effervescence. Goes down quite nicely. A solid brew for the grilling season."
"D: Overall, it isn't really anything special. I would've liked to see more input from honey attributes."
"Drinking this during vacation and on the beach. Even then, not all that appealing. Luckily I have plenty of Sweetwater and Palmetto to get me through. Not something I would recommend and even a week offering for a Blue Moon beer."
"First off, I never got the chance to try Full Moon, Honey Moon, or the Rising Moon, therefor I cannot compare the two, however I have heard from beer drinkers that the Honey Moon was quite nice and not bad for a Coors product. I wasn't too excited about the recipe change. The Winter Abbey was okay, The Spring Blonde was okay, and im anxious to try the new Harvest Moon. This one on the other hand has some hope. I do not like wheat in beer, especially Hefs, Belgian Whites are okay for the most part but never hit it out of the park. This one didn't do that either, but it still was tasty, it has lots of sweet honey flavor that goes pretty well with the wheat and citrus. Only problem is that its kinda flat. Thats what Shock Top has that Blue Moon doesn't, the carbonation. It just seems right with ST, you look at original Wits like Hoegaarden, they're all super crisp, they all have sediment, it just feels right. I hope Blue Moon can do a decent job on the Fall brew. Go pick this one up its very refreshing and very easy to drink. Stay thirsty my friends!"
"O/D-I truly don't mind normal Blue Moon. This one, along with the Spring seasonal are the only two I have tried. Both were not very good."
"O: Not necessarily a beer I would have seeked out, but enjoyed it. Not overly complex but something that would be good to drink after mowing the lawn."
"O- If its the only thing to drink, don't fear, it doesn't taste bad. thats the only good thing you can say as on all other accounts its a failure."
"D - Not very good. I will say that I don't actively dislike regular Blue Moon, but from what I have experienced, their seasonals really do suck epically. The malt is thin and somehow manages to taste strange and kind of artificial. This was one of the few truly drain pour worthy beers that I have ever encountered."
"Overall - not a bad brew, but not terribly complicated. It's a good mix and makes for a good general drinking beer."
"A disappointment. Most Blue Moon brews are not half-bad at best, and at least drinkable at their worst. This beer is the latter. Overly sweet, adjuncty and just not very good."
"Well for starters, the appearance of this is awful, it looks like an average macro lager, it is completely yellow, and it only is cloudy in certain areas, most of it is completely see through, which is not acceptable from a wheat beer. The head disappears in seconds and leaves very little lacing. Overall I'm not pleased with the appearance on this. The smell is very small, I get a little honey, and a little bit of that macro lager smell, maybe even some corn in there, not too great on the smell. The only reason the smell isn't a 2.5 also is because it's a step up from a macro lager, the appearance is exactly like a macro lager, where as the smell is a small step up. I get very little honey on this beer, and I get mostly generic beer taste, there is a little honey which makes it nice to drink, but mostly it's not the most amazing taste ever. It's not a god awful taste, but it really just tastes like a macro with honey in it, so how can I like that? It is refreshing and light, so it's easy to drink, but other than that there aren't too many redeeming factors. The mouthfeel is pretty crappy for a wheat ale. Overall a pretty average, perhaps below average beer here."
"Blue Moon Brewing Company--Adolph J. Coors Brewing Company--Blue Moon Summer Honey Wheat--Seasonal Collection--Wheat Ale Brewed With Orange Peel With Clover Honey Added--2011 12 oz. Bottle. 5.20% ABV. 10 IBUâ€™s? (4.0 / 50) Thin thin lace white head. Clear thin bright gold color. Spicy orange peel wheat ester mild hop front. Crisp zesty refreshing dry sweet mild orange honey citrus wheat body. Lingering cloying rich clover honey notesat back of the tongue. Crisp tangy dry sweet mild citrus spice end. Mild orange peel notes & very zesty rich honey flavors. 3rd bottle starts to taste a little harsh. Sampled 3/29/2011. Purchased 6-Pack for $6.99 @ Fred Meyer--Ballard, Seattle on 3/29/2011."
"Final thought - $12 a 12 pack, this is the beer you can drink all day, all spring and all summer. Enjoy it nice and cold. Not an A beer, but in it's category it sure is"
"A sweet, light flavored, and light bodied beer. Intended to be served cold on hot days, this beer holds up better than some other summer beers to warming. Some malt and wheat flavor lingers into the finish along with a modicum of light orange flavor."
" Each mouthful takes me to a black sandy beach in Fiji. This goes perfect with a higher end cigar."
"Pours a hazy pale yellow color with a thick rocky white head that sticks around awhile and some lacing. Smells of wheat gluten and some sweetness and maybe some orange peel. Taste is terrible. Bitterness blended with sparkling water. Terrible beer. Mouthfeel is thin. And drinkability is poor because flavor is terrible."
"Honey Moon is an average summer brew - however, I much prefer Blue Moon Belgian White."
"Honey Moonhas a light straw colour and a decent head that lasts about a minute but always maintains lacing. This beer smells like wet barn straw. There isn't much flavour to begin with but the honey really comes through in the aftertaste. It's a pleasant and extremely drinkable beer."
"D= session if you were in the mood. I'm not a big fan of the newly popular Blue Moon or its Belgian but this is nice stuff. Might be nice with some donuts or chocolate."
"Blue Moon's summer seasonal is a clear amber wheat ale brewed with clover honey and orange peel for added zing. The flavor is overwhelmingly sweet, and heavy on the honey, though Honey Moon feels lighter and less filling than the signature Blue Moon, so it's a better fit for those steamy summer days. Pretty tasty stuff...not too complex but refreshing just the same."
"Hey, Blue Moon, let's just be friends."
"This is a better than average summer beer. It smells and tastes like honey with a hint of orange and lemon. It is sweet without being too sweet. The mouthfeel is a little too heavy for a summer beer. I would like it better if it was a little lighter. It is easy to drink a couple of these."
"The yellow bottle and ""honey"" title should let you know what's going on and it isn't wonderful tho it is technically sweet. It feels alright, smells alright, and drinks alright, so that's passable for a seasonable although it doesn't come close to making me feel relaxed and summery. This beer cuts corners to preserve the honey, which is lame."
"Overall not a good showing from BM. A shame since their regular Blue Moon is tasty on tap, even though its made by one of the big guys. They should scrap the seasonals."
"Conclusion: If I get drug along to a place where all they have is generic lagers and perhaps a Blue Moon on tap, I'll take a Blue Moon if I'm in a beer mood. Especially on draft, it can kinda hit the spot. No, I'm not a BMC guy, but I have no problem admitting that if it's not old or served with dirty lines, a Blue Moon is sometimes just damn tasty (esp. if served in a black 'n tan fashion w/Guinness). Their seasonals, however, should be avoided. This is the best one of 'em, but that's not saying much..."
"Drinkability: This tastes like a bad pilsner mixed with honey. I appreciate Blue Moon, but this beer is a one and done for me. The sweetness is borderline cloying at times and does not mix well."
"Ive always been a fan of blue moon, this summer ale is quite good."
"A nice, muddled sweetness makes this beer an adequately drinkable summer quaffer, given its ubiquity (stateside, at least) and price point."
"Thin head disapeared quickly. Not much of anything to smell. Nice color. Very slight honey flavor, even less citrus. Not a bad beer, but nothing exceptional. This is one of those beers that you forget about because it is right in the middle. Not good, not bad, its just there. It's a blue suit, a plain t-shirt, a romantic comedy."
"Poured from the bottle into my new pint glass from Barefoot Bernie's in OBX NC. Thin wispy head only lasted a few seconds then dissipated into nothing. Smell was bright and citrusy with a bit of sweetness coming through due to the honey. Taste was somewhat bland with the macro wheat taste and a bit of honey. Somewhat sweet. Mouthfeel was thin and drinkability was good. Would be good to have a few by the pool but not really something a beer advocate would drink routinely."
"Although not technically a ""light"" beer, this Summer Ale has a light taste and feel to it. It is seasoned with just a hint of both citrus and honey, giving it a bit of a lemonade-y quality. The head is light and frothy and fades fast. Overall it's fairly insubstantial, but it's the kind of beer you could drink quite a few of on a hot summer day. Not great, not bad."
"Bottle: Poured a light golden color ale with a small foamy head with OK retention and no lacing. Aroma consists of light wheat malt with notes of orange peel and honey. Taste is also a nice mix between some wheat malt with notes of orange peel and honey. Overall this is quite bland with a limited flavour profile."
" ~ One was enough for me. As for summer ales I've had better. That being said, this isn't all that bad a brew for a big box brand. I will say it was a decent try on behalf of the brewery."
"While not as heavy as its older brother, Blue Moon. I really enjoyed this beer. It is incredibly drinkable and leaves a wonderful after taste. It's very smooth with a slightly sweet aftertaste. The coloring isn't as deep but it's quite lovely. I highly recommend it."
"Drinkability- 3.5 out of 5. It's pretty good for a Summer beer, but that doesn't really change the fact that it's a bit one-dimensional. I could drink a few of these, but not for the taste-- just because they go down easily. The honey would be more fitting in a heavier Fall wheat beer."
"Drinkability is good, especially for a summer afternoon barbeque."
"D: For a macro beer it's not too shabby. The lingering sweetness prevent this beer from crushing the drinkability category."
"Drinkability is okay... it's not a BAD beer, just totally uninspiring and utterly forgettable."
"D- yeah good thing I only drank a little no sense wasting another sip in my lifetime on this crap."
"Clear gold with no head, at least after the initial cap of white foam disappeared within about 30 seconds. Light aroma, oranges, honey, wheat crackers, lightly floral. More of same in the flavour - sweet oranges, wheat, honey sweetness. Bitterness was mild and it was a little acrid and spicy in the finish. Light bodied, coarse carbonation. Overall, it's pretty average. Nothing is terribly wrong, it just didn't come together very well."
"D - Goes down easy, but the honey becomes unappealing about half way through the bottle. I really don't think I could drink another one of these."
"It had a 1/2 inch head that dissaptes quickly, no lace left. It had a little carbanation. I taste a little honey and some light citrus flavor. It has a great mouth feel. I think it is a very drinkable beer, nice for the summer. The beer is light but isn't a light beer."
"I just want a summer beer that excites my palate. This, like so many others, falls short. There's nothing bad tasting here, just a light honey flavor. I'd drink this at a BBQ over a macro lager, but otherwise I'd steer clear."
"drinkability: drinkability is good, over 5% abv which is nice. a good beer to have on a hot summer day. didn't get sick of this beer"
"Drinkability - Honestly, quite so. This is very refreshing and a change of pace from all the high alcohol and massively flavorful beers I am used to. It is nice every now and then to have something that is just plain and simple. Not the best, not the worst, but definitely drinkable."
"Poured into 10oz glass. Poured a clean, clear urine yellow with a thin white head that had no retention or lacing. The smell was OK, a very slight grainy wheat aroma, no other notable features. The flavor was a slightly funky wheat taste, again nothing else stands out. The body was thin and watery. Drinkability wasn't terrible, but also wasn't very good. Overall, an unspectacular beer, which is pretty much what I was expecting."
"Honey Moon is similar to other summer season beers I've had. The beer is shade of yellow that is a bit cloudy. The taste and smell is fairly sweet. There is definetly some citrus flavor in this beer. I would say this beer is comparable to Sam Adams Summer Ale, but I found Honey Moon to be a bit sweeter. Honey Moon is a very easy beer to drink. I recommend this to anyone who likes summer beers."
"Drinkability: Meh... Regular Blue Moon is better than this. While it's a good summer seasonal, I can't see myself going out and buying this."
"Close to two fingers of pure white microfoam, rapid dissolve down to the surface with only trace lacing left behind. Basic yellow-orange color, quite clear with minimal scattered bubbles visible within. The nose is based mainly on grains, wheat, rye, with rice and corn too, the honey makes itself quietly present, same for the orange citrus, neither would seem a focal point where they not mentioned on the label, light brush of apricot fruit too. Medium-bodied, fairly smooth even as the carbonation's activity increases mouth presence. The honey here tempers any herbaceous or grassy elements. The citrus remains lowkey, more ""blossom"" than pulp or juice. Nothing notable about the malts, again, the graininess adds punctuation without much personality. Innocuous, easy to see why a casual drinker might order a bottle."
"D - Well this was unexpected, in an off style sorta way. It's not bad and certainly drinkable, I could easily polish off a sixer. I just didn't like how the beer has been filtered of it's yeasty goodness, and it looks like a cheap adjunct lager that's been left out over night! I think I'd rather stick with a pack of Schlitz over this, it least it would be a better deal."
"Drinkable and mildly refreshing. There are many better options for pale wheat ales out there, i wouldn't buy this again."
"I poured into a pint glass to a half inch of head head that didn't hang around long. It is yellow in color. It smells very sweet. I'm imagining that it is the honey. The taste is not refreshing. There really isn't much taste. I get just a slight wheat taste and that's about it. I'm not a fan of Blue Moon in any case. With a gun to my head I would choose Rising Moon. They just make some crappy beer."
"Pours a light yellow color with little head and no lacing present after drinking some. The aroma is very faint but there are hints of a sweet malt backbone along with some honey. The taste has a sweet malt backbone with a nice honey flavor over the top. The taste is of honey is dominate, it is a surprisingly very nice taste. The mouthfeel is moderate carbonation. Overall i was pleasantly surprised with this one. The honey flavor was nice and appealing however, very non complex. I could see the honey flavor getting maybe old or boring after a couple."
"All told, this is a pretty pleasant beer. For me, its nice to pick up a box-o-24 because it is a beer that I can share with the wife, its' sweet characteristics and easy drinking appealing to her. It is a great compromise beer- in that it isn't a complex tripel or BW, but it is a pretty solid beer that appeals to me and the wiv."
"I love the classic Blue Moon, so I was expecting this to be better. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. It was just average. I found that the orange peel and the honey didn't mix well together, canceling each other out and leaving the tastes too subtle. Honey goes better with a darker brew, like a brown ale, which adds a touch of sweetness to ease the bitterness. Blue moon is already a sweet, light, flavorful beer, and adding honey to it just doesn't make sense. I'll stick to the original from now on. But hey, I'm glad I tried it, and now I know."
"D: Say what you will about Coors or Blue Moon, but this one actually isn't too terrible. I don't know if I'd really buy this, but there are certainly worse beers."
"This beer does go down easy and is great for any BBQ. I couldn't really handle more than three of these in a row. It's very lightly carbonated which added to the ease of drinking it. I think a little less honey and a little more wheat could go a long way with this one. Not bad, but certainly not great. Stick to regular Blue Moon."
"D - Thought this was an easy drinker at first, but became so sweet I started having trouble with the 12 oz bottle."
"Light mouthfeel, moderate carbonation leaves for a refreshing, effervescent feel on the palate. This, combined with the honey notes at the end, saves this beer from being a disappointment. Wish I had it as part of a mixed six so I could try something new instead of having another, but I wouldn't mind drinking another."
"D- Goes down smooth i would have another esp. on a hot summer day!"
"Served from bottle into imperial pint. Poured a pale yellow with one-finger white head that quickly subsides. There was no lacing apparent throughout. The aroma was comprised of a musty note with some citrus. The flavor was very bland with hints of citrus and wheat. It was light on the palate with low carbonation. Overall I am not a fan of this brew. They would most likely need to start from scratch in order to salvage this beer. However, it is quite refreshing if that counts for anything."
"M/D: light very light bodied and good drinkability."
"D- not an enjoyable brew for me. too sweet and sugary to be thirst quenching and would probably make me feel like shit if i chugged one on a hot day. similarities to coors light in every category lead me to this conclusion-- master brewers in golden colorado, high in the rocky mountains where trains fly and chicks ski in bikinis, found themselves with an overabundance of clover honey due global warming and the invasion of africanized honeybees. rocky mountain scientists discovered that killer bees can only be killed by... you guessed it, a silver bullet. not wanting the sugary gold to be wasted, it was loaded onto a flying train and transported back to the brewery. the formula is as follows: 9 parts coors light, 2 parts blue moon belgian white ale, 1part clover honey. stir vigorously. and the code has been broken."
"Tasted a lot like Blue Moon's regular brew. It had a lot more citrus but I guess they left the honey out of my six pack because I was hoping for a touch more sweetness in this brew. I drank the six pack in a week but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it again and I wouldn't pay premium dollars for it either."
"Honey Moon poured a copper color, with a good sized head. The smell had some citrus and orange, but wasnt strong enough. It tasted similar to regular blue moon, but stronger, and with a lemon and honey twist to it. It was light, refreshing, and very easy to drink. Overall might be the best blue moon, not the best seasonal summer beer, but deffently a good one."
"D: This is my final season ale of the Blue Moon family, and while none of them ever really topped Blue Moon in overall flavor, this one is fairly close and great for a refreshing alternative. I will have again."
"On further review - the honey in this brew is overpowering, and not good."
"D- this isnt offensive by any stretch, but its also unimaginative and bland. i dont think ill be buying this."
"a side note my wife luved this one she is not a beer drinker"
"drinkability is ok but the syrupy feel from too much honey kept me from rating it higher"
"Shines a bright sunny yellow color. Slightly hazy, despite its brightness. There is a thin film of lace to be seen. It looks very light. Has the slight smell of lemon, and a touch of honey. Has a wheat smell as well. It smells like a cross between a Belgian white and a hefeweizen. Not very strong, but pleasant enough. Has the strong taste of dry wheat with a top layer of sweet honey. Witbier taste with a li'l somethin' extra. Think Blue Moon but sweeter. Thicker than then regular Blue Moon; more syrupy. But also has a saving grace of some dryness to offset that thickness. It's a nice enough summery drink."
"Pours very clear, golden yellow. Head doesn't last for long. Smell is very clean and wheaty. Taste starts off citrusy with some bitterness, blending into mineralness, and then finishing with honey. Carbonated well enough. I'm not a fan of honey in beer, but it's understated enough here as not to detract too much from the mouthfeel and finish. Yet after a while, the stickiness happens. Decent brew, I could sip one each time it's in season."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sweet, chewy, and soft in the finish."
"A little too watery, needs more substance to it."
"D: Fairly drinkable, especially if it's warm, you're drinking from the bottle, you're drinking with lots of people, and/or you're used to lower-end beer. This Blue Moon is closer to what I anticipate from Coors than its cousins, most of which I enjoy. I wouldn't recommend Honey Moon, but I certainly wouldn't advise against it either."
"D: Refreshing on a hot day, but doesn't compete otherwise. Sort of like Corona: Hits the spot when you're parched, but not the beer you'd bring if you were really left on a desert island."
"Decent."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very mild, some hints of honey. Taste is sweet, honey with some spices, fairly good. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall a decent brew, but nothing great."
"D : For a witbier, it is just about decent. Better stuff definitely available easily. But since I am a big Witbier fan, I like it."
"For what it is - this beer is very solid. Like megalith brewers or not, they can turn out solid beers from time to time. It comes down to if you like this style."
"Poured a modestly cloudy yellow, with very little head and no lace. The smell was wheaty, with very little else except for the faintest hint on honey and lemon. The flavor did have more honey and lemon, but that isn't saying much. The mouthfeel was modestly carbonated and fairly thin. Definitely a sessionable beer, but needs much more flavor."
"Drinkability: Not bad. It's not the best Wheat Ale in the world, though. It's average."
"Not worth seeking out, but a slightly better option than regular BMC beer."
"I'm surprised they charge that much for this stuff. Thumbs down. Never again."
"D: OK, but not great. Could stand to be a lot smoother in the middle. The beginning and end were decent."
"This is a good light-bodied beer with plenty of kick for a summer ale (5.6% ABV); if you can get past the color, you can drink this all night long."
"D - Well, Honeymoon thankfully isn't the worst of Blue Moon's seasonals. It's actually fairly decent for what it is. A nice sweetish beer that holds up well on a hot day with just enough flavor to keep it from completely slipping down into the depths of APWA hell."
"Other comments: Just as insipid as Blue Moon. No surprise here."
"D- The first one went down easy enough, but I hesitate to have a second for fear that the sweetness would become too cloying..."
"D- Another? No thanks. I'll take an Oberon or Little Sumpin Sumpin the next time I'm in the mood for an American Pale Wheat."
"I really thought I kinda liked this beer. I'll try it again, and I should vow to edit this if I've somehow ruined this beer...with refrigerator light--is that possible? Where the sweetness aided the taste, it hurts the drinkability. Sugar water might have its place (ridding hiccups, perhaps), but I'll try someone else's before I consider buying this one again."
"Honey is very prevalent in the flavor and adds sweetness to the beer. I dont really taste the orange peel at all. Wheat flavor and crispness are pushed to the side a bit and seem to clash with the floral honey flavors. The beer is fairly light of body, despite the residual sweetness. This brew is ok, but I dont find it to be particularly refreshing and only mildly enjoyable."
"Poured a slight dark gold w/ one-finger offwhite head and that's probably the best attribute of the beer. A very mild smell of wheat and clove with hints of honey. Taste is more of the same as this beer goes down real easy as it is watery; the honey is noticeable for a little bit of sweetness but this beer had a slightly rough edge to it - the honey and wheat do not necessarily make a smooth ride. One of those beers worth trying, if like me, your only other options are macro's and this is temporarily on tap."
"Seems to be a good starter beer to get people away from the macros, though this is a MillerCoors product. My ""lager"" drinking friends (lager being any beer that isn't light) seem to enjoy it."
"Drinkability: It's low ABV and I had three in a row just dusting them off. I'd drink it again if I was in need of a sessioner, but with only a lack of other options. Summerfest from SN was much, much more satisfying and tends to be equally available, I'd stick with that."
"Honey Moon? Wow has to be good, right? Smells like a KÃ¶lsch in the bottle with a wheaty background and some spices. Pours to a clear macro (but slightly orange) yellow, with a head that is there but don't blink or you missed it. Taste is malty with a trace of orange spice and a hint of bitterness, followed by a syrupy honey center and a tarty slight bitter finish. The honey is definitely there. Good carbonation smooth but doesn't bite. Kind of too sweet to drink very much of. Needs to finish dry with all that sweetness. This would be a dessert beer with vanilla ice cream more than a sessioner. Apropriately named."
"D: A bit cloying, bland and wimpy for my tastes. Aside from the prominence of honey, no other flavors really asserted themselves. Can't say I would recommend this Coors Brewing Company product."
"Overall it was a fairly solid beer, especially from a mass produced beer. I won't seek out another, but if that's all that was available, I wouldn't be upset. It's easy to drink, and not over-the-top sweet like some other summer ales."
"Taste: the lemony/orange citric zip refreshes; can this be an ale with zero hop presence? wheat is light, which means the flavor is too--intentional, yes; though the evening is not muggy or hot, it still works as Coors intended, yet this one should best the OG Blue Moon in taste, and I am not sure it does--plus, I'd rather have the real lemon or orange in the glass, not in the bottle... Overall: This finishes with an almost dish detergent lemon drizzle, and isn't really slammable because it actually is slammable enough..."
"Gold in color with light and foamy head. Honey and grain on the nose. Small amount of prickle bubbles are present. The attack is pretty smooth with a little graininess that is well concealed by the malt. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth and it seems to me that this might be due to the honey influence as the mouthfeel is much more syrupy than the typical blue moon. There is a strong grain flavor late, but still remains pleasant. The finish is clean. There is some honey in the aftertaste and a grippiness like that experienced with some wines."
"I like Blue Moon Belgian White, but this is nothing close. Virtually no hoppiness. It smells very sweet, with very little malt. The taste is wriiten right on the bottle ""Honey"" That describes this beer; liquid honey. If you prefer that sort of thing this beer is for you, but if you like a kick in the ass, this is not it."
"Overall, this beer is OK. Nothing to get excited about. I will avoid it if possible."
"Pours clear, with a very pale, near white color; nice head and decent lacing. Fairly neutral scent, not much to it but a slight sweetness. Nice taste, decent amounts of sweet wheat malt and a small hint of orange peel; huge honey flavor, the name was a good choice, it had mead-like qualities with the amount of honey in the flavor. Went down very smooth, it's easy to drink. Another nice macro-micro from Coors' Blue Moon line."
"Like a bad lager mixed with some honey syrup. My first impression of Honey Moon was that it doesn't really taste like beer. It's more like a really bad light cider mixed with artificial honey. The honey flavor really isn't all bad, but the grainy off-flavored malt and non-existent hops kill it for me. I'd like to give it a lower score, at least compared to real beers and the style, but it's definitely not at quite the depths of something like cheap malt liquor. The aroma is disappointingly weak. The appearance is poor at best. The beer is an odd color, a light sickly yellow, with an awful fizzy head that immediately dissipates to nothing. I generally don't care about appearance, but some of these big mass-produced beers look very odd, especially the sweet ones. The feel is way more cloying than it should be, particularly for a beer made with honey. Drinkability is low, but I can get through a glass when it's cold. A pretty bad beer."
"overall a nice refreshing brew, but not what i would like to see in a APWA"
"D- I liked this better than Blue Moon. The honey addition is perfect for summer although minimal but it works because to much would have made this overly sweet and not a good candidate for a summer quaff. 5.2% is low and any more would be uncivilized. I did not want any more after my 12oz though."
"Drinkability - a good beer for a warm weather session thing."
"The carbonation is too weak and the mouthfeel comes across almost syrupy because of how inappropriately sweet it is."
"Pours a clear yellow with a thin white head. Smells very sweet, with honey and malt and a little bit of hop. A malty flavor up front with a sweet honey kick in the middle and slight fruity bitterness in the finish. Not bad, not good, but average taste. Decent mouthfeel, nice and crisp and a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is alright, it is a good summer beer but the sweetness might get to me after a couple."
"Drinkability: pretty good a nice low cost and fairly simple session beer."
"Pours a hazy yellow-orange color with a thin bubbly white head with minimal lacing. Smells of wheat, some malt and hints of spiciness and orange. The taste is very light with first notes of the wheat and spice and the citrus cutting through towards the end. Tastes like a sweeter and spicier version of its brother product, Blue Moon. The mouthfeel of Honey Moon is very light-bodied with a good amount of carbonation throughout. I'd say that this is very fairly drinkable."
"This one pours a hazy, opaque orange-gold with a thin white head. Aroma is wheaty and slightly malty with a hint of orange. Flavor is wheaty with a strong orange overtone that is slightly but pleasantly sour. Smooth, fizzy texture leaves nice wheaty and citrus finish."
"I actually am sort of shocked that there is some honey essence to this beer, rather than just some macro placebo with a sleight of hand using dashes of chemical-flavors. Its a bit sweet with a light body, though not thin or watery. It has some witbeer character, actually. A bit of orange peel and clove. Would I ever buy it or choose it over your average true craft beer? hell no. But, I guess when you compare it to its other garnishable, typical American bbq choices, its not so bad."
"This beer pours a clear golden color. The head is an inch and a half in height, and recedes into sparse lacing. The aroma is of honey and tangy wheat. It has no real complexity, but it is quite strong. The taste has a larger honey character, and only a hint of wheat. Again it lacks complexity. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with a high level of carbonation that somewhat gets in the way of the taste. Overall, this is a decent beer, but not something I would drink again."
"When poured the color was medium yellow with an orange hue. Little amount of foam and retention was non existant. The smell of citrus was evident, along with a hint of wheat malts. The taste had a bitter citrus feel on the palate that was expecialy pleasing taste. This is just an average summer ale if at that!"
"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle a golden color with a large fluffy white head which settles some but is retained as a half finger head. Very active carbonation, this is on the verge of ""fizzy"" Aroma is of citrus & spice. 1st sip is sweet, the honey jumps out right away with the citrus (orange) riding its coattails. The after taste is of slightly bitter orange peel with a hint of peppery spice. Mouthfeel is smooth, crisp, & refreshing, and I could easily see sessioning quite a few of these on a hot summer day. This is a nice, refreshing summer ale, one that would make a great complement to food fresh off the grill at a backyard cookout. Nice stuff!!!"
"Pours a honey yellow that is a tad hazy and a nice thick film sticks to the glass. Smells sweet, floral, wheaty and crisp. Taste is sweet and malty, not much hoppiness but the honey and orange peel are noticeable. Mouthfeel is alright and drinkability is high. A very soothing drinker, I wouldn't mind nursing a few bottles of these during the course of a night."
"D: just okay for me, probably won't go out of my way for another one."
"It wasn't bad it just wasn't different enough for me to go out of my way to buy it over somethign else."
"d: This was a wedding gift six-pack from a great lady, of my favorite friends of my new bride. This was okay, I'll have no trouble getting through all six. It does make me want to try a good wheat beer with honey though. Can anyone recommend one?"
"I drank my first bottle out of a glass but quickly switched to bottles because I hate the straight up grain smell reminiscent of the rolling rock extra pale borefest. I tasted wheat and the typical blue moon orange flavor with a honey aftertaste. This beer is crisp, very drinkable, and refreshing, especially on a hot summer day."
"M-D- Smooth mouthfeel almost like very lightly cabonated water on the tongue. I could consume alot if they were around."
"d- blue moon is still one of my favorite beers"
"From the Blue Moon products I've tried, this is the worst. If offered, I'd probably ask what else was available before settling on this. I'd definitely drink the original Blue Moon over it."
"D - not an impressive offering. I won't have this again if I can help it."
"i know this is bmc, and i know it's a cheesy concept-wheat beer with honey, but this was good. crystal clear golden color, decent white head and lacing. aroma is doughy malts, honey, and sweet orange peel. sweet honeyed, biscuity malts dominate with a slightly sour, almost drying finish. crisp. tangy. light in body, nicely carbonated, with the honey lingering in a good way. semi-sweet finish, but not too cloying. this would be sessionable in the summer."
"Hazy amber with modest head. Fair amount of lacing. Taste is bready, clean, somewhat crisp like a good apple. Slight orange flavor. Would be a good beer for those who don't appreciate beer much. Very enjoyable for what it is. The balance of flavors and carbonation are very well done. A bit too slick and sweet for frequent consumption."
"Great beer, overall the blue moon series of beers are pretty impressive. I do enjoy them they are a pretty decent go to beer as far as Archaine Oklahoma beer laws in the grocery stores go. Will I buy this one again? why yes I will it is a pretty good 3/2 beer not bad at all it is almost like a somewhat decent desert at a chain resteraunt."
"Notes: I have determined I love Blue Moon especially from the tap, the bottle taste does not do it many favors, concealing some of it's character. However with the Honey Brew I could stand it in the bottle more so than the original."
"Final Thoughts: Decent attempt but the sweetness overshadows any attempt at complexity."
"It's real easy to drink, It's got a mouthfeel that is off the mark only by must a little bit. This is a good summer beer but not a great summer beer. Good in small sips as apposed to just guzzling this beer. Just sip and enjoy."
"Anyway, I poured the beer into a pint glass with a finger thick head and could immediately smell the honey and lemon peel. After the first sip, I was immediately impressed with how light it tasted, being that it had a dark brown complexion. This beer is perfect for a summer outting and may I suggest you still incorporate an orange and maybe a lemon to let it taste even better (even though it doesn't need any help)."
"It's not bad, but really doesn't beg to be drank again."
"MF&D - Light and crisp. Easy drinking enough, just not something I would go out of my way for."
"D: It's not undrinkable. But if it were to be wiped off the face of the earth, I wouldn't be too upset."
"This beer can probably be drunk by people who don't really like beer, and by beer bores alike. The beer bore will wish he was drinking something better, though, which is ultimatley how this beer will make you feel. However, to it's credit, it has a refreshing feel that could probably just ""hit the spot"" on that summer afternoon after you were working. Although you'd probabley want to ""hit the spot"" with a better quality brew than this."
"Drinkable? I'd say so, I honestly think it could be better with a slice of orange, having lacked said fruit I opted for a jarred mandarin orange after the review. Really didn't do much for the flavor, just made the whole beer a bit more syrupy. The citrus of a real orange would really change this beer, could be a winner for hot summer days."
"definitely not the best example of this style. but, probably delicious for someone who wants a crisp summer beer."
"D - An alright summer beer that doesn't offend but doesn't offer much of anything significant either."
"D- This was actually a lot better than I originally remember. Decently refreshing brew. Kindof grainy and macro feeling."
"Drinkabilty- Unenjoyable to me not one I will be lookin for again just to much of that fake citrus flavor to me and to much sweet honey, couldnt imagine having more then one of these with the odd after flavor it has on the finish"
"Definitely worth a try."
"D-Not a hit with me. A nice looking and feeling beer, but it really lacks in the more important flavor and aroma departments."
"Suds tasted very creamy and orange flavored. Tasted crisp w/ an orange/honey aftertaste that never becomes too sweet. Definitely just made it into my list of favorite beers."
"Not my pint of ale, but it's good for what it is. A very good choice to ween people of BMC."
"My wife likes these beers, so I thought I'd give this one a try. It turned out to be a bit lacking. It was a mostly clear, but maybe a little hazy, golden color. Small white head. It had a sweet aroma, which on tasting I thought must be honey. It was overly sweet, and not a beer I'd want to drink a lot of."
"Pours a semi cloudy clearish pale yellow color body, with a big white foamy head, diminishing. Very wheaty, malty aroma, some sweetness, a lot of honey. Very effervescent. Light tasting, flowery and some honey. Light sweet soft mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Some orange flavor too, maybe orange zest."
"Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with this beer. I thought it would have the traditionally aggressive flavors that I feel most Blue Moon products have, but it was very drinkable. The honey taste is well balanced with traditional Hefe Weizen flavors."
"Drinkability: Overall, for a summer offering I enjoyed it, if this was presented to me at another time, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much, it's a likeable brew and has good qualities, but alot of the flaws in the original Blue Moon carry over into here, especially in the nose and the mouthfeel. Otherwise, a very decent beer to have on a hot day, just don't expect to be ""Wow'ed"""
"A fairly drinkable brew from our friends in Colorado. It won't give Gumballhead a run for it's money, but I wouldn't turn it away either."
"This is fairly drinkable, but I do not like the sweetness."
"Ill buy again."
"Highly drinkable example of a honey ale. A very nice honey flavor kicks in at the middle to delight the taste buds. I looked forward to it every sip. The head was disappointing for a beer using wheat malts and the aroma was pleasant but could have been more interesting or robust. Overall this beer is a winner and I would buy it again. However, I would buy it only if others were going to drink it, for I only need one of these before the honey novelty wears off."
"The honey taste is certainly a nice touch. It in no way overpowers or is cloying. The beer seems to lack substance, but maybe my mind will change on a hot summer day."
"I poured this into a standard pilz glass and observed a serious amount of trub in my glass. That threw the appearance off a bit but nevertheless it pours golden yellow with a thin wisp of head on top. Nose is slightly sweet and reminiscent of rice or other adjuncts. Taste is fair, slightly sweet with notes of honey. Body is light and carbonation is medium with just a bit of a zing in the finish. Overall this is OK, but just not my style. Perhaps its yours."
"D 3.0 not bad, just not great, a mediocre rep for the style so it's not my first pick for drink-ability..."
"Overall it was an okay beer, there could be more flavor than what was there. Was left wanting more."
"An interesting beer. Starts out like a typical blue moon with the citrus and wheat flavor, but soon proceeds to a sweet honey taste that lingers on the tongue. Very smooth, very drinkable and pretty tasty. Love the aftertaste, great summer beer, but a little watered down and dull."
"Aroma is not overly flattering but not terrible. Some citrus and honey notes, but they don't meld too well. Color is pale lemonade yellow. The start is all malty and fruity. Some citrus zestiness and honey come through in the finish. Fairly refreshing and light bodied.Nice on a hot summer day but overpriced for what it is."
"This is a really refreshing quaff. Kinda' dull in taste and smell. It is simply put, easy drinkin'."
"Pours like a summer ale should, but I expected a bit more on the nose. Flavor of a typical summer ale, malty with a strong honey punch that lives up to the name. Spicy, citrusy. However, this beer is crippled by a biting, stinging carbonation. Way too much carbonation in this beer kills mouthfeel and puts the flavor in the backseat."
"O-It's light enough you could have a couple but nothing that keeps my interest long enough to have a lot. Decent but not great."
"Its weird though how it tastes like you put honey straight into your beer, even makes your lips sticky."
"Overall: eh, okay"
"D: This is a shame because I really do enjoy Blue Moon when I am in a bind or just want a cheap session. This beer could be a hell of a lot better and needs some tweaking. Still a worthy effort and it is drinkable, but just not the most enjoyable of beers. 5 more to go."
"Figured for that price I couldn't pass up trying it. Tastes like the standard run of the mill summer beer, meaning it's a wheat with citrus flavors and little or no body. Is a nice thirst quencher on a hot day but outside of that situation I don't think it will do me any good."
"Drinkability- A solid drinkable beer, nothing fancy, perhaps a little sweet."
"This beer poured a honey-color with a fluffy two-finger head that lingered for a while. This beer is sweet smelling, with some honey and spices. The taste is surprisingly less sweet than the smell, although it starts off with honey that gives way to some citrus with some floral accents. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with very fine carbonation. This is a fairly drinkable beer that's pretty middle of the road as far as quality goes. Not a bad beer to grab on a warm summer day, but I doubt I'd grab more than one."
"Perfect for a hot day; I had this after just finishing a little yard work; it was a great antidote for this horridly swealtering Georgia heat."
"I drank this beer right from the bottle so I did not get the best view of it's appearance. The smell of this reminded me of fresh muffins for some reason. Taste of citrus and the honey of course. Different than the other wheat ales I've had, but still good. Crisp and clean. Very refreshing brew that I would quaff on most any day!"
"hints of orange with tons of SUCK, this is by far the worst summer beer i have ever had, this has hints of corn and leaves an after taste that leaves somthing to be disered. i wouldent wish this peace of crap on even my worst enimeys. SUCK, SUCK, SUCK AND DID I MENTION SUCK!!!"
"Theoretically a honeyed version of their famous Blue Moon Belgian White. Poured out of the bottle a cloudy, sandy blonde color with a large two finger head of white foam that faded in a few minutes time to a scant ring. Weak lacing. Sweet, artificial nose, like sweet and low with orange extract. Not good. Flavors are equally perplexing and notably off. Fake flavoring, very little wheat, puckering finish. Something in it reminds me of Tang orange drink. About what I would expect from the Coors brewery but clearly worse than the original Blue moon. If it ain't broke...."
"This is overall, a good summer brew."
"D- Decent enough for a summer beer on a hot day. Sometimes when honey is added to the beer it's not always noticeable or lends an odd character to the sweetness. Here that's not an issue."
"I'm sure this was meant to be consumed out of the bottle: no sediment (who wants a chunk of yeast in their mouth), light malt flavors with a strong taste of honey, and a twist-off cap. This beer actually isn't too bad, and very drinkable. Makes a great summer beer."
"Picked a sixer up and went strait to the plastic cup. I thought the beer looked good. There certainly wasn't anything bad about it, but like most reviews have stated: nothing really impressive either. Even my rookie palette could detect the honey. It was crisp and refreshing so I wouldn't be opposed to drinking more of them on a hot summer day (or night) if they're available. I can't say it'll be a go-to beer by any means."
"Overall, this is an alright beer. I could have a few of these, but nothing to special."
"Soft mouthfeel, pretty refreshing. The sweetness is not overberaing."
"Despite my gripes, which I have more of than praise, this did do the trick in terms of a quick summer quencher. But wouldn't you rather quench with an Oberon, or even a Stone pale ale instead? If this was sitting at the company picnic or family reunion along with Bud Light and Miller Chill, you would consider it manna from heaven. But there's not much more to truly recommend it...nice try, but I'll stick with Oberon."
"Tried this at a local ""hole""...not watering hole...just a HOLE! Anyway, it had a nice smell, obviously a tad sweet in smell AND flavor due to the ""Honey""...and much like the Belgian White version, very refreshing. Personally, a tad too sweet to down a bunch of these, so after just 1, I went back to the original on tap, as it was more refreshing and 50 cents cheaper than the Honey Moon! Not bad at all, though, and a nice one to try during these hot, lazy-hazy days of summer. Why not have a lazy-hazy wheat beer?! Worth a try in my opinion...but remember there's honey in there! (For some reason this Honey Moon was better than MINE!!! HA! Joke for all you married fellas...like me.) Cheers and SAAALUTE my BA friends!"
"Overall- Very hum-drum. Flavors are weak and bland. Avoid."
"Either way, this is one of my favorites from Blue Moon. Hate Blue Moon, but I love their seasonals."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured a large foamy head on a slightly cloudy, very light yellow body. Smell was weak of orange and honey, very faint. They came through much better in the taste, however. Reminded me of Leinie's Honey Weiss, only with more ""wheatness"". Very smooth, very easy to drink. A nice summer brew."
"D - I;m sure many like this as a summer brew due to the light feel. The sweetness is just a bit over the top in my opinion."
"D: By the second beer, it was harder to deal with the sweet honey taste, but you know, I'm not for sweets anyway."
"Overall, Boo..."
"Drinkability> not bad. Not as good as Anchor's summer, but a hell of a lot better than drinking a bouquet of flowers (ahem.. a bottle of regular Blue Moon)"
"D: A surprisingly good wheat beer from Coors, the Blue Moon beers that I have had from them have been rather good. I'd take this over the Sam Adams summer, really like the honey flavour in the end."
"Drinkability is ok."
"Drinkability was low, the honey and spices were just too much for me, I didn't like it from the first sip, and only grew more sick of it as I powered through."
"Drinkability - THE last time I will ever have this one, and I have five more to go! Anyone want to buy 'em off me?"
"D: I'll never drink this again."
"D-Easy to drink as a summer ale should be."
"I've enjoyed all of Blue Moon's seasonals besides their Spring (too much lime) and this is another success. It's like their Full Moon, just honey rather than brown sugar taste and noticiably warmer."
"Picked up a six at a local grocery store while vacationing in Myrtle Beach, SC. 12 oz brown bottle with a pull date of 09/08/08 printed on the neck. The beer pours a dark yellow with a fluffy white head. Smell is malty with a hint of orange. Taste is of wheat malt with just a little orange and just a kiss of sweet honey in the background. Not a bad beer for those hot summer days in the Carolinas but there are better summer beers out there."
"Overall not a bad, very light bodied water substitute, however I think I will pass on it again,. It was not terrible or bad, just way too light and boring for my tastes."
"D - Overall, a very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: The standard-issue Blue Moon is acceptable. This, however, is kind of icky."
"Notes: It's not overly complex but it gives you a refreshing simple quick hit of flavor on a hot summer day."
"D- Very drinkable on a hot day, can easily put 2 or 3 of these away. It is nice and refreshing."
"Overall, not bad, but not excellent, great for hot summer days."
"If it weren't for the overtly sweet tones of the honey at times, this would make for a pretty damn good wheat ale. However, if I wanted a drinkable light brew from these guys, I'd go with the standard Blue Moon."
"Cheap too, if you're on a budget."
" I'm not sure what the ABV% of this is, but it can't be over 5%. Much like the aftertaste that I'm searching for as I swish this around my mouth, I don't think there's any alcohol present. Yes, it's there, but that's about the only thing that can be found as my mind and the taste of this have moved onto greener pastures. Only worth a try if the hop shortage has made your favorite brew unaffordable and ya need a beer fix..."
"D: Personally, this was okay, but too sweet for me to enjoy regularly. I guess some could consider this a nice, sessionable seasonal ale, but not my cup of tea. I was a little disappointed after trying Coor's attempt at a Belgian Wheat-style in Blue Moon."
"there are some orange flavors in there too with the honey. they both are toning down the wheat flavors too. there is a subtle honey after taste to it. very light, drinkable, but keep it cold."
"This is a summer session beer."
"D - I think that this is a pretty good summer seasonal brew its light and has a refreshing taste its not the best one out there but still a good one"
"M/D: Overall, the beer had good carbonation, not too much, but enough. I thought that the beer was light and refreshing. Extremely drinkable and one that I might reach for again."
"D- Nothing to go nuts about. A bit too sweet and subdued in overall flavor to be enjoyable for more than a pint. At least I got a free glass out of it."
"This appears a clear golen color in my pint glass. It has an average light tan head. The nose has grainy wheat malts with a touch of clover honey. The taste has a light wheat flavor with an unbalanced sweet honey presence. A clean crisp body goes down well. A good drinker, but nothing special."
"I had a chance to take a look at the reviews for this beer on here before i had a chance to try it. from what i read i thought this might be a decent beer but this was not the case. to me this is a blue moon with honey sweetness. appearance is cream gold color with a fair amount of carbonation. smell is kind of sweet and the same with the taste. I happened to drink one of these with pizza and the spice of the pizza masked the sweetness and made honey mooon a drinkable beverage. I dont think i would be able drink this with out something with some twang to eat along side it."
"Not a bad summer alefor a Coors product! I drank cold drectly from the bottle, from what I saw it looked orange-yellow. Smelled like honey and orange with some floral notes. Tasted refreshing with honey and some citrus but mot overly sweet. I could see sipping a few of these while laying by the pool on a hot July day."
"I didn't hate it, but I would never order this again."
"Definatly not what I would call a good american pale wheat ale. It tastes like a typical macro brewery version of summer beer."
"Extremely drinkable. The honey sweetness isn't excessive. Nice beer."
"Medium-bodied, highly carbonated, good drinkability you'd expect from a Coors-in-beer's-clothing."
"D: Pretty good drinkability. A nice summer quencher that was citrusy and refreshing. Could easily enjoy this in multiples. Regardless of many peoples perception of the brewery, this makes for a refreshing summer time drink."
"The color of the beer is dark yellow, head with a short white froth. Smell is malty with a hint of orange. Taste is orange and wheat with a sweet hint of honey. Mouthfeel is lite, not overly carbonated. Not as drinkable as some other beers, but not bad either."
"I would definitely bring this to a summer gathering when your trying to show a little class above the Bud Light/Miller Lite crew (but not show off). Over all this wasn't too bad of brew."
"This beer has no discernible flavor to set it above other summer seasonal offerings. I think that's about it, really there is nothing to distinguish this beer, and I'm having a hard time remembering it, even as I sip away on one."
""
"While listed as an ale, it reminds me more of a traditional American lager with honey added. It peoured nice and clear with a thin head. I was dissapointed with my first taste. I expected more ale than honey. I believe the honey overrides the taste. While not bad, it is not great eather."
"Session for some,but not me. Too sweet for my taste. Carbonation was sort of high,but that was not a problem. If you like wheat beers and honey this will be a great beer for you."
"Overall, because of this beer's refreshing nature, smooth texture and sweet finish, I'd recommend it to any beer drinker looking for a nice alternative to other summer beers."
"D: I'll give this a 3 because it goes down fairly easy, but even by the end of the glass the sweetness was getting to me a little bit. This would be a good pick to introduce some non-beer drinkers to non-macro beer. The sweetness wouldn't bother someone who doesn't drink a lot of beer, but the total absence of hops in this brew really hurts its drinkability for me."
"Drinkability is good. A nice mild thirst quencher and candidate for a session beer."
"Overall, a great refreshing beer. Definitely the type of beer to enjoy on a summer day. Very easy to drink, great flavor."
"Why doesn't it taste better? Starts off like a nice creamsicle, peaks as a honey wheat, and ends as phenolic icky. The mouthfeel is wholly unsatisfying. It's got a light-to-mid body, but the finish is terrible. I think they were trying to dry it out to make it ""refreshing"" like the bottle promises, but I think they just gave up on the hops. Any spicy finishing hop would give this the little bite it needs. As it is, I almost poured it out. Almost. How did this clear the focus groups, MillerCoors?"
"Drinkability is nice as well."
"D-Very high. Definately good for the summer months."
"Like a car wreck, look, enjoy it for what it is, and move on."
"**This review was dictated by my girlfriend, who usually hates this syle of beer. Personally, I think that it smelled and tasted like buttered popcorn, but that might just from the Gulden Draak that we just reviewed!**"
"Worth a shot for a Summer beer..."
"D--Ideal for the golf course, barbecue or fishing boat in summer as advertised...but I could enjoy this in any weather. Strap it down for a nice, long session. Approachable, drinkable, enjoyable--but like I said earlier, not a ""light beer"". 5.6 ABV and nice body. Have fun with this one!"
"Drinkability: Certainly nothing to write home about, but decent enough for a forgettable quaffer. Inoffensive is the best compliment I can give it."
"Honey Moon Summer Ale pours yellow with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is sweet, honey I guess. The flavor is also very sweet, you definitely taste the honey. A fair amount of wheat and a touch of citrus are also present. A bit of graininess also comes through. Easy to drink, really just a sweeter substitute for macro lager imho."
"Id buy it again, but maybe wait for the summer to have this summer brew."
"a hot day brew for sure."
"Smell is somewhat malty, light honey. Taste is of honey as well as wheat - a bit bread like, but not too bad. I'm not a huge Blue Moon Fan, but this is probably the best product I've had of theres. Has a nice mouth feel; Slight aftertaste, but overall decent finish. pretty nice summer brew."
"Pours a nice golden yellow with a light white head that laces the glass some all the way down. It has a light aroma of sweet malts, some honey, and a slight hoppy bitter smell. The taste is the same with mostly a sweet wheat taste with a very small amount of honey and a very faint hoppy bitterness at the very end. It has a decent mouthfeel as it is very light and crisp which would be very refreshing during the summer months which makes for a very drinkable beer. Not bad from Coors."
"D:Overall it's a very drinkable beer. The flavor is mild and easy to drink. Yet I still like the original much better. I haven't had any of these Blue Moon seasonal collection beers that I have really liked. Yet they're at least opening the general public up to more beers because I know a lot of people who really like Blue Moon and they'll buy this beer based on brand name."
"The Blue Moon seasonal beers dont seem to rate well on here, and usually I agree...however, I like this one. This beer has a nice sweet taste and is a great drink for a nice summer day, picnic, bbq or for the beach....it goes well with food in my opinion too. Not as good as the classic Blue Moon though."
"D: Smooth and very ""daily"" drinkable. Refreshing sweetness"
"drinkability - Refreshing beer, easy drinking for the summer. Another great one from Blue Moon."
"To much honey sweetness for my taste, and not enough beer taste."
"Wow, I had this the same night as a Sapporo and the two beers actually have a lot in common. Honey Moon was a little, thicker, and sweeter. There was also a hint of wheat in it. But for the most part, it was just a bland, clean beer, like the Sapporo. I mean, the Sapporo at least had a bit of hops. This just hints at having malt and not much else. Pass."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass longneck bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"The pour is a clear yellow with a bright white frothy head that fades with the lacing a thin coating upon the glass. Nose has a decent malt presence, hints of honey; fresh and clean, start has an adequate grain presence, sweet with the top light. Finish has an acceptable acidity, the hops mild and the aftertaste overly sweet and long lasting, an average beer, nothing more, nothing less."
"Could drink a lot of these, especially in the hot summer weather"
"D: I was not terribly impressed. I had a tough time getting it down. As it warmed, it just became too sweet for my taste."
"Smell dominated by honey. Tastes like.. honey. Also hints of graham crackers and orange. This is alright, and initially I kind of liked it. But I'm down to the last of the 6-pack and it's not really my thing. The honey flavor doesn't really do it for me. And other than the honey flavor, there's not much else going on.Something about the consistency is a little more dense than I would like it as well."
"Nice enough appearance, golden with a nice thick white head,livelly carbonation. Nothing much at all to the aroma though, malty,slightly spicy, not offensive. flavour is sweet of course, but honey sweet and surprisingly not artificial,there is a goodly amount of malt backing too, and some slightly over-ripe but still edible oranges. Palte is kinda thick , but finishes crisp inthe end,though i can taste honey in the after taste for a while. Weird beer, not sure if this an American wheat. Its not bad for a summer thirst quencher."
"Pours a pale color with a nice head that retains. Aroma smells of honey and wheat and is relatively inoffensive. Taste is somewhat sweet up front with a lot of honey notes and some wheatiness. Somewhat biscuity with a nice touch of honey at the back of the tongue. Nice wheat undertones, though the honey might be overdone by just a bit. A really nice, inoffensive version of a pale wheat ale. Definitely better than the regular Blue Moon I had."
"Pours pale, decent head that goes away quickly. Smells are sweet, can notice the honey in it. Tastes is malty, definitely honey sweetness but it all seems a bit out of whack to me. Mouthfeel and carbonation are good, it's a easily drinkable beer but something about the honey sweetness takes away the drinkability to me. Overall not very impressed."
"This fits the summer quencher bill, but I should have known better. I'd much rather have a New Belgium product like a Blue Paddle Pilsner or one of their wheat beers or even Boulevard's Wheat than this. Or a real saison from Ommegang!"
"Golden pour with nice white head that hung around a while. Can taste the honey in this one. Not bad, but the flavor is kind of weak. What flavor it has is kind of fruity and tastes of the honey. Aroma is fruity as well. Mouthfeel is decent. Nothing special, but pretty refreshing on a hot day, however."
"12 bottle into a pint glass. Leaves a finger of white head on top that disappears pretty quickly. This one's surprisingly clear for a APWA, I guess a touch foggy, in a straw color. Nose is strong on orange, I guess a touch of sweet caramel, very light wheat flavor as well, not much in the way of spiciness. Taste is a strong mix of orange and honey (as advertised), some light wheatiness in the aftertaste. Carbonation is too high, in my opinion, and the body is a little thin. This one's okay. It's certainly not offensive, but there isn't really any reason to drink this one and not another APWA, or even the standard Blue Moon wit if you're dying for something with the Blue Moon label."
"Average mouthfeel. I don't see how anyone could finish this one. Way to sweet for me."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a fluffy white head. Good retention and a few thin rings of lace on the glass. Some spicy aromas with a bit of honey. You can taste some honey sweetness, along with the grain and wheat. Flavor is balanced with the citrus orange peel and a bit of bitter finish. Similar to their white ale, but enough differences to make it unique. A refreshing summer seasonal."
"D: I would not get another one. The smell and taste were and bad and there is certainly no honey taste in this at all"
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light pale and wheat malt scent along with a sweet honey presence. It's dry, yet refreshing. The taste is decent also. It has a pale wheat flavor that goes down easy, but finishes a little too sweet with a bit too much honey flavoring. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an above average beer, but nothing that great. I'm glad to see more Blue Moon varieties, but they should shelve this one."
"pours a golden color with a large white head that settles to a quarter inch with a small amount of lacing. slight aromas of honey and spice. taste is mostly of honey with the wheat malt, could not pick out the orange or orange rind at all but the mouthfeel is so smooth with a light carbonation thats very drinkable. very smooth on the palate, if the orange had been there it would have been a much better beer but as it is its still very good."
"Overall an uneventful experience."
"A nice, easy beer to drink. Very simple wheat and honey flavors, but very good flavors and control of tannins. Just a little one dimensional. Still, a very good beer in the summer time. This is a good beer to relax with after you mow the lawn. Give it a try. Not bad at all."
"This is a good beer, nothing amazing, but IMO better than plain blue moon. I could see myself sitting down to drink a six pack of these on either a hot summer day...or shit on my honey moon too :)"
"Overall a decent beer. Nothing to get excited about but much better than the average six-pack that you can get in the gas stations around here. Not as good as the original Blue Moon probably but I have no complaints about this one."
"Thanks to Pegasus for the karma point."
"Pours out a crystal clear golden straw color, with two fingers of foam that dissipates a bit, but hangs on decently well. Smells of zesty lemon and honey. The flavor is zippy for a beer, like sugary lemonade with a pretty weak finish. Weird lingering aftertaste. It's not horrible, but you can tell it's not a real quality brew either. It's a tad fizzy and watery in the mouth, more like pop. It goes down OK, but you're not dying for more."
"Pours a three finger white head that fades to a thin layer leaving some lace. Clear pale amber color. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Faint honey nose. Flavor is light and smooth, honey comes through but orange peel doesn't, clean finish. Good summer ale. Label has this brewed by BMBC in Toronto, Ont. $1.50 for a 12oz bottle from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH."
"D: Overall the summer ale has a very good taste and is a good compliment to the white ale of the original brew. I could definitely drink a 6-pack of this in any given setting. It's what a macro should be."
"Considering what we're looking at here...a Macro's Summer Seasonal attempt....this isn't bad at all. There isn't any of that all too familiar, phony and overdone fruitiness. The Honey flavors are subtle but nice on the nose and in the aftertaste. I guess the biggest complaint that anyone can have here is that there really isn't a whole lot to this beer. It is light....even for a summer ale...and nobody at Coor's went out on a limb here....this is playing it safe for sure. In the end...there's nothing offensive and it fits nicely next to the Belgain Wheat 'Blue Moon' as another suprisingly decent Coor's Specialty offering(but not as good). Not bad. A touch below SA Summer Ale but easily above Beach Bum and Leiney's Sunset Wheat. I'll probobly revisit this one....probobly!?!"
"Looked pretty good in the glass and was pleasant to the nose (sweet smelling, good carb) that is about where it ended. Based on the name and brand you immediately start comparing it to other summer ales, weizens, and white ales. Not much of a comparison. Tasted like what I image weak mead tastes like - pretty sweet and a good bit of honey left over - not clean and crisp like a summer ale should be. I could drink the whole 6 but I likely won't buy again - a good weizen or white is better for the summer months. The belgian white that blue moon makes is much better for the summer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Good and easy to drink with ballanced carbonation."
"Drinkability is allright I guess. I could drink a 6 pack of these. Then I wouldn't want any more for quite a while."
"Only beer I hadn't tried at a local steakhouse, though the other choices weren't very exciting anyway, thought I'd give this one a shot. Thought this was very similar to a Sam Adams Summer Ale, which did not impress me at all when I tried it a while back. Lighter in body and color than Blue Moon's wheat beer, this one had a mix of honey and malt complexity, but also had a corn-like taste. Quenching on a summer night, but so many other great Witbier's out there that I'll pass on it next time"
"I found this much like the spring offering from Blue Moon in my fridge after a party. Poors very clean golden in color with out much of a head. I really cant smell much of anything, just a bit of sweetness, maybee from the honey. The taste is actualy ok considering the smell, with the honey more apprent then the orange. Another ok offering, on the same level as the spring beer, not worth buying by any means though"
"Unimpressive all around; thankfully I didn't pay for this. Not very good (although not incredibly surprising) and definitely not recommended."
"Overall, i certainly like this more than the regular blue moon, but there isnt really anything special to it."
"D: The beer itself is pretty easy to sip, but there's hardly anything to excite the tastebuds. Seems like just one more in a long line of mediocre wheat ales designed for the summer months."
"This beer is pretty drinkable. I didn't think that I would like this beer but it's not bad."
"Had on tap at my local bar. Yellow-golden body with ample carbonation and a lasting creamy white head. Smells of light flowers, a hint of honey, with a touch of candied sugar. Taste is mid-bodied with a flowing honey sweetness. A fringe of malts and husks, with a light backing of hay and hop citrus. A solid drinker actually, that went down pretty easy. Give it a try."
"D- Decent, drinkable though the honey character did start getting to me after one bottle. I'll stick to their white ale even if this seasonal comes out again."
"12 ouncer, with ""Oct2807"" imprinted on the bottle. Pours clear, medium golden, off white head showing decent retention, bubbles rising and leaving better then moderate lacing. Sugary, tropical fruit nose. The problems begin here when it is consumed. Slightly metalic and bland brew. Where is the wheat, yeast and flavor? Honey? Orange? Spice? Pass this one by, boycott macros trying to look micro...the regular Blue Moon wit is 5 times better then this lame offering..."
"Eric"
"Recommended..."
"Ho hum...In a pinch I might pick this up if need be, but only expect to semi-enjoy it if it's ice-cold. This one stinks if it's warmed up even a few degrees above 40. The original Blue Moon is better. And yeah, don't expect a Witbier as listed here."
"Blue Moon Honey Moon Summer Ale is a big disappointment. At one time, the original Blue Moon was my highest scoring macro, so I had every right to expect that this beer would be of similar quality. Instead, I find myself recommending a complete overhaul. This honeymoon was over before it even began."
" This beer was not to thin and definitely not something to fill you up ,just a safe compromise.... and a real treat to beat the summer heat."
"Drank on a hot summer day on the boat. It was cold. It was refreshing."
"Thicker than the regular Blue Moon; more syrupy. But also has a saving grace of some dryness to offset that thickness. It's a nice enough summery drink. Pedestrian, but not bad."
"Blue Moon's Honey Moon Summer Ale pours a clear yellow gold body beneath a full head of bright white foam. The head retention is good and it leaves some nice lace at the outset of the glass. The nose is honeyish and sweetly malty, subtly chalky with yeast, delicately fruity, and floral. It's medium bodied and creamy with a dextrinous edge and median, fine-bubbled carbonation. Honey returns in the flavor, but it's also distinctly wheaty and a touch chalky. It's sweetish but not overdone, and finishes drying. There's enough body and flavor to keep it interesting, giving it a decent amount of drinkability."
"OK, this is not a witbier. It is golden and transparent and smells like honey. The taste is very yeasty with the honey not coming through until the aftertaste. There is also a faint aroma of cinnamon and pumpkin which is less apparent in the taste. All in all, this is a refreshing and drinkable summer ale."
"a nice summer quaffer...worth visiting once a summer, especially after today, where the temp reached 90 F here for the first time this spring/summer. the wife, gf, chic in your life would more than likely find this agreeable too. worth a try."
"Drinkable yes, good use of a well balanced honey flavor. Good Summer sunshine brew."
"Drinkable. Nothing spectacular, nothing I would hunt down, but I certainly wouldnÂ’t turn one down if offered."
"Everyone seems to be taking a stab on what beer style this is. I vote for Pale Wheat. A lackluster style with timid wheat additions. Enough to pull it above a blonde but not enough to impart any meaningful character or atributes. A lightly hazed canary hue with an abundance of carbonation. Just enough wheat to keep the brew from being fizzy. The smell and flavor are a blend of pilsner malt, cereal grains, and lemon-grass. Makes for a modestly pleasant, yet unoffensive brew. The lack of direction, makes this beer bland and uneventful. A watery finish and astringent lemon / hop lingering becomes tea-like late. Not bad, but not a Wit."
"Refreshing due to some tight effervescent carbonation and a pleasing little bite. Well balanced, unfortunately that is not much of a compliment because this beer is pretty bare-bones. Good for a hot summer day, but nothing special."
"D- Fairly good beer pretty drinkable."
"ADDENDUM: This has been chewing on me all day and I finally have the taste of this nailed. This tastes exactly like....Cinnamon Roll with Orange Frosting! Serve this at a brunch with one of those and watch the look on peoples faces!"
"D - This is okay, but it tastes nothing like a witbier. I'd rather drink a regular Blue Moon than this one."
"Poured into my Rare Vos glass. Very active carbonation rises quickly through the golden yellow liquid. Very slight haze. Almost a retentive head, but eventually the head falls behind the carbonation and leaves a ring. Not really enjoying the smell of this one: it has that skunked hefeweisen cardboard smell. Other than that, wet wheat and mild hops. Not quite sure what to make of the taste. A sugary-sweet burst of artificial honey flavor at the very beginning falling to a sharp stale wheat beer taste. Metallic aftertaste. I don't mind blue moon, so how did they screw it up so much just by putting fake honey in it? This is the first and will be the last 6'er I buy of this stuff."
"Overall impression: I'm not a big fan of honey beers, but this one isn't too bad. Drinkable, nice mouthfeel, and a bit of spiciness to keep it interesting."
"Not really a whitbier at all, but it's still interesting. A bit hoppier than I would like for a beer of this style. A nice change of pace, but I would hardly consider getting this regularly."
"This is is not for me. Might be interesting to have one if you are into honey beers, but...bottom line - There are too many other summer beers out there. Even for a light summer brew, this one just doesn't have enough to it."
"Overall: Another pleasant surprise from Blue Moon/Coors. Tasty and enjoyable, suitable for warm summer days. Not incredible, but certainly enjoyable. Worth a try."
"Overall, I could take it or leave it....Macro drinkers will like it more than craft beer enthusiasts...personally I think the regular Blue Moon is better made beer but this is OK.."
"Bad offering from Blue Moon. This is not a good summer beer, or a good beer in general."
"Sorry, but unexciting to me."
"not a bad beer for a hot summer day, which is what i had it on so maybe im alil bias, i love blue moon's belgian white but this one tasted nothing like it, so im surprised they considered it a witbier. the honey after taste was really good and made the beer worth the 6pack buy, but i had a very high expectation and it didnt live up to it. not a bad beer but i probably wouldnt go right for it for a summer get together."
"The taste is mild bready grain with honey, mellow not overpowering, with a peppery, spicy note and a slight grassy note at the finish. Mildly sweet, drying out slightly at the end. Light and easily drinkable."
"Poured a straw yellow into a tall glass. Little head retention or maybe just my glass's fault. Who knows. However not impressed altogether with this particular brew. Maybe its the slight sourness that I am not very fond of that makes me think this way. A very drinkable beer for a hot summer day, but then again I think that every beer is very drinkable. I guess I was expecting more out of this one, regardless I am surprised that my local grocery store actually had it."
"This pours a yellow straw color with a minimal head and some lacing. It appears slightly hazy. It smells of slight citrus and a hint of hops and some sourness. It tastes fairly refreshing as a summer beer should. I detect a slight honey flavor, and some bitterness from either hops or orange peel. It is a slightly bitter beer with not much flavoring hops--they let the honey, malt, and orange peel take care of that. Not much body to it as expected, and overall not a bad beer from a big company. I wouldn't mind having some on a golf course."
"D: This is what they should be brewing in place of regular Blue Moon. Totally quaffable, intersting, and the pinnacle of cross-over beers for macro drinkers. May not be a Witbier by the strictist definition, but I like it. Highly recommended."
"This is a drinkable beer I guess, but the dryness isn't what I am after in a summer ale. I'll probably pass on this one in the future. I think there are as good or better summer ales out there, and some, like Henry Weinhard's, at a lower price.."
"D- Its not for everybody. It is certainly very sweet and not your typical ale. This would be very appropriate for the herbed/spiced beer category. I liked it but many will not."
"its decent stuff and I'd buy it again no problem."
"Ehhh. I could take it or leave it."
"Bottle into tulip glass. A: Very light, almost like a macro rice lager but it's saved a bit by the nice golden hue. Head went away very quickly. S: Not much aside from the honey and the wheat. The citrus is pretty much in the background. T: Like the smell a lot of honey and wheat with some citrus, a little thin but pretty pleasant. Not much hop character but a little bitterness on the finish. M: Moderate to low carbonation, pretty smooth. D: A good thirst quencher for the summer but not anything to go crazy over. I probably won't buy it again."
"D: Yes, I could drink this as a regular hot day burp beer, so maybe it scores better than Coors, but as it's style, a weak choice."
"Ordinary Blue Moon is a reasonably tasty wit, better tasting than some actual Belgian examples, but this effort is pretty bland and mostly uninteresting."
"Light yellow translucent body with a couple inches of white head that takes a little while to dissipate and leaves a good amount of lacing. Smells slightly lemmony and peppery with a hint of honey. Tastes sweet like honey, hints of citrus in the background. Light bodied but by no means watery. Very drinkable. Not much wrong with this one, though it's a bit simplistic. An easy-drinking beer for a hot day."
"Not recommended, unless you specifically light honey brews. Much better than a Mike's Hard, and preferred to Leinenkugel's summer shandy, but not up to the standards of Dupont's Biere de Miel."
"D: This is a decent, cheap beer from blue moon. Not great, not horrible. Good flavors and goes down easy."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date of Sept 07 into a pint glass. It had a slightly pale yellow color. I gave a hard pour and got a pretty big head that stuck around for a bit. Good carb with slight lacing. The aroma was punch in the face honey with a slight hint of orange peel in the back. The taste was also dominated by honey. I think I would have liked this is it had been a beer with some honey highlights since I love honey but this is basically a glass of honey with a little beer thrown in to make it flow out of the glass better. By the end the honey is just too much to take and I had to choke down the last third just to avoid a drain pour. Avoid this one. (1.5, NA, ML, N)"
"Wait, isn't witbier supposed to be, you know, ""wit""? And maybe opaque? This isn't--it's a translucent sickly yellow color with no real head to speak of. Bubbles nicely for a while. Smells vaguely of honey, but I'm not sure I would have picked up on it without being told. Tastes a little more like honey and average pale lager type beer. Has a pretty nice, refreshing mouthfeel--somewhere between spring and summer if you know what I mean. Despite having very little to recommend it, I could actually drink a few of these on a hot day. That's about all it's good for, though."
"Appearance is a light orange with a quick fizzy head. smell is clean with light honey and orange. Taste of the honey is prevalent giving it a sweetness with a bit of orange and having a good balance with hops and carbonation. Mouthfeel is light to medium but thick. Overall it's better than what was to be expected, it would make for a good session but the sweetness would prevent me to continue beyond 2-3 beers."
"D- This beer is tasty, but very sweet. A great adaptation on a wheat beer. I recommend trying this beer if given the chance."
"D - This is pretty drinkable for those who like sweet flavors. For me this sweetness could be very annoying after one or two. This is worth trying, and I think some people might really like this, but it's not for me."
