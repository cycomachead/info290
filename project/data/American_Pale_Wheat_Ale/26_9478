Didn't realize it was a wheat variant at first, although subconsciously I knew it from the name. A little thinner than I would expect from either a pale ale or a wheat ale. Still, a good, drinkable beer. Wish I could say more, but wasn't really prepared to take notes or inclined to think about it really hard. And then, as I said, straight from the bottle, so not much for looks or aroma. Would like to try again some time so I can update my review.","Libeertarian","Saturday at 09:55 PM"

What a refreshing beer for me, but also for the industry that I think is lacking in experimental wheat brews.

Aroma is very hoppy and lemony. Taste is definately hop, grapefruit and a touch of well balanced sweetness. Flavor hits right up front and leaves very quickly mid swallow. Hardly any aftertaste or lingering hop bitterness. Carbonation is moderate and feels good on the palate. Expecting more but am very pleased with my first taste of FFF.","hophugger","Oct 28, 2014"

Now I see why this became on demand for year-round supply as opposed to seasonal release. This is the best of the two dominant wheat styles I've had. I implore you to get your hands on this! I will buy this brew again, best believe it!","Caveworm","Jun 26, 2014"
4,-5,4,4,4,4,4,"Gumballhead brewed by Three Floyds Brewing Co. & Brewpub with an ABV of 5.6% This brew pours out a nice cloudy amber color with a thick white head. This brew is an unfiltered brew it is cloudy. The smell is rich with citrus. You pick up on orange, lemon, and lime. There is also a spice to this brew. The taste is smooth and rich with a bitterness at the end . Gumballhead is a nice, balanced brew. Three Floyds Brewing Co. & Brewpub did a nice job with this brew. Mouthfeel is clean and relishing. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out of 5. I would get this brew again.","nicholas2121","Jun 26, 2014"

Grassy aroma, somewhat floral, with light notes of citrus and toasted wheat. The taste is, again, grassy, leafy, herbal, floral, very light notes of citrus pith, the malt bill bringing in toasted wheat and grain husks. Herbal finish with a nicely drying bitterness. Light-medium body with a moderate carbonation. Comes across almost like an APA, which is a good thing. Drinks nicely and pairs with pretty much whatever you're doing.","Rifugium","Apr 20, 2014"

I had this on tap that they only had 22 ounce drafts (I was not complaining) It poured a pretty clear but smooth appearance, also noted a little head formed. The aroma is phenomenal, a very hop-forward yet APA scent. Obviously being three floyds the hops will definitely be prevalent and with Gumballhead they did not disappoint. Overall, I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Any time any restaurant has it on draft I will be purchasing.","Beer_Sherman","Dec 28, 2013"

Lots of lacing on the glass as the head recedes. Aroma is sweet lemony, grassy hops, malt sweetness and honey, peaches, then some floral potpourri. This smells like hop candies. Flavor is big lemon hops with a lightly sweet malt backbone and some peachy character. This has a big time punch of flavor and the floral lemon flavors longer on the palate. Very light bodied, a bit of slickness, and high carbonation. I can see why people love this one. Super quaffable and lots of flavor. Nicely balanced between the hops and malts. Might be one of the best beers for drinking a 6-pack that I have had.","BMMillsy","Dec 12, 2013"

Like I said before, I’m not sure how they fit all the hop aromas and flavors in without giving this thing some inappropriately high bitterness, but it’s good news for everyone that they did. I’ve always been interested in how an American pale wheat ale had such a high score on a site where DIPAs and BA stouts rule the roost and now I know why – it’s simply a great beer. This was my first Three Floyds beer and I’d LOVE to try more. Thank you SO much for the opportunity to try this one, Jared!","BlackBelt5112203","Jul 31, 2013"

I have to say this pour does not do this ale justice and ill have to track down a few bottles to get the review across. I'm not going to sit here and pound this ale as if I didn't enjoy it nor am I going to rip the girl that did the fill. But I'm not going to pretend like I loved it either bc its one of my go to breweries. This Is a very good pale wheat ale and one of the best. The problem is its a subpar style. It has all the right qualities to being the best pale wheat ale in the world as I'm sure a bottled version or a proper fill would have shined. I'm sure ill re-review this here soon with better results.","BradtheGreat7","Jun 25, 2013"

This is not as boozy or pungent as ZD, nor as syrupy or chewy as AK, but somehow it falls right in between, with the wheat malts making this stand out a bit more. Absolutely an excellent beer for the warmer weather, but this could work for any time of the year. Considering it's one of their tamer offerings, it's still chock-filled with fruity flavors and crispness that makes it a highly drinkable offering. I could have these all night if I needed to. A premier American wheat offering.","magictacosinus","May 26, 2013"

Earthy pine and grapefruit atop a solid base of bready and spicy malts. The flavor is pine and resin atop a spicy yeasty earthy wheat base. Lingering spicy hoppy finish long after each sip. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet resinous mouthfeel. Wow, now that's a wheat beer. Mild phenols don't distract my sensitive palette and the hop flavor and aroma makes this quite interesting.","johnnnniee","May 26, 2013"

4,-5,4,4,4,4,4,"red wheat beer, not as common a style as it should be, and this one is executed well. thanks to claystation for this one, what a champion he is! this pours a slightly hazy sunset red color, pale, with almost two inches of off white head with lovely lacing. the nose is quite hoppy for a wheat beer, which is welcomed. citrus aroma on that, with a slightly sweet red malt base, the what makes the whole thing feel summery. flavor is interestingly hop forward. oranges and lemon zest are detectable, and the wheat malt is unique in the sense that it has some real oomph to it, really flavorful and not lost in the hoppy shuffle this beer has going. yeast is not the standard hefe stuff I expected it to be, but a mildly peppery soft flavored strain that lets the other flavors do most of the talking. finish is balanced, but bitterness does dial up a bit. excellent carbonation and a medium body that makes this much more of a beer drinkers beer than some others. three floyds gets so much hype from the beer community, sometimes I think their stuff doesn't live up to it very well, but this is a fine example of twisting a style to be something else entirely, and its outstanding. this one is worthy of the praise.","StonedTrippin","May 12, 2013"

I had a Weinhenstephaner Hefeweissbier before this one and its hard to tell they are basically the same style. Hops are accented much more then the yeast in the European style. Easy to see why this is the flagship beer by Three Floyds, easily drinkable which gives it an overall commercial appeal.","KFBR392","Apr 09, 2013"

I'm a sucker for a sweet hoppy smell that is headed up with an abundance of citrus notes. The taste is very good as well. The citrus gets you up front followed by a relatively smooth hoppy finish. The only negative to say is that it doesn't go far enough with the citrus and hops. No doubt this is a very good beer that I would get again though.","sjones5045","Mar 31, 2013"

Beautiful weather, a couple of beers, the smell of stale piss, and hot dogs, made for a great day. Towards the end of the game my brother-in-law, Clem, asked if I would be interested in hitting a few bars around Wrigleyville. He was familiar with the area, and I wasn't, so we got the ok from the rest of the family and started our wonderful beer journey. We hit up Goose Island and then went to what is known as an Iowa bar?, Merkles (www.merkleschicago.com). Seeing a sign advertising $3 draws of Dogfish Head Aprihop made it a relatively easy decision. Anyway... after a few Aprihops I decided to try Gumballhead, this was before 3 Floyds blew up as a brewery, and I was blown away by it! Calling it an American-wheat is kind of misleading as this beer packs a pretty amazing hop punch, not much wheat present in this beer, maybe a bit on the palate at the end of the beer, but I don't care, this a very drinkable, thirst quenching, brew.","iabeerbaron","Feb 25, 2013"

It is golden yellow with a white that has good retention (most likely from the wheat in the beer). It is very aromatic for a light beer and has a floral and citrusy smell. The first taste will tell you that it is highly hopped, but what makes this beer so good is that they are late addition hops. This is not an overly bitter beer and the majority of the hop is in the smell and flavor. It finishes cleanly and is best served by the pitcher. Great beer to try!","seanorear","Dec 15, 2012"

Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass, with some good streaming carbonation. Aromas of pineapple, grapefruit, lemon zest, orange zest, floral, pine, herbal, grass, and wheat. Damn nice aromas with good strength and hop/malt balance and complexity. Taste of pineapple, grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, grass, pine, wheat, and herbal spiciness. Fair amount of floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, citrus zest, floral, grass, pine, wheat, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice amount of hop flavor and good complexity and balance; zero cloying flavors on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming on the finish. Overall this is an excellent pale wheat beer. Very nice hop flavor with good balance and complexity; extremely smooth and easy to drink. A highly enjoyable sessionable offering for sure.","superspak","Dec 08, 2012"

If Im going to drink a pale wheat, give me Lil Sumpin Sumpin any day of the week!   This is not something I would likely drink again, but Im glad I got to try it.  Also happy to try the #1 rated beer in a given style.  ","zac16125","Sep 22, 2012"

A touch of sweet malt joins and makes its presence know, but not in a way that would weigh down this brew. Finishes light, fairly dry and crisp with a pleasant hop bite.

It's basically an IPA with wheat. The wheat (small amount detected) isn't prounounced and there isn't a wheat beer yeast character at all. I'm guessing the yeast is an IPA yeast or ale yeast and not a wheat ale yeast or hefe yeast. All the better. An elevation and transformation of styles. This beer is a classic.","TSJ4000","Jun 19, 2012"

They've changed the recipe since last I had it. And not for the better. The mouthfeel is still slick and moist, but the lovely Amarillo hops are quickly overcome by a peat flavor.

Poured a hazy pale yellow with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, wheat, and bubblegum. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, wheat, and bubblegum. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I had this brew quite some time back before I was reviewing and took this opportunity to finally write a formal review. This one is definitely one of my favorite Pale Wheats out there as there is just so many things going on. I really liked the bubblegum aspect I picked up on this time around as it completely threw me off-guard. It also made this one quite refreshing and easy to drink. I would recommend this to anyone out there without hesitation.","thagr81us","May 15, 2012"

This beer has an amazing aroma, its very citrus dominant as well as some skunky hops, the aroma of the hops is lightly backed up by a wheat caramel smell. This is an easy drinker for sure. This beer has a light character and a very pleasant hop presence but its far from strong. Im the kind of person that can take down a dreadnought bomber with ease so this beer is rather lackluster in taste and feel. Having said that, it is a grade A example of what this beer is trying to be.","TwelveOunces","Mar 12, 2012"

Foamy chunks of lace form randomly on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat, honey, and citrus zest. Taste is of wheat crackers and different types of citrus zest (especially lemon). There is a very mild bitterness that quickly fades from the palate. There is a nice crisp level of carbonation with each sip. Overall, this is a pretty good hopped-up wheat beer but not something I would seek out again.","UCLABrewN84","Feb 28, 2012"

By FAR the best in style I've ever smelled. Taste follows suit: fairly light, but great fruit, hops, and floral flavors. Some grass as well as it warms. Feel is light, with incredible carbonation/aftertaste. Overall, there's a reason this beer leads it's style. It's incredible, a great session brew. Really glad I got to try this one.

Mouth is lightly sweet, banana, bitter hops at the finish with some citrus rind. End of finish is sort of discordant. An interesting take on a wheat beer, one of the more brightly hopped ones I've had, and well done. That being said, I can't see this having a regular place among beers I would like to drink regularly as it's kind of too sweet for a pale ale and too brightly hopped for a wheat beer.","JAXSON","Dec 04, 2011"

You get a light, crisp, fruit taste with just enough bitterness. The balance between flavors and bitterness is the highlight of this brew in my opinion. overall a delicious brew for any season but especially during those hot summer days. The downfall of this beer is the hype vs. Availability. Although it's a great beer, having to call my local liqour store to check availabilty and then being laugh at doesnt make me want to drink it as much as I want to.

Crystal clear yellow/ golden color with frothy white head. Smell.. Lots of citrus.. mango and pineapple, and a little bit of hops coming through. Taste is mild.. Light Tropical fruits as mentioned above and some citrus hops. After taste has a touch of biter hops. I could drink these all day.

The aroma is fruity and citrusy, a nice balanced burst of hops, not to much. Bitter hoppiness up front, with great citrus and grapefruit quality following in the wake. A very clear presence of wheat with its distinct cracker like flavor and mouthfeel. Fluffy mouthfeel, light but some of that resin hop mouthfeel quality.

I had some european beers before this one and its hard to tell because they are basically the same style. Hops are accented much more then the yeast in the Europeans. Easy to see why this is the one of the regular beers by Three Floyds, easily drinkable which gives it an overall commercial appeal.","GBallHead","Nov 14, 2011"

4.23,0.5,5,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"D/O: More or less as promised, this beer smells like Ballast Point's Sculpin IPA but embarks upon its own evolutionary path when it comes to flavor. It uses each of its marquee ingredients to full effect, wringing floral aromatics from the Amarillo hops and soft bread from the wheat. It is compelling and palate-friendly, but like the most interesting West Coast IPAs, does not play well with most other flavors.","beagle75","Oct 19, 2011"

Not a huge head but it sticks around nicely. A little bit of floral hops in the scent, but mostly grassy and earthy notes. Flavor is right there with the nose. A bit of sharp bitterness up front, followed quickly by smooth bready earthy and grassy flavors. Nice smooth and balanced finish. Fairly light body without a ton of carbonation.

4.12,-2.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"I'm guessing this stuff is dry-hopped; it's certainly got a ton of sweet citrus in the nose, backed up with wheat and yeast. A very tasty beer that's much hoppier than you typically see from the style. A minor complaint is that the hops somewhat overpower the wheat, but like I said, tasty stuff. Abundant carbonation and a fairly clean finish accentuate the moderate level of bitterness. The wheat pitches in there, too, no doubt. Toss in the light malt profile and crazy tropical fruit flavor combo, and this stuff is really more like a "wheat IPA" than anything. An easy recommendation for this unique brew.","PDXHops","Sep 27, 2011"

My personal opinion of the gumball note was that it was interesting at first, but tasted more and more out of place over time.

Gumball Head is by far my favorite wheat beer. The appearance is a clear yellow/golden color with nice carbonation that provides good white head that is lacing nicely. The scent is a wonderful bouquet spice and citrus formed by the Amarillo hops. The taste has a great citrus combo of lemon/grapefruit/apricot and touch of spice that I can't define. The mouthfeel is fine...session....no question. This wheat beer could be a pale ale easily. An absolute must try.","WoodBrew","Aug 27, 2011"

4.2,-0.2,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours a suprisingly clean golden amber color, nice plume of white froth, decent lacing. First whiff is a remarkable rush of fruit from pineapple to mango to grapefruit to peach, light funky tartness from the wheat and a light whiff of simple syrup like sweetness. Taste brings the fruit to the front, but not as aggressive as the scent dictates and the tart and lightly funky wheat and yeast come into play, finishes with a touch of sweetness akin to a teaspoon full of powdered sugar. Medium bodied, surprisingly creamy and smooth. A very nice beer with a lot of positives, a little more kick of fruity hop flavor and I would be dying for more.","rfgetz","Jul 25, 2011"

The flavor is also highly hoppy, lots of citrus, quite lively on the tongue. A bit of wheat malt flavor pokes through the hops at the swallow, a nice subtle surprise. The finish is smooth and just a bit dry. The carbonation is medium-high and body medium. Overall a refreshing, yet subtly complex APA (yes I call it an APA).

The beer pours a nice golden color with a decent head. Not too much aroma coming off but a slight citrus fragrance. In you mouth it is a great summer flavor explosion going on with taste of sweet summer citrus and honey going on. Feels so good on the palate. I would drink 12 of these if I had the time. BTW....

4.38,4,4.5,4,5,3.5,4,"Narrative: Parents were a little skeptical of Gumbalicitus, a shiny new fangled prescription drug for unruly Midwestern children. Settlers used to call it wind sickness, but they soon learned that it was an irascible desire to leave locations of concentrated boredom. That is, until this new drug arrived, served in 12oz doses, the highly enjoyable cocktail drug apparently makes even the flattest, most agricultural areas completely tolerable. Iowa parents noted that their students even volunteered to stay in-state upon being prescribed this barbituate calming drug. Side-effects include narcolepsy, contentment, desires to attend comicons, Xbox live subscriptions, and consumption of Hot Pockets. Gumbalicitus is only to be provided to those in need.

So when I had a couple of these Gumballheads I was not expecting too much. The great hops and red wheat combine like chocolate and peanutbutter(figuratively) to make a badass easy sipping beer that has a lot of grapefruit, Lemon, and peach notes. I loved it. In fact I want to go back and change my review scores...done. So three floyds (not sold in my great state) your winning streak continues in my book. Good Day.","willyc","Jun 21, 2011"
4.42,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"From my weekend notes: This bottle has a heart of gold, like any good eighties comic underworld character. Smells nothing like a wheat ale, but still incredibly satisfying. Dripping with citrus, piney hop madness, this killer nose relays perfectly into the wheat-beer anchor of the brew. The orange marmalade hops blend with the clovey, grassy malt, creating a benchmark American Wheat Beer.","DWilliams76","Jun 20, 2011"

4.44,5.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The taste on this is much more restrained than I imagined based on the nose, but it's still very delicious. Instead of the hop attack that I thought I'd be getting, I got a nice and smooth citrus (lemon and grapefruit mostly), hop, and wheat kick. This trio just walks in thandem all the way through the finish, with the wheat and lemon fading first, then the grapefruit, leaving a nice lingering hoppiness. The mouthfeel is very good, it's smooth and has a lively amount of carbonation. The drinkability is exceptional.

The smell of the beer was hoppy, wasn't expecting that but I like it a lot. The soft aromas of grains and wheat are also in there. The taste of the beer has a wheat flavor upfront that is quickly kicked away by a rush of citrusy hop flavors. Kind of reminded me of HopSun from Southern Tier but on a better scale. The mouthfeel was smooth and yet had a good tingling finish. Overall this beer is a very nice release from 3 Floyd's. I'd buy this if they'd only distribute to PA again.","Knapp85","Jun 08, 2011"

The nose comprises orange zest, pine, orange peel, light grapefruit, light raspberry, banana, light cardamom, and some nice honey-dripped biscuit in the background. The taste doesn't really change this recipe all that much, but it does come across to me as a slightly watered-down, slightly wheated-up version of the smell, which does take away from the tastiness imbibed by my 'strils. It still tastes pretty damn good, but not as good as it could have, if that makes any sense. The body is a nice light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisply-finishing wet feel.

4.12,-2.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Had on tap at The Beer Trappe, poured a nice golden orange with a decent zesty white head that lingered for some time. Smell upfront was dominated by hops citrus and pine with a hint of grapefruit followed by an ever so faint bit of wheat and sweet caramel grain. Taste is very nice with a crisp hop presence up front with the smoothness of wheat coming through with a clean citrus hop finish. Everything balanced nicely in the taste. Mouthfeel was light and smooth not heavy like some of Three Floyds hoppier beers can be. Overall a tremendous APWA and a great beer to have when the summer grill outs arrive. Good sessionability.","rpardon7","Apr 14, 2011"

Mouthfeel is a little sweeter and heavier than I would expect. Sweetness just kind of hangs out in the mouth, but not really as a flavor, just as a feeling.

Great balance between the two. Mouthful is what is to be expected of a great wheat beer, very thin, but that is a good thing. Overall this beer ranks up with my favorites.

Pours hazy yellow-golden with a small, rocky white head and a few small particles of sediment. The head fades quickly to a minimal cover but leaves some lace as it goes. The aroma has prominent, but bitter notes of citrus along with some floral and lemon notes from Amarillo hops. There is also a touch of yeast and grass, with some wheat. The flavor starts with a restrained sweetness up front and develops a tangy acidity through the middle. Hops are present all the way through and these grow towards the finish. The finish is long with hops and lemony lingering on the palate. Palate is light-medium in body with a watery texture and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a very unconventional example of a wheat ale, but it is good. It is more assertive than most wheat beers and much more complex for the style.","CuriousMonk","Feb 15, 2011"

The head was about 3/4 of an inch and of average density. Unfortunately the head dissipated quickly after the first two sips. If I were to judge the style of beer by smell alone I would be convinced that this was a straight-up IPA. I did not detect any wheat in the nose. (though I'm no bloodhound) The taste was good, but not what I expected, which made trying this beer fun. It has interesting depth with the hop/wheat combo. The emphasis is certainly on the hops, and they have a pine flavor to them which I really liked. The wheat played second fiddle in this brew to the hops. The more subtle flavor of the wheat may be a letdown if you are looking for a good wheat beer, but if you enjoy wheat beers and IPAs then its a fun blend. Mouthfeel is medium to light and its pretty crisp and refreshing. Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. A good middle ground between two of my favorite summer styles.","gkunkle","Dec 14, 2010"

The aroma is decidedly hoppy and I must say I'm surprised at that for the style. However and nice and orange-piny the scent maybe I would still have liked to smells some wheat which did manage to elude my nostrils. The taste is surprisingly pleasant. I was, due to the aroma, expecting a mouth-full of juicy hops. Instead what I was awarded with was a sweet fruitiness. I believe that I was able to taste some nectarines and pineapple in the flavor. There was a hint of bitterness still which I didn't much care for, but I must admit this beer went down smooth as silk and was very easy to drink. I know most people would kill to have this on tap all the time, but as excellent as this beer is it doesn't have that "wow factor" that I look for.

When I smelt this beer A smile came on my face and I was content with just sniffing it all night but then came the taste. I felt like I was punched in the face with the most intense hops of a strong IPA until they mellowed out and I was left with one of the most pleasant tastes ever. Hook me up to an IV of this and I'll be good forever. Three floyds please distribute in Ohio again because I will be honest, I hate going to Indiana. It is the flattest drive and bores me.

Although this looks like a pretty typical pale wheat, the smell and taste is anything but. Lots of fresh, fruity hops, orange peel, and pine. The taste is excellent, I'm getting citrus, pine and lemon. Nice caramel malt and an amount hops that could be sufficient for an IPA, I'm already getting hop burps after a few sips. If you're really looking for a wheat taste you will probably be disappointed, I'm not getting any until the end, a nice fruity wheat finish. Gumballhead is easily a stand-out in a usually dull style, there is so much flavor and body here for a 4.8% beer. SO drinkable. Drinkability is through the roof, I finished this very quickly and enjoyed every second of it. This may be the ultimate session beer, if I ever am in their distribution area I will try to pick up a case of it. Three Floyds is definitely solid in my book right now.

This is one of those beers that in a BJCP competition would totally flunk out of the style guidelines, but I can't really hold that against it because this is a delicious beer. The mouthfeel has a bit of that milkshake thickness from the wheat with a prickly carbonation that isn't quite spritzy. The wheat adds good body for this sessionable brew.

It was one of the first beers I remember liking when I was in college, one of the first beers I drank for the taste rather than any other sort of effect. It pours out as kind a straw color, easily identifiable as an American wheat style beer. However, you will notice immediately upon the first sniff that this is no ordinary beer. Strong citrus and fruit smells are present. The taste carries through with this promise, as grapefruit, possibly apricot, and of course wheat combine for a complex and satisifying experience. I was glad to see that even after having many other high quality beers since I had last enjoyed Gumballhead, it still holds up.","bismarksays","Dec 08, 2009"

I don't think I'll pick up anymore, not when I have a tastier and easier to find American Wheat option right in my own backyard.

Has a clear golden color with a large head that had good retention. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. Wonderful hop aroma of citrus fruit, such as grapefruit and oranges. Also a touch of bubblegum which is odd since there is no yeast left in the beer. The flavor features the hops without all the bitterness. Grapefruit, pineapple, and tangerines all tantalize the tastebuds. Bitterness is detectable but low. Under 20 IBUs if I was to guess. Not much if any wheat malt is detected so it is not perfect. Has a bigger body than others in the style and carbonation is bubbly without being harsh. Wonderful to drink in the summer or any season for that matter. Nice sessionable ABV. The one major nitpick I have for this great beer is the price at over $11 for a six pack. Ouch.","morimech","Nov 17, 2009"

The smell is almost pure amarillo hops, pure, raw and delicious really. I mean, there's a bit of grassiness, a kind of skunkiness, maybe some tartness - very leafy and floral. There is also a hint of pale malt and wheat sweetness. This smells as advertised, though if you were expected a wheat beer, you would be thrown off. The taste isn't quite as floral or leafy as the smell, there's not a lot of bitterness, which is good, not too much on the resin front, but the taste is of tart cherries, oranges, grapefruit, though lacking acerbic rind taste. The malts kind of provide a kind of fruit soda taste, like berries or plums, but the balance is actually quite nice. There is just a hint of some leafy, grassy hops, which is nice in some applications, but I'm not sure I wanted here. Good mouthfeel, light and crisp, a nice bite of carbonation, and the wheat provides just enough body, when combined with the resinous hops, to make this a very pleasant delivery. This beer drinks very well, and is very enjoyable. The relatively low ABV is nice in the afternoon, and this is one I could stick with for a while. It drinks very well right through the middle, and except for the tiny bit of overdone grassiness in the finish, an excellent beer. A beer that you must try out of novelty at least.","taylorhamrick","Jun 27, 2009"
3.92,-6.9,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured to about a 1 inch head. Had some nice big bubbles. Head was slightly offwhite in color. Beer was a cloudy yellow. Head didnt hand around very long, but left some lacing with every drink. Smelled of grapefruit, piney hops, very citrusy. Smelled good. Had a stong citrus grapefruit flavor. Also that pine flavor going on. Slightly sweet. Maybe a hair bitter aftertaste. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was about right. At 4.8 alcohol, you could make this a good session beer.

There is a great deal of spicy crispness. The finish is bitter, but not exceedingly so. The wheat is subdued, and provides a nice background for the hops, which is why i like this more than any other wheat beer I've had. Mouthfeel is light, with a fair amount of carbonation.

Alas, Three Floyds usually tends to do something interesting so I am pumped to try this one. Pour is a nice bright gold, with a finger worth of white head. Smell is pungent in a good way. I get lots of wild flowers, grassy notes, and lots of lemon. Taste is more oriented towards the hops, which do show a nice mix of grapefruit, grass and spice. The wheat is not really that apparent, at least to my palate. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, and endlessly drinkable. This is a beautiful creation from Three Floyds.

Haven't delved into the more high-octane stuff from FFF but so far I'm really impressed at how they are able to make such sessionable brews that are still really hoppy, and in not-so-popular styles too. This beer is a slightly hazed light golden. Zesty hops hit first and combine perfectly with tangy wheat base imparting an almost citrusy lemon flavor. Yeah, it says that right on the side of the bottle, but it's also true, it does have a lemony tang often associated with Hefes. So light and crisp, totally refreshing, plenty of hops. Interesting.

Well, it worked, and the result - though perhaps not the more stylistically accurate APWA out there - nonetheless manages to combine some of the best elements of a wheat ale (a crisp, low in abv%, and refreshing brew) with those of its more highly-hopped cousins (flavor, improved head retention and lacing).

There were two sixpacks on the shelf and when I went back the next day the other one was gone. Still, I'm gonna enjoy this brew and won't sit on it too long. I'll be visiting family in the Chicago area after New Year's and will definitely look for this beer again. I have a couple places where I might find it. Anyway, the beer is an excellent american wheat beer. Taste, mouthful and drinkability are perfect 5s and I don't think it's just me because it gets high marks with others here on beer advocate.

That being said, I've given plenty of IPA's good reviews and my mediocre rating of this beer isn't the result of my personal preference. Rather I think this beer is too one-dimensional. If you want to make a hoppy wheat beer, go nuts. However, I think it needs a bit more malt body to stand up to the hops. If you're a hophead looking for a lawnmower beer, this is for you.

Some very light wheatiness, but overall, it smells like an APA or even IPA. Interesting...this one must be along the lines of the ST Hop Sun. Flavor is interesting. Biting carbonation on the top up front moves into more floral hops this time. Tons of citrus in there, and very mild wheat and yeast flavors as well. A highly bitter brew, especially for an APWA. Carbonation's high, but good for what they seem to be going for here.

Faint lacing. A shocking hop aroma for a wheat beer, yeasty, citrus and some earthy tones. Hops are upfront in the initial taste, but it fades and hides behind the sweet malty flavors as well as the citrus from the wheat. Clean and crisp mouthfeel, not heavy at all.

Some candy like sweetness in there, and a hint of wheat as it warms, but the hops are the star. Taste is smooth, balanced, yet hops play a big role in the taste as well and make the flavor pop unlike in any wheat beer I’ve ever had. Subtle, and slightly lingering wheat finish. The hops are so crisp, bright, and refreshingly flavorful with the perfect amount of bitterness. Wow, this is simply awesome. I wish this were available in Texas. Damn near perfect. One of my favorite beers, and FFF's hop profile is probably the cleanest, most citrusy and refreshing that I've ever had.","JDV","Mar 01, 2008"

Definitely a good beer that I would try to get whenever out if they had it on tap and i think it would be especially good with food since it is kinda lighter bodied and crisp.

Smells of straw, cereal, citrus notes like lemon peel and a slight hint of sour apple. The taste of honey and sugar cereal up front follow with a good malt backbone, and the citrus and bitter hops leave this a very balanced and unique tasting wheat beer with a crisp finish.

Head faded pretty quickly and left some spotty lace behind. Smell is wheat, citrus, pine and HOPS! Tons of hops in the nose with a bit of spice. Never smelled a wheat beer quite like this. Wow! What a great flavor as well. A nice wheat flavor with a bit of lemon zest, some nice pine notes in the background, and a serious hop bite. Quite smooth though.

A very fluffy large head of white formed on the top and this gradually gave way to copious side glass lace. A great aroma hear, very light with lots of floral light hop[s in the back a really nice grassy and yeast like front to it. This translated over very well to the flavor. A very light floral and bright flavor dominated by grass like flavors, punctuated with peaches, and orange hop flavors. Very light bodied with ample carbonation made this one that was not too filling, and this almost qualified as a water substitute it was so good. I thoroughly enjoyed every last drop of this. It has to be hands down the best I have ever had in the style and one of the best session ales I have ever tried. I would buy a case if they sold it here and have one for dinner every night.

Smells great! Hop nose is floral and seems to be perfect for the wheaty malt character. Tastes like I wish every wheat beer would taste. The wheats I have tasted seem to miss the hop character that FFF's has found with this beer. Of course, it is FFF's we're talking about here! Mouthfeel is hard to nail down. Seems a little watery, but at the same time I get the cloying feeling that most wheats leave on my tongue.

It poured a nice light golden color with a short lived small head. Smell is wheat, hops, and a hint of slight lemon. Taste is much the same, except with the presence of some well placed hops.

The aroma is the real prize here, just overflowing with Amarillo hops, lemony and bright, just unstoppable. The flavor is more muted and even a little sweet. The hops come to the rescue, cutting a potentially saccharine beer down to size, and keeping the mouthfeel quite mild. A very drinkable brew.

From one of the new 12 oz bottles, this pours a hazy canary yellow body with over an inch of creamy white head. Good retention and extravagant lacing make for an excellent appearance. Bold aroma of pine cones, grapefruit, and a hint of yeast. Medium to light medium body with strong carbonation. Taste is aggressively hopped. Pine cone and citrus rind run amok. Black pepper and lemon hints underneath. Granted, the hops elevate this above its mundane style but the hop bitterness seems somehow out of place.

I've heard its quite hoppy for this style, but wow. Taste starts of with a strong amarillo hop bite but is quickly taken back by the wheat. A tiny bit of bready malt comes to the tongue in the aftertaste, could probably use a bit more IMO. Mouthfeel is light/medium bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation, love how this one feels. I could easily put these down on a hot summer day, or any day. I definitely need to trade for this one again. This style is slowly growing on me.

At first I was taking sips of this beer and it was too cold to make a good judgement. I thought bland and carbonated but as it warmed it became clear what this is all about. Lemon zest with other fruits intermingling. I can almost taste a little honey, melon type sweetness. It literally improved sip by sip and seemed pretty phenominal to me. Mouthfeel was a little light and a little too carbonated but nothing too serious to fuss about. Drinkability makes this one choice for a nice summer day.

This beer gives you the benefits of wheat...a little lighter, a little more crisp, but you get to keep the hops! I've taken off points of other beers for not being within style guidelines and think I need to be somewhat consistent or this score would be even higher.

Im picking up sea-air Saaz funk, raw, resinous chronic, herbal mintiness, and citrus zest hoppiness. Wow. Light malt sweetness plays its part, though, making this very drinkable.

If you didn't see wheat written on the bottle you would have no idea it was one. If you are a big fan of the wheat taste you may not be too impressed here. Glad I have a nice stash of these to enjoy over the winter. Very expensive for me though. The 22oz bombers were $5.99 each. Would I buy again? Without question....yes!","mattgert","Sep 30, 2006"

4.52,7.4,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Gumballhead pours a dirty bright yellow, a very pasty thin white swirling head. The nose is an on/off combo of faint hops, fresh fruit, herbs and definitive citrus-like aromas, more noticeable towards the middle-to-end of this beverage. The initial taste could confuse some of the most experienced beer lovers--a hop-infused wheaty biscuity blend. There is a fair amount of carbonation, in fact a bit over-powering at times. Zesty, creamy and hoppy; each sip and drink develops a sort of a different blend of flavorings, am I enjoying a hop-infused-wheat beer here? Yes. Lemon peels, orange juice and table crackers noted in the body. With 3-Floyds, it's not a surprise that they've "hopped up" another brew, but this AP Wheat Ale tops em' all--this is a gem, smooth and slick and a winner in my book.","GeoffRizzo","Sep 16, 2006"

The smell makes you treat the beer as you would a sweet beverage and you tend to twirl it around the tip of your tongue - and you'll notice the sweetness is there all right.

But I can't help feeling that this is almost a wheat APA or IPA (the hops profile is about the same as Alpha King), rather than a APWA.

I was told they use Amarillo hops in this wheat and that is one of the reasons I was very interested in trying it out. While technically it is an American wheat ale, it is unlike any other I have ever had. I tend to dislike standard American wheat ales finding them to be very bland and definitely needing the lemon wedge they are served with. This beer destroyed that stereotype. The amarillo hop addition gives this beer quite a bit of flavor. The hops have a citrusy, similar to grapefruit flavor to go along with their bite and it really makes quite an impression when drinking Gumballhead. I can find this beer in 22oz bottles, but most liquor stores want $6 / bottle, and unfortunately I just can't justify spending that kind of money. Great beer, but the limited production quantities keeps the price a little too high.","Generik420","Aug 04, 2006"

The smell is distinctive three floyds with big citrusy hops. There is some grapefruit and sweet peach aroma. Taste is also quite hoppy with the wheat adding a little sweetness to the orange and peach flavors. The wheat is barely discernible behind the citrusy hops, maybe just a little nutty flavor. A little spiciness and dryness in the finish, light to medium body.

Decent head that goes away pretty quickly with very light lacing to be left behind. A tad cloudy due to the yeast conditioning. Smelled of lemony citrus and hops. Very pleasing aroma. This is a very unique wheat beer and has much depth; something severely lacking in many wheats imo. When the beer is still very cold, you would swear you were drinking an IPA. Hop bitterness, grassiness, smacking you all over the place. When it warms up a bit, the wheat presence shows it's face and the hops bitterness becomes a little more sweet and citrusy. Mouthfeel is light, slippery, and crisp. Great beer for these hot summer days. I am highly impressed with this offering from FFF, who never fail to impress me.

Appearance is a hazy golden brass-hued amber color with a thin head with a constant ring of white lacing that clings to the glass. Aroma is sweet and hoppy, citrusy notes mainly grapefruit, no real wheat or grain smells present, although may very well be the source of the sweetness I can't quite put my finger on. Taste is very similar to the smell, wheat is exceptionally well hidden behind the hoppiness, and can only taste any wheat in the aftertaste. Tastes much like a milder version of an IPA, maybe a hoppier APA, nothing like any other wheat beer I've had the pleasure of sampling. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied, lighter end of the carbonation spectrum. Finishes dry and crisp with a slight grassiness from the high amount of hops in this beer.

Fierce yet subtly melded hop flavors of orange rind, peach nectar, sugared nasturtiums, etc. I honestly don't taste much in the way of wheat, but there's some sort of sturdy but definitely understated malt bill going on here. The cool thing about this beer is that the hops are definitely the star of the show, so the malt just gets out of the way, playing a strong but demure supporting role. But the hops are anything but brash. They're just all summery floral and the like. Light and airy mouthfeel, goes down substantially enough but remains devastatingly refreshing. I am so goddam jealous of those of you out there with regular access to this beer (not to mention other Three Floyds offerings). I had to drive to freakin' New Jersey to get this bottle!

The taste is amazing, some nice hop bitterness and spiciness up front followed by a surge of juicy fruitiness that tastes almost like a gumball, followed by a nice clean but full wheat finish. The mouthfeel is rich for a wheat beer and a little less crisp than some, as it coats the mouth a little, but still quite good. I could drink this all night.

If I want an American Wheat beer I want, well, wheatiness to be prevalent. Likewise, if I want a hoppy beer I know where to look (APA, IPA, etc) plus its not very bitter.

It's not fair because this beer is hands-down a better beer than any other Pale Wheat Ale that I have ever drank. Calling this beer a Pale Wheat is misleading and completely over-hopped for it's style. The alcohols show an interesting evaporative cooling effect without much drying. The hops, although pleasantly citrus, adds a mild dish-soap flavor that becomes distracting as the beer warms.

So all I read was the front, Gumaballhead, Three Floyds, Wheat Beer. Yeah, wheat beer. So of course I was shocked when I took a whiff of this stuff and got bitch-slapped by some serious hops. NOT what I was expecting. Once I regrouped and knew what I was smelling, and took some time to really enjoy the wonderful citrus and piney hops aromas supported by some nice, bready, caramel malts and THEN the wheat, which is pretty far in the background of the nose. In the taste, theres more of a wheat presence here than in the aroma, but still not very strong. Theres a good marriage of bitter citrus and sweet malts going on here. The light flavor of wheat brings along a little bit of bubblegum toward the finish but is quickly pushed aside. It has a medium body, dry texture and light carbonation. This beer was a very unique and wonderful experience. Surprisingly easy-drinking for as hoppy as the aroma is. Wish I had more than 1 bottle of this stuff.

The wheat is more felt than tasted, and lightly at that, which gives this a close to medium bodied mouthfeel. This reminds me more of an APA or IPA than it did of a wheat beer, but despite the lack of any wheat flavors, I still like this offering from Three Floyds. I just wish it felt and tasted more like a wheat beer.","RedHaze","Jun 25, 2006"

The taste opens with a rich grapefruit/citrus flavor, fading toward a relatively clean finish with mild alcohol and moderate bitterness. Mouthfeel is light and perhaps a bit watery, but with nice carbonation. To review this beer honestly, I believe its an average wheat beer, but the over-addition of amarillo hops gives it a strong Alpha King-like flavor to please the hop loving crowd.

It's very drinkable, goes down relatively easy, but with a slightly bitter floral aftertaste which lingers a little while (which isn't a bad thing). I can't taste much wheat in it, to me it's closer to a pale ale than a wheat beer, even though it's a combination of both. The lace stays on the glass for a while, too. I'm not a big pale ale/hoppy beer person, but this beer is pretty good. It's hoppy, but not overpowering. Nice and refreshing! I would drink this again, it's a quality brew.

It has a pleasant aroma of wheat and piney/citric hops. The first sip reveals lemon and orange rind with a wheat tang and a good hop bitterness on top of a medium body that feels like it belongs to a beer almost twice its strength. Quite a tasty beer, and even though it has a low ABV, it seems almost like a precurser to wheat wines with the very pronounced wheat and hop characters.

Although for being a wheat beer this is somewhat of the mark but for an interpretation this is excellent. Citrus overtones, with few hints of bread. Mouthfeel is some what dry and bitter, I find the appeal for IPA's, not so much for wheat beers. Overall this is great. Interpretation, by the Floyd family.

The palate is an enjoyable blend of an unfiltered wheat character with some assertive, sharp hop flavor. Bitterness comes through mid-palate, but smooths out on the finish.

The wheat is obvious and provides a refreshing character, but theres not much else to me. Im not sure how well the hops mix with the rest, it is very citrusy, mandarine/lemon profile and tart, definitely not my favourite balance, but thats probably just my preference for less abrasive citrusy hops. It doesnt feel too fresh as it is. At the same time, the palate is globally thin, though it has a slight creamy tinge. Moderately high thin-bubbled carbonation cleans the tongue nicely though. Nevertheless, Id get bored of having this as my main summer quencher. Give me a burgerbrau helles anywhen over 3 of these.","Rastacouere","Sep 11, 2005"

Tastes mostly hoppy but with enough underlying sweet to carry them well. Hops start with a tang and pine followed by a grapefruit kick and refreshing orange. Hop bitter is clean and in line with the intensity of the hop flavors and the sweetness. Although beneath the hops, the sweetness is a rich sugary treat, like some crazy kids candy.

My girlfriend, like a few other reviews I have seen, really enjoyed this one as well, which doesn't mean it's a light or sweet beer but instead something very well made and balanced.

Hops are immediately prickly on the tongue, and are complimented surprisingly well by the big wheat flavor. Lemons and orange peel jump out, assisted by some tangerine and maybe even a bit of apple. Yeast is not unnoticed in the flavor, although it is subtle. Toasty malt is also there, setting some solid ground for the hops and wheat to tread upon.

Believe me, I know of FFFs propensity to over-hop anything that travels through their tanks, but this is working for me big time - The floral and piney hoppiness that comes out of this beer is so soft and matches so well with the rest of the beer. There's also touches of apricot and clover honey. This beer is very light in color  pale and golden, with a slight haziness making an appearance after the 2nd pour, due to the rousing of the yeast. The initial pour and tasting was from a perfectly lucid beer. The wheat malt lays a perfectly sweet foundation for those floral gummy hops. Not too sweet or too hoppy by any means. Any bitterness is beaten down with a sweet wheat malt stick. The finish is clean and has just the right amount of sour tang. It seems like most hefs have an abundance of sourness. Its not a bad thing, but the tempered sourness in this beer, along with the hops, made drinking this beer an extremely enjoyable experience. Perfection","pezoids","Mar 05, 2005"

Light-bodied and very easy to drink, with less hops in the flavor than in the nose but still a great amount. There is also a nice wheat presence along with some lemon and grass.

Anyway clear golden when poured, no head (I didn't see any in anyone else's glass either). Heady hop aroma, full of spun sugar and cinnamon. Taste wise, it starts out as a typical hoppy 3F's (I am thinking about dreadnaught)...the one thing that reveals it's wheat moniker in my opinion is that it finishes light, as opposed to bitter or syurpy.

Immediately, my taste buds were expecting that typical wheat beer taste but they were totally caught off guard by the heavy duty hops. It poured a deep golden color, slightly hazy, with a fluffy, off-white head that left tight lacing behind. The aroma was nearly all hopsIt smelled entirely of grapefruit, some black pepper, and a slight wheat thing happening in the background. The taste was all hops up front, big grapefruit flavors and plenty spicy. Gently sweet, delicate wheat flavors come through ever so slightly just before a mellow, barely bitter aftertaste sets in. The mouthfeel was medium with medium carbonation. Stuff is highly drinkable. Each swallow leaves you thirsting for another gulp. Good, interesting stuff. Never had a wheat beer like this before.","oxmasterscream","Aug 15, 2004"

A little caramel like flavors sneak there way in towards the end of this brew also. Overall an interesting offering from Three Floyd's, that's just in a style of its own really.

Taste is at first one of a nice refreshing wheat, but the Amarillo hops then sneak in and turn the beer into a little hop monkey. Its almost like two beers in one. At first you think you are getting a wheat ale, but by the end you are thinking you might have gotten your glass switched with a pale ale. Mouthfeel is good with pretty hardy carbonation, but for this beer the effervencene works. Drinkability is nice as well as one could put down a few of these quite easily.

There is a good malt and hop aroma, with the hops being more prevalent. The hops hit me first followed by a sweetness from the malt finishing with a second coming of the hops. Overall, a very nice flavor combination, as the hops don't linger too long, but just enough for my taste. The beer is moderately thick, but not offensively so.

4.24,0.7,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,5,"Hazed dark auric hue. Thin, but well retained cream white head leaves sparse lace. Pine sap and lemon atop grainy, tart wheat with a splash of light lovibond caramel malt. Bubblegum hints. Clean and enticing aromawise. Flavor is a facsimile of the aroma. Pine dominates, although there's a juicy honeydew melon presence that melds well with the stately wheat presence. Bitterness is well above the norm for the typically insipid style, and is within range for an APA. Wheat lends a slight tartness that adds to the impressive thirst quenching nature of this brew. Not deep maltwise, nor is it intended to be. The assertive hopping has elevated what would be a prosaic American wheat to a very respectable level. Thinnish in mouthfeel, but with a light viscosity that feigns richness. Finishes slightly soapy, with trace lemon Pine Sol hints, but otherwise squeaky clean. American wheats have their limitations, and Gumballhead overcomes one typical banality-- lack of any noteable hop presence. Any other alteration would have overly bastardized the style. It retains the effortless drinkability of American wheats, yet adds savourability. Truly unique.","marc77","Jun 23, 2004"

The color is a slightly hazy (not very cloudy at all) dark gold topped by a moderately sized white head. The aroma pits slight esters against a moderate fresh Amarillo aroma over fresh-baked bread. The flavor is a good amount of crisp wheatiness livened up with some grapefruit/juniper hops, making a very crisp, very refreshing brew. This is imminently drinkable.

No hint of bananas here. Slight wheatiness is also noticeable in the aroma. Very clean flavor, lightly wheaty and loaded with amarillo hop flavor. Highly bitter towards the finish, and just a bit lemony and sweet. Definitely different, nearly perfectly so.

Again, grapefruit and pine flavored hops with a great, but not overwhelming amount of bitterness. Several times, I swear I could faintly taste crunchberries. This is a wheat beer? Oh yes, 3 Floyds means hops. Light to medium body with good amount of carbonation. Overall, wow! I would certainly have another.

Taste: Heavenly, layer upon layer of this orgy of wheat, vanilla, and banana along with such a generous helping of Amarillo hops. Really hoppy flavored yet not that bitter extremely balanced, it's easy to say there's no other beer drinking experience like this out there. Mouthfeel: Creamy silky yet rediculously smooth going down, medium bodied with an even carbonation, a pure hop nectar.

Now this is my kind of an "American Wheat." The pine sap, burnt citric tones of the hops blend with some bubblegum esters and wheat spiciness to create one enjoyable beer. The dichotomy of the lingering sweet bubblegum and bitter 'rillos makes for a nice interplay. Nicely carbonated and about medium-full in body.

The nose is loaded with bright, fresh hops that are citrusy and lightly spicy with hints of pine over a delicately sweet, wheatish malt. The body is medium; and its lightly zesty effervescence leaves a lingering tingle on the front of the tongue as the rest of the beer fades smoothly away with a light creaminess. The hops displayed in the nose are clearly carried over into the flavor, dominating upfront but blending most exquisitely across the middle in a wash of sweetish, wheat-accented malt. The bitterness is held in check as it should be (@20 IBU's perhaps); yet the hop aromas and flavors shine!

Aromas are super fresh and hop focused. An orange malt aroma adds an initial summery feel, and once in the mouth the beer explodes with freshness. Ahhh, what a flavor! Spicy, citrusy, hoppy, grainy, smooth and again ohh so fresh. As the beer finishes one could swear that all the complexities of this beer combine to actually offer the taster the flavor of a gumball...I swear it!!

Like with most 3F beers, there's a big smack in the face of hops, this one is all Amarillo, giving a different more orangey taste. Pleasing orange color, too.

A clean crisp beer hides under the domination hop flavors of apricot and lemon. this beer is not overly bitter, like perhaps the hop flavor and aroma my suggest, it has a medium level of bitterness in the finish. I definitely know of no gumball that is quite so exquisite as this elixir. This is a damn good Summer offering, certainly not a traditional wheat beer, but the wheat lightens this beer up and makes it a great summer refresher.
