Anyway, this stuff pours a clear brass-gold topped by a finger of relatively short-lived white foam. The nose comprises mild wheat, a kiss of grass, and a vague sense of citrus fruits. The taste brings in more of the same, with everything coming through a touch brighter and simultaneously a touch blander, as though everything were interpenetrating everything else to such a degree that the pieces are increasingly difficult to parse. The body is a hefty light, with a moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, an okay brew, nothing I'll overtly insult, but nothing I'll drink again on purpose.","TMoney2591","Aug 03, 2013"

The smells follows suit as there isn't much to report, a hint of wheat malt but that's about it. The flavor also is dominated by a strong wheat malt character, too much so. Little in terms of hop character or bitterness really. There isn't much aside from wheat. Adequately carbonated and light bodied. Overall, this is just an average beer. Not bad but not great.

The best part about this beer is the way it looks with its golden yellow color, busy carbonation, clear clarity and small head. Beyond that the aroma is rather bland with a biscuti-like character and little else. The body is about right for the style as it falls into the light-medium range.

Texture is very thin and watery, at least the carbonation is lively, but again that reinforces the soda notion in my head. Smells very much like the lemon-orange medicinal oily aroma from a Wet-Nap that has been soaking in a glass of diluted tonic water. Seriously, it actually does smell like that. Flavor is thankfully(?) a lot blander than the nose would have you believe, coming across as a sort of generic ghost of a wheat malt mixed with mushy stale oyster crackers and a twist of citrus. I'll be avoiding this one in the future.","WastingFreetime","Feb 19, 2012"

The flavor profile is much of the same, with grainy, husk-like malt blending with slight wheat, orange and lemon notes. A medium-high amount of carbonation rounds out this light bodied ale. After the great caramel maltiness of the Full Moon Winter seasonal, this Spring release leaves the pallet refreshed and renewed.","phishsihq","Feb 19, 2012"

The body looks nothing like a wheat ale, not cloudy at all, completely transparent, it looks like a lager, I doubt there is any wheat in here at all. The head on the other hand is really nice, frothy and about one finger in length, but of course it is almost gone now. The head is totally white and the body like I said looks like a lager, golden in color. The appearance overall is nothing impressive. On the smell you pretty much just get that generic beer smell, almost no other smells there at all. There is a small hint of lemon, but that's about it, no hops, small malt character, and no wheat. The smell is pretty freaking lame. Wow, that's not good, I wasn't expecting this beer to be this bad. Probably the most boring blue moon I've ever had, which is saying a lot. There really isn't anything to it, there is that small lemon flavor I picked up on the smell, and then that generic beer taste. There are basically no hops in here and very little malt. There is a slight slight feel of wheat, which just might keep the taste above a 2. Other than that there really isn't much to speak of. As for mouthfeel, it's ok because of that small amount of wheat, but pretty crappy overall. Drinkability is ok because it's so light, but still, nothing special there. It's only redeeming factor is the fact that it's refreshing, that's about it, other than that, not a good beer.","MaltsOfGlory","Apr 14, 2011"

Hints of wheat, Pledge, and something that might have once passed for hops. The taste on this? Corn. Honey. Sticky-sweetness. It's passable, but just barely. I wouldn't really like another. The mouthfeel is thankfully thin, and the drinkability is alright. This is not a good beer. This is not a good beer at all.

2.02,-27.9,2,2.5,2,2,1.5,"Extremely disappointing beer. Idk why it is priced at where it is especially since this tastes kind of like a miller light with a hint of lemon and orange. Overall really disappointed and needs more flavor like their other seasonal fall and winter beers.","bpayan77","Feb 15, 2011"
2.78,-0.7,2.5,2,2.5,3.5,4,"d-like most of the Blue Moon beers this is pretty drinkable.","Mit","Feb 14, 2011"
3.4,21.4,3,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Not alot to say about it, it is what it is, has a slightly above average taste, smell is grainy. pours yellow, smells wheaty. Taste sort of seems like it attempts to get interesting but then it falls flat leaving more flavors of wheat and not enough of the more interesting notes that almost make it taste like a belgian blonde. It however is crisp which is good. It doesn't have alot though going for it to make it interesting, just a bit more good then bad though making it drinkable.","hdofu","Feb 13, 2011"
2.13,-23.9,2.5,2,2,3,2,"This company should stop. They should stop making new kinds of beer and they should stop creating attractive names and label art for their crap product. This beer smells like corn and 7up. It taste like soupy adjuncts. Loads of creamed corn and artificial lime flavor. Nothing resembling a wheat beer. If they hadn't filtered it, had some hop character, or tasted like anything besideds coors light with skittles it would be an improvement.","knoxtennessee","Feb 11, 2011"
2.58,-7.9,1.5,1,3.5,1.5,3.5,"Verdict - Slightly disappointed in terms of Spring beers after having Samuel Adams Noble Pils and then having this follow it up. I really enjoy the heavy floral and lime taste, but there isn't too much else going on for the beer.","Jesse13713","Feb 11, 2011"
2.63,-6.1,3.5,3,2,3,3,"Clean and crisp. This makes for a good warm weather beer. Not too much to ponder here when it's said all and done.","TheSarge","Feb 09, 2011"
2.76,-1.4,4,3,2.5,3,2.5,"D - Not bad, it is certainly quaffable but I have a hard time coming up with a reason why I would want to drink more than one of these. There is nothing particularly offensive here, but aside from some bland coriander character there isn't any real character at all. Not really worth the effort of twisting off the cap.","nickfl","Feb 06, 2011"
3.17,13.2,2.5,3,3.5,3,3,"Atmosphere is okay. Appearance is not much to speak of. Nose is not bad...grain and lime. Flavor is a fair combination of grain, citrus, and sweetness. Overall, this is a decent quaff.","bmwats","Feb 03, 2011"
2.55,-8.9,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"D - Even for the style this isn't a very enjoyable beer Coors filtered out any good flavors that could have been there the only reason to get this is if like me are currently in a beer waste land and want to try something new","armock","Jan 30, 2011"
3.04,8.6,2.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Smooth but light feel and drink and drinks more like, and viewed as, an American Blonde Ale rather than an APWA as the contribution of the wheat malt is minor for this brew. But then the body is light as well. Pretty generic.","HalfFull","Jan 27, 2011"
2.6,-7.1,2,2,2.5,3,3.5,"ok well i feel a little jipped by this beer. wheat beer typically is cloudy and this beer was as crystal clear as a mountain stream. that was a little odd. the smell was nothing special. and then when i tasted it, it was like a regular american light beer. normally i like bluemoon as a go-to beer cause most places have it if you go out to eat- and it makes for a good replacement for a boring old coors light with a meal. the blonde wheat however tasted just like a run of the mill boring american style beer. not a thing to get excited about.","mattkoon","Jan 27, 2011"
3.4,21.4,3,3,3.5,3,4,"This was okay. As with all Blue Moon products, they're what I go to when there's no really good microbrewery option available. Nothing too impressive, but not awful either. I'd call the beer average.","lespaulrocker","Jan 26, 2011"
2.9,3.6,3,3,3,3,2.5,"Pretty drinkable, but I think it's really caused by the lack of a bold flavor or something to that extent. Sessionable, but I usually go for bolder, richer drinks, so I'm probably not going to be quick on buying more.","RTJakarta","Jan 21, 2011"
3.35,19.6,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - won't have too much trouble finishing a 6er, but won't be rushing out for another. I hope Coors is smart enough to produce this into the early summer where it belongs. until then you'd be better off with regular ol' Blue Moon","obrendano","Jan 20, 2011"
2.48,-11.4,3.5,3,2,2.5,2.5,"Appears bright clear golden body with a bright white head, forms thin speckled lacing scattered around the sides of my glass. Aroma has some sharp wheat notes with hints of sweet fruit notes. A touch of citrus peels and grassiness going on as well. Flavor hits with a marshmallow like cremay sweetness with hints of citrus peel bitterness in the finish, seems like a wheat infused cream ale really. Mouthfeel is light bodied, carbonation is moderate, overall drinkability isn't anything to write home about. It's actually hard to drink more so than any golden beer should ever be.","WVbeergeek","Jan 15, 2011"
2.57,-8.2,2.5,3,2.5,3,2,"D: I am note usually a fan of the style and this is not a good example of the style. It is easy to drink, but so is water. Doesn't come across as refreshing or pleasant. Not something I would reach for again. I haven't had a regular Blue Moon in many years, but my recollection is that is a better beer. The 2nd one that was left in the fridge will be served to someone who doesn't like beer. Not worth trying, waste of calories.","wspscott","Jan 09, 2011"
