"A summer classic. Circus Boy pours a light golden color with a very fizzy head. The smell was mostly wheat with a little bit of citrus on the nose. I found the taste to be the exact opposite with a lot of lemon grass and orange flavors while not that much wheat. It was a little thin but for the summer I was pretty content with one. Overall it didn't blow me away or anything, but not a bad beer by any means either."
""
"The feel of this beer is crisp with a really light drinkable feel. This beer goes down easy and is low in ABV and makes for a good session beer."

"overall, this is a twist on the american wheat style that leans heavily on the lemon quenching aspects. i picked this up on clearance for a really low price, and had it been summer, i would have bought multiple cases."

"Magic Hat Circus Boy Hefeweizen (2013) - 4.5% ABV. Hazy unfiltered deep golden body. No head on pour. Decent lacing. Poor retention. Fairly active carbonation. Citrus, hay, and passion fruit aromas waft over maple syrup. Thick body. Very bright Orangina like nose. A little bread. Some bananas and apricots mid-palate. Hint of lager hops and barley back palate. Crisp but wet in mouthfeel. A little banana bread, gum, and slight hop note in the aftertaste. Very drinkable. Would go well on a hot day. Not overly complex. A fairly straight forward low citrus Hefenweizen. 3.5 out of 5. Good."

"O: BOOO-RING. The simple fact that it's just really dull instantly makes it better than the abomination that was Seance, at least. In a way, I hate these boring beers simply because they create dull reviews...just like this one."

"Overall: One of Magic Hat's best. Light beer with a hint of wheat and citrus. Almost like lemonade. I would purchase again."
""

"Overall – Not a flavor powerhouse, but rather easy drinking. A decent brew overall."

"I've never really had a bad wheat beer, but not really many that are great either. This beer is a little light, and the wheat flavor is subtle, there is also a bit of tange ib there. Definitely drinkable and as impressive as most other beers of its kind, but not more so."

"This is a somewhat unique hefeweizen that has a low abv which lets you get at it all afternoon without having to slow down. There's an interesting smoky/malt flavor that I'm noted to getting up of similar beers, that doesn't sound good, but surprisingly was. Bit of citrus as well as you MIT expect. Not my favorite, but if you want to try something different, it's not a bad idea."

"Picked up a few circus boys because I feel like even though its not great relative to other brews it's a must have at least once on a warm summer day. Nice medium carbonation with low ABV you can drink a 6 pack with ease and it goes down smooth. Limited twang or hops to it and mostly a light biscuit flavor with sour lemon lingering in the front and back of the mouth."

"Overall - Probably my least favorite beer from The Magic Hat brewery, but in all fairness, I am not the biggest fan of American style wheat beers in general. Give me a German style any day!"

""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O: Overall, I can't say it was a bad beer, but it wasn't a great one either. I expected more from the beer as Magic Hat usually has a great product."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I can't say that it's not worth a try, but there are better American wheats out there. I normally enjoy what Magic Hat has to offer, so I was a little disappointed with this one."

"O - Not bad at all. The addition of lemongrass gave this some nice tartness. This would be nice on a hot summer day."
""
"The beer is hazy and yellow, as is typical of the style. Small white head that leaves a thick trail of lacing on the glass. The aroma offers lemons, malt, cleaning solution. More cleaning solution and artificial lemon in the flavor. Lacking body, character. Tastes gimmicky, cheap. Just not my thing. I would never choose this over any German hefe. Not a repeat."
""
""
""
"A hint of pepper appears on taste; carbonation up front, and a watery back end. The foul scent is confirmed. A cask strength scotch is necessary for proper cleansing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If this were the only example I had for the style, I'd be bummed."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm not too impressed with this brew for what it's supposed to be.... It has a decent taste, but it's almost too easy of a drink (if you know what I mean)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Circus Boy pours a mostly hazy tangerine, with a decent amount of goldenrod highlights. Only half a finger or so of white foam tops the beer, and both head retention and lacing are basically nonexistent. The nose is entirely too weak. There's a bit of grainy wheat, and a trace of lemon, but that's it. The flavor profile is better, but just barely. The same wheatiness greets me first with each sip, but here it's followed by a light sprinkling of black pepper. A muted lemon zest note provides the finish. The body is a little full, and the carbonation a little lackluster, but still the mouthfeel is probably this beer's best quality. Circus Boy tastes like it's a bit past it's prime (not that there's any bottle dating present), but I don't think even in peak condition it's much more than an alright wheat beer (and for the love of God, don't call it a hefeweizen)."
""
"I feel dirty drinking out of this glass, but it's what they have here, so c'est la vie indeed. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises wheat, corn syrup, and very light lettuce. There's a palpable sweetness pervading. The taste holds notes of light funky wheat, old lemon peel, and a pinch of black pepper. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a surprisingly very dry finish. Overall, a pretty sad hefe. The yeast character is nil, the wheat is funky, and things just seemed generally off."
""
"Conclusion: Not a bad beer, but really not special either. There isn't much to set this apart from other APWAs, but the malt flavors are clean and textured. I suppose this is meant to be enjoyed with a lemon wedge. I would never turn this down, and if there were not so many fantastic local alternatives, I can't find any reason why I wouldn't want some stocked in my fridge, especially during the summer months."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Would make a much better summer beer. Not my favorite beer in the genre, but still a nice pour."

"Magic Hat is pretty successful by the standards of an economically oriented world. And while they provide a decent variety of styles and a couple of outstanding offerings, I don't know they deserve all the attention that's come their way, not when there are so many better microbreweries still wrestling for a share of the pie. Consider looking elsewhere."
""
""
"If you like this style try A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale by Lags....the standard IMNSHO and truly outstanding."

"O - This is a nice wheat beer. Glad I finally got to try it."
""
""
""
"Light body with fairly crisp carbonation, decent crispness. Still fails to clean up as much as it could. Watery. Not outstanding or particularly tasty in any way and not something I’d return to in the future."
""
"M - Thin body. Good carbonation. Finish is fairly clean."
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty basic Hefeweizen with a nice taste, a refreshing feel and a great drinkability. This is a brew that is light in alcohol and refreshing in taste, making it a great addition to any summer outing..."
"Very mild pale wheat that isn't too bad... now, when Magic Hat calls it a hefeweizen, that's when we have a problem."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not much to this beer, it would be good for beginners and beer pong, and that's about it I would guess."
"O) Enjoyed this beer... Really one of Magic Hats better offerings. Give this one a shot."

"12 oz bottle from Trader’s Joe. Pours hazy golden with a short lived white head. Nose is citrus fruit and some grassy hops. Body is medium and slightly crisp. Sweet wheat malt, citrus fruits, hints of spices and banana fill the mouth. Finish is long and pleasantly dry. It is not German Hefe but still pleasant, easy drinking brew."
""
""
"Overall this is a pretty damned good offering from the boys and girls from Magic Hat. I would definitly drink more of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: not a bad beer. I guess I found it interesting with the ""black pepper"" thing going on in an American Pale Wheat Ale. It may be something I just need to get used to, that's all. I'm not sure if I would get this again, maybe on tap."

"Light bodied, plenty of carbonation, thin, and watery. I'm not sure if this has been sitting for a while, or just placed on the shelf, but I am glad I only tried a single. I will pass on this in the future."
""
"Disappointed in this bottle and won't be trying it again--at least until I get a chance for a draft in Vermont to figure out the difference. After finishing my review, I saw the Alstrom review has being much higher. That review is from 2006, so maybe something has changed in the beer since then in spite of the name being the same, but iin reading Jason A's review I am not drinking the same quality of beer. Whether it's transportation, lack of Magic Hat sales in Minnesota, timing of when I bought it, etc, I'm not sure. Just doesn't live up."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour is yellow and slightly hazy with a slight foam head that dissipates quickly leaving no lacing. Smells of crackers, biscuit malt, wheat. Taste is wheat and corn, malt, yeast, a tad sour, with a bit of brightness from the carbonation.  Mouthfeel is medium to light but holds together adequately.  I wouldn't turn it down, nor would I seek it out. "

"O: Overall I enjoyed this beer, I had my doubts because M.H. can be so-so at times. I was surprised at the outcome."
"O: This is OK. Would probably benefit from the addition of a lemon."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not too good, a little sweet and much too tart. The carbonation didn't help."
"advertised as a hefe, this i think is mych more of an american wheat beer hybrid style. pours a slightly cloudy yellow color with visible yeast bits and a nice lacy head. smells fruity and malty, mildly spicy aroma. taste is very refreshing, noticable lemon or lemongrass element and a nice yeast flavor. very well carbonated and lighter bodied makes it a crusher in the summer, but this beer is good any time of year. one of magic hat's most popular beers."

"Overall I can think of many better offering but this one is a pretty good domestic Hefeweizen. You really have to get it fresh or take special note of the ""best by"" date because after a few months these flavors tend to age out (Had an old bottle once and it was yeasty and bland) OK beer overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall though, The Hefeweizen is a really good wheat beer. A few of my buddies tried it for the first time when the swung by last weekend and they loved it. This may be my favorite of that Magic Hat line as of this writing."

"Tried this beer again, after a long hiatus. I wish I enjoyed it more, but just find it so bland. It is an easy sipper, that can be sessioned. But I just cant find enough interesting character to warrent frequent returns. Wish there was some spice or sweet or more pronounced wheat or yeast character."

"O: I enjoyed this beer, as expected Magic Hat departs from typical Bavarian-style Hefe, but in a good way."
"Overall: This is a decent beer. It's a bit lacking in the flavor department as the taste in general is rather subdued, but it is a crisp, refreshing, and sessionable brew. I'm not sure why it's categorized in the APWA category, as there is almost no hop flavor to it. I've had better hefeweizens, but this particular one is not bad as a tastier party beer or a lawnmower beer."
"Overall, I'd give it a 2.5 because I was disgusted by the chunks of junk floating around in it!"
"O: not bad but not great, a middle of the road wheat beer in everysense, drinkable but doesnt stand out at all"
"Poured a 1.5"" white head which vanished quickly, reminiscent of some cheap brews. Hazy Naples yellow body color. Smell is very mild and most I can pick out of it is citrus zest. Taste is pretty BMC actually, enough so in a blind taste test I might not even guess it was a Hef. There's not much length to the finish and it leaves a slight aftertaste of malt."
"O: Another pedestrian wheat beer that I'm sure sells good, but is not inspiring at all."
"This is in my opinion all around weak. It's sessionable, but it's rather one dimensional."
"O: This is a decent hefe but a horrible APWA. I wouldn't mind a few of these during a summer BBQ but if you're looking for a hoppy pale ale you're going to be disappointed."
"I have a friend who loves Magic Hat beers but hates this one... I still struggle to see how that can be. For me Circus Boy is a top choice when it comes to Magic Hat. I had this for the first time back in March 2008 and I really enjoy it ever since. The beer poured out as a nice hazy yellow color, much like a Hefeweizen should look. The head was fluffy and white. The smell of the beer has a nice clove, banana, and wheat aroma coming off of it. The taste has the banana and wheat flavors through out the beer. I never tried this with an orange wedge but I'm sure that's pretty good too. The mouthfeel is light and creamy feeling, very drinkable summer brew. Overall I really enjoy it, I like having it on hot days or anytime for that matter."
"Overall it is a very crisp and refreshing beer but not on my top 5 heffe list that’s for sure… give it a try."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the spice. This become somewhat apparent in the nose, only to blossom forth in the flavor, and surprisingly even more so in the aftertaste. Where we lost huge points was in the mouthfeel, which was watery and rather undesirable."
"Overall: A nice, smooth, sessionable wheat ale. I do like the taste of honey in this. I will look for this again."
"Overall, I was surprised at how good this beer was. A perfect example of a good American wheat beer."
"Overall Drinkability - This is a good, light summer beer that has some flavor to it without any hop bitterness. Says Heffeweisen on bottle but the classification on here is American Pale Wheat Ale...so enjoy it for whatever its supposed to be."
"O: Not a bad beer, but not a hefe. Would I drink it if offered, absolutely! But if I was buying, I'd look for a better option before settling with this beer."
"Don't let that drive you away, though; if you didn't know what lemongrass was, and didn't know it was in the beer, you'd never suspect anything. Instead, you would assume that you were just drinking a particularly nice, light, crisp summer beer. Because this is a good beer, and well-worth trying."
"O- An easy drinking beer that is a little too grainy for me to get this again unless it was a 95 degree day and the only refreshing option, but not a bad tasting beer."
"Overall Drinkability - Good summer beer. I dig it."
"The beer pours a golden orange color with a white head. The aroma is wheat with some grain notes as well as a little bit of pepper. The flavor is heavy on the lemons, oranges and wheat with some pepper notes. Easy to drink and actually quite enjoyable. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. One of the better Magic Hat beers."
"O: Not to bad. I've had some real ho hum american hefe's and this isn't one of them. Has to do with the hop surprise at the back end that makes this one worth going to again when I need a nice refreshing summer brew."
"D ~ Hefeweiss this is not, but a low-level wheat beer. I would not seek this out. It is so disappointing that the brewery itself is calling this ""THE HEFEWEIZEN."""
"O: Solid beer overall. As far from a winter warmer as you can get, but would be absolutely amazing on a beach. Better than a couple other summery hef's I've had recently. Would buy again."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer pours a pale, hazy, flat yellow-gold coloring with a thin, white, loose bubbled head that is steady at an eighth of an inch while you drink. Aromas are a jumble of fruit sweetness, all of which are fairly watered down. Smells include lemon zest, banana, pineapple, pear, and a little bit of spicing (maybe coriander, maybe grains of paradise?). Interesting. Flavors are watered down, also, and the body is limp and lackluster, with blend of bready characteristics, lemon zest, pear, some weak spicing. The aftertaste is like drinking the juice from a fruit salad. Quick, semisweet finish, watery and weak. The beer is extremely light, and great on a hot day. Not huge on flavor, though."
"This one seems to have a pretty decent hop schedule as there is a nice bitterness to compliment the wheat tang. Soft, lemony citrus flavors up front are followed by one of the stronger wheat backbones. Finish is pretty dry and bitter. It is pretty interesting to try, a bit different than your typical wheat beer. I dont think I will be running out to grab a sixer anytime soon, but I enjoyed my single well enough."
"""Gently roused"" this pours an entirely hazed lite straw-yellow, with a *ton* of head. This settles down to a sticky ring. Nose is mineral and a lot of a specific potpourri-like spice that I can't quite place. Taste is a sour affair for a wheat ale. Lemon-grass and the aforementioned mystery spice round out the flavor. Finishes deep with some pleasant hops. Mellows out a bit too. Out-of-the-ordinary brew, but nothing spectacular."
"Sampled on July 15, 2011. This is the first time I have had a Magic Hat beer of any kind since the buyout. It pours a cloudy pale yellow with virtually no head. The aroma has a fairly good wheat quality with malt, spices and especially pepper. The body is okay and about medium. The taste also has a weak bitterness and a bit of a citrus zing."
"O: Fine example of his ilk. At least as refreshing as any other weizenheimer. This is a show you could watch all day."
"This is my favorite Hefeweizen. It is so refreshing and delicious! Perfect for summer."
"O - I like wheat beers, but this one was average for me."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a golden yellow body with a 2 inch white head that lays down to a thin lace. The smell is of wheat and lemon. The taste is citrus, mostly lemon with some wheat coming through. The mouth feel is great, easy drinker. Overall i really like this beer."
"Drinkability: It's not bad, but it's far from the best Hefe's I've had (and I drink them often). I was hoping for more from Magic Hat Brewing with this one. They should really change the label from Hefeweizen to 'Pale Wheat Ale'."
"Pours a hazy yellow, head does not last. Scent is of wheat, and wheat. not overpowering. Taste is solid, wheat comes through, just a touch of malt sweetness but tart as well. A refreshing summer lawnmower beer. Mouthfeel: just the right amount of carbonation in this brew. Overall, a solid beer, 4.0."
"I poured the 12oz bottle into a snifter glass to find a golden color body that was clear with a bit haziness. The aroma was mild with a hint of bread and grass. The taste was much better than the aroma. The flavors are more pronounced than the taste, you get the taste of bread, bananas and citrus. I enjoy the taste but doesn't pack the same punch that most wheat ales do. The beer is crisp and easy to drink, the carbination dances a bit on the pallet but it is still very enjoyable. Overall its a good beer that I really enjoy drinking in the summer."
"D- Great Hefeweizen; clean and refreshing, great summer/spring time brew; to be enjoyed within the company of friends who like something light but not a macro"
"O - Not really my prefered style of beer at all but I was throwing together a mix of brews for some recreational events over memorial day weekend and I enjoy this beer more than I had anticipate, a solid offering"
"O- This beer was somewhat lackluster at best. I think this beer through the years has changed a lot and not for the better. Although my palate could have been changed as well I don't think it has to the point of how this beer tastes now. Not a bad offering but a little bit average at best. Light flavors means I can drink this without thinking about it. Downside is it is a little watery."
"This is up there as one of my favorite hefe. Not being a fan of them in general, I still think domestically it doesn't get much better. This is a very Citrus infused beer with some good coriander notes to back the body. Not being a fan of those on a regular basis I am impressed how much I enjoy this beer every time I have it."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer but probably wouldnt buy it again. I felt that the flavor didnt have the depth I was looking for. Hefeweizens and wheat beers are some of my favorite and while this was enjoyable, the lemon was a little too much for me. But, I would recommend others to at least try it."
"wheat beers are not my thing, that being said, i would have a few of these if they were offered to me"
"I think this beer has a place in any season now matter what."
"I am a fan of unfiltered wheat ales. I like to shake up that last little bit and get some nice taste out of the left over yeast. Magic hat has pleased me with their line of beers. Circus boy poured a very cloudy lemonade color with a healthy head. The smell was like a traditional German hefe with the clove, yeast, and ripe banana notes. The taste was more citrusy with some lemon peel and almost candied lemon zest in the background. Goes down smooth with a little bite in the end. The mixed up yeast forms a nice bready texture. Good brew."
"Taste-Wheat, lemony, zesty. Very refreshing and drinkable. Quaffable and certainly sessionable (4.4ABV)on a hot summer day. Would make a nice ""entry-level"" craft brew."
"Pours pretty clear for an unfiltered wheat beer; bright golden color with a tiny layer of bubbles for a head. Light and grassy aroma, that follows through in the taste, with a bit of mild, sweet citrus. Goes down easy without the acidic bite characteristic of many other wheat beers. Thin, but fairly drinkable."
"Had this beer last night and was not over impressed. The color was cloudy (unfiltered) yellow, with floaties....I HATE FLOATIES! The aroma was decent....certainly hints of citrus. The taste was decent as well....hints of clove/spice and the taste coming from the spice was almost peppery. Mouthfeel was ok nothing to write home about. Overall....it was ok."
"Overall, this is a pretty good beer for the value. The taste isn't awesome, but the smell is quite good."
"The mouthfeel is nice enough, nothing special. A slightly heavier than light body and some heavy carbonation. The drinkability, of course, is superb. A very good pale wheat ale that I recommend."
"Medium bodied though leaning heavier. Medium effervescence. Smooth aftertaste, spice and malt linger forever. Nice stuff."
"Overall - Blah, blah, blah. I won't be buying this beer again. Ever. I expected something a little fruity (from the smell), but was disappointed with the lack of complexity. I feel that with a name like Circus Boy, this beer should have put a little more of a show. Complete with fire and acrobatics in my mouth. No dice..."
"D - Honestly, it isn't all that bad for what it is. There is just a touch of real Weizen yeast character as a nod to the beers distant origins and the wheat and malt are well balanced with the light hop character. There is nothing the least bit interesting going on here, but it isn't at all offensive either and it is really pretty drinkable, which is more than I can say for most of the other beer that I have had from this brewery."
"O - I do like this beer, and not really because it is good, but rather because it is quite gingery. *Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to take my throne, because I'm a shoo-in... for Hater-of-the-Year.*"
"O: It's quite good. I usually don't like american wheats, but this one leans enough toward a hefe to give it some depth of flavor."
"O: Overall, just kind of underwhelming."
"B (3.73)"
"O- Well if you don't let the smell of this scare you away its actually an ok hefeweizen. Nowhere near the top but its good. Much better than the standard Magic hat #9. Not worth seeking out but if this is your only option go with it."
"Circus Boy pours a murky golden yellow with pretty darn poor head retention. The color is lovely however. The aroma is muted but contains a few whiffs of lemon scent and maybe a bit of spice. Sadly these are the best parts of this ale. The flavor is pretty tame for a hefe, grainy, a bit of lemongrass flavor peaks through, I get some hits of fruity flavor from the yeast. The mouthfeel is somewhat thin. If it is hot and you're at your buddies house and he has some cold Circus Boy, sure grab it, just don't seak it out."
"Granted, I would have no problem if someone offered me one in the future, it wasn't that bad of an experience. It tasted nice, with everything that should be present in a hefe. But I just couldn't get by the sharp carbonation."
"Magic Hat Circus Boy is a cloudy, lively pale golden ale with a small head that quickly dissipates to leave a small ring that leaves decent lacing on the glass. It has an aroma of clove and pear. It smells grainy and fruity. The smooth, foamy, light body has a clean, crisp finish. It's lightly flavored and well balanced. Clove is the dominant flavor. Herbal bitterness finishes the taste up. It has qualities both of a Hefeweisen and an American wheat ale. It's very easy to drink."
"Overall, I enjoyed Circus Boy. I've had it several times in the past, and I will be the first to admit that I'm not typically a fan of wheat ales. I kept that in mind and my ratings are based on not only my prior beer experiences, but specifically my times with wheat beers."
"Not hot outside enough yet."
"Delicious and very drinkable. Fantastic session candidate. Will look for this again."
"Heavy sting from carbonation up front giving way to lemon and honey notes although there is very little sweetness, there is some bitter citrus almost hidden in the heavy carbonation. Finishes with a grainy wheat taste. An excellent light refreshing brew."
"O: Not a huge fan of the style, but can see the merits to this specific brew."
"It is however a pretty decent APWA."
"D/N - This is the best offering I have had from Magic Hat. the other beers I have had from them were sub-par. This only comes in the mixed 12 pack where I am. That sucks."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is a billowy two inches of foam that recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of lemon poppy-seed muffins, and oranges. It is an interesting aroma, but unpleasant. The taste is more subdued. There is still a lot of lemon and some orange, but it isn't as harsh as the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation, and a texture that is quite watery for the style. Overall, I will pass on this beer next time."
"Overall a good beer from the guys at Magic Hat. Pours a white 3 finger head, that fades rather quickly, golden colored body. Tastes sweet, a little spice note, no hops at all. Easy to drink, and pretty well done overall. Would have again, in fact when in the mood for a Hefeweizen, this beer comes in front."
"Overall a decent beer."
"D: Refreshing and crisp; as easy to drink as your popular American adjuncts without the watery, corn flavors; perfect for sessions"
"Drink is average. Not a bad beer tho."
"D - Very drinkable. Overall a nice and balanced sweetness and citrus flavor. The yeasty flavor might be a bit much for some, but for most part it is really nice for the most part."
"drinkability: for a wheat-style beer, it lacking in some elements, but overall it is very clean and pleasant to drink."
"D- Very smooth, creamy, and swett. Easy to drink."
"Too bad there are three of these in my sampler pack. Should have saved an extra #9 to wash this down with. Oh well, lesson learned, I suppose."
"Smells lemony with that wheat in the back. Very nice spicy bite with that dry lemon wheat husk taste. It reminded me of a more spicy Samuel Adams Coastal Wheat. That was my very first impression but this had a more full flavor which i enjoyed more so than the coastal wheat. These types of beers are perfect for a jump for people who want to try something other than the big 3. Yet they always seem to go for these wheat fruity type beers. Blue Moon, this one etc. That's fine though these are good... I'll always take these beers over the regular stuff. Simply said... Magic Hat makes some good beers that can turn a lot of people onto better beer."
"Drinkability -- Not as good as I had hoped. I'm a big fan of lemongrass, but less would've been more in this. Glad I tried it, but I wouldn't go for it again."
"This one surprised me. Really. Not really a Hefe or Belgian White fan (especially when they add citrus flavors), I assumed this would be akin to a lemon spritzer. I prefer beer that tastes like, well, beer. Looked OK in the glass (actually surprising clear for something called a Hefeweizen... maybe they need to check the definition of the German word) and the smell was pretty clean, predominantly light malted wheat with no citrus present. The initial flavor was great, somewhat clean and biscuity with a subtle lemon flavor that wasn't citrusy at all but had the character of a flavor hidden in the hops matrix... so I checked the bottle. Lemon grass. No wonder. Not really lemon at all, but a really unique (and surprisingly pleasant) flavor that enhanced the wheat. I liked this a lot and I can't wait to share it with someone I know (J) who is an American Wheat fan."
"d: very smooth and refreshing."
"D - Nice and refreshing. I think I'd enjoy it more if it wasn't winter. Well balanced, I could drink a few of these."
"D- This is a nice easy to drink beer that I feel would be great to have on a nice spring day."
"By itself however Circus Boy is a very bland beer and definetly not one that tastes looks or pours like a Hefe."
"Drinkability - Very easy to drink. I could see this being a good beer to have a hot summer day when you're looking for refreshment. Not much more other than that."
"Nice and light for a hot night, but still a good beer when you're looking for something easy to drink. One of the first beers I tell someone to buy if they ask me for a new beer to try. A nice beer for a beginner who wants to open up their options. Not my favorite by any means but still good for what it is."
"The first time I have ever tried this was on tap at a restaurant; with a name like Circus Boy I had to try it. I enjoyed it enough to want to buy a six pack of it, which I eventually did. Here I am, years later, reviewing it. I think I liked it more back then, than now. My tastes have changed in a beer but don't get me wrong, this is still good."
"I don't mean to be a downer, but this beer is so bland and off the mark of what it is advertised as that I don't know how they get away with the label. A sizebale fail for Magic Hat."
"This isn't a bad drink by any means. It is a bit watered down, compared to many other beers in the style. Its not to heavy, and does have a good citris flavor. It just seems to be lacking the complexity that you normal see in this style brew."
"D: The beer isn't difficult to drink and it's low alcohol content makes it very sessionable, although I wouldn't consider it to be very thirst-quenching."
"D - While this beer isn't amazing, I can see it being refreshing on a hot summer day and getting through a 6-pack pretty easily. Not an amazing representation of the style and the bland taste really bring this one down."
"DB- The problem here is a lack of balance. The floral and clove notes simply take over and kill the experience. As with many American takes on German styles, it feels artificial. Almost like a macro with some spice."
"Light grain, grass and lots of butter. It's certainly not a hef (no banana or clove) but with all the buttery diacetyl it's almost more of an English pale wheat. Crisp carbonation cuts through the butter."
"D- ehm overall mabye its just hitting me the wrong way but theres so many better authentic hefeweizens out there why would you waste your time with this?"
"I have long enjoyed Circus Boy and finally have gotten around to reviewing it. Poured into a Guinness pint glass. Unfiltered and unfettered as the good folks in Burlington advertise. Pour is as advertised, cloudy. Noise is of lemon-grass and citrus. I've always thought the taste and mouth-feel were ideal as an introduction to anyone interested in the Hefe style, you can (and I have) enjoy more than one Circus Boy..."
"Circus Boy pours a cloudy yellow with thin head that lasted fairly long. The aroma was banana, citrus, and pine. Well balanced. The flavor began with grapefruit followed by candy and honey notes. This beer has a pleasant citrus aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a creamy consistency but the only knock is way too much carbonation. Magic Hat Circus Boy is a quality beer, very refreshing, and very drinkable if you don't mind the carbonation. Recommended."
"Pours lemon yellow with a thin white head. Aroma is very faint, some lemon, citrus hops, and a touch of yeast, but not a whole lot. Taste is very light, the sour lemon/citrus hops come up front, and a sweet wheat malt finish wraps it up. Mouthfeel has little carbonation and almost no body, mostly a mild lemon sourness. It seems that this would be a good beer to drink alone during the summer, but it is completely overpowered by any food, as the flavor is refined, but almost as light as a macro light beer. I wouldn't drink this beer with food, or weather that isn't sunny and over 80 degrees."
"Good on the drinkability meter - pretty clean flavors, and certainly nothing offensive. Just lacks some of the rich and flavorful profiles of a good hefeweizen."
"D- Not the tastiest wheat beer, but not horrible; a decent brew overall."
"One of my favorite magic hats. Circus boy has the perfect balance of flavor and spice. The carbonation is not too strong, and the beer does not taste watery in the slightest. Overall, a great beer that does not get boring or sickening after 1 or 2. Something that you can drink and never get bored of"
"I dream of the day I can have this on tap."
"Super drinkable but will definitely catch up with you if you're not careful. Protip: I was not careful."
"Drinkability - Drinkable. But not that beery."
"Overall: Not a good example of a Hefeweizen or an American wheat. It's too bad breweries like their marketing guys name these beers. This is more like a summer seasonal. I'd actually say this beer is kind of awkward and unpleasant to drink. The phenolic elements really take away from the overall impression. I'm generally not super impressed with Magic Hat beers and this actually undershoots that impression a little. I'd pass on this one unless your a huge fan of seasonal lemony wheat beers."
"I got one in a mix and match pack. After a quarter of the beer I ended up dumping it out, which, anyone who knows me, would say is unbelievable."
"If compared to other hefeweizen's this really suffers for taste. Nothing robust, nothing really enjoyable - kind of a like a nice smooth and pleasant wheat, very drinkable. Subtle bits of banana and a lot of wheat, but not much to get excited about. Body is very light and watery, with some small carbonation."
"pours a straw yellowish color with a nice white head. Kind of looks like a Hoegarden at first glance. Very tart citrus aroma but not overwhelming rather subtle in the smell. Taste is very nice with well balanced lemon grass and other citrus flavors. Goes down very smooth with a crisp refreshing taste lingering on the palate. Very easy to drink."
"M, D- Drain pour."
"pours a cloudy orange color with spare head, spare lacing and lively carbonation. Sweet grainy malts, and hints of lemon and citrus. slight fizzy taste. light body and short flavor duration. finishes fairly tart. all around average beer, nothing too impressive at all."
"great drinkablity this beer is refreshing and smooth"
"D-ill have one here and there on acount my girl loves them. it gets points for maken her happy"
"D- You know what, its really drinkable...not a lot of alcoholic bite to it, but it has a flavor you can't get from the usual domestic fare. If its not absurdly priced above any of them, its a nice pickup for a summer BBQ"
"M: Light and smooth"
"This beer is one of my favorites. The cap read, ""A good mind is a horrible thing to baste"". It pours an yellow ""hay"" like flavor with a almost thick head that disappears pretty quickly but leaves a white lacing as you drink. The flavor is very light and citrus-y. This is a beer that is best enjoyed on a spring/summer evening (although it tastes good year round). Garnish the beer with a lemon to enhance the citrus taste. In addition, it's best to pour this beer into a glass while pausing half way through pouring to swirl the rest of the bottle's contents."
"D - Nothing too big about this - could have a couple. One of my preferred Magic Hat brews. It isn't over the top and not too convoluted for the style - a habit the brewery tends to dabble in a little too much for me. Overall, a solid work."
"I must first note that I'm not a fan of wheats and this beer is very wheaty that said. An overwhelming wheat smell with a thick white head and cloudy pale yellow color. It has slightly spiciness that's not overwhelming. The beer starts sweet with a lot of carbonation and sweetness, and finishes spicy."
"Taste and mouthfeel are average, but they get a ""good"" from me because i think the ensemble is a decent, above average beer. very full-bodied inclined rather to their german weizen predecessors, although a bit drier to the palate. not too sweet, not full of bananas or cloves or bubble gum. simply dry-wheaty, sort of like a field somewhere in america. sunny and full bodied, refreshing still tough enough to drink during winter. good."
"Overall - Could drink this all day"
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer that could be tasted throughout the day/night. The bottle purports to be a hefeweizen, but it seems to be quite different than your run of the mill. Nice take by the Magic Hat Brewing Company."
"D: Very refreshing and easy drinking. Not a ton of flavor but easy to drink. Session beer definitely!"
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a medium white head that leaves a little lacing. Aroma is of wheat and bread, with citrus notes (lemon) beneath it. Taste is slightly sour from the lemon, with a bitter metallic taste that follows into the finish. Pretty carbonated, which leaves a fizzy mouthfeel. Overall I am not too impressed."
"D- drinkable beer, goes down smooth and easy, but not the best tasting. I had higher expectations, I'd take a sam adams hefe over this one"
"This was a suggestion from my son (one of his favorites from college). I have to admit that this is a good hefe. It has a bit of an acidic note to it, but it isn't bitter. I would imagine that it would be a very good thirst quenching beer on a hot summer day."
"Pours a slightly cloudy yellow color with a thin white head momentarily. Doesn't have much retension and laces just a bit on the glass where the head previously resided. Both the aroma and taste are full of lemon...and rightfully so since the label states it is brewed with lemongrass. Up front it is a little sweet and it finishes quite crisp, you can pick up on a slight bit of citrus (other than lemon) in the finish as well. High amount of carb and thin, light feel which is expected for the style. I am a little bummed out that there isn't any banana or clove character in either the nose or the taste but it still fits the bill. Not bad overall but I am content with just trying this once, there are others I prefer but it was worth the experience for the lemongrass addition."
"for me this is another good beer from the people at magic hat."
"Pours a clear, golden color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of yeast, wheat, slight orange, and some grain. Fits the style of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of citrus, yeast, tart malt, and slight metallic. Overall, high carbonation level hurts drinkability as does the metallic sharpness."
"All-in-all a very average hefe from Magic Hat."
"D: Decent drinkability and could be a session beer in the summer months. The problem is that the mouthfeel is so creamy, that it could become irritating after the third or fourth in a row. Otherwise, it's a pretty good option for a wheat beer."
"A solid drinkale beer that would be welcome on a hot day. Crispy carbonated and all around pretty good."
"Magic Hat has classified this beer as a hefeweizen and if that's the case this is off the mark quite a bit. It's still a drinkable beer, nothing spectacular, but if you're looking for a beer of this style, this is clearly not it."
"Part of a variety 12 pack that one of my brother in laws buddies brought over while we were helping them move. Out of a 12 ounce bottle and into a tumbler. Appears a cloudy pale yellow color with about two fingers of bone white foam. Nose and flavors are of tangy lemon, toasted wheat, yeasty, bready, more citrus, mildly spicy. Medium bodied with ample carbonation levels and a somewhat sweet finish. My least favorite out of the 12 pack."
"M - Well carbonated, goes down smooth. Could spend an evening with a six pack of circus boy."
"This is a very drinkable beer, almost too drinkable on a sunny day. This is one of my favorite of the limited Magic Hat beers i've had."
"Flavor is pretty bland and again has hints of lemon zest, citrus lemon peel, pepper, biscuit subtle hops and a sweet dry finish. This beer was mediocre in every aspect and I would avoid it in the future."
"Notes: When I took the first whiff something seemed a little strange, and that still holds true, its interesting because it is definitely a little different than a typical wheat beer or hefeweizen, but they didn't quite nail this one for me. The taste is good, but not great. Overall a solid above average beer, but nothing to write home about."
"This beer is a moderately hazy dark straw color with a slight head. The aroma is faint and pretty neutral--some wheat malt is all it has going for it. The taste is more interesting though, with whatever yeast used producing a lot of fruitiness, together with a pleasant tartness that makes it very refreshing. The finish is tart and lightly sour."
"D - Good flavor and low ABV makes this a very sessionable ale. Definitley a summer beer."
"This is really easy to drink, probably due to its ABV and Summery vibe, but this is not ""The Hefeweizen"" that the bottle claims it to be and those seeking such a thing should definitely look elsewhere."
"Poured from a brown 12oz. bottle. Has a cloudy, light brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of citrus and spices. Taste is lemony, some grains and spices. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good selection."
"A nice looking beer with its cloudy golden color and large white head. Some lacing is left on the glass as the head recedes and the beer is consumed. Unfortunately the aroma and flavor are not what I look for in a Hefeweizen or Wheat Ale. The lemongrass is too prominant and the typical wheat beer qualities are suppressed. Feels nice while drinking because of a soft texture. The body is light without being watery. The flavor is not my thing so I will not be buying this beer again."
"Perfect for a summer's afternoon"
"Overall: It no longer is listed as a hefeweizen and within its newfound 'pale wheat' it is par for the course. Purists may not enjoy the added citrus but it is put together in a rather balanced matter."
"Pretty hazy dark golden color. Small white head takes off pretty quickly. Very nice wheat beer smell, lots of banana and clove. Nice wheat malt, lots of the nice ancillary wheat beer tastes, banana and clove. A bit acidic on the tongue but pretty creamy overall in the mouth. Very refreshing drink, i like it"
"Circus Boy is Magic Hat's Hefeweizen. It has a deep golden color with a hint of amber. The head is fizzy and subsides quickly. The aroma is very plain. Mostly just boiled hops. No straw, hay, or bread. It's definitely a sweet brew. It starts sweet and the honey-ish flavor stays on the edges of the tongue. From the mid to the back there is a bit of coriander and spice. But the flavor stops about there. Just like the aroma, this hefe is missing the core components. No earthiness. No breadiness. No citrus. And too sweet for what it's trying to be. The positive is that it is very easy to drink. But that's about all I can say about it. Magic Hat has much much better stuff. This is disappointing."
"Overall: Good summer or gameday drinkable beer."
"Funny how when I bought the Magic Hat pack, I liked this best, and thought the Odd Notion was a bomb. I wonder if the scores are relatively poor because the bottle says ""the hefeweizen"" and people really have a stick up their butt when it comes to what is and isn't one. This style is populated with APAs made with wheat, and what are more or less American-style hefeweizens. Of the latter, this is of the better ones. Certainly a breeze to drink."
"Also this beer is 4.4% abv NOT 5.5% and it should be called a hefeweizen not an American pale wheat ale"
"D= decent. This beer confused and intrigued me. I'm not sure what style to judge it on. It says hefe but here it says pale wheat. I think it falls more into the pale wheat area but either way its pretty enjoyable with my dog on a hot late summer day."
"D: Drinkable, but there are definitely better options out there. Wont be seeking again."
"Rotation: one and done - better out there. Maybe on tap if down to this and BMC."
"Pours a hazy yellow with a big, frothy, inch head. Smells pretty bad actually, like a mix of bad yeast and acetaldehyde. Taste is average, with just a hint of lemon, no spice is anywhere to be found in this one. Smooth, refreshing, good for a summer day as a substitute for a pale ale."
"D: I wasn't too impressed. A little too filling for my taste."
"Awesome summer beer for a hot day."
"D - Due to the citrus, a very refreshing beer. I could definitely down a couple of these on a summer afternoon."
"D- not a bad Hef. nice beer to have in the cooler for the summertime."
"Firstly, I do not normally like Hefewiesens, but I have found Circus Boy to have the right amount of citrus to be refreshing but not overpowering. I like many other unfiltered wheat beers and buy this one on a regular basis. I've noticed it has hints of banana when coming out of the tap, but is much fresher out of a bottle."
"Magic Hat seems to be moving towards capturing the craft beer entry-level market, which isn't overly glamorous to veteran BAs but is probably important to the long term health of craft beer nonetheless."
"Mouthfeel is OK I guess but this one is def. not my fav Magic Hat."
"d- pretty great, nice offering from magic hat, i'd drink again."
"Various hues within the glass ranging from goldenrod to carmel. Frothy lace and decent head. Many rising bubles to the top of the glass. Smells very fresh, with aromas of citrus and wheat. The taste is very refreshing and crisp. Tastes wheaty and somewaht yeasty with a citrus tinge. The mouthfeel is somewhat above average. I feel this is a quality heff and would drink this again."
"Last year I was buying these regularly, extolling their virtues to friends. Oh how my palate has changed..."
"D: Nice light summer beer with just enough flavor."
"Don't drink and review."
"D - This beer has an awkward combination of flavors that never seems to sit quite right in my mouth. The yeast and wheat-malt seem to be conflicting with the lemongrass, leaving a weird bitter sensation, although maybe i'm just not a fan of the style. Got this beer in the Magic hat spring variety pack, and I would not get it again. Sorry Magic hat, your beers are a little too off the wall for me."
"I found this beer to be quite enjoyable and I would recommend it to others but it would not be on my list of top unfiltered wheat beers."
"This and Feast of Fools are two of this brands better beers in my opinion. The body is a hazy golden color with an average amount of carbonation. The average frothy head leads to some nice lacing. It has pasture and fruit aroma. The tones of grains, lemon and banana are somewhat strong for an American wheat beer. The body is moderately thick with great carbonation. It is very refreshing."
"D- I would drink this all day long easily and with such a low alcohol content I think I could (it actually says 4.4% on the bottle)."
"This beer gets high marks for drinkability and for taste, simply because I feel it's a good representation of style and goes down easy. Very sessionable."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a nice one finger head that gives way to a slight lacing. There is sediement in the bottle and it has a nice unfiltered look to it. The aroma is of wheat with a slight lemon and banana smell to it. The taste is of wheat with a hint of lemon and a hint of grassyness. The mouthfeel is smooth and with out carbonation. The drinkability on this is good. You can have it over and over again. Its not complex as other hef's but it is a solid beer."
"A lot about this beer is sort of a standard hefe.. certainly better than any macro garbage but middle of the road as far as hefe's go. What sets it a bit apart is the lemongrass.. The citrus character that is contributed to the beer is really a great addition. The use of lemongrass, specifically, as opposed to just lemon juice or some otehr straight forward fruit citrus also contributes an interesting character to the flavor with a floral sort of presence that in a way is reminiscent of hops but slightly different. Other than that the other thing to note would be a very good drinkability. the light mouthfeel and body give it an airy, refreshing quality that makes drinking several quite easy. It also pairs nicely with a variety of fodos it seems."
"Smell was of bread, caramel, slight bananas. Taste was similar. Pronounced caramel overall tone with little else for me, not much of the usual hefe flavor I'm used to. Very muted and light. Mouthfeel was average. Drinkability was good, easy to put it down due to the mild flavor, but when out shopping for Hefe's in better stores I would probably pass on this one."
"I wouldn't want to drink these all of the time, but they are drinkable enough to session a few."
"Drinkability: Like all wheat beers crisp and refreshing always good cold. One of the better offerings by magic hat. While you could still have a few. A decent example of the style, though a bit light on flavor and offers little spice."
"D: Pretty drinkable brew especially during the summer. It just really doesn't leave me asking for more which is the problem."
"Overall, an ok brew but nothing special. I won't go out of my way to buy it again but wouldn't turn one away, either. By the way... the bottle says this is a hefe but it does taste more like a pale wheat."
"D- Although this is nothing special, I think this is an easy drinker for hot days, when they happen. For $9.95 for a growler, I can't complain."
"Overall while being quite the sessionable beer, the lack of depth and strong, pronounced profile leave it a tick above average. Still though, this would not be bad at all in a pinch."
"High carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Not bad. Could easily drink a few on a hot day but would rather have something with a bit more flavor."
"Mouthfeel is light and nicely carbonated, an easy drinker, just not much there. Look for their others, not this one."
"Another refreshing hefe? I could definitely see myself drinking this on a warm summer day and loving every minute of it!"
"D..Easy enough to drink; reminiscent of summer months and sunshine. Smooth going down. If these tasted a little better/stronger, I would enjoy a six pack more often."
"Very yellow, with chill haze. It has a very subdued smell, and all I get from it is a small hint of lemon zest. Light taste, but has a great spice hint half way through. Lemony and malty, and a good example of the style. Sweet, and goes down with a hefe dryness. Very drinkable and light. However, i dont like its low alcohol content. I dont like wheat beers, but if you like the style, this is an absolute treasure. Much better than other wheat beers i have tried, and blows Hoegaarden out of the water."
"D: This is a great summer beer and quite sessionable. Could drink several of these on a relaxing, sunny, Saturday afternoon."
"Drinkability: A very mild and approachable beer. Not as much banana and clove as many German hefeweizens, but still flavorful. Reminds me of a yarrow ale I brewed once on a whim, but a much milder version."
"D - This beer is ok, but doesn't really do it for me, especially when there are Hefeweizens that I like more."
"Though the bottle says ""The Hefeweizen!", it's not that at all. As an American wheat though, it's off the charts. An interesting take on a usually insipid style. Not a perfect beer by a long shot, but I doubt I could turn one of these down."
"Drink is average I wouldn't choose this one for a session brew. A little to spicy and sweet but good for a nice summer day."
"slightly above average, just wish it had a bit more flavor"
"This one's very drinkable and worth having a few at a time."
"Yellowish in color with a white, watery looking head. Aroma was earthy/musty. This did not taste like a hefe.. The lemongrass dominated and I didn't taste any banana or clove. The mouthfeel was the best part about the beer."
"The mouthfeel is light and bubbly real nice and crisp to just a joy to drink and easy to session got it in the variety pack and thinking of getting it on its own."
"M/D- Clean crisp taste. A touch on the mild side from those that I prefer but made me wish for warm weather. It was a clean finish on the taste buds and has a fuity pop as it went down."
"the beer overall is not bad...a miss named product is the biggest thing here...american wheat might be better as this site calls it...might be a good convert for people as other magic hat products are"
"Circus Boy is disappointing. It ultimately suffers mightily from a lack of range and flavor. While I do agree that it is an American Pale Wheat, it's not a very good example. There's a ton of much more attractive releases out there. At the end of the day, it's okay. Worth a try. But, not more than that."
"Not impressed by this ""Hefeweizen"" at all. I know it's listed as APWA on here, but even for that style it's pretty lame. My first beer from this brewery, and I can't say I'm excited to try more, though I do have a Winter 08 Odd Notion."
"Seems spot on for the pale american wheat ale. Light and husky malt; not overly spicy or yeasty like the european wheat beers."
"D - good anytime of the year but would be great in the heat of summer sitting by the pool or watching a baseball game"
"Overall - It doesn't scream 'hefeweizen' but it's still a nice little wheat ale. Flavorful but not overpowering; could definitely become a fridge staple."
"Pilsnery golen straw with a littl haze as well. Nice two finger head that rises to the top of my pint glass. Recedes to nothing pretty quick though. Why did they filter this beer?? Lemongrass herbal aroma with some hay malts and some adjunct funk. Starts with some funky, oily yeast. Then the lemongrass mixed ith some pilsnery malt and a tart fruity yeast. The finish is sunshiney, tart, ad still adjuncty.The palate is tart and a bit thin. Could be refreshing, but has some weird flavor mixing together."
"A hefewiezen on the bottle name only. There are much better versions out there. Similar to other beers I've had from MHBC, interesting to taste once, not one I'd come back to."
"The Circus Boy Hefe had a beautiful golden appearance with a baseball card bubblegum aroma. This hefe had a very subtle spicy, cardamom flavor of which I like more of in my hefe's. The mouthfeel was thickish and overcarbonated. I've had better hefeweizens before."
"I bought this beer in a small hamlet in the Catskill mountains.I found the beer to be an average Hefeweizen, not alot of banana or clove in the nose, alot of head from the bottle to a pint glass. The lacing was moderate, the body was cloudy to murky the color was a yellow with some green undertones. I noticed alot of hay, or just mowed grass scent with the hops used in this Hefe. The brewer mentions the beer was brewed with lemongrass, I found the carbonation to be subtle yet refreshing. I could definately drink a few of these on a warm summer day.This beer left my mouth with a sharp, slightly sour aftertaste."
"D - Not quite what I expect from this style of beer. Still, it's clean and perhaps some of the deficiencies are a function of it's age - this beer is about 5 months past its ""best-by"" date. Would like to try and fresher bottle and re-evaluate."
"Nikki"
"Overall, this is a drinkable beer that is refreshing. It certainly isn't going to be first on my list when the craving for a hefe arrives. At the same time, however, it is an enjoyable beer that could easily find its way into my refrigerator. This would be a good warm-weather session beer, most certainly. I don't relegate it to ""lawnmower beer"" status, but I could easily be convinced to quench a summer's thirst with one."
"Drinkability: Clean finish and bright citrus make this a perfect summer session beer (""lawnmower beer"") although don't expect the spiciness of a German hef."
"D: About as drinkable as a normal pub wheat ale is drinkable."
"D - Would be easy enough to drink, but not much of a beer."
"D - Maybe not classic, but not bad. The lemongrass makes sense in this beer, and and I assume would be the reason why this beer seems to have a little more spice and sharpness in flavor than I'm used to in American Style Wheats. It's a shame that Magic Hat is pulling back the reigns on this product a bit, and focusing on Pyramid's Hefe, because I much prefer this beer. Solid session style, with a lot more charater than most of it's contemporaries."
"D: I would probably rank this somewhere toward the middle of the pack for this style. While I find this beer to be good, not great, I have a feeling that some people who prefer that lemon character will think this superb. I wouldn't turn it down if offered, but I probably won't be seeking it out either."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and delicious. I could easily have a few without overwhelming my senses."
"Pours a shining golden yellow with a big rocky white head, medium clarity and lots of carbonation. Aroma is metallic and of dried leaves, not a lot of banana but with a very light vanilla or licoricey spice to it. Flavor is a little weak but clean, with a lot of ""neutral"" wheat flavor along with some metal, astringency. Medium mouthfeel, not a real pleasure to drink. This wasn't really a winner for me."
"Very thin head but so bubbly it constantly renews itself. Perfectly clear yellow-brown golden color, light enough to not change along the rims. Full nostril presence, semi-oily feel with resin, tea leaf, wet shredded wheat and a pinch of lemon to orange peel, for its weight the scents lack staying power. Very similar in the mouth, a lot of sheer weight and heft with the flavors attempting to conjure up freshness while instead coming across as hollow. Malts lend more smoothness across the palate than direct flavor. Not intensely wheaty, more a mix of grains and grasses devoid of bitter bite. Moderate dose of lemon citrus. The carbonation is strong, however, unable to create a cleansing sensation at the end. Hence, falls forward awkwardly towards the finish line. Needs more focus and purpose."
"D - Great drinkability, I would love another."
"Eric"
"I really kind of hated this beer the first time I had it, but I don't think I was giving it a fair chance. I actually appreciated the beer a lot more on the second go. Not what a hefe normally tastes like, with all the veggie taste it has, but a decent beer."
"Drnkabilty: Yes... it's fine. Just don't be expecting a hefeweizen.... even though the label states that this beer is ""THE HEFEWEIZEN"". It is a decent beer... and you could probably knock back a few of these in a sitting without any adverse effects..."
"Pours with a large thick yellow white head. Very bubbly. Hazy pale straw color. Aromatic, lemony, grassy with some coriander. Starts slightly watery but sweet and lemony, grapefruity. Medium body, almost chewy. Flavors are more developed towards the end. Overall light and refreshing."
"I think this is more of a summer cookout beer that actually does better straight from a bottle. Into a glass it underwhelms. Now I'm curious if the same will apply to the rest of the Magic Hats - I've tasted a bunch of them in the past but only recall having MH #9 in a glass."
"D- Good. Probably OK for mowing the lawn on a hot day."
"Edit - I see this is listed as an American Pale Wheat Ale on heere which makes more sense, though the bottle says ""The Hefeweizen""."
"Overall-the beer was made alright but for me it felt unfinished and had a flavor that was really not good. I didn't enjoy and will not seek out again."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Smelled of lemon with a wheat note behind it. Taste was surprisingly average. I guess I was expecting more. Mouthfeel was thin and light with a high effervescence. The drinkability was good and would be a good choice if you're looking for an average wheat to down on a hot summer day."
"Thin mouthfeel, but it allows this to be more of the thirst quenching type of beer, I think on a hot summer day, I could have several of these, but not in the winter seasonal pack (these will be the last of the group for me). Overall, an average effort."
"D - This is a pretty light beer both in body and taste. I could down a few on a hot day and be refreshed, but it's not really something to be savored for it's complexity."
"One of my favorite beers so far."
"Pours cloudy yellow with a thin, dissipating head. There's a good aroma of citrus and spice. The flavor is bland, particularly at first. The blend of citrus and spices comes out much more as it warms. Light bodied with lively carbonation,a pretty good wheat beer."
"Pours pale, pale yellow with a big head. Strong zesty, lemony aroma. Hard bite in the intial hit, with a bitter citrus finish. The citrus bite hit right away, but the taste does not linger. Mouthfeel is about right, maybe just a tad heavy. I know this is a Magic Hat staple, but am not sure why it should be in a winter seasonal mixed 12 pack."
"D; A nice combination of mouthfeel and taste that was excellent for the style. Definitely a nice drinking beer that would be very welcome on a warm, summer day."
"Drinkability - Very good beer. A little less carbonation and I would rate it a little higher."
"I think I'd enjoy this more on a hot summers day, but a solid beer nonetheless."
"Overall- Overall a good beer. This is something that would be nice to drink on a hot day. Magic Hat doesn't distribute to LA though so oh well."
"Purchased as part of the 12 beers of Xmas 12-pack. Best by March 2008 notched on the bottle. Served in my MH Circus Boy glass. Poured a hazy honey gold with a one inch tight, bright white head that reduced its volume in under a minute. Nose was skunky, followed by lemon and wheat. Bland flavor profile; biscuity, wheat and a slight citrus astringency. Mouthfeel was light and effervescent with a clean finish. Goes down easy, but a fairly weak performance for the style."
"had this on draft at my house. the pour was like a typical hefe with some head and some floaties at the bottom. yellowish cloudy in color with the aroma of an orange slightly. would be served in a hefe glass. had this in august. i could see drinking many of them in the long summer days here in pa."
"Overall, a solid effort. Very easy drinking."
"D-Very good summer and warm weather beer...nothing exceptional here, but then again, I am not a big fan of MH in general."
"Summary: I would buy his beer again but not if looking for a hefeweizen. Lookikng forward to other beers from Magic Hat."
"Drinkability: This is easily Magic Hat's more boring beer to date, although I can't say I hate it, it is still a good beer and deserves recognition, just not a full fledged winner like some other MH creations. Lacks too many characteristics to be a true Hefe, but again it's refreshing so it would go pretty well on a hot summmer day. Just a tad bland for my taste."
"First of all, I've never been drawn to Magic Hat. I hear that they're good; I just can't stand their artwork and marketing. Ok, bad reason, I know...So, a nice little reaturant-pub had it on draught, and since I had never tried it (& because it was not listed as a Magic Hat offering), I ordered it with my onion rings (which were grand). The serving was in a Duvel-meets-margarita glass and had no head, just some bubbles popping up through a sickly yellow appearance. The aroma was weak and smelled like syrupy lemon grass. The flavor was flat, and far too sweet with just the slightest wheat flavor and just a concept of hops in it. Bleh! Better than a Corona...."
"Hefeweizen? Are you sure, Magic Hat? Pours clear yellow, no floral scent whatsoever, just that of mellow hops and some malt. Tastes nothing like a true german hefe, and not all that good on its own. I would definitely stay away from this one."
"Pours a light golden with very little haze and very little head. Smells quite graint and with just a hint of lemon and coriander toward the end. Definitely no banana in this one. The taste is also super light with primarily a washed out grain taste and no hint of the coriander, although there is the slightest hint of lemon on the finish. There is also the tiniest bit of spice in both the taste and mouthfeel. Really light, even for the style, but pleasant enough if undistinguished."
"Bottle in trade from ROBORB. Thanks! Pours a cloudy, thick and bright yellowish orange color with a nice white head. Smell is wheaty predominantly followed by a touch of yeast and lemon, but little in the way of spiced characteristic as from a hef yeast. Taste is very strongly wheaty and cracker like with some enjoyable honey sweetness to it. Some light lemony flavors but the sweet wheat flavors linger and dominate. Medium bodied with normal carbonation. Not really a true hefeweizen flavor wise, I would say, but I really enjoy this as an easy drinker. Thanks for this one!"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle and served in a weizen glass. This beer poured an almost clear golden with a one-finger thick head of off-white foam that slightly lasted. Some light lacing was left behind. Didn't look like a hefe. The aroma consisted of wheat and a solid dose of lemon. Didn't really smell like a hefe. Very mild aroma. The flavor included a very tart lemony note and some faint wheat. No esthers or yeast notes. Didn't taste like a hefe. The mouthfeel was light-bodied and had moderate carbonation. Bland. Please stop calling your average American wheat a hefeweizen."
"The bottle says it's ""unfiltered and unfettered."" Judging by its look, texture, and taste, I'd have to disagree with that but hey - it's not like it's bad. This just proves the age old adage: ""you can't judge a book by its cover."" Again - it definately tastes better than it looks. Try it for a slight variation on a good style."
"A very nice crisp refreshing beer. As far as drinkability goes, this one ranks high with me. It's just a nice crisp and clean beer that is just nice to drink. Nothing over the top."
"So this is a highly marketable beer and MH gets some props whether you agree or disagree with their style. I just wish that this one had a bit more character. A little more yeast in the bottle, higher fermentation temp maybe?, something. Just give me some more flavor and I'll be happy, and I'd be willing to bet the masses would be OK with that too."
"As soon as I started pouring the brew I got an instant whiff of lemon (brewed with organic lemongrass) First taste was lemon followed by a smooth wheaty taste. I think the lemon might be little too strong and the brew could be a little more well rounded. But it's not overpowering yah dig? Overalll still one of my favorite american-hefe"
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into an SA pint glass. Pours a hazy pale yellow with a monstrous head. The smell is uneventfull, a hint of spice. The taste is a bit lemony with a lingering sweet finish. A bit different from other Pale wheat beers in that it is not overspiced. The beer is light bodied, nice carbonation and very drinkable. Overall a decent wheat beer, a bit suprised on the lack of clove and bannana-but that may be a good thing."
"My first experience with this beer was at bonnaroo 08 and in 90 degree heat needless to say I put a ton of these away and was a perfect fit"
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable. Not real sure why it's in a winter mixpack- seems more like something more suited for summer, but pretty good nonetheless. Nothing spectacular to be found here, but still a worthy brew."
"Cheers!!"
"Crisp and citrus laden...great thirst quencher....I'd drink this again...it has some depth between the spicy wheat and the juicy citrus..."
"Water and smooth feel. Sits on the tongue. A bit dull. A good summery drink. Slight but pleasant. Tastes just fine."
"Pours an off-yellow with a lacy two-finger head. Smells like musty, almost dank lemons. Most definitely a better visual than smell. Tastes biscuity, with a bit of lemon ""zest"" in the finish. The body seems pretty watery, there really isn't a while lot behind it. Solid mouthfeel, the cloying aftertaste is the best part of the beer for me, if you can get past the initial smell-taste. It's crisp and well-carbonated, making it an easy drink. I just don't know if I would want to have another one."
"if this beer had mystical properties, or cured cancer i would recommend it... maybe even if it lowered sperm count as mountain dew is supposed to... as it stands however in all good conscience i heartily do not... i also advise against scratching your ears with your elbows and conversing with the mentally insane for more than 3 minutes per day"
"Pours a clear golden with a thick, fluffy white head. The head and lacing are very interesting as it kind of sparkles--somewhat like soap bubbles. Smell is not real conspicuous--wheat with citrus and some yeast and faint hops. Taste is mainly wheat, lemon, and coriander/orange. Mouthfeel is very crisp. This is one of the most refreshing beers I've had, and I don't think it affects the flavor too much to serve it very cold."
"Smooth and effervescent, Circus Boy strikes a nice balance between smooth, taste Hefe and a malty ale. Like many offerings from Magic Hat, this is unusual to the point of being somewhat eccentric, but in a good way. Admittedly, hefeweizen is not my favorite style; it's not that I don't like it. Rather, it doesn't grab me to nearly the same degree as BSDA, Dubbel--really all Belgians--Barleywine, and DIPA. That said, Circus Boy is a good find and well worth trying, and I'm quite glad I grabbed the 12-pack with #9 and more. Quite good."
"Drinkability: There are only a handful of American Pale Wheats really worth the time. This isn't one of them. If I hadn't gotten it out of a multi-beer pack I wouldn't have bothered with it at all. It's not unpleasant, and it goes down cleanly enough, but overall it's just not a beer I can feel strongly about. It's less objectionable than plenty of other APW's, for sure, but I won't be buying it again."
"D - I love this beer from Magic Hat...it was my first one and it will always be a favorite of mine"
"Hazy yellow orange. Thin dirty white head. Staying power is good. Lacing is moderate. Aroma is wheat, yeast and bright lemon zest. Flavor is pretty mundane. There's some citrus and lemon. Not a lot of yeast character. ( The bottle label claims ""Hefeweizen"" so I'd expect some yeastiness.) Some spicy wheat malt is noticeable. Carbonation is fairly high, which is to be expected. Good palate cleansing properties. Medium bodied. Decent enough, but nothing I'd need to return to. Even in the summer."
"Pretty drinkable beer, much better than I anticipated."
"Taste is very crisp with a light wheat malt. Not a ton of flavor but what is there is pleasant. Quaffable, check. Tasty, check. A great easy drinking beer."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite style, nor my favorite interpretation of the style. It's not terrible, and it's pretty inoffensive, actually, but I wouldn't reach for this one often."
"Hazy straw color with a fluffy white head. Mildly pleasant grassy lemon aroma. Slightly tart wheat flavor with notes of light grains and lemongrass. Light to medium bodied with prickly carbonation and more lemony tart wheat notes on the finish. This aint bad, but this aint hefeweizen like the bottle says. I would say it is rather pleasant. Enjoy between 11am and 4pm, or any evening over 70 degrees farenheit."
"Notes: Listed on the board at Bier Markt simply as ""Circus Boy"" which intrigued me (what could it be...some wild brew...) but it turned out to taste very pedestrian. I admit that I am not a big fan of wheat beers but I have had better Wheat Ales."
"This beer smells great and tastes like mostly-nothing. The aromas are all huge wheat and citrus fruit, nice sweetness. Then the flavor comes through as mild graininess and wheat, almost entirely overrun by the too-strong carbonation. A disappointment."
"although not terrible i would find another hefe-Weizen!"
"This is one of the better Hefe's Ive had. Definitely an odd take on one, which doesn't surprise me at all considering this is Magic Hat we're talking about. Some nice banana and clove aromas and taste but the drinkability is superb, which is the most important thing. Would definitely have this again."
"FYI: Magic Hat's website is really cool. Go check it out."
"Off the tap this beer poured a cloudy golden orange. Visible carbonation rising and visible wheat residue. Fizzy, white head one finger thick dissipated quickly but did leave some broken lacing. Aromas of sweet malts, some citrus and green grass. The flavors were clearly wheat at first with hints of banana and some hoppy zest. The malt is coarse tasting and balances nicely. The mouthfeel is quite fizzy and I do think it's over-carbonated but it also helps to 'fill in' this otherwise light bodied beer. The first time I tried this it beer I was not very impressed but after a more thorough evaluation I have to admit this is a very good Hefeweizen."
"Drinkability: Not what I was expecting at first. I expected more banana and a cloudier/ yeast pour, due to the label calling for a hefe. Reviewed as APWA as named above and in this offering it is a nice change. And accounts for the clarity and slightly hight carbonation."
"This is a beer that would deter me from drinking this style if it was the first one I ever had. It doesn't even come close to a real Hefe. I had a limited selection at the store and I went with this...more than disappointed. I truly would of rather had just about anything than this. It truly is a poor representation of the style."
"Average APWA, nothing bad but nothing to distinguish it. After a summer choked with wheat beers I don't think I can make space for this one, but as long as it shows up in variety packs I'll drink it."
"there is also virtually no banana or clove type flavoring as well, which is what makes hefeweizens so damn good. instead there's an almost soap like flavor that makes me want to never try this beer again. honestly, my only guess is that this batch wasn't done properly, or the reviewers that gave it a much higher rating had an entirely different beer than me."
"I got this from their Summer variety 12 pack. Hazy, murky, tanish color with a pretty thick off-white head and quite a bit of lacing left on the glass. I'm actually not sure if that's the beer, or the fact that this may have shifted. The aroma isn't the greatest, it smells like some sort of mild chemical. The flavor is a bit better but I've got to warn you, if you don't like a lemon zing then you're not going to like this. Mostly lemon with this odd mild cleaning formula taste mixed in and in case you were wondering, that's a bad thing. I ended up with one of the three bottles from this mixed pack sitting for a long long time because I never felt like drinking it and that's also not a good thing."
"D: Easily drinkable, this is a good choice for a summer picnic or that back to college barbecue."
"You get a little bite on the first few sips which could be mistaken for a hoppy bitterness, but you soon realize it's just the carbonation. Highly drinkable session beer. Great summer pick Magic Hat!"
"Drinkability 4.0 This is a very light and easy to drink beer that I could make lawnmower beer in the summer."
"Drinkability: Somewhat acceptable for a light, summertime beer, but the lack of flavor leaves me underwhelmed and the never-ending carbonation leaves me feeling like I've downed an entire six-pack, so I doubt I'll be hanging out again with C-Boy anytime soon."
"A cloudy yellow tan color with a thin white cover that spreads down to the sides and leaves a nice carpet of lacing. The aroma suggests a sweet lemon biscuit and classic wheat, nice if not fairly standard for the style. The first impression I get is from the active, fine carbonation that livelys up the tongue immediately and then settles to a light but fulfilling citrus and wheat medley. It's very refreshing and worthy of multi pint fulls, no problem. A bit aqueous but nothing so unusual for this style. These can go down fast. Not too much aftertaste, just a bit of rye bread perhaps. Seems a bit better here than in the bottle as one would expect."
"Poured into a hefe glass and received a see thru light gold with a quickly receeding one-finger head that died quickly. A very good citric note smell as orange and lemon zest, along with touches clove and yeast, hit my nose cleanly. Smooth, medium-boided, this brew contained a crisp, almost sharp backbite from hops and some pepper. The body contains a good citric taste and is slightly sweet from wheat/yeasy. I found this to be slightly different from most summer beers but still enjoyable."
"D: Although I could really use more in the smell and taste categories, the mouth feel and appearance really add to the appeal of this beer. Definitely great for a summer brew and I am stoked that ATL is finally getting this and other Magic Hat brews back home."
"Recommend it if you can get a hold of it, but don't go out of your way."
"Refreshing."
"I never got why people rave about this brewery. Sort of been let down with stuff I've have tried of thiers. Not very good Hefe at all. Left a filmy feeling on my tongue and did not get any of that classic hefe refrshment. The commercial note says it is a vegetable beer, which makes more sense cause at times I felt like I was drinking stewed zuccini."
"Someone brought a mixed Magic Hat pack to a family picnic and I got some of the extras. Thanks."
"D: A solid American Pale Wheat, a decent summer brew. I would like to try this on tap."
"M/D: Crisp, carbonation is a bit prickly, light bodied. Decent drinkability. Bottle says this is a hefeweizen. Hopefully Magic Hat will take the cue from BA and reclassify this, because it fails big time as a hefeweizen. As a pale wheat ale, it isn't bad, better tasting then their other offering Hocus Pocus."
"Looks nice and hazy in the glass, but the head, which is fairly puffy at first, collapses rather quickly. There's an aroma of soap mixed in with the banana, and some of that soap shows up in the taste, too. Feels pretty flat going down. Not bad, but for the price I've had better. Not sure I'd buy another six of this."
"D : Not bad for an American wheat beer but nothing special."
"Poured from bottle to a Sam Adam's pint glass a cloudy golden color with a half inch of head that reduced to a sheen with minor clinging lace. Mild citrus and wheat smell. It had a lemony wheat taste. Was crisp and clean for a Hefeweizen and I could have definately had a few more of these, too bad I snagged the last one."
"You can definitely get the wheat flavor out of this one. I'm getting some lemon, maybe some banana. A tad sour on the finish. Very smooth drink. Much more drinkable than some of the other wheat ales I've had. Very well balanced. Good beer."
"D: Refreshing on this summer morning while I work at my computer. Don't judge. It's not a bad beer to have in your cooler if you're going to the beach but not something I'd give to a friend to show them what a true hefe is about."
"D: Drinkability was ok, rather bland with not much characteristics or good within style. I would personally pass on this one."
"Not my favorite magic hat and not my favorite hefe, but not too bad. it pours a nice hazy golden color with a thin white head that dissipates a bit too quickly to show evidence of much wheat, but it's a pretty beer none the less. the aroma has a bit of the citrus that I've come to associate with hefe's but the banana and spice is sorely missed, the taste is much the same with a bit of citrus and wheat, but lacking in the really nice flavors that I'd like from the hefeweizen yeast. decent mouthfeel nice and crisp with a bit of co2 bite... a nice once and a while beer but make my next magic hat a #9."
"Overall, tasty and refreshing and enjoyable, but nothing is sticking out as one i would choose this over others. It was a bit dissapointing."
"This beer poured golden with a quickly dissipating single-finger head. The smell is heavy on the citrus with some standard wheat scents. The taste starts off with some sweet and tart lemony citrus flavors that finish a little dry. Kind of one-dimensional but very tasty. The mouthfeel is a little watery with a fair amount of carbonation. This beer is high up on my list of drinkable beers, and I could easily put back a six-pack over the course of a night. This is one of my favorite beers for sitting back and relaxing on a hot summer night."
"D - Save for a hot day. It's OK beer."
"Refreshing and clearly my favorite Magic Hat offering to date. Several additional pours could easily fill a hot summer afternoon with friends on the deck."
"Taste is wheat and yeast with hints of lemon and green tea. Feel is medium body with medium carbonation. Pretty smooth. Drinkability is also good. It's not too heavy and would be good for a hot day."
""
"This beer is a good effort, but the mouthfeel is watery and doesn't quite have the full-bodied texture I come to associate with unfiltered offerings. The flavor reflects that: nothing special. It tastes bright and clear, but it has a thin aftertaste that leaves me wanting something more."
"This is a lot better than I remembered it, though it's still way off for a hefe. I know on here it's classified as an APWA, but since it's got ""hefeweizen"" on the label, I'm judging it as a hefeweizen."
"Typical hefe. Pale yellow, little head, grew a little after getting the little bits out of the bottom. Smells of citrus, maybe some sweet limes. Taste is clean, light. Probably won't drink again. Glad I shared the variety pack so I only had to have one of each beer."
"Not at all a bad brew, a great barbecue and summer beer."
"D- Very drinkable and pretty crisp."
"D: Very tasty beer. After recently tasting a few others from Magic Hat this does not stray from what I've come to expect."
"Circus Boy has a cloudy light golden color with a thin head that fades out to nothing. Its aroma is packed with wheat malts and has a pleasing citrus character. On the tongue you get lots of tasty wheat malts, neutral earthy yeast and a big shot of sweet, almost soapy, lemon flavor. The palate has a nice medium body and soft carbonation, giving it a fairly thick and smooth mouth feel. Overall as part of a mix pack I like it but I wouldn't look for it buy itself."
"D: A delicious wheat beer with a very complete fruit heavy flavor, in line with Magic Hat offerings, but much better than most of their line. A pleasant surprise."
"D - Certainly a different take from any other hefeweizen I've had. It's hard to evaluate the flavour of this due to the extremely harsh mouthfeel. Don't really like it."
"Thoughts: Stays true to its class, not the best of Hefeweizens I've had, but another strong offering from magic hat."
"I liked the Circus boy, and I'd drink it again. It's just sort of unremarkable when you compare it with the global wheat variety. European hefeweizens are usually a little darker, slightly fuller beers, also they usually aren't as citrusy in the taste, although it's there in the aroma."
"After a final swirl before the last pour. Pours a hazy golden color with orange highlights. The head was nothing special and it did not leave any lacing on the glass. Magic Hat calls it a hefeweizen so I will rate it as such. The smell is pretty one dimensional, crisp wheat malt, not much else. The taste has the mellow wheat flavor without the tart/drying punch that most pale wheat ales have. However there are no phenols to speak of, no true hefe characteristics. I did notice a sweet lemon like flavor, very subtle though. The feel is moderate with fairly soft carbonation which leads to a silky feel. Finishes quite neutral, no outstanding flavor profile. Drinks very easy, good summertime brew."
"Weird beer. Smell is strong of apple sauce with lots of nutmeg. Has an dark brown color like you see if you've ever had fresh unpasteurized apple cider with a big head which disappears in a flash Has a strong nutmeg taste with hints of wheat and tart apple. It has a bubbly feel on the tongue, somewhat syrupy with a crisp citrus finish. Ok beer I could drink again, don't know how many of these I could drink, it's a fascinatingly spicy beer."
"The main weakness here is the aroma. It has a very faint odor that had just a hint of something I couldn't pick out. I struggled with it throughout the glass and finally got it near the end - sesame. It smelled ever so slightly of sesame. It wasn't objectionable, but it wasn't very beer-like."
"D- Easy to put down and no struggle at all. I could easily go through a sixer of this beer. this is a summer type of beer when it is 90 degrees out."
"Drinkability: Perhaps this is relative to the #9 and Odd Notion stinkers I had earliers out of my 12 pack variety pack, but I like this one... very different, not crisp but refreshing, I could have another."
"D- Very easy to drink."
"this would be a beer i could drink a few of."
"Notes: This was a big surprise,I know that Magic hat has produced good brew,but I just did not think this brew would measure up. Well,it did more than that. I found that this beer was so well brewed. So many other American wheat ales have not reached this level and I dare say that Magic hat has a hit here!"
"T: This beer actually ends up exceeding my moderate expectations for it. A thicker medium body, with heavy carbonation resulting in a very smooth, thick mouthfeel. Lemon, banana, yeast and grain flavors, but not particularly similar to any other wheat beers. Nothing is very assertive but this is very refreshing and more enjoyable than expected or remembered."
"Very good American take on hefeweizen; as stated above much more comparable to the German offerings than the mass-produced, less flavorful Americans put out by Pyramid & Widmer. Recommended."
"After reading some reviews that claimed that this beer was mediocre, I was afraid to try this beer and thought the 12oz. bottle of it that I had sitting in the fridge would go undrinken. However, when I tried it I was quite impressed with its flavor. A pretty pleasant wheaty taste with citrus notes and some metallic/hoppy aftertaste. I do have to agree that this beer doesn't rank with hefeweizens like Schneider Weisse (Schneider and Sohn). However, it was a great match to my lunch and would buy a sixer of it for a get together or for a casual weekday meal."
"Poured out a hazy golden orange appearance. Good sized head that slowly digressed to some good lacing. The smells seemed a bit weak but you can still notice citrus aromas. The taste was one of the highlights for this drink: a not-so-overpowering citrus flavor with some bready textures. However, the mouthfeel was not powerful enough to allow appropriate carbonation. Overall, the tastes were good but other attributes were weak."
"This is a smooth drinking beer, but I do admit that I am not a fan of light colored wheat beers in general. But, I again refer to my New Beers Resolution that I made with myself. Circus Boy has a light taste of lemon, bits of sweetness and a little cakey aftertaste. I can imagine myself enjoying one of these on a hot day on a deck near the water."
"Very unimpressed. I had heard wonderful things about this beer and was extremely disappointed. It poured a nice yellow. It smelled like Lemon and Miller Lite. The taste was sweet with a cheap lemon/wheat taste that hangs around for a long time. It is relatively refreshing but the taste is not very good. Because it is so light you could drink multiple beers in a sitting but the flavor and aftertaste should be enough to keep you from picking this up again."
"Third beer I've reviewed form the seasonal Pandora's Box with roughly the same results. Disappointed; think I've got a bad box; never buying any of these again, especially at their premium price point. Frankly, I'd rather drink High Life."
"D: An interesting, tasty brew with a bit of character and just a little bite to the finish."
"Lightly toasted malt up front with yeasty bread, slightly metallic grain, and fruit juice. Somewhat cidery with a citrus hop bitterness coming on late. Medium body with a wheaty-protein-rich feel. Crackly carbonation hidden within. Not too bad, but pretty forgettable overall."
"Pours a hazy, light gold, medium straw color with plenty of frothy white head. Aroma has a lot of fruity notes to it, some pear, grapes, orange peal, but not a lot coming from the malts, as should be expected from this style. Virtually no hop aroma. On the palate, a highly carbonated brew delivers more intense fruit flavors, emphasizing standard orange and a little coriander. Finishes a bit creamy and dry. This is a fine wheat, as an APWA, it's pretty standard stuff which isn't such a good thing. It is quite quaffable, just nothing interesting going on."
"Appearance cloudy yellow with a large white head and decent lacing. Smell bread and some citrus notes. Taste much the same as smell this beer is dominated by citrus. Mouthfeel mediem body and high carbonation. Drinkability this one just didn't do it for me."
"The lable suggests that this beer would be a standard German Hefeweizen, but after a few sips (and confirmed by the appearance) it is evident that this beer is the inferior American Wheat. the pour brings a muddled golden, straw color with a head formation that falls between fizzy and froathy; but never hung around as it should. the scent is of bread, wheat malt, citus fruits, and a diry, musty aroma that I would later decide to be a deterant. Flavors of wheat malt and barley struggle to give the beer a decent sweetness or body over the tart citric acids. Lemons and grapefruit (not hops) govern the flavors, allowing a bruised-appricot flavor to prevail. Dirty tasting phenols gain intensity as the beer warms, leaving a musty, dusty, attic-like taste on the toung, particularly in the finish. Body starts firm, but finishes thin because of the acidity. Minerally to taste and interferes with mouthfeel. Not the best wheat beer for me, but I've had worse."
"Taste is mild and slightly sweet. Not a lot of anything going on. Some mild fruit maybe apples. Slight spice from the hops. Very mellow but with a nice, clean finish. Decent mouthfeel and a pretty drinkable brew. I'm not a big fan of wheat beers and I think the lack of anything strong makes this one work for me."
"D - Good beer. Not the best APWA i've had but still good."
"The beer poured a hazy, dark golden color with creamy cap of foam. The aroma is citrus and fresh bananas with some wheat malt.The taste is much like the aroma, lemon citrus and graininess with some earthiness. The finish is quick and dry. The beer is light to medium bodied and fairly smooth. Overall not bad."
"M & D - Good, Easy going beer. Very refreshing. Not much hop but thats okay once in a while. Would drink again for sure."
"this is my favorite of this style very good American wheat beer."
"M & D: A decent brew, though perhaps not one of my favourites from Magic Hat, so far. Certainly an Americanization, and probably not what might be expected seeing ""hefeweizen"" on the bottle. I wouldn't mind it being a little more crisp and refreshing if it were to be something I'd session on a hot one. Decent, but probably closer to average."
"Another loser of the night in my opinion, my buddy did not like this one either, too sweet and unbalanced in my opinion, will never have this again by choice, not recommended to anybody"
" A clean and refreshing beer with not much aftertaste. This would be a good summer beer for the Heffe crowd."
"A relatively open-to-interpretation style is made into a real winner by Magic Hat. I prefer this to their Hocus Pocus, which is much lighter bodied and geared toward summer."
"Try it, try it, try it."
"Horrible, absolutely horrible. Down the drain. How can they sell this crap?"
"Bad Circus Boy, bad."
"This one turned out to be a little better than I expected. Although the American Wheat Ale will never be in the same class as its counterpart in Germany, this one seems enjoyable for a warm summer day."
"Drinkability, sure. Its just the beer is'nt big in any one area. Its a good average hefe. Not to big in appearance, smell or taste."
"Could drink a lot of these, but it would get boring, as this beer is not very complex."
"This is a lighter beer; it's quenching and easily finished."
"The Circus Boy has an opaque appearance, with not much head. It has a good fruity smell, rich with orange. The taste was alright, but it didn't really compare with its European hefeweizen cousins. It possessed that typical wheaty, orangey flavor, but didn't have the subtlety of other beers of its type. That said, it's still a drinkable beer."
"My first test of wheat-type beers, overall pretty enjoyable. Looking forward to diving into the Hefeweizens though."
"Poured into a Weizen Glass."
"Since I was a young lad, I have been a fan of the Magic Hat Brewery in Burlington, Vermont. Whenever I am snowboarding in northern Vermont, I make a point of spending some time at their factory. The bar there has several taps. The old stand-bys are always on tap, as well as couple beers in their testing stage. I was sampling their beers when Circus Boy was still in this testing stage. And as someone who loves hefe - weizens, I had to to sample it. Although, it certainly is not as enjoyable as some of the Geramn hefe - weizens out there, it is definately a solid beer."
"I'd weakly recommend this beer. I bought this 12oz single at Brew&Brew in North Ridgeville, OH."
"D: Not a fan again of wheat ales, but I still dont think this is a good example that was all that enjoyable. I would advise to pass on this one unless giving it the effort as part of the sampler. Had to get through these to enjoy ones I know Ill love- roxy rolles and 9."
"12 oz bottle pours a hazy golden yellow with a fluffy white head that seemed to disappear to quickly. Smell is a spicy bitter skunky mixture. Taste is a sweet lemoney citrus with a bitter after taste. Mouthfeel is tangy but thin. Definitely not one of my favorite wheat beers, average at best."
"This beer is a hazy golden color with a medium thin ivory head that dissipates quickly. Spotty lacing. Light citrus and wheat aroma. Thin body with light fruit, wheat and herb flavors. The finish is fruity and short with a mild spice aftertaste. Just not very good though."
"Overall Impression: Nice beer. Style wise its not in the ballpark, but who cares? I really liked the lemon and coriander elements, no trouble drinking this at all."
"Throughly pleasant and a good addition to Magic Hat's arsenal of beer, but I have to say it was a much better beer when it was just a seasonal and not a year round offering."
"Overall Impression: A light, refreshing American wheat ale. Perfect for a summer day. Very clean and probably a good ""cross-over"" beer. I just wish Magic Hat would worry more about correct bottle labels instead of catchy marketing ploys. Overall, they make some pretty decent beers."
"Poured into a 16 oz pint glass. Very little foam, but enough bubbles rising up through a murky body. Alot of lemon/orange taste, but too overpowering. Someone had mentioned that its smelled like some form of orange soda, and I can see where they are coming from. I would drink this again, but wouldn't mind trading my extra bottle of Circus Boy for a Blind Faith, or Roxy Rolls."
"D - Not too complex, after a pint I was satisfied. It serves its purpose as an easy to drink American wheat. It has some moments that are better than average, but I would probably pass next opportunity."
"Drinkability - I was really disappointed in the lack of fully, wheaty head. The nose and taste are subtle, but appropriate for the style. A bit weak all in all, but that does make it easy to drink."
"The drinkability was good the beer tasted nice and went down with lunch quite well. MK"
"This is a brownish-copper amber color brew that pours with no head... The smell is pretty good, reminiscent of cloves, wheat, and bananas... Drinkability is only decent, as I wouldn't want to down too many of these... A good mouthfeel coupled with a decent taste makes for a good beer that can be enjoyed any time. I'm not sure if I'd get this one again, as I was only somewhat satisfied. This beer really didn't do it for me overall and would personally not recommend this... The ale taste is certainly there but there are traces of witbier-hefeweizen... This is a unique drink that can really be enjoyed but not by me..."
"Not my favorite take on hefe but very drinkable. Perfect for a BBQ during the summer. Very thirst quenching."
"Light bodied, nothing special, some flaws, though. Meh."
"Poured 12 oz bottle in to frozen glass.... Orange and hazy in color, not much of a head, little lacing. Smells of lemons and oranges, very pleasent. Mouthfeel is not to heavy not to light.... Tastes a lot like it smells, lemony with a hint of yeast.... Very smooth finish, makes you want another one... Would be a great summer beer. I enjoyed it very much and will buy more... This shows Magic Hat is more than just #9... Great job."
"D. Fairly decent in light taste and abv. Still I miss the yeast."
"i think they all it magic hat 'cuz you're always suprised at what they pull out; this one pours a cloudy orange(u almost w/ a slight white head which dissapates quickly little lacing; wild yeast type smell w/ tangy citrus-like notes; it has a nutty, almond-like flavor w/ the tangy wheat taste, something else here too, i just can't tell what; a rather thin mouthfeel w/ some dextrins; not too bad, just not my mug of ale(ha,ha), i'll prob. finish the other 3 tonite & not drink it again..."
"Final Thought: Let this one settle about 15 minutes, warm up, and enjoy it's subtle complexities. Another great brew from Magic Hat!"
"This beer pours a light golden color with a hint of yellow and a large head which dissipates quickly. Smell is pungent and has strong citrus notes with a bit of coriander. The taste takes a while to develop. The first half is bland, but then in creeps a sweet wheat-like taste reminicent of German hefes. As it trickles down the throat there is a terrific amount of carbonation which leaves just the right amount of flavor behind, but I feel that while in the mouth there is really nothing that develops. This beer reaches about 60% of its full potential, then falls flat."
"Not really sure why MH calls this ""The Hefeweizen"" as it really isn't but it's a pretty tasty brew. Not my first choice for the style but I like it nonetheless."
"Not too bad for an american wheat ale. Good flavors and easily drinkable. It could use more auroma but still not offensive."
"Pours a light cloudy copper color and looks highly carbonated. Starts off with a thick head of several inches, but dwindles down to about a half an inch. Aroma is fruity with a hint of spice. It is very smooth going down, not nearly what you'd expect from the carbonation and is slightly bitter aftertaste. I'm not really impressed with the taste. There isn't anything that stands out here expect the high wheat malt content. Overall it's a decent beer, but nothing to get excited about."
"Circus Boy poured out smooth from the bottle. The head was virtually non-existant, but that's not a big issue with bottled hefeweisens. The color was great! A wonderful, shining, golden wheat color with a bit of orange. The scent is great, too, a nice wheat scent with hints of citrus. Nice taste, above average for a hefe, nice crisp feel and hints of orange. Goes down nice, as well as any other wheat beer. Well worth a try."
"Good beer to start off, but nothing special in the America Wheat Ale category."
"Overall I liked this beer but as a wheat I wasn't totally impressed by it. I did like it however but if I was in the mood for wheat beer this wouldn't be my first choice."
"Pours hazy orange-gold. Little head but spritzy carbonation. Orange sherbert nose. Tart and sweet with a little spice balance. Flavor is sweet, tart and refreshing. Orange sherbert comes through in the flavor. Wonderful hot-weather beer. Stands out among other summer wheats."
"Typical cloudiness for an unfiltered beer. Light citrusy yellow in color. Thin filmy head with a few spots of lacing. Decent aroma with a blend of wheat and fruit. Minor trace of banana stands out and something else, perhaps apricot. Reminiscent of their No. 9 with the fruitiness.Makes a nice summer beer - just enough hint of citrus without being overpowering."
"Pours hazy orange-gold. Little head but spritzy carbonation. Orange sherbert nose. Tart and sweet with a little spice balance. Flavor is sweet, tart and refreshing. Orange sherbert comes through in the flavor. Wonderful hot-weather beer. Stands out among other summer wheats."
"Refreshing and enjoyable to drink but doesn't inspire."
"I can easily find myself pouring a few of these on a relaxing late summer afternoon such as this."
"D- I could drink a bunch of these...but would I? A beer that smells like a skunk rolling around in flowers? I won't be getting this again soon."
"Nice murky orange yellow color with a medium head that recedes a bit quickly for a hefe. Aroma is sour citrus. Lemony. (No I didn't put any lemon in it.) Tangy wheat taste. Citrus again. One of the better tasting American Wheats I've had. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Drinkable enough but not something I'd really want to drink a ton of. It doesn't stack up to its German counterparts but overall this is a decent American wheat beer."
"D - A great summer beer, they go down very easily"
"Drinks average, even in real hot weather, not one to reccomend IMO. Revised my scores up alittle bit seeing the wasn't a hefe, otherwise I'd just say avoid at all costs..."
"I actually like this beer but it is not one I would drink bottle after bottle. Maybe one with dinner then move on"
"12 oz bottle pours a hazy pale orange body with a small white head. Some patchy lace clings to the glass. Aroma is grassy and lemony with a hint of white pepper and wheat. Light medium body is well carbonated. Taste is tart and lemony. Some wheat cracker and yeast notes add some substance. Not bad for a mundane style."
"Tastes of citrus, wheat, some spices with a tangy finish. I really enjoyed this one."
"D - good drinking beer, I could put away quite a few of these on a warm summer day or night."
"D- A nice drinkable wheat beer. Enjoyable, but not outstanding."
"Cant imagine that this brew is too hard to find, but I got mine at good ol' Community Beverage in Queens. Attractive cartoon-ish bottle, best by September 2007. Pours out amber-gold with little-to-no head, which disappears almost instantly. Slight carbonation, but not too frothy. Very light hops smell with a bit of fruit kick to it. Very delicious full beer taste, without being too full on hops and malt, which is what I think Magic Hat was going for. Not harsh on alcohol or hops, but not watered down like so many commercial beers. Very light on the citrus/tangy flavor. Not much going on in the way of extra flavors, but a very simple, and delicious beer. Overall, if youre looking for a good plain beer, without the added kicks here and there, Circus Boy would be a top choice for me. Just good old fashioned beer, light for the summer, and perfectly neutral in the taste department (not too much bitter hops or fruity citrus)."
"A decent brew that I got from the ""Summer Variety Show"" mix pack. I think that this beer is good but I don't think I would get it by itself. Average but good average."
"D- definitely refreshing but with lackluster and/or out-of-place characteristics. i've had more than a few better examples of wheat ale and hefe."
"If this brew had been fined and filtered during production.well.lets be glad it wasnt!"
"Circus Boy seems like a decent wheat that just may take some getting used to. My first impression though is mixed. Didnt love it, didnt hate it, although it may just be the style that Im ambivalent towards."
"Pours a cloudy, golden yellow color with a good head that dissipates quickly and leaves no real lacing (poured from a bottle into a Weizen glass). The wheat is very apparent in the aroma, along with a slight hint of citrus, mainly lemon. Has a very wheaty (duh), lemony taste. Sweet. Has a fairly light mouthfeel, with a good amount of carbonation. Very easy to drink. Overall, a pretty good beer, but nothing too special, try it out."
"This is pretty drinkable, perhaps well suited for skipping the esthetics of the glass and putting away a few bottles."
"If you are looking for a hefeweizen, I think Circus Boy would be a good call."
"drinkability - Very good due to it's great balance I was expecting a strong banana component due to its ""Hefeweizen"" description, but it's very different from that.."
"Awful, awful beer. I wouldn't even cook with this infected tasting beer. One of the worst beers I've ever paid good money for."
"d- refreshing hefe that is easy to drink with a low abv, however it is a bit on the bland side and I would not put in the top tier of this genre"
"I'm going to respectfully disagree with the sizeable minority of reviewers who panned this beer. The beer poured a nice hazy orangish color with a decent head that stuck around. The carbonation in this beer is good, it is medium bodied, and quite tasty. The beer is definitely citrus, lemon, maybe some orange rind, and it has a very pleasant aftertaste of that same citrus with a little bit of a hop bite. I really like this beer and it does elevate the otherwise weak summer ales (a.k.a American wheat beers) to a much more interesting plateau. This one is a good call or even better. L'Chaim."
"Pours a clean yellow/orange-ish color with no head at all. It has the aroma of a faint citrus smell and wheaty undertones, and a dry end. In the taste, it is citrus, especially orange and a yeasty charicteristic. It has a nice body to it, a good taste overall. A nice, refreshing beer."
"Pours out a hazy pale color with a small head. Flowery aroma with some lemon and spice. Crisp malt with a tangy wheat flavor and a touch of honey. Hops are slightly spicy. I was initially expecting this beer to be a German style hefe, and as a hefe this is disappointing. Once I stopped thinking about style, however, I started enjoying this crisp, tasty wheat beer much more."
"Certainly not overpowering - sessionable. A somewhat unusual flavor profile makes it worth downing a few. I'm slightly disappointed that I just got a single bottle of it from Trader Joes."
"D- I could see sitting down and having a couple on a nice summer day. There are better wheats out there, but this would do."
"From what I have read people either love or hate this beer. Well I LOVE it. This is my favorite beer from Magic Hat."
"Light body, but not very much carbonation. A bit watery. Kind of disappointing."
"When wheat is involved there are certain expectations. Also this is definitely not a Hefeweizen as the label suggests due to the lack of wheat-beer standards. Thinner than it has to be!"
"D: Major disappointment. Drank this within a few hours of buying it. This is my second growler of Circus Boy with the first being much better. I like this beer from the bottle, but this growler fresh from the brewery was hard to drink."
"Always a pleasure to try something ""new"" from the Burlington ladies and gents...pours fizzy to the point of oral effervescence, two-finger head in weizen glass...left no trace in a swift evaporation...an eerie tawny golden funnel cloud centered in its slightly opaque clarity....like its namesake, quite odd...lemony scent with some clove notes...six-month storage may have something to do with all this....but malty? flattened mouthfeel, straight to throat flow; thus, refreshing yet absent from any distinction...I bet a lemon or orange BlueMoons this into some summer fun... straight-up in May, this Magic Hat leaves me feeling ordinary..."
"T/M/D- crisp and refreshing....lots of clove spice, banana and a lemon tartness. Light hints of orange and tropical fruit. Light body, and much better than expected."
"A decent brew for the style. Easy and tasty enought to be ""sessionable"" on a hot day."
"Appears a heavily clouded orange blossom honey hue with a large off white head at least two fingers deep leaves uneven bands of lacing with each sip. Aromatics slightly tart accents from the wheat additions here absent today are all of the yeast highlights of banana clove and vanilla from the typical hefeweizen definitely seems more of an American Wheat. Touch of citrus in the nose with some bready doughy yeast and malt tones not so much sweet in smell but gristy and bread like. Flavors sharp wheat with powdered yeast doughy notes and finishes with citrus and herbal hop tones nothing overpowers here all aspects of the beer are blended well. Kind of a let down if your expecting a tasty hefe but nonetheless a solid American Wheat pretty satisfying. Mouthfeel prickly carbonation tickles the throat body is light not watery has some substantial protein body here from the wheat. Drinkability is decent like I said seems bland to me but better than most American wheats with any fruit additions out there, definitely refreshing."
"Pouring cloudy yellowish/gold with a short pale head that leave decent lace. The aroma is light and summery. Yellow grain, citrus, and a bit of hops at the end. The flavor is a bit mild for my taste. A bit sweet and wheaty (somewhat bland) with a nice lemony citrus tone, apricot, a mellow spice, and some dim yeasty hops. Overall a nice warm weather beer; refreshing. Nice carbonation and a pleasantly light texture. Smooth and clean. A beer I might enjoy more after mowing the grass on a hot summer day."
"Gave this beer a try last evening, it poured to a dull orange color with a fair sized head that had some good retention and left a faint amount of lacing along the side of the (mostly at the top) glass. The aroma started with a lemon scent mixed with a spiciness that goes along with it quite well. Some wheat aroma there as well. The taste was fair, actually when I first took a sip I really though that this was going to be a good beer IMO. Noticeable lemon flavors which add a zest to it at first then wheat spiciness which where nice. Had a bittering effect as well but after a while, I am not sure why, my feelings on this brew changed as I felt its flavors where just a little off. Overall this seems to be a serviceable beer but IMO we have better American wheat beers close at hand."
"Is it a Hefe? Not really, too American for that. Magic Hat has added their special touch to a beer to create a delightful sweet citrusy and herbal brew. The smell could be stronger, but the mouthfeel was wonderful, not overly sweet, but almost juicy that kept be wanting more."
"Drinkability- Got a mixed twelver and I don't think that I'm that excited to have another hefeweizen tonight. One seems like enough. I'm excited, however for a couple of the other magic hat summer brews"
"The 'boy pours a one-finger, creamy eggshell head with a burnt sienna, cloudy body with the barest of snowglobe sedement. Unfiltered, maybe, but not bottle conditioned. Floral hops start you off in the aroma, followed by clove and (of course) a whiff of Banana to end it up. A little macro of a smell for the style. Subdued. The taste is what you'd expect; bananas, maybe some toasted wheat notes in there, I'd reviewed a couple by the time I took these notes. The mouthfeel was duly creamy. Overall this is a solid Hefe for the price and a brewery that tends not to put them out. Tastier than any of the big micros Summer ales I've had this season. A good kick-down cool-off brew. Loses points in smell. Where's my banana-bread!?"
"D - Not bad. I am not a fan of Magic Hat in general, but Circus Boy delivered. Sessionable and although I won't buy it myself, I might have it again if offered."
"This all led to a finish that was short and stale. I hope the remainer of my Magic Hat slections I have are better than this. They almost have to be."
"Well it pours a nice deep gold color, a little dark for the style, but it is ok. The aromas are a rather sour spicy grainy aroma. Almost lemony zestish. The grainy sweetness and the sweet wheat come out more as it warms. There is a sllight clove/banana aroma that lingers. The spicy flavors transfer over to the taste. It is followed by a sour tartness, that is rather pleasant in my book. That lemon spicy flavor is really predominate in the flavor. It all has a very clean characteristic that I really have never encountered in an American Wheat Ale. Makes for a nice summer session beer."
"Pous a cloudy gold color, with straw highlights. Creamy one and a half-finger head shows passable retention and light lacing. Malted wheat, two-row, and earthy yeast in the nose. First sip is sweet with pale malt and wheat, backed by snappy tropical fruit and faint yeast notes. The aftertaste is hesitantly drying, with a citrusy american hop flavor and sharp bitterness that melds with the phenolic fruit flavors to balance the malt very well. Medium-light bodied; drawing texture from the wheat and suspended yeast- the carbonation is crisp and aided by the zesty fruit character which enlivens the mouthfeel. Finishes dry with minimal residual wheat and pale malt, and a assertive but fading tartness. This one really blurs the line between Pale Wheat Ale and Hefe-Weizen, but the inticing flavor profile and high drinkability would assure its success in either catagory."
"Pours a pale color. Aroma is light and pungent with hints of citrus and wheat in the background. Taste is similar as I can taste an almost banana-like flavor with only a hint of malt or anything else. Not quite as good as the Long Trail version but it would be second on my list. It's also very light and drinkable. Perfect summer beer."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Light in body and with a higher amount of the nice small carbonation bubbles this one feels pretty good on the palate. It finishes clean, leaving you with a cool sensation in the mouth that is very refreshing. This is a brew I'd buy again, though I think I'll wait untill I've tried more of the style, I always like to see what else is being offered."
"D- This reminds me of just another Pale American Wheat Ale with note of light lager in there. Not much going on in this beer."
"Cloudy light orange color with a white soda pop head that fizzles away quickly. Big yeasty, wheat grassy aroma with a lemon effervescent and an ever so slight caramel sweetness in the back. Pithy citrus tartness and a balanced dryness is very effective. Moderately bitter, nice wheat flavor, and a tame yeastiness for an unfiltered. Dry and slightly peppery hops with some pine that lingers. Crisp, tongue tingling carbonation in the refreshing mouthfeel. Dry and clean finish. Among other hefs I might go for on a hot day Im grabbing this on a humid day for its excellent drying character."
"The taste is over-the-top citrus, mostly lemon. There's not a banana flavor I expected, since the bottle said ""hefeweizen"" on it. The wheat is certainly present, and there is a bit of a tea-like bitterness to the drink. Mouthfeel is a bit flat, but it's not a distraction. This beer is different, but I don't know if I'm a huge fan. It's got a little too much of a lemonade/iced tea thing going on. Still, it's not bad, and I could see it working out nicely on a warm day."
"First beer I've tried with this brewer and since I'm not a huge fan of hefeweizen I'm sure I'll enjoy the others in this sample pack"
"drinkability - I like this beer because i love witbier's. I could drink a lot of these."
"12oz bottle. Pours light and beautifully cloudy, with different swirls of colour when looked at closely. Aroma is sorely lacking. Taste is rather mediocre and doesn't have the qualities that I look forward to from a wheat beer. There aren't too many distinguishable characteristics in this one."
"D- light taste and decent body make this guy pretty drinkable. I'll have another."
"One of the first things that you will notice with this beer is the cloudiness of the delightful golden amber color. It says right on its label that it is unfiltered and unfettered. There is nothing spectacular about its initial aroma or flavor but then the flavor is released and its quite a kick. There is also a ton of yeast in this thing."
"This came out of the bottle with a golden hazzy color and almost no head. It has an upfront citrus, almost limey aroma. In addition, it has a tart citrusy lime flavor. No discernable hops present. I have to say this has been my least favorite Magic Hat beer to date. Too much on the citrus flavoring. It would benefit from some stronger hop presence to balance this beer out."
"Alas, a lemon wedge (a salvage effort) couldn't save this one."
"D: So, this was really a unusual beer, but blame me for having a Great Lakes white ale a few beers before for ruining this. This was one of four Magic Hat beers that I've tried. I don't think I'm going to be getting any from them again."
"Tasty and well hopped ale here. A lesson for other brewers to try some of the ideas that ""can't work."""
"The mouth is light and bright, it snaps, crackles, and pops along the palate. It's very drinkable and shows more character than most of the Wheat beers I've sampled--they are not one of my favorite styles. But this one I look forward to revisiting."
"This beer poured a cloudy yellow and formed a nice foamy white head that slowly subsided coating the glass with lace. A heavy amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, banana and clove. An flavor of hops and light hints of banana and spices. The body is fairly light and the finish is a touch sprite. As a wheat beer, is not that impressive and just seems to light in body, taste, etc."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. This was part of a variety 12-pack (4 Magic Hat beers), and not all that good. The bottle label said it's a hefeweizen but I don't think it really is. A wheat beer maybe, but no way does it have the characteristics of a hefeweizen. It looked all right, hazy golden color but no real head. The aroma and flavor were a light but wheaty. No major yeast influence, and no cloves or bananas or such. Just an average wheat beer."
"12 ounce bottle as part of the Magic Hat ""Joe's Garage"" spring variety 12 pack, bottle says best before August 2007. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy gold/orange color with about an inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like yeast, wheat, a bit of lemon and something weird that I can't really describe. It tastes like wheat, yeast, and lemon, and it has a bit of a tangy and hoppy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light and thin, and a bit watery. But the drinkability is good, I could drink quite a few of these. Overall, I think this is a decent beer."
"D- With all the hefes out there, this one is real low on my list. If it is offered, I would not reject it; this is a good beer on a hot summer day when you just need something other than water."
"Not a bad beer. Easy easy too drink on a warm spring day."
"D---This reminded me of a hefe with training wheels. It is well made and thirst quenching but the yeast contribution was rather bland."
"Pours a slightly cloudy yellowish color, nice carbonation, tiny little fizzy white head, some sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is slightly yeasty, grassy, and caramel. The taste is grassy/yeasty, slight caramel. The finish is dry. Light-Medium body. Drinkable, not too bad of the style. My first Magic Hat brew."
"Overall impression: Not great, but highly drinkable and just enough complexity to send me back for another."
"Taste is the same story as the smell. Yeasty and light, I should've put an orange into this beer to give it some flavor. The moutfeel is fluffy, light on the carbonation, and leaves almost no mouthfeel. I could easily drink 3-5 of these beers, but the complexity and flavor leaves much to be desired."
"Drinkability - I've had quite a few wheat brews in my time, but this one definetly stands out as unique. The yeasts are pretty cool and it still has all the classic characteristics you'd expect from a wheat/white beer. I'll have to check out some more Pale Wheat Ales, but this one was a winner!"
"pours a cloudy golden color, two finger white head that holds to a covering on the beer. big smell of fruit and citrus. taste is of tropical fruits and citrus and bread. mouthfeel is light, good carbonation no bitter after taste. good session beer for the summer months"
"Looks a lot like a homebrew thats is still in the fermenter. Good white head on top. Moderate aroma of banana and cloves. Not as phenolic as some hefes. Good, crisp and dry flavor. More banana and phenolic flavors then a lot of US hefes I have had. Nice balance of lemony/citrus flavors. Good body-much fuller then I expected. Nice residual malt sweetness to it. A winner in my book. Magic Hat hasnt inpressed me too much lately. This is a good beer-where's the summer when you need it?"
"D - Very nice effort. Atypical for style, but not to the detriment of the beer."
"A cloudy pale yellow color with a good sized frothy head. Aroma is citrusy, lots of lemon with hints of spices. Flavor lacks the spicy notes of some of the better hefes and leans predominantly towards a lemon twang with the spices being very distant in the background. A bit of a sulfur aftertaste is rather distracting. The sulfur taste seems to be something that plagues a lot of the MH brews. Not bad, but there's better hefes to be had."
"Pale yellow in color, pours clear, but rouse the yeast and pour the rest and it clouds right up. Doesn't have the clover or banana nose of a true Heffeweizen, nore the flavor, it is more along the lines of an American wheat. Does have a lemony twang to it, and some hop bitterness without the hop flavor. Very light body and an easy drinker. It's a decent beer."
"Pours a slightly cloudy orangish gold under a one finger white head that boasts lots of bubbles and fades quite quickly to a think collar and spotty film. A couple of lace strings hang on the sides. The nose has lots of wheat and a touch of citrus fruit, probably lemon. The mouth is light and very prickly. Sweet and tangy taste, definitely with lemon notes. There's not much yeast here, despite the fact that the label calls it ""The Hefeweizen!"" The lemon taste yields to a subdued but unmistakable espresso dry bitterness which starts to control at the finish, then dominates the aftertaste. Not at all what I expected, this is a fairly pleasant brew worthy of sustained enjoyment, even if it does not generate excitement."
"Looks like a hefe...dull gold color, fairly decent sized white head, lots of carbonation. Leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass. Nose was average, crispness and some banana but nothing to get your attention. Taste was not really outstanding either, crisp...mild wheat beer/hefe style taste, but not even as pronounced as Widmers. Mouthfeel was good...not watery, rich enough for the style. Drinkability is fairly good also, I would have no problem drinking several on a hot day, but this is not a beer I would go out of my way to seek out..."
"A nicely done American wheat beer. One of the better beers I have had from Magic Hat lately."
"Drinkability: This is the best aspect of this beer. Very light feeling and drinkable."
"Poured beer into tumbler at 45 degrees. Beer had a nice light head, cloudy of course yellow orange color. Bready smell came from the big and small bubbly head. Strange looking carbonation looking bubbles under head stuck to side of glass. Beer was yeasty tasting of couse, bready with a slight sweet taste, tiny hop taste very crisp. Not a big wheatbeer fan but I would try this again."
"12oz. bottle poured a cloudy golden color with fluffy white head and decent retention that leaves some spots of lace around the glass. Smell has a bit of a funky fruit scent like an old banana, peach fruit drink. The taste seems somewhat watered and rather bland. I could easily drink this one but would probably not have another."
"Very light mouthfeel ,very easy drinking,refreshing,execellent session beer. A great starter wheat.Lacks a little flavor but enough to make a great summer beer. Could drink this all of a summer day."
"Does anyone else remember when MH used to make good beers? Oh well, at least the lable is interesting."
"Pours a four-fingered white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Almost clear amber color, ton of yeast on bottom of bottle. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Yeasty nose. Starts sweet, some yeast, piney aftertaste. 12 oz bottle, gift from Vintage Cellars Blacksburg, VA. Best by Nov 2006."
"Drinkability is ok, this would be a decent lawnmower beer but its not quite tasty enough to have too many."
"d- a good beer, however a little too sweet, but enjoyable"
"Nice example for style. Easy drinking, tasty, tart, slightly sweet, and yeasty. Flavors really start to blend nicely as it warms."
"Not bad -- one of the better offerings I've had from Magic Hat, which is generally not one of my favorite brewers. Nothing I'm going to hunt for, but certainly nothing I'd turn down either."
"Poured cloudy pale orange with a thin fizzy head that dropped at once to a quarter-inch. Aroma very subtle, some lemon fighting with the C02 nose-buzz. Taste was ginger and lemon with honey notes, rounded out with the very slight hop bitterness typical of the style. Light and refreshing and rather good. This is an ""unfiltered"" hefe, but the yeast forms a thick sediment that tends to stay in the bottle. I advise gentle agitation before pouring if you want it ""mit hefe""."
"This is from Joe's Garage mix pack. Pours a very hazy yellow (lot of yeast sediment in this) Smells a bit weak and a little soapy with citrus. tastes quite a bit better, somewhat citrus, a little yeasty tasting with some ending bitterness in the finish. Overall it would a nice summer beer, should be released a little later in the season."
"D - A pretty good fit for the style...a stronger selection than some other Magic Hat offerings. I'd give the thumbs up to try this one."
"Overall- A decent offering. Definitely a golfing beer!"
"I knew it was wheat, but the first sip came off as Steam, and I was encouraged, and while I didn't become discouraged, it dropped off quickly. No question, though, it is refreshing, with its dry finish and quenching nature. I guess this is a time-and-place beer, with where you are and when it is making this beer either just what you want, or a bit less than ideal. But that's too much thinking for me."
"Another solid brew acquired from Metalmonk - thanks!"
"A bit darker than most hefeweizens, more orange. Decent head, nice carbonation. Lemon dominates both the smell and tastes. It tastes similar to lemon detergent, almost like a fake lemon flavor. Also has a nice spiciness, but is overpowered by the lemon. Tangy aftertaste. The lemon flavor is just too much, too tangy and soapy. Maybe a got an older bottle, but I did not enjoy this. Maybe I'll try again sometime if I get a fresher sample."
"pours a hazy sweet golden color. you can definitly smell the wheat and some fruit notes right up front. the taste is smooth with bannana and clove notes as expected but this beer kind of has a slight edge to it. not bad, but just a flavor i can't place. i can now understand why this beer was in the winter sampler. it's the first american hefe that i haven't immediatly thought was a summertime beer. i could definitly see this being as good on a cold winter night as on a hot summer day. overall pretty good and definitly one of my new favorite magic hat offerings."
"Not the smoothest arrangement of flavors but a decent and enjoyable variation on the style. I still don't see why it is in my winter mix pack though."
"This is a bit off for a hefe, I won't buy it again."
"Overall: Thirst quenching, I found this one to be quite refreshing. A good hefeweizen, but you'd better be in the mood for one."
"On of my favorite beers as it is always constant. It is a wheat beer, and you will know it from the first sip. It has a delicious strong wheat taste, with a slight citric air. It is a very crisp beer, and for a hefeweizen is relatively hoppy. It is very much alike it fellow magic hat brother, Hocus-Pocus, except without the sweet honey flavor."
"Pours a hazy orange with a thick white head that lingers. The smell reminds me of lemon pledge, definitely has lemon zest, maybe banana and a subtle hoppyness. The taste is driven by the lemon/citrus and dominates the beer. It has a light body with a pleasant mouthfeel. A good unfiltered and well carbonated beer, but the taste was hard to get through by the end of the glass. The subtle hop aftertaste was the only thing that helped me finish this one. This beer is refreshing but you better be in the mood for a hefe. A strong flavor for hefe lovers."
"12 oz. bottle, best by February, brewed with natural flavors (?), and unfiltered. It pours an opaque apricot and is topped with an inch of white head that leaves good lacing. The aroma is spicy and citric, with wheat tang/husk, lemon/orange, light banana, and medicinal phenols. The wheat tastes nutty/tangy, and there are notes of citrus, medicinals, light banana, and a medium bitterness on top of a medium body that is quite smooth, with medium carbonation and finish. Overall a quality pale wheat ale that definitely quenches thirsts."
"Pours a cloudy orange color with chunks of yeast in suspension. Thick head of large off white bubbles. Aroma is musty and on the clove side of the spectrum. Taste is thick and yeasty with a bit a lemon and clove. Rather dry aftertaste, cloves, mildly bitter. Not my favorite wheat beer, but not a drain pour"
"Circus Boy pours a light orange, quite cloudy after a lot of swirling. I smell a slight yeast astringency and a bit of citrus hop in the background. Taste is more of the same, banana and clove flavors are slgiht at best. Otherwise this is a fairly decent wheat beer, quite drinkable."
"This beer poured a clear, golden color with creamy, white foam that persisted. The smell was malty with bit of a vegetal smell and a hint of sulfur (?). The taste was wheat malt with some yeast. There was a light floral flavor. The hop bitterness was low. The mouthfeel was crisp with medium body and good carbonation. The dry wheat malt lingered in the finish. This was not bad, and a bit refreshing."
"This beer looked like a hefe, and Magic Hat bills it as such, but it tastes nothing of the sort. It carries a hoppy, bready, yeast flavor. Lacking definitive banana and clove, yet still spiced. Citrus. Accurately classified as an American pale wheat ale."
"Overall: I don't particularly care for this one, but I'm not a fan of wheat beers in general. It's true to style and it doesn't taste bad (my roommate loves it), but I just don't like wheat beers."
"Not a bad beer at all. Again I would lighten up the lemons or try to balance out with a little more hop presence. Refreshing though, for sure."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with some nice tanginess. It is easy to drink and very smooth."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Not my favorite Heffe. Too out there."
"A good drinkable beer. Different taste with no real distinct style. I taste hints of wheat,hops,and ginger. A spicy beer that is balanced with a smooth wheat finish. The color is a hazy straw yellow. No real head to speak of with small amounts of lacing. A light to medium body with good carbonation and an again well balanced mouthfeel.Aroma is a citrus,wheat,and banana smell. Slight bitterness that does linger. I wouldnt say this a true American wheat beer. Magic Hat is not known to follow any style when brewing. Overall this is very good and worth a try."
"smooth and very drinkable. not what I was expecting, but I enjoyed this beer and wouldn't mind drinking a few of them."
"Notes - Looks great and has a interesting flavor, check this one out."
"A funny beer, the Circus Boy -- its component flavors don't sound very good, but they come together to taste just fine. I poured a cloudy yellow glass full and was greeted by a fishy, metallic smell, not entirely unlike that of a can of tuna. Fortunately, take a sip and the fishy-metallic odor translates to a savory flavor with a slight twang. As the beer warmed, I was able to discern a distinct goaty undertone and lemon highlights, which would be particularly delicious if paired with the right food. This beer is similar to Magic Hat's Hocus Pocus, another wheat ale, but not as dry and altogether more flavorful. They're both worth trying, so see which one you like better."
"very nice."
"Pours a hazy straw yellow with a minimal white head. Smells very strongly of lemons and faintly of musty yeast. Tastes, almost overpoweringly, of lemon grass with hints of wheat. Has a nice mouthfeel with a low amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good, its a good beer for a hot summer day when your not looking for something too complex."
"It's a cloudy, hazy pour with a faint caramel coloring. The beer revolves in the glass with a snow globe type movement. The taste was of citrus and grain. It was reasonably refreshing with an after taste of mellon. Circus boy is a nice beer to have at a BBQ."
"Drinkability: An interesting experiment but not to my taste; I had this on tap recently and enjoyed it a bit more and remember it as more like a traditional hefe than this"
"Dirty wheat with a muddy ivory and very clingy head fills my weizen glass. Very cloudy. Sweet malt aroma, some spice, mild citrus. Flavor is bland, harsh lemony yeast. Very poor. I found very little substance or character in this beer at all. Mouthfeel is chalky, medium bodied, highly carbonated, and grainy. Very disappointing and hardly drinkable."
"The taste is sweet and complex, much like the #9. Very interesting. The head settles to thin sharp foam. Overall it is a very nice beer if you don't mind drinking something that looks like Metemucil."
"Very nicely blended together, and right up there with my favorite summer wheat beers."
"Pretty weak body all around. Unless I hear otherwise from someone else I'm planning to stay clear of this one from the good folks at Magic Hat."
"Taste as smells, good malty earthy hit in the beginning with banana and clove appearing in the middle finishing with a light dryness. Very refreshing to drink. I would have preferred a thicker mouthfeel, but it was not watery. Nice balance and transition of flavors. Great session beer. start you lawn mowers!"
"Drinkability: I like this style, as it's definitely closer to an APWA than a Hefeweizen. It takes some interesting liberties, and I made a session brew out of this. It may be too sweet for some, and this could be better, but for right now it's a pretty tasty brew."
"This beer has the appearance of a hazy golden ale, but was missing the normal cloudiness of a weiss beer. I was unable to pick up much of an aroma, other than maybe a slight citrus. Circus Boy starts with a peppery bite, but smooths out to a citrus body, is very smooth, and has a mild finish. Not one of Magic Hat's best efforts."
"I find this beer very easy to drink. I don't think I'll be getting it a lot, but I will enjoy my growler."
"a brash, gung-ho, and thoroughly drinkable hefe that kicks around the tastebuds with balanced complexity in a wheat beer that doesn't bore."
"Pours a very hazy golden orange with a thin white head. The aroma has some citrus fruits upfront, along with a wheaty sourness, biscuity malt and a slight hint of ethanol. The flavor is initially malty with a sour wheat character upfront, along with some citrus fruits, biscuit, and some herbal hops. The mouthfeel is light and crisp with good drinkability. A tasty and drinkable pale wheat ale, great for a summer afternoon."
"Medium-body, moderate carbonation. Good balance. A little more hoppy than I was expecting, but this is still a nice crisp wheat beer. Label says it's a hefe, but given the strong citrus notes and hop presence it does seem more like an American Wheat."
"This is quite easy to drink, but not in a good way. I could pound this stuff all night long due to the low abv, but the flavor and overall appeal isn't there for me. In my opinion, Magic Hat does a much better job of promoting and creating cool bottle labels than creating tasty brews."
"Big, rocky head with pretty good retention. Cloudy yellow, slightly orange color. Smell is yeasty, wheat, and sweet. Taste is nice - sweet, a little fruity and tangy with maybe a touch of hops. Very smooth and refreshing with a light-medium body. Very drinkable and one of my favorite wheat beers."
"Taste is lemony, but there's a bland grainy taste behind the fruitiness. A little hint of apricot in the end. A little chalky in the mouthfeel. Refreshing, but not that good."
"Also note I made sure to dislodge and totally dissolved all the sediment into the beer before pouring, so there were no chunks floating or left in the bottle."
"Comments: This was a bit out of the rnage of an American wheat from my point of view. The flowery, perfumy flavor made it a kind of anomaly in comparison. I would drink again if in a mix 12-pack, but wouldn't buy on its own merits."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is light bodied. The beer has ok carbonation. This is not a bad beer. I just wanted much more flavor and aroma from my beer. This beer is a ok beer drink. This is just not a top shelf beer."
"An easy drinker, though I suspect this is yet another American wheat beer using the hefeweizen category too liberally. Still a satisfying offering, very likeable as long as you let it volley somewhere between the fruit beer, wheat beer and hefeweizen categories."
"Overall: An okay beer, an easy drinker, but lacking in flavor."
"This is a nice drinking beer, although I suspect 2-3 would be my limit before I lost interest and moved onto something more interesting or less-accentuated."
"12oz bottle: This pours a mainly cloudy golden color. It was a little fizzy, and suprisingly had no head to it. The aroma was OK, with some notes of banana, but mainly citrus and some wheaty breadiness. The taste has a suprising hint of bitterness to it. Some wheat flavor, with some malts to the body also. It had potential, but I think the circus boy was hanging out with the bearded lady instead of making a good beer."
"A beer with a strong personality, no doubt. The citrus aroma and flavor are very pronounced. Not quite a hefeweizen but then again american wheat beers seem to be gravitating towards the ""hefeweizen"" moniker lately even if the resemblence is a little far afield. But that is not to criticize the flavor, which I enjoyed. It is a great beer for a hot, swealtering summer night. It is on the sweet side but has a round, full flavor that definitely is one the ale side."
"Drinkability: This is drinkable, sure enough, and even refreshing on a 99 degree day. But the odd sour flavor and lack of development leaves this a little flat. Not particularly offensive, but not much as a hefeweizen either."
"Would I buy this beer again? Probably not, I prefer a hefeweizen, but this could be a wheat beer for people who don't like wheat beer or a transition to something more..."
"Very drinkable. Dry, balanced. Not a bad effort."
"Pouring from the bottle, this brew is the color of straw yellow. Cloudy from the yeast a nice head appears on the top of the glass. Lacing is fair, aroma of yeast, lemon and fresh grass. Taste is a hint of lemon with the wheat in behind and the mild mustiness of the yeast. Nicely carbonated, smooth going down. Overall not bad. I find it hard to find a good American wheat beer. Some lack flavor , some lack everything. This one has enough to make it an good brew."
"Like most Magic Hat beer, Circus Boy is different. As far as quality, there is no brewery typical since their line-up ranges from the regrettable (#9) to the fantastic (Thumbsucker). As far as I'm concerned, Amarillo hops are the key to Circus Boy's success. Now if someone could only find the key to let him out of his cage."
"12oz brown bottle with best before September on the back. Pours a hazy (if you swirl the yeast in) gold with a 2 finger head, good longevity and lace. Nice wheat malt aromas. Banana and clove are present but not nearly as much as the Euro style. Yeasty with an underlying honey lemon smell. Nice sweet malt mixed with honey and lemon. Slight banana and clove flavors. A nice mellow non lingering hop bitterness at the end. Full flavored for an American Hefe. A bit heavy but very easy drinking. A nice example of an American Hefe."
"($14.99 / 2006 Spring Variety 12-Pack)"
"Drinkability is quite good. A full flavored beer that's rich in taste and texture, but not so much so that you're limited to drinking one or two."
"You have to like lemon to like this beer. It almost tastes like the lemon from a box of trix or lucky charms. THe only caveat with this beer would be switching from one to another type and having that lemony taste."
"Pale wheat yes, not a hefeweizen. Herbal Hoppy and some lemon, like a blend of a pale ale and a hefweizen. Moderate amount of wheat in the mouth A nice one, though light on the mouth. Yeast wheaty smell. Cloudy yellowness with white head.Good summer day beer."
"Apparently, they brew it with lemongrass which would explain some of the flavors. Good for refreshment and better than 370."
"Overall body is light with nice carbonation, but the flavor just doesn't seem to be amplified enough for me to want any more. MH has the start of something here, but project is still incomplete."
"Poured a dark orange with different shades throughout the the body which I love, it leaves a thick off white head that is frothy and bubbly. The aroma is terrible, sour, funky sour milk, my first thoughts is this could be a bad beer. The taste fantastic! Sweet malty honey upfront, nothing like the nose very strange this has never happened to me before where the nose is spoiled but the beer itself is great. To continue with the taste it has a strong wheat twang, that is balanced by again some sweetness of sun flowers, fruit, pale malt, and a the finish is brisk clean and lovely. The nose could be a fluke, but I would def buy this beer again I just wonder about the nose."
"An odd beer, not a classic german or even american wheat. Somewhere in the middle with just a twist to it making it very original beer."
"A boring wheat ale with some flaws in flavor. I was under the impression that this was a former mystery batch. If so, this version is slightly better than I remember, but that's not saying much."
"D: A pretty interesting beer, really. How you feel about the aroma is critical to this beer. I'd rate it as pretty complex."
"Magic Hat is shaping up to be a hit with the Macro drinking women out there. Most of the girls I know now love this as well as #9."
"Nice color, cloudy honey with a thick white head that gets down to a finger, some lacing, with a lot of bubbles. Aroma is on the heavy side for a hefeweizen, reminds me almost of fresh grass (in a good way). Taste is tart, almost winey, with hints of grapefruit. Alcohol hits on the way down. Flavor was probably helped by this bottle being particularly fresh. Moutfeel was light, bubbly, and dry. The grapefruit tang and light character make it a nice summer beer. Perhaps a little hoppier than other hefs, but that's what Magic Hat does."
"Clouded ochre core with chaff highlights. Short, off-white bubbles that settle quickly to a collar, with no carbonation streams present. Lemony and slightly yeasty with a modest spicy hop note. The taste is fruity and zesty, lemon zest with some bread crust yeastiness abound. A bit grainy, and there is also a slight mustiness that shows up in the finish. The mouthfeel is bright and effervescent with a medium body. I enjoyed this as a wheat ale, but do not expect a true hefeweizen as those defining banana and cloves notes are 100% removed. This is a wheat beer with a built in lemon."
"this is really one of my favorite beers. its absolutely delicious. nice color to it, orangish tint, not too much head and smells itrusy/fruity. absolutely perfect for any summer drinking session, and made me realize the goodness of hefeweizens in general. surprisingly this beer comes in top few of magic hat beers and hefwiezins overall"
"Pours a cloudy straw color with a nice thick white head. Pretty high carbonation is evident immediately. The aroma is of wheat and citrus with a bit of rustic straw and earth underneath. Theres a tart-smelling quality to the aroma that makes the beer seem refreshing before you take the first sip. Moderately dry with a light, spritzy character. The citrus quality really comes out in the taste. Not much in the way of phenols or esters, just straightforward wheat. This gives the beer a bit of a ho-hum quality. There may be a sketch yeast taste, but its not a centerpiece of the beer. Light and very easy to drink, this may be a decent sit-on-the-deck-in-the-sun beer."
"Very cloudy beer, but it's meant to be cloudy. After all, we drink it because it tastes good... not because its crystal clear. And Circus Boy certainly does taste good. It reminds me of some of the beers a local microbrewery serves on tap. The fact that Magic Hat can reproduce that quality in a mass production of bottled beer is commendable, to say the least. The pouring tip on the side of the box definitely affects the overall taste and appearance of the beer; give it a try."
"Somewhat pale beer with a slight orange tint. Average head but lacing was not very impressive. Smelled stongly of citrus, definitely some lemon. The taste seemed to comprise of a lot of citrus with some wheat undertones. A nice mouthfeel but less carbonation than one would expect. Definitely very easy to drink. Try it if you get the chance but nothing to write home about."
"There is a bit of crispness as it rests on the taste buds, but it's mostly from carbonation. Worst of all, this one goes down heavy. My stomach is still protesting. There are better hefeweizens out there."
"Pretty dang drinkable, yesterday(5/28/06) was a hot one up here in the great woods of cow Hampshire and these went pretty easily."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" white head over the slightly cloudy light golden brew. Head is quickly slow to fade, and presents ample bubbly white lacing. Aroma is earthy wheat, with citric notes. Taste is lots of citrus, not much wheat. You can taste and feel the light wheat charcter floating under the surface, but it just isn't pronounced enough for me. Lingers with a slight lemony aftertaste. Mouthfeel is acceptable, certainly nothing detracting, and drinkability is definitely easy. This would probably fit into the thirst-quencher category, but even for that it seems a bit lacking on flavor."
"Cap reads... What is the mixture of life's elixir"
"kinda disappointed. perhaps i bought too many. a twelve pack would have held me. i dont know when (if) i'll purchase more. theres others heffey's out there, try them first."
"Very soft on the palate, mellow carbonation. Light to medium body. I could definitely quaff this. Maybe I should revisit this brewery."
"D: This is an easy-drinking, poundable kind of beer, due to the smoothness and mild flavor. This was decent beer. The best thing I can say about it is that it’s perfect for the beer-drinker looking to take their first step out of the macro rut."
"This Magic Hat offering pours a murky off-orange with a scrubby head. The nose is dominated by lemony citrus smells. The palate starts with a big citrus burst that is then attentuated by wheat but finishes with a ton of sour acidity. Mouthfeel is crisp and even thoughout. Overall, the flavors in this beer aren't incredibly great or anything, but they are interesting, which is a step up for most American wheat beers. This is one of the better Magic Hat brews I've had recently."
"Poured a a cloudy cross of lemonade and iced tea with a thinner white head that had no lasting power,at first the aromas struck me as unappetizing but after a minute it was better had like a wet grain element but the lemon and slight cloviness showed up after a minute.Wheat malt flavors are large here and toasted cereal grain with the lemon and clove taking a backseat although noticable mainly in the finish.You know its not half bad I am not a huge fan of American wheat ales but this has character a little rough around the edges but its worthy of having a few on warm spring day I think."
"The label says ""unfiltered and unfettered"". The unfiltered part I get, but I'm not sure about the unfettered part. The beer was a hazy yellow with a fairly small head that lingered. It had a sweet, grainy aroma. Taste-wise, it was mostly sweet, with a slight citrus flavor. Nothing too special. The bottles I had left a sour taste in my mouth, so mouthfeel was average. An OK , but not great, beer."
"Pours cloudy with a hint of orange, and a bunch of yeasty chunks that I let settle and made sure NOT to drink (yuck!). Otherwise, it's unfiltered so that's normal. It's got a nice foamy head on it also, moderate lacing and carbonation. Smells of light fruits (bananas), yeasts, and malts. Taste follows well with a refreshing light sweetness and acrid yeastiness with smooth malty foundations. Easy drinker."
"12 oz bottle, best by the end of May, poured into an imperial pint glass, this is a deep hazy gold with a huge off-white rocky head that takes it's time to subside. Scattered fingers of lace. Nose is a subdued clove and wheat mixture, and a slight lemon note. Taste is a grainy wheat with an almost tart lemon, finishes with a very gentle spice note. Bit on the thin side of medium. This is a decent easy drinking beer, but nothing really stands out, and this probably isn't a beer I'll purchase again."
"A very drinkable and enjoyable hefe. I just wish it was a little hotter out."
"Overall, I have to say, this is just another average effort from a brewery that has yet to life up to the hype I hear of their work."
"Drinkability: not very impressive to me. I like my hefe's more crisp and refreshing."
"How appropriate, the circus is in town this week. Good time to try this beer. Lots of sediment in this one. A careful pour produces a cloudy but vibrant amberish-yellow beer with an off-white, foamy, medium-sized head that quickly diminishes to a thick film. The smell is mild and sweet with plenty of fruit, most notably apple and white grape, with light citrus and berry. Reminiscent of champagne. Some mild grain and slightly off-putting yeast. Tastes kind of like a wheat wine cooler. A little less fruity than the nose while still remaining vinous. Its fairly thin and lively with a finish that turns a bit bready, followed up by a chalkiness very late in the finish. Definitely a different one and worth trying out their interesting take on the style."
"Starts out pretty nice but by the end, I'm thinking I'm ingesting lemon Pledge. Still, pretty good for a hot day and in that odd Magic Hat tradition, has crossover appeal."

"I will make this beer a regular at my bbqs this summer."
"This one is tasty all around and a bit different from most hefeweizens (listed here as an American Pale Wheat but MH labels it a hefeweizen and I agree, so that's what I'm calling it). It's certainly got more of an interesting flavour than I've tasted within the style in some time. I'd be more than happy to have this one again."
"Pretty drinkable....but not really a hefe, right ??...no banana or clove...to me, tastes more like a saison. Either way, pretty good brew."
"Update: Another review is in order - I tried a sample of this recently and it had none of the above negatives, and was actually rather good."
"The remarkable lemon-orange-grapefruit twang bended like notes on my Telecaster playing Delta Blues. I was taken aback by the smooth light taste that reminded me of a Hefeweisen I had on tap in a street cafe in NYC last summer. It might have been a garish idea, but an orange slice would have been good with this."
"Drinkability: The ale is surprisingly good (when I think of other magic hat ales, that is). The wheat gives it a refreshing quality that is perfect for the summer months."
"M & D: Great on the palate. Not heavy but almost in a way, light and very smooth. Great for a summer's afternoon. Drinkability is high--I would have a bunch of these."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light pale and wheat malt scent that has a nice lemony zest and yeast earthiness. The taste is decent also. It has a crisp, wheat bite with loads of lemon zest and a somewhat earthy finish. There are some hops present to round out the flavor. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This a refreshing beer that is highly drinkable, but it's low on my list of wheat beers on the market."
"Served in a pint glass, this beer is a cloudy golden color with a clean white head that quickly dissipates. Slightly sour aroma. The taste is fairly typical of the style, although better done than some. Wheat flavor, peppery, a little bit of bitter hops. No banana flavor of note. A fairly light, easy drinking beer."
"This is quite a refreshing and drinkable beer. However, other than the appearance - there isn't much about this brew that makes it a wheat beer. This ""American Pale Wheat"" category really leaves a lot of room for interpretation."
"Mouthfeel is yeasty, medium bodied, dust-like, and semi dry. Looking for a little bit more ""oomph"" out of a wheat beer with some smooth vanilla and subtle banana in the background. Unfortunately, doesn't hold up to the likes of the German wheats."
"D - high, if you dont mind a lemony beer, otherwise it'd be lower"
"I've had many worse American ""wheat ales," but this one certainly can't touch its German counterparts that come in the big bottles. Not a bad beer for $7/sixpack, and one I would consider again for a barbecue or warm-weather meal."
"Pours a cloudy straw color. Foamy one finger,head with nice retention and lacing. Smell is light,and is of malt,yeast and spice.Body is medium and carbonated. Taste is spicy with a hint of lemon, and hops in the finish. Had a bit more of a bite than some of the other wheats I've tried. Not bad at all!"
"the beer."
"Interesting but not great. The bitterness seems slightly full for what it is. I'd rather see a touch more sweetness in play with the pepper and lemon. In comparison with other examples of the style, however, it's at least got some character to it. Worth trying."
"Not too shabby for the style but most folks would probably be happier with an authentic hefe weiss."
"Medium bodied with a medium ammount of carbonation. A really easy to drink beer, I'd love to grip a sixer of these on a hot summer day"
"Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and sudsy, slick. A bit chewy. Overall a highly drinkable brew, I'm surprised it doesn't have a higher rating. This would be great on a hot summer day, or with some great Chinese."
" Overall im not the least bit impressed by this offering. not recomended. Buy something else"
"I enjoy hefeweizens, so i trully enjoyed this beer. As first taste I thought it tasted familar from a Magic hat mystery beer from last year. The rep said i was right that 370 was the basis for this recipe. If you liked 370 then i would definetly suggest you give this a try. Unlike many hefeweizens you dont need the lemon though. it already has enough lemon in it to make it very drinkable. I think it will be a good summer beer and will be competing with my UFO drinking."
"The taste was also citrusy. It was a very crisp taste. It left something of a carbonated feeling in your mouth, even after you swallowed it. It goes down smoothly. Very enjoyable. I'm looking forward to the other two in the box!"
"Taste was...eh. Not bad, but not impressive. Malty, a slight peppery spice, and hints of banna, but somewhat muddled and not overly impressive. I as expecting more, but this circus was just a side show."
"Though I didnt dislike this one, I wasnt crazy about it either, but then again I guess pale wheat ales just arent my thing. While it is quite drinkable and refreshing with a fairly crisp hop bite as well as some pleasant hints of clove and hay, its also just a tad bit watery with a flavor that doesnt really satisfy. So, although I had no problem finishing off the three bottles of this that came in the Joes Garage variety 12-pack, I wouldnt buy a six-pack of it. I would recommend this one only to those who really dig pale wheat ales."
"Mouth feel is light bodied and actively carbonated."
"This pours a cloudy yellow orange with a large foamy white head. The smell has a earthy aroma to it along with lemon and a nuttyness to it. The taste is very lemony with alot of carbonation. The aftertaste has a nuttyness with some carmel,very refreshing. The m/f is light and well balanced. This is a good brew and would have this again.Good job Magic Hat."
"Excellent for what it is -- a gateway/session beer. I generally like extreme beers with huge hops, but now and then crave a nice refreshing hefeweizen, and Circus Boy fits the bill. (Almost a pun there.) Creamy mouthfeel, taste is lemony with a touch of apricot. Toned down but not as pallid as many American wheats. A good companion to Magic Hat's terrific flagship brew Number 9. Extremely drinkable. Bizarro (and appealing) name and label."
"12 ouncer from the Joe's Garage box offering. label provides 'best to drink before dating"" Pours cloudy, dull light orange, with a white head, lots of frothy lacing. Sour, soapy nose. This is a mish mosh of a wheat beer, some bananas, ginger, slight sourness picked up. Mouthfeel is a bit too thin and the flavors dont really come together. Not MH's best effort. C'mon MH, this is a crowd pleasing style, but this effort doesn't seem to have hit the mark."
"Poured a dirty peach color with attractive white puffy hat. Nice lacing on the side of the glass. Smell is yeasty, spicy, and somewhat citrusy. Taste brings out the wheat, but very little spiciness, but lots of oranges and lemon. There seems to a strong tang to the taste. I'm not sure if its from the hops but I am enjoying it more and more with each taste. Finish is pleasant and loaded with more citrus, and what I can best describe as a ""ginger ale"" feeling in the back of the mouth?? This is a good beer. Not quite what I was expecting, but I did enjoy it. Thanks to phatz for the trade."
"Overall an unexciting beer from the boys in Vermont."
"mf/d- Very carbonated. The feel is slick and wet but not to heavy. This is not very drinkable, and a weak attempt at the style. I know they can do better, and dumping in a shitload of lemons doesn't do it from me."
"from the 1810 crew..."
"Golden yellow, barely hazy. Nice white head though. Smells of lemon and with a little yeast and sour wheat. Taste is pleasant but lackluster, there are hops somewhere in there, some sweet wheat malts, some more sourness and citrus. Easy drinking, but not that enticing to have many more. Its a pretty pale wheat beer, something for the uninitiated maybe."
"Clouded gold, fat white frothy head. Lemony aroma, with hints of sourish wheat and banana. Some clove. Lemony wheat flavor right up front. The lemon seems kind of artificial, like it doesn't belong in the flavor profile. If this is the Batch 370, I liked it much better in it's previous incarnation, a much more authentic bavarian feel. Dryish and powdery mouthfeel, a sparkling carbonation keeps things lively. Seems like there's fairly strong citrusy hops, which feels out of place with this beer. Then again, the citrus feels like more the product of one of those lemon shaped lemon juice bottles than hops or actual lemon. Kinda wierd. It is refreshing, and satisfies my desire for a beer, but I'd be happier with something else. Not quite what I want for late winter."
"Poured a slightly cloudy copper yellow color with a solid inch head which quickly receded. Average carbonation, with nothing out of the ordinary to note appearance wise. Has a sweet aroma and lemon-citrus taste that really stands out. Lively taste on the tongue from the carbonation with a rather watery mouthfeel. Bottle advertises ""unfiltered and unfettered", but other than a very slightly cloudy color, no matter how close I examine it I do not see anything in the beer. I'd say Magic Hat has created a good Pale Wheat Ale that has good drinkability, but I think I'm going to stick with their IPA."
"I am still scratching my head over this one. I was expecting a standard American Wheat called a Hefe, but what I got was neither. In some weird hybrid they manage to make a interesting Hefe. A orange body lays under a dense white head pour that fades to no head in sort order. I liked the first bottle better that being the warm one; it tasted bolder, but suffered with some extra thickness in the body. Good citrus and wheat smell, a touch of spice and a some bready-yeast for measure. The taste is quite dynamic, it moves from wheat beer Americano to Hefe clove citrus and back again. Good beer my only complaint and not really is that it seem too thick, but it is a good drinker and something to session."
"Cheers!"
"Hazy apricot colored with an eggshell white head that settles quickly, but leaves legs of lace rising up. Faint aroma of yeastiness and some florally hops, perhaps some honey and lemon. Flavor seems muted upfront, a bit of yeast perhaps, and seems to rise up toward the finish as some peppery spiciness kicks up, followed by some bubblegum, band-aid phenols, and lemon zest. Mouthfeel is full and round, perhaps too much for the style, I was expecting it to be a little drier and crisp."
"Great to see a new release from Magic Hat. This beer has a good drinkability level and will help ease in the warmer months ahead."
"D- This beer is as interesting as its name, a nice surprise coming from Magic Hat. One of the first American Wheat Ales that does not make me think ""summer seasonal"". They took a somewhat pedestrian style and added some flare to it, this one gets a thumbs up from me."
