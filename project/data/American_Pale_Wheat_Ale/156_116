3.2,-5.9,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.25,"Pours a hazy gold, producing a somewhat lasting, foamy, white head that leaves slim motes, streaks & wisps of lace. Aroma is sweet wheat, lemony citrus & a hint of grass. Taste is a tug-of-war between wheat, lemon & mineral water prickly carbonation with hint of grain & grass. Tongue numbing mineral/carbonation bite in the finish blocks the flavors which reappear as mineral, wheat & lemon in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with intense carbonation, crisp, very prickly but creamy among the spice bite. This pale wheat ale screams Berliner Weissbier.","mothmanscott","Mar 01, 2015"

3.5,2.9,,,,,,"These wheat-based beers do not produce much in the way of lasting head. I initially had two fingers of fizzing, bone-white head before it simply fell to wisps.  Color was a very cloudy Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 -5) and I will readily cop to agitating it to get the lees back into suspension. Nose had a very pleasant lemoniness to it and my mouth began to water at the thought. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. Taste had an immediate tartness on the tongue that slowly revealed itself as its inherent lemony flavor. Finish was dry and even slightly puckering with a lingering lip-smacking quality. Another perfect Summer beer that I wonder how it would fly during other times of the year.","woodychandler","Aug 25, 2014"

The nose comprises light wheat, very light grass, and a decent smattering of watered-down lemonade. The taste brings in more of the same, with the lemonade definitely not watered-down anymore: it's in your face, together with a bit of orange rind for good measure. Things on the tongue just spiting the absolute hell out of the label for it's fallacious ""hint of citrus"" comment. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, just too much citrus for this stuff to work, especially considering the consequent lack of any other character.","TMoney2591","Mar 28, 2013"

The taste was once again of light lemon and wheat. The mouthfeel allowed no other flavors through, It actually lessened the flavors. I thought that this beer was decent for a wheat ale ( which is my thus far least favorite type of beer ), However after looking at the freshness date, Which was 07/06/2009, I could understand why it was as bland as it was. I was drinking it 3 years passed it's freshness date. Had it been fresh, It would have probably been my favorite wheat ale, but given what I was, It wasn't that impressive.

I liked Jack Wacker and it ranks up there as one of the better ones from the six pack so far.

Lots of carbonation on the palate that wasn't apparent on the head. Tastes like a buttered piece of sourdough bread with just a dab of honey. It's somewhat wheaty, but not nearly as much as many other wheat beers. I agree with the reviewers who said that it has a ""chalky"" element to its taste.

Yeast gives a bit of chalky character amongst everything else going on slightly spicy finish this brew would pair nicely with some Thai food. Mouthfeel is spritzy with carbonation really cleans the palate with fine bubbles, sharp acidity does add a bit of dryness. A nice light bodied wheat ale, that does a good job of not being a boring bland pale wheat ale that I've come to expect with most American micros.

Once finished, he spun the bottle back and forth (palms of hand on the bottle, Mr. Miyagi stlye) to collapse the wheat and pour the foamy head on top. Then, garnished with a slice of lemon.

Tastes of lemon up front, but not just lemon juice. It's more of a lemon with a zesty/earthy kick, probably from the lemon grass added. After the lemon comes some slight spice, and then finishes with a smooth sweet malt flavor.

The nose has a lemon-pepper smell to it, but is quite mild in all categories. The lemon is very noticeable, and actually adds a very interesting dimension to this beer. There's a lot of sweetness too, but not anything usually associated with wheat beers. Still, it's a fun departure. The mouth is light, with a mellow carbonation.

Obvious wheat taste with a nice mouthfeel (again thanks to the wheat); but surprisingly drinkable and tasty. I find that if I enjoy every sip, looking forward to the next all the way to the bottom of the glass, I give the beer a thumbs up.

The mouthfeel was nice as well, with a subtle cloying effect followed by a warm sensation that outlasted the aftertaste.

Near the end it is very dark and looks like cider with a bit of a head. It smells of toasty/grainy malts with sweet wheat, some fruitiness, citrus, and perhaps molasses - a combination I haven't met yet, but I like it. The flavor follows suit, but with a low bitterness, almost no hops detectable by taste, and a light body. I could drink a few of these in a row, but I imagine it's a better summer beer.","mmmbeer","Nov 10, 2005"
3.32,-2.4,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This is an okay beer for a hot day or with some asian or hot/spicy food of what ever ilk.","russpowell","Sep 24, 2005"
3.5,2.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Appearance is a hazy yellow with a nice white head that quickly disappeared. Aroma has wheat and citrus. Initial taste is coriander and lemon with notes of yeast and some hops. The citrus in the middle dissipates tot a dry finish. Might be good with some foods.","palliko","Jul 14, 2005"
3.57,5,3.5,4,3.5,4,3,"Pours a cloudy amber/yellow with a small short-lived bubbly head. Nose is of citrus, grass, wheat, and hops. Taste follows suit - Very lemony (the front label says it's flavored with lemon grass) with a hoppy finish. Very refreshing in the humid Wisconsin summer. Not sure I could drink a ton of them as the lemon grass is rather overpowering, but one or two would be a refreshing start to a session. An interesting brew.","Golden2wenty1","Jul 10, 2005"
2.31,-32.1,3.5,2.5,2,2,2.5,"Dark golden color, hazy bodt with little head. Smell is sweet, like artificial banana flavoring was added. Taste is more like a Engl;ish Pale ale than a wheat beer, murky underpowered hops, and slight fruity flavors are the only things going on in this one. As a pale wheat, not that good.","TastyTaste","Jun 18, 2005"
2.46,-27.6,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2," Mouthfeel is to light over carbonated just to fizzy for my liking. Drinkability is well bad has to be the worst wheat beer I have had to date. Thanks go to merlin48 for the sample though just can't win them all.","mntlover","Mar 07, 2005"
2.34,-31.2,2,3,2,2,2.5,"This one is crisp and refreshing, but so is carbonated water.","merlin48","Jan 19, 2005"
4.2,23.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Finally, a Tommyknocker beer that I like. It is a cloudy, orangish yellow color and had a foamy white head that disappeared in a hurry. It smell of lemons and has distinct wheat malt notes. If it wasn't for the lemon grass zing in the aroma it would be average, but the lemony aroma is very pleasing. The flavor is very tart... lemon and grassy, but very drinkable, especially on a hot day. This beer actually benefits from the thin body that all Tommyknocker beers seem to have. With so many good summer beers available it will be hard to revisit this beer.","RushLimbmalt","Nov 15, 2004"
2.3,-32.4,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,"This beer pours a light golden color with very little head and no lacing. The aroma was a little skunky. Nothing much more than that. The flavor had a lemon and grass taste. I really didn't enjoy this beer very much. I've not been terribly impressed with the beers from this company, and this falls into place. Not much else to say about it.","clvand0","Nov 08, 2004"
3.08,-9.4,4,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,"The beer pours a clear golden color with less than a finger of head that falls quickly. The nose is mostly sweet wheat with a bit of a citrusy hop finish. The beer is light on flavor, with a sweet wheat flavor being most dominant. There's not much hop coming through. The beer is rather light in my mouth, not what I was expecting. It would be easy to sit down and drink many of these, but I wouldn't really want to have this beer again due to the lack of flavor and watered down taste, I would drink it again, but it's definately not the best wheat I've had.","kmpitz2","Aug 07, 2004"
3.13,-7.9,2.5,2,3.5,3,4,"Added the next day: After further review, it appears that skunky smell is from the tap water I used to rinse the soap residue off the glass. I guess I need to install my water filters.","masterbruewer","Jun 27, 2004"
3.94,15.9,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Semi-cloudy, off-yellow hue, thin fluffy paper white head. Has a decent citrus aroma, some apple peel detection. Crisp and tarty, a solid light ale. Becomes rather sweet, the palate is quickly grazed nicely with some fruit, banana and apple notes in the tasting; lemon grass notes later on, with a tender amount of hops. A quickly dissolving aftertaste; yet a lemony feel on the palate. Solid unfiltered ale, perhaps a bit under-rated on the scales, not as sour or as sweet as some beers, yet it's just a simple, laid back wheat. A solid offering here.","GeoffRizzo","Jun 10, 2004"
2.11,-37.9,3,2,2,2.5,2,"I didn't enjoy the citrus tones this beer had to offer, I think without the lemon grass this would have been a good beer. I think I'll skip this one next time.","coasterfreak75","Apr 06, 2004"
3.18,-6.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Its cloudy yellow-gold body is capped by a decent-sized head of creamy bright-white foam that holds really well and leaves some splashes of lace here and there about the glass. The nose is clean, and delivers the expected delicate tartness and grainy wheatiness of an American wheat beer along with a soft, bready sweetness and subtle note of lemon-grass. The lemon grass becomes more apparent as it warms and adds a unique and refreshing character. The body is distinctly medium; and it's nicely creamy and smooth in the mouth due to its very fine, natural carbonation. Lightly sweet and bready wheat malt dominates the palate with just a subtle accent of fruit (even banana?). And although it's sweetish, it's still fairly well-balanced and finishes nicely dry with just a mild, lightly acidic note of cookie-dough-like malt. The tartness suggested by the nose is just barely present in the flavor other than the finish; and the lemon grass doesn't seem to have left any significant contribution other than to help balance the doughy malt in the aftertaste. It's an interesting twist on an American wheat that takes the ball but just doesn't run with it.","NeroFiddled","Nov 17, 2003"
2.92,-14.1,2.5,3,3,2.5,3,"Pours a murky straw color with a thin white head. Quick lacing. Aroma is light hops and spice. Light bodied with flavors of citrus, floral hops and very little wheat. Finish is rather crisp and carbonated. This is a mediocre beer overall, but not bad on the scale of other American Wheats I have tried.","Dogbrick","Jun 30, 2003"
2.38,-30,3,2.5,2,3,2.5,"This brew pours a large head of fine and medium sized white bubbles with a cloudy straw yellow body. It has a mild bread-fruit aroma with a slight initial tingle then its fruit flavor and the lemon come on. Acceptable, but somehow I just don't care that ,much for the lemon flavoring.","TheDM","Jun 21, 2003"
3.12,-8.2,2.5,3,3,2.5,4,"When poured into my glass this brew had a large white frothy head with mostly fine bubbles. The body was cloudy and the hue was straw. It had a lemon aroma to it and a taste of lemon along with an acidic taste. This brew had good lacing. It tasted thin and a bit watery. This brew lacked character as nothing really special stood out with this particular American Wheat. It was on the flat side in my opinion.","hotstuff","Jun 20, 2003"
2.13,-37.4,3,2.5,2,1.5,2,"Farily light goden color hazy beer topped by a moderate, but loosely formed, white head. The head fades rather quickly. A hint of yeast on the aroma gives way quickly to a wheat crispness and some citrus notes. The taste is rather light, exhibiting little yeast qualities. There is a substantial crispness to the beer, as well as a decent citrus note, presumably from the hops. The body is very thin, almost watery. Drinkability is poor, as the watery body and the citrus notes remind me more of lemonade than a wheat beer/ wheat ale. This is about as enjoyable as a kick in the groin after the Erdinger I had earlier.","aaronh","May 27, 2003"
2.6,-23.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Color is a cloudy medium gold, I poured the sediment in - after all it is a wheat beer. It poured with a medium head that disappeared rather quickly - nice lace though. Aroma is very subtle - by the third sniff I couldn't even smell it any more. Flavor is nothing special. Kind of lemony bitter with a touch of malt and hops. If this beer was clear it would almost be a macro - almost, but not quite that bland. Wheats were never my favorite, and this one is no exception. It's not a bad brew, it's just not my style.","sabrills70","May 20, 2003"
2.67,-21.5,3,3.5,2,3.5,2.5,"Turbid pale golden in color, topped by a thin, spotty white head that leaves isolated aggregates of foam. Tart lemon grass and doughy, maltose like sweetness upfront in aroma, ensued by understated banana esters and token grainy wheat. Sticky, sucrose sweetness hits the palate at first, then is ceded by a brief snap of hop bitterness then mild notes of stale cracker and cracked wheat. Suggestions of cold, chunky cream of wheat drizzled with lemon and confectioners sugar. Decently proteinaceous mouthfeel. Finishes with notes of vanilla and soured cream. An odd, off balanced brew that approaches cloying in its sweetness. Not an improvement on the typical insipid American wheat. At least they're clean.","marc77","Mar 23, 2003"
3.67,7.9,3.5,4,3.5,3,4,"The beer pours a lightly chill hazed golden orange color with the head adequate in size and the texture frothy with lots of fine lace to conceal the glass. The aroma of yeast, the typical Bread Dough description fits nicely, citrus crisp and fresh. Start is sweet with the top middling in feel, the finish sparsely hopped, moderately carbonated and the aftertaste typically dry. Drinkable beer, but overall quite plain and nothing separates it from a million other beers, so the average rating applies per my rating criteria.","Gusler","Dec 26, 2002"
3.85,13.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The beer looks fairly viscous as it glugs into my glass.  Very murky golden with shades of orange.  No head.  Just a rimming.  Fairly light odor for a weizen, but there are some nice subtle notes of lemon, pepper and citrus.  Body of this beer is between medium and medium-full.  The taste begs for your attention.  (I understand why this is in the herb and spice category now.)  This doesn't taste like your typical hefe weizen.  The lemon grass adds a nice touch though.  A thirst quenching taste that makes you want to keep drinking more, and fast.  Pretty decent beer here.","Bighuge","Oct 28, 2002"
3.48,2.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Jack Wacker.....cool name..even more interesting beer....Lemon grass eh???  Now that's unique...you can definitely taste it...the nose is pretty mellow but there are hints of citrus evident.  I don't get the typical wheat flavor, but it is very drinkable and thirst quenching...very little carbonation...solid and unique...a good combo in my book...","ZAP","Oct 16, 2002"
3.95,16.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This unfiltered wheat ale pours with a slightly hazy golden color and a thin, yet lasting head.  The aroma is nicely balanced between malt and the addition of lemon grass which imparts (surprise) a slightly lemony character to the perfume. The flavor is very close to that of a true German hefeweizen with an addition of a lemon tartness that grows from the sip to the finish.  Very interesting and tasty brew.","beernut7","Sep 01, 2002"
4.07,19.7,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Notes: Very drinkable and makes for a great hot weather brew ... nice addition of lemon grass in the brew to kick it up a notch.","Jason","Apr 10, 2002"
