4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer poured an opaque orange to straw yellow with a lot of sediment.  I poured about 3/4 of it in my glass, activated the yeast, and poured the rest. The aroma was sweet and spicy with hints of cloves and orange.  I may have detected a bit of honey in the sweet but it could have been my mind making me taste it due to the name. The taste was full of the same spice and orange all riding the honey sweet body.  It was not like honey nut cheerios sweet but rather a good full beer sweetness.  The orange and spice fully emerge as the beer warmed and even gave the Blood and Honey a bit of tartness.  I could also detect the base wheat beer flavors of clove and bananas underneath the orange.  The full bodied brew offered a wonderful take on a standard wheat beer.  I love blood oranges and the blood and honey highlights those flavors.  A winner in my book.","brurevu","Jan 08, 2015"

The smell of oranges and honey is enticing. A cloudy yellow - orange color with a bit of sediment apparent, which is natural for an unfiltered beer.

The sweetness of the beer stands out to a lot of people, and some people just don't like it. However, it think it adds a nice refreshing quality to the beer and it's something I could enjoy outside on a hot summer day with no problems, and I've done it at their location. This is their most popular beer by far, and it's the one that they are bottling currently too. They're still a small operation as far as breweries are concerned but they have been growing very quickly.","firefightn24","Aug 01, 2014"

Smells of citrus notes not overpowering. Taste is sweet, lemon, orange, a slight boozyness. Finishes sharp. Very refreshing, drinkable, and unique.","zander4dawin","Jul 17, 2014"
4.14,6.7,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.25,"This is a very pale straw-colored beer with a small head, that fades pretty quickly. The nose is excellent, with a sweet light maltiness, lots of wheat, and tart citrus peel notes, the latter very wit-like. The taste is interesting and unique. The malt is much more prominent than I expected--it's even a little heady. Citrus isn't as prominent as in the nose, but it's still detectable. There is some subtle, not really identifiable spiciness, perhaps from the yeast used. Very good beer!","allengarvin","Jul 16, 2014"

A:  I love the appearance of an unfiltered wheat. Hazy and golden in the glass. S:  You can really smell the spice and the honey from the glass. T:  nice and light. Get the spice and hint of orange off the nose with a clean finish. Reminds me of a more flavorful Oberon. No hint of booze, really well blended. Also with a light and refreshing mouth feel. Overall, I am really impressed with this beer. Being from Chicago, I'd never even heard of it before. I would say it's one of my new favorites of the style. Great summer beer.","Tex_hex","Jun 11, 2014"

In the nose, touches of citrus peel blend with honey to give the brew a smooth, creamsicly aroma. The flavor has the same aspect, though more pronounced wheat here adds notes of banana and apple before a lingering finish of earthy honey. This, along with a pillowy medium body and mild carbonation, make Blood and Honey eminently drinkable.","Phelps","May 25, 2013"
