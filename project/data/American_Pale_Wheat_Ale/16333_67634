The wheat flavor remains solid, and the yeast adds a light touch of chalkiness and (seemingly) some light spiciness - in that sense it's more like a Belgian witbier than a Bavarian Hefeweizen. I'm quite sure they're using a Belgian strain; and, in fact, have intended a Belgian-style wit with a bit of citrusy American hops thrown in. And it works. It's still refreshing and balanced but the citrusy/piney hops give it an unexpected twist and an added component of complexity. Nicely done!","NeroFiddled","Dec 27, 2012"

Color was a fizzy, hazy golden-yellow and I raised a toast as a wussy to Greg Koch. Nose was really clean, with a peppery spiciness up front accompanied by a slight fruitiness and a light mintiness. I do not know what I was expecting, but that was not it! Mouthfeel was fairly full, thanks to all of the carbonation and the taste was subtle, less intense than on the nose, but with all of the characteristics noted earlier. The peppery bite really came through on the finish, making it very dry, indeed.

4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Big foaming bright white head, atop a clouded golden orange body with fine intricate lacing going down the sides of the glass. Aroma has sharp wheat notes with hints of citrus, mild herbal hops in the nose. Straight forward good tasting American pale wheat, sharp wheat hints of acidity with chalky powdered yeast cakes in the finish. Extremely drinkable light hop character, but the zesty lemon character really makes this a refreshing beer, I'm glad to hear that it went year round. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied but the yeast character gives it some added girth...healthy carbonation level finishes evenly balanced between sweet malts/wheat and dry yeast with herbal citrus character. Ovrall very tasty American wheat out of the can, I love seeing canned offerings out there that taste this good, the first 12 ounce offering I've seen from Tallgrass most of their other beers come in pounder 16 ounce cans.","WVbeergeek","Mar 12, 2012"

Deep smoothness leads to a lean crispness, which really opens this beer up. A wheat malt bomb in a way. Bready, yet semidry with a mild nuttiness in the middle. Modest showing of balancing hops. Lemongrass, earthy yeast, doughy biscuit and a very faint saltiness display some complexities. Finishes clean and grainy. Halcyon ends up being a nearly perfect snapshot of what an American Pale Wheat Ale should be, especially for a style that perhaps doesn’t get enough love. No bells or whistles, just a great wheat beer.","BeerAdvocate","Dec 14, 2011"

4.03,5.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is two inches of billowy eggshell white colored foam that recedes at a glacial pace into a fluffy cap of lacing. The aroma is of lemon, tangerines, and some tangy wheat. It is a very vibrant aroma. The taste is full of citrus fruit with a hint of tang. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a chewy texture, and lively carbonation. Overall, this is a very impressive American Pale Wheat Ale. It has far more flavor that nearly every other beer I've had of this style. I am a much bigger fan of Hefes, and would almost always choose one over a Pale Wheat Ale. However, I this beer is good enough that I could see myself drinking it again.","KarlHungus","Jun 17, 2011"
