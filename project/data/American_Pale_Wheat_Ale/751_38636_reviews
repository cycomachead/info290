"Overall the beer was refreshing and tasty.  It had just enough hoppy flavor to make it interesting without making it too bitter for a wheat beer.  It would be a great beer for a hot summer day."
""
"I love it when a beer exceeds my expectations. The name and packaging of Trout Slayer appeal to my fishing problem, but I'm not a huge fan of this style of beer. This beer pours with enough head to remind you it's had its Wheaties. The color is a beautiful gold and the nose is full of wheat goodness. The taste is bright, full of citrus and fresh baked bread. Tasting Trout Slayer is like finding a big Cutty in six inches of water - a very pleasant surprise!"

"Presentation: Packaged in a standard twelve-ounce aluminum can, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"This is very clean for a wheat without the big esters found in many European interpretations. The nose is herbal and citrus with more hop action than yeast. It pours crystal clear pale gold and the thick fluffy head confirms the presence of wheat, along with the rich texture. Grainy malt on the palate carries hoppy spice into the finish. Medium carbonation and body. Easy to drink."

"It's an outstanding American Wheat Ale."

"O: Nice light wheat ale, but not overly complex or special. Would indeed be very nice while fishing."

"Final Thoughts: This one really hit the spot, which I suppose is the whole point of a wheat ale. Nicely done by a brewery that surprises me a little bit with every offering I try. Would I drink it again? Sure. (3.75)"
""
""
""
"Overall  a drinkable if not exceptional beer.  This one paired well with a traditional Jamaican Jerked chicken at a spicy level."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not a bad brew. Not great, but not bad. Plenty of other brews of this style are much better for the same money. Its worth a try, but I wouldn't get too wound up about it."

"Overall – Nothing too outstanding, but refreshing and easy drinking none the less. A sort of average wheat ale overall."
""
"Flavor: buttery white rolls, grassy wheat, some surprising bitter citrus hop flavor in the middle and finish."

"D: A decent session beer. Nice in what it offers, but very straightforward."
""
""
"I normally do not try wheat beers and I was not going to buy this but God am I glad i did. This is a really terrific beer. I honestly think this beer is underrated on this site. This is defiantly one of my new favorite beers and I will definitely buy again and recommend to everyone."
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all a very good wheat, not great but very good. Flavorful but not heavy, plenty of nuances but not overbearing. I'd drink this again and probably while I'm fishing...it has a great fishing label that's as cool as this beer is good."
""
"O=I think this would pair well with a summer barbecue chicken more than a stand alone beer. I would likely purchase on tap if eating with a tangy barbecue chicken."
"Pours a golden yellow in color with close to a finger of a white head that settles down to a thin layer on top. Some spotty lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma is of wheat with some citrus, maybe lemon. The taste is about the same with a perfect wheat flavor with some citrus peel for the finish with a light taste of honey also. Very smooth and goes down easy with no bitter aftertaste at all. Perfect carbonation. Great year-around brew."
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely recommended, especially on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a great american wheat beer. It's hard to beat boulevard unfiltered wheat ale, but this is still a great beer. Worth a shot. I've enjoyed the two beers I've tried from Big Sky so far, great bottle art too. Moose drool is great for brown ale fans."
""
"One of the most interesting wheat ales that I have ever had. Tons of flavor packed into this 5.0% abv beer. Would love to drink this really cold on a really hot summer day. Too bad I can't get it back in CT."
""
""
""
"O: Straightforward easy drinking ale, reminds me of a slightly hoppy lager."
""
""
""
""
"This is a really nice beer! Poured at a good temperature with decent sized, foamy, cream-colored head that settled after a bit and lots of lace. Color is a clear yellow with several lazy bubble trails. Aroma is primarily hops, plus citrus, yeast, spice. Flavor’s like nose, also has bold carbonic tang that works well with the hop bitter, quite dry, and clean. Body is just right with bright carbonation. Finish is like flavor, of average length, and very drinkable."

"O. Overall this is a great session beer. It's low ABV make it a perfect take along on my next fishing trip. I also feel that this beer is a great way to introduce craft beer to adjunct drinkers. This beer is also a good food companion since it leaves a clean finsh."
"I enjoyed this unique interpretation of a summer wheat ale, probably because I really like German dunkel Weiss."

"Big wheat bread notes up front - high carbonation keeps things lively. Ends dry and nutty. Some faint, tart berry notes and some nice bitter citrus interplay. This is a very good wheat beer. it has a nice malt bill and more hop bitterness than most."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall-I like the color. Everything else leaves a little to be desired."
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Not bad. A decent wheat beer without any flaws, but there's also nothing to get excited about. Just a good, solid brew. It would make a good session beer."

"The aroma of this beer actually overwhelms you in their tasting room where they are serving a lot of other brews. It also has a head that won't quit. I really like this beer."
"An incredible Pale Wheat Ale ... a nice, big flavor, a pleasant hop presence, and a great first beer I've had out of Montana. You have to try this one."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty and enjoyable wheat ale."
"O - Good beer. I've had better from Big Sky. I could imagine putting a few of these back whilst flicking a jig."
""
""
"Pours a clear golden with almost no head. Smell is of green apple and some grain. Taste begins with some light caramel, then some bread, followed by some mint, anise and fennel flavors. An herbal, tart finish. Mouthfeel is good, though carbonation a bit low. Overall a good beer."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 3/7/2013. Pours hazy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, pepper, orange zest, wheat, clove, bread, floral, grass, herbal, and light banana. Very nice aromas with good strength and balance of malt and hop notes. Taste of lemon, pear, pepper, orange peel, wheat, clove, floral, grass, bread, herbal, and light banana. Lingering notes of citrus, light fruit, pepper, wheat, clove, floral, grass, herbal, and light banana on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance of citrus, malt, and spicy hop flavors; with a good amount of robustness for 5%; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice pale what ale! Very nice balance of citrus, malt, and hop flavors; and extremely smooth to drink with plenty of flavor. Really enjoyed this one."

"I usually don't like beers with deceiving names. But Big Sky's Trout Slayer is one exception. This is what I call a mild wheat beer, very refreshing and easy to drink. The smell was a tad unusual, with hints of grape and apple. It almost smelled like a cider. Besides that aspect I enjoyed drinking the Trout Slayer. Drinking a few of these will make you believe you're a decent fly fisherman. Now go slay some trout!"
""
"Poured this American Wheat Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a nice white head, great retention and excellent lacing. The aroma consisted of fresh baked bread. Medium bodied, there is a foundation of malted wheat, floral hop flavor and it has a semi dry finish. Great session beer, smooth and a big dose of hops. Probably my favoirte American Pale Wheat Ale."
""
"Again, an easy drinking beer that would be great on a hot afternoon, but for the price give me a Hop Hog any day."

"overall, for a weak abv, straw-colored whatever they wanna call it, it's okay. can drink many in succession, for certain, but would you want to? there is a certain richness to it, as a hefe might be, so that may slow down your session. but it's drinkable. it's likable. it's way better than the commercial crap i was originally comparing it to. for montana, i imagine this might be a 'lady's beer' ? ?"

"OK for a wheat beer. Refreshing and a good summer brew."
""
""
""
"12oz bottle, pours clearer than expected, golden with a white head that holds good retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. Aromas are wheat, yeasty, faintly herbal. Tastes are wheat, lemongrass, yeast. Mouth-feel is medium and smooth. Overall, I thought this was slightly better than average for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A tad on the bitter and dry side for a wheat offering. The contrast between the smell and the taste is quite perplexing, it certainly gives me pause, especially without a date on the label. <3.5>"

""
""

"Not bad, for the American wheat style, but not a memorable beer experience. Devoid of any yeasty or estery flavors, but clean and well made. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Grapevine Liquors in Denver."

"Atmosphere is solid. Nice hue, slight head, and light lacing. Nose is a bready aroma with some soft hints of plant and sweet matter. Light body, with a light but distinct wheat flavor, and a peaty finish. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"Pours a murky honey orange with a 1/2 inch foamy orange-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat, grain, pineapple, and some yeast aromas. Taste is of wheat, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and pineapple flavors. There is a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer and I like the hopped up version of a wheat beer that they are putting out here."

"Overall - An excellent APW. Great for hot days, but there'd be no hesitation to drink it any time of the year. Beats the hell out of SN Old Chico."

"a much better than average wheat beer. smells less fruity and yeasty than most, just a big nose of fresh pale and wheat malts, balanced by a mild hop bitterness. flavor is right on with the nose, really crisp and refreshing when ice cold. some lemony notes to the hop profile, but this is faint. a great summer beer that still has some meat on its bones. feel is nice, lighter medium body and fizzy soda-like carbonation. very very easy drinking and at the low abv this is an all day drinking beer perfect for the long days ahead of us. i will likely purchase more 6packs of this as summer advances."
""
""
"Very drinkable and rewarding. Quite flavour packed and a deceptive amount going on."
""
""
""
"Thanks to Beermasons and pours a golden orange hue which leaves a two finger head and little lacing,the smell is candied wheat,herbal hops,a nice touch of citrus and a earthiness to it aswell,the mouthfeel is light bodied and sessionable with tastes of freshly cut wheat,lemon zest,earthy herbal hops and is finished with a pleasant dry tangerine finish and overall its a nice easy drinking drop for a day like today and definately a session brew that could drink more than one of cheers."
"Poured a mostly clear gold/straw with a bone white pillowy head, a bit soapy, and pretty good lacing. This really wasn't what I was expecting from something labelled a wheat ale, but was overall pleased with the outcome. Smell was citrusy-- potently lemony. Taste revealed the hop profile, which comes through quite nicely and leaves a complexity in the finish. Rather light bodied and refreshing."
""
"Overall, a well represented wheat beer. It's well balanced and easy to quaff with the low 4.7% ABV. An absolutely solid beer."
"Cheers!"

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a light to medium orange yellow amber. Two finger fine white head with good retention and nice lacing. Light wheat, sweet malt and very light hop aroma, pleasant. A slight step up from light bodied, nice carbonation. Flavor starts out with nice wheat and light sweet malt, finishes rather abruptly with a slight hop kick. Nothing exceptional here, but a pleasant subdued wheat ale. Appears to be a nice candidate for dinner drinking."

"The Trout Slayer Wheat from Big Sky is a decent beer....probably better on a warmer day than the winter evening that I am trying it. The beer poured a clear golden yellow with very thin white head and no lacing. The smell has a touch of lemon and decent wheat/ malt balance. The mouthfeel is light in body with good carbonaiton. Overall it is a sessionable beer."
"Overall, not a repeater for me. Give me PBR or something else cheap for a light beer. Cost is a big factor for me in my overall score, and the regular price doesn't justify the premium in this case."

"Overall i would say one of the better wheat beers that i have sampled, i would definately buy this one again."
""
""
"Overall, this beer is a bit of an alternative to other thicker wheat beers like Boulevard. It light and yet its very flavorful. If you are thirsty it will quench your thirst also. Give this one a try if you like anything wheat."
""

"Overall - This is definitely one of the better pale wheat ales."
""
""
"Nice pour into a pint glass. Thick foamy head that last through out. Golden with a hint of amber in color. Aromas of fruit, grain, and mild yeast. Mellow taste of carmel malt, dried fruit, and a slight metallic finish. Easy drinking wheat ale. Only bought one wish I had one more."
""
""
""
"Overall:	I would drink this one again. I think on tap it would be better."
""
""
"Another can extra thanks to Ryan. Pours clear gold with a tiny head, unspectacular. Nose is sweet, softly wheat, banana, some soft fruit action. Mouth is more hop forward with a finishes that lingers between hoppy and sweet. Soft flavors but super sharp carbonation. Mediocre."
"poured from bottle into clear 16oz dixie cup. drank five, my buddy had the other. he couldn't stand it. little to no buzz off a 5% thinking i got a struck batch or something? looked appealing tasted ok. would not try it again unless on tap or canned."
"Another enjoyable ale from Montana."
""
""
"The aroma is wheaty, peppery, and slightly citric in character. The flavor combines some light white pepper phenols with lime and orange notes. A little grassy and a little grainy, too. The feel is smooth and well-carbonated, with the consistency rounding out the feel nicely. Overall, this is a reasonably good offering for the style, but again, I just feel like a great one of these could offer more."
""
""
""
"Overall: What an excellent wheat ale, I can say with confidence that this is better than the more mainstream alternatives. It is a very complex and flavorful ale not shying away from hops, and that is something I personally like. Great beer, glad I bought it, you should to."

"O: Overall a great drinking beer great for a session beer."
""
"I would like to say, that what I just drank was interesting but not something I would buy again."
"Overall Drinkability - Haven't had many in this style, but I can instantly recognize that this is middle of the road at best due to the undesirable off characters and lack of positives."
"O - overall a decent beer that compares favorably with other example of the style."
"Overall, this beer is a nice change of pace from the other Wheat Pale Ales. Very creamy, but not overwhelmingly heavy like others can be. Would recommend for an open minded drinker, but not for someone hung up on unfiltered wheats. This one is a little special."
"O: This beer ended up being just a little too sweet for my taste. Not terrible, just not great."
"The malt profile is nicely unoffensive and I could probably drink a couple of these. But I wouldn't seek it out again. My only real complaint about this beer is the name - such an epic name for a non-epic beer."
"O- Wheat beer with nothing that stands out."
"O: really happy with this beer, makes me wish it wasn’t so cold outside. I found it really good for the style"
"O: Good beer for hot weather. Light and refreshing with some good flavor."
"Thanks again to woodychandler for yet another canned beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1.5 inch head. Smell is bready, some banana and spice. Taste is of wheat and grains, a touch of spice to it. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
"The floral hop nature shows through somewhat better in the taste than in the nose, otherwise most of the flavor is what you see in the nose.... Sweet sharp wheat grains balanced well with noble-style floral and earth presence. Kept simple, but done relatively well. I almost forgot to mention, that the pale wheat bill on this one seems slightly heartier than your typical witbier as well. Like it was just a wee bit higher gravity than the statistically average Witbier, if you know what I mean. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium, well carbonated and crisp. I certainly appreciate the slightly bolder than typical flavors that come from this one!"
"O- I like this wheat. Definitely easy drinking. Great beer to give someone that would like to try something different other than their usual bland lagers."
"Overall Impression- Good wheat beer with nice hop taste. Not sure how big of a fan I am of this one but time will tell... I'm going to be getting this in bottle/on-tap as soon as I see it."
"Dr: Good price, fair quality, and decent drinkability. This is one to try if you don't pay too much for it, but it's far from special or bold."
"o - goes down easy. could be a good candidate for a drinking session or a hot summer day. nothing special really."
"Very easy drinking though...was done with it in about 5 minutes while sitting on my back deck. Overall, a rather dull brew...the search will continue."
"O- good for what it is, a very basic overall wheat to drink after mowing the lawn or floating the river. Props for th name and the artwork on the can."
" Well after plugging through the rest of them, it kinda grew on me. I shared with the neighbor, and we had a little debate about the brew. I might have been a little harsh at first glance, but I upped my ratings on it."
"Really like this as a hot weather session beer and the fact that it is in a can means I would take it camping or on some other outdoor activity in a heartbeat."
"D: Maybe not the best Big Sky offering or example of the style, but good."
"This is a clean cut, straight forward, beer easy drinking and smooth any BMC drinker could put a couple away without being scared of a craft beer."
"brilliant yellow with a tight, light head. slightly fruity nose with reasonble hop profile. good smack of bittering and piney hops, no citrus profile to speak of. an enjoyable session beer, great on a hot day!"
"Pours a very light golden amber with nice clarity and a fluffy head leaving thick curtains. The nose brings simple bready malts with almost a weird sea salt note along with a vanilla malt shake smell as well. Taste brings more bready malts with a smoke seaweed taste without much else. Definitely different for the style but not really in a good way."
"Overall: Easily my favorite pale wheat ale. A delicious addition to a commonly so mediocre style."
"M/O. Has a nice smooth creamy easy drinking feel and overall it is just an average beer that looks good when pouring it into a beer mug."
"12 oz bottle randomly had at a BBQ. I actually didn't even realize this had wheat in the mash until I read it. It's not too sharp on the wheat and not much depth in the rest of the malt. Yeast character is nothing. I won't be buying this beer. In fact, I can't say I really dig many beers I've had from this brewery."
"Unlike it's cousin IPA, I find this beer to be slightly less than average. Not to say it's bad, just nothing I'd write home about. Poured o.k., looked nice with a nice head, however I failed to detect any aromas other than beer. The taste was a nice smooth clean ale flavor, albeit no strong flavors shown through. Ale. Was your standard mouthfeel, very easy to drink and not too overly carbonated. Overall I'd say this beer is a choice you can count on for a solid beer, but not something you should choose over others if there are better options. Slay that trout sir."
"Like it was a trout."
"I have been pleased with other Big Sky products and loved the name and label of this beer so figured I would give it a shot. I picked it up for the old lady as she really likes lighter wheat ales, however she thought it was a generic light beer. The flavor really didn't come through on this one. If you're looking for a solid refreshing beer that's not big on flavor this is for you. If you're into big beer flavor, pick up one of their other fine brews."
"Final thought- love this beer"
"Interesting malt backbone, biscuit and light toffee cover up alot of the wheat. Hops are there just a bit, I could use more of the flavoring variety here. Yeast is pretty clean, but does throw off some bready flavors. The can disappeared surprisingly fast…I would be happy to suck down a few of these after slayin' some Brookies on the fly rod anyday."
"O-decent beer but not my style. Took me a while to drink"
"Try it."
"A very solid ""B" brew. Try it if it's around. Also, I would imagine it's MUCH better on-tap or in a can than it is out of a bottle/glass"
"D: Nice session beer that goes down easy and is refreshing. Makes me want to sit in the spring time sun out on the deck and have a few of these."
"Big Sky Brewing Company--Montana Trout Slayer Ale--2010 12 oz. Microcan. 5.00% ABV. 35 IBU's. (2.5 / 5.0) Wheat Ale? Big foamy lacy thin white head. Fizzy clear bright thin yellow gold color. Odd mild hop floral wheat ester front. Dry mild sweet slightly tangy citrus wheat banana light butter caramel body. Smooth refreshing mild hop light easy citrus fruit end. Sampled 3/16/2011. 6-Pack purchased for $9.25 at PCC--Greenlake, Seattle on 9/5/2010."
"Drink- A very good little beer. Would love to compare a can vs. bottle. Great summer beer, I'll have to try again."
"Mouthfeel was nice and light and the beer was very crisp and refreshing whick would make it very easy to drink."
"D - yummy and refreshing with low ABV."
"Pretty average for a wheat ale. A descent beer nonetheless."
"Clearly filtered with no typical wheat protein induced haze. Grassy hoppiness with an aspirin-like mineral component to both the flavor and bitterness. Rustic graininess with some wheat tang and rough flour. Clean and crisp on the finish. A better than average American Wheat and the can format is a definite plus. A great summertime baseball beer."
"Drinkability: These go down easy enough, and overall it's a well crafted beer. ABV is good for session drinking, but I just don't think this delivers enough flavor up front to really make it a memorable beer."
"D) I would definitely have another. This would be a great brew to have in hand while fishing - too bad it's February!"
"D: This is a phenomenal session beer. I could have quite a few of these on a summer night. Thirst quenching and very flavorfull."
"Drank this on the golf course yesterday and would have been able to drink it all day. Much better alternative to the average American lagers you'll be offered by the cart lady. It's got a nice slightly hoppy flavor that isn't overpowering like an IPA. It's light but still has nice body to make you feel like you're still drinking a man's beer. I just recommended it to my brother who's a fisherman so he can bring it out on the lake with him, which seems fitting with the name."
"Overall, I didn't care for some of the off flavors."
"The M&D are great. Would be good for a hot day and ejoyable/"
"Overall I was pretty impressed with this beer, I am not the biggest fan of this style but I ended up liking this brew a lot. The flavors was spot on and nicely balanced. A perfect summer session beer. This beer has put Big Sky Brewing Company on my radar, I hope to try some of their other offerings soon."
"D - very easy to drink. Found at park city utah restaurant."
"Drinkability is good. While it is pricey here in Illinois ($8.49 a six-pack) a sixer of this shared amongst friends is a good investment. Kudos to the Big Sky state for making a pretty awesome beer. Viva Montana!"
"This beer is very safe within the parameters of a Pale Wheat Ale, but nothing worth missing the bus for."
"Aggressive carbonation punishes the drinker."
"D: This beer delivers what was promised without trying to be inventive. Stylistically it is very solid and appropriately drinkable. One of the best of Big Sky's regular line-up."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a pale yellow color with a whispy white head that settles to near nothing. The aroma is of faint wheat, light hops and some yeast. The taste is moderately carbonated and has a strong hops presence. There is a slight wheat note to the finish of the brew with a little banana in the after taste. Medium body, mild carbonation, and not that full of flavor. The hops take this one over. Not the best sample I have had."
"Delayed continuation on making it through Mike's Montana Sampler. It pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises wheat, flowers, corn, and chalk. The taste is mostly a concoction of floral and light earthy hops, though some rather light caramel tries vainly to make itself heard over the hoppy din. The body is fairly light, with a light carbonation and a semi-watery feel. Overall, a nice li'l brew, nothing close to special, but a good easy-drinker for watching your school continue to fail at football life."
"Upon re-review, no changes to my review, except that it might also go well with a slice of citrus, preferably lemon, but lime or orange would also be appealing."
"overall decent beer but not my favorite"
"This beer pours a nice clear golden color and with a white foam that fades and laces quickly. The smell is rather sweet. There is a good green apple, orange, hints of clove as well. The flavor is rather bland after the smell was taken into consideration. I really can't taste the wheat if it exists. There's no real flavor, aside from a bit of clove. The mouthfeel is bland watery and slightly bitter. This is drinkable, but honestly it's not that great overall."
"Poured from the bottle into a snifter a golden light brown color with a white head that dissipated quickly to a very light crown. Spicy smell with a deep graininess. Taste is spicy and crisp with strong grainy taste. Feel is crisp and light with ample carbonation. Overall a good drinkable wheat beer."
"This beer poured a clear medium straw color an formed a snow white foamy head that coated the glass with lace. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, citrus, wheat and clove. The flavor was of malt, hops and hint of caramel and pepper. Fairly light and slightly sweet yet sprite finish."
"D-Fairly high, not the tastiest beer in the world, some of the flavors are a bit muddled or out of place. Still, kind of nit picking, it's still pretty good and I'd have it once in a while if I could get it at my local store."
"Pours a hazy light golden color with a white head. Nose brings forward a bit of generic wheat with hints of citrus hops. Some slight graininess. Taste is of slight sweetness and a bit of light wheat and grain. Bits of citrus in passing. Maybe orange and a bit of lemon. Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. Drinkability is average for the style, without much flavor there to really carry the beer over an extended period."
"The beer pours a very clear golden color with a white head. The aroma is wheat with some lemons, but it is a little bit faint. The flavor is a mix of wheat, lemons, oranges and some black pepper. Very nice flavor and all of the components go well together. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very drinkable wheat beer."
"12oz. can poured into a pint glass. No freshness info. Pale yellow in color. Minimal carbonation. As a side note, the abv is %5 not 4.7. Leaves a nice lumpy inch of foam on top. Mildly bitter hops on the nose with a hint of biscuity malt. Flat and light mouthfeel. This can might be older than I thought. Somewhat sweet tasting malt rounded by a touch of hoppiness. Finish is a little bread like but mainly clean. Not a bad little beer if you are looking for something to session that hearkens back to the fizzy yellow beers you grew up with but not something I would regularly like to drink."
"Good summer beer, very poundable."
"Conclusion: I am not impressed, especially considering the style. Filtered wheat bears can be quite good as evidenced by the Germans primarily, but some Americans do a good job as well. This however drinks more like hoppier a macro lager, which isn't bad but certainly isn't as good as it could be."
"This was pretty darn decent. A well hopped Wheat Ale that was appropriately balanced and quite quenching on the palate overall. I could definitely see myself reaching for a couple cans of this when the weather heats up."
"D: This is a very good beer not extremely high in alcohol, although you know it's there but it's pretty drinkable."
"This feels crisp and clean, with nothing in between. This is a good sessionable beer."
"Wow, this beer disappeared almost too quickly for me to write enough down about it. No stand-out qualities, but the balance, evenness, and straightforwardness make it eminently drinkable. I know that isn't very specific, but like I said, I really didn't have that much time before it was gone, gone, gone."
"Drinkability- pretty good, great for a hot day, tasted like a lager pretty much but still pretty good"
"D: Tad boozy psychologically, but in a good way. Interesting and complex tasting, which lends itself well to drinkability. High marks"
"Tried this beer and was shocked to see on here its a pale wheat. This has lager written all over it. Not terrible, just nothing memorable. Clear and golden, thick creamy head with great retention and lacing. Smell had a trace of hops but a little yeast and straw, somewhat like a pale wheat. Taste was very bland. Honestly it almost tasted like breadier macro brew. I really didnt notice anything special, some malt and that was better than a macro, but nothing much else really stood out. Mouthfeel was light and crisp. Overall I'm sure this would be great camping. Comes in cans, is light and easy drinking."
"Went to my favorite bar and asked if they had any new beers and they gave me one of these. Pours like a lager, looks like a lager, smells like a lager and tastes like a lager, but yet it is an ale. It is a pretty average all around. The smell doesn't have anything about it that stands out. Taste is in the same boat, just average all around. It seems like this would be a good session beer at least."
"this beer isn't very good on tap. It is a step above a high end macro and all but still not very complex. look like a macro small head and clear. smooth light beer not really what I expecting but a nice beer to try when it is hot out. I can't really taste much of the wheat although it is sweet. feel is good but hard to have more than one since it so sweet and boring."
"D - Really easy to drink and get down, wouldn't mind this on a hot day, but not really going to seek it out."
"Overall its a good beer."
"(brought back from a liquor store in Junction City, KS)"
"Drinkability> The beer might be a little too sweet for me, but it's decent and probably great on a hot summer day, if we had those in San Francisco"
"Wnjoyable brew for sure, maybe just not the nest rep of the style thats all."
"Offers a good feel with a steady carbonation giving the beer a sense of fullness that isn't really there in the malts department. Dry on the finish throughout with a hint of berry early and light lemon later on in the glass. Quite drinkable throughout, fruity and smooth when cold, dry and bready with warming."
"Flavor was just like the smell. A hint of sweetness and some wheat. Pretty light. Not bad on a hot day, but not for someone looking for something hearty."
"D- this was just a so so wheat beer for me. It wasn't so much bad, as it just didn't do anything to excite me beyond the average."
"Appearance is a golden yellow with a thick crisp head and fair lace. Smell of floral citrus hops and mildly sweet malts. Taste is again mild sweet malts with a tangier hop note ending bittersweet dry. Mouthfeel light - medium with good body and carbonation. Not a bad ale, but something I wouldn't make a special trip for either."
"Overall less than stellar. I usually enjoy stuff from Big Sky. This one however will not be on my to get list."
"On tap at whole foods into a pint glass...A very bright clearish straw, like a macro. Light white nead, decent retention and lacing...Aroma is light not wheat but light hops slight skunk...Taste is ok, a little bitter a little skunk makes it hard to drink, had to split it with my gf. Its also to sweet. Overall, nothing special, a step above a crappy macro."
"D- Doesn't overdo the citrus or spice qualities of an American wheat which is good in my book. It's quite refreshing. The subtle features create a feeling that it's just missing a bit of a ""wow."" I do enjoy that it's available in a can."
"The smooth full body and the carbonated refreshing hops/spices combine to make an extremely drinkable brew, doesn't feel too thin, and has just enough flavor to be enjoyable. Not bad, but to be honest I probably wouldn't pick this one out again given a choice of Big Sky brew."
"Not bad but not recommended either."
"I would consider the drinkability only moderate despite the mellow character and low ABV. I feel the flavor profile may become tiresome for me. Overall it was a bit lackluster but I'm certainly glad I gave it a try."
"You know, Trout Slayer isn't bad but could be so much better. The nose was the high point. I wish the taste followed suit."
"D: probably will not drink this one again unless it's at a party and it's free."
"Citrus and floral hops on the palate, more of that breadiness. Decent flavor overall, but nothing really great."
"it would have been nice if they had some info about the beer on the bottle. nothing is stated except the name of the beer and the brewer."
"A nice clear golden color pour with a medium frothy white head , quickly fading . Medium carbonation . Aroma of light spice ,floral hops, dry grain and a bit of wheat tang . Flavor is of dry wheat , bread flower , earthy hops , peppercorns ,and citrus fruit . Light body with a crisp dry mouthfeel , short dry finish . A nice easy summer drinker and a good try ."
"D - This is definitely not what I usually drink but definitely hit the spot after a long day of work. This doesn't have a ton of flavor but if you just want a light refreshing beer this is recommended."
" Highly drinkable, excellent as a session brew due to the lower ABV. I imagine this would be really refreshing while fishing or after getting back in. This will be one I return to as the the months get hotter this summer."
"Would I buy more of it? - definitely, this would be a beer worthy of my cooler on any warm day."
"Served ice cold like a macro lager, this may be an okay swiller. However, I don't think I'll be having this one again."
"Taste: Not as one dimensional as the smell. Has a nice balanced herbal spiciness from the hops. A little acidic twang in the finish which gives way to go back to the herbal hop character."
"Very clean after-taste and certainly a brew that could help initiate your non-geek friends. Not quite as good as Gumballhead, but I wouldn't back down from a cold Trout Slayer on tap or in the bottle. Very drinkable and pretty tasty. Probably the best ""fishing beer"" around."
"An easy-drinking wheat beer, high quaffability and very sessionable. Will probably routinely pick some more of this up before barbecues this summer."
"Clear color, yellow-gold, not much of the white foam. The nose is light and grainy, with some splashes of citrus. The flavor is a little bland, but has some lemon and pale wheat malt sweetness. Slight breadiness throughout. Body is very light, finish is dry, and nothing stands out. Reasonable refreshing, with the dose of citrus. Not too challenging, but that's okay sometimes."
"This is one of my new favorites. It's absolutely delicious. I can't wait to try it on tap."
"Hops a little bigger on the palate, sweet, almost as if apples in a small way. No real malt or even wheat presence. Very light, makes the hop character and the sweetness seem broader than they are. Easy drinking, but a little pricey for what probably doesn't amount to too much ingredients wise. Summertime fishin beer fo' sho."
"D- Smooth, but a tad sweet with some odd flavors. Not bad, but not great."
"D: There are some decent flavors, but they're just sort of jumbled together and don't really work all that well together. I think I'd pass on this one in the future."
"Overall, a very enjoyable and pleasant brew lacking any outstanding qualities, but well above many other American Wheat beers I've sampled. I will not have any problem drinking the 3 that came in by sample pack. Worth a try for wheat beer fans."
"Drinkability: Certainly one of the most flavorful American Wheats I have encountered, though I am not crazy about the lemony pith - just a bit too harsh"
"D: this one is ok, definitely feels like a beer you'd drink a shit load of after/during a softball game"
"Bready malt, raw honey, and fairly dry on the tongue. The body is medium, crisp, and very refreshing. A nicely flavored and well rounded wheat, better than I remembered."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a nice milder beer that is worth pounding down for a long time."
"D - I believe I had this on tap and it was far superior to this offering. Not bad though, just somewhat bland and unbalanced. The nose and the flavor differ too much to have it feel like one cohesive unit. A tad disjointed."
"I know pale wheat ales are not gonna be flavor packed, more of a session brew - but man, was this a disappointing brew."
"Goes down very easy. Would be a great beer for a hot, summer day. Lite and refreshing."
"As I said a cask version, with a bit of mellowing in both hop bitterness and carbonation when drawn by pump, would do this brew well. It is the sharp bitterness that gets me with many APAs. I was just on Mr. Malty and read J.Z.'s article on hop flavor where he and others did experiments with brews containing a good amount of hop flavor additions combined with little to no bittering additions. Their conclusions were that the resultant brews tasted exceptional with just the rght bittering. Overall, I would like less bittering and more hop flavor, though aroma was great."
"I guess I'm more of a discriminating beer nerd than my dad, but then again, his first love is rum, something we don't completely share lol."
"My glass was filled with this pretty dark-golden color with a finger of bright white foamy head supported by a medium amount of carbonation. There wasn't much of an aroma, and the taste had some mild hops with a bit of citris. It goes down easy and leaves a bit of a bread-flavored aftertaste. It's not a very complex beer, but it's enjoyable enough. I'd get it again."
"Not a product I would go back to the shelf for by any means and a severe disappointment from an otherwise great brewer."
"The flavor is moderately hopped, though the hopppiness brings delciate fruit flavors to the table instead of crisp bitterness. Hints peach and strawberry. Fruit skins. There's a light whisper of grain husk. Light in the mouth, goes down easy...I could do this at a BBQ."
"D: Quite drinkable, I really enjoyed it. Definitely a sessionable brew. I'm looking forward to trying other brews from Big Sky."
"Not many reviews of canned beer. I need to get in touch with my inner redneck. It's pale golden in color with a thin creamy head that leaves some really nice lace and has active, champagne-like carbonation for interest. Smells of lemons, grass, and makes it feel like spring somehow. Taste is malty, toasted bread, oats, with a citrusy note and a dry finish. Very nice indeed! Mouthfeel is soft and pleasantly bubbly. Drinkability is awesome. Give me a sixer of these and 36 holes of disc golf and we have a definite winner. Light, unassuming, simple, and very satisfying. This is a great example of good ol' everyday, name patch on your shirt beer. God Bless 'merica!"
"M/D - Goes down like water, easy enough to drink on a hot day, just don't expect anything special."
"D: Good wheat beer. The flavors are nice and strong and the beer is well crafted."
"well, this is not my favorite beer would be an understatement. I was a little disappointed and expected more. it was crisp but didn't have a great flavor whatsoever. Had a nice light feel though but just didn't sit that well and not very drinkable.."
"Even though it's a little medicinal the mouthfeel is still very nice. I like the smoothness and the tiny bit of chewiness from the grains combined with a firm carbonation and a hint of hops. A good session drink but a little on the low side of things to me. At $9 a sixpack it's a little on the expensive side, especially for a 4.7% brew."
"An American wheat with distinctive character. I think I like it."
"D - A bit hoppy for my tastes, but not overbearing"
"I recommend this beer either just for a night out drinking or with any outdoor activity. Take camping or on the lake."
"Bottle: Poured a light hazy golden color ale with a medium size head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of floral and bitter hops are dominating while wheat malt are quite subtle. Taste is also dominated by hops with clear floral and bitter notes and wheat malt almost all covered up. Body I fuller then average with OK carbonation. I guess this is OK overall though the hops presence is too dominating for the wheat too truly shines."
"great drinkability."
"D= Pretty good. Smooth beer. Just what a regular wheat beer should be. Pretty decent and I can see myself enjoying some of these in the summer."
"D - Not good."
"Drinkability; I liked the middle of this beer, the front was a but airy and the finish left a bad taste in my mouth, but I really liked the malty mouthfeel. Pretty good."
"A golden beer with a large white head that fluffs up and slowly bubbles down, leaving a bit of lace. No cloudiness. Smells grassy, somewhat grainy, a hint of alcohol. Smells like an easy drinking golden ale. Flavor is fairly neutral, some floral elements but largely dry and grasy. Moderately bitter grassy finish. Tastes like a fairly standard golden ale. Light-medium body with a high carbonation. Not bad, pretty average stuff though, not real appealing."
"Over all - This is a very drinkable Ale, I could see myself drinking more than six of these if I had nothing to do the next morning. Very impressed. The age of the beer did not seem to hinder it at all - I wish I had a fresher one to taste along side."
"Very well balanced and typical of a good wheat beer. Very good to drink"
"A very nice warm-weather refresher, as it was meant to be. A nice wheat ale with a touch of hops!"
"D-Light enough to be drank outside, on a hot day (which I intend to do_, but also packing in a surprising amount of enjoyable, but still lighter, flavor."
"Nice pale ale... nay, pale wheat ale."
"Not a ton of flavor to this beer but at least it's balanced. A good summer croud pleaser - especially with a name like Trout Slayer!"
"D - This is a decent wheat ale. Another solid brew from Big Sky."
"The body was typical, not heavy, not light, and flowed pleasantly across the tongue. Drinkability was nice. Overall, a pleasant enough beer, I could drink these while tubing down the river or during lunch along a hiking trail, but not anything really special. Worth trying if you see it."
"Overall: This is a good beer. I liked it more than I thought I would considering I am not a big fan of wheat. I got this beer because I was fishing for trout, and the name appealed to me. I would buy it again."
"Beach/Shore: Absolutement! I am moving further and further away from Ten Fidy with each new craft beer. Slay some trout, catch some rays, recycl and have a blast!"
"D: Quite drinkable; a nice, light and refreshing summer beer."
"overall, i am not that impressed. the IPA i found to be just amazing but this just seems like its missing something."
"Drinkability is good. Nice flavorful beer that is light enough to be very session worthy. Well worth trying, very solid."
"Conclusion: A style I'm not usually fond of...done exceptionally well."
"Overall very decent. A very nice, very light pale ale, that leaned heavy on the hops, but I think it works. Would not turn it down."
"Just ok for me. Sort of average. When tasting a wheat beer and in order for me to like it, it has to be something amazing. This just didn't have it."
"Nice stuff overall -- I'll have to pick up a six of the cans next time I see 'em!"
"Creamy and smooth on the palate. A little less chewy than I'd prefer, presumably due to the filtration. Very drinkable, and toward the top of my list of session beers. I'll be picking this up again."
"Pours a clear, golden color. 3/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of wheat, sweet malt, slight hops, pine, and some yeast cleanliness. Fits the style of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. There is a strong dryness associated with this brew. Tastes of pine up front, then wheat, then sweet malt, some yeast comes through in the background, and a hint of hops in the finish. Overall, a surprisingly good brew - much better than I was prepared for. The dryness inhibits the drinkability a little, but still a good beer - I'd be able to drink a couple."
"I was fairly surprised by this. I am use to grainy and metallic APWA that are way over carbonated. This is very inviting however. The nose is exceptional, and a perfect beer to bring to a BBQ or the like. Another Blue Sky beer I would recommend."
"this beer suprised me - i got this in a mix a six and now i know i will be picking more up this summer"
"D: Easy drinking beer. An excellent session beer as well. It hits all the right notes, and is very tasty. One of my favorite summertime sessions. This is an excellent crossover beer. People that are macro drinkers generally have dug this when I've given it to them. Glad to see its canned now. Highly recommended."
"Weak weak weak. Not really what I was hoping for but it is a pale wheat so whatever. No real hop character to speak of and even the malt is almost no existant. All I really taste is some slightly sweet yeast and the bit of wheaty malt. Mouthfeel is very carbonated and light on the tongue. Drinkability is ok."
"Drinkability: ...plus the nice Pilsner-like taste leads to an extremely drinkable summer beer. Also, at 4.7%, it is a great session beer."
"M: Light body. Balanced carbonation. Smooth and crisp in the finish - a nice ale for the summer."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little white fizzy head, with some sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, wity some grassy notes, and some spice. The taste is sweet, malty, grassy, with some spice's. Medium body. Drinkable, a tasty brew."
"Drinkability: It's smooth and easy drinking, and would make a great brew to sip while sitting in a boat for hours on end. The next time I go fishing I'll definitely pack a case of SLAYER!"
"I like this one more with each sip and would say that if you like an ale that is not very hoppy then this is for you. Give it a try if you find it."
"pours a straw yellow color with a great head and lacing and a nice ring til the end.. the smell is lemon and biscuits and malts with some hops ..not bad for a wheat..the taste is a lemon biscuit taste with some hops and malt its fruity and has a zing to it ... this wheat has a bite to it.. the mouthfeel is light as it should be and very drinkable in the summertime.. big sky has some good brews and this one will not disappoint..recommended"
"Light/medium body, fairly smooth and easy to drink, a six-pack or two would work well on a hot day fishing, even for bass or whatever."
"D - This could become a summer staple in my beer fridge. This is a seriously refreshing brew that would be great after mowing the lawn or coming in from a long hot run. Reminds me of orange cleaning stuff, but I mean that in a good way. Its clean and fresh!"
"So far this is one of the better representation of this style. There is a good body, nice flavor, and very easy to drink. I did a re review on this beer since it was one of first beers when I started drink craft brews."
"D--While this is better than a couple others that I've had from Big Sky, it still doesn't make me want to go for the glass. There is just nothing there, and it is merely an OK sessionable ale."
"D: A pretty unoffensive pale wheat ale. Nothing spectacular, but pretty drinkable. I could see myself drinking this while trout fishing in Montana. Aside from that, it could be a good lawn mower beer. It definitely isn't one of those beers, I'd cross state lines for and pack my suit case, but really how many of those do we need?"
"Edit 3 days after writing this review: I had no idea this was a wheat beer. It didn't taste anything like one. I had more than one sample, so if mine was mislabeled, the whole 6-pack was apparently mislabeled. Or I'm going insane."
"This is a good beer, very drinkable. I'll have no problem drinking a few more. however, i usually like my wheats unfiltered.. so there are some better choices out there for myself"
"D: A decent wheat ale that could use a little more of the wheat."
"Large soapy type head which was great. The color was very plain like Budweiser. The only smell I got was heavy hops but I liked it because it was a different type of hops that isn't as common as other types. There is a strong presents of citrus, fruit and then a light hoppy finish. This one gets better as you drink it. The flavors change as you get lower in your glass."
"This was my first try at a Big Sky Brewing Co. offering, good initial opinion, but nothing too impressive that stands out on this one. A very basic American Pale Ale."
"Pours a golden yellow. 1 finger head. smells of hops and just a bit of wheat. Hops come through really nice and pretty strong, but not real bitter. more i drink it the stronger the bitterness comes through, but still very drinkable to me. another really good session brew."
"light to mid body. adequate carbonation. good beer to drink on a warm day while grilling out or chilling in the shade. i would buy this twelve pack of their beers again. they have all been good beers."
"Slightly cloudy through the center but clear on the edges with a pure white head that leaves moderate lacing. Nothing grabs me in the smell, a little bit of hops and a hint of wheat. The taste is much like the smell, nothing to note. This is a great beer with pizza or a burger, but not a standout by itself."
"It was difficult to see that this was a wheat ale. It was yellow and clear. The head was small and a clean white. It smelled dry with possibly some faint earthy scents. The taste was clean and low-profile. I could sense the hops in the finish with some of the same earthy notes upfront. It wasn't outstanding, I couldn't catch the wheat, and I didn't feel like having another, but it did a fine job washing down the largest slice of pizza I have ever eaten."
"Pretty good would drink again."
"This beer pours a cloudy golden straw color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes rather quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of floral and piney hops. It is a very mellow aroma, but is very lively too. The taste carries over the hops from the aroma. Floral, pine, and a touch of citrus. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a nice surprise from Big Sky Brewing. I'm not quite sure if this is a wheat beer as it is listed here, but whatever it is it is quite sessionable."
"This could be a good cross-over beer or a session beer if you want to give your taste buds a break from the bigger beers."
"Light/medium body and a little oily. Crisp, carbonated, moderately flavorful, and quite drinkable."
"Okay, but lots of other wheat's that I will go to before this one."
"Pale yellow, with some head that doesn't last. A little bit of malt aroma and flavor, but doesn't go far enough. It goes down realtively smoothly, with a small amount of bitter to balance the small amount of malt. Really? An American wheat? Nothing about this beer tipped me off that it was a wheat beer. Mostly unremarkable."
"Quite a drinkable bottle, this one."
"Not my favorite style. But this is a great lawn mower/backyard brew."
"D- Nothing overwhelmingly awesome, this is a great beer to have on a summer night grilling burgers (like I did tonight). A pleasant surprise considering I had no idea what I was buying."
"Grainy grass at first, then some light smooth caramel malt. Some honey and lemon sweetness. There's really not much as far as complexity, honestly. It's a really good drinkable summer brew. I could imagine downing these while fishing. At only 4.7%, this'll make a really solid session beer."
"This beer has a slight banana/bready smell with little head and mild lacing. Good mouth feel with decent, but not too much carbination with a nice mild wheaty flavor. This is a good hot-weather brew that's quenching and light. Not a bad brew if light is what you're after."
"Pours a clear mix of straw and amber with a dismal to eventualy no head. A bit too clear and lacking in bubbles for a wheat beer. The aroma is a soft bread with a litle bit of yeasty fruit and no noticeable hops. Not a bad thing though. The taste starts with some dried gypsum bananas. Then has a amber malt aroma. Makes me think of white toast. Maybe a little rosey tasting too. An ok pale wheat ale."
"I really appreciate what the brewers have done here with this style; I typically have the unfiltered wheat beers and this is quite good, comparatively. No one scent or flavor is too overpowering and everything seems to be present in a great balance. This is a beer that's more enjoyable when it's a little colder than what would normally be ""acceptable."" Well-done."
"Got this beer in a trade. It is a good beer but not something that I would probably try again. I would like to try other selections from Big Sky. I feel like I should drink this beer in the heat of summer, its light enough to satisfy and has enough taste characteristics to be a knoch above macro light beers. Overall a decent offering."
"Pours a cloudy straw color with only about half an inch of fairly quickly dissipating foam and no lace, although it does make an interesting bubble pattern under the surface for a few seconds. Not much smell to it; vaguely citrus. As far as pale ale goes, it's less hop-bitter than most. The best comparison I can come up with is to Sam Adams, which isn't a pale ale at all, but tastes very similar. This one has a sweet and malty aftertaste that Sam Adams doesn't have - a little too sweet and cloying for my tastes, which cut the mouthfeel, drinkability, and taste scores. Given that it's a wheat pale ale, and I don't like wheat beers or pale ales (the label just says ""ale""), the score it got is pretty darn solid. For those who like the style, I would expect a more positive response."
"Good beer on a hot summer night."
"D: Nice session beer. Pairs well with warm summer days. The best example of this style that I've had."
"D= very drinkable, maybe would suffice for a modest APA fan, lager or pale-ale drinker as well."
"In conclusion, I wish they served this at ballgames instead of Macros. The hop profile helps you to measure the quantity of beers you have had in the sun much better than barely hopped macros. Darn fine beer..."
"D - Nice on a hot day but blends in with the crowd."
"Drinkability- Great summer day beer. This beer won naming rights from Bayern Brewing which changed their beer name to Dancing Trout. Different beers and very different in qulaity."
"Drinkablility - A lot of fun and a easy going ale."
"Extremely light drinking. A nice refreshing beer on a warm day. The low ABV allows drinking many of these."
"Pored a deep yellow with a nice off white head that diminished quickly. Nose was kind of bland, no real notes other than some wheat and a soapy smell. Taste was grassy, wheat, some honey and a hint of floral. Hopped well. Mouthfeel was a little bitter and soapy with wheat and honey."
"D: From the label it would be the ultimate beer to have during the search for the elusive golden trout or just enjoying a day fishing in Lee Vining Creek. The beer itself is pretty average, it has its moments, but I'm not looking into the availability of 6ers for this one."
"I really enjoyed this beer and would definitely have it again."
"Definitely a session beer. Not bad, nor really good, something I'd pick up a mixed twelver for a gathering of less-than-great friends."
"The aroma is what got me. It had a citrus aroma and some herbal smell that I couldn't quite put my finger on. The taste was similar to the aroma, with more of a citrusy character. It was too easy to drink. After this and Moose Drool, I'm becoming a big fan of big Sky."
"The aroma is bread and citrus. It also had a herbal quality to the smell. The taste was malty with a hop kick. It left a nice bitterness on the tongue and back of the throat. The resinous hops covered the inside of the mouth. I haven't tried a lot of this style but it the best I have tried to date. These would taste real good on a hot day. Whoa."
"I like Am. Pale Wheat drinks. This is a good one. Not great, but satisfying nonetheless. Oh, and it went just fine with brunch."
"Drinkablity: Very tasty and drinkable. Did not go overboard on the wheat, the balance was about perfect."
"Pours transparent bright straw with a thin head and a bready nose, nimble hops, not much else. Very smooth with tight malt and a hop character that leaves me wanting more. Quite clean and refreshing - could drink this as a summer session. Again as Jason points out"" almost lager-like."" I would like to try more American Pale Wheat Ales as I was not impressed by this one. It is weird how my batch did not match the style profile listed on BA or with other reviewers."
"Very clean, almost lager-like with a assertive hop profile which I really dig. I'll say it, this beats out almost all of the American Pale Wheat Ales I have had to date and certainly the more mainstream ones. Wheat session ale is the last thing I'll say."
"Quite a tasty beer here. A great summer beer and not so shabby stuck indoors enduring what California calls winter. Very good alternative to Lager."
"on sale."
"Drinks fairly easy, but the dryness detracts, too hoppy for a crystal weizen IMO"
"I would be amazed if Big Sky uses a German yeast... that being said, looking at old notes, that was my biggest bitch about Trout Slayer when it was brewed by Bayern."
"D-Pretty tasty wheat ale....definitely made for the summer..."
"overall, this is a very crisp and refreshing beer i really enjoy it, would be better on a hot summer day rather than a cold winter night though"
"Wow, this tastes like a wonderful wheat bread with black pepper. No, the flavor isn't amazing, but I'm just surprised how much it's like a good loaf of bread. Sure there's some light but crisp citrus hops, but the wheat and toasted barley are what's going on. This beer is a little different, maybe more of an American pale wheat ale, but is still worth trying."
"Nice session fare, perfect for summer refreshment. Likely approachable enough to serve to the BMC drinkers who arent scared to try something new. Glad I picked this up, will look for more this summer. Recommend it!"
"The name on this brew is a bit misleading, as it made me think of a hearty full-bodied ""killer"" ale for some reason. That being said. It's not such a bad go of it. Pours a clear golden with a two-finger white head which fades quickly at first and ends up a leaving a nice fluffy small cloud on top. Lacing is spotty all around. Smells of coriander and citrus. Could easily be mistaken for a whitbeir if not for the color, and could be easily mistaken for a lager if not for the head, and could easily be mistaken for a straight on hefeweizen if not for the lack of haziness. Is this beer confused or is that why they call it a Kristalweizen? Ahh. Very clever. Tastes of malts, grass, orange peel and a bit of lemon in the background. Very smooth and drinkable and not bland as might be expected, with an undercurrent of sweetness that makes it a bit more satisfying. The light-bodied and crisp mouthfeel make for a good little beer you might get to if you're looking for a good summer sessioner. Seeing that it's 66 degrees outside today and the middle of December, that's close enough for me. I commend Big Sky for trying something different here and not just going for a straight up wheat beer, as most of the other brewers in their class do."
"i'm thinking this isn't a kristalweizen but an american hopped kolsch style ale."
"Slightly hazed straw color. Pure snow white head. Big and fluffy in nature. Great retention and lace properties. Aroma is pretty nice. Warm bready malt tones and some citric hop aromas as well. Especially lemon. The base of this beer is that warm biscuity/bready maltiness. The hops play on top of that, with Palisade and Glacier being in the mix. Lemony hoppiness. Slightly pungent lemon rind tones. It fits though. This has a crisp feel to it and goes down pretty easy. Solid beer."
"The beer escapes the 12-ounce bottle a clear gold with a generous creamy white head that lingers long, upon its final dissolution; the lace provides a thin veil to obscure the glass. Nose has a nice earthy grain aroma, slight hint of hops, citrus like in its crispness, start has a fair to middling grain profile, decent bitter bite at the back, feels light to moderate. Finish has a sparkling acidity, the hops diminutive but pleasing, quite dry aftertaste, nice drinking beer, good session beer."
"Endnote: Kristal weizen? I never woulda guessed..."
"Overall impression: Not overly exciting - a fairly average beer."
"Clear pale straw colored brew; lots of little bubbles rising up to form a medium sized white head. Fair amount of lace. Sweet malt scent, backed by floral hops. Grain malt comes out first on the taste, nice mix of floral hops with a bit of bitterness. Hints of spice. Medium bodied, dry finish. A surprisingly tasty beer for such a light bodied brew. Wish I would have found a case of these during the summer; you could sit by the grill and put down enough of these to make the day disappear via time travel."
"D - Definitely nothing special, but pretty easy drinking."
"All things considered this is a drinkable brew, but not a remarkable one. The bitterness in the taste clashes a bit with the sweet fruity smell. Not the best offering from the folks at Big Sky. Probably not the worst either, but not my preference."
"Pours out of the bottle a golden color with a foamy white head. The head becomes much denser as it shrinks to the layer just above the beer and remains throughout. This is a very nice hoppy blonde ale, with notes of Saaz? hops. The smell also has hints of biscuit and coriander. I really enjoy the taste. It's almost what you might consider a ""light pale ale"" with a malty taste and bitter aftertaste that you may consider fruity or citrusy depending on the palate. The mouthfeel has a medium body and an effervesence that is rooted in hot summer days. A little hoppier than a traditional blonde ale, this beer has a drinkablility that never gets tired. You might pick up a six pack and find it gone within a couple of hours on a mid-August Saturday."
"The taste is grainy with some malt tones and a bit of fruit and a good wheat taste.It finishes on the dry side, has a light mouthfeel and medium carbo. Pretty quaffable and not a bad brew. I'd buy it from time to time...."
