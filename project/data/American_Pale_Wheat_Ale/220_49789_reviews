"Along with celebration, one of my two gateway craft beers. Does not taste the way I recall. A hint of hop stoopid in the nose but not the taste. Went down real smooth.. Just not a ton of taste. 4/5."
""
"This beer tasted liked a bottle 400 Pound Monkey which I reviewed, but not nearly as bad. I have a feeling that I must have a gotten a bad bottle of both, because the smell and taste is really strange."
""
"Another great brew from Lagunitas, hoppy but not too bitter. Very crisp, a great beer for a hot day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Way too hoppy. Long bitter aftertaste. Not a fan"
""
"One of my favorites of Lagunitas"
""

"Delicious. Sweet tasting. Very refreshing."
"To me, the presence of wheat malt is not noticeable to the taste, besides the yeasty sweetness that characterizes beers like Hefeweizen--instead, the wheat comes across in the overall lightness of the beer. What is actually a pretty strong brew feels airy and light, with little alcohol taste."
""
""
"Nice foamy head that settle nicely. Color is a beautiful hay yellow with consistent bubbling to the head. Smell is slight floral and fruit notes. Taste is outstanding, very hoppy (as it should be) with a combination of fruits, honey, and floral aspects. Finish and mouth feel are slightly bitter, but not off putting. Very impressive."
""
""
"Something my roommate brought home. I'm all for hops but this is something else. 6 types in one beer is interesting..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes of honey, straw, and wheat along with citrus and floral notes. It smells of the same"
"The is a very refreshing all purpose beer which is deceivingly complex."
""
""
""
"This is a nice drinking beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into tulip glass a beautiful orange with fluffy white bubbles to the rim. Settles nicely with decent lacing on the glass. Incredible bouquet of floral and piney hops with a crackers and light ester notes. Taste is resiny hops, tangerines, cut grass with a semi sweet breadiness to give a balanced flavor and medium-light body to this beer. Nice crisp carbonation and excellent drinkability. I would get this again for sure!"

"Light amber color, pleasant smell, floral and fruity aftertaste."

""
"One of my favorite beers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Malty, yet clean. Makes it extremely drinkable. This was my first Lagunitas and it is still my favorite."
""
"Overall good beer Lagunitas can't wait to try more of what you got"
"Overall, a nice brew"
""
""
""
"Fantastic!! Excellent across the board - not to be missed!"
""
"Overall, has the best features of a wheat beer and an IPA. Well balanced sweetness with hoppy bitterness. Great beer."
""
""
""
""
"There is so much going on with this ale I can't even explain it. A little bit of everything which is a good thing."
""
""
""
""
"This is a fantastic beer.  Really great flavor, wonderfully balanced, very drinkable and will kick your butt if you have too many."
""
""
""
""
"The wheat marries beautifully with the citrus-forward hops, keeping that resinous, piney note so pervasive within this style in check, while adding some bready texture to the mid-palate. Finishes dry but with a smooth, honeyed feel. Great balance."
""
"O: A really great ale that straddles the line between a hoppy pale wheat ale and a wheat-based IPA. This one is definitely worth seeking out on a warm day."
""
"My favorite beer of all time!"
""
"Nice golden display. Crisp flavor. Nothing bad to say"
"Overall- A fantastic beer, highly recommended."
""
""
""
"O- Being a New Brunswicker, I travel to the State of Maine as often as I can to seek out some great beer that's not available at home and I consider myself extremely fortunate to have come across a Sixer of Lagunitas Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale in a Hannaford. Easily one of the best APA's I've had and this one is even Wheat! Extremely easy to drink even at 7.5% ABV! It will be hard to measure up to this one for sure."
""
"I have to say thanks to my buddy Matt for recommending this beer. The bottle calls this an ale, but it's really a sweet IPA all day long. And amazingly drinkable. The fact that this is available year-round probably makes this my new go-to beer. Love it."
""
""
"This is easily one of my top five go-to beers and it's a luxury that it's so readily available. Beer this good is usually hard to find. I love that it zings hops like a double ipa but is not heavy on the malt. Easy to drink without feeling like you ate a loaf of bread. Great beer!"
""
"I'd like to know what happened, I've had this before and it tasted like an IPA. This clearly is not an IPA. I checked the lagu website it's a wheat ale with hops added.  What was I drinking before."
"Poured from bottle to nonic. Appearance is a clear pale golden with white thick frothy head that leaves nice lacing. Immediately get floral and citrus aromas with a hint of bread. Flavors are similar with medium sweetness from a fruit note and a lightly bitter grassy taste. Mouthfeel is lively, with a soapy texture, and a mild but lingering bitter finish."
""
""
"Sweet taste and smell, no hop, sumer beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Keg of little sumpin drank."
"This has been my favorite Pale Ale I've ever had.  Always in my beer fridge."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice balance between sweet & bitter. Full flavored. Strong citrus kick, grapefruity & orange peelish w/a hint of a piney element, but not overly overwhelming like some stronger IPAs. One of my go-to's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pale gold (SRM 4+) with frothy white head, good carbonation from 12oz bottle; grapefruit and grass notes; lite citrus/grapefruit and grassy bitter hops; crisp, medium lite mouthfeel with lite citrus tongue coating;overall, great ""west coast"" style...I believe I'll have another!"
"The first time I tried it I wasn't appealed right away but as I kept drinking it I really liked it."
""
""
"2/8- Mo Dailey Draft (Chicago) - Very good IPA offering by Lagunitas. Nice blend of taste and strength, went down smooth. Had a few when all was said and done, and I look forward to having this beer again down the road."
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a beer you go to for a nice refreshing and full flavored beer."
""
"Amazing beer!  Lagunitas is great as usual."
""
""
""
"Not a fan of bitter beers, this one reminded me of carrots. However, take the bitterness away and its a great beer. That's good news for bitter beer lovers"
"O-Overall I will say that this is an excellent beer. It is so refreshing so make sure you drink it very cold and also pour it into a worthy glass. The glass allows any beer’s characteristics to shine through and this beer is amazing. The color is much lighter and more of a yellow-golden than other IPAs that I have reviewed like Rebel Rouser from Sam Adams and Rampant IPA by New Belgium. Those beers are amazing too, but this one is different, because it focuses on the floral and piney citrus flavors more than other IPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A great beer with a great hop taste with some subtle citus notes and a nice bitterness. One of my favorites indeed!"
""
""
"Pours clear gold. No foreshadowing of what’s to come. Aroma has a sharp distinctive perfume/medicinal bent, strangely reminiscent of my girlfriend's house. Though I have a strong olfactory sense, this aroma does not translate. The taste is semisweet, with caramel and wheat flavors. I have no idea what style this brew indicates – per usual from Lagunitas – but it’s delicious!"
""
""
""
""
"This is a beautiful beer!"
"Pours a semi-transparent gold with a thick white head.  Smells of citrus zest, tropical fruits, and flowers with a touch of pepper.  The taste is similar to the aroma with some added hints of apple; it's also a tad spicy and slightly bitter.  The malt is there but very faint.  It's crisp, refreshing, and not boozy at all, especially considering the high ABV.  For $8.99 a 6 pk, this is too good to be true!"
"Awesome smell one of my all time favorites"
""
""
"stated 67 ibu's on the bottle, but the bitterness largely dissappeares in the cloying sweetness. not to my liking."
"Quite hoppy for a wheat ale. But I expect and like that from Lagunitas."
"This beer is more towards a orange citrus IPA treat but with some wheat that is there but not full front and center. It's delicious and smells wonderful out of a mason jar with jimi hendrix spinning under a needle."
""
""
""
"This is just great beer. Something refreshingly different. It may be a little sweet for some but for me it makes for a great session beer. Just enough hoppy bitterness to react well with the sweet flavor. This is the best beer I have had from lagunitas so far. It hides the 7.5% abv almost to well."
""
""
""
""
""
"I didn't like it, and I think 94 is a silly score. How's that?"
""
""
"Not being a hop head, I was a bit concerned about this one, but I found it a nice beer. There is a very definite hops presence there, but not to the point of dominating the beer so much that they are all you can taste. It kind of bridges the gap between a full on IPA and something less hoppy. I am still not a hop head, but this is one hops heavy beer I wouldn't mind having again."
""
"Not good. Does not taste like beer. Would rather drink pink wine."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is beautiful, hands down, favorite lagunitas brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"This ice cold beer hit high marks on all aspects of this review. Great brew through and through!"
"I'm not normally a fan of very hoppy beers but this is a great example of flavor and crisp bite. You can smell the layers of hops right from the start but the sharp taste makes this an excellent beer.."
""
""
"Medium hop. Smells more citrusy and spicy, not alcohol smell which is surprising for higher level. Little too citrusy of a hop for me, need more of a smooth aftertaste rather than grapefruit notes. Enjoyable beer overall"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very drinkable, well-balanced and flavorful beer."
""
"Overall - It drinks well, not overly carbonated, nice mouth feel, not too filling. Good beer. Its definitely a different wheat beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Working off old notes.  Will update with more details if/when I have another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer! My new fav. beer !"
""
""
""
"A really solid wheat ale, with some complexity and quite intense. One of the best i've ever had."
""
""
"The floral aroma is amazing and the hoppy entrance quickly turns into a slightly bitter finish.  Overall a great beer, one of my favorites."
"Grapefuit is the major note, but pretty light and balanced with some dry fruit and distant malt.  Refreshing and more complex than most wheat beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Loved the aromas of berries and floral tones.  Right in my wheelhouse.  The taste does pair with the smell  very well.  Bitter hops that fades to smooth crisp finish.  Not overly sweet which helps in the fact that i'm able to drink a few at a time and not get sick of the beer.  Overall it is a beer I like to keep in the frig on a regular basis if i can find it.  Very good Lagunitas."
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the best hoppy wheats I've had, and substantially better than the overhyped Gumballhead. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"V - Medium."
"Just a beer.  Nothing too outstanding about it."
""
""
""
""
"The Scores on this say it all! Very Good!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For when you're looking for something heavy that is affordable, well made and  really drinkable, drink 'Sumpin Ale.  It's just spot on for providing a nice hop aroma without overwhelming a really clean malt flavor.  The body is just fabulous, as is the ABV.  I don't find it boozy either.  It's really well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Love it, makes my top 5 list"
"Now that I am in the southwestern US I've been looking for an alternative to Peak Organic Summer Ale, which I love.  This is a very good beer but not quite what I was looking for, i will grab another six and try it again.  I will still keep searching for something similar to the Peak Organic though."
"The smell of spiced fruit and orange peel follow immediately into the flavor up front that turns into a great, smooth but dry bitter finish.  Another from Lagunitas that doesn't disappoint."
""
""
""
"A beautiful looking pale ale! Golden yellow translucent body with a minimal egg white head. Pine hops punch through other clean/soapy smells, hinting at a very refreshing brew. Tastes of lemon, orange, and pear juices. Possibly some biscuity malts there, but piney hops overtake the taste buds before there's any chance of balance. Feels light and refreshing. Subtle carbonated and somewhat creamy. Overall, one of the most refreshing wheat beers I've had, but not enough hop/malt balance for my liking. I was hoping the malts would come out towards the end, as citrusy hops dominated everything, but no dice :/ Still, Little Sumpin' is one tasty Lagunitas brew worth trying."

"crisp, refreshing, drink it if you want a pleasing late winter warmer."
""
"Wife has a 90 minute every night. I picked up this Ca beer in Miami last week and super clean. Nice IBU's and ABV. Hate to type it but a ""mini"" 90 min IPA? Tonight, I am sticking to Founders Dirty Bastard, Centennial and Breakfast Stout. Happy New Years!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An above average IPA. Bitter with strong hop notes. Due to the ABV count, it packs a punch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great beer and probably my favorite from Lagunitas as well, who I am quite the fan of.  I tried this for the first time on thanksgiving and drank it with my brother in law and we both absolutely loved this brew and have since bought it again."
"Way to hoppy for a wheat"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The perfect beer to my taste buds.  Almost like drinking Dank."
""
""
"Smooth and hoppy.  A nice, but different IPA."

"Poured on tap at The Abbey Brewing Co. in Miami. Bronze colored nice foamy head. Very bitter. Great focused taste"

"Didn't know what kind of Ale this was supposed to be when I bought it.   First whiff and I said, ""oh,  a light IPA.""   Then I tasted it.   What the heck,  this ain't no IPA.   Is it?   Could it be?   A wheat beer?  But I don't really like wheat beers.   An orange,  pineapple,  piney sweetness came through that was unexpected and fantastic.   Hops are there,  but really balanced with the other flavors.  This beer is complex,  smooth,  and extremely drinkable.   I wish I had more than just the single I bought.   Definitely buying more of this soon"

"Mostly clear yellow-amber pour with a fluffy two finger pure white head with great retention and lacing.  Wonderful perfumey, flowery, citrus nose with hints of tangerine, grapefruit, floral hops, pine, caramel, and brown sugar.  The taste mirrors the nose with tons of floral, perfumey hoppiness along with hints of grapefruit, tangerine, orange peel, pine, caramel, lemon zest, grass, and brown sugar.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with fizzy carbonation, incredible balance, and a great tangy-sweet finish.  Overall, this is a hugely drinkable beer that's full of flavor that I could definitely drink on a regular basis."

"O (4.25) – Very good beer overall.  I only had one, and really wanted another.  I don’t know if I’d want to drink it all the time, but I will add it to my regular rotation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the flavors don't seem to mesh very well; the citrus-like flavors and bitterness seem very stark. On the other hand, it has the intense hop character of an IPA with a discernible malt influence which comes across as soft and bread-like. The hops are citrusy and bitter, siding with grapefruit, lemon, and lime without the rounding influence of some sweeter, tarter orange, etc."
""
""
""

"I wish there where more ales like these! Very hoppy aroma but is surprisingly smooth on flavor. Herby flavors but not overwhelming. Excellent balance is all I have to say about this brew."

"I love this beer. I have a soft spot for wheat beers and the addition of delicious hops makes for a total homerun."

""
"Perfect beer in my opinion.  Nose is wonderful,  rich, sharp hop aroma with a bit of wheat.  Flavor is on point - buttery smooth, hop and wheat flavors are so good in combination.   I could drink this all day and night.   A real gem from Lagunitas."

"Can't put it in a box, nor can you surmise its greatness by trying to define the pale wheat/IPA characteristics that embody this brew. Slightly fizzy yellow; an inch of clouds; and minimal lace comprise the nonic pint that allows me to see the girth of my fingers on the other side. The smell is delicious; reminiscent of Cameron Diaz in her younger years, yet that is another story. Hmm. Banana chips, forest sap and honey pervade my senses and invite me to delve further into this temporary escape from reality. The taste is superb. I suppose this is a hybrid, because if mother wheat had a love child with the four C's, it would result in this brilliant, yet complex bubblegum hops offering. Body is medium, and warms with additional surprises of grapefruit and peach on the tongue. Every now and then we step outside of our zone and find a beer that surprises us. For me, this was one of those times. The IPA Hunter gives this an overall rating of LARRRRRRGE!"

"Pours a light amber with an off white head. The smell is full of hops with a grapefruit scent being the strongest. The beer itself has many layers to the flavors. Grapefruit and pine notes from the hops mingle well with sweet fruit and spice from the malt. The flavor was well balanced and quite tasty. A favorite for sure."

"Overall: Try it for yourself and see. There are beers that stand out more. This one has its own character but would be one I could point to someone trying to get into the style but not sure if they really like it or not. This is a beer I would also drink as a fan of IPA's. I have drank a lot of intense beers, this isn't one of them. Its just well made and tasty."

"O: This blew my socks off. It's definitely a West Coast, hop forward APA/APWA/IPA, or however people want to categorize it. It has a very nice grapefruit sweetness that comes on first, followed with a slightly bitter wash that then fades into citrusy sweetness again. The alcohol is also completely hidden and it does go down easily. This is an outstanding beer and one of my favorites."
""
""
""
""

"Drank one the other day just because it was in the fridge, and then another; repeat until the floor looks wobbly. Damn that's good, and I don't even like wheat beer."
""
""
""
"This smells at least fairly fresh. Somewhat vibrant citrus and tropical fruit plus muted wheat underneath. The hops don't come across as fresh on the tongue, but this is still damn tasty. Pungent grapefruit plus hints of pineapple and mango all but overwhelm any malt balance. The body was big and sticky. Definitely liking this one. Give me a bottled on date and this would be a regular buy for me."

"Poured a nice clear light orange body with a half finger foamy white head. It looks quite nice, very inviting. Scents of earthy, vegetal hops, hints of tropical fruit, mostly mango, a bit of pine resin, a hint of orange and a little bit of alcohol. Overall impression of aroma is a nicely hop forward aroma that has most all of the typical West Coast aromas on display. Quite nice. Flavor begins with a nice vegetal hop flavor, mingling with pine resin, and a bit of indeterminate citrus. Bitterness is moderate. This moves into a middle with notes of orange zest and flesh and a touch of alcohol. Finish is medium-dry with notes of pine resin, earthy, vegetal hops, faint alcohol and a bit of grainy malt. Aftertaste is tropical fruit, pine resin, a bit of grainy malt and earthy hops. Overall impression is of a nicely hoppy beer that still lets a bit of the wheat malt shine through. Very nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, resinous and slightly chewy with a nicely slick feel with medium-low carbonation. Overall impression is of a good, smooth, resinous mouthfeel that is quite nice. Overall this is a nice hoppy wheat ale that is very pleasant in aroma and flavor and is aided by a nice mouthfeel. It is quite balanced and very drinkable, a good ale."

"Outstanding American Pale Wheat Ale.  Hoppy wheat ale. Pours to a nice deep wheat amber color.  Aromas and tastes of pure bread.  Help hide the bitter hoppiness.  Very smooth and drinkable. Growler favorite.  Little fruit - can't tell which. Dry malty flavor.  Really good."

"O: This is my first beer from Lagunitas, I've heard a lot about them but they've just recently become easy to find in Delaware. Part of me was hoping for this to taste like more of a wheat beer than an IPA but I'm not sure that I really care either way. It's got some really nice malt and hop aroma and flavors and goes down smooth. What else could you ask for? Recommended."

"A high hopped beer with a good deal of sweetness.  To me it has a citrus aroma, and overall fruity flavors although the fact that it's a bit sweet and has a solid amount of hops likely is the cause for this description.  Its taste is not particularly balanced but it doesn't need to be.  It really is a fine refreshment worth savoring, perhaps not worthy of world fame but definitely something I would want in my cup."

"Chicago, can they be added to the 'best beer in the midwest' list?"
"In NYC, I have found the taste quality of this beer to have a pretty high variation. When my brother was visiting NYC (from Petaluma, CA) we got one of the not-so-great six packs from a super market prompting the dreaded criticism of ""It doesn't taste as good out here."" Stores that have a high turnover (like a Whole Foods beer store or specialty beer stores) are your best bet for a relatively fresh batch. With this beer, freshness means everything. With the opening of the Chicago brewing site, hopefully those of us on the east coast can expect to see a steadier stream of fresh Lagunitas Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale."

"I read the beer advocate description for ""American Pale Wheat Ale"" and it says its an Americanized version of a Hefe Weizen. That gets me interested! You know what, I don't want to call this an IPA any more since I don't like IPA that much. Sign my name on the petition for APWA!"

"There is a nice blend of sweetness and ""hoppiness"" in this beer. It has a very nice nose. Gotta love what they put on their bottles! I am curious...they state that the beer has 64.20 for International Bitterness Units (IBUs). Is it acidity/PH? How is that tested? Original gravity and alcohol by volume is certainly easy to test."

"O - granted I'm not a huge fan of the American pale wheat style, I can appreciate when a brewery has a good beer in that style and this is indeed a good brew. Such a great Brewery and a very nice offering on a bright sunny day. This is one of the best in this style."

"After I drank the first few sips of this is tasted really Hoppy but in a good way. Fairly Floral. Good thick taste. Hard to describe but even though it is not the same type of beer it really tasted like a beer that I had last week in California. Pliney the Elder! The taste was about 80% similar. So if you want something that tastes similar but live in Texas like I do go buy some Little Sumpin to satisfy your Pliney the Elder needs."

It feels like an IPA and wheat beer working together and it is such a good combination! The overall product is fresh and citrusy with a smooth creamy finish. I plan on buying this again very soon."

"I discovered this beer several years ago and was enamoured. I'd never had such a suculent tasting IPA before. I was a regular Sierra Nevada Pale Ale guy (which is my everyday) and the flavour here was a wake up call for me. I love this beer. This is one of the best I have ever had and I will grab it without hesitation from the shelf. And like most products from Lagunitas, I have enjoyed its subtlety beautiful flavor and consistency every time I buy it. If you ever have anyone offer this to you at a gathering or whatever, they deserve a kiss right on the mouth... per Lydia Loveless, and hopefully she looks like the Varga Girl on the label."

"Overall- A very interesting and delicious beer that is both wheaty and hoppy. A top among the APWA style for sure. As my first Lagunitas beer I was impressed. A must try for those seeking a tasty and potent warm weather brew."

"This beer just did not appeal to my tastes. I typically like very hoppy beer, but this beer was just a mixed up mess of hops, tastes, bitterness and flavors. Compared to other high quality pale ales and IPA this is just average at best. I think they tried hard but failed."

"Fresh bottle poured into my snifter. Poured a clear amber with a 2 finger head that quickly dropped to 1, and then just some nice lacing. Aroma of grapefruit and pine. Taste was very clean... big notes of pine (somewhat astringent perhaps), with some citrus to boot. Tasted quite like it smelled. A bit of alcohol on the back end (but we are talking about a 7.5% beer, so no hard feelings). Overall, this was very good. Probably not a daily go to, though I would really like to see how it tastes on draft."

"A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale -brewed by Lagunitas Brewing Company with an ABV of 7.5. This brew pours out a nice amber color with a nice white head. The smell is bold and rich with hops and grains. The smell is a little bit overpowering to this brew. The taste is bitter at first but the end is nice. This brew has a nice clean finish. The mouthfeel is great and refreshing. A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale is an ok drinking brew. It is bitter but smooth. I like how this brew is different from most brews on the market. This is not your everyday drinking brew. You have to be in the mood for this brew. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out of 5."

"Bright golden colored with excellent clarity. A half inch off eggshell white head. Pungent aroma of tropical and citrus hops. In the forefront,I taste plenty of citrus hops with the tropical hops and pale wheat playing more of a background note. There back of the palate is fading pungent hops giving way to pale wheat. The mouth is moderately carbonated and refreshing."

"Good deceived me at first smells like a single IPA but once you take your first sip you realize it's a pale ale. Not a huge fan of pale ales but this was good.

"Overall - I got no wheat smell or taste at all. This is really more of an IPA then a wheat beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Another IPA that is common around these parts and easily accessible. Worth the price and definitely one of those go to IPAs in the 6 pack format. Refreshing. Not world class but is consistent. The appearance and smell are so-so but the taste and mouthfeel definitely make up and at the end of the day, aren't those the most important aspects of a beer?"
"As far as Hoppy Wheats go, the IBU is just a tad too high for me and at 7.5% it's a little too alcoholic to make it sessionable (though you really can't taste the alcohol). I feel this is suited more toward IPA fanatics rather than Wheat connoisseurs. Appearance, smell and mouthfeel are great. Overall, this a very good beer and especially suited for summer, just be careful how many you drink, you'll feel it before you know it."
""
"Believe the hype. My go to. Lagunitas hits it out of the park with Sumpin'. It has citrus, it's slightly bitter, it's refreshing, it's great with spicy food. I love the label design of anything Flying Dog, and Sumpin' by Lagunitas is a great looking label. Throwback pinup girl is asking you if you want to take a sip, and you do. She's naughty and knows you like that. I put this beer up against almost anything. Best part is that it's available all the time. The hype isn't a limited availability marketing/snob thing. Only mark I have against it is the difference in pricing locally. I see it at Alberson's for $14.99 a sixer but can pick it up at my favorite ma and pa liquor store for $9.99."

"Solid beer, caramel notes jump out to me. Light, buttery and easy to drink. I would buy again, probably wouldn't brag about it though."

"Thought this might be too hoppy for me based on the IBU but this is the most well balanced hoppy beer I've had. Great all around. I can see why this beer gets the reviews it does. Too bad it's not available where I live. Glad I got to try it. Excellent brew!"

"Pours a clear light-amber to straw color with a thick two finger cap and heavy retention.I didn't pick up the wheat characteristics I was expecting on this one, lots of citrusy hops with a slight malt presence. I picked up the wheat flavor after around my third sip, about two minutes after my pour. The wheat presence lingered on the back of my tongue while all the hops danced around. Moderate and pleasant carbonation throughout the beer. Definitely a sneaky 7.5%."

My wife picked up wheat on the nose as well. Every so often I taste a little of the alcohol but it is we'll masked overall. A very good wheat ale. Thanks again for the taste Bob!"

"A: golden, very clear, looks like a good strong ale or lager.  S: definitely the low light of this beer, get some sweet bready smell and some floral notes up front but it then turns to an almost sour urine smell, sorry but that's what I'm getting here :( T: up front has a familiar ale or strong lager taste, clean and wheaty, getting a real bready malty sweetness at the back of my mouth, finishes very bitter. M: pretty light, good carbonation, pretty dry from all the hops bite.  O: Why did I wait so long to give this a shot, it's a good ale with some real hops bite."

"Nice golden yellow color. Perhaps ever so slightly orange. Head was white and thick but dissipated down to a small soapy top. Hops in the nose. Smells of orange peel and a bitter...something. Hay? Grass? Closer to grass. Yum. Fruity on the tongue. Again, orange is there. Almost an orange soda vibe going to it. There is a bitter tackiness as well. Some pepper. Nice. Doesn't hit you over the head with hop bitterness, but it is there. The fruity orange flavor offsets it well. A beer you can sit and relax with and you wouldn't grow tired of. Light and fizzy in the mouth. This is exactly how I would hope a beer that tastes this way would feel in the mouth. A delight! A beer you can sit and relax with. Something you wouldn't grow tired of. Easy drinking. Love it!"

"This is now my favorite beer, it was my 3rd try at American Hoppy Wheat beers. GumballHead, 80 Acre and then a Little Sumpin. Great cloudy color, terrific foamy head. I really like the citrus profiles these beers have. I like that it has a higher ABV%, the tangerine flavors don't cloud or fight the beer taste. I can't wait for the brewery to open up in Chicago."

"My first pass with this beer was mediocre, but the second was much better. The yeast used with this brew is what makes it special. It has a unique and interesting flavor. It is certainly worth trying. It has a bit of a wild yeast character to it while still being clean and refreshing."

"Lagunitas has scored a major hit with this beer. The nose and flavor are addictive and the beer just keeps getting better and better with each passing sip. I love the combination of tropical fruit flavors- they combine to create a flavor that most any person will find acceptable at the very least, including those who are not normally IPA fans. It’s a very tasty beer that earns a big thumbs up from me."

"Overall: This beer isn't very true to the style in my opinion as I don't get much wheat flavor, which is probably why this is my favorite wheat ale lol. This would make for a great lighter tasting and drinkable IPA. I find myself drinking an awful lot of this during the spring and summer months. How is this 7.5%? My favorite Lagunitas's beer along with Hop Stoopid. Highly recommended."
""
""
"O: Extremely drinkable beer, and is one of my go-to session brews. Balanced and very tasty."
""
""
"Probably the best American wheat ale I've had. Wish the fruity character were more pronounced in the flavor, but a great beer, overall."
""
""
"O - A fine wheat that reminds more of a West Coast IPA than a typical wheat beer. Great."
""
"O) I'm rather new to the world of hoppy wheats... if they're all this damn good, it looks like I will have to keep indulging. Great brew Lagunitas!"
"A fantastic ale. At roughly 60 IBUs, this is an ale to recommend to any of your friends, regardless of palate and preferences. Strong floral/citrus aromas with a smooth, two finger head from the bottle. This ale is the perfect supplement to a spring day."
"O - 4.5 - Great beer. I don't think I've had this fresh enough before. Lagunitas is a pretty impressive brewery, great hoppy, big beers."

"Delicious and pleasant tropical IPA (or even a hoppy APA), hard to say anything bad about this beer. Balanced with a decent complexity and huge drinkability, I could drink this the whole day. Perfectly executed, great choice of hops and wheat gave it some roundness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a complex ale. No other way to put it. But it is still easy to drink, warm or cold. With or without food. The way I would describe it to a friend would be... Imagine your favorite Belgian White.. All that bread and banana goodness. Now throw a well balanced single IPA at it. Poof, that's the little sumpin sumpin I think they were talking about. I love this beer and buy it when I see it."
""
""
"Good beer with some taste and appearance lacking."
""
"I was a little reluctant to try this, because I thought it couldn't be as good as Lagunitas Sucks Brown Shugga Substitute. Boy, was I wrong. This is just fantastic! If this is going to be available year-round, it will be in my refridgerator year-round."
""
""
""
""
"This is a great ale! Perfect amount of hop profile on the aftertaste and a sweet fruity taste upfront. Bitterness lingers for a bit but quickly dissipates leaving you wanting another sip. Alcohol is hidden well. This just became one of my favorite hoppy ales. A must try. Next up for me is the Sucks Brown Shugga."
""
"I first tasted this one at an event that included Lagunitas, Ballast Point, and Dogfishhead and I found myself back for several little cups of this newfound gold. An aromatically distinct, smooth ale with almost Brown ale qualities in a hoppier golden form. This one has has quickly become a staple within my rotation of beers that can be bought in a grocery store. A great beer."

"O: The entire staff over at Lagunitas needs to pat themselves on the back for this one. Not only have they devised a geniusly complex and interesting beer, they've also devised some effin' delicious flavors. Hops, wheat, honey, light malts all wrapped up in a devilishly drinkable package. This one'll be finding its way back into my fridge in the future."
""
""
""

"This is an IPA with wheat for all intents and purposes, and a big one at that - big aroma, big flavor. I consider it an excellent and somewhat unique beer among the year-round IPA selection."

"Taste starts with a bit of bread, then an explosion of pineapple, followed by a bunch of mango. Has a mango, pineapple, and tangerine finish, crisp citrusy and light bread aftertaste. Has an above average heaviness with a bit of creaminess, above average carbonation compliments beer nicely."

"Slightly hazed golden brew with more head than Marilyn Chambers ever gave. The aroma and taste are full of so much citrus and tropical fruit it's enough to make Carmen Miranda's head jealous. Goes down smoother than a baby's ass. Highly drinkable and a few of these makes most any woman highly bangable."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 12/21/2013. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big pineapple, mango, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon/orange zest, orange rind, pine, floral, grass, wheat, light honey, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with awesome complexity of bright citrus hops and light-moderate malt balance; with great strength. Taste of big pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon/orange zest, orange rind, light mango, floral, grass, light pine, wheat, light honey, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon/orange zest, orange rind, floral, grass, light pine, wheat, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity of bright citrus/floral hops with light-moderate malt balance; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding IPA! All around awesome complexity and balance of bright hops and light-moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O- This brews best attribute is the look, and it is sexy. But I think this one goes like this... Its not you, its me... We should see other people... Although I can appreciate the the time put into this ale, it just isn't my cup of tea. I remember this one differently though and I need one more go at it to decide."
"A unique take on the style but too light on hop character. Definitely worth grabbing but far from a favorite."
""
""
"O: Lah-goo-KNEE-tuss does it again. A wonderful offering from a brewery that can do no wrong...so far. Just moved to California and can't wait to head down to Petaluma to check out the brewery. *Good game pat* to the boys at Lagunitas (no homo)."
""
""
""
"O- Tastes like a under-carbonated IPA. Definitely a great (albeit, strong) APA for the ABV, but I'm definitely in favor of the more traditional IPAs (like Bell's Two Hearted) in terms of flavor and mouthfeel. This beer honestly gave me a half-chub on the smell, making me expect a hoppy/citrusy IPA, but then it fell flat when it came to taste. I can definitely see how some people like this beer, but it just ain't for me."

"This ale pours a beautiful gold color with a thick lasting white head that leaves a nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is quite hoppy for a wheat ale. There is a little spice and some floral notes present as well. The flavor follows suit. Very fresh, citrusy and a bit spicy. The wheat flavor is subtle and the whole beer comes together very nicely. This is definitely another winner from Lagunitas."

"Purchased from Sprouts in Poway CA. Hay type yellow in color. NIce white head. Smell…wow. Really nice. Grapefruit…citrus, hops. Taste- Holy smokes how is this 7.5ABV? Really light with a very nice hop/bitter bite to it.Cirtus/fruits are prevalent and a nice bitter after taste. One of my personal favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is the best hoppy wheat beer out there, better than 80-Acre and Gumballhead in my opinion. I could throw back 3 or 4 of these pretty quickly ad get myself in trouble with the 7.5%. What a brew!"

"O: An extremely well-constructed beer. Very drinkable. And excellent introduction beer to craft beer curious. Appearance is beautiful. Nose is very light when cold so nose it but do not expect much until it warms. The nose does not grow as big as the taste as it warms. Mouthfeel is awesome. This beer is great."

"A medium-full body and a solid effervescence work well together. There is a strong grapefruit aftertaste, a dry finish and a reasonably warming aspect. A good beer but not right for the style, too many things missing. I wish there was more to it than just hops, hops & hops."
""
""
"Home tasting, 12oz bottle into Snifter. 1/5/14"
""
""
""
"Serve it from a snifter glass, you won't regret it! Embodies a full mouth feel I haven't seen in a lot of IPAs yet. Out of a bottle it will be a little less rewarding taste wise as most of it's quality seems to com from from the aroma, so make sure to stimulate those hops! Mouthfeel on this beer is exactly what I was looking for in an IPA; full mouth feel, great aftertaste, and the head lasts for at least half the beer"
""
""
"The blend of flavors in this one really hits the spot! It begins with a splash of citrus and honey, with a soft, malty center, finishing up with a tail of grassyness and orange rind. It's got a slightly sharp, medium mouthfeel that pleasantly lingers. Overall, this brew defies any sort of set style. Not a bad drink for any time of the day - would over-power a meal but is great on it's own. I may have another one now!"
""
""
"O - I wish I would have waited for the temperature to come up a bit before drinking. But, after it did, this beer tastes wonderful. I don't taste the wheat at all, even though I caught a whiff of it at first smell. Definitely a very citrus, fruity beer. Tastes like an IPA. A great brew by Lagunitas."
""
""

"O: This may be my favorite Lagunitas beer to date(i'll have to give sucks another try). Excellent beer at an amazing value."
"Overall - excellent ale with superb sessionability."
""
""

""
""
""
""
"O-Versatile beer. It can be labeled IPA if need be. There is enough bitter hop and pine in it. I tend to keep a sixer at all times of Sumpin' Sumpin'. Great alone or with food. Super refreshing that doesn't compromise on flavor. I love it's level of 7.5% ABV as well. Brownie points for the artsy vintage bottle label."

"Overall- outstanding beer!"

"O - a good beer by Lagunitas. The hops really linger on my tongue which is interesting considering this isn't an IPA and it reminds me a lot of them. Personally not a big hop head which may be why the bitterness bugs me for just being a pale (and at that with wheat!). I don't find it to be particularly unique but very good nonetheless. Watch out as a 6er of these will get ye!"

"Comes to the table a slightly cloudy light golden color with a smallish off white head that dissipates quickly. Aromas of citrus grapefruit and lemon with bits of bread and spice. The flavor follows quite well a citrus hoppy ale with a bit of bready malt and spicy wheat. Medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a slick almost bubbly mouthfeel. Pretty damn good for a hoppy wheat beer, thanks Todd for suggesting it, I wouldn't have ordered it on my own."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is pretty damn good. Not a huge wheat fan, but these guys did it right. highly recommend."
"Another very solid beer from Lagunitas. Drank more like an IPA or APA than a pale wheat, not very much wheat characteristic however still an excellent beer that packs a puch in ABV yet I could still throw back five or six of"

"i had another bottle and upgraded my review a couple of pt's today to bad grocer so greedy they would sell many more"

"Pours a clear golden with a full head that laces well. Light nose of piney hops, with citrus in the background, against a touch of malt sweetness. Light body and well carbonated. Taste is mostly piney hops against some grapefruit and sweetness. Well balanced, but not very flavorful or complex overall. Clean finish with a bit of hop flavor and bitterness. Slight grapefruit bitterness tends to linger."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance has a nice golden amber color supporting a thin dissipating head leaving fair lace. Smell has a nice balance of malt and hops bringing out a sweet citrusy aroma. Taste has that same balance with the sweet malt and hop that finishes clean. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. One of the better and easier drinking IPA's I've had in awhile."

"This is one of my favorite brews from Lagunitas, available year round, it is a regular in my IIPA rotation. I consider it a top 10 in the IIPA's I have tasted."

"It is difficult to find American wheat ales that aren't pretty insipid to my palate, even from decent breweries. American wheat is such a broad style and many err on the side of bland and bubbly, presumably a profit-driven decision. On the other hand, Lagunitas rarely if ever disappoints and has a reputation for heavy-handed hopping so I snagged a six-pack of this when I happened upon it at a so-called wine market that also has a decent craft selection. Worth every penny. A bottle of this elixir pours a pleasing golden yellow with a lot of thick white head. The brewer wanted that classic wheat head retention and executed this variable like a pro ... Stuff sat there like meringue. Aroma was also pleasantly evocative of lemon meringue pie, among other signs of a solid malt-hops balance ... I get mixed citrus, a grainy spice, and a little resin or pine all on top of a graham cracker malt backbone. Palate is fairly chewy, creamy and smooth but pungently bitter: Lemon, lime, orange, and grapefruit, passion fruit and cantaloupe, starfruit, apricot, and a touch of something that recalls white wine, this starts like a fruit bowl but ends with a grainy, bitter coda of piney wood, green bananas, and some floral components that evoke tobacco or sweetgrass. Not particularly estery or phenolic as per the American style, this is a wheat ale hopped like an IPA and is the perfect antidote to North American wheat beers that taste like foam and not much else. May be too bitter for some expecting a more traditional wheat experience."
""
""
"Pale straw appearance, thick bubbly head with Citrus, pine, tropical fruit in the nose with cereal and hay in the background. Taste is sweet without being cloying, with fresh bread crust, bright and lively, with fruity hops reminiscent of passion fruit,mango, guava, dragon fruit. Medium thin mouthfeel, highly carbonated. Delicious beer, truly unique."
""
""
"I really enjoyed this beer! Pours great, smells excellent, and tastes even better. Flavor lingers in your mouth, begging you to have another - and I think I will!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall....try it....just try it."

"O- This was pretty good. I get the feeling (or at least hope) that this bottle may have been a bit on the older side. I'll try again sometime in the future."

"If I had to venture a guess, I would say this bottle is a little past it's prime. And I'm sure this beer is much juicier when more fresh. As is, this beer has an under whelming set of flavors."

"Took the beer straight from a 38-degree fridge and poured it into a pint glass. The head was minimal, even with a rather careless pour down the side of the glass. While small, the head is very tight, and it coats the glass all the way down. At cold fridge temperature, its flavor doesn't have a chance to really open up. Carbonation dominates your tongue. Let it warm up to the mid to high 40s, and the beer comes alive. It's smells like honey wheat bread, and tastes about the same, with a lingering maltiness, and a sweetness that sticks with you. Overall, it's a very good beer that is nice to sip on when you get home from work."
""

"My favorite go to beer. Never disappoints....compliments any meal, love it with sushi ...if I can't find anything new I can always rely on Lil to satisfy my thirst!!! Fresh and hoppy it can be enjoyed all year round. Even non-beer drinkers can enjoy this beer."

"What a nice surprise to find in the old publix beer case. Whoever the beer buyer for these lames are finally made good. What a great beer! Most things from Cali usually are a bit weird for my taste. However this sweet concoction is worthy of being in a cooler at a bama Bon fire anytime. Nice hoppiness with a smooth wit beer type finish. That is all."

"Poured from bottle into a mason jar, yeah it's a Ball don't worry. Pours slightly hazy orange with a nice two finger white head. Smell is sweet hops, wheat, pine. taste is full of perfectly balanced wheat with sweet piney hops, plenty of citrus, some pineapple, some other sweet fruity notes. I love this beer, definitely a perfect west coast hybrid of an ipa and a wheat beer. As a lover of both styles this is a winner for me."

"O: well it took me a couple of trips to NY to get it, but I finally did, and it was worth it. This is a great beer. Nice and easy to drink, full of flavor and what I expected from this brewer. Lagunitas was the brewer that started changing my mind on the west coast style of beer and this has completed the conversion. I will be buying more on my next trip."

"The Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale is the perfect balance of hops and taste. It pours smoothly with a slight head and the colour is fantastic. When taking a sniff of the beer you can clearly smell the hops but it isn't overpowering. It's as if there is enough to say I'm here but I'm not going to melt your face off. The taste is very similar. You get the boldness of the hops, but the aftertaste is smooth and lacks the bitterness of some overly hoppy ales."

"Overall pretty good. Personally I would rather have a little more malt in the backbone of this one. The hops are balanced out in the aroma but not in the taste. I do like the lightness in body for the ABV. This one does not taste as strong as it is."

"Pours light amber, almost yellow color with finger width foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are okay.  Has a citric aroma.  Slightly piney.  Lightly citric malty taste up front with a nice bitter piney hop at the end with a wheat edge.  Bitter soapy aftertaste that is great.  Excellent beer.  Definitely one of my favorites."

"O-Well done. I wasn't expecting so many hops but I enjoyed it. It's more of an IPA than an APA, but, whatever. It's delicious."

"As for ALSS this beer is Lagunitas in a nutshell, playful name, unique flavor and a very solid beer. Like all their IPAs, it pours out very light in color with a light lacy head. The body is nice, not too heavy but obviously qualifies as a light DIPA. I just wish I could pickup a half barrel for my fridge!"

"O: Uniquely foamy, extremely entertaining for an AIPA (yes, I deviate from beeradvocate's classification, as the packaging suggested many do). Great hop complexity, yet I feel that most other brews in this category that I've sampled can provide the same profundity. Maybe my hops palate hasn't been properly developed (quite possible), maybe I've only been sampling the finest of AIPA's (possible), but it didn't live up to its casing's hopefulness of tasting 'everything anew'. Still a great beer!"

"O: the wheat really shines through on this one, and im not getting the hop profile I would expect from a beer going neck and neck with gumball head. I think I prefer this beer out of the bottle because I get less wheat taste from it. I will drink it again because there are 5 left from the 6-pack. I would like to try this beer fresh from the brewery to get a better idea of where they were trying to take the hop profile."

"Champagne like carbonation and surprising bright orange. transparent. fruity and hoppy on the nose with some warm spices. smooth taste, light, but hinting towards an amber, but like a not so bitter ipa. pretty damn delicious. smooth on the tongue, light to medium body. I would certainly drink again. delicious."

"O: I'm sold. I had been avoiding this one for almost two years, simply due to the fact that it's labeled a ""wheat beer"". I should kick myself. This is a deliciously hopped beer with an amazingly light body. Considering the mad availability and downright reasonable price, I have a new staple IPA."

"Overall: Quite powerful for a pale ale, particularly one with wheat, I should think! But the sweet secondary flavors made this something special, and the hops were zany and enjoyable. Too much going on for this to be a sessionable beer, but definitely something one ought to try! Can't give this more than a 4 overall, simply because I felt it was more of an IPA than an APA."

"I have had this many a time, but for some reason never gave it a score. I see why people compare it to Sucks.... All Lagunitas beers seem to have that amazing citrus quality that I for one just love. They are all different in there way, some more malty, some more bitter, some more piney.... But I think we can all agree you know a Lagunitas beer when you taste it!"

Although I personally didn't like the bitterness the aftertaste left, that is just my personal opinion. Would definitely recommend it if you like this style of beer."

"O - I wish all wheat beers tasted like this. This is far closer to an APA or even an IPA. My ratings are biased by my preference. If I rated on style, it'd be lower, but that would be a disservice to the beer. This beer is insanely good, and you owe it to yourself, if you're on this site, to get it if it's available. One of my top 10, across all styles."

"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Deep golden to orange with nice foamy head. Smell is amazing. Lots of bright citrus fruit with a hint a pine. Quite hoppy for a wheat beer but very tasty. Sour lemon tartness and bready with a full body. Some sweetness from the malt is present but it's balanced by the bready yeast and wheat, by the lemony sourness and by the hops. Not what I was expecting but very enjoyable."
"O- Never had a Lagunitas beer and tried this on a recommendation. I was not disappointed. It was also my first pale ale wheat beer, and it held up well. For sure would have again and recommend it to anyone considering it."

"A: Nice thin layer of foam that sticks around, some decent lacing along the edge, light gold with hint of copper – 4.00, S: Amazing nose – very gentle sweetness, lots of tropical fruits including pineapple and some citric grapefruit, quite floral, bready malts though they definitely play second fiddle to the hops – 4.50, T: Tons of grapefruit and lemon zest, hint of chalkiness and heap of bitterness, subtle sweetness – 4.50, M: Mouth feel is crisp and clean – 4.25, D: Very refreshing with wonderful hop bite, extremely drinkable beer – 4.25"

"O - This is a dangerous beer, super balanced, very tasty, and yet refreshing especially when cold despite the higher alcohol content. This is one of those beers that could be treated as a session beer but could have you stumbling home afterwards. Wonderful stuff."

"First opening this beer, I was impressed by its smell and moved quickly to get a taste in. The beer first hit as a great bitter to a kind of spicy ting at the end. It provided me with interest at first taste but for some reason after the first taste I lacked the full first experience and was dismayed. Waited a little bit and tried it again and it provided a decent taste. I'm not a fan of this beer but I can see the uniqueness of spicy ting that some may appreciate."

"Beer is a gauzy golden amber with a light head. Aroma is of citrus hops, tangerine, bread. Taste start off with a modest malt taste and ends with a lingering hop hit of grapefruit rind. Very crisp and refreshing. Mouthfeel is very good. It is nicely carbonated and easy to drink. Overall a very well balanced, citrus-ey pale ale. Drinkable and delicious."

"I had my first LALSSA a month or so before I started writing reviews on BA. I remember it being excellent. This one did not change my opinion. I'm on a taste-everything-new-you-can-afford-to-pour-down-your-gullet-and-a-few-you-can't summer binge, but when that is done, I'm expecting this one will be on my list of repeat buys for 2014 and beyond. That is if I'm still allowed to drink beer when national health fascism kicks in.."

""
""
""
""
"Described as a Pale Wheat Ale, I'd rival any DIPA with the fruitiness of the hops here. Tons of character as tangerines, grapefruit, peach, apricot, lemon and orange burst onto a backdrop of floral pine. The back bone wheat is lost in a juicy fruit array. This is so well done, so good and tasty, I'd put it against so many of the top dogs."

""
""
""
""
"O: 4.50 - I was initially of the impression that Laguintas was one of the most overrated West Coast breweries but, suffice it to say, my opinion has changed dramatically with several of their recent offerings including this one; this is a really refreshing American wheat ale with lots of the West Coast IPA characteristics; I could put several of these done without feeling full and enjoy every taste; this is also exceptionally reasonably priced for a 6 pack for this caliber"

"O: I love this beer; I love hoppy wheats in general and this one is toward the front of the pack"
""
"Pours light gold and clear with two fingers of foam that won’t fall down. Lots of clinging lace. The nose is grapefruit, pine and a little resin. As it warms it smells like wheat and honey. The malt is a surprising standout in the glass. Bready and lots of biscuit. The hops are vigorous earthy and herbal. Their spiciness is tamed down by the big malt character. What a surprise this beer was. A celebration of hops without being overly fruity or bitter. A celebration of pale malt that was straightforward and not overly sweet . Robust yet easy to drink with a lightly oily mouthfeel and a long dry finish. This beer really does have a little sumpin’ sumpin’."

Works well for the warm weather. What's there not to like? I think with this one and ton of past successes I've had with Lagunitas, I can officially call them one of my new favorites. Well done, keep it up as always!"

"(O)- Definitely a solid beer for the style. Everything in the right place and well balanced, if not a touch more hoppy than the norm."

"Overall- a great daily drinker despite the higher ABV. I would have another with a side of Thai food or Jalepeno Poppers."

"O - Such a sessionable, complex, reasonably priced year round brew! Definitely one of my favorites from Lagunitas; my favorite brewery."
""
""

""
"O: Wheat beers typically aren't my thing, but it's hard to dislike anything Lagunitas hops up. Easily my favorite wheat beer as of now. Sumpin' Sumpin' is surely deserving of the praise it gets."

"M: Light and refreshing, in spite of how complex and full the flavor is. A bit spicy, but goes down smoothly and doesn't linger."
""
""
""

"This beer can best be described as sort of a wheat IPA. It pours a beautiful golden orange with minimal lacing. The aroma is very nice with flowery hops notes, citrus and grapefruit. The mouth feel is a little thin, But, after all, it's a wheat beer. The taste is like a light wheat IPA. This is one of my favorite summer beers. It is much more interesting than other wheat beers and will please hop heads- well hopped but not too bitter."

"O: Great beer, good smell, taste, bitterness, if you haven't tried this yet definitely pick it up next time you see it, definitely worth the buy"

"I suppose this is one way to brew the best of a style, hop the hell out of a beer with some wheat malt and try to pass it off as a ""Pale Wheat Ale"". However you brand this one its great and I'd buy it again in a flash"
""
""
""
"O: I really liked this one and it will make a regular appearance in my beer lineup - particularly now that the hot weather has finally arrived."
"O- One of my favorite Lagunitas beers. I always just assumed (as have many others) that it was an IPA because that's what it drinks like but lo and behold: it's a wheat beer and a damn delicious one at that."

"Average head, which maintained. Plenty of lacing. Pours a beautiful deep golden color. The smell was understated. An interesting combination of fruity/hoppy flavor. The citrus fruitiness cuts the hoppy bitterness for a delicate balance that was quite drinkable. The 7.5% ABV was surprising. I was looking for a spring/summer ale to replace my beloved quads, and this just might fit the bill."

"O: Great, well-rounded, original beer. A must try. Best I have had from Lagunitas. Tastes like 100 degree day in Petaluma. Bravo! Went from a sample to hadda have a six pack. Could easily be an every day beer, but at 7.5% a little too strong for me, and my every day beer has to be in cans (It is Dales Pale Ale)."
""
""

"Overall - an almost perfect beer for a hophead looking for something a little (but not too) different to have on the beach or by the pool!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this a pleasant find and Lagunitas has become one of my favorite breweries with this and other offerings. I would have thought this was an IPA if B.A. had not told me the true style. The wheat adds a sweetness and smoothness that is not normally present in an IPA(I keep thinking of this as an IPA). I will be picking up more of this."

"12oz bottle, pours a pale, golden-straw color with slight haze, nice rocky, white head holds good retention & leaves thick lacing on the glass. Juicy, fruity aroma, juicy fruit gum, tropical, mango, floral hop. It's tangy and a bit tart, tropical fruit, mango, mandarin, juicy fruit gum, mild bitterness on the clean finish. Medium body, nice carbonation allows flavors to meld on the palate. Overall, I always enjoy this hopped up version of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Really nice flavors here; perfect for summertime, but with the higher ABV it's less sessionable than most APWA's."
""
"A hazy dark golden in color. Aromas of various citrus fruits, and some pine cone. Taste begins with some apricot, then a bready middle, and a piney aftertaste. Mouthfeel is extra rich and creamy. Overall a quite strong, but quite good wheat beer. I assumed it was an IPA before I went to BA."

"Overall: pretty good but i think ill take oberon or all day ipa over it for a summer beer."
"Overall, a very hoppy pale wheat ale, just what you want from your west coast hop gurus. The wheat malt adds a nice complexity, and certainly makes it drinkable, but I kind of wish they went with all barley malt, the tartness gets in the way of the hop character a tad. Still, a very minor gripe for a beer I buy with great frequency, especially during the hot summer days."

""
""
""
""
""
"So yummy. Very refreshing and crisp with tons of hop smell and taste, but still as drinkable as a regular pale ale. I think the half wheat malt gives it a great refreshing mouthfeel as well. Just love the taste of this beer. I love SN's Pale Ale as a go to for a drinkable beer with food or something on a hot day, but when I want that with more hop and richer flavors I go for the little sumpin sumpins."

"Pours a beautiful brass color with a 3 finger head that is very slow to recede, but leaves a nice bit of lace when it does. Nose is full of hops--citrus and pine, maybe a touch of bread. Mouthfeel is smooth, with good body and nearly-undetectable alcohol. Taste is boldly bitter, with more grapefruit than pine in the taste compared to the nose, clean on the palate, not too astringent, extremely easy to drink. A top-drawer wheat IPA, one of the best I've had. Too bad it's a limited release!"

"There isn't too much depth and complexity to this beer, it's a solid choice if you're looking for a nice summer ale with plenty of dry hops and bitterness, but mild enough for the non-IPA enthusiasts to enjoy. The wheat really shines through, and begs for a zesty food pairing; tacos, guacamole, ceviche, or pretty much anything fresh cilantro. That's how I enjoyed it. The flavor doesn't linger long, and the ABV isn't killer."

"Very nice golden honey color, with a decent head and beautiful lacing. Smell isn't as pronounced as I'd expect, slight notes of honey, pine and grapefruit. Nice malty flavor, with subtle citric fruits and light, damp woodiness, with a surprisingly tropical fruit note. Light mouth feel, nicely carbonated. Overall a great pale wheat ale, perfect for the first warm day of the year."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Shocked by this, not a traditional wheat beer by any means, drinks more like a great APA, or IPA, lots of delicious fruity hop flavor thats refreshing and smooth. Lagunitas still tops my favorite breweries."

"O - Overall, It was pretty solid. Tastes like your typical IPA. I think it's placed under the wrong style honestly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - the best representation of a style that I generally don't like. Every other wheat pale I've tried seemed confused and unbalanced. Lagunitas hit the nail on the head as far as mix of hops to pair with the wheat. Great summer day beer."

"Poured this American Pale Wheat Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This ale poured a clear pale color, produced a thick white head, left an OUTSTANDING amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of fresh baked bread and mega amounts of floral hops. Medium bodied this wheat ale had a foundation of soft malted wheat, that gives way to a citric hops. By far the best American Pale Wheat Ale I have sampled. Nothing ordinary about this beer."

"really good beer went well with my kobe burger! I suggest drinking it with a frosted mug,and be careful drinking it .it sneaks up on you.i love it i love it ilove it! nice bottle bartender suggested it!also women like it its a good little conversatin piece!"

"O- What a great tasting, smelling and overall drinking experience. The flavors hide the high ABV very nicely. Very sessionable, three bottles later I was feeling as good as it gets. This is a great brew but is more of an IPA than a wheat ale. Remarkable first impressions from this brewery. I sure do love living in Southern California and seeing sixers of this within walking distance of my house. Does it get any better? Not by much Im thinking, not by much. I would rate this a WC offering."

"I was really looking forward to trying this beer, since people say it's a lot like Gumballhead, and some say it's better. It smells amazing, but as far as taste goes, I wouldn't have it again: the bitterness of the hops is overbearing and there doesn't seem much else to the flavor. There is no subtle complexity that Gumballhead has. This beer tastes like an IPA, and I'm not an IPA fan. Wish it had less bitterness and more of a complex wheat flavor."

"I can't say enough about this beer. This is my go to brew. When poured it has a beautiful golden appearance. It smells very hoppy with a fruitiness tone, I get the cascade hops instantly. Every bottle I have tried has the same crisp, full , fresh taste! Like I said , If I am having trouble deciding, I always grab a 6 of this."

"A really interesting beer. Very fruity, in a varied way, like beer fruit punch. Unlike any other beer I've had, and quite enjoyable."
"Overall – Quite delicious. Not the standard hopped brew which is loaded with citrus hop, this one has a very nice hopped profile, blending nicely a sweeter body with a variety of hop flavors."

""

"O= great beer, it would be hard to drink only one of these. It combines the smooth taste and drinkability of a hefeweisen with the citrusy hops of an IPA. Yummy!"
""
"this is the 5th beer ive tried from lagunitas. some were pretty good and some were really good. this little sumpin ale is also a good one. the color is really nice very clear and golden colored. there is a ton of lacing. the smell is really hoppy. it tastes like a good solid ale....not as much citrus as an ipa...which is why i usually go for one of those, but this is a really solid beer none- the- less. ill keep going after beers from lagunitas, i havnt been let down yet."
""
""
""
"O: Easy to drink. Easily a high-end daily drinker for a ""beer snob"". Wheat malt makes this a lighter version version of their flagship offering but Lagunitas never disappoints me."
""
"It's been a few years since I last had this beers - it was one of the first craft brews I ever had, so I was relatively unaware of what I was trying - and I feel so pleasantly surprised at how fine it is. This is a great beer."
"O: Love me some Lagunitas, and this one doesn't disappoint. They've basically brewed an IPA, just with a wheat malt. I'm excited to try this one in the summer."

"Overall: This beer seems to be more pale ale than wheat, but still a good brew though. Nice and hoppy for a APWA too."

"Overall a fantastic beer. It honestly reminds me a lot of another outstanding American Pale Wheat Ale offering by Boulevard: 80-Acre Hoppy Wheat. If I lived on the West coast outside of Boulevard's footprint, this beer would be a regular go-to. One of the best APWAs on the market today."

"O: Wonderful beer. It's incredible easy to drink, the citrus flavors really shine, and it's ridiculously refreshing. I think I have found my new summer go-to APA/IPA/easy drinking brew."
""
""
""
"O: OK, I really don't get the positive reviews here. This was a boring beer with nothing to offer but a high IBU count. Not quite a drain pour, but not up to the standards I'd have expected from Lagunitas."
""
""
""
""
""

"12oz. bottled served in an SA Perfect Pint glass. Pours a translucent gold with a fizzy, one inch, bright white head that settles into a creamy skim. Delicate clusters of lacing coat the sides of the glass during the tasting. Nose expresses wheat and orange rind. Taste consistent with nose - no real surprises; however, there is a pleasant, easy tartness to the flavor profile, with a light, earthy hops bittering at the finish. Mouthfeel is light in body with a slight astringency and a carbonation that falls just shy of lively. I can't believe I'm just discovering this beer. Easy drinking and refreshing. Looking froward to adding this into my summer rotation."
""
"O - A very enjoyable, well crafted beer. Definitely a beer I will return to time and time again."
""
""
""
"Great beer, this is what AIPA's should be all about. Not sure if the wheat malt made this beer cleaner but whatever it works."
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle poured clear pale golden with a decent head. Tasted like this one may have been born quite a while back, as the aroma of hops was nearly non-existent. The malty middle overwhelmed. I will not buy this bottle again, however I would try a draft just to see how a fresh one compares."
""
"Mmmm...this is friggin' delicious. Poured from a bottle into a goblet, and let me first say, love the pinup-girl label. All beers should have pinup-girl labels. Gave it a good pour, and didn't get much of a head there, but what was there was densely formed by lots of tiny bubbles. For a wheat, not real cloudy (I even gave it a swirl at the end, which I think did absolutely nothing), but really nice light amber color. The nose is great, pine, candy, berry, definitely some sour yeastiness. Love it. Flavor is great, sweet but nice backing bitterness from the hops and alcohol. Mouthfeel is pretty perfect, light with a punch. Overall, this is a kickass beer. Totally worthy of the over-ten-bucks pricetag, and I will definitely get this again."
"Absolutely one of my favorite beers!! honestly can go good with anything, but you are better off enjoying this beer by itself. it has so much too offer, such great combination between the yeast and malt's making this an outstanding brew. you can put this on my list of top beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is by far the finest wheat beer I have had. As a hophead, it satisfies my need for bitterness than most other wheat beers lack. I truly hope that more brewers head in the direction of aggressively hopped wheat ales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a good beer. That being said, it was hoppier and less wheat-like than I was expecting from the style."
""
""
""
""
"Wheat beer done IPA assertive. Crisp, clean and hoppy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Another interesting Lagunitas brew. Deceptively smooth but packs enough of a punch to stand alone quite well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I think you have to really like this style to go back to it. Too many other good offerings from this brewery and at least for me, too many better styles. That being said, this is the worst brew I've had from Lagunitas and given the rating, it should speak volumes about their beers."

"I would call this an IPA like Flower Power instead of a wheaty pale ale. It doesn't have the pop that some West Coast IPAs have because of the wheat and malt. I like the balance of this beer. I would recommend it for people trying to get into IPAs because of the good smooth bitterness."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a slightly hazy straw with a large foamy head. Smells of piney and earthy hops, and lots of malt. Taste is initially very hoppy with earthy tones, but finishes really syrupy, not what I was expecting at all after the smell. It doesn't fully ruin it, but it does bring it down a little. Beer is carbonated correctly and for its light body, even with the syrupy taste still goes down smooth. Overall, an above average beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In general, I like the hop flavor but the bitterness is too much, or there is not the right malt sweetness to back it up. The quality is there, it's just not quite my taste. Not sure if I will get this again."
""
""
""
""
"O- Can't believe this is my first time trying this beer. Sweet and sticky with just a decent amount of hops. This is so drinkable, I think I'll be having more of this very soon in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lagunitas strikes again. This beer has a lot of character. At first, you think it's another Cali-style, hoppy beer, but it is full of sweet flavors as well. I really dug the range of flavors i experienced from my first whiff to my last sip. Highly recommended. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I like a broad range of beers but most of the time I want something with plenty of flavor. I've always been a fan of the rich roasty creamy stouts and I've never turned down a rich red or brown ale. A sailing buddy introduced me to big hops beers last year and I haven't looked back. The brewery that consistently nails the big hops taste test is Lagunitas. The Lagunitas beer that satisfies me EVERY time I pop one is Little Sumpin' Sumpin'. I will keep drinking and enjoying other beers but I will keep coming back to this one for a looong time!"

"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Overall quite drinkable with that 7.5% abv really integrated well. This was a pretty drinkable brew that I would not mind having again and drinking pretty effortlessly during the summer."

"Once I got on BA to review, I was shocked to see that it's classified on here as a wheat ale... I've never tasted a wheat ale like this. But like the packaging says, labels are often confusing and arbitrary. I'll definitely be making A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale a regular in my fridge."

"I will look to pick up a six pack of this next time I go shopping."

""
""

"Final Thoughts: Does Lagunitas make a beer that isn't an IPA? Whatever the answer, I can't wait to try another offering from them. Would I drink it again? Yep."
""
""
"O. A very good pale wheat, though definitely on the hoppier side. Beautiful nose and well integrated flavors make this a worthwhile visit."
""
"This is a solid IPA with a heavy wheat bill. One of the better IPA-style beers from Lagunitas. If I had never tried Sucks, this would easily be there best. Fresh it's downright silly. Ages pretty quickly, but remains drinkable for some time."
""
"Nice crisp mouthfeel. Overall this is a great beer, but if i reviewed it as a wheat ale i would have to say it is not brewed properly to style. As an ipa it is great though."

""
""
""
"I do have some reservations, due to the fact this is supposedly an american wheat ale."
"O: this is the most perfect beer i've ever tasted. It's so balanced and drinkable you'd never guess it was 7.5%ABV and 65IBU. It's wonderfully aromatic, floral,. and damned tasty. I hope the upcoming homebrew clone Can You Brew It recipe i'm brewing comes within 75% of this beer, because its amazing."
""
""
"Pours clear golden with a thin off white head that quickly clears to bubbles around the edge of the glass. Nose is pine, hops, a little grass, light caramel, sugars, grapefruit and other tropical notes. Great flavors to this IPA - some wheat, bitter grapefruit, orange, light mango, hops, pine, light sugars, touch of lemon, caramel malt in the background. Medium bodied with soft carbontation leading to a bitter sweet finish. A solid IPA !"
""
""

""
""

""
"Overall, this beer is outstanding, and quite a surprise for me. I remember trying Hop Stoopid and being blown away by it as well, and this further solidifies the hype surrounding Lagunitas beers for me. I will definitely recommend it to winos and hop lovers as I find this to be a great well-rounded brew."
""
""
""
"A little late in the season, but this still tastes remarkably fresh. I could go for some spicy, vegetarian Indian with this."
"O: A very good wheat ale with loads of hops flavor that nevertheless doesn't overlap the essential crisp, refreshing wheat character of this beer. The relatively high ABV for the style is also very well-hidden."
""
""
"O: As a hop-head, this is right up my alley. I haven't has many Wheat Beers, but this is about ideal for me. I really enjoyed this one and will be buying more!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very unique beer, tasty, no doubt. Possibly a little too sweet at first, but it mellows out nicely and turn into one hell of a drinker. Wheaty and fruity all around, with a nice alcohol warming through and through. Not sure if I'm in love with some of the hop flavors, though."
""
""
"o: one of my absolute favorites that got me into craft beer to begin with."

"O: I'm not a hop head, but can appreciate this hop-forward wheat beer. It's put together well and makes for a tasty brew. Recommended"
""

"Overall: A great beer to drink. I typically get this as a treat every so often since it is one of my favorites and typically a few dollars more than Sierra Nevada. A real good beer and I really like A Little Sumpin' Wild as well if you can find it."

"Overall, a really good beer and probably my favorite so far from Lagunitas. Awesome example of the style and dangerously drinkable with the 7.5% completely hidden. One to pick up whenever possible."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Paired with an awesome burger from Hole in the Wall on the westside of LA, which I would say leaves Umami and even Father's Office in the dust. Great hops on a wheat base, making a great, bright brew which is both familiar and original going beyond the typical west coast IPA recipe."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The mouthfeel is a tad slicker than most American Pale Wheat Ales, which tend to be pretty effervescent. This is due to all of the hop oils, no doubt. Still refreshing though. Overall this is about as good a beer as the pale wheat style can be."

""
""
""
""
"Overall a very refreshing beer. Me and miss sumpin' will be spending some serious time together this summer. I tried this beer on a cool fall day and liked it ok, but its unseasonably warm today and after a long bike ride this is it. Lagunitas is a really good brewery."

"The wheat malt in this cleanly hopped, high-ABV pale ale creates a depth and complexity of flavor that I'll crave. Delicious."
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Crisp and refreshing. Medium-light body. Slightly above average carbonation. Finish is dry with a lingering bitterness. A unique and fantastic offering from Lagunitas. Quickly becoming one of my favorties. One of the best drinking beers when it's fresh."
""
"I had it first on tap and loved, even non craft beer drinkers liked it. It is what gumball head wants to be when it grows up. It is like a wheat IPA with great aroma. It is best when fresh so if you buy it drink it. It loses its fruity aroma and flavor as it ages. try to buy fresh shipments and you will have a new favorite beer."

"O: More complexity than your typical pale wheat beer. The abundance of hops certainly contributes to this. Some of the hop characteristics remind me of Flower Power although I wouldn’t say that these are similar beers. A terrific full-flavored warm weather beer."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall Drinkability: A suprising ale. The alcohol really hits you on this one. Great flavors and smells."
""
""

"Overall, a highly drinkable, balanced ale. Unique and delicious. I could pound a 6 pack without even thinking twice."

"Pours a yellow, slightly orange, lightly hazy brew, with nice dense head. Smells citrus, and pine, and hoppy great with some grain and malt notes...almost a sweetness there. Taste is malt and grain first, but gives to bitterness, and floral, and tropical fruits, and manufactured new-ness. Yep, you read that right, in a good, freshly made way. Mouthfeel is light for this, with a creaminess, and moderate hop echo...but I wish it to be more... and a winter warming that is nice, without being wacked with alcohol. A really terrific beer that I hope to have again."
""
"D - Excellent beer. I get this all the time and I just logged onto Beer Advocate to check out what I originally wrote about it and realized I'd never reviewed it. I get this beer all the time, though. It's a great session beer for Heavy Drinking Just Out Of College Beer Lovers. I highly recommend it."
""
""
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, as I have many others that Laguanitas has made. This beer is an excellent drinker, light, crisp and refreshing while still giving bold hop flavor that we all love. A potent ABV, fantastic appearance, and superb smell add to make this a very well rounded beer. One to add to my ""always in stock"" in my fridge."
""
""
""
"A really good IPA with some wheat malt base. Interesting and delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A fantastic, well-crafted ale which gives pliny a run for its money. Glad they didn't overdo the wheat portion, tastes more like a quality IPA to me. Highly recommended."
"Overall, it reminds me a good bit of Lagunitas IPA, but it just has more oomph. A Little Sumpin', Sumpin', if you will. Certainly not for those new to craft. This beer's heavy on the hops with just a dash of malt. A fantastic beer on all counts."
""

"Overall, this was a really enjoyable, thirst-quenching, wheat beer with some great hop flavors going on throughout the flavor profile. I will be revisiting this one come summer time."
"Overall: Although i was looking for a bit more wheat, this beer is pretty amazing. This is the best beer I've had in quite a while. Way to go Lagunitas."
"Overall this beer is absolute quality! It has flavor, appetizing smell, strength (7.5% ABV), and a dry enough after-taste to make you want to drink more...and more...and more...y mas para mi hermanos latinos! But it...now...seriously...why are you still here...go out and buy it."
""
"Another winner for Lagunitas with a powerful hop punch to the palate yet still clean and refreshing."

"O: I'm very impressed by this beer. Great citrus hop presence with a sweet malt and wheat body. I will definitely revisit in the future."
""
""
""
"Wow - this is one amazing brew. Now I wish I could grab one whenever I like. A ton of aromatic hops and plenty of malt. The sweetness borders on sugary, but is kept in check by hop bitterness. Can't say I taste much wheat (as this is supposed to be a wheat ale) - it's more like an American IPA in character. Might also benefit from bottle conditioning? But I'm nit-picking; this is a superb beer and goes into my top 10. Add it to your must-try list and grab one if you see it."

"O: This is an excellent beer; one of the best I've had. Much better than I was even expecting. Dangerously drinkable even with the high ABV. This is one that will make it's way into my regular lineup and will probably always be in my fridge come the summer."
""

"O: wow, I actually did not think this beer was going to be this good. Right now, I'm wishing I would have bought a six pack of this."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a clear, medium golden amber. One finger fine off-white head with a hint of wheat. Flavor follows, excellent retention and lacing. Great aroma of pine and citrus hops, lemon, caramel malt, pine and citrus hops with grapefruit and lemon, light sweet malt supports the other flavors. Wheat flavors subdued by the hops and citrus. Very nice medium, creamy body with an superb mouth feel. Very tasty and well made. Not really to style for an American pale wheat ale; not cloudy, not pale, wheat element rather subdued. However judged as another fine Lagunitas product, an interesting and tasty take on a wheat ale."
""
""
""
"Smell was ripe citrus fruit. Grapefruit and oranges, and pine. Hints of wheat and pale malt. Taste is very similar to nose. Loads of ripe citrus, orange, grapefruit, pineapple along with wheat, cracker and even a little bite of pine resin. Medium bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium with strong carbonation. Very juicy. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
"Would I buy it again? Yes."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is by far the best Lagunitas brew I've had to date.... I wish this weren't a seasonal, because it's excellent.... Definitely pick yourself up a six-pack of this brew while it lasts.... I certainly will be grabbing another."

"I was so tempted to refer to this beer as an outstanding version of a session ale but, at 7.5% ABV, this is anything but that. A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale is another outstanding example of the no frills kind-of-beers that the folks at Lagunitas are so good at creating."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Great for an IPA, I'd happily grab a six pack. If you wanted a wheat beer I think you'd be more disappointed. The label uses the word hops eight times though, so I don't see that happening too often."
"O - A pleasant, soft, fruity, floral, sweet-ish sipper. There's one note in the nose I don't like, but that's the only thing I don't like."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of my favorite IPAs, even though it's technically classified as an ""American Pale Wheat Ale."" It has a ton of fresh flavor and depth of body, and the subtle nuances in smell/taste are what really make it great. There are tons of piney-grapefruit honey hops, bread-y yeast, and a bit of fruit flavor like apple and pear. There is also a little sweetness to the hops that balances out the whole beer. I could have this beer again and again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A really good juicy ale. Has all the citrus flavor you expect from a West Coast IPA, but with more wheat and less bitterness."
""
""
"This pours a toasted straw color. Unlike your typical “wheat beer” this has a gobsmack of hops. There’s a light aroma with some floral notes… and Lagunitas’ trademark hop aroma. Flavor is smooth, light, with a bit of a funk—and some generous hopping hiding behind this. It’s strong but hides it well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. This is one of my favorites. So glad they have it in 6 packs. It is now time to put Hop Stoopid in 6 packs. That one is even better."
""
""
""
""
"O - overall, this is an easy drinking ale, and not just your run of the mill pale ale. Definitely would drink this again."
"This beer pours a clear yellow with a thin head and lacing. The aroma is grapefruit and lemons with some wheat malt in the background. The flavor is mainly grapefruit with a mild hop bitterness that is nicely offset by the wheat malt. The mouthfeel is light-medium. Lagunitas A Little Sumpin Sumpin Ale is a good brew. Recommended."
""
""

"Medium body and carbonation levels, a bit oily."

"Edit: This beer is now available in NKY. I'm done for."
""
"O: I will crave this beer until I have another. Haven't been able to get my hands on it. But I will, yes I will!!"
"O - A wheat ale that has enough hoppy bite to keep the IPA lover's attention. I'd have this one with some BBQ, which I did when I tried it. Smoky mesquite and this are made for each other."

"Interesting beer. I picked it up simply because I liked the label. I had no idea what sort of beer it was but the label was attractive. After opening and pouring it into a glass it was apparent that it was a wheat beer which generally I'm not a huge fan of, but the color wasn't off putting and the aroma was pleasant. Nice citrus and wheat notes. I thought it had a slightly floral smell which was at first I wasn't too sure of, but it grew on me. I took my time drinking it and found overall it to be very satisfying and clean. Nothing unpleasant about the beer's head or the consistency in the glass. A great beer for being outside in the warm weather. I wouldn't say I loved it, but could surely see myself drinking it again. I think its the kind of beer that the more you drink of it the more you can enjoy it."

"O- Nice balance beer. Can see a lot of even non-craft drinkers liking this, or I guess a very approachable beer."
""
""
"A stand-out among the American Wheat beers. Really strong hop presence, a little pine and a little resin on the nose. Very crisp feel, bubbly & definitely a little bitter but goes down pretty easy. It's a little strong to be a perfect summer sipper, but it is an excellent."

"Poured from bottle into perfect pint glass. Big fluffy, creamy white, 3 finger head; it's very frothy. Eventually settles, with legit cling. Very nice golden honey, light yellow color. Smell consists of light pine hops, wheat, sweet resinous hop. Taste is similar. Grassy wheat, some pine, cream, sweetness. Mouthfeel is thick, with light bitterness from hops, smooth. Very good, overall. This has been one my favorites since I first tried it. It's crisp and refreshing on this summer evening."

"Pours a honey golden with a huge white foamy head. A nice sweet malt underbody providing some nice doughiness to the aroma sitting alongside some grassy hops and some grapefruit. Flavor offers some moderately bitter grassy and citric hops alongside some sweet wheat malt. A crisp, medium bodied. Overall, not a bad beer."
"The beer pours a clean golden color like very light yellow piss, though there is a little of the wheat haze towards the middle and lots of bubbles tumbling up from the bottom. The head is finger thin with big white bubbles and a nice easy retention at a half a finger that leaves sticky thin clouds of lacing on the side of the glass. The beers smells surprisingly nice and wet with pine hops and some nice citrusy tingles, but I don’t notice any of the wheat in the smell and the malt and yeast seem to be light in the smell. The beer tastes much like it smells, thick with resin-like pine hops. The malts are faint in the initial sip as the hops take the full “blam” but the after taste is a lovely light sweet wheat malt with side tingling from the hops. There are also some nice light citrus tangs in this beer reminiscent of oranges and mango. The mouthfeel is initially really rough with carbonation and the hops bitter bite, leaving the tongue feeling assaulted. The beer is really clean and refreshing on the tongue, but the after feel is only lightly tingly with hop and a slight bitter-burn on the tongue, while the rest of the mouth has a thin sheen of saliva. That initial mouthfeel is too rough for my taste, but mellows out to a more manageable state. Overall the beer a nice hopbomb of a pale wheat ale, reminiscent more of Sierra Nevada’s Pale ale or an IPA than of anything thing else I have tried. This is admittedly my first heavily hopped wheat ale, and I love the hops in it, and the aftertaste of wheat malt is very intriguing, but the rest of it isn’t very different from other ales."

"O - I am OK with a Wheat but usually just because I am out and that's about the best choice on the menu. Also, I love that this is a wheat at ABV 7.50%, I think that is what adds to the mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Lagunitas has redefined the American wheat ale and it is awesome!  It  drinks like an American IPA.  Waves of hop aroma and flavor with malt sweetness to balance.  My favorite American wheat, hands down."
""
"Pretty big complex beer. Big full mouthfeel but goes down smooth. Good carbonation. Sweet tropical fruits with a hint of taffy and caramel. Wheaty goodness on the middle of the palate with a sharp bitter edge. The hops are really bright and fruity and provide a nice balance to the subtle malt body. Great balance and all the flavors play really well together. Great how the hops add to the sweetness and the balance. Very nice. Great damn beer. We need to see more of it NJ."
"Overall: Yeah..it's a good one..had a bbq last weekend...served this one up to some craft drinkers..got some positive feedback. If I had to classify this beer..i'd call it a summertime IPA. I will be buying this one again and I'd recommend."

"O - Once again, not a style I would seek out alot. But, for what it is, Lagunitas has managed to make something drinkable. The high ABV is enjoyable though for many it might make this UNattractive as an option. Just can't bring myself to ""want"" any beers of this nature. Not bad I suppose but not something I would seek out."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden orange color with a nice head on it. Nice citrus floral aroma is a preview of the tastiness that awaits in your glass. This has the hoppiness of an IPA, but the wheat balances the flavor nicely and it has a wonderful mouthfeel. I can't believe this beer is 7.5% ABV... so smooth!"
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a wonderful beer and I'm glad I finally gave it a chance. I would have no idea it's a 7.5 on the ABV scale, it's very well hidden by the sensational flavor and drinkability."
""
""
""
""
"Golden pour, thin frothy head, it has a beautiful floral hop aroma. The taste is similar, very good and heavy hop profile with some exciting funkiness that makes this brew stick out a little. Medium heavy mouthfeel with a great aftertaste that lingers with more of the floral notes you get in the scent."

"Plenty of hops with a bit a malty sweetness, wheat adds great mouthfeel. Quite good."
""
""
""
""
"I'd score this a 5 but I believe in always leaving room for improvement. Amazing hop quality, amazing nose, amazing flavor. How they make a 7% abv beer and keep it so nice for a summer day is beyond me. I had several IPA's after this, including some truly fantastic beers, and they imparted far more bitterness w/o any of the hop flavor. This spoiled my palate because it was so good. Please enjoy..."
""
""
""
"O: Very tastey brew overall, well made, another quality brew from Lagunitas. They never dissapoint. More like a malty/wheaty pale ale. For a summer seasonal it stands out, this is no lawn-mower beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good beer overall, good amount of everything and well balanced throughout, lagunitas never dissappoints."
""
""

"O- Nice offering from lagunitas. I think I prefer this over their Maximus. A winner."

"Overall I enjoyed this much more than I thought I would given how bland and boring most exampled of the style typically are, but I should have known better coming from Lagunitas. This offering is a much better take on the Pale Wheat Ale than most other offerings of this style, even thought I would consider this more a Wheat IPA given the ABV instead of a wheat pale ale. The hoppiness really makes this a great refreshing brew and one I will gladly revisit in a bottle or on draft during the warmer months of the year."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – This is an outstanding beer, but I have one question. American Pale Wheat Ale? This is the same category that Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat and Sam Adam’s Coastal Wheat and Summer Ale is in. Not that there’s anything wrong with those beers, but Lagunitas destroyed all of them with this. Until I read the classification of the brew on BA this morning, I thought this was may be a light IPA, or an aggressively hopped APA. I would have never guessed APWA. Regardless of all that, this is an exceptional beer for a good price that I can get most anytime. I would highly recommend this to anyone, and I will be drinking it again. Well done by Lagunitas, I’m going to call this a hybrid of styles."

"overall, I didn't know what to expect from this one. I would call it a pale ale, but I get some wheat out of it too. good for a hot day and will probably be really good with rich foods"
""
""
"This one is goes perfect after a sunny, early summer day! Delicious!"
"Continuing with my new review format, I enjoyed this delicacy during game seven as my beloved Celtics went to their demise (go Thunder!!!) Poured into a Stone Nonic pint glass. As it says on the bottom of the six pack carrier, this beer defies categorization and I happily agree. As a steady IPA and DIPA consumer, I found this to be a more than refreshing change of pace, it will definitely be a regular in my summer rotation. Heartily endorsed by the White Creek KRU!!!!"

"Overall: A nice different IPA to drink on hot day. No heavy flavors jump out or overpower. Overall a recomendable beer."

"O - A very smooth well balanced beer. Sure I like the Lagunitas yeast strand so I may be partial, but still great. Nice and hoppy but not bitter. Has a sweetness to it."
"Any any rate, I docked it 1/2point for the fact it's more of an IPA than any sort of Pale Wheat Ale. Still a great brew, just not at all what it claims to be."
""
"Overall: This is a great beer and perhaps my favorite from Lagunitas. Definitely a must try if you're into hoppy beers."

""
""

"Overall: This is definitely one of my favorite beers of all time. I've tried almost every release from Lagunitas that has come out in the last 7 years and this ranks up there with the best of them. I hope they never discontinue this one because I will keep buying it and promoting it as long as it's around. Thank you Lagunitas for such a great brew."
"Overall an interesting and original beer, very tasty and hides the abv very well. Have and will continue to buy regularly."
""
""

"O: As others have said, this is more IPA or APA like than a wheat ale, though still well made and tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this one surprised me, it has a lot more citrus and wheat than the nose lets on and it's incredibly good. I was reluctant about trying it before because it costs $9.89 at my work but this beer is fantastic. Definately a Lagunitas brew because they did it proper with the hops, but also really flavorful and balanced. I feel like this beer would be just as ""at home"" next to the pool on a hot day as it would be with a nice meal or even sitting at your computer and just enjoying a beer. Versatile, complex and most importantly, delicious."

"The flavor matches the aroma. Noteworthy alcohol feel and flavor. Good hop bite almost from the beginning. The body is rich and gives an element of rounded malt tastes. I don't really note any wheat in this one, it's a very good pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- It’s a little above average but a good warm weather beer which hides the alcohol."
"O: You could tell this was a Lagunitas brew after the first sip. Huge tropical fruit aromas and flavor. Has that signature west coast tropical thing going on. Very nicely balanced ale and most definitely worth a try."
""

"O: A good beer, overall. Not overly complex, and definitely not a pale wheat ale, but a good IPA with lots of nice hop characters without being overly bitter."

"very bizarre brew here. pours a clear red tinted copper color with a one inch off white head that slowly dissipates. smells like fresh hops, grassy and earthen, english malt backing, some wheat malts as well, but does not smell like a wheat beer and its usually accompanying yeast. flavor is strangely hopped up front, not quite fruity, a bit dry, and mildly spiced. tough to place exactly, but possibly tasting some fresh cascade hops here. feel is good, fuller bodied than most. kind of a hybrid beer in taste and feel, not a wheat beer per se, but not an ipa either. well carbonated, it carries the unique flavors of the hops. overall a cool beer, good bargain, and interesting blend of ingredients. ill most likely have this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Not bad for a wheat & hops beer. 64.20 IBU, 7.5% etoh. Very drinkable! Almost like a desert beer. Has a sweet aftertaste. I first had it had RhodeSide Grill in Arlington, VA. The 2nd time I had it was as Jaleo (a José Andrés restaurant) in Wash DC just last week. Bought a 6 pack at Whole Foods on P street for $9.99. This is one of my top 6 beers for sure!"
"Simply put, this beer is dank. From the complex smell and taste to the heavy mouthfeel, this beer is awesome. I've tried multiple Lagunitas brews, and I'd put this up there with the Lagunitas Sucks and the IPA. Very delicious and totally worth the price I paid for a sixer. Great ale."

""
""
""

"O - This is a flavorful, delicious, representation of a style that I usually find underwhelming and boring. The flavors are of all sorts of fruit and just enough hops to satisfy and balance.

Not only was I lucky enough to acquire a few 6'rs of their Lagunitas Sucks Holiday Ale, it is now very clear that Little Sumpin' Sumpin' was the basis for that Limited Release recipe (albeit the Holiday Ale produced a more substantial head with great lacing). If you missed out on Lagunitas Sucks Holiday Ale, just go get yourself a fresh Sumpin' Sumpin' and you will not be missing anything...Superb!"

"We always keep this beer stocked in the beer fridge. Lagunitas makes some excellent beer, and while many of there beers are said to be similar, the Little Sumpin' rises above in my opinion. Hops, malt, and a little citrus sweetness make this beer perfect for those that like hops but are not considered a ""hophead""."

"D- I had been disappointed by all the other Lagunitas offerings I had tried but this one is very well done."

"I have order this beer twice at a local drinking establishment. I originally picked this beer based upon the name and the brewery, and I was pleasantly awarded for my prejudice. I had never had a beer like this before. It is a refreshing wheat beer along with having the complex flavor profile of the IPA style that I have grown to adore. I cannot get too far into the ASTM profile, but I can say it ranked pretty well in all of them. In the summer, if I were not in the mood for intense maltiness, I would be sure to go with this beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this is a fantastic brew that hits almost every note spot on. While speaking amongst some friends, we have concluded this is one of the best deals available, and if I had to have a nice brew to sip on a a sunny afternoon, there is none better than a little sumpin' sumpin'! Not to mention at $10.49 a sixer with wide availability, this is simply the benchmark."
""
""

"The beer is golden hued and pretty clear. The white head is about a quarter inch thick, leaving ample lacing on the glass. The aroma is nice, gaining strength as the beer is allowed to warm. Hops, citrus (particularly grapefruit) are the primary scents. The flavor takes things up a notch. Wow, what a delicious beer. Hop forward with ample contributions from citrus fruit. Easy to drink like juice. Minimal malt body and alcohol presence. Nice feel. I will be returning to this beer often. Recommended."

"Pours a bright yellow gold with nice transparency . Short, bubbly white head with weak retention. Fresh, zesty hops with bleached yeast, white bread, creamy malts, grapefruits and pineapple on the aroma; floral and mildly earthy. Beautiful fresh hop flavor with smooth lemon zest, grapefruit and wheaty malts. Sour bite with a smooth, bready, hoppy mouthfeel. Clean, fresh aftertaste."

"A little outside of my normal style range, but this one is done well and always enjoyable."

"O: This is almost a tale of two beers. At first, it's one of the best beers I've ever had. Later, it's tiring hop/malt sweetness renders it merely 'good'. Still a nice wheat IPA that's a great value, even when it's less than fresh."
""
"O - Great brew. Good balance in the flavor. Very easy to drink."
""
""
""

"O- This is a unique beer that is sort of a cross between a wheat beer and an IPA. What ever it is it is good. Grab a six pack not a single. You will wish for the six if you don't."

"This beer is a hazy, effervescent, dark-straw colored beverage. Bubbles rise constantly and aggressively through the liquid. The smell is a mix of grapefruit, lemon and crackers. It's a fresh, refreshing smell, but it's a bit static and one-dimensional. Nice aroma...but citrus dominates. The flavor is more nuanced.. There's a lemon-grass and wheat twang flavor, backed by a bit of sweetness and modest hop flavor. Nicely packaged. The beer also hides it's alcohol well. It tastes like a session beer, but the ABV could be dangerous. Some residual sweetness that hints at heaviness, yet the beer stays refreshing. Nice beer."
"O: A really stellar offering from Lagunitas. I applaud them for making really good beer that is pretty accessible to the masses. I could drink this all day."
"Overall: The smell is terrific, and the taste follows it a little too much. The sweetness can be a bit overpowering, but a good beer nonetheless. Would drink again for sure."

"Wow, my tour through the pale ales is showing me that i do like a hoppy beer. I would like to see a touch more malt showing through to balance the hops, but that's not going to stop me from drinking it."
""
""
"Overall (4.0): This is a very good beer. Glad to know this is year-round. It’s pleasant when the hops have died off, but I definitely like this beer fresh-fresh-fresh. Easy drinking and approachable, but not sacrificing character in any way. I like it when there’s some wheat character that’s allowed to shine through in a beer, too—too often the wheat in a beer gets washed out by spices or super-estery yeast notes, so I like it when it’s given its due with a solid ale yeast. Not that I’d consider this a particular wheaty brew—it’s more of a sidenote. But I enjoy it. Well done, Lagunitas. Keep up the good work. And yes, I’m still waiting for a bretty Hop Stoopid."

"This stuff is great beer. Pours a dark straw with only a finger of thick, sticky, bright white head despite being poured straight down the center of a pint glass. Tons of cling as the head settles, really good lacing. All this is nice, but the smell and flavor are truly spot on. Extremely well balanced between malt and citrus hop flavor. This beer is like Bell's Hopslam's older, smoother, more sophisticated brother. Exceptional beer."

"O: A clean, very hoppy wheat ale suitable for hop heads. I didn't think this was a great APA or IPA -- not up with better Lagunitas offerings for one thing -- but as an Amer. Pale Wheat, it is exceptional."

"This is a very tasty, easy drinking beer. Best served fresh in a glass to enjoy the aroma."
"Poured into mug. Fairly murky orange/yellow body with smaller head than expected. Smell is pretty intense, lots of sweet citrus and spice. Flavor is very much like an ipa with a different mouthfeel. Not so crispy, more watery. This is basically a pale ale bordering ipa with some wheat. It really is hoppy and well rounded but just doesn't have the wow factor that a fuller mouthful would give it"
""
""
""
""
"All around big-assed wheat beer. Tropical fruits, citrus, and crushed aspirin get out ahead of things before eventually being reeled in by a big wheaty body. As it warms the grainy cereal notes come out even more and the absurd creaminess increases. This is just a damn good craft beer. I could see drinking it all day in the summer, except that the ABV would knock me on my ass before supper."
"Overall - The flavor reminds me heavily that of an APA or an IPA more so than a wheat ale. Still, I found this to be a very enjoyable beer that any craft beer fan should check out!"
""
"O-A very well balanced wheat beer with nice fruit focus but not overally sweet or bitter."
""
""
""
""
"Light/medium bodied with a bit a carbonation makes this ale very easy to drink. Overall I can say hope Lagunitas keeps this pale wheat crossed with a IPA around for a long time."
""
""
""
""
"Color is light amber to a dark shade of gold, and cloudy. Lots of lacing, but the moderate head fades fairly quickly. The smell is much like an APA or IPA - nice citrus notes. The wheat character of this beer comes through more in the taste, but the wheat definitely takes a back seat to the hops. There is just a touch of clove and lemon behind the surge of grapefruit. For my tastes, this beer strikes the perfect balance between a pale ale and a wheat."
""

""

"Pours a nice yellow, honey orange and gold color with a slight hazy appearance. Has a huge honey comb colored head that leaves sticky lacy down the glass. The aroma is huge pineapple, orange peel and some sweet grapefruit. there is a nice hint of sweetness on the front of the nose and the malt creeps through to balance out the aromas but this is definitely hop forward on the aroma. The taste is very much like the aroma. It has a huge kick of sweet pineapple and orange peel. I get a little bit of a bitter grapefruit rather than sweet on the taste, but it works great with the other hop flavors. There is a malt presence that balances this enough to keep it from being a total hop bomb. Smooth arrival to the hops and dry finish. The mouthfeel is spot on for an IPA. Really has a big kick of carbonation that cleanses the palate while opening it up to all the huge flavors this beer has to offer. Not over sticky or sweet at all for such a high hop profile. Overall this is a great beer and very accessible. I wish it were year round. Definitely worth seeking out and trying."
"aquired in a trade with schufj. bottle poured into a snifter. glowing golden hue capped by a 1/2"" white head with fair retention. nose is complex and inviting with caramel backed by pine and citrus. Bitterness is cutting but quickly washed away with cracker and caramel sweetness. Slick, but medium bodied. Yum!"

"O- Extremely drinkable and certainly one of the best offerings I've sampled from Lagunitas. I'm usually not super crazy about wheat beers, but I will definitely buy this one again. Very enjoyable and definitely makes me want to try more highly regarded APWAs."

"Shared a growler of this with the lady over homemade mac and cheese and fish stick. It was a wonderful combination. It was a great hazy mustard color with a foamy head that left some solid lacing. It smelled of pine, hops, citrus, and a hint of wheat. The wheat came thru more in the taste. It kind of reminds me of Bell's Two Hearted Ale. Solid, I hope it continues to be readily available. Good West Coast IPA."
"A very drinkable beer. Fits the style pretty well. The only issue I had was that I fell the carbonation level should have been higher. Also probably a better summer brew. Flavor profiles were spot on."

"Overall an enjoyable beer. Would buy again if I had the chance."
"Overall: It is hard to drink just one of these. The flavors are so incredibly balanced and it's such a beautiful looking beer that I want more. One of the cashiers at the store said she bought a case of 4 six packs and finished it off in under a week. I was skeptical at first, but I'm now determined to one-up her."
""
"Very interesting, BA lists it as a wheat ale, based off my tasting I would've assumed it was a very floral IPA. I'm not sure I was detecting any of the wheat other than in a certain light brightness in the beer. All around a good beer, but not super exciting. Hides its alcohol well."
"O: I am a believer!!! Interesting/tasty beer in every word, and the best Lagunitas brew I've had so far. I can't say I have any gripes with this beer. The dominate grapefruit you see in many ipas is upfront, but doesn't linger after finish. I guess the only sense of a wheat beer is the finish, but it's settle. Besides that, I would classify this as an ipa. Good beer worthy of my shelf, go pick up a six pack."

"Served at a good temperature and poured with a mid-sized off white head that lasted a while and lots of lace. Color is a very slightly hazy amber. Aroma is hop, caramel, bread dough, fruit.

Great wheat IPA."

"Out of a bottle that I drank with my brother-in-law over Thanksgiving this beer was a slightly hazy golden color with some amber tint. The one finger of head retained itself nicely and left bands of thin lacing. The aroma was of lots of citrusy hops, pale malt and some wheat underneath. The flavors were similar showcasing the orange, grapefruit and lemon notes of the hops with hints of pine and pale malt lingering on the finish. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium and the carbonation appropriate. A very tasty beer and a premier example of an American Pale Wheat Ale."

"ever having tasted a beer from Lagunitas. This will be a staple on my shelf!"
"O: A sneakily easy to drink pale wheat that would go great for summertime drinking, but also goes well any time of the year because of the higher abv"
"Overall: Loved it! Definitely will drink this again during the spring/summer months."
"This review might just be based off the bottle I poured, but ""Little Sumpin' sumpin' has a very small to no head, low lacing;pale orange in color, smells delicious and great taste. Looking for a mild beer with a little kick and nice fruity notes this is the one. Maybe I'll take a trip to the brewery and have it poured. nonetheless I enjoy this beer time, after time."
"T - Very sweet citrus flavor with strong, bitter hop notes at the end. The taste is quite bitter (almost a little too bitter for me) at the end but still e"
"O: Yeah, it's good, reminiscent of Gumballhead but more refined and integrated. This is its own thing; find it and love it."
"O- A very tasty offering. This would be great on a hot summer day."
"An overall delicious ale that nestles comfortably in the American IPA style, and doing so in a confident but non-boastful manner. The kiss of wheat offers a welcomed bready finish and slightly elevated creaminess in body that I didn't see comming. A great variation to a style where you thought you'd seen it all."
"O: This was delicious! How is it so widely available? Never expected it to be this tasty. Going to have to pick up another 6er."
"Nice beer. I enjoy most of Lagunitas' beers."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Little Sumpin' is a slightly hazy, deep golden color with a big, white soapy head that leaves thick gobs of lacing. The smell is mostly of citrusy/piney hops with subtle hints of wheat in the background. The flavor is similar to the nose, with the citrusy hops taking center stage. Very nicely hopped but not mouth puckeringly bitter, this beer has great flavor. The mouthfeel is rather full with a thick carbonation that adds to the viscousness. Overall a very good beer, worth having again."
"O - this beer is absolutely perfect for my taste, the hops and malts are balanced perfectly and leave the most delicious aftertaste. The only thing that is keeping this score excellent across the board is that I dont agree that this is an american pale wheat ale style, it is a straight up IPA, and it would be a perfect one."
"Maybe not as in your face as the Lagunitas IPA or left hook in your face with the Hop Stoopid, but definitely a step up from what I would consider a Pale Wheat."
"Overall, a very hoppy, well balanced, and smooth ale."
"All in all, a stunningly enjoyable beer. Definitely one I’ll try to find again."
"Overall - I love this beer. It really straddles the line between wheat beer and IPA, with an IPA leaning aroma and a wheat beer finish, but the taste straddles the line perfectly, creating a great balance between a wheat beer and an American stlyle IPA"
"American pale wheat ale? Ha! Putting this beer in the class that is generally bland and insipid is an outrage. We need a new category (because there are, of course, never enough pigenholes). I suggest ""double imperial American pale wheat ale"" (DIAPWA). Drinks quite large, with an aggressive hopping that takes hold right from the start and dominates center stage throughout. I did not particulary get the wheat addition, other than perhaps a bit of sharpness in the malt profile. Malt took on a sweet aspect toward the finish calling to mind a DIPA. Nicely done."
"O: Interesting interpretation from Lagunitas. You do get more of a hoppy IPA flavor but it does show you it's Wheat backbone throughout. Very much enjoyed."
"Just another quality release from the gang at Lagunitas. Easily one of the top beers of this style to say the least!"
"Overall: This is an excellent beer. Very drinkable and flavorful. Nice job of capturing the fruit notes and hops together without one overshadowing the other."
"My pour created three fingers of dense eggnog colored head with good retention. Color was an oh-so-slightly hazy golden yellow. Nose smelled like pineapples and freshly mown grass. Mouthfeel was medium and the pineapple taste was right out of a roll of Tropical Fruit Life Savers. How did they accomplish this one? Man, this was so mellow and coupled with the ABV, I was feeling good about myself. The finish was semi-sweet and very pleasant. That may do it for me this evening."
"Overall – not a bad brew, and not bad tasting at all. Tasting it in the fall now, but it was probably aimed at being a summer beer, which makes a lot of sense."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy straw color with a finger of thick white head that retains and laces well. The aroma starts with spicy, herbal and piney hops, with a hint of caramel. The taste starts with notes of wheat and bready malt and finishes clean with spicy herbal hops. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated with no lingering harsh flavors. Overall a great beer."
"Pours a cloudy murky bright pale orange color. Lovely color and a nice 2 finger head is present. Big hopped up grapefruit aroma. Also some tropical fruit, maybe pineapple on the aroma. The aroma is very inviting and is dominated by the hops. Low smooth bitterness with a sweet hoppy finish. Loads of flavor, very tropical, citrusy, and overall just fruity. Finishes with a pleasant crisp sweetness. Solid mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. I love this beer, it has a little of everything. Its hoppy with fantastic flavor and aroma, but an overall low bitterness for such hop flavor. It drinks very well and I could always grab another after the first."
"Pale ale color, very clear for having wheat. White head with so-so head retention. I would have presumed the wheat content would stabilized the head, but it's most likely the 7.5% A.B.V. knocking it back. Smells like maybe Centennial and Citra hops, with a fairly neutral yeast. Both in the smell and taste, you couldn't ask for much more as an example of American hops. Intense citrus almost pineapple flavors and aromas. Sweetness and bitterness are very suiting. Body is on the thinner side which also surprises me because of the wheat. I assume this is made with a sugar adjunct, but it is very cleanly fermented. Thus the thin body and respectable ABV. Very tasty sixer. Everything about the beer accentuates hops. Would gladly have again."
"Straw yellow clear body (once the friggin frost on the glass disappeared) multiple streams of medium size bubbles under finger and a half frozen frothy white head, medium dissipation with not much lacing. Citrusy nose, lemony, clean wheat body with good dose of apparently citrus hops on back end. Taste is once again citrusy, almost like someone put the proverbial lemon wedge in here, a bit of piney resin for balance. Mouthfeel close to medium, a bit heavy for the style, fairly dry, astringent finish. Not exactly my cup of tea, a bit heavy on the lemon esters and tres hoppy for the style, but ABV relatively well hidden, though this is my no means a session beer."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This one exceeded my expectations. Very tropical and fruity. I wish that I knew how old this bottle was, but there's nothing but a code (24210308) on the neck of the bottle, and I''m not sure what it means."
"T: I don't know what it is about Lagunitas beers, but not one of them has really impressed me so far. Maybe at this point, it's becoming a mental thing. This one just didn't do it for me, though. It had a strong pine hop flavor and some floral hops thrown in as well. A dash of bready malts and then a ton of hop resin that gave it a really harsh bitterness. The balance felt way off and I probably wouldn't want to try this one again."
"Overall - I am constantly impressed by Lagunitas, and Little Sumpin is such a great IPA. So complex and so well balanced. Hops are mostly citrus and pine, multi-layered, and the sweetness comes from ripe citrus and some candied pine. Highly recommend."
"Overall this is beer is amazing. I really enjoy every aspect of it and I was fortunate somebody made the switch in the 6 pack."
"Overall, I would not call this your standard wheat ale. This beer can be a bit pricey compared to other wheat ales but it is worth the money. Especially if you are looking for something on the higher end of quality. I could easily sit and drink these all night. Fantastic beer."
"Almost a Wheaty IPA.. I dont know how to explain this.. Its got malty body of a red.. hop bitterness of an ipa and wheaty grainy body indicative of the usual wheat beers im not to fond of.. But the body and hops make this an enjoyable session."
"This beer kicks ass. Great aroma, great flavor, smooth, easy drinking (especially for a beer of 7.5% alcohol!), it's so good in so many regards. One of my favorite Lagunitas beers."
"Overall a good IPA hybrid, if I found it on tap I would not turn it down."
"This is a dangerously balanced and refreshing beer. I could easily sit down and have 3 or 4 with dinner or a game."
"A Lil Sumpin’ Sumpin’ Ale is not quite what I expected. It lacks something near the finish as far as the body goes. However, the balance is good, and it’s light enough to enjoy a few of them, maybe hanging out outside with some friends. It doesn’t quite match up to their 13th Anniversary alt. which I would prefer in the same fashion over this one, and one in which I tried very recently. That being said, I would pick this up again."
"Overall, the initial sweetness is nicely balanced by the big hop bite in this beer. The sweetness and hops surround a grassy wheat malt middle. This is a go to beer for me."
"$1.80 a single."
"O: better than average Wheat ale, nice hoppyness, but the fruityness ruined it for me. I would drink again if offered, but I wouldn't go buy it."
"O - Somewhere between a hoppy wheat beer and a malty IPA. An interesting beer by Lagunitas that is hard to place in a specific category but it works."
"Cheers!"
"O: Extremely drinkable and enjoyable beer. Would definitely have more sumpin' sumpin'."
"Poured in a pint glass. Golden ""Clear""(Lil haze) considering it is a 7.5er. Wonderful smell of some type of sweet preserves I usually have a some fancy restaurant. The smooth sweet wheat taste is overpowered with hops. Delicious...The ""wheat ipa"" is proving some worth. This is one to try if you like hops!! IPA fans will like this as an alternative to their usual brew. Wheat beer fans, drink your smooth wheats and stand clear too much hops for u! Me, a good drinkin' brew!"
"Very pleasant beer; plenty of grounding but very drinkable as well."
"It's been a while since I've had a beer from Lagunitas this drinkable. I'd consider several of these if it were on tap at my local."
"Pretty bitter and hoppy for a wheat beer, but delicious and drinkable."
"This is one of my favorite beers and it proves that you don't need to throw a bunch of money away to drink some of the finest beer in the land."
"O: Maybe first wheat pale ale I have had but then again I'll have to reexamine."
"Lagunitas A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale is a clear, pale golden ale with a thin, dense white head that leave very nice lacing on the glass. The bold, hoppy aroma has notes of lemon, spruce, wintergreen... maybe berries and apple. It smells great! It has a full, fluffy mouthfeel that lightens up a lot at the finish and leaves the mouth very dry. It tastes quite a bit like the aroma, but decidedly more piny. The hops are the focus here and it's pretty bitter. The malt is resiny and peppery. A pine resin bitterness lingers for a while after the taste. It's a bold and tasty beer. This is what I expect from Lagunitas."
"O: This is the first Pale Wheat Ale I've had that I feel could stand toe-to-toe with FFF Gumballhead. It has some nice flavor profiles (especially from the wheats), but, admittedly, it’s a bit less flavorful. Still, if hoppy-yet-mellow enjoyment was what Lagunitas was aiming for, they nailed it. And if not, screw it – it's tasty!"
"Overall: I had to drive out of state to get this, but that's just because TN has lame beer/liquor laws. I was very pleased with the outcome, and this could easily be a session brew for me. As for the style..it doesn't strike me as what's its labeled. More of an IPA to me, however I'm not hating."
"Overall on interesting beer and one that you just gotta try for yourself. Thanks Lagunitas for Sumpin a little different."
"This is a pale wheat? Ha! More like a wheat IPA. Thanks again Lagunitas, for making a beer that doesn't quite fit into a specific style."
"O- This beer was a let down in terms of big anticipation with much less pay-off. The bouquet was very promising, but none of the flavors that were suggested in the aroma played out on the palate. The flavor disappeared quickly after swallowing."
"O- It really is more of an IPA with some wheat ale notes than the other way around. Still a tasty beer though. Very easily drinkable for a 7.5% beer."
"Golden color with a touch of amber, slight chill haze. Modest head and carbonation. Deeply fruity and bitter. I don't taste any of the usual wheat flavors, but it is rather sharp and acidic. More of a Belgian character. I would have called it a Tripel, but it is considerably more bitter than any I've had. Interesting and well-made beer that is worth a try. Quite fragrant and spicy in the nose. I like the ""Wild"" version a little more with its bolder Belgian weirdness. From a 12 oz bottle."
"M: The mouthfeel is well balanced. The aggressive bitter nature of the beer is kept wet and from drying giving off a refreshing feeling. Great mouth coating."
"O: If you want a hoppy pale ale w/ some wheat flavor, this one might be for you. It had too much hops and not enough wheat for its style in my opinion. That being said, an enjoyable beer."
"Overall, this beer is an excellent sipping beer for those of us who like something a little more on the bitter side."
"An interesting beer to be sure. The aroma is great too but the flavour is herbal and strange. I just don't quite get it."
"O: Can't say much good about this beer except that it's strong."
"Poured slightly cloudy golden into a S.A. draft glass. Immediate smell of yeast and a citrus hoppy hint. Upon first taste, it had a pleasant sweetness to it, like plum with plenty of hops hangin' around. A very nice easy drinkin' mouthfeel and a decent head. A little yeasty aftertaste, but its supreme flavor leaves you yearning for more. This was an awesome suprise to my mix 6 pack I picked up at Andersons Market in Toledo. I would definitely recommend this to friends and buy again. Great taste reigns supreme, a nice little kick at 7.5% ABV."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was both how sweet it was and was not. By this we mean that both the aromas and flavors were fruity and sweet, but at no point were either of them overwhelming. This was in part due to the big hop and alcohol characters. In the end this is a superb beer, with an unmatched aroma, correspondingly remarkable flavor, and a glorious feel, making this something that we could drink all day long."
"O/D: Finally got to try this, and a leader for ""APWAs."""
"O: Addicting beer, I couldn't keep myself from drinking it. 7.5% abv sneaks up on you and since I enjoyed it so fast, I felt a little goofy afterwards."
"O: Little Sumpin' Sumpin' is one of the better beers from Lagunitas. It's also one of the best in-style. A well done and easy drinking offering, I certainly recommend putting one (or more) back."
"Overall this is still very impressive even with the high abv which is noticeable. The nose and aftertaste though is incredibly impressive, but for a wheat ale it lacks the grain density. Still a solid brew. Hard to score this one."
"Overall - Another good beer from Lagunitas. Mostly just tastes like an IPA but a good beer overall."
"Easygoing mouthfeel, it's light bodied and refreshing with a dry finish."
"O: really love this brew, such a unique and great taste, really a great brew"
"This is a bigger ale that deceptively acts light and refreshing while bitch slapping you with american citrus-hop goodness. I could see people accidentally having too many of these."
"Great beer. Not sessionable!"
"Excellent. Could drink myself to death with this beer."
"A nice golden copper pour with a nice white head. Aroma of floral citrusy hops, with some nice fruity esters and malt. Taste is spicy fruity hoppiness, some light lemon with some sweet malt. Has a light to medium body with very nice carbonation, and a nice crisp mouth feel. Finish has a nice citrusy floral hops, with some fruity spicy character and some maltiness for balance, ending with a nice hoppy bite. Overall a surprisingly good crisp summer IPA."
"The taste was much more complex. Up front I noticed the citrus selection of hops with all the fruity flavors. Than in the middle a more bitter hop is present. At the finish I feel malt, and a presence of honey. Good carbonation gives the beer a great feel throughout. I really like this beer and will definitely recommend this ."
"O: A good ale that is somewhat sweet and malty. Very freshing and citrusy, this beer is an easy drinker."
"This is brutal stuff. The Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale is in the same style category as Sam Adams Summer Ale, but o what a difference. This is a beer for hop lovers. I give it good marks because it's actually well-crafted, and beneath the hop sting there is a fine aroma, and sweetness with a little bit of citrus in it (again, from those hops). One or two of these is plenty."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a tulip glass, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is citrusy hops (grapefruit, tropical fruit, lemon peel), floral hops and a bit of sweet malt. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some honey flavors, pine hops and wheat. I don't think this beer is made with honey, but it seems to me that there's a honey-like sweetness noticable. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy and smooth and has good carbonation. It's very easy and enjoyable to drink, too. I think this is a pretty good brew, it's definitely worth a try!"
"Overall- An excellent beer I could see myself drinking over and over, in a variety of situations, as it is way more than an IPA but far more complex and rewarding than many others out there. Highly recommended, and at its price, it can't be beat."
"O- incredibly refreshing with a really nice hop character."
"Overall, this is a great beer, and though the 64.20 IBUs make this more reminiscent of a strong IPA than an ale, when the ingredients are listed as ""Hops, Malt, Hops, Hops, Yeast, Hops, Water, and Hops," this is probably to be expected."
"Cheers..."
"Big grapefruit and citrus flavors come out of the hops. The flavor is intense and bold, hitting all of the tastebuds and then rescinding quickly so that you can't wait for the next sip. There's a balance from the malts that takes the edge off the sharply bitter hops just enough so that they can be enjoyed to their fullest extent without making you pucker. Not much of a boozy taste, so the 7.5% ABV has the potential to sneak up on you. The mouthfeel helps along the carrying of the hop message with its moderately high carbonation and ultra-crisp, dry finish, perfect for the style. This is one of those beers that is a pleasure to enjoy just for the sake of relaxation after a hot summer day or for analyzing and dissecting the flavors. One of my favorites from Lagunitas."
"Cheers!"
"This is delicious ale and a surprise from Lagunitas which mostly has not overly impressed me with their offerings, but with this they have hit a home run. Very, very drinkable even though the ABV is 7.5%, the ABV is never noticeable. A unique taste, different from any other ale I can think of at this time. Definitely worth buying by the case, even though it is a little pricey in my area at around $48. Note: Even my “Light Beer” buddies liked this one!"
"Pours a light straw yellow with a decent white head with good retention, seems to be pretty well filtered. Smells of citrus and floral hops, a nice sweet smell and some bread malts. Feel very tingly, good carbonation, medium and silky. Taste is pretty good, you get loads of sweet malts up front, a little herbal notes, perhaps a little sweet banana tasting yeast esters(?) and on the end you get plenty of floral hoppy goodness and grapefruit. Overall a pretty tasty beer, the high ABV is very well masked."
"O: A delicious beer. I can't wait to get my hands on some more."
"Great beer. Not intensely bitter yet full of hop flavor and satisfying wheat malt."
"O- I'm not gonna say this is a sessionable brew because of the abv, but it certainly drinks like one. Delicious, refreshing and fantastic! $12/6-pack is probably a bit much, but I've never had it and really wanted to try it. Well done once again Lagunitas!"
"O- damn good wheat beer. I love the hoppiness that comes to the table in this one"
"This beer is golden colored and clear. Nice head at first that fades to nothing but a white ring. Aroma is filled with orange candy, pineapple, floral hops, lightly toasted bread, and various other delightful happy aromas. I am enjoying every fragrant sniff. Taste is full of hoppy goodness, both bitter and flavor, more yummy bread malt, and fresh grains. Mouthfeel has a nice grainy/resiny texture to it, and underneath that its smooth. Good level of carbonation and medium to light body. Very drinkable indeed. Overall I am a fan of this beer."
"Pours a slightly hazy gold color with high carbonation and nice frothy white head. Smells of citrus and piney hops. I get mango, pineapple, and sticky sweet hop nectar. Smells like a tropical fruit salad. A sweet, light to medium beer with a rush of piney hop taste that gives to some orange & citrus hop zest. Quite bitter - can almost feel the hop resins coat my teeth. A very nice summer beer loaded on hops. The ABV does kick in after a number of these daddys. Will be looking for this one again to quench my longing for hop flavor and summer thirst. Well done."
"Poured into a 22 oz pint-style glass (more room for a hard pour). As it poured, it looked very yellow, but once in the glass, it settled into a solid golden color with a good head with excellent retention and lacing. First sniff yielded floral hop aromas and...for some reason (on the first sniff)..peach. Yeah, I know it sounds odd, but that's what I smelled, and I DID like it. It drifted into the fruity/floral hops scent after that. Taste reflected the label with hops in the ingredients listing hops several times. Hoppy with a clean crisp finish. All in all, a pretty damn good beer that I would get again. I wouldn't mind giving it a taste on tap..."
"I love it! Awesome beer. The bitterness of many IPA's with a nice, sweet fruitiness underneath that provides excellent balance. A great ale."
"Overall- not only is this my favorite Lagunitas beer, it is one of my favorite beers of all time of all styles. Ridiculously refreshing on a sultry South Florida day. You must try this beer. An interesting style but ipa lovers will adore this beer. Top notch."
"Poured a bright golden color, slightly hazy. The head was medium, and I had noce lacing down the glass. The smell to me wass IPA-ish, with a pronounced grapefruit and grassy aroma. Mmm, I didn't expect this, but am now excited to have bought this. The taste was also more like an IPA to me than a wheat beer. The grapefruit type taste hit me first, maybe a litte wheat in the background, but just sweep hop and fruity taste all the way through. Mouthfeel was awesome. What a great beer. I can't believe it took me this long to try one. I'll be back!"
"12 oz bottle into a snifter...pours a bright pale golden body with a fizzy generous head. Smell has a citrus hop profile with some sharpness. Taste is incredible, with a ton of lemon and orange hop notes with a crisp wheat backbone...kind of reminds me of Gumballhead, but less wheat and fruitier hops. This beer is really really good. Mouthfeel is awesome. Try this one, you won't be sorry."
"Lightly carbonated, sour puckering gives a wetness to the palate, and kind of coats the warmness from the alcohol."
"O: Definitely a very tasty/VERY drinkable beer. Love the malts calming the bitterness down as much as it does. Although I do love the assault of hops every now and then."
"Gave this a second try as of 07/14. This is either a very good IPA or a failure of a wheat ale. Like somebody got a little too clever for their own good. ""Hey, lets just keep adding hops!"""
"Pretty much an IPA, honestly. If they knocked it down to 5% or so, I think it would be even better and more refreshing. Oh well. Fruity, candied, stickiness...can't complain..."
"The aroma is the best part of it. When poured into a glass, there is a fantastic citrusy aroma of it. It goes down smooth. I have never been disappointed with a Lagunitas... and this one is one of my favorites from them."
"O: I'm impressed. I've had very few offerings from lagunitas but this is a great beer. I'm usually underwhelmed by wheat beers, but this is a pleasant surprise. Well balanced, great for a summer beer. Or fall beer. Or spring beer. Hell, even winter. Fairly simple and straightforward, but just all around good."
"One of the best beer bargains out there. For $10 worth of summer drinking, you can't do much better for a six pack. Cheers!"
"I really dug this beer and didn't realize it was a wheat until after I had drunk it. There's not much wheat flavor and it's closer to an cali-APA in style. Wow it's good. Slightly opaque, light gold color. Floral hops in the nose continue in the mouth, with balanced flavors and restrained bitterness. Tremendously drinkable. A delicious beer that I can't wait to drink again."
"Overall this is a beer that I think everyone should try. Do it. I will try it again and again.. .."
"A little syrupy, but overall crisp and dry finish. Easy to drink and nicely balanced beer."
"Flavor had a light touch of bready, crackery malt, and was a touch dry and crisp. Lots of citrus was present, with rindy, pithy characteristics aplenty. Pineapple and grapefruit came into play in this solid offering. The hoppiness in the finish was long-lasting and pleasant. Reminded me a bit of Schneider-Brooklyner Hefeweizen. Good stuff!!"
"O: Solid stuff from Lagunitas."
"Little Sumpin' Sumpin' pours out a golden amber with a thin half inch head. Scent is apricot, wheat, mango, pineapple, orange and grapefruit. Taste is predominately apricot and wheat with some lemon dropping in on the finish and lingering around. Mouthfeel is velvety-smooth. Outasight! Overall, a very smooth and drinkable pale wheat ale despite the ABV. One of my go-to six pack purchases along with Racer 5."
"On tap at Beer Run in Charlottesville, VA. I had no idea this was a wheat until I read about it. I would consider this an almost ideal American Pale Ale. Nice appearance in the glass, slight haze, plenty of head and lace on the glass. Bursting with American hop aroma, excellent malt/hop flavor balance, smooth and silky mouthfeel. A great beer that may win over those who shy away from ""hoppy"" beers. I was so impressed by the quality of this beer that I had another despite the large selection on tap at Beer Run. One of the best."
"This is a go to beer for me and I'm glad have a minute to review it. First time I had it was at brewtopia in nyc and was blown away had no idea it was an APA thought it was a lights IPA. Now that I've been drinking it regularly it is my go too chillin in the pool summer beer. Ok enough blah blah blah. Pours like a golden lagerish color with a fluffy white dissipating head, lacing the glass lightly. Smell is slightly citrusy sour, some pine and overall inviting. The taste allows for the hops to blow you away if your expecting a wheat bear or have you grinning a bit if your expecting an IPA. I can taste the bittering grapefruit and some unripe apricots as well as sweet peppers and believe it or not a little wheat beer on the burp. The mouthfeel is light as hell and very drinkable as a session beer despite the high abv. Overall freakin great another thumbs up to lagunitas."
"Will gladly pick up more than one next timne after this worthwhile trial"
"Keep in mind, I'm an IPA/Double IPA fan and this one hits the spot for me. If you're all about the wheat, this may not be exactly what your reaching for."
"O - a fine drinking beer for anytime of year."
"O= decent, but I'm surprised I'm not as impressed as others here seem to be. I totally love the Sumpin' Extra IPA but then again this is a wheat beer. This one just doesn't come together as nicely for me."
"Overall I didn't care for this beer. It wasn't anything like the other Pale Wheats I've had before. This one was too hoppy for me. I was expecting a more balanced flavor of hops and wheat but I couldn't taste the wheatiness that I loved in other Pale Wheats. Just the hops and bitterness."
"Overall - Very impressive drink. Its a little strong for a wheat ale but really this isnt anything like traditonal wheat ales. 7.5% and hoppy, this could pass for a ipa. Very tasty and hoppy!"
"Overall a very satisfying wheat beer. Hardly surprising--I learned to expect great things from Lagunitas a long time ago."
"O: A very interesting and extremely tasty wheat beer. A great amount of tasty hops balanced with the wheat malt."
"In all, this is yet another great offering from lagunitas which combines the best attributes of a smooth, refreshing wheat beer and the excellent taste of an IPA. No wonder this is quickly becoming my new go-to summer beer."
"Drink- I like this one a lot. Its similar to an IPA but just smaller and tastier. Id like this one again. Was quite balanced and tasty"
"O: Wow – Hoppy wheat – I’m a fan. Great beer – very drinkable and went down way to easy."
"Poured into a pint glass. Thick white two finger head. Straw colored and clear with ample carbonation and some lacing. Smells of orange and hops with a touch of wheat. The taste is of hops and orange with alcohol and bitterness being a noticable factor but not unpleasent. The Mouthfeel is light bodied. Overall a very solid beer, but just a tad hoppy for a wheat."
"This beer poured out as a nice looking golden color, the head is strong and fluffy looking. The lacing isn't bad either. The smell is hoppy, I actually thought this was an IPA not a Wheat Ale. The taste of the beer has a light wheat flavor but finished with a hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel on this beer is smooth and crisp, it's got a good bite to it. Overall I found this beer to be pretty good all around. Worth having again."
"O: Very, very impressive. I couldn't stop taking sips of this bad boy. Before I knew it, the glass was empty. Well done, Lagunitas. If you'd start putting descriptions on your beers, I would probably drink a lot more of you."
"O: One of my go to beers. I am not typically the biggest fan of wheat beers but this is fantastic when fresh."
"Overall- Lagunitas rarely disappoints me. This is no exception. This is one of the beers that is always in my fridge during summer. 4.5/5"
"A very good beer. I can't believe I waited so long to try this. It has plenty of big hoppy flavor, but it's all about flavor and not just about hops."
"Overall, another winner from the good people of Petaluma!"
"overall, this is my first (and definitely not last) go-round with sumpin sumpin and color me impressed. really digging this beer. would be perfect for a summer barbecue."
"mouthfeel - dried out my mouth, medium body"
"Lagunitas is impressing me more & more. Looking forward to sampling the rest of their offerings in due time."
"This one's incredibly drinkable. I could easily keep this one stocked in the fridge all year, or at least all summer."
"This definitely is one of the hoppier wheat beers I have tried, or it could just pass as an IPA brewed with some wheat. Either definition works. A very easy drinking beer, especially considering the ABV."
"O- I will get this beer again. great for the price. refreshing enough on hot days, yet malty enough to scratch an itch if you want something a little ""heavier"""
"This is a hop forward wheat ale. I kind of wished the balance was a bit better... the malt bill is a little weak in my opinion. Although I thought it was good and worthwhile, I've had better."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer has a bright orange-tan coloring to it, with no head whatsoever. Pours out with minimal carbonation bubbling, also. Aromas are hoppy, with a slight citrus and nutty sweet blend to it. Well balanced, but somewhat awkward for some reason. The flavors are light on the forward tongue, but burst onto the middle and rear tongue with light, crisp hops, a heavy dose of pepper spicing, citrus tart and sweet, and a slight toasty and breadlike character. The body remains light and crisp, true to the style, but slightly watery initially. The aftertaste is light on the spice, with a good amount of hops flavors and an even bigger amount of citrus sweetness and a slight hint of pineapple. The finish is crisp and clean, with the slightest dryness from the hops. Very tasty."
"Overall I am really enjoying this beer. Actually, I love it. It is like a blend of an IPA and wheat beer all in one. Another unique offering by this brewer and they have shown the knack for avoiding the run of the mill brews."
"It seems strange to call a 7.5 ABV, 64 IBU beer sessionable, maybe that's going to far. But I would say this is a lighter, softer, Summer friendly IPA that doesn't seem to sacrifice anything in the hop department to achieve its aformentioned qualities. Damn fine work by the guys at Lagunitas."
"I like this American pale wheat... In fact it is my first. It pours a hazy golden yellow. The head is thick and sticks around all the way to the last sip. The smell is that of an american pale ale. There is a just enough hops, but not that big bite... Very pleasant and very drinkable. This went down fairly quickly. I want more of these. I thought this was a very unique tasting beer. If you like apa's and wheat beers this is a great choice ."
"O: A fantastic and really interesting beer. Recommended for hopheads and lovers of grapefruit. This is my second in a week, and I think I'll go buy a few more."
"O: This is like an IPA with a bit of wheat and a nice clean finish with minimal bitterness. Very nice and easy to drink. Honestly I was pretty stunned as to how good this was, it was just a smidge below Gumballhead in my opinion. One of my new favorites."
"Overall - Another outstanding beer from Lagunitas"
"Again, Lagunitas leaves me wanting more. I recommend this to any hop lovers, or wheat beer lovers looking to branch out."
"This beer is one of those super hoppy American wheat ales that is a nice change of pace if you are into American Pale ales. Gumball Head is still my favorite of this style, but this one is quite tasty and widely available."
"Left-coast hops and wheat malt. Maybe not the first beer to feature this dynamic duo, but arguably one of the best examples of it. Slight wheat beer haze with a solid white head that retreats to a persistent ring. Lots of classic left-coast citrus hops in the nose, with some pine and grapefruit supporting the lemony main note. Bitterness is solid but in proportion for a beer of medium body. At half this strength it'd make a great lawnmower beer, but full strength it is, and that limits it to a few rounds. Unless hops ain't your thing, it's hard to find any fault with this brew."
"Overall. Nice. The hops go well with the wheat base."
"O: This is a good, solid IPA with a little bit of a twist...a Little Sumpin' Sumpin'. =) Not quite as radical as I thought it'd be, and it doesn't really stand above others in this segment enough to sell your first born to get it, but it's easy to see how LSSA could become someone's go-to brew."
"Love this beer fresh!!! Now that it's year round that will be a little harder to accomplish on the East Coast. I'll be sure to look for the bottling dates on future batches."
"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty decent beer. It has a good balance, blend of hops, and the malt bill is subtle but compliments the ensemble. That said, I am a malt-head, so this one finished just a bit bitter for my taste, but it was still pretty nice to the back of your throat. I will enjoy the rest of my six-pack no doubt, though I am not sure when the urge will strike me to buy this again just for pleasure."
"The mouthfeel ranks in at medium. No doubt from the generous use of wheat malt. A very well made beer. Overall, this beer is very much drinkable & is very high on my list. One that I am so very glad is not a limited release. Will be a staple in my rotation. Prosit!!"
"Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and oily slick, with light fizzy carbonation, a light to medium body and a bitter zesty finish. A high recommendation for a great beer that is extremely drinkable as I had 4 on tap last light. I look forward to drinking this again soon as it was excellent."
"O: good all around, balanced hop and malt."
"D: Very drinkable, nothing really sticks to the mouth at all and is really easy drinking."
"Overall: A really flavorful Wheat Pale Ale. Just the right amount of hops to balance the sweetness, and good flavors all around. Not too weak on the flavors like many Wheat Pale Ales, and a respectable ABV. Another winner from Lagunitas!"
"Overall: A good twist to the American IPA style, and the alcohol is very well hidden. A fantastic summer beer for hop lovers. Track this down."
"Poured into 13oz tulip glass. Pours a clear orange yellow. Nice 1 inch white sticky head. This beer is different then any beer out. Like a sweet IPA. Smell is mango, pappia, pineapple, grapefruit, and piney hops. Taste is all that, but stronger. A little alcohol in the finish. Medium body and very easy to drink. Just a wonderful and unique beer."
"Everyone want a Lil' Sumpin Sumpin!!!! Another solid creation by Lagunitas. The color is golden clear with not much carbonation; so the head is very very thin...a;lmost non-exsistent. The nose is accented by grapefruit/citrus and you can sense a full bodyness to it. The taste is very good with citrus hints and body. The mouthfeel is good, lil punchy with the higher abv."
"In general I'm a fan of what Lagunitas puts out BUT I'm sorry to report that this particular release has been hard to get down. This Lil Sumpin' has got sumpin' not quite right about it."
"O: Damn, just a great beer. Lagunitis - you are quickly moving up on my brewery list."
"Overall: Wheat IPA. Not too surprising coming from Lagunitas. Flavorful, complex and refreshing."
"Overall - I really enjoyed this beer and would be happy to drink it again anytime. It's very well balanced and the taste is delicious. It reminded me a little bit of the Aprihop beer by DogFish head. If I had to drink one type of beer for the rest of my life it would be along the lines of this one."
"The beer pours a beautiful gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has an excellent pale and wheat malt scent along with a wonderful hop aroma. It's basically an IPA brewed with wheat. The taste is great as well. It has a smooth pale and wheat malt flavor; easy drinking with a kick ass hop character. It's malty with an equally bold hop appeal. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a delicious beer. It's a bolder American wheat ale with loads of hop; my kind of beer."
"Food Pairing: Pork, Chicken, BBQ Items (Rubbed, Sauced, Smoked, Whatever. Pretty Perfect Grill Brew.), Ham, Medium Cheeses (Goat Cheese would go great with this), Tofu, Fried Foods. Anything really, Not a real beef kind of brew, but anything else that comes to mind would go good."
"DELICIOUS, SEEK IT OUT!"
"I definitely get more IPA than wheat, which is probably why I like it! Overall, it's different, certainly worth a try. Very drinkable, especially for its ABV."
"Overall: This might be the best ""wheat"" beer I've had. It drinks far more like an IPA, than any other wheat style beer that I've had. This is a fantastic beer and will certainly be in rotation this summer."
"Pours a clear golden color with a medium white head that disappears very quickly. Scent is very hoppy with some nice wheat aromas as well. I also get some earthiness and grassy aromas. Even hints of meat??? Taste is initially tropical and citrus fruit forward, then I get some floral flavors. The wheat is definitely in the flavor, along with some nice grassy and delicious hop flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and crisp to perfection. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is a great offering from Lagunitas, and just in time for the summer."
"pours a great golden yellow with a slight orangish tinge. a small amount of white head formed as well. the smell is hoppy freshness with a slight hint of wheat and light malt smell. the flavor is really well balanced with the wheat hitting first only to then finish with that fresh hop flavor. goes down smooth and is a really refreshing beer. A great summer drink that I will soon drink again!"
"Overall: Great Great brew. Tastes and feels like an IPA but as easy to drink as a Wittbier. One word: Stunning!"
"Pours a clear light orange, with a moderate head made up of small interlocking bubbles. Aroma is hoppy, with some big citrus notes (I'm picking up oranges) coming to the forefront. The wheat character is there, but it's subdued. If I was tasting this blind I probably would call it an IPA or Pale Ale based on the aroma. Taste is pretty stunning. I had several of these the other day and they went down smooth and easy. This beer is bursting at the seams with flavor, with huge fruity IPA notes hitting the palate first, chased by wonderful malt that's highlighted by the wheat. Not all that bitter, which is nice in a beer like this. The second sip showcases more of the hop profile, with big pine and grass notes this time. Malt flavor errs on the sweet side rather than the dry, which means that this one goes down quick and easy - and at 7.3% ABV that's something you may want to monitor. Carbonation is relatively high, but given the wheat character and malt sweetness, that's actually welcome. Tastes like an IPA but it's easy to drink like a Wheat Beer. Fantastic and unique."
"Serving type: Bought bottles as well. Its better on Tap, more aromatic as well."
"With a name like that how could I resist? It was pretty good. Crisp and refreshing as a wheat beer should be. Poured a pale golden with a nice white head. Floral hops in the nose with a touch of citrus zest. Similar qualities in the taste: floral, citrus, a touch of spice, and sweet malts in the background. Light-medium body, crisp and drinkable."
"Hazy brass colored pour with a slight head that leaves little to no lace. The brassy hued brew is only mildly carbonated. Great hopa nd malt balance. Really nice hop finish behind a sweet malt overtone. The piney hops don't overpower the malt sweetness but rather compliment the malt profiles. Very tastey and drinkable beer."
"Pours a nice copper color. Smells great, you get a nice peach aroma that goes along with pine. Some sugar in the aroma as well, and it has some malt. The taste starts off with that pine/citrus. It finishes with a chalk like texture, just slightly. Overall, I heard good things about this beer, but it just didn't do it for me. I thought the aroma was the best part of this beer. I wouldn't turn one down, it has it's good qualities, but I wouldn't buy anymore anytime soon."
"O - Pretty delicious brew with a great hop bite. Smooth and refreshing brew."
"I couldn't taste any alcohol to this beer even though it certainly is there. That's the strength of this brew, without a doubt. It went down so easily but never did it feel weak or watered down. I'm not sure how it was pulled off but this is a warm-weather beer that doesn't have the weakness that the ""lawnmower beers"" have and everyone should get a little something every now and then - even if it comes from a bottle such as this!"
"Overall, one of the better examples of the style. Reminds me slightly of Gumballhead, but not quite as tasty."
"A floral-hopped wheat beer. Very drinkable, but I have some issues, if you are a light weight, you can only have like 2 since these are over 7%. The flavor is very delicious, and the lightness of the wheat is amazing."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied but comes across with a crisp and slightly dry refreshing quality to it. Overall, A Little Sumpin Sumpin is not just a funny name designed to sell beer, it has the flavor to back it up. Hoppy wheats are a great treat."
"O-Great summer beer.Can't wait to crack one of these when the temperature rises."
"O: Fantastic beer. Just get some."
"Burnt straw color that forms a decent white head that disintegrates rather quickly. Nice lacing around the sides of the glass. Smells of earthy hops, wheat, and grass. Very refreshing taste. A little bitter upfront, but that is balanced out with a nice refreshing wheat finish. Good carbonation. Overall a great beer. I would consider this Gumballheads twin brother, not identical twin, but pretty close. Has all of the characteristics to make this a top tier beer, and putting this in the same class as Gumballhead is an outstanding compliment. Well done Lagunitas!"
"D: This beer is crisp and smooth, it drinks more like a session but also some some bite to it. A solid beer to have on a nice warm day."
"Pours a semi-clear light honey orange color with a small 1 inch off-white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Decent rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smells of sweet grains, honey, and citrus zest hops. Taste is of sweet honey, grapefruit juice, biscuit, and citrus zest. The honey flavor is really noticeable to me and it's very delicious. Very, very mild hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. Mouthfeel is good with a nice level of carbonation that makes form a crisp and clean feel. Overall, this is a good beer with a surprising honey taste. I am surprised to see that it is a wheat ale. I am not too sure if this one is past it's prime (I have been sitting on it for months) because the hops aren't too overwhelming but this is good either way."
"D-OVerall this was a really nice beer. Almost tasted like an IPA but the wheaty grainess made you remember it was a wheat beer. Id love to have this again. Nice beer"
"Overall, I love it. Another terrific beer from Lagunitas!"
"O - All in all, incredible beer. Great beer to default to on a regular basis."
"Loved it and look forward to another growler"
"Poured a light amber color from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Small amount of white head with mild retention of the lacing. Aroma is of flowers, hops, and citrus. The aroma carries over into the taste. Mild mouthfeel. This is a super tasty, refreshing brew. Love it."
"O: A decent beer here. The alcohol on this is well hid. It is a nice change from a hefe or IPA if you are looking for one."
"A nice offering, although, if inspired by Three Floyds' Gumballhead, it really doesn't match up. Gumballhead is so much more balanced and nuanced. This is bold and for the most part, well done, but appears hamhanded next to a brew like Gumballhead. But that's just my opinion."
"Once again Lagunitas leaves me impressed. I haven't had a ton of their beers, but every one that I have had has been stellar!!"
"Obviously I loved this beer. I'm really starting to become a believer in Lagunitas. Time after time, they impress the hell out of me. Will revisit this beer in about.... right now. Cheers!"
"Pours a hazy orangish gold with a good amount of white frothy head. Smells really wonderful. Light hops over sweet wheat. A nice light fruitiness on the nose. Tastes as OT s,ells. Sweet and hoppy. Especially for a pale wheat. Lots of great lighter fruit on he tongue with pine and grape fruit coming through on the hops. Very solid brew overall, definitely wish I had access to this"
"This is a wheat beer? Could have fooled me. Would've never guessed, outside its light and slightly cloudy color this wasn't an American Pale Ale. Grapefruit all over the place, eeeasy drinker, surprising for weighing in at the 7.5% ABV. My only wish is that the balance leaned more towards wheat than the pale ale side."
"O - Not as refreshing as a straight IPA, but a nice change of pace."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a slightly cloudy golden color with a small head. Smell is of citrus and hops. Taste is good, citrus, hops, a touch of wheat, not really what I expected from this style, but good nonetheless. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."
"Serving type: 12 oz. bottle"
"goddamn, goddamn, goddamn i love this beer. ive said it three times and ill say it again: i fucking love this beer and no less than wanton profanity will suffice. in as many ways as it's an ipa, it's something else entirely. thick, sticky and creamy on the tongue, tastes of copious, copious and sugary-sweet citric hops with a rich, sturdy undercurrent of everything from chocolate to grapefruit to an evergreen tree, and a euphoric alcohol warming sensation like mumma rubbin' vicks on yo' tummy. one of my favorites."
"I find myself all over the map on this one. I like it, but find it odd and taxing. I want more, but then feel I've had enough. Little sumpin' sumpin'? OK, I'll try a little mo'!"
"Notes: A lively, fruity hop profile makes this much better than your average American Pale Wheat Ale. A very tasty treat. A great transition beer as well; the inexperienced beer drinker can cut his or her teeth on it and use it as a stepping stone to some of the harder-hitting hoppy beers."
"The body on this seems a bit heavier than I would like on the style; even a little sticky. Not a bad beer, very enjoyable. Glad to see this in six packs relatively locally."
"From first taste lot of carbonation and a citric acid bite upfront. It has to be from the heavy amount of hops on top of the crisp clean wheat. A smooth caramel sweet body that finishes with a hard, but pleasant bite. The bite become less overwhelming as it goes. Light but complex beer that goes down smooth on the first day over 60f day in Mass."
"Overall this was a pretty tasty brew. This beer was heavy on the hops, almost could be called a Wheat IPA. The hops blended nicely with the wheat flavors but it didn't let much wheat come through. I was surprised how smooth this beer was for being 7.5%, it drank more like a nice pale ale, this would make a great summertime brew. I will for sure be buying this again and I recommend it to anyone that likes a good dose of hops in their beer."
"Another in the line of Wheat brews who have copied the success of Three Floyds Gumballhead with an extra hop base."
"O- I was impressed that brewers were able to capture strong complexity for such a bitter, hoppy brew. Overall I felt that the bitterness was way overpowering, leaving my mouth dried out. I could only handle 2 bottles before this characteristic became overwhelming."
"The beer is somewhere between a ""refreshing brew"" and a ""hoppy flavorful sipper"" for me, making it tough to find times when I'm in a mood for a beer of such characteristics."
"D/O - i wouldn't go as far and say this is the best of its style. but it is certainly up there. its so refreshing and clean to drink that you could totally sit around a fire and drink a few of these and be as happy as you possibly could be. the alcohol in this was greatly masked and allows you to keep drinking without it tasting like a shot in each sip. all in all.. wonderful."
"Another thanks to IlludiumQ36 for a great beer."
"This is a really unique beer, but an exceptional one at that. Great for spring and summer alike."
"This is a great brew, has the sweet hop fruitiness and isn't bitter and is balanced beautifully by the wheat maltiness. Can be sessioned by the case, stellar stuff. Perfect for a BBQ or a hot day.. hell anytime of year. This would be a nice alternate to a hefe or a striaght wheat brew for some. Great stuff."
"If you haven't had this beer yet, put it on your list. It is by far the best offering by Lagunitas and has had me coming back for more."
"M/O: Very well-carbonated, refreshing. Loving the hops selection used here. Surprised this isn't labeled an IPA. Definitely worth multiple purchases."
"Absolutely great spring/summer session."
"O - An exceptional beer, perfect for the spring/summer months. Hoppiness is there but not overwhelming, the citrus fruit flavor makes this one easy to drink, and makes me keep wanting another sip"
"Drinkability is good. Not the best example of the style but very tasty in its own right. Definitely an enjoyable beer."
"O An aboslutely delightful beer. Nice hop malt balance and very drinkable."
"I don't really know how to classify this beer except that it is a really enjoyable beer to drink. Upon opening there's a hint of citrus. Don't get fooled by the appearance of this beer because its bot a little bite to it as well as a great rounded ""hoppyness."""
"Overall, a very tasty and easy-drinking beer with better than average complexity for the style, but a sneakily high ABV considering how smooth it goes down. This is a perfect spring/summer beer if you want something a little stronger in a session beer."
"As I said before, this brew is delicious. The abv is a little higher than desired for an everyday drinker but thats the only flaw, minor at that. This has completely transformed my previous view of Lagunitas."
"O: Amazing beer. The tropical fruitiness gives this brew a nice juicy character. Good for hopheads, yet good for those who aren't. Check it out if you can"
"Cheers"
"It's always a delight to see the slutty Sumpin' girl back on the shelves. But she should be holding two pineapples in front of her boobs, because this beer tastes and smells (judge Smells?) like pineapples. Delicious, delicious pineapples. Golden liquid pineapples with a fish-belly white foamy top. Oh pineapples, thank you for your flavor profile in this beer. And the zippy fun finish is a nice reminder of the slutty girl on the label."
"Sampled froma bottle with no freshness date. Deep yellow in color with excellent clarity. Poured with a dense yellowish-white head that slowly reduced to a thick cap. Lot of wet sticky lacings on the glass. Citrus grapefruit and orange aromas with along with plenty of caramel sweetness and hint of toasty malt. Medium bodied with nice refreshing carbonation. Sweet malty and citrus grapefruit hop flavors are well balanced through the beginning and middle. The wheat flavor peeks through toward the end as this finishes slightly dry and very clean. Thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Wouldn't think twice about having it again. Lagunitas has yet to disappoint."
"O: very impressive brew.. goes to the top of my list in a heartbeat.."
"Overall this is a great beer not what I was expecting for pale wheat. Made me want another. This is my get a 6 pack beer many times."
"MF- Medium bodied beer that has flavors that really jump on the palate. A little dry in the finish that leaves slight chalky feeling."
"Overall: This is a really great beer. It has a wonderful aroma, ripe and crisp fruity flavors that have enough bitterness to rein in sweetness, and it is not too heavy. However, the ABV is a tad bit heavy and, though you could enjoy a few of these in a row, you might regret drinking too many. This beer is perfect for sunny spring days that still have a bit of chill or dampness in the air."
"Why: Achtung baby! because you have never had so many hop's in your hefeweizen, period!"
"The hops are showcased very well in this beer and the wheat complements it nicely. I really love the hop profile on this beer. It's like a bigger, more tropical gumballhead. I highly recommend giving this beer a try."
"Lagunitas always seems to come through for me."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Easily drinkable and quite hoppy. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Delicious fruit flavors chime in well with the bitterness."
"Final thought - Lagunitas does it again"
"This is a wonderful beer...very similar to my favorite of this style, FFF Gumballhead. Probably the most refreshing beer I can get...speaking of which...I am so glad this is offered on a regular basis and distributed in my area. This will always be in stock in my fridge!"
"D (shit I mean O)- This is a great beer. Considered a pale ale, but at 64 IBU and 7.5%, this drinks a little heavier IMO. I reviewed the last of my 6-pack (and not my first pack I've had) and thought I only had one left over to review, I have put down quite a few of these in one session. Great staple beer here, and though I try to be as subjective as possible, I will say that Litle Sumpin' Wild was a better overall beer than this by a little..."
"O: A very good beer; I enjoyed my glass wholly and will be picking this one up again. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a non-traditional IPA, even if it's not too far off-base from the style."
"A damn fine beer,very interesting. Pleasant and sweet,while still being consumable for more than one or two,it makes a good session brew and a break from the usual."
"Another selection from Lagunitas who never disappoints. Let's give it a whirl. Popping the top I get a nice waft of malt sweetness with a citrus, mostly grapefruit smell. Pours to a bright yellow-orange with a multi-sized bubble foamy head. Head leaves a nice lacing on receding. Taste is a great likeness of the smell. Taste starts with a dandelion like sweet bitterness up front, then transitions into a heavy malt backbone in the middle with a tangy finish and a finish similar to the initial taste. The aftertaste stays bittersweet and fades to a lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is spot on. Lagunitas continues to not disappoint."
"The palate opens with a blend of tropical fruit (pineapple in particular) and herbal/botanical hop flavors. Pine becomes more apparent in the mid-palate, and the slight soap character that I picked up on the nose is present on the tongue as well. While the beer isn't especially sweet or malty, it does have a medium-full body from the liberal use of wheat malt. The finish is smoothly bitter and very slightly tangy. This is one of the better beers in the Lagunitas catalog."
"Golden body,clear, with a nice white head on top, some light lacing on the glass. Smells very hoppy, big citrusy notes with some tropical fruit flavor as well. Tastes a bit more balanced than the aroma would indicate. A nice citrusy hop flavor mingles with a solid pale malt backbone. Medium bodied with a nice amount of carbonation. I wouldn't mind drinking this one again. It's a solid beer for sure. That being said I wouldn't go nuts trying to seek it out but the bang for your buck is high on this one."
"Had this on tap at Poor Phil's in Oak Park, IL. Golden color with foamy head with good lacing. The smell is floral hop, with citrus notes. You think from the smell that it is going to be a hop bitter blast (which I don't really care for), but I was surprised that it was very smooth and well balanced with sweet malt husk and yeast flavors. Very well crafted recipe. Extremely drinkable. Definitely not a hop-tea that totally covers up the rest of the ingredients. This one exemplifies what an American IPA can be."
"Very huge smell of juicy fruits maybe some berry smell in there too and then some sweetness.. what an excellent aroma. This is definitely what I expect from Lagunitas. It still has that juicy fruity hop taste with a spicy hop kick in the beginning and a good almost piney bitter finish at the end. You get a huge sweetness in the middle that blends real well with the tremendous hop flavor and then the wheat finishing in the back with the hop bitterness. The hop profile is very close to their other beers like their regular IPA, Maximus, and Hop Stoopid. ALthough they are all very similar I still like this beer just as much as them. Even though the hops shine the most in this beer that wheat malt really completes it and gives Lagunita's regular hopped up beers a good twist. Definitely recommend this beer its like a wheat IPA."
"D - I could probably drink this stuff from sunup to sundown. Lagunitas makes some damn fine products."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are good, just not sure if this is fresh or not. I'll have to pick some up again to be sure."
"Medium-bodied and carbonation. All in all, the American Pale Wheat Ale category is one style that I am not particularly fond of, but this is definitely drinkable. A little high on the ABV to be terribly sessionable, but definitely worth a try."
"Overall a good beer and a great take on the style. Drinkable and refreshing."
"A beer to keep around."
"Tried this beer for the first time tonight after seeing it at the beer store a few times. I really enjoyed it. Nice orange color with some good head on it. Good hop aroma and an even better taste. This is a really good ale with a good bitter finish. I'll definitely be looking for this beer again."
"Overall, another delicious brew from this nice WC brewery. I seem to like every thing they put in those funny stubby bottles! Keep sending them east!"
"D: The is a little strong on the floral notes but delicious nonetheless; good stuff."
"An interesting beer, I still prefer the Lagunitas IPA. It has a far superior hop flavor and a low enough abv to drink the heck out of them. THis one is good, but why so high in alcohol for a beer that is so light and that drinks so quickly?"
"Pours a nice golden yellow with 2 finger white head (prett agressive pour). On the smell I get a ton of pineapple. On the second pass I picked up a good amount of orange mango juice. Very interesting and complex smell. Taste is full of floral hops. Good mouthfeel and ok drinkability. I like this brew but too sweet to throw back more than one or two."
"Nonetheless, I hope this review helps somewhat. This is a great beer, and very affordable."
"M-Beautifuly cleard and crisp freshness with a lot of carbination make this a nice feeling beer along with its nearly perfect tatse for anyone whos loves hoppy beers. So much flavor and charictor packed in this beer, one of my top ten beers. At 7.5% a few of these is just plenty but i could drink nothing but these all night when i am in a hoppy mood. Truly awesome!"
"Mouthfeel is light with active carbonation. This is a well balanced, very drinkable double IPA. Certainly one to come back to again and again."
"D - So drinkable, so clean, so light. Nothing lingers, the flavors are vibrant and juicy, this is a joy to drink."
"The liquid was a pale, golden, amber color with a bubbly whit head that clung to the glass. I took a sniff and first could smell grapefruit, then pineapple and sugary sweet malt. When you take a sip there is an orangey citrus bite that soon gets dominated by a sweetness, there are some background flavors of grapefruit and pine. The beer is kind of thick, it has low carbonation and is warming from the alcohol. This is a well-rounded beer, I would drink it anytime."
"The little sumpin' this beer gives is a lot and it is only one of many great beers from Lagunitas."
"D-very drinkable. Wish I had anoher"
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a fairly pale straw to golden yellow. Little head that disappeared quickly. Smell here is great, hops right there in your face with pine and pineappley citrus. Taste has a nice bitter kick with a slightly sweeter finish with bread and wheat notes. Slight peppery bite as well. Has a slightly heavier body than I expected from based on its color and pour, but fits right in with the flavor profile. Nice and refreshing beer, leaves just enough hoppy bite to make you want another sip and goes down very smooth. By the end of the glass the alcohol comes out just a tad. First beer by Lagunitas and I definitely want to check out some more."
"With all the citrus this would be a fantastic thirst qeuncher in the heat of the summer. I would have never known this was an American Pale."
"Until today I had yet to be blown away by a Lagunitas beer. Everything has changed as of this moment. This beer is remarkable. I will be drinking this and maybe only this until next Fall."
"D - Very well balanced; not too hoppy/not too sweet. Easy to drink and would appeal to many different people. Def would have another."
"I will be honest here, did not even realize this beer was a wheat ale until I found it on here. Pleasantly surprised. Good beer!"
"I would happily have this as a staple in my fridge."
"This is a new beer to me that I really find very drinkable. May become a new favorite."
"Very sessionable beer! I will definitely pick some of this up in the spring and summer."
"This is a very, very easy drinker if you're into hop flavors. This would be a great beer to sip outside on a summer day. It's relatively light and a great showcase of mild hop flavors."
"D - good drinkability. would be great in the summer or with a meal. really impressed with this one."
"D-Very drinkable. A good beer to share with friends or keep all to yourself"
"A good solid wheat beer with a fantastic hop character about itself."
"Great one from Lagunitas. I'll be adding this to my ""keep in stock"" list for the fridge!"
"Pours a bright golden yellow color w/ a thin white head. Looking forward to this one after reading some very positive reviews. Smell is very crisp and citrus based, and the hops are there as well. Wow- this beer is an animal! A hop crazed, crisp, lemony animal that shocks my palate. Very smooth though, especially the finish and aftertaste. This beer makes me feel alive.... alive w/ hops! I also don't really taste the alcohol in this one. At 7.5%, it's not a huge ABV, but impressive that I don't detect anything. Very stealthy... The drinkability is great- I could put down several of these pretty easily and not think twice about it. I really like this beer, and will be buying it again for sure. Another fantastic effort by Lagunitas."
"Cheers!"
"D - At 7.5% abv. this beer is dangerously drinkable. The light color and crisp taste really throw me off. I feel as though I'm drinking a normal, lower %, pale ale until I look at the bottle."
"Drinkability: I could drink a few of these easily and be more intodxicated than I would want to be, due to the high ABV. It would be a good finisher for a hefeweizen tasting session."
"Very interesting beer. The mouthfeel during the finish is unlike any I've felt. Very nice array of flavors. A pretty good beer that's worth trying."
"For starters, I prefer this to A Little Sumpin' Wild. I'm not a huge fan of Belgium styles, and I thought this was more mild and drinkable. It Pours orange-yellow with big foamy head. The smell and taste is sweet and floral, with some sourness to follow. It has a nice medium body that is crisp. I prefer the orange-hoppy bite in this brew to the thick sweetness in the Wild. It has a wheatiness, almost making it a hybrid of sorts. I had a few of these."
"Overall: This is a great offering from Lagunitas. It is balanced and delicious and has a nice little kick to boot. A nice take on the style and must try in the summer. If other American Pale Wheat Ales are ""lawnmower beers"" then this is a ""tractor beer""! Good stuff!"
"O - This is one of my all time favorite beers. It has so much good stuff going on! A favorite for spring and summer."
"Overall, a bit too grassy and feel that the the dry hops missed their peak. I bet this beer would be much better on tap when very fresh."
"This one is super smooth and extremely easy to drink...dangerously easy to put down at 7%. Drinkability would be higher if the flavor could match the incredible nose on this thing. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side and the alcohol is not really detectable. A solid brew indeed."
"I went out on a whim buying this ale, I had never heard of it but am very impressed. Drinking from bottle is nice... it might be better from a glass though."
"D: On a hot day I could easily see myself drinking a six pack of this and not even thinking twice about it being over 7%. Its crisp and refreshing with enough hop presence to take in before each gulp."
"This beer poured a clear amber color and formed a snow white foamy head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, hops, pepper, and caramel. The flavor was of malt, caramel, and pepper. The body was medium light and the finish slightly smokey."
"It's a great food beer, good with sturdy salads and light to moderately flavoured dishes. I'd pick it as a good introduction to food pairing with lightly spiced meats and cheeses. There's little to fault, it's a superbly balanced pale wheat brew that continually surprises."
"For some reason I thought this would have more a 'bright' hop presence. Does a good a job at still drinking like a wheat ale, though a very hoppy one. Improved as it warmed too."
"d- very drinkable, great balance of hops and malt"
"D: Pretty interesting full hopped american wheat is a nice ""mild"" IPA with a clean sweetness. Very easy to drink."
"So enjoyable and so drinkable. Try it, you'll like it."
"The color when poured was a clear golden yellow with a medium amount of foam that disapated almost immediately. The smell of piney hops was evident in the aroma. But, the taste of bitter hops, citrus (lemon & orange rind), with a hint of yeast was also evident in the flavor. The bittness was not overpowering, but, could of been a little more sutle. This American Pale Whea Ale, was more like an IPA rather than the Wheat Ale."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a very nice hoppier than average wheat beer worth drinking for a long time."
"Taste follows the smell, but shows a bit more of the light malt base. Sugar Cookie malts, but very lightly. Great canvas for the hop character. Light medium bodied, with nice prickly carbonation. Works well. Extremely drinkable and doesn't even show a hint if the abv."
"D: Standard Lagunitas fare, fairly good, but nothing spectacular."
"Drinkability: The nice crisp profile of the wheat with an american ale style yeast and hops make this guy a winner."
"The body is around medium with a slick feel and very sharp carbonation. The tingle lasts long through the dry finish. Boy, I think I found a refreshing summer drinker.... that has a load of hops even! I'm impressed, Bravo Lagunitas for filling a gap for the green-geeks out there, this beer is a little sumpin' sumpin' different."
"D. Was surprised how good this beer was very easy drinking and dangerously addictive. Hop heads beer for sure."
"D/O - If you're a hop fan, this one is for the long haul. It's by no means overbearing, but it's certainly not a character to go unnoticed."
"D: Borderline IPA/APA, but enjoyable nevertheless. This one is light enough and crisp enough to be highly drinkable."
"An IPA crossed with a wheat beer then pumped up to close to DIPA regions works when the brewery is Lagunitas. Hoppy, citrusy and crisp the beer is at times light like a wheat beer then big hops like an IPA. Very drinkable and thirst quenching. Excellent beer that is luckily available in BC"
"Hoppy wheat is what the beer geeks are callin' for. This beer has a thick, wheat-induced head and clear, pale amber color. It has some sweet breadiness underneath a big tide of hop aroma. It's super smooth and easy to drink. It has a thick flavor of soft, floral and fruity hops, and the bitterness is there, but nothing too sharp--more like dried grass or tobacco. This beer has a bit of a snappy, dry malt character and is faintly yeasty with some warming esters. The hops stay on the palate far into the aftertaste. This one has it all figured out--an amazing ale."
"I'm drinking this really quickly, as it's an amazing surprise, and there is not a trace of the alcohol. If you want a hop smack, this will do you as well as Stone IPA or even Blind Pig."
"Pours a clear pale golden with a thin foamy white head. Nose is dominated by grapefruit hops, citrus and flowery auroma. Good notes of caramel malts. Taste is a chewy, bready malt upfront, some woody/grassy characteristics too. Sharp bitterness towards the finish which is dry in the mouthfeel. Smooth and medium bodied. Easy drinker here, my only regret is not getting a six pack."
"D- Definitely a nice wheat beer. I'd pick it up again if I saw it on tap somewhere."
"They call this a wheat beer, I call this a damned good IPA."
"OVERALL: Way too easy to drink for a 7.5%er."
"Cheers!"
"D - Almost no booze in the profile for the 7+% AB. Holds a great hop character that isn't clawing and doesn't leave a sharp bitterness or dryness in on your palate. The flavors are fantastic and the carbonation is restrained but refreshing. A fantastic American session beer."
"Hard to believe this is considered a Wheat Ale, a type I usually avoid. Fortunately I did not know before buying a 6-pack! I picked it because the label said IBU 74.2, and indeed, it is more like IPA than wheat beer. Better than regular Lagunitas IPA, not as good as their Maximus IPA. The label is kind of stupid, like St. Pauli Girl, so I turned the bottles around in our refrigerator so my wife couldn't see them."
"Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale has a yellow colour and a good head that lasts. It has a nice hoppy smell with a hint of citrus. The taste is hoppy with a hint of citrus bitterness. It's nice and foamy in the mouth and very drinakable. It's delicious."
"D: Probably the most hopped out pale wheat I've ever had, and decidedly American west coast hop-forward, as expected of Lagunitas. The 7.5% ABV carries a nice warming sensation but isn't really translated in a lot of alcoholic heat in the flavor. Not to be pounded in the summer heat, rather reserved for the IPA fan who wants a wheat ale."
"D - The drinkability is good. I think this is a great summer beer. It is really refreshing, and the taste leaves you wanting more. I would have no problem drinking a 6-pack of this."
"Drinkability: Starts out fairly lite and refreshing and finishes with some hop bitterness. I must say I didn't know what to expect with a hoppy wheat beer, but I like it. A pretty good beer overall and one I enjoy regularly."
"I'm really starting to get a lot of respect for this brewery, and am sorry that it's taken me this long to get around to trying this and some of their other terrific offerings."
"The ""Little Sumpin"" opens with a thick glob of a head atop a light golden body, within which rise a sporadic school of carbonation bubbles. Lay-gun-ee-tus? Upon raising your glass for the initial sip, the nose is immediately overwhelmed by a hearty aroma of grapefruit. This grapefruit theme continues on to the palate; however, there is perceptible malt finish here. As for the mouthfeel: it is moderately chewy without any identification to discern it to be a wheat ale - in fact, one could mistake it for an IPA, albeit one with a lighter body. Lagoon-it-is?"
"Drinkability- May be easy to drink for some but others could only drink one of these and have to switch to something lighter/sweeter. I enjoyed 4 out of the 6-pack and let my girlfriend's Dad have the other two."
"Paid $8.99 for a growler at the local beer store and as usual, any Lagunitas is a good call. Will drink this again - preferably in the summer."
"D: The beer is very drinkable because the alcohol content is well hidden."
"Had on-tap at Apex in portland out of a standard pint glass. It is a transparent golden orange color with visible carbonation and a one finger white head. Smell is very hoppy, with floral and grapefruit notes. As far as smell goes it doesn't share many attributes with a standard wheat ale, it smells more like an APA or an IPA. The taste has a little more wheat in it, but the emphasis is still on the hops not the wheat. Mouthfeel is good, very crisp and refreshing. Overall this beer is similar to gumballhead, but i think I like gumballhead better. I am not sure how I feel about this being a ""wheat beer"" as there isn't a lot of wheat in the taste. If you want a wheat beer then go for an american knock off of a hefeweizen, but if you are looking for an APA or IPA that has a touch of wheat in it then this is what you are looking for."
"D: An absolutely fantastic beer, may be considered a summer beer but due to it's spicy nature it works for the winter also. Real beer lovers use hops as mistle toe anyway."
"Delicious!"
"D: Pleasing brew and def worth the buy."
"Some beers are flavourful enough to sip contemplatively over the course of an entire evening. Others are delicious enough to want to chug in one giant gulp. As Lagunitas says: ""life is uncertain. Don't sip"". Guys, trust me, you don't have to tell me twice; with a beer like this that's all too easy to do. Hell, this bottle's been done for a while now!"
"D/O- Wow, for a 7.5%abv beer one could almost make this a 6 pack night, wrecked palate and all. Alcohol presence is virtually non-recognizable...damn tasty. Wow, didn't think I'd like anything in this style more than Gumballhead but alas..here it is."
"Taste is very hop-forward, more citrus hops, tropical notes, finishes with an aspirin like astringency. Very crisp and refreshing. You just want to keep going for more and more but have to calm yourself due to the 7.5% ABV. Phenomenal beer."
"D: I am definitely going to make this a regular."
"D: Delicious. Just a good beer overall."
"Could drink a few of these in a sitting."
"This gave me the illusion of being really drinkable until I had four of them... I made the mistake of checking the ABV afterwards. Fun night."
"For a wheat ale, it has a little too bitter aftertaste, but since I'm a hop lover, I approve. Easy to enjoy and fairly drinkable."
"The mouthfeel was medium in density with adequate carbonation. This was a unique American Wheat/IPA hybrid."
"Firstly im stoked to be able drink this big cheers to Adam to making it happen,it pours a nice vibrant orange hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves a one finger head of smog across the top and average lacing,the smell is distinctly pine needle hops,bubblegum and sweet golden wheat,it has a nice medium bodied lively carbonated mouthfeel which feels really refreshing and has tastes of orange zest,piney hops and finishes with a lemon,lime golden wheat hit which is quite dry and makes you want another sip straight away,overall i cannot really say anything bad about this brew apart from the fact its not a regular on our shores and i cant wait to try the rest of their lineup ive got waiting."
"Nice color on this beer, orange golden color. Disappointing otherwise, not much head at all, very spotty if any lacing. Aroma is citrusy, lemon, and grassy vegatile notes. Also very light aroma of grapefruit. Taste is pretty fruity, with some sweetness, bitterness from the hops. Not all too complex. The alcohol is well hidden and the beer drinks well, it tastes sessionable. Overall I liked this beer more when I first tried it on tap. Perhaps just an older bottle?"
"Wow, I could drink this all day. Easy to see why Sumpin' is ranked as the #2 APWA, as this compares quite favourably to Gumballhead. A fantastic example of the style and one of my top-rated beers."
"D) A nice brew - I don't think I would classify it as a pale wheat ale, seems more like a Pale Ale to IPA. I'd drink another."
"Not only is the drinkability right there with any session beer, but this is one dangerous brew. Careful when drinking because with it's 7.5% abv, it'll certainly knock you down."
"Seemingly yet another variation of their IPA. Still a good beer you can't go wrong with."
"Drinkability: Over-hopped for the style, by a lot! I get the feeling that that's why it's ranked so much higher than the majority of pale wheat ales. Lame. This is a good beer, but it's not true to the style. Drinks like an IPA."
"Who doesn't love gettin' themselves a little sumpin' sumpin', eh? This potential entendre pours a cloudy straw topped by two fingers of white froth. The nose comprises grapefruit, melon, light onion, flowers and light caramel. The taste is more of the same, with some light clove, pepper, nutmeg thrown in for good measure. The body is medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a semi-dry finish. Overall, a very nice bit o' brew, something that I'm upset I took so long to try."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability/notes: I probably wouldn't have guessed that this was a wheat ale if it didn't say so on the bottle, but there's something about added wheat that always lightens things up. 7.5% is a fairly high ABV for a wheat, but it doesn't make this any harder to throw back. Not to mention everything is completely balanced. Quite refreshing...I was surprised how much I liked this given it's not my go-to style."
"This beer pours a hazy orange color with decent lacing from the frothy white foam head. The smell is of lots of hops, particularly the pine and lemon aroma derived from the hops used. The taste is honestly not nearly as hoppy as I had expected, and as a matter of fact that was a good surprise. There's not a hell of a lot to the taste, but the main components are citrus (lemony) and hints of banana. It feels really nice on the tongue and is one of the better drinking beers I know."
"I love, love, love this beer. I wrote Lagunitas a few months ago begging them to keep this a year-round brew, and a few months later they announced that it would indeed be year round. This says something about it. A hoppy, complex brew that's incredibly drinkable and hides its ABV dangerously well. What's not to love?"
"Growler fill from tap at BierKraft. Poured into shaker, Super aroma of hops and citrus when poured. Very bubbly large white head, head glued it self to the sides of the glass and is long lasting. I've just poured my third glass and this is quite drinkable. Each pour the head gets larger and more sticky. Slightly cloudy golden color. Smooth mouthfeel, light and bitter on the tongue. Taste great, nice smooth drinkable and wheat pale ale. Mostly pale ale with some wheat."
"Tastes heavy of grapefruit but not all bitter rind - it has a nice full flavor of the flesh of the fruit. A very nice wheat beer more hoppy than others I've had."
"Mouthfeel was pretty big because of all the hops so you probably would want to drink more that one or two."
"D- Alcohol is well hidden which makes it easy to drink. Along with a good mix of hop flavors."
"At first I wasn't entirely convinced, but the more I drank it the more I liked it. An outstanding offering by Lagunitas."
"The 7.5% will sneak up on you I think because you don't taste it..."
"Does Lagunitas make a bad beer? I've never tried one at least. Some may argue that their hop profile is one-sided, I cant necessarily disagree but I love it nonetheless. Grab one if you see it, if you like it, seek out its counterpart, lil Sumpin' Wild, Westmalle yeast and some extra strength make for another great take on this American wheat/ipa/whatever the hell this tasty thing is."
"Don't judge a book by its cover. I'm glad I didn't (eventually), because this is a really tasty brew, and an exceptionally drinkable one. The characters are unusual, but balance against each other well. I love slightly off-kilter beers that still work so well. This is a good example of one."
"Clear golden bodied brew, small but sturdy foamy white head, leaves its mark on the glass. Big hop scent for a wheat, definitely not run of the mill for a wheat. Citrus hops, grapefruit, nice wheat undertones, but its dominated by the hops. Alcohol spiciness is a bit more noticeable due to the wheat character i think. Thin to med bodied. Very interesting and pretty damn good tasting too. Try it"
"Bottle: Poured a lightly hazy dirty amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of West Coast hops is noticeable though not too powerful. Taste is also a good mix between some citrusy hops with a nice bitter presence and a good malt backbone though wheat is hardly noticeable. Another easily drinkable beer from Lagunitas with not too much complexity."
"D - Drinks closer to a big pale or an IPA. The wheat is not as noticeable as it is with other beers in this style."
"D: Decent. Thought it would be maltier. If there was more elements of a pale wheat, it would be better."
"D: rich enough for colder weather, cheeky enough for warm...good stuff"
"D: Definitely bitter and chock full of hops, but it doesn't leave your throat with that dry, barren patch that you get some high IBU, high abv pale ales. I love that patch, but it leaves me desiring a glass of water. This beer counters the bitterness with a subdued sweetness that is at the same time refreshing and complex."
"ah this beer is great>>>you know with lagunitas its always very good or pretty good>>>always been satisfied with their beer>>>i think the westmalle yeast strain did this beer very well>>>i can actually relate this beer to westmalle>>>left this beer pretty dry>>>>it smells like dark fruit and def. hops>>>a little alcohol in the nose as well>>>>darn fine beer"
"Could drink more, but I'd be much more likely to seek out a multitude of West Coast IPAs at around the same ABV."
"M/D: Medium bodied, extremely drinkable. Leaves a very nice finish. The 7.5% is hidden extremely well. Surprised me that this beer is classified as a Pale Wheat, but I will take it. A great beer."
"A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale is an excellent release from Lagunitas. I don't really see, smell, or taste any evidence that this is an American Pale Wheat, but it must be. For what it's worth, it's among the best in the style if that's true. The hop presence alone carries it to the top. If you haven't had the opportunity to try this fine release from Lagunitas, do yourself a favor and find a 6-pack...or more if possible."
"American Pale Wheat Ale my sort of pale Canadian ass. I know that this is made with wheat malt, then, ok, but the rest of the story screams out tasty WC IPA, despite the wheatiness, and I'm not going to fault a damned agreeable beer for being cast in the wrong category because of the black sheep in its makeup."
"Drinkability - My days of big hop are long in the past, but this works and is a very easy drinking beer. The hops are certainly present, but are well balanced by the malt."
"If not sessionable, still very drinkable. My son-in-law, who's a Miller Lite type of beer drinker, really liked this beer. I was going to hide the 6pack from him; but, in an effort to further his beer education, I gave him four of the six bottles."
"Overall, an amazing beer that I'm glad I tried. Been disappointed with most APWA's so almost didn't grab it but read some good things on it so did. So glad I did. Really enjoyed this one and need to go get a 6xer before they are gone. Highly recommend. Avail here in TX. Rotation - seasonal release. During the season it will make the heavy rotation for sure. [H,Y]"
"Pours a pale orange with modest white head. Aromas of grapefruit, honey, flowers, and peaches. Lightly sweet subdued malt backbone with medium tart strong citrus middle and lightly bitter grassy hops. Medium body with average carbonation and slightly chewy texture. Juicy and citrusy with a great complex fresh hop finish. Whether it's a wheat ale, or IPA, I did it...."
"Taste is spicey-peppery leaf, grapefruit, and guava. It has light dominant bitterness with faint underlying caramelly-raisiny-fruity grain sweetness. What character it has soon blurs and degrades to be less distinguishable character overall and rather one-dimensional. It has some basic, decent character but not much. Feel, at least, is good, full, a bit creamy. Peppery-citrusy bitterness is a bit to sharp and strong at the finish and lingers. Drinkability is decent, but it is very tiresome. At least it tastes a little different from the 90% of Lagunitas beers that all taste like variations of the same beer."
"overall: I really enjoyed this one! really nice mix of hops and malt I loved it! Gunna have to drink more of this next summer! Cheers to Lagunitas!"
"But... It us a good pale ale. Filled with American hops. The classic flavors and aromas of citrus. The beer was served very cold but it seemed to have a fine mouthfeel and tasted fresh and clean."
"Good Drinkability for those who like the hops. nice amount of carbonation. Overall a good beer to take time to have one or two mixed in when your thirsty for a few. Not one for those who prefer a mild domestic brew. This is my 1st updated review of this brew. I put it as my second favorite behind Pliney."
"D: From the first sip this beer shouts ""Lagunitas"" with its recognizable combination of floral and citrus aromatic qualities--the IPA is definitely there, as in Sumpin' Extra. Even Hop Stoopid may be eligible for first cousin-status. Despite the evident resemblance to other family members, this beer should not be known by association alone. From a stylistic standpoint it is miles from the middle, with all the qualities of a strong IPA--not exactly what one might expect from a wheat beer."
"d- awesome, i picked up a case of this without tasting it and don't regret it for a second. this beer definately lived up to all the hype."
"Very drinkable, Lil Sumpin Sumpin is just a damn good beer. Great balance between fruitiness, bitterness and sweetness. Very easy to enjoy a few in a sitting."
"Pours golden with decent white head, good penetration of color, and overall handsome beer. Aromas of mixed citrus with light herbal qualities are noted. On the palate the herbal/citrus comes through nicely with some soft wheaty cracker in the background. Finishes with some of the herbal elements that linger for a bit on the palate."
"Moderate carbonation and a resinous, creamy mouthfeel. Grapefruit and tangerine up front followed by some biscuit and caramel sweetness. Gentle pine bitterness on the finish gains intensity as the beer warms. Well-balanced and very drinkable (higher alcohol is almost undetectable)."
"D- Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. It's a nice refreshing hoppy brew that is highly drinkable. Recommended!"
"Really good beer overall -- one of the better offerings from Lagunitas in my opinion. I remember liking it a bit more on-tap, but it's well worth picking up a sixer of bottles."
"Outstanding very hoppy American Pale Wheat. I loved gumballhead but it isn't available in MI. This is just even better. Outstanding!"
"This is a wheat beer? I honestly couldn't tell. When this one was going down, my impression was that it was another hoppy IPA-ish brew (also called, ""Strong"" from what I've seen). On tap at Founding Farmers in DC, most noticeable factors in this light yellow beer were its huge fruitiness, which is mainly pineapple and citrus. These help bring some sweetness to the fairly strong hop presence. A light beer, light body, pretty high in carbonation. Overall, a respectable beer, but not standard for the style, in the least. Solid."
"D: Highly enjoyable and worthy of purchasing a case once a year."
"D - This was delicious with an offering of hops that slightly overpowered the malts, but was nicely balanced. The flavours were fruity and provided for a very pleasureable experience. Highly recommended to anoyone who likes hops, but doesn't want something that will overpower the tastebuds."
"Despite being 7.5% ABV, this is a very drinkable beer. It is light and refreshing and it would be easy to drink multiple bottles."
"Quite drinkable at 7.5 abv. Just finishes clean making you want to try another."
"D - A very tasty brew for those of us who like the bitter life."
"Drinkability: Another great deal from Lagunitas (probably the best value brewery in the US). Have had this on draft and out of the bottle and I think this might be my favorite summer seasonal beer."
"D - A really great beer that I could drink alot of. The alcohol will get you as it is almost unnoticable."
"This is now my favorite summer seasonal and one of my go to hoppy beers."
"Now on to the beer store for my next Lagunitas."
"D - this was recently one of the first ""clone"" type recipes i brewed - love the style for its hop assertiveness yet ease of drink. hides a 7.5ABV very dangerously. give me more!"
"Repost almost 3 years later now. My oh my how the palate changes or maybe the recipe ??? I don't know how I could have disliked this beer. It is now my fallback summer beer. Very tasty and Overhopped for the style ??? Whatever the hell that means. LOL. Anyway Love this stuff."
"D - A very tasty beer indeed."
"Pours a golden orange with a thin head of small, soap-like cream-colored bubbles. The aroma is clean but fruity, with big citrus notes of lemon and orange. The flavor is much of the same, with a big citrus hop character up front with some pine and a bit of an earthy undercurrent. This one may be an even more hopped-up pale wheat than I remember 3 Floyd's Gumballhead being. The texture is quite dry, and the prickly carbonation doesn't add constructively. Overall, it's an over-hopped light wheat ale that still doesn't compare to a strong pale ale but also loses the qualities of the wheat. Nice and drinkable, but not special."
"Clear golden color with a large head that had excellant retention before settling to a thick cap. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is full of hops. Wonderful citrus and pine aromas wafting off this beer. Very one dimensional in aroma and flavor. All hops as the malt did not stand a chance against the hops. The featured hops give a powerful citrus blast to the tastebuds. A larger body than most in the style. Good carbonation without being harsh. A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale is a hoppier, more bitter, and brasher Gumballhead. But it is not as drinkable or enjoyable because of this. A good hop delivery device if that is your thing."
"12oz bottle. Pours a yellowish gold color with a thin head. Lots of lacing. Great aroma of piney hops, grapefruit, and citrus. Taste is of some nice citrus blends and a hoppy finish. This is another easy to drink beer by Lagunitas. Lots of flavor and smooth."
"Poured into a Firestone Walker pint glass. Liquid gold in color with a quarter inch of off white head which disappears to a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Strong smell of piney-hop resin with some grapefruit. Taste is similar with a mildly bitter aftertaste. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation and quite drinkable. This doesn't taste as good as last years batch - which is unfortunate, as that was delicious. Still, this is a very tasty beer and quenches ones thirst on a warm summer's day quite readily."
"Another great offering from Lagunitas. As stated, abit too sweet but a nice hoppy wheat ale."
"I haven't had all that many pale wheat ales, but Little Sumpin' Sumpin' is the clear champ among those I've sampled. If I had to describe this to someone in a bar in one sentence, it'd be ""a bit like an IPA, though a bit more sessionable."" Seek this one out."
"Certainly this is interesting and worthwhile to try. I have the rest of a sixer and the rest of the weekend so i hope this grows on me but right now I'm a bit underwhelmed. Did I speak too soon about Lag?"
"Overall- I have heard this described as an amped up gumballhead. They are both hoppy wheat beers but I think the comparison really ends there. This is good but not great."
"A very cool and innovative mixture of pale ale and wheat. Love it!"
"Rich golden color with a slight head. It has a subtle, but sweet, banana and peach flavor balanced out with a citrus hop finish. The mouthfeel is well balanced and refreshing. It wouldn't be something to be enjoyed in the winter, but on a hot summer day or a mild fall afternoon would be easily enjoyed one after the another after another."
"D: Quite a take on a wheat ale and really a phenomenal idea. Douse a wheat ale with hops and see what happens. What happens is yumminess."
"Notes: The beer is very unique and really makes me say ""there really is a little something in there"" that makes you think and question your taste buds. It's a little off but everything just works. Leans towards an IPA."
"Overall: This has become one of my favorites and am sad that it is a limited release from a brewery, Lagunitas, that is fast becoming one of my favorites. You can't call this beer an outright hop-bomb. You can't call it a pure wheat ale as it is too hoppy. The tang is what gets me. With the hops and big body, this is a memorable beer."
"Overall, a really drinkable, flavorful beer. Really hoppy but balanced. A great summer beer."
"Drinkability is moderate. The flavor profile is nice, but the ABV is getting towards the high end which limits intake. Overall not a bad beer, just not very unique."
"On at tap at Bodega on the patio, a server's suggestion that was right on the head, served in a pint glass. A lightly clear with good retention and lacing...The aroma is nothing special, pretty light honey a little hops on the back. Easy to drink and tasty."
"Pours a mostly clear golden body with a small white head that lasts for about two minutes. The nose is predominantly hoppy, with a lot of orange and lemon citrusy notes and whispers of floral aromas. Tastewise, the front and mid-palates are remarkably balanced. The malts are caramelly in nature and the hops are consistent with the nose. The hops don't dominate until the finish, which is pretty quick and dry. Not the boldest of it's style, by any means, but one of the most easily drinkable all on its own."
"D - great mix of flavour complexity with a hop feature that I always enjoy, the 7.5% ABV is well concealed, and the bitter leaves me thirsty, Lagunitas does it again!"
"D -- I would say that this is a solid brew that would be worth a repeat."
"Pours a slightly hazy dark hay color with a slightly rocky white head. Nice fresh citrus aroma, with a lot of lemon. Good flavor of refreshing citrus and hop spice. There's a bit of wheat at the finish. Light-bodied with light carbonation. Overall this is neither an IPA nor a wheat beer, but something very in-between, though leaning towards the IPA. It is really refreshing, which I like, and easy to drink. Could be a good introduction to hops for wheat beer lovers, or a nice ""staycation"" for IPA lovers."
"Well done."
"D - The tingle of the hops make this one a little less refreshing than other brews of this style. Still, very tasty and I could down a few."
"MF/D: very light on the tongue, short lasting, but excellent for a summer afternoon session."
"This beer is heavy on the hops and alcohol and light on the malts, like many popular California brews. If that's your thing you'll like this beer."
"Working on my third case of this one, its about time to review it. This is a killer session beer. Delicious fruity wheat underneath a rush of tangy and piney hops. Crisp and refreshing, leaves you wanting more every time you sip it. Nice light golden color, head is ok, froths up nicely at first and quickly dissipates. Fresh hoppy punch on initial taste followed by a sweet pineapply mid palate and dry crisp finish. Cant get enough of it. Drink it fresh."
"D - this is not your run-of-the-mill wheat beer. Very hoppy with some nice malt flavors that help make this a little more complex. Too bad I only bought one of these - I wish more were on the shelf."
"D - Not for me but if you like this style I am sure its drinkable as it is very light. The hoppy taste will really sit well with that crowd."
"Notes: Another remarkable Lagunitas offering, this is certainly highlighting their dexterity with hoppy profiles and on this one they are really delivering a master lesson. And as always the price/quality ratio is remarkable, what is there not to like?"
"Overall- to me this brew is better than the little sumpin extra pale ale. i did a couple shots from hard luck candy ( MADE IN MI!!!) root beer barrel vodka and still managed to knock down 5 out of the 6 pack. i will prolly do one more shot and finish the 6. even tho i'm hammered i will say this is prolly lagunitas best brew. but i still haven't had the maximus ipa."
"this was the summer beer of choice. i was overtaken (in a good way) by the citrus/grapefruit scents at first. then comes the creamy smooth texture of this monster. i have to say this is my favorite summer beer of all time. will await the year round releas as some have posted. great job lagunitas!"
"Overall, an excellent beer. The flavors here are complex and fruity. The style is marked as a ""wheat"" beer, which it may be...but all flavor signs point to an IPA, and a well-done one at that."
"Another great one from Lagunitas."
"Definitely a hop focused wheat that while not overpowering or harsh in regards to hop usage, a bit too salty and tongue drying for my liking. In any event, a thirst quencher for sure."
"D - A Tasty end of summer selection, thanks again tb69! I wanted to try this for a while, I think it is an IPA in wheat beer clothes basically, but plenty of west coast hop in this tasty wheat."
"62 IBU's and 7.5% alcohol. I guess you expect that from a super sweet and hoppy beer. It's very fragrant (citrus, floral) with a pale, slightly copper color. The head doesn't last long at all. Don't even bother with a swirl or high pour. All you'll get is a flatter beer rather than a nice foam. It's powereful sweet side works well to cut through spicy food."
"mf/d- This has body! Feel is prickly and kinda smooth. A few of these would go down just fine!"
"D - Medium to high even with the +7% ABV. Not normally a fan of many ""wheat"" offerings, but this is an IPA with some wheat in it, so I'm loving it!"
"This beer really blew me away when I first tried it, and I was pumped to find out that they recently added this to thier year round line up. Great effort by the guys at Lagunitas"
"Value: You sure get what you pay for with these Lagunitas beers."
"Drinkability: I noted the higher ABV fairly quickly with this one, but that's because it was so good that I drank it fairly quickly. That being said, this one is dangerous - I want another one but I know I shouldn't it. It's a great beer - went fantastic with a meal (mustard pork-chops and potato gnocchi) and I think it would be good alone also. I can see why so many people have rated this beer highly - it is a very very good beer."
"The taste is bitter hops with a mild bit of wheat tossed in. I could not drink more than one of these particularly as it warms."
"Drinkability: Wow! I really like this one. A very nicely done summer brew. Lots of citrus hop aroma/flavor, mild hop bitterness, and an easy drinking brew for such a high ABV. I will have to be sure to pick this up every summer."
"MF/D: The mouthfeel is medium and very smooth. The drink is boarder line excellent. This is 7.5%? I don't think so."
"drinkability is good no matter what time of year it is"
"Drinkability: super refreshing and tasty; like I said, this beer just rubs me the right way. Good stuff."
"bottom line--in bottles i can give this an A- or B+. on draft fresh--a solid A."
"D - Considering the higher ABV for a wheat ale this goes down real easy."
"D- this is one killer pale wheat. I can't get enough of it. A great summer day brew for labor day weekend."
"D-I think I would try this one again. But the craft beer aisle at binnys is limitless."
"Extremely drinkable, has a huge range of flavors and I really can't even put this beer into one category which I like about it. It has the wheat beer flavors but also those of an india pale ale combined with a mouthfeel I would expect out of a scottish cream ale. It's one of the more complex flavor profiles I have found with Lagunitas and it won't dissapoint."
"-Bye"
"Nice tasty Pale Wheat. Glad to find it on this business trip."
"Mouthfeel is good, I'd like a touch more creaminess as opposed to the slightly sharp edge the carbonation gives this. But the body is lush and light at the same time, medium in weight, and really clean. Overall, I really like this beer and will be adding it to my normal rotation. Up there with the best of the APW's."
"pours a deep golden color thin head and quickly fading lace. now things start to get better smells fruity along with some pine resin. then the first taste. hops hit you right off then the different fruit flavors mixing with that pine resin and the smooth thick mouthfeel lets you know that your drinking a nice beer here. drinkability? i definitely need more."
"This is super hoppy for the style, and might be one of my favorite Lagunitas beers ever. Nice!"
"Overall, a great brew worthy the price of admission."
"This beer is drinkable given the ABV, the alcohol makes its presence known but isn't overwhelming by any means."
"The mouthfeel is good and the drinkablility is great. This is a great beer."
"Pours a golden hue into a pint glass with a minimal head. The evident smells are light, floral hops. The taste is upfront hops, without being overwhelming. Somehow this beer manages to be both light and hoppy, a rare breed in my experiences. The hop bitterness is not to the extent of an IPA, but the hop flavor is prevalent. This could easily be a session beer, and I highly recommend it."
"A little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale brings some much needed interest to an American pale wheat beer. The hops are ever-present, but never overpowering. The alcohol is kept well in check. While definitely a sweet beer, it never goes syrupy. Kudos to Lagunitas for another tasty hop heads brew."
"D- I could drink these all night!"
"This beer really surprised me. I was thinking--""Pale Wheat Ale? Probably not my style," but this one delivered, much like Gumballhead. Pours a nice hazy golden yellow with a bit of white head. Smell is big on the hops, like a wheat IPA, kind of. Big leafy and piney hops. Taste is similar, some nice wheat malt notes backed by some serious hops. Light bodied, nicely carbonated, definitely an enjoyable take on the style. Good drinkability, though the ABV is a bit high for the style. Alcohol is nicely masked however. Good work here from a consistently decent brewery."
"Overall: ""Gumballhead"" .... you now have a run for your money!"
"I am not a hop head by any means, but I do try to be as open minded as possible about very hoppy beers. Tony seems to have found a great balance in this beer which allows someone like me to enjoy the full hop flavor without being overwhelmed by it. Which is incredible in a beer at 64 IBU. Kudos to job well done."
"D - Very enjoyable beer...more IPA than pale wheat ale. Plenty of hop flavor and bitterness...hard to beat as a companion to spicy food. Would be easy to have a couple more of these."
"Orange citrusy, with a hidh level palate hit, but wasn't a good pairing with the pesto chicken pizza. Had a hops head after this that was much better."
"D - This is 7.3% abv? It drinks like 4%. Very easy drinker."
"Drinkability: a very drinkable beer that is slightly dry. i would love this beer in the summer or early spring."
"OVERALL: A very enjoyable beer for sure. A more persistent and fuller head would help the look of this one, but the other aspects were very nice. It's listed as a pale wheat ale, but there's nothing wheat-like about it. It's kind of an ultra ESB crossed with an American IPA. This one is a little different than the norm, and I'm glad I picked one up on a whim. Recommended."
"Lagunitas Brewing Company--Little Sumpin' sumpin' ale--Limited Release--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 7.50% ABV. 64.20 IBU's. (3.75 / 5.0) Pale Ale. Thin thin lace white head. Clear bright thin gold color. Lagunitas standard hop profile mild floral flowery front. Mild sweet slightly creamy rich golden cream ale pale ale tangy fruit hint crisp body. Tangy mild hop spice end. Hoppy Cream Ale? Sampled 8/25/2010. 6-Pack $9.79."
"DB- A rerfreshing beer. The pine hops and citrus become somewhat out of check as time goes by. The nose is great but the taste is a bit of a let down compared to it. Good beer, but it joins the fruit hop aroma to pine-zest taste club."
"Pours a clean yellow/ orange-ish color with a white head. In the aroma grapefruity citrus hops. In the taste, citrus grapefruity hops and orange juice like, a bit sticky sweet. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel and a semi dry grapefruity citrus aftertaste. Nice hops and hides ABV, smooth and easy to drink."
"Resinously hoppy grapefruit juice with a light wheaty malt background...what a surprise. While it is a good beer, I am becoming increasingly bored with hoppy Lagunitas offerings that seem like the same shit over and over again. Where is the originality? Innovation? I just dont see it from a brewery I still admire for doing great beers, but damn, change it up a little, please?!"
"D - If this beer is around, and you opt for something else... well, I'd like to know what that is."
"Cheers"
"D: Tail Gate approval or Pounding Down Approval"
"This overall is a very enjoyable beer. I almost wish I had gotten two growlers of it."
"drinkability - this one is a monster wheat, delicious, dangerous...could session this"
"D: I could have quite a few of these!"
"Comes out of the tap a slightly hazy golden with an average white head. Aroma is epically hoppy and has an evergreen overtone, promising a seriously hoppy beer. (Because of this, I thought maybe I had actually had A Little Sumpin' Stoopid instead!) Flavor is seriously hoppy and has a firm tone of grapefruit. Texture is fairly fizzy and lively, leaving behind a nice tingle."
"This is a great summer beer and something I could drink all season long."
"Overall a fantastically hoppy refreshing Pale Wheat Ale. It's the West Coasts version of a FFF Gumball Head! The hop intensity and flavor is big, bright and clean. I'll definitely be heading back to the store where I bought this single and purchase a couple sixers for certain."
"Had this one on tap at the Griffon (21Aug10)... Poured a light honey gold into a shaker pint with a one-finger, gently poured head; good sheets of lace. Smell is dominated by tropical fruits, some citrus and peach rind. Taste is a good mix of sweet hops (pineapple, apricot, mango) and some drier grapefruit rind and peach rind on the finish. A touch of wheat / grain provides some malt balance, but hops are the focus of this beer. Mouthfeel is light, crisp and refreshing - an awesome summertime IPA - errr... ""American Pale Wheat!"" Haha - tastes like an IPA to me - just a little lighter in color and body (yet its abv is actually higher than Lagunitas IPA??). Really impressed by this one."
"Overall: One of my favorite American Pale Wheat Ales to date. You've got to like the slight bitterness and the mix of citrus to enjoy this one. Very drinkable beer, perfect any time. Also, I should note that it tends to be more fragrant and taste better as it gets closer to room temperature."
"m/d-very light in the mouth and goes down really smooth. This is much more drinkable than I expected"
"D - I wish this beer was year around it would be one of my go to beer. Very well done."
"Love this delicious and very drinkable ale. They can call it whatever they want, but I'm calling it an IPA. Would love to see them make this a year-rounder."
"Overall: Excellent beer. I wish this were around all year. If you see it, buy it."
"Thanks to John @ Granite Liquors. Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. A very pale yellow color with excellent clarity. Has a white head that starts thick, but ends up pretty thin. The thin layer skims the top of the liquid the whole time. Would've gone with a 3.5, but the lacing saved it. Sticks to the glass very well. The smell is awesome, extremely hoppy, well at least for the style. The citrus hops stand out, much like a well hopped APA or a slightly milder IPA. There are some malts that collaborate with the hops, so it finishes with a slight sweetness. The taste is good too, but a slight step down from the smell. Much like the smell, the hops are still the strong point. Tastes of grapfruit and citrus zest, providing a bit of an earthy bitter taste. The malts aren't as strong, but they start everything off with a sweet base. Can't completely figure it out, tastes like they are roasted, , maybe almost over-roasted. It's good, far more malts than many of this style, and the hop to malt ratio is great, however the bitterness to sweetness could be a little better. The mouthfeel has great body to it. I have found many APWA's to be very light, but this is a little closer to medium. My only knock on it is the bitterness comes out a little strong and there is a slight earthy bitter finish that could have been cleaner. Don't get me wrong, it's still great, just me being over-critical. Dispite how I whiny I sound about that I still find the beer very drinkable. Generally not a fan of this style but this ber has given me a healthy curiosity of it, I may try more. I'd definitely drink this more, especially in the summer."
"D- Wow, I need more of this stuff. This really is the ultimate summer APWA."
"D: This beer is not like others of the style - and that's a good thing. Drinkable."
"As good as this brew is from the bottle, it is even more lush and tasty on-tap. Bready malts with nice wheat tang and massive citrus and floral hoppiness comes at you even fresher on-tap. The thick, coating mouthfeel is the best part of this brew. Drinkable for big-beer lovers and new-to-craft drinkers alike."
"What an amazing beer to end my summer with. Sumpin' sumpin' is a phenomenal brew from lagunitas, probably the best thing they have made. Living in Ohio, this is the closest thing to gumballhead I have ever had and you can't go wrong with 8.50 pitchers of this. This is a delicious wheat beer with the finish of a very floral IPA. A nice thick head with a lovely earthy summer scent. Definitely one of the tastiest and most drinkable beers I have ever had."
"Initially I did not think I would like this beer and I'm no stranger to liking hoppy beers but it was oviously a bit on the cold side initially. I warmed up to it as it warmed up and I now find a Little Sumpin' Sumpin' something indeed!"
"Medium bodied, nice carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink. There isn't much to say, except I like this beer a lot, and will be looking for it again."
"Overall a wonderfully hoppy summer ale that I wish Lagunitas would make all year 'round."
"Definitely a bit of a heavy hitter coming in a touch over 7%, but these are pretty easy drinking as far as the abv goes. The alcohol is definitely not pronounced here. Kick back, relax, and enjoy."
"D - Very deceiving brew, do not judge this beer after the first few sips, let it breathe for a little while and you will find that the flavors intensify. Overall a good beer, easy to drink and I am going to have another."
"Medium body, good carbonation. Alcohol is hidden well, this is one drinkable brew. I love the juicy hop aroma and flavor. Very nice."
"Pretty heavy for a ""Wheat Ale," but a nice long sippin' hoppy beer. I don't think this beats Maximus or IPA, but another solid entry that would be damn good on draft. Overall, I wish there was a bit more wheat character here. The abv might be nice a tad lower as well. Great choice of hops, but such recipes are getting easier and easier to pull off these days. Glad to try it."
"D. In a word - chugable. Crisp, refreshing and light bodied with no hint of alcohol to be found. Is this really 7.3% ABV? Drinks like a 4% - 5% beer. I've gotta grab another 6 pack while the weather is still warm. Nicely done."
"D: A good but very filling IPA. Alot going on flavor wise which is cool. You can tell it is 7.30%."
"D: I'm impressed, somewhat despite myself. Not a style I follow, and I generally stick to Lagunitas' strong ales. They did a great job with this one. It costs more than their IPA around here, but I'm willing to pay that. Please, sir, may I have some more?"
"Drinks great, easily the best American Wheat beer I've had, I believe, maybe off style a tad, but I don't care. This goes on the MUST buy list for Summer & Fall!"
"WOW!!! What a great find. Pours a dark straw color. Lots of bubbles and carbonation. Great aroma of Greapefruit but also ripe peaches and wheat. This is one of those beers that has combined two great styles into one. It has the nice little kick of hops from an IPA with the smooth thirst quenching hit of a wheat ale. Its like biting into a fresh piece of juicy fruit and grapefruit all at the same time!!! This is an outstanding example of craft beer."
"D - Thanks to the carbonation that hoppy/bitter aspects dont linger, which in this beer is a good thing as it leaves you wanting more. Alcohol is nicely masked. I had bought the last bottle, really wishing I had another."
"overall this was as solid as they come. really just a great example of the style and something i would do again in a minute."
"D - This is a great summer time IPA. Super smooth and nice bitterness. This is a favorite of mine and I am glad to hear that it's now been upgraded to a year round release. I will definitely be purchasing many sixers of this wonderful ale going forward!"
"D: I could drink this very often, and dare i say at less than $2/bottle i can see this replacing a greater known beer. I dont know if its sessionable since its rather high in alcohol, but i can easily sip this on a warm day and let it get away from me. I will definitely buy this again, especially since they are threatening this as a limited release. BOOO!"
"I liked this beer at the beer on-tap. appearance nice head and lacing in a pint glass. this beer is pretty amazing I was very impressed by it and drank two glasses. the taste is creamy and good feel to it. It is pretty drinkable the alcohol is well hidden."
"D-Very drinkable. More than one is certainly possible."
"D: As someone who enjoys citrus hops, this one was a great beer. I would and could certainly have multiple in a sitting despite the 7% ABV."
"D: Easy to drink and delicious. Not my first choice for a summer beer but it is damn good. I wish this wasn't my last bottle."
"Very drinkable, in fact I would like another after this one."
"Notes: This beer is fantastic, it has the lightness and crispness of a wheat, but the flavor profile of an IPA. Pick this limited release up."
"This beer has fifty percent wheat in the malt bill, but it's dry hopped like an IPA. This is a beer designed to let the hops shine through, and it does so beautifully. Delicious."
"D: this one drinks nice for a 7.4 % wheat beer. It comes off much more as an IPA than a pale wheat, but it is tasty either way."
"D: I'm bored by this, no suggestion of the wheat. Though it's very drinkable like all of Lagunitas' beers, if I were to have to blind taste test this against another hoppy Lagunitas beer I'm not sure that I could tell the difference. It's pretty much just like any other strong IPA."
"An easy drinker indeed. Pretty IPA like for an American pale wheat ale, but I still dig it."
"D-Drinks like a dream. The surprisingly high ABV is hidden masterfully. This is supposedly a wheat ale? More like a sassy IPA. Love it. I think, and have had agreeing conversations with peers that this beer is great for both the beer-pros and the newbies. If this was presented to me before I began to experiment with craft beer, this would have absolutely changed my life."
"Drinkability: Average to good. Simple flavors, a bit one dimensional, but good nonetheless. I like the tropical element to this beer."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side and carbonation is above average. Drinkability is very good, I loved the tropical citrus flavors the hops had. Excellent beer overall and one of my new summer favorites."
"pours a slight hazy copper color with spare head, spare lacing, and lively carb. fruity grapfruit smell, taste is much the same, very crisp and piney as well. light body, average flavor duration, and a slightly bitter finish. very crisp and refreshing. seems like a lot of lagunitas beers have a something very similar to them, and this one was no different,but still very good."
"D - Well I love Lagunitas but it seems only for their big beers. Their IPA doesn't seem hopped enough and this was just a hopped up pale ale. Pretty bland yet still love the company."
"D- A very well made beer and drinks rather nicely."
"D: Dangerously high. If I had discovered this masterpiece sooner slash if it had come to Portland sooner it would've been my summer session beer."
"D - I could down a few of these easily. Easy to drink and enjoy with just about any meal."
"Overall, wonderfully aromatic, balanced, snappy and tasty. Hard to stop at just one. A fine match for a cheeseburger with the works. One of my favorites from Lagunitas. Don't hesitate, buy that sixer! (or case) Truly an outstanding brew."
"D: An outstanding IPA. It's well-balanced but still packs a punch. Highly recommended."
"D - Wow... This is quite an awesome brew... Insanely quaffable... I couldn't put my glass down before wanting another sip..."
"Only downside is it reminds me very heavily of Wilco Tango Foxtrot. Except in appearance."
"Pours a mostly clear golden color with foamy two finger white head, blobs of lace. Smell: lots of pineapple and grapefruit, honeyed biscuit. Taste: pretty serious bash of grapefruit and pineapple, fades to a sweet pale malt with a hint of melon, maybe some wheat in the tangy finish. Mouthfeel: prickly, active carbonation but fairly light and refreshing. This would be the best pale wheat ever. Still pretty damn good as an IPA, would be 4/4.5/4.5/4/4."
"Imagine one of your favorite hoppy IPA's and a classic dry wheat beer having an offspring. Nicely crafted and mighty enjoyable."
"And I usually dont even like most Lagunitas offerings, well nix that - this is a slam dunk!"
"D: Very refreshing beer. Interesting combination of flavors. Nice for hot summer days. Would go well with picnic fare. Definitely would order this beer again."
"Taste is nothing spectacular like the name of the beer would suggest, but its still pretty darn good, particularly when compared against similar styles. Nice bit of fizz, light mouthfeel, its a good beer for summer. This is a nice drinkable beer, you would never expect the high abv. A good all around drink."
"Well done."
"Notes: This is a pretty bitter wheat beer, but definitely very drinkable. I was hoping it would taste a lot like Three Floyd's Gumballhead, but I was a little disappointed. It's much less fruity and tropical than Gumballhead, but good just the same."
"goes down rather well, but its very lagunitas styled. bitter, kind of sour, and resiny hop-forward. not too refreshing for a wheat beer, and not quite as tasty as an IPA/DIPA. not bad, though."
"Damn, I feel like I'm drinking an IPA, super hoppy! This is great for the summer, too bad it's not year-round. Lagunitas really really comes though with this one. Recommended to anybody."
"Drink is very good for the 7+ abv, doest feel this strong."
"Drinkability -- Wow, this was VERY strong in the hop department, somewhat to its disadvantage. A bit too one-note for me to go back to, but still not bad."
"Scoring this one to style is tough as it is categorized as a Wheat Ale here, but this has far more IPA characteristics than Wheat. However, since it is in this (perhaps wrong) category, its gonna score really high for me as I hate Wheats but love IPAs..."
"7.5% abv 64.20 I.B.U this Summer wheat ale is the best ive had in a long time. Easy drinker for the hop head in us all."
"D - IPA meets hefeweizen, very drinkable, very delicious, enjoy!"
"This morning I headed over to the store where I got this and bought two more sixes (of the three they had). Price was not on my mind (I think it was $10 or $11) I apologized for hoarding.They told me the last one I didn't buy is the last one they will have (it had just come in Thursday and that was all they will get). California is a long way from NE Ohio, and I may not see a Little Sumpin again for a while, but it sure is sumpin good."
"Tastes like the wonderful bastard child of IPA meets summer lager. Incredibly complex while remaining light enough to enjoy on a hot day by the pool. Beautiful combination of hops and malt. I don't do the citrusy-melon-tarball-bootheel-plum thing, but to me too many Lagunitas brews are ruined by an overpowering taste of burned sugar. Not this one. A real classic. Best Lagunitas I've tasted thus far."
"D- Lagunitas has impressed me again. I really appreciate what comes from Caly. I am going to go out on a limb and say that this is one of the most drinkable/tasty summer beers I have had. Although I do sense some confusion with the entire profile of the beer resembling an IPA... there is that slight spiced wheat presense that provides integrity of the brew. Just great"
"Very solid beer from Lagunitas."
"Overall I'm dissappointed in this brew, considering it's reputation. It's not even close to gumballhead in any aspects. Having said that, it has it's own pleasures. It warms nicely making it something to be enjoyed slowly."
"HV"
"Will definitely be drinking this one again - very tasty and one of my favorites from Lagunitas."
"Overall, a nice IPA. Some of the characteristics remind me of Gubna by OB, but it's more reserved."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a crisp yellow with a frothy off white head. Aroma is some crisp citrus hops and wheat with a touch of spice. The taste is more like a wheat beer than the bottle I had a few weeks ago, there is a decent amount of citrus hops as well making this a truly unique beer. The beer is medium bodied with slight alcohol presence, but it's drinkable. This is a truly unique beer, one I would certainly have again."
"Drinkability- Highly drinkable and enjoyable, a very good and unique beer with a beautiful use of hops to bring out bright vibrant flavor, alcohol is well integrated, very good beer i will be getting while i can get it"
"Blind -- it is drinkable. Good hoppy brew, but where the hell is everything else? Overdone. Likable, but over hopped. Still, worth trying, but I doubt I could do more than 2 without getting a little bored."
"D - Punchy but refreshing, an excellent summer brew. I had one on a very warm Sunday after church, and while the label may not call someone to seek after the mysteries of the divine, the taste definitely will."
"Poured into pint glass. Pours a nice clear golden color with thick white head, good retention and great lacing. Smell is of citric hops with some orange and lemon. Very much like a good West Coast IPA. Taste was similar. A dry wheat/straw taste at first followed by a citrusy hop kick on the back of the tongue. A velvety smooth mouthfeel with a slightly oily aftertaste. Overall a great beer and easy drinker. This almost could be confused for an IPA if you ask me."
"a light bodied easy sipper with the alcohol very well masked."
"Pours a light golden, almost pilsner-like appearance. Decent head and persistent lacing. Fairly hoppy aroma that I have come to expect from Lagunitas. This beer is pretty interesting because it is a wheat beer but has many characteristics of a hoppy pale ale. I get wheat beer on the front end with a bitter pale ale finish. This beer is a nice change from a typical summer beer, a good amount of hops but not over the top."
"Overall this is a beer I'd consider having again, however it wasn't one which left a memorable impression."
"I'm not tasting any wheat in here, though on their website Lagunitas coyly implies that there's only a slight wheat influence anyway. I'm grading this beer as something between an IPA and a DIPA; it's clear that the intention is to provide a nice, multifaceted hop treat to the drinker. It is successful."
"I had heard a lot about this beer last year, but it never made it out to Denver. This year it did. Poured a nice light golden/straw color, with a huge white head. Good piney hops dominate both the nose and palate, although the malt is there and it balances this one out nicely. Not sure its worth $10.99 a 6 pack though."
"Verdict: A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' is an enjoyable little beer; it's tasty, easily drinkable, and packs a hidden punch. As far as summer seasonals go, this is just what I'm looking for."
"d - A decent wheat ale with some nice citrus and orange in the smell and taste. Would try again."
"Drinks well enough."
"Very good value at about $7.50 for a six pack. Good flavor, above-average drinkability, I would probably buy another sixer of this in the future."
"I was hoping for more wheat and balance when drinking this beer. The hops aren't complex enough to warrant a high score for taste either."
"Pours a clear gold color, with a thick and frothy white head that retains well and leaves pretty lacing. The aroma is bursting with juicy hops (notes of citrus, pine, mango), along with wheat, honey, biscuit, caramel and a little rye. The flavor is similar to the aroma, with piney and citrusy hops upfront, along with mango and grapefruit, a wheaty twang, cane sugar, honey, biscuit, fruity esters and a little alcohol. The mouthfeel is light and bubbly, and drinkability is excellent. An excellent beer from Lagunitas, it's tasty and drinkable and is quite the bargain to boot."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Pours a nice clear golden with a fluffy white head. Excellent retention and very nice laceing.Aroma is of citrus,and piney hops.Body is medium and very carbonated. Taste is more like an IPA. Very hopped up front with a bit of a bready presence. Hoppy finish. Where's the wheat?"
"Nice beer."
"One of the most drinkable hoppy beers out there, I am blown away by how good this beer is."
"Awesome drinkability. So enjoyable to drink. Lagunitas knows how to hop things up and this is no exception. No problem tipping back a few of these, but at over seven percent, watch out."
"- Bit hot, and much like the undercover investigation shutdown ale.... what I think they should do is try brewing a different beer other than bottling one that didn't quite turn out the same as the last batch and calling it something different. Huge on hops... sugary sweet... and too much like the rest of their other offerings. Kind of lost on this one."
"D= I'm sold on this beer being my go to summer beer when I'm down on money a little. Lagunitas does some amazing things with hops. This is no exception. They do a great job with their pricing as well as making some of the most wonderful beers I've tasted. Better than Gumballhead I would say."
"Drinkability... nothing stood out for me. If I was in the mood for a wheat ale, I would not go for this one. I think it was on the fringes of the style. Not a bad beer overall. But compared to others in the same class, definitely non-traditional."
"D - This was a nice, bitter beer...I don't see why they want it classified as a pale wheat ale...this was more of an IPA to me...a nice beer for the summer or a hop fix"
"Reminds me of the first time I had Gumballhead. The comparison is hardly valid, but for an outside-the-norm Pale Wheat, hit it up."
"D: An absolutely fantastic summer beer and one of the best I've had from Lagunitas."
"Update: having been through cases upon cases of this, this is consistently great. A great head every time, fresh every time, great mouthfeel, perfectly carbonated. Nose not as good as gumballhead and the abv is a bit high for me, but otherwise great. This is the beer that turned my wife to the dark side and also her best friend. A great gateway beer."
"One time a year for it's release is too long to wait. I need my little sumpin' sumpin' fix. Great Beer! Good balance of hops and malt. Alcohol Content is perfect to make this a ""heavy"" session beer. Looking forward to summer to see this pretty lady again."
"D-Quite flavorful with pleasant orange and tangerine hp notes. Malt backing is present but doesn't get in the way. Nice job and a very nice drinking beer."
"Thoughts- This was my favorite new beer this summer, an wheat ale that bent the style lines just enough to make it unique and flavorly wonderful at the same time."
"Appearance looks like nothing special, in fact, it looks a little light and cloudy to be good, like a mass produced hefe. But the aroma starts to tip its hand, that this is a quality brew. And then, the taste, so strong, bitter, and then, bam, like I dunno, Stone IPA or Speakeasy IPA, it just is gone so crisp, like Outkast, so fresh and so clean. Very drinkable, light on the palate and yet so bitter and hoppy. I'm thinkin' crystal malt and simcoe hops all over this one."
"Poured a honey color, quite cloudy, with a small white colored head. Aroma was easily detectable, but not overpowering and consisted of a sweet orange and grapefruit combination. Very inviting. Taste follows the nose with a sweet rather than tart citrus (mandarin orange and grapefruit) bitterness on a barely detectable crystal malt backbone ending in a slightly dry finish. A bit warming as well. Mouthfeel was smooth with a light-medium body. Overall, although this offering is not overly complex, I wish this wasn't a limited edition as I really enjoyed this one. Could easily drink several of these and went back to the store to get the last bottle."
"I could put down quite a few but I'd pay the price the next morning."
"Notes: very flavorful beer. has a dry- and wet-hopped combo going on. aroma and flavor is fantastic. probly my favorite beer from them. would not have guessed this had anything to do with the wheat category"
"Clear enough to read through the glass. Single finger head, but it relaxes slowly. The color is neutral amber. Lots of classic pine needle hop aroma--like an IPA. The flavor matches the aroma. Noteworthy alcohol feel and flavor. Lots of hop bite almost from the beginning. The body is rich and gives an element of rounded malt tastes. I don't really note any wheat in this one, but it's still a very good pale ale."
"D- I don't care if this has an abv of 7.3%, I have no problem drinking a 6 pack in a sitting. One of my favorites this summer without a doubt."
"On-tap at the Spinnerstown Hotel. $4 for a tulip, not a bad deal. It appeared hazy yellow with a tall white head. The aroma reminds me immediately of orange soda, but then pineapple kicks in to make it more of a tropical citrus fruit punch. The flavor is equally juicy at first, but they dries out with a bit of plain malted wheat and peppery hop bitterness. This beer reminds me of the short-lived Middle Ages Imperial Double Wheat - it's big, hoppy, but not terribly bitter. All in all, a pretty tasty beer."
"D: Great. My favorite from LBC so far. Easy drinking but full flavored. Keeps enticing me back for more. I'd order another and buy a sixer again."
"D - I generally don't like wheat beers. Love this one. Very balanced. Can't believe it's 7.3%. Well Hidden."
"Was sort of hoping for more of a pale wheat ale like it was supposed to be, and less of an IPA. Because if you didn't tell me what it was, that's what I would have guessed. Too bad Lagunita's couldn't lay off the hops a little, but I guess that's what they do. Still a good beer though."
"It appears as though the folks at Lagunitas have stumbled upon this hop profile that they are now using to hop the hell out of a fairly basic pale wheat. Not sure if I dislike it or love it."
"Tastes more like an IPA, akin to maybe DFH 90 minute - hop forward with a malty background."
"Without a shadow of a doubt, my beer of the year for 2009. Loved it when it was totally fresh, love it as it gets a bit older. Very unique taste up front and that great Lagunitas hop onslaught on the back end, balanced but just a nice amount of sweetness. Hard to believe the ABV is over 7% on this masterpiece. Juicy greatness and just a true joy to drink over and over. Glorious."
"Drinkability: Although this isn't what I expected, this is a very tasty brew. I will absolutely pick this one up again next time I see it."
"It's downright drinkable, and if it wasn't for the abv, I'd tear through a sixer of this in no time at all."
"Go Phils"
"D - Drinks like a session beer but will kick your ass at 7.7%."
"D: Drinkability was good but not mind blowing. This is definitely not a session type beer but it does get progressively easier. Interesting yes. A little sumpin offers something off the beaten path in the way of hoppy wheats which drank like a amped up southern tier 422."
"D-I love drinking this smooth beer. There is no fusal alcohol at all to this beer. A very drinkable beer given the higher abv. Thank you Lagunitas. Go get some Little Sumpin Extra Ale, it is very good."
"D - Easily drinkable. This is solid Lagunitas & worth a shot."
"Knowing that it was more hoptastic than most APWAs, I had a pretty good idea that this would be good beer. Truth be told, it's hoppier, more delicious and more drinkable than imagined. If you crave the little green cones like I do, A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale joins Three Floyds Gumballhead on the top of the American pale wheat ale pile. Thanks to mikey711 for the bottle."
"M/D: Sticky and resinous without being over carbonated, the texture is perfect. I would drink this every time I barbecued if I had it on hand."
"D- Found this to be hard to finish, not usually my MO. Wouldn't have it again"
"Cheers!"
"Clear, dark yellow, strong hop aroma, dense head, fall away as you drink and leaves lacing (although I don't consider that important some on this site do). Sweet malt, hop bitterness and alcohol in aroma. This is a warming beer. The bitterness is the first thing I notice when I drink it. Second, a brightness associated with high alcohol beers. The alcohol is noticable, not bad, just noticable. Bitterness also builds as you drink. I'm very pleased with this beer. A good IPA."
"D: The aroma is the highmark for this beer. The taste has a slightly off bitterness to it that diminishes an other wise nice lemon-wheat flavor. Again this beer smells and looks like it should be a nice refreshing brew, but alas it falls short."
"Body is medium bodied, as is the carbonation. A slightly more vigorous carbonation would be appreciated. Drinkability is a bit of a conundrum. Served fresh this is a quenching hop-monster for the style, however I'm not sure a 7.3% abv is necessary. I like my pale wheats to be sessionable and boy do I want to down a sixer of this in a hurry. That, however, is not recommended. All together, this a well put together ale, certainly in the west coast tradition of brilliant hops, but could use some work. Recommended for hop heads who are hesitant to sample wheat beers."
"This quickly became one of my go-to beers for the summer. Upon my last haul, I was sad to see it had disappeared off the shelves at all the stores around town."
"D: Finish is a bit to mediciol for my tastes in a pale wheat ale, just too much hops here I think but otherwise a well executed beer. Worth a shot our of curiosity for what could be considered an imperial pale wheat ale."
"D - This is easily my new favorite offering from Lagunitas! This is a really citrus-forward brew with fresh grapefruit out the wazoo, almost like Ballast Point Dorado without the alcohol presence. Awesome!"
"D: This is a great beer. Definitely a summer beer, but for the hop lover. I hear there is a lil sumpin extra coming out. I can't wait. In the meantime, I'll be drinking this."
"D: A fantastic balance between Summer Wheat and IPA, an excellent brew. Well this was quite a first experience with Lagunitas and one that will ensure I'm back for more. The best Pale Wheat Ale I've had yet, a wonderful experience. If you're looking for something unique and refreshing but with a bit of bite and body, go with this brew!"
"I can't believe this is a wheat. It is full of Hops, and reminds me of an IPA which I like very much. Worth searching out. It pours with a small head that leaves nice lacing as you finish. It has a nice bronze color, has a nice peppery IPA smell. The hops jumps right out at you and stays with you till the end. Very good effort."
"I just wasn't feeling this beer. It's definitely not a wheat beer, and it's not even that good of an IPA."
"I had pretty high hopes for this beer, and I was a bit disappointed. I definetly prefer Southern Tier Uber Sun and Three Floyds Gumballhead, but this is a decent summer offering and is worth checking out."
"D - Such a nice beer. Would like to see it in bottle!"
"Overall, I think this is my favorite beer from Lagunitas. I have been mixed on them in the past, thinking some are great and other fall short of expectations. This beer exceeded what I was expecting."
"O - Awesome beer. I don't know if I would be insulting anybody by saying this but its like a light DIPA. I'm going to keep this in the fridge as long as its around."
"Medium bodied. Less carbonation than I'm used to for a wheat, but it doesn't detract from the mouthfeel. 7.3% ABV is completely masked."
"This was at a beer bar and no one at the place knew what kind of style it was. I tried a small glass and wasn't able to tell myself. After reading that it's an American Wheat it makes sense. This is an ok beer but a little strong to have the typical advantages of a wheat; refeshing, etc. Good color, carbonation and smell. A little short on taste and mouthfeel. Worth a try but there are better ones out there."
"not quite a session brew, keeping 7.3% in mind, but it won't spoil your dinner"
"Drinkability: A dangerous brew. Very easy to drink and the high ABV will knock tour socks off"
"Big floral hop taste that turns into grapefruit and ends bittersweet. The more I drink it the better it seems to show all its flavors. The mouthfeel is good. I love the combonation of wheat and hops like this. A good reminder that I need to keep trying with hop heavy styles."
"D - This isn't a bad beer just a hybrid style that I think is a bad idea wheat beers are light and drinkable hop the shit out of it and that brings it down"
"Overall this is by no means a traditional wheat beer, however like most of Lagunitas brews the hops are a nice addition. This is worth a shot."
"D - Rates only a ""Good"" simply because I think I was looking for something lighter as a Summer Seasonal. With that said. I love it. I will buy a 6-pack tomorrow. And another next week. This might take 1st place in my Lagunitas line-up, behind my favorite, Brown Shugga."
"Pours a pretty hazy golden amber, very huge and thick white head forms, slowly settles leaving a shit ton of lace on the glass, very thick layer, looks pretty great. Smell is alright, wheat and amarillo kick, orange peel, quite floral, yeasty, some light fruit, touch of honey and biscuity malt, found the aroma a little messy, but alright. Taste is similar, lots of wheat character, yeast, lots of citrus, honey sweetness through the middle, lightly spicy, orange, some floral, decent bitterness. Mouthfeel is a touch thin, light bodied with medium to high carbonation, refreshing. Not too bad but a little let down."
"Well then, this stuff is straight out of left field, and a wonderful surprise, it's got it all in the right places at the right time, even though I really had no idea what to expect in advance. I'm going to have to pick up more to hang on to if this is a limited edition. Even the girl on the label is pure retro pin-up cheesecake kitschy bliss. Somehow this beer manages to cater to all of my guilty pleasures, yet with enough quality to abolish any guilt whatsoever."
"Overall, reminds me of a Gumballhead, which is a good thing."
"If anything, better in the bottle, as wheat beers sometimes are. Great beer, and a homerun for Lagunitas. Much, much hoppier than the average wheat, but the hops wotk here combined with the slightly sweet fruitiness of the wheat and yeasty esters. Pours golden with a relatively thin head and excellent clarity. Smells hoppy, tangy, and slightly sweet with notes of bubblegum and citrus. Highly herbal, with some of the same dill notes I've picked up in a few other West Coast hoppy beers recently (with Exponential Hoppiness being the king of that flavor). I wonder which hop or combination of hops are giving me that taste? Regardless, I really like the effect- particularly with the tanginess of the wheat and the fruity sweetness of the yeast. I love the taste of this. Tangy and herbal, piney and citrusy, and fruity all together. Extremely smooth, followed by a spritzy finish. Mu summer beer of choice for 2009."
"Pours a very nice clean/clear golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice little one-finger foamy white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy, with some malts, citrus, and piney. The taste is slightly sweet, hoppy, malty, with some nice citrus/pine notes. Medium body. Drinkable, a very tasty brew, way to go Lagunitas, thanks Ben and Chuck."
"Overall, I was pleased with the Little Sumpin' Sumpin' after fearing I had missed it this season. Another great beer from a great brewery."
"D - Very drinkable, the hops in both the flavor and in the nose remind me of a toned down Hop Stupid. It is well balanced as it has a pretty strong dose of malt and most of the hop character is devoted to flavor and aroma rather than bitterness. One of Lagunitas best."
"The mouth was pleasantly oily and coating. Very easy to drink. I had three with my BBQ. I also did not realize it had a relatively high ABV until looking on BA. I guess that may explain my slightly hazy recollection of the Cubs game (or it could have been the additional 5 or so Old Styles...) Cubs won 12-0 & I think I won with this beer!"
"Light haze in a glowing golden orange body. Cottony, gauze-like, off-white head. Nose shows a lot of citrus character. Juicy orange and grapefruits mix with sappy pine. Sugary cookie malt underneath with a wheat-y twang. Taste starts off with light toasted wheat notes and citrus-y hop bitterness. Sugary fruits follow, accompanied by more juicy (and piny) hop flavor. Bitterness swells. Finishes hoppy, but with a yeasty-wheat-fruit base that makes for an interesting palate. Soft, medium-full body with a protein-y wheat feel. Goes down very easily. Another great Lagunitas concoction!"
"Drinkability: Wouldn't have guessed 7%. I'm drinking this fast."
"Had this as part of a tasting session with a buddy a while back. Poured a bronze color with white head that faded slowly and left decent lacing. Smelled of pine hops and malt. Tasted of pine hops, malt, and citrusy fruit. Quite smooth, just slightly dry. Would have been nice to have a few more of these."
"M/D this drinks and feels like a lighter IPA with some really interesting smells to it. I could drink a whole bunch of these"
"D- This beer is soft on the bitterness which is good but it is huge on the pungency of the hops. They are well supported by pineapple and grass flavors but it is a pretty big beer for a full pint of it."
"Tap @ The Local. Didn't know what to expect, first ""American Pale Wheat Ale," and, its a lot like an IPA. At least this one was. Poured clear copper with a short white head. Solid lacing. Fresh, citrus aroma, lots of hops. Peppery and spicy as well. No wheat. Light, clean mouthfeel with a dry finish. Very refreshing. Clean, bitter hops up front that rapidly shifts to the citrus. Lemon zest, tart oranges, grapefruit. Mellow finish without being soapy. Again, no wheat. Overall, a nice beer, drinks like a smooth, tart West-Coast IPA. Difference is all the hops with a lighter body."
"At 7%, not too strong, but still big enough to make it much more interesting than the average wheat ale. I'll keep reaching for this until it disappears."
"The mouth is crisp and bubbly. Flavor is citrus with some bitter grapefruit notes melded with sweet orange flavor. Finishes slightly sweet with some sugary malts. This is a wheat ale? Blind-tasting this, I would guess it's a red or an india pale. I like this alot, but I wouldn't ever think this was a wheat. I like what they artfully did with the style though. Recommend."
"D: This is a fantastic summer brew. To me, this redefines what American Pale wheat Ales are all about. Bold flavors, high ABV, amd exceptional drinkability. I've never been a huge fan of Lagunitas, but this beer may change my opinion."
"D- For the summertime, I could drink several either by myself or with friends!"
"Poured with a small, off-white head that diminished quickly to a thin film. Body was mostly clear with some haziness, with a nice, dark-orange color. Fantastic aroma... hops, with some citrus and wheat in there as well. Medium-body on the palate; thin, but with some slight creaminess to it as well. Average carbonation and a bitter finish. Great flavor - citrus and a small amount of wheat at first, then a very bitter aftertaste that is long-lasting. A great wheat ale / IPA... whatever the official designation may be."
"A Little Sumpin' Sumpin'Ale pours a copper color with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a fairly strong hop aroma and I can pick up some caramel malt. The flavor is pretty hoppy with some citrus like notes and I can taste crystal malt and a decent amount of caramel malt. The alcohol is pretty well hidden."
"I'm gonna be perfectly honest- having this on tap I didn't even realize it was a wheat. That was quite surprising to read on here. Just an incredibly hopped up wheat beer here. The pour is golden/orange in color with a nice white head that settles well. The nose on this brew from Lagunitas is enjoyable--lots of citrus and grapefruit right up front. I don't get any wheat here or wheat in the mouth either--so it's almost awkward. But again, the taste is heavily hopped flavors: grapefruit, citrus, lemon rind maybe if i really stretch it. The mouth feel is medium and well carbonated. This beer lacks balance and isn't what I would describe as smooth but there's still something about it that keeps me sessioning this beer all night."
"This is one hopped-up wheat ""summer"" beer. And a nice one at that!"
"Notes: more like a California APA in many ways -- big juicy hops in the nose, for example, a clear body and the 7+% ABV -- but I do think there's something spicy that makes this more of a hybrid with the wheat ale style. Interesting, that's for sure."
"Notes: It reminds me of other Lagunitas beers, Brown Shugga and even Hairy Eyeball share some traits with this beer."
"The flavor matches the aroma. Noteworthy alcohol feel and flavor. Lots of hop bite almost from the beginning. The body is rich and gives an element of rounded malt tastes. I don't really note any wheat in this one, but it's still a very good pale ale."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. I had heard this had some sort of wheat component but to be honest it tasted a lot like Hop Stoopid and Correction Ale. Bright orange color, great head, and an aroma of juicy hop resin. The taste is citrusy and the mouthfeel is really the big difference between this and Correction Ale, this feels thicker. This was way to easy to drink and for the price I paid ($10.50 per sixer) it was worth it. Cheers to Lagunitas for producing seriously hoppy beers that don't break my wallet."
"This is pretty tasty stuff. Quite a hoppy APWA, and although it's a bit out of balance it's still quite tasty."
"Where the hell did this beer come from? Not only my pick for sleeper beer of the summer, this is my early favorite for sleeper pick of the year! Just HUGELY well balanced West Coast hop character here, that is beautifully packaged into an equally great quaffable Wheat Ale body. I agree with some other reviewers that this is one Lagunitas beer that should have been in bombers, as 12 oz just isn't enough for one sitting. There's definitely nothing Little about this ""Sumpin'"". Great stuff!"
"Good two plus finger head extends right up to the pint glass rims, dense foam with interspersed big popping bubbles, slides right down the sides so minimal lacing until the glass is half empty. Ever so slight gauziness to the orange copper color, has more of a brown tinge than yellow or red, depth of hue retained throughout. The nose sparkles with sweet tangerine to pink grapefruit citrus, golden honey and pine sap, generous floral dew, the grains smell like sweetened breakfast cereal more than something in a farm silo, apricot and nectarine fruit scents lend further depth. Full-bodied, layers itself thickly onto the tongue, luckily has a consistent carbonated fizz to create as much prickle as grip. No duh, the tangerine and pink grapefruit citrus continues to hog the stage while other hops inspired flavors such as pine, flowers and tea leaf don't do too shabbily for themselves. More honey than cocoa or malty chocolate powder, however, is not really biting and dang smooth given the predominance of the hops. Some biscuit softness. Resiny finish prolongs finish for some time."
"Drinkability: A unique and fun limited release from Lagunitas. A bit ""big"" all around for a summer ale. I would have enjoyed this more if the gravity was toned down so that I could enjoy on a hot summer day. Does not quench the thirst with a crispness as I would desire. Still a great beer that everyone should enjoy."
"Served: in an imperial pint glass."
"D- Not being a big fan of APWA, I was surprised by this one, it was not what I was expecting. Bold and assertive, yet insanely drinkable. It's not sessionable but I would not mind trying to knock down a six of it on the weekend. IMO, this is an IPA with APWA qualities. My favorite in this style to date."
"This is one heck of an IPA and one of my very favorite offerings from Lagunitas. The hops are wonderful, and even though it's rich and potent, it's still easy to throw back a few of these. Very well done IPA. Highly recommended. Reminds me of 3F Gumballhead...another great hoppy wheat IPA."
"D - Very easy drinker. Would be great on a sunny, hot day."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"D: Easy drinking beer, the light mouthfeel of a wheat beer mixed with the flavors of an IPA really make this is a great beer to drink, even at over 7. Incredibly sessionable for the booze. I wish I could have gotten more. Excellent inventive beer in a ridiculously boring style."
"This beer poured a light copper color with a single-finger head and some visible carbonation. The smell is a mix of different citruses including lemon and grapefruit. The taste is almost like biting into a grapefruit without taking all of the peel off first. A sweet and tart start with a bit of bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some crisp carbonation. This is a pretty drinkable little beer, and definitely worth grabbing while you an."
"standard pint at Taphouse on Queensway, Hampton, VA"
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, a great combination of of IPA and wheat beers."
"D: I liked this ale from Lagunitas a lot, I'm glad I finally got to try it, I just hope I can find a bottle around here. Clean, refreshing, would make a great summertime beer, cliche I know, but it's the truth."
"Extremely drinkable beer, especially on a hot day (like when I tried it on tap yesterday...delicious)."
"Drinkability: To be honest, this one quietly slipped in under the radar as I hadn't heard so much as a peep about it before coming across it at the Brick Store Pub recently. A pleasant surprise and a pleasant combination of wheat and India Pale Ale qualities. Nice job, Lagunitas."
"12 ounce bottle, pours hazed, Lighter amber, on the yellowy side, frothy off white head, retentive powers in evience, ample stick, ringed and spotty on the sides of the inner glass. Nose is boldly of juicy citrus and grainy HOPS. Bold full flavor APWA, on the way hoppy side and I like it, yes I do. More grapefruit, more resiny dryness, long dry and hop infused finish. If you like Hops and you like wheat beer...this is gonna be a hit..Very enjoyable ""summer beer""..hope this is not too much of a ""limited release"""
"Notes - The mouthfeel was good and had that hop film that you may or may not like."
"Huge American wheat for you hop lovers out there, i know I enjoyed it and will again. Alas, if all wheat beers were this good, I wouldn't wish the cooler weren't so clogged with them this time of year. 7.3% could be dangerous."
"This is a very good beer. It's the sort of thing that if it were only available in bombers and hyped up it would have an even bigger following. However, not sure everyone will love it, especially if they're looking for more of a wheat beer. The scores would probably be lower if I stuck strictly to category, but this beer is too good to downgrade based on names. I'll be picking up some more of it."
"A clear yellow amber color with a firm and full white head and fair lacing. The aroma is lemony hops and honey and other fruit and floral nuances, very pleasant. The taste brings a curious blend of piney citrous hops mixed with caramel cracker and floral qualities for a bit of bite. The feel is medium with generous but with subtle carbonation that is very drinkable. Another great hop option from the masters at Lagunitas. Nice!"
"D and overall impression: I could drink a shit ton of this out on the lake on a hot summer day. The ABV is hidden and this one is a thirst quencher. Overall, I am really impressed with this beer. We need to see more of these hoppy wheat beers. Skal."
"This beer is surprisingly easy to drink. The flowers are not as bad as the fraoch heather beer which is good thing."
"Pours a hazy dark gold with a huge, frothy, sticky eggshell head that does not seem to reduce. The smell is a grapefruit bomb -- like sticking your nose into a huge vat of fresh-squeezed ruby red. Delicious but not a lot else present there. Very hoppy brew -- mostly cascades -- big grapefruit presence like in the aroma. But overbalanced by an enormously sweet maltiness -- perhaps too sweet. Not very wheaty. And though it has wheat, it's much more akin to a DIPA than a ""Pale Wheat Ale."" Mouthfeel is somewhat chewy with a good spritely tingle at the end. A little too cloyingly sweet and a little too big to session. Overall a good beer."
"The body is surprisingly thick for the style (whichever it is) and the carbonation tickles the mouth in the most pleasant of ways. Very drinkable for me. Yum yum in my tum tum. I am always amazed at Lagunitas's ability to deliver great beers (especially IPA-ish ones, IMO) at a reasonable cost. Bravo!"
"This is a really nice session wheat. Very easy to drink with lots of flavor."
"Strong citrus aroma but a big pine flavor. I agree with the previous review that this is not like other wheat beers. The wheat gives this a very earthy and bready flavor along with the obvious pale ale attributes. Very nice combination. Very drinkable, I wish I had bought more than 2 bottles."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer to say the least. I am glad I got a couple of bottles of this in a trade. The sad thing is I already drank the two I got. If I could get this in my state I would drink this all the time. Too bad like most beers I enjoy a lot I can't get it. Very good beer!"
"Pretty good beer overall, wouldn't mind having again, not blown away as I first thought I would but hard to beat for the price."
"12 ounce bottle purchased from Beverage Warehouse in Marina Del Rey as a single for two dollars, poured into a Lost Coast pint glass, color is golden yellow with some orange, 3/4 inch ceamy white head with decent retention and leaving some small amounts of lacing, aroma consists of wheat, lots of citrus including grapefruit, floral accents, pine, herbal accents, and , flavor is full of hops at first which is really not true to style but I am not complaining, some citrus and very mild wheat in the middle, finish has a large amount of hoppiness and citrus too, some lingering pine in the aftertaste, nicely balanced between fruit and hops, dry, citrusy and slightly chewy mouthfeel, moderatate level of carbonation, medium bodied, could drink a few of these, taste is complex for the style, no alcohol in the flavor, pretty refreshing when served cold and balanced, definitely not your ordinary wheat beer, love the amount of hops in this beer, would drink again, hope this is brewed again"
"Overall definitely the best lagunitas ive had in a while. Im not terribly amazed with it, but its a nice IPAish kind of thing, and i could easily put a couple away. A well crafted, and very well balanced beer, and one i will probably re visit with lethargic and intermittent regularity (or lack thereof). A well made...hoppy beer..."
"A good, unique beer that is well made. However, it did not live up to hype for me. Probably wouldn't buy again since I like other Lagunitas offerings much better."
"D- Wow, this is one hoppy Pale Wheat! Feels like an IPA with a smidge of yeast and wheat flavor. Well done."
"This beer pours a golden straw color with only a slight haze, kind of surprising since this is a wheat beer. Had a nice head that fades into a wispy ring. The nose is mostly hops. Lovely piney and citrusy hops dominates while some sweet malts linger in the background. Taste just like the nose suggest. First its citrus and piney hops followed by a nice light malt flavor then a nice floral hoppy bitterness to wash it all down. Very nice. I'm not picking up on very many typicaly wheat beer flavors, I'm guessing they just wanted a nice light malt base to let those beautiful hop flavors and aromas to shine through. Nice mouthfeel and nice body, Not to heavy or thin. Perfect for a hot summer day."
"12 oz. Golden/orange pour. Small white head. Aroma is floral, citrus, piney hop. Taste is a good blend. The wheat gives a nice light-medium body. Flavor has the hop pine, but balanced with the wheat, similar to some rye pales I've had. Accents of citrus, apple, pear. Finish clean, refreshing. Nice for Lagunitas to make something other than a hop bomb."
"This beer pours a clear light gold color with a two finger foamy white head. I was surprised by the lack of haze given that this is a wheat ale. The nose is outstanding. Really though - it's most reminiscent of an IPA to me - pine and grapefruit citrus are the most predominant. There is a touch of malt backbone detectable. Taste is very high on citrus with touch of piney bite up front, lending to a nice sweet malt, touch of honey flavoring possibly, and then comes back with more citrus hop flavoring. The is a well concocted brew but much more IPA driven then a Pale Wheat. Even with that being said, it's downright tasty and perfect for the summer. Light to medium body, medium carbonation, crisp, clean feel, goes down easy, alcohol is not even remotely detectable. This is a great, but dangerous beer as I can see myself kicking back on a hot summers day with them."
"Notes: This is a good session beer for 7.3% ABV, especially for a hophead! Although, as others have said, it drinks more like a very hoppy APA. Can't go wrong with a nicely balanced, hopped-up, bone-dry beer from Lagunitas to get you through these blistering summer days!!!"
"D- This is right up there as one of my favorite Lagunitas beers. It's in credibly easy to drink and the hops while big on flavor don't trounce the palate."
"drinkability: very easy and smooth. As always a great value by Lagunitas. This is one of my favorite beers on the market right now."
"Overall I find this to be a nice beer that I'm not sure where it fits in the big picture. Perhaps a different yeast to add some more flavors? Worth seeking out."
"Drinkability- This was really good. Excellent. Definitely worth the ten bucks for a six pack"
"On tap at Cole's. Surprising light colour for a hopped up beer. The hop aroma is certainly there. Good lace. Taste of moderate grapefuit. Big mouthfeel. Served too cold, a rare brainfreeze from beer. Above-average carbonation. Drying finish, with a mint-spice aftertaste. IBU must be high."
"Drinkability? Not that good. Between the abv and the overall bitter factor, this will be a beer that I'll finish very slowly and I have no plans on buying any more. Others seem to like it...it's just not for me."
"Poured into a large wine glass. Nice dark peach color with a smallish one finger head, that soon will turn to mainly a white ring with some light white lilly pads on top of the beers body. It smells mainly like a typical wheat ale with some faint hops. However, upon taking a sip, it tastes more of those aformentioned hops while still maintaining the characteristics of a wheat ale, and some brown sugar there too. It tastes very good and is unique. The mouthfeel is a bit dry, a bit sweet, but leaves your palate eager to have some more of this Little Sumpin` from Lagunitas. This beer exceeded my expectations."
"Drinkability: Like many, I agree that this is more of an IPA than a wheat beer, but with the hoppiness and softness from the wheat, it's a wild combination. Possibly a bit fruitier than Uber Sun, but it's on par with it. Pretty much a perfect summer brew all around, and now I know what everyone's been talking about."
"D: Very drinkable, even with the higher abv. This is an interesting take on the style for sure, but I have a feeling this is one of those beers they brewed and then selected the style that fits it best. Either way, I liked this beer a whole lot!"
"D: Very drinkable. At $2 a bottle, this is a steal as well. I'm drinking more of this over the next few months."
"Edit: after having a couple more of these. I've noticed great variation in flavors. Particularly in that the first few bottles lacked any hints of wheat. Other bottles (from separate package and store) had much more pronounced wheat flavors. Not sure if others have noticed this."
"D: This is a good beer with an interesting range of flavors. I'll admit I'm a bit biased as my preference is for hopped up IPA's and this is a wheat beer that is hopped up good. Not sure it's so accurate for the style, but I like it, though next time I'll do my best to drink it while it's still cold."
"Overall my first Lagunitas and I am VERY impressed, looking for more in the future!"
"There is a touch of harsh hop flavors but overall this is still very pleasant to drink."
"This poured a clear gold with moderate white head. It smelled like orange and pineapple hops with some copper and honey and fresh wheat. It tasted like lemon zest and orange peel, with pineapple and nectarine balanced by fresh wheat and bready yeast, and a bit of metallic copper. It was somewhat thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was surprisingly succulent and hoppy. It had nice body, hid the alcohol pretty well, and was easy to drink. I loved the flavor, but it was much more like Hop Stoopid or Correction Ale than a wheat beer. Since I prefer the IPA's, that was enjoyable for me, but it didn't really seem accurate for the style. Does that make this beer good or bad?? Either way, it's very tasty and refreshing for the summer."
"This stuff beats Oberon with a stick!"
"Well this beer has been a pleasant suprise! Truly outstanding. I'll have to give other wheat beers a chance if they can taste like this. There is no banana clove flavors at all, just a creamy, hoppy masterpiece"
"Taste follows suit, with grapefruit bursting out in front of the pack. The citrusy twang of the hops are offset by a slightly tart and sweet yet rich finishing malt backbone. I just glanced the 7.3% abv on this, and I'm shocked. The medium carbonation and excellent balance make this beer dangerously quaffable."
"i could have a few of these.honestly i wasnt expecting much from this beer,but it's an awesome summer offering from lagunitas."
"Poured a medium and slightly hazy golden color with an averaged sized white head. Aromas of juicy oranges, pine and floral hops. Tastes of citrus, floral hoppiness, some toasted graininess, and a lighter sweet caramel in the finish."
"D- an interesting take on an american pale wheat ale. enjoyable and easy to finish, i found myself reaching for a second without much thought. check this one out."
"Overall this is a fine beer, especially for hopheads."
"Feels smooth and has a nice amount of bitey carbonation. This is by far my favorite wheat of any style."
"d: highly drinkable with a nice balance all around"
" Lagunitas' seasonal offering reflects genuine ingenuity, style and a touch of madness. I don't understand how you could classify Sumpin' as an American Pale Wheat Ale because Sumpin' positions itself in a category of it's own (come on, Oberon and this are light years apart). I don’t often review many beers unless they deserve it and I can't wait to try A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' on Tap, which I know should be very soon."
"No real complaints on this one at all. It's a re-buy and a must-buy."
"D - I could have a few, but I'd be more inclined to go with an IPA or a good German wheat than this for a second drink. I was looking forward to trying this, but I was a lot more impressed with their IPA and Maximus. This is interesting, and I can appreciate it, but I wouldn't really go out of my way for it."
"Drinkability: This is definitely a very drinkable brew. I could easily have had 2-3 more. However, the alcohol is so well hidden you don't realize just how high the abv actually is. I will definitely be putting this one on my wheat beer shopping list, probably by the case"
"Heard a lot of great things about this beer, and being one of my fav breweries I was excited to try this one. Pours a semi see-thru orange, good head with a moderate amount of lacing. Not too much there for aroma, but time for the important part.. the taste. Wicked smooth beer... just nice and creamy with a nice hop kick to it, although it is a tad bit subdued. Nice and balanced and way too drinking for 7.3% ABV... and this is a pale wheat ale??? damn, they're doing something at this brewery right because this is downright delicious. I agree with a past reviewer that this tastes like a Hop Stoopid light... great description, hoppy but still has the nice easy goingness of a wheat/cream ale... great beer."
"D: Heavens yes this is drinkable, I will be picking this one up again. Lagunitas is quickly becoming my favorite brewery due to quality of the brews and the price too."
"This is an all around excellent drinking and food beer."
"Fun name, fun label. I like Lagunitas more and more all the time. Upon pouring, it appears a slightly hazy gold with a huge meringue-like head that for a few moments sat higher than the rim of my glass. Immediately, lots of piney and citrusy hops in the aroma, and a touch of banana. While quite bitter, the flavor is balanced by sweet malt, almost honey-like, but the hops never stop asserting themselves. There's also some tangy orange/tangerine. Searching for wheat, I failed. Perhaps it keeps the body on the lighter end of medium, but it's not even on the label where ingredients are listed. Anyhoo,the carbonation is gentle and the hops give the mouthfeel slickness. As with some other Lagunitas brews, I find the aroma to be its best characteristic, but it's also quite drinkable. Light, but packed full of hoppy flavor. I could go for another."
"Sumpin sumpim pours out a clear bright shiny golden lemon with a decent amount of head. Smells piney, fruity, hoppy, and perfumey. Big oily hop taste as well as some citric zest and a colossal bitter aftertaste. Light mouthfeel with balanced carbonation. A solid brew."
"Nice two fingers of head that slowly recedes to sticky film of foam. Nice lacing on the inside of the glass. Light, clear amber and honey color with good bubbling. Lots of hoppy mellow citrus aromas. Resiny bitter palate pushes too much of the sweet wheat and fruity yeast away. Interestng combination of flavors, bitter and wheaty, but isn't my cup of tea all the way. Good resiny that coats the tongue nicely. More like an IPA in my opinion than an American pale wheat ale."
"Drinkability is great, but this is a strange brew. Hop burps are plentiful but it's such a weird experience I'm getting from this hop-centric brew. Hoppier than Gumballhead or Southern Tier Hop Sun, but it's so different from those two. There's no question about their wheat ale tones. If given to me blind I couldn't tell you this has wheat ale written all over it."
"Another interesting concoction from Lagunitas. A pale wheat for hopheads, what else? Recommended."
"very nice brew overall."
"D: A much better take on the Pale Wheat Ale than the usual ""hefeweizen"" that American breweries make. The hoppiness really makes this a great refreshing brew."
"d.64.2 ibu's, 7.3% alc., gota sixer, rare where i live but definitly a drinkable brew!"
"D: Bitter and piney but not tongue-burning, and sweet but not cloying, this is a balanced and refreshing beer. I went through two bottles quickly, and found myself wondering if this would be even more sterling right from the tap."
"D: I could drink this stuff all day but you have to give your mouth a break!"
"This beer has a nice straw gold color, with a small initial head. The aroma is full of citrusy hops, strong and pleasant. The flavor, basically, is the same: fairly bitter with a huge hoppy flavor, citrus and grassy. If there's any wheat malt flavor, I can't detect it. It's very drinkable, but really, there's little different between this and another 5 or 6 Lagunitas heavily-hopped beers. It's a well-crafted hoppy beer, but it's nothing new or interesting."
"A stubby 12 ounce twist off bottle purchased at the Beer Stop for $2. The ale appears a super clear golden yellow color with about two fingers of dense, lingering bone white foam. Notes of lemon zest, orange, grapefruit, fruity floral hops, lightly toasted wheat and grain, pine. Pleasantly bitter in the finish and just where is that 7%+ alcohol hiding? Medium in both body and carbonation. This will be a warm weather staple in my house as long as it's available. Another winner for lah-goo-knee-tuss."
"D- This is a very good Pale Wheat Ale that is similar to hop sun, uber sun, and gumballhead. What I like a lot about this one is that its an imperial hoppy wheat beer that isn't as intense as uber sun. I'm glad I've discovered this one and will mix it with my summer beer line-up. Definitely worth it and my favorite beer by this brewing company so far."
"D: This beer tastes great but I feel the hops are very present and may slow you down after a lint or 2."
"Overall, this was a nice take on a wheat for those that like hops like I do. However, I felt like this one had an identity crisis. For me, it lies somewhere in between a light ipa and a hopped up wheat but was not really true to either style."
"drinkability: nice"
"Poured into a pint glass pours a nice yellow red color with a fluffy head that leaves nice lace on the glass. Smell is simply amazing, the fresh hop smell of citrus aroma coming from the glass. Only a few beers have such an amazing hop smell to them and this is one of them. Taste is pretty awesome with a nice sweet malt taste with a nice overall hop bitterness towards the finish. This fresh feels like a nice IPA, strong and to the point with a nice hop profile, the alcohol also lends to a smooth warm finish. Overall this beer is really sumpin' and I was very impressed, Lagunitas knows how to make fine products."
"i know the bottle says 7.3% ABV for this one, but i sure couldn't tell from drinking it...i only picked up a single bottle to try so i'm not sure how sessionable this one could be...just on a guess i'd say at least 4 - 5 of these should be easy (now i'll have to pick up a 6 pack to test it out, not that i'm complaining)...light, very tasty and well balanced....had it after a hot day of working in a warehouse and it was very refreshing"
"Hopefully Lagunitas will decide to keep this one around. My favorite of theirs after Hop Stoopid."
"Taste is like a light/medium hopped IPA. Flavors of tangerine, pine, and a light malt/wheat backbone. Very well balanced. Medium bodied and smoooth. Will definitely be picking up more of this. Excellent summer-styled IPA."
"Lagunitas makes some very different and very tasty beers. This is a really good one from them."
"Hops dominate in the taste with just a touch of wheat beer flavor at the end of your sip. I would like that ratio to be different."
"D: I still think it is more of an IPA. Everything they make is an IPA. Easy drinking."
"Came as a clear brown-tinted gold with a soapy head and some spotty lacing. A strong hop smell with faint sweetness and some lemon/citric notes and yeast. Smooth, a little creamy, light-bodied. Hops are there and make their presence known buth the citric notes, along with a hint of spice, aren't completely overpowered. Nice fluffiness in the mouthfeel makes the beer go down easy, although the balance is slightly off and there is a little bit of funkiness in the taste. A hoppy wheat beer is an interesting combo and this isn't a bad beer, yet I don't know if I'd drink it again. I think I'd rather have a wheat beer and then an IPA."
"D-Might as well call this a wheat ipa....damn nice....much different than New Glarus's fantastic Cracked Wheat....this is more of an IPA base with some wheat where that one has more weizen characteristics along with the big hops...both are nice in their own ways..."
"M and D- Highly carbonated, so a bit of tingle on my tongue. The 64 IBUs make a presence, but dont dominant the beer entirely. Overall, good stuff."
"I just reviewed a different California version of American Pale Wheat Ale (from Firehouse) and it pales in comparison to this one. First of all, the aroma just jumps out of this pint glass with bright citrus tones and fruitiness and a little yeast ester. The appearance is a slightly hazed copper with a dirty white head. Flavor is bright and vibrant as well. To me, this one would compare favorably to another wheat/APA hybrid that I know of...New Glarus Cracked Wheat. This one tilts more on the side of APA though whereas the Cracked Wheat is more balanced and the Wheat properties are more distinguished. The flavor here is bright and vibrant with citrus hop qualities. The 64.2 IBU really doesn't scathe that much. Wheat characteristics are light and in the background. Carbonation is pretty vigorous and this would pare nicely with a lot of different kinds of foods. All in all, a nice beer."
"A masterful blend of hops with tremendous overall balance. As pleasing on the palate as a hoppy beer can get, and deceptively drinkable at over 7%."
"Drinkabiity- Top notch american pale wheat...hard to come by IMO. It's no threat to Gumballhead, but it's probably the best one below that..will be buying more for this summer...hopefully they make this a regular spring-summer beer."
"Drinkable as all hell. Lagunitas, please don't retire this one!"
"Two fingers of white head over a semi-cloudy amber. Aromas are perfume like, and the hops feature roasted pines...I dream of a forest baking in an oven. That sounds bad, I know. Moving on to taste: Same toasted pines and floral hops that are just delicious and lingering all over my palate after each sip. Some herbal in the back. There are barely any malt characteristics that I can pull out of this beer. This is a hop bomb and that is that. Mouthfeel is medium and almost creamy. Go out and buy this beer. Support an incredible brewery!"
"A medium golden color body with two fingers of fluffy white head, some jagged lacing,medum carbonation. Aroma is very nice , very hoppy and bright , lemon grass and grapefruit. Flavor starts bitter with some lemon and grapefruit, a hint of resin , maybe a hint of grass, finishes ever so slightly sweet , and the bitterness does not seem to linger long , begging another sip, a very fresh tasting smooth drinker , and I assume to be highly sessional ."
"Probably served this a bit too warm, but it still hides the alcohol like a champ...I'd have no idea this is 7.30% without it on the label. Fantastic."
"I have tried 8 of the top 10 pale wheat ales and nothing tastes like this. . This is more like heaven on earth."
"J"
"Pretty drinkable beer. Lagunitas and I just don't seem to get along, but this one was pretty good."
"D- After a hot day, I might as well forget about having any of the two six packs I bought left over."
"But I know I like a little sumpin sumpin, and when I can't get it, I'll settle for this beer. More please."
"Love the name too..."
"This is a hopped-up and boozed-up (American) wheat done fairly well."
"Im thnking grilled shimp, sausages, pretzels, rye bread, good German traditional fare with this brew. nicely done"
" Body is nice and light from the pale malt and somewhat silky from the wheat. This is a highly drinkable ale that I look forward to having more of this summer. I wouldn't expect less from Lagunitas."
"Smell and taste of a light pale ale (citrus and spice with a bitter finish), nothing to indicate being a wheat. Good but not memorable; lacks real complexity to savor to make for an overall good rating, and I particularly need this to justify an ABV over 7."
"""The Guni's"" come through with a hellava sumpin'-sumpin' in this brew. Score one for APWA."
"Pours pale gold with white head that leaves sugary lacing dripping down the side. The usual Lagunitas aroma permeates from the drink: strong tropical fruit, citrus, kiwi, sugar, and hops. Starts clean: tropical fruit then wet hops, alcoholic booze swing through and slick the palate with oily residue, citrus. Mouthfeel is slick, semi-oily, but fatigued carbonation make for a nonaggressive drink. A nice American Pale Wheat Ale but a bit offensive, the usual Lagunitas style. Well worth picking up, a great West Coast ale. Elegant in flavor and dangerous in ABV. Go get some."
"Excellent, yet sharp edges with plenty of offensive knudges. The little sumpin' of a paradox. Sweet, bitter, syrupy ride to dry. WTF? Light yet heavy? Clear yet thick? Pineapple. banana, kiwi, to pepper/salt dry completion. A wave of flavor, filling the body, showcasing the yeast, tying in a plethora of flavor that doesn't settle; drifts, mixes, teases, deceives. The booze shows on taste and cognitive function. A pale American on steroids...what else is new? Keep it up."
"Drinkability is also good. This is a pretty power packed little brew. Not sure I could drink more than a couple, but this is very tasty, and well worth trying. And yet another winner from Lagunitas."
"Pours a clear amber color with 1 finger of off-white head into a snifter. OK retention and some lacing. Smells of honey, grapefruit, orange, and toasted grain. Tastes of citrus fruits like grapefruit, orange, and tangerine, honey, wheat, and perfumey and floral hops in the finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Smooth with a nice bitter bite. Hoppy but balanced, easy to drink. Refreshing and a good hoppy summer brew."
"Overall another great beer from the staff in Petaluma. They keep churning out great beer after great beer. Hoping this becomes a regular selection rather than a seasonal."
"My favorite Lagunitas beer thus far."
"A little hoppier than Gumballhead, but just as lemony sweet and satisfying. R. Kelly is right, aint nothing wrong with a little bump and grind. Thong thong thong thong thong."
"Pours a radiant golden-orange with a finger of creamy white head that dissolves and remains a nice heavy layer around the glass. Aroma is fruity with grapefruit and various citrus, resiny hops and some sweet malts. Flavor is slightly citrusy with more grapefruit and tangerine, crisp bitterness and a sweet finish. Its light to medium bodied and has plenty of carbonation. I love the aroma of this beer, its booming with fruit and the flavor is just so damn clean. All around an extremely enjoyable brew."
"Pours clear golden with a bit of white lace. Sweetish, tropical fruit hop aroma. Medium-bodied with lots of juicy hop flavors, nicely integrated with light but slightly sticky malt. Clearly a west coast IPA, with big succulent hops-- pineapple and ripe citrus. Although its a bit syrupy mid-palate, it finishes adequately dry and clean. Malt profile is an anomaly for Lagunitas-- a little less supple and estery than most, which is a good thing with this rich hop flavor. Its a well-rounded package of new-school hop flavor--similar to many San Diego brews-- and the malt stays out of the way. Very nice beer, one of Lagunitas best."
"D: another top shelver from Lagunitas as this brewery continues to do good things. Has a good drinkable demeanor"
"Great to see another limited release offering from one of favorite brewers here in my area.I poured two into a imperial nonic with it coming out a clear lighter golden with a 1/2 finger white that was quick to fade.Ahh yeah bigtime in your face citric hop in the nose along with a touch of sweet alcohol and very light toasted wheat malt,the hop profile in the nose is just great.Intense grapefruit rind and tangerine hop flavors hit up front on the palate and then some caramel toffee shows thru along with a fading toasted what touch in the finish.Yeah it has bigtime hop wich kicks arss but there really is more to it.My new favorite American pale wheat its slightly better than Gumballhead in my book.The drinkability is just awesome for the ABV%."
"The ABV is too high, and the hops become way too much after a while. I wouldn't want more than one--actually, I don't even think I'd want more than half a bottle in one sitting."
"Did I say I'd keep this short???"
"Drinkability: At first, the stickiness and the hops' bite made me think that this wasn't going to be overly drinkable, but as I slowly finish the glass, I'm wishing I had gotten more than a single bottle when I was in Texas. /tear"
"I'm really taking a liking to this style. As of now, it falls into the American Pale Wheat Ale, although this isn't typical of the style. It's pale, it's wheat, but the hops steal the show in this one. Maybe an Imperial American Pale Wheat Ale? The light, crisp, and somewhat unnoticeable wheat malts set up the perfect base for hop heads, letting the citrus and fruity flavors take over. It's also dangerous how drinkable this beer is. It isn't a session beer, keep that in mind! Recommended."
"Another solid brew by Lagunitas that goes side by side along with the Hop Stoopid! A drinkable citrusy hoppy treat! Yum!"
"Not sure how this beer got listed as a ""Pale Wheat Ale", because it screams ""IPA", dropping a bitter herbal hoppiness across the entire palate. Grapefruit zest and musty greenery hit the sides of the tongue while the middle is largely wheat malts and sweet caramel. Tropical fruit esters all over the place, but never overwhelming. Mouthfeel is slightly heavy for the style, and verges on sticky/syrupy. Thanks to a spot-on carbonation level, this beer maintains a crisp, refreshing quality to its body. Overall, a fantastic summer brew. Lagunitas has been on FIRE lately! Keep up the good work!"
"4/4/4/3.5/4"
"D: Very drinkable. Flavorfully hoppy - more so than ANY wheat beer."
"pours a clear(some haze) golden yellow color.a beautiful reminder of summertime it has a great 1/2 head and exceptional lacing..the smell is great its pine and hops and grapefruit with a gumball smell..its very nice..the taste is superb it starts with hops and grapefruit that just permeate the taste buds there is a sweet gum, fruit taste that is ever so slight with a slight wheat and malt taste that is all in perfect balance with the hops that are in charge..taste is perfect the mouthfeel is everything b4 mentioned except to tell you that this is just a smooth and creamy wheat ...im going to call this one an IMPERIAL WHEAT.. i can not believe it is 7.3 abv...wow if you like 3f gumballhead or hop stoopid this one is a combination of both but better than either.. as you can tell highly recommended"
"I had no idea what this beer was when I bought it, but I am glad that Stout @ Plaza Liquors recommended it. Listed as a Pale Wheat Ale I expected something completely different. This is more like an IPA really, like a slightly smaller version of Hop Stoopid in my opinion. Crisp with a blast of citrus hops, for me that is very drinkable, because I like less malty balance in my IPA's. Highly recommended, I will be buying more..."
"Saw this new one and picked up a single to try. I was really impressed, tastes a lot like Gumballhead but with more kick. I will definitely grab another sixer or two of this, if the ABV was down in the 5's it would be case worthy. Good stuff!"
"Recently drank a bunch of Sumpin sumpin at the City Pages Beerfest in Minneapolis. Great beer, was one of the staples besides surly at the fest. The apperance was a golden orange, decent head. The smell was heaven, grapefruits and hops, with a little malt to it. Tastes just like it smells, grapefruit, hops, sweet finish, citrusy! Mouthfeel was slightly oily with a tiny bitterness. great american pale wheat ale. not much wheat to it which was surprising to me."
"Overall- This is a delicious IPA, An American Pale Wheat Ale? C'mon now!"
"Another hoppy ass beer from Lagunitas. Love it! Wheat hugh? Id have never known. Hazy, orange and smelly. Good smelly. Hoppy smelly. Very pungent orange, mango, apricot, grapefruit...yup I think they are all present. Sweet malts and hops, or is that sweet hops and malts? Very tropical and juicey. Smooth, gentle bitterness for such a strong, hoppy beer. Yeah, really drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and oily with good carbonation."
"I will avoid the seemingly mandatory name-based joke for my review of this stellar new beer from Laggy. This one apparently is replacing Sirius as their summer 6er seasonal. While I was initially a tad disappointed to not be getting that high-grav cream ale, one whiff of Little Sumpin' quickly satisfied my sense of loss. In their continuing quest to confuse and delight brew consumers, Lagunitas is marketing this as a pale wheat ale. Hmmm. I would love to see the facial contortions of a Blue Moon drinker as they took their first sip of this unabashedly hoppy west coast IPA that HAPPENS to be brewed with a bit 'o' wheat in the grain bill. Light gold in color with a fine pearly head. WHAMMY! Pungent, citrusy hops tickle you even from a foot away. I get pithy pink grapefruit, tangerine and lemon/lime. The sauv. blanc of beer anyone? The flavor follows suit with sharp, especially citrusy, hops that fade at their own pace. We got a tongue-dangler here folks. Wheat? What wheat? I get a touch of tang mingled nicely with the hops and I suppose it lightens the body as this beer is retardedly drinkable. Hello new favorite summer beer. Lagunitas, here is yet another tip 'o' the hat to you for concocting a new, clearly not BJCP-approved, but crazy tasty style of beer. Take a bong hit for your trouble dudes and keep brewing how you brew."
"What is this, anyway? It says it's a wheat beer but it tastes like and IPA and a good one at that. Nice and hoppy and smooth. Defintite pine flavors. The alcohol is hiding somewhere but you won't find it until later. This is a nice effort. I'm looking forward to the next bottle."
"This was just released and you could tell how fresh this beer tasted. I would consider this an IPA based on look, smell, and taste. I have just discovered my new summer of 2009 beer."
"Solid offering. Reminds me of a less syrupy heavily mellowed out Hop Stoopid."
"Clear gold with a little coppery glimmer. Ecru head leaves some nice lacing. Super hoppy aroma with pine and grapefruit galore. Requisite wheaty notes and very little malt. Flavor is grassy and grapefruit zesty with some astringency. Notes of pineapple, pale malt. Very effervescent mouthfeel, smooth wheaty body. Good drinkability. Basically a wheat IPA."
"D: I wish I could just get an IV of this shit hooked right into my veins. I'm sitting here working on my 3rd glass and we just tapped the keg! Definitely worth trying. A true Hybrid beer!"
"Gonna drink a few of these."
"The hardest part right now is finding it at other beer stores in my area. When I ask for Lagunitas ""Sumpin Sumpin"" i get the ""ok yeah if you don't know the name how can I find it"" response, no matter how hard I try to preface my request with a warning."
"D: Gonna keep comin' back to this little lady, everyone knows I was no fan of Lagunitas in the past, however; they're wining me over as of late."
"Drinkability- I could have had several of these."
"D- Very drinkable to me, however I am a hophead, so if you're not you might not find it to be."
"Pours a clear golden, yellow,and amber with some carbonation with a medium sized head. The smell is very pungent with a huge citrus hop aroma,grapefruit,orange,pine,and bread yeast. A very nice smell. The taste has a blast of citrus flavor,grapefruit,lime,bread yeast,alcohol,and pine. This is really a good brew. The m/f is light with all the flavors mixing very well. This is a true classic beer. Cheers"
"The beer is a relatively pale, bright golden liquid with a good white head that sticks around for quite awhile. The nose has a strong pine/grapefruit aroma. It's a bit like a Sierra Nevada Torpedo mixed with a San Diego-style IPA. I always find hop bill descriptions hard; it's a fairly unique flavor with many variations. At any rate, this beer is aggressively hopped. It has a good level of bitterness. The grain does not get in the way of the hops all that much. I believe that there's wheat in there, but it's not a strong presence, just background noise at best. So, why not throw some wheat in your IPA? I'm not complaining."
"The last few Lagunitas beers I've had have been great, but they all taste like IPA/DIPA variants. As a hophead, I like that. It may grow old for others."
"No heat or warming to be found."
"But still, it's a good beer. Drink it. You'll like."
"D - It's ok. The amount of hops with the wheat strikes my palate odd."
"Drinkability will be completely decided by your hop tolerance with this beer. Hophead heaven but this is way strong with the hops, don't feed to your Budweiser drinking relatives."
