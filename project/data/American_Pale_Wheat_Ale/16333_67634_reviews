"A nice, crisp wheat beer.  I love the subtle citrus taste."

"Overall: well done; you've got to give some props to a committed focus on Kansas wheat.  Probably would seem even better if it was a summer day instead of mid-October?"

"O - Nice summer wheat beer.  Very drinkable but with more kick than most wheats.  Not something I would crave all the time but can see myself picking it up from time to time."

"Pours a light gold with a nice carbonated head. Hay, wheat and grain predominate the nose. There's nothing subtle about the taste of wheat on the tongue. Very bready also, with a bit of lemony citrus. Medium mouth that seems to me a bit chewy, but that may be from all the wheat this beer implants upon the brain. This is an unexpectedly nice beer."

"I like it. Would have again."

"Overall- A very good wheat ale with nice flavors, balance, and not overly sweet. I think this works best as a beer paired with food (especially BBQ) rather than a everyday session beer, not that its even meant to be that. Overall  another solid beer from Tallgrass, but there's plenty of superior wheats out there competing for my money. (82/100)"

"Moderately golden hued with plenty of haziness. Brussels lacing. A fingernail of off white head sits on top. Aroma of pale wheat with just a trace of banana. The pale wheat flavor is a bit of a sourdough bread note. The mouth is very light and this is highly quaffable."

"Overall: I imagine this is a crowd pleaser, particularly for those who like a sweeter style; a wheat beer with a difference, but I prefer mine hoppy"

"On-tap at Bernie's Taproom in Waukesha, WI. This pours a cloudy, golden amber color with a slight head. The taste is smooth, full of wheat and a hint of citrus. Overall pretty good and delicious. For being a lesser known wheat beer, this is pretty good."

"Final Thoughts: While nothing about Halcyon Unfiltered Wheat really wows the palate, there is a great deal to be enjoyed in this beer. The refreshing and drinkable mix of flavors make it a perfect summer beer and one of the best Wheat Ales I've ever had. Would I drink it again? Yes."
""
""
"Overall: A noticeable fruity presence with nice sweetness, not my favorite wheat beer but good for a summer evening."
""
""

"The flavor displays the hops more fully than the aroma suggests, and there's some pine in there along with the citrusy notes. The wheat flavor remains solid, and the yeast adds a light touch of chalkiness and (seemingly) some light spiciness - in that sense it's more like a Belgian witbier than a Bavarian Hefeweizen. I'm quite sure they're using a Belgian strain; and, in fact, have intended a Belgian-style wit with a bit of citrusy American hops thrown in. And it works. It's still refreshing and balanced but the citrusy/piney hops give it an unexpected twist and an added component of complexity. Nicely done!"
""
""
"Pretty good and unique flavor and great looking to boot."
"Beer is drinkable, wet on the palate, mild aftertaste, a little grainy, a little sweet from the yeast, not a great beer but there is nothing wrong with it, I just don't think I'd have it again."

"12oz can, very cloudy tangerine-orange colored ale, decent white head, leaves great lacing on the glass. Aromas are orange, wheat, not much else. Tastes are more orange- mandarin, tropical, sweet, wheat, lemongrass. Body is medium, creamy, a bit chalky, lower carbonation. Overall, the mandarin orange flavor is overpowering and too dominant. This wasn't bad, just not something I'd get again."
""
""
"Overall this is one the better American Wheat that I have had. Bonus point for coming out of a can and being so reasonably priced."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a criminally underrated beer in my opinion. I don't know if I would have said that before I enjoyed it out of a glass, which really seemed to kick off the aromas in a way that enhanced the flavor as well. Tallgrass really has the makings of a solid portfolio of beers, and this is one of their best."

"O: A great sessionable beer and the can format makes it perfect to take tailgating, camping or the beach."

"The Crack revealed yet another brimful craft CAN! Beautiful. The Glug was flawless and I had a finger-and-a-half of fizzing, bone-white head that popped, gurgled and fizzed its way out of existence. Color was a fizzy, hazy golden-yellow and I raised a toast as a wussy to Greg Koch. Nose was really clean, with a peppery spiciness up front accompanied by a slight fruitiness and a light mintiness. I do not know what I was expecting, but that was not it! Mouthfeel was fairly full, thanks to all of the carbonation and the taste was subtle, less intense than on the nose, but with all of the characteristics noted earlier. The peppery bite really came through on the finish, making it very dry, indeed. This definitely belongs in my summer beach cooler and is worthy of your CANsideration, also."
""
""
"Drinkability: It’s decent. It is probably what I would expect from a wheat beer from Kansas."
""
"Poured from a can to a hefeweizen glass. Deep hazy orange with a generous frothy head. Fairly ight on lacing. The nose is heavy on citrus and lemon zest. The taste is mostly citrus, quite sweet. Hops are very subdued but there with a floral undercut. Mouthfeel is almost creamy, long lasting. Pretty good wheat offering."
""

""
""
"Thanks to woodychandler for yet another canned beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of wheat and lemons. Taste is the same, wheat and lemon, some bitterness, a bit mild. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall does not have the refreshing qualities of some wheat beers, mediocre."
""
""
""
""
"I'm a bit disappointed that it isn't hoppier. I did the date calculation at the store and was pretty sure that it was fresh enough, but if Tallgrass dates six months out, this is as good as four months old. Halcyon is an affordable craft can summer refresher and if I pick up another six I will re-review."

"poured a hazy golden yellow out of a 12 oz can (really? i thought they only did pints!). nice amounts of lacing came from the inch of bright white head. faint smells of hops and yeast, slight hint of lemon. the taste is pretty bland - very mellow sweetness and a tiny bit bready. light bodied, easy drinking beer. not impressed at all. this brewery was on a roll until i had this can, even for a wheat beer it seems too bland."
""

"Big foaming bright white head, atop a clouded golden orange body with fine intricate lacing going down the sides of the glass. Aroma has sharp wheat notes with hints of citrus, mild herbal hops in the nose. Straight forward good tasting American pale wheat, sharp wheat hints of acidity with chalky powdered yeast cakes in the finish. Extremely drinkable light hop character, but the zesty lemon character really makes this a refreshing beer, I'm glad to hear that it went year round. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied but the yeast character gives it some added girth...healthy carbonation level finishes evenly balanced between sweet malts/wheat and dry yeast with herbal citrus character. Ovrall very tasty American wheat out of the can, I love seeing canned offerings out there that taste this good, the first 12 ounce offering I've seen from Tallgrass most of their other beers come in pounder 16 ounce cans."
""
"O: This beer is decent. It's not on the level of some other wheat beers I've had, but I'd drink it again if I had the chance."
"O- If I am going to like a wheat beer, it needs to taste crisp and natural. This one doesn't."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty decent pale wheat. Too much raw wheat to be a hefe or a wit, this fits the style nicely. At $1.79 a can, this quenching beer could be a summer staple."
"D: i could drink a lot of this stuff out in the sun. great summer beer. i would love a greater malt presence to give a little more substance, but otherwise im enjoying the hoppyness on this otherwise yeast-forward brew."

"Overall a simple quenching wheat beer... versatile with food, an everyday fridge staple, an all-around session candidate."
""
"Nice crowning of white lace; dull, cloudy golden-beige hue. Smells of lemon tea, bread crust and nutty yeast. Deep smoothness leads to a lean crispness, which really opens this beer up. A wheat malt bomb in a way. Bready, yet semidry with a mild nuttiness in the middle. Modest showing of balancing hops. Lemongrass, earthy yeast, doughy biscuit and a very faint saltiness display some complexities. Finishes clean and grainy. Halcyon ends up being a nearly perfect snapshot of what an American Pale Wheat Ale should be, especially for a style that perhaps doesn’t get enough love. No bells or whistles, just a great wheat beer."

"O: A real nice, easy drinking beer; one of my favorites of the style"
""
"O-This is not what I expected but a very drinkable great tasting smooth wheat-what else could you ask for, oh yeah I picked this up for $4 for a 6 pack. I better stock up on this one. Fantastic. My new favorite wheat."
"Overall, a very, very underrated brew in my opinion. Puts many midwestern wheats to shame. The only comparable ones I can think of are the Free State Golden Wheat and the 312. If you enjoy the newer sweeter revamped American version of wheat beers, please, please do this beer justice and pick it up when you get a chance. Do not be deceived by it being canned."
"O - overall, this is a very delicious, unique wheat beer. Love that it comes in a can. Tallgrass is one of the regional leaders when it comes to using cans (I believe that is all they use; no bottles) and I hope to see more breweries in the Midwest move in that direction."
"Refreshing, crisp, and delightful. American wheat as a style is rather bland, but this beer manages to bring some nice wheat/malt flavors along with some light hop notes to add complexity. An awesome example of the style."
"This is a thirst quenching, above average american style wheat; a fine ale on a hot summer day or at the beach."
"O- A tremendous wheat beer. Wonderfully delicious. There are some wheat beers that use a lot of hops, but then it loses it's wheaty presence. This one doesn't too that. There is a delightlfully wheaty and also hoppy. Well balanced. Highly recommend."
"This is really yummy. That's all I've got to say. Been turning the heads of some ""I don't like wheat beer"" types around here. A bit bolder, hoppier, brighter, and more complex than Oberon. Sweet, bitter, a touch sour, and crazily thirst quenching. Like this one lots. Good work, Tallgrass, I remain a fan of your work!"
"Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this certainly is a great lawnmower beer. The body is light and refreshing. The carbonation is slightly fizzy but does not detract from the flavors. A little more carbonation might help to make this beer more crisp, but it is very drinkable as is."
"A very nice wheat beer and a great play what can be an unfortunately bland style."
"Overall a solid pale wheat."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied with pleasant carbonation. Pretty smooth drinking and not overcarbonated. Overall, glad I got to try this, but it's about an average wheat beer. Good for a hot day though."
"I picked this one up today as part of a mixed six pack at Lukas Liquors, just south of Denver. Surprised that this can was a 12 ouncer, unlike the other Tallgrass beers. Oh well. Poured a hazy straw color with a rocky white head. Aromas of wheat and light lemony hops. On the palate, this one was light bodied, crisp and refreshing, with wheat and more citrus."
"Would I buy more of it? - yes, definitely. I could go back and forth with this and Tallgrass' Oasis and be very happy all summer long."
"Overall Impression: I haven’t had a craft beer in a can for a while, so I was a bit skeptical of it. I found this to be extremely drinkable, and it went down very easily after being outside on this hot day. The flavors were mostly yeasty, but light – adding a bit of tastiness, but leaving it very drinkable. The finish was slightly citrusy, almost effervescent, making it a great summer beer."
"Poured a hazy golden color into my DFH signature glass. Great one finger head retains with great lacing. Aroma of wheat and hops with hints of bready malts and yeast. Taste follows the nose, very fresh and crisp tasting. This is a great wheat beer that flys under the radar."
"O - Usually not a huge fan of wheats, but this wheat bomb is fantastic. Very drinkable beer for"
"Overall, it's a simple but enjoyable and drinkable wheat."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, a great beer for the cooler in the summer. Taste great right out of the can for sporting events or concert tailgating. I did a session at the tailgate party with several of these and they hit the spot. Would grab them again for a similar event."
"Overall I don't think is a terrible representation of the style, just not my cup of tea (wheat?). Thanks to McNuts for this freebee."
"Overall, one of the best beers I've had of this style. I highly recommend it."
"D: Another winner from Jeff and the folks in Manhattan, KS."
"Light mouthfeel and a good clean finish. Solid wheat that would be excellent all summer."
"Picked up a sixer of this since it's finally getting warmer around here. Nice crisp wheat beer--it's not Gumballhead, but it is hoppy. Nice change of pace beer or summer drinker."
"O - One of my new favorite spring/summer session beers. Very refreshing. Everyone who I've let try this beer really enjoys it. Tallgrass is becoming one of my new favorite breweries!"
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is two inches of billowy eggshell white colored foam that recedes at a glacial pace into a fluffy cap of lacing. The aroma is of lemon, tangerines, and some tangy wheat. It is a very vibrant aroma. The taste is full of citrus fruit with a hint of tang. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a chewy texture, and lively carbonation. Overall, this is a very impressive American Pale Wheat Ale. It has far more flavor that nearly every other beer I've had of this style. I am a much bigger fan of Hefes, and would almost always choose one over a Pale Wheat Ale. However, I this beer is good enough that I could see myself drinking it again."
"Overall, great wheat beer. I love the thickness of the beer but wish that there were actually more citra hops in it. When I had it two months ago, as fresh as can be, it was more of a standout (would have been an A-). I will make sure next year I grab a six pack right away."
"The taste is more floral as well. Hardly any wheat malt backbone, no wheat malt mouth-feel, and certainly no fruity wheat flavor. It's got some I suppose, but this beer is more like a Pale Ale that accidentally had some wheat malt spilled in it."
"D - pretty decent wheat beer. It is more flavorful than yOur run of the mill apwa's but not earth shattering....then again, is it supposed to be? I would buy this again."
"Very easy going and refreshing beer, this would easily replace Hoegaarden in my fridge during the summer, were it not that I live in MS, where this beer is unavailable."
"Overall this is a reallly well made wheat beer and probably one of my new favorites. I will definitely be revisiting this beer many times this summer."
"This beer has almost no taste. Okay, it's innocuous, doesn't actually taste bad, and is slightly more refreshing than cold water. But I want flavor from my beer. And this is not a comment on the style - I've recently had several pale wheat ales that I found flavorful. Don't think it's a freshness issue, as I'm pretty sure this just hit our shelves in the last couple weeks. I do not plan to drink this again."
"-Very hop forward on the flavor and definitely qualifies as a thirst quencher although probably not a beer I would drink over and over again."
"Overall: Seems like they were aiming for something more akin to Oberon vs. the typical American Wheat. And it is a pretty good wheat beer, as the Citra hops make it unique, but the oddly sweet taste keeps this from being great."
"cheers!"
"Halcyon has the least flavor of all the Tall Grass beers and yet, I think it might be their best. It is exactly what an American Unfiltered Wheat should be and the picture of a perfect canned beer for the summer. Perhaps the best example of tempreture turning a pedestrian beer in to someting truly interesting."
"A good wheat ale that is not as exciting as offerings from Lagunitas and Three Floyds. Better than most others however."
"Good, but not great. Happy for the folks at Tallgrass, as they continue to produce quality beers."
"edit 17Jul2011 bumped the overall to five because this stuff is just so damn perfect for summer that I can't get enough of it"
"A very drinkable and sessionable summer beer. Not the most interesting, but it goes down easy and is in a can, which are two huge plusses for a summer brew."
"Great drinkability, nice & refreshing, really grew on me as this warms"
"This could easily become one of my summers favorite beers. Great taste and easy to carry around in a can!"
"I am really impressed with this offering from Tallgrass. I would like to do a side by side tasting with gumballhead.. it'd be very close. All the flavors are very well balanced. An amazing beer for hot days. Lots of flavor and creamy body that's still light and refreshing."
"For the style, Halcyon has a VERY thick body. This is easily the most creamy American Pale Wheat I've ever had. Despite this, the carbonation level is on-point. Impressive. Overall, this is a unique take on the style that is very worthy of competing with the big dogs of the style. An interesting session choice that is equally at home when enjoyed out of a glass or swigged out of the can at a cookout."
"O- a great summer wheat ..that is easy drinking..has lots of flavor..ill be drinking this one alot"
"Update: Found out they use Citra hops, which I believe adds a lot of character to this beer. There's another hop also, but I will need to look that up as I can't recall off the top of my head. Got this info from an info card they gave out at the Kansas Sampler Festival."
"Overalll, this was a really easy drinking beer with some solid flavors. I really like the citrus. Definitely one to have around for the summer."
"Overall, a very good beer, perhaps my favorite by Tallgrass. Will buy more of this."
"Overall: Quite a pleasant beer but not one that I would grab if I was craving classic wheat flavor."
"An interesting take on the style and the two sixers I bought went pretty fast. The chalkiness is the biggest downfall and makes this one more pleasing at cooler/cold temperatures."
"This is a medium bodied beer that isn't quite like your traditional German wheat beer. Really good though. Overall, I'd say that drinkability is ok. Almost a session beer. I'd like to smell & taste more bubblegum in this & banana too. Pretty good American version of an unfiltered wheat beer. Prosit!"
"O: Wow, I'm only paying $6.56 for a six-pack of this stuff? Jesus, I'll pay that anyday. I'm gonna miss it in the fall."
"Mouthfeel is a little heavier than most Pale Wheat Ales. This seems to fall some where in the middle between a Wheat Ale and a Hefeweizen. There is a mild creaminess in the texture, but is not filling like a lot of Hefeweizens can be. I'm liking this beer more and more."
"O - This is a really good wheat beer. Aroma was fantastic and it tasted good, too."
"This beer is awesome. Light and refreshing, perfect for a Summer seasonal. Very excited for more of this!"
