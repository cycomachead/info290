"A damn near perfect summer/spring beer, crisp clean refreshing and delicious. Tart but not too much so, fading quickly into a wheaty beer without the unpleasant flowery taste of a european wheat beer. Smells kinda fishy though, scent is somewhat unpleasant but not so bad as to ruin or really even significantly harm the beer. a small bit of lemon comes through as well"

"Pours with a nice foamy white head. Sweet, fruity and wheat smell. Taste is delicious. Has just enough of a spice to it. Very well balanced wheat taste too. Great beer. Don't drink just one of them."
"Clean finish, easy drinking and citrus taste"
""
"Lot of zest.  Bit of something resembling funky/farm qual.  Lot from the yeast.  Good amt of hops.  Slight candy/fruit sweetness.  A very flavorful, intense bite, ale."
""
"Overall, a fairly good beer and worth getting each year. Highly recommend."
"Summer beer.  Utterly drinkable in warm weather."

"Fantastic beer, deliciously hoppy taste."

"I love Bells, but I don't care for this as much as I used to...I know it's very popular, and sought after, but it's not what I want in wheat style summer ale"

"Hazy straw color, sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Smells of faint strawberries and lemon zest. Taste follows the nose, at the very end you get a bit of the wheat. Nice refreshing beer. 5.8% ABV"
""
"This beer means summer is here in MI. Very not certain slightly citrus flavor of paired with an orange wedge. Very refreshing. Cloudy appearance. Sediment in bottles. Excellent wheat."

"Great summer beer! My favorite beer to drink while working outside! Too bad it's seasonal. I would love it year round."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Not my style. But solid wheat beer. I felt the buttering hops worked well with the wheat/tangerine taste."
""
""
"Great beer! Always look forward to it coming out every year"
""
"Everyone says it gets worse every year, I think Bells responded for 2015."

"Not a real fan of wheat beer but this is the best I've tasted. Crisp, summer beer. Great on tap."
""

"This is my favorite beer and I always look forward to its release every summer. This is the perfect beer to drink while sitting around a campfire or after a long day of work while you bar b que some steaks or burgers."

"Although it looked and smelled pleasant enough, this one tasted like suntan lotion. Very, very unpleasant."
""
"It's -5 degrees here in lovely detroit metro area michigan and I'm drinking this mostly average but extremely satisfying summer ale. Very hoppy and the wheat is definitely in the aroma. Solid brew all together."
""
"From the bottle at a friend’s party. Couldn’t judge appearance. Minimal insight into aroma. Crisp taste with cereal/wheat malt, citrus rind, hop spice. Medium body, creamy texture, above average carbonation, clean finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A light pleasing wheat with a balanced malt taste and complex lemon, orange and other citrus notes."

"A great summer beer that tastes amazing!"
"It may be age of the bottle, but this beer has significant off flavors. Will try again in the future and edit rating accordingly."
"Hazy yolk, fluffed but fleeting white. Lite grass, lite melon and bright. Refreshing and light. Quality summer go-to brew."
""
"One of the best beers I have ever had. The only thing bad about oberon is that it's seasonal"

"This beer occupies the category of American Pale Wheat Ale and perhaps defines it. It pours a little darker and more golden than many of the Belgian Witbieren but it pours cloudy with a nice creamy head. Yeasty bread and citrus aromas preface rich malt flavors – a little more than with some Witbieren but it works. It may also have a touch more hop than some Witbieren but they are nicely balanced by the malt and alcohol. If Bell’s have added any spices they have not added much. Here the spiciness comes from the yeast and the hops."

"Beer poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours orange with little head. Smells of wheat and slight orange. Tastes of wheat with slight citrus, nice finish, with good, heavy carbonation. Overall a pretty good beer."

"O- This is a classic, and one I hold close to my heart. One of the first crafts I had, and one I will always remember. So fresh, clean, and easy to drink. Great wheat traits, with out the yeasty, banana and cloves aroma and taste, like that of the Weizen style."

"DATE REVIEWED: August 10, 2014... GLASSWARE: Rare Vos shaker... OCCASION: Shark Week 2014 kicks off...with another mockumentary?!...APPEARANCE: hazy to the point of opaqueness; burnt yellow body; simple white head; little effervescence... AROMA: some pitchy yeast and bubblegum is planted in a malty base; gentle hops round out the profile ... PALATE: light body, slightly active; soft from tart to finish, barely suggesting an ale in the wheat; highly drinkable... TASTE: bright,slightly sou lemon and light malts; some pepper and clove arrive late;remarkably flavorful for a refresher...OVERALL: much better than Shark of Darkness, much to my disappointment of the latter; Oberon is crisp, remarkably balanced, and on par with Victory’s Whirlwind--a worthy case mate for Bell’s Two Hearted..."

"I think this is a very good offering. The fact that it didn't have decent head retention or barely any lacing was really surprising. Orange and lemon are the dominating factors, but nothing near exploding with those flavors. However, it's a nice, light, crisp brew that would really hit the spot served pretty cold during a hot day. I could see myself getting this again."

"Pours a cloudy gold with a thin white head.  Some lacing.  The aroma is grainy with lemon and orange pith notes.  Wheat, bread, lemon, lemon zest, and orange flavors.  The mouthfeel is light and grainy.  The finish is fairly dry and slightly grainy.  Nice Summer beer.  It is light, refreshing, and flavorful."

"Nothing too special, but a pretty drinkable beer. It reminds me of the early days of micros when everyone made a generic American wheat."

"O - I was glad to get this on a trip to Virginia, wanted something not distributed to Maine but easy drinking and the wife might like. This was spot on, nice crisp pilsner esque flavor profile thats a little maltier with a meaty body from the wheat, departure from the bombardment of fruity wheat beers common in these parts in summer, not knocking my socks off by any means, but a solid brew nonetheless."

"Straightforward American wheat ale with an enjoyable hop presence that leaves the yeasty wheat flavor intact. A good summer brew, but climbs up a bit in abv compared to many others in the same style. Not out of place though."

"O- super drinkable and a great fit for summer. Not something I'd buy regularly but hit the mark on a hot day"
""
""
""
"Final Grade: 4.16, an A-. Bell's Oberon Ale is one of the finest American-style wheat beers I've ever had, combining the hearty wheat malt backbone of a quality German hefe, the citrusy hop notes of an American IPA, and the light, crisp, refreshing nature one should expect from this (frequently mundane) style. A great beer that comes highly recommended - I'd be buying this regularly if it were available on this side of the border."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a hazy golden orange with a foamy off white head that provides good coverage throughout drinking and gives a decent lace. The nose is wheat/malt sweetness upfront (no bubblegum) followed by a subtle citrus character from the hops and has an almost negligible yeast presence. The taste is off-putting when fridge-cold, but has cracked wheat sweetness and balanced hops as it enters that 40-50 degree sweet spot. It's a relatively light-bodied ale with foamy (almost chewy) protein/carbonation, modest and balanced hop/wheat/yeast presence, minimal lingering bitterness, and undetectable alcohol. Though I still prefer the two hearted cans, this beer is affordable/available and perfect for that outdoorsey can crushing itch."
""
"Overall this beer appears to have potential but no taste or smell really stands out. It is smooth and drinkable but I have the feeling this could be so much better."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a good summer beer that is worth a go every year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Perhaps my can was old, but I was a bit let down by this beer. I was hoping for something quenchable but with a bit more substance than a typical wheat beer. Oberon, however, just felt watered down and hastily assembled. It isn't terrible, but I don't need to drink it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Its closing taste is smooth, creamy-dry and with an herbal bitterness, similar to sassafras and soft white pepper. Sweetness continues to dissolve and exposes the elements of grain, leaf, mint, clove and even vanilla."

"This is classified as a pale wheat ale on BA. What I had was unlike any wheat beer I’ve ever had. I last had it in 2006 and I guess I’ll wait another eight years before I try it again."

"Bell's Oberon Ale brewed by Bell's Brewery, Inc with an ABV of 5.8% This brew pours out a cloudy amber color with a small, white head. Bell's Oberon Ale is an unfiltered brew. The smell is rich with wheat and grains. So far so good. The taste is bold with wheat and grains. There is not a lot of citrus in this brew. For being a wheat brew this has very little citrus in it. The taste is nice and clean. This is a well balanced brew. The mouthfeel is nice, clean, and smooth. There is no bad aftertaste to this brew. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.25 out of 5. I would get this brew again."

":) REALLY THURST QUENCHING! Smells REFRESHING! Got 1st 6 pac Saturday after work. Had to get another 6pac Sunday to watch 2014 NBA Championship. Even tasted great with Sunday dinner(Smoked Baby Back Ribs & Sauerkraut) Only small down side was making sure I got the residue out the bottom of the bottle by pouring 3/4 of the brew into my glass then swirling the rest around the bottle until residue loosened up; then pour the remainder in my glass. (Got to get all that flavor in my glass! (SMILING) Ma New Summer Brew! :)"
""
"A reasonably interesting, easy drinking wheat beer. A little bit juicy, much more dry and sour overall. I seem to recall being more impressed with a mini-keg version of this beer that I brought back from a trip to Michigan a few years back. Still, a fair enough beer that I'll go back to the next time I come across some. Makes for a nice warm-weather thirst quencher."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this beer reminds me of summer. Easy drinking and good flavor."
""
""
""
"It has a nice taste that I found I grew to like more as I drink more of it. It has a very good wheaty/hoppy taste with a good amount of kick to it. The sweet aftertaste left in my mouth was also very enjoyable."
""
"A decent session ale for warmer weather. Great for drinking while you are outside grilling up some love. Love the 4 pack, 16 ounce cans for $6.99 -- definitely a bargain."

"Been waiting for awhile to try this and since Bell's finally made it down to San Diego I got my chance. The wheat is featured front and center with enough going on to keep it interesting and relevant in the craft revolution of over hopped everything. Oberon is gonna fit right in fine for the ever sunny days around here."
""
""
"Poured a hazy straw gold with a thick cap of creamy white head. Head has great retention and leaves nice lacing throughout the beer. The aroma is light, with hints of fruit. The taste is also mild but a bit more robust with some nice esters, a little bit of bread and a slight earthy quality to it. It has a good light weight to the body and it's not fizzy despite the volumes of carbonation. A nice take on the traditional wheat, easy drinking and with a good flavor."
""
""
""
"O: It is summertime here in NC and this hit the spot after some yard work. When the weather gets hot I tend to like lagers, Wheat, and Wits. This is really one of the better ones. Look for it in Bell's new 16 ounce cans."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I guess that I'm not a fan of this style so I will be objective because I can't get too excited about this beer. I like the aroma of banana and clove and a chewy wheat beer. This is not that kind of beer. It is not a beer that I could drink too much of and I will not buy it again."

"Drinkability: Perfect for a warm sunny day, there isn't many more refreshing beers for the summer. I could easily drink more than one of these as it is quite drinkable. For those outside of Michigan who have never tried it, I highly recommend it!"

"Overall: Oberon is very refreshing and easy to drink. Definitely recommend it on a hot summer day!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Oberon is one of my favorite beers, I especially enjoy drinking this beer as the temperatures begin to rise and I can enjoy it outdoors. As advised I requested this beer without the orange to really get a feel for the taste of the recipe. I could definitely taste the fruity notes in the beer and it made for a very smooth and crisp taste."
"Overall: This is an excellent beer and very refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A great summer beer- this one is a refreshing crowd pleaser that would be a surefire success with large crowds of both craft and non-craft drinkers at summer BBQs. This is one beer I can categorically say I would seek out for long drinking sessions on my porch, reading a book or having a fire in the patio fire pit. A great pale wheat ale, and my gold standard for the style."
""
"A light golden color. Slight head and slightly cloudy. Smells light, wheaty, and citrusy. Definitely can smell slight orange notes. Can taste that as well. Very enjoyable taste-- tastes like summer! Crisp, clean finish. Definitely one of my go to beers."
"Oberon is a seasonal beer and I had this for the first time. It tastes so good and is on my top list of my favorite beers. I added an orange to the beer after I poured it into a glass. It was delicious! I recommend this beer to anyone who likes a lighter beer and a beer that is not super dark. I am a fan of lighter beer."
"I initially thought this beer was supposed to be of a very strong orange flavor because of the picture and how people always put oranges in it, but now I know it is a very nice wheat ale with a citrus yeast to add that flavor. Also, Larry Bell's intentions were to never have orange slices in this beer. Very light beer with good flavor for a nice summer day."
""
""
"Overall- A great Summer offering. I had this on draft and in bottle and the quality was near back to back. Easy drinking on a warm day. This is one of the crafts beers I'd recommend on a 90 degree day where an IPA would not be quenching enough. Not as wheaty as some others of this style which is good. I'd be a repeat buyer for sure."
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely embodies summer, in a creative way. Doesn't go for one-dimensional citrus fruits or hops, but rather incorporates a bit of citrus with organic summer notes. Really enjoyed it, I'll probably be drinking it through the season."

"On-tap at Bernie's Taproom in Waukesha, WI. Pours a cloudy golden amber color with a slight white head. Slight citrus aroma. The texture is smooth, light and tasty. Perfect in every way and very easy to see why it is considered so good. Too bad they don't make this one year-round."

""
""

"Overall it is my favorite summer beer."
"Yellow golden color with a nice citrus aroma. Strong scent of orange and lemon. Flavor brings out a feel of summer with its hints of orange and citrus. Sediments linger but do not hinder the flavors of the beer. Very good seasonal beer (especially for summer)"
"Has a pale yellow straw color, with slight cloudyness from sediments."
"A great summer beer. Tastes like summer - light and refreshing to drink when it's hot outside. Yeasty with citrus after notes. Cloudy yellow body with a mildly hoppy aroma. The beer maintains a crisp and refreshing taste. Frothy white head holds the body of the beer."

"O: Barring a couple offerings, a lot of this brewery's offerings are pretty average - this included. I guess I'm just not a huge fan of standard (non-hefeweizen, non-hoppy) wheat beers. On the other hand, I understand why this is popular - it's easy going and very drinkable. I'd never refuse one, but I wouldn't seek it out."
""
""
""
""
"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. Has a nice hazy yellowish-golden color. Left an interesting settlement in the bottle. Had about 1 finger of white head with nice lacing. Not a strong smell, hints of wheat and citrus. Taste is sweet, with a detectable honey-ness, and pleasant lingering bitterness. Feels smooth and refreshing in the mouth. Overall, an enjoyable beer but not particularly noteworthy."

"Overall, this is one of my favorite summer seasonals, and one I will keep coming back to."
""
""
""
"This ale embodies summer in every facet. The pour is a hazy pale golden hue with a fluffy white head that leaves a nice film and some lacing. The nose is a refreshing blend of citrus (mostly oranges) and light malts and subdued hops. The mouth is light and easy, definitely something you could knock back a sixer of and not be full. The flavor is delicious and very light and refreshing. There is a very natural citrus flavor along with a slight malt finish. It is actually surprising that the abv is as high as it is given how smooth and light this drinks. Definitely a beer to enjoy sprawled by the pool or on the beach. Refreshing is the best I can say."

"Pours a hazy lemon yellow, softly pastel with a finger of white foam that fell fast. Nose is golden wheat with a bit of sweetness on it. Bright lemon zest rounds out the nose. Taste is a bit maltier than I expected. medium light rather than light. The mouthfeel is creamy and has plenty of carbonation to keep that in check. The wheat is crisp and dry. The middle of the beer is juicy with sweet lemon peel and tart lemon too. There is a bit of a sour taste lurking in the shadows that never really steps out but it gives the drink a slight pucker. The middle of the beer is juicy with fruit. Refreshing and crisp with a drying finish."
""
"Great beer, not as strong as I remember but I still enjoy it. It came out on march 23 and I just bought it for the first and definitely not the the last time of the season. I believe this is the best beer Bell's makes. In my opinion the mini keg does taste a little better than the bottle."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 3/27/2013. Pours hazy and cloudy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of orange, pear, lemon zest, wheat, biscuit, clove, pepper, light banana, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of orange, pear, lemon zest, biscuit, wheat, clove, pepper, floral, grass, light banana, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, biscuit, wheat, pepper, clove, light banana, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance of malt, yeast, and hop flavors; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, smooth, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice wheat ale. All around good balance and robustness of malt, hop, and yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Oberon was a fruity surprise, but watery to the mouth. It had that run-of-the-mill beer look, although it had decent lacing down the glass. There are distinct scents of oranges or maybe even tangerines that you can taste distantly from the hops. It was light and refreshing if not bold and filling. A decent beer - one that you want to try if you had enough of the darker variety for a while."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OV: It's a decent Pale Wheat Ale, but I doubt I'd buy this again when I can get Lagunitas Sumpin Sumpin. I know, different takes on a PWA, apples to oranges, but this is somewhat mundane to me."

"O: Having tasted a lot of wheat beers from Europe and the U.S. it is sometimes frustrating to have a beer that doesn't live up to the standards of a beer that can be had in nearly every bar. Even with the differences between the American Pale Wheat Ale and something like a Hefeweizen, there is a certain punch and craftsmanship that you look for, that is common in both styles. I don't feel that this beer meets that standard. I know people who enjoy this beer, and enjoy it for what it is. I seem to be on the opposite side of the fence. All I can judge is the sample that I have, which was bottled at the end of April. Given the chance, I would like to try this fresh and on tap for a re-review."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A nice summer beer. Crisp and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"O-The spicy, bitter hops overwhelm this pale wheat beer. Not as quenchable as a less bitter wheat beer that I crave in the summer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice zest summer wheat. Light and refreshing, the wheat has a nice profile on the body but its flavour is a bit in the backdrop to the citrus, still the flavour compliment is quite nice and a tasty combination. More hop forward than wheat."
"O: This wheat ale has a beautiful bright appearance and a refreshing mouthfeel that pairs well with warm weather. High drinkability, would have a few in a row. Not my favorite Bell's beer, but pretty good for a wheat beer. Would recommend for those that want a lighter ale that's not hoppy."

"O: Overall the hops are juicy, pulpy, with a refreshing tart lemonade quality perfect for sipping poolside on a hot summer day. Refreshing tart, not overly bitter, easy consuming nature, good. Not to compare apples to oranges, but after hearing alot about this, is not on the same level as thier two hearted, but then again not many beers are."

"Overall: Decent summer wheat beer. Not a very complicated brew, with the base flavors coming from the wheat profile (sweet malt) with more of a bitter orange taste than sweet. This combination makes for a balanced taste and light hints of spice (coriander). Not a bad choice, but not my first choice either. However, the lingering after taste is actually pretty awesome and makes you want more!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad, but it isn't really my style, but it is much better than regular APAs. I didn't finish it but I could see me finishing it if someone brought it some place. I made beer pancakes with the rest of it and they were delicious."
""
""
""
""
"It's not usually my style, and I probably won't make a special point of seeking it out, but if I see it on tap again this summer I will certainly order another. Refreshing summer ale - an above-average pale wheat ale."

""
""
""
""
"o: not my favorite style. its definitely drinkable and refreshing, but i'd like a little more wheat flavor. i'd go for a straight hefe or Belgian pale ale instead. not horrible, but there are better out there"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer has a nice refreshing taste. But unfortunately, it's not particularly complex. The head was a little lacking, but that may be because the beer sat a bit while our lovely waitress got her act together. Could use more carbonation and classic wheat flavors. A little thin and not as cloudy as I'd like. Not my favorite from Bell's, and yet it's not bad. Just not real memorable."

"O: A great summer drinker. Nothing to amaze, but it’s well built and is a good step up for those who haven’t had anything more intense."
"O- different from the bottle compared to the mini keg. This is closer to a draft taste. I have suspicions that bottled it is bottle-conditioned and the mini keg is force carbonated. It's basically less earthy and tastes lighter. The second day drinking this there was little carbonation left, even with closing the tap and the vent, so I would recommend pouring all of it as quickly as possible. I would also recommend shaking the keg gently before opening to disturb the sediment. Overall, I just love the idea of a mini keg, and I had a lot of fun drinking this- with a little help from my friends."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O--Quite a nice summer ale. Served very cold, this is exactly what I want for hanging out on the deck on a warm summer night."
""
""
""
"O- Pretty standard for a wheat ale. I still don't understand what all the fuss is about this beer. Apparently it used to be a lot better or is better at the source. Either way, every bottle I've had has been just OK."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"S/T/M - Stays on the sweet side through the profile. Wheat aroma up front, then rolls into honey sweetness, then just feels and tastes like a load of wet wheat and grain in your mouth. Not crisp or clean on the finish with lasting sweetness. Not refreshing like a summer beer should be. Won't be getting this one again."

Oberon is a great, light, refreshing summer beer, perfect for a hot day under the sun, or a rainy day wishing the sun would show it's face. The balance of zesty citrus with the sweet and mellow wheat malt backbone combine to make a beautiful ale."

"Poured from tap into pint at yardhouse in palm beach gardens Florida. Golden color with small amount of head. I actually expected more head and a hazier looking brew. Nice crisp clean bright citrus and slightly hoppy aroma. Taste is really nice subtle citrus hop and wheat malts. Really refreshing and easy to drink. Really a great summer brew...kind of reminds me of sumpin sumpins baby brother..."

"Tried this for the first time today after hearing much about it from my local distributor, Shangy's in Emmaus, PA. Never got any bad advice from Shangy's. They turned me on to Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale many years ago and I look forward to its annual release just before Thanksgiving. Back to Oberon. This is an outstanding summer brew perfect with spicy food or just to sit back and watch a ballgame. I usually spend a little less on lighter beers but went for the extra few bucks out of curiosity and the 5 star rating giving by Shangy's. Glad I did because this is a keeper and easily worth the extra few bucks to step up from my usual summer brews like Sierra Nevada, Brooklyn and Sam Adams. My glass is just about empty so it's time to end this review and go grab another to watch the Belmont Stakes. The horse I'm betting also begins with an ""O". Hopefully it will be a winner like Oberon!"

"overall: Perfect summer beer, I went to school in Kalamazoo and Oberon Day is one of the best days of the year. Don't even bother if it's more than 3 months old, i'd even stop at 2. It's amazing fresh and and tap as well, even served with the stereotypical orange peel. Highly drinkable, if you like wheat beers this is one of the better American versions, maybe because they use only ingredients from Europe."

"O - This beer defies the odds for me. I can't place my finger on it. I don't really enjoy any other beers in this category, nor would I choose to drink any in this category. This beer needs its own genre and that would be ass kicking, highly (and dangerously) drinkable summer ale. It is the quintessential american summer ale and is an absolute must try. Note - although it goes against the grain for the beer purist, you must try it with an orange peel. This beer paves the way for the right of spring in Michigan. Amen Bells. Amen Oberon."

"Overall – A nice drinking American Pale ale with a good blend of wheat, yeast, citrus and grassy flavors. Rather tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a beautiful cloudy golden with a finger and a half fluffy white head that left lots of lacing. Scents of yeast, bread dough, and a bit of a citrus and orange. Flavor is crisp and refreshing with flavors of orange peel, doughy wheat bread, floral hop notes and some earthy flavors on the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied, with moderate carbonation, a bit thicker than a normal wheat beer but with less carbonation than usual. An amazing wheat ale, the best I've tasted. The best part is that you can get it easily year round in Arizona."
""
""
""
""
"Like all the beers I had at this place, this one by Bell's works very well in the warm weather, especially sitting outdoors and pairing with a nice sandwich. Nothing offensive here, although definitely didn't enjoy too much of the soapy flavors. I really found the floral notes pretty flavorful, and it was good to see that twist in this otherwise way too overdone style. This is one by Bell's that I wouldn't mind grabbing again when I'm in the area again, although there's many more I'd like to try from them!"
""
""
""
""
"There's a reason why this is the leader of Bell's Brewery. It's a great beer. It's great to drink on a warm day. Your friends drink it too. It's on tap just about everywhere (In Michigan at least...). It comes with an orange, sometimes. There is a great amount of citrus and the Saaz hops really bring it all together. Overall, one of my favorites."
""
""
""
"I love this beer for the summertime. It has a bright dark golden hue along with a lively mouthfeel. It is great for the summertime because it has a very crisp and citrusy flavor. It has a slight finish of yeast and hops. I think that a Oberon is similar to my favorite beer, Blue Moon. Finish the beer off with a slice of orange makes it a perfect beer for a summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall-A wonderful summer beer, sweet and easy to drink drinking."
""
"Aroma & Taste: Not an overpowering nose, has orange notes with some grain. The beer is medium bodied with orange and citrus. There is also a slight bitter, earthy aftertaste. Great summer beer, especially when garnished with an orange."
"The appearance of this OBeron Ale from Bell's Brewery was a pale orange almost gold with a white foam edge. The smell a slight citrus with grainy in it. The taste was a little bit of grain with an orange character taste with a hop to it as well. The overall quality of the beer was very good and I'd recommend it."
""
"Overall - Was expecting more. Over the last month I've seen an excessive amount of 20+ case displays of oberon so I figured it was worth checking out. Wasn't a terrible beer, but also wasn't a particularly good one... I certainly do not understand the hype. There are a lot of better wheat beers out there."
""
""
""
"One of my favorite beers! A scent of oranges greets you as you pour it out of the bottle. It is a brilliantly clear deep golden color. It has a distinctively wheaty, yeasty flavor, with a bit of hop on the end, rounded with a citrus flavor. The tartness of the citrus notes make it a crisp, refreshing beer, perfect for a summer day."
"Great beer for a good mood with a bright dark golden hue and full, lively mouthfeel. Crisp, citrus flavor is very relaxing with a slight finish of yeast and hops. I love this beer. Wish it was available all year long, but then the opening day would not be aas fun. I equate Oberon to the McRib, in as its scarcity makes it even more desirable. Great Michigan Beer from a great brewery!"
""
""
""
""
"Bell's Oberon Ale is a Michigan craft beer. This beer has an amber appearance with a nice foamy head. The smell is a little hoppy and has a strong hint of orange. The taste also has very strong orange notes. It has a light mouthfeel. Overall this is a very refreshing beer and I would strongly recommend it to non-beer drinkers trying to ease into beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the first beer that I had of Bell's, and it basically backs up everything that I think about people acting snobbish about craft beer; this beer is hands down the most overrated beer that I have ever consumed."
""
"O - Oberon has always been one of my favorites. I'm proud to say I killed a mini-keg of this stuff once on a summer tubing trip in college - so it's sessionable, but not THAT sessionable. It's like drinking a bottle of sunshine and I look forward to its release every season."

"O - This beer makes me think of summer and on a Michigan spring day that was preceded by a snow squall it helped me think warm thoughts. This is an easy drinker that you can enjoy in sunshine or even to let you imagine that sunshine when the sky is overcast. Great summer brew. I'd enjoy this spring through early fall with an Indian summer, but it really is a style that lends itself to nicer weather."

"Pours a hazy orange gold with a medium, foamy head. Faint aromas of yeast, mild citrus and some spice. Pleasant and grainy on the palate, there is a lot of carbonation in this which lends nice mouthfeel but obscures the flavors a bit. For this style, though, that's ok. Very refreshing. I would not hesitate to throw six of these in an iced bucket in the back yard on a hot day."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An easy drinking beer that almost tastes like what bud or any other adjunct lager with corn in it should taste like. More flavorful, hazy, and with a full mouthfeel. It is easy to see why this is such a popular beer. For my tastes, it is not my favorite, but I am certainly going to enjoy this keg!"

"O - very good. One I'd buy a six pack of in the summer for sure."
"This beer tastes so crisp and refreshing. The sweetness comes on first with lots of orange and lemon citrus. Then gets washed out by a punch of bitterness. With lower ABV this is a great summer session beer. I wasn't too impressed at first, but then again for what it is it gets it right."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I enjoy this beer in a style I do not typically go after. It's perfect for a warming weather consumption as I find it refreshing and drinkable, with a somewhat low ABV. I like it, and I am glad I grabbed a few bottles. Cheers."

"Served from a bottle into a pint glass. Appearance is great, a light yellow-orange color with lots of carbonation and a finger-width of foamy white head. Smell is dominated by citrus flavors, but with some spices (coriander?) as well. Taste is very similar, with the sharpness of the coriander blending nicely with the citrus and wheat flavors. Mouthfeel is very light bodied and clean - quite a bit of carbonation as well. This is a great summer beer."
""
""
""
"Served in a glass, beer purchased a week or so after it came out. This is a great all-around beer. Nice citrusy taste on the front end, with good flavor on the back. A good go-to beer for people who want to have a beer but don't know what they want. Good head retention, nice color."
""
"Mouthfeel: Average dryness. Reminds you of the summer months of sunshine and relaxation. Doesn't quite leave you wanting another sip, but makes you crave summer-like food."

"Pours a hazy yellow with lots of floaties. Smells like grain and a bit of vinegar. Taste begins with a dry earthy, citrusy flavor, followed by some grain, and finishing with some tartness. Mouthfeel is good. Overall a decent beer, though not my favorite from Bells."

"It's smooth, dark pour finishes with a decently thick head and is accompanied by orange and wheat aromas. It has a slightly bitter and hoppy after-taste, but has a smooth and warm, yet slightly dry feel on the palate, which adds to its crispness. Accompanied by an orange slice, this 'American wheat ale with the color and scent of a summer afternoon' is perfect for accompanying warm weather and summer parties with your friends. Beware - the bottles aren't twist-offs. I would say that this beer is somewhat similar in respects to the orange-like qualities of the Blue Moon Belgian white, but surpasses it and others in its class and will be enjoyed by wheat-loving beer enthusiasts."

""
""
""
"A perfect compliment to a summer afternoon. This beer pours well with grilled fish or steak. This seasonal brew is available from April to October. Best served in a chilled glass this beer will provide a modest head. Usually served with an orange slice, this beer will satisfy any thirsty mouth."

"O: Great beer from the homeland and from one of my favorite breweries, this is a must have beer for any form of summer relaxation, captures the the essence of summer. Try one."
""

"O: this is a good summer beer that is quite drinkable and makes me want to move back to Michigan just so I can have it in the summers."

""

"O: This beer is very flavorful for the style and is also quite drinkable. It is a good summer beer."

"O: Extremely easy to drink and enjoyable, would be very refreshing on a hot summer afternoon. Nice and light, I'm glad I got this one to review (since after my move it is no longer distributed to where I live)."
"Definitely try this one if you like wheat beers."
""
""
""
"This beer pours a very cloudy (due to lots of particulate) pale gold. There was about a one finger white head with good retention and a fairly good amount of lacing. Smell is very subtle with some bread, apples, oranges, and grassy notes. Taste is very mild, almost no bitterness, just about perfect for a hot summer day. Honestly I expected more from this, but it is not bad at all, just not spectacular."
"Overall- Not really my cup of tea, but ok. I felt no need to finish the 20 oz."
""
"This is a medium to light bodied brew that is light in the feel with a modest amount of carbonation. It is fairly easy drinking but I could do without the sulfur aspects. For a summer brew it isnt bad but it also isnt something I would seek out again."

""
""
""
""
""

"It is very smooth, great flavor, great looking and goes great with cheeseburgers and friends."

""
""
""
""
"This is a perfect summer beer. It has the fullness of a heavier beer with a lighter hint of fruit in it. Perhaps not the most appealing winter taste but is best for summer evenings in the sun. Has a similar feel to a Magic Hat #9 but is considerably more seasonal and less versatile."
""
""
""
"O - Not really my favorite style of beer but definitely a solid/refreshing beach/lawnmower beer. Well balanced, one of the beast light pales/wheats ive had easily"
"Pretty good session beer, especially in the summer time."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy yellow-ish cream with incredible invited 'ick'. Yumm. Smells saison-like in a way, fresh, rural, bready; off notes muted and inviting. Taste is malty, grain, slightly bitter, creamy. Hinting notes of banana and lemon citrus. Some sustain. Mouth-fell is creamy, substantive and refreshing with fair to medium carbonation.A good solid, well constructed craft beer. I've looked at this for year never trying, but want to discover other hoppy ales more often than not so haven't reached for this until now. Yet it is a well constructed American ale derived from hefe-weizen style, and I see that shouldn't ignore."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bland and average come to mind thinking about this beer overall. It was not bad tasting, but not very good tasting either and lacked any real summer beer excitement for me."

"O- I liked this beer for a summer beer. Nice light refreshing mouthfeel mixed with a nice lemony taste that balanced with the wheat. Another nice Bell's beer, nothing that stands out, but definitely a beer that I could drink again and is nice on a hot summer's night."

"RE-REVIEW 4/11/13: I still really enjoy this beer. The smell and taste aren't don't wallop your face, but a summer beer shouldn't -- Oberon has a nice spiciness and citrus taste. The best part about it is the mouthfeel, which is super smooth, and it makes this beer drink easily. I like to liken the feel to that of orange juice. A must-try beer for the summer, or for any time of year -- just get it as fresh as possible."
""
""
""
""
"Great summer session beer. Got a slight head with carbonation and nice lacing in my glass. Can smell the yeast along with the coriander and the taste demonstrates some hops and slight malts balanced well. Medium mouthfeel. Very smooth finish. A good example of what a wheat beer can be."
""
""
"Walked away from about 11 ounces. I've tried several times, & now I give up. It's a Bell's beer I simply don't like."
"Overall a beer I would recommend."
"O-A wonderful summer beer, balanced sweet and easy drinking."

"Drinkability: High, but dangerous with almost 6% alcohol."

"I poured this into a perfect pint glass, it has a light hazy gold color to it with a nice small sticky white head that is hanging around for a while. The smell light of nice wheat notes and some light lemon also. The taste is nice of wheat and some spice and lemon grass. The mouth feel is nice and smooth and nice carbonation and overall a nice summer beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I've always been a big fan of Bell's Brewery, and I need to do more reviews on their offerings as they really are top notch. This is one of the best American Pale Wheat ales in the world. It's more less a style that's kind of half assed if you ask me, but there are a few brewers who have taken the time to do it right and offer a solid warm weather seasonal and Bell's is one of those brewers who took time with the Oberon Ale."
""
""
"Poured from a keg into a lager glass by my buddy Drake. He poured a bit of a monster head, With tons of lacing. The beer is a murky gold color. The smell is of wheat and lots of it, With some very light malt and perhaps of lemon grass?. The taste follows the smell largely. With some squeezed orange coming through and some slight grape in the mix. The mouthfeel adds some tartness, though a bit too tart for what it is. Overall, A good wheat ale, Would I buy it? Sure, I I needed something that was easy to drink for a medium price that is a nice change from the usual."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head and some debris floating around. Smell is of lemons, some wheat. Taste is wheat, lemons, tangy up front but then a bit mild. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an average beer."
"On tap, had a few ten ounce pours into a tulip glass. Pours a golden yellow body with a small white head. Decent lacing. Aroma is of wheat, grass, light spice, and some citric hops. Flavor follows the nose. Somewhat boring, but quite refreshing on a hot day."
""

"Great summer session. Got a slight head with carbonation and the floaties which I didn't notice when I drank a few of these last summer. Can smell the yeast along with the coriander and the tongue demonstrates some hops and slight malts balanced well. The mouthfeel is mdium. I really like this one. Tastes better than I rememebered. Probably grab a growler of this from my favorite beer and wine shop and enjoy once again. Cheers."

"O - I thought this was a very average pale ale. Ok if offerred but is really very run of the mill."
""
""
"Overall, a tasty but not especially interesting summer wheat beer. Not sure what that dank musty basement aroma/taste is from the water, but it doesn't make this beer any better."
""
"Actually had this from the mini keg to a pint glass. Pour was very nice with amber, golden, wheat tone and an awesome 2+ finger pillow head. Nose was a touch weak with cloves, citrus, grapefruit and some florals. Taste was right on for a 100+ degree summer day. A nice blend of wheat, hops and fruit to make me come back for more. Not too complex, but not simple either. I think Bell's got this just right. A little tart on the front end that gives way to a subtle bitter ending. Feel is a good bit of carbonation, perhaps a bit skinny, but lively on the tongue. Overall- Very solid effort. It's not an over the top wheat, but yet a nice blend of the characteristics. Grapefruit/citrus notes are nice edition. Well balanced and will be finding another mini keg to tap soon."
"Poured a pale yellow two finger head that sticks around. Light citrus aroma of orange peel and lemon. Taste like a wheat beer with less sweetness and more floral grass notes and slight citrus rind bitterness. Medium body lots of carbonation. Overall I think this is just well made brew but lacks in keeping my attention."
""
"Cloudly golden pour, this bottle has a bit of sediment. Wonderful scents of orange, coconut, cream, and grapefruit. Taste is great, very much a pleasing beer. Sessionable. Taste of light tangerine, wheat, almond, very balanced. Would get again, a solid summer brew."
"Overall a very light summer beer, not really my thing but probably one a non craft beer drinker would enjoy."
""
"Overall: One of my favorite easy drinking summer beers. I'll always enjoy this one."
""
""
""
"I hadn't been a fan of wheat beers but this changed my mind. Like all of the Bell's brews this is well balanced and tasty. It has become my go to beer for summer. It is light and slightly sweet, a great companion for summer fare on the grill. And the packaging is the best in the beer world."
"3.65/5.00"

"O- Complex, can't taste alcohol"

"A great pick for the summer. Easy to drink and tasty American Wheat Ale."
""

"A very refreshing brew for a 100+ degree day... I can't imagine having more then one Oberon, but the one is good, a mess, but good. Lots of carbonation distracts from the smooth flavor."
""
""
""
""
"O: Despite my limited experience in the American Pale Wheat style coupled with the dramatic variance of beers within it, this one's strong flavors make it better than average. I definitely see the appeal in drinking a few of these on a hot summer day, and wouldn't mind revisiting Oberon in the future."
""
""
""
""
"Gonna squeeze an orange or lemon in it next time."
""
"This is fast becoming a summertime classic throughout a large portion of the country. One bottle and you see why. It is one of the best, most refreshing American wheat beers out there.

"Appearance is orange-ish with a couple fingers of head. This looks nice, been waiting for this one. Its` nose has wheat, grain, a little citrus. Taking a sip of this, I taste bread, citrus hops and more of the wheat. Mouthfeel is easy going, this one drinks easily, although it is near 6 %. A couple of these would be great while doing some yard work or other outdoor activity. It was on a long weekend out of town that I finally got to try this...glad I did."
""
"This is a cloudy unfiltered yellow color with moderate head. Smell contains sweet oranges and light spiciness. Taste is mostly a crisp, sweet orange flavor with very light hop undertones. This is extremely drinkable and refreshing, and a perfect cold beer for the summer."

"Well-carbonated. Thinner than medium-bodied. Tough to drink quickly. More to swig. 3.5"

"I've had this beer on tap once and, oddly enough, I liked it bottled better. The best serving I had was in a Weizen glass."
"O- This is a great summer brew, get it white its hot."
""
"O: Nothing special about this, but I could certainly put away a lot of them. Little Sumpin/ Sumpin' was better."
""
""
""
""
"O - While I find Oberon a bit high in alcohol for a true session summer beer it's still fantastic regardless. The flavor and body meld almost flawlessly to provide a creamy, full-flavored wheat ale treat that's loaded with great nuances to explore while maintaining that overall ease of drinkability. Oberon is a great summer brew to kick back with!"

"Not a bad summertime wheat brew. Similar to other examples of the style though and does not really stand out."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The simplicity of this beer is what I admire the most about it. It doesn't bog you down, leaving you full and burpy like many wheat beers. Light enough to be refreshing, but it has enough body to truly satisfy. This is my favorite beer to have around this time of year. I just wish they would brew this year-round."
""
""
"Overall, have this beer!!! Buy it and try it on draught as well!!"
""

"O - Bells Oberon is the classic summer ale. It's not overly complex, but it does exactly what you want it to and what it sets out to do. Highly recommended for those who want a refreshing summer ale."

"1.5 finger white head on a hazy pale golden yellow body. Some lacing. Mild aroma dominated by pale malts with mild wheat and fruity notes. Lots of refreshing wheat flavor with melon citrus and peppery notes. Light body and medium carbonation. Overall highly drinkable with nice flavors which follow the aroma well."

"O: Fairly average beer. Not bad, but not good. No charater in the taste but I think it serves it's purpose well as far as a summer beer goes."
"O- Not on the same level of gumball head or sumpin sumpin, not even close. Not awful though"
""
""
"O - This is not good. Considering I just paid $5.50 for a pint, I feel ripped off. I was standing next to people at the bar with light beers and I couldn't distinguish, and flavor wasn't much more exciting either. I'd describe this as craft for BMC people. If you want something very light on flavor this may be for you. However, it probably will be overpriced. I got this on draft so I'm unsure, but I doubt it's worth what it costs for a sixer. Most disappointing Bell's beer I've had."

"Pours a crystal clear light amber yellow with 1.5 fingers width of white colored head, which takes a while to dissipate down but leaves effectively zero lacing.  Aromas of biscuity malts, some mild citrus including lemon zest and Orange rind.  Not an especially great aroma but not bad.  Taste is not terribly complex,but quite enjoyable.  Citrus is more prevalent in the taste than on the nose.  I get a lot of pear, some mild orange, and a faint of peppery spice.  A big wheat character as well.  Pretty tasty.  Mouthfeel is crisp and clean, on the lighter side of medium bodied, with an appropriately high carbonation.  Drinkability is good. Overall, a pretty good sessionable beer for a warm day in the sun.  Not overwhelmingly impressive, but a beer I've enjoyed many times and surely will drink again if the setting is right.  "

"O - This is a very solid summer session beer. Not very complex but tasty nonetheless and very refreshing. Plus, it’s light on the ABV so you can sit out on your porch in the warm weather and have a few without feeling like a zombie. Not much else to say here except that it’s a wonderfully designed beer for the late spring and summer months."

"My 2nd take on Oberon. First time I was extremely underwhelmed though I believe this was more due to age than a reflection of the beer as the 2nd time around was much more enjoyable. The beer pours a clear yellow straw color with a 2 finger white cap, good retention and lacing. Already looks better than I remember. The nose has a subtle citrus with a mild wheat base. Mild but appealing and inviting. The flavor starts with a gentle citrus flavor (orange and lemon?) and then is amplified by the mild wheat base. Mildly bitter the hops provide a welcome flavor addition with citrus flavors that meld well with the wheat. Neither is overpowering and as such the beer is well balanced. Medium bodied but lighter the beer is well carbonated. Overall, glad I gave this a 2nd chance as it was a vast improvement from the first beer. I'd drink again easily."

"O. Its a pretty good Wheat Ale. Pretty mild, smooth, and creamy beer. Pretty decent price point $8sih a 6 pack with a decent ABV. If you're a fan of bells malts and style then this shall suffice you on a hot spring/summer day!"
""
""
""
""
"O-definitely a summer beer to enjoy by the pool, with fruity finishes and light feeling. maybe a little less carbonation"
""
""
"D/O: A fun summer brew. Wheat beer really isn't my thing, and I likely wouldn't want to have more than 2-3 of these, even on a hot summer day, but it has an interesting and surprisingly complex flavor for such a light and low-abv brew."
"Poured into an Allagash glass the beer presents straw- colored, light yellow and cloudy. If poured and served too cold there is a significant amount of yeast floating around. The smell is very subtle but does get more yeasty as the beer warms up a bit. The taste is light and refreshing with a very light and fizzy mouth feel. Overall this is a delightful little hot weather brew that I could drink all day."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A very good beer that hits the spot on these warm days Indiana has been having lately. I would definitely buy it again. Yes, I will say it . . . sessionable!"
""
"Overall, as a native Michigander I may be biased but this beer is just about perfect for summer."
""
""
""
"Overall Oberon is a very inoffensive beer from all angles that most anybody can enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour is a slightly cloudy bright yellow. Tight white head. Strong wheat twang, light hints of clove. Taste pretty much follows suit. Up front wheat twang, with a bit of clove and Belgian esters hidden in there somewhere. Very full body, with the sweetness of a German Hefeweizen without the loads of yeast esters. This is what separates Oberon from other Wheat Ales. It has the backbone without being too sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass and had to double check to make sure I wasn't pouring a bmc... color is very light yellow with no head at all to speak of even with a vigorous pour. Minimal bubbling in the body. Smells like the back alley of a college bar, just generic malt and stale hops. Mouthfeel is on the verge of being flat. Overall a disappointing brew."

"DRINKABILITY: This wasn't quite as dry as I'd like for a session ale, but overall it was quite satisfactory. It's great for a summer day at the pool, at the beach, or in the back yard after mowing the lawn. It's a beer that is repeatable all day long, has a memorable aroma/taste/mouthfeel to it, is easy to drink and provides good value for the cost. I'll be buying this one over and over again."

"People go nuts over this in A2. Solid summer wheat ale that pours hazy orange with large white head. Smells of orange peel, light sweet malts, and somewhat floral. Taste follows as floral and sweet, some like orange rind, a bit of Belgian influence and yeast, but does not finish as cleanly as I'd have hoped which is a characteristic of these wheat beers that I always get. Easy drinking overall, high carbonation, light to light medium mouthfeel. Good summer ale, but not anything to lose your mind over."

"Great copper inviting color. Nice hit of hops and of coarse that orange burst! Refreshing when its 87 degress at 11pm! Not much of a head and not too much carbonation. A little filling, although you could drink a good 4 pints with light food."

"Got a six pack from a Publix Supermarket in Sumter County, Florida. Bell's Oberon is a beautiful golden orange color, well-carbonated and crisp; head retention is average. Not hugely aromatic, but you can smell some of the wheat-style hops and malt. Taste and mouthfeel are both very enjoyable. The complex citrus tartness combined with the carbonation makes this beer fit the crisp and refreshing bill. I like the term American Pale Wheat Ale to differentiate this style from a classic Hefeweizen. Bell's Oberon is a great example of this American homegrown style; neither brutally hoppy nor insipidly bland, it's a good, lively, drinkable ale in warm weather."
""

""

"I probably drank this a few months late, but it's still very good. It's not the best, but it's surprisingly complex. Much like just about every beer I've had from Bell's, I would drink this again."

"O - I enjoyed my first American Pale Wheat Ale on beer advocate and honestly didn't know what exactly to expect. The appearance was pleasant but maybe I should have decanted differently as to not disturb yeast as a traditional hefeweizen. The smell was bright with reminiscent belgium saison characters. Lemony/tropical vs banana/clove. Taste had great wheat flavor and again cool yeast, also the hop curveball was pleasantly unexpected. There was sold body for the style, it was under carbonated for my liking. Doesn't seem to hide alcohol very well. Cheers."

"The feel of this beer is a good drinking beer with some interesting flavor notes and a body that is full of surprises. This beer is smooth and still sweet with some things tied in the back end with malts."
"""Light"" and ""refreshing"" tend to be catch words for beers that don't usually bring a lot to the table in terms of complexity or overall quality. Well, this is an exception. Poured a slightly hazy orange with a very fluffy head, leavings lots of lacing. Smell was dominated by citrus, but not in an overbearing or artificial way, rather, well complimented by yeast/wheat tones. Tastes delicious. Hits the mouth with a crisp explosion of citrus, ending with an enjoyably hoppy bitterness that lacks in other interpretations of the style. Loved the mouthfeel. . . light enough to drink at a summer bbq without compromising on what really makes a good beer a good beer."
"This beer is one of my favorite seasonals. poured out of a mini keg into a snifter. It pours a hazy amber color and you immediately smell citrus fruits like oranges and grapefruit. it is medium bodied and as I drink it right now I am being reminded of a creamsicle. has lots of orange and i get a little bit of a vanilla note."
"Pours a hazy amber hue. Lots of sediment in the bottle. Medium head with some lacing present. Vibrant citrus and floral aromas jump out with sweet candy, and a funky wheat. the wheat flavor is very sweet and crisp. It coats the mouth with a tingling 'pull' on the palate in the finish. Definitely a good beer for the summer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation. VERY drinkable...especially enjoyable in warm weather!"
"O: Really enjoyed this on tap, and will have to buy a six pack."
"O: This isn't a bad beer, and the longer I took to drink my glass and the warmer the beer got the more I appreciated the flavor. The warmth also started to bring out some more complexity that I didn't notice at colder temperatures. A pretty good summer ale and I like the allusion to the Fairy King and Shakespeare."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I found this one nicely drinkable and it has earned a place among my top choices for future purchase in this style of beer. It is a smooth drinker and quite refreshing. The last half of the beer also went quite well with the Cheese Quesadillas and green salad that I had for lunch. My overall impression is that yet again Bells has come up with hit rather than a miss. While it s not a home run it clearly a base hit is at least a double or even a triple bagger."
"Oberon is a very good beer, but not the great that a lot of locals believe it is. A good beer that you will never turn down, but you also might not ever seek out."
"More care in its delivery my bump my score in the future."
"O - Good summer Pale Wheat Ale. I would recommend it or have another one."
"Overall: Delightfully middle of the road. Just enough flavor to keep things interesting. I can see where this could dominate a summer market. It's clean and refreshing."
"The mouthfeel is about what you would expect. Light to medium, a bit closer to medium. The carbonation is there, but not overwhelming. Really, this is a beer that I could go my whole life without even yearning for again. Bell's makes some great stuff, but this is not their best work."
"Overall -Such a great simple summer wheat. I like a few of these chilled on a clear summer day. Pretty good day if you ask me."
"O- Though the nose was rather weak, this is a real pleasant wheat beer. Super refreshing, and maybe the easiest drinking I've come across. This would make for a great summertime brew."
"Overall - Not a bad beer. Taste is a little strong but I can handle it."
"Overall, a pretty good summer sle offering from Bells. Very fruit driven, abundance of orange zest and standard wheat ale backbone give you a Michigan summer."
"A very refreshing wheat beer, well-balanced and enjoyable, especially after the soul-sucking delay of the lost-luggage experience with Delta."
"overall a great beer... very happy with this one!!! must try!!!"
"O: A very drinkable summer wheat beer. Quite enjoyable. Would definitely have another."
"O-I would have like more of the smell to carry into the taste but overall it is a really good easy drinking summer beer"
"Overall, a good American Wheat that I look forward to every year."
"This would be my ""go-to"" summer beer if it was available. Too bad it doesn't get here."
"Overall: This is always a good one. Well balanced and crisp. I'm a big fan of the spice and fruit notes."
"Overall: I'm not the biggest wheat beer fan around but this is probably the best one i've had. Surprise...a really good beer from Bell's."
"O- Bell's is by far my favorite brewery, and this beer is just another reason why, this is a fantastic summer brew, all around fantastic!"
"The trick with an oversized CAN like this is to have it on the edge of a table or sink so that the glass can be held far enough below the tap to create some head. I got a finger of soapy, bone-white head with decent retention from my pour. Color was a very cloudy orangish-yellow. Nose had a wheat-like sweetish snap to it which was very pleasant with dinner. Mouthfeel was quite soft with an initial orange and lemon citrusiness on the tongue, but then the mustiness of the yeast took hold. Finish was dry and musty and quite pleasant. I may be drinking the remainder for a couple of days so it is a good thing that I like it."
"D - Decent American wheat ale. The drinkability is superb. I expected a bit more complexity, but the dominant citrus profile is very satisfying."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. So different from anything I havehad recently. I wish I had this locally so I could session this all summer. I will definitely be picking up a 6 pack (or a case) next time I see this during the warmer months. Highly recommended."
"Overall, a classic summer beer. This years was not as good as some years past but still a solid beer that I will come back to next summer."
"Oberon, like its namesake, is about as summery as you can get. Light, pleasant aromas, fruity wheat taste, and an even, light carbonation make this a great quaffing beer. Pours golden and a bit cloudy, as one would expect. It's a good counterpart to something a little bigger, like Sam Summer Ale. An enjoyable brew, one that makes summer seem even nicer."
"O- I suppose from a critique standpoint, there's not much I can wax poetic about with this beer, but the bottom line is that it's a good beer to quaff with friends. I'll be having this again!"
"I’m glad I finally got my hands on this beer before summer is over. I will actively seek this one out once summer rolls around again next year."
"ONe of the best ""summer"" beers that I have ever had. A great elaboration of traditional wheat styles. Tons of yeast character, but with the right amount of hop flavor and bitterness. I wish there were more american interpretations of beer styles that had this much balance and originality."
"very ofensive aroma. sorry oberon, something is wrong."
"Pours a hazy yellow orange. Very light citrusy nose of orange, tangerine, maybe a bit of grapefruit. Taste is also very light. Citrusy, mild orange and tangerine. Nice mouthfeel. Light and slightly carbonated. Overall this is just average. Not my favorite brew from bells at all. That being said, it makes for an awesome summer drink because of the lightness and citrus taste. Allthough it isn't my favorite, I could drink this during the summer months."
"O: Very nice, smooth, quite a tasty brew."
"I'm not big on wheat beers but I like this much better. very subtle"
"M - Medium-bodied and mild carbonation. Very refreshing. It was served very cold in a chilled pint glass so it took a while for the beer to warm to get the full effect. All the flavors were enhanced once the beer approached room temperature."
"This is one special american pale wheat ale.. Glad I had the chance to try it. Will buy again if fresh. Thanks Bell's for date stamping your beer."
"Overall - Very good beer, refreshing, full bodied. Certainly a rite of summer"
"Overall, a decent session beer, and probably good with summer fare."
"o - a good beer for sure, i just don't understand why everyone raves so much about this one. worthy of the occasional purchase in my book."
"Taste is light and wheat, with a good helping of lemon mixed in. A little bit of slight bitterness, keeps it with the style. Nice medium body, and this beer is certainly refreshing when enjoyed on a boat ride."
"O- A very good wheat ale and a good summer seasonal. Would recommend for a summertime on the deck kind of beer."
"Another great summer beer!"
"A pretty good american wheat overall."
"Thanks to Schmittymack for sharing this one at a recent tasting. Poured a hazy golden color with a small lingering white head. Aromas of wheat, light straw and honey. On the palate, this one was light bodied and smooth, with flavors of wheat, honey and light citrus."
"O) A great wheat beer with a nice citrus flavor. A great beer to drink in the heat of summer."
"O/D: Why can't we get Bell's around here? If they make a style of beer like this taste good, I can only imagine how their others are. It's a ""summer"" kind of beer that should be enjoyed year-round. Definitely give this a try."
"Overall: A very strong effort. In fact, if I were to make a collection of my top 10 American Summer Ales, this would probably be in there some where. A total session beer. I could drink this one all evening. Will definitely get this one again."
"Poured from a bottle dated 6/15/2011. Hazy orange color with a thin white head that dissipates after a minute. Mild nose with soft wheat aromas, citrus and a touch of yeasty spice. Fairly malty body with a touch of that citrus character. Nice creamy carbonation. I get a hint of alcohol on the back end, which is the only relatively negative thing I can find to say about this beer. Other than that, it's a really tasty American wheat beer that I really enjoy drinking by the pool."
"On-tap at Emma's Bar in River Falls, WI. Kind of on the dark side for a pale wheat ale, the head doesn't get too big and dies pretty quickly. Fairly clean in the nose. Not a huge wheat character, but has a decent malt profile. Hops are not huge. Taste is ok, fairly clean. Not that sharp though. Mouthfeel is fine but not exceptional. Doesn't really compare to the classic champions of this style...Gumballhead comes to mind in this price range, although that's going to be a lot harder to find than Oberon in most regions."
"O) This is a pretty good tasting, and pretty easy drinking summer brew. I'd go for it again to be sure. I am thinking, this particular bottle had more sediment in it than most."
"It's not overly sweet or yeasty, so surely the drinkability is there. It's certainly not my favorite style, but I think I'll have no problem working my way through the case (received as a gift) as summer starts to wind down."
"O: Maybe least favourite Bell's, though I wasn't partial to Oarsman either. I don't like the spice profile. The beer was actually pretty okay, but I wouldn't have another. Not recommended."
"Oberon seems to be very popular here in the midwest, and I had high expectations with it being a Bell's product. I wouldn't say this was a horrible beer, but I'm very disappointed."
"M - Light body. Medium carbonation."
"Neighbor bought one of those huge cans....that poured like it was from the tap...but was in a can. The Oberon from Bells is a very good wheat beer. The color is cloudy light amber with nice off-white head. The scent is spicy with hints of orange. The taste is very good...proper balance with hops and malt with a good spice and tinge of orange peel. The mouthfeel is very easy...definite session ale."
"Overall: I just can't call it summer until i have had this awesome beer by bells! Both sessionable and flavorful...its an elegant and classic brew on a hot day!"
"Overall: The best summer seasonal I've had so far (which isn't many, honestly), and this is by far the best wheat ale I've drunk. Great drinkability, nice fruity and refreshing flavors, and just a solid brew overall. Would definitely drink again if given the chance."
"Overall: The paragon of summer wheat ales."
"The taste was a nice, subtle malty, wheat taste with a little touch of a fruity twang. Sometimes I don't like a wheat beer that has too much of a wheat taste but this did not. It was refreshing meaning I was able to drink a few of them very quickly. Also, the alcohol content is enough that you get a little effect from it but not so much that you have to worry about it kicking your ass on a hot summer day."
"Overall - Very good beer, refreshing, full bodied. Certainly a rite of summer"
"O: Oberon is a solid representation of the American Wheat Ale style, and I find it very quaffable. I think it packs too big of a punch to be sessionable, though. "
"O: This is a summertime staple in my fridge. Extremely refreshing, sessionable, and nice to drink any time the temperature rises."
"The beer is yellow and hazy with a small white head that sticks around for a while, leaving some random lacing on the pint glass. The aroma is of slightly sweet malt, subtle spices and/or herbs, and a light floral presence. The flavor is decent, with some nice citrus character. Oberon has a creamy mouthfeel and is medium in body. The beer is malt forward, though the finish brings just a hint of hops. Overall, a decent summer brew."
"One of my favorite summertime brews, and with the 100+ temps we've had lately, this has been a staple. Pours a light, hazy orange with a finger of quickly dissipating off-white head. Has a pleasant aroma of oranges, tangerines, and wheat. The taste closely follows the nose, with a light, zesty sweet orange flavor coating the tongue, with just a hint of hop spiciness. This beer is well-carbonated, as it tickles the tongue and goes down really smooth, although there's that same hop spiciness on the finish. This is just a really solid summertime brew, and is really tasty alongside a fruit salad."
"O- I'd never really had this beer, but Bell's has a winner here. This is a fantastic brew taste wise, and for the style- it's great. I will not hesitate to pick this up again- especially in the warm months. Cheers."
"O: This is a great summer beer, one of my favorites, I'm glad that this is a year round beer in FL. Glad to trade this or include as an extra anytime."
"D/O: An effective re-imagining of what a wheat beer can be, Oberon features subtle charms that cannot steal headlines quite like the hopped-up American wheat ales. Look for a significant wheat contribution in the malt and texture qualities, and yeast that is borderline English."
"Overall a good American wheat ale but not really remarkable."
"Overall this is a fine example of a pale wheat. At first I thought that I could session this beer but after consuming a couple bottles with a light lunch, way too filling! Maybe it's all the wheat bread?!? I would drink this all year round if it were available."
"O: Perfect. Summer. Beer. Not along the same line as say Weihenstephaner but one of the best summer wheats I've had. Delicous, refreshing and perfectly balanced."
"Pours a cloudy yellow with a thin lacing of head. Nose offers mild wheat and citrus. Taste is lemon and wheat; I expected more citrus in the taste based on the nose. There is however an unexpected bitter finish. Nice little change of pace on the palate between citrus and bitter. Lightly carbonated, very refreshing. This is a quality summer offering."
"O: This was a great summer beer, which I drank on a 95 degree day. Served at refrigerator temp. Next time, I will try closer to room temp to get a true appreciation for the flavors. Great first impression."
"O-like the label says, a perfect beer for summer. Refreshing and flavorful without being heavy."
"Overall it wasn't at all what I was expecting. Much more of that hoppy smell and taste, a bit more bitter than I like. I was expecting something more of the hefeweizen style shown here, but not so. Not a bad beer, I'd probably get it again...however by no means a go-to selection nor anything to rave about."
"Overall this beer is average. Maybe slightly better than average. A great summer beer."
"A nice malt sweetness while still being ""light"". Just a great summer beer."
"All told, Bell's has made an American Wheat Beer that I can get behind, which is no small feat."
"O- This is my go to summer wheat beer. just has that right combination of flavor for my taste. A few summers in Michigan surly helped this opinion."
"This is a refreshing and crisp beer with subtle flavors. Very easy drinking hot summer day beer, the flavors and alcohol emerge a bit as the beer warms. A little one dimensional, it's simply a quencher, without a lot of notable traits. Hops are muted, keeping the bitterness in check along with any more interesting flavors. I know this is a favorite of the Midwestern set but I had it back to back with Southern Tier's Hop Sun and I found the latter to be much more interesting and flavorful while still retaining the drinkability."
"I'm not a huge fan of this style, but this ranks right up there with some of the best wheats I've had. It's no surprise from Bell's: Very solid command of flavors and balance in this one. Well-worth a taste, especially in these summer months."
" Overall not a bad brew don't know if I would seek this out again but I wouldnt turn it away either."
"Aside from the tackiness it has a nice flavor combination with good hop presence. Certainly an easy drinking beer suitable for anyone."
"O- I was a little let down after drinking this beer, noting special stands out, the only big positive note for me would be that its refreshing on a hot summer day, would not pay to drink again"
"Overall - Nice and tasty, and a little more aggressive then most wheat ales. One of the better wheat ales ive ever had. Its not overally sweet but its stronger at 5.8% so this will sneek up on you for as easy it is to drink, espically on a hot summer day."
"This is a very easy beer to put down. Drinkable without being overly thin, with a lively carbonation that contributes to a very pleasant mouthfeel. If drinkability were still an officially recognized category, I'd be hard-pressed not to give it a 5. As it stands, Oberon is a refreshing summer beer that I'd happily keep around as the humidity climbs in Boston."
"great choice for an easy drinker around the forth, but ill take me some two hearted any day over this. still, one of the wheat beers out there that stands out just a little bit more than the rest."
"Taste is smooth and crisp a bit sharp but very tasty and very easy drinking. Mouthfeel is creamy and refreshing. Overall it's very good."
"Appearance is a cloudy light gold color under a modest pale white head. The smell is quite pleasant, with pear notes being most noticeable. The taste is good too, with hints of green apple, clove, and grass, and even a bit of piney hops in the finish. Hops are more noticeable in this beer than is typical for wheat beers. I'd describe the taste as something of a cross between a wheat beer and a pilsener. Pretty unique, and quite refreshing on a hot summer day."
"Poured a cloudy medium yellow with small yeast particles hovering throughout. The head was white, frothy and average in size with some really nice lacing and great retention. The aroma was strong with the scent of wheat, a mild grain malt and a flowery hop. It also had notes of orange, honey and a hint of spices. It tasted mildly sweet and a tad acidic with notes of orange and wheat in the beginning then matured to be a bit more on the spicy side with a nice hoppy finish and left the flavor sticking around for a short while. Mouthfeel was light to medium in body and smooth and creamy in texture with a lively carbonation. Overall a unique tasting brew with all the flavors of summer."
"ithis would be a fantastic beer if you were buying a keg for both casual and more interested beer drinkers to enjoy."
"Overall: An above average wheat beer but nothing exceedingly memorable. A good summer seasonal but perhaps a tad over-priced."
"Overall: I kind of fell away from this one last summer and haven't gone back to it in a while, but I'm glad I did. Definitely solid and well worthwhile, especially on a warm summer day/night as it comes across as crisp and refreshing, and could easily be drank all day long as the ABV is moderately low."
"An outstanding beer. Fresh, clean taste with citrus notes. May be enjoyed with slice of orange, if desired. Very drinkable and an outstanding entre for those who are used to macros. One of my favorite beers and looked forward too each Spring. Very glad Bell's is available here in PA."
"Nice golden color with a white head, bubly not much lacing, smells kind of mold/moist and bread, it has a bitter taste, mostly malt, I could not get much hops. On the mouth it was crispy, medium light body, good carbonation. Overall a cool beet, refreshing."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This American Pale Wheat Ale poured a hazy lemon color and it produced a very nice white head that has great retention. The lace is average. The aroma is full of soft wheat and pear. The taste of this wheat ale is very nice. It is very drinkable, and it is light in body. The flavor consists of wheat, green apple and pears. There is also a nice hint of floral hops thrown in. Overall it is nice and sweet at the start and finishes crisp and somewhat sour on the backend. This is an awesome summer beer. This might be one of my favorite wheat beers that I have ever tried. I will be stocking up the fridge with this summer treat!"
"Pours a clear yellowish orange color with a small white head that gathers around the edges. Wheat and spicy notes in the aroma; a touch of lemon. The palate is light and refreshing, smooth on the tongue and lightly carbonated; not a bad finish. Good balance between sweetness in the malt and some dry spice and floral flavors. A little citrus in the flavor as well. Overall, refreshing and satisfying. Attention-grabbing for an American Wheat beer."
"D - I found this a forgettable example of a summer wheat. Not quite refreshingly clean enough to be a lawnmower beer, but also without the depth of flavor and complexity that makes great wheat beers. First thing I haven't liked from Bells."
"how can you go wrong? it's the best of the american wheat ale style, and for those of you in michigan, you know what i mean - drinking an oberon may as well make the sun come out."
"This beer is one that got me into craft beer. It has a golden color with some haziness. There is a 2 finger white head that leaves some nice lacing. The smell is of wheat, clove, and a little peppercorn. The taste pretty much follows the nose with wheat, clove, orange, lemon. The mouthfeel is crisp and light with a nice ammont of carbonation. While this was one of my favorites a few years ago, now it seems somewhat run of the mill for a wheat beer as I've had much better recently. Still, I would never turn this down at a bar or a friend's house."
"O - Overall, this is close to a perfect summer beer. A must-have to get through a summer in Alabama."
"I know it’s a wheat but it tastes more like a pale. It’s a great beer, I just wish I had stuck with it for the entire evening."
"A cloudy, hazy, grainy wheat beer the color of straw with a creamy white head that has nice retention and pretty lace. The smell is typical of its style with wheat, apricot, and bright citrus notes. A hint of spice. The taste follows the nose with wheat, citrus, apricot and pepper. The balance is good, the body is thin and grainy with a creaminess like your typical wheat ale. Very easy to drink and refreshing."
"Hazy orange body with lighter edges topped with a creamy, white head. Good retention and good lace. The nose is simple but nice- citrus and honey. This ale tastes as it smells but add some wheat notes. Very well balanced. Light to medium body with crisp medium carbonation. Overall Oberon is a decent summer drinker. I find it pairs well with salads. Not Bells best but a flagship none the less."
"O: A lot of people bag on this brew, and to be honest, I used to be one of them. In previous year's batches, I got a distict vomit aftertaste on this one. Perhaps my tastes have changed? Dunno. However, the brew I just drank was very well done..."
"O--Oberon is a good summer brew, but I would recommend Bell's Two Hearted Ale (IPA) over this particular American wheat ale, regardless of the season."
"It is a summer beer for sure but it is just too boring for me with many other better options out there."
"Had this on tap and in the bottle many times, pours a nice hazy golden orange color. Tastes like a citrusy wheat beer, perfectly refreshing. My favorite beer in the wheat category. Often served with an orange however I prefer a lemon to swipe around the rim prior to each sip to provide a little sour with the citrusy sweet wheat. Delicious!"
"O: I am not a fan of american wheat ales....but as wheat ales go, this would be one of the better that I've had."
"M - Thin body with bright, tingly carbonation. Sweet, sticky finish."
"O: Light, refreshing, easy drinking summer beer."
"O - I think its a solid wheat. This isn't my favorite style but for the summer months, I could see myself enjoying this one. I like it and glad I'm trying it. I usually shy away from the wheats."
"Overall: Good, but not as good as I was hoping for. This was the only Bell's brew they had at the Taphouse, so that is why I picked it. I don't intend to buy this again, but I will still try other Bell's brews."
"Overall not a summer beer I'll try again though I wouldn't say it's below average either."
"Give me a hefeweizen or a wit fo my summer beer. At least those have character."
"O: A very good beer with a great reputation as a beer from a spectacular brewery.Definitly would drink again and again."
"Oberon isn't bad, but there's nothing really happening here that will make me want to have it again."
"Overall I think Oberon is one kick ass Pale Wheat Ale, and is the perfect summer time beer, I have yet to have a beer that is better suited for a hot summer afternoon in mid Michigan. I find that many Pale Wheat Ales that are similar to Oberon never have as good as balance of wheat and citrus as this one has. Everything about this beer is spot on and right where it should be. The drinkability is about as good as gets, more times then I can count I find my self craving one of these in the summer, I always grab a six pack for all summer time activities, everything from disc golf, camping, canoeing, fishing, mowing the lawn, just about anything. If you are in need of the perfect summer time brew, Oberon is for you, it is just so damn good tasting, crisp and refreshing. Oberon is one of my favorite beers from Bell's and the my favorite summer time beer, I couldn't imagine a summer in Michigan with out it."
"Overall a good refreshing summer beer."
"Looks like a Belgian Wit, deep honey colored with thin white head., wnd little retention. Aroma is a bit yeasty with heavy wheat malt presence. Very crisp on the palate which reminds me of a belgian style. Flavor is mediocre. A somewhat generic bland flavor to it that reminds me of Blue Moon's white. No great flavors really jumping out at you. Finishes slightly bitter, and a little stale."
"O - Overall, this beer is good for what it is. It's an easy-drinking summer beer for those hot days. Probably won't always be my first choice, but it's definitely one I can see myself returning to."
"A lazy yellow color. A little darker than straw but lighter than honey. Chunks of sediment bob weightlessly to and fro. Like astronauts in space. Two full fingers of off white head. Lacing remains caked to the side of my glass. Smells light and fresh like a spring day. Lemon zest and light citrus. Grass and some wheat. Very carbonated, but not overly. Light lemony citrus and bready. Almost kind of chewy. Feels like I want to bite down after my sip. Very easy to drink. A perfect summertime beer."
"O: This is one of my goto summer beers on a hot day. Always refreshing. Another good beer from Bells."
"O: Pretty standard pale ale for me. Had some nice flavors but nothing that specifically brought me back for more."
"Pretty much in line with a standard beer of the style, perhaps everything is kicked up a notch, or at least seems that way. Probably very refreshing on a hot summer day, especially if you wanted to consume a few."
"Overall, a good value and a good summer brew. I had this after coming back from the pool with some pizza. A good middle of the pack summer ale."
"O- Clean, crisp, refreshing, and smooth drinking summer beer"
"O: A very summertime beer. Looks and smells like summer. Decent drinkability. A little too much flavor and tartness to drink all afternoon."
"A very good summer session beer. Refreshing, clean and crisp, with a nice dry finish."
"D: Hard to pass on a second one of these as the flavors and overall balance of this beer are so clean and easy to drink. It has a refreshing quality that stands on its own. Again Bell's has put together a great beer!"
"Interesting beer as I take my first few sips. Refreshing and flavorful at the same time. Flavors of dry wheat, grains and finishing with a real nice hop presence on the finish. Super drinkable at a well hidden 5.8% ABV. Really good seasonal beer from Bell's."
"Light bodied and very easy drinking. Nice tongue prickling from the carbonation this beer screams beaches, barbecues, decks, and pools. Matter of fact, this past weekend I enjoyed some for lunch while building a fence in 80 degree weather. Perfect!"
"Overall: A very solid summer wheat ale from Bell's."
"O - This is a very easy drinking beer. It's no wonder it's such a popular brew in the Bell's lineup."
"D: If I could obtain this beer more easily it would definitely be a go-to summer beer. Nice and light without being thin or watery."
"Overall a good summer beer. I enjoyed it. Nothing over the top but good tasting overall."
"D - A touch bitter, sticky in the mouth."
"Bell's did very well with this one and timed the release perfectly."
"O – This is my first experience with this beer and it has really impressed me. I can see why people obsess over this beer, its monumental."
"Overall I could see another in my future but I really like the porter the best. Still when I can't find the porter and this one is readily available I would have another. Great beer from bells!"
"Medium body, drinks nicely, easy on the tongue, crazily easy to drink from top to bottom."
"Pours with a 1 finger head with a nice amber/yellow color. For an american wheat there are many mild complexities to the flavor of this beer that keep it interesting to return to. Mild hop bitterness leaving the citrus, malty, wheat flavors to come through. Finishes very clean and dry. Refreshing and crisp, the perfect summer beer to quench your thirst."
"Summer is upon us and this is a great summer beer. Poured from the bottle to a pint glass. Lovely straw color with a 1 finger head. The taste is a nice light wheat beer with hints of orange. Agaiin, the perfect summer session beer. Mouthfeel was deadon and what you would expect. Overall, one of my favorite wheat ales. If you can get it, drop it in the fridge, mow you lawn and enjoy! You will find it an extreme easy-drinking pleasure."
"Overall - Effortless drinkability and splendid seasonal"
"This has become my go to summer beer and I can drink it almost any time. With a meal, slowly or drink one fast after some excercise. I always have a 6 pack on hand."
"I'm a huge fan of Bell's, but I never understood all the hype around this one. Yes, it's great for spring/summer, but there are too many other options out there w/ better flavors and aromas.. I still respect this beer though."
"I don't know. All I can think about is May, in college, on the porch, enjoying the sunshine, and I'm having a hard time not slipping an orange slice into my glass."
"A very nice wheat beer; Poured a 12 oz. bottle in mug; very hazy yellowish amber color with thin white head and good lacing; nice malty wheat aroma as you would expect with a touch of the herbal hops; very sweet taste all the way to the finish with a good balance of hops; excellent on the palate with good body and creamy texture; no noticable carbonation and smooth finish; not a very complex beer but certainly an excellent wheat beer, not sure it's worth the price but it is probably as good as wheat beers get."
"Overall - I was hoping for more on this one as I love a good wheat beer but this didn't seem to be 100% unfiltered and as with most American pale wheats the lemon was way overboard here the more I drank the less bready it got while just slamming the lemon down. That said if your a fan of pale wheat go grab it and see for yourself."
"this beer poured with great color and a good amount of head. it's a pale golden yellow with yeast and particles still floating around as you drink. the smell, when first poured, was overwhelmed by yeast; however it soon mellowed out. The taste is malty and caramely with a slight hop finish. goes downed very smooth and is very drinkable. this is a very great beer."
"O (D) - I like this beer. Good summertime beer, for sure. I do think it's a bit expensive, so it may not be my go-to for the summer months, but Its a good beer."
"overall - this beer will always represent summer to me and for that i must have one every year, generally not my first choice but always an option, its a tried and true beer for those hot summer nights"
"Pours a sunshine gold with two fingers of fluffy head in my duvel tulip. Aromas of wheaty bread, carrot??, slight hints of citrus and yeast. Very light and refreshing if not a bit watered down. Taste brings some light bread, a slight citrus and yeast funk finishing with a nice touch of acidity and carbonation."
"O- It was quickly compared to Blue Moon by my peers. I found it a bit more pleasing, more flavorful. A great ""day at the lake"" beer."
"O – Great drinkability, a nice summer beer. Reminds me of 21st Amendment’s, Hell or High Watermelon sans the watermelon."
"A pretty good little wheat ale. Very enjoyable on this warm Georgia day."
"Overall, this is a good beer. Malts dominate, but the added citrus and bitterness of this unfiltered beer give it the complexity of a quality summer ale."
"O: good summer beer for easy drinking, but there are plenty more options out there."
"First time I had this beer was on tap into a pint glass. It had a creamy head that held to the bottom. I liked it enough to pick up a case of bottles. Bottles are a little more carbonated, but still provide a good pour and taste close to the draft."
"Overall, this beer is great. Bell's has another winner with this one. Everything I want in a wheat ale, and I am not that big of a fan of them. Perfect summer beer to kick back with."
"Another well-crafted brew from Bell's. Well balanced and highly sessionable - here comes the sun..."
"overall this is a great, if not the best, american lawnmower beer!"
"This beer is off. I'm not sure if this what it is intended to taste like, but it smells and tastes like soybean milk. It has a weird cereal, bean-y smell and taste. I could not finish it and poured it out. It didn't taste very much like wheat or citrus, but mostly like old tofu. Not good."
"Notes: Batch 10252 Bottled: 3/9/11. Nice pale wheat (a style I'm not a big fan of) that is smooth and very easy to drink. Solid malt and wheat backbone with some spice, citrus, and hops to spice it up a bit. Not my favorite beer, but a nice refreshing summer beer."
"O: Good beer. It would be a quality beer to have sitting out on a patio with friends, and a better alternative to Blue Moon if you like a slight orange hint in your beer. Smell could use a bit of improvement, however."
"Over all I didn't really enjoy the beer and IMHO If i were going for an am pale wheat I'd go for Souther Tier Hop Sun"
"O: No thank you. It's strange, because I've heard such good things about this brewer (usually with an honorable mention of their Two-Hearted Ale). What are you doing, Bell's? Just because it's summer doesn't mean you can sell cheap, cold beer with less flavor for the same price."
"D: Very high, this is a great summertime beer!"
"the CPJ"
"O - A delicious summer beer that I would drink a ton of if it were readily available. Smooth and tasty. I really wish Bell's was distibuted to CA."
"Overall> Exceptional session beer. Very smooth and the fruit and other citrus notes make this great. Not overwhelming with the body and it's an all-around great American wheat beer."
"Overall: This is a very nice, easy drinking beer that is good for summer drinking. The ABV is not so high that you couldn't drink a few on a warm/hot day"
"I would easily grab another 6-pack and drink this whether I was at the beach, lake or had just got done mowing the yard."
"O) While I wasn't crazy about it, I'm not really sure how it stacks up against the style. I'm not very familiar with the style."
"Overall this is a very good beer for the style and a great, easy drinking warm weather beer. Also would make for a great transition beer for someone coming over from the macro world. A lot of flavor without feeling too ""big"". Another fine performance by bells."
"Transparent dull gold with yeast swirling throughout the body. Bubbly white head that vanishes. Subtle aroma of apple, wheat, butter, vomit, and withering floral. Tastes of wheat, light grain, slight citrus, yeasty, sour note, with some apple that merges with hops towards the finish. It fades out with some sweet banana notes that cover the tongue. Light carbonation with light-medium bodied. The aroma is hard to overlook. It holds the beer back."
"M: Light-bodied, not watery, bubbly and crisp. Finished a bit drier than I would have liked for the style, though."
"O: This is refreshing and quite quaffable."
"Overall I finally got around to a formal review after thousands of servings over the past ten years my spring time staple extremely drinkable a go to around the BBQ pit and just about any other activity outside in the spring/early summer."
"O: Well, I'm not impressed, but I'm also not disappointed."
"O: This is a great example of the style and a near perfect grilling/camping/lawn-mowing/summer beer; way easy to drink"
"Overall - a good to very good beer. Good for warmer weather I am sure. But well short of the Bells Amber!"
"Great summer beer. Nice an light very refreshing. Not a show-stopper but a great substitute for that easy drinking lager in the warm months."
"O - pleasant; has, in my experience, a unique character."
"O: overall I thought this was a very refreshing beer that I would want to have pool side. Not the best wheat beer ivehad, but I would definitely pick up a sixer if it was available here"
"EDIT 7/30: I've continued to seek out and throw down the Oberon as the mercury continues to rise. It has really become our go-to beer for the dog days of summer. Accordingly, I've thrown a bit more respeck and love its way in the ratings."
"Malty flavor, with definite citrus accents and a little sharpness at the finish. This is a well-balanced and highly drinkable warm weather session ale. Tasty!"
"Overall, a very drinkable mouthfeel and texture, but ranks in the average wheat beer to me. For the style, though, this is a pretty good beer. Definitely for the summer months."
"Oberon, King of the Fairies and Wheat Beers, thine beer is most quaffable and thine humble bottle cap most colorful."
"D\O- Oberon is a medium bodied Wheat ale, that drinks like a Belgian white/ Being that the yeast and fruity notes in this one calls for a heavy drinker. Well done, another generally good beer from Bell's."
"Not very interesting, but then again I don't think its supposed to be. This beer accomplishes what it's supposed to-it is a light, refreshing, quaffable summer ale."
"D: great summer beer. light easy drinker, but great flavor as well."
"O: Truly a beer for the summer. Just wish I could get this in CO."
"I give a Schlitz for Oberon."
"O - This beer is interesting. It's got some extra flavor than most APWA's, but at the cost of higher ABV and a more moderate mouthfeel. I'd surely drink it again, but as it removes itself from my regular APWA summer rotation due to the higher ABV and increased mouthfeel. Sorry Bells, love ya, but others have got you beat in my book."
"This beer pours a very hazy extraordinarily pale straw body with a slender finger of foam on top. The smell is rather nonchalant, it has that sweet wheat aroma along with zest of orange. I think if the smell was more perfumed I might find it a little better than I do. There is nothing wrong with the taste at all. It's got that standard wheat flavor, with the citrus fruit finish. The hops are there, but they don't get in the way. There is a kind of acidic finish to this beer that, I eventually got used to but it was rather cloying on the tongue in a different sort of way. While it's not a wow, kind of beer there is something about all of the elements put together that just made this beer stand out from all the other summer styles of beer. If it's warm outside, this is what you'll find me drinking."
"Wasn't really impressed. Expected more from this one and wasn't as refreshing as a summer seasonal should be in my opinion."
"Overall pretty easy drinking, feels like summer to me. Could be better but it will do."
"D- overall a decent spring/summer beer, light and refreshing, easy to take down, a staple session beer for warmer weather"
"Too bad, I used to love the price and availability of this summer beer. This could use some lovin'. I taste no inspiration in this beer."
"overall oberon is only ok. I used to enjoy this beer a lot more but at this point it is just very plain for e."
"pours an slightly cloudy orange color with strong white head. decent lacing. smell is strongly of the wheat malt with slight hint of citrus. taste is clean and crisp, with strong wheat presence lightened but hard to distinguish spices and slight citrus notes. mouthfeel is very nice, medium bodied. refreshing. very nice for an American Pale Wheat which is not amongst my favorite styles, but all around this one is solid."
"If this was a macro attempt at a craft brew, it wouldn't get a C rating. For as bland as it is, I'm actually kind of angry it has such a high ABV, which precludes me from having 6 of them on a Saturday afternoon without getting more sauced than I'd prefer."
"Overall: Eh. Bell's makes a LOT of better brews...it's odd that this one enjoys such tremendous accolades in the summertime --- at least, it's odd to me. Oh well, not a bad buy, anyway."
"This pours a hazy orange with a two finger white head that dies down and leaves a little lace. On the nose there is wet grass, lemon rind, and wheat. It's a simple nose that to me seems like it's missing something. In the mouth there is a hop presence, mostly spicy rather than bitter, that together with the wheat make up the majority of the taste. With the lemon and especially the spicy hops, I want to call the taste here zesty. As it warms up there seems to be some pale malt behind everything. The body is medium, definitely heftier than I thought it would be, and the spiciness hangs on long enough to be really interesting and satisfying. I like this beer pretty well, and while it isn't a staple for me because I don't often crave the style, it's definitely a beer I would bring places in the summertime."
"Light bodied with moderate carbonation makes Oberon crisp, refreshing, and very drinkable. Great for a hot day or with a BLT."
"Try it today!"
"overall: nice tasty concoction. Early Spring refreshing brew here. Better than expected."
"Overall, a case of this is in order for our Memorial day weekend camping trip this summer. However, it leaves my palate unsatisfied, demanding more. Could crank it up a couple notches."
"A really great beer for the spring and summer. The beer is an orange golden color with a nice head on it. The aroma screams citrus more specifically orange. The taste is citrusy just like the aroma. The aftertaste is juicey and refreshing with a little tingle in the back of the tongue. The wheat gives the beer a light mouthfeel which in turn makes this brew quite good."
"Pours bright, cloudy, pale straw color with about a finger of creamy looking head. It's got a lot of carbonation and a ton of lacing around the rim. It smells faintly hoppy with a hint of citrus. The taste is similar, but with much more intensity. It's got a good pale ale malt build with wheaty and citrusy flavors, and the hops do a wonderful job of rounding out the flavor instead of dominating it. It's super creamy and velvety on the pallate. I really like this beer=)"
"Overall: A great summer beer with a lot of refreshment properties. This is the kind of lawnmower beer that summer is all about. That being said, this APWA doesn't hold a candle to Gumballhead."
"Light-bodied and moderately carbonated. Very quaffable summer beer. Oberon is one the summer seasonal releases I look forward to each year."
"-Cheers"
"Oberon-If I can access this beer in Tx I would buy this beer for a beach trip, or a warm summer day, or after a hard days work. However it's not easy to get here, so I will not seek this out. I can live with it or without it, but If you can access this beer, very refreshing beer for all occasions."
"Overall an easy drinker that is only about 5 steps above bmc in my opinion. Smell and flavors leave alot to be desired but the drinkability and feel are great for a hot summer day or when the reds have a come from behind victory on opening day."
"Drinkability is high. I can't find a big flaw with this one, other than it being cold and rainy. I'm looking forward to this one when the weather breaks."
"this is a drinkable beer. I think the wheat was subdued enough to bring out other notes and add depth. good example of class"
"O - Very nice beer. Better than your average American wheat. I really like the balance of the light hoppiness and the dry biscuit. Refreshing like an ESB almost."
"Very drinkable. With or without fruit."
"O-A decent summer beer. A little to heavy though in comparison to other wheat beers. I was a big fan of this when I was younger but this really doesn't do it for me anymore."
"I like this, but I was somehow hoping for more. Will look forward to trying it again to see whether another tasting reveals anything more."
"O: Very easy to drink. One of my go-to cheap beers when I'm visiting family in FL. Don't expect something ""amazing," but if you want a nice wheat ale for the summer, this is it."
"This pours yellow orange with one finger of head and a lot of sediment. I smelled yeast and malt. This is a high quality wheat beer that has some spice to it. Oberon is a wheat beer/pale ale hybrid that is a refreshing take on the wheat beer, a style that do not usually prefer. I tasted very subtle spice...perhaps clove, but certainly not any gross coriander or banana Blue Moon nonsense. The medium body makes it drinkable, but its a little sweet and malty, I would stick with one or two of these."
"Unlike most American wheat beers, this one isn't overly spiced and covered up with large amounts of coreander. It's very drinkable with an average abv. which is good for barbecues and hanging outdoors. I believe it stands out on its own and is really what an American wheat beer should be."
"Easy summer drinker and I could see where it's a gateway beer, but nothing to get excited about and hot up to what I've heard about this brewer. Then again, tough to get much out of this style so maybe they get kudos just for trying."
"edit: And NO! I'm not throwing an orange slice in the bottle! If it needs an orange or a lemon, package it with one."
"D: makes for a refrshing easy drinker.. quaffer."
"While it doesn't really look or smell that great, it tastes fine and drinks easy. Its definitely on the thicker side for the style but it works."
"Drinkability: Good drinkability, perfect for warmer days of summer and one you can drink slowly and enjoy."
"While I love Bell's Brewery and the vast majority of their offerings--and I adore wheat beers--this just simply isn't one of them. Even though I'm obviously in the minority in that opinion judging by Oberon's sales."
"D - Total session beer. Pretty decent full bodied flavor without being a palate killer. Could easily put back several of these on a warm summer day. When I can find it I'll grab a 6 pack or so, would probably do this twice per season."
"An amber beer that smells of malts and hops and has a white head that leaves behind some lacing. This smells pretty wheaty and citrusy also. It is crisp and tastes like a slightly heavier than normal wheat beer with more flavor and more hops than I would expect. I would drink bottles of this and glad I can find it at a lot of bars."
"D - the drinkability is pretty good. It goes down easy, and I think it is a good beer for the summer time. I like this beer, and I think it is a good addition to the bell's lineup."
"Off tap at Grami in Chicago this beer was served to me with an orange slice. The color was hazy lemon yellow with two fingers of rocky, yellow-tinted head. The cap retained itself beautifully and the lacing was in solid bands. The aroma was light but inviting: wheat and crystal malt. The flavors were similar. I tasted crystal malts, wheat, a little sweetness and some bread-iness which gave it a doughy quality and a slighty bitter finish when the touch of hops came through. Rather light and subtle, yet possessing finesse. For this reason, coupled with the light body/carbonation, would make it a great session beer."
"On-tap is SO much better than the bottle.. makes a world of difference, but both are great. One of my favorite beers."
"I'm not incredibly impressed by this. Maybe an orange wedge could tune it up, but I'm not into all that."
"D: Drinkable, crisp, good for summertime. In other words, a wheat beer. Decent overall, but not something I reach for often."
"I've had this a few times. It's an unfiltered beer, meaning sometimes you'll get particles of stuff floating around in your beer, which I don't mind at all. For an American Pale Wheat Ale, it's more on the edge of the bitter side, but still has a taste that most American Pale Wheat Ale drinkers will appreciate. This is a good beer, but is it one of my favorites, probably not."
"M/D: Medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall I really like this beer. It is not very complex, but is very well made. Very refreshing, I can see it being a great summer beer."
"For an Excellent seasonal offering, this is the one. by any means, not the best beer one the market. but. If you just want a solid good beer to drink on a hot summer day this is it. nice taste, nice feel excellent drinkability what more could you ask for ."
"Locally, they offer it on tap along with an orange slice in it;, if you're an orange-slice-in-your-beer-drinker, you'll be in Heaven. If you're a man, don't let anyone see you but it's good."
"Perfect level of carbonation which makes this beer very quaffable. This has become my ""go to"" summer beer. If you like wheat beers or pale ales, this is a winner in my book."
"The flavor is also pretty bland and void of any assertive flavors, most just a little breadiness and some wheat malt. A subtle bitterness balances the light sweet finish. Mouthfeel is medium to medium full with a higher level of carbonation. Drinkability is well above average for this beer even with the fuller body. This is my definition of an average beer. I know how popular this beer is with newer craft beer drinkers as well as BMC drinkers looking for a change. It is unoffensive, pretty well made and light in flavor. In exchange for making this a great conversion beer it suffers from having any character."
"Drinkability: The mix of sweet and fresh characters from the wheat and malts makes is very refreshing but not too overpowering. An alcohol flavor seems a little too noticeable for the ABV and style."
"This beer pours a yellow orange with a white head that dissapates quickly leaving some lacing arond the glass. The smell is fruity, some earthy grassiness, mild hops. The beer is crisp wheaty, mild hops, and nice fruit sweetness. Nice carbination and goes down smooth."
"Fairly aggressive pour leaves a solid inch of frothy head, with moderate lacing. Some floral and grassy notes in the smell, as well as some citrus coming through. A real nice citrus sweetness upfront in this ale, with some nice earth and wheat tones in the finish. Very refreshing and drinkable."
"So far I have liked everything I have had from Bells. My only complaint with them is that their bottle designs are just plain ugly."
"D- I've had this beer before twice from a bottle and one on tap at Bell's this is a really good beer of theirs they did a good job. Now that it's getting colder out I prolly wouldn't go seeking it out now, but it could easily fill out my six pac if I couldn't find a winter beer. But I would drink this all the time in the warm weather if I could."
"I liked this. I'm normally not fond of summer beers, but the subtle sweetness of Oberon won me over. On top of that, it's got above average ABV, but it still drinks well."
"D: I can't drink any more. I'm going to pour it out. Maybe I have a bad sample, maybe I just don't like this style, but I can't stand this one. It's not worth the pain to me."
"Lucky enough to have a friend who makes mid west beer runs and to able to sample this. Pours an orange amber with lots of good stuff floating around. There is an overpowering orange aroma going on from start to finish, really amazing stuff, I can only imagine what it tastes like fresh. This is a perfect summer beer, it is incredibly refreshing and worth tracking down if possible."
"A very great widely distributed beer that'd be great on both a hot day and a cool day. Highly recommended."
"Figured I'd grab one o' these guys before they disappear for the rest of the year. It pours a pretty clear pale straw, riddled with particulates, topped by over a finger of healthy white froth. The nose comprises orange peel, mandarin orange flesh, puffed rice, and wet wheat. The taste comprises corn syrup, wheat, light mandarin orange, and flowers. The body is light, with a light carbonation and a thickly watery feel. Overall, a decent APWA, nothing close to special, but highly drinkable."
"Bottom line, I like Bell's, but it's too expensive down south here, so I don't get it as much as I'd like."
"A nice white-yellow hue, very reminiscent of a quality Belgian hefe. Although you could tag the usual banana, clove and citrus labels, this establishes something more enjoyable. Unfortunately seasonal, this could last through the fall. Relaxed palette, not overwhelmingly wheat or feminine, pleasantly subtle, would definitely pair well with certain foods. Larry Bell should really get his stuff to the east coast more consistently. I'd surely stock this in the fridge."
"A good all-around summer staple with plenty of punch."
"It tastes sweet from the start, maybe starting citrusy and moving towards the wheat/yeast character, but finishes like a good tart/peppery wine. I don't love the sweetness, and for that reason am marking it down, but it's still a very good beer, and the mouthfeel is thick and prickly. Wouldn't seek out but would drink again."
"Very sessionable. Bubbly and refreshing and hoppy. Great summer/warm weather brew."
"A drinkable and very good tasting brew. Give it a shot on a hot summer day."
"D- Great Flavor! Easy and extremely enjoyable to drink. One of my favorite summertime wheat beers."
"O: Very refreshing and perfect for summer. Where other summer beers are watered down, this beer actually has some supporting body with the pale and wheat malt."
"Overall: Only the smell leaves something to be desired. One of the easiest wheat beers to drink in my opinion."
"DB- A good fruit flavor in this beer, it tastes pretty fresh and the citrus is not overly zesty. Pretty well balanced and definitely refreshing."
"Poured into glass with quickly disappearing head.. Usually I garnish this with an orange.. Today did not have any but either way a good beer for a nice 90 degree day... Usual wheat beer taste but I really enjoy these on hot days.. Will get couple cases again in 2011.."
"D: Exceptionally easy to drink. Great session beer. I've had a six-pack in a night and know many others who have as well."
"D) A very good example of the American version of Witte Beer."
"D: Very good beer to relax and enjoy on a warm day. A good all-around easy drinking beer, and one of the best wheat beers I've had."
"Drinkability: for a summer wheat, I could drink a bunch of these, definitely would be nice on a hot summer day."
"D - This is an awesome summer beer super refreshing with a great taste thats easy to drink all day long in the summer heat worth hunting down for the summer"
"Overall- I very good summer ale for sure. I much larger fan of other wheat beers such as North Coast's Blue Star or Avery's White Rascal but it's a solid beer."
"D: I put the beer down in about 10-15 seconds. Once I got my first taste, I couldn't stop drinking it. Nectar of the gods sums this up perfectly. Mix the PERFECT taste with a decent ABV and you have a session brew."
"Sometimes ales are a little too sweet and caramelly for me, so at times, I'm hesitant to choose an ale. This was a good one. A full-bodied flavor, the malt wasn't too sweet - but there was that hint. A little hint of hops balanced nicely. I might have had another had the tenderloin not just come off the grill then. I guess this beer reopened an avenue of beers for me that had been under construction."
"Drinkability - Very nice summer brew. Easily drinkable. Perfect after a hot, hard days work. This beer is better than most summer wheat beers I've tried."
"I intend to pick up a cask of this - I've seen them around several stores. Unlike Two Hearted, I don't think this should be aged. Just drink it now!"
"Very nice summer wheat on tap at the Farmhouse. Nice head. A bit yeasty for me. Balanced mouthfeel goes down pretty easy on warm summer day. I'd much prefer a hopslam or two hearted but not bad for the style. Bell's has yet to produce a beer that I have not liked."
"The price was expensive ,the beer was ok."
"This tastes great on a saturday afternoon by the grill. There is some bright citrus upfront followed by orange and finished with a good level of carbonation. I can usually drink a few of these in the afternoon, however if it is hot outside, I find myself resorting to something that sits lighter in my stomach."
"Absolutely delicious summer beer here!! Extremely easy to put down and I'd imagine it'd be awesome on a hot day."
"I truly love this beer. One of the best. I have yet to drink a bad beer from Bell's."
"It was an easy drinking beer, definitely could have had more. I would buy this again when I am in the mood for a change of pace."
"MD-This is a fantastic summer beer. It is one of the best American unfiltered wheat beers I have had."
"D - Highly drinkable without all the spices getting in the way like they do with some beers. Goes does smooth and is quite refreshing..great beer for a hot day."
"This was pretty damn good. I've been putting this one off for some time and I'm glad I finally went for it. Good go-to for the style."
"D- It is certainly refreshing and drinkable but the flavours are just understated and appearance lets it down also. Not bad."
"D - Quite drinkable with a very nice body and good wheat character. The spices get just a bit phenolic in the middle and this characteristic is emphasized by the herbal hops. This is not a bad beer, though it isn't something that really does it for me and I would not seek it out again."
"This has a smooth and refreshing mouthfeel, which in turn lends to it being a highly drinkable beer. An excellent summer session beer, I highly recommend this for the next cookout! A word of advice, though, don't ruin the taste by popping a lemon or orange in it. Enjoy it as Bell's intended."
"One of my more enjoyable summer beer experiences. Unlike most summer wheats there is a decent amount of alcohol in it. Not that 5.8 will kick your ass but it has a little more oomf that most summer beers don't have."
"It's semi-sweet and you get a nice dose of wheat flavor, again followed by orange. Not my favorite beer but it's an excellent choice for the summer and I could easily drink this all day."
"It is most certainly worth a try if you can find it near by, but I wouldn't make a special trip to Michigan for this one."
"Mouthfeel is a little bit thicker than it should be and slightly sweet. Overall it's a very nice beer for summer."
"Overall: This is a very good summer wheat beer. It may be a bit to fruity for some tastes, but I quite enjoyed it."
"Mouthfeel was my favorite aspect of this one."
"D-great summer beer out in the sun, but it's nothing complex or really flavorful IMO"
"D - If this beer was available around here I'd most likely be drinking quite a lot of it over the summer."
"I've been putting this one off for god knows what reason (I LOVE everything that bells comes out with) and now I am satisfied."
"D: I finally get to try the Midwest summer classic, Bell's Oberon. For the style it's above average, better than Blue Moon, but it does remind me a lot of that beer, the bitter spice component is similar in both beers."
"goes down well. a bit too sweet, but its not over-the-top on the sweetness nor the spice. the slight hop bite helps to keep this well-balanced and relatively drinkable. a decent warm-weather brew."
"Small white head retains as a cap over golden with yellow edges. Good lacing. Aromas are faint fruitiness and wheat, with flavors mirroring what I'm getting on the nose. Stone fruit and fresh graininess. It's a weird combination of sour and ripe fruits. A crispy, thin mouthfeel helps it all go down smoothly. Not sure I'd reach for this again, what with all the other incredible Bell's offerings!"
"Drinkability: This is the scent and taste of a sunny afternoon? Ha! It's tasty, smooth, and easy drinking, but I'm a little turned off by the Orange Crush. It does not stand out on its own -- it reminds me too much of Blue Moon -- but the hop bite at the end does provide uniqueness."
"Overall a very well balance, very well done beer."
"Served from tap into a Dogfish Head standard pint. Pours hazy yellow orange with a one finger white head. Maintains excellent lacing throughout. The aroma is comprised of wheat, fruit, malt, and skunk. The flavor is of skunk, subtle malt, and wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was not a bad brew, but wasn't really that great either. If the skunky aspect was not present it and there was more of a fruit aroma this could be nice. I would still drink this again, but just not anytime soon."
"T- The rye does come through and malt sour is there as well. There's a wheatyness to it. Carbonated. Refreshing, yet nothing truly jumps out. But very good effort."
"This is among the best American Pale Wheat Ales that I've had. It is different than, say, Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat or Goose Island 312, but that difference is helpful. A good session choice in the summer."
"This summer beer is impressive. It's a summer seasonal with a full flavor and a fine blend of hops. As a wheat beer the wheat is suttle and pleasant and not too overbearing at all. The smell brings a floral sweetness that is modest and attractive. It also drinks well with good food and compliments fresh fish."
"d - excellent summer session."
"Pours a pale coppery/golden, with a decent head that subsides quickly, leaving a thin layer of foam and a good amount of lacing. Nice floral aroma, with piney hop notes detectable in the background. Taste features more maltiness than I expected, and some woody vanilla notes in the aftertaste. Okay, mouthfeel, but could have benefitted from a bit more combination I think. Though not my favorite style, this is a solid, drinkable brew."
"I found a mini keg and will buy it next time I see it, it's a great beer."
"This is a pretty tasty and drinkable beer...especially while sitting outside at the ballgame!"
"D-Drinkability on this one is very high especially after mowing on a Summer day."
"D - I could easily fill a pick 6 of these. Very drinkable summer beer, especially after a long day!"
"Poured a hazy lemon gold with a modest white head. Lacing was ample and lasting. and lemon Nose was citrus upfront, especially orange, with some wheat and breay malt obvious as well. Taste started with sweet citrus moderated by malts and finishing with a crisp and pleasing bitterness. Mouthfeel was average for this style, lighter than medium with good carbonation. This was, like everything from Bell's seems to be, a solid offering I will try again."
"Notes: This beer shows all the signs of a well made beer, which I've come to expect from Bell's. However being good is far short of being great. The flavor just doesn't work for me, it is much too sweet. A wheat ale should be crisp and bright, but this feels heavy and sugary."
"Notes: This is a great beer for the style, a goto for a lighter beer that has a nice warming body to it."
"d 4 i'm having a hard time thinking of this as a summer beer. it may be brewed for mass consumption, but in an Oktoberfest rather than lawnmower-beer sort of way. the heft, mouthfeel and strength support that impression (it does not, of course taste anything like a fest beer). this beer is well-balanced and encourages moderately paced quaffing, but beware of its punch (particuarly if you're drawing from a 5L minikeg)."
"Drinks great for the summer and is highly refreshing."
"Poured into my Zatec fluted glass. Decent 1 finger of white head, golden color. Smells of tart citrus and a light yeasty bready scent. Tastes like tart citrus flavors, especially lemon. Some other typical wheat beer flavor. Refreshing, and a little more hop prevalent than other wheats. Could drink a couple more if these if need be. Bell's does not disappoint."
"Recommended for a hot summer day where you don't want to compromise the breadth of flavor."
"D - This beer could disappear so quickly...a great refresher on a warm day. Nicely spicy and wheaty. Goes down like water. Really great on a hot summer day."
"Poured from a 5 liter mini-keg into a Weizen glass. Pours a slighly hazy golden color with a big white head and low carbonation. Leaves very nice lacing. Smells of fresh citrusy fruits, tangy and tart. Has a very nice clean wheat malt profile with some lemon notes. Has a nice meduim body mouthfeel that goes down smooth. Very nice easy drinking wheat."
"D - Really easy drinker. Could toss these back all day and night. Soft & subtle with a nice flavor."
"D - Easy to drink and good in the heat."
"Drinkability- If it's warm outside and the sun is shining, this is a great brew with which to relax and enjoy the Summer days."
"One of the best summer beers out there. Light, yet complex."
"Those who tend to compare this to macro swill confound me, there is so much character in this brew that can't be found in any B, M, or C -- I wonder if any new beer drinker is getting beyond extreme brews."
"This is truly a perfect summer beer, with a far deeper taste than I initially expected. On the first sip there is a light taste of citrus with a fairly well rounded finish, but every sip that follows brings a different experience, deeper citrus notes and the bitterness rounds out well the further down the bottle I got. At its price point it is truly a great beer for a summer party, or just sipping alone outside."
"D: Very high: The crisp flavor and low ABV make Oberon one of the most delicious and sessionable summer beers I've ever had. Very highly recommended!"
"Oberon signifies the start of summer. Serve with a orange, and allow a bit of foam to form to induce the C02 and release the great flavor. I enjoy this beer as it is in the middle of my hops tolerance range with Bells two hearted ale being too strong for me, I opt for this beer for all the summer season. I think of it as a bit like blue moon but with much better hops flavoring."
"Light body with light carbonation. As a whole, this is nothing special but as a summer beer it is enjoyable all the same on a hot day. Quite refreshing, has its place during the summer."
"Pours a golden color, somewhere between the yellow of adjunct lager and the haze of a Heifweizen. A nice, two finger head. the smell is nothing overwhelming, but it obviously smells like wheat, and perhaps a bit of fruitiness. The taste is nice, I struggle for words to describe it. The mouth feel is smooth, and its a very drinkable beer. Although I don't love this beer, I certainly like it, and its one of the better session beers I have come across."
"D: I do not understand why this beer does not get slammed like others of a similar style do. This is really no different than most of the beers being advertised by brewpubs as ""hefeweizens""."
"Let's be honest, this is a summer easy drinking beer that is trying to be nothing but that. On that level, it excels. Awesome THICK foamy head that is around forever, nose is mild and the taste is wheat, yeast, and pale malts. Mouthfeel is light and the beer is crazy drinkable. I don't like this summer beer stuff normally, but if I had to drink one, this is it."
"D: very drinkable beer for a hot summer day and would enjoy some pool side."
"Had on tap at Mad Mex. Pours a very light amber, almost golden with a tint of red. Smells wheaty with a little hop nose. Mostly lighter malts hit the nose. Tastes like banana wheat with a touch of clove. A tad bit of citrus is apparent. Maybe a little chalk. A little honey sweetness is also noticeable. Slightly bitter with good carbonation. Refreshing as it's rather light tasting. Good summertime beer; a thirst quencher."
"Bell's Oberon Ale poured a lighter amber color, with a good head, that dispated with the beer, and there was small sized sediemnt present as well. The beer smelled like wheat and oranges. The taste wsa of a very flavorfull wheat beer, and there was a very strong orange taste as well. It was lighter but very flavorfull, easy to drink. Overall a really good beer, I would have it again, great summer ale."
"D- Bit of a heavier beer, but also can be more refreshing that others. The drinkability can really depend on what you're doing and what time of year it is: it is highly drinkable outside in the warm sun while you watch the sweat bead down the glass, but not so much in fall when you're inside and the batch has gotten older."
"12-oz bottle. Yellow gold cloudy color. Very nice white head. Doughy aroma with some spice. Lightly sweet up front. Medium-to-light body. Silky soft texture. Very pleasant. One of the most pleasant memories of my life was playing disc golf in August with my brother in Michigan after years of being gone from the state. A six-pack of Oberon was involved, so I am partial to this beer for sentimental reasons. The quintessential summertime beer."
"D - I find this beer extremely drinkable, one of my go-to summer beers. I can easily throw back 2-3 after a day of yardwork in the sweltering Georgia heat. Great beer from one of my favorite breweries."
"Drinkability - This would be a good summer beer. Light, not too filling, not too high on abv, but high enough. No lingering aftertaste."
"D - This is just about as drinkable as your typical Miller Lite or High Life. Now don't get me wrong, when I'm unwinding with my buddies and looking for a night out, nothing beats 8 or 9 Miller Lites or High Lifes - but, that is certainly not what I'm looking for in a craft beer."
"Beer poured a clear golden color with a nice long lasting white head. Nose is wheat and hints of citrus. Taste is wheat, lemon, grass, and white pepper. Mouthfeel is lively and refreshing, good carbonation. The Saaz hops liven things up. Overall drinkability is good, this makes for a good lawnmower or early fall tailgate beer."
"Go Hawks!"
"Hazy golden sun color, white thin band around edge, citrusy with a very slight yeasty character, but the orange is forefront and standout. mouth feel has medium carbination and a slightly viscious consistancy, very drinkable during the summer months but not appealing to me during the other 6, and this is one of the few beers id rather drink chilled then room temperature."
"An interesting beer. Very drinkable and nice. Hops are big in this beer and really give it a strong potpouri type flavor alongside an earthy summer wheat beer."
"Pours a bright golden orange with huge plume of white, frothy head that lingers and leaves good lacing. Smell is of lemon, pepper, yeast, fresh dried grain, light sweetness. Taste is big on sweet citrus, cut down slightly with the spice and finnishing with the tastes of fresh grain and bread. Medium bodied for the style, actively carbonated. A nice, refreshing beer maybe a touch on the sweet side."
"This is a very good drinkable brew, would be excellent for summer or any time of year for that matter."
"Had a couple of tall 20 glasses the other night at paisano's in tr with dinner. Pours a light yellowish gold with a thick, slowly dissipating head. Smell is rather weak as expected in a wheat offering. Tastes of wheat and light hops and i will say this is better on draft than in a bottle although i like it either way! Clean finish. Light mouthfeel and slightly watery and easy to drink a pile of this stuff! Another winner from Bells!"
"This is a refreshing beer appropriate for summer and it went well the the light lunch that accompanied it."
"as APWAs go, this one is quite good (gumballhead might be its only competitor). but i still regularly order other things"
"A pretty good ale, summer ale that is, tasty, doesn't go overboard on anything, but doesn't stand out either, drinkable as well, but not a lot of character. I could def pound a few of these in the summer, but it comes on a little too dry, especially for the type of beer it's trying to be."
"Decent enough new wold wheat ale."
"Overall, this is an easy drinking summer beer. One I like again, after thinking it was too dumbed down for my sophisticated palate. I guess that's a mark of maturity, but don't expect me to accept any BMC soon ;)"
"D- Really easy-drinking beer; great for a nice hot day."
"Overall Oberon has vastly improved in 'heft' and drinkability over the past 5 years or so, (at least to my perception). I go through about a case or so a summer as it is a good 'go to' beer when you have company over/cookout, etc. I bet Bell's will can (12 oz.) this soon. The wheat malt flavor/texture is very good - better than most of this style's competitiors, who seem very thin and very weak."
"D-Overall the beer is very drinkable for the abv it's fermented to. The carbination is high but it, along with the bitterness balances the beer's sweet taste out well."
"D- Love it and I drink it quite often!"
"Pours a cloudy yellow, verging on orange colour with a nice white head. The smell of orange and wheat is quite nice. The taste had orange with some faint lemon with the bready wheat beer flavour. A little bit of hops in the taste too. Very smoothly carbonated and an awesome beer for sitting outside with on a nice day."
"like it say's on the bottle Oberon our summer ale. an American wheat ale with the color and scent of a summer afternoon. This is a delicious beer that is unfiltered and full of flavor, Pours a cloudy amber orange color with a nice rich mouthfeel. Perfect for relaxing on the porch on a summers day."
"Overall, I'm not terribly impressed with Oberon. I've had it a number of times and can't say it has ever really stuck with me. There are many other examples in this and other similar style categories that I'd choose first."
"Drinkability: I could easily have another one. Other than the lack of lacing it's a very drinkable summer ale - perfect for hot days and it goes well with meals and by itself."
"Overall, I was disappointed. The bottle I had last year seemed much better. I had thought about purchasing as six pack of this, but now I don't think I will. I know this beer is loved by many, but its not my favorite."
"Firstly, use caution when pouring this beer! A bit too quick, and you will end up with chunky floaters of protein throughout. It's a lot prettier when its orange and clear with a nice white head that sticks in rings. Smell is light-but-sweet spiced bread with an alcohol flare. Taste was a combo of grapefruit and orange zest, and wheaty, with a certain 'greenness' to it. Body was carbonated well, and the beer finished with some of that particular candy sweetness that I detect from Bells offerings. In the end, crisp and refreshing and quite easy to drink a few."
"D - Very nice! Good ABV, not too strong but not weak by any means. Definitely refreshing and a great summer beer!"
"D: awesome summer quencher from Bell's. Not as flavourful or complex as Three Floyd's Gumballhead, but still a great take on the style."
"This is one of my favorite summer seasonals. It is very drinkable both on tap and out of a bottle. Finishing off a six pack should be no problem. Is a great session beer and I'd recommend it to anyone who's a fan a Pale Wheat Ales."
"Story time: When I turned 21 I was mostly just interested in drinking what was on sale. I thought that ordering a Killian's meant I was going for the quality stuff. Then someone at a party asked if I had ever tried Oberon. I fell in love with it right away, and it lead to Bell's Amber, then that lead to Two Hearted and Kalamazoo Stout and then on to other great brewers and beer. I raise my glass you Larry bell, and... drunk guy at party. You changed my life for the better!"
"An ok beer, but not really my favorite. A little to dry for me"
"Notes: Nice one, nothing to rave about, but very reliable and pleasing, or maybe those are actually reasons enough to rave about even it is not that memorable..."
"Every year, this beer means Spring will soon be Summer!"
"Very drinkable beer."
"D: nicely put together wheat beer, with lots of fruitiness and a pretty prominent malt presence."
"D = just a very solid beer, certainly drinkable, all night long."
"Draught @ The Headkeeper: This one pours a hazy straw-yellow color. There was a bit of a frothy white head on it. It left some lacing. The nose is grassy, floral, and a hint of citrus. The taste is pretty similar. Grassy and floral notes, as well as corn, citrus and some faint wheat. Nice, and fairly refreshing. A good summer beer."
"Had this on tap at a local bar. Served a hazy orangeish yellow with a one finger head. Has a slight fruit smell, maybe some orange. Has a nice refreshing subtle citrus flavor. This is a smooth and refreshing summer beer. I will definitely hvae this again."
"D-I'm not a big fan of the lemon/lime hop profile or of Pale Wheat's it seems. If this beer funds Bell's to continue to make great beers like Two Hearted, and Hopslam though, then so be it."
"D: Very refreshing and not overly sweet or bitter."
"Drinkability: Pretty easy to toss back a couple of these. The fact that no one aspect of this beer sticks out makes it fairly unoffensive to the palate."
"Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. A very refreshing beer that goes well with warm weather."
"Pours golden orange with a thin 1 inch head. Pleasant aroma. Hints of mint (?) and lemon zest. Medium body and carbonation, without any drastic hints of anything. While not incredibly complex, still a very refreshing beer, perfect for throwing back a few on a summer evening. All hail Oberon."
"D - This would be nice to drink for a day out in the sun. Very refreshing and not overly sweet or bitter."
"Medium body, nice carbonation in the mouth. Some sweetness, finishes wet. Some grainy bitterness in back. Its a good summertime light ale for drinking after a hot day."
"A very nice summer beer. Fairly simple, but very enjoyable. Something I would recommend."
"D: I would perfer a 2 Hearted Ale over a Oberon. This is not a bad summer beer. Just personal preference. I had to check this one out, maybe I'll pick it up again next summer."
"D- easy to throw back. Overall not a bad beer. It was good to relax with after mowing the grass."
"Notes - Good mouthfeel that is medium to slightly thin."
"All in all, somewhat underwhelmed given the truly exceptional Bell's product I've had before."
"D- Goes down very easy. Could (and will) drink this all night...."
"Average drinkability. Definitley worth trying, especially on a warm summer afternoon."
"entirely enjoyable, albeit predictable summer wheat. best when ice cold."
"Cheers!"
"D-very drinkable for the summer though not my favorite as I prefer sweeter beers, but glad I tried it"
"M/D - Thin light body is somewhat deceptive given it's ABV. Ends dry and clean. Easy to drink, wish I could get it here easily."
"D: I don't know why it took me so long to try Oberon, but I can see this having a home in my fridge for the duration of summer"
"The beer pours a hazy yellow color with a medium-sized white head. The aroma is wheat, pepper-like spices and citrus. The flavor is heavy on the wheat, black pepper and orange. Reminds me of orange sherbet. Very low bitterness. Low carbonation and a medium, creamy soft mouthfeel. This would be a great beer to drink on a hot summer day."
"d - I think this was an ok wheat ale. The taste was pretty nice but there was nothing to the smell and it looked terrible. I would give it another try though just based off the taste."
"I didn't care much for this category before, but as I try more and more APWA, I just realize I hadn't been drinking the good stuff before."
"the mouthfeel is light with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is excellent, after having this many times this is the only real summer beer I look forward to and continue to drink regularly. Excellent beer overall and by far the best of the style, that I've tried at least."
"I could drink these all day, not a beer I would order at a restaurant but definitely something I would have handy in the fridge for a lazy day."
"Drinkability: As it says on the bottle, ""An American wheat ale with the color and scent of a summer afternoon."" For me, this is a great brew to casually drink on a hot Midwestern summer afternoon. Crisp, refreshing taste, low-medium alcohol content, and there is something brewed in there that just reminds me of summer."
"Right off the bat one can tell this beer is light in the ass. Goldish color fills the glass with minimal head. Decent citrus - orange aroma is present at first sniff Very light malty bitters, on this wheaty ale. Nice carbonation resulting in a very drinkable, spring/summer beer."
"This beer when poured into glass had a nice frothy white head, and was very cloudy. Laced the glass fairly well. This beer does not have a very strong smell, I could not pick up on any hops just from smell, it reminded me of most wheat beers. This beer has a very nice, calm taste. It is balanced and smooth, leading to a high score on the mouthfeel and is all around a very drinkable beer. Certainly a beer worth trying."
"Change the furnace filter, it will be hot before you know it."
"Overall a great drinking lighter style beer that is very enjoyable and very drinkable. Like I said, a sure sign of summer. There is a reason this is my wifes favorite beer, it's just so damn easy to drink. Another winner by Bells."
"D- oberon is on the shelves. summer is almost here. i drink this one often."
"Summertime mainstay in my fridge. Look forward to the release of Oberon every spring."
"Deep hazy orange-yellow. Nice carbonation that steadily feeds the creamy head. Nice lacings on the glass. Light citrusy, orange aromas and flavors. Light hoppy beginning that seems to magnify at the finish. Not as much character as I expected after such a nice pour. Good refreshing carbonation. Very easy to drink. Will make a nice summer picnic ale."
"Drinkability: Medium body with a lighter taste. I definitely could enjoy more than a few."
"For me, this almost defines the hefeweizen, pale wheat style."
"Notes - Light and refreshing body, HUGE flavor."
"D- I could rate this higher but am not going to because I think that after 3 or 4 of these I would want something else. I could drink this all through the summer and like it every time, however, I can't see myself drinking more than a few. I was surprised on the abv on this one."
"A nice beer. Great for summer BBQ's."
"D - Insanely quaffable... A could drink these one right after another without any regret... While there is nothing ""outstanding"" about this beer, it's just solid all the way around and my glass was empty before I knew what happened..."
"This isn't the most complex beer, but the light mouthfeel is actually very welcomed and refreshing. The flavor is very pleasant and easy to drink. I've been doing yardwork all day, and I just took a little Oberon break. Now back to work... And another Oberon in a little while."
"Refreshing beverage that is very good for the style. Probably one of the best Amer. Wheats I've tried."
"Pours a nice golden yellow, like those golden apples. Healthy white head. Aroma had hints of sweet grain mixed with citrus; however, it wasn't too strong. Taste had mixes of citrus, some spice kick to it, hoppy bittnerness going down, and a bready/grainy texture. Could have been a little thicker and better carbonated. Overall a great beer to kick back with."
"This is a pretty good, but an average beer."
"Pour some on your burgers on the grill, too. Adds some fruity, spicy flavor."
"Good easy drinking summer beer. Non destinct smell doesn't measure up to taste. Very appealing color matched by drinkability. Soft aftertaste, small fruit flavors. Some enjoy with an orange I just squeezed a few drops in so actual fruit wouldn't over power taste. Better on tap than bottle. Had 4 on a warm spring night and was very happy with my choice."
"D: Very drinkable and refreshing, pairs well with any seafood or appetizer/salad course or by itself on a hot summer day."
"D- This is one of the quintessential summer ales from the midwest. To me this beer screams back porches, BBQs and lawmowers. I will be seeing lots of this in the months to come"
"I've heard that as a beer, Oberon is basically Bell's flagship summer brew. And while it may not be my favorite genre of beer, I will definitely stand behind my loyalty to Bell's Brewery for making fine beers. Cheers to summer!"
"With the first sips you can already tell this isn't a dangerous beer, but it's also no slouch with some smooth and creamy touches of citrus fruit sliding over the tongue like slippery river water. The orange is clearly the most pronounced flavor, but it's certainly mellow. I've had the beer before at the bar with an orange slice served on the top, and it definitely has a very different flavor profile without the added fruit. But I stand by the assumption that if a brewer wanted it to have more orange flavor, they would have brewed it in.You don't add extra cucumber to a California roll. Even so, the smooth orange flavor gets patted down by the nice wheat and lemon end notes. Where some wheat beers go for the kill, Oberon hangs back and chooses smoothness over chunkiness. If you've ever had a thick and intense wheat beer, then you'll understand what I'm saying."
"tried one fresh as a daisy out of the bottle. a lot better than my keg review. pours a slight hazed yellow/straw with a frothy two finger head with lots of large bubbles and a slowly dissipating froth leaving intense lace and bits of white particles of sediment throughout. smells of strong sour yeast, coriander, sweet clementine, grassy hay, and floral hop aromas. i like how bold it is now that it's fresh, but some of the barnyard funk shows up unpleasantly as it warms, but being an american style wheat, we'll keep it cold. tastes of orange rind bitterness. starts tart with a bold grainy flavor throughout. a bit of a thin body and great carbonation. enjoy fresh!"
"D- Could drink this all day and night, and just reminds you of summer. Refreshing beverage that can't be ignored once it is started. I wait all winter for this beer to be released, Oberon day is the official start of spring for me."
"D-This is one of those perfect summertime beers that you could drink all night if that was your goal and beer was your beverage of choice."
"Just had this on tap at Boston's in Middleton for the Oberon release. This is actually the first time I've had this beer, and it was really good. Reminds me of Leinenkugel's sunset wheat, but a lot better. This will be a great beer to keep around during the summer."
"if more american wheat ales were like this, i'd be happier about the existence of this generally unremarkable ""style""."
"Poured into a plastic cup from a bottle at a Tigers spring training game in Lakeland, Florida. Pours a very cloudy orange. Aroma is very citrus. Tastes mostly like lemon and orange peel. I couldn't drink many of these, as the citrus is a little too overwhelming. As is, its a decent to good white ale."
"Na Zdravje!"
"is the same nothing really stands out. Again some citrus, a little hops. Something like a wheat beer but not quite. Not sure what this is going for. Its a little weak in flavor for a wheat beer. I guess its ok for a summer drinker."
"A decent offering from Bells. Its not bad, it just isn't that special."
"D – I don't care for the style, but as far as the style goes, this is in the middle of the heap."
"D) A nice drink for the summer time... I shouldn't have horded it so long - January is cold!"
"Buy Again? No, there are many better beers in this style."
"This is yet another nice Bell's offering. I really enjoy it and wish it was more available. Would be great on a hot summers day."
"Drinkability: Great flavor and low body makes this the perfect summer beer. The keg offered at Meijer's is a great idea for a party."
"D: Great example of an American wheat. Great flavor and character compared to all the other bland wheats around. If this was available in CT, it would be a staple in my fridge throuhout the summer."
"Pours a hazy yellow color,has a nice head that does lace and lingers,I think this beer is a tad thin some wheat and malt and hop balance a hint of lemon zest but I was not impressed,I could drink this beer all day then never miss it again,its by no means bad but just unimpressive and a tad overpriced,I guess ya call this a gateway beer I suppose its a heavy hitter in the summer months"
"D - Very drinkable, especially in the hot summer sun. Not sure why I choose to review this in January."
"Oberon is a very satisfying, quenching type of beer, easily a very nice summer drinker. As it is it's tasty enough here at the start of Winter! As with all Bell's beers, highly recomended."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable a brew that appeals more in warmer times. I could have four. Slightly complex for the style. Solid, but I like other Bells brews better."
"Notes: A classic, american session beer that everyone should try."
"This is available year round in FL. Pours a very hazy orange, one finger white head, clump of sediment that quickly settles. Smell: lightly toasty and buttery, wheat, fruity and ever so slightly citric. (but a little too buttery). Taste: again, wheaty and buttery, spicy hops, citrus oils - lemon and orange. Tangy, fluffy-ish feel, spicy drying finish (kind of rye like, maybe caraway?). This was actually pretty good. Bottled Dec 1, 2009."
"Thoughts- this beer is a nice brew, and I could session it in the summer time, but it is not the biggest on the flavor department."
"D: Not a bad beer.... but not anything special either. It is quite drinkable and would not be to bad after a nice hot summer day."
"Perhaps drinking this one in the middle of December isn't doing this beer justice. Given that, I'm sure it""d be excellent on warm summer day."
"Palate has a lightly sweet wheat component with balancing citrus to give it some complexity. Finish is somewhat fruity-tart, in a good way, and is rather easy drinking."
"Pours a cloudy pale orange. Small head that disappears into a thin film. Spots of lacing on the glass. Smells of honey, malt and a tad of pineapple. Tastes sweet and citrusy with a malt backbone. Quite refreshing. Mouthfeel is nice on the carbonation front, but I can't help the feeling that this is a little too syrupy. It's light and sweet and quite easy to drink a bunch. Where are the hops? Perhaps faded away as this beer is a summer seasonal. I'd love to have it super fresh."
"This is a must try for someone who thinks Blue Moon is the best beer out there. Similar to BM but lots better."
"It's definitely a great summertime beer. I plan to buy more of this and make this more of my go-to session ""lawnmower"" beer when the seasons change."
"Drinkability: Sessionable."
"D: High, very drinkable on those spring/fall warm nights."
"Overall good. I'm not sure if this is a bad bottle, but I've been more impressed by this beer in the past before I tried to review it."
"A very refreshing beer."
"Drinkability: Overall a tasty brew. It has a great mouthfeel, and a nice sweet taste to it. Definitely a beer you can enjoy throughout the whole night. Not my top choice in styles, but good nonetheless."
"Not really my style, although Bell's is one of my fave breweries. Well made, good wheat flavor. An orange probably goes better with it than a lemon, if you're into that kind of thing. I think there's plenty of citrus flavor already in it, and an appreciable degree of wheat, soft body, easy enough to drink. One of the best representations of a wheat beer, and certainly the best east of Sierra Nevada that I can think of."
"Huge rocky head served from a jockey box at the Big Pour in Scottsdale. eventually settled down. Color is golden with a slightly orange tint. The aroma is very fruity. Definantly an ale with a nice citrus note. The taste is simply that of a fruiity wheat beer. I am sure it is going to be a big hit here in Arizona, the girl pouring it said it would be available year round in Arizona starting next month. Mouthfeel is pleasantly light. There is a citrusy lemony note which is prominent but not overpowering Aftertaste is bready and clean."
"Drinkability: I would have this again and recommend this to someone who wants a relatively light bodied wheat andmalt profile and simple flavored ale with little aftertaste."
"Taste has some characteristics of a typical American wheat ale, but has a creamy, yeasty flavor that reminds me of a German hefe without the banana and cloves. There is a definite, but soft hop flavor and just enough bitterness to finish clean and easy. Leaves nary a hint of aftertaste. This is one amazing summer beer and one I would buy by the case if it were to be available in Texas. Deee-licious!"
"This is not a session beer but so what? Summer's past and I'm still enjoying this just as much as when I had the rest back in August. Judging by the number of reviews on here, a lot of people have given this a shot and it seems to have enough fans on here. If I could find it on tap again, I'd have it in a heartbeat. This bottled version of it didn't quite live up to the memories I had of quaffing this in the Bay State."
"Bottle from the brewery. Refreshing, particularly in Indian Summer day. Pleasant malty aroma on a medium yellow body with a lot of white creamy head, that leaves droplets of lace. Creamy mouthfeel, easy drinking above average mouthfeel. Pleasant beverage throughout, wheat well integrated, mild bitterness that finishes a tad sweet from wheat."
"Just as good out of the bottle into a pilsner as it is on-tap."
"Pours a golden amber color with noticeable sediment floating througout. Frothy 2 finger head and sticky lacing along the sides of the pint glass. Smells of sweet citrus and plenty of wheat and field greens. Taste isn't nearly as strong as the nose. Much sweeter than other wheat beers but still has the earthy tones that keeps me coming back to this style. Only complaint would be the taste is a little too watery for a bottle conditioned ale. Mouthfeel is pretty think. Drinkability is high for the right time of the year while middle of October isn't that."
"D- I would say med to high drink ability nice flavor"
"D - I had a difficult time getting through this one. Obviously its a popular beer but something in the yeast is really killing it for me."
"The body was good, solid but light. Drinkability was very good, I could see draining a sixer on a summer afternoon with no trouble. Overall, a very good beer and if it were regularly available to me, it would be in my regular rotation."
"MF&D - a very carbonated medium light body. quite drinkable, but no where near my first choice if I want a wheat beer."
"D: Quite high."
"My only issue was that I did not notice a huge change from bottle to tap. I was expecting to be blown away, but it was the same beer I always had. Either way, this is a great American summer beer."
"Drinkability-Pretty light feel to this thing and multi-dimensional enough to stay interesting. This thing definitely drinks with ease."
"This is insanely drinkable and probably the best American Pale Wheat I've ever had. I often feel like APWs come off as a poor man's hefeweizen, but this brew is a cut above and has a taste that is all its own."
"Super drinkable, I'd order it on a deck somewhere, waiting on a some bbq!"
"D- Oberon is self billed as having ""the color and scent of a sunny afternoon", whereas I would say it is more like a cool, bright, & crisp summer morning where the dew is still on the grass and sunglasses aren't quite needed. I have enjoyed this summer after summer in bottles,in mini kegs, and on tap. Oberon is one of my top 5 summer brews, and I will be looking forward to it next summer."
"Very drinkable beer, this beer is amazing after a round of golf on a warm day. Very nice example of the style."
"Served up on draft at Tom's Oyster Bar in Detroit, right near the tunnel. Two finger beige head sat atop a light gold body. Smell of orange, light citrus. Taste was slightly sweet, apricot, mandarin orange with bitterness most pronounced in mid-swallow. Finish is rather dry. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel is a delight, balanced just about right. Overall, rather good stuff and pretty interesting wheat beer, I can see why this has such a strong local following this time of year."
" My mouth is watering. Get Some!!!"
"Pretty decent, an easy beer to drink a few of. Worth trying."
"A nice summer orange color, topped with a thin head. There is a citrus aroma that is obvious upon poor (sorta like Blue moon). However, the taste is more refined with hints of orange and other citrus. The beer itself has a nice feel in the mouth and goes with a variety of dishes. I like this beer out of the bottle very much, so it it did not disappoint me on draft."
"The taste on the other hand is a little more complex then most beers, its main feature is the fruity notes. Though this isn't a beer I'd buy often it is a beer everybody should try. Its a good beer by itself and would be something that would go good with food, especially being that its particularly sweet."
"Quite pleasant. Thumbs up on this offering."
"D - Oberon is a great summer beer, no doubt about it. Simple and easy to drink, especially during the warm weather months."
"Poured orange with yeast suspended all over the place and a tiny head that immediately disappeared. The aroma was not much, my nose has let me down again. The taste? I liked this and I generally shy away from beers that have the word wheat anywhere in their description. Lightly sweet, lightly lemon with no bitterness, no aftertaste. Mild, pleasant. Medium bodied, with all the yeast, a fair amount of carbonation. Drinkability is excellent. Especially in the summertime."
"D: Easy to drink, pleasant but not all that enticing to make me want another. It's nice enough."
"The mouth is creamy, but with a nice touch of carbonation on the tongue. This is a very flavorful, unoffensive beer. Nice buttery flavors mix with a sweet backbone. This is bready as all get out. I really like this one. Great for the summer. I will definitely get this again...and again."
"This beer pours a nice orange- copper color with a one and a half finger fluffy white head that leaves ample amounts of sticky lacing down the sides of the glass. Aroma of yeast and hops with a slight fruitiness. Taste is mainly of tart, citrusy fruits, orange most notably. There are some undertones of grainy malts with a strong dollop of corriander. Medium body, medium carbonation, clean, smooth, nice beer to sit with for a night."
"D - Refreshing great summer beer!"
"D - Could drink all day long, great summer beer."
"D - This is a highly drinkable beer. Although it is technically at the outerlimit to be a session beer, the alcohol is barely noticeable. This is a beer that can be drank in mass during the hotter times of the year. IMO, it is a session beer."
"PS: I've tried this beer with sediment mixed in as well. This obviously changed the character of the beer, but it was just as enjoyable. Try it both ways."
"D: I've had better wheat beers, but this is a pretty decent example of a good one for the Summer. I'd have it again."
"For a wheat beer, this one has more flavor than many I've had."
"D- A good summer brew, not my favorite, but by no means bad...definitley one you could find yourself drinking over and over on a hot day..."
"Pours a slightly cloudy, straw color with a fluffy white head that lingers. Some very faint spicy aroma but not much else. Taste was bland with not much going on. Some pepper notes and some mild bitterness. Light-bodied. A somewhat uninteresting and non-descript beer."
"I could drink a good bit of this while enjoying the insane humidity of the gulf coast. Excellent wheat ale."
"D- The lemon in this beer is a little heavy for me. It certainly is not bad, but I can only enjoy that heavy lemon taste so much. Great for a summer day though when you just want to sit back, relax, and enjoy a nice beer."
"Among my friends, Oberon has become almost synonymous with summer. Minikegs of Oberon, which are only available in the summertime, are essential for any barbeque, camping trip or casual get together. I have yet to try a better summer wheat beer."
"D - High drinkability and smooth quaffability - perfect ale for summer since it is light in mouthfeel but not light on flavor."
"Not exactly complex in its flavor, this beer is straightforward, delicious, and outrageously drinkable. An exceptionally easy going summer session beer and would probably have a broad appeal to macro drinkers as well. I would certainly pick this up from time to time if it were available in my area, esp. on hot summer days with friends."
"Overall, I like this beer for what it is. It is very simple and refreshing for a hot summer day. I could drink more of this."
"The color of the ale is reminicent of a summer evening as the sun starts to set. A fiery orange color with the creamy white head acting like the last of the cumulus clouds in the summer sky. The aroma is floral with fuity notes and allows the hops to present themselves but not overpowering. The taste is citrusy and sweet perhaps the hop flavor gets lost a little in the malt but I won't argue. Perfect to drink when it is not too cold, but still above room temperature just to take the heat of the summer day away."
" I like it best when very cold. Oddly enough, I like this beer best from the bottle. I know this will be unpopular with most BA's but try it from both vessels before cursing me."
"One of my first beers by Bell's Brewery. Poured a cloudy orangish shade. I have heard this beer is sometimes cloudy and sometimes clear. It's a decent beer with with light citrus notes. Im normally not a big fan of wheat in beer but this beer has is very well balanced and I must admit, I like it. Very foamy head and it stays around for a while. Even though it's not one of my favorites, i will be trying more from Bell's."
"D: Easy drinking. Starts to get a bit heavy after a few though. Maybe not quite a session beer, but it may be for some. This beer has a great reputation in the midwest and deservedly so. Even those who are not attracted to craft beer will probably like this one."
"It taste orangey, hoppy in the bottle, light coriander and a tad bitter at the end. This is summer sessional, but a decent one at that."
"Drinkability- very drinkable I think I could drinka mini keg to myself on my day off, haha"
"Easy to drink. Let's hop on the mower."
"D- Drinkable as any pale wheat beer with the help of smooth and refreshing flavor that masks the 5.8% alcohol content. Great summer wheat ale."
"Exceptionally smooth and drinkable! This should be every wheat lover's summer staple beer!"
"D- Easy as pie. I usually don't go for APWA all that much because I find them boring, but this has a bit more going for it in terms of flavor. The alcohol is low which keeps me coming back for more."
"D - if this were available around me, I'd be stoked to pick this up for a summer seasonal."
"A remarkably drinkable summertime treat."
"D: I used to kick back during undergrad summers in Michigan with a couple of these. This brings back memories of vibrant sunny days without a care in the world. Even now, drinking a few bottles (wherever I can find them) changes my outlook on life, no matter how down I feel at that moment. This is a wonderful beer by Bell's, and should be more widespread in distribution."
"Great summer beer from Bell's."
"Oberon poured from the bottle a cloudy, golden orangey color with a rapidly fading white head. Nicely carbonated, with little bubbles dancing about and nice mouthfeel. The flavor is smooth, with nice hops presence that is flavorful but not overpowering. Exceedingly tasty. And dangerously drinkable."
"This beer confuses me. The look was a solid, dark yellow beer with a thick foam head. The smell was wheat and citrus. I'm thinking of a breakfast bed. The beer was thick and the foam was velvety. The drinkitbility was okay for its thickness. However, the taste was terrible. A quick slam of semi-sweet citrus that is too heavy on the lemon. The beer ends with an unbalanced bitterness for more than half of the drink. Maybe I got a bad mini-keg."
"Bottom Line: A good summery beer, nothing amazing but definetly something worth trying. Ta ta."
"Pours a cloudy orange color with a nice one and a half finger head. The aroma of he beer is of citrus and wheat. The taste is much of the same it is of citrus and wheat. The beer had an orange placed in it which threw off my sense of taste a little bit after my initial first couple of sips. The mouthfeel was very little to no carbonation. Overall this is a very refreshing beer. You could drink alot of these on a warm summer day, it does have a very good flavor to it."
"Hazy blonde with tons of suspended yeast particles visable and a nice creamy white head that leaves some fine lacing behind as it melts. The nose is mild and consists of wheat malt and a bit of orange zest. The flavor is pretty much like the smell with just a little bit of spiciness. Light bodied with mild carbonation. It's a shame, I really used to look forward to this beer in the summer and it was one of the first beers that really turned me on to craft beer in the first place. Oberon is still a fine beer but I think my palate has changed over the years and it just doesn't do it for me anymore, but it did turn me on to all the other great offerings from Bell's."
"D: Very drinkable, very refreshing. A great summer beer."
"The bottle said something about it tasting or smelling like a sunny day and i cant help but agree; this is one of the best wheats i've tried."
"Bell's Oberon Ale is a clear, bright golden ale with a thin white head that fades to a film and leaves nice lacing. It has a spicy hop aroma; floral, resiny and a touch sweet. Nice. A note of honey lingers in the nose. It has a creamy, chewy medium body and a dry, slightly acidic finish. It's a crisp and bitter flavor, like citrus tea with a biscuity backbone. It's a bold and proper use of wheat."
"What great beer. This beer is a beautiful orange color. It almost matches the label on the bottle. Decent amount of head that lasts well past the first few gulps. The aroma reminds me of juicy fruit gum. So fruity almost candy like. Then there's the flavor. Like a burst of oranges and lemons with hints of grassy wheat. It tastes like juicy fruit too. I enjoy how this dances on my tongue then finishes semi dry. I've been known to crush several of these at one sitting so to say it's very drinkable would be an understatement. I will go on record and say I love this beer."
"The palate detects a sweet honey taste that drops off to a minimal bitterness. There is a spicy aftertaste, as well. A very light quaff for any warm summer evening. Of course, not one for a cold Michigan winter. Larry has other brews for that."
"This is one of my favorite summer beers. It's tasty and refreshing, with plenty of flavor for a summer beer but also very sessionable. A real winner."
"Not a bad choice from Bell's...not my favorite American Pale Wheat Ale but certainly a solid choice for the summer time!"
"Medium body; extremely drinkable. Definitely one of the best summer beers I've had. I am no longer resentful of the insane marketing and omnipresence of this beer. All of its accolades and its popularity are well-deserved. I'm glad I can appreciate this brew again (not so hops-crazed anymore). Brings back good memories."
"Pours a nice cloudy (and chunky!) golden yellow. Head disapates to a thin fizzy one. Not much going on in the nose. Wheat and yeast with a little citrus. Taste is nice. Citrus with sweet malt and hops in the background... almost subdues. This beer seems to be a very basic example of the style. Though it does have a little spice in the background... it is a bland beer. Nothing really interesting enough to make me excited to drink this. Worth a try though."
"Again, probably enjoyed best outdoors on a nice sunny day -"
"Cloudy golden hue, from the floating particulates and swirling yeast. Very light carbonation with no head retention or lacing. Has a very homebrewed aroma. Light hopping, present more through bittering than aroma. The more subtle fruit flavors of the wheat are masked by the bitterness. I would have preferred less bittering to allow the wheat/fruit flavors be more pronounced. Not really what I think of when I want a summer seasonal, but a pretty good, interesting beer nonetheless."
"Sets up well, easy to drink. You can 'drink' this beer; nice if your havin' 1 or several... /thumbs up"
"drinkability is great - this is just what you what out of a summer seasonal - i dont think i would drink this beer much if it was a year round beer outside of summer but they dont and it hits the spot on hot summer days"
"Overall, an interesting and unique take on pale wheat ales. Refreshing yet tasty."
"3.5 D: This is incredibly smooth and not bad, but it is a little boring. Still, I wouldn't mind having a few every once in a while."
"mid body. adequate carbonation. i have always been a fan of this beer."
"I first had Oberon in May as part of a beer dinner at the Porter Beer Bar in Atlanta. I was not expecting much, wheat beers (or ales) not being my ""thing"". Man, was I surprised. Poured on tap into a pint glass, this beer is a cloudy pale orange - really quite lovely in its own right. The aroma was somewhat fruity, but not hoppy. I didn't spend too much time on admiring it, however, and tasted it - wow, talk about being blown away. This beer is simply so much more full flavored than any other wheat beer I've tasted, and perfectly balanced. Just when you think it might start to be a bit cloying, the bitterness kicks in and vice versa - a very ""clean"" tasting beer. I liked it so much I pretty much finished the pint before the actual appetizer course was served (Molly at the Porter was kind enough to ""top off"" my glass when it was). On top of all this, my wife, who is NOT a big beer drinker, truly loved it - the first time I've known her to really LOVE a beer. Since the dinner, I've purchased this in a six pack. While not quite as tasty as on draught, still a wonderful and refreshing beer to have at home."
"Pour was a cloudy yellow/orange color into my glass with about two inches of fluffy head. Scent was a bit mild. Citrus with an almost sugary hint. I was really looking forward to this beer as fellow user buschbeer really likes it among many other favorable reviews. However, I was pretty disappointed. Wheat and light citrus flavors (maybe even a hint of cardboard), but I felt it was pretty bland. Carbonation was just right. This isn't hateful, but I've certainly had better wheats."
"Very well balanced, great for the warm weather. I can drink one after another - the carbonation is just right and the finish is sharp and clean."
"Best summer session beer. Period. To be enjoyed on a hot day, and if you get this one on tap, it tastes twice as good as out of the bottle. One of my all time favorites."
"d- pretty drinkable, i could have a few of these, you can't really tell the 5.8% only a little in the dry finish."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is creamy, touch astringent, and slightly carbonated. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium. This one of my most hated styles of beer. I have not been able to find a good respresentive, until now. This is a nice pale wheat ale, it has great flavor, a good head and clean finish."
"Overall: This is one of my favorite beers. It is immediately replaced whenever I run out. I love the balance and flavors in this beer on a summer day. I squealed in enjoyment when I saw the sticker at the liquor store saying it was back, and I don't squeal often. Perfect outdoor beer (which is why I almost always pick up a pitcher when at the UW Terrace). If you haven't had this beer yet, GET IT!"
"Carbonation is moderate and adds to the refreshing character of this beer. Medium bodied, at best, this is an extremely drinkable brew. At an 5.8% ABV, I'd go ahead and session this on a hot summer day. A fantastic brew to grill out with, or just sit and enjoy good company."
"very drinkable, but the ABV makes me stop around 3 or 4 in one sitting...the nice mix of a light body and subtle flavoring add to it's refreshing taste"
"From the bottle into a pint glass it pours a hazy light orange color with a one finger white head. Leaves some lacing down the glass. The smell is yeast, wheat, hint of spices, nothing amazing but a little above average for the style. The taste is pretty good, I'm not huge on wheats but I do enjoy them. This one has the taste of wheat, kind of citrusy, overall pretty refreshing and crisp. Easily drinkable, I could do this one all day especially on a nice summer day. Compared to some other wheat ales/pale wheat ales I think this is one of the better ones I've had. I'll hopefully be getting this one more often this summer."
"Served: in a weizen glass."
"Very drinkable. Flavorful enough that every sip is pleasant, but not so in-your-face flavorful as to make every sip a chore to decipher. I can nail down the flavors in a few sips, then sit back and simply enjoy them while I finish the glass."
"Overall - Very clean refreshing brew. Although a little weak in flavor, it's definitely a beer that would appeal to a lot of people."
"Drinkability is ok, easy enough to suck down, but I still don't like the style, and would always rather have something with more flavor. And that sharp mouthfeel doesn't work for me at all."
"D- Simple drinking, refreshing summer brew. Definite session here."
"Nice, slightly citrusy smell, not overpowering. Taste isn't overpowering with citrus either, the way some wheat beers are. You can taste the wheat in this one, but it's very balanced - I wouldn't necessarily have called this a wheat beer if I hadn't known (and I'm not a wheat beer fan, so that's a positive.) Surprisingly mild taste if anything, but it sticks with you for a good long time. Seems a bit heavy, so not a great score in drinkability, but overall a real solid beer, for wheat fans and otherwise."
"my first bells offering, not overly impressed but am glad they finally made it to georgia, can't wait to try some of their other highly touted beers"
"Drinkability: This beer is insanely smooth and is by far my favorite session beer. It is also the beer that has converted quite a few of my friends to like better beer."
"On Tap at Porter's Pub in easton, Pa. Nice 1 finger head with smells of wheat and grass. Taste is very good and slightly creamy, yet crisp. This is a beer that could be sessioned on a hot summer day with ease. Mouthfeel is very good and lets you know you are drinking something better than most. This beer does exactly what Bell's wanted it to. Another top quality offering by Bell's."
"Aroma is strong, malty, yeasty, very inviting. It pours a clear straw-yellow - not inspiring, but at least the white head is nice and thick and hangs around for a bit. Flavor is fairly strong and refreshing, if not complex - malty with a wheaty undertone and a touch of fruit. Texture is smooth and just a little fizzy."
"D: This is a drinkable, lightweight summer beer. Not to be confused with much more complex beers, but solid nonetheless."
"Pours a cloudy, yellowish color, almost like grapefruit juice. Has a puffy white head that thins, but then lasts. Orange and citrus aroma with faint hop and yeast notes. Light bodied, crisp with citrusy flavors and a slightly sweet aftertaste. Very refreshing. One of the best summer beers ever brewed."
"Pours a nice cloudy yellow colour with a lovely white frothy head. Smell is very strong of wheat; perhaps a llittle grassy. Smells refreshing. Flavour is actually much more bitter than one would think. It's a nice, well-crafted, refreshing beer, but I don't hold it in the same regards as many other folks do. Still a good Summer beer, though."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium with plenty of carbonation. Overall this is a well crafted beer and is nice company on a warm day. I just don't understand the hype associated with it. Still very nice."
"Beat wheat beer i have had to date."
"Overall: I like this version of the American Pale Wheat Ale. Most APWA overdose on the hops, this lets the flavors shine through. Well done Bells!"
"D - Refreshing & nice. Nothing overwhelming, good summer drinking beer. Very nice."
"drinkability- I'm very glad that Athens georgia now carries bell's beer as of 5-11-09. I've hear so much from my friend who lives a few miles from their brewery. I've recommended it to all my friends"
"I had had this brew on tap many times before and loved it! Maybe this bottle wasn't the best, but this is a damn fine beer. I go against the grain on this one, and recommend it to be drank as cold as possible. Despite this bottle, I know that this is a solid summer offering from Bell's...and one that is hard to beat!"
"D - Goes down easy"
"This is a great summer ale, wonderfully simple yet complex, very drinkable. Bell's has yet to disappoint me."
"The best of the summer beers. I am a stout / dark beer enthusiast, but during the summer, this is as good as it gets. I love the flavor, not light, not too much citrus, it is great for a really hot summer day."
"Drinkability: Great, I could go to a bar and drink this beer all night. It's not too sweet and the citrus isn't too powerful. All around good beer."
"All in all. A fantastic beer! I recommend it highly."
"M - Medium bodied, fair carbonation, smooth, pleasant."
"Notes: A very memorable beer with a memorable taste. Great for warm weather or even the fall season. I had it while in Philly and I wish I could find it in NYC."
"D: It doesn't jump out at you, but then beers of this style probably aren't designed to. So, so drinkable. A lovely summer beer. One of the few Bell's beers that lives up to the considerable hype, in my mind."
"Light/medium body with mild carbonation, good and drinkable."
"D: Easy, light."
"D - Overall, this is a mild tasting beer that is easy to drink. It's not my favorite wheat beer, but it does hit the intended target of being a good summertime beverage."
"Overall this is a very good wheat beer, my only qualm being that it's very close to being overly sweet. Still, worth a shot on a hot day."
"Mouthfeel is good.. a touch over-carbonated but otherwise fine. And the drink itself is interesting enough that a few of these is not out of the question."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable."
"D- Great Drinkability."
"D - Extremely drinkable due to the light flavors and body. Complex and delicious as well though."
"For what it's worth I don't like wheat beers and I liked this one. Goes good with a sunny day."
"12oz. Batch #9055. Poured a cloudy yellow with a very slight hue of orange. Some particulates with a foamy white head. Aromas are of grass, wheat, lemon, and yeast. Tastes are similar - wheat, lemon rind, dried grass, with a nice balanced hop finish. Really nothing wrong here, but Oberon has never really wowed me like other Bell's offerings."
"Drinkability: Very high - the light feel and subtle flavors make it refreshing and easy to down. I prefer the ST Hop Sun or the 3F Gumballhead in this style, but this one is definitely solid and worth a try."
"I could drink quite a few pints of oberon, one of the better summer beers I have had."
"its popular for a reason...def. pick up a six pack for any upcoming trip to the beach and enjoy on the back porch around late afternoon....you'll think me later if you do..."
"While Oberon is definitely a leader in the light summer beer class, I'm pretty sure that it essentially holds its popularity on the basis of bridging the gap between lighter and full flavored beers. Nothing special, simply a nice tasting, easy-to-drink ale that has its place firmly in the heart of the Michigan faithful."
"Drinkability is good, however, I personally prefer a German Hefe or Belgian Wit over the American Wheat style. I would like to cook with it however, A nicely spiced, gingered Thai noodle dish, or very must Muenster cheese would marry beautifully into this brew This is a good offering, and now that it's finally avaliable in SC I see myself buying this brew in the hot summer months ahead."
"D- I'm going to have to give this a try on tap since I was definately a bit let down by the bottle. I am typically happy with Bell's brews but this one didn't really win me over."
"Another solid offering from Bell's, and another of their brews that make it to the top of it's class."
"D 4.0 - I dig this for a seasonal Bell's offering. I am always excited when it comes out in the spring!"
"Very crisp and refreshing. Easy drinker. Body doesn't seem as light as most wheats. Very smooth."
"Overall, Oberon is a tap Beer."
"Drinkability: I'm not sure how often I'd dish out the money for an Oberon. I think there are some better priced wheat beers for the quality. I'm glad I tried it though, and I'm sure it will make an appearance somewhere in my coming Summer."
"D: This is really an exceptional American wheat. Maybe not the best, but definitely an icon. Tastes kind of like a pilsner/wheat hybrid with the saaz hops. I like my American wheats with a bit more citrus character, but this beer is great in other ways. It has elements that please the beer geek, but at the same time may lure over a non-craft beer drinker. I will continue to enjoy this summer after summer."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. It would be easy to have several of these."
"D- A solid wheat beer somewhat inconsistent when compared with years past. Worth trying and solid summer drinker."
"D- Good session beer."
"Poured a hazy yellow/orange color with moderate white head. White particles floating throughout. Light malt. Aroma of citrus - grapefruit,orange,tangerine, pear, peach. One or more of those, I cannot decide. More citrus than wheat for me. Flavor of grain, citrus. Easy, smooth finish. Very easy going down. Not overly flavorful - all the aromas and flavor are subtle, and that is no necesarily a bad thing. IMO a very good summer session beer."
"On tap at The World of Beer. The beer was a hazy yellow color with a thick white head that left a good deal of lacing. It had a grassy/outdoors aroma, with a little citrus. Lemony citrus taste, some malt. The beer was medium-bodied, very refreshing. Would be a great beer on a hot summer day."
"D- Being in Texas, summer lasts 7 months here. If I had access, this could possibly be my summer go to beer."
"Pours a clear, lightly hazed golden yellow, thin white head forms, quickly settles to a thin ring around the glass, few spots of lace stick, looks pretty good. Smell is neat, malty, some wheat, kind of vegetal, citrusy, some light floral, lightly fruity, some biscuit malt, light honey/caramel sweetness. Taste is biscuity, malty and sweet, some honey, wheat, light floral, lightly yeasty, light bit of veggie, bit of citrus, otherwise unexciting. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, refreshing and drinkable if not doing a whole lot for me. Thanks Larry!"
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Very light and crisp and not nearly as carbonated as I was expecting."
"Drinkability: One of the ultimate summer beers, even though it could use a little more depth. Easy to keep drinking on a nice warm Minnesota day."
"D- I could drink this as a nice session beer when hanging out with friends sitting on the porch during a warm day. It is to my liking but something says that they might have changed this beer up a little bit over the years."
"Bright almost backlit appearance, orange color. Medium head and carbonation. Delectably earthy, mostly morel combined with a hint of citrus smell. Clean, crisp, semi-dry taste...no lasting aftertaste. Light to medium, smooth mouth feel. Easily my current favorite domestic ale."
"Overall a tasty wheat ale."
"This feels like the grandson of hopslam and the son of two hearted, I'll be continually drinking this for sure."
"D = This is a pleasant beer that would make a good bbq beer."
"D- This is a delicious summer beer, highly refreshing and crisp. I didn't notice the 5.8% ABV either. I can definitely see myself picking this up over the summer for hanging out by the pool and grilling."
"Very sessionable beer, easy to drink. Ill be buyin some more of this during the summer for sure!"
"Cheers!"
"Overall, this is a great summer beer. I enjoyed it on a warm evening after being outside for a good part of the day. I've never been a huge fan of wheat beers, so I couldnt finish all of the 6 pack in a sitting. But a very good beer to have one or two at a time."
"Drinkability: Overall, I would agree with an older post here; it's a good beer to drink on a warm day when you don't quite feel up to drinking a macrolager and somewhat enjoyable. However, I don't believe the cost justifies the taste. I don't think I'd ever buy a 6 pack to myself, but I'd go half and half with some a friend on it, put it in a created six pack or have it on tap at two locations that I know carries it."
"Overall this is a great beer for the a seasonal state. Warm weather needs oberon."
"This one came with a bit of hype, but I'm glad I tried it. It's very refreshing, and not like other beers of the same style which seem to over-do the citrus characteristics. Very drinkable."
"If you had your pick between this and a hop-sun, I would go with the hop-sun."
"I will admit I'm not the biggest fan of wheat beers, but as far as they go this would be towards the top of my list."
"Decent summer beer from Bell's. This one would be a good choice for a summer picnic where you just can't bring yourself to serve a macro lager, as no-one will be put off by this."
"D: A very nice summer beer and one that is quite sessionable indeed. My gateway beer to the craft world."
"Finish is surprisingly smooth and"
"Top notch for a style I'm usually really not crazy about. It's odd, but it actually reminded me more of an abbey singel crossed with a wheat beer."
"Pours an outstanding, craggy head. True spotting down the glass. Opaque throughout the glass. Smells of fruity esthers, wheat and tangy banana. All the fun ceased for a bit, as it was very hoppy. I was expecting wheat and banana. Tasted like an APA, maybe a bad bottle? Was fresh and crispy, just not a true american ""wheat"" ale. However, very crisp, light and easy to drink. I would have rated it higher if it had been an APA."
"D-Highly drinkable. Danger: you will want another while lounging outdoors on a beautiful summer afternoon."
"This one's very sessionable and a good brew all around."
"Recommended"
"D: This has session written all over it and is the perfect outdoor brew. It doesn't fill you up, but it will satify your tastebuds."
"Mouthfeel is really close to perfect but loses me on the carbonation which is a bit too high. kinda dry but crisp and refreshing. Oxy-moron I know but some how it pulls it off. Drinks incredibly easy especially on a hot day. Truly a great beer and I look forward to it's next release."
"drinkability is very high, wheat beers are my favorite session beers."
"m&d: light mouthfeel, extremely drinkable"
"Conclusion: Great beer overall, would definitely recommend this beer to anyone. Being in college it isn't a beer i would be able to buy year round, however it would be on my list for when I have some extra spending money and looking for a good relaxing beer. Bell's sure knows how to brew their beer TRY IT!"
"D - I could see making an afternoon out of this beer easily, but I'd prefer a classic hefe to this."
"Drinkability: Yes, yes, a thousand times, yes. Hot day, glass of Oberon? Yes yes yes. Seriously, though, it's quite drinkable, almost sessionable."
"D- Easy going down and a nice example of the style. Highly drinkable."
"Oberon has a nice appearance. It is pale, straw in color with a pretty large white head. It smells like wheat and lemons. The flavor and mouthfeel are fairly light but it has a nice lemon and sweet malt flavor. It has a decent drinkability mainly because it has, ""the color and scent of a summer afternoon"". That qoute pretty much says it all, it is good for what it is."
"easy to drink, really delicious for the style an expressive of the summer beer that fills your mouth with an easy time."
"Amazingly refreshing, citrusy, and fruity. Definitely one of the best ""summer"" beers I've had. For what it is and sets out to be, this beer is great."
"D - I feel that this is one of the better seasonal summer brews, and would recommend everyone to try."
"D- Yes, this beer completely fulfills my spring desire to have a nice refreshing balanced beer. I have always liked Oberon when I'm in the mood for a solid American Wheat...this one is top notch."
"Thin, bone white head, mixture of bubble sizes, dissipates swiftly, equally light lacing. Light cloudy yellow color, opaque in spite of lightness, does have that gauzy summertime look to it. The nose at once anchors itself solidly in your nostrils and spaces out the scents to avoid the kind of density which makes it seem blockish, soft spoken lemon peel, wheat germ, white bread, pinch of sweetish baking spices, more so offers an unassuming earthiness. Medium-bodied, holds onto its weight throughout, from the first sip balance and restraint are clearly among its hallmarks. The wheat, oat, bread dimension round and without greenness, some residual sweetness in the orange, lemon citrus, surely doesn't require an actual wedge. Cinnamon, nutmeg, coriander spice unobtrusively present. Perhaps some apricot or peach fruit notes. Even the carbonation is demure, if there's any real complaint it may actually be tactful to a fault. Cleans up well through the finish."
"D: Unique and refreshing. Recommended."
"D: Will pick more up to quaff this summer. Strangly reminds me of a Wit, but heavier, tastier."
"Pours an ever so slightly hazy golden amber with lots of bubbles rising to the top into a short-living white head that dissipates to a swirl and ring quickly leaving traces of lacing. Aroma is sweet with bready wheat balance with the citrus hops with lemons and oranges. Taste follows the aroma with the big wheat backbone up front and a slight hop bitterness in the finish with mainly citrus. A hint of spices show up in the taste that I didn't get in the smell. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with tons of carbonation, good summer drinking."
"I have heard great things about this one so I wanted to give it a try. At first pour I am getting a nice sweet aroma, not too much head and it receeds slowly. Like the scent, a nice sweet taste, some yeast. Slightly hazy but nothing I did not like. Light body. Overall a good beer from Bell's. I would probably go out and buy this again, great for nice summer days in rainy Ohio."
"Mouth feel is bright and the body is very light. Very drinkable and a wonderful session beer. Not too bad at all."
"Notes: a great, light, fruity hefeweizen for warm summer days"
"D-Fantastic. I cant wait until the weather heats up a bit so I can cool down with this. I feel like I could drink this from the bottle too and still enjoy it if I am at a park or something. Lived up to the hype for me."
"It came highly recommended and I can see why."
"The nose is sweet and quite pleasing, as is the taste and a fantastic example of the style. Nothing extremely complex but certainly very drinkable, a perfect addition to a nice warm day in the sun."
"This is a beer I could drink all day!"
"This is one of my favorite go-to beers along with FFF Gumball Head. Orange tint, white head, not much carbonation. Very clean on the palate, great finish. Orange flavors are predominant on this beer. A very easy-to-drink beer that I will be enjoying all summer long!"
"Amazing wheat beer. Do yourself a favor and track down a fresh sixer of this."
"D= Amazing! I'll be drinking a lot of these this summer."
"D--Perfect session beer. Not something to go to if you are looking to give your taste buds a workout, but just a flat out great easy drinking beer"
"If this gets into a canning line this is absolutely, positively the best beach beer ever. So smooth yet not empty...this is a finely-crafted borderline sessionable ale to enjoy on warm days. I must stock up on this while in Virginia and truck as much as I can back to Boston to share with friends and family. I prefer much heavier styles but I surely appreciate just how fucking good this stuff is. Damn!"
"Notes: Great for any outdoor summer or spring lounging or activity! Unfortunately today is a very rainy, glum day; the weather channel is even saying we are supposed to get a couple inches of snow! But despite the cold and ugly weather, this is a beautiful beer good for any occasion. Thank you, Bell's for another great beer."
"drinkability: good quality, not my favorite, but a great crossover beer from macros. Suprised about the alchol content. it was very easy to drink. Serve with a lemon and i think the bud drinkers can handle this. Especially if they like Blue Moon."
"D: Heck yeah! There a place locally that had this for the beer of the month last summer. Gotta love good prices on good beers."
"Hazy honey color, not much head or lacing. Smells of mild honey, orange and lemon, and a wheat malt to support it all. Taste is smooth and a little dry, yeasty, the citrus flavors are present all the way through, mild hopping in the background, and a wheat malt. Relatively clean finish, a good all-round wheat beer that's easy to drink and goes well with the proper cuisine."
"I would drink this one all day long in the summer if i could. It reminds me of summer and california citrus. Deliciously pleasant. Not incredibly unique, but the wheat notes are beautiful and the citrus fruit accents are almost heavenly. Definitely a must try."
"Pours a hazy light amber color. This is a nice sessionable summer wheat ale. Plenty of lemon zest and wheat in the flavor. Nothing too impressive in the nose, but very easy drinking and refreshing. This is an out-door beer made for patio drinking in the sun. This beer was made for the summertime outdoors. No wonder he moves so much of this stuff."
"The mouthfeel is rich and full and makes hyou feel as if you're crewing on your beer. There is no disappointment here with this brew, at least until you've finished the can, so you'd better get two."
"While I do love this beer, part of it comes from spending way too much time in Bell's in my youth, enough so that I still want to call this beer Solsun (the original name, long story). Anyways...a great, refreshing beer, very cloudy when poured in a glass, while I generally avoid mixing my fruit and beer, an orange slice does add a nice touch to this. Great beer year around and very happy to have it now in Florida."
"Pours a very cloudy yellow-orange colored body, with almost no head, white, and lasting. Has an effervescent, hoppy aroma. A clean wheat taste, fresh nutty aftertaste. Effervescent, and somewhat spicy."
"This is easily in my top10. I may try garnished with an orange slice next time."
"Overall a great beer from a great brewery. Luckily it's available year round here in Florida!"
"7/4/7/4/14 (3.6/5)"
"D - Ridiculously, outstandingly, superbly, and perfectly drinkable. This bottle went down WAY to fast. This could be the session beers to end all session beers (at least in the summer). I could take out quite a few of these with glee."
"D - This would be a decent beer to enjoy on a nice summer evening"
"It's not likely for a wheat beer to knock you down with goodness... it just seems a simple style to me for some reason. Bell's does a great job with this one though. Something much better than the rest in my opinion (outside of german wheats, of course). In a world full of people that think Blue Moon hung the moon, this one could be very popular if it had more availability. Pours a very light orange, with a nice fluffy head. Aroma is grainy and wheaty, with some yeast notes. The chunky yeast floaters isn't my favorite thing to see, but I tried not to rouse the yeast in this one. Easy to drink, due to the light flavor and subdued herb/spice notes. This one gets it's spiciness more from the yeast and fermentation, rather than additives."
" Bottle,draught,mini keg.The beer pours a very cloudy golden color with a large white head.The strong scent of citrus and wheat is prominent.Strong yeast, orange and wheat flavor. The aftertaste is sweet and citrusy. Creamy mouthfeel,medium body. One of my faves any time of the year,very,very drinkable !"
"The aroma is bread like with some citric tones. As you drink more the aroma gets a little more grainy. It has very wheat like palate. It pours a very hazy orange color. There is a lot of sediment and bubbles to the body. There was not much head at all but what little it did have disappeared quickly. The lace is off white with an orange tint. The taste is wit like and not bad with balanced mix of grain, citrus, spice and hops. It has a crisp mouthfeel with sediment."
"Future outlook: Pretty good. I can see grabbing these for a night of pounding beers when the weather heats up."
"Drank straight from the bottle because my mug was dirty. Bottle is really attractive with an orange and blue outlined label. I expect some citrus flavors and maybe wheat from the bottle. Couldn't judge the pour but the smell was a mixture of wheat, citrus,and a bit sweet. The taste was much the same tune as the smell; sweet and smooth with a hint of spice at the end. I got this beer from my friend Evan and questioned his judgment when he said it was good. I think this beer is an OK ale but my judgment may not be up to par considering I drink few standard ales."
"Notes from 11/13/05"
"D/O: Wish I could get this fresh and during the summer. A great beer to have for the warm months and a nice take on the American Wheat style."
"D: Easy-drinking. An exceptional summer seasonal."
"For a summer ale, one of the concerns usually heard is that a summer ale often turns into nothing more than a lawnmower beer. Fortunately for us, Oberon Ale is not that kind of beer. Though the beer is indeed smooth to taste, there is a nice complex body to the offering that leaves the taster satisfied with the quality here. This is not a beer that should be used to simply wet the whistle since there is a nice complexity to the beer. That being said, this beer is certainly very drinkable and maintains a smooth and crisp quality to it."
"it pours a hazy golden peach color with no head. it smells thick and sweet. it actually is very light and crisp, a bit dry. the wheatiness is mild and there is a light sweetness of honey. drinkable and refreshing. a good summertime brew."
"Oberon is a real easy drinker. I could put this stuff away all night. Shame that it only comes around once a year, as this has got to be my favorite American-style wheat ale."
"Very light and not very heavily carbonated. Drinkability is pretty high."
"Thanks to unionturf for the sample"
"3.5/3.5/4/3.5/4"
"It's actually a lot better than I remember it being. Perhaps it was because I was comparing it to German Hefeweizens at the time. I could easily put back a sixer of this stuff."
"D - Very drinkable. Solid summer beer with flavour."
"Drinkability: Refreshing while still complex, and well-balanced, this is an exceptional summer beer. Recommended."
"Not much of a head for this touted wheat beer, o bubbling for tha matter. But the right hazey amber color with some suspended sediment does qualify. The aroma is of green bananas, which I think is from the American hops mingling with the wheat to give a ripe banana aroma. The taste is ripely sweet banana ad muted coe with some sugary touches of bubblegum. Plus lots of softly sweet toasted wheat malts. Nice spongey palate mingling with all those soft fruit flavors. Great summer session beer."
"D--great representation of the style. I had the beer with and without the yeast that comes to the bottom. I prefered the beer with the yeast from the bottom. For some reason the hop flavor was more pronounced."
"D/O: This is a very flavorful and easy-drinking summer beer. When I'm in the mood for something crisp and on the low-end of the bitterness scale, I'd likely reach for this if it were available. This will be found in my fridge each summer I can get my hands on it."
"It won't be long before I enjoy Oberon again, another fine testament to Bell's brilliance. One of the best APWA's around."
"A tasty summer treat!"
"D- Refreshing summer beer. Definitely sessionable."
"Got this one from Dyan. Thanks!"
"I could drink these all day. Yummy!"
"Very nice wheat ale for the summer. Taste permates well but slightly overcarbonated but nice robust malt taste. Got it at Pelly's Liquors in Lakeview neighborhood in Chicago, IL, which also has a bunch of good beers including Great lakes burning ale"
"This beer screams summertime. It is light and refreshing with mild carbonation and a good bitterness. Bells has done it again. Damn I wish these were available out here. Stupid Texas."
"Good beer to have now and again but at the price it is their are a lot of better beer out their for far less money."
"Another stellar offering from Bells!"
"I tried one this afternoon and I thought it was pretty good - easy drinking and tasty with no real aftertaste. I had some ""everything"" sourdough pretzels with it and they were a perfect accompaniment."
"Pours an ever so slightly hazy golden amber with lots of bubbles rising to the top into a short-living white head that dissipates to a swirl and ring quickly leaving traces of lacing. Aroma is sweet with bready wheat balance with the citrus hops with lemons and oranges. Taste follows the aroma with the big wheat backbone up front and a slight hop bitterness in the finish with mainly citrus. A hint of spices show up in the taste that I didn't get in the smell. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with tons of carbonation and makes for a very drinkable summer wheat beer."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I will definitely pick this up again"
"D: Crisp, refreshing, and flavorful. A little heavier than some other wheat beers, but still solid."
"This beer pours an orange color with a head that disappears quickly. The taste is wheat, orange and some banana. This is the perfect summer beer. Best enjoyed on the beach. I have had this beer on tap while out at the bar and it just doesn't seem as good unless its enjoyed on a nice summer day."
"Very cloudy, dirty light orange look to it with some head but it settles down quickly. Aroma is malty and yeasty with a touch of fruit. A refreshing citrus fruity flavor with some spices and hops. Not complex but enough there to make a good wheat and excellent for the summertime."
"Good tasting ale. The problem is, it tastes so good you I had a tendency to drink faster than I should. With the little higher alcohol content you would have to be carefull."
"Pours yellow to orangey, with a creamy head that exhibited decent retention. Hoppiness is not prominent in aroma or flavor but in balance with taste. As would be expected in an American wheat, there are no prominent esters more commonly associated with Bavarian wheats. Tasted slightly sweet, caramelly and appealing, with a dry finish. Surprisingly, does not have a prominent grainy wheat flavor but seems more like a mildly hopped American pale ale. While not a complex beer, it is a decent summertime quencher."
"Mouthfeel is pretty chewy, fluffy. Overall this is a pretty tasty beer, I'm glad I picked one up."
"D: I could knock these back one after another. I wish this were available in Georgia because it would likely be my lawn mower beer. It is very refreshing but doesn't lack flavor."
"This would be a good lawnmower beer. Hopefully we will start getting Bell's in GA soon so I can try some other offerings."
"Overall I'm a little disappointed with this offering from Bell's. I guess my high opinion of their Two Hearted Ale led me to expect more from this beer than it delivered."
"Poured from a 5L keg into a glass. This brew poured a cloudy orange gold color. Decent fluffy head, nominal lacing. Smell is a spicy grain note with hints of citrus. Taste is along those same lines with a respectable amount of hops present. A very clean refreshing brew, very drinkable."
"Overall, decent, nice saaz presence but could be more."
"HV"
"Finally a summer seasonal that is exciting to drink while remaining refreshing."
"Could drink a lot of this."
"Drinkability is good because of the dry finish and the smooth mouthfeel. There is enough taste to drink a good six-pack of these, but nothing that blows you out of the water. A very strong selection in warm weather."
"Pours a nice hazy light gold color with frothy white head with good retention and lacing. Smell is a bit earthy, some grass that is, and bit of citrus, some malt as well. Taste is good but somewhat bland. I went to school in Kalamazoo and never understood the Oberon hype and now that I'm out, and a BA, I still dont. Some malt, some grassy hops, a kiss of citrus, but otherwise pretty bland. Mouthfeel is light and crisp which does seem about perfect. Overall not bad, just a little over-hyped IMO."
"Lots of carbonation, this beer is pretty crisp and refreshing. There are no overwhelming flavors here, but it's a nice summer brew."
"From notes."
"D - This beer has exceptional drinkability between the freshness of the citrus and the low ABV. This is one for summer afternoons."
"D= I am surprised to find myself saying that I thought this was a great beer. Living in Chicagoland, Goose Island's 312 rules the wheat beer market, and I have to say that Oberon is a far superior beer. Since my wife loved it too, I will definitely be drinking more of this one."
"D- entirely drinkable, another non-aggressive flavored beer that would appeal even to non beer drinkers."
"After hearing some good recommendations of the on-tap version of this beer, I was disappointed with the bottled product that I tasted. I will finish my six-pack, but will not eagerly anticipate the remaining five bottles. This beer pours very nicely, building a nice head that laces well as you drink. Being unfiltered, it sports a nice amount of attractive sediment that is kept in motion through the opaque orangish liquid by a well-balanced carbonation. The smell is light citrus, and the taste on the palate is slightly lemony but otherwise bland. It does leave a bitter aftertaste, but not a particularly pleasant one. The lack of real flavor is surprising for a summer wheat ale, and is the one thing that makes it only average in drinkability."
"A very light but cloudy straw color with a nice white head and good lacing. The aroma is light wheat and maybe a hint of lemon, not real pronounced. The taste is more definitive with lemony floral hops and biscuit wheat. Crisp and well carbonated, very drinkable. There's a touch of grape and plenty of bitter clove. Easy drinking. Solid as a light and refreshing brew. Some bite to keep you honest. Bell's does it again!"
"Poured a cloudy orange that left a one-finger head that left lacings. A spicy smell mixed of cloves and pepper with some orange peel slipped in. Crisp as it hits the tip of the tongue but a smooth, medium-bodied beer, the spices are prevelant but the orange and lemon citric notes are in there as well and tasty. A slightly dry finish, this is a good summer beer and one that anyone can enjoy."
"Overall, it's a pretty good beer that I finally got to try on my trip to folks. Had a couple times on tap and then a couple bottles from this sixer before shipping the rest home to Texas. On-tap was excellent. Highly recommend. Wish they had it available here in the beer desert none as Texas. Would go well in my summer rotation."
"D--Not like an ice-cold High Life, but certainly sessionable."
"Thanks cpferris for the bottle. Pours a hazy saffron color with a weak head that looks like it's composed of air bubbles, not CO2. Accordingly, it fizzes out leaving no lacing. Aroma is bready with some mealy wheat. Flavor is unripe banana/honeydew with a touch of clove and a bready, yeasty base. Crisp and clean, extremely refreshing despite a substantial body. Really easy to drink, and a beer I wish was readily available to me for use during hot summer days."
"Overall: Drinkable as lawnmower beer, but deeply unexceptional from a brewery capable of much, much, much more."
"D: I could drink this all day but I won't. Its the queen of tailgating beers, especially if you are looking for better offerings than BMC."
"D-Decent session summer beer I suppose. Never really seemed to hit the mark of what they were after."
"D- I could drink these all afternoon sitting out in the sun. Always a good summer standby."
"Impressive for a pale wheat."
"Drinkability wasn't great. I finished the beer but I wouldn't search this beer out again. Might have it if it was free, but I don't think that Oberon was worth searching out, especially when I can drink anything else Bell's makes."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Had two bottles - one for me and one for my dad. Pours a murky orange. Very little carbonation in one of the beers while the other is completely flat. Smell is mildly spicy and earthy. Taste is pretty average. Some citrus and wheat flavors come out, but not a whole lot else, unfortunately. A pretty average brew, but good for a hot day."
"I was at a Detroit Casino last night when I saw Oberon on tap. I figured I'd take a break from losing money at the blackjack table and have a good beer. It was delicious. I'm hard-pressed to find an American wheat beer better than this. It had a nice orange/gold color with nice head and tasted fruity-sweet. It didn't come with an orange slice either which is a good thing. I hate when people put crap in my beer. I've reviewed this beer out of the bottle and gave it a similar review from what I recall. But I also think that it helps turn luck around because I started doing way better at the blackjack table. I may have to make a tradition out of this now before I start playing from now on..."
"I don't know where you magic pixies came from but I like your pixie drink. Thanks to Jw347."
"Drinkability is quite good, it is sessionable but also very light."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable on a hot day. Smooth. Not very complex nor over-simplistic. Just right and just enough to garner it a taste."
"Beautiful summer beer hazy orange/yellow smells of citrus and hops. Tastes of great wheat and some citrus fresh and refreshing but not weak. Mouthfeel is substantial and grainy. Drinkability - my favorite summer wheat beer - I try others only to be disappointed - I had to pick up a sixer of these this summer to finally scratch my summer beer itch."
"A very refreshing beer, that is easily drinkable. It's a great beer for the summer."
"Pours a very hazy lemony yellow, nice-looking but fast-fading white head, rings of lacing on the glass. Smell is wheaty, lots of lemon and grassy hops. Taste is very sweet, citrusy hops, slightly bready. Crisp and refreshing, very tiny and active bubbles. I could see drinking this all summer. Really great summer brew...I'd love to see this distributed in MA."
"I would not have guessed this to be a wheat ale at all. It is more like a sweet pale ale. I like it."
"I was surprised when I found out this was a wheat beer, it was while I was drinking my second glass. Once I knew that I could pick up some of those attributes but mainly in the nose and mouthfeel. The hops really overwhelm the wheat but then the finish is sweeter then the usual pale ale."
"Purchased a six pack solely on the basis of it's grade here at BA. Medium foam head on a beautiful cloudy gold body. Smells of citrus and banana, with a little floral hint. Taste is near perfection, with the citrus accentuating but not overpowering. Wheat could be just a tad stronger. Very thick on the mouth, like I need a fork to eat it. This is a very, very good brew, among the best American Wheat Ale's I've had."
"Cloudy and dark yellow or light orange in color. It is almost the color of light woodwork like that in my kitchen. Frothy head. Light malt nose. Smooth attack with a creamy mouthfeel. Very complex in that it goes through numerous flavors very quickly. Cream, honey, citrus and grain are all flavors that I can detect. Easy drinking but I wouldn't call it a ""great"" beer. I rated it a C on my scale."
"Another nice beer from Bells."
"EDIT: Also, anyone notice the pic of the bottle has an upside down label?"
"Drinkability is great. Light but full flavored. One of my favorite summer drinks."
"overall, i really enjoyed this beer, perfect for a hot summers day"
"Pairing suggestion: Puffed rice encrusted talapia with mango chutney."
"D: Very light without being watery. I could go back for more."
"Overall: Really good, paired nicely with BBQ chicken on a stick. This is the type of beer with its light crisp flavor profile and mild spice notes, that could pair with a variety of spicy and flavorful dishes."
"had this at a 4th of July Party at a friend's house. Beer poured a hazy gold orange and had no visibility. Had no extraordinary smell. the taste was very smooth with very little bite as an aftertaste, but there was a richness to it that clearly separated it from a Lager. Not recommended as a session beer just because of the filling nature the beer."
"Find youself some of this and enjoy."
"This beer is a great choice for a summer night. It has a great smooth taste that is fully refreshing and holds a hint of citrus in closing. The color I think is great, transparent, yet not to light for a beer of its kind. For those who are looking for a summer ale with more solidity I believe this to be the right choice."
"Pours a hazy light orange with a white head. The aroma has a creamy orange and malted wheat. The flavor is a nice mix of spicy and citrus hops flavors from the Saaz with the sweet wheat for balance. That creates a pleasant balance of citrus fruit, mellow malts, and spicy/bitter hops - all in a great summer beer. What a deal."
"Overall- A great summer beer but overall nothing too impressive."
"Oberon is packed with lots of great summer flavors that goes down pretty good. I can't tell if the punch of sourness/bitterness at the end is surprising or distracting, but I would still say this is an fine summer brew."
"D: A great summer beer and another great Bell's product. Bottle-conditioning helps this beer a little."
"Mouthfeel is rich enough and smooth like you would expect from a wheat beer. Drinkability is good. Abv is light (surprised that it is as high as it is). Would probably be nice on tap. Nothing memorable, but a nice, fairly light beer."
"Taste of wheat with straw-like maltiness. The wheat makes the beer a bit rough. Yeast is clean, but leaves some fruity notes. There is a light bitterness that is above average for a German wheat beer. It falls into place with this beer. The hops are mild and a bit grassy, definatelly not US hops."
"Had this at KClingers in Hanover. Appearance - small creamy head. Color was yellow an dcloudy. Aroma -banana and yeasty. Taste - very smooth and the wheat lingers, creamy tending towards syrupy. Kinda of different than most wheat beers. I think th edifference is the creamy mouthfeel."
"I feel like my review of this beer might be a little higher if I was drinking it out on the deck of a beachhouse, or on a nice sandy beach. Too bad no glass containers on NC beaches. Oberon minikeg anyone? But, really, Oberon is an experience."
"Goes down easy on a really hot day (90-plus) and it has a good amount of flavor for a pale wheat. Definitely one of the best of it's kind for sure. Way to go Bells. For a style that can be boring, this stands out."
"Pours a cloudy golden straw. Almost like a light apple cider. Head stayed for a little while. Citrus tones in the nose with a slight hop presence. Orange, coriander mix well. Taste has a spicy citrus start with wheat malt and then gives way to a hoppy bitterness. On the lighter side of medium for the mouth feel. Very good drinkability, hits the spot after a grass cutting session."
"All around a great brew, just a bit rough on the appearance side."
"Mouthfeel is clean and smooth, though I would prefer more carbonation."
"I had to stop myself from drinking the whole six pack as soon as I got it! Man this stuff is addicting as soon as you open it! Go get it if you haven't tried it, it's that good."
"D: Very easy to drink...summer is here!"
"pours a cloudy golden hue with and inch of foam. aroma of bananas and cotton candy - very sweet smelling. Sharp taste with a fair amount of carbonation. nice sweet flavor with a slight bitter hop finish to it. mouthfeel is middle of the road. very drinkable. would pick it up again if i were in the mood but would not actively seek it out."
"Taste was very smooth, with crisp citrus notes. Easy to drink. A GREAT summer beer, wish we could get it in Arizona!"
"D: An excellent summer beer, smooth and drinkable for all day."
"This is one fantastic summertime brew. I finally realize what all the hype is about."
"M&D: Light body. The moderate carbonation makes for an excellent mouthfeel. At 5.8% ABV the drinkability is way up there. This is a great summer selection. Just another example of why Bell's is my favorite brewery. Skal."
"A nice summer brew and I wish I could get these around my neck of the woods."
"Pours out a hazy, golden color. There's about two and a half fingers of fizzy, white head. Some floating particles also make an appearance. Lacing was somewhat lacking, but overall the appearance was pleasing. Smell wasn't overly exciting. Definitely grainy, with a citrusy zest to it. The taste was much the same. A hint of citrus complements the wheat well in my opinion. The beer was very smooth and pretty fizzy. I could probably drink these all day if I had the money. I would defintely recommend this beer."
"Pours a hazy golden color with no head and minimal lacing. Aroma of malted wheat, orange zest and spices. Taste is much the same. Big time wheat malts, somewhat sweet, but not overpowering, hints of orange and coriander. This thing is very smooth and creamy, amazingly easy to drink and probably the best summer beer there is. I'm not one to go on about wheat beers, since they are from my favorites, but this one is great. Definitely a good session beer for the summer months."
"D - Wheat beers really aren't my thing but these were fairly enjoyable, I'd drink another one but it wouldn't be my go-to beer."
"This is a great American wheat beer, and a fantastic summer beer. I could down these by the sixer on a hot summer day. It's really nothing out-of-this-world in terms of flavor and complexity, but who cares? The world needs good, solid beers like this that you can just sit back and enjoy. Recommended."
"D - Drinkability is quite good. It is refreshing and goes down pretty easy. The flavors are pleasing and the alcohol is low enough to have a couple of them. I would drink more of the Oberon and recommend it to anyone looking for a good summer beer."
"D: I really liked this beer. It has the refreshing nature of a wheat but still has some hop backbone. Very nice."
"12 oz bottle poured in to a imp pint glass. Hazy light orange with suspended particles and a white head. Smells like faint smooth orange, not hoppy citrus, just orangey. Light taste of orange on top of light malt. Beautiful balance. This is what macro brews should use as a standard when they reference ""easy drinking"". The perfect balance and light wheat, orange, and malt flavors make a delightful beer. This beer will turn people from macro to micro."
"drinkability: this is a real summer bear. It's quite light and drinkable and I am enjoying it with some eggs."
"Pours a cloudy burnt orange with a small white head, not much lacing. Main aroma is orange peel, with a hint of sweet malt. Taste is very balanced...citric and sweet up front with a touch of bitterness on the backend. This brew washes away very clean, and begs for another sip. I could drink this all damn day!"
"People list this as one of the great American summer beers, but I'd be pleased to drink such a well-balanced ale any time of year."
"There is not much to say about this one. Well done, simple, and fun to drink. Very sessionable and refreshing when the weather is warm."
"Emptied into an oversized wine glass and looked a golden orange with small head that quickly faded. Got whiffs of doughy bread and oranges, as for the taste very refreshing and thirst quenching, I could have finished off many more on a hot day like today. Nothing is too overpowering in this brew and is extremely well balanced and other than the wheat it was hard to pick out anything else in this one. Excellent summer drinking beer I'll be picking more of this up."
"Overall, I am really enjoying this beer. As mentioned earlier, I am usually somewhat reluctant about wheat beers, but this is inspiring me to expand my horizons. Another excellent beer from Bell's."
"Drinkability very high on this one. Reccommended."
"Smooth, medium-bodied, and lip-smacking good. Superb drinkability."
"It tastes like a Blue Moon Summer beer to my girlfriend, and I think it's a great summer ale. I like it a lot, and now I finally know what all those Michigan Bell's fans are raving about."
"I can understand how Oberon has been a gateway to the world of craft beer for so many people over the years. It's a solid, easy drinking beer that suits the summertime very well."
"D: One of the perfect summer beers and a great gateway beer. I will have no problem finishing the growler tonight."
"Overall, this was a good refreshing drink perfectfor relaxing with on a hot day. This would be great to just take a 6-pack to the beach and just hang out for a few hours with. Subtle, but still nice and flavorful, this is a good beer."
"Drinkability is moderate. With low alcohol it is certainly sessionable, but flavors are unimpressive."
"D-This would be a great summer beer to just keep around the house easy to drink and very refreshing."
"a sessionable ale even at 5.8 percent ABV."
"M/D. A bit thin but easy to drink.Very tasty summer beer.I bought a six pack to go along with my pizza and for the remainder of the night."
"Drinkability: Very high"
"D_A nice summer ale, one I would drink if I could get my hands on it in NYC."
"D - Very drinkable. A good conversation beer."
"Overall, this does go down smooth, but not a particularly outstanding or notable summer wheat ale. It's missing spices and anything else to differentiate itself from the pack. Definitely one of the lesser Bell's brews I've experienced."
"poured a nice hazy yellow from a 12 oz bottle. thin lacey head. smells of malty honey with some citrus and some nice hops peeking their heads out in there. taste is very fresh and well balanced hop vs malt value. feels medium bodied on the tongue, nice carbonation, tiny bubbles. a very drinkable refreshing beer! Bell's can't go wrong in my book so far. their amber ale is simply amazing for the style too! wish i woulda bought a six pack of these! these would be second to none on a hot florida day. I love it."
"A very special thanks goes out to my buddy, and TKS partner in crime, Jess, for picking up this, and Bell's Pale Ale during her weekend in Detroit. Poured in to a Sam Adams pint glass a gold, slightly murky color, with a good looking white head, and lots of air bubbles racing to the top of the glass. Nose left something to be desired somewhat; certainly floral, with a bit of spice, but not exactly bursting with aroma. Taste reveals lots of pleasant tastes such as orange peel, wheat, chamomile, cream, spice, and a light grassy hop presence. Body is just a bit above being considered light for my taste, and is balanced in every sense of the word. Everything molds together in a lovely sort of way that I have not experienced in a while. A six pack would be very easy to polish off tonight, but I think I will hold back, and enjoy the six pack over the course of a few nights. A very good session brew from Bell's. I drank a Sam Adams Summer Ale before cracking this one open, and have to say that it did not even compare. This is one Summer wheat beer that I would frequent if it were available in my area. Cheers."
"Being 5.8% alcohol by volume it's definitely not a session beer."
"Mildly thick beer with a very light fizz. I can imagine myself drinking copious amounts of this beer - and I'm not really even a fan of the style."
"Overall, this is a solid beer and a good summer beer. One of the better wheat beers that I have had lately. Highly drinkable and one that I will definitely order again."
"No after taste , easy drinking pretty refreshing. a slight bitterness but nothing bad."
"Pours a light murky gold with a large head. Very light wheat aroma. Tangy wheat taste with a bit of underlying malt and sweetness. Finishes a bit dry with a touch of grassy hops. Well balanced. Pretty decent for an American wheat beer. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Easily drinkable. Overall a nice summer beer."
"drinkability is good. this is a smooth and refreshing brew with a solid profile. one of the better pale wheat ales out there."
"Recommended..."
"D: I don't care what people say about what can and cannot constitute a ""lawnmower beer"". This beer, its relative light body, its taste and refreshing quality makes this a fantastic choice for after yardwork on a hot day or for any day for that matter."
"Pricey, but worth every penny. Oberon signals that summer is here."
"Purchased at the General Store next to the Eccentric Cafe in Kalamazoo, MI. Batch # 8355 printed on the bottle. Served in my Oberon wiezen glass (also purchased at the store). Poured a hazy, pale gold color. Luscious, white head occupied a quarter of the glass. Head dissipated slowly leaving behind webs of sticky lacing. Scent of wheat and light fruiy esters. Taste similar to nose. Lightly carbonated mouthfeel with a crisp clean finish. Of the six brews I tried while I was in Kalamazoo, this by far was my favorite. Very refreshing, quite sessionable and even better on draft."
"This isn't my style of beer but it's very easy to drink and would be perfect for a hot summer day."
"Highly recommended, have to grab a case next time Im in PA- great summer beer."
"This beer surprised me to say the least. It certainly beats some of it's counterparts in terms of complexity, and the noticable addition of hops really works with the wheat malt, something I haven't tasted until now. The coriander aspect is somehow a little ""off"" and I would really like to see the qualities of the yeast shine through, but then again all that may throw it off balance. A very, very interesting beer."
"Pours orangish with a minimal head. Smells fruity, wheaty, and has some hops present. Oberon tastes kind of fruity, with definite wheat presence. Has a creamy, somewhat carbonated mouthfeel. Overall, this is one of the more interesting summer wheat ales I have tried."
"D: This is a fantastic beer. Easily one that could become my favorite. Easy to drink and enjoy, while not so dull and lame that it is a throw away beer. Highly highly recommend this brew."
"Flavors of orange zest, lemons, floral hops, and grainy wheat. Spice profile is way too strong in my opinion, as it overshadows the citrus and wheat."
"T: Thicker side of medium body with active carbonation, a little creamier than expected. Overall, like the smell is more earthy and slightly sour. Orange rind, floral hops, wheat. Very crisp and slightly tart in the finish. Great summer beer, I'd prefer it to be a little sweeter and a little lower in alcohol."
"Presents with a cloudy orange color and a white head. Aroma of wheat malt, lemon zest, and citrus fruits. Flavor is nice and light with citrus, wheat, and a little bit of hops. Major difference between this and other pale wheats is that it was not that sweet. Still, a pretty decent beer."
"I think the 2008 batch isn't nearly as sweet at the 2007 batch. All in all a very tasty summer brew."
"Light-medium in body and overly carbonated. All the fizz takes away from the delicate flavor. Goes down easy but leaves you wanting more. Not bad, but I wouldn't have again - just not my thing."
"Also, when they start filling the taps at bars, this beer is even better on tap. No fruit needed for this one, it's tastey all by itself."
"Pours a fairly solid looking straw color with a little orange, and a bit opaque. Head is solid but dissolves way to fast and leaves no lacing. Nose is better: lots of what should be in there, spices and wheat, and tons of citrus (orange, specifically). Taste, on the other hand, just not up to snuff. It's not bad, but the carbonation is too high and sucks some of the flavor out. It's got the citrus and spice, but there's a sort of metallic tastelessness that shows up with the fizz and kills the fun from really taking off. Overall, I'm not sure if this year's different from previous ones, but this Oberon - a God among Michigan summer beers - is just not that exciting. Still drinkable, and will be consumed at least a dozen times this summer, but no nearly up to snuff with prior iterations."
"D-A great warm-season drinker. This is one of the quintessential summertime brews for me. Nothing about it screams out but it all seems to go together so well. I always enjoy having my first Oberon of the season...and many more to follow! A sure sign of spring to me! From April to August this is my ""Bud""."
"D- Overall, an okay american pale wheat ale. I don't know what it was but really was disappointed especially after having this on tap. Has a bit of a bitter taste that just seems out of place to me. I would maybe get and try this in the mini keg when it comes out but I'd much rather reach for a Gumballhead for a nice, tasty summer ale especially given the common distribution area."
"A mediocre beer, in my opinion, and a rare misstep by Bell's. I'm pretty sure I'm not grading harsher because Comcast messed up my MLB package, too. Although I'll admit it's not really my style, I have had a few American pale wheat ales that I've liked before, but they tend to be the more complex, subtle ones, full of light, peppery spices and citrus notes. This one has none of the above, unfortunately."
"D: Overall this is a great drinker... nice and refreshing and a bit different than most wheat beers in that the wheat is muted and oranges are delicate.. today it was in the mid 70s... i just had to have this!"
"12oz bottle courtesy of iconoklaztor, thanks! The color is a very light but cloudy orange. It smells more liek a pale ale than a wheat beer as described on the label. The taste definitely reveals the wheat and makes for a nice ale. This is very drinkable and a perfect summer offering that I am glad to have tried."
"M + D: Pretty lively and expressive carbonation. Maybe a little heavier than what I might expect from a lighter style, but still reasonably drinkable. I probably wouldn't actively seek it out, but I imagine I'd accept it if offered, of course."
"Perfect for the warmer months."
"M&D: Solid mouthfeel, quite light overall, with very light carbonation. Drinks smoothly and goes down easily. I'm not a huge wheat beer guy but the flavors in this are quite good and I very much enjoyed it."
"D: I could drink a ton of this over summer."
"Poured a bottle into a big Duvel tulip. I didn't get much head, but may have been too cautious in my pour. A pretty, warm, hazy orangey color. Some sediment swirling about. Wheaty, citrusy smell. The same wheat and citrus in the taste, as well as a little malty sweetness, followed by a little tangyness after the swallow. Nice and crisp. After a few sips I can pick out more maltiness in the smell. Not too much effervescence in the feel. Light on the tongue. Very drinkable. Nothing too complex, but I think that's how it's supposed to be. Gosh darn it, I like it!"
"D- Very easy and drinkable brew. Nice crisp and light. Not the most flavorful but overall very enjoyable."
"Not a favorite style of mine, but a very drinkable example."
"M/D: Medium body, good carbonation. Drinkability is really good on this one. Could easily drink this all day long during a hot summer afternoon."
"However the taste was a pleasant surprise, again nothing complex but very refreshing. For a wheat beer it was very drinkable and I could put back a few, a great summer beer."
"Overall, this is a refreshing beer and a great way to start spring!"
"Smell is a bit bland, not a whole lot sticks out. Not a whole lot to the taste either. It's just a nice refreshing beer. You're not going to be overwhelming or challenged by anything here, but this would be a good beer for a warm summer day. Not a lawnmower beer but a good BBQ beer."
"Pretty good little summer beer here. Its very light and crisp and a little citrusy. I'm not a huge wheat fan so this didn't overwhelm me but it was one of the better ones that I've had. It wold be rather tasty on a hot ass summer day. It went well with the cheese and cracker I was eating."
"I think this would be a beer that I would give to someone who has never had a craft beer before. It's leagues better than a BMC product, but because of its lightness it won't send em running back to mama."
"Overall: A solid American wheat beer with enough citrus character that ""no orange slice is required."" Worth a try."
"Other comments: Not as good as when I tried it on tap about 4 years ago."
"Poured a medium, hazy copper color. Medium body with a strong flavor, but not overly so. Definitely a very drinkable beer. Spring has arrived!"
"You can't go wrong, with an Oberon."
"Pours a cloudy light apple juice color, white head froths up and then fades pretty quickly. The smell is only faintly wheat with a lot of banana nut that comes out with vigorous swirling to release the aroma. The taste was really light and refreshing, even for something that's probably a little past it's prime. The taste had some hops still but only very light. Overall I can't wait to get a real fresh bottle b/c I am hoping there is potential here."
"Poured a bright golden color with lots of haziness from the wheat, carbonation bubbles visible. Some head, little lacing. Smells of citrus peel, lots of it. Tastes even more of citrus, lemon dominates. A very good feel, some heaviness that sets on your tongue. Definitely a summer brew, it's so citrusy it almost loses you for a moment on that it's a beer. A very good example of this style"
"12 oz bottle thanks to DrBayern - Pours a gorgeous cloudy sunset orange in a weizen glass, with a nice white holding head. Smell is nice and citrusy, with predominantly orange scents, along with light yeasty and hearty wheatiness. Taste is nice, rich and quite full bodied for a wheat. Wheaty thick mouthfeel, but still nice and bubbly and refreshing. Very nice and flavorful for the style."
"A must try summer beer."
"Really good, incredibly balanced, flat out tasty, and damn refreshing. For sure one of the best pale wheat's I have ever laid lips on. A must attain summer beer that is even great in the winter."
"This beer is a great example of a what a summer beer should be. I will definitely be seeking this out once the warmer months come back."
"The one great thing about this beer is that it's very very easy to drink. It didn't blow me away, but I never got sick of it either. That and a crisp aftertaste make it a very drinkable beer."
"Even though it is a full bodied beer it does not have a heavy feeling when you drink it."
"D - Good beer. Not the best but good overall."
"Thanks to kryptic for the trade"
"Have had this one on tap at several bars and restaurants, always served in a pint glass and usually with an orange slice (though I usually separate it from the beer). Sweet smell and taste that goes down very smooth. My favorite beer in this style, since it has more flavor than comparable beers."
"The best summer beer out there. Very refreshing citrusy beer without getting too sweet or sour. I've had it in bottle and on-tap and tap is certainly better, but it is still an excellent bottled beer. I have noticed, unfortunately, that it is only available in certain geographic areas of the US - not available in the Northeast, but it is available in DC and the midwest."
"Poured into a pint glass, pours an amazing yellowish red with some amazing suspension going on I truly love when you see some nice unfiltered wheat in the beer. Smell is crisp and ripe earty tones of grass, lemon and tweed. Taste is very good, I can taste some biscuits some roasted grains a bit of malt and a touch of hops to balance this amazing beverage. This is an amazing beer and goes down very smooth, I can't really find another one in my book that goes down this smooth, great job."
"The moutfeel is medium with some high carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer. I can see why so many people enjoy it."
"Dont ask me how I had one of these left in my fridge all this time, but I found it last night and decided to give it a try. Poured a nice golden amber, with a nice yellow hue. A nice medium sized head of white fizzy foam started on top and then faded gently down into just a thin film across the top. Some decent side glass lace. Smell was light, lots of grain with a somewhat muted hoppiness in the back, kind of pilsner like. A light bread like base made up most of it. The taste was pretty straightforward. Light bodied summer ale, lots of wheat with a hint of orange peel in for good measure. There was the slightest touch of a bitter pine finish at the end. Overall this was a nice summer brew. It came off a little bit bigger then your average light ale and had a decent bright flavor profile. I would say this would fit nicely on a warm day and it was a quality session ale. I really can not fault it, it is what it is, and it was decent."
"Had this on tap at the Bath City Bistro in Mt. Clemens, MI. When it was served in a pint glass the head was still alomst 3/4"" high and I could see the somewhat cloudy, golden, amber orange color while on the waiters tray. Smelled a little sweet from the fruity citrus, but not too strong. Also faint aroma of wheat. Taste matched smell perfectly. Notes of wheat and sweet citrus but not overpowering. Actually a medium to light bodied beer. Decent carbonation. A little creamy. Mouth felt a little dry when done. This is a very pleasant brew and goes down rather quickly. Very enjoyable and refreshing. I'd order this in a heartbeat."
"The mouthfeel is light and smooth with moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. A great suggestion with my lunch from the bartender. Another great beer experience from Bell's."
"D - Pretty good I'd say, I could definitely put a few back. A balanced and surprisingly flavorful brew. Bell's has yet to fail to impress!"
"Had this on tap a while ago at Barley's in Asheville, NC. Just getting around to reviewing it now from notes. Pours a slightly hazy golden with a great head and decent lacing. The smell is lightly grainy and extremely creamy. A little unusual for the style, but very appealing. Taste is similar. Fruity, fresh wheat up front and then a nice taste of fresh cream on the finish without the mouthcoating feel of the cream. In fact the mouthfeel is quite light but still a little grainy. Delicious summer beer. This would be a go-to summer wheat if it were available. Better than Goose Island 312, not as good as Gumballhead."
"Cloudy yellowish color with a small ring of head and a little lacing. Smell is wheat, hops, citrus. Taste is not very ""wheaty"" but nice citrus flavor, kind of sweet. Medium mouthfeel with high drinkability. I would love to give this another try."
"I poured this beer into a tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was cloudy kinda wheat colored/yellow with a white head. The beer was nice and crispy like it had a lot of carbonation. The head quickly decayed and left fair lacing. There was an initial sweet hit upon first hitting the mouth but not overpowering. Good clean beer would buy again."
"The flavor is of wheat malt with a slight citrus hint. It is a refreshing beer with a clean finish and abundant carbonation. Good for a warm day. A bit late in the season for this one but I still enjoyed it."
"Drinkability: I like the fact that"
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little foamy white head, some nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, yeasty, slightly spicy, slight caramel. The taste is malty, yeasty on the most part, some slight spicyness. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice Pale Wheat Ale."
"Enthusiastically drinkable. I know I said it was pretty thick and bready for a summer beer, but its delicious and still pretty refreshing. This beer could easily be enjoyed year round and i could see it complimenting many food dishes such as pork and deserts. Well done!"
"A hazy golden color with a half inch head, that dissolves away quickly, leaving a slight film on top. There is also visibility of carbonation in the glass. The light aroma of citrus hits the nose and is rounded out at the end by the soft scent of wheat. Light, airy bread like flavors hit the palate, with touches of oranges and lemon. Slight amount of bitterness at the end, not overbearing, very mild. A light, watery feel, but notto thin. The carbonation is very prevalent, but it takes nothing away, it cleans the palate. The dominant words for this beer are light and flavorful. Plus, with a low ABV, makes it a excellent beer. An extra bonus, with the wheat and citrus flavors, it goes really well with fish, particularly grilled salmon."
"..more from the up north tour... This brew has an earthy, fruity smell. Pours to a cloudy golden beige. Nice head clings to my trusty leinie's tankard. Taste is basic malty with very subdued hopping. This is a robust beer that is neither bitter or sweet. One of the most balanced beers I have had. The drinkability is high. This beer is a sessioner without a doubt."
"D: Very easy to drink. Too bad it's not hot anymore. Who am I kidding? This is Cincy, I'll wait til tomorrow."
"Oberon is a summer time favorite of mine from the days in Ann Arbor. Brings back fond memories of drinking on the porch after an afternoon of canoing, jumping off the railroad bridge into the Huron River, or doing nothing. Clearly, my review of this beer is biased by associations, but whatever."
"Poured at the brewpub. It has a cloudy straw colored body with a think white head. The aroma is very wheaty with a fairly strong lemony character. The flavor is nice and light with a slight hop flavor. It is very light bodied and makes an excellent summer drinker."
"Drinkability: soft flavors, gentle carbonation and slight tanginess make for easy consumption. Enjoyable hot weather beer. Alcohol is well hidden."
"Drinkability.... OK.... that's over.... maybe I'll try it again if I find it on tap somewhere."
"This is a very good wheat beer, nice cloudy light orage color, head goes quick, with little lacing. extremely drinkable, with nice fruity apricot? peach? flavors. I can say I will continue to drink this one throughout the summertime. Definately not the best Bell's has ever done, but one of the better wheats I have ever had."
"drinkable?: not for me. to thick to odd. but i guess you could chug it??"
"Mouthfeel is smooth, light up front, citrusy, and easy drinking. I probably should've had this before the Expedition, which is a hard act to follow."
"At the risk of commiting blasphemy, this beer to me is sort of like a macro brew without the crappy aftertaste. i could pound a whole bunch of these without batting an eye, but it isn't really going to satisfy a good beer crave."
"Cloudy,yellow,effervesent body with a huge thick white head.Not bad lacing on the glass.Banana and pepper smells.Banana,pepper,coriander and some lemon zest in the taste.Very easy mouthful,almost seems flat.But there was deffinetly carbonation.Good beer,but something seems off.Very drinkable non the less.Great session beer."
"Pours a nice and hazy gold with a fair amount of creamy head that laces nicely. Smells of citrus rind, orange, lemon and yeast. Tastes as it smells with spice and a little hops and finishes with a dryness. Feels light in the mouth and quenches ones thirst very well. A session beer no doubt and on a summer day this is an oasis."
"Spritzy, crisp mouthfeel. Very refreshing brew that would be perfect for a warm day. I have had it in bottles before, but it's even better on-tap."
"After removing the orange slice that I didn't think to ask without, the taste is of wheaty malt and orange rind. This beer goes down quite easy. A great summer drink and heads and shoulders above Blue Moon. Not being from the Midwest, it isn't available to me or it would become my new summer session beer."
"This cloudy yellow brew is a looker with a big white head that sticks around. Wheat germ and lemon pepper dominate the aroma while the taste is smooth like a hefe weizen, refreshing and clean with a nice peppery bite. A great beer I can't get here in S.C., but I may now have to make a few more trips to N.C."
""
"Bell's Oberon Ale pours a cloudy yellow color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a mild fruity aroma coming from the glass. The flavor is a bit fruity with a strong wheat backbone. This one goes down easy on a hot summer day. Definitely worth a try."
"D: Easy to drink, this is a great summer ale. The light flavor will not overwhelm the palate and its tartness makes you go back for more."
"Carbonation is on the low side, body is medium and smooth and while most of the flavors are delicate this is far from thin. Nice beer, and extremely thirst quenching. Well done!"
"Overall: I am the first to get on this site and sing praises when it comes to Bell's. I'm sorry to the loyal following but I just don't get this beer. There is some wheat and some orange, but nothing else. It's really pretty blah. Short of being cold on a hot day it doesnt have a lot going for it. This is a definite deviation from Bell's other wonderful beers. If you love it hey, more of it for you. I will stick to their other tried and true gems."
"12 ouncer, w/o freshness or brewing date info....pours cloudy orangy amber, under a moderate eggshell white head/tiny bubble film, with minor lacing...fruity, floral, powdered sugar nose...refreshing, quality summer brew....notes of more fruit, wheat malts and a smooth quite drying leafy hop finish. Nice offering from Bells, if I could get it locally, this would be one of my summer staples"
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderfully refreshing scent that boasts of pale and wheat malts along with a light citrus zest. It has a light breadlike character that adds a bit of depth to the malt bill. The taste is good. It has an extremely smooth malt flavor that boasts of pale, Munich, and wheat malts. It goes down easy and finishes slightly breadlike with a mild fruity zest and wheat malt crispness. The mouthfeel is great. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great summertime treat. It's fuller bodied than most, but it has tremendous flavor."
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow, with a big white head. Aromas of corriander and spice, and wheaty notes. In the taste, mellow yet spicy and a small presenceof a grapefruity hop end. It has sweet texture and a dry aftertaste. Refreshing and a nice light flavor. A good beer for summer."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a golden orange color with a thin white head that quickly turns into a thin lace around the rim of the glass. The aroma is rather fruity with some orange peel and grass. The taste is crisp with some citrus and a dry earthy finish. Overall, this is not bad for what it is (a highly drinkable beer for the hot summer months) and is one of the best in the American Pale Wheat Ale style. A little too fruity for my personal tastes at times, but worth a try."
"Beer pours an apricot color with modest head retention. A good bit of spent yeast in the bottle. Citrusy nose with a hint of grapefruit. This beer as not as sweet or orangy as a lot of other wheat beers. I actually think its taste is similar to Bass Ale of all things. This beer from Bells is not even in the same league as two hearted ale. I was disappointed in this one."
"This beer is reminiscent of another Bell's beer, the great Two Hearted Ale, but the Oberon is a wheat ale. It's also not as strong as the Two Hearted Ale but Oberon still packs a 5.8% punch, although it doesn't taste it. Nice color (although a beer's color has never really mattered to me - give me the taste!) with a pleasant fruit aroma which is also not that strong or overwhelming. Highly recommend you give this one a try especially if you like Summer ales."
"($1.79 / 12 oz.)"
"Having tried this previously on tap, I'm still not too enthusiastic about this beer. Smells good and feels good, I'll leave it at that."
"Seems to be very popular beer in the Midwest. Pours a hazy golden orange color with of head. Has a nice wheat smell with a citrus scent to it. Taste is ok. Has a defenite orange flavor to it along with the wheat malt. Not a bad mouthfeel either. All in all a nice wheat beer that could be had all day long in the summer."
"Drinks easy, a nice, if expensive (purchased in Charlotte, NC) summer quaffer"
"D: Excellent a very nice summer brew to have with friends."
"An extremely drinkable beer for the summer (as advertised). It's a very mild beer that goes down way too easy and nice to mix in with some Imperial IPAs. I was never a huge fan, preferring Bell's other offerings, but I have found it to be a solid beer to bring to BMC lover summertime gatherings and to enjoy as well."
"D: SUPER-easy-drinking and refreshing while still remaining interesting. Very nice!"
"D - I could drink a few of these at a time. This one has lots of flavor for the style, which is a nice change of pace."
"This is one of the best summer seasonals I have ever tasted, and growing up and going to college in Michigan, I have had many, many samples of this brew. So glad it's in North Carolina now. This is one of the few beers that a slice of orange actually accentuates, instead of hiding beer flavor."
"oberon is so smooth you can easily drink a sixer in a session but at 5.8 ABV you will feel it. it is a superb summer wheat with a saaz hops bite that lingers with floral/ citrus overtones i love this beer from april till october every year. i am fortunate to have bells beers available and reccommend it if your in the midwest to try any or all of the beers from this great brewer."
"this was a glowing hazy straw in color that settled out to almost clear with some tiny floaties by the end of the glass. sweet label as well. spicy, sweet, doughy nose with notes of banana present. taste is of sweet bready malts balanced by the bit of spice and carbonation. finishes clean. hops are playing a supporting role in this one. chewy mouthfeel and medium in body. this is a dangerously drinkable summer beer."
"Nice little summer beer here. Good malty backbone, with a spike of wheat and light hops. It's a great beer to cool off with during the hot summer months. It's not filling by any means, but it satisfies a strong thirst quite easily. Good cloudy appearance with a big frothy head in the beginning. It later dies out to a thin covering."
"Drinkability: Light and easy drinking, with a flavour profile that allows it to pair well with a wide range of foods."
"D - Okay, not as palatable as I would have hoped. Might have again . . . if in Rome (i.e. Michigan)."
"D- This is a great drinkable summer beer. I would have this again. Its light and refreshing on a hot summer day."
"Excellent summer beer. I can understand it's popularity. Easily sessionable."
"Poured from a 12oz. brown bottle into my shaker ""pint"" glass. After swirling the last half an inch in the bottle, appears a very cloudy golden pale yellow color with about a finger of white foam. Minimal lacing is left on the inside of the glass. Smells of spicy wheat, citrus, mainly orange, and a mild bready aroma. Tastes of citrus, wheat, bready yeast and mild hops. Leaves a slightly sour aftertaste. A notch below medium in body with medium carbonation. Always a refreshing beer to have around in the warmer months."
"This is great. A pleasure. Bell's is clearly a cut above the rest. Don't freak out because it's a Bell's brew under 8%. Highly recommended. Thanks to mnwags for this. Please send more Nick!!!"
"Taste was orange/citrus with a hint of banana and spice. The hop bitterness came through at the middle and continued to fade into the finish. Carbonation was moderate. Very good mouthfeel and excellent drinkability. Oberon is a great summer beer."
"D- I've always had a special place for Oberon, as it was my introduction to craft beer many moons ago (I think it had just made the switch from being named Solsun at the time). However, my relationship with the beer has been hot and cool over the years. Friends have said it is even better on tap at the Pub. Not wanting to believe them and having the desire to sample the tap only options every time I've been to Bell's in the past, this is my first time actually having Oberon on tap at the Eccentric. I have to say it was the freshest beer I've had in a long time and totally worth it. It's a great summer beer made for relaxing."
"Very refreshing summer wheat without a lot of clove or banana complicating things."
"Drinkability: Lively, smooth, and refreshing. Oh, and I really do appreciate the restrained wheatiness, Bells!"
"A very nice ale for the summer. The orange citrus goes great with a burger on a hot, hot day."
"D - Not a bad beer but not really an excellent beer either. I find myself wanting more out of the taste of this beer, as it competes with better tasting summertime wheat beers like Sam Adams wheat."
"D- Pretty good, but there are better ones out there. A disappointment from Bell's."
"This is one of my favorite American wheat beers - a great summer refresher. It has a uniqueness that is unmatched in my experience to other beers in itss class. However, it is much better closer to the source (at the Eccentric Cafe) from the cask!"
"Drinkability: Polished off 2 with no problem, and wanted more, but alas, the fridge is bare. This will be my session wheat beer"
"Note: This type of beer is much better without any fruit added to it. It a bar gives you an orange slice with it, eat the slice and then leave it on the counter. The orange takes away from the great wheat flavor in the beer."
"Slightly above average beer. Pours a hazy golden yellow with decent head that fades quickly. Smell is of citrus, yeast, and wheat. Pretty good but nothing stands out. Taste is much of the same. Not bad by any means but lacking in character. True to the style, though. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Carbonation is present here. Drinkability is the only 4 given. Again, the beer is slightly above average to me and even with the 5.8% this Pale Wheat Ale contains, it is quite easy to enjoy on a hot day like today was. Bell's is definitely one of my favorite breweries, and if this is the worst they can offer, there isn't too much wrong that can be done. Ahhh, thirst quencher."
"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good representation of style even if its close to being an IPA with less hops. This is an excellent beer that I could drink for long, long time."
"D - An enjoyable beer but nothing special. I would prefer a Hop Sun"
"What a great beer! I never thought I liked wheat beers, probably because of the strong banana flavor that is in so many of them. Oberon doesn't have that and I think that's why I like it. This beer is super refreshing and delicious. I may need a couple of cases to get through the summer."
"D: Quite drinkable, although not much in the flavor department. Admittedly I'm not a wheat guy, but for what this beer is, it's enjoyable. After I finish this 6-pack, I probably won't purchase another."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Appears a hazy golden orange color with an aggressive pour leaving a small foamy off-white head. Aroma is lightly sweet with alot of citrus, some malt, and a hint of hops. Flavor is orange, bread, and a small amount of hops at the finish. Also, just a bit of pine. This beer tastes awsome and is very well balanced. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a bit of carbonation. The alcohol content is a bit higher than most regular wheat beers, but it is still quite refreshing and easy to drink. This is one of the better American wheats that I have tried. Another great beer from Bells!"
"Drinkability of this beer is high. A good lawnmower, summer session drinker."
"Average, and I believe there are many better wheat ales out there, imports and americans."
"If anything, buying a case of this due to its reputation will hopefully, finally teach me to not make whole case purchases without sampling first. It's not a bad beer, and it certainly is refreshing, but it leaves a lot to be desired."
"This beer really shines in its drinkability. Its flavor is mild, but still interesting and it would make an excellent session beer for any number of summer events."
"This is an easy-to-drink beer. It is not a Weiss in flavor. I found it to be closer to a dry American Ale."
"A very nice beer. I used to drink this quite often about five years ago but have not revisited this beer since then. I m glad it is finally available in NC as I could see this one being in the fridge most of the summer."
"A little too fruity and sweet to be a regular part of my rotation but I can see the appeal."
"Oberon has a nice cloudy burnt straw color with a two finger bright white bubble filled head that dies down to a thin layer. Lacing is pretty sticky to the sides of the glass throughout tasting. Smell is quite pleasing, hints of spiced orange and wheat. Flavor starts off with a nice malty/wheat taste and finished with a crisp citrus hop bite. Orange pops up again on the tounge, but very mild. Very clean light bodied mouthfeel. Good solid beer from Bell's. Could definitely share a few of these with friends around the grill on a hot summer day."
"Eric"
"Had this on a warm summer afternoon, and I could have had 2 more, time permitting. I am going to pickup a 6 pack very soon, but will probably come back to Gallo's to get it on tap."
"D: Whether it's a day for an outside BBQ or late night summer party, this beer hits the mark for refreshing taste and composition. A great take on the wheat ale tip."
"Pours out a straw coloured golden sun shine. Not much head. Nose- strange flavour coming across- I don't know what that is?? taste- light citrus, some alcohol flavour, and an almost macro creamed corn type taste. Hard to figure out. Its a difficult to describe beer, but is decently tasty at the same time. I can see why this is Bell's big seller for the summer time. Its refreshing, full of flavour, but non offensive at the same time. I wouldn't look long and hard for this again, but was worth picking up a six pack."
"Bottom line: Oberon is a beer that I tend to drink during the summer due to the aforementioned availability. It's not a bad beer, but I personally feel there are better alternatives, particularly Arcadia's Whitsun, which is also fairly easy to run into here in Michigan. Oberon isn't bad though, and I respect the fact that it has opened a lot of people up to craft beer locally."
"B'ham UK"
"Grainy texture, some roughness on the palate,not like that of a typicla wheat. Odd tasting beer,not one of my favorites from Bell's. Might need to get used to the taste of this one. Wouldn't really want to have another."
"Poured from a bottle with no freshness date. The color is a pale and cloudy amber and is topped by a frothy white head that is about 1 finger high.The aroma is fruity and a slight bit citrusy. I detect a faint bit of banana in there as well. The taste is mildly fruity, apples, oranges and bananas. There is a very faint hoppiness in the taste too. The mouthfeel is tangy and zesty and very refreshing. It goes down easy."
"A great summer brew. Every year I cant weight until the first kegs hit my distributors so I can get one. This is my favorite summer brew and everyone who has tried it loves it. Its a great hit at summer cook outs."
"Packaged on 2/20/07 according to Bell's website: Pours a cloudy yellow with a thin and wispy white head. The aroma has some citric hops upfront, along with a tangy wheatiness, some yeasty bread and a slight graininess. The flavor has some citric and floral hops upfront also, with some yeastiness and a fruity wheat character. The mouthfeel is crisp with a carbonation bite, drinkability is good. A drinkable wheat beer, nothing more."
"Hmm, if you think you'll enjoy a summer seasonal based on a wheat beer, without any fruitty flavors such as cherry or rasperry or apricot, then this may be your beer. Very drinkable and therefore loved by those looking for the lighter refreshing side of craft brews. This is one of those you would enjoy on a hot summers day watching the ballgame. Not a fan of the wheat beer but I could drink more of these."
"I'm hard pressed to find a better summer brew. Nicely made and very refreshing."
"A great summer brew. Maybe too sweet for some, but nothing crazy. Not too complex, but what it does, it does well. A very refreshing and balanced, if simple, beer. Definitely one to pick up for some hot summer days."
"Drinkability is very good, you could polish off a sixpack of these no problem. A welcome summer beer and a staple in my fridge."
"-Oelergud"
"very drinakable especially in the warmer months, a more bodied beer that pairs great in summer time"
"Not bad, but not impressive either."
"D: Sessionable, but that is about it. Take it to a BBQ or the beach because this certainly won't offend anyone (nor will it leave them with a lasting impression of how good a Bell's beer can be)."
"Batch 7832. The beer pours a hazy straw yellow with a decent frothy head. The aroma was of sweet fruits and bubblegum. The taste had a good sweetness and a decent yeast bite. The beer was nice and crisp with decent carbonation. This a good yeast beer, especially for summer."
"Crisp, clean and very easy to drink. Maybe a tad creamy for ultimate refreshness and multiple bottles. Recommended."
"When poured it had a large head was light and foamy leaving decent lacing. The color is a golden and cloudy. Can smell wheat, yeast and citrus and small amount of floral hops. Has a wheat and orange peel flavor with some floral hop that gives it a little zip. A light and crisp beer that I could see myself sitting by a campfire with on a warm summer night."
"Subjectively - As with Fat Tire, I'm just not feeling the hype here. Also, from reading other's comments, some people seem to imagine this is some kind of Belgian wheat. It's not, so don't be disappointed if you don't taste citrus and coriander! It's an Americanstyle wheat!"
"Oberon is a true summer beer; light, refreshing, full of crisp flavors and it hits the spot every time. If other great beers such as Two Hearted Ale didn't exist, I would almost ask ""Why drink anything else?""."
"Overall, a fantastic summer quencher that tastes like heaven in one's mouth."
"Good wheat beer and worth getting if that's what you're feeling like."
"Foggy gold with a thin creamy white head clinging to the surface. Smells of sweetened wheat malts and muted yeasty fruit. The sweetness in the flavor seems to curb the edge of the grain, finishing with a lingering tangy quality and a flicker of pepper. This would be even better if the Saaz came through more to balance, but its enjoyable as it is. Medium-light, crisp body means easy-drinkin'. This'll be great for the summer, though I'll probably never feel the need to pick up more than a sixer."
"Golden color with a bone white head that dissapears before i can start typing. Film leaves some ok lacing. Smell of wheat. Also pick up some grassy notes and just a hint of citrus. Taste is mostly wheat with a faint orange bite and a little bit of yeast spicyness. Not as highly carbonated as I would expect for this style. Overall a nice summer brew and another solid offering from Bell's."
"What do you know another great beer from the people down in K-zoo! Oberon has been a staple beer in my favorite brews, so it is hard to say anything bad."
"Pours a golden yellow-orange with fair amounts of sediment and a frothy white head. Doesn't have a very powerful smell, but smells fresh and light, maybe slightly fruity like orange with some flowery hops. Taste is crisp and very nicely melded. Its fizzy on the tongue and very refreshing!"
"Pours a cloudy golden straw color with a two and half finger head. Shows great retention and spectacular rings of lace. Wheat malt and mild grassy/floral hop aromas. Sweet upfront, pale malt and soft wheat tones; followed by a light melon fruit note and gentle clove spice. Aftertaste is very tame, with a timid hop bitterness and floral hop flavor that blends very well with the spice and achives a near perfect balance. This appears to be a American Pale wheat ale that has not been stripped of it's German ancestral roots. Moderate carbonation and medium body derive some texture from unfiltered wheat and suspended yeast to form a nice creamy mouthfeel accented with yeast complexity. Finishes mostly clean with only a hint of residual wheat and a mention of spice. Highly quaffable for sure and a testament to how satisfying this style can be."
"Pretty complex taste for how light and drinkable this is. A little dry, but very refreshing. I'm looking forward to knocking out the next 5 in my fridge."
"D- A solid session beer. Although the smell isn't very flattering the taste more than offsets this (but I wouldn't suggest this one for the tulip glass.)"
"D- I can not think of a beer that I would enjoy more on a hot and humid summer day out by the lake. I seem to be enjoying this a lot more than last year- maybe I just needed something simple again."
"Pours a golden orange into a weizen glass. One finger head dissipates quickly with minimal lacing. Aroma is oranges with a definite hint of lemon. Taste is primarily wheat that goes to a grass with a strong orange aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin and watery for a wheat. Very light and extremely sessionable."
"Overall I'm a bit dissapointed with this one...I was expecting just a little bit more complexity from it. Also the small hints of sourness that it had were a pretty big turn off as well...I will say that it's a crisp refreshing beer, and is fitting as a summertime release, but all in all I probably won't go out of my way to purchase it again."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's pretty light bodied and extremely smooth. Very drinkable on an ordinary day, but even moreso during the summer. Overall, very good beer. This is one of my favorite summer releases. Enjoy."
"Pours a cloudy yellow-orange, with a frothy head that lingers. Slight citris smell with wheat overtones. Taste, as always seems to be a hoppy American wheat, yet the hops seem less pronounced than the 2006 version. If memory serves, the first few kegs last year seemed the same way, or maybe too many days and too many beers intervening. Good full mouthfeel. Exceptionally drinkable. This one fills the bill for all occasions in my not so humble opinion. Could easily go from a seasonal to a year round offering."
"Odd duck here. This is very different from previous versions, meaning the hops are almost gone. Too bad, as that was a highlight of the beer. Hope they bring the hops back. Nice head with great lace, very fresh citrusy flavors; good body, balanced. Nice nose. Wheat beer finish. Very drinkable."
"I've had this many times, mainly acquired at Martin's in South Bend. It pours out a dark orange-brown color, without too much of a head. The smell is mainly of ginger spices and citrus. Taste is mainly of citrus and hops, but not overwhelming by any means and very drinkable and refreshing. It's my summer relaxing beer of choice. Many good times drinking Oberon sitting around a campfire or at a barbeque."
"Drinkability - A summer beer of choice."
"Still, recommended."
"Drinkability: A great and very drinkable summer brew. I could definatly see myself reaching for this when i want a refreshing american wheat beer with a nice complexity. Not as ""wheaty"" as other wheat beers iv'e had , more fruity."
"Drinkability- An odd beer- not at all what I was expecting, but perhaps worth another try."
"Drinkability: On a warm summer day, this would be infinitely drinkable. I have to admit, having just come back from a run in the 10 air temperature and snow, I should have grabbed something a little more substantial. But, perfect as the beer they sell it to be."
"Another very good ale from Bell's that would taste even better sitting on a deck in 90 degree weather"
"It's not a knock-down extravaganza, but it is a tasty, spirited wheaten quaff. Nothing stands out, as it mixes and meshes and melds, in this case an especially nice trait. It's very refreshing and refreshingly clean as well. I may not think of this first, but if I have it around, I won't forget it's there."
"12 oz. bottle, brewed with Saaz - batch 7642 (packaged 9/15/06). It pours a hazed peach with medium carbonation and a finger of off-white head that leaves moderate lacing. The aroma is pleasant, but not very aromatic, consisting of tart/nutty wheat, and notes of Saaz. It tastes of wheat, cloves, spicy, floral?, and lightly piney hops, with citrus (orange, lemon?), and a medium bitterness. Not too complex, but freakin' delicious, with the only downside being a light alcohol presence. It has a medium, lightly drying/numbing body with medium carbonation that becomes lighter, and it leaves a medium finish. Very, very nice wheat beer that went way too quickly. A definite session beer as I was sad I didn't have another bottle to consume immediately after this one. If you see this beer, make sure to buy at least a six-pack."
"Pours a deep hazy golden color with a big white head and lots of suspended particles. Good Retention. Aroma is of sweet bready malt, wheat, and a touch of lemony citrus. Taste is similar to the aroma with a little stronger citrus present towards the finish. Definitely an easy drinking beer. Very solid effort once again from Bell's. While I am drinking this in the winter, this would definitely be even better on a hot summer day."
"I avoided this beer for a few years. Now that its distributed in my state, I see it with new eyes. I used to look down on it because it was Bell's cash cow, but in the light of day, this is a damn fine beer."
"Drinkability is high on this one. It went very well with my ginger green beans and salmon cakes. A solid and lovingly crafted beer from Bell's. I'd be glad to buy it again."
"A solid and quaffable summer brew. I would expect nothing less from Bell's."
"The Drinkability is very good. The beer is very refreshing. Thanks Shbobdb for this great beer! Prosit MK"
"Light copper color - clear. Mild malt carmel aroma, did not notice wheat's slightly sour character. Perhaps this keg has some age on it? Flavor, very well made beer, good attenuation and malt flavor, but still a bit too malty for me. Finishes slightly cloying."
"Overall, I really enjoy this, and it would make a fantastic lawnmower beer. I tend to prefer my wheat beers to be German (I just love their yeast strains), but this stands out among the American style wheat beers. After hearing so much about it, I'm not disappointed at all. Everything that I've had from Bell's has been great, and I can't wait to try some others."
"D: Yes, very. Price however, 8 for a 6, I can find plenty of other tastes for less."
"Drinkability/Notes: Thanks to Phatz for picking this up for me. I was looking forward to Oberon, but I was left looking for more. I nice expample of an American Wheat Ale, crisp and clean with a nice wheat and yeasty flavor but it could use a little more oomph ala Gumballhead. Hops are present but ever so slightly, this is definitely a summer beer, its so light on the palate. A session beer through and through but if your looking for something more you might be dissappointed. A decent beer and highly drinkable. Recommended with reservations."
"drinkability is great. i like this one alot and would be happy to have it available locally."
"12 ounce bottle."
"This is not my type of beer, but certainly could be for others. There is certainly a nice complex flavor which will make someone happy."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and refreshing. This is a great dinner beer would compliment salads, chicken, and fresh fruit very nicely. It also does just find by itself."
"Poured into a pint glass, beer is a hazy peachy color with yeast particles. The smell is only slight and is of oranges, wheat and hops. The taste also has a sort of orangish tang, with a fairly hoppy finish. Complimented well with an orange slice. The mouthfeel is enjoyable, creamy and well carbonated. Overall, this is a very drinkable beer, and I would definitely recommend trying it if you have not already."
"Thanks, DrunkenPanther, for the opportunity"
"Overall it is well balanced, nice and smooth. With lots of character. Enjoy"
"Drinkability: I think this was the first APWA I actually liked. When summer rolls around again, pick this one up, you won't be disappointed. If it tastes this well in the fall, then it would taste even better fresh in the summer."
"Poured hazy orange with nice white/orange head. Lots of floaties in this beer like every other Bell's product I have had. Lacing is present to the last drop. Much to my surprise there is not much smell to lure you in. Others note a nice hop citrus smell. I smell malt and maybe a touch of citrus but not enough to speak of. I think this is just me though, I just like a hop aroma as opposed to malt. Has a nice citrus/hop entry with a smooth feel in the mouth followed with a gentle hop/malt finish. Interesting carbonation (it is highly carbonated). This is a good summertime beer and I was pleased enough with it. Very refreshing citrus/hop/malt balance. Well done in the flavor/mouthfeel department. Too bad that there was nothing that jumped out at me with this one; this makes going back to it for 9 bucks a six pack a little more than I can bear. It is just way too expensive for what it is. I guess Gumballhead spoiled me...there is no contest between this and the 3F product for this variety."
"This one is surprisingly complex, interesting, and even enjoyable. I'm just not sure how this one fares as summertime brew. Refreshing enough, but somewhat dry finish, mouthfeel, and body threw me for a loop. Try it. Cheers!"
"Cheers!"
"Overall - A good way to end a hot summer's day. Has that hold on you like any other thing that is made locally."
"Orange gold. When poured in to an oversized pint glass look for a nice haze of yeast. 2 - 3""'s of beautiful creamy head that takes a little while to subside (usually cant wait). The nose is not particularly fruity or citrusy, a touch of spice & flowers without the perfume. Very, very smooth, creamy, dry & quenching. Extremely easy to drink (too easy @ 6% ABV) the yeast is perfect with just a smidgeon of sediment left at the bottom of the glass, perfect for the next pour."
"This is unique and tasty."
"Mouthfeel was smooth and slightly creamy. Refreshing and very easy to drink. A great summer beer."
"D- Goes down easy not much to this beer really. I won't seek this out but not so bad as to not have one if offered."
"Drinkability - very good, goes down easy, and is very sessionable."
"This beer got straight threes. That is a compliment from me considering the style. The beer was very cloudy and had the appearance of pineapple juice. There was a good head that dissipated quickly and left no lacing. The taste is good for the style and there is a slight bitterness. The mouthfeel is mostly smooth. The drinkability is fair. This beer is average in my book but that is good for me, again considering the style."
"Thanks to beckje01 for the sample."
"Overall: A nice, refreshing brew perfect for the warm summer months. A brew I look forward to picking up every summer. Quite refreshing!"
"Overall- This was a nice tasting beer and an easy 1 to gulp down. A 6er of this would'nt be sufficiant. Tasty and easy to drink!!"
"Poured a hazy mandarin orange in color. very little head but what there was that formed around the edges of the glass. Lots of stringy lace. Nos is very light and sweet. Hints of sugars and wheat. Flavor is quite nice. Very light wheat flavor. Yeast did a good job bringing out some slight citrus flavors that help lighten up this beer. Mouthfeel was perhaps a bit thinner than optimal. Still a very drinkable beer all things considered and I enjoyed this beer."
"Poured a hazing orange-golden color with moderate white chunky head. Smell presenst strong wheat notes with some citur-lemon background. Taste is very refreshing, with a nice tartness to compliment the sweet fruitiness. I normally do not go along with fruit in beer, But a slice of orange really seemed to increase the enjoyment of this beer. Good job. nice and refreshing."
"Drinkability: It's easy to see why this is a summer favorite, and a standard in the APWA style. It's not a mindblower, but it's more than an easy enough drinker. Had this from a minikeg and was much more impressed - seemed to have a more accentuated, sweet flavor."
"A sudzy quafable brew, full of flavor."
"The beer was transported in a ""bubba"" over a long distance, so I am not sure of the effect on the beer was. That said, it poured nicely offering a golden to lightly orange colour, with a slight creamy head. The nose was citrus, with a distinct orange undertone. The mouthfeel was smooth and silky. The taste was a nice apricot-like taste, with a subtle hop finish. The beer balanced out nicely by mig-glass, offering a very drinkable second."
"Note to Self: Ranked the #7 American Pale Wheat Ale when I tried it."
"Oberon pours a hazy yellow/orange, with about an inch off-white head. There's lots of lacing on the glass. The aroma isn't strong at all, but it smells like wheat and citrusy hops. Wheat is the main taste, but I can also taste orange peel and citrusy hops and it finishes with some spicyness and sweetness. There isn't much aftertaste. It's light bodied, but has a good smooth mouthfeel and is very refreshing. A perfect beer for a hot summer day, it's another winner from Bell's!"
"Wheat tang, orange rhind, and bold, fresh hop taste battle for attention in the forground while soft sugar and spice hide. Very Nice. I was thinking of this as a wit. It is listed as a APWA. I think fans of either will be pleased. Light and fuzzy mouthfeel. Yummy."
"Drinkability  liked it a lot. much better on draught than in a bottle!"
"As I said, this isn't my favorite style of beer, but Oberon is one of the better American wheat beers I've had."
"Good medium mouthfeel. Coats the cheeks well and the carbonation makes this pretty crisp. Nice and refreshing overall, decent flavor compared to most pale wheats. Nicely done, IMO."
"Bottle: Poured a hazy yellow ale with some white haze and a medium bubbly white head with average retention. Aroma of weak wheat with some discernable hops. Taste is quite refreshing with a nice dose of wheat back with some sensible Saaz hops, which provide character without shadowing all the malt. Body is above average and about right for the style. Very enjoyable beer overall and would make a great session beer for hot summer days."
"Low alcoholic strength makes this a good summer session ale."
"D: Very drinkable. Overall, a fairly light beer, with excellent flavors that make each sip easy and enjoyable."
"Body is nice and light, with a great slick mouthfeel and velvet texture that is supremely easy to quaff. Another winner from a great brewer. It's nice to see a brewery pay as much attention to it's lower ABV items as it does to it's Imperial Stouts and high gravity offerings."
"Pint was served with a little head, and this lasted fairly well. The beer is a golden/pale yellow color and pretty clear. Smell is interesting, kind of toasty malt without much of a wheaty character. Taste is a nice, balanced light malt flavor with just a bit of hops. Mouthfeel was pretty good, not too thick and not too thin. Overall, nicely drinkable but not outstanding."
"Quite a drinkable summer beer here. I could have asked for more head formation but that is no biggie. The sweetness here probably will turn off some people but other than that I can recommend this."
"Poured an orange-hued cloudy orange from a 12oz. bottle, poured a fluffy one finger head that slowly fell to light lacing. Aroma is richly characterized by wheat and citrus, slightly spicy notes present as well. Taste is sweet and grainy, slight crisp lemon flavors present nicely complement the soft wheat body of this brew. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, carbonation level is low, and makes for a very smooth sipping beer. Finishes clean on the tongue, just about as drinkable as they come."
"If you live in the Midwest, you've already drank it, and it's part of your summer ritual. If you don't, well, you aren't missing too much."
"Drinkability - Really hit the spot, was out all afternoon running around checking out apartments and when I got back all I really wanted was a refreshing beer and this nailed it for me. On a hot summer day after some yardwork this beer is perfect."
"Another winner from Bell's. This is what summer beer should be."
"Drinkability- Very nice for it's style. I like it much better than any other I've tried. Just not my mug of beer."
"Carbonation is very well controlled on this edition, and it leaves a lush quality to the malt that is endlessly more pleasing than the prickly-high carbonation that one sometimes finds in this beer. As it is, it's a beautiful summer sipper, though a degree less alcohol would up it's hot weather quaffability for me. Enough to hold the interest and keep you reaching for another, but not so much that you're distracted from the joys of summer, whatever yours might be."
"I wanted the mouthfeel to be a bit richer, but this isn't much to complain about. Maybe that's part of the plan by Bell's to make an unorthodox but remarkable wheat ale. One of the best of the summer."
"D: A great all-around summer beer."
"A friend of mine recently went on a trip to Michigan. I asked her to bring back some Michigan beer for me and she returned with this. When I saw I thanked and and thought: ""Another boring summer brew?..."" But, I was pleasantly surprised. I wish that they sold this around here. It's a good summer brew!"
"Ah....It's Summer and the Oberon is back! In my opinion a great Wheat Ale. The Beer pours hazy orange with a one to two finger head that dissolves quickly. The aroma is a slight citrus, not overpowering. The taste is where this Beer makes it's stand. Smooth and citrusy with a hint of Hops to clean things up and knock the edge off of the sweetness. Mouthfeel is light, clean and crisp. Drinkability is good and really hits the spot on a hot Summer day. It makes one happy to reside in Bell's backyard."
"Ah well, for every visit I make to the midwest in summer..."
"The pale ale influences defiantly show through with a good hop finish. I will drink this seasonal brew again soon and often as soon as they make more!"
"Drinkability- I picked up a sixer on the way home and enjoyed it the next few evenings."
"D: I remember liking this more a few years ago. This is only a decent beer, but it is nice for hot days on the porch."
"It seems many are champions of this beer; myself, I couldn't get past some of the sweeter flavors. I was surprised because I typically like wheat beers, so I won't rule out revisiting this one."
" Aroma is light malt and wheat, some citrus and light grass, and just a whiff of sulphurous skunkiness. Palate is nice, light, and crisp, yet still flavorful. Light wheat and a hint of crisp hops assert themselves up front, while some light fruity malt emerges towards the finish. Not a whole lot of aftertaste, just a crisp, ever-so-slightly sweet finish. Nicely drinkable, especially on the solstice. Unfortunately, I don't have a source for any more within 1000 miles."
"Pours a hazy darker gold with a nice little cap of white sitting on top. Nose is citrus and grass. Taste continues with the citrus/orange motif, with a spicy hit. Mouthfeel is creamy, like wheat meets wit. Although I love Hefe, I am not a big fan of the American Wheat, however, this might be my favorite of this style thus far. Bottle courtesy of Kramer17801."
"Pours a medium yellow/orange color. Slightly cloudy. Good, tall white head w/o a lot of staying power. Nose is slightly spicy, with mild wheat notes. Also has a subtle sweetness. Palate is sweet up-front, with solid wheat characteristics behind. Decent hop balance makes it taste drier the longer it's in the mouth. Some spicy flavors linger about ... Mouthfeel is light/medium with good carbonation. Finish is dry with lingering wheat and spice flavors. I like this beer pretty well. I have to admit, it didn't quite live up to the hype, but it's good none the less. I'd have it again."
"Pretty good, but would not purchase again."
"A decent enough summer beer to be sure, and one with just the right amount of character to fit in at any number of events (back yard BBQ, fishing, sporting event, relaxing at sunset, etc.)."
"Medium bodied on the palate, medium carbonation. What else can I say, I don't think that there is anything that could be possibly better on a hot summer day, too bad today isn't a scorcher. This beer is easy to drink, one that I will definitely get more of. Said it enough already, but I can't help but stress how good this beer is on a hot day."
"One of my favorites for the summer season, light enough to have several but with enough interesting flavors to keep me coming back. Highly recommended!"
"Good solid American wheat beer perfect for a summer day. If I could get this regularly in my area, it's price would probably make it a regular summer purchase."
"The mini-keg can (5l) size is also as good as the tap. I recommend no garnishes with orange or lime because I feel that the acidity of the fruits change the flavor some."
"The appearance is a dark yellow/light orange color, with medium head and cloudy visibility. Oberon's smell is certainly fruity and betokens a sense of refreshment. The wheat flavor is very prevelent, however many of the complex spices of Belgian wheat are lacking (which since it is an American Pale Wheat, shouldn't hurt it too much) but it is still not as refreshing or full as many of its American conterparts. The mouthfeel was a little light, not quite watery. It is very drinkable, as it is."
"Light to medium/light bodied and very refreshing."
"Overall Impression: Oberon is the First Sign of Michigan Summertime-Thick Humid Air and Mosquitoes. Bell's Launches their Summer American Wheat Beer. Perfect beer for those ""Up North"" Michigan Nights. This is the Beer that turned me onto Homebrewing. This is probably one of the Best Beers I Have Ever Had."
"Pours a hazy gold with a white head that fades quickly. Smells like a mix of citrus, wheat, and spice, not an over powering smell. Tastes a hint of citrus mostly spice with a bitter taste with a little kick. Has mostly wheat characteristics, not very carbonated, has a decent balance for a good overall mouthfeel. Has a good, almost orange, aftertaste that lingers for a bit. A good summer beer, could enjoy many of these on a hot day. They seem a bit pricey as with most of Bell's selections but worth a try especially if you are into lighter wheat beers with big flavor. Enjoy!"
"D: Perfect summer beer. Worth the anticipation. Would love to drink a case or two with my friends on the patio in June. Easy to drink and refreshing. Mmm."
"I concede, this is a good brew i will drink again, it's got a good mouthfeel, not too heavy, however distinct. this is a very drinkable beer."
"Veeery drinkable, smooth with a crisp lemon tart finish. Sharp in the mouth, a biting carbonation that lets you know you have something going on here. Bells  another superb American brewery, glad this ones a mid-west guy."
"Another hit by Bell's. Does this brewery make a mediocre beer? This is the fourth Bell's variety I've had, and they've all been good or better, or even incredible."
"Da fruity beer, I would enjoy another if I had it. It really does taste like Crunch Berries."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This is a very refreshing medium bodied beer. This is a very drinkable and pleasing beer. This may be my absolute favorite summer brew."
"Seems like a great summer seasonal type of beer. Not too complex, just well made and tasty. Courtesy of jpm30."
"12 oz bottle pours out a cloudy, pumpkin-like color. There was white, one-finger head and some lacing. I smelled lemon and other citrusy flavors. I could definately taste the yeast flavor and the citrus, as well. The mouthfeel was a little grainy, but it was still pretty drinkable. I think it is a good wheat."
"This American wheat beer pours a bright yellow amber with a creamy white head that sticks around throughout. The nose is quite light, with wheat, clove and a touch of coriander -- in some ways, this smells more like a Belgian witbier than a German-style wheat beer. Maybe the only thing missing is orange peel? The taste is quite pleasing, with plenty of citrus notes up front, followed by some doughy yeast, nice acidity, and a hop-based tingle at the end. Very well balanced. Perfect body, nicely acidic, flavorful. This one's a winner, and it gets bonus points for being a wheat beer from America and not sucking."
"Overall, a very drinkable and well-balanced beer. Very enjoyable, and makes me feel like summertime, as it is supposed to."
"This is a great summer beer that I'll have to break out for a cookout sometime this summer. I love beers like this that have great taste and are also very drinkable and refreshing."
" Though it may be cliche, I found it to be quite refreshing. A definite session beer. Highly drinkable."
"Not too bad. The colors nice, but the heaviness combined with the sweetness made this one a little much."
"This poured from the bottle a dark gold, very hazy topped by a short lived white head. There is a ton of sediment in the glass no matter how carefully I pour. This is my second bottle, and I know this sixer was well cared for, so I suspect this is normal for the beer. The aroma is very light. It has a touch of lemon citrus, yeast bread, and just a bit of candy malt. Citrus bite up front followed by light caramel malt with a herbal hop and citrus finish. This is a great summer beer. Crisp and light mouth feel. Extremely drinkable. 6%ABV? Hard to believe."
"D- Oberon is very easy to drink and quite enjoyable. The clean finish is very refreshing, wonderful for summer. I could easily drink these all night."
"Smelled wiezeny and citrucy, and tasted like a classic hefe-wiezen. Maybe not as malty or heavy as Schnieder's, but pretty good anyway. I'll probably try it in a bottle next, since I can buy it close to home."
"ps. i still miss solsun!"
"Light orange in color with a fluffy white head. Smells like cirtrus and hops with a tiny bit of yeast as well. The taste has some wheat, a bit of citrus, and some slightly bittery hops. It reminds me of a witbier's big brother, but not that much bigger. Mouthfeel is average, standard, medium, a little foamy maybe. I dig it. Way drinkable."
"Pours a super hazy, yeast laden straw color. Copious amounts of head are well maintained. Aroma is almost candy like, I pick up some freshly made lemon hard candies, along with the usual suspects of wheat, a little biscuity, and lots of malt. What is missing are some spices and hops, not much of that in the nose. Wow, flavor is really where this shines. A huge mouthful of wheat, some licorice, followed by an almost cloying sweetness. This is an interesting take on the style (I'm used to the trad'l Heffes), much bigger body, complexity in flavor differing from those coming from the yeast and hops. This is not as quaffable as the afformentioned style, but quite enjoyable as a single. I will certainly miss the days when this beer is gone. I look forward to trying some other seasonals from this amazing brewery."
"A tasty beer, but a little let down after all the hype I heard. I'd go for another sixer, but wouldn't go out of my way to pick this up."
"Oberon ale is probably my favorite ""summer"" beer. As I was enjoying my first of the year on my porch this weekend, one time I actually had to look at my glass after I took a sip because I thought there was an orange slice in my beer. This is a classic summer wheat beer that has a whole variety of fruity undertones. the beer itself has almost an orange tinge to its appearance. They finish fementing Oberon in the bottle, so it is best (even fruitier) out of a keg or tap, but even with a bottle you are in for a treat."
"Barely drinkable. A real disappointment. Maybe something wrong or outdated with the keg?"
"this beer is certainly not the most flavorful or complex, but for what it is, a refreshing summer session beer, it is superb. something to look forward to when the weather turns nice."
"drinkability: can be consumed in mass quantities"
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. This pours a cloudy light orange with two and a half fingers of frothy white head, great retention, a small amount of lacing. Nose is very yeasty and wheaty, a slight orange and lemon citrus note, fairly strong. Taste is a nice bready wheat malt, strong notes of citrus, slight grassy hop finish. Medium bodied, smooth medium carbonation, fairly creamy smooth feel. Overall this is a really nice American wheat ale, nothing particularly special, but a very solid summer beer."
"btw, believe it or not, i had this at a department store, at the little cafe thing in Marshall Fields at Somerset Mall, weird but cool"
"pours a hazey pumpkin orange with a nice frothy white head with no lacing. Smells of orange rind and a slight wheatiness. I have had the Oberon in previous years and never really understood all the excitement about it's release. But this one is either a little different or I am. I like this one; I'm not sure what's different but it seems much more complex and fruity. Nice tangerine, orange flavors with a very good refreshing mouthfeel. Great drinkability especially this time of year in Ohio."
"Extremely cloudy tangerine colored juice in color with a thin, creamy head. Doughy, lemony, citrusy nose with a light hint of orange, which may smell more like cheap tang. Raw, hearty wheat with a bit of skunk and spoiled fruits. Hoppy for an American wheat, with spicy, floral notes. Pretty full-bodied and creamy for a wheat beer. Not good, at all."
"This isn't a bad beer just not what I would be looking for in a summer seasonal, there are better examples (Gumballhead!)"
"Pours a very cloudy, faint orange, almost yellow color. Gigantic, three inch thick, frothy white head. Minutes go by before the head starts to fade, leaving tons of sticky, clingy lacing, everywhere. Smell is not what I remember. Mostly, bready, yeasty aromas, with wheat and malts in the background. Weak citrus smell, maybe lemons and spice. I remember a huge citrus smell, more like oranges and lemons. Maybe this beer has changed over the years or maybe my palate has changed. Taste is a little weak, lots of yeast,bread, malts and finishes with a slightly bitter lemony, citrusy flavor. Hints of bananas. Lots of carbonation with a slightly dry feeling. Medium to light feel,thin and smooth. A great session beer, especially during the Spring and Summer months. I'm a little disappointed in the taste and smell, I thought both were stronger than I remember. Anyway, still one of favorite beers and one I'll enjoy all Summer long. Oberon is back, baby! Thank you Bell's!"
"Poured from a bottle into an appropriate glass. Can't tell what the numbers mean on the backside of the bottle. An aggressive pour created a small white head that disappeared fast. A fair amount of sediment and yeast are in suspension. A lot of carbonation bubbles race to the top. Banana esters with a little bit of wheat malt and some floral hop aroma. The body is light. Bananas start things off again. Light citrus hops on the mildly dry finish. A good summer brew."
"Good effervescence, medium-bodied. Good aftertaste that doesn't linger overly long. A solid brew but middle of the pack, not a front-runner. Worth a try though."
"drinkablity is good. it very well could be a good session beer"
"Cool label, boring beer."
"I would recommend this beer to anyone looking for a very light and crisp beer. Very clean taste but still delivers. Subtle reminder of Gose, good stuff. Will definitely have to try more of Bell's."
"Appearance is cloudy, golden, and with a decent head that quickly fizzles away to nothing. I think I must have had an old bottle, because all the delicious things other posters smell in the nose aren't in my glass. Overly sweet and skunky nose. Taste is citrus to start, nice earthy malt to finish. Unfortunately, as it warmed, the taste shifted to match the nose. Wishing I had this on tap, at the beginning of summer... I think the drinkability would be much higher. Currently, I'm not sure I want to finish the one I have."
"This beer, in some ways, surprised me. I wasn't expecting too much from a summer wheat such as this, but it was a nice treat. Unfortunately, I only had one of these..I really wanted to grab another as soon as it was gone. A six-pack would definitely be worth a buy to enjoy in the summer."
"This brew pours a cloudy light orange color with a huge fluffy white head. Unlike other american interpretations, this one actually looks like a hefeweizen. The aroma has the classic hefe attributes, but is rather fiant. Bananas and cloves are present, but not strong. The taste is good for an American Pale Wheat; a little smaller than a hefe. Very fruity during the sip, and more so in the aftertaste. Quite nice. The mouthfeel is about the same as most hefes, and thicker than most American interpretations. Overall, this is yet another wonderful beer from Bell's."
"The malted wheat is upfront in the taste as well. The citrus and spice are muted, but the hops are a bit bolder and lead into a dry finish. The mouth could use some help, its a bit thin. Good session beer."
"great summer beer when you're thirsty... you've got to pour it into a glass if coming from a bottle... on draft is the best way, but a good pour from a bottle is a close substitute. seems that is has changed over the past few years and not for the better. not sure if they are messing with the recipe or if they are making so much of it now that quality is suffering... also can have a good one on some days and not so good at a different place... quality is very sporatic"
"It's now October 12th and last night I had what will be my last pint of Oberon for the season. It tasted, looked, and felt like Miller Lite with a few drops of Blue Moon in it. This is definitely not a beer that ages well. Drink it young and early!"
"Light body with biting carbonation is refreshing. Very quaffable, but that can be a problem as this beer has snuck up on me when I've had it on tap. Thank god that bar is 3 blocks from home!"
"The color is a beautiful, pale, pale orange. It would be a very nice-looking beer if there was any TRACE of head. But alas... The nose is fairly complex--there is a hint of orange in the delicate hops. Those are some awesome hops to taste, by the way! Medium-bodied with a syrupy aftertexture. A delicious beer!!!"
"For this style, it is an okay effort. Hop Sun and Gumballhead are much better but this is a decent honorable mention. I can almost guarantee w/o trying it that this beer is much better on-tap vs. bottle. Apricot murk flat carbonation, nice maltiness, hoppiness is pretty well balanced but the flatness is what kills this beer. Still quite decent though."
"Not terrible I suppose. Hazy Orange with no head. Where is the carbonation? I've had it from several places with the same problem. Aroma is too subdued for my tastes. Some nice things there though, with citrus and a wheaty grain taste dominating. Not much spice or banana. Taste doesn't have as much of a zing to it, tastes a little muddled to me. About the same flavors as detected in the smell. A little bit of bitterness on the finish is nice. Body is a bit heavy without the carbonation to hold it up in the mouth though."
"Pint glass poured at Come Back Inn in Madison, WI. Hazy orange with half an inch of white foam. The aroma is a little weak: some lemon and apricot, not much wheat. Tastes like a fruity pale ale. Not much wheat flavor. Crisp lemon. Mouthfeel is thin. Sure this beer is quite quaffable, but other than that it is not impressive. A decent summer beer, but I don't get the cult following."
"Very, very drinkable. After a day swimming and skiing on a lake, this stuff can go down extremely fast. Too bad I can't find it in MA. I also heard that this was supposed to be released in 5L kegs this summer, but never materialized."
"I have not had a beer that I so look forward to drinking it again in a long time. It poured maze with lots haze in color. Very cloudy with floaters, but thats ok with me. citrus/orange taste. I smell a little wheat. Goes down easy. One of the best summer drinks in my book!"
"I came across this beer on tap at Waldo Pizza. I was server to me in a standard American pint glass. Hazy yellow with a small white cap. Citrus aroma. Id swear there was Cascades in there. Wheaty and citus/spice with a nice touch of bitterness. A real thirst quencher."
"This was a decent beer. Have had much better from Bell's."
"One of my favorite beers of the summer comes from one of my new top ten breweries in America (now I need to update my post). So good that I had to fly some of this home with me from Traverse City Michigan. Just a great wheat ale that I could not get enough of -- could be a dangerous session beer if I had access to this one. All great qualities, especially how easy to drink and its light citrus and unfiltered goodness."
"One of the most drinkable beers I've ever tasted. This is my favorite beer from Bell's next to their Expedition Stout."
"very light ginger-aley straw colored appearance with light orange highlights. clear. very bubbly like champagne with little to no head. mild aroma of wheat and some sweet orange along with simple syrup. taste is refreshing, buttery wheat with a crisp lightly bitter finish. grassy. lacks any real flavor depth. slightly corny. goes down mad easy. good summer quencher but in this category there are many better beers. ok for what it is. more taste as it warms, but who really wants this at room temp?"
"Pours a clouded straw color with a modest head that leaves nice lacing. Heavy chunks of yeast sink to the bottom right away. Spicy, citrusy aroma. Nice wheat flavor with a bit of spice and a bit of lemony citrus. Mildly bitter hop bite. Seems to be most closely related to the witbier style, though with a bit of hops to give it an American character. Highly drinkable, maybe my favorite summer seasonal."
"most bell's beers in my opinion seem to be too fat and having too much hops, too much malt, or just too much of something. this beer on the other hand is very tasteful and balanced. citrus aroma, hops and malt are all well represented for this style of beer. the thing holding this beer back in my opinion is the large amount of yeast at the bottom of bottle which takes away from it's drinkability if one is always wondering ""if i drink one more will i have the runs and a hangover from hell tomorrow?"" but it is what it is and changing that might take away from the taste so i'll accept it."
"This a great ale. Good for the pallate and easy on the stomach. Very nice. I get the impression this is a Belgian style because of the stickiness and malt character. Nice to see the Midwest represent a little bit. I'll be going back for more of this for sure."
"Updated taste information: After having another glass of oberon I can really pick out a slight bitterness/citrus flavor at first which then finishes out with a ending wheat taste. It has a smooth mouthfeel also."
"D- There is not much complexity or uniqueness to this beer. It is very smooth but it doesn't have any strong wheat beer qualities nor are the hops really a major character. Nice and gentle for a summer quafting."
"Pours a golden straw color, a little cloudy and with a tiny white foamy head that turns to a spotty, thin coating. Smell is fresh - fruity and floral notes with a pale hoppiness and a bit of wheat graininess. Taste is much of the same and the fruit and floral aspects become more pronounced as it warms. Fairly highly carbonated, but not to the point of a bite. Mouthfeel is creamy but refreshing nonetheless. A good summer beer that went down well on a hot summer day that is approaching 100 degrees. I'm not much of a pale ale advocate, but this was a pretty tasty, fairly complex brew that I wouldn't hesitate trying again on a hot day."
"Love the label. The somewhat bemused sun against the blue background, with the mix of bright and light colors sums up the beer's purpose: a summer brew. Anyways on with the review. The bottle pours out a yellow-orange hazy liquid. It is somewhat opaque, with a normal head, that dissipates rather quickly. Truly the color reminds me of the sun on a hot, humid summer day. The smell is not strong. It is mainly that of wheat, slight hops and a bit of a citrus tinge. Nothing special really. Taste is surprisingly full for a wheat beer. It is crisp, flavorful and ends with a bit of bitter kick. On the palate, the beer holds up relatively well. Obviously not as thick as fuller brews, but for a pale wheat not as thin as one would expect. Overall, this beer comes off well. It is very drinkable, and well suited for a warm, sunny day. Not sure I would feel the same way about it if reviewing in January though."
"Pours a hazy light gold with a head that doesn't last. Carbonation is good and thin towers of bubbles keep a thin white lace lingering around the ring. Not much aroma, just a bit of malt and yeast, no hop whatsoever. This beer has a subdued flavor profile. A little malt flavor, a little yeast flavor, a light citrus hint from the Saaz hops, and some hop bite which continues into the aftertaste. A light refreshing beer that would fit in the ""lawnmower"" category."
"edit: Oct. 26, 2006. I've tried this beer again after it's distributional debut in the state of IA. On second thought, this beer does indeed stand above its competitors in the pale wheat style. Much hoppier than I remembered it (centennial), though I believe it is much fresher than when I previously had it as well. Very, very drinkable. Like a beer version of tang, but much less tangy."
"Tastes of grainy wheat. Hints of lemon and farina (!?!). A bit bland really. Mouth is crisp. Pretty drinkable I guess. A half step up from most boring American wheats but that is faint praise indeed."
"Golden shimmering nectar, hazy with mystery and promise. Pillowy and white, the head makes me want to jump in and take a nap. Yeasty, bready aromas waft upward, followed by slight hints of tropical fruits and citrus oils. My tastebuds are massaged by the smooth creaminess, flavors penetrate, spice -wheat - flowers - apricot/banana - yeast. Drinkable? Damn skippy."
"Well I've probably had this beer over 100 times and I've never rated it, so last night when I had one I figured its about time. Yellowish opaque white in color (served with an orange which I removed) with a white head. The beer is loaded with malt, bread and sweet wheat, and citrus. The flavor is sweet with moderate bitterness, wheat malt blended fresh bread, and a slightly fruity and even more slightly spice. As a wheat beer it has plenty of body and a nice lingering sweetness. This is one of the best summer beers out there, refreshing, not overly hopped or spiced, and well balanced."
"This is a really good summer brew worthy of trying. If you see it, do give it a try."
"Goes down easy, but the alcohol content is a little higher than most wheat beers, so session drinkers should be wary."
"overall this was a very clean and refreshing beer. i would have to agree with the majority of reviews when i say this is problably the perfect summer beer. definitely worth a try!"
"Batch # 6766"
"Pours a golden yellow with a chill haze. Very white head develops and eave a small 3 mm high remaining head. Smell is of grains. Slight bitterness and a grainy taste on first sip. Very refreshing in mouthfeel. Almost lager like in smoothness and ease of drinking. Actually I take that back because it isn't as light as a typical pilsner lager. Most notice is taste is malty and of grains. Mild citrusy taste. I've had this much better on tap where you get the sludgy bits near the bottom and it takes on a much more tangy taste. That is when this beer really shines. It's bottled version has been taking on the life of the Midwest's version of Fat Tire."
"This is a safe beer. No real adventure to speak of. This would fall into the ""if nothing else is available"" category it would be a good beer, but I'll pass on buying more."
"Much better (and I assume fresher) than last time I had this beer. There was a big malty presence that was clearly the basis for the classic wheat beer flavors, Which were delicious anyways. I could taste a little alcohol, which was definitely an attribute of this beer. Excellent wheat beer, served at my request without citrus garnish. This is a good beer for any summer wheat occasion."
"I've been drinking this beer for years. Time for an update on my review. this beer pours and orange color with foamy white head when poured right. The head usually disappears a while after the pour. It smells of fruity esters, citrus, & yeast. The taste pretty much follows the nose. There is a definate fruit presence. Orange and also a yeasty flavor that is rather nice. Maybe my taste buds have changed over the years but this beer taste a little more yeasty than it had in years past. Good mouthfeel and overall a very drinkable beer. I consume more Oberon than any other beer ever. A beer like this can make Michigan winters real long since this is a seasonal summer brew."
"Fruity, juicy and highly spicy in taste. Its tanginess awakens the tongue and then rings out mildly bitter. It's even slightly drying. A unique wheat beer. Tasty and damn refreshing, despite its medium to full body."
"Drinkability: There are other beers I'd rather have than this, though it's still a great treat and surely something to be drinking on a summer day for a refresher for both body and taste buds. With some more care and attention this could be a damn fine beer, but as it stands it's good. Not something I'm going to buy a case of, but something I'll definitely try again."
"Oberon is one of my favorite summer beers. It doesn't fit neatly in to any catagory. This beer might be best defined as a double wit, or some other clever new style expansion. It's a great beer to sit on the docks and watch the boats come in. Oberon is still THE Michigan summer thirst quencher."
"Not something I'm likely to buy too often, but could see myself buying it two or three times a year, when in the mood for something different."
"Mouthfeel is crisp, smooth and slightly creamy. Much more body here than most wheats, which makes me happy. This is an all around great summertime brew. Seriously drinkable and refreshing...I could see a six pack disappearing on a hot summer day no problem!"
"Pours out a cloudy golden yellow color. There were some chunks at the bottom which I managed to put into the beer. Head is very fluffy and white due to the wheat malting. Some lacing. Smells sort of like a good hefeweizen. I can smell banana, fresh fruit (strawberry?!), and some vanilla spice. Nice! Taste has an up front snap followed by banana flavors; finished off by a little hop kick where I usually get clove spice from the German hefe's. Not too rich in the mouthfeel. This could be a good beer to prepare someone for a real German HefeWeizen. In otherwords, this beer isn't as complex as some of the other wheat beers of the world, but is very drinkable nonetheless."
"Americanized version of a Hefe Weizen (without German Weizen flavors and aromas of banana esters and clove-like phenols) brewed with Saaz hops. Spicy and fruity, O.G.1.057"
"Very good offering from the Bell's family of beers. Poured out to a dark golden yellow color with a medium head that maintained a presence all the way to the bottom of the glass. Strong notes of citrus and fruits were detected from the get go. Flavors of wheat, citrus and biscuts were noted most. This brew also had a unique smoothness, almost reminding me of butter. Finished smooth and slighly bitter. Not a bad beer at all. Recommended."
"Served in a pint glass with an orange wedge. A cloudy pale gold color with a decent white head that leaves nice lacings around the glass. It smells citrusy, a lot like oranges. Also smells of strong of hops, and some wood-like notes. This beer tastes of mildly bitter hops at first, followed by a lemony-orange flavor that is finished with a warm bread taste. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied. This one makes a wonderful summer beer. Definitly worth a try!"
"This will be an excellent summer refresher, should go very well with a little beer can chicken.."
"Pours a cloudy, hazy yellow orange. Nice head and lacing on this. Aroma is faint, yet fruity. Perhaps it's my consumption of these on hot summer days, but the aroma also reminds me of a barbeque. Taste is slightly dry and spicy of hops. Not the thick, rich sweet malt that I was used to in previous batches. Mouthfeel is okay, a bit thin for me but well carbonated. This is *THE* Midwest summer beer, at least for now. It's hard to imagine a ride on a boat, or a backyard grilling session without oberon."
"I remember this particular beer being a heck of alot mo' betta around the turn of the century ( maybe 98, 99, 00 ). I used to look forward to its arrival during those days. Yeah, it was about the only micro I had ever dipped into in those dark ages. Malt liquor and other macros were my bread and butter and Oberon was my only trump card. Still, I think it has depreciated in character and taste since then based on the last few sixers I've drained. Now I had a crummy glass off tap too. I am shocked and hurt. I want my Solsun back! I have hope."
"Slàinte!"
"Arrives at the table with some doubts. The beer is a super light, almost yellow orange but with a decent head, which quickly recedes. Aroma is of malt and wheat. I don't get many bannana or hop notes from the nose. Taste is well balanced but just lacking something for me. Starts grassy, has a little citrus kick in the middle and finishes with wheat accents. Mouthfeel seems a little too thin in my opinion. While it's very drinkable, this just does nothing for me. In a way I was hoping for beer more in the vain of Gumballhead, but what i got was more crossover beer/Berghoff-esque. Will try again, but I'm not too excited about it."
"The only downside to this beer was the mouthfeel. Too much bite on the tongue keeps me from following the first beer with a second."
"A bit out of season, but what the heck? Pours a cloudy yellow and has no head after a few seconds. It has a very yeasty, buttery aroma with a few citrus notes. The flavor is refreshing, light, but with a full body, and a decent bitterness that persists throughout... Not bad at all. It is nothing like a German wheat, but it is it's own beer. I hope to try a fresher example this upcoming summer."
"poured a hazy yellow with a large frothy white head. freash grain aroma with a doughy raw bread quality. sweet body at first and a fairly balanced mass-appealing taste to follow. probably pretty good during the summer, but note any other time for my tastes. I do get a citrusy note in the end followed by some alcohol."
"Typical summer ale, light bodied, light-medium carbonation and a cloudy pale yellow. Pours a one-fingered, white head that settles quickly but leaves some lace. Looking for the wheat and not finding it, this is a pale without the bitter hoppy aftertaste. 12oz bottle $1.75, from Liquor Barn, Lexington, KY."
"Pours cloudy with light orange hints on yellow background nice yeasties floating around. White head with lace, good looking beer. Aroma is grainy wheat light bananna and clove with citrus hints, little subduded. Taste is wheaty with tangy citrus tangerine mixed with banannas finishes lightly peppery with hints of clove and a touch of bitterness. Unique flavored wheat not bad but think I prefer the more traditional flavor. Mouthfeel is good a good medium nice almost creamy. Drinkability is good the citrus element is a little strange but growing on me as I finish. Thanks to merlin48 for the sample."
"Pours a nice clear amber with a bleach white head. Loads of carbonation filling up all sides of the glass. Smells of orange peels, among other fruits, and relatively spicey. A great sniffer indeed. Tastes very malty at first, with a well balanced middle when the hops start showing, and finishes very hoppy with a nice spciy bite. Well done. A great brew, the first I've had from Bell's, and based on this it won't be the last. Recommended, indeed."
"#101 on rate beer.com starting over with a mich beer.poured hazy golden with average size white head with lots of floaties. aroma malts, fruity, yeast, orange and hints of lemon.flavor sweet with some bitterness orange,banana, and hint of honey. had this after working outside in the heat (88)and the beer was very cold It was pretty good as it warmed the taste started to deminish"
"Actually pretty drinkable, not much there, so not much there to complain about. Oooohhh... Larry Bell, you're tricky."
"The beer is very soft and comforable on the palate and is a good all-around beer. I could drink this beer all day if I could get a hold of it again."
"This poured out a very murky and cloudy yellow with a white head that almost shot up over the top of the glass. The head stuck around for a bit and left rings of lace as this was drank. The aroma was yeasty with a bit of spice and a lemony zip to it. Also there was a good amount of sweetness present in the nose. The flavor started off with doughy malt and lemony notes and a bit of banana. There were also notes of various spices through that taste. It finished with a dry spicy after taste. Mouthfeel is medium and feels pretty heavy on the tongue. This is pretty tasty and wheat beers are usually not my thing, but I could drink a lot of this if I was in the mood. Great example of the style and a great beer."
"Saw this in the store but shyed away from it since Im not the biggest wheat beer fan around. Went to dinner that nite and it was the only decent thing on tap. Poured a nice lite hazy orange color. Not a lot of aroma-slightly floral,almost a touch grassy. Nice crisp flavor-touch of citrus. Some fruit notes in there but I cant honestly say what kind. Very well balanced and refreshing. Good summer beer or a great alternative to anything heavier you might have with a meal."
"Champagne-like mouthfeel. A bright beer. Pineapple, yes...apricot and plenty of Bell's signature - hops. The finish bites back nicely. A complex beer closest to a belgian white style - but done in an American (Bell's) fashion. Summer beer delivered well."
"The mouthfeel was dry and smooth at the start. The finish was dry with a light graininess. Enjoyable, and an overall nice brew."
"Oberon Ale is my favorite summer brew plain & simple. I love weiss type beers in the summer because they are so refreshing. Oberon is unusual and simply damn tasty with a slice of lemon. The appearance is the usual cloudy weiss look but a bit more golden. The aroma is unique with citrus notes and nutty overtones. The taste is solid with a drinkability to last all summer long!! Sit on your deck and sip an Oberon as the sun sets on a weekend evening; almost heaven (IMHO). If you like summer weiss brews, this one will become one of your favorites quickly."
"Will have to try this beer again."
"Drinkability: I could see these going fast if it's your style. But it's just a little too strange for me. But, I did finish my pint unusally fast, trying to figure this one out. So, drinkability is good."
"Poured a straw cloudy color with small head that quickly disapeared. Smell is of grainy wheat and a sweet, citrus, yeasty almost unpleasant scent. The taste is a real disappointment, it is just sweet. A sugary sweet taste with no balance whatsoever. It leaves the palate with the same sweetness. It does have nice carbonation but the sweet taste is too overpowering. I could only drink one. Give me some salty peanuts for cryin out loud. I Won't drink this one again."
"Not too impressive, I was excited to try a Bell's product, but I probably should have picked something else, pretty boring."
"marketed as a summer beer, it seems to come out a bit different from year to year. a good summer staple, recommended."
"Very refreshing. A good wheat beer and not overpowering. This is the best wheat beer I have had! However, I'd have to leave it in the bottle!"
"Sampled from a 12 oz bottle. This one pours a cloudy gold with a small beaded head. Very mild aroma of wheaty sweetness with some spicy hops, & a hint of clove. Very light in the mouth with spicy hops & high fruitiness. Understated flavors of banana, lemon, tart green apple are evident. Finish is clean with some gentle peppery bitterness. Well balanced, easy-drinking, but somewhat uneventful brew."
"This wheat beer pours a hazy golden color. Its smell is crisp and very indicative of its wheat nature. Its taste is tart and sweet, and again it is quite apparent that this is a wheat beer. It is slightly more carbonated than most beers I drink, so the mouth is greeted with a pleasant tingly sensation with each sip. A fine beer from a very fine brewery."
"Cloudy in appearance on the pour. Color is a dark amber-orange. Sparse head (despite the aggressive pour) faded quickly to an ""edge-only"" ring. Scant lacing of the glass. Aromas have notes of orange peel, fresh bread dough, and some spicy notes as well. Flavor continues the aromatic trends. Suprisingly low levels of wheat flavor noted. However, this plays well with the spicy/zippy/zingy flavors of citrus. Hops are present in the background, showing up with more pronounced flavor near the end. Aftertaste is sweet and doughy. Very balanced. Good mouthfeel and very drinkable. Excellent summer beer. Another winner from Bell's."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" bright white head above very cloudy light amber brew. Head doesn't last too long, but then most wheats don't, and laces average or a bit below, also not unexpected for the style. Aroma is kind of an earthy, wheaty aroma, and not a strong as I would expect. Taste is subtly citrusy, combined with a nice wheat malt body. Mouthfeel is good, and the drinability is very good. A nice summertime brew."
"Drinkability  This is not my style of choice, but for what it is trying to do I think its a solid effort by Bells."
"I must say that I like this beer much more on tap than in bottle--and I'm not generally one to make a huge deal out of the serving. With that said, out of the tap comes a lightly hazy golden lemonade body with a wispy white head. Smells of snappy wheat malt, with refreshing citrus hoppiness and yeasty character throughout. Taste is solid, crisp, wheaty malt up front with a light biscuit element. Mones into a refreshing, almost sour citric hoppiness. Some yeasty taste. Finish is citrus bitter tang. Medium bodied, yet thirst-quenching and a great summer beer."
"Very well balanced overall. Thick and yet smooth at the same time. Almost a buttery finish."
"This just might be my favorite wheat beer to date. Bell's has done a wonderful job with Oberon and I now wish that I had picked up an entire six-pack."
"Maybe it's because I'm a big fan of German wheat beers. American wheats seem bland to me. But since I just had Samuel Adams' Hefeweizen, I think Bell's Oberon Ale is just a tad too light. I would hope for a bit more substance. But this beer is still quite drinkable. It is a decent summer choice for drinking on a hot day."
"A nice change of pace from what I usually imbibe. Recommended for a nice summer Ale."
"Velvety smooth, silky texture -- it's like a carnival in my mouth! Very drinkable, could stay with this one all night. Classified as a weizen but impresses me more as a hybrid cream ale. Best of the Bell's products I've tried, and that's pretty impressive."
"This is a quality session beer for the warmer weather. Good enough to have a few on a warm day. I might get another 6er or two before the summer ends, hopefully supplies last that long."
"Pours a hazy straw color with a hint of orange. No real head when poured but when roused forms a thinish white head. Aromas of yeast, fresh bread, wheat, and a bit of lemony acidity. The taste is spritzy, lemony, with a hint of yeast imparted complexity (perhaps a hint of banana and a bit of clove). This is a nice easy drinking hot weather beer. I like the bit of lemon-acidity, whithout which this beer would be a dud. As this beer warms up the fruitiness picks up a bit. There is a nice bit of spiciness, which seems to be from a hop contribution. Certainly recommended if you are in need of Summer time refreshment."
"Notes: I think I'd rather have two hearted ale, but its another solid beer from bell's."
"From the tap pours a hazy golden color liquid with a white foamy head. The head did not stay very long, and there was minimal lace on the glass. Smell was a wonderful combination of oranges and spices. Tastes grainy, slightly sour with some zestyness to it. Seems like corriander or another spice is in this, almost like a Belgian Wit, but not quite. The finish was very yeasty, and seemed a bit off to me. It almost seemed sandy at the end. Light body, and probably could have used more carbonation. Overall, this is not bad, but something about the finish just didn't seem right to me. Could be refreshing, I may try this one again in the future."
"A fine beer for this upcoming summer. A nice, refreshing treat that I probably will have quite a few of. Thank you Larry Bell!!!"
"D&N: Just a flat out awesome summer beer. Refreshing as hell, with really nice aromas and flavors. Well done, Larry!"
"Drinkability: An eminently sessionable beer and a good all-around summer quaff - goes well with just about any summertime food you'd care to name, and you can have four or five sitting on your back deck without hurting yourself too badly."
"Well this is a strange wheat beer indeed. Tastes more like a trippel to me, but a little on the weaker side. I got some very heavy fruit notes in the nose, but more reminiscent of a belgian than a wheat beer, heavy ester notes that seem lighter in a wheat beer. Very sweet heavy fruity taste, not very good for the style, but I don't care, I think this is more of a wheat tripppel or something like that than a wheat beer proper. I drank four of them in a row after a couple Optimators on draft, so I'm fairly drunk, but I would say this is a drinkable beer that I will return to. Again, not very good for the style, too sweet and not 'wheaty' enough, but very interesting beer."
"Yellow-orange in color, slightlt coudy with a thin white head. Aroma is lemony with a floral hop note. Flavor is light and fruity with a strong malty base. Sweetness is balanced almost a hint of a sweet tart. Flavor is moderately dry with a very slight sweetness lingering. Mouthfeel fairly light without being watery. Drinkability is outstanding."
"Very easy drinking beer with a fresh bracing mouthfeel. Im glad this beer is becoming more available as it is always a welcome sight."
"ng"
"As far as drinkability goes I am sure I could easily plow through a sixer of this stuff and still not tire of it. Alltogether nothing remarkable but still a decent beer."
"Taste: bread, and and fruit, a slight hoppy aftertaste. This is a great one for the summer, I can picture myself drinking quite a few of these around the grill"
"The taste is bread and malt and a has a little of a wine/champaign puff to it. It definitely grows on you."
"A summer wheat. Mmmm. Poured a cloudy darkish yellow. It's best taste feature is it's dryness, as noticed by wife, the wine connosieur. Comparitably to a good champagne, although better IMHO. Some fruityness, little hops, but oh that dryness. It kept that feature thoughout."
"Full-bodied and easy to drink. I hope to be opening up many of these this summer."
"Cloudy golden color with a small white head that disappeared down to a thin film quickly. Smell is mildly malty with wheat and a hint of lemon. Taste starts like other wheat beers: lightly sweet malt, wheat and yeast flavors and a lemony fruitiness... but then finished with a nicely spicy hop finish. Not enough hops to overpower the wheat beer feel, but enough to be a bit different for a wheat beer. Mildly sour aftertaste. Light to medium body, not too much carbonation. Very refreshing and drinkable. A very good American wheat."
"Pours a pale orange with a cloudy haze and slight white head. Smells of a sweet fruity aroma but this is mild. The taste is a smooth creamy body with hints of fruits and that hefe character that we look for in these brews. Hits the tongue and dries it out a bit with the esters swimming all over the mouth. Very soothing as it hit the throat and pleases the tastebuds. Decent hefe and I can't wait to drink it on a warm summer afternoon."
"Didn't get much of a head on the pour; couldn't detect a smell either in the glass. But the taste charms: refreshingly lacks the overkill on banana and clove. I taste wheat and yeast for the first half, and subdued hops finish out the second. Mouthfeel is wonderful--it's a ""light"" summer beer in taste profile but the body is weighty enough to hold its own. A pretty beer, as most weiss are - cloudy and lemonade-yellow."
"2004: Just purchased my first case (this year, heh.) and the Oberon maintains its wonderful flavor profile. I wholeheartedly agree with the review written by feloniusmonk. Could I have said it better? Perhaps, but his review sums it up nicely.This stuff rocks my world."
"This is a good wheat beer, but it ain't no German. A darned good faker though, the beer pours a vibrant pastel golden yellow, and offers up a nice snowy head and above average stick. Aromas are somewhat sour-they lack any of the hallmarks of the style, ie. banana, clove, bubble gum...more emphasis on hop here. Flavors are of a hoppy version of a German Weisse, with a good dose of sticky malt to boot. A sour aroma remains in the glass as i finish this thing? A nice job, and one I'll revisit, but gosh darned it, not in the same league as its percursers."
"A great brew. Unique taste and smell along with great feel in the mouth makes this beer a winner."
"2001: A fantastic summer beer. Unfiltered, somewhat yeasty, with a light citrus taste. This is what a summer beer is all about. A treat during the warm months."
"Not one of my favorites from Bell's, and I fear I might not like it at all if offered in a blind hefe-weiss taste off."
"12 oz bottle pours a hazy, honey, golden color..short lived white head fades quickly without any lacing. A wee bit of sediment is observed on its way to the bottom of the glass. Aroma is impressive, with oranges, vanilla, and a hint of cloves.. Mouthfeel has moderate carbonation, some creaminess, and some hops twang. Taste has banana and cloves, but a biscuity yeast seems to dominate...this ale may be past its prime. The finish is of tart fruit, like green apples, and this seems out of place. Overall, it's pleasantly drinkable, and the carbonation sticks around to hold everything together. Not my favorite Bell's, but worth a try if you get a fresh one."
"Not quite up to german standards, but much better than most american interpretations. A solid summer thirst quencher, not quite appropriate for the January weather I drank it in, but I cranked up the heat and wore flip flops and shorts in an attempt to recreate the experience. Not really, but it sounds like a good story, right?"
"Served on-premise at KBC. Cloudy, good color but no real head. Lemony flaver, certainly sptrizy and refreshing. KBC's taproom, the ""Eccentric Cafe," though, leaves a little to be desired. Exposed brick just makes it seem cold, not much of crowd (of course it was a football Sunday and they had no TV). Seemed to be run by artsy college students."
"Soft yellow brew, the color of scrambled eggs. Pleasant with a unique, almost lemony nose: few things edible or otherwise come to mind: it's not woody or bready, not particularly fruity or citrusy. The palate IS obvious: very smooth, creamy, dry, quenching. not malty, not hoppy, yet medium bodied: it must be all about yeast. But that aftertaste...typical of all Bells..."
"Bell's Oberon Ale poured a very hazy/cloudy yellow gold with a nice white head with fine bubbles. It had a wheaty, citrusy aroma. It had a nice slight citrus taste with a hoppy finish. Wheat beers are normally my favorites, but this is a good specimen."
"A nice American version, but not in the class of the great German hefe's. Nothing at all to put you off, but doesn't pour as impressive as the best versions, and the taste is subtle (but relatively bland overall). In my area, we happen to have a lot of choices for German hefe's, so I've had most of the best. Good effort from Bell's, but if you can get the German hefes, by all means seek them out."
"Zum wohl!"
""
"A warm the Sun has got his hat on, hip, hip, hip, hip, hooray to FeloniousMonk for this Beer."
"Appearance: Hazy golden with a tint of orange here white vibrant frothy head, lacing is scattered but full in spots. Aroma: Contains some citrus notes bready yeast notes and sharp malt sweetness along with a light flowery hop aroma. Taste: Refreshing as all hell, not every crazy about American wheats but this one is so damn crisp and balanced right amount of breadiness, sharp malted wheat tones, what makes it is the citric bit of coriander kick in the finish very nice ale nicely constructed one of the best Summer brews I have tasted out there. Mouthfeel: Medium to light perfect carbonation some residual oily sensations on the palate nice brew. Drinkability: Wow, pick up a case and enjoy simply best lawnmower beer out there with flavor."
"Light gold color. Medium head. Aroma is fruity and sweet. A medium bodied American Wheat ale. Malts are fruity and slightly sweet. Hops are fairly floral. Well balanced. Very nice wheat beer. Light and refreshing. Flavorful wheat beer. Very nice. Mild tasting yet, so well constructed wheat beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"Poured a slightly cloudy straw color with a thin head that disappeared rather quickly. Decent lace, but not great. Smell was yeastywith slight hops and even less malt. Some lemon hints noted as well. Taste is a bit too bitter, that is to say too much I think for a wheat ale. Its over bitterness takes away from its drinkability on a hot smmers day. It is still a very good brew, but not a great one like Bell's is capable of. I do have to add that the six pack I purchased from my local beer store had their entire supply of this at room temp and the package very clearly indicates to ""KEEP REFRIGERATED"". This may have altered its taste. I guess I will just have to visit the brewery since my parents noe live about 10 miles from there."
"Again, a hearty thanks to feloniousmonk for opportunity to try this."
"Orange-golden in color with a thin white head. Appears to have a high level of carbonation. Aroma is a lot of yeast and some orange peel. Taste is predominantly wheat with a lot of yeasty flavor as well. I won't go out of my way for this, but I can see myself drinking this if I ever find myself in Michigan."
"Pours a hazy orange-golden color with a creamy white head that dissipates into a fair amount of lace. Nose is sweet malt and yeast with some faint notes of orange zest. The same sweet malt is also present upfront in the taste along with some wheat followed by a bit of soured yeast. Touch of fruit towards the end with a mild bite of citrusy hops in the finish. Light to medium in body with a lively and refreshing active carbonation. A nice summer beer. Thanks to feloniousmonk for the sample!"
"The color is wonderful, nice and pale but hazy with a slight orange hue to it. There is a nice medium amount of head, with a wonderful aroma. Nice and wheaty with a grassy earthy smell. As I kept drinking I noticed more and more fruity (orange) smells coming out. The taste is slightly tart with a nice body. Good mild hop flavor and bitterness which is what you expect from the aroma Overall a pretty good beer (and I am not a Hefe drinker, but of all the hefes I have tried this is on of the better ones out there)"
"This beer was a light orange color and very cloudy with a solid white head, which didn't stick around long. The aroma was nice, orange peel, coriander, wheat, and a sort of grassy hop character. The taste wasn't bad but not near as deep as the smell. A slight bready flavor hits up front followed by a citrus-wheat flavor. At the back of the throat is when the slight hoppiness kicks in for a nice finish. A bit of yeast in the aftertaste. The carbonation is low so it goes down very smooth. A thin to medium mouthfeel. This beer would be very drinkable during those hot summer days."
"Poured a slightly hazy yellow typical of a heffe. Bell's Pale Ale was more hazy than this though. Anyway this was a delightful beer, refreshing with a hint of the wheat flavor. Do they use honey at all? I am not sure if I could taste the residuals of honey, but the flavor made me think of it. Good beer, refreshing, wished I had more than the one bottle from tavernjef."
"Poured a beautiful, tasty-looking orange color that was very murky but concealing plenty of carbonation. Had a thin sponge head sitting eternally and lots of good wheat beer lace. Smell was faintly of summer fruits and serious hay and wheat tones. Taste was a firm wheat with fruity tones to it. A long bready finish slowly rolled into hops. But, like many a good American wheat beer, this has it all except the yeast to give the great scents and flavors of a traditional hefe (see Paulaner, Weihenstephan)."
"Overall, this a good wheat ale. Nice summer beer woth seeking out."
"Now this is a fine summer drink. It pours out cloudy with a large foamy white head. Its a murky gold color with sediment actually visable (maybe i didnt mix it in well enough?). Its taste is quite good, citrus flavor in front of a spicy hop bite in the back. One of the better hefes that i have had. Try it out on a hot day."
"A light, dry, transparent straw color, quick head. Smells of the yeast, and an unleavened bread feeling takes over. The taste is very pleasing, much like the bread. Somewhat dry feel with a nice bitter taste and a fresh citrus quench. One of the best Wheat's I've had."
"This beer pours a nice orange color with a nice sized head that leaves a solid amount of lacing down the sides of the glass. Aroma of yeast and hops with a slight fruitiness. The main flavors are of tarty fruits, esp. orange. Saaz hops are used and are a perfect complement to the tartiness. Grainy malts seem to be in the mix as well. Coriander is also a strong flavor in this beer. I don't really know if this should be called a hefe but I do know that this is one great beer from one great brewery."
"This brew poured a very large invigorated head of finely sized white bubbles and a cloudy orange unfiltered yeasty body. It had a decent hop aroma and was slightly fizzy in its initial mouthfeel while coming to a smooth finish with its mild hop flavor."
"This one just begs for a piece of cheese to enjoy with it!"
"Drinkability - Wow. A nice summer brew with great flavor and balance, just enough taste to lure you into more. Perfect for summer."
"I had this one in a 12oz. bottle poured into a Bell's pint glass. It pours a slightly hazy yellow-orange with many yeast chunks floating about. There is only 1 small finger of head, and almost no lacing. The smell is full of fruit, some citrus aroma, maybe orange. The taste has some citrus and peach flavor. It is a little yeasty, but quite refreshing. The body is fairly heavy for a wheat. This fine summer ale also has a great drinkability."
"This wheat ale is very well balanced in my opinion. Begins on the fruiter, wheat side. Finishes slightly dry and mildly hoppy. Mouthfeel is such that it takes nothing to sip this brew, and one could easily have many on a warm summer evening. Slight carbonation to start with, and finishes smooth and dry. A nice interpretation of an American wheat, and a great summer brew at that."
"I had a draw of this while in Wisconsin, This prompted me to by a six pack. The tap beer was GOOD! Good head nice taste. I bought a six pack of it to bring home. I opened the beer. No head. The nose was still OK. Some fruit, yeast and malt. The taste still had some bite. But overall it was just flat tasting compared to the keg stuff. The only thing that saved the review is that this is good tasting beer. Good malt character and some bite. I will try this again. It must be the batch."
"The beer smelled strongly of apricots and slightly yeasty. The fruity smell was more tart than sweet, and reminded me of Magic Hat's #9. There was no sweetness or tartness to the taste. It was very crisp and clean, a little yeasty, and a very light mouthfeel. This is decent summer ale, light, no heavy tastes, although the flavor is slightly lacking. It's extremely drinkable, however. I had two, and that's a lot for me in one setting (short attention span)."
"Looks like a Belgian Wit, deep honey colored with thin white head., wnd little retention. Aroma is a bit yeasty with heavy wheat malt presence. Very crisp on the palate which reminds me of a belgian style. Flavor is mediocre. A somewhat generic bland flavor to it that reminds me of Blue Moon's white. No great flavors really jumping out at you. Finishes slightly bitter, and a little stale."
"Addenum: I have been drinking this beer for at least 10 years (back when it was called Solsun) and my only beef is that it is the most inconsistent of Bell's brews, even varying between bottles of the same 6-pack. I have tried this about 10 tens this year (2005) and all 10 times it has sucked. If I were to go by this years experience, I would be hard pressed to give it a 2.5. Since the move to Comstock, this is now a yeasty pungent swill. Somebody has fucked up big time. The rating above is based upon my prior tastings, and I can't recommend it any further."
"Originally sampled on 2 October 2002. This beer pours a cloudy yellow color. The flavor has a nice bite on the palate. It very much reminds me of a white beer. I think that this is a pretty good American wheat. Not one of Bell's best, but certainly very good."
"Poured a large envigorating white creamy head with fine bubbles. The aroma appeared to be citrusy. The lacing was sparse on the sides of my glass. It was bitter tasting and it left a lingering aftertaste. I was expecting a better brew than what this one turned out to be."
"I'm not sure what I have here. Certainly a wheat, lightly tart and clean, but not at all a phenolic German, a fruity Belgian or an insipid American. Surpising caramel malt notes well balanced with the wheat flavors. Not like any wheat I've had before. Not spectacular, but interesting and ejoyable."
"Pours a cloudy golden orange with a fluffy white head. A lot of particles are visibly suspended in the body. Aroma consists of wheat, citrus, baking pizza dough, some sweetness and just a hint of banana. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, starting off smooth then turning crisp. Pleasant wheat flavor with a hoppy bitterness in the middle. A citrus finish rounds things out and has a lingering grainy quality to it. A very refreshing summer ale."
"-F"
"Clear bright golden color with moderate lace and head. Aroma was malty with somewhat pungent yeast smell. No aroma of hops at all. Taste was smooth and malty, with a bread doe flavor, and a dry mouthfeel. No apparent esters were noticeable that are typically found in wheat beers, which was disappointing. Nice beer, but a little dry and plain."
"This beer is a king among summer wheat beers. Take a while to stare down the artsy sun on the label, and it will put you in the mood for an Oberon. It's a Saturday afternoon type of beer - a great lead in to a long night. Fruity, lemonish and light. The perfect summer beer. If this beer were an artist it would be Van Gogh."
"A golden orange, cloudy beer with a thin head. I detect the wheat presence in the aroma along with tangerines and hints of lemon. The wheat malt provides a nice texture, smooth, crisp flavor. An array of fruity flavors, but mild and very refreshing. A mild hop presence. Very drinkable, as noted on the bottle, a great summer brew."
"Pours almost no head. Fizzy. VERY cloudy. Looks almost solid. Apricot/Peach/yellowish color. Nice, strong wheat aroma, some cloves. Strong presence on the tongue. Oddly bitter aftertaste. Not as crisp and refreshing as most wheats. Very earthy. I could have a few in a sitting, though. Nice beer."
"This is an enjoyable wheat beer although it lacks the strong banana and cloves smell and taste I love in Hefe's...The nose on this is yeasty with a strong whiff of sweet pinneaples..body is light...low carbonation...Nice sweetness...Extremely thirst quenching...a great, easy drinking summer beer with a nice taste but lacking in special qualities I like in my Hefe's..seems ot be a mix of a Whit and an American Wheat and a great hybrid at that...If you want a traditional Bavarian Hefe this isn't it...if you want a tasty easy drinking summer wheat beer then this is for you"
"A slightly unique wheat beer, but fantastic and one of my new overall favorite beers."
"Drinkability: Good for what it is. I'm not a fan of the American wheat style because I think, for the most part, it's a boring, bland style of beer. However, this one is pretty good, and I could see myself drinking a few of these when the weather turns hot and sticky during the summer."
"It pours a nice bronze-orange color with a thin white head. The body is a little cloudy, but hey it should be. The taste was fruity, citrus, and breadlike. A remarkably smooth drinking beer that you won't even realize that you drank ten or twelve of them till you get your tab. I recommend this be consumed on a patio in the sun, then well into the night....."
"Bright orange-yellowish color with small suspended yeast particles floating around, has a small white head that doesn't last, light citrus aroma, light bready, malty flavors it leaves a flowery aftertaste.It has a very creamy and full mouthfeel, not as spicy and fruity as I remember, still very enjoyable and refreshing."
"This beer says Summer to me. Yes, it does speak, and it says- shhhhh don't say anything, listen to me bubble. Look at my cloudy golden, orange color with slight white head. Smell me - I'm all about spice and everything nice, like clove and vanilla,earthy hop, and a hint of sweet malt to tempt you. Come, taste me, I'm quite yummy if I do say so myself. My aroma follows into the flavor- spicy and yeasty, clove and vanilla, citrusy hop, orange rind finish. My medium body is perfect for holding these flavors, maybe a touch heavier than needed but still refreshing as a summer quencher. I look to my glass to reply but, alas, she is gone........"
"Pours more or less like any other wheat beer -- a little cloudiness in its orange-gold color with a big white head. Mild citrus aromas but fairly undistinguished and simple. Taste is smooth, malty, fruity, and a little buttery up front; but it moves to a crisp hop bitterness at the back. To me, the flavors just don't match up. It's jarring more than balanced. It's OK, but it's certainly not great."
"Pours a foggy darker yellow color with a medium white head. Aroma of yeast and light hops. Light bodied with flavors of hops and fruit but not in big doses. Finish is crisp and progressively bitter throughout the glass. I found this to be a little mundane but it was not too bad."
"This beer pours a very orange color with a medium white head and moderate lacing on the glass. The aroma is filled with hints of citrus and other fruit along with wheaty characteristics. The taste was surprisingly low in wheat and very smooth. This is one of the first Bell's beers that I've really enjoyed drinking and I would recommend this to most people."
"Thanks feloniousmonk!"
"This beer was a slightly cloudy, light yellow or light gold color with a smallish white head foam that lasted for quite a while and laced well. The nose was quite nice and included malt, some breadiness, and a bit of a fruit sense. There was a strong sense of tartness and a bit of fruit and grain in the taste with just a hint of floral hops. The overall sense of this beer is of a relatively full body and a pleasant lingering taste that finishes a bit sweet and sour. Complex."
"On Tap: Thanks to FM, Color poured a super pale, hazy light yellow, and had a very tight leveled out type of lacing just above the white head. Smells of zesty lemon and some spice, very clean and crispy. Taste is much like Belgian witbeir, very spritzy, lemon is sharply toned with a spicyness mixed in that blended well. It's mostly lemony then anything, imagine a Sprite or 7up with three times the lemon and add some wheat and yeast and wham-o, you've got this Oberon. I've had it in the bottle before, but on tap is so much more yeasty fresh then from the bottle. Super drinkable and highly recommended for quenching thirst on warm to hot days in summer."
"There are many tasty, thirst-quenching wheats out there, but only one Oberon. The fruitiness really pushes it forward! Supreme acheivement, and a beer I'll be enjoying all summer long!"
"Thanks to feloniousmonk for this bottle!"
"On the pour, a magnificently chill hazed golden yellow color, the head is mountainous in size, creamy in consistency, and as it erodes, the lace left behind is a fine cover upon the glass. The aroma of yeast, orange peels, sweet malt, quite a treat for this old nose. Sweet with lots of malt, the top middling in feel to the palate, finish has a moderate acidity, the hops spicy in their persistent bite, dry as a desert bone aftertaste, quite a nice beer."
"This was a very pleasing domestic wheat beer that would be great in the summer months."
"Overall a good wheat ale. A nice balance of malt to citrus and floral hops with a touch of spice. A little more carbonation in the body and a little more sparkle on the tongue would help make this a much better and more refreshing ale IMHO."
"This opaque, orange amber beer pours with a solid two-finger head that shows excellent retention. It slowly fades to a rcoky layer of foam and produces a delicate lace. There is a yeast component to the aroma, but wheat and hops are the dominate notes. Also a hint of clove and coriander in there as well. Impressive. The taste is very crisp, with the wheat snap right up front. Coriander/cilantro notes are evident, with a slight sweetness creeping in. A bit of hop bitterness is coupled with some light alcohol notes. The yeast contributes to the flavor but is not evident as ""yeast"" as in many wheat beers. There is no breadiness to the flavor. The finish has a crisp, wheat tartness that is very refreshing. Decent bitterness lingers on the aftertatse. The mouthfeel is solid, but not remarkable in any way. Perfect for enjoying any time of the year. The drinkability is darn near exceptional. This beer refreshes, satisfies, quenches, and then gets out of the way. I hope to get a few of these for the summer. I remember when this beer was on the Top 50 list, and I thought to myself ""I will probably never get to try that beer."" Well, thanks to cretemixer for sending me a couple of these great brews that only months ago I believed to be inacessible."
"It is very much a Michigan summertime staple,although my friends stock up to drink it year a round.Good cloudygold'orange color,taste of orange in the palate along with a little buttery tinge.The butteriness comes through for me on tap,have drank way to many of these I think,and boy I do miss it so!"
"Golden/straw in color with a white head. Leaves a good amount of lacing. The aroma is fruity, biscuity and sweet. The flavor is biscuit malt that flows to a fruity, sweet finish. The beer is light in body and refreshing; a very good, easy drinking brew. A good beer for the summer."
"This beer has a really unique honey yellow color to it with considerable haze and an average head. Smell is somewhat weak, dominated by crisp grains and citrus notes. Smooth, sweet, citrusy taste that lightens up nicely at the end. A refreshing feel to this beer with a nice crispness at the roof of the mouth. Typically good wheat beer drinkability; not the best of its style but darned good."
"I love the cloudy golden color though some may get turned off by it. Not a whole lot of head to speak of. The aroma of fruity undertones hits me immediately. Very smooth taste that is extremely drinkable. A great summer quencher and excellent beer to introduce premium beer to friends. Most wheat beers are served with a lemon wedge, but this one doesn't need it."
"I remember the debut of this wine as ""Solsun."" We loved it then, and it's still good. Big, candied-orange-peels-preserved-in-alcohol aroma together with notes of suede, beach sand, and watermelon. Bold, sweet attack delivers nuances of mace, melon and green leaves. Sweet alcohol fuels a galloping finish of fine grain and mineral bitterness. A mouthful."
"I have never had a beer to my memory that gave off the smell of tangy peanut butter.  The very hazy straw color sits bellow a foamy cloud of a head.  The clean crisp flavor has a very unique yeast character with a noticeable tanginess and a light malt with a spicy twang of hop bite.  This is a very complex and tasty beer."
"Had this on tap after a unsatisfactory sample in the bottle.  The taste is much more balanced, and the flavors complement each other on tap.  The overwhelming apricot/orange flavor from the bottle is more muted, and adds to the taste rather than dominating it.  Very nice and refreshing."
"Hazy light orange topped by a dense, rocky and well retained head that leaves lace.  Wheat tartness, cracker like malt, yeast must and a spicy Saaz hop nose comprise the aroma.  There's more character aromawise for the insipid style.  Sweetness and lightly citrusy esters are discernible upfront, then give way to bready malt and a mild fruitiness from both wheat tartness and citrusy hops. The mild hop bitterness offsets the light residual sweetness well, lending an overall balanced profile.  Fuller in body than than the typical American wheat, yet light and clean enough to lend excellent drinkability.  Finishes a touch sweet and lightly grainy.  Oberon is a highly drinkable brew with more overall character than the average American wheat."
"First, I really do like this beer.  Nice wheat beer that's not a Hefe.  Huge head that settled slowly, fairly lacey too.  Different but adequate aroma of graininess, but not necessarily wheat in quality.  No hop presence.  Yellow-gold, slightly cloudy. Nice ale smoothness, medium feel, a little low on the carbonation.  Mostly malty flavor, hops for balance only, hardly dectable. Little sweetness that is in the front and momentary but carries a tartness/citrus/fruitiness (pear?) to it too.  Malty dry finish that is satisfying.  Very good summer ale."
"I've never tasted a wheat beer as complex as Bells Oberon. Although the appearance threw me off at first (it's a very pale and cloudy), the taste certainly makes up for it. For a wheat beer, it's got its dose of finishing hops, which I love. It's fairly carbonated and has some yeasties floating throughout. As far as drinkability is concerned, there's no other beer that I can think of that I'd rather drink on a summer day than Oberon."
"This is one of the best, and most unique wheat beers that I've had the pleasure of drinking.  Apricot / yellow, with a thin white head, which dissapates quickly.  Aroma of apricots and yeast.  Yeasty bread flavor, with a touch of citrus.  Excellent hops flavor as well, something you don't come across too often in this style of beer.  Crisp, very carbonated, with a medium body.  Very refershing. Excellent beer!"
"This was a great summer wheat beer to have at my humid, hot walk home.  I have had this in a bottle, but on tap, it faired better than some of their others.  It poured a cloudy golden color.  It had a white head that subsided while leaving little lace(one drawback to the bar pouring).  The aroma was of hops, citrus and lightly of some spice.  The flavor was of hops, malt and citrus.  The finish was a bit citrusy tangy with some light bread overtones.  Good beer for a hot summer day"
"this is a huge hefe....my first kalamazoo brew and it seemed to have survived the trip up here overnite in hot trunk of a car  (thank the beer gods).   very cloudy, dark gold and thick....nice head going on here...lots of lace...tons of yeast sediment worked up...smells very citrusy...with  grassy, earthy, undertones.  really doesn't taste like a traditional hefe....lots of wheat malt and hops, very refreshing and lively in mouthfeel and character.  in fact i have goose bumps drinking this because my beer taste buds recognize that this is something special.   a superb summer brew."
"Cheers to Deuce for the sample!"
"Pours a super hazy golden with a nice fluffy head that sinks just a little too quickly.  Some large yeasties are suspended in this brew.  Smell is of floral, slightly spicy hops and some lemony citrus.  Sharp lemony/orangey citrus flavor on tongue as well as some nice spicy hoppiness.  Some light, bready yeastiness is detectable as well.  Crisp and refreshing, this is one of the best summer brews I have had.  Very refreshing and extremely drinkable.  My only regret is that this beer isn't in circulation down here in VA.  Thanks to Deuce for the sample."
"Darker orange color, cloudy, small pourous head. I think it smells like a crushed peach. Sharp citrus, sharp on the tongue. After it rolls over the tongue it's quite smooth."
"Not as much head as a lot of a head as I was expecting, but it does have a nice dark apricot color. The first aroma and flavor that you pick up is apricot. A good bit of it. That's followed by the expected wheaty and malty flavors that start to dominate towards the middle of the glass. Some citric crispness is present througout. Very little bitterness or hop characteristics are present. This is an awesome wheat beer."
"Another ballsy beer from Kalamazo, and they dare to do it with a ""summer"" beer.  Nice combo of wheat, yeast flavors, leaning towrds the citrusy end of the spectrum.  Nice heft for a hefe-weizen.  I could drink this year-round.  Thanks proc."
"I don't really care for this beer's chalky yellow body, but I love that thick rocky head - it doesn't go away!  Overall, a wonderful brew.  Wonderful spicy aroma just hints at the complexity and richness of the flavor, which is yeasty and wheaty.  Just how drinkable is this beer?  Well, I bought a case on Monday and I don't see it lasting past tomorrow (Thursday)."
"This cloudy golden brew throws out a nice frothy white head with some retention.  Nice vanilla and clove on the nose.  Taste is very refreshing.  Tangy aspect apparent.  Light to medium body with nice carbonation.  Wheat is there, but not overbearing.  There's not that huge phenolic character typical of a lot of hefe-weizens.  This is a good brew though.  Great by the pool."
"Hazy brown amber, head settles in at 1/4-1/8 of an inch.  Aroma is massive and full...nice nutty and sweet spice in smell.  Pronounced banana bread flavor, but traces of too sour notes.  Hop bite.  Starts flavorful, finishes astringent and thinner.  Refreshing as a cooler, I was looking for far less acidity and sourness, as implied by the smell.  OK, not a favorite, though.  Just too sour..."
"Not great, but, I will certainly enjoy this one again."
"This beer is such a great summer beer,6.5%abv.and very smooth,almost to smooth.Nice and cloudy,and wheaty on the nose.Creamy going down,round and balanced."
