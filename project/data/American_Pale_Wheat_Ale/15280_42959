3.4,7.9,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Enjoyed from the can in a pint glass.  This blonde ale pours a lightly murky blonde with a moderate white head that dissipates quickly to a light ring and little lacing. Nose of lemon zest, orange zest, wheat, and light sweet bread.  Flavors follow the nose rather simply with lemon zest and orange appearing to the back followed by a light coriander bite, a mellow wheat flavor is also present on all sides.  Drinkable standard American Pale Wheat.  Perhaps a step up from Blue Moon as a decent session ale after a nice day of mowing the lawn.  All in all, nice without being overbearing on the citrus flavors with a smooth flowing mouth feel and light carbonation.  Solid ale.","Brutaltruth","Feb 24, 2015"

3.58,13.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled in 9/2014. Pours lightly hazy bright golden color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, orange peel, coriander, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, straw, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, spice, and earthy hop notes; with decent strength. Taste of lemon, orange peel, coriander, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, straw, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy herbal/spice bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange peel, coriander, wheat, cracker, bread, straw, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Good balance and robustness of pale malt, spice, and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a very solid spiced pale wheat ale style. All around good balance and robustness of pale malt, spice, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 04, 2015"

3,-4.8,3.75,3.75,2.5,2.75,3,"Slightly hazed body, eggshell white head forms a cloudy three fingers worth with fine even lacing. Aroma has a nice sharp wheat and citrus combo with very mild spice additions, limited coriander which is usually a good thing for my palate. Flavor wise there's some biscuit bread dough layers with a very chalky yeast in the finish, slight hint of citrus peel and coriander with a relatively lackluster overall flavor. Carbonation is light, not much on the palate as far as textures go but still not a horrible beer, under 4.5% it's light and refreshing and keeps you wanting to experience the next sip. It has a trademark Atwater characteristic it misses the mark on the style and ends in a generic watered down version of a witbier, I appreciate it for what it is but can't really look at this as a beer I want to keep buying.","WVbeergeek","Apr 15, 2013"

I definitely caught the orange peel initially, followed by the inherent spiciness of the coriander on the nose. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was much more like a Wit than an APWA. I would submit a correction, but the BFG program has been disestablished, so apparently the program will somehow pick up this discrepancy at some point. In the meantime, I will CANsider it as an APWA. It had a nice orange citrusiness on the tongue, followed by the peppery spiciness of the coriander. Finish was quite dry, very nice for summer.

2.86,-9.2,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Pours a hazy light yellow color with a small head that fades very quickly. The beer leaves no lacing at all to it. The smell is of wheat with a hint of floral aromas. The taste is of wheat with a little hint of citrus. There is a moderate to high amount of carbonation. The overall drinkability is okay. It isn't very complex and the beer leaves you wanting more as opposed to other wheat beers.","goblue3509","Jul 01, 2009"
2.81,-10.8,3.5,2.5,2.5,4,3,"It's got low abv and it goes down easy, it's just a little too sour/acidic for my liking.","JoeyBeerBelly","Jun 26, 2009"
4.03,27.9,3.5,3,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability: A great session beer. Not a mind-blowing beer, but it sure is smooth, tasty and easily approachable. A sizer would go down easily. Worth seeking and trying.","Risser09","Jun 20, 2009"
2.24,-28.9,2,3,2,2,2,"First sip is refreshing...like water. Bland, bland, bland. fizzy, then nothing. There's a slight citrus/spice/irrelevant note. A bad beer.","hreb","Jun 18, 2009"
3.15,0,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Credit for Bottle Art. Pours an ultra pale hazy golden color, visibly effervescent, with a loose foamy white head that fades quickly to spotty patterns of lacing. The smell is descent. From the bottle residue it was sweet and the initial pour was all about the orange peel with hints of the corriander that got stronger as it warmed. The mouth feel isn't as lively as it appears although it is light. The wheat flavor is initially strong up front then the spicy character kicks in. Drink it quickly while its cold.","jjayjaye","May 15, 2009"
3.47,10.2,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D: Overall better the average showing here. A nice dry pale wheat backing with wet citrus and lime notes blend together making for a decent summer time blonde. Goes down easily enough, would beat the heat with just the right amount of abv at 4.5% making for a good lawnmower beer.","beerthulhu","May 05, 2009"
3.2,1.6,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"D - In conclusion, I don't know whether I personally like this beer or not. I got one of these for a friend so I'll be interested to see the reaction to this beer. Very few reviews on here and the range is pretty big. Overall, I believe this is sessionable and a nice summer brew","beerman207","Apr 23, 2009"
3.92,24.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The other beers I've had from this brewery have had a tart/sour undertone. Maybe because of the style, it works well here. It's an American Pale Wheat with wit spicing, that works well here. A refreshing summer-time brew!","jwc215","Apr 17, 2009"
3.03,-3.8,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Hazy blonde with a skim of white foam that leaves a little sliding lace on the glass. Smells of dishwater, orange candy and faint spice. Tastes kind of like an orange dream = Orange and vanilla ice cream soda with some mild yeasty funkiness. Light bodied and creamy. Tastes too artificial and processed for me.","biggred1","Feb 03, 2009"

1.38,-56.2,4,1,1,3,1,"I was looking forward to this one as i'd yet to try it. it came to me in a glass and the foam had been poured off. this isn't the fault of the brewer so maby it had great head. the main problem with this beer was infection. I'm sure it was an infection because when i sniffed it i thought for a second maybe i was at the movies about to dig into a 12 dollar medium popcorn. it had a very noticeable diacetyl aroma and taste. past the buttery flavor i could taste blueberry almost which i'm sure wasn't intended either. it'd be interesting to taste one from a different batch.","rightsideways","Aug 21, 2008"
2.45,-22.2,3.5,3.5,2,2,2,"Served in a tumbler. Poured a pale, translucent straw color with lots of tiny effervescent bubbles and some tiny yeast floaties. Two inch, rocky white head began to collapse within seconds before settling into a thin foamy cap. Some lacing, but poor adhesion. Scent was clean, pale wheat, some citrus and a light hoppiness. Taste was weak and watery; a pale comparison of the nose (no pun intended), with a great deal of citric acid coming forth. Mouthfeel was bitingly astringent and light-bodied. Carbonation was also a little high. Considering this brew would and should qualify for a session beer based on style and character, I was dissapointed at how it all came together and how unrefreshing it was.","Jwale73","Aug 07, 2008"
3.02,-4.1,3.5,4,2.5,2.5,3,"Cloudy and muddled light orange body. Creamy one finger white head. Lace comes in droopy rings. Strong aroma of coriander and orange peel. It's nice though. I like it. Plus some faint lemon zest and biscuity malt aromas. The flavor is a little too high on the artificial ""orange"" notes. There's some tangy wheat tones as well. A little too tangy and sour. Mouthfeel is a little flaccid and lifeless. This one is average at best.","Bighuge","Jul 28, 2008"
3.58,13.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light pale wheat scent along with a bit of coriander and orange peel. It's refreshing with a citrus edge. The taste is decent as well. It has a dry wheat malt flavor that's light and easy drinking. It's quite citrusy with just a hint of coriander. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a pretty good drinker. It's on par with Coors' Blue Moon.","WesWes","Jun 29, 2008"

1.86,-41,3,2,1.5,2,2,"A new beer at Trader Joe's, I was warned that this wasn't the best beer we have over there. Boy, that was an understatement. Off smells and flavors are abound in this brew. Rather than there being a pronounced orange peel and coriander flavor, I taste hay and corn - not a good sign. The mouthfeel is almost water like with a touch of carbonation saving it just a little. The pale golden color and the nice sturdy head is really this beer's saving grace. Oh, and the cartoon lady on the label has a Detroit tramp stamp - that's awesome. Not recommended (except for the bottle).","montageman","0"
