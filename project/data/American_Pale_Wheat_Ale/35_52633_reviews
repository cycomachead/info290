"This was my favorite wheat beer for the longest time. It was also my first. I haven't had it in forever, so my points for it go to nostalgia, but I know I'd still like it if I drank one now."

"Overall – An alright beer, but nothing to call home about. This is one of my lesser favorites that Sam Adams produces. Even so it is not a bad brew."

"I didn't expect to like this, but it was much better than I thought it would be. It pours up a pale straw with a two finger white head which stays around for awhile. It doesn't leave a whole lot of lacing though. The smell is lemon, banana, and honey. Taste is fairly mild and mostly follows the nose. Mouthfeel is okay with some nice carbonation. Really an okay beer."

"O: A not bad but unexciting wheat beer, pretty thin and light and refreshing, but really boring overall."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a weisse vase, the beer is a pale, slightly hazed, goldenrod coloring with a thin, sparse, filmy white coating on the surface. Aromas of lemon, banana, and berries mix with some minty and herbal highlights. Flavors are more malty than you would expect, with a buttery and slightly toffee backbone. The herbs come forward again, this time as a slightly strong highlight. Overall, the flavors are a bit all over the place...they stumble into a lemony, sharp, muddled aftertaste. Slick, slightly oily finish. This was not a good brew, no matter how you look at it."

"Boring ol yellowish clear. white head of 1 finger and little to no lacing. just the same ol boring taste feel and finish. could have just as well had a boring miller lite. yes this beer was that terrible to my taste buds. not much flavor nor any thing good."
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't see why Sam Adams keeps this going with the similar (and better) summer ale available. Probably won't purchase again."

"This is a yellow-gold colored beer with a faint haze. White head that is a little smaller than expected. The aroma is muted, but has the usual wheat twang. The taste is much better than the aroma...meaty citrus, flowers, and yeast. It's both tart, sweet, and fruity. Refreshing. Medium in body. Crisp, clean finish. Good overall summertime brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad wheat ale, the bi-coastal nature a decent idea. Another good'n for sipping away lazily after too much time in the Pacific sun. Woe is me."
""
""
"This wheat beer pours a slightly hazy medium orange gold color from a 12oz bottle. No noticeable sediment. Small, quickly diminishing, white foamy head, without much lacing. Odd for a wheat beer, it seems. The aroma is flour, cereal, and lemon drop. Medium bodied. The malts are cereal and wheaty. Herbal hops. Not that much like claimed hefeweisen as claimed. Little banana and clove. Not as smooth either. More tart and sour. Finish is crisp and clean. An interesting wheat beer. Not my favorite BBC offering, but solid."

"O: decent for the style, but I couldn't get into this one"
""
"O: Dominated by lemon, this almost tastes like a radler instead of a wheat beer. The wheat and coriander make their way into the taste, but are almost completely shut out of the nose. Make this a little more balanced, and this could be better than just average"
""
""
""
""
""
"This was bad. It had such a foul, sour, tart flavor that was completely unwelcome. I will never get this again."
""
""
""
""

"This is a very drinkable beer with a decent flavor, but it looks rather bland."

"O- Good for a wheat beer, pretty close to a hefe-minus the banana notes."
""
"Ov: I was pleasantly surprised with this beer. The citrus notes are mild and the wheat adds just a mild layer of complexity. I find this more engaging than a Blue Moon. It doesn't have any icky syrup-like texture. Very smooth and refreshing with a mild honey-like character. Would drink again. Cheers!"

""
""
"O-Another poor fruit beer from SA. So far only their blackberry is decent. Maybe they should stop putting fruit in beer."
""
""
""
""

"Overall: This beer turned out better than expected from my initial judgement on its appearance. Not necessarily seeking this out in the future but I wouldn't mind drinking another."

"Pours a hazy golden from the bottle with a small white head. Aroma is hay, wheat, some honey, and very very mild citrus, a bit of yeast. The flavor follows suit with plenty of hay and yeast, but only a brief influence from the citrus. A bit light on the palate in a watered down way, rather than a light carbonated way. This comes off as a little stale in the finish as many wheat beers do. Overall, I'd drink it again if around but would not buy it off a shelf with all the other options."
"O: This would be very good on a hot day, but I could only drink one and it isn't something I would really reach for over other beers. Pleasant enough but nothing special."
"Poured a one inch custard head which faded after a minute. The body is a hazy raw sienna yellow color. Smell is surprisingly rich with malt for the style, and I don't get any of the citrus. But then the taste reverses with lemon up front and just a mild aftertaste of malt. It's mildly sweet and has a slight acidic zing. Quite frankly it was better than I was expecting."

"Overall - Not a bad taste but a little spicier than I enjoy."

"Poured very light gold, with visible carbonation but a small head and no lacing to speak of. The smell is pretty non-existent and could use more power, but I actually quite liked the taste--it's not very strong as far as wheat goes, but the lemon is obviously natural, it blends nicely with the wheat and there is some exciting spice which I believe they've added to the brew. Hops are earthy and offer a good contrast to the lemon. I was surprised by how winter-y it felt once I was drinking it--a spicy muted summer, exactly what I want when there's a blizzard outside."

"I am not a fan of this beer. Way to sweet and chewing gum flavor really throws me off."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an easy drinker with nice citrus notes that I could consume several of and not be put off by. But as far as style goes, I think it falls short with the wheat grain bill being to low as well as the bitterness."

"O- A decent beer. Would be good to get someone into the wheat style of beer, which is one of my favorites."
""
"Poured a cloudy gold with a small watery head. Smell was a dry lemony mix as was the taste. Lemon and wheat were balanced out fairly good. Dryer finish with wheat still lingering around in the aftertaste. Pretty decent beer with the lemon twist added. I like most of sam adams offerings and this wasn't bad but not stellar by any stretch."

""
"Overall - not very good, don't waste a purchase."
""
"I had to dig at the store to get to this beer, so it might be a bit old, but it shouldn't be out of date. Either way, it was no good. I've had two disappointing beers tonight."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This came in a sampler pack, so I'm not too upset, but I would never pay for this on its own."

"Poured into a pint glass, the first thing that hits you is the nice clean citrusy aroma. The body is a nice burnt gold color and is slightly hazy, but the carbonation is clearly visible. It’s topped off with a nice thick white head, and is very bubbly and frothy but doesn’t last long: there is some mild lacing too. Strong citrus aromas like oranges and lemons come through, but I also pick up some apple and mild wheat. His beer is light bodied and slightly bitter overall, but it is crisp and goes down smooth. Citrus flavors are very present but not much else, there is a slight tart aftertaste when you swallow this beer. This isn’t a bad beer but it definitely looks better than it tastes."

"Overall: Not my favorite SA brew. This is some serious weak sauce. I guess if you were reeeaally thirsty and it was a reeeaally hot day this would be enticing...but so would lemonade. Drink a glass of ice water instead and save the beer calories for something with flavour."
"i liked the amount of carbonation in the beer and it is very like the beer i'm used to drinking. I think sam adams does very well with this beer. I think i would buy this again sometime."
"Has a fairly robust mouthfeel with good carbonation throughout. Not a fantastic beer, but refreshing nonetheless."
"Overall not a bad brew, slightly bland but not unpleasant. Would be a decent and easy drinking summer beer."
"O: Somewhat lost of an identity. It's a decent beer, but doesn't hold my attention very long. Great for a hot, summer day, and better than the macro-breweries, but definitely has room for improvement."
"Taste is quite malty. The lemon comes out nicely with wheat. Mouthfeel is decent and goes down easy. Good for summer."
"O- Pleasent, but not great. Could use more focus on the wheat malt bill, but on a summer day, this is welcome."
"just...not a good brew by Sam Adams. c'mon guys, you can do better than this! this is even worse than their summer ale, which is also way too lemony. avoid, unless its free."
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow with a nice lasting white head and good lacing. Aroma of light fruity esters, some light banana and wheat notes. Taste is same as aroma with some light malt and grassy hay notes. Light crisp body and good carbonation on the palate. Light wheat and fruity notes with a lingering light malty taste on the finish. Overall a quite pleasant easy drinking summer brew."
"O - Just an average beer here. Not the best but certainly not the worst."
"Thanks #1"
"O: overall this is a good offering, but not as flavorful as others in the style. Crisp and refreshing none the less."
"Overall, this is a nice beer that I would gladly have again."
"O: Not the worst APWA I've tried. Has more of a citrus profile than some, and the heavier mouthfeel is a plus for me."
"Sorry SA, this one does not make the cut."
"Overall, its a miss for me. I've had much much better wheat beers and this is just flat if you are really looking for taste. Has its place at a BBQ"
"I started out with a finger of foamy, bone-white head, but by the time I finished typing the above, it was down to wisps. That seems like good retention in my book! Color was a cloudy (not hazy) orangish-yellow. Nose had the characteristic ""snap"" of wheat malt, but I would have guessed orange as the underlying citrus smell, vice lemon. Whoops! Mouthfeel was relatively full, approaching creamy, with a definite citrus presence, but not a tart one. It was like a Creamsicle, reinforcing my earlier stance on orange, vice lemon. Finish was so much like a Creamsicle that I now wanted one for the first time in years! Yay, summer!"
"Kind of doughy flavored with the formentioned honey, bananna and lemon. A bit grainy in the finish. Mouthfeel is light but more full than I was expecting given the style. Lot's of carbonation that fizzes in the mouth. Decent beer to have if it's available but not one I would seek out."
"Overall, I disliked this and won't get it again. At least SA tried something new, its just one something I liked at all."
"Overall – The beer has a nice refreshing taste and is very easy to drink. It kind of reminded me of 'Shock Top' - not sure that is a good thing.."
"O- Very disappointing for a Samuel Adams product, if it wasn't so bland, I'm sure I would enjoy it more."
"Flavor is the typical Sam Adams ""wheat"" flavor that many of their other beers follow. (Think white ale, summer ale, etc.) just with a bigger blast of lemon flavor. It's a slightly sweet beer. Not overly complex or even all that flavorful. Has a short mildly more sour lemon finish. It's not a bad beer and it's hot out so I'll go ahead and have a few more. It's crisp and refreshing. Would stick with Summer Ale though."
"O - Good brew but would be better with some more flavor."
"I was not impressed with this offering from Sam Adams. There are much better wheat beers out there, so don't waste your money on this one."
"O:Has a great color for its category, fairly good smell and taste mixed with a light body make this a decent beer to enjoy"
"overall i have to recommend avoiding this beer. sorry sam."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow with a thin white head. Smells spicy and citrusy. This has a very strong lemon flavor that is relatively crisp and relatively unimpressive. Even though I don't particularly like wheat beers, I really think this one needs a lot of improvement."
"A bit of haze in this golden colored brew. Fairly small white head is pretty sticky. Nose is light wheat, with a bit of lemon. Light wheat front, some lemon, kind of a touch of soapy taste. Medium bodied, pretty smooth but it does have a little bit of a bite. I dont know, not horrible, but not my favorite SA summer brew."
"A good warmer weather brew. Its nice that thisone is brewed all year for the warmer climate area's. A good citric ale thats not a summer seasonal."
"M: The mouthfeel is soft, generally light throughout. The few rays of citric brightness are a nice change of pace."
"I dig this brew. Note, I typically despise fruit beers. This is a pleasant wheat beer with just the right hint of lemon flavoring. Pours a nice hazy gold color. Smell is of light wheat and faint citrus. Taste follows suit. Crisp, light and refreshing. Really a pretty decent brew for warmer days."
"Overall - Uh, well, this isn't one that I am going to be buying again or will even recommend to a wheat beer drinker. I'm a little disappointed that the Boston Beer Company would put out something like this considering the amount of good beers that they have been putting out recently. In my opinion, they need to retire this one and head back to the drawing board."
"This beer pours a hazy, gold colorthat leads to an aroma of bread, citrus, and vanilla. The flavor is mainly citrus with notes of honey, spice, and caramel. It's got a medium mouthfeel, fairly thick for a wheat beer, filling. Samuel Adams Coastal Wheat is an okay beer, slightly recommended."
"Overall: Not a whole lot of dimension to this, but it is very good. It makes a nice refreshing summer beer. Theres a good chance I would buy this again. A note, I'm still a little surprised at the flavor given the way it was described at the Boston Beer Company brewery tour. They said that since plenty of people were putting lemons with the Hefeweizen, they took that and used it to develop a recipe with lemon peels added. So I was expecting more Hefeweizen flavor in it. Not disappointed with the result, given"
"This beer is without a doubt a summer time brew. I poured this into a regular pint glass and it was a really nice cloudy golden color with a fluffy white head. The aroma screams lemon and has the softness of the wheat in there too. Smells almost like a weak lemonade. The flavor is packed with lemon zest upfront then it fades to a nice wheat backbone in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light and smooth like a wheat beer usually is. Overall it's a decent brew when in season."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This American Pale Wheat Ale poured a pale straw color, it was a little hazy. It produced a nice white head and it had average head retention. The aroma of the ale was dominated by lemons and yeast. The body is on the lighter side, but it is has a decent mouthfeel and is fairly drinkable. The taste of the beer is what you expect from a pale wheat ale- The lemons add an amount of character to it, but it doesn't really do it for me. I think there is almost to much of a lemon flavor for this beer. This beer is merely average- Not one of Boston Beer Company's best works- but it will do for this early spring afternoon."
"Overall - Best Sam Adams I've tried thus far. I can see myself enjoying this beer again in the future."
"Overall Drinkability - Pretty decent beer. Nothing to write home about. But I didn't leave feeling particularly disappointed. Got what I expected."
"Overall - A light beer with smooth and petite flavor"
"Call me provincial, but I usually prefer my wheat from the more internal parts o' countries. Regardless, this stuff pours a clear golden straw topped by a short-lived finger of white foam. The nose comprises chalky wheat, light lemon peel, very light coriander, and a firm touch of banana. Something seems vaguely off, though. Can't quite put my finger on it, but it's not entirely either pleasant or un-. The taste follows kinda closely, replacing the lemon peel with some orange zest and replacing the banana with some rater iron-y hard water. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, a very meek little beer, something that theoretically could be easy to drink, but not necessarily something that would elicit a desire to do so."
"D: It's an OK beer but it just comes out as light. I would say this beer would be better during the summer monthes...."
"Overall: For what Boston Brewing Co. was going for, I think they made a successful brew. A lower ABV may force me to give a higher grade."
"O: This brew is a little to sweet for my taste. Not terrible but it would not be my go to wheat that's for sure."
"Love this as a late spring early summer type of ale. The lemon zest is not overpowering, but absolutely noticeable. Not as hazy as some wheat ales, but this is not one of my prerequisites. Overall, I would recommend this very drinkable beer. Samuel Adams strikes again."
"I was surprised how clear this beer was, bottle says hazy, but not as hazy as a wheat should be, pale yellow and clear, tasted very light, light body easy to drink, overall not too impressed, easy drinking beer, may be good to watch a ball game or out grilling"
"Poured a hazy yellow in color with a large frothy white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. The aroma was of straw like malts, citrus hops, with a heavy odor of yeast. It tasted of lemons and yeast with an light bitter lemon aftertaste that dissapeared quickly. Mouthfeel was very light with a dry texture. Overall an average wheat beer."
"This is without a doubt an above average tasting wheat beer (something imo rare for sam adams), but the mouth feel and the way it all goes together is rather disappointing. I've always felt that drink ablity and mouth feel were mostly a continuation of how much you enjoy the taste, but in this case I like the taste more than the drinking experience."
"D: super light, but the body has a reasonable amount of complexity. not the best beer for the season, but a tasty example."
"The taste is very light and somewhat disappointing. What should be a refreshing and drinkable beer is marred by a Smokey middle. the finish is somewhat better but this is anything but a refreshing wheat beer."
"D- Appearance and smell kind of gets me all pumped up and then there was a giant let down on the taste and finish to me. Overall this one is just so so for me."
"Pours a hazy dark yellow with a big head that both retains and laces quite well. Smells of hops, light fruits, and citrus with a slight metallic smell. Tastes of spicy citrus and hops with notes of wheat. Moderately high carbonation and a moderately light body with very little bitterness. Nothing too complex here, but a very drinkable wheat ale for a warm day with an appropriate ABV. Not bad, not great, but good!"
"This is my personal favorite from Sam Adams. It tastes just like the name ""Coastal Wheat"". It has awesome drinkability. The added lemon gives balance and brightness. The alcohol content is way better than ""Cherry Wheat"". So that just adds to the value. You get great hop flavor & it's refreshing."
"The drinkability is pretty decent. On a hot summer day, I could see myself drinking a few of these. But, on a cold January night, Coastal Wheat comes off as a fairly mediocre offering from Sam Adams."
"Overall a nice beer. I did find out that my preference leans towards putting my own lemons in American Pale Wheats. The lemon is good, but tastes a tad fake."
"overall too light and too bland to even think about. will have to pass on this one if it ever comes back around."
"Poured from the bottle a creamy golden yellow with a fizzy white head that disapated quickly and left soapy lacing on the glass. Smell was overly lemony almost like a cleaner or pinsol. Taste was terrible light malt flavor didn't pick up any wheat and then came the lemons...way too much lemon that left u with a horrible lemon soap aftertaste. Mouthfeel for this beer might have been its best attribute creamy and soft with a fuller body than expected. Drnkability for me was nill. I tried to drink it let it warm up nothing.. Drain pour and will not be looking to have another."
"Super disappointed with this beer. Started off with a nice head that died in seconds. After that it was just boring, barely any wheat to speak of, and barely any citrus notes or anything along those lines, basically just a bad attempt at a wheat beer."
"Overall: B"
"This beer gets a lot of stuff and maybe its because it isn't Samuel Adams best beer but it shouldn't be compared to other beers score wise. With that beign said I think this beer alone without looking at the other better ones is actually a really drinkable refreshing beer. If you like the flavor you can easily have a whole 6 pack with the summer like beer flavor and lower alcohol content. I bet its not high in calories either. It does smell like subtle lemons mixed with wheat. Its not like disgusting hit you in the face artificial mikes hard lemonade type of a beer no not at all. This is definitely a beer because that lemon taste and smell mixes in with the hops they use very well. It then leaves you with a very nice wheat malt to finish it off leaving citrus and some real lemon mixing with the hops. Nice carbonation as well. I'd pick this over Blue Moon any day."
"D- Medicinal aftertaste makes this hard to finish."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Coastal Wheat is a slightly hazy, peach-orange color with a solid white head comprised of many fine bubbles. I have several chunkies floating around in my beer. The nose is rather unremarkable, other than the lemon peel and malty backdrop. Flavor is also rather unremarkable with an off medicinal taste that seems out of place. Mouthfeel is probably one of the better aspects of the beer; medium to full in body with a viscous and creamy carbonation. Overall, not a very good beer - certainly not for BBC - I usually find myself liking most of what they put out, but this is not one of those beers."
"I wouldn't recommend this to anybody, unless they are a fanatic of sucking lemons or eating 3-4 boxes of lemonheads a night. Luckily I bought a varietly 6-pack and only had to suffer through two of these bastards. Two thumbs down."
"D: Very drinkable and very Sam Adams."
"Has a nice subtle lemon aroma. Has a creamy taste yet has that lemon zing to round it out. Very refreshing. Has soft milky amber color.Dry with very little after taste. I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Best served cold on a hot summer day. I'll be looking for this one again."
"D: It's an OK beer but it just comes out as light. A good beer for some occasions."
"The mouthfeel is about right, just a hair too carbonated for my taste. It's incredibly drinakble though. This is a pretty good beer, I think I'd enjoy it more on a hot day than in the cold of winter here. Worth trying, for sure."
"D - This has decent drinkability. It's an okay beer, but I think they should tone down the lemon a bit. This would probably be an alright beer for drinking out on the beach on a hot day."
"Smell is a rush of lemon and citrus. The appearance is a pale color with vivid flushes of a light gold color. Very smooth and a very sweet beer. The drink-ability is superior...I could only best describe this beer as a light form of Sam Adams Summer Ale. Truly a great beer from the Sam Adams line."
"This is a decent beer, but not really my favorite style. Cutting the sweetness would make this better, in my opinion."
"12 oz. bottle, from the Samuel Adams Winter Variety Pack (why have they replaced Black Lager from the pack beats me). Hazy golden pour with a foamy (wheat ale type) head. Aroma of citrus, sweet malt with some yeast and hops. Medium, crisp, sweet body. Sweet malt and citrus fruit fills the mouth. Finish becomes tart at the end. Drinkable, but Sam Adams can do better."
"If it were fresher, it would probably receive a higher grade from me. It was worth a shot. I wouldn't mind trying it again sometime."
"Conclusion: I imagine that this is tasty if it is super fresh and served on tap. In the bottle and not fresh however, it doesn't taste good. The first offering I have tasted from Sam Adams that didn't impress me in any way."
"The less than a finger head from the pour just didn't hang around long. The lace has an even coat, but not much cling. The brew is slightly cloudy and it's color is a 5 on the SRM beer color chart. Smells of citrus, wheat, and malt. Tastes of lemon peel, lime, black pepper, roasted wheat, and sour malt. Quite thin in the mouthfeel category, just not a lot of body found in moving it around in my tasting orifice. I would be happy to drink another if no better choice was available at the time, but I would not go out of my way to buy another."
"The appearance is nothing special. But the citrus smell is amazing. The taste is as I imagined. Anything sam adams never dissapoints. The lemon flavor really comes out in the end. It has a very drinkable taste and went very well with the turkey from thanksgiving."
"Lighter body, a good refreshing amount of carbonation. Not very exciting, but not bad. Better than others in the style."
"D- A very simple beer but I enjoyed it enough to have another."
"Overall: the label says it all--lemony indeed! Like the Cranberry Lambic, the fruity aspect is fully front and center--this could easily be a sessions beer that rewards with flavor..."
"d - the muted flavors don't leave much for me to desire as a session beer."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with an off white head. In the aroma, small wheat notes and a small hint of citrus. In the taste, wheaty, a sugary lemon citrus and hints of orange. A small bite and light to medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry lemon citrus in the aftertaste. Lack of nose and somewhat sugar citrus, a bit sweet for me."
"Avoid at all costs. Coastal Wheat has all the makings of a solid beer... except for how it tastes. An unfortunate misstep."
"Poured a medium gold color that fades to a more yellow/straw color at the bottom of the glass. There is some visible carbonation, that forms a small white colored head that dissolves away quickly. A yeasty twang in the aromaat first scent, that is followed by a light lemony fragrance. It finishes with a bread and grassy fragrance. A strong bread and wheat flavor at the front of each taste. A citrus tang, that is not bitter or sour, more like a good lemonade. The taste finishes with a mild grassy bitterness, nothing to overbearing. The carbonation is strong at the front along with a thin, but not watery feel. The carbonation does linger at the backend as the beeralso gains weight, making it quenchable. I am not partial to wheat beers, but this is very easy to drink. The bright color stands out, the aroma screams summer, the taste of wheat is what you want in the summer. Then the feel quenches your hot thirsty palate."
"One more style of my friend Samuel. Poured in a whiskey glass. Look: Cloudy yellow-nectar, thin foamy head with good lacing. Smell: Raw wheat and lemon peel. Taste: Much weaht and citrus hops with a cascade of lemon peel. Mouthfeel: Spicy and citrus, bittersweet, viscous and semi-rugged body, high carbonation. Drinkability: Better than orange juice to drink in the morning."
"Pours a very clear yellow color with a slight white head and plenty of visible carbonation. Nose is mostly of lemon Pez and hints of sugar. The taste is more faint, fake lemon and a bit of grain. Mouthfeel is very light and crisp, but seems more like a lightly-flavored soda. Drinkability is okay, as the flavors aren't so much offensive as they are artificial."
"Another girlfriend beer from SA."
"I could not even finish one of these."
"Drinkability: Flavor just isn't there, it wasn't the easiest to finish."
"This pale wheat ale pours a light golden yellow and has the delicate taste of wheat and lemons. A great summer beer as it drinks lightly and tastes great. Another great beer from Sam Adams."
"This beer is ok for a hot summer day. I wouldn't go out and buy any though."
"I had very high hopes for the beer, as I love SA's Summer Ale and I knew this was sort of a precursor to that beer. However, it pales in comparison. The offputting citrus taste in the body is just not what I was hoping for."
" D- The lemons have more of a cleaner flavor than a lemon aid or fresh lemon quality. The beer is very dry with no fruitiness or any yeast characteristics. So the flavor is a bit dull with not much character. This beer might be thirst queching on a hot day?"
"Looks and tastes like a mix between a Wit and a Hefe, this is a great warm weather beer with a perfect little lemon twist. Boston Beer Co. didn't have a ""summer"" beer before this one and this is a great beer on a warm summer (on where I live) a hot fall day."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with an expiration date of Nov 2010. Sampled on September 16, 2010. It pours a cloudy pale yellow-orange color with an OK head and OK lacing. Yup! Lemon grass or lemon peel stands out in the aroma with wheat that feels more like an afterthought. The taste also brings ouit the lemon but not in a sour lemony way. The wheat kicks in a little around the edges and there is also a sickly sweetness going on. I should have tried this in July rather than September. It might have been more appealing on a hot, humid day."
"Mouthfeel is medium-light with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"Pours a hazy golden color, has a fluffy, one-finger white head. Seems to have a pretty high level of carbonation. Aroma is modest, just a slight wheat, citrus smell. Not very bitter, has a noticeable lemon sweetness, wheat aftertaste. Medium-bodied mouthfeel, pretty drinkable. I prefer the Summer Ale but these two are quite similar, both having a citrus taste. Overall a decent beer, but I didn't find it really impressive."
"If you like a good wheat ... Bell's Oberon is still tops in my book!"
"D - Nothing offensive, but nothing overly memorable. A tasty drink, but it could've used a bit more ""ummph"". As much as it serves as a tasty and refreshing patio drink, it requires a bit more flavour to bump it up a notch."
"Taste is crisp, sharp an wheaty. It's light and easy drinking. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Overall decent."
"The head dissipates rather quickly for a Sam Adams but it does have a slightly higher carbonation than most. I'm a little biased because I tend to like the lemon flavor but I do recommend that you give it a try. You probably won't be disappointed."
"The beer is a decent beer but I do not think it is as drinkable as it could be."
"Sam adams coastal wheatpoured a sortta hazy amber color with a small head that stuck around. It smelt like dish soap and skunk. However it taste like a decent wheat beer, with a strong lemon flavor favor. The flavor was light, and very easy to drink. The overpowering lemon flavo might be too much. Overall i enjoyed this beer and get again."
"I just wasn't impressed with this. It struck me as a bit flat in flavor (not carbonation). It could have used a little more crispness, especially since it's supposed to have a citrus/lemon profile. It just didn't work for me overall and is actually one of my least favorite wheats, which is a pity because Sam Adams makes some exceptional beers, especially wheats."
"Mouth feel wise it's got plenty of carbonation to keep this beer refreshing and has a kind of powdery finish from the yeasties."
"D - That hint of soapiness really impacts drinkability. I can't see myself having more than two of these in a session, and I'm glad there are only two of this in the sampler sixer I picked up."
"Had this on tap at Taco Mac Perimeter. The beer was a slightly hazy pale yellow with a bit of head. The smell reminds me of lemon scented dawn dishsoap, way to overpowering of lemons. The taste is over whelming of lemons and I found it to be way too much, I couldn't really taste any of the flavors from the beer. It felt almost if the lemon taste was competing with the other flavors of the beer. Very disappointing."
"I purchased this in a variety pack that had the Black Lager and Irish Red. Out of the three, this one was the most peculiar. It was okay but no need for me to have this one again."
"This is a very drinkable beer, and it is perfect for summer."
"Pours a cloudy golden amber with thick head quickly fading. Carbonation bubbles steadily rising. Lemony scent, reminiscent of tea gone heavy on the lemons, of all things. Lemon peel overpowers both the wheat malt scent and flavor. Medium on the mouthfeel, heavy lemon aftertaste. Not the best of wheat beers. Other Sam Adams has really been fantastic. This one is decent but not amazing. One more in the fridge, not bringing this home again."
"Tastes average, as though they tried to make a combination summer ale/wheat beer, but instead of trying traditional summer techniques they just added some kind of lemon flavoring which overpowers the natural wheat flavor, I don't really care for it. There is also a heaviness to the flavor that would make it difficult to drink more, won't get again."
"D - The sourness of the lemon slightly cuts down on the drinkability."
"Hazy gold with an inch of white foam that settled quickly to a collar. Not much stickage. Light citrus zest aroma, mild maltiness, light honey. Lemony bitterness, a bit toasty, more honey sweetness, slightly spicy/peppery with orange zest in the finish. Light to medium bodied, creamy carbonation, nice texture. Not exactly crisp, but fairly refreshing with light flavours nicely balanced."
"The beer pours a golden color with a white head. The beer is fairly clear. The aroma is strong on the flowery and perfume-scented hops with some wheat mixed in. The flavor is heavy on the wheat with some perfume-flavored hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Easy to drink, but really nothing too exciting going on."
"The beer is very drinkable. It is a good, but not great beer. This is a good choice, when all you have to choose from are BMC, Boston Lager, and a Sam Adams seasonal. Although, I prefer the Boston Lager."
"Unique brew, stands out from the crowd, but not necessarily for quality."
"D- Light, crisp and refreshing. It goes down easy and is a good summer beer. Its not really my thing though. I"
"Another triumph for the Boston Beer Company. Cheers!"
"D - Very very drinkable, I could down a sixer in a snap on a hot day. I heard this wasn't good but I disagree. It's pretty similar to there summer Ale offering but with a bright lemon citrus on the finish that I really liked. I think I'd buy this one again sometime, and you can't beat the price for what you get, that's for sure. Cheers!"
"Overall, there wasn't much to pick from at the restaurant in which I had this beer so I decided to try it. I expected to be disappointed because I don't really like this style of beers, but I was pleasantly surprised. I actually ordered another one and I rarely order the same beer twice in a row. While there isn't much complexity or even flavor to this beer I thought it was pretty good and was surprised to see it get such bad reviews."
"Poured into a SA glass a nice cloudy pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger foamy white head, which disappates quickly, and leaves some minimal sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, with some grassy/yeasty notes, some bannana notes. The taste is malty, yeasty/grassy, too much seltzery. Light/Medium body. Drinkable, but barely. What happened SA? One of the worst I've had from them."
"Lightly toasted doughy wheat bread up front. A bit cereal-y and bland. Mild banana and fruit come through mid-palate, accented by ginger, coriander, and cloves. Medium-full body with a protein-rich feel. Banana aftertaste finish, with some lingering citrus and spice. Meh."
"I would definitely drink it again, if some of my favorites weren't available."
"I poured it into a pint glass, it didn't have much head that disappread quickly to lace It has a hazy golden color to it. A nice smell of lemon. Have a great citrus(lemon) wheat taste, which hits the back of the tongue just nice and easy. This is a very drinkable beer."
"Sam Adam Coastal Wheat pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a thin head that fades like soda. The aroma is lemon and wheat, with hints of spice (maybe from the yeast). The flavor is sweet with a nice wheat character that leads to a artificial lemon flavor (according to the label they use real lemons, it just comes across as artificial). There is some nice flavor going on with the yeast and maybe some corriander, but overall the beer reminds me of a soda. Certainly easy drinking, I like it a little more than the summer, but it is too similar I think."
"Poured into my Sam Adams pint glass and was presented with a 2 finger head that disappeared pretty quickly, pretty hazy looking with a nice golden color. Smells pretty lager-ish, pretty citrusy smelling as well. Tastes just like an extra lemony hefe, the tastes go well together, not to overpowering in any 1 area. Flavors are also very crisp and refreshing, wheat and malt upfront with a refreshing lemon and hop aftertaste. A smooth and easy drinking beer, medium carbonation, light to medium bodied. A nice beer candidate to turn people onto crafts beers as it is not to extreme."
"D: I'm not sure why Sam Adams has this and their Summer Ale out at the same time, since they're the exact same style. But I ended up enjoying this one more. It's a little more simplistic, but it's essentially what a summer wheat ale should be. Clean and crisp taste, with good body. Still nothing special, but it's enjoyable."
"D: Pretty solid drinkability. Easy to down, low-ish abv."
"Another gift from my wife's friend. This one pours a cloudy straw golden color, with just a little cloudy white head. Huge lemony aromas, along with wheat and just a bit of funkiness. Similar on the palate, very refreshing and enjoyable on a summer day."
"D - This is a easy drinking beer. Goes nicely on a pleasant summer evening. I could put down a few of these in an evening. But doesn't have the best after taste."
"Drinkability - Its a ""summer"" brew. I dont think i will buy again but it is better then most i have had of this style."
"D - This strikes me as a run of the mill wheat beer. Just simple tasting with not a whole lot of complexity, yet nothing that's offensive, either. I wouldn't mind drinking a couple more of these on another hot day."
"Drinkability? I'm, truthfully, not digging the flavours all that much and the mouthfeel is too substantial. For me....occasional use only. The other 2 bottles/beers in the 6 pack I like more."
"D - Pretty good beer that would be good for putting back in the summer months. Wouldn't go out of my way to get though."
"D: It goes without saying that this is the perfect beer for porch sittin' in the summer"
"D: average drinkability. could use more citrus in it: Drink it with a real leomn slice!"
"Lemons and malt up front. Moderate wheat presence, as expected. Thin, watery mouthfeel. Light body with a smooth finish. Similar to, maybe slightly superior to, Blue Moon."
"I was geared up to really not like this beer, but bought it because my wife loves wheat beers and thought she might enjoy something other than Blue Moon. The pour was nice with a great burnt goldish color and a nice frothy head. Lemon zest and bready malts jumped out and created an inviting scent. Flavor was perfect for a hot San Diego day with a crisp citrus bite, slight honey like sweetness and just a hint of hops in the background. All in all a very enjoyable warm weather beer, recommended."
"Samuel Adams Coastal Wheat pours yellow with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a lot of lemon in the nose. The flavor also has quite the dominant lemon flavor. There is a bit of a wheat aftertaste. Decent, but doesn't stand out."
"single from an SLC liquor store - yeah, it's come to this"
"The body is crisp and bordering on harsh. Carbonation level is higher than I'd like. Flavors of mild grains, some citrus punch, and the finish is very buttery and smooth. This is a run-of-the-mill Pale Wheat. Nothing spectacular, but it would do at a cookout for sure."
"I am normally a fan of Sam Adams beers--they do a very nice job on a wide variety of brews. This one was simply yucky. However, in the previous BA reviews of this beer, I don't see others who encountered the diacetyl bomb, so I'll give Sam a fair second chance."
"D- Easy drinking, could definitely put back a few of these due to mild flavor and thinness."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy gold color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. The brew smells like wheat and some weird lemon citrusy aroma that's hard to describe. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some spicy hops noticable. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, and is well carbonated. Drinkability is OK, once I get used to the weird lemon taste it's not hard to drink at all. Not one of the better Sam Adams brews I've had. Luckily I just bought a single of this and not a 6 pack."
"Overall - Can't say I'm too impressed and I will not be buying this again. It's refreshing but it's not as clean as a pilsner and not as interesting as a wheat beer, I would go one way or the other happily but won't be going back to this."
"Found at the Sam Adams bar at Myrtle Beach Airport in South Carolina. This has a light but cloudy straw yellow color with a decent white froth on top and pretty good lacing to boot. The aroma brings light lemon fruit nougat sponge cake. The flavor has some citrus hop, lemon brightness and crisp grassy biscuit. I get some dishater soapiness here that makes this a bit less than a simple Seven-Up summer brew. But it is a refreshing option, well carbonated and plenty drinkable if the dishwater doesn't get to you. Not something I'll need to revisit."
"Poured a clear gold with good but quickly receding head. An average smell of sour lemon and faint spices along w/ a touch of sweetness. Fluffy, wheaty mouthfeel but nothing really there other than some basic lemony citric zip and some sweetness. Not bad but nothing really to write home about. One is fine as I finished this alright but didn't desire another one."
"Hazed lemony copper with a finger of soft white foam. Wheat malt and faint herbal hops in the nose. Soft lemon and wheat malt with a dry spicy finish. Earthy hops balance fairly well. edium bodied with prickly carbonation. A touch too lemon zesty for my tastes. An average beer."
" This fits the bill for a session beer but one of these is going to make you want something to was your mouth out with. Going along the line of more wheat or hops like the Southern Tier Hop Sun could have made this stand out. Instead, it's a curiosity before sampling and an oddity afterwards. Certainly unique, but not memorable..."
"Picked this up as part of a mixed sixer. Pours a bright, somewhat hazy, straw color with a tiny white head that disappears quickly leave virtually no lacing. Smells lemony and this is definitely indicative of things to come. Lemon flavors are overpowering. The wheat malt is too subtle, which sounds weird coming out of my mouth since I'm not a huge fan of the style. Something of a sub par offering in my opinion, could definitely knock back several of these if one were so inclined though."
"Update-tried the other bottle, came in with a head full of steam psyching myself up to finish the whole bottle. Just as awful as the last one. Another for the sink. Tastes and smells like hand soap. Very quickly losing the desire to buy anything SA as 1/3 of the nine dollar six pack got poured."
"D: For my taste, average drinkability. Perhaps more citrusy hops or a little more lemon..."
"A light body but intensely crisp and fizzy mouthfeel. This beer is certainly drinkable and pleasant, but decidedly mediocre across the board."
"D - Refreshing but not as strong offering as their Summer Ale."
"D: As with most of their beers drinkability seems to be the main focus and things are no different here. A citrusy-lemon wheat beer that was wet and juicy with a clean sense will no doubt quench the thirst on a hot summer day. Good to throw back with casual conversation while a six pack purchase will certainly not go to waste."
"D - A very refreshing summertime beer, but not something that stands out from a crowd. Have a quick one of these after mowing the lawn, but don't plan on kicking back"
"D: Pretty drinkable overall, but unfortunately just an average wheat ale, but I guess Sam Adam's isn't really known for wheat beers. I wouldn't avoid this one, but I wouldn't seek it out either."
"Fuzzy, pale yellow in color. Not a lot of carbonation going on. Somewhat metallic, sharp aroma. Citrusy flavors upfront-not quite a lemon lime flavor. Balances ok enough against the crisp wheat flavor. Maybe a tad overdone in the lemony department. Ok body for the light flavor. Overall an ok beer. Maybe more popular with the non craft crowd in general."
"Overall: While not the first disappointing beer that I've had from Sam Adams, it's certainly the only one I can say that I didn't like. It just comes across as a weak attempt. But who knows...they could still fix this by concentrating on the redeeming qualities...after all...the lemon isn't bad."
"pours a golden yellow color with a little bit of head and not much for lacing. smell and taste are a liitle bit citrus like but very vague. nothing else really stood out. the beer was very light easy to drink, but not really much to it. i prefer beers that have a lot more going on. the beer wasn't great but also wasn't that bad, probably would work good for a hot summer day bbq or something of that nature."
"Taste was thin, nothing about this beer turned me off, no bad tastes, initially it had a nice taste, but disappeared quickly and left with aftertaste of old flat beer. Good lawnmower beer, good very cold."
"That being said, if you haven't picked up already, this is a pretty damn good, light, wheat beer."
"I thought this was an average brew. Not my favorite from Sam Adams."
"Maybe it's just because I've been working outside all day on this abnormally warm April day in Georgia (90s), but this beer is definitely hitting the spot! Light and flavorful, but not overdone... a super-refreshing beer!"
"D - It's light and easy to down one, but I wouldn't want to make this a session beer."
"It's got a very interesting, tart, tingly taste to it. Very dry aftertaste. It's sweet and lemony, but I'm not loving this. Might be great on a very hot day, but quite average."
"Beer is a hazy golden color with a light head. The smell is that of grain mixed with lemon-citrus. The taste is fairly light with decent flavor. The finish is fairly smooth & crisp but with a lemony finish that just seems to linger indefinitely. This is not a beer I would recommend. The lemon after taste reminded me of macro beers trying to cash in on the lemon beer craze. This is the first Sam Adams beer that did not quite meet the standard I expected."
"This brew is refreshing, would be a decent brew to have on a hot day. The problem here is there are many, many brews that satisfy this need. Very ho-hum."
"Drinkability - Crisp, refreshing, solid wheat beer. Though it can be improved it does nothing wrong. It is really drinkable, especially if you like wheat, you will have no problem having these non stop. If you don't especially care for this kind of beer you may find this slightly boring, but I don't think anyone would find this offensive."
"Samuel Adams Coastal Wheat is a hazy, light golden ale with a white head that quickly fades to a thin film that leaves nice, thick lacing on the glass. It has a faint aroma of light, fresh grain and a slight hint of funk and fruitiness. It's light bodied and quite smooth. The finish is clean. It's very lightly flavored with wheat and a hint of lemon. I don't think I would have detected the actual lemon if I wouldnt've read it on the bottle. There's a slight sweaty funkiness to it that's a little distracting. It's not bad but it's not really a beer that I would drink on purpose unless I was really thirsty."
"I was expecting more lemons from the description on the bottle, but just a hint, more like a refreshing summer beer, kinda odd it came out this time of year, instead of spring time. Nice wheat character, Amber orange hue, head didn't last long....but neither did the beer, another fine beer from a fine brewery."
"D - It's pretty unoffensive, but just don't like it enough to down a lot off."
"D - Fairly clean, easy drinking brew. Not terribly exciting though."
"D- Good BBQ beer, with it's inoffensive flavor and light, subdued profile."
"I really enjoyed this one. Sam Adams rarely dissapoints."
"Drinkability: So they decided to ditch the Spring Ale for Noble Pils, and then they re-packaged the Spring Ale and doctored it up a bit for Coastal Wheat? Not a huge fan. They need to do something else with this and make a new beer in my opinion."
"Taste is much like the nose, but exceedingly light and easy going down. Light citrus, particularly lemon, and pretty basic. Mouthfeel is a little bit thin with slight carbonation - not a real positive for this style. Overall this is a good one for a summer day, but just not great."
"Poured the Coastal Wheat from a bottle to a glass. Pours a hazy straw color with a foamy white head that fades very fast to a white ring. There is not much of a nose. A little wheat and kind of grainy. A citrusy taste at first and a pretty watery finish. This beer has a pretty light body and a creamy mouthfeel and lightly carbonated. Pretty crisp, okay summer beer."
"Overall: The mouth feel is carbonated, creamy, and crisp. The body of the beer is very light, and the finish is medium light. This is a descent lawnmower beer for a hot summer day."
"This is a better then average wheat beer, that said I don't really like most wheat beers. It is golden in color with a typical cloudy appearance but is able to maintain a good head and lacing. The aroma is typical citrus. The carbonation starts slightly harsh but sweet taste quickly takes over and finishes dry with no bitterness."
"D - If I was drunk, this would be easy to session."
"For all the touting of the lemon peel used in this beer, I found very little of it shining through. There was a vague lemony note, but it actually reminded me more of the grains of paradise spice used in one of BBC's earlier offerings. Otherwise, a rather bland American wheat - I'm not sure why American brewers seem to make such flavorless non-hefe beers."
"Drinkability is quite high, and these coiuld be downed quickly and in high numbers without a problem"
"A hazy golden color pour with a medium sized short lasting soapy white head , lively carbonation . Aroma is lightly sweet with wheat as promised, bread dough and a hint of lemon grass. Flavor is quite yeasty , bread , wheat , lemons and some fait spice notes. short spent grain finish , medium body with a creamy mouthfeel ,quite drinkable and would deem sessionable , would have liked this better on a hot day , nothing wrong with this beer but not really something I'm in the market for ."
"Just ok - not remarkable. Good enough."
"D- Overall, Coastal Wheat would be a pretty good beer to drink in the summer. It is light bodied and refreshing, perfect for those warm summer days in Florida."
"Lightly cloudy pale yellow with a smallish but persevering dense white head. Looks pretty tasty! The aroma is a lemony spicy aroma with no noticeable wheat to it that comes across as almost solvent-like in that respect. The nose is kind of harsh and unappealing for a beer of this style. The flavor is tart and citric but it doesn't come across as a very natural flavor. Somewhat spicy and almost medicinal with no actual wheat noticeable. Eh. The mouthfeel is light and excessly fizzy; while it should be well carbonated it feels artificial and seltzery instead of natural. A drinkable beer, but no aspects I find too appealing. I don't see much reason to drink this one."
"I'm not entirely sure what to think of this one. The bottle says it's a twist on a Hefeweizen, but this site classifies it as an American Pale Wheat Ale. If I'm to compare this beer to what the bottle says, then I enjoy it because of the quality of the lemon notes and the lack of what I can only describe as the ""pungent"" sensation which I find in many Hefes (and dislike). Regardless, it's a good beer, but not a great one."
"D: Not sure why this is the new spring beer. to me its more of a summer beer. its very similar to summer ale (I think it may be better, but its been 9 months since Ive had summer ale. Ill have to try a side by side). In my mind though, sam adams needs a bock, not another beer similar to two they already have. That said its very drinkable and refreshing, i like it, i just dont quite understand it."
"Wheat beers are not my favorite style, I rarely drink them so my frame of reference is limited. The only thing similar I've had recently was Shock Top and this is far superior, although a different style."
"Light golden color, lemon hints, nice pour, sweet lemon scent, typically average. Definitely drinkable, but I'd probably buy something else as opposed to a six or 12 pack of this. If I was being served this at a party or wherever I'd be happy to drink it, but I'd probably choose something else."
"D: yuck. not a pleasant wheat beer at all.. in fact, I think that is a nice way of stating it."
"In summation, I can't be all too critical of this beer. Yes, I do know that it doesn't fit all too well with what a typical wheat beer would taste like. Yes, I do understand that, for all intents and purposes, it is a macro brew. Yes, I do realize that this is not the end all, be all definitive wheat brew. However, for what it is, it is really good."
"= just when i think Sam Adams is doing it right, i get another bad wheat rendition. perhaps upping the wheat beers in response to Golden Wheat/Blue Moon competition?"
"D - There isn't too much to write home on this one...the flavors are not very big but that could lead to have a few extra because it goes down like a macro"
"Mouthfeel is thin but the drinkability is good."
"This wheat ale is meant to be drunk in the summer - so why did Sam Adams offer this in their Winter Sampler??"
"Nice flavor, but I agree that this should be a summer beer instead of featured in the winter sampler."
"Decent easy drinking wheat by Sam Adams."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it's hard to drink this one and not compare it to other Sam Adams wheat beers and although this is a decent beer, I don't think it's as good as some of their other similar products."
"Poured from the bottle this had a cloudy, light golden color, with minimal head and lacings. The smell and taste were both pretty boring and worse than I expected. The beer had a nice dry feel to it, but was overall lacking in taste. I would not buy this beer on its own, but getting it from the brewmasters collection, I certainly wouldn't let it go to waste."
"Score: 3.78"
"	This beer is medium in feel and is really wet. It can hit the spot though if your craving a wheat so don't count it out completely. It does the job for me, but it's not amazing."
"Value: I wouldn't pay more than 6 bucks for a sixer of this."
"Pale gold straw color, frothy white head, quickly gone. Smell of lemon zest and a decent fresh cracked wheat smell. Taste is - wow - sugary sweet articial flavored candy (lemon drops), decent pale wheat background, but the lemon is too much. Light bodied, slightly overly carbonated. I dont understand the Boston beer Comapny at times, so many of their non traditional beer ingredients come across as sweet and artifical, and this is perhaps the worst of the bunch. The grains and hops can be very good, but the attempt at flavoring is just wrong."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale yellow color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing which is very disappointing for a wheat beer. The aroma is of lemon, and crispy wheat. It is a pleasant aroma, but rather weak even for a wheat beer. The taste is like the aroma, but a little more pronounced. There is a lot of lemon...almost dominant lemon, and I'm really not liking it. It gets really old, really fast. The mouthfeel is annoyingly high carbonated, and lighter bodied. Overall, I will not be drinking this again, and would recommend that others safe their time and money on other beers too."
"Bought a sample pack with the Coastal Wheat. Somewhat dull and murky straw-yellow appearance with thin lacing. Lemon-citrus mixed with a wheat scent. Taste is a little bland. A bittersweet mix of sour lemon flavor was apparent. However, it tasted a little watered down. The body was a little light and watery. Overall, it was ok."
"Pours a golden pale straw color with two fingers of white head. Smells like wheat and leather. Taste is a bit watery with some wheat and hints of yeast and a little bit of mustiness and leather in the finish. The biggest detractor for me in this brew was the over-carbonation. There's just not too much to rave about here, it's decent, but nothing more."
"D: Not much complexity with this brew. Not a wheat beer I would reach for on a consistent basis in the summer."
"Unlike other beers I've rated a ""C", I actually enjoyed this one."
"D-while this beer is very refreshing it barely beer like and a really weak offering from sam adams there is no wheat characteristic and a huge lemon taste that blocks everything else overall not terrible but certanly unrememberable"
"So I decided to drink this bad boy out of a tulip glass just for fun. Pours hazy golden with somewhat thick head with good retention but minimal lacing. Smell was not very appealing, there was some spice (lemon, orange peel, coriander) but just a somewhat ""off"" smell. It kinda smelled like one of my home brews that just didnt quite turn out right. Taste was ok but not memorable. A definite citrus presence with it being a little more on the lemon side but a touch of orange too. A little grassyness to it and a bit of dry biscuit, very small bit of it. Mouthfeel was fine, a little too creamy to be too good. Overall a good beer, but it kinda just tasted like a mass produced wheat beer, which I guess it what it is."
"D - you could drink quite a few of these simply due to the lightness of it. Overall it's a decent beer, but not one that i'd want to have on a consistent basis."
"Goes down easy, but the oppressive citrus flavors and sweetness definitely detract from the experience."
"Overall: This is one of the weaker offerings from the guys at Samuel Adams. If you're looking for a good wheat beer, this is not one I'd recommend."
"The flavor is a bit heavier on the lemon, but it's balanced within the profile. I will say this wheat beer has lost some of its overall natural sweetness from the malt. In the end it's not bad, the mouth feel is fine but not as similar to over wheat beers. Decent."
"Serving type: bottle"
"[Drinkability]: Drinkability is pretty good, I would drink this beer again."
"Poured a golden yellow into a glass, decent head. Smell was faint with some citrus and earthy notes. I was surprised with the high amount of carbonation. Taste was faint and light, completely dominated by the carbonation. Slightly citrusy in the finish. Not offensive but nothing special. Not worth trying again."
"the drinkability is pretty good. despite being fairly understated it's got plenty going on to keep you interested and honestly i would have rated it higher if there were just a little more to hold onto. all in all a pretty unique and well conceived beer."
"So we've got a new brew here by SA. I love having control of what beer comes into my store! Wheat ale with lemons a? Been done before, can we say Widmer?? Anywho, on to the beer. Poured a hazey wheaty color. Aroma of faint lemon, some citrusy hops, and yeast. Taste much like a Blue Moon but instead of the orange after taste it is a bit lemony. I was somewhat dissapointed because I was expecting more of a Shandy taste but it does say wheat beer with lemon and that is what it taste like, but Americanized."
"For me, lemon flavored beers should be warm weather beers. Right now, even in Atlanta it is in the 20 degree area while the Northeast is getting its second hit of over a foot of snow this week. Why bring this beer out in the cool to cold weather months?"
"Overall, a fair to good outing. Easy drinking with no real turn-offs but not much in aroma or flavor to make you want more than one. With that said, it's still better than most BMC's so a good alternative if this is best choice at a bar. Also might be a good 1st step beer for your BMC buddies to try. Rotation - avail here in TX. One and done for me as there are better beers out there unless it's best choice on-tap."
"D - Pretty nice. I would buy a six pack but got this in the brew-masters collection, so if all's good I might just pick the variety up again!"
"An approachable beer that would be fine on a hot day, but other beers are just as satisfying and don't sacrifice so much complexity."
"Certainly not a bad beer, would probably be a good gateway beer to get people into heartier, or more flavorful, wheat beers. Would be good in the summer after working outdoors."
"Taste-Wheat and a whole lotta' lemon that seems to unbalance the taste. Kind of tastes like a version of their Summer Ale with less spice, more wheat and a lot of lemon. That being said, this would make a fine warm weather session brew, which pushed its grade up a bit in my book."
"Cloudy dark what beer. Smaller head to style, bready malt notes in the nose, fresh bread dough, lemon peel, orange peel and pale malt. The taste is more of the same, compared to other fine wheat beers it's lacking but as a beer it's not too bad. There is a spicy character in the nose and finish, slightly above average mouthfeel and mildly pleasant experience."
"D: Not bad. I good interpretation of a amer. hefe."
"I thought this one would be okay, but nothing special. But to my surprise I really liked this beer. I really can't pick out exactly what it is about this beer I really like but there is something."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with a nice biting carbonation."
"D - The lemony wheat is a tasty combo, but the drinkability is middle of the road for me, not a bad beer but a bit samey compared to other wheats they make - a decent job by Sam Adams"
"D: easy drinking here; could be improved if it were less sour. This is a perfect beer to introduce to women who claim to dislike beer. I love witbiers, but this one's not really for me."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, lip smacking, and dry."
"Easy to drink, light to medium/light in body. Not overly carbonated. Not my favorite wheat beer, but not a bad attempt. The only real issue I have is that it may be a little too lemony..."
"I wish there was a better malt taste with this beer. The lemons are not too overpowering or too sweet - thank goodness! Just need more wheat malt taste (and perhaps more hops?) to make this experiment a little more valid and worth the price to craft brew fans. As of right now it's a wonderful session beer that tastes delightfully light."
"Has a hazy darker straw hint with some minimal lacing to go along. A lot of citrus in the smell but also with a ginger-like spice to go along. Tasting a lot more spice - clove, light pepper. A nice lemon overtone going on as well. I wasn't sure what to expect with this beer. I was kind of weary about the use of lemon - but it's the right amount for this beer."
"Light bodied, dangerously easy to drink, ""Coastal Wheat"" would be exceptional on a blistering summer day."
"There is a certain element of drinkability to this beer as it is light and refreshing I suppose but is not anything that I would run off and grab when looking for a good session beer. Perhaps it might be able to serve as a sort of higher quality lawnmower beer but short of that is probably not one to go reaching for when it is a quality offering you are in the mood for."
"D: mildy drinkable. could drink more than a few of these, but OTOH wont go out of my way to find it again."
"Note: The name doesn't seem to fit. Sure, it's a wheat beer, but there really should be more emphasis on the lemon. Maybe calling it wheat lemonade would hamper sales, though."
"Samuel Adams Coastal Wheat is one of those beers that some will love and some will hate. It isn't outstanding, but I'm closer to the first group. It's almost the lower-ABV wheat beer version of a spiced winter warmer. It's also unique, which counts for something."
"I poured this beer from a bottle into a pint glass. This beer has a yellow straw color with light cloudiness. This beer had a two finger white head that went away very quikly and left minimal lacing. The beer smells of yeast, and lemon/citus. The beer tastes of lemon, sour citrus and I thought it was like unsweet sprite soda. The mouthful was like a fizzy soda. This was a average wheat ale at best. I was hoping for alot more. This beer falls way short in my opinion."
"Notes: A decent attempt here, but ultimately not a good result. The one thing that stands out to me about this beer is...lemon!"
"Pours a pretty hazy gold with a smallish head. Very mild smell- hints of wheat and lemon. Definite lemon flavor throughout. Not sour though. Wheat flavors with a little background sweetness. The lemon flavor is dominant but not overpowering. I'm normally not one for lemons in my wheat beers but this is pleasant enough. Medium bodied. Easily drinkable."
"Plenty of lemon malt in both the aroma, and the quaff. Starts off with the sweet wheat malt, then finishes with a bit of a stinging cut of lemon grass. Not an American style, no hop presence at all. More of an easy going wit brew, but still tasty - this would work much better in the summer heat versus the winter cold."
"Conclusion: Not terrible, but not really something I'd go back to, either. If I want a Wit, I'll go Hoegaarden, Boulevard's Zon, or Jolly Pumpkin Calabaza Blanca. If I want an American Pale Wheat, it's going to be O'Dells, Boulevard, or Goose Island methinks."
"Drinkability, The lemon slightly turns me off to it, but in summer this would be acceptable. Doesnt affect my scoring. Its decent, dont go seeking this out but try it if you have a chance, its different."
"Hazy, pale gold color with a decent amount of white head and a moderate amount of lace. The aroma is fairly light but has a lot of lemon citrus. The taste I found surprisingly good. The lemon is definitely the main feature and it has a fairly persistent finish. Good blend of citrus and wheat-derived tartness. In terms of complexity, it isn't. But it's good at what it intends to do I think. Highly carbonated. Very light and refreshing. Overall I was very pleased with this one. The perfect lawnmower beer or something that might pair well with some fish or shrimp off the grill. Definitely something good for a hot summer day as it's light, refreshing and super bubbly."
"D -- While easily drinkable, I doubt I'd reach for another -- just another run-of-the-mill American Wheat. I might have to try this at room temp to see if I have a different impression -- maybe more character appears."
"Drinkability: It's not much of a winter drink, but it would definitely be good on a hot summer day."
"Pours a very cloudy gold with a small white head that dissipates almost immediately. The nose is lemons and sweet wheatiness. Its taste is well balanced if somewhat simple, and doesn't overplay the lemony element. Coastal Wheat is a very refreshing, unchallenging brew."
"Hits the palate first with mild lemon accents and some spice. Finishes with a hint of wheat-yeasty flavor."
"Overall-not nearly as flavorful as most wheat beers, ok for the style, similar to Appalachian Watergap Wheat which is popular back home in PA. Could be decent in the summer, if you know the style you know what you are getting, still not the best though."
"Overall this is disapointing from begining to end."
"This one pours a very cloudy orange with a fluffy 3/4"" white head. Their are tiny bubbles all up the sides of the glass, this one is very effervescent. The smell is wheat and grass with a hint of lemon and some light fruit notes. There is a little spice as well. The taste is very flavorful and a lot better than other Pale Wheat Ales I have had. There is mostly wheat with the tartness of the lemon and another hint of spice and a little sweet finish. The mouthfeel was a little thin but held up when compared with others of the style. The drinkability was high on this one but would be a lot better in the summer."
"D - This is a strange beer. It is dominated by an odd, phenolic note that I can't help but identify with cardboard and cigaret smoke. Overall, I wouldn't want more than one of these. Not one of Sam's more successful offerings."
"D: Light and easy. I hate to say it, but this almost warrants a slice of lemon or orange to kick up the hints of those flavors in the beer. Maybe not dropping the fruit in, but just a twist of rind after the head settles. Maybe have some fruit on hand for munching on the side. Not Sam's best offering, but eminently drinkable, and that's what was here asked."
"Poured into a hefe glass. Cloudy yellow color with a decent sized white head. Smell was not that attractive; reminded me a some type of lemon scented floor cleaner. Taste was run of the mill. Average wheat and citrus flavor, nothing special. Mouthfeel was a bit sticky on the pallate. I could drink one or two of these on a hot day, but it's really not a winter beer. On second thought, I can think of plenty of other wheat beers I'd ordered before I had another one of these again."
"D. If you don't like lemon in your wheat beer then stay away. If fruit is for you then this brew is for you. To me I would rather just have the wheat ale without the lemon, as I think it covers too much of the wheat ale flavor."
"Drinkability- Not a great what, but not bad. worth a try."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability- ok, good summer beer, good cold on a hot day, perfect for working in the summer outside, one of those types of thirst quenchers"
" It is a nice difference. Better for summer though. Had it recently and didn't capture the heart of winter. Not that I expected it to."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow color body, average white creamy head, tiny bubbles, quickly diminishing. Strong aroma of wheat, some lemon citrus, effervescent. Sweet smelling. Light taste, almost metallic taste, very clean aftertaste. Wheat and some strong lemon flavor. Too much lemon, acidic. Very soft mouthfeel."
"D: Very easy to drink, just not very flavorful or special."
"Poured forth into the glass in a yellowish hue. Slight head to the beer faded quickly. Smells like lemons and a bit like a hefe beer (wheaty). It tastes much to lemony for me. Like a summer beer with a kick of lemon juice. Has a watery feel to it with only a bit of carbonation in the beer. I could drink this on a hot day, but normally I wouldn't want this beer."
"Sweet and medium to low bodied. Too sweet and there is an unpleasant wheat / banana aftertaste. There isn't a lot of bitterness and the wheat character doesn't show up until the end. Drinkability is OK and mouthfeel is average. Its a little thin and the flavors seem kind of random."
"Tastes unoffensive, like a lemon seltzer. Big lemon flavor up front, reminding me a little bit of a Wrigley Juicy Fruit. Wheat is prominent mid-palate, husky and grainy. I wish there was more character to this brew, the lack of spice, the lack of subtle complexity makes for an uninteresting beer, with the lemon character being the only saving grace. Hoop character is minimal. Drying on the finish with a little lemon and grain character, there's a disappointing lack of flavor. Light in body and crisply carbonated, this goes down easy, but why would I want more?"
"OK overall. A nuetral addition to the winter mixer I got just for Fuzziwig and holiday porter."
"D - I did not like this and actually did not finish the bottle. Rarely happens to me. It's not an aweful beer but I just feel like the flavors do not meld well and it has some funky flavors present. Kind of like an adjuct in flavor IMO."
"D- A little different than most hefes I've had; but still a refreshing beer."
"Pours to a light haze with a creamy mostly white, dense head. The haze aside, the color is light and bright. Laces quite nicely. The nose has hints of wheat characteristics with very restrained spice and citrus notes. The lemons are more evident on the palate which does linger despite the light body. It is hard to find the malt. The ale does not impress, but may be suited for the larger market looking for an up-market brand name light ale. Summer quencher? Would do well with fried foods. I will hesitate before I buy it again."
"Not traditional wheat by any means. The lemon is a bit too astringent and over the top, but good none the less."
"Had a pale yellow color to it with a thick white head that dwindled to a collar. Aroma has some floral overtones, and maybe some sweet citrus to it. Taste was pretty plain, just some wheat and flowery elements to it, hops noticeable afterward. Not too thin, carbonation was ok. Decent beer, but nothing special, probably wouldn't put it in the ""Brewmaster's Collection"" myself."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a hazy pale yellow color. The aroma is light but has some lemon and some floral notes. The tastes is mild and has more lemon flavor than the banana that comes in a wheat brew. The carbonation is moderate and the finish is a little bitter. Just an OK beer, nothing to write home about."
"Would go best w/ the same food you'd have an iced tea with--tuna or egg salad sandwich, mild cheese (monterrey jack, muenster or brie) or cold chicken breast sandwich w/ lettuce & mayo, or smoked salmon appetizers. Too subtle to stand up to rich or strong-flavored foods. Delightful in its own way."
"overall not that great of a wheat beer, looks good but the taste is lacking as well as the smell."
"another good beer from sam adams ."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mostly of lemons, some wheat. Taste is also very lemony, tart, slightly sour. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a pretty good beer."
"Brew came in the winter pack this year. I am not sure why they added this beer to the mix; I would have rather had the Black Lager they had last season. To be truthful IMO this would have been a fair brew to add in the summer pack as I think it would be quite refreshing on a hot day. With this being said I thought the beer was pretty good. Poured to a golden color with a slight cloudiness and a good sized white head that had good retention and lacing. The aroma was pale and wheat malts with a mellow but pronounced lemon scent, again seems to be a perfect warm weather beer. The flavor is delicate but does have a slight spiciness/tang, quite good and refreshing. The pale malts lead to an easy drinking brew and the accompanying lemon and hop flavors are nice. Overall this is a pretty good brew, just not sure how long we will see it for as I would imagine that may have incorporated it during this time of year as not to compete against the Summer Ale? I would get this brew again, especially during the warmer months."
"Light bodied, smooth and very drinkable, This would make a good summer brew but decent anytime."
"M/D: light bodied feel with good amount of carbonation. The drinkability is good by feel but doesn't inspire in smell or taste."
"Notes: This is a decent summer seasonal, plain and simple. The lemon flavor works fine, and I would recommend it over other lemon flavored beers I've tried."
"Pleasant."
"Eric"
"Drinkability - a good session beer for warmer climes, IMO."
"Pours a cloudy, golden color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and poor lacing. Smells of honey, yeast, sweet malt, slight spice (coriander), and slight citrus (orange). Fits the style of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, wheat, honey, slight spice, slight citrus, and sweet malt. Overall, complex, but not well blended. Body and blend does improve as it warms."
"I had one of these in the late summer, and did not like it. Then they put it in the Winter pack, instead of one of my favorites, Cream Stout. There is nothing positive about this beer. I'm sorry, Samuel Adams, but this is the second time I have been disappointed by you (first being the Hefeweizen)."
"Overall/notes: This somehow got into the Samuel Adams Winter Pack. Bizarre, because this is a lot like (VERY much so) their Summer Ale. Good thing I'm in southern California, or that would have probably gotten it a worse rating. As it is, though, I'm pretty much done with wheat beers for a while. It's pretty run of the mill, really."
"a new year. a new beer. gamboge with white foam, looks reasonable. it says lemon peel on the bottle, and indeed, it is true, it was brewed with lemon peel. smells more like lemon dish soap than a wheat beer. by the way, lemon dish soap smells pretty good, if you didn't know. a bit of wheat smell. tastes like a clean wheat beer with a bit of lemon. nothing overpowering or spectacular. overall pretty drinkable but thinner than tiger's 9 iron. less bloody too."
"Drinkability is moderate. The flavor profile is ok, but a bit uninspiring. The Abv is easily managed which certainly makes for an easily sessionable beer although the lacking flavor doesn't really make me want to have another."
"Well...there's not much to this one, though it's not flat or overly boring in my opinion, and I'm sure it's refreshing in the summer."
"Hazy yellow-orange with little suspended bits of sediment. Tight, fluffy white head. Soft, tangy lemon tartness in the nose...light wheat grain and bready sweetness. Crisp wheat flavor and a slick citrus presence. Very simple...would fit right into the summer variety pack (nothing really screams ""winter"" here). Light and very smooth and crisp. Not bad...quite poundable."
"D - OK on the drinkability... I will probably avoid this in the future, though not so bad that I won't finish the last one in fridge. Was this slipped into the winter mixed pack... to dispose of, perhaps? That is the feeling I come away with since this beer has no ""wintery"" qualities and is a mediocre (at best) spring/summer brew."
"just a nice beer."
"Taste leans heavily on the wheat, with a hay-like grassy flavor that makes me feel like I am eating the whole shock of wheat. Lemons are more than subtle and dont really provide any good flavors for me, pithy and bitter. Not much in the way of hops. Creamy mouthfeel, but it has a little bit of an unpleasant chalkiness to it. Coastal Wheat is not a total disaster, but it is pretty close. I certainly will not be purchasing any of this in a stand alone six-pack."
"Pours a somewhat hazy yellow-orange, decent sudsy white head that sticks around well. Smell is pretty eh, kinda that generic macro smell (aka urine) with a touch of wheat and light fruit. Taste is very boring, incredibly thin mouthfeel, tastes almost like seltzer water while in my mouth, the aftertaste is a little better with big wheat/bread taste with a small touch of lemon. The lemon taste gains some ground towards the end, but it's not saving this one. On the label it calls this a ""fresh twist on the popular Hefeweizen style", what a joke. And what is this doing in the winter sampler pack? Drinkability is okay I guess since it's so light and watery, but I definitely am not a fan of this one."
"Would make a good session beer with food, but not so exciting on its own. I get the feeling that this beer isn't quite sure if it is an American wheat, or a wit. Nice enough, but probably won't grab a 6-pack."
"drinkability is decent. nothing here makes this worth another round, but for the style it gets the job done. a worthy example."
"In fairness, it starts off well, with a foamy white head, and crisp lemon zest in the nose. The taste is broad and flavorful but flat and somewhat one dimensional in texture. Its not bad for the style and would probably taste really good in June after mowing the lawn but seems ridculously out of place after all that smow last week."
"D: easy, the lemon would make this a good starter brew"
"Not what I was expecting but ok overall. That's 2 out of the pack that threw me (Cranberry ""Lambic"" also) that I would have expected more from."
"Coastal Wheat, inexplicable, came in the Winter Sampler. It would be pointless on the hottest day of summer, but beyond pointless on a cold evening."
"12oz. bottle served in a weizen glass. Best by May 2010 notched on the label. Poured a hazy, muted orange-gold with a three inch, creamy bright white head that eventually settles into a quarter inch cap - some spots and strands of lacing, but somewhat weak retention. Not much happening in the nose - a hint of citrus, perhaps lemonzest, and a grainy quality. Taste consistent with nose; however a bit more citrus comes out, and a subtle wheat character reveals itself - finish is fairly clean with perhaps some residual lemony flavor and a little bit of sweetness (a la artificial sweetener). Mouthfeel is fairly light with a very mild carbonation. Not a terrible beer - taste is light and goes down easy, but not terribly flavorful and missing some of the character of the style."
"Wasn't very good to me, but to be objective...Pours to a yellow color with a decent but quickly disappearing head. Rather hoppy with a slight citrus flavor, but not overpowering hoppy, but enough to hit the sinuses. American wheat style, but not a lot of flavor."
"12oz. bottle from the holiday pack. Served in a shaker pint. Poured a slightly hazy pale gold with a finger of fine bubbled white head. Wheaty aroma, but aroma was fairly faint. Light bodied. Decent malt base. The label touts lemon, but the citrus was slight to non existent. A decent version of an American Wheat, not what you would expect in a pack of winter brews. Would be pretty drinkable in the summer."
"I found this a strange addition to the holiday pack, let's hope they correct this grave error next year (put in the Black Lager instead!)."
"Coastal Wheat is a masterfully crafted and well designed beer. A stellar representation of what I think of as a 'beer': tight balance, full flavored, and highly quaffable (and bottle conditioned - a plus)."
"D: Good on a summer day if you like lemons."
"Notes: Really impressed with another Sam Adams craft beer. Bravo!"
"Value: B+"
"This might be one of the worst reviews I've given to a SA product. Glad this only was part of the seasonal mixed 12 pack, and that I didn't jump for a 6. Why make this? You've got the summer ale, and retired a perfectly good wheat beer. A funky, very different beer that I have trouble finishing. Gonna drink the rest of the pint with a bowl of popcorn. Would not be surprised if this brew disappeared from the SA stable of beers. Jim Koch, if you read BA, do us all a favor and dump this turkey."
"Pours a hazy pale honey color with a small tight white head that settled into a light ring. The aroma is of the wheat malt with lemon zest. Typical ""summer seasonal"" aroma that most breweries put out. The taste hits of lemons followed up by some grassy hops and a very grainy malt flavor. The flavors seems to clash and the lemon was added to cover up some of the odd flavors. Leaves an unpleasant aftertaste. The lemon flavor is actually nice but the rest doesn't do it for me. The feel is light to moderate with spritzy carbonation; finishes with an odd bitter twang. This beer is ok, not sure why they made it though. It seems as if they wanted to showcase the different lemons. If that was the case they should have used these lemons in their summer ale."
"D) A decent brew from Sam."
"An average wheat ale from the folks at Sam Adams."
"Pours a clear golden honey with a giant foamy head. The smell is light with cloves,wheat,banana,and lemon. The taste is light with lemon,wheat,bread yeast,and cloves. Not very strong and flavorful,but OK. This m/f is light with the flavors mixing only OK. Not a bad beer,but if you want a good summer wheat beer you can find better ones."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Decent weight for a wheat beer, easy to down without being too overpowering."
"Drinkablity: An alright beer. Couldn't find a big difference between this and Samuel Adams' other wheat brews."
"Overall it's nice, but nothing overly impressive. I'll take it, but I won't be in a rush to get another one."
"Overall, not a terrible beer, but I didn't find it to be well balanced and it bordered on tasting very artificial. Not my favorite Sam Adams offering but didn't think it was absolutely awful either."
"Poured into a Sam Adams glass. Big fluffy white head with good lacing and cloudy straw yellow body. Aroma of lemons and an overwhelming lemon flavor without being too sour. Trying to figure out just why this perfect summer-time brew is offered in the winter 12-pack."
"Pours cloudy orange hue topped by white frothy head. Aroma of floral notes, lemons, and flittering citrus notes. A spicy taste of citrus, lemons, ginger, orange soda, wheat. High carbonation that zaps the tongue with sizzle. A bit annoying in mouthfeel and the orange taste is an ultra sweet flavor that throws me off halfway through the pint."
"D - Great example of an American wheat beer. (although I am not sure why it appears in Sam Adams' winter sampler pack)"
"This was not a bad brew...it was easy to drink, but I'm won't be searching the stores for it either."
"D: I like the grainy beginning but I'm not much on the chemical feel."
"Not a bad light beer, I think it would do on a warm day. Kind of strange that this was in a winter mix pack. Not Sam's greatest effort, but I certainly didn't pour this down the drain either."
"MD- Okay but I would never buy or even try again."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle. Only a moderate head for a wheat beer, and this quickly disappears leaving only a thin white layer of foam, and moderate lacing. Beer is a hazy, semi-cloudy deep golden. Aroma has a weird, oddly chemically smell reminiscent of Lemon Pledge. Taste carries the same harsh artificial quality. Mouthfeel is thin, withy nothing special standing out. This beer is close to being undrinkable to me, and by far my biggest disappointment from Sam Adams."
"Pours a cloudy hazy light yellow color with a thick creamy head. The head gives way to some lacing. The aroma is of lemon, not much else, maybe some wheat. The taste is of wheat up front and then a lemon taste, the taste is a little stingy. Mouthfeel is good there is a moderate amount of carbonation. Drinkability is okay, you could have two or three but not many more. The lemon flavor was a little stingy and as you go the smell becomes a little like lemon pledge."
"This is a beer that completely under whelmed me. Sweetish wheat beer with a little lemon. A lot like their summer ale and I don't much care for that one either."
"Very ordinary..."
"I had this as a sample at the local liquor store. Interesting that they're putting out what I would consider a summer beer in the winter. The rep said it is flavored with the zest from three different lemons and you can definitely tell this. It has a huge lemon/citrus nose that follows into the flavor."
"Pale yellow colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is faintly lemon.Taste is zesty lemon with a wheat backing.Good beer that goes down smooth like water.I don't beleive I've ever had a bad Samuel Adams beer yet.I recommend and would purchase any of their beers."
"D- I like most of Sam Adams' lineup, but this is not one of my favorites and I probably wont buy again. I have never seen this beer until recently, and it makes me wonder why Sam Adams would release a citrus wheat ale with their winter lineup. Definatley suited more for the spring and summer variety packs."
"I got this beer from the Winter Brew 12-pack. This beer has a cloudy, gold color to it. It pours with a large head. The smell has a slight scent of lemons but not much else. The initial taste is sorta tangy. The beer seems a little rough when drinking. My overall experience of this beer does not leave me with the urge to try another."
"D-I'd say, given the abv and style, it's a very sessionable beer indeed."
"Overall, I have to say I'm happy this is included in the winter pack. A lot of people seem opposed to lighter beers in the winter but I actually like lighter beers occasionally in the winter just like I like heavy beers in the summer! It might be worth a try if you're not really into wheat beers (I personally am not) but probably not that great if you're really into them."
"Wow, I have been VERY impressed with BBC in the past. This is a big disappointment. Weak aroma, weak flavor and weak body. Even for an APWA, this is weak."
"Interesting and unexpected inclusion in the Winter Classics mixed pack. It's refreshing to have a summer-style beer in with the heartier offerings, but it still seems out of place. I'd much prefer to see Costal Wheat in the Summer mixed 12 pack where its nuances would be much more appreciated during that time of the year. It would make more sense for the Boston Brewing Company to include something along the lines of their Cream Stout or Scotch Ale or create something new instead of a pale wheat ale for winter."
"This beer is kind of like SA Summer Ale light... you really taste the lemon and it has a very light body with a bit more of a watery/wheaty finish than the summer ale. Fairly easy to drink, but not stunning in its flavor or complexity. The watery finish really takes away from the beer's enjoyability... I'm really only getting the lemon flavor and a little malt from this."
"D - The taste is holding me back from having more than 2. Too tart to really enjoy much of."
"Poured a very small head that left very quickly and left no lacing. Its a very hazy pale color. All I really get in the smell is tangy lemon zest, hops, and possibly some caramel malt, but maybe thats just me. The taste is mostly lemon, not tangy though, and a very small amount of hops. It leaves a less than decent after taste, i cant really describe it though."
"Not bad at all. This would be a good summer session. There is a little more flavor here than in some other Pale Wheat Ales. Worth a try, I just don't know why it is in the winter mixed pack?"
"Overall, a very bland, overly sweet wheat ale. Massive lemon. Wheaty, grainy quality is missing."
"A decent wheat, but nothing to get excited about."
"Cloudy and pale golden yellow with a thick fluffy white head. Sediment floating around. Looks very wheat beerish. Some lemon is detectable in the sent. Otherwise, nothing to get excited about. I liked the summer ale, and this reminds me alot of that. Clean, tangy, sour, not much bitterness. I'm not a huge fan of SA's heffeweizen. I don't like the bland sour aftertaste. This is better. I think the lemon helps. This is pretty good. Easy to drink and refreshing. It would be better in June than December. By that time the Summer Ale will be out. It doesn't make much sense to me to sell something very close to your summer seasonal in the dead of winter. But what do I know."
"D: I could see some people enjoying this and having several, but I'm not a fan. It's not so bad that I'd pour it, but it's definitely not winning me over."
"A good beer, especially on a hot day."
"Pours a lite-beer looking cloudy and golden yellow. Nice white head. Smell is of fresh lemon and sweet grasses. First taste hits the back of the gullet like a shot of lemon juice dropped into a hefeweizen. Left to linger in the mouth yet totally smooth, no bite to speak of. Not sure how this beer fits with winter weather at northern latitudes, but it would serve well on a hot summer's day."
"D: Pretty drinkable, this one is easy going down if you like lemon flavored beers. I could see this one being good in the summer time."
"D: Not bad. Above average beer. A good break from the traditional hefeweizen sans the yeast flavors. The strength of the flavors do limit the drinkability however."
"Overall this is the most disappointing beer of the Winter Sampler. I was definitely disappointing as I had enjoyed the Summer Ale very much."
"D-i can't imagine getting through a six-pack of this beer, i'll stick with my german wheat beers. i wish SA had the cream stout or something instead of this beer in the winter sampler."
"D - extremely drinkable. I really like it and so do my non-beer drinking friends"
"D: Nicely refreshing, easily drinkable especially on a hot summers day.My only gripe is why was this released as a Winter Beer? When people think winter beers they think dark, and heavy, not light and ""fruity"". Good beer but no suited for winter."
"More of a summer beer in their holiday pack."
"D - not bad. i'm not normally a big fan of wheat brews but this is one of the better ones, imo. would be better on a hot day after mowing the lawn, but a decent quaff."
"Sorry SA guys, I love most of your products, but this rushed release to compete with Bud Lit Wheat really should have been retooled. I wanted it to taste like the Hefewiezen or Summer Ale, but it didn't, and that makes me sad."
"Pours slightly hazy with a decent head that recedes fairly slowly and leaves some light lacing. The lemon flavor is present but not overwhelming. Taste is primarily of wheat with the lemon adding a nice taste near the end. Mouthfeel is perhaps a little chewier than typical for the style. Overall a nice beer, but out of place in a winter variety pack."
"Exactly what was expected from this beer, a good buy to experiment with and an enjoyable drink."
"It goes down very easy and has a bit of lacing and decent head retention."
"D - Its flavorful and enjoyable, especially for a hot summer day...I'd imagine. Seems strange they would release it with winter just around the corner. A good beer nonetheless, it has admirable qualities for what it is. Nicely crafted and easy to drink."
"Wow, this was a let down. I wasn't even expecting much, but how mediocre! I poured this into a pint glass, there was maybe a 1/4"" of bubbly white foam that held on for a little while. No lacing. The color was gold and very see-through (seems odd to me for a wheat beer). Only a slight haze. The smell was very faint oranges and lemon. The taste was even more faint. It's hard to even tell this is a wheat beer. There's virtually no body. Carbonation is zip. I guess drinkability is the best part of this beer; it's about as drinkable as a glass of water with lemon. This sucks because I like Sam Adams apart from this."
"D - This beer is a Wheat Ale, and what I like about it is that there are no spices added to the beer, like in their Summer Ale, which to me hurts the drinkability of beer that is designed to be refreshing, my only question is why they released it in the winter when people are craving big, thick, and dark beers"
"D - A worthwhile experiment that is ultimately not all that interesting. A good crossover beer, perhaps."
"interesting offering from SA...pours the expected bubbly pale wheat with a nice initial head...smells inviting, light lemon and wheat notes that are fully revealed in less balanced form in the taste...mouthfeel is not thin, but the texture seems, with it's bubbliness, soapy. still, you could knock these out all day in the spring...some coconut shrimp would go well with these."
"Atmosphere is pretty decent. Nice appearance, but pretty standard for this style. Nose is okay, but there's a strange soapy aroma that's pretty off-putting. Flavor is subtle all the way around. Overall, this is a decent quaff."
"D- Surprisingly the second flavor in this variety pack I am going to have to say ""No thanks"" to, bummer"
"A brew that would go much better as a summer offering, but I guess they threw it in as a light winter, or they didn't want it to compete against their own summer ale (which I enjoyed more than this one). I would much rather see a return of the Scotch Ale, to be honest. Whatever the case may be, it's a decent Pale Wheat. And that's what it is - ignore the descriptor on label that claims it to be in the traditional HW style - with or without a twist, it's not (but neither had been their HW). And, this is something of a step up from their HW, which this replaced."
"Overall: Jim had to of been drunk when he put this one on the list for the winter variety pack because this one sticks out like a sore thumb among the other brews."
"Pours a somewhat hazy medium yellow with a huge white foamy head that faded fast. This has a huge lemon smell, with smaller smells that are masked by the lemon. The flavor starts with a mild lemon, moves to a light hefe flavor, then finishes strong with the lemon taste that sticks around for awhile. This has a light mouthfeel, nice carbonation, but not balance most Sam Adams beers have, just heavy on the lemon peel. I can't imagine having more than a few, I am unsure why this is in a winter pack, would make a great summer beer. Not the best, could have been so much better."
"The Coastal Wheat pours a nice cloudy orange with little to no head worth mentioning. The scents ooze citrus and yeasty notes. The lemon is very obvious and the sweetness accompanies the lemon flavor nicely, not too overbearing. I usually don't enjoy fruity beers so much, but this worked quite nicely. Will probably purchase again individually (from the holiday samplers)."
"Smell is very reminiscent of the cherry wheat made by Sam Adams also. Must be a similar yeast strain. slightly sweet yeast and wheat malt stands out. fruity and light. first taste is smooth and sweet. citrus and malt notes. slightly spicy. light mouthfeel. some lacing. finish is clean. yeasty profile sticks for minute afterwords."
"Not bad."
"Drinkability: This is sessionable, light, and lemony. It is very much their blackberry wit minus the blackberries. Easy to drink but nothing out of the ordinary."
"Pours a nice golden sunny yellow with some decent initial head and some nice lacing. Very sweet and malty scent, nice wheat aromas, and has a large citrus ""ping"" in the nose. Nice taste, very balanced with the wheat being the strongest flavor (malty), which is followed by a nice lemon burst, and ends with a slight hoppiness at the end (couldn't place the hops). Goes down great. Would make a better summer beer than a winter beer, but still a good fruited wheat."
"Overall, this beer in the winter variety was a big surprise. Not a winter beer for me. Doesn't fit the season very much. It is drinkable, but I am not diggin' what SA did with this one."
"A drinkable wheat beer from Sam Adams. Very unoffensive, and worthy of sessioning."
"Got this one from a winter variety pack. It pours a nice golden color in the glass. The aggressive lemon smell reminds me of cleaning solution. The taste isn't too far off. This beer seems to have been a well intentioned attempt at adding something simple and refreshing to a variety pack. The execution just isn't there. Every sip reminded me of chemicals."
"Overall, a decent example of the style. The flavor is not over-the-top but more mellow. The citrus character is probably the most unique part of the flavor. Not quite the style of beer I prefer but considering it is a lighter beer, its not too bad."
"where the hell did this beer come from? I saw no promotions or advertising for it but sure enough it's sitting in my beer stores cooler. Frankly.. it's pretty boring, nothing you haven't tasted before, particularly from this brewery. Just a run of the mill light bodied lemon flavored wheat.. how was this beer decided on when trying to put a new beer in their winter seasonal? Must have been a big sale on lemons somewhere... I love ya SA but I don't like the cut of this one's jib."
"Sam Adams is very good at making a wide variety of styles but this beer should never have made it to the shelves."
"Perhaps on a hot summer day a cold glass of Coastal Wheat might be welcome, but I honestly doubt I'd be buying a six pack of this to fill that bill. Sam Adams brews a number of my favorite beers but Coastal Wheat is not one of them."
"Overall- Mediocre, not bad."
"A better beer than the score would indicate, but a few shortcomings keep it down. Worth trying for sure, and it may not be a bad beer to choose as an inspiration for homebrewers. Unique and interesting with room to improve."
"D - Easy to drink, but I'm not sure if I want to."
"What's the point here? Of all the fruits to make a beer with, lemon is probably the least interesting. I think the much maligned Cranberry Lambic is leaps and bounds better than this. The lemon peel was too acidic and bitter, and maybe lemon juice would have been better. And it's totally out of place in this season. It's a baffling choice, as there's no shortage of fruit/wheat Sam Adams beers, all of which are better than this, to my knowledge."
"Final thoughts: I expect much more from Sam Adams. They already have a Summer ale and a Hefeweizen, why are they pulling this crapper out? Furthermore, why is this in the winter seasonal pack?"
"D: Not my favorite Sam Adams offering, but it's decent. It definitely doesn't stand out from any other wheat beer I've had. Drink this one a little on the colder side and enjoy the citric sweetness and crisp mouthfeel."
"Overall i wasnt happy with this beer, i wasnt upset either. im a big sam adams fan but this beer didnt meet the style very well. Itd be a good beer for the summer but i dont see why it was included in the holiday pack."
"D: Very drinkable, as in you could put several back and not notice, but I'm a little disappointed, mainly because of the lack of aroma and because I've learned to expect better from Sam Adams. And why is this in the Winter collection?"
"Goes down easy, but it just isnt all that great taste-wise or smell"
"not sure why this is part of the winter sampler as it would make a perfect summer quaffer. i could drink a lot of these in the summer as a switch up from more traditional hefe's and wheat ales."
"Pours a very hazy gold. Think of a much cloudier budweiser. The smell is very citrusy, more lemon than oranges dominate. The smell reminds me of lemonade or possibly a shandy. After my first taste I've concluded that it also tastes like a shandy or a radler. Tart more than bitter. This might be the worst beer I've ever had from Sam Adams and I've had everything they put into six and twelve packs. Should be taken out of their lineup. I've had far worse beers, but they have so many other option available, I don't know anyone who will be head over heels for this."
"T -"
"Coastal Wheat is a disappointing effort from BBC. There's simply not enough flavor to call this one a success. It needs something to kick the flavor up a notch. Hops, spices, whatever. It isn't a total disaster, but could use some work. It's probably worth a try, but it won't ever be a staple in my fridge."
"D: Not too heavy so I could definitely have quite a few and not be full."
"The taste has a touch of nuttiness in there, there is some flat lemon flavors, nothing particularly tangy, there is a slight prickly feel on the tongue from the wheatiness. There is some raw graininess to the beer that helps add something to an otherwise pretty mediocre beer. There is this cardboard like nuttiness that is quite off putting. The beer gets a teeny bit better as it settles, but why wait, just go on and grab something else besides this one. You can do much better."
"D: Reminds me heavily of the Rossen (or was it called Rosser?) I drank in Munich, which is Hefeweizen mixed with lemon soda. This beer is light and goes down easy, but that's about all that's going for it. An OK experiment on the part of SA, but not worth a revisit."
"D= The abv is modest and the flavors are non-offensive so this is technically highly drinkable yet I don't want another. Nuff said."
"Pours a cloudy light orange, with a one inch frothy white head. Smells mainly of wheaty lemon and orange. The taste is more of the same with hints of lemon and orange with a light wheat maltiness to finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with some light carbonation. Overall it's not that bad of a beer; it beats the Cranberry Lambic, but nothing particularly exciting going on here. I can't help but compare this to their Cherry Wheat and Summer Ale, both of which they did a much better job on."
"This is a pretty average wheat beer - would've preferred to see the Cream Stout in the mixed 12 again this year. A wheat beer just doesn't seem to fit the season (unless it's the Imperial White)."
"Drinkability is quite good. Tasty, clean, very drinkable. This isn't a geek's beer, it's about as simple and straightforward as it comes, and it doesn't hold a candle to a German Hefe imo, but tasty for what it is. But still, a really odd choice for the winter pack. They should shove that in the summer or spring pack and replace that with a more seasonally-appropriate number for the winter."
"D- Not very good. I'm finding myself struggling to finish this one and not looking forward to the other one I have left. Here's hoping it won't be in 2010's Winter Classics pack."
"Overall impression: Meh - I'm not thrilled to have the rest of the six pack, avoid."
"I wouldn't search this out on it's own but it came in a mix pack so I'll drink it."
"Overall, this would be an OK summer thirst quencher, but nothing great."
"Drinkability: Refreshing and enjoyable, but lacking in the flavor department. Great beer for a summer day which begs the question- what the hell is it doing in the winter mixpack?"
"This is one Sam Adams that falls flat on its face. Why it is included in the Winter Classics 12-Pack is beyond me. Downright one of the worst wheat/hefeweizen style beers I've had."
"Stronger carb than I would have liked, medium bodied. Could see drinking this in the summer time, but was included in the Winter Pack."
"Pours a hazy golden orange, with a thin white head. Smells of lemon peel, and a hint of malt. Taste is tart citrus up front, yeasty and malty in the middle, and a tart, slightly sour lemon finish that fades into oblivion. Mouthfeel is not very hot either, somewhat watery, carbonation levels are fine though. Drinkability is decent, The lemon flavor gets to you though after awhile. This limits the drinkability. BBC makes much better beers in general, though this one isn't too bad. Seems way out of place in a winter pack though."
"Drinkability - Relatively drinkable. Although inappropriately placed in the winter classics, it worked fine today because I was outside reading in the Califronia sun and this was actually quite refreshing when I came in. Now to wait for it to get a little bit colder and crack open an Ole Fezziwig."
"D: I was nervous that this would be a cherry wheat or cranberry lambic-esque clone, with a borderline cloying fruit flavor. Thankfully, it isn't. This is a perfectly serviceable pale wheat ale, although it doesn't really separate itself from the rest of a muddled pack."
"D: Another solid, you know C+ wheat beer that Sam Adams makes, nothing offensive and some interesting flavours. Don't know why it was in the Winter mix pack, but it could be refreshing on a High Pressure November day after working outside."
"Tough to finish. There is too much wheat, too much lemon, and the puckering yeast dryness is off-putting. Certainly a lesser offering from BBC."
"Drinks easy but not than a thirst quencher. Not impressed..."
"Regardless, Great brew that i'll continue to enjoy."
"Not sure I'd say this is a APWA, but more of a spiced beer. Either way, a solid offering - probably a gateway beer for those people who think that blue moon is adventurous."
"D- Not bad, nothing special here. Really just seems like a slightly tweaked version of the Summer Ale without the soapy taste. I wouldn't refuse a free one but I wouldn't seek it out either."
"This one looks impressive. A nice pillowy white head sits atop a hazy straw colored body. Smells very lemony. Some notes of banana and wheat and just a hint of alcohol round things out, but man that citrus is pretty overpowering. The lemon doesn't run as rampant in the taste, as the wheat really begins to assert itself. I love the playful mouthfeel of this beer. It leaves me feeling like I ate a delicious cracker. I'm not sure that makes sense, but it's hard to describe. It kind of has an acidic drying effect, and as it warms it takes on a surprisingly buttery characteristic. Certainly an interesting brew, but the acidity gets a little harsh in the back of the throat so it loses some points for drinkability. I'm sure I'll come back to this at some point."
"Another solid SA offering. Certainly nothing special, but I'd buy it again. Maybe next time the lady will get to have one. Maybe not."
"Drinkability: Well, it was very easy to drink. It wasn't bad, there just wasn't much to it. That being said, I don't usually like wheat beers, but I enjoyed this one. I agree with some of the other views that it's a bit surprising to find this in a winter mix pack. This is something I'd enjoy by the pool on a hot summer day. I was pleasantly surprised by this one."
"Though the beer is off season, it's a nice welcome that should do well with the Blue Mooners and Golden Wheateers looking for a step up. But for the serious craft beer lover, the beer is a bit too one-dimentional expecially with all the Porters, Stouts, and Barleywines to be consumed this Fall and Winter."
"I would have preferred to see a Kölsch style or Blonde Ale, filtered with more of a sweet/sour lemon edge ... not too far off from other beers they brew; they brew a wit, beery-wits, the summer ale and now a lemon version. Is this reactionary to the cloudy beers that have come from the bigger breweries?"
"The feel this beer is pretty light. A beer that does not weight your mouth down with too much makes for a pretty good session beer and a good summer beer as well. This is pretty drinkable and is nice on a hot day."
"Drinkable and rather average overall. Not quite sure why Sam Adams decided to add this beer to their portfolio though."
"The beer pours an opaque colored haze, nice looking beer and has a good full head that leaves lacing. In the sam adam's tradition, it is a good looking beer. That is where it ends, however! Extremely hard to finish, has oft-kilter flavours, tastes as if lemons were added instead of malted, very unbalanced. Sam Adams cannot make a good Hefe, and I don't know why. Need to fill the holiday classics packs with more Fezzelwig and Holiday Porter, cause those are outstanding. This one is not a good one."
"Tried this at a distributor trade show and was shocked how bad this beer is, especially from illustrious Samuel Adams. I do not know what they were aiming at here. But this is one Sam Adams than can easily be skipped. This stuff makes Leinenkugel's Shandy look good. Take some ordinary beer and add lemon juice and I think you could obtain better results. This was truly shocking, and not in a good way."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a 1/2"" white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a crisp, pale and wheat malt scent along with a mild lemony zest. The taste is decent. It has a highly drinkable pale wheat flavor with a dry, lemony finish. It has a moderate hefe yeast character. It's light with a nice citrus touch. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tastey beer. I don't know why it's in the winter collection, but I'd buy this one again."
"The dry, crisp, but full body of apwa's"
"Drinkabliilty is not bad. It goes down pretty easy and would probably be good on a summer day which is why I don't feel that it have should have been placed in the Winter Classics pack. Its fairly good but not something I'd make a run for."
"Drinkability: Sufficient enough for the one bottle, though I doubt I'll be revisiting this particular offering. Is it replacing the Samuel Adams Summer Ale? If not, I fail to see the need for the addition of another mild wheat beer to their line-up. Ah well... C'est la wheat!"
"D - This is a nice wheat ale. It would make a great summer/lawnmower beer."
"Extremely drinkable, but what's the motive behind this beer? It's rather reminiscent of the brewery's Summer Ale, or a touched-up Sam Adams Hefeweizen. Nothing outstanding or very distinctive, and certainly not really deserving of being inserted into the Winter Classics pack. It's understandable why this wasn't heavily marketed: There's nothing especially ""new"" about it. A solid beer, no doubt, but a bit boring and released in a less-than-opportune season."
"Beer had a nice hazy golden color and a lemony aroma. The initial taste to me mirrored the aroma, but like I said before I swear I get peppermint in the finish...Overall I liked it very good beer."
"Jim - why did you replace the Hefe (which was NOT a Hefe, but an American Wheat) with another American Wheat? Why not make a real Hefeweizen?"
"I don't get it replace your hefe that was actually an American Wheat to an American Wheat with lemon peels. Why not do a real German style hefeweizen to join the party of Cherry Wheat, Double White, White Ale, DunkelWeizen and Summer. That's alot of wheat beer. Maybe it's time to do a different style, how about an IPA. Pale hazed golden orange hue with a bright white head, leaves behind speckled lacing. Aroma has a biscuit malt character a lot of yeast nuttiness with citrus peels apparent. Not much sweetness or hops going on here. Pretty abrasive with lemon peel zest bitterrness and tart wheat blended with that nasty dry nutty yeast notes. Mouthfeel overall is pretty harsh with the carbonation levels just an unpleasant experience with the lemonpeel left on the palate after each sip. Drinkability is poor this is one that should be skipped and I enjoy most of the Sam Adams brews out there."
"drinkability is ok - i would never buy this beer as a single but it was a nice change of pace in the winter 12 mix"
"If it was still summer, I can see this beer going down easier on a hot day. But the lemon was a bit much. Seems to fit in with my opinion of other Sam Adams beers. Nothing spectacular, but nothing offensive enough to make it undrinkable. I'd much sooner pick up their White Ale or Imperial White."
"I would probably not get one of these again unless it was presented to me as a surprise with a bow on it"
"Not recommended... not terrible, but not worth seeking out."
"I've tried over 40 of SA's brews, many of which are wheat beers. They just don't seem to have a handle on light colored wheats. Even a Shocktop with a lemon twist has more character (it pains me to say that). Their dark wheats fare much better."
"D- A little too sweet and bubbly for my tastes."
"If not , probably best to stick with one of the imported wheat beers."
"Drinkability: I was surprised when I found this in the store since I had no idea it was coming out. It's worth a try but don't expect anything groundbreaking from this beer."
"Taste: Also awesome in the taste department. It kinda reminds me of Leinenkugel Sunset Wheat with it's sugary fruitiness."
"Poured into a pint glass the beer was a hazy pale orange color with a medium-sized white head. It had a strong citrus aroma as well as cracker-like aroma. The citrus aroma did not translate to the taste, however. Only a very subtle lemon taste, and the aforementioned cracker. I thought this beer was on the tepid sideand not something i'd want to drink a lot of."
"I don't really understand the thinking behind this new release from Sam Adams. If you want to put out an American wheat why not just make summer ale a year around beer? In my opinion, it's a significantly better beer than this one. I'd like to see brewing companies with the stability and means of Boston Beer Company to push the boundaries of beer rather than continue to release dumbed-down versions of already over-brewed styles."
"I can see myself revisiting this as it's another pleasant offering from Sam Adams. It's what I've come to expect from them, a solid beer with some good flavor."
"Overly yeasty. I'm not a fan of wheat ales and this one does nothing to change my mind about the style."
"12oz brown bottle purchased at Hannaford in Derry. pours a murky dark straw color with a half inch of off white that slowly dissipated and leaves a little bit of lacing. scents of lemon pulp, juice and zest. lemon lemon lemon. lemon across the board. tastes of lemon juice. it tastes like the brewer poured a bottle of pure lemon juice into the batch and you can't even taste the malts at all. moderately carbonated. lemon lemon lemon."
"12oz brown bottle obtained at Hannaford in Derry. Pours a murky golden yellow body with nearly an inch of off-white head that dissipates somewhat quickly. Smells very lemony and pithy, with just a hint of vanilla. Tastes rather lemony too, with pith and zest joining juice in the flavor. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Relatively drinkable. Not bad, but rather one-dimensional and the lemon gets to be a little much after a while. One was more than enough for me."
"Pours a cloudy golden with nice white head. Not much retention,but decent lacing. Aroma is of citrus with bready and yeasty undertones. Body is medium and carbonated. Taste is yeasty up front with a nice fruity finish. refreshing and very easy to drink."
"SA does it again."
"Very similar across the board to a hefe-weizen plus the lemon bonus. Very, very drinkable."
"I'm not sure how many more wheat beers BBC needs in their lineup but this spot could have gone to a more interesting beer, rather than a bland american wheat."
"D: I'd really have to be eating something (BBQ) and definitely in the summertime to put this one down regularly. Instead of re-branding the Hefeweizen, I think they just made something closer to Sam Adams Summer Ale to have off-season or year round. A decent hot weather brew, just take a Pepcid or something beforehand."
"I got about half way through the glass. Could do without seeing this one waiting for me again."
"Pours a four finger off-white head that fades slowly and leaves some lace. Cloudy pale amber color. Lemon rind nose. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is off-tasting lemon rind. Not the usual lemon/yeast flavor. Very unpleasant wheat. Best by Mar 2010. $1.50 for a 12oz bottle from Manchester Wine and Liquors Manchester, CT. So new it isn't listed yet on their site."
