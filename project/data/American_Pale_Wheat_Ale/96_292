3.49,4.2,3.25,3,3.5,3.75,4,"Hocus Pocus brewed by Magic Hat Brewing Company with an ABV of 4.5. This is an wheat ale but it is filtered wheat ale. This is not not like your typical wheat brews on the market, that are unfiltered. Hocus Pocus pours out a nice golden amber color with a white head. Nice and crystal clear. The smell is nice and clean you pick up on kiss of wheat. The taste is bold with a little bite of citrus to it. There is some citrus and grains. Nothing bad about taste. This brew has a nice balance to it, there is nothing over powering in this beer. This beer goes down nice and smooth and clean. The finish is nice and clean. Magic Hat Brewing Company did a nice job with this one. I would get this brew again. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5","nicholas2121","Jun 16, 2014"

The aroma is a light mix of musty yet bright hop bitterness, a little lemon, and some earthy wheat. The flavor largely features a biscuity, almost tangy, light malt sweetness, but there is also a bit of dry, herbal hops to balance. Like the flavor, the texture is light but not too thin. Overall, this beer is light and drinkable, but it has a nice mild yet varied flavor profile that lifts it above "bland" to "subtly pleasant."","devilben02","Nov 07, 2012"

Lacing is dry and sheet-like on the glass. The beer smells wet, fresh, and sweet with some light hop-spice and citrus accentuations and a ghost of biscuity malt behind it. The beer tastes bitterly wheat-like with some nice citrus accentuations. The flavor reminds me a lot of A Little Sumpin Sumpin Ale by Laguinitas, only not as tasty… There are some nice Cascade hop notes in the taste and an astringent bitter on the tongue. The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, like a nice summer ale with a little bit of an acidic bite from the carbonation. The mouth is left wet with saliva and a slight bitter burn on the tongue. Overall this is a nice example of the style, though I can’t say it is my favorite. The bitter is a little too present without a hop character to tenderize it out on the tongue. This beer is mediocre but worth a try.","Maxwell","Sep 09, 2012"

The mouthfeel is pretty light but the taste was better than the aroma led me to believe it would be. Aftertaste is bitterness.This will never be confused with the bigger heavier beers, but when you’re in the mood for something other than a heavy beer, this works.

A good citric hop taste hit my tongue as the medium-bodied beer passed over smooth, almost slick. The beer is light on spices but they're there and the yeast/wheat sediments in there give it a somewhat creamy and sweentness.

The beer starts with a mostly clear straw color, fair initial head formation that didn't retain as well as prefered. Aromas are part-pilsner malt, part-grain, and with a soft herbal, floral hop note that saves the aroma. Flavors have a better malt profile than the nose suggests, however the cereal grain flavors do come though as well as a coarse astringency late. Soft wheat malt flavors are found but only after searching for them. But the wheat does little to soften the textures or give any rich breadiness, sweetness, or body. A subtle fruitiness comes though as pears and apples. Finishes with a linger of the herbal hops and cereal grains.","BEERchitect","Jul 24, 2008"

Although I do detect some honey flavor and hop floralness. This beer starts off better than it finishes. It is, not suprisingly, a little bit tart and a little bit dry -- but as the beer warmed, I detected a slight, not completely pleasant bitter flavor. This aside, it is not a bad offering from Magic Hat -- just not one of their best. If you want a beer for relief from the heat, you could do a lot worse that to try hocus pocus.

A bit of a sour smell, but I won't hold that against it. The taste is extra mediocre; a bit bland with some hops and a hint of a flavor that weirdly reminds me of lime juice. A little on the watery side. The carbonation level is about right, but I just can't excited enough about this one to come back too many times.","scriabin","Jun 11, 2004"

The taste is good. It has a smooth and refreshing wheat flavor that goes down really easy. It has a fruity finish; a very light beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a decent wheat beer, but it is still a good drinker. It is quite refreshing; a good hot weather beer.","WesWes","Jun 07, 2004"
2.65,-20.9,3.5,3.5,2,3,2.5,"Eh. Wasn't too impressed. Summer ale with a very citric taste, lemon and... orange maybe? Reminds me of Sam Adam's Summer Ale but not as drinkable. Don't get me wrong, decent beer but you have to have the taste for it... which I don't, citrus beers are starting to get on my bad side. Probably not something I'll buy again.","MattFrenzy","Jun 06, 2004"
2.25,-32.8,3.5,3.5,1.5,2,2,"Very clear light light gold with sticky white head. Decent retention. Funky ringwood aroma with a honey dirtiness to it. Very intriguing - I like it. Flavor is very dry with some astringency. Very bland flavors of spiciness that leave my mouth tingling a bit. The carbonation is medium, but combined with the taste it becomes harsh. Not a very (I need to stop saying very) good beer. I hope not to have it again.","waughbrew","May 30, 2004"

The aromas are wheaty and citrus-like with that funky/fruity yeast strain of theirs (ringwood) in the mix as well. The taste is very citrus-like and wheaty with a nice fruity balance to it as well. The mouthfeel is light and the drinkability is good. A good, if uncomplex, american wheat beer. Definately a good summer pick.","francisweizen","May 17, 2004"
2.83,-15.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,3,"To be honest with you, Hocus Pocus really didn't knock my socks off. Sure, it's good, but to me, this is just average. Poured out a golden color with little carbonation. Aroma of some wheat, malts and some lemon pop up. Taste was actually a little smooth and creamy, with some hop bite at the end, but wasn't very impressive at all. Finishes quite dry. Granted, in the summer time I wouldn't mind buying a 6-pack once in a while, but I would rather go for something else. This beer is a little overpriced IMO.","necoadam","Feb 20, 2004"

4.08,21.8,2.5,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Chill-hazed amber with nary but a halo-like trace of a head. Sweetish barley aroma with a hint of leafy hops. This aroma is surprisingy invigorating and fresh smelling. The flavor starts with a mildly sweet malt but is very well-balanced by just a hint of graininess and a subtle piney/leafy hop finish. Very clean and poppy -- though the sweetness starts to come through a bit too much as the beer warms, partly due to undercarbonation. Overall, though, this is definitely a good, wholesome, Vermont beer. Makes me feel like raising a barn with some Amish folk. Except that's Pennsylvania. And I guess the Amish don't drink. Or do they? Ah well, you get my drift.","mzwolinski","Sep 15, 2003"

An interesting and lively aroma  Sweet honey, citrus and floral tones. Prominent are fresh berries and grapefruit. Beer has a pleasant bitterness and a biting dryness to it. Body is medium to light and finishes with leaving an orange taste in the mouth. This has a lot going for it  plenty of complex flavors, a perfect balance between dry and sweet, and most important, a very high drinkability. A very fine beer.","pezoids","Sep 09, 2003"

Flavor is a spritzy rush of citrus I wanna say lemon sweetness no sourness here just the tone is light crisp and refreshing with the malts playing second fiddle to the party and a welcoming bitterness also exists in this great summer brew quite the experience in a bottle. Mouthfeel has a healthy carbonation not cloying in anyway with some texture in the form of watered down syrup not bad at all. Drinkability is pretty good but this bottle is wearing on me, I don't know if I could consume this in mass quantity.","WVbeergeek","Aug 08, 2003"
3.72,11,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Overall - A very drinkable summer-style beer. Towards the end of the beer, the tart/sour characteristic began to somewhat take over any other flavors.

2.92,-12.8,3,3.5,2.5,3,3,"Definitely pale, with a thin off white head that dissipates quickly. Very fruity aroma with a decent hop note. Buttery, bitter taste that leaves me working my jaws like a dog licking peanut butter. The bitterness reminds me a bit of an old vegetable, maybe asparagus that grew too long in dry conditions. Mouthfeel is harsh carbonation accompanied by a sugary coating that just keeps clinging to your teeth and tongue. There is a solid malt backgorund, but there's way too much funkiness going on here. Drinkability isn't bad, but I'm glad I didn't pour a double of this. Hocus Pocus, please make it disappear.","aaronh","Aug 03, 2003"
3.85,14.9,3.5,3.5,4,3,4.5,"Taste: Very crisp and refreshing. Solid, yet light, mouthfeel. Initial sweet malt, lemony citrus, and a slight honey tinge.

3.33,-0.6,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a medium amber color, darker than I expected, with an impressively thick white head. Aroma is also surprisingly hoppy, much more assertive than I anticipated. Definite lemony wheaty scent, dry and a touch hoppy citric. The hops and lemon flavors work very very well together. Flavor is much less hoppy than the aroma would indicate, although hops come through somewhat in the middle and finish lightly in the end, providing a very pleasant clean dry finish when coupled with the wheat malt. Very very slight clove taste. Flavor is mostly crisp and dry wheatiness, with little in the way of esters. Body is light, carbonation is definitely active. While i wouldn't really like this any other time of the year, this is definitely lawn-mowing beer. Not bad, better than I expected. It's no german hefe, but it did the trick today.","UnionMade","Jul 22, 2003"

3.9,16.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"A hazy yellow gold body is capped by a decent-sized lid of bright white foam. And although it drops within a relatively short period, it does maintain a very nice creamy surface covering and leaves continuous rings of spotty lace throughout the glass. The aroma displays the typical Ringwood yeast nose and a touch of wheatish malt that's mildly lemonish. The body is light, as a summer beer should be, and the very fine carbonation gently caresses the tongue as it slides across the palate. In the flavor a delicate wheat-based malt is gently tangy and a touch citrusy and floral, backed by a supportive hop bitterness. It finishes clean and dry with the exception of some lingering yeast character and a mild touch of hops. This is the kind of beer that grows on you, and although it may seem very basic at first, it actually has enough going on to keep it interesting throughout a few. Well done!","NeroFiddled","Jun 11, 2003"

Aroma was flat and citrusy with a bit of floral hops. The flavor is rather interesting, very soft on the tongue finishing with a slight bitterness. A great summer beer, and judging by the taste, I think this would pair beautifully with seafood dishes, especially shellfish. Interestingly enough, I noticed the same quality with MH's Single Chair, and the more I think about it, the more I am wondering if those two brews are actually the same brew.

Kind of hard to describe, but reminiscent of a German dunkel. The mouthfeel was smooth and mellow - very pleasant! Slightly sweet, medium light bodied, but with a crisp finish. I found this ale to be very drinkable, but difficult to categorize (not surprising with a Magic Hat beer). In any event, I enjoyed it very much. It went down easy.","UncleJimbo","Feb 28, 2003"
