Citrus, hay, and passion fruit aromas waft over maple syrup. Thick body. Very bright Orangina like nose. A little bread. Some bananas and apricots mid-palate. Hint of lager hops and barley back palate. Crisp but wet in mouthfeel. A little banana bread, gum, and slight hop note in the aftertaste. Very drinkable. Would go well on a hot day. Not overly complex. A fairly straight forward low citrus Hefenweizen. 3.5 out of 5. Good.","digitalflood","Dec 05, 2013"

Only half a finger or so of white foam tops the beer, and both head retention and lacing are basically nonexistent. The nose is entirely too weak. There's a bit of grainy wheat, and a trace of lemon, but that's it. The flavor profile is better, but just barely. The same wheatiness greets me first with each sip, but here it's followed by a light sprinkling of black pepper. A muted lemon zest note provides the finish. The body is a little full, and the carbonation a little lackluster, but still the mouthfeel is probably this beer's best quality. Circus Boy tastes like it's a bit past it's prime (not that there's any bottle dating present), but I don't think even in peak condition it's much more than an alright wheat beer (and for the love of God, don't call it a hefeweizen).","axeman9182","Dec 15, 2012"

Anyway, this stuff pours a clear straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises wheat, corn syrup, and very light lettuce. There's a palpable sweetness pervading. The taste holds notes of light funky wheat, old lemon peel, and a pinch of black pepper. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a surprisingly very dry finish. Overall, a pretty sad hefe. The yeast character is nil, the wheat is funky, and things just seemed generally off.","TMoney2591","Dec 14, 2012"

I suppose this is meant to be enjoyed with a lemon wedge. I would never turn this down, and if there were not so many fantastic local alternatives, I can't find any reason why I wouldn't want some stocked in my fridge, especially during the summer months.","allforbetterbeer","Dec 12, 2012"

That review is from 2006, so maybe something has changed in the beer since then in spite of the name being the same, but iin reading Jason A's review I am not drinking the same quality of beer.

I'm not sure why it's categorized in the APWA category, as there is almost no hop flavor to it.

I had this for the first time back in March 2008 and I really enjoy it ever since. The beer poured out as a nice hazy yellow color, much like a Hefeweizen should look. The head was fluffy and white. The smell of the beer has a nice clove, banana, and wheat aroma coming off of it. The taste has the banana and wheat flavors through out the beer. I never tried this with an orange wedge but I'm sure that's pretty good too. The mouthfeel is light and creamy feeling, very drinkable summer brew.

2.83,-16.3,3.5,3,3,2,2.5,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer pours a pale, hazy, flat yellow-gold coloring with a thin, white, loose bubbled head that is steady at an eighth of an inch while you drink. Aromas are a jumble of fruit sweetness, all of which are fairly watered down. Smells include lemon zest, banana, pineapple, pear, and a little bit of spicing (maybe coriander, maybe grains of paradise?). Interesting. Flavors are watered down, also, and the body is limp and lackluster, with blend of bready characteristics, lemon zest, pear, some weak spicing. The aftertaste is like drinking the juice from a fruit salad. Quick, semisweet finish, watery and weak. The beer is extremely light, and great on a hot day. Not huge on flavor, though.","GarthDanielson","Jul 23, 2011"
3.47,2.7,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This one seems to have a pretty decent hop schedule as there is a nice bitterness to compliment the wheat tang. Soft, lemony citrus flavors up front are followed by one of the stronger wheat backbones. Finish is pretty dry and bitter. It is pretty interesting to try, a bit different than your typical wheat beer. I dont think I will be running out to grab a sixer anytime soon, but I enjoyed my single well enough.","twiggamortis420","Jul 23, 2011"
3.46,2.4,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"""Gently roused"" this pours an entirely hazed lite straw-yellow, with a *ton* of head. This settles down to a sticky ring. Nose is mineral and a lot of a specific potpourri-like spice that I can't quite place. Taste is a sour affair for a wheat ale. Lemon-grass and the aforementioned mystery spice round out the flavor. Finishes deep with some pleasant hops. Mellows out a bit too. Out-of-the-ordinary brew, but nothing spectacular.","sixerofelixir","Jul 20, 2011"

The smell was like a traditional German hefe with the clove, yeast, and ripe banana notes. The taste was more citrusy with some lemon peel and almost candied lemon zest in the background.

3.41,0.9,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - Honestly, it isn't all that bad for what it is.

The flavor is pretty tame for a hefe, grainy, a bit of lemongrass flavor peaks through, I get some hits of fruity flavor from the yeast. The mouthfeel is somewhat thin.

These types of beers are perfect for a jump for people who want to try something other than the big 3. Yet they always seem to go for these wheat fruity type beers.

Looked OK in the glass (actually surprising clear for something called a Hefeweizen... maybe they need to check the definition of the German word) and the smell was pretty clean, predominantly light malted wheat with no citrus present. The initial flavor was great, somewhat clean and biscuity with a subtle lemon flavor that wasn't citrusy at all but had the character of a flavor hidden in the hops matrix... so I checked the bottle. Lemon grass. No wonder. Not really lemon at all, but a really unique (and surprisingly pleasant) flavor that enhanced the wheat. I liked this a lot and I can't wait to share it with someone I know (J) who is an American Wheat fan.","tugdriver7","Jan 27, 2011"

High amount of carb and thin, light feel which is expected for the style. I am a little bummed out that there isn't any banana or clove character in either the nose or the taste but it still fits the bill.

What sets it a bit apart is the lemongrass.. The citrus character that is contributed to the beer is really a great addition. The use of lemongrass, specifically, as opposed to just lemon juice or some otehr straight forward fruit citrus also contributes an interesting character to the flavor with a floral sort of presence that in a way is reminiscent of hops but slightly different. Other than that the other thing to note would be a very good drinkability. the light mouthfeel and body give it an airy, refreshing quality that makes drinking several quite easy. It also pairs nicely with a variety of fodos it seems.","BirdFlu","Jul 05, 2009"

Full nostril presence, semi-oily feel with resin, tea leaf, wet shredded wheat and a pinch of lemon to orange peel, for its weight the scents lack staying power. Very similar in the mouth, a lot of sheer weight and heft with the flavors attempting to conjure up freshness while instead coming across as hollow. Malts lend more smoothness across the palate than direct flavor. Not intensely wheaty, more a mix of grains and grasses devoid of bitter bite. Moderate dose of lemon citrus. The carbonation is strong, however, unable to create a cleansing sensation at the end. Hence, falls forward awkwardly towards the finish line. Needs more focus and purpose.","farrago","Jan 29, 2009"

It's very refreshing and worthy of multi pint fulls, no problem. A bit aqueous but nothing so unusual for this style. These can go down fast. Not too much aftertaste, just a bit of rye bread perhaps.

The taste has the mellow wheat flavor without the tart/drying punch that most pale wheat ales have. However there are no phenols to speak of, no true hefe characteristics.

Flavors of wheat malt and barley struggle to give the beer a decent sweetness or body over the tart citric acids. Lemons and grapefruit (not hops) govern the flavors, allowing a bruised-appricot flavor to prevail. Dirty tasting phenols gain intensity as the beer warms, leaving a musty, dusty, attic-like taste on the toung, particularly in the finish. Body starts firm, but finishes thin because of the acidity.

The taste was fair, actually when I first took a sip I really though that this was going to be a good beer IMO. Noticeable lemon flavors which add a zest to it at first then wheat spiciness which where nice.

The taste is what you'd expect; bananas, maybe some toasted wheat notes in there, I'd reviewed a couple by the time I took these notes. The mouthfeel was duly creamy.

The grainy sweetness and the sweet wheat come out more as it warms. There is a sllight clove/banana aroma that lingers. The spicy flavors transfer over to the taste. It is followed by a sour tartness, that is rather pleasant in my book. That lemon spicy flavor is really predominate in the flavor.

Malted wheat, two-row, and earthy yeast in the nose. First sip is sweet with pale malt and wheat, backed by snappy tropical fruit and faint yeast notes. The aftertaste is hesitantly drying, with a citrusy american hop flavor and sharp bitterness that melds with the phenolic fruit flavors to balance the malt very well. Medium-light bodied; drawing texture from the wheat and suspended yeast- the carbonation is crisp and aided by the zesty fruit character which enlivens the mouthfeel. Finishes dry with minimal residual wheat and pale malt, and a assertive but fading tartness. This one really blurs the line between Pale Wheat Ale and Hefe-Weizen, but the inticing flavor profile and high drinkability would assure its success in either catagory.","PBRstreetgang","May 02, 2007"

The wheat tastes nutty/tangy, and there are notes of citrus, medicinals, light banana, and a medium bitterness on top of a medium body that is quite smooth, with medium carbonation and finish.

Fortunately, take a sip and the fishy-metallic odor translates to a savory flavor with a slight twang. As the beer warmed, I was able to discern a distinct goaty undertone and lemon highlights, which would be particularly delicious if paired with the right food.

Moderately dry with a light, spritzy character. The citrus quality really comes out in the taste. Not much in the way of phenols or esters, just straightforward wheat. This gives the beer a bit of a ho-hum quality. There may be a sketch yeast taste, but its not a centerpiece of the beer.

Overall, the flavors in this beer aren't incredibly great or anything, but they are interesting, which is a step up for most American wheat beers. This is one of the better Magic Hat brews I've had recently.","geexploitation","May 18, 2006"

The beer was a hazy yellow with a fairly small head that lingered. It had a sweet, grainy aroma. Taste-wise, it was mostly sweet, with a slight citrus flavor. Nothing too special.

It's got a nice foamy head on it also, moderate lacing and carbonation. Smells of light fruits (bananas), yeasts, and malts.

Scattered fingers of lace. Nose is a subdued clove and wheat mixture, and a slight lemon note. Taste is a grainy wheat with an almost tart lemon, finishes with a very gentle spice note. Bit on the thin side of medium. This is a decent easy drinking beer, but nothing really stands out, and this probably isn't a beer I'll purchase again.","cubedbee","May 12, 2006"

A careful pour produces a cloudy but vibrant amberish-yellow beer with an off-white, foamy, medium-sized head that quickly diminishes to a thick film. The smell is mild and sweet with plenty of fruit, most notably apple and white grape, with light citrus and berry. Reminiscent of champagne. Some mild grain and slightly off-putting yeast. Tastes kind of like a wheat wine cooler. A little less fruity than the nose while still remaining vinous. Its fairly thin and lively with a finish that turns a bit bready, followed up by a chalkiness very late in the finish. Definitely a different one and worth trying out their interesting take on the style.","ski271","May 05, 2006"

I'm not sure if its from the hops but I am enjoying it more and more with each taste.

The lemon seems kind of artificial, like it doesn't belong in the flavor profile. If this is the Batch 370, I liked it much better in it's previous incarnation, a much more authentic bavarian feel. Dryish and powdery mouthfeel, a sparkling carbonation keeps things lively. Seems like there's fairly strong citrusy hops, which feels out of place with this beer. Then again, the citrus feels like more the product of one of those lemon shaped lemon juice bottles than hops or actual lemon. Kinda wierd. It is refreshing, and satisfies my desire for a beer, but I'd be happier with something else. Not quite what I want for late winter.","UnionMade","Feb 25, 2006"

Bottle advertises ""unfiltered and unfettered", but other than a very slightly cloudy color, no matter how close I examine it I do not see anything in the beer.

In some weird hybrid they manage to make a interesting Hefe. A orange body lays under a dense white head pour that fades to no head in sort order. I liked the first bottle better that being the warm one; it tasted bolder, but suffered with some extra thickness in the body. Good citrus and wheat smell, a touch of spice and a some bready-yeast for measure. The taste is quite dynamic, it moves from wheat beer Americano to Hefe clove citrus and back again. Good beer my only complaint and not really is that it seem too thick, but it is a good drinker and something to session.","Higravity","Feb 25, 2006"
