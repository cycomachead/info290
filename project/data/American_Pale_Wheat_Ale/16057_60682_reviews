"Light, sweet, and summer-y. Drank out of the can, so not sure about the look."

"My parents brought these back from Hawaii with them for me. Solid beer. Have to visit the brewery someday."
""
""

""

"Clean, with a body similar to a hefe.  Tastes are dominantly wheat with pineapple juice.  Wish I would have picked up a full pack of this.  An interesting take on this style and one that makes me more curious about this brewery."

"Some more beery edge underlying could really make this pop. Pleasant summery Mauiesque drop, but feel it could really be an intriguing beer if consumed fresh, as it's well crafted."
""

"O: A refreshing summer beer. Nothing too serious - a fun beer. I like the pineapple here."

"O: I am normally not a big fan of wheat beers but I enjoyed this one quite a bit. I think the hint of pineapple makes the difference."
""
"O: A very good fruity wheat ale. Definitely recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy, gold color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of wheat, pale malt, slight sweet malt, hint of lemon, and hint of hop. Fits the style of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of hint of lemon, hint of clove, wheat, slight pale malt, and slight sweet malt. Overall, good appearance, feel, body, and blend."

"Not a real complex beer but rather a summer patio quencher that makes good use of the wheat notes and the added pineapple flavour . Not too sweet and quite nice on the finish this is easy drinking and decent for the style. Compares with Kona's wheat beer though they use passionfruit as an addition. Tastes better on a Maui beach."

"O - Had quite high hopes for this beer which partly explains my slightly scathing review. The lack of pineapple on the palate was a missed opportunity and overall this beer did very little for me. I think the explanation for this lies in my expectation of a beer which would have fruity and wheaty characteristics. If you go into it expecting a slightly wheaty lager with pineapple in the nose you might not be as disappointed. Forgettable yet drinkable."
"As expected, this is a fairly simplistic wheat beer that has been infused with pineapple. Easy drinking, not bad and it can hit the spot when ice cold on a hot Summer’s day. The pineapple definitely contributes quite a bit more to the nose than it does the flavor."

"This one makes it seem like pineapple is a natural for brewing with. Fortunately the flavor is on the subtle side. This could put the Blonde Ales out of business. It actually tastes better as it warms up a little. A beery light beer with a touch of flavor, if that's what you're hoping for. From the 12 oz can bought at Beercraft in San Diego."
""
"As it warms up, the pineapple flavor and the aroma open up more and more. Great beer that incorporates some local fruit, doesn't mask the original style, creates something different and good! I would recommend this beer to anyone who likes fruit beers that are not TOO sweet!"

"O: Refreshing, creamy, with a hint of sweetness, an enjoyable beer for hot weather."
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty simple tasting beer, but refreshing and tasty. Would love to have access to dozens of cheap cans of this stuff."
"7.0/10"
"O: Refreshing light beer – worthy of a try."
""
""
""
"As expected this one is pretty tropical and fruit with a good, refreshing taste to it and one that made for easy drinking. A great tasting beer that mixes a traditional hefeweizen with tonnes of tropical flavours and somehow it works."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Pretty average APWA. Simple, two note flavor. Fizzy. Fairly hefty price tag. Not a good combination. Good summer brew, but there are considerably better options at half the cost. Needless to say, I won't be buying this again."
""
""
""
"a cloudy honey colored pour with a finger of head (which quickly diminished). scents of lemongrass, sour notes, bready. a slightly tart, sweet bready malt with a hint of citrus. sweeter than most wheat beers. medium body with low carbonation and is surprisingly refreshing. a nice surprise. wasn't expecting much from this one but it was really nice and sweet for the style."
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad beer but you'll forget about it rather quickly. It's just too light in terms of flavor and body to leave any sort of impression. There are a number of other wheat beers I'd rather drink than this one."
""
""
""
"A very light tasting beer, not much to write home about unless you need a lighter beer to cool off with after running a marathon or something."
"OVERALL: A nice simple wheat with a pretty good balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Carbonation is much too high and the body feels a bit watery."
""
""
""
"A lot of wheats can be boring, this one offers a unique flavor and wasn't bad at all considering how old it is."
""
"Overall a nice wheat beer. Would be good for the summer around the pool. Not stellar."
""
"Pours gold with a hint of amber. Head disappears by the end of the beer with minimal lacing on the glass. Cloudy. Aroma and the description on the can set expectations high - wheat smell with citrus and definite sweeter fruit from the pineapple. Taste decent for a wheat but the pineapple is subtle and does little to enhance the citrus flavors. I respect the subtle fruit but at the same time left me wishing for more."
""
""
"As for the beer. Eh. So so. I never seem to enjoy trying many wheat beers it seems. This one is hearty, but kind of oddly earthy in a way. There seems to be some vegetal thing in on the mix here, which is somewhat different. And this touch of odd smoky kind of thing. I don't know what that's about, but I want to say it has something to do with pineapple. Overall, it is pretty drinkable, but there is something about it that seems muted. I think the pineapple are offering some unusual character to this one."
""
"The body was nice, crisp, smooth and dry. Drinkability was very good, knocking off a sixer while enjoying the nice summer weather would be too easy. Overall, a very nice take on the style. A very enjoyable beer that's worth your time if you see it."

"I really like Maui Gold Pineapples. Every time I visit Hawai'i or California, I bring back around 4 of them. Anybody that's had them before, you know why. When I found out that MBC made a wheat ale with Maui Gold, I had to jump on it! I thought this one had a great balance between the Maui Gold and the wheat. Maui Gold is very sweet and has very low acidity to it, so I figured it would be a bit over powering, but they did a good job, not letting that happen. It's a great beer for the hot weather down here, I just wish I didn't have to bring it from Cali or Hawai'i, when I visit."
""
""
""
"Roundly sweet with a strong flavor of toasted banana bread, a Sailor Jerry-ish spiced rum note and a twang of pineapple. It's weird. But I like it. The base is a classic hefeweizen, and really that's what this is – you could be fooled into thinking into it's just an unusually fruity specimen from Bavaria. It's a little bit slick with sugar and gluten but overall quite refreshing, and unlike a lot of wheat beers, it's not overly gassy. It doesn't rank among the world's best weissbiers but it is novel and tasty, if not something I could drink a lot of in one night. Still, it makes for a lovely treat on occasion."
"O: Overall, this is another excellent wheat beer in a can for a hot summer day."
""
""
""
"A pretty darned drinkable example of the style, twisted and a tad mutated for the remote island ethos - for the better, I must declare. This little fruit experiment is cute, as it just adds to an already capable underlying wheat ale."
""
""
"D: for a brew that probably should have been taken off the shelf, this is pretty tasty. definitely worth picking up if you dig the wheat brews."
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden, hazy wheat look. Decent 1+ finger head with minimal lacing and retention. Smell is that of most wheats with a bit more fruit on this one. Taste follows the nose with a very fruity taste and this I attribute to the strong pineapple forward character. Nothing complex, but fairly refreshing. Mouthfeel is more like a juice than a beer. I feel that they went a little overboard on the fruit character, but I wouldn't turn one down. A simple wheat that is a bit of a one trick pony. Not sure I could drink more than one or two of these. A unique twist on a style that was a bit too fruity-"
"O: a very refreshing beer, probably very good to enjoy at the beach!"
"O - An interesting take on the style. I remember when we were in Maui last year my wife picked up a sixer of this and she really enjoyed it. I found myself enjoying this time around, too. Certainly a beer we'd buy again."
"O - This beer is awesome! The pineapple really works well with the wheat ale. Simple concept executed very well."
""
""
""
"M: Medium bodied."
""
"O: I think I had tons more affection for this brew than just about everyone else who has reviewed it so far, and that's totally cool. I dug the fresh fruit and the light body. I could pop a few of these around the pool in the summertime."
""
"Ultimately, I can't say a lot of nice things about this beer. It's a sub-par wheat ale with an excessive amount of dried-out, sticky pineapples thrown in the mix. I wouldn't recommend this. I'm not even sure if I would drink it again."
"Overall: Not bad, but not great either. It's a nice take on the wheat beer, but the pineapple dominates in the long run and loses some of the more subtle flavor profiles."
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque cloudy gold-orange with a huge off-white head. Head has many different size bubbles from mousse to rocky. Aroma is Wheaties in unsweetened pineapple juice plus some sharp clove from the yeast. Taste is flat, a little cardboardy, but goes down easy. The little bit of pineapple in the taste needs some sweetness or maybe just more of the flavor or added carbonation. From the appearance I expected this to be more like a hefeweizen but there is none of the zip of a good hefe. This might be a decent beach beer (especially considering the can) or might be paired with a pineapple burger to effect."

""
""
"Not my thing but not bad. There’s a time and a place for a beer like this. I’d have another while grilling out or toobing down the river."
""
""
"Pours a hazy light yellow orange with a 1 inch foamy white head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. No lacing on this one. Smell is of wheat, spices, yeast, and some pineapple notes. Taste is of wheat, spices, and a pretty good pineapple flavor. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good wheat beer but the pineapple comes across better in the flavor over the smell."
""
""
""
"Overall – I was hoping this would have a little more ripe pineapple taste. It's more of a unripened pineapple flavour going on. It's a good beer that I'm happy I chance to try, but I wouldn't seek it out."
""
""
""
"I enjoyed this. The pineapple character came off as more authentic than artificial to me and I thought that it nicely complimented the wheat flavors in this. This was crisp, flavorful, and easy drinking. I’d be down with checking out more of this in the future. It’s cool to see Maui down in Maryland now."
"O - One of my go-to beers. Far from your average wheat beer."
"D - Very drinkable. A bit too much fruit juice without enough of wheat beer. It is also a bit too thin and watery."
"O- I really like this beer. I do think that it's better on tap as far as smell goes, but it's fine canned. This is one of the best uses of fruit I've ever encountered, especially for a fruit that can be as cloying as pineapple. I was impressed that they managed to make something that smelled like syrupy pineapple juice taste so refreshing and clean. I will definitely be buying this again, especially as cans can be brought to the park."
"O- A complex beer for a wheat and not sweet at all. Really delish and nice."
"M/O: The beer has a nice carbonation and is very refreshing. Not too strong but very balanced considering that some of these beers with fruit can overdo it."
"Mouthfeel is thin and watery, some brackish aftertaste. Won't be back to this one."
"I love this beer. Nothing to hype over, but definitely super delicious IMO."
"I didn't much enjoy the (few) pineapple beers I had had to this point, but I sure did enjoy Mana Wheat. It's as refreshing as a pre-moistened toilette and is a solid example of a style that is so often predictable and underwhelming. While a bit middling, it benefits from the same high-quality craftsmanship that characterizes all Maui Brewing beers."
"Pours a slightly hazy straw color (although more clear than most wheats), with a large foamy white head. The smell is sweet, pineapple, tropical fruit. Feel is light with moderate carbonation. The taste is good enough, very light, there is some hop bitterness at the end, the pineapple taste and a little sweet malts, overall a pretty light beer."
"The pineapples, applied with a deft touch, are refreshing and subtly sweet. Overall, it’s not bad. A decent beer for the pool or golf course."
"Mouthfeel - Feels like juice when you're drinking it. I wish the carbonation stayed with the beer longer. Could use more bite but would make a great summer time pool beer."
"Overall: Nice and refreshing, I enjoyed the use of pineapple. I wouldn't call it great, but I would have another."
"MO- I know this is considered an American wheat ale and as a hefe lover I consider them when tasting the American versions as well. Saying that this one is just average. I do appreciate the use of the local fruits."
"For an ale brewed with pineapple juice it’s not overly sweet or too much pineapple flavor. It’s very subtle if noticeable at all. It’s a bit too thick to be refreshing and the wheat eventually envelops the taste completely."
"Overall: I don't feel like I need to seek this beer out again. I admire the ambition of the brewer (Pineapple wheat ale! Seriously!), but to me this is more of a novelty beverage."
"Pours an almost murky orange yellow color. Decent white head with pretty good retention. Strong banana aroma with some spiciness and a bit of citrus aroma. Banana aroma reminds me of dried banana chips. The pineapple flavor is relegated to the background, this is not an over the top fruity beer, which I appreciate, but actually I would like to see a bit more of the pineapple in this one. The banana flavor actually takes first billing, which is a bit surprising."
"Hmmm, there just isn't much going on in this beer, and the up-front smell and flavor is not pleasant."
"Overall- I really wanted to love this one. I have a weird obsession with all things pineapple. It just didnt follow threw with as much pineapple as I would like to see. It really is a good brew, with great drinkability on a hot day. It just underwelmed me as just another good wheat."
"o: a decent brew, especially for summer.. went down too easy!"
"Tastes just like it smells. However, I like it. It's a slightly phony tasting hybrid ""wheat"" beer that just hit the spot at the time. I slammed it and I enjoyed it."
"I plan to enjoy the rest of the sixer by the pool during a 4th of July party and can't think of much else that would suffice."
"I wonder how different it would be on draught at the brewpub, with a plate of beer-fried brie in front of me..."
"Overall, this beer needs to be taken back to the drawing board. A good idea that just doesn't pan out."
"Fruit beer category."
"Each sip is smooth and slightly sweet with a husky mineral note in the finish. The wheat is mellow, which allows the sweet & tart acidity of the pineapple to flash across the palate mid-sip. Mouthfeel is superb: creamy-smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. The thin body is amazingly drinkable on a hot Texas day without feeling overly watery. Overall, a tasty wheat from Maui Brewing Company...definitely glad I have another five cans!"
"Poured into a pint glass slightly washed to prevent head formation but this beer had so much malt and yeast I epically failed. With the immediate crack of the can you get a wiff of pineapple. Very nice. The smell up close is pineapple and a hint of grain. Really good smell. I really like pineapple so I was excited for the taste. The taste is pineapple and more pineapple with a finish of a high end wheat beer. I was really surprised with this beer. I was thinking of a wheat beer with a hint of pineapple but this was the opposite. For 2 bucks this was an amazing experience. The mouthfeel was not bad. It was not too dry and the flavor was not stuck in my mouth for that long. Overall I gave this a good rating due to the fact that this was a random find and have had no hype provided to me from friends. I would buy one can again if I was in the mood for a very and I mean very sweet beer."
"Overall: Not for me but if you love fruit in your beer than this is definately for you."
"O - This would be an okay beer for sitting poolside but it just wasn't really my thing. I'd like it better if the pineapple was integrated a bit better and not just taste like a can of juice was poured in. Not too bad, not too great; average."
"Overall, an interesting beer that might find a home with the masses but it's too sweet for me and too one dimensional. Accent great; lead not so much. Avail here in TX. Glad to try it as I've heard good things about Maui but one is enough for me. [N;O]"
"O - Overall pretty meh. The artificial tasting pineapple juice gets old quick and is pretty distracting. I'd be really unhappy if I had another 5 of these to finish. I think this might be really good in a smoothie, if you're into drinking smoothies."
"Many thanks to woodychandler for yet another canned beer for me to try. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a cloudy golden color with lots of head rushing to the top of my glass. Smell is of pineapple, a bit on the sweet side. Taste is not sweet, pineapples are present as are some wheat and grains. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is worth seeking out. This is the 4th beer I have tried from Maui brewing and all have been of superior quality. We need to get them distributed here in PA."
"I don't know what everyone else was drinking. But this beer tastes like vomit, and smells like it too. The malt and hop aroma that may be there are masked by a pungent aroma of puked pineapple. The head was great and the beer looked stellar. But every time I brought the beer close to my face I triggered my gag reflex. This beer could possibly drive me back to watered down lager style beers. They never let you down like this."
"D/O: This filtered wheat beer is fairly accomplished, refreshing the palate while generating interest. It is quite dissimilar to most other wheat beers, in appearance as well as other qualities. It presents itself more like an adventurous blond ale than anything traditionally associated with wheat."
"Great beer for a hot summer day out on the BBQ"
"The Crack & Glug netted two rocky fingers of eggshell-white head with decent retention. Color was a slightly hazy orangish-amber. Nose was redolent with pineapple, Woody typed dolefully. A Tom Swifty pun, in case you may have glossed over it. I postulated recently that a cherry beer with Easter ham would be good, but this would go equally well. Or with a Hawaiian pizza! I am all of a sudden hungry as hell! It may have something to do with that bowl of Maui Pineapple Gold earlier ... Mouthfeel had a real Twang! to it, like having the dentist grab your tongue with pliers and hit it with a hammer. Eye-opening! It was both sweet and spicy at once and if I ever see somebody adding fruit to this, I will take their beer from them. This was smooth as heck and the lacing was pretty as the beer simply seemed to evaporate from my glass. I got a taste like pineapple and black pepper on the tongue, to be a bit more specific, BTW. The finish, however, was all pineapple. Sorry, Leinie's Sunset Wheat, but you just got ejected from the cooler! This would be phenomenal at any time, including 01 Febrewary (Hula in the Coola Day), but especially at the beach. The honey-honeys doing the grass skirt number, me opening CANs as quickly as possible, surfers hitting the tasty waves. Bro, it's ON!"
"Interesting concept to make a exotic wheat wit hybrid with tropical flare, I think they went a bit too overboard with the spice and yeast and much of the fruit flavor was lost, resulting in a really soapy finish. Was expecting more from this."
"The CPJ"
"Overall, a drinkable wheat beer that has a couple flaws, case in point: a seeming lack of integration between the flavors, and an awkward finish. Imagine drinking a sweet, tasty wheat beer that finishes like a Pilsner Urquell. Some people may like that; I don’t. However, it’s decent enough to warrant another try, if not at least to appreciate what the brewery is trying to do here, namely, produce a tropically exotic pale wheat ale."
"Final thought - For $11.99 this is not worth a six. If you can find this in a single can, give it a try"
"O: Well, interesting take on the AWPA, but not really up my alley. The yeast overwhelms the novelty ingredient of the beer. Likely would have been better off in a lower wheat proportionate grain bill, lower SRM and body."
"When I opened and poured this I wanted to dislike it, but the first sip was like a slap on the face and a firm demand to pull oneself together. As I say, probably not a session beer, but if you like wheat beers or anything with a bit of tartness to it, do yourself a favor and give this a try."
"Overall: I thought this was going to be much more interesting than it turned out to be; should be popular with the masses"
"Poured from a 12 oz can dated 9/03/10 into my Singha little beer glass. Lightly hazy light amber/orange colored body and about a finger + of big bubbled fizzy head. Head holds for about 2 minutes or so, lacing slips from the glass as you drink, no sticking. Smells of American wheat beer (kinda corn tortilla-ish), canned pineapple along with the metallic can lining, a little flowery sweetness. Very pleasant nose. Medium light body on the tongue. The pineapple definitely comes through. Some of that wheaty goodness. Light hop bitterness on the finish. Is dry, despite the slightly sweet nose. Prickly nice carbonation. Great hot weather beer. Love."
"Great beer!"
"Wasn't really a fan of this brew -- I thought the wheat/malt aspects weren't quite bold enough and as a consequence the pineapple just tasted watered-down as opposed to providing flavor enhancement."
"Overall: Had a few of these on a hot BBQ day and I remember liking it much better than when I sat down for this after dinner beer review. I like the unusual take on this Wheat ale and will drink this again, but not as great as I once thought it was. Might have overrated it while I was in the moment."
"interesting beer, just not for me."
"Drink- A small tasty little beer in a can. Good with clean flavors and quite refreshing."
"D- I liked this, and this is the first wheat beer I have drank in a while that I would honestly say I would buy again. It also looks like I was lucky to find this in winter at bevmo in huntington beach. I wish I could find another 6 pack and save for the summer. Good job Maui Brewing co hats off!"
"Bottom line, I could drink this refreshing brew as a castaway. But as I write this review, I'm reminded that the price, at least for a Coloradon, could really only be afforded by Thurston Howell III. However, I would gladly pay it!!!"
"Drinkability: Very refreshing, especially in Maui, but this really did not seem all that different from other American Wheats. Some reviews mention too much pineapple, others (like mine) mention just the barest touch. Consistency issues? Regardless, it was still quite enjoyable and refreshing."
"D: You can easily drink several of these in one sitting."
"Overall, just a weird beer. I'll try it again on draft and see if I feel the same way."
"Who put pineapple in my hefe??? Ok, so I clearly knew there was gonna be pineapple in this, and that's why I wanted to try it. The pineapple, however, completely overshadows everything else in this beer. Couldn't drink more than one."
"D- Overall this is a decent wheat beer but not quite as good as I had hoped."
"Clouded orange golden body with a nice large bubbled white head, fine lacing spread across the glass. Aroma has a nice citrus flow to it with hints of tart pineapple around the edges. This is a pretty cool concept nice base wheat beer with Maui Gold pineapples. Flavors bring a nice fruity roll between tropical fruit/citrus blend with wheat beer base coming through. Phenolic mildly spiced character works well together. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied even soft carbonation nothing off here. Drinkability overall it's nice to have some pineapple burps rather than the typical hop burp, nice experience works well."
"Overall, very drinkable. Interesting. Due to ABV and refreshing taste you can definitely have a few of these."
"An interesting beer, but the advertised component blew away most of the other attributes which could have made this better."
"Poured a dark yellow into Steinlager glass. The smell of pineapples are definitely there. Taste of a wheat ale with pineapples. Good mouthfeel. It has a refreshing taste to it. Good drinkability. Pineapple juice with a bite!"
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is very interesting. In addition to wheat, I get a lot of smoke. Very odd. The flavor is a mix of smoke, wheat and some citrus fruit - possibly pineapple or mangoes. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"A wheat beer with pineapple, perfect after a long day of surfing!"
"Very nice wheat ale with some interesting flavors. Nice fruitiness, but the medicinal flavor is a bit off-putting at first. Once it dies down a bit, this is good stuff. Overall, very nice."
"Light, refreshing and easy drinking. No overwheliming flavors. A nice wheat ale from the isles. I wish I were there drinking this!"
"D: I was disappointed by this one. Perhaps it's a beer that fairs better being freshly kegged, because it was nothing like what I remember having."
"Beer is light in body and has a clean finish. Its OK, no real pineapple flavor, kind of thin and flat. Its not a great wheat beer, just another novelty."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is thin and light but not watery (an improvement over most of this style). Very drinkable beer that I could easily see a sixer being killed by accident just going one after the other."
"An approachable summer beer - good for a picnic or pool party - but not too impressive on its own."
"Appearance is a nice cloudy orange, clearly unfiltered, just the way I like it. Smells of wheat and pineapple, strong on both and nothing else distinctive. Taste is the same as smell, a nice unfiltered wheat taste with moderate to strong carbonation and a nice pineapple flavor. Very drinkable, and very impressed. I would definitely order this beer again."
"Stopped by at one of my favorite beer stores and discovered they had the new mana wheat in by Maui brewing! Picked up a sixer and went to a friends house to share it with her. It pours a really golden color mixed with a little orange in it. The beer is hazy, but not to dense. The smell was what you would expect from a wheat beer with the little exception of pineapples, yep, pineapples. The taste was yeasty, but the acidity of the pineapples really balanced out the flavor quite well. It was going down nice and smooth on a hot Hawaiian day!!!"
"D: Certainly not difficult to drink, but the smoke on the nose is a negative, and it's not really good enough to want more than one."
"This is one I would pass on. Really not even worth the taste from my point of view."
"D: A solid wheat beer, I liked how the hefe and pineapple came together, but not a beer I'd rush out and by again."
"Would I buy more of it? - if only I could! I'd be stocking up on this and the other Maui cans on a regular basis."
