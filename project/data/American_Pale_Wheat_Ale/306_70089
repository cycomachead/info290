I think ya just need the right stuff at the right time... because I KNEW what to expect from this guy, but the very cold, light, easy-drinking nature while I am hot and sweaty and getting ready for the Kings' Game 3 just tasted pretty darned good. I poured it softly so I wouldn't lose any flavor in the head, and I certainly got the corn-piss-adjunct in it, but it was okay. okay for right now, otherwise i'd be urinating on the bottle just about any other time I would drink it. yeah, I guess I can be a 'snob', but i'm a fair one, no? and as much as I abhor that camel piss swill bud light, they have a pretty decent commercial they're playing during the hockey playoffs....","pkalix","Jun 08, 2014"

I guess it did not help that I drank a Westy 12 before this, but even if I did'nt, this beer is the pits. Taste is exactly like the smell is and like if it could actually get any worse...the taste goes down hill as it warms and ends with a genuine used toilet water taste. I purchased a 12 pack of the collection including Summer, Regular, Farmhouse, and the Agave Blond, and all of them were equally disgusting nasty beer. The color was different between them all, but other than that, all taste nasty. I just can't get past that nasty wet liquid corn taste ... it is repulsive. I am not totally against Coors as Coors light would rank a 5 against this nasty-ass shit.","4thelvofbeer","May 27, 2014"

The aroma is shows citrus, sweetness from the honey and wheat malt. Any hops must be of a citrus type that goes well with the orange peel. The taste starts off with the malt and orange peel notes fading to the sweetness of the honey on the finish. The mouthfeel was average some carbonation, but the beer was thin in body. This actually plays better in hot weather in my opinion for a summer beer. Overll this isn't a great beer, but it is a seriously drinkable summer beer. It's refreshing and in the deep south welcome on a day that is reaching the upper 80's in temps.","Rantingfury","Jun 23, 2012"

Color was a pale lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled like a wheat beer, kind of tangy and underlain by a light oranginess. I was glad that it was not as strong as the lime I had earlier. Mouthfeel was medium with that light wheat flavor that I will always remember from Drink Your Wheaties afternoon at SPTR, accompanied by a light honey sweetness and on the finish, orange zest. The finish was semi-dry and quite pleasant. I would probably enjoy it more on a hot summer day than on Halloweestmas (it snowed here two days before Hallowe'en).","woodychandler","Oct 07, 2011"

Taste is quite a lot sweeter than indicated by the nose... it is filled with all the honey promised by the label but not delivered by the nose. Unfortunately, the flavor is also filled with a sub-chorus of metallic BMC adjunct that wasn't present in the nose!! At least it actually delivered on the promise of honey flavor. The mouthfeel is very soda-like, but also forgettable and bland. Overall I am left with a decidedly average wheat beer with some honey flavor but faint and unpleasantly metallic malts behind it.
