"Great summer beer with high drinkability and reasonable use of the agave.  Balanced and refreshing."
"So being a beer from Blue moon (coors) this one surprised me."
""
""
"This one ranks as my favorite Blue Moon, predominately because I enjoy blonde ales; this one goes alongside Cinnamon Orchata for my favorite offering from the company."

"Purchased this in the summer sampler 12 pack-cans. The store was out of 12 pack cans of Blue Moon -- again, this beer is getting very popular here in NJ. Served in a chilled glass, this beer is a bit too sweet for me, I can taste the agave in this. I would bump up the hop profile on this beer. I like blue agave tequila so this beer works for me, and it's pretty cool a big mass production brewer is trying out craft style beers. This beer pairs well with sweet barbecue ribs or Chinese food. This beer also has to be served very cold or it is like a wine cooler. Coors must have reconfigured their canning/bottling production line, I notice no oxidation in any their beers anymore."

"BBD 8/25/14. Clear light amber (golden) pour with a fair head and lacing. Retention is normal. Light aroma of biscuit and wheat over a slight honey sweetness. Light medium body with a not quite smooth texture. Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is rather nice in a subtle fashion and well balanced. It begins with biscuit then flows into a subtle agave sweetness. The finish is smooth."

"DATE TASTED: February 22, 2014... GLASSWARE: Weihenstaphaner weizen .. OCCASION: final night to cheer on our winter Olympians... APPEARANCE: copper-gold body with uneven effervescence; thin, off-white head presents no immediate thickness; no tracing = not inviting... AROMA: pungent,, malty; tougher to pick out thee agave--comes across more as a candied apple...PALATE: a bit dry; slight, oily mouthfeel--drinkable but indistinguishable...TASTE: tangy, metallic aftertaste; malty, syrupy sweet; some fruity, lemony wheatgrass too; rather bland, however, like an original Blue Moon that got itself confused at the factory... OVERALL: I feared this review--not interested in slamming tonight--and yet the beer did not repulse as its first summer sampling had--only wet my lips and slightly refreshed my thirst...did the delayed rating weaken its taste? ..."

"Poured this into a glass, it has pale orange color body with a small fizzy head. The smell isis of wheat and I get a sweet aroma from the Aguva. The taste has sweet ness to it and I also get some wheat, not much else. The mouthfeel is ok and overall a ok summer beer."

"O: Its always nice to try something new and diverse, however Im not a fan of this beer. I would drink it if it were offered to me, but i wouldn't order it or buy it again, id rather drink a macro brew(pbr,bud,rolling rock etc). I greatly prefer regular Blue Moon. Im sure someone out there loves this beer but that someone isn't me. Its appearance, ability to go down easily, and slightly higher abv are its redeeming qualities. If you want to try this I suggest getting it while you can, I honestly don't see Blue Moon making this one again."
""
""
"O: I didn't like it very much, but I can see what they were trying to do with this one. I appreciate the effort, but I won't drink it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall- This would be really good with food. I could definitely enjoy a couple of these with barbecued meat. The sweetness is overbearing without some salty food to balance it. Still impressed, considering the brewery."

"Blue Moon Agave Nectar Ale ---3/5."
""
""
""
""
""

"Clear deep golden hue with white head. Honestly taste like a full bodied American pale lager with a hint of agave flavoring. Full body, rich cereal grains, finishes clean with a faint lingering agave sweetness. Pretty bland, drinkable. Slightly tart possibly from the agave, gains a little bit of Pucker like flavor as you keep drinking. I was hoping for more agave flavor, if that's what your looking for you'll be severely let down with a mediocre grainy beer."

"Next time I will just drink a coke...same cloyish sweetness. This this thing tastes like a childrens' breakfast cereal. Reminds me of the 'swayt tay' or sweet tea that rural Texans are so fond of."

"I'm a huge fan of Blue Moon for my everyday beer. I was excited when I got a couple of bottles of this in the summer seasonal pack. In fact, they were the first ones opened (one for my husband too). We were both disappointed. This is a combination that just doesn't work. It tastes nothing like any other Blue Moon product, in fact I can't think of any other beer that it tastes like. It's sweet, too sweet, and not even a good tasting sweet. Leaves an awful aftertaste. I love a good tequila now and then, and others have said it's similar. I didn't get that from this beer at all. It was just not an enjoyable drink. It wasn't awful, I did finish the bottle. In fact, my husband didn't like his, so I finished his too. I usually don't mind a beer a little warm. This was NOT good. Much better cold. I wouldn't buy this again and really don't recommend it unless someone is really into sweet beers."

"3.19/5.00"

"Pours a clean deep yellow color with an off white head. In the aroma, a faint light fruitiness. In the taste, a dry fruitiness, almost honey like. A small bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dryer honey like aftertaste. Kind of sticky, very big honey presence, eh..."
"Overall, a nice, cheap, refreshing summer beer"
"It tastes like something your body doesn’t want inside of it. It’s an awful attempt at an awful product and it’s just surprisingly bad, even from Coors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall it was a pretty mediocre beer. It's not something I'll probably pick up again, but it'll do in a pinch. I feel that it is important to note that this is not a flavored version of the standard Blue Moon style beer. This is a completely different beer. The beer doesn't taste bad or anything, but nothing really stands out in this forgettable brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is drinkable but not one that I would really desire to have again - it had some strange artificial flavors as well as metallic notes. The overall beer was rather one dimension with the sweetened graininess."
"Overall- Not as good as a regular Blue Moon it is a decent alternative."
""
""
"Overall - Better than I thought it would be. It's not too cloying and it's fairly refreshing. Not something I would buy/drink again probably, but a beer that was worth a shot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is more like candy than beer, and not just the sweetness. It tastes like the agave syrup from the grocery. Not trace of hops, although there is some medicinal bitterness. If ever a beer was needing some crispness, this is the one. I'd call this a fruit/vegetable beer even if it was brewed from rye. I'm glad I only had a single of this one. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Barons Marketplace in San Diego."
""
""
""
"Interesting that even if it does not taste like tequila (thank you!), you can feel it and connect the agave here to its end product. Worth one try."
""
""
""
"This isn't really anything to write home about. If this were less grainy it would probably do better. If there was a more pronounced wheat presence offering some more husk and straw notes, then the sweetness would be a bit more balanced. As it stands it's a bit bland offering only faint notes of agave which are masked by an intense, sugary sweetness. This was nice to try and tick, but I won't be having it again."
""
"O: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, not the representation of style, there are a lot of other beers in the style that I would pick over this one."
""
""
""
"I bought this for my girlfriend, who ended up disliking it. I didn't mind it so much, as long as I got it down when it was ice cold, the warm version of this is brutal. the pour is a pretty clear golden color for a blue moon, copper hues and a short lived half inch of white bubbles. the agave gives it a sweeter smell, unfermented sugars, with that familiar tequila vibe. malts are bigger than they need to be here, too much caramel in the context of the agave sweetness, its one or the other here, not both. still, its only in the finish that the sweetness hits, and its a malty summery sort of brew beforehand, which when ice cold, really isn't too bad. more carbonation would help, or better carbonation retention, and a slightly lighter body would make it a better hot weather beer. I really didn't mind this one though, I think its creative and reasonably well put together for a blue moon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'd say this is better than a regular BM. Not great, but not horrible."
"Do you like tequila? Do you like beer? Have them both now. Pick your self up a six pack and slam them down. Enjoy it you will thank yourself for it. So the first beer play out as the following ""Hello, how are you today. What you came to party? "" the second beer tells you that you drank the first way too slow and I got friends that want to join in."" We'll so the fourth one comes in and says ""hey I know you yes I told you this was a party."" Well I'm gonna enjoy the other 2 now they asked about you i told them you would join them soon. So don't let them down and pick yourself up some of the Blue Moon seasonal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beats regular Blue Moon, but that is a low bar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I guess I was expecting something more exotic with the word nectar in the title."
"I could barely smell the agave, I smelled more honey than anything else. It's pour is somewhat impressive, but lacks any 'wow' factor, but it does go down smooth, real. Real smooth. That impressed me quite a bit. Overall, it's a decent entry by Blue Moon, just not one of their best."
""
"Wheat and agave sound like an interesting combination, but the mixture is only semi- effective with this beer. It’s an okay beer that most will find decent enough to drink, but there are many others I would rather have in my pint glass during a hot summer afternoon."

"Taste is, as expected, malty and sweet. The agave nectar imbibes a honey-like sweetness that I can't get past. To it's credit, it drinks smoothly, but there's a distinct lack of complexity and a one-dimensionality that kills this one for me. Average at best."
""
""
"This beer is not one that I will buy again. I gave it a shot despite bad reviews because I like the other Blue Moon beers. I won't make that mistake again! It did not have a very distinct taste. Seemed to have too much going on. The only positive is that it did seem to improve towards the end."
""
""
""
""
"The taste was average at best. It left a bit of a slick feel in the mouth which was a little disconcerting. Overall this was an average beer at best. I am comparing it to other agave wheats that I have tried and it doesn't come close to stacking up."
""
""
""
""
"I am not seeing what the appeal is here, this hardly tastes like beer, it's more of a sugary almost malt beverage sensation, and I am not finding this really appealing at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweet biscuit scent. Pours honey yellow with large white head. Head quickly faded to a thin non-lacing film. Taste is not what I anticipated. I connect agave to Tequila and expected something like Budweisers' Tequiza. This is more of a cloying coriander and sour spice ale. Not a drain pour but nothing to buy again."
"Looks like i am going to have to give this a slightly better than average rating...3.25"
""
"O - A very refreshing beer. Would be enjoyable on a hot summer day in a pool. Would drink it again, but probably not one I'll pick up often."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste-Cucumber, faint wheat. The agave seem to work against the other flavors, lending an oily sweetish mouthfeel that seem out of place. Hats off to Blue Moon for trying to add to their flagship, but this one doesn't do it for me."
""
""
"Overall it was decent and reminded me of Amigos Tequila flavored beer, however it wasn't as strong on the alcohol side as the Amigos is. It was an alright Blue Moon beer not a favorite however pretty good."
""
""
"O- I was hesitant to try this beer for a couple of reasons. I have found Blue Moon beers to be either good, or, 'Not so good', and because of the Agave, I can't STAND Tequila!! That said, the best part of this beer is the 'aftertaste'..I know it sounds odd, but I like the lightly sweet finish with just a 'hint' of salt...Maybe it's just me, but I believe I'll drink this again."
""
""
"O - a pretty average summer beer with nothing much to write home about, but a fairly okay beer. Nothing really special about this beer and with all the other great light to medium beers out there with true sweetness such as the hefeweizens and Dundees honey brown lager, why settle for this unless you got it on-sale like I did at your local grocer or package store"
""
""
"o: I really enjoyed this beer. It was a very well balanced beer and remained true to the common American Ale style. I would certainly buy this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"pours golden in color minimal head and lace is the best i can say about that. smell is a little better with a soft sweet veggie or really ripe fruit note. taste is slightly sweet some wheat and agave and mouthfeel very smooth light to medium but what hurt this beer most poor carbonation a little stronger would have made all the difference for me, i might buy again as a change of pace but it's not on my top list."
""
"Crisp mouth, refreshing, easy drinking. Each sip of this gets sweeter and sweeter. I'm guessing that's agave I'm tasting? Sweet apples, mild citrus, faint spice. This is an odd one. A sweet fruity beer, that I would pass on in the future. Too artificial. Pass."
"A nice little light sweet pale wheat ale. Sweetness was not overdone. Poured a nice golden color wit h some fliffly white head. Smell was faint with no hop prezence what so ever. Decent little summery beer and I would drink this over the belgian wit anyday."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is so average. They tried to do something with a wheat ale that neither succeeded nor failed. Bland."

""
""
""
""
"Solid beer, good taste, slightly sweet. Dark gold color, formed a decent head that disappeared quickly. Can taste the agave in it; sweet, but not too sweet. Slight carbonation, bubbles visible. Would buy again. Now interested in how agave would taste in other beers."
""
""
""
" The flavor is okay, but it does seem a little on the sweet side. it has a mild agave nectar flavor which is basically an earthiness in the taste under the wheat malt flavor. Overall this is an okay beer, not great but I didn't have high expectations considering it was a Blue Moon."
""
""
""

"RJT"
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a 1/2"" white head that quickly fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light pale and wheat malt scent along with a refreshing agave aroma. The taste is average. It has a light, almost watery flavor that has a hint of wheat and agave. It's the kind of drink you'd like to have on a hot day, but that's it. It only faintly resembles a wheat ale. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a forgettable wheat ale that's watery and covered up with agave nectar."
""
"Overall – A bit on the sweeter side but not bad as the honey and wheat go nicely together. Well worth a try for its modest price."
""
""
"Certainly not the worst from the Blue Moon line. Still very much forgettable."
"Overall, its beer but not a great one."
""
""
""
""
"A pretty good beer for the style. Great for the summer."
"High D+"
"Not bad, pretty decent ale. Interesting flavor, I would say this is worth a try if you go into it with an open mind."
""
""
""
"Agave and wheat don't seem to go well, at least not in this ale. It's so bad, that you might as well just drink Coors."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some sweet aromas. Taste is much the same with sugary, grain flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is drinkable but is very one dimensional with sweet grain aromas and flavors."
""
"I will add though, that a few of these brought me to quite a delightful drunk!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ultra-fresh, but perhaps too early as it is still quite cool for Spring. No shade needed as I began my pour, resulting in two dense fingers of bone-white head with great retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Across the room, I saw Midas and Croesus rubbing their hands together but this was all mine. Nose had more of a lager-like honey sweetness along with a lime-like citrusiness. Interesting. Mouthfeel was medium with a very honey-wheat sweet flavor on the tongue. I was reminded of my late Pops' traditional breakfast of Wheaties in drinking this. I think that I will recommend a change since ""Fruit/Vegetable Beer"" is supposed to go away anyway. Finish was pleasantly dry and refreshing and I could easily see quaffing a few of these during the summer."
"O: Too sweet for me. I'm not snooty about weird ingredients in my beers, but this was a miss."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Descent..but a plain Blue Moon Whitbeer would be better..."
"Overall - Not much to this brew; I think it's ambition is greater than the end result. Drinks closer to an adjunct lager than a pale wheat ale. I wouldn't buy this again, but I'd accept if offered."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Blue moon failed me on this one. I didn't hate it but I usually am very pleased with almost all varieties. I bought this in the variety pack and tried it with optimism. Not pleased. typical flat ale on smell, flat on taste and the overall feel was....I was left unsure on all of it. left me wondering what happened with this one"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Okay, I'm not liking this one at all. I struggled to take 4 sips and now, the struggle is ending. A drain pour for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A below average beer overall. Not a hint of blond ale in it. It's really just an agave booze drink."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very sweet, malty. Taste is also sweet, wheat, some citrus, a touch of agave, a bit of an unusual flavor.Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Honestly, if this was not brewed by Coors, it would be rated much higher. Is it great? No. But it is definitely a drinkable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A decent lawnmower summer beer that one doesn't have to think about, there is enough balance there to keep the playing field even and not be too sweet, dry, or bitter. I'm not quite sure about the agave's real influence, though there is a fruity, sweet aspect to the beer I presume is it."
""
""
""
"D- Refreshing, but not great."
""
"Brilliant clear golden body with a massive white head, forms a thick band of lacing with each sip. Not bad smelling initially some biscuit malts, sharp wheat, and earthy quality. Pretty muted at first, but after a few sips and I let it warm there's the agave nectar, slightly syrupy notes arising. Flavor has more cereal grain, sharp wheat notes, and lingering sweetness that comes off as a simple syrup. I can see how this stuff could get fermented into Tequila, sharp sweet character from the agave additions. I'm not sure that it helps the flavor any. It's actually tooth numbingly sweet, and it doesn't help the overall beer any. I could definitely pass on this the next time, bad idea. I could see that if it was inspired by trips across Mexico. Mouthfeel is pretty cloying the sweetness is just too much ferment and distill this out into a new hybrid Tequila before drinking it. Light to medium boy linger residual sugars are the part I'm having a hard time with, carbonation no complaints in that department. Overall, hard to consume just not an enjoyable flavor profile, that's as constructive as I can be."
""
""
""
"Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""

"O - This is okay. The agave brought too much sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""

"Atmosphere is really solid. Really nice head, and plenty of lacing. Nose is wheaty and sweet, but very light and subtle. Nicely balanced. Flavor is light and pretty sweet with a steely finish. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
""
"Gotta give it up to the Blue Moon crew within Coors for continuing to trot out the new and different recipes in their seasonal packs this year. This one pours a clear brass topped by a half-finger of white foam. The nose comprises light artificial lime (I'm gonna assume this is from the agave nectar), corn syrup, and a touch of what certainly seems like dry wheat. The taste holds notes of sweet and artificial lemon-lime (think almost Sprite-style) drizzled over peppery wheat. However that may sound to you, it tastes a lot better than I would expect. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda syrupy feel. Overall, this concoction turned out to be much less objectionable than I imagined, but it still fails to ""pop", to elicit much love. At least it's not out-and-out bad, though..."
