Flavor itself is very delicate and mild, almost light lager in mouthfeel with how thin it is. Floral and almost lightly purfumey flavors, watered down fruit punch at the end with a high carbonic bite. Hides its 5.4% ABV very well as it tastes like a light beer, in nose, flavor and mouthfeel.

It poured a nice golden yellow with a decent head that held for a few minutes. It had faint smells of passion fruit and citrus, so I was really excited. It tasted like someone squirted an unripe passion fruit into a can of PBR. Such a let down. The passion fruit taste faded quickly. Very carbonated, so it probably masked some unappealing tastes, even when it warmed up in the glass. I would not buy again, and luckily my wife has some coworkers over that will probably finish off the rest of my 6-pack.","beepill","Jun 26, 2013"

The nose comprises successive blasts of dry, funky wheat, with only a mild twinge of papaya (well, I guess it's really passion fruit, but it seems like papaya to me...maybe mango...you get the point) on the sea floor. Given some time to breathe, though, the fruit comes through stronger, sharper. The taste is basically a low-budget rehash of the smell, with the wheat replaced by straight barley-like grain and the fruit with an analogous powder, not unlike a tropical Kool-Aid mix. Suffice it to say, this direct-to-video remake is hardly a replacement for the original, which, in and of itself, wasn't exactly a classic. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, I applaud the general idea behind this beer, but the execution leaves quite a bit to be desired.","TMoney2591","May 12, 2013"

This one falls into that category. I was unimpressed by the look or aroma, but the taste is pretty good. Kona does a good job here of giving it a touch of fruit flavor without making it cloyingly sweet or artificial. I could definitely enjoy a few of these on a hot day. If you are looking for a light, refreshing, beach beer with good flavor then consider trying this one.","NoLeafClover44","Aug 06, 2012"

Smell is a bit on the pineapple side, a bit too much. Similar to the Maui wheat beer, but more pineapple. Taste follows that pineapple character and it's a bit distracting from the wheat style. Would almost consider this a pineapple bomb! Too sweet and fruit forward. A good amount of carbonation, but has that juice feel and a bit acidic. Overall- A bit on the gimmick side of things. Feel they tried too hard for the Hawaii pineapple thing and made a fruit beer and not a wheat. Not going to run out and get another-","TheDinger","Apr 01, 2012"

Refreshing on a hot Hawaiian day im betting, very easy drinking, enough so for the female non-beer drinkers to indulge in. Listed as an American pale wheat, but is more suited as a fruit/herb beer if you expect a wheat beer by style. Light and refreshing for the beach setting, fruity, and one that is a nice break from beer to keep things light with a soft beach breeze. Not a bad flavor if you like passion fruit, but not really close to a wheat beer if being picky and rating by style. Still worth a sip in the right setting. sure as hell beats the hell out of a corona on the beach.","beerthulhu","Jan 03, 2012"

I am not against adding a spritz of lemon into a wheat beer, but I would rather do that myself and not have the brewer do it for me. So I must qualify my low rating.

The use of passion fruit is obvious in the aroma, although there is also a not entirely pleasant dull mossyness and a bit of a metallic character present. The flavor is a light, earthy combination of wheat and yeast, and the tropical fruitiness from the aroma is more muted, being replaced by more of a lemony citrus character. The texture is light without being thin, but the fine, prickly carbonation gets in the way of the light, subtle flavors. Overall, this beer is light and a bit fruity, and although the use of passion fruit is a bit of a novelty, it is otherwise fine and drinkable albeit uneven.","devilben02","Jul 07, 2011"

For truly fruity wheat beers I think it is the most enjoyable with that amount of fruitiness. The smell is fruity. It is probably better to drink cold from a bottle so the fruit stays "down". The top of the beer has a bit too hot (intense) of a fruityness. After that it mellows out nicely and is pretty drinkable. I had it on tap and it was much better as the fruit aromas had dissipated a bit. In the bottle, it's nice after a heavier stronger beer and kind of realigns the palate and refreshes. I had it after the Gubna. Anyhow, tap is certainly preferred, but it is of mention that one girl in our party preferred it over her newfound favorite, Sol, and probably one of the best lagers available, Blue Point Toasted, and anything else she tried which was technically a better beer. She said the sweetness was just right.

You can tell there's some kind of 'exotic fruitiness' going on but then you feel like you're sipping straight soda water.

Smell starts out horribly. I dunno what is going on here but it smells of a pasture with fresh manure in the air. This dies down a bit but lingers in the background the whole time. It becomes hugely malty/grainy with some citrus fruit and slight manure in the background, strange. The taste, fortunately, does not have the manure notes to it. Basically just a hugely wheaty/malty backbone with some citrus fruit notes in the foreground. No hops really noticeable here at all. The fruit is nice but tastes a bit artificial for some reason. Mouthfeel is light bodied but has nice creaminess. Medium carbonation suits this beer well and there is no alcohol present. Low bitters hit the tongue in the end behind a coat of malt and fruit. Drinkability is good. The beer was cheap and had a decent taste. No real off flavors but an off aroma for sure.

The smell certainly revealed the passion fruit within, with some biscuit and lemon as well; a rare but enticing mix. (On the record, I hate fruit beers, but the smell of this one was intriguing.) The taste was a nice balance of biscuit and lemon, a subtle passion fruit/mango undertone throughout, until the finish, where a more intense passion fruitiness punctuated the dryness. I was pleasantly surprised. The mouthfeel was a little on the thin side, but nicely balanced with a not-that-abundant amount of carbonation...at least not as abundant as I was led to believe from the appearance.

Has a nice fruity aroma to it and has a nice body for a pale wheat ale. Brewed with passion fruit, which I've never tasted before but you can definitely taste some good, subtle fruit flavor in the beer (which I'm guessing is what passion fruit tastes like). Nice and drinkable with a clean finish.

Doesn't taste near as fruity as it smells - the after taste is a little like watered down fruit juice. Doesn't really taste a lot like beer - more like juice and ginger ale.

That said, the beer grew on me a bit and has a nice look. The nose is slightly stale wheat, pale malt and passion fruit. The taste is similar. The pale malt gets entirely drowned out by sweet passion fruit. It tastes more like passion fruit syrup. I'm not commenting on the actual brewing ingredients, just the flavor. The wheat is too mild and lacks the spice of truly good wheat beers. I'm not a big fan of Kona. Sometimes, they tread a fine line between gimmicky and experimental, and this beer ends up gimmicky, in my opinion. The whole thing is just so sweet that I can feel my teeth getting sore.

The pommegranite flavor comes through nicely above the malts, esters, and phenolics; but below the timid hops. Textures are creamy for an American wheat, but thin considerably in the end for the fruits to shine and make the beer easy to drink. Finishes with part esters and pommegranites.

3.62,8.4,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Easily worth a try, and very easy to enjoy. Although a beer like this would seem highly drinkable, I'm not sure I'd want more than one per sitting. Unless you're a fruit-beer fanatic, the flavor tends to seem like a novelty by the time you finish. A tasty, refreshing novelty, no doubt, but it didn't leave me wanting another or anticipating my next meeting with it.","Metalmonk","May 13, 2008"

3.55,6.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"I was excited when my husband brought this beer home, as I love wheat ales and passion fruit. Also Kona Brewing has an excellent graphic designer and I am powerless to resist such delicious advertising. This beer had a warm golden color in the glass with a sweet passion fruit scent. The flavor is comparable to other American pale wheat ales, but with a slight passion fruit flavor that is not overwhelming at all. My husband loved it and I found it very pleasant. While this beer may not blow your socks off, it's a nice refreshing change from other wheat ales. It's a good summer beach drink.","jenbys2001","May 05, 2008"
4.02,20.4,4,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,"I seem to be reviewing a lot of wheat beers lately. 'Tis the season I guess. The passion fruit smells awesome and gives the beer a great aroma, melding well with the slight hop aroma. The fruity taste is good at first, but sort of becomes sour, perhaps too much passion fruit. But hey, one can never have too much passion.","BrewmasterNPB","May 04, 2008"
3.75,12.3,3.5,3.5,4,3,4,"Anyways, onto the beer. I thought the head was nicely layered and it lasted the whole beer. Sure, it died out a little, but all in all it was pretty good. The taste and the smell both had a hint of Lilikoi, but nothing too strong to throw off the balance. I thought it was nicely placed in this one, which could be hard to do, as in adding a sweet juice such as the Lilikoi. I will definately be drinking this bad boy on the newly purchased boat and while chillin' in my hammock. Good times my friend, good times.","JISurfer","May 04, 2008"
3.55,6.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Had this on a recent return trip to Kauai...Poured a light amber color. As mentioned before, two-finger head that dissipated fairly quickly. The smell was mostly passion-fruit. The taste was more of the same. There was not much of the "wheat ale" in the flavor (which I have to admit, I am not much of an American wheat fan). The mouthfeel was average, not too long lasting, but where this beer was above average was the drinkability. On our trip, we did daily hikes of several miles, and when stopping for lunch, this beer really hit the spot in 85 degree, full sun days. To me, the mild passion-fruit taste was something that was refreshing after a hot day in the sun. More enjoyable than I anticipated.","ryanocerus","May 01, 2008"
3.28,-1.8,3,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Pours a very clear light golden color (borderline yellow). Very little head and no retention or lacing. Smell was not my favorite, it smelled of "passion fruit" for sure but it was a little too much. I thought it smelled like a grapefruit. The taste wasnt bad, I have to say I really kind of like it. The basic taste was a of a wheat beer, which I am fond of, but the fruit flavoring gave it a unique kick. Some grassy/grain taste to it, some fruit, some grapefruit, and a touch of bitterness but not from hops, more of a citrus bitterness. Light and crisp, carbonation seemed right on. Overall not bad, I dont know if I'll revisit any time soon but it was a nice departure from a typical wheat beer.","bunnyhustle","Apr 24, 2008"
3.38,1.2,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"The taste is salty and of passionfruit. It maltiness shows through after the initial passion of the fruit pops your taste buds in the mouth. In the mouth you are left with a little bitterness on the tongue. It is a moderately carbonated and thin. Not a bad beer one my wife would really like.","cswhitehorse","Apr 19, 2008"
3.35,0.3,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"M/D: Light bodied, carbonation is fine, kind of slick. OK drinkability. Nothing great, but not horrible either. The passion fruit just over shadows most any other flavor, added to that it gives in a very grapey character.","NCSUdo","Apr 18, 2008"
3.12,-6.6,3,3.5,3,3,3,"Pours a hazy yellow with little head and spotty lacing. Smell: passion fruit, wheat, possibly some other "tropical fruits." Taste: wheat, salty crackers, passionfruit juice, citrus rind. Lingering taste of tropical fruit juice and crackers. Mouthfeel: light bodied with subdued carbonation. Interesting, but my first impulse is that I need a glass of water because that was really salty.","babaracas","Apr 09, 2008"

2.9,-13.2,3,3,3,2,3,"American wheats are some of my favorite beers, while passionfruit is easily one of my favorite fruits. Even so, this was a slight bit disappointing, but not terrible. Poured a light gold with a nice head in a weizen glass. Smell of passionfruit was light, but noticeable, along with a touch of wheat after a while. Very unique taste, with hints of passionfruit throughout, and definitely in the aftertaste. My bottle's body was almost creamy, and less carbonated than I prefer, keeping it from being as crisp and refreshing as I like in the style. The passionfruit flavor gives the beer a slightly odd musty, tartness that I didn't think meshed really well together also. Overall, I'm glad I got to try it, but won't be rushing to get a 6 pack before it's not available anymore.","JDV","Feb 21, 2008"

Pours a golden yellow color with a small white head that quickly turns into a thin lacing. The aroma is some malt with just a faint hint of passion fruit. The taste is much like the nose with some malt and some fruit flavors with some hints of wheat. Overall, this is a decent beer that I will not likely purchase again in the future. The American Pale Wheat category is one of my least favorites to begin with, and this one is in the middle of the pack in that category.","cjgator3","Aug 30, 2007"
