Aroma is wheat, butter, lemon & orange. Taste is thin lemon, orange, mildly wheat bready, a hint of floral/herbal hops with a tiny bit of pepper & bitterness in the finish. Aftertaste is citric & slightly bitter. Mouthfeel is light bodied with with moderate carbonation, crisp but not clean leaving a phenolic presence on the tongue.","mothmanscott","Feb 28, 2015"

The rich looking head quickly dissipated leaving an intriguing lacing pattern until about half way down the glass. The body is the most noticeable trait thus far. Unlike most "summer" brews there is a lack of the crisp & citrus character so ubiquitous this time of year. That should not be misconstrued as something bad, it can, when all is said & done, be a distinction...as long as it has a purpose...& in this case it seems to. Anchor Steam, in my mind, has always had a character that I can best be describe as "a fistful of flavor". The heartiness of which is not lost in this venture to the lighter, brighter side. As a New Yorker whose summers are a series of intermittent hot days inter-dispersed with VERY hot days, this would be great on the merely hot days. Synchronize with a mid-Californian moderate clime. Bottom line is grab some, if it's warm, but spare it, if it's HOT & humid, but, if you like robust beer, no matter what, keep it on the list. Now on to the bottled effort. The head was nowhere to be seen but the lacing showed up. virtually other aspects corresponded.","seedyone","Aug 07, 2014"

3.68,8.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 4/1/2014. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy bright gold color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Slight grassy/earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast flavors; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a nice pale wheat ale. Good robustness and balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 16, 2014"

3.6,6.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.75,"I guess you could say that a lot of American craft breweries muck up their pale wheat ales with fruit peels, chalky spices, and a big musty yeast; this is a minimalist wheat ale, at its finest. It doesn't really hold up, on its own, but I don't think the brewer's at Anchor care too much about that kind of opinion. It could only possibly be American in style, as it seems they're giving Germany and Belgium a great big middle finger from way, way, way across the pond. Nevertheless, it's not going to knock your socks off. But, if you like a summer beer sixer that you don't want to stop and think about too much, this is right as rain for you.","thecheapies","May 12, 2014"

The beer itself is very refreshing and flavorful and is a nice surprise to me. There is definitely a nice mix of wheat and barley malts which provide a smooth, slightly sweet character to the beer. The yeast does a nice job of complementing the malts by providing a great fruity aroma and flavor enhancement. I'll have to keep this one in mind for the upcoming hot summer days...","beergoot","Jan 07, 2014"

3.74,10.3,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Although American pale wheat ales do not represent my favorite beer style, I am a fan of Anchor and this one was hard to pass up on when I spied it on a pick six craft beer wall. Pours up nicely, a mountain of off-white thick foam on top of a golden yellow base, beer does look a bit like darkish honey (or less pleasantly, concentrated urine. But hey). Very clean spicy wheat and "old world" earthy/leafy hop aroma, brisk and assertive. Carbonation was right where it should be for the style, moderate to quite fizzy, and I was struck by the smoothness on the palate, almost creamy. Palate features very pleasant lemon-lime, apricot, and green apple characters than are subtle enough but add complexity. Nice smooth bitterness with white pepper-type spice notes in the finish. This beer includes the underutilized Glacier hop and perhaps this is the source of the fruity character along with the wheat malt. Minimal pine flavor, the hops are more grassy, earthy and refined. Dry and crisp overall with some sour fruit character and the unvarnished clean flavors remind me a bit of a good pilsener. I am perplexed by the mediocre ratings this beer garners on this website. Perhaps people were looking for more aggressive flavors. It is not supposed to taste like a hefeweizen or a wheat IPA. I think this brew is right where it needs to be in terms of the wheat and hops balance. Refreshing and well-executed.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 29, 2013"

The nose comprises light lemon peel, light wheat, light sweet flowers, and a hint of what may or may not be coriander. The taste brings in more of the same, but ups the lemon to a point where it's the clear star, making for a fruity breeze of a drink. The body is a hefty light, with a moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, a nice little hot-weather quaff, nothing special, but something easily drinkable.","TMoney2591","May 21, 2013"

I think this beer certainly achieves Anchor's goal of making a light, drinkable summer brew, which is why I gave it a solid overall score, even if I'll probably be bored with it by the time I finish the six pack.

A decent amount of carbonation in the middle and then a very fast finish that's slightly drying. Body is very thin, drinkability is Ok, but there's not very much to this beer.

Grainy nose, wheat stalks, pine cone, raw pretzel dough with a light dried earthiness, no distinct fruit scents but there's some dried lemon peels. While on the whole light-bodied, what body is there gets anchored to your tongue and is not apt to show any sign of forward progress. Dry with the expected wheat, grain, oat or hay type of taste and texture, curiously the carbonation makes it a bit more rough in feel than smoothed out. Any citrus element a bit player here.

I'd love if brewers took beers like this and made a lager version of the same recipe. It seems like an interesting comparison with such a light and fairly crisp beer. At any rate, it's drinkable on a hot day and preferable to most BMC lagers, but it's not a huge step up.

Very bready and lager-like, it's hard to believe they use Ale yeast. I'm not a big fan of Anchor and this beer did little to increase their stock with me.

Tastes malty up front with some very slight fruitiness and a bit of bitterness to round things out. Mouth-feel is light to medium-bodied and very drinkable. Anchor is very proud of this brew, and it does have the history to make them feel proud of it, but it does not compare to some of their other standards.","stephens101","Jun 19, 2008"

Smell reminded me of white bread, and for lack of better terms, summer in the farm country. Taste at times was bland, almost macroish. Had hints of table pepper and vanilla, but very minor.

Very clean, almost lager-like yeast character, possibly a hint of pepper or a slight tannic taste from wheat malt. Very faint ale fruitiness in the afteraste and blank hop bitterness balance the flavor well.

The finish is very dry. Overall just an average beer. Might be nice on a hot summer day when you are just lookign for something to wet you mouth, but on 2nd thought there are many better choices. The only redeeming quality, the active appearance due to the high carbonation level, ends up being a detriment when it comes to taste.","beermanbrian","May 11, 2006"

Highly carbonated which created a large, thick head. Aroma here is strong of typical hoppy beer smell, not much is noted of wheat aromas. Taste isn't as dry or "wheaty" as I would expect. However, this beer still seems to work well as a thirst quencher. The middle of a sip is more malty than expected, nice and rounded, some lemon is detected in the finish.

The head retention is fairly good, and although it eventually drops to just a collar, it does leave some very nice lace about the glass. The nose delivers a distinctly wheat-like malt with some hay and a mild background-note of citrus (lemon). It's crisp and invigorating in the mouth with a very fine and somewhat effervescent carbonation that delicately prickles the tongue and then dissappears, letting the beer glide smoothly down the gullet. Perfect for a refreshing summer beer. The flavor reveals much more lemony character than the nose suggests, wrapped in a blanket of soft and dry wheatish malt. A firm bitterness rises and leads into a dry lingering finish where the citrus receives one more quick turn, and then an almost metallic bitterness engulfs the mouth. A light bodied, dry, and refreshing American wheat.","NeroFiddled","Aug 13, 2003"

But it would be better to look for something with a little more character. Overall this is a drinkable beer, possesed of all the attributes which I would look for in a favorite, except that it fails to deliver the most crucial part of the experience, flavor.

I'm not sure they have revived a style, or if the style: "modern American wheat beer" is actually a style?? But, I will say the beer refreshed nicely enough and was certainly light and crisp. It also had the tiniest citrus twang at the tail end and came off as a clean, well made example of what they intended it to be. And, while I've read the reviews saying it did not taste like a German Hefe, and that it was not worth the bother, I must say that while I love German wheat beer, I don't think this is pretending to be one. Further, I'd bet plenty of folk would enjoy this, if not entirely for its simplicity, more than a Hefe. A decent, again, "lawnmower beer" I believe, in fact has its place in American culture, and I think that is what was intended here. I think, it is at the very least......worth the bother.","moulefrite","Jul 24, 2003"

I mean it should be a little bit watery hence the style, but this was just too thin for my preferences. It's oh so too bland, a smidgeon of wheat flavor in the finish is about all there is to enjoy in the flavor department. I must say it's better than a pale lager from the big 3, so there's a plus. There's a certain refreshing quality to it. I might prefer a beer such as this when it's 95 degrees outside.

The wheat was definately present in the aroma, though this was the pure smell of toasted wheat, without any fruit esters. I presume this is a result of the use of an ale yeast. The taste was clean and reserved, though intricate, characterized most strongly by the toastiness of the wheat. Only the slightest hint of hops was necessary to round out the flavor. The total package was light and refeshing without being in the least boring. Exceptionally drinkable, I look forward to imbibing this brew on a hot, midsummer weekend.","Crotor","Apr 11, 2003"

The head eventually settled to a steady 1/4" but only after leaving the glass with a beautiful lace. An unusual "summer beer / wheat beer". Very golden in color, the nose was very feint on my bottle - as was the taste. Clean and light tasting, just too light. Not much mouthfeel and a weak, barely detectable, short-lived bitterness. A good thirst quencher, and a different type of Summer Beer, or an alternative Wheat Beer - however you view this beer, its not mainstream that's for sure. It's not that it's bad, it is a reasonable beer - but it has an identity crisis. To me Summer Beers are hoppier, and Wheat Beers are far more sturdy with citric tones. This is neither, yet purports to be both. I just expected more "taste" from this beer, it's a bit "wimpy" for a Summer Beer.
