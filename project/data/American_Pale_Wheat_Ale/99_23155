2.88,-7.7,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,3,"D: American wheat with Wit-esque riffs – but it doesn’t work. Not blended & melded, but rather angular and constructed. Not proportional and balanced.

3.28,5.1,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Pours a relatively clean amber, small pillowy head with decent retention. Scent is quite off from what most pale wheats typically smell like, the lemon is there, but the backbone screams of poor quality malts (or even adjuncts) and stale hops, very little wheat character. Taste is a little more focused, lacks much malt flavor, a little bit of staleness rescued by some citrus notes. Under carbonated for the style, comes across as medium in body. Not your typical pale wheat, some minor off notes stand out a tad more then they should. Not bad, but not something I need to sample again.","rfgetz","Aug 05, 2011"

3.18,1.9,5,2,3.5,3,3.5,"The Crack & Glug was yet another reminder as to why it is important to deCANt: not only did I get two fluffy fingers of bone-white head, but it looked like summer in a glass. Color was a beautiful sunshine yellow with NE-quality clarity. Couple that with the cloud-like head and you have a summer's day. I am a visual beer guy, I suppose. Nose had a metallic aspect to it. Uh oh. Fortunately, the smell did not translate to the taste. Mouthfeel was on the thin side and the flavor was big on lemon, which were probably the natural flavors alluded to earlier. It was a pretty mellow drink, as wheat beers are wont to be, finishing with a light zestiness, making it quite refreshing. I probably would not want more than one, but if I were accompanied by someone who really likes this sort of thing, it would be in my cooler.","woodychandler","Jun 17, 2011"

One to pound after mowing the lawn, or pound while out at the lake with friends, or not drink at all. I think I know which option I'll go for. I see a few notations of people wanting to call this a witbier, but, come on, let's not be hasty.

Anyway, this one pours a clear pale golden straw topped by a half-finger of white foam. The nose comprises coriander, orange and lemon zests, and a good amount of wheat. The taste runs along a very similar course, but with more wheat and some sharp flowers thrown in. The fruitier notes are decidedly toned down, mere shadows of their nasal selves. The body is quite light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp, clean finish. Overall, an okay brew, but one that really doesn't endear itself to me. As mild as it is, I still can't see myself wanting to drink much more of this. Maybe it's too mild, I dunno.","TMoney2591","Nov 12, 2010"

Lemon peel and coriander stand out bigtime in the aroma with a fresh breadiness. Lemon and coriander with a mild wheat malt tang? Yup, this beer is just a filtered Wit beer with caramel coloring added, it's not really bad it's just misclassified. Light bodied with plenty of carbonation. A pretty run of the mill Wit unless you love lemon flavor because this brew delivers that.","biggred1","Jul 15, 2010"

Light bready and caramel aroma with plenty of lemon zest and spice almost like cinnamon that carries over into the flavor. Taste includes caramel malt like sweetness blended with the seemingly fake lemony flavor and a slight touch of hop bitterness. There is an aftertaste of lemon and spice left lingering in the mouth that doesn't really blend all that well with the caramel like sweetness from the malt. Light feel with a modest level of carbonation. This is another offering that would best be enjoyed after sweating it up in the heat and just drinking without savoring any flavor.

Is there a certain percentage of malt that needs to be used in order to have a product worth being called a ""beer?""When the fine print on a bottle reads ""Beer brewed with natural flavors and colored with caramel"" one has to wonder ""What is this?"" My roots as a brewer tells me that you don't need to add caramel for color when you could have added some crystal malts to get this beverage to the medium gold that it currently is. However, my business side says: ""if I were trying to sell beer to the tasteless masses and go with the current trends (i.e. Bud Lime/Miller Chill) then I would make a fruity watered down beverage like this. But I like beer, and this just doesn't work for me. Saranac, from my perspective, is a company on the brink of becoming a really good brewer.

The smell isn't great but the taste is slightly better than some of the others, particularly that god awful Belgian White in the variety pack. This is still a pretty mediocre beer, very light, very uninteresting, but refreshing with a light mouthfeel and no real aftertaste. If you are looking for hops, you won't find much in this beer.

The tastes starts citrus and ends with the wheat flavor. It is a light, crisp, and refreshing beer with a decent mouthfeel. This is another easy drinker from the summer pack.

Again some may like this but it doesn't sit well with me. Seems to be a cross between a witbier and a traditional summer ale. The feel is fizzy and crisp.

As can be expected the feel is quite refreshing and light but has some real nice flavors. I can imagine that this brew will be quite refreshing during the warmer months.

Swirling lines of active and slow carbonation, consisting of a mixture of both fine and large bubbles. Wheaty, lemon rind and fresh cut lemon flesh aromas. Smells almost like lemonade. Some light spices, maybe coriander, meld with a slightly sweet lemon juice. A faint wheatiness underlies the body and the finish is a mix of soft grassy hops and gently crisp lemonish note which does not last too long. The slightly grassy flavor lingers just a moment longer.

Aroma is light and sweet with caramel and lemony citrus notes mixing with some floral hops. The first sip reveals a lite crisp body with average yet tingly carbonation. Flavor is candy sweet with citrusy orange (coriander) a dominant flavor. The flavor is very mild overall and leaves a sugary sweet finish.
