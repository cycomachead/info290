"A mild, refreshing wheat ale.  A full but delicate flavor makes it better to have early in a meal or just as a refresher during the day.  Refreshing and light."
"Hazy orange, HIGHLY carbonated coming out of the 12 oz bottle but the foam dies off, minimal lacing on the glass. It has a very mild aroma, hints of citrus, honey, coriander which are evident in the taste as well.  The taste is mild, smooth, but the flavor is easily overwhelmed by food.  To me, this is best for refreshment, not to pair with a meal.  Interesting and worth trying as a six pack before going in for a case."

"I love a great wheat beer and this one is a pretty good one overall. It isn’t the greatest I have ever tried but there is enough artisan craftsmanship and good taste to keep me coming back for more."
""
""
""
"Overall: definitely great for summer. It is a great choice if you want a wheat beer similar to Blue Moon but want to switch it up!"
""
"I really enjoy showing this beer to people who like Oberon, which is how it was presented to me as well. I think the flavor components are very similar so it is an easy transition, but to me, this as a slightly sharper flavor, which i tend to enjoy ."

"O: Overall a decent beer and would seek it out and drink again."
"Taste/feel: Also refreshing, with plenty of citrus and grain. Reasonably high carbonation to help with that, yes, I'm using the word again, refreshing flavor/feel. There's a solid amount of orange and orange peel sort of oil/bitterness in this brew, but yet it never becomes overwhelming. Surprised the alcohol is 6.2%, as it feels like an even 5%, but what's an extra percent? Anyway, I'd gladly have another."

"O: This beer is easy to drink but lacks complexity—I didn't get any of the coriander or spices in the taste."

"O. This is a nice wheat ale that has good flavor and balance. This could make a nice session ale in the summer months."

"A spicy witbier with rind-y orange notes and some lingering grassiness from the malts. Boozier and crispier than one would expect, but a decent beer, nonetheless."

"An easy to drink summer beer, but for me it falls behind Oberon in terms of taste and smell."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I think this falls short of the wheat style. I think they tried to find a mix between a wit and Oberon. Lacks a lot of character both of those styles exhibit."

"Arcadia Whitsun Ale ---3/5."
""
""
""
""
"Pours murky orange with a bold head that quickly went away. Scent is faint grains and a little citrus. Sweet malt, honey, and orange with spices. Finishing dry with low to moderate bitterness. Interesting style that is easy to drink. I would try again on a warm day."
"Overall, very thin, dry beer for a 6% abv wheat beer - flavors are not offputing but could use something to distinguish from the graininess."

"Overall quite a strange wheat beer with little wheat taste. If they toned that up a bit I believe it would make for a great Witbier. Still not bad though."

"O-Not too bad, not great to me either. I just can't get past the floaters in the beer."
""
"The body is good, light enough for summer and hot weather but verging on medium with good, level carbonation and a refreshing crispness. The smoothness underneath adds to the enjoyment."
""
""
"Overall - It was a little spicier than I was hoping for but it's still good. Seems more like a witbier in my opinion."
""
""
"This is actually an excellent pale wheat ale, and the fact it's in cans makes me even more ready to pick up another sixer. Perfect fishin' beer."

"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer and I thought that it was a pretty average example of an American Pale Wheat Ale, the heavy honey aspect that makes this beer lack the balance that comes with a good American Pale Wheat Ale. This beer had ok drinkability it went down smooth, but the flavor couldn't hold my attention so one is enough for me. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance, it looked nice and I thought the color was really good looking. What I liked least about this beer was the heavy honey aspect that seemed out of place in this beer. I wouldn't buy this beer again, I would much rather have an Oberon, I would tell someone to drink an Oberon instead of this beer, it's a much better example of the style. This was another underwhelming beer for Arcadia, it seems like they can make some pretty good dark beers but I haven't been impressed with most of their lighter beers. I had this beer side by side with Oberon, and Oberon was pretty much better in every aspect, it is much more fitting to drink on a warm summer afternoon in Michigan. I think I may have liked this better before the recipe change, the honey is too dominant, this beer needs another recipe change and they can start with cutting out a lot of that honey, better luck next time guys."

"12 ounce bottle into weizen glass, bottled 6/14/2011. A bit too old but lets give it a shot. Pours to instant head after a loud release of carbonation upon opening(no gusher though). Eventually turns out to be a hazy and cloudy deep orange color with a dense and fluffy 2-3 finger off white head with great retention that reduces to a thick cap that lingers. Some slight bits of lacing cling to the glass. The yeast seems to have clumped up and is floating around in the glass like bits of ground pepper. Aromas of orange peel, lemon, coriander, light pepper, bread, and not much else. Pretty weak aromas without much complexity; but not offensive. Taste of orange peel, pepper, coriander, wheat, spicy yeast, and breadiness. Some lingering notes of bread, wheat, orange, and spiciness on the finish for a bit. Medium body and carbonation; with a bit of a creamy mouthfeel that drinks very smoothly. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish. Other than the grainy appearance and weak aromas; this was pretty solid stuff. Good balance of flavors and easy drinking."

"This beer pours a hazy golden orangish color. It has about a finger of white head on it. The head doesn't have the best retention, and it leaves behind just a little bit of scattered lace on the glass. The nose has a good amount of wheat and lemony city aromas. There are also some scents of oranges, spice, and a tiny bit of hop presence. The taste pretty much follows the nose. It starts off with some grainy malt and wheat. There are some bright fruit flavors and just a little bit of hop flavor. There is quite a bit of lemony citrus, mostly on the back end. The finish leaves some lingering wheat, spice, and citrus on the palate. This beer has a medium body and decent carbonation. It goes down easy and has a smooth feel to it. It has a refreshing quality to it, and there is some graininess as well. This has decent drinkability. It goes down easy, but it just doesn't stand up to a lot of the witbiers that I've had. I think it is worth a try, but don't expect too much out of it."

"Thanks to the legend woodychandler for yet another canned beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of oranges and spices. Taste is very flavorful, oranges, spices, a bit on the sweet side. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a quality beer."
""
"O: Nothing special, pretty simple wheaty beer not unlike a blue moon."
"O - It's nothing to write home about, but I wasn't really disappointed either. There are better renditions of this style, but it came in a sampler pack with other beers that I know I like. So-so."
""
""
"Overall: Maybe I would like this better on a warm summer day, but I did not really connect with this beer. The flavor is ok, but the mouthfeel is not that good."
""
""
"Pours a hazy, copper color. 5/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of slight honey, sweet malt, slight citrus (orange), and a hint of hop. Fits the style of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight honey, hint of wheat, slight sweet malt, hint of citrus, and a hint of hops. Overall, great appearance, but lacking in aroma and body."

"Overall Impression- Going in for the smell, it started off like it was going to be a killer summer beer! This all changed after the taste... Not enough body and the orange flavor almost never came up... Either way, I'm going to be sticking to my Wheach when I want a great, refreshing brew for the summer. Wouldn't mind trying this one on-tap though."
"This beer is kind of different, it's nice, but nothing special at all. Something is off in the flavors, which really hurts. It's definitely something appropriate for the warmer weather. And I will admit the more I sip, the more I enjoy.. but it's still flawed."
"O: I enjoyed just sipping this during a football game. Pleasant, and a bit of good complexity."
"Overall: The sourness should have been stronger. I didn't really get this beer and I wouldn't have it again."
"The taste of coriander and orange peel is in the foreground, and the taste of beer is in the distant background. The effect was like drinking cold herbal tea in a glass that was unwashed since someone drank beer out of it. When I first poured it into a glass, I had high expectations. It's colorful in a glass. I normally have a high opinion of Arcadia Ales due to Sky High Rye, and I suppose I can give them credit for trying to be experimental with an offering such as Whitsun. I understand they may have wanted to give the center stage to coriander and orange peel, but I would preferred that stage to be shared with some bold hops."
"Overall: Won't become anyone's favorite, but this is a great little easy drinking summer ale with a decent amount of strength and at $8.50 for six 12oz cans its perfect for hiking, boating, or other summer excursions. Solid beer!"
"O- This is a very nice white beer, I think the citrus comes out a bit more than the spices but still having this from a can on a hot day is great."
"Many thanks to GordianKnot for the chance to taste this one- never heard of this beer, but always dig craft in a can! Poured from can into my brooklyn tulip. Pours a murky orange color, crazy thick milky head, nice retention. Smell- Orange juice from concentrate- something like Minute Maid? Some lactose flavors- creamy. Maybe a hint of nutmeg spice. Taste- there is that orange juice concentrate flavor, but it is at the back of the throat. Just a little astringent. On the front of the mouth, it is nice and refreshing, light and airy flavors, it doesn't remind me of any wit I have ever had- I would have expected more citrus, more spice, more coriander, etc. But, there is some individuality going on here that I can really appreciate. Overall, this is a nice beer that I could see drinking on a hot summer day quite often, esp because it is canned."
"O- Not at all what I thought or wanted it to be. I poured it out, not because I couldn't finish it, I just didn't want to. Not refreshing, crisp, flavorful, anything... Sad day"
"It seems light bodied as it goes down so quickly and easily. It definitely dries your tongue out. Just enough carbonation to make it a quick but pleasant drink. My only gripe is that is goes so quickly."
"Nice enough, nothing to write home about."
"Easy to drink and would be a summer staple for me if I could get is regularly in my area."
"The Crack & Glug was music to my ears and as the two fingers of eggshell-white head began to form, the room filled with the scent of orange zest. Drool! The color was a very cloudy orangish-amber. The nose was definitely orange peel/zest, but underlain by the spiciness of the coriander and the unmistakable lightness of ... no, not being, that is unbearable, but instead, wheat. Mouthfeel was slightly thin, which is not unusual in wheat beers and the immediate flavors were of the coriander's spiciness and the zestiness of the orange peel, followed by the sharp tartness of the wheat. This was a beer whose principal ingredients really worked well together and were exactly as advertised. Finish was light, dry, refreshing and perfect for yet another slow summer day. I would absolutely put this in my cooler, certainly during the summer, but also as a nice pick-me-up on Hula in the Coola Day (01 Feb, annually)."
"O: At 6% ABV, it's got some kick but it's not a great beer. However, it's one I'd like to try again."
"Pours a hazed, honey-amber. Many chunks of stuff floating around.. perhaps I poured too hard. Much yeast sludge in bottom of bottle! An off-white head rings up and sticks. The smell is coriander and citrus zest. Taste is a whopping smack of coriander! Seriously, tons of flavor in this brew. I detect some honey. The orange peel comes through afterward, intense as well. Can't help but feel tart & thick, like OJ. A good drinker due to the supposed ingredient generosity. Nice ale."
"Poured from the bottle into my Duvel tulip. Murky brown unfiltered color and a white frothy head due to the awesome glass and aggressive pour. Nose of citrus and spice. Quite tasty and refreshing. Slightly more flavorful than your average wheat based brew. Interesting mouthfeel. On the heavy side of refreshing. Would drink again."
"O: Overall a bit of a lack luster, no real stand out qualities, but still a decent brew. Refreshing out of the can (tasted good floating down the river in a kayak.) A bit higher ABV for style is a plus."
"Beer is light in flavor and light in body, light in color and light in soul. THere is a mild doughiness to this beer but overall an unoffensive but boring beer."
"Medium bodied, pretty soft and smooth on the tongue. Pretty refreshing brew, although a little light on flavor."
"Overall, skip this one."
"Light bodied with little carbonation, this beer has an odd slick consistency. It is definitely very drinkable, but the lack of carbonation allows the flavors to persist on the back of the tongue for far too long."
"This does not measure up to a wheat beer that is marketed for spring/summer consumption. The flavor is somewhat astringent, almost like an average quality homebrew. The label gives this beer too much hype - i.e. honey, corriander, orange peel. Didn't get any of these flavors coming through. I think it should be filtered to showcase the ingredient profile."
"Certainly worth a try."
"A very nice offering from Arcadia. I'm looking forward to drinking this constantly on blistering hot sunny days. Very refreshing. I'm ready for summer."
"I poured this beer into a normal pint glass and looked at the color of it. It seems to be rather clear for a wheat ale. The head was pretty nice and fluffy. The smell was lacking some of the wheat ale elements like clove and soft fruits. I felt that the mouthfeel was about right but still nothing to rave about. The flavor was kind of on the weak side, I was surprised because it's a stronger abv for a beer of this style. Not sure why but I was struggling with this one."
"Drinkability: A crisp and refreshing wheat beer that can almost make me think the warm weather is here to stay. Not sure how available this is even though I am only one state away, but I wouldn't be against having it again."
"D: I always find this style very easy to drink. The flavor is good, light, and simple enough that before you know it you've have a 6 pack. Great for the summer."
"D: Good. Could be a great summer bbq beer. Not sure if I would buy a lot of it, but knocking a few back in an afternoon wouldn't be bad."
"Pours pale amber with no head. Aroma of lemon, bubblegum, and citrus. Flavors of coriander, lemon, spice, and spiced fruit. Light in body with high carbonation that zaps the palate. The spices reign dominant over the other flavors and can irritate after a while."
"Future outlook: Decent, interesting variation, but not something I'd seek out again."
"This (as I seem to recall) is one of Arcadia's masterpieces, and it has stuck around for good reason. Definitely a good end-of-summer beer in my opinion, something that hearkens to fruit beer but dabbles in earthy tones as well. I like it."
"D- This beer was a nice sipper during a warm summer day. I couldn't even begin to tell you how much I enjoyed this beer. Oh well...keep this one coming Arcadia!"
"Decent drinkability - not a chugger, not a sipper. Interesting beer overall - no off flavors, but the carpet doesn't seem to match the drapes."
"Smell is a pleasant bittersweet combination of orange and wheat. Pours a hazy golden with some fizz. The taste is very refreshing American wheat (which I don't usually like) with distinct orange elements and a refreshing hop / coriander aftertaste. Surprisingly full-bodied for a wheat beer (higher ABV than most) but not at all heavy. This is extremely drinkable on a hot summer's day, and, unlike most beers, I don't get tired of the flavors at all."
"Pours medium gold with slight haze. Rather small head forms, with creamy texture and large bubbles interspersed. The head dissipates quickly. Very appealing initial nose: Fresh and fruity with hints of citrus. Modest, rather spotty, lacing forms. Medium body and creamy texture. Hints of coriander and hops, and perhaps some honey and faints notes of bitter orange on the palate. The malt is light-medium-light. Carbonation is average. Thirst quenching. The alcohol is not evident. Somewhat sweet. Light, but persistent and pleasant lingering."
"Overall a light and refreshing beer for a hot day. It was nearing 90 when I consumed it so it fit the bill."
"Pours a hazy, light orange-ish color with a small white head. In the aroma, a touch of coriander, spice and wheat notes. In the taste, orange citrus, spicy, primarily cinnamon. A spicy bite and a medium mouthfeel, with a dry orange juice like aftertaste. Almost feels like OJ poured into a wheat ale, and decent spices that stand out."
"The body is medium light with decent carbonation. It's a little syrupy, but to be expected given the honey additions. I liked it more than I thought I might, but the sweetness is a touch excessive. It starts as exuberance and fades slowly into being overdone."
"D: A great summery brew, one that I will buy again."
"Trying to taste as many MI beers while I am here. Poured from a 12oz into pint glass. Hazy orange copper color. No head or lacing. Not much aroma. Pretty much none. Mild caramel with slight spice. Bit creamy feel. Minimal aftertaste / feel. Not much going on with this beer. Decent but not memorable."
"D- A bit on the heavy side for a good hot summer day beer, but it is a good alternative to the big daddy Oberon."
"Kind of a dark copper tone slightly cloudy with a fast fizzing white head. A decent amount of slurry sediment that pick up easily off the bottom. Nothing seems to be settling in the glass. Only after about five minutes does the cloud reach the bottom of the glass. Smells fruity and spicy guided by an English malt sent. Taste is much the same, very bready. Feels tart and a little bitter. Naot a bad beer. Cheers."
"I like this beer. I much prefer this as a summer beer than the lighter, crisper stuff with less body. A beer-drinker's summer brew? Something like that. Recommended."
"It has a strong alcohol aroma with a citrus finish. Almost like orange bourbon. It has a darker body than most Wits and it is extremely smooth. A Slightly heavier body than most Wits too. The flavor is grainy and orange like. There are also some lemon like flavors too. It does have a little bit of warmth to it."
"Pours a rich amber color which is pleasantly surprising for a wheat beer. Aroma is sweet and sour, candy apple, a little spicy, and a touch of bubble gum. The flavor for me is a little too sweet, cloying. There is an orange peal bitterness that I'm just not digging. There is a good bit of hop bitterness as well thats not working for me in the flavor as well. Arcadia is one of the best breweries in Michigan but I just don't like this particular offering."
"Cheers!"
"The taste is definitely fruity, with that silly berry aroma coming into play in the taste. There is also a slight taut citrus flavor, some ABV in the background, a lousy aftertaste. Oh, This beer is a mess. Not good, down the drain it goes."
"Notes: Arcadia never did impress me too much. Their Jaw Jacker was probably their best that I have sampled but many of their other beers (and I am afraid this one is included) were pedestrian."
"Hazy dirty dirty orange/gold color. Reminds me of home made apple cider. Some fair sized yeasties floating around. Hint of citrus in the smell along with some banana and caramel. I also get a slight dark/dried fruit note. Taste is similiar, but the banana and dark fruit is replaced by a spicy honey and a hint of apricot. More malty sweetness than I was expecting. I was somewhat taken aback at first, but the taste really grew on me as I went through the beer. Seemed to me to have quite a bit of Belgian influence."
"Apricot and orange colours, hazy two tone with the bottom half noticeably darker. Fleeting off-white head soon disappeared. Very flat appearance, like fresh squeezed juice. Smell of critus, tangerine, some sweetness, marmalade. Hops were muted, this beer had pronounced malty backbone with a bit of sour fruit, earthy at times. I wondered if the flat impressions meant the bottle had been in the singles bin a bit too long. Regardless, nice drinking sessional, goes well this time of year, like to try this fresher sometime."
"D= I really like this beer. By far my favorite ""American Wheat Beer"". Though the brewery tries to sell a story about this being a traditional beer served at country festivals in the olden days of England, it is delightful now and that is what counts!"
"I haven't had this beer except on cask, and I haven't had any beers on cask except this one, so I may not be the best judge either way, but in both accounts I was kind of disappointed."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Decent, but this is definitely not your average sessionable summer wheat beer. A little on the bolder side."
"Pretty low hopped and sweet for an APWA but that works for me, might be sickly sweet to others especially as it warms."
"Taste: Orange with some nice bitterness on the finish. Yeast provides the right amount of spiciness. Left with the aftertaste of honey."
"Full of flavor but not at all heavy. I could down the whole six pack whilst looking out at Spider Lake."
"This beer could be more carbonated. Pretty drinkable but just not quite what a wheat beer should be. An odd aftertaste."
"I like my wheat beer with more hops, but this seems pretty on for the traditional style."
"D: Easy to drink in the summer. Nothing overly complex makes drinking these easy, although, this would not be my #1 choice, it is stil a decent offering."
"Drinkability: Very good, something I could definately drink again."
"drinkability is ok for a higher abv pale wheat but i would rather have a ubersun for high abv or turn to a gumballhead or hopsun for a lower abv wheat"
"Overall: This is an interesting beer and I could not have more than 1. The Cardamom is way to strong of a Spice and leaves a aftertaste that I just don't like."
"Expected more spices, but I am glad they werent present."
"This brew is amber orange with a tiny off white head. No lacing. Smells of orange and lemon peels and the taste follows suit with freshly cut grass added. There are a few inappropriate hints of alcohol heat in some sips. Also, there's a bit of maple syrup in there. The flavors are a little aggressive for the style, and I don't think they blend as well as they could. It's kind of strong in flavor for a nice session or summer beer, but it's not bad in general."
"Light, drinkable, but uninspired."
"The mouthfeel was phenomenal. To have a cask conditioned beer is such a treat, and I'm glad my neighborhood bar always has one beer on cask. It was silky smooth and almost creamy up until the last few sips, and even then it was pretty smooth. There was certainly carbonation, but not with any kind of bite. Whether it was the beer or the serving type, I don't know, but this beer was outstanding. If it weren't a bit pricey, I'd down them all night, every night, until the cask runs out."
"Very refreshing."
"D: Very cool how you stumble upon a new favorite beer. Thought this was a WIT, but, to my pleasant surprise, was not. Very nice drinker, lots of character."
"D: It is not hot yet, but I look forward to enjoying this beer during the summer."
"D - Really nice and tasty warm-weather wheat ale with lots of citrus flavor. This was definitely ewasy to put down."
"Drinkability: American Pale Wheat Ales tend to be pretty bad, but this one isn't. It's a drinkable, accessible wheat beer. It's probably meant to be competition for Bell's Oberon, and it's hitting in the same ball park."
"Very intense, strong taste. Has a citrus-wheat taste mixed with almost grape aftertaste...weird but good. Very sweet, very unique. I didn't love it, but appreciated how different it was."
"D - Not really my style, but I could see a fan of the style knocking these out in the summertime."
"A fine beer, this would go much better in the summer heat than in the winter cold. Have to try a sixer next summer by the pool."
"D- I'll admit, I expected a Belgian style Wit. This has to be one of the more interesting American Wheats I've had. The tartness is very odd and seems out of style. If you are looking for a refreshing wheat, look elsewhere. This isn't bad, but definitely not on par with other Arcadia brews. That said I enjoyed some aspects of the flavor and the aroma."
"This is a brew that is designed to be drunk in the warmer months. Not bad...just needs a touch more flavor."
" Cloudy orange pour, with small white head. Sort of an odd aroma,like old ripe apple/orange,maybe some spice,flavor was much the same for me,kind of an old fruit flavor with some odd yeast notes. I sampled this twice,and came up with the same thing each time,just something here I am not liking much,. Arcadia has much better products than this one. Sorry just not for me."
"Notes from 02/03/06."
"Drinkability - I prefer a more traditional wheat. I'll finish it but I find it a little too harsh for my taste."
"D--This is a great american wheat beer. Alot of really nice,well developed flavors. Maybe too much alcohol for a session but a great summer BBQ beer none the less."
"This beer pours out a golden amber color. Very little of the fizzy white head made an appearance but what was there left a decent amount of lacing. Smell was somewhat malty, with a hint of citrus. The taste was pretty good. The malts made an appearance along with hops. Very pleasing overall. Beer had a good amount of carbonation and was pretty smooth. I would definitely drink another one of these, and could have easily had a couple more if I didn't have to drive right afterwards."
"D: A nice combination of mouthfeel and taste makes this brew a nice summer beer. Definitely easy drinking and rather refreshing."
"Pretty nice beer here. Nothing over the top, yet nothing to knock on either. It's a solid summer quaffer with flavors that meld well to bring together a nice sessionable brew. This may rank in at number four for my favorite, readily attainable, APWA's."
"This beer was a nice cloudy copper colored pour. It seems to be trying to be everything tastewise -- sweet, spicy, orange/citrus, sour -- but it does not come together, and in the end, leaves an astringent feel in my mouth. One of several not very impressive brews spawned from the Pale Wheat Ale style."
"I'm not the biggest lush, but I wouldn't have a problem loading up on this one. :)"
"Nothing remarkable about this beer, but nothing unsettling either. The pour and smell are plain Jane. Very little head and no real smell to speak of. The taste is sweet and I guess that's the honey coming through. Different from other wheats in that respect. Easy enough to drink, but it doesn't leave you wanting another."
"mouthfeel/drinkability- Feels pretty bubbly and can sense the spice before swallowing. Goes down smooth. Not bad at all."
"D - A really good brew! I don't know why, but I wasn't expecting much from this one, and I'm pleasantly surprised! This is thick, rich, sweet, but never cloying. The orange fruit freshness keeps this firmly planted in the sessionable category. A really nice beer."
"Whitsun pours a deep orange color beneath a short head of fleeting white foam. The nose is yeasty, fruity, and malty (delicately caramelish) with an edge of wheat. It has an almost melon-like aroma, perhaps cantaloupe, and bits of citrus including orange. In the mouth it's light-medium bodied and crisp with a very fine bubbled effervescent carbonation that leaves a zing on the tongue. The flavor is initially a bit tart, adding to the impression of fruit flavors (early-picked apple, pear, white grape), and it appears very citrusy. Orange flavors seem to appear across the middle along and into the finish, and it lingers in the mouth with some sweet orange marmalade and honey. The bitterness is kept in check, and it's really quite refreshing. A delicate touch of astringency in the finish leaves it very dry and refreshing. An excellent summer brew! Very fruity. Very spritzy."
"D: Ok if nothing else available per style, otherwise just a moderately average wit."
"All in all, a strong, flavorful representation of the style, but not Arcadia's best..."
"D-I've enjoyed others from Arcadia that were well above average,this one was a dissapointment for me,on to the next"
"Unusual. Unique - a fruity wheat ale with a pinch higher abv than usual for style. Worth checking out for a different spin on a summer brew, but I can't say I'm crazy about it."
"A good, straightforward pale wheat, fruit and smooth, very drinkable. This won't knock off the socks, but it should be easy as pie to kick back and enjoy a few of these without thinking twice. Recommended."
"Pours a foggy amber. Nose is slight woody caramel. Syrupy kind of character to it. Flavor is tangy in a wood kind of way. Hits my mouth and makes me go ""eck"". A bit more body than I would expect, but there it is. Slight bitter tone. Feel is thicker on the liquid with a decent carbonation. I have an announcement to make. I hate this style. I hate it, hate it, hate it. I don't think there is one beer of this style that I tried that I liked. (Okay, that's not true. Blue Star by North Coast and White Gold by Ithaca were good, but way different than the 11 others that I do not like at all) But hey, this beer is overall pretty decent I guess. I just wouldn't mind never drinking another Pale Wheat Ale in my life; except Gumballhead."
"D-Unfortunately, this was one a very few dumps for me, I just couldn't finish it."
"Drinkability - this is a good ale, certainly not a great one, but it is a rather unique take on wheat ales, and something I'd enjoy on hot summer days every so often."
"Nice mouthfeel; medium bodied. Low on carbonation and sticky on the palate. Decent beer. Cant say this is my favorite in the style. Certainly quaffable but wouldnt be hurt if this was the only one I tried."
"Reflection: This is a fair wheat beer at best. U.S. brewers never seem to make them as well as they do overseas."
"Hazy, pulpy orange copper body with effervescent carbonation topped by a cumulus cloud of beige-white head with flecks of brown yeasties. Bottle conditioned it seems. Nose of light citrus, chamomile, grains of paradise, herbal perfume, and honeyish malt. Spritzy, sparkly mouthfeel reveals soft bready malts and estery banana fruitiness. Toasted malts and citrusy, spicy hops provide good balance. More esters and light honey sweetness in an otherwise yeasty, citrus bitter finish. Not bad, and a worthy adversary for Oberon."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a hazy, dark golden-yellow color with a huge foamy head that crackles like Rice Krispies in milk. The smell is slightly sweet; primarily pale malts and wheat with honey and a spicy yeast note. The taste starts out sweet with the honey and pale malts coming to the forefront, maybe a hint of citrus, followed quickly by a hoppy bitterness and a slight alcohol finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light, creamy carbonation. Overall this beer is pretty drinkable and the alcohol is fairly well covered, only really noticeable in the aftertaste. Nothing outstanding but a very solid offering."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Light bodied and higher levels of carbonation are what one expects from this style and you'll find it here. Slight warming sensation from alcohol. Also a semi-dry finish. This is easy to drink, however I'd much rather have Oberon in my hand. It could be refreshing but there's nothing all that special about it to make me want to purchase it again."
"Overall- I think this is a good alternative to some of the more popular American wheats. It is a little sweeter than most, but not overpowering."
"Scored on a recent visit to Michigan. Had several there but saved one to take back for review. Copper color with no head and no lace, nice an cloudy like a wheat beer should be. Smells of malt and spices with a touch of bread. Taste is mainly malt and some fruit but not too distinguishable. Has a pleasant, but strangely dry, aftertaste. Slightly creamy feel to it. Although its not a great beer, it wasnt hard to put a couple away at a time while on vacation. Worth a try, just dont expect too much."
"The beer pours a dark golden color with a 1/2"" white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a pale and wheat malt scent along with a dry, honey aroma. I hear this is made with honey. The yeast is right in the forefront as usual. It's fruity and a bit stale smelling. The taste is average. It has a very dry honey flavor that is wrapped around a base of pale and wheat malts. It's fruity and warming in the finish. The mouthfeel is average also. It is a medium/full bodied beer with too much carbonation. This is one for the drawing board. These guys need some new yeast. The character this one gives off is terrible. It ruins every beer."
"I won't be coming back to this one."
"I had a sip of my wife's Whitsun at the Michigan Beer Festival and I don't remember it like this. The flavors associated don't indicate any sort of infection or oxidation, so I have to assume this bottle is 'okay'. Honestly, this is the worst beer I've had in a while, but it's not bad enough to make me pour it down the drain out of respect for beer. I suppose if you're into strongly fruity fruit beers this would be to your liking."
"Drinks more like an uber-wit or belgian PA. Enjoyed this, but off style IMO"
"Pours an orange color with a medium head that has ok retention and leaves a little bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of yeast character along with some fruit, but not as much banana or clove as expected. The flavor has some clove and other fruitiness and finishes with a spiciness either from the yeast or from the hops. The body is medium and the drinkability is good. This is a nice wheat beer, but I prefer the real ones over the American versions."
"The feel is a bit fizzy and bubbly. Almost champagne-like. But also smooth (thankfully). It's not really a wit, but a saison. Bubbly, fizzy, sour, pungent, yet surprisingly smooth."
"This is fairly similar to an American Pale Ale I homebrewed a few years back. It had a high amount of bittering hops, followed by some dry hopping. That might correlate to its overall IBU level."
"Orange/ honey color. Head disappeared fast, but that could be my fault for all I know, because the aroma was fresh and bready with a very slight toffee aspect. The flavor is bready, tart, crisp with a little acidity, and finishes the same with a tiny bit of citric hops - tiny -not even sure about it. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and drinkability is great for warm weather."
"12 ouncer, no freshness info offered. Pours cloudy/yeasty darker apricot amber, eggshell, medium bubble head and kist a tad of lace left behind. tropical fruit nose, fruity brew, respectable wit/wheat characteristics, refreshing and tasty. Some spicing and pepperyness late. Nice summer brew. Decent take on the style by Arcadia."
"Drinkability is very good, light and smooth and well-balanced. Right on the line of being a witbier, it's very flavorful for the style and recommended."
"has a alittle bit of a kick to the beer the aftertaste does have a bitter/spicyness, i enjoy the citrus taste for it and a really nice flavor to it. does have a bit of a spicey kick to it, but its a very refresing beer and i would definately recommend it. overall a good one."
"Pours a cloudy golden with an orange hue. Minimal head, with no retention,or lacing to speak of. Smell is of fruit,and spice. Taste is sweet fruit,and candy up front with a spicy finish.The higher ABV come through nicely in the taste. A bit differant,but really good. Recommended."
"D - A good pale wheat. I like the touch of honey. It adds a good sweet quality."
"A pleasant surprise. A very flavorful, yet light and crisp, beer that you can drink all too quickly. This would be a nice warm weather 6er!!"
"Imagine my surprise when a place around the corner had this beer on Nitrogen tap. Well it had a real nice pour of cascading churned golden beauty with a slight haze as it finally stopped churning. The head was large and full thanks to the N-pour. The smell was some what more muted but I think this may have been due partly to the beer gas as it had that smell, but there was still a residual sweetness of malt. The flavor was soft and wheaty with notes of citrus and subtle bits that could have been from the honey or the yeast. The mouthfeel was creamy but also light and refreshing. Easy to drink anytime of the year. BTW this was at the Pickle Barrel in Willis, MI."
"d -- never again."
"A more dark, pale yellow hue than most American pale wheat elas. More amber thab yellow even. Not a great head of any kind. Just normal. Very little bubbling and no lacing at all. The aroma hints at more of a tart Belgian ale than a Ami wheat or even s witbier. the atste is mildly tart, This is ok becasue it's so differebt from what I'm used too. Probably won't buy again."
"Hazy, sandy colored, topped with a quickly depleted head. Spicy aroma, citrusy, though it comes off as lemon more than orange. A little bit of that honey feel. Is this expired? Ah, I see they added honey to the mix. The flavor is mostly dry, chalky wheat malt, with some citrusy, honeyed notes into the finish. Citrusy fruitiness, minimal hoppage, finishing very dry. A little bit phenolic. Very spritzy, bouyant carbonation. Medium to full bodied. It's alright, but nothing I'd get again."
"Clear orange gold with a nice white head and almost no lacing or head. Sweet grains and honey with just a touch of orange in the nose. Taste has rubbery caramel malts with sweet fruity yeasts, peaches, peach syrup, smarties candy in the background, and a nice hoppy finish with a lingering bitterness. Body is medium and syrupy with decently assertive carbonation. Easy to drink and better warm than cold. Also much better in a bottle than on tap."
"While I might forget about this once it's finished, it is nice enough while I'm drinking it. It's like the perfect intelligence operative- it doesn't stand out, and it mixes right into the crowd. That said, the mainstream, basic nature makes it drinkable enough. I'll finish it with a smile, and then let the few details fade."
"The smell has some orange and honey flavor on top of a fair amount of malt. The taste is of pale malt until the honey and fruit flavors pick up in the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly thin. It's pretty easy to drink."
"This is a hazy orange beer. It smells like oranges. It tastes like very acidic wheat beer that someone has added orange syrup to. Maybe this is kinda what Berliner Wiesse is like? The mouthfeel is syrupy with acid sting. I am not into this beer. If you like oranges though, give it a try."
"Cloudy yellow/orange color with a nice 2 finger head. Head holds itself together nicely but leaves almost no lacing (kind of weird actually). Tons of carbonation bubbles flowing to the top. None of the floaties that others have mentioned. Really a nice looking beer. Smell is sweet citrus - apricots specifically. Taste also gives a blast of citrus, this is really the most noticable apricot flavor i've ever had in a beer. Finishes with a definate sour note to it. Nice feel in the mouth. Overall I was pleasantly suprised based on the other reviews i saw, maybe buying brewery fresh is the way to go with this one. The sourness starts to get old about half way through the glass but not enough to ruin an overall good impression. A very one dimensional beer and not world class by any means but one I would certainly try again on a hot summer day. Overall is has a somewhat refreshing taste to it."
"the flavor was fruity with a hint of apples, carmelized malt, thick not what i expect in a wheat but it is good."
"Dits too sour, tart and tangy for me. I think I will avoid it in the future."
"You can taste the honey added to this...slightly cloying...lighter bodied but almost a little too sticky sweet for my liking in a summer beer....the more I drink this, the more I am glad I bought just one...too sweet and sticky for me, but it does have some flavor which is more than can be said about most beers of this style.."
"American Pale Wheat Ale...is that the new American name for a Witbier to keep us from comparing this beer to Hooegarten? Nevermind. There are enough character here for me to think that they were intending to create a Witbier, but fell short. But, they didn't fall too short. It's tasty beer; just out of style. There are nice orange and lemon flavors, but poorly balanced with creamy malts and body building proteins (low wheat additions). The estery qualities are low other than the citrus. The yeasty / bready flavors and feel are less than desired. The mouthfeel is a bit fizzy and numbing because of the light body and increased alcohol. the alcohols also taste phenolic and medicinal, but not to offend. I like the aggression in the 'American' interpretation of this beer, a better body would make all the difference."
" Anyway, the nose is excellent. A refreshing sweet and tart whiff of lemon, and subtle wheat/grain. Taste is good, with a sweet orange wheatiness that gives way to a malty finish. Flavors are subdued, but overall pleasing. Mouth feel is light, but good for a summer beer."
"12 oz. bottle. The label has notches at E and 3, whatever that may mean. Pours a hazy golden orange color, with a thin foamy head. Citrusy, floral and grainy aroma. Head disappears very quick. Tart, slightly grainy, and citrusy. Some honey sweetness lingersa, along with floarl notes. Finishes with just a slight bitterness. Light body, not a bad summer beer."
"Arcadia Whitsun pours with a big, loosely bubbled head and honeyed amber body. The nose is quite fruity with apples and honey along with a very strong and cloying yeast note. On the palate, a significant acidity rises up first, followed by some fruits and then a very odd (for a wheat beer) nutty malt note. The overall impression is of a slightly weird German wheat beer, with less clove and bubblegum esters and a bit more malt. Plus that yeasty aroma and taste, although I'm not sure if that's intentional here."
"This is a rare proof that ""American wheat"" does not have to mean bland and insipid. Very fresh malt flavor, without any bready or cracker notes. Some lightly fruity flavors that did not call to mind any particular fruit, but, rather, a general ""fruityness"" that rode along the malt. Some slightly acidic tartness in the finish cleaned up nicely. Not a beer that makes a big commotion, but, when it is done, you are sorry to see it gone."
"Would I have this one again? Possibly, but it wouldn't be high up on the list. You could do much worse, but there are tons of Pale Wheat Ales better than this one."
"No way to make a first impression."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is light bodied. The beer could use a bit more carbonation. This is a ok beer drink; however I will not buy this beer again. There are all kinds of other great wheat beers available."
"Lightly lazy peach/gold color with a vigorously thick head that dissipates slowly. This actually began overflowing the bottle as soon as I opened it. Thin wisps of laacing. The aroma is mildly malty with a bit of floral hops and fruit. Light-bodied with citrusy hops and wheat flavors. The finish is crisp and fruity with a yeast/wheat aftertaste. Light and straightforward, its a decent summer brew."
"Most unusual. I could see myself enjoying one of these on a sunny day . . . but never more than one. Heck, I can barely complete the 12oz."
"One of the first really warm and sunny days this spring in Michigan make me reach for the Whitsun. Whitsun is gold to copper in color and hazy. Peaches and wheat aromas are present along with a faint honey sweetness. Honey wheat and a light citrusy sweet taste. This one goes down so easy, it is very refreshing and highly drinakable. Low carbonation with a medium body. A great seasonal that I love to enjoy with some barbecued chicken in the summer."
"Pours hazy orange with moderate head. Has a light wheat mixed with citrus taste. This beer was really refreshing and delicious and was hard to stop drinking it. Reminded me a lot of Bell's Oberon. If you like that beer you will like this one. Oberon is only brewed April- October. This is my alternative for this style November- March."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer has a hazy dark brown color. The head quickly fades down to nothing. Sour yeast aroma with a lot of citrus. Flavors of nuts, caramel, and especially lemon and honey. This beer is almost like iced tea in flavor. There is very little hop flavor, nor anything else to combat the fruity sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium. The weird flavors make finishing a glass of this beer a chore."
"Good summer drinking beer, aggressively carbonated main drawback offset by very peachy aroma and some peach in taste. Orange appearance. Made worth trying by single bottle allotment at WIld Oats in Cleveland. Malt, yeast and wheat there. More hops please."
"1st taste - This beer had a good taste. Some wheat flavor in the first sip. Similar to a Blue Moon, but this one was a little more bitter. Maybe some more hops in this than Blue Moon. Surprising to me, there was a strong presence of alcohol in the aftertaste. The beer is only 6.1%, so that seemed a little strange. Nonetheless, this was a good beer, and I would like to drink another."
"It pours a nice golden bronze color. A nice soft brown shade. The head is, well I guess there isnt one. This one is screaming for more carbonation. It smells malty and sweet, and I notice a hint of citrus fruits lingering in the background. The taste doesnt quite seem what I expected. I dont believe this is true to the style. Its way too sweet, but the tart taste at the end of the sip is nice. It leaves a syrupy feel in my mouth after the drink. I dont really notice much flavor similar to a wheat ale. Not necessarily a bad beer, but I'm a little dissapointed."
"Darked than your average APWA, still has a cool lighting effect that almost makes the beer seem to glow a dark amber color. Head is not there, very odd for a Wheat beer. Smell is lightly sweet, with bread dough, light citrus, and some floral hops. Taste is plenty hoppy, but this is missing some of the essential flavors that a APWA must have. Not much of a banana flavor, not a lot of cloves, tastes more like an amber ale. Mouthfeel is too thick and muddied for the style, needs to be lighter and more crisp. Not a bad beer in any sense of the word just didn't find the style."
"Quite hazy and sedimented medium yellow ochre with an illuminated back tone. Head is thin in the texture of the bubbles, rises to 1/4 of an inch with pretty good staying power. Laces are average in presentation, mostly non-interlocking downward dripping strings. Odd aromas, slightly citric as in citrons (candied fruit) with medicinal qualities. Mouthfeel has decent fine carbonation but is overly thick for style and verging on gloppy. Flavor starts fruity but too sweetened, some spice but is also lactic and almost like a mayonaise with tang and eggy notes. Still holds on to phenolic senses to the aftertaste. Strangely composed, I can often have trouble with this style, the spices sometimes strike me as odd, but in addition, this is too thick."
"Thanks to HopHeadKen for trading his Indianna and Michigan brews for some Missouri locals."
"My sister-in-law, upon one sip, proclaimed that drinking it was like ""licking bark"". Anyhow, I won't bother with this one again."
"not bad, actually, just needs some ZING! to make me, or anyone with taste, stand up and salute. As it is, it ain't happenin'..."
"Slàinte!"
"Drinkability is above average for me. It is easy going down and refreshing. This is one of my favorite seasonals. I look for it each spring and it never dissapoints me. This is a staple in my fridge during the warm Michigan months."
"I keep on finding some bargains at my local store and this was one of them. It pours out with a sizable 3 finger head containing small and medium sized bubbles. Body is orange with a few chunks of sediment (looks more like protein than yeast). Smell reminded me a lot of an English pale ale. Very biscuity with a hint of citrus. Can only pick up a slight aroma of banana. Taste is very clean and quenching. Notes of citrus in the beginning gently fade into a strong bread like malt before disolving into banana. Nice beer. This could quite possibly be my favorite Arcadia brew to date."
"Arcadia Whitsun isn't a head turner, but it is a solid semi-wheat ale that I could drink by the gallon on a lazy summer day."
"Very drinkable, it's just too bad this isn't the flagship beer of Michigan."
"Rather sharp fizz in light body."
"I really wanted another but I had another hours drive ahead of me. I'll come someday with a DD."
"Appearance: Deep cloudy hazed amber golden creamy head forms nicely leaves heavy chunks of lacing. Aroma: Slight subtle spice sharp wheat sweetness touch of citrus not bad seems a bit muted overall though. Taste: Slight English tone to it with a mix of caramel malt and unmalted wheat grains touch of spice and citrus appear but relatively toned down. Not a bad American pale wheat at all. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied evenly carbonated was a smooth drinking beer after the Jack Johnson concert. Drinkability: Was definitely a brew I could have sipped on for awhile, but I spotted better offerings namingly Snake River Zonker Stout."
"Nice fruit smell with malty overtones -nice. Taste is good but out of style in my opinion. Its too hoppy and fruity . Its heavy too. It is very drinkable and a very good beer but if you are looking for a refreshing summer wheat - this isn't it. It is closer to a good American Amber in my opinion. Again a good brew, but not what I buy a wheat for."
"For my money much better than Bell's overrated Oberon, and I'm from Kalamazoo!"
"ng"
"trbeer gets another thanks for the many samples!"
"This is the absolute worst tasting beer I've ever had. I couldn't get this into the sink fast enough."
"Thanks to trbeer for the bottle. Though this is a bit overly sweet, for a couple this is a fantastic hefe, with a unique sweet taste to it. Hopefully, I'll be able to have this one again."
"This is one of my favorite ""summer"" ales, along with Bell's Oberon. Certainly worth the price of a sixpack."
"Drinkability is very high. Classic summer beer."
"This beer when poured formed a small sized tan head with fine-large sized bubbles that quickly dissipated.The body of this beer was very dense, carbonated and yeast was observed at the bottom of my glass.The hue reminded me of the hue of iced tea.The nose was light malts and hops and the flavor was tangy, tart and sweet.The mouthfeel was tingly, thin, watery and light bodied.This beer had no lacing."
"And this Whitsun is one of Arcadia's more interesting offerings. Traditional in appearance -- and perhaps in aroma -- the flavors are anything but. Orange-golden hue, thoroughly hazed. Faint orange and cloves aroma. Great wheat, citrus flavor that focuses more on the orange than the lemon. Phenolic cloves and banana are light but present. A light dose of hop bitterness rounds out the picture. It's by no means an American-style hefe, but it's also not Bavarian. It's an interesting change of pace. Fans of Bell's Oberon should consider trying this; I think it's far more balanced, unique, and interesting."
"Something about all that yeast floating around makes me not want to drink this beer and thus causes for a lower than average appearance rating. But the actual flavor of this beer is quite nice. The yeast is definitely noticeable creating a dry bready flavor. Underneath that there are lots of citrus fruits here and spices. But oddly enough I don't really taste the banana and clove like most wheats have. Coriander and peach seem to be apparent with other obscure flavors following. This is a good beer to have in the summer, but I don't know if I would like it near as much any other time of the year."
"Pours out to a cloudy golden with peach accents, forming a light-beige sea-foam head atop medium-sized bubbles with good retention and minimal lacing. Carbonation is moderately strong. Aroma is of lemony hops, mildly toasted pale malts, no detectable orange, coriander, banana or clove, and a hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is rather soft and watery with a wet finish, despite it's strength. Taste begins with rather earthy hops with a lemon pith character and moderately strong intensity. Toasty grains have a pronounced tannic bitterness in the middle, followed by more earthy bitterness and a hint of peach. A hint of sulfur and corn is noticeable in aroma and taste towards the end. Bready and yeasty to an extent, but not pleasurable. Alcohol becomes astringent as it warms. Not very balanced, and not very drinkable either. I'll stick to Oberon, thank you."
"Pours a murky amber with some chunks floating around no matter how carefully you pour it. The aroma started with a big whiff of bannanas and faded to a bready slightly fruity and very faint smell. Taste is somewhat fruity with a malty backbone and a touch of extra hop bitterness. Overall a pretty good beer. Definitly encourages to try more wheats."
"I'm never overly impressed with the appearance of this beer-It pours a murky orange/amber color and often has some un-attractive yeast strains milling about, but I look forward to tasting, and drinking this beer each and every year. I think this is a summer must try for all lovers of the style. You won't find much banana or clove here, more a solid grainy/fruity flavor that borders on a touch syrupy, yet it does refresh. And, I find the drinkability here is quite nice. I always want a second, as the overall taste is just plain good! When you're at your whits-end, reach for a Whitsun! Probably superior with a whole wheat pizza!"
"Thanks to trbeer."
"It's very cloudy burnt orange with a large fluffy head that reduces to a nice coating throughout consumption. The aroma is great....buttery and hoppy and wheaty. It's such an interesting white because it has this certain caramel maltiness amongst the wheat character. This is definitley a unique wheat beer and is exceptionally drinkable and refreshing. I just love the malt character in there."
"Pours a hazy, medium amber color topped by a thick, off white head. The head never really completely fades away, hanging around for the entire trip. Spicy, clove laden aroma. Has a strong wheat component. The taste is great, a nice balance between a wheat beer and a stronger beer, almost like an IPA. Nice dose of hops, but still has that creamy, bready yeast note and good fruitiness. A good touch of banana in the flavor, but not much in the nose. Exceptionally smooth mouthfeel lends to the very good drinkability. I'm glad I finally found this beer. A great beer lover's wheat."
"I'm not usually into wheat beers but this is an exception. Very nicely crafted warm weather brew here. The look is good with a nice cloudy yellow amber body topped by a nice white head that laces like new fallen snow, coating everything in sight. Clean crisp smell with hints of citrus and wheat. The flavor is oh, so good. Creamy body brings to the palate a subtle and understated graininess that is puntuated by the crisp fruit notes. Very enjoyable and drinkable."
"Pours a cloudy yellow-orange, with a persistent white head that leaves behind rings of lace. Aroma and flavor are musty, with bubblegum and some grainy notes. Flavor is a little on the subdued side, but still quite pleasant and refreshing. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, with medium carbonation. A very easy drinking summer wheat."
"This beer poured a cloudy amber gold color and formed a nice foamy white head that left some nice lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. A slight aroma of hops and grain/bread. A flavor of hops, malt, lightly of caramel and some cirtus. The finish was light with a touch of sweetness to it. I agree that this is not really a Belgian Wit or a German Wheat. It is something sort of in the middle. A good beer, but kind of hard to place what style it is trying to be."
"Striking golden amber color. Hazy with a bit of sediment. Minimal head of fine white foam that dissipates quickly with almost no lacing. Clean, light grain smell is pleasant but weak; soft fruity notes present as well. Very smooth mouthfeel balances the crisp hops quite nicely. Soft, fruity sweetness throughout the drink hints at banana. Seemed to get better as the glass got emptier. An interesting ""soft"" wheat."
"This wheat beer has a hoppy bread and buttery aroma and flavor with a round banana finish.  Different, and good.  This brew belongs in an American wheat beer style if anything.  The flavors do not really resemble a pure Belgian wit or a Greman wheat.  Not bad, though."
"Here in Michigan, we are blessed with two fine summer beers.  Bell's Oberon and Arcadia's Whitsun.  This beer is flat out, good.  There is a light citrus taste with malt sweetness to it.  It is unlike any wheat I've had before.  There are hops, but they are there for balance, not for show.  A very easy to drink beer and due to that I am giving it a ""5" in the ""Mouthfeel"" category as it just feels and tastes right.  While Oberon is one of my all-time favorites and a great summer beer, I can honestly say Whitsun ranks right up there.  A great summer beer."
"Started drinkin this on tap on Mckinac Island where I spend my summers,one of the best wheats on tap I have had.It rates with Franziskaner in my book,yes that good!The perfect beer to drink in the summer."
