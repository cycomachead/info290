"Pours a golden-yellow in color with a small white head. Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is what would be excepted which is of sweet wheat grains for the most part. Pretty much the same for the taste with a very light dry finish. Different than other similar brews and close to the 'Goose Island '312 urban Wheat'. Lighter-bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall, this is a decent brew."

"O: This beer is very easy to drink but doesn't have much in the way of aromas or interesting flavors."

"DATE TASTED: January 25, 2014... GLASSWARE: 22 oz. pilsner...OCCASION: finishing Clash of Kings, I believe... APPEARANCE: hazy, bubbly, thin-headed sallow gold body; nondescript otherwise; no lacing... AROMA: somewhat pungent, lemon dish detergent scent; some lager malts provide a backbone; slightest banana and apple... PALATE: medium-bodied slightly effervescent; almost sudsy in its aftertaste--fizzy...TASTE: such subtle flavors--lightly lemon; predominantly metallic ping akin to a pilsner; lacking a refreshing, clean drag--just dragging... OVERALL: I understand the attempt is a wheat ale, but Wheat Monkey straddles the styles without pulling the better elements of either into my mouth; instead, it's more like monkeying around, making use of a playful label and silly enough name to attract attention--by far the weakest of what was a successful mix pack..."

"O - I do not think I would purchase this again unless it was dirt cheap. It is very boring."

"O=Milder than other wheats...a good gateway or beer for parties to introduce newbies to the style. Probably won't buy it."

"Liked the label, not impressed otherwise. Enh."

"Appearance is pale and yellow with a ring of white head and almost no lacing. Smell is citrusy with notes of lemon and wheat bread. Some lemon zest in there as well. Taste is bready and light in flavor. Malts are followed by lemon juice. Mouthfeel is light and smooth. Overall, a straightforward pale wheat with nice lemon accents."

"Drinkability: Not much character, watery. I'd pass."

"O: not a horrible beer by any means but not one I would choose to be my go-to. It does have a lovely complexity between the malt and fruit but it lacks in other areas. The nose is certainly the best feature of this brew."

"This poured out as a very pale and clear looking light yellow color. The head was white with hardly any retention and no lacing at all. The smell of the beer is sweet with grain, some wheat and corn. The taste is similar to the nose here on this, the sweetness is there as well as the corn and a subtle breadiness also. The mouthfeel is very light, modestly carbonated and kind of watery. Overall the beer is decent but nothing something I would need to have again."

"Overall - This is just a very simple wheat ale. No special ingrdients, just mostly a plain wheat flavor. It's very drinkable in my opinion, just unsophisticated is all.."

"O: Not bad but it doesn't impress me; I'd like more hops flavor and aroma. An average American Wheat."

""

""
""
"Great tasty wheat, with moderate complexity. I could drink this all day."
""
""
""
""

"Pours a light golden with way too much head. Decent lacing when the head finally disappeared. Nose is grassy,with hints of lemon...Something not quite right.Body is light and carbonated, but dry, not crisp Taste is grainy, with some hints of fruit. tart finish. Barley average. Don't go out of your way...."

"Flavor is light cracker, pilsner malt, and barnyard straw. Tastes earthy, very little yeast flavors noticed. Very plain, and watered down tasting wheat ale. Easy, bubbley, crisp palate makes for very easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not enough carbonation to really give the mouth feel that is needed. Overall, OK to drink but the beer itself could be mistaken for a lager. Strange."
""

""
""
"O: A fairly average American wheat beer apparently brewed for mass appeal."
""
"While quite quaffable and refreshing for a hot day, Wheat Monkey remains little more than an average wheat beer suitable for the masses. If you're looking for something with depth or uniqueness, skip this one and grab yourself a Wisconsinite."
""
""
""
""
"D/O: This wheat beer is likely to disappear completely amongst others of its style, with no distinguishing or particularly attractive features to set it apart. The harsh acidity that dominates its flavor profile volunteers some palate-scrubbing features, but ultimately goes overboard in its intensity. It lacks artful qualities, instead putting far too much emphasis on apology."
""
"Body is medium-light in heft, carbonation is moderate and causes the beer to foam up pleasantly on the palate. Easily drinkable, somewhat watery. Finish is semi-dry."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Straight forward clear view of what a gentle fresh summer brew should be. Doesn't overstep boundaries and be a wild adventure, just a relaxing quaff."
"Overall: Nothing to write home about."

"It's American, it's pale, it's wheaty, and it's ostensibly an ale. It's the real deal, even if that seems all too anticlimactic."
"perhaps a little out of season, more suited for a hot Summer day opposed to this chilly fall evening"
"Low ABV Summer patio beer with little to separate from the herd. Smells and tastes like a lager with the wheat not very noticeable in the flavours. No real complaints as it does what is made for ( entry level beer for BBQs and parties) but I fail to want to buy this again."
"On tap at the brewery. Good marketing but this is an american sour wheat. Not so drinkable. Not as big a head as I expected.Sweetish malty aroma. Not as good as it smells.Citrus hops do not save it. Apparently many people do not like this and so a Belgian wit is available."
"Yellow with a half-inch of white foam that faded quickly leaving no lacing. Faintly wheat and lemongrass nose and taste, however the taste being the weaker of the two. Medium-light body, moderately carbonated. Neither bad nor outstanding. Drinkable, certainly. Overall, another fairly non-descript beer from the 8-sampler pack."
"O- american pale wheats arnt my favorite style, but i definitely didnt find anything offensive in here. easy to drink and somewhat of a lawnmower beer."
"Aroma is some wheat, faint cookie and cinnamon. Really faint. Very light, with minimal cookie and wheat taste. Very limited."
"O: Mindless downer, wont give much second thought when consuming nor receive much praise during consumption. A basic wheat meant to delivery basic no thrill results. Manageable for a few."
"O- Overall, this one does exactly what it is intended to do. It is a light bodied, drinkable wheat beer that is perfect for the hot summer months."
"I feel that giving this beer an average rating is a bit generous. The cloudy orange color and white cap looked good but the almost complete lack carbonation seemed peculiar. The aroma had some orange and lemon on top of the wheat which was light. The taste was unimpressive, the wheat and citrus seemed thin to the point I could almost taste the water. Thin, we has it. I have had several similar brews that were better examples of the style and just plain more enjoyable."
"The mouthfeel is quite good, it's well-carbonated and pretty light. The drinkability, of course, is quite good. It's a pale wheat ale, if it's not drinkable, something's terribly wrong. Overall a pretty good pale what, nothing outstanding but perfectly serviceable with an excellent aftertaste."
"Generally, I prefer Jethro Tull's ""Steel Monkey", but I'll still give this beer a shot. It pours a clear somewhat pale straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises wheat and sweet flowers, both of which come through rather meekly. The taste converts the wheat into corn and sweetens things up decidedly. The flowers still come through, though, meek as ever. The body is a hefty-leaning light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, a kind of sad PWA, really one-dimensional in the wrong direction."
"Overall, a decent beer, as many have said this would be a pretty good hot summer day brew."
"Thank you, Monkey. You may now go back to your business."
"Very little carbonation. The beer just looks dead after a few minutes in the glass."
"Thin and crisp in the mouth feel. A good thirst quencher."
"This poured cloudy orange/white and had almost no head retention. It was a little flat and sweet. I smelled a little bit of banana, but it didn't necessarily come out in the taste. I don't like wheat beer that features coriander, and I did not pick that up in this one. This didn't have an odd complexity that some wheat beers have, so I am counting that a plus. It was light bodied and easy drinking. I very publicly do not like wheat beer, but this is a good find for something different."
"Drinkability - Meh. There are much better wheats out there."
"Well, this just does not quite make it. Too strong in the wheat and tangy with maybe artificial citrus."
"Lakefront is capable of brewing good to very good beer. Sorry to say, Wheat Monkey Ale is not among them, but then most APWAs stuggle to be much better than average. You probably won't regret your purchase, but go with a single for starters."
"Unremarkable in both character and complexity; reserve for a summer ""lawnmower pounder"" at best."
"This wheat beer pours a pale yellowish color with a head that diminishes quickly as you get a semi strong scent of wheat. It has a decent wheat flavor to it but it is way too thin. Definetly needs more volume too it because it is just way too simple. Something beginners might want to try but not anything that will win awards."
"Poured very nicely with a great golden hue. Very complex taste that accompanies the standard wheat flavor. Could be a hint of clove. To be honest, it just does not have the refreshing taste and finish that i enjoy about a quality wheat beer. To end on a positive, i enjoyed its unique mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: Just as mild, as innocuous, and as easily drinkable as one would expect from the style. Just barely enough character present to maintain one's attention."
"Overall: As I said above, this is the weakest Lakefront offering I've had. Also, this style can vary dramatically, but there are way too many other great American Pale Wheats out there for me to ever come back to this one specifically."
"Pure white two-finger head, medium dissipation with minimal lacing over straw yellow a bit cloudy body, multiple streams of carbonation rising from bottom of glass. Nose is clean wheat, evidently a bit of wheat malt, some fruitiness. Taste mirrors nose, clean but pretty nondescript, faint bit of bitterness on the back end. Thinnish mouthfeel, which I would expect for this style, decent effervescence. At this ABV this is pretty drinkable. I think this may have been the new recipe trumpeted on brewery's website, so it may be an improvement over the (BA lambasted) version. It's not Widmer Hefe (which apparently BAs aren't too fond of, try it on tap at the brewery), but it ain't that bad."
"Maybe it's the fact that this was on draft, where the flavors had some extra pop, but I actually didn't think this was too awful. This was easy drinking enough stuff and had just enough flavor to keep me interested on this warm summer day. Based on the reviews though, maybe I'll not push my luck and skip this one in the bottle..."
"The mouthfeel was a bit thick for the style, but otherwsie this was a drinkable beer."
"Pours a very light, very clear orange yellow color, similar to bud light. Has basically no head and terrible retention. This is a poor effort so far. The aroma is muted, really just has a touch of light peach fruit, maybe some artificial sugar. The taste is really terrible. Has a budweiser corn taste to it that is gross. Almost tastes like keystone light that you threw up. Has the gross stomach acid taste to it. Might be the worst tasting beer i have had to date. I actually prefer warm keystone light to this. Mouthfeel is gross. too flat, too light, too bland and way to off for a wheat beer. Drinkability is not good either. Highest score in this category because its light and low abv, other than that you need to aviod this fucker."
"Pretty solid stuff as its basic nature of what most pale wheat brews offer is on track for an easy going sessionable summertime brew."
"Overall, this is terrible. Maybe a good beginner beer but nothing for even a moderately experienced craft drinker."
"D- An average beer that leaves much to be desired. There are much better Lakefront offerings, I suggest you seek them out first."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a small head. Smell is of sour lemons. Tastes like it smells, sour lemons and not much else, leaving an unpleasant aftertaste. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is not very drinkable. Overall not a beer I would recomend."
"D: Meh. This style, ""American pale wheat", is not even close to a German wheat. Pretty bland, maybe blander than an American adjunct lager ( BMC)."
"Sorry to say, this came off pretty weak and uninteresting."
"Eh."
"D - I have two more bottles and it was drinkable but would probably pass by this if I found it in the store. Still a very good wheat beer."
"A nice and simple beer that is largely error free. I would prefer the malts to completely dominate without the grainy intermitten character. I would also like to see more intense hop flavor/bitterness and peppery notes from the yeast."
"d - An ok wheat ale. Some sourness in the smell hurts it but the taste was much better. Wouldn't seek out again but worth a try if your'e looking for a low ABV wheat beer."
"Pours a nice hazy golden pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some yeast notes, corinader, grassy, slight bananna. The taste is sweet, malty, yeasty, with some nice spice notes, a touch of bananna. Light-Medium body. Drinkable, a nice thirst quencher."
"All in all, a good wheat beer but nothing great."
"An American pale wheat with a banana touch (though hardly in hefe-weizen range - though, that's fine, as it doesn't claim to be such) that is not too sweet. A mild, inoffensive, craft ""lawnmower"" beer."
"Pours a slightly hazy pale yellow color with a small white head. Some fruity yeast esters and some banana in the nose. Good balance for the style a long lasting grassy bitterness on the aftertaste, although the banana flavor dominates. Small bubbles of carbonation, very light and pretty drinkable. There are better options in the style but this is a well made offering that is worth a try for fans."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a towering white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a dry, musty pale and wheat malt scent along with a horrible yeast aroma. It's bone dry with a touch of citrus. The taste is average as well. It has a light pale and wheat malt flavor along with a dry, citrusy finish. It's not overly tasty or complex and it does have an off-putting musty character. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with too much carbonation. This is a forgettable wheat beer. It's light, but lacking flavor and is full of flaws."
"I poured this from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. It has an extremely light color, so light it's almost clear. I could see my fingers on the other side of the glass. No head to speak of, but the lacing was pretty nice. I couldn't catch much in the scent. Just a faint smell of wheat. Disappointing. For a beer that looked so light, this has a surprisingly nice body to it. Unfortunately, the body didn't have a taste to match. It was pretty bland, with just a hint of wheat and fruit. Last night I had this on tap at the brewery and it was much better then it was bottled. I rated the taste a little bit higher, just because I wonder if I got an older batch in these bottles."
"From all the brews from lakefront this is my favorite so far, keeping in mind I have not tried their IPA yet."
"drinkability is good. this could be a great session beer, as long as Lakefront remains consistent in the final product, something that has been somewhat of a problem for them in the past. all together, this is a drinkable and pleasant wheat ale. cheers!"
"For what it is, it's great. I'd put this against any other american style wheat out there."
"(D)- A solid Wheat beer that has what you want and should have for the style. Great for summer. A 6pk wouldnt stand a chance!"
"Lakefront can do better."
"Pours a hazy yellow with a white head that falls to a thin cap. Aroma is of cloves and coriander. Light bodied with a sweet malt base that leads to fruity esters and has a pleasant wheat finish. Rather low carbonation for a beer of this style. The flavors are very delicate, it didn't hold up at all to food, however a very refreshing summer beer overall."
"The best part about this beer is the purple cartoon monkey on the packaging. With a name like ""Wheat Monkey"" I was expecting it to taste more like a hefeweiss with some banana flavor from the yeast. Of course, this isn't a hefeweiss at all, and it clearly states so with ""Wheat Ale"" printed on the package. That's disappointing."
