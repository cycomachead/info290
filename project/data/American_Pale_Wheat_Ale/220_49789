The glass allows any beer’s characteristics to shine through and this beer is amazing. The color is much lighter and more of a yellow-golden than other IPAs that I have reviewed like Rebel Rouser from Sam Adams and Rampant IPA by New Belgium. Those beers are amazing too, but this one is different, because it focuses on the floral and piney citrus flavors more than other IPAs.","hopphead31415","Feb 13, 2015"

It's really well balanced.","snilsen13","Jan 07, 2015"

Pine hops punch through other clean/soapy smells, hinting at a very refreshing brew. Tastes of lemon, orange, and pear juices. Possibly some biscuity malts there, but piney hops overtake the taste buds before there's any chance of balance. Feels light and refreshing. Subtle carbonated and somewhat creamy. Overall, one of the most refreshing wheat beers I've had, but not enough hop/malt balance for my liking. I was hoping the malts would come out towards the end, as citrusy hops dominated everything, but no dice :/ Still, Little Sumpin' is one tasty Lagunitas brew worth trying.","Jonoesh5","Jan 02, 2015"

On the other hand, it has the intense hop character of an IPA with a discernible malt influence which comes across as soft and bread-like. The hops are citrusy and bitter, siding with grapefruit, lemon, and lime without the rounding influence of some sweeter, tarter orange, etc.","The_Mad_Capper","Dec 01, 2014"

Slightly fizzy yellow; an inch of clouds; and minimal lace comprise the nonic pint that allows me to see the girth of my fingers on the other side. The smell is delicious; reminiscent of Cameron Diaz in her younger years, yet that is another story. Hmm. Banana chips, forest sap and honey pervade my senses and invite me to delve further into this temporary escape from reality. The taste is superb. I suppose this is a hybrid, because if mother wheat had a love child with the four C's, it would result in this brilliant, yet complex bubblegum hops offering. Body is medium, and warms with additional surprises of grapefruit and peach on the tongue. Every now and then we step outside of our zone and find a beer that surprises us. For me, this was one of those times. The IPA Hunter gives this an overall rating of LARRRRRRGE!","weiserr","Nov 15, 2014"

It has a very nice grapefruit sweetness that comes on first, followed with a slightly bitter wash that then fades into citrusy sweetness again. The alcohol is also completely hidden and it does go down easily. This is an outstanding beer and one of my favorites.","WAbeerfiend","Sep 23, 2014"

The hops don't come across as fresh on the tongue, but this is still damn tasty. Pungent grapefruit plus hints of pineapple and mango all but overwhelm any malt balance. The body was big and sticky. Definitely liking this one. Give me a bottled on date and this would be a regular buy for me.","DIM","Sep 21, 2014"

Scents of earthy, vegetal hops, hints of tropical fruit, mostly mango, a bit of pine resin, a hint of orange and a little bit of alcohol. Overall impression of aroma is a nicely hop forward aroma that has most all of the typical West Coast aromas on display. Quite nice. Flavor begins with a nice vegetal hop flavor, mingling with pine resin, and a bit of indeterminate citrus. Bitterness is moderate. This moves into a middle with notes of orange zest and flesh and a touch of alcohol. Finish is medium-dry with notes of pine resin, earthy, vegetal hops, faint alcohol and a bit of grainy malt. Aftertaste is tropical fruit, pine resin, a bit of grainy malt and earthy hops. Overall impression is of a nicely hoppy beer that still lets a bit of the wheat malt shine through. Very nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, resinous and slightly chewy with a nicely slick feel with medium-low carbonation. Overall impression is of a good, smooth, resinous mouthfeel that is quite nice. Overall this is a nice hoppy wheat ale that is very pleasant in aroma and flavor and is aided by a nice mouthfeel. It is quite balanced and very drinkable, a good ale.","Auraan","Sep 13, 2014"

It's got some really nice malt and hop aroma and flavors and goes down smooth. What else could you ask for? Recommended.","MikeB20","Sep 06, 2014"

It really is a fine refreshment worth savoring, perhaps not worthy of world fame but definitely something I would want in my cup.","MentalMonkey","Aug 31, 2014"

When my brother was visiting NYC (from Petaluma, CA) we got one of the not-so-great six packs from a super market prompting the dreaded criticism of ""It doesn't taste as good out here."" Stores that have a high turnover (like a Whole Foods beer store or specialty beer stores) are your best bet for a relatively fresh batch. With this beer, freshness means everything. With the opening of the Chicago brewing site, hopefully those of us on the east coast can expect to see a steadier stream of fresh Lagunitas Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale.","cmart332","Aug 20, 2014"

I was a regular Sierra Nevada Pale Ale guy (which is my everyday) and the flavour here was a wake up call for me. I love this beer. This is one of the best I have ever had and I will grab it without hesitation from the shelf. And like most products from Lagunitas, I have enjoyed its subtlety beautiful flavor and consistency every time I buy it. If you ever have anyone offer this to you at a gathering or whatever, they deserve a kiss right on the mouth... per Lydia Loveless, and hopefully she looks like the Varga Girl on the label.","Boneswally","Jul 22, 2014"

A bit of alcohol on the back end (but we are talking about a 7.5% beer, so no hard feelings). Overall, this was very good.

3.63,-13.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,4,"A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale -brewed by Lagunitas Brewing Company with an ABV of 7.5. This brew pours out a nice amber color with a nice white head. The smell is bold and rich with hops and grains. The smell is a little bit overpowering to this brew. The taste is bitter at first but the end is nice. This brew has a nice clean finish. The mouthfeel is great and refreshing. A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale is an ok drinking brew. It is bitter but smooth. I like how this brew is different from most brews on the market. This is not your everyday drinking brew. You have to be in the mood for this brew. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out of 5.","nicholas2121","Jul 10, 2014"

I feel this is suited more toward IPA fanatics rather than Wheat connoisseurs. Appearance, smell and mouthfeel are great.

I love the label design of anything Flying Dog, and Sumpin' by Lagunitas is a great looking label. Throwback pinup girl is asking you if you want to take a sip, and you do. She's naughty and knows you like that. I put this beer up against almost anything. Best part is that it's available all the time. The hype isn't a limited availability marketing/snob thing. Only mark I have against it is the difference in pricing locally. I see it at Alberson's for $14.99 a sixer but can pick it up at my favorite ma and pa liquor store for $9.99.","RickFromArizona","May 30, 2014"

There is a bitter tackiness as well. Some pepper. Nice. Doesn't hit you over the head with hop bitterness, but it is there. The fruity orange flavor offsets it well. A beer you can sit and relax with and you wouldn't grow tired of. Light and fizzy in the mouth. This is exactly how I would hope a beer that tastes this way would feel in the mouth. A delight! A beer you can sit and relax with. Something you wouldn't grow tired of. Easy drinking. Love it!","aaroblero","May 01, 2014"

Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big pineapple, mango, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon/orange zest, orange rind, pine, floral, grass, wheat, light honey, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with awesome complexity of bright citrus hops and light-moderate malt balance; with great strength. Taste of big pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon/orange zest, orange rind, light mango, floral, grass, light pine, wheat, light honey, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon/orange zest, orange rind, floral, grass, light pine, wheat, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity of bright citrus/floral hops with light-moderate malt balance; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding IPA! All around awesome complexity and balance of bright hops and light-moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 11, 2014"

This beer honestly gave me a half-chub on the smell, making me expect a hoppy/citrusy IPA, but then it fell flat when it came to taste. I can definitely see how some people like this beer, but it just ain't for me.","CraigS119","Feb 06, 2014"

Personally not a big hop head which may be why the bitterness bugs me for just being a pale (and at that with wheat!). I don't find it to be particularly unique but very good nonetheless.

4.05,-3.8,3.75,3.75,4.25,4.25,4,"It is difficult to find American wheat ales that aren't pretty insipid to my palate, even from decent breweries. American wheat is such a broad style and many err on the side of bland and bubbly, presumably a profit-driven decision. On the other hand, Lagunitas rarely if ever disappoints and has a reputation for heavy-handed hopping so I snagged a six-pack of this when I happened upon it at a so-called wine market that also has a decent craft selection. Worth every penny. A bottle of this elixir pours a pleasing golden yellow with a lot of thick white head. The brewer wanted that classic wheat head retention and executed this variable like a pro ... Stuff sat there like meringue. Aroma was also pleasantly evocative of lemon meringue pie, among other signs of a solid malt-hops balance ... I get mixed citrus, a grainy spice, and a little resin or pine all on top of a graham cracker malt backbone. Palate is fairly chewy, creamy and smooth but pungently bitter: Lemon, lime, orange, and grapefruit, passion fruit and cantaloupe, starfruit, apricot, and a touch of something that recalls white wine, this starts like a fruit bowl but ends with a grainy, bitter coda of piney wood, green bananas, and some floral components that evoke tobacco or sweetgrass. Not particularly estery or phenolic as per the American style, this is a wheat ale hopped like an IPA and is the perfect antidote to North American wheat beers that taste like foam and not much else. May be too bitter for some expecting a more traditional wheat experience.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 23, 2013"

While small, the head is very tight, and it coats the glass all the way down. At cold fridge temperature, its flavor doesn't have a chance to really open up. Carbonation dominates your tongue. Let it warm up to the mid to high 40s, and the beer comes alive. It's smells like honey wheat bread, and tastes about the same, with a lingering maltiness, and a sweetness that sticks with you. Overall, it's a very good beer that is nice to sip on when you get home from work.","dwagner003","Nov 02, 2013"

Smell is sweet hops, wheat, pine. taste is full of perfectly balanced wheat with sweet piney hops, plenty of citrus, some pineapple, some other sweet fruity notes. I love this beer, definitely a perfect west coast hybrid of an ipa and a wheat beer. As a lover of both styles this is a winner for me.","brewtus","Oct 01, 2013"

When taking a sniff of the beer you can clearly smell the hops but it isn't overpowering. It's as if there is enough to say I'm here but I'm not going to melt your face off. The taste is very similar. You get the boldness of the hops, but the aftertaste is smooth and lacks the bitterness of some overly hoppy ales.","Matt_Stuart","Sep 17, 2013"

Lightly citric malty taste up front with a nice bitter piney hop at the end with a wheat edge.  Bitter soapy aftertaste that is great.  Excellent beer.

Great hop complexity, yet I feel that most other brews in this category that I've sampled can provide the same profundity. Maybe my hops palate hasn't been properly developed (quite possible), maybe I've only been sampling the finest of AIPA's (possible), but it didn't live up to its casing's hopefulness of tasting 'everything anew'.

Everything about this beer is spot on for the type of beer that it is. Although I personally didn't like the bitterness the aftertaste left, that is just my personal opinion. Would definitely recommend it if you like this style of beer.","Weston19","Jul 29, 2013"

Quite hoppy for a wheat beer but very tasty. Sour lemon tartness and bready with a full body.

Waited a little bit and tried it again and it provided a decent taste. I'm not a fan of this beer but I can see the uniqueness of spicy ting that some may appreciate.","JonathanC","Jun 25, 2013"

Taste start off with a modest malt taste and ends with a lingering hop hit of grapefruit rind. Very crisp and refreshing. Mouthfeel is very good. It is nicely carbonated and easy to drink.

As it warms it smells like wheat and honey. The malt is a surprising standout in the glass. Bready and lots of biscuit. The hops are vigorous earthy and herbal. Their spiciness is tamed down by the big malt character. What a surprise this beer was. A celebration of hops without being overly fruity or bitter. A celebration of pale malt that was straightforward and not overly sweet . Robust yet easy to drink with a lightly oily mouthfeel and a long dry finish. This beer really does have a little sumpin’ sumpin’.","utopiajane","Jun 11, 2013"

Medium body, nice carbonation allows flavors to meld on the palate. Overall, I always enjoy this hopped up version of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Really nice flavors here; perfect for summertime, but with the higher ABV it's less sessionable than most APWA's.","barnzy78","May 01, 2013"

Still, a very minor gripe for a beer I buy with great frequency, especially during the hot summer days.","Siriusfisherman","Apr 23, 2013"

Nose is full of hops--citrus and pine, maybe a touch of bread. Mouthfeel is smooth, with good body and nearly-undetectable alcohol.

4.24,0.7,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"There isn't too much depth and complexity to this beer, it's a solid choice if you're looking for a nice summer ale with plenty of dry hops and bitterness, but mild enough for the non-IPA enthusiasts to enjoy. The wheat really shines through, and begs for a zesty food pairing; tacos, guacamole, ceviche, or pretty much anything fresh cilantro. That's how I enjoyed it. The flavor doesn't linger long, and the ABV isn't killer.","Bauzen","Apr 09, 2013"

Nice malty flavor, with subtle citric fruits and light, damp woodiness, with a surprisingly tropical fruit note. Light mouth feel, nicely carbonated. Overall a great pale wheat ale, perfect for the first warm day of the year.","smooth_aleing","Apr 08, 2013"

This ale poured a clear pale color, produced a thick white head, left an OUTSTANDING amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of fresh baked bread and mega amounts of floral hops. Medium bodied this wheat ale had a foundation of soft malted wheat, that gives way to a citric hops. By far the best American Pale Wheat Ale I have sampled.

Very sessionable, three bottles later I was feeling as good as it gets. This is a great brew but is more of an IPA than a wheat ale. Remarkable first impressions from this brewery. I sure do love living in Southern California and seeing sixers of this within walking distance of my house. Does it get any better? Not by much Im thinking, not by much. I would rate this a WC offering.","hopfen","Mar 27, 2013"

It smells amazing, but as far as taste goes, I wouldn't have it again: the bitterness of the hops is overbearing and there doesn't seem much else to the flavor. There is no subtle complexity that Gumballhead has. This beer tastes like an IPA, and I'm not an IPA fan. Wish it had less bitterness and more of a complex wheat flavor.","MShirokov","Mar 23, 2013"

Delicate clusters of lacing coat the sides of the glass during the tasting. Nose expresses wheat and orange rind. Taste consistent with nose - no real surprises; however, there is a pleasant, easy tartness to the flavor profile, with a light, earthy hops bittering at the finish. Mouthfeel is light in body with a slight astringency and a carbonation that falls just shy of lively. I can't believe I'm just discovering this beer. Easy drinking and refreshing.

Gave it a good pour, and didn't get much of a head there, but what was there was densely formed by lots of tiny bubbles. For a wheat, not real cloudy (I even gave it a swirl at the end, which I think did absolutely nothing), but really nice light amber color. The nose is great, pine, candy, berry, definitely some sour yeastiness. Love it. Flavor is great, sweet but nice backing bitterness from the hops and alcohol. Mouthfeel is pretty perfect, light with a punch. Overall, this is a kickass beer. Totally worthy of the over-ten-bucks pricetag, and I will definitely get this again.","BeerWizard","Feb 16, 2013"

Taste is initially very hoppy with earthy tones, but finishes really syrupy, not what I was expecting at all after the smell. It doesn't fully ruin it, but it does bring it down a little. Beer is carbonated correctly and for its light body, even with the syrupy taste still goes down smooth. Overall, an above average beer.","cyclonece09","Jan 30, 2013"

The brewery that consistently nails the big hops taste test is Lagunitas. The Lagunitas beer that satisfies me EVERY time I pop one is Little Sumpin' Sumpin'.

Wheat flavors subdued by the hops and citrus. Very nice medium, creamy body with an superb mouth feel. Very tasty and well made. Not really to style for an American pale wheat ale; not cloudy, not pale, wheat element rather subdued.

It has a ton of fresh flavor and depth of body, and the subtle nuances in smell/taste are what really make it great. There are tons of piney-grapefruit honey hops, bread-y yeast, and a bit of fruit flavor like apple and pear. There is also a little sweetness to the hops that balances out the whole beer.

After opening and pouring it into a glass it was apparent that it was a wheat beer which generally I'm not a huge fan of, but the color wasn't off putting and the aroma was pleasant. Nice citrus and wheat notes. I thought it had a slightly floral smell which was at first I wasn't too sure of, but it grew on me. I took my time drinking it and found overall it to be very satisfying and clean. Nothing unpleasant about the beer's head or the consistency in the glass. A great beer for being outside in the warm weather. I wouldn't say I loved it, but could surely see myself drinking it again. I think its the kind of beer that the more you drink of it the more you can enjoy it.","Scubasteve1974","Aug 14, 2012"

A nice sweet malt underbody providing some nice doughiness to the aroma sitting alongside some grassy hops and some grapefruit. Flavor offers some moderately bitter grassy and citric hops alongside some sweet wheat malt. A crisp, medium bodied. Overall, not a bad beer.","denver10","Jul 26, 2012"
3.85,-8.6,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a clean golden color like very light yellow piss, though there is a little of the wheat haze towards the middle and lots of bubbles tumbling up from the bottom. The head is finger thin with big white bubbles and a nice easy retention at a half a finger that leaves sticky thin clouds of lacing on the side of the glass. The beers smells surprisingly nice and wet with pine hops and some nice citrusy tingles, but I don’t notice any of the wheat in the smell and the malt and yeast seem to be light in the smell. The beer tastes much like it smells, thick with resin-like pine hops. The malts are faint in the initial sip as the hops take the full “blam” but the after taste is a lovely light sweet wheat malt with side tingling from the hops. There are also some nice light citrus tangs in this beer reminiscent of oranges and mango. The mouthfeel is initially really rough with carbonation and the hops bitter bite, leaving the tongue feeling assaulted. The beer is really clean and refreshing on the tongue, but the after feel is only lightly tingly with hop and a slight bitter-burn on the tongue, while the rest of the mouth has a thin sheen of saliva. That initial mouthfeel is too rough for my taste, but mellows out to a more manageable state. Overall the beer a nice hopbomb of a pale wheat ale, reminiscent more of Sierra Nevada’s Pale ale or an IPA than of anything thing else I have tried. This is admittedly my first heavily hopped wheat ale, and I love the hops in it, and the aftertaste of wheat malt is very intriguing, but the rest of it isn’t very different from other ales.","Maxwell","Jul 26, 2012"

This offering is a much better take on the Pale Wheat Ale than most other offerings of this style, even thought I would consider this more a Wheat IPA given the ABV instead of a wheat pale ale. The hoppiness really makes this a great refreshing brew and one I will gladly revisit in a bottle or on draft during the warmer months of the year.","claspada","Jun 18, 2012"

This is the same category that Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat and Sam Adam’s Coastal Wheat and Summer Ale is in. Not that there’s anything wrong with those beers, but Lagunitas destroyed all of them with this. Until I read the classification of the brew on BA this morning, I thought this was may be a light IPA, or an aggressively hopped APA. I would have never guessed APWA. Regardless of all that, this is an exceptional beer for a good price that I can get most anytime. I would highly recommend this to anyone, and I will be drinking it again. Well done by Lagunitas, I’m going to call this a hybrid of styles.","TheCondor","Jun 16, 2012"

4,-5,4,4,4,4,4,"very bizarre brew here. pours a clear red tinted copper color with a one inch off white head that slowly dissipates. smells like fresh hops, grassy and earthen, english malt backing, some wheat malts as well, but does not smell like a wheat beer and its usually accompanying yeast. flavor is strangely hopped up front, not quite fruity, a bit dry, and mildly spiced. tough to place exactly, but possibly tasting some fresh cascade hops here. feel is good, fuller bodied than most. kind of a hybrid beer in taste and feel, not a wheat beer per se, but not an ipa either. well carbonated, it carries the unique flavors of the hops. overall a cool beer, good bargain, and interesting blend of ingredients. ill most likely have this again.","StonedTrippin","May 05, 2012"

I cannot get too far into the ASTM profile, but I can say it ranked pretty well in all of them.

The smell is a mix of grapefruit, lemon and crackers. It's a fresh, refreshing smell, but it's a bit static and one-dimensional. Nice aroma...but citrus dominates. The flavor is more nuanced.. There's a lemon-grass and wheat twang flavor, backed by a bit of sweetness and modest hop flavor. Nicely packaged. The beer also hides it's alcohol well. It tastes like a session beer, but the ABV could be dangerous. Some residual sweetness that hints at heaviness, yet the beer stays refreshing. Nice beer.","Suds","Mar 03, 2012"

Easy drinking and approachable, but not sacrificing character in any way. I like it when there’s some wheat character that’s allowed to shine through in a beer, too—too often the wheat in a beer gets washed out by spices or super-estery yeast notes, so I like it when it’s given its due with a solid ale yeast. Not that I’d consider this a particular wheaty brew—it’s more of a sidenote. But I enjoy it. Well done, Lagunitas. Keep up the good work. And yes, I’m still waiting for a bretty Hop Stoopid.","fmccormi","Feb 24, 2012"

The aroma is huge pineapple, orange peel and some sweet grapefruit. there is a nice hint of sweetness on the front of the nose and the malt creeps through to balance out the aromas but this is definitely hop forward on the aroma. The taste is very much like the aroma. It has a huge kick of sweet pineapple and orange peel. I get a little bit of a bitter grapefruit rather than sweet on the taste, but it works great with the other hop flavors. There is a malt presence that balances this enough to keep it from being a total hop bomb. Smooth arrival to the hops and dry finish. The mouthfeel is spot on for an IPA. Really has a big kick of carbonation that cleanses the palate while opening it up to all the huge flavors this beer has to offer. Not over sticky or sweet at all for such a high hop profile. Overall this is a great beer and very accessible. I wish it were year round. Definitely worth seeking out and trying.","Augustiner719","Feb 02, 2012"

The dominate grapefruit you see in many ipas is upfront, but doesn't linger after finish. I guess the only sense of a wheat beer is the finish, but it's settle. Besides that, I would classify this as an ipa. Good beer worthy of my shelf, go pick up a six pack.","MEsoJD","Jan 11, 2012"

The one finger of head retained itself nicely and left bands of thin lacing. The aroma was of lots of citrusy hops, pale malt and some wheat underneath. The flavors were similar showcasing the orange, grapefruit and lemon notes of the hops with hints of pine and pale malt lingering on the finish. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium and the carbonation appropriate. A very tasty beer and a premier example of an American Pale Wheat Ale.","thekevlarkid","Nov 28, 2011"

The smell is mostly of citrusy/piney hops with subtle hints of wheat in the background. The flavor is similar to the nose, with the citrusy hops taking center stage. Very nicely hopped but not mouth puckeringly bitter, this beer has great flavor. The mouthfeel is rather full with a thick carbonation that adds to the viscousness. Overall a very good beer, worth having again.","gmfessen","Oct 30, 2011"

4.3,2.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"American pale wheat ale? Ha! Putting this beer in the class that is generally bland and insipid is an outrage. We need a new category (because there are, of course, never enough pigenholes). I suggest ""double imperial American pale wheat ale"" (DIAPWA). Drinks quite large, with an aggressive hopping that takes hold right from the start and dominates center stage throughout. I did not particulary get the wheat addition, other than perhaps a bit of sharpness in the malt profile. Malt took on a sweet aspect toward the finish calling to mind a DIPA. Nicely done.","Brent","Oct 17, 2011"

4.04,-4,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"My pour created three fingers of dense eggnog colored head with good retention. Color was an oh-so-slightly hazy golden yellow. Nose smelled like pineapples and freshly mown grass. Mouthfeel was medium and the pineapple taste was right out of a roll of Tropical Fruit Life Savers. How did they accomplish this one? Man, this was so mellow and coupled with the ABV, I was feeling good about myself. The finish was semi-sweet and very pleasant. That may do it for me this evening.","woodychandler","Oct 10, 2011"
3.62,-14,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall – not a bad brew, and not bad tasting at all. Tasting it in the fall now, but it was probably aimed at being a summer beer, which makes a lot of sense.","Nerudamann","Oct 10, 2011"
4.45,5.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer pours a slightly hazy straw color with a finger of thick white head that retains and laces well.

The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated with no lingering harsh flavors. Overall a great beer.","csiewert","Oct 09, 2011"
4.32,2.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a cloudy murky bright pale orange color. Lovely color and a nice 2 finger head is present. Big hopped up grapefruit aroma. Also some tropical fruit, maybe pineapple on the aroma. The aroma is very inviting and is dominated by the hops. Low smooth bitterness with a sweet hoppy finish. Loads of flavor, very tropical, citrusy, and overall just fruity. Finishes with a pleasant crisp sweetness. Solid mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. I love this beer, it has a little of everything. Its hoppy with fantastic flavor and aroma, but an overall low bitterness for such hop flavor. It drinks very well and I could always grab another after the first.","ShemRahBoo","Oct 08, 2011"
4.34,3.1,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Pale ale color, very clear for having wheat. White head with so-so head retention. I would have presumed the wheat content would stabilized the head, but it's most likely the 7.5% A.B.V. knocking it back. Smells like maybe Centennial and Citra hops, with a fairly neutral yeast. Both in the smell and taste, you couldn't ask for much more as an example of American hops. Intense citrus almost pineapple flavors and aromas. Sweetness and bitterness are very suiting. Body is on the thinner side which also surprises me because of the wheat. I assume this is made with a sugar adjunct, but it is very cleanly fermented. Thus the thin body and respectable ABV. Very tasty sixer. Everything about the beer accentuates hops. Would gladly have again.","mlazzaro","Oct 06, 2011"
3.7,-12.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Straw yellow clear body (once the friggin frost on the glass disappeared) multiple streams of medium size bubbles under finger and a half frozen frothy white head, medium dissipation with not much lacing. Citrusy nose, lemony, clean wheat body with good dose of apparently citrus hops on back end. Taste is once again citrusy, almost like someone put the proverbial lemon wedge in here, a bit of piney resin for balance. Mouthfeel close to medium, a bit heavy for the style, fairly dry, astringent finish. Not exactly my cup of tea, a bit heavy on the lemon esters and tres hoppy for the style, but ABV relatively well hidden, though this is my no means a session beer.","jdense","Oct 05, 2011"
4.32,2.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Morey's Bottom Line: This one exceeded my expectations. Very tropical and fruity. I wish that I knew how old this bottle was, but there's nothing but a code (24210308) on the neck of the bottle, and I''m not sure what it means.","Morey","Oct 04, 2011"
3.33,-20.9,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"T: I don't know what it is about Lagunitas beers, but not one of them has really impressed me so far. Maybe at this point, it's becoming a mental thing. This one just didn't do it for me, though. It had a strong pine hop flavor and some floral hops thrown in as well. A dash of bready malts and then a ton of hop resin that gave it a really harsh bitterness. The balance felt way off and I probably wouldn't want to try this one again.","notchucknorris","Oct 03, 2011"
4.17,-1,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall - I am constantly impressed by Lagunitas, and Little Sumpin is such a great IPA. So complex and so well balanced.

It has a full, fluffy mouthfeel that lightens up a lot at the finish and leaves the mouth very dry. It tastes quite a bit like the aroma, but decidedly more piny. The hops are the focus here and it's pretty bitter. The malt is resiny and peppery. A pine resin bitterness lingers for a while after the taste. It's a bold and tasty beer. This is what I expect from Lagunitas.","yesyouam","Sep 07, 2011"

I don't taste any of the usual wheat flavors, but it is rather sharp and acidic. More of a Belgian character. I would have called it a Tripel, but it is considerably more bitter than any I've had. Interesting and well-made beer that is worth a try. Quite fragrant and spicy in the nose. I like the ""Wild"" version a little more with its bolder Belgian weirdness.

A little yeasty aftertaste, but its supreme flavor leaves you yearning for more. This was an awesome suprise to my mix 6 pack I picked up at Andersons Market in Toledo.

Aroma is citrusy hops (grapefruit, tropical fruit, lemon peel), floral hops and a bit of sweet malt. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some honey flavors, pine hops and wheat. I don't think this beer is made with honey, but it seems to me that there's a honey-like sweetness noticable. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy and smooth and has good carbonation.

4.35,3.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Big grapefruit and citrus flavors come out of the hops. The flavor is intense and bold, hitting all of the tastebuds and then rescinding quickly so that you can't wait for the next sip. There's a balance from the malts that takes the edge off the sharply bitter hops just enough so that they can be enjoyed to their fullest extent without making you pucker. Not much of a boozy taste, so the 7.5% ABV has the potential to sneak up on you. The mouthfeel helps along the carrying of the hop message with its moderately high carbonation and ultra-crisp, dry finish, perfect for the style. This is one of those beers that is a pleasure to enjoy just for the sake of relaxation after a hot summer day or for analyzing and dissecting the flavors.

Smells like a tropical fruit salad. A sweet, light to medium beer with a rush of piney hop taste that gives to some orange & citrus hop zest. Quite bitter - can almost feel the hop resins coat my teeth. A very nice summer beer loaded on hops. The ABV does kick in after a number of these daddys.

As it poured, it looked very yellow, but once in the glass, it settled into a solid golden color with a good head with excellent retention and lacing. First sniff yielded floral hop aromas and...for some reason (on the first sniff)..peach. Yeah, I know it sounds odd, but that's what I smelled, and I DID like it. It drifted into the fruity/floral hops scent after that. Taste reflected the label with hops in the ingredients listing hops several times. Hoppy with a clean crisp finish.

The smell to me wass IPA-ish, with a pronounced grapefruit and grassy aroma. Mmm, I didn't expect this, but am now excited to have bought this. The taste was also more like an IPA to me than a wheat beer. The grapefruit type taste hit me first, maybe a litte wheat in the background, but just sweep hop and fruity taste all the way through.

Now that I've been drinking it regularly it is my go too chillin in the pool summer beer. Ok enough blah blah blah. Pours like a golden lagerish color with a fluffy white dissipating head, lacing the glass lightly. Smell is slightly citrusy sour, some pine and overall inviting. The taste allows for the hops to blow you away if your expecting a wheat bear or have you grinning a bit if your expecting an IPA. I can taste the bittering grapefruit and some unripe apricots as well as sweet peppers and believe it or not a little wheat beer on the burp.

3.97,-5.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer has a bright orange-tan coloring to it, with no head whatsoever. Pours out with minimal carbonation bubbling, also. Aromas are hoppy, with a slight citrus and nutty sweet blend to it. Well balanced, but somewhat awkward for some reason. The flavors are light on the forward tongue, but burst onto the middle and rear tongue with light, crisp hops, a heavy dose of pepper spicing, citrus tart and sweet, and a slight toasty and breadlike character. The body remains light and crisp, true to the style, but slightly watery initially. The aftertaste is light on the spice, with a good amount of hops flavors and an even bigger amount of citrus sweetness and a slight hint of pineapple. The finish is crisp and clean, with the slightest dryness from the hops. Very tasty.","GarthDanielson","Jun 22, 2011"

4.07,-3.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Left-coast hops and wheat malt. Maybe not the first beer to feature this dynamic duo, but arguably one of the best examples of it. Slight wheat beer haze with a solid white head that retreats to a persistent ring. Lots of classic left-coast citrus hops in the nose, with some pine and grapefruit supporting the lemony main note. Bitterness is solid but in proportion for a beer of medium body. At half this strength it'd make a great lawnmower beer, but full strength it is, and that limits it to a few rounds. Unless hops ain't your thing, it's hard to find any fault with this brew.","MillRat","Jun 12, 2011"

4.3,2.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a clear light orange, with a moderate head made up of small interlocking bubbles. Aroma is hoppy, with some big citrus notes (I'm picking up oranges) coming to the forefront. The wheat character is there, but it's subdued. If I was tasting this blind I probably would call it an IPA or Pale Ale based on the aroma. Taste is pretty stunning. I had several of these the other day and they went down smooth and easy. This beer is bursting at the seams with flavor, with huge fruity IPA notes hitting the palate first, chased by wonderful malt that's highlighted by the wheat. Not all that bitter, which is nice in a beer like this. The second sip showcases more of the hop profile, with big pine and grass notes this time. Malt flavor errs on the sweet side rather than the dry, which means that this one goes down quick and easy - and at 7.3% ABV that's something you may want to monitor. Carbonation is relatively high, but given the wheat character and malt sweetness, that's actually welcome. Tastes like an IPA but it's easy to drink like a Wheat Beer. Fantastic and unique.","eclaycamp","May 15, 2011"

The honey flavor is really noticeable to me and it's very delicious. Very, very mild hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. Mouthfeel is good with a nice level of carbonation that makes form a crisp and clean feel. Overall, this is a good beer with a surprising honey taste. I am surprised to see that it is a wheat ale.

Pours to a bright yellow-orange with a multi-sized bubble foamy head. Head leaves a nice lacing on receding. Taste is a great likeness of the smell. Taste starts with a dandelion like sweet bitterness up front, then transitions into a heavy malt backbone in the middle with a tangy finish and a finish similar to the initial taste. The aftertaste stays bittersweet and fades to a lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is spot on. Lagunitas continues to not disappoint.","mooseisloose","Mar 18, 2011"

Pine becomes more apparent in the mid-palate, and the slight soap character that I picked up on the nose is present on the tongue as well. While the beer isn't especially sweet or malty, it does have a medium-full body from the liberal use of wheat malt. The finish is smoothly bitter and very slightly tangy.

You think from the smell that it is going to be a hop bitter blast (which I don't really care for), but I was surprised that it was very smooth and well balanced with sweet malt husk and yeast flavors. Very well crafted recipe. Extremely drinkable. Definitely not a hop-tea that totally covers up the rest of the ingredients. This one exemplifies what an American IPA can be.","OttoPeeWee","Mar 13, 2011"
4.92,16.9,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Very huge smell of juicy fruits maybe some berry smell in there too and then some sweetness.. what an excellent aroma. This is definitely what I expect from Lagunitas. It still has that juicy fruity hop taste with a spicy hop kick in the beginning and a good almost piney bitter finish at the end. You get a huge sweetness in the middle that blends real well with the tremendous hop flavor and then the wheat finishing in the back with the hop bitterness. The hop profile is very close to their other beers like their regular IPA, Maximus, and Hop Stoopid. ALthough they are all very similar I still like this beer just as much as them. Even though the hops shine the most in this beer that wheat malt really completes it and gives Lagunita's regular hopped up beers a good twist. Definitely recommend this beer its like a wheat IPA.","thebrood1987","Mar 13, 2011"

Slight peppery bite as well. Has a slightly heavier body than I expected from based on its color and pour, but fits right in with the flavor profile. Nice and refreshing beer, leaves just enough hoppy bite to make you want another sip and goes down very smooth. By the end of the glass the alcohol comes out just a tad.

This grapefruit theme continues on to the palate; however, there is perceptible malt finish here.

Smell is very hoppy, with floral and grapefruit notes. As far as smell goes it doesn't share many attributes with a standard wheat ale, it smells more like an APA or an IPA. The taste has a little more wheat in it, but the emphasis is still on the hops not the wheat. Mouthfeel is good, very crisp and refreshing. Overall this beer is similar to gumballhead, but i think I like gumballhead better. I am not sure how I feel about this being a ""wheat beer"" as there isn't a lot of wheat in the taste.

When this one was going down, my impression was that it was another hoppy IPA-ish brew (also called, ""Strong"" from what I've seen). On tap at Founding Farmers in DC, most noticeable factors in this light yellow beer were its huge fruitiness, which is mainly pineapple and citrus. These help bring some sweetness to the fairly strong hop presence. A light beer, light body, pretty high in carbonation. Overall, a respectable beer, but not standard for the style, in the least. Solid.","soupyman10","Oct 03, 2010"

The flavor is much of the same, with a big citrus hop character up front with some pine and a bit of an earthy undercurrent. This one may be an even more hopped-up pale wheat than I remember 3 Floyd's Gumballhead being. The texture is quite dry, and the prickly carbonation doesn't add constructively. Overall, it's an over-hopped light wheat ale that still doesn't compare to a strong pale ale but also loses the qualities of the wheat. Nice and drinkable, but not special.","devilben02","Sep 26, 2010"

The featured hops give a powerful citrus blast to the tastebuds. A larger body than most in the style. Good carbonation without being harsh. A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale is a hoppier, more bitter, and brasher Gumballhead. But it is not as drinkable or enjoyable because of this. A good hop delivery device if that is your thing.","morimech","Sep 26, 2010"

The nose is predominantly hoppy, with a lot of orange and lemon citrusy notes and whispers of floral aromas. Tastewise, the front and mid-palates are remarkably balanced. The malts are caramelly in nature and the hops are consistent with the nose. The hops don't dominate until the finish, which is pretty quick and dry.

A touch of wheat / grain provides some malt balance, but hops are the focus of this beer. Mouthfeel is light, crisp and refreshing - an awesome summertime IPA - errr... ""American Pale Wheat!""

4.07,-3.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Thanks to John @ Granite Liquors. Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. A very pale yellow color with excellent clarity. Has a white head that starts thick, but ends up pretty thin. The thin layer skims the top of the liquid the whole time. Would've gone with a 3.5, but the lacing saved it. Sticks to the glass very well. The smell is awesome, extremely hoppy, well at least for the style. The citrus hops stand out, much like a well hopped APA or a slightly milder IPA. There are some malts that collaborate with the hops, so it finishes with a slight sweetness. The taste is good too, but a slight step down from the smell. Much like the smell, the hops are still the strong point. Tastes of grapfruit and citrus zest, providing a bit of an earthy bitter taste. The malts aren't as strong, but they start everything off with a sweet base. Can't completely figure it out, tastes like they are roasted, , maybe almost over-roasted. It's good, far more malts than many of this style, and the hop to malt ratio is great, however the bitterness to sweetness could be a little better. The mouthfeel has great body to it. I have found many APWA's to be very light, but this is a little closer to medium. My only knock on it is the bitterness comes out a little strong and there is a slight earthy bitter finish that could have been cleaner. Don't get me wrong, it's still great, just me being over-critical. Dispite how I whiny I sound about that I still find the beer very drinkable. Generally not a fan of this style but this ber has given me a healthy curiosity of it, I may try more. I'd definitely drink this more, especially in the summer.","AndyAvalanche","Aug 20, 2010"

And then, the taste, so strong, bitter, and then, bam, like I dunno, Stone IPA or Speakeasy IPA, it just is gone so crisp, like Outkast, so fresh and so clean. Very drinkable, light on the palate and yet so bitter and hoppy. I'm thinkin' crystal malt and simcoe hops all over this one.","Beerandraiderfan","Nov 28, 2009"

Very inviting. Taste follows the nose with a sweet rather than tart citrus (mandarin orange and grapefruit) bitterness on a barely detectable crystal malt backbone ending in a slightly dry finish. A bit warming as well. Mouthfeel was smooth with a light-medium body. Overall, although this offering is not overly complex, I wish this wasn't a limited edition as I really enjoyed this one.

The flavor is equally juicy at first, but they dries out with a bit of plain malted wheat and peppery hop bitterness.

Pours golden with a relatively thin head and excellent clarity. Smells hoppy, tangy, and slightly sweet with notes of bubblegum and citrus. Highly herbal, with some of the same dill notes I've picked up in a few other West Coast hoppy beers recently (with Exponential Hoppiness being the king of that flavor). I wonder which hop or combination of hops are giving me that taste? Regardless, I really like the effect- particularly with the tanginess of the wheat and the fruity sweetness of the yeast. I love the taste of this. Tangy and herbal, piney and citrusy, and fruity all together. Extremely smooth, followed by a spritzy finish.

But again, the taste is heavily hopped flavors: grapefruit, citrus, lemon rind maybe if i really stretch it. The mouth feel is medium and well carbonated.

Full-bodied, layers itself thickly onto the tongue, luckily has a consistent carbonated fizz to create as much prickle as grip. No duh, the tangerine and pink grapefruit citrus continues to hog the stage while other hops inspired flavors such as pine, flowers and tea leaf don't do too shabbily for themselves.

Does that make this beer good or bad?? Either way, it's very tasty and refreshing for the summer.","Pencible","Jul 01, 2009"

Upon pouring, it appears a slightly hazy gold with a huge meringue-like head that for a few moments sat higher than the rim of my glass. Immediately, lots of piney and citrusy hops in the aroma, and a touch of banana. While quite bitter, the flavor is balanced by sweet malt, almost honey-like, but the hops never stop asserting themselves. There's also some tangy orange/tangerine. Searching for wheat, I failed. Perhaps it keeps the body on the lighter end of medium, but it's not even on the label where ingredients are listed. Anyhoo,the carbonation is gentle and the hops give the mouthfeel slickness. As with some other Lagunitas brews, I find the aroma to be its best characteristic, but it's also quite drinkable. Light, but packed full of hoppy flavor.

First of all, the aroma just jumps out of this pint glass with bright citrus tones and fruitiness and a little yeast ester. The appearance is a slightly hazed copper with a dirty white head. Flavor is bright and vibrant as well. To me, this one would compare favorably to another wheat/APA hybrid that I know of...New Glarus Cracked Wheat. This one tilts more on the side of APA though whereas the Cracked Wheat is more balanced and the Wheat properties are more distinguished. The flavor here is bright and vibrant with citrus hop qualities. The 64.2 IBU really doesn't scathe that much. Wheat characteristics are light and in the background. Carbonation is pretty vigorous and this would pare nicely with a lot of different kinds of foods. All in all, a nice beer.","Bighuge","Jun 23, 2009"

4.7,11.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"pours a clear(some haze) golden yellow color.a beautiful reminder of summertime it has a great 1/2 head and exceptional lacing..the smell is great its pine and hops and grapefruit with a gumball smell..its very nice..the taste is superb it starts with hops and grapefruit that just permeate the taste buds there is a sweet gum, fruit taste that is ever so slight with a slight wheat and malt taste that is all in perfect balance with the hops that are in charge..taste is perfect the mouthfeel is everything b4 mentioned except to tell you that this is just a smooth and creamy wheat ...im going to call this one an IMPERIAL WHEAT.. i can not believe it is 7.3 abv...wow if you like 3f gumballhead or hop stoopid this one is a combination of both but better than either.. as you can tell highly recommended","gatornation","Jun 08, 2009"
4.47,6.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I had no idea what this beer was when I bought it, but I am glad that Stout @ Plaza Liquors recommended it. Listed as a Pale Wheat Ale I expected something completely different. This is more like an IPA really, like a slightly smaller version of Hop Stoopid in my opinion. Crisp with a blast of citrus hops, for me that is very drinkable, because I like less malty balance in my IPA's. Highly recommended, I will be buying more...","bennetj17","Jun 07, 2009"
4.37,3.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Saw this new one and picked up a single to try. I was really impressed, tastes a lot like Gumballhead but with more kick. I will definitely grab another sixer or two of this, if the ABV was down in the 5's it would be case worthy. Good stuff!","Mdog","Jun 07, 2009"
4.74,12.6,4,5,5,3,5,"Recently drank a bunch of Sumpin sumpin at the City Pages Beerfest in Minneapolis. Great beer, was one of the staples besides surly at the fest. The apperance was a golden orange, decent head. The smell was heaven, grapefruits and hops, with a little malt to it. Tastes just like it smells, grapefruit, hops, sweet finish, citrusy! Mouthfeel was slightly oily with a tiny bitterness. great american pale wheat ale. not much wheat to it which was surprising to me.","smittyjr","Jun 06, 2009"

3.95,-6.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Another hoppy ass beer from Lagunitas. Love it! Wheat hugh? Id have never known. Hazy, orange and smelly. Good smelly. Hoppy smelly. Very pungent orange, mango, apricot, grapefruit...yup I think they are all present. Sweet malts and hops, or is that sweet hops and malts? Very tropical and juicey. Smooth, gentle bitterness for such a strong, hoppy beer. Yeah, really drinkable.","mjryan","Jun 05, 2009"

4.22,0.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"I will avoid the seemingly mandatory name-based joke for my review of this stellar new beer from Laggy. This one apparently is replacing Sirius as their summer 6er seasonal. While I was initially a tad disappointed to not be getting that high-grav cream ale, one whiff of Little Sumpin' quickly satisfied my sense of loss. In their continuing quest to confuse and delight brew consumers, Lagunitas is marketing this as a pale wheat ale. Hmmm. I would love to see the facial contortions of a Blue Moon drinker as they took their first sip of this unabashedly hoppy west coast IPA that HAPPENS to be brewed with a bit 'o' wheat in the grain bill. Light gold in color with a fine pearly head. WHAMMY! Pungent, citrusy hops tickle you even from a foot away. I get pithy pink grapefruit, tangerine and lemon/lime. The sauv. blanc of beer anyone? The flavor follows suit with sharp, especially citrusy, hops that fade at their own pace. We got a tongue-dangler here folks. Wheat? What wheat? I get a touch of tang mingled nicely with the hops and I suppose it lightens the body as this beer is retardedly drinkable. Hello new favorite summer beer. Lagunitas, here is yet another tip 'o' the hat to you for concocting a new, clearly not BJCP-approved, but crazy tasty style of beer. Take a bong hit for your trouble dudes and keep brewing how you brew.","cthulu81","Jun 04, 2009"
4.14,-1.7,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,"What is this, anyway? It says it's a wheat beer but it tastes like and IPA and a good one at that. Nice and hoppy and smooth. Defintite pine flavors. The alcohol is hiding somewhere but you won't find it until later. This is a nice effort. I'm looking forward to the next bottle.","jsapunor","Jun 04, 2009"
4.45,5.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This was just released and you could tell how fresh this beer tasted. I would consider this an IPA based on look, smell, and taste. I have just discovered my new summer of 2009 beer.","mjl21","Jun 03, 2009"

3.72,-11.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Clear gold with a little coppery glimmer. Ecru head leaves some nice lacing. Super hoppy aroma with pine and grapefruit galore. Requisite wheaty notes and very little malt. Flavor is grassy and grapefruit zesty with some astringency. Notes of pineapple, pale malt. Very effervescent mouthfeel, smooth wheaty body. Good drinkability. Basically a wheat IPA.","illidurit","Jun 02, 2009"

4.44,5.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a clear golden, yellow,and amber with some carbonation with a medium sized head. The smell is very pungent with a huge citrus hop aroma,grapefruit,orange,pine,and bread yeast. A very nice smell. The taste has a blast of citrus flavor,grapefruit,lime,bread yeast,alcohol,and pine. This is really a good brew. The m/f is light with all the flavors mixing very well. This is a true classic beer. Cheers","jmz62565","May 30, 2009"
4.32,2.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"The beer is a relatively pale, bright golden liquid with a good white head that sticks around for quite awhile. The nose has a strong pine/grapefruit aroma. It's a bit like a Sierra Nevada Torpedo mixed with a San Diego-style IPA. I always find hop bill descriptions hard; it's a fairly unique flavor with many variations. At any rate, this beer is aggressively hopped. It has a good level of bitterness. The grain does not get in the way of the hops all that much. I believe that there's wheat in there, but it's not a strong presence, just background noise at best. So, why not throw some wheat in your IPA? I'm not complaining.","popery","May 29, 2009"
4.55,8.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"The last few Lagunitas beers I've had have been great, but they all taste like IPA/DIPA variants. As a hophead, I like that. It may grow old for others.","caskstrength","May 28, 2009"
