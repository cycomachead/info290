"O: [2.50] I really don't like the Belgian wheat flavor.  The nose let me know that this was going to be not a hit for me."
""
"Overall:  Boulder’s Sweaty Betty is a decent beer.  It has the traditional flavors of a wheat beer, which is why I’m not a huge fan of it.  Fans of wheat beers should really like this beer though."

"07/25/12 On tap. Lemony with out being citrusy, not that that's a bad thing. Clean finish with a medium body."
"Fair summer refresher out of Boulder, and a better choice than what you'll find at many summer parties."

"This beer is actually a really good beer. I actually liked it a lot. I know that I will have this beer again. I liked the smell and the taste to this beer. It has a smooth taste to it. It is not a heavy beer and I liked that avout this beer. I know that I will have this beer again. I also will recomend it to friends and family as well."

"Pours a light hazy straw yellow in color with a 1/2-finger of a fizzy white head that settles down to along the sides of the glass. Lots of streaming bubbles rising up from the bottom and sides of the boot. Very little lacing is seen. The aroma is of malts and wheat with a hint of light spice. The taste is pretty much the same with a light hint of citrus as well. Very easy to drink with no bitter or harsh aftertaste. A great summer seasonal brew for a hot day. Overall, I like this one."

""
"Pours a hazy light yellow with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. No lacing on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, caramel, banana, and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with banana and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with a nice smell, but the flavors aren't as good in my opinion."

"Mixed feelings on this one. If the carbonation and flavors were turned up a notch I think I would like it a lot. As it is, I could see this being a satisfactory choice on a hot day. I'd definitely drink it again, but won't go out of my way to find it."

"I know when I reach for a tasty beverage, the first thing that comes to mind is ""sweat""... Anyway, this stuff pours a hazy brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises cracked wheat, banana peel, light orange peel, and a dash of muddled spices. The taste brings in more of the same, with a heavy bready component leading the charge. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a middling beer at best, one that just kinda sits there with little or no distinguishing character of its own. Sure, I suppose this could be used as a nice enough thirst-quencher in the Summer months, but it's just kinda bland for my tastes beyond that."
""

"Overall- A big let down. I got it from a bar that offered a ton of different beers to maybe it was a stale keg but I probably wont try this again."

"O: I'm not a huge fan of Boulder Beer, but this wheat ale is far from bad. Some may not like the slightly muddled character, but I kind of appreciate it. I would not go out of my way to find this again, but I wouldn't have a problem knocking back one of these if it were readily available."

"Best Beer I have ever had, and it comes with a healthy kick too! I want MORE!! It is a spring beer that only comes around once a year, but I anticipate having this beer and beg my supplier to have it in stock for me. From the great, clean taste to the appearance and feel of this beer, it gets consistent high marks from me."

"12 ounce bottle into weizen glass, best before 1/25/2013. Pours very hazy golden amber color with a nice 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big lemon, banana, clove, wheat, pear, pepper, light bubblegum, earth, grass, floral, and yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance. Taste of lemon, wheat, banana, clove, floral, grass, orange zest, earth, coriander, light bubblegum, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of lemon, banana, wheat clove, light pepper, earth, grass, floral, light bubblegum, and coriander. Nice balance and complexity of flavors; a bit more watered down than I expected; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice wheat ale. Nice amount of hefeweizen flavor complexity and balance; and extremely smooth to drink. Definitely an enjoyable offering."
""
"It's mostly cloudy and yellow with a very weak head. The Tate is nice add yeasty as it should be. The overall impression is of a light to medium wheat. It is similar to the bottle and somewhat disappointing."
""
""
""
"It also has a higher ABV at nearly 6 percent, but without the heavier spirit taste. You'd never know it from the taste. It goes down like a 4.8, so beware...it's smooth and w/. The higher alcohol content could pack a punch...."

"Overall this is just a thin bodied, slightly sweet, something wheaty beer, with few high points, even on a warm day."
""
"Overall I can say this is definitely one of my favorite beers to date. I am a huge fan of wheat beers, though. For someone looking for an incredible amount of flavor you might want something else, but for an easy drinking and delicious beer you can't beat one of these. I'd love to try it on tap at some point."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - My buddy recommended this beer, and I think maybe he was playing an evil trick on me. Terribly weak from nearly every possible angle, this is not a wheat beer that I'd care to try again."
"Overall –Very easy drinking, but a little subtle and boring for the most part."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A very tasty blonde wheat ale. Excellent for a hot summer july evening."
""
"Cheers!"
"Crisp, Clean and refreshing. I will buy over Harpoon and SA. Certainly will suit the non-traditional Hefe taster as it may seem ""light"" to those more experienced palates. Also, checks in at 5.9% but doesn't taste like it. I loved the finish and after taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Fits very hot weather, as it's extremely light, but I'd like more flavour..."
""
""
""
"Overall, I just didn't like this beer, period. Everything from it's appearance to taste had something about it i didn't like. I also don't like the 5.9% for a wheat beer, seems a bit high. However I don't regret trying it and I'll finish the sixer. Just not again."
""
""
""
"O: This is a nice little beer and like I said perfect for what it is: an easy drinking and refreshing summer beer; I think Boulder did a nice job with this one and when I want something like this again, I will return"
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice summer brew from Boulder. Simple and quenching. 4.0"
"O- Has some good qualities for a wheat: light, floral, refreshing. Although not a style I usually go for, this one is good"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not bad for a wheat ale, as you may know already I haven't had many, but this one isn't bad for what it is. A pleasant little beer with a good unique character. Works for me!"
""
"Pours a light straw yellow with not much head to speak of. The taste has a nice wheat character with hints of banana throughout it. It also has a nice dry taste that makes it a great beer for a hot sunny day. Carbonation is fizzy but works well as a whole. Not my favorite style but its a decent beer for sure."
""
""
""
""
"O. It is a refreshing beer, but if you are looking for something with a little flavor or complexity, you've been barking up the wrong tree."
"Overall this one is an excellent beer and I would love to buy it again."
""
"A pretty decent wheat ale, good flavor character and otherwise solid in everything you would expect from a wheat brew, would have again."

"O: I'm not crazy about the style but this is one of the better offering for the style. These types often taste ""cheap"" this one doesnt. That said I wont seek it out."
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent one, although flawed. The balance of flavor is there, just lacks strength/intensity of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Easy going taste, discernably wheat, mild flavors of banana and lemon, grass. Hopping is prolly around 30 ibu. Relatively balanced, mildly sweet, a little metallic bitterness creeps into the mouthfeel, what was once a small dallop of tartness gets progressively more aggressive as the metal exerts itself. Made me wonder if this was part of the weird pallet of boulder beer come into Reno recently."
""
""
""
""
""
"Conclusion: Fine work by Boulder Beer. This is a very light beer and I think it would work amazingly on cask in the summer, or out of a growler at least (less carbonation). For some reason I always had the impression that this wasn't a worthwhile beer, and I am happy to be corrected. Boulder Beer sticks mostly to mainstream styles, but they do them well."

"Sweaty Betty is definitely a dishwater blonde...she's sorta weak altogether. Now look, if you do not like the traditional skunk of a heffe...then you may actually enjoy this. The appearance when poured was cloudy and not in a good way. The nose was a metallic skunk reminding me of fennel. The head was short-lived at best but it kicked up high initially like a wheat should. I expect a fruity experience from an American wheat....totally disappointed as were my Beer Geeks."

" ~ This is a fine sessioning beer. The flavor is good and the rest of the beer makes it an easily consumed beverage that I would certainly recommend to friends and would like to see offered in 12 packs."
"O: Better than many of the other ""hefeweizens"" out there, but I'd be fine not having this again."
"Drink- This was pretty tasty for an extra. I’m not normally the biggest blonde fan so I was skeptical at first but after seeing the reviews and bottle closely. Its more pale wheat above all else. Good beer for a hot day."
"Poured on-tap at La Festa Brick and Brew in Dover, NH. The beer was poured in a pint glass, and it settles into a pale, unfiltered look, with a musty yellow coloring and lots of carbonation. There is a thin, quarter-inch small-bubbled head. The nose is citrusy, with lemon zest and butter characteristics. The beer's flavors are light and crisp, with a slight toasting and underlying citrus sweetness. The aftertaste is minimal, but with a zesty and tangy fruit sweetness. The finish is a little sweet and syrupy. Good light brew for a hot day, but not anything extraordinary in terms of substance."
"Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer has an easy-drinking quality about it. The body, while not thick, definitely has a meatiness to it that really helps the flavors stand out. The carbonation is a little fizzy but does not seem to detract from the flavors."
"M - There's some crispness, a thin body, and a slightly dry finish."
"Sweaty Betty is Boulder Beer’s entry into the wheat beer style. I personally love wheat beers - they’re refreshing, taste like a meal, and have a wonderful consistency and high standard between breweries, with enough flexibility in style and character to make each one different. Boulder Beer’s wheat feels less like a unique brew than others (Easy Street Wheat, for example, tastes very different) but remains an deeply satisfying beer. The aroma is strong and seducing, packed with lemon, white grapes, and the by now familiar coupling of banana esters and a touch of exotic clove. The flavor is less thrilling, losing much of its depth in a haze of heavy carbonation. I mostly detect wheat and corn tortilla flavors, gradually panning out to include some banana on the tongue, but tragically little. The Sweaty Betty is still a fair sample of the style, and I hope to set it aside and drink it in comparative calm and quiet. However, as a coaster-dampener for a cool summer evening it fared admirably, even if not spectacularly. The memory of that evening belongs to the grill and the sunset, not the beer."
"It pours out a pale straw colored beer, pretty cloudy, with a small and short-lived white head topping it off. The nose consists of wheat grain and pale malt, with some hints of floral hop and lemon zest. The taste starts off with pale malt, a fair amount of wheat grain, a bit of sweetness, and finishes with a splash of lemon juice, and a light, floral hop background. A bit of spice as well. Maybe just a hint of banana as well, a taste I more often associate with Hefes than filtered wheats. Light mouthfeel and pretty refreshing."
"A bright and easy-drinking session ale -- quite enjoyable."
"Overall, this is quite good beer, and unique enough in flavor to set itself apart from many of its peers. The brew is balanced and flavorful, and would, I suspect, be quite thirst-quenching in mid-summer. Worth trying."
"O-Not bad. I'd buy it again for some sort of summer event."
"A nice summer Ale, got on Growler, poured a yellow gold color with minimal head. looks and smells prett unassuming but It's got a nice taste of wheat and yeast with a touch of clove maybe some sort of other fruit to, goes down really smooth nice and refreshing, not to much of a bite but thats alright."
"O: An average wheat beer that goes down smoothly on a hot summer day, but by no means one of the better wheat beers out there."
"Overall - not a bad brew at all, and I think a good representation of a wheat ale."
"O-Overall this is an OK wheat beer. Would drink this on a hot summer day, but probably wouldn't actively seek it out again. There's better wheat beers out there."
"Overall, a solid brew, but nothing above normal or setting it apart. Quite drinkable and decent taste, a little off and light on the nose with average presentation."
"Overall wow to surprised those expecting to review to style? Fail for the brewery. But for a guy expecting the typical blonde. It drank rather well. Kudos guys this is a nice brew."
"Overall i wasnt too impressed after hearing a story how its an american wheat, it wasnt light bodied or light yeast tasting like a lot of american wheats, more of a hef or wit"
"M – Light body. Shade watery. Underwhelming carbonation."
"overall - this might not be the best or even in the top 10 in pale wheats but i could knock back many of these on a hot summer day - this is on par with goose 312 without the lemon"
"The feel is light and the carbonation is a bit prickley. Overall, nothing bad but nothing great. I don't see myself going back to this one, but I wouldn't turn it away."
"Sweaty Betty pours out like a typical wheat beer with some haze but also seems a bit lighter in color. The aroma smells soft like wheat and some banana. The taste is on the light side, almost too light for a wheat beer in my opinion. The mouthfeel is very drinkable and easy going. I just wish this beer was a little bit more flavorful. It really doesn't have many bragging rights. There are better wheat beers out there than this one."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow with a moderate white head and a lively carbonation which helps retain the head thoughout most of the brew. The nose is bright with mostly wheat- influenced flavors- aromas of banana, peach, white clove- and maybe a faint touch of hoppy flowers. The palate is medium-bodied and creamy with a smooth delivery and flavors of banana, lemon and vanilla leading to a moderate, fruity and mouthwatering finish. This isn't my favorite style, but it's done well for the style."
"O - This is my second beer out of a Boulder Mix Pack, and I'm starting to sense a pattern. Is this an amazing beer or a shining example of the style? No. Is it highly drinkable and relatively enjoyable? Yes; in fact, I could see giving this to some non-craft beer drinking friends and probably have them enjoy it."
"Poured a hazy yellow with a small frothy white head that was mostly diminishing and had fair lacing. The aroma was very light of grain malts, flowery hops, sweet yeast and a nice hint of citrus. It tasted sweet and yeasty at first and finished with a light sweet yeast and citrus flavor that lasted a decent amount of time. Mouthfeel was light in body and a little watery in texture. Overall a very nice Blonde Wheat Ale, great for the warm weather (not to heavy, but not to light)."
"A quality beer that should be consumed over and over. One of my new favorites."
"Fairly drinkable--I could enjoy 2 or 3, but any more than that and the sweetness would be too much."
"D-very strong marks here; i had been disappointed with my recent luck with wheat ales, but I found this one quite refreshing and could have quite a few of these"
"Pours cloudy golden yellow with touches of very white foam. Smells wheaty, with some banana notes. Full wheaty taste with underlying lemon citrus throughout. Smooth mouthfeel, residual tang. Very drinkable, and quite tasty. Refreshing, to boot."
"D- Very tasty and easy to drink."
"D - pretty solid APWA. I don't know if I would necessarily go out of my way to get this, but it is a better than average wheat ale."
"D: I marked the drinkability as a 4, good, because again, for the style, it is above average and I could have quite a few of these (if in the mood for a light refreshing, summer beer)"
"D: A mix between a Hefeweizen and a Blue Moon. Awesome beer! Easy for a new beer drinker or a party beer."
"D: very refreshing for a beer and likely to have a few on a hot summer day/night."
"I'm impressed by this beer's drinkability and character. I'm not exactly sure what separates this from a hefe, but it's definitely a tasty summer option."
"On tap on a whim, not the best decision, but OK I guess. Pours a pale yellow with little head. Nose is wit-beer-esque, lemony notes, a bit of spice, some wheatiness to it too. Taste follows with the same notes, but there's something off here that I can't quite put my finger on. Light and refreshing body, not a terrible beer, but probably not one I would order again."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, dry coriander and cinnamon. In the taste, cinnamon and a lemon zest. A spicy bite, with a medium to light mouthfeel, and a dry spice to clean aftertaste. Nice spices and easy to drink and decent."
"This is like a blonde ale/pale wheat hybrid. I think it mostly succeeds."
"Easy session beer on a hot day."
"D - Served cold enough this beer would go down easy and refresh on a hot day. Save it for the poolside."
"The body is light and, with a moderate carbonation and a good crispness, this one is pretty refreshing."
"It's a good hot day drinker but I wouldn't get it again."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle marked Oct 07 2010 and sampled on August 17, 2010. The pour is pale yellow and very cloudy with a thinner but slightly foamy white head that never quite fades. Banana, wheat, and yeast aromas are the first to greet the nose. The taste is about the same with a comforting fresh hop ending. Really not all that bad and fairly easy to drink."
"Not an earth shattering beer by any means, but a solid, quality summer wheat ale that is both light and delicious."
"Taste is light with not as much spiciness that I would have expected from this style of beer. Though it hides its 5.9 ABV rather well. Overall it is pretty light and refreshing and makes a nice summertime drink."
"Overall, this is not a good wheat ale as there is a definite lack of taste throughout. Maybe if they dropped the price and marketed this as a cheap lawnmower beer it would be worth it."
"if your looking for a beer that is light and refreshing for summer, id go with this one"
"Poured gold with less than one finger of white, poor retention, and spotty lacing. Not much of a nose besides some modest banana and lemon. Very thin flavor profile, and raw bitter finish. Definitely missing more fruit balance. Thin bodied and decently carbonated. Nice feel for sessioning, but unfortunately not enough flavor."
"M/D: medium bodied and feels slightly harsh in the mouth. Drinkability is ok but not something I like to continue drinking."
"D- an easy drinking and mild brew with some citrus character. it's nice for summertime- light, thirst quenching, refreshing, etc. but as far as being bavarian style i could appreciate a bit more yeast spiciness."
"O This is not my style. I like wheat beers, but prefer the banana flavors over the apple, it's a personal thing I know. It is worth a try, but I'm glad I don't have a six pack."
"D: Very typical for the style. A nice beer that succeeds but fails to stand out. The persistently sweet finish is a nice touch, but would prevent me from really throwing these back."
"Rockies Brewing Company--Boulder Beer Company sweaty betty blonde wheat beer--Looking Glass Series 5th Release--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 5.90% ABV. 12 IBU's? (3.5 / 5.0) Wheat Ale--Wit? Thin lace fizzy thin white head. Clear thin white gold color hazes dark lemon with light sediment. Coriander wheat mild banana minor hop front. Thin dry sweet crisp citrus banana zesty wheat spice Belgian Wit hint body. Refreshing tangy clean citrus spice end. Sampled 6/14/2010. 6 Pack $8.99."
"Notes: great for drinking after a nice long bike ride, very refreshing."
"All in all, not bad. Drinkability is high and with the warm weather, Sweaty Betty is a welcome face. A funky colored face with some interesting flavors and pungent aroma, but a drinkable face none the less."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden straw color with a tiny white head quickly fades to a ring on the top. Smells of banana clove, spicy wheat, and a hint of phenolic. Taste is sweet upfront followed by a clove and banana assault with a hint of lemon in there. A spicy tartness rounds us off with maybe a hint of metallic. Is this a pale wheat? Hefeweisen? Lines are very blurry. Medium body, tart and syrupy mouthfeel, medium level of carbonation. Not my favorite beer by any stretch. Its light and easy to drink, might be good on a hot summer day, but its kind of bland with nothing really exciting happening."
"This beer is what I would consider a staple. Sweaty Betty offers a light, easy to drink banana undertone, with a thin, wispy head of average retention. When you are going with an alternative brew, this is a decent candidate! Don't let the negative reviews keep you from trying it at the very least."
"I liked this beer a LOT. It was very clean and had a banana note along with a nice mouthfeel and a crisp finish. I had a couple of six packs of this over the summer and they went down easy and although it's not easy to find here, I will be hunting for it in the future. It makes a nice replacement for the Abita strawberry lager that I REALLY love but can't get very often."
"Betty hasn't improved her diet, her sweat is still funky, and not in the good way."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a small head. Smell is of citrus and spices. Taste like it smells, spices and citrus, quite delicious. Feels full bodied in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall this is a high quality brew."
"D: The funkified finish in this beer absolutely killed it for me. Initially an ok representation of the style, but it went downhill and fast. I won't be getting this one again."
"Strong wheat and banana ester aromas bubble out of this well carbonated brew. White head forms on the top of a beautifully hazy blond color. Wheat and banana flavors dominate the palate and are well balanced with just the right amount of spice. Smooth fruity finish fades gracefully away."
"D - A good offering in a category that seems to be rife with simply ""fair"" beers. I would recommend this one for those ""not quite summer yet"" spring days."
"Very light-bodied refresher that has quite a bit of flavor. The aroma of the beer says hefe more than the taste. There is a touch of cloviness, but the crisp wheat is the main flavor. The light mouthfeel of the beer even allows some mild hop notes through. A pretty good beer that I would drink some more of, I like the name and the label as well."
"...or not. Well, that's a little too harsh. The beer is best described as weak. All the flavours on the nose are in the beer - I think, but they are so weak they can be scarcely tasted save my hunting for them. The beer seems watered down as it has a very low carbonation. There is a higher maltiness (at least I think that's what it is) at the outset, and it finishes with a some citrus before it all too quickly falls off the palate as though I had never consumed it. It's a beer I could drink lots of simply because it doesn't feel like much, but that doesn't mean I would want to drink that much of it."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable! I just wish I had this on a warm summer afternoon by the grill instead of holed up in my house watching snow fall outside. I will certanly revisit this one once the spring hits."
"D - Easy drinking by flavor, although I would find this to be a pairing beer. Something I would put with a meal to counteract its stronger flavors. ABV is a cut above for a wheat, so this may knock you out as it refreshes you."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a hazy pale yellow color with a thin white head that left no lacing. The aroma of this brew is a little disappointing (I am a fan of the Boulder Brew, especially the anniversary brews). It is a little wet grassy smelling and has some banana and slight hop notes. The taste is a little bland with a higher carbonation than anticipated. The most dominant is banana with a light malt backbone and a little bitter hop finish. This is by far the least tasty of the brews I have had from them as of late. Good thing picked it up as a single."
"M/D - Light mouthfeel, and nice carb. Average wheat with common wheat, pepper, yeasty notes. A touch watery, but might be nice on a hot day."
"D: I was impressed with this one overall. One of the better beers I've had from Boulder Beer. It's a nice refresher that seems best suited to warm summer days. Definitely worth a revisit."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I tried to be as fair as possible while reviewing this beer, but this just isn't my favorite style. If you're a fan of wheat beers then I see no reason why you wouldn't enjoy this blonde for an evening."
"Drinkability> refreshing, easy. Good one for a pitcher in the sunshine with your mates."
" On first sip I knew this one had missed its mark, not by much, but definately not an award winner. It is not balanced between the yeast, the hops, the concept, at all. Sweaty Betty turned out to be a very appropriate moniker, as this beer really did taste kind of sweaty. I want to try the beer this would have been without the 10k it just ran behind it. It has promise underneath it's hesitant, and unfulfilled idea, but for now I will not be purchasing it again."
"M/D - If it wasn't for the smell, the drinkability would be higher. I dread the next sip because I will smell the beer from my glass. The mouthfeel is weak, but that's to be expected given the style."
"Fairly strong aroma is wheaty and yeasty with just a touch of lemon. It pours a slightly hazy straw yellow with a fluffy and none too persistent white head. Flavor is wheaty with a hint of citrus, slightly yeasty, not all that inspiring. Flavor is smooth and fairly tingly, sometimes just a tad watery."
"Tastes moderate malt sweet that carries medium-strong clovey phenol. Also quite yeasty. Mild hop bitter and little hop flavor. Very german in character, is this beer mis-classified here on BA as an American Pale Wheat? Judged to category listed here on BA. Wet on the tongue, but dries out in the finish accompanied by a gentle peppery sting. Some creaminess in mouthfeel and modest carbonation. Epic fail for the style, but a decent german wheat."
"On tap at Smoken Joe's. Served in a 16 oz mug. Probably the most yellow and cloudy looking pale wheat ale I've had. Almost looked like a witbier. Super faded yellow in color. Thin white head. Clove smell. Not overly flavorful though, which was a bit of a letdown. It was good, but it was not bursting at the seams with all the flavors I love from a wheat beer. That said, it was mighty smooth and easy to drink from a large glass. Almost too easy to drink, as it went down fast. If only I enjoyed it more before it was gone...oh well. I'd order one again."
"Poured into my weizen glass a murky pale yellow with a decent-sized off-white head on top. Very little lacing sticks to the glass. Smells of bananas, light spices, and bread. The mouth was crisp and bubbly. A little wet, but not that bad. The flavor is a little zesty to start with, but it finishes bready and grainy. Sort of a Cheerio flavor going on. This is more like a Hefe rather than a Pale Wheat. Not bad, but a little different than I expected. Refreshing, nonetheless."
"D - Very drinkable wheat beer."
"D: Although this beer is dangerously drinkable and rings in at 5.9% ABV, it just doesn't have much flavor. While this could definitely be downed easily, there are much cheaper beers out there for that purpose."
"D-Given the right place and time, this beer would hit the spot (though that can probably be said about just about any beer), especially on a hot summer Saturday afternoon. That said, for sitting down and enjoying a brew, this beer is of average quality and not my favorite of Boulder's lineup."
"Sweaty Betty Blonde is a slightly hazy pale straw colored beer with a thin white head that disappears. It doesn't leave any lacing. There isn't much aroma; a hint of lemon and maybe banana and apple. It's pretty light bodied but soft and fluffy with a clean, bubbly finish. It tastes simple and light but well balanced and clean. Pear oil is present, but not strong. Even the bitterness seems fruity. It's tangy and refreshing."
"T/M: The palate is a lot more of the nose. A nice dose of hops gives this beer some great character and a cool crispness that lends itself well to hot summer days. The hops are grainy, perhaps a touch citrusy which nicely complements the wheat. Medium to light bodied with a nice amount of carbonation, even though the head is almost gone."
"The guy who sold the bottle to me gave this beer a lot of praise. Pours a cloudy witbier blond with a disappointing soda fizz for a head. Smells good, though. Cloves, banana, yeasty sweet rolls. Altogether makes for an enticing aroma. Tastes just like it smells. For my taste it badly needs more carbonation. Rather than dancing on the tongue or delivering a refreshing feel, its body feels flat and lifeless, a bad quality in a summer beer. All in all, it tastes good and is worth trying but needs that extra carbonation to give it some snap."
"This beer isn't the worst. It has a decent ABV that is well masked. It is easy to drink but not the style that I can appreciate fully so I will give the rest of them to my friends who like this style."
"I will not buy this beer again, there are many other better versions of the style. On the plus side you could probably down many of these no problem, you know, if you had a rough day at work or something."
"[Note: I actually put half of it in the glass back in the fridge and came back to it an hour later. It's still really gross on the finish.]"
"Pale yellow and a bit cloudy with a light white head. Mild prickle rising in the glass. The nose has notes that are similar to a white beer/ale as there are grape and wheat characters that I can pickup. Mild attack and clean flavor with a breaking malt finish that results in a dry and clean aftertaste. The flavor just seems to break away as it leaves the mouth. The beer causes me to think of the white ale from New South Brewing in Myrtle Beach, SC only the sweaty Betty isn't as good."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a slight head to it. The smell is of wheat with hints of some floral notes. The overall taste is of wheat with hints of some citrus hop notes. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth. The drinkability of this is okay, there is nothing to make you dislike the beer, but there is nothing to make you sit up and say hey i really like that."
"I'm a big fan of the style, and Sweaty Betty doesn't quite hold up against some of my favorites. But if you hand me one this summer, I'm going to be happy to see it every time."
"poured a pale, straw color with little head, no lace. smelles a mix of citrus and spice. can note some hops. very bland taste, like watered down citrus. very light feel, not very refreshing for the citrusy smell taste. not very impressed, but then again, i got it for free"
"D - This is a very good hot weather beer, just what the doctor ordered. A little underrated, I am a fan of this beer."
"d- very drinkable on a nice hot day, i'd have another one."
"D: great summer beer when its really hot and your not doing anything"
"Drinkability - This broad would be good on a hot day, but the bananas may overwhelm some palettes."
"Close resemblance to the spicy Belgian Whites. Lots of wheat, providing a souring finish. Very highly carbonated; tiny bubbles, there's some body to counterbalance this, but it is still quite spritzy on the tongue."
"Drinkability: Very much so. A pretty good representation of this style. Recommended"
"A very decent pale wheat. Appearance is golden with some head and almost no lacing. Smell is good but a bit weak with sweet malt and caramel coming through. Taste has a bit more of dry fruit on the back end but other than that prety straight forward. Mouthfeel is right on par, well carbonated and light. Drinkability is good."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a crisp light yellow with a decent off-white head that diminishes to a thin layer. Aroma is slight Earthy hops, sweet malts and sweet fruit. Taste is a nice blend of wheat and hops with a hint of spice and bubblegum. The beer is quite light crisp and refreshing. This is a decent summer beer."
"D: Easily drinkable. Decent flavors, certainly nothing offensive - just nothing special either."
"Easy drinking summer beer in my opinion."
"D - decent, nothing too extreme makes this a perfect warm weather beer."
"Not bad. I like it and it's easy to drink and could be sessionable as well"
"Betty will be in my rotation as long as she's around."
"D: I sipped the 1st, for reviewing, then, the 2nd was gone in a several large quaffs. I'll buy it again. Problem is, there are SO many good choices now for warm weather beer."
"Pours a cloudy, yellow color. 5/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of earthy malt, biscuit, lemon, and some tart malt. Fits the style of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with a average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight lemon, yeast cleanliness, some biscuit mustiness, and slight hop in the background. Overall, a good bodied beer with a slightly off aroma, but still worthy of a try."
"D: It is definitely drinkable - easy to drink, decent flavors. Not a preference, however. Would drink again if offered, but probably not buying a six pack of this stuff..."
"Even when I gulped down the first sip, all I could taste was that yest-filled armpit smell in my mouth. It was bad. I usually like wheat ales, but this one was a loser."
"D: Very nice summer brew.... I'll grab a few this summer..."
"Quite good and refreshing for the style. Wheats have never been my cup of rea, but this is great for the style."
"Out of a 22oz bottle this beer was a slightly hazy pale gold color with tons of visible rising carbonation. The head was off-white, a full three fingers high, displayed modest retention as a cap and left some scattered lacing. The aroma was floral hops, wheat, lemon and orange zest and doughy malt. The flavors were much like a witbier, sweet citrus tang up front with wheat in the middle and some pale malt flavors in the background. Simple but pleasant enough. The flavors do seem to compete with each other a little, however. The body was medium, the mouthfeel a little watery and the carbonation good."
"Notes from 12/27/05"
"A decent beer but not one I would seek out."
"Overall, a pretty bland mix of a hefeweizen and a wit."
"This beer pours a semi-cloudy pale orange color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly for a wheat beer into a thin cap of lacing. The aroma is of of orange peel, lemon zest, and tangy wheat. The aroma is tangy, with only hints of the lemon and orange peel from the aroma. The mouthfeel is thin and water; not what I would expect from even an American wheat beer. Overall, this is a decent beer that I could drink again."
"Sweaty Betty is a very drinkable wheat beer but it's very lacking in looks, smell, and taste."
"Mouthfeel is full flavored with a medium body."
"M/D - Light to medium bodied and a little on the chewy side. Very average wheat ale."
"D: All in all, this is an alright beer, but not something I'd come back to. The sweet quality of the taste is a little to cloying, but there is a decent amount of complexity to it."
"D: Great summer session beer. I could drink a lot of these, not a bad beer at all. 3.5"
"Drinkability is moderate. Very sessionable, but kind of boring and uninspiring."
"Drinkability: Just a light, lightly sweet, something wheaty beer, though it's a fine quaffer for hot summertime Atlanta drinking."
"D: Easy to drink and a nice summer offering from Boulder. It's not the best Looking Glass series beer, but it's enjoyable enough spin on a usually boring and underwhelming style."
"Drinkability - Even though it tastes a bit fair, it finishes well, and leaves a good aftertaste. This has actually become one of my favorite wheat beers."
" Very drinkable given the style. The clean finish is very appealing in a wheat beer."
"A well made blonde/pale wheat. Goes dwn easy and is very enjoyable."
"Sweaty Betty is a nice little APWA that has a definite hefeweizen lean to it. It doesn't have my favorite characteristics of the style, but is definitely one that I will enjoy again."
"A nice dark gold color greeted my beer but not much cloudiness. Decent head that died quickly but left a lace ring around the mug. Weak smell did not give me anticipation for this beer. Very faint clove notes and smelled more like a lime than lemon or orange peel or anything. The taste improved on the smell, thankfully, somewhat. A little weak but a smooth medium-bodied beer that had a little sweetness from the wheat mixed with a decent punch of citric notes, most noticeable was the orange. A little sharp in the backbite but not bad. A light summer beer that isn't bad, but not a standout or anything."
"D: I wish the carbonation was higher on this, but it is still pretty drinkable. Smooth and subtle, but there is some complexity if you look for it."
"An interesting and very drinkable beer. Should make a nice beer for the summer months for sure."
"Pour a very light yellow. Stong aroma of mashed banana. Whispy head that leaves some lacing. Flavor is crisp to start. Slight citrus, good carbonation, refreshing. The end is disappointing as it lacks the depth of flavor from other styles I've tried. I'll try it again to see if its just my allergies messing with my taste buds. Overall I think its a fair representation of the style. Cool artwork on the bottle."
"D - Killer. This is a killer, killer brew for the summer! I could quaff this stuff until I puke....not that I would do something like that, but I could."
"Amazing pour! This unfiltered wheat ale really comes alive in your glass, up-end the bottle and your eyes are givin a real treat. Awesome folds, waves and loops of sediment stay suspended in the beer and slowly settle out. Nice 2 inch white head too. Betty has a solid white ale nose, definitely with some Belgian influence. Solid roasty wheat flavor, Belgian yeast and spicyness, some banana and bland citrus notes. Above average white ale body, very bright carbonation. This one is pretty damn drinkable and chewy. A good choice for the drinker who wants a white ale with a little bit of body and decent character."
"Overall not a bad summer beer, however I would have to pass on trying it again. Just not really up my alley as far as flavor. Nothing wrong with it though and as far as blond ales, not half bad."
"HV"
"Poured into a wheat glass pours a yellow with a serious white head that leaves some nice thick fat lace on the glass. Smell is of summer sweatyness with hints of lemon, tweed, earth and resin, spicy grape. Taste hits the palate, heavy carbonation, taste is a bit toned down I can taste a bit of hop in there, a bit of acid and a light taste of grapefruit. Overall not a bad offering but not a great one either, I could see myself drinking this again though, average at best."
"good carbonation. light body. nice beer. i could do a warm weather session. i would not go out of my way to get this but i would drink again. nice blonde."
"D: Very drinkable in the summertime. Decent summer beer."
"D: I could drink this type of beer frequently. It is a very well rounded American Wheat."
"D - not bad. A pretty light ale, but I bought this because (well, also I hadn't had it and couldn't pass it up as a result) I'm grilling this weekend and it will be perfect for being outside with friends. It's light and refreshing, and should make this partly cloudy day of temperatures in the low 80's a real joy. Highly recommended for summer drinking outside. Also, I feel like people who aren't into craft beer as much could enjoy this one pretty easily. Here's to summer!"
"I'm a sucker for wheat beers as far as drinkability goes. I could down tons of these."
"This brew pours a cloudy yellow color and has a marginal whitish head. The nose has some quiet citrus tones and wheaty malts. The taste is mostly wheat malts with again subtle fruit. The body is really light for the style and over carbonated. Needs lots of glass swirling to help go down smooth."
"This beer was on sale which makes me wonder if it's old. Because it poured out pretty flat with no head. Hazy yellow with a small but steady stream of tiny bubble rising to the surface. I smell earthy clove funk and sour banana. Tastes as it smells but a bit better. Thick and somewhat heavy mouthfeel for the style. Not the best pale wheat. I've had many better."
"Had this beer at the drafting room in Exton PA. Great name for a beer and certainly got me to try it! As for the taste, it was a wheat beer, but it tasted water downed compared to most...I guess it was the sweat from Betty in the beer. Would not even bother trying."
"D: A citrusy and refreshing drink that slides effortlessly off the tongue. Would be on of my top 5 choices for a summer time quencher. Case worthy by all means."
"Recommended..."
"Hops did much for the mouthfeel, which would have been thin to the point of precarious without the ample hop complement. Had I more time, I would have knocked back two more of these in a snap. Delicious and balanced, Sweaty Betty has a harsher name than the beer will ever realize. It's smooth, semi-sweet, not bitter, and great to kick back and enjoy on a hot day. Good stuff."
"D- Because of the watery nature of the beer, these would be easy to take down on a hot summer night. Lacks in the flavor department. Once again, another typical wheat beer."
"Pours a slightly fogged straw with a minimal white head that falls quickly. Nose is strange. Kind of sour and weird. Flavor is strange too. Kind of an odd banana edge that is enough to notice, but really makes everything odd and unusual. Feel has a fairly full carbonation, but the liquid is thin. I don't really like this beer, but I know a lot of it has to do with my dislike of the style (said it before...saying it again). Too thin on the flavor and what's there just doesn't keep it interesting enough. Pass."
"d: The sourness/tartness and the acidity hurts the drinkability. It is a very light beer that doesn't have much flavor. What flavor is present is not particularly enjoyable. I don't know if it was just my bottle or not, but if this is how it always tastes, I would avoid it."
"seemed to be an extra carbonated wheat beer in my mouth... as for drinkability, i live in arizona where lightweight beers are a must in the summer (come on winter!!!) and this one will find a place in my fridge from time to time again.... i just cant tell anyone im tasting sweaty betty again!"
"Overall- A thirst quencher. This can replace gatorade. Not bad."
"I was not too impressed with this beer.Extremely light yellow color and the smell had a hint of sourness to it.The taste is OK but there is a subtle metallic taste to it.It is drinkable but there are much better beers out there to try.I would only drink again if it was free."
"What an aesthetic name... poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a hazy, watery golden color with almost no head. Smell is actually similar to a hefe; there is a slightly spicy, clovey, banana presence. Taste is just like the nose... much better than the appearance. Mouthfeel is pretty light in both body and carbonation. Overall very drinkable, the alcohol isn't perceivable and it goes down easily. I would recommend this beer."
"D: decent. I could have a few on a summer day but it wouldn't be a top choice."
"I will talk with Betty again soon."
"To be honest, this is one of the better American attempts at the hefe weizen that I've come across. There isn't much of that Bavarian flare to it that makes the German iterations so great, but there was a decent amount of flavor, sweetness, and carbonation to make it very enjoyable. Notes of lemon, honey and spices come together nicely. It is a more classic take on the pale wheat category, and I think Boulder did a solid job with it."
"Although I found the taste a little lacking, this is one of the better summer beers and given Boulder's track record, I'd be interested in trying this again."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, good representation of style, this is a good beer to stick with for an evening, especially if youre looking for something on the lighter side."
"i'd have to say that this is worth a case every summer season."
" Ah the beauty of summer and all the good beers that comes with it."
"I really enjoyed this beer. It's probably my favorite wheat beer not from a bar tap. I bought it at the same time as some Samuel Adams Summer Ale, and while that was good, this was just slightly better. It had a little more of a citrusy taste, which I enjoyed."
"Gave this brew a try, it poured to a dull yellow color with some cloudiness. Possessed virtually no head and what was there was a white cap that broke down very rapidly and left no lacing. The aroma was pretty good, wheat scent comes out first with a little citrus character, I would saw mostly lemon. Slight sweet smell also mixed in with a light hop highlight. The taste is ok, not as good as the aroma. Has a grainy feel, light hop presence but just seems very plain, finishes somewhat dry. Overall I would say that this is a good drinking beer during the warmer months but feel that we have better choices both nationally as well as locally."
"Overall: Decent but nothing to actively pursue. Worth a try if one comes your way."
"Drinkability - Grabbed a sixer of this because it's hot outside, and this does quench on a hot day, but like many american wheat beers, flavor is not overly complex, or exciting. At least for me..."
"12oz. brown bottle poured into my Sly Fox shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a hazy yellow color (I kicked up the yeast on purpose) with about a finger of white head. Smells of spicy yeast/bread, bananas, and clove. Tastes of said bananas, peppery spice, and a hint of clove. Medium in both body and carbonation. Finish is dry and clean. This is a beer I could drink a few of and not get bored."
"Drinkability: Overall, a very neutral brew that finishes pretty clean."
"First off, Im not sure sweaty should ever be used to describe something you are planning to consume. That being said, it does make for a rhyming name. This beer poured a bright, hazy yellow. The head is white and sparse. The smell is wheaty, the taste follows suit: wheaty, and banana-like. Very refreshing and reminds me of a hefeweizen. What is the difference a wheat and a hefeweizen anyway?"
"This is definitely a hefe-weizen so I wonder why they call it a blonde...probably just to have something go with the name ""Sweaty Betty"". At any rate, it seems to have confused quite a few reviewers on this site. Quite enjoyable. I will have to check out 6-pack prices, because if it's cheaper, it may replace Summit as my summer hefe-weizen. Tasty."
"A not bad, not exceptional pale wheat that seems to have wandered into Boulder's Looking Glass series by mistake. Fine to grab a cool one of, but I'd pass on a steady diet."
"D- This is very drinkable and is a great representation of the wheat beer style. The wheat and yeast can be tasted, seen, and felt but are accented with citrus and some spices."
"The aroma is a little weak, maybe light spicing, wheat grain profile. The flavor is much better, and significantly more full. Along with some coriander spicing, the wheat is more assertive. Pretty straightforward blonde ale, it's not too weak but very drinkable. Mouthfeel is a little watery, but otherwise a solid brew."
"I open the bottle and pour, eyes focused on the game on this gloomy spring day. The first sip intrigues me. It is wheat, it is blonde. It is the fermented drops of Betty's Sweat. And it tastes wonderful. Golden like blonde locks, wheaty but not overly fruity or citrusy. Refreshing and I am away from the game, dancing with the mysterious Betty in fields of dandelion. The 6 pack is gone, my team wins."
"poured a very hazy straw color with close to a two finger white head that faded to just covering the beer with a sticky lace that followed the beer down the glass. aromas of wheat and lemon grass and spice. taste, wheat malt, lemon grass, cloves and other spices with a peppery ending lingers for a bit. mouthfeel is very light and crisp and spicy. will definitely be looking for more of sweaty betty."
"This beer poured a cloudy straw color  thick head. The aroma is quite fruity and a little sour. The taste is fruity and floral with some sourness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is on the light side. This is a flavorful beer that is interesting and refreshing."
"Drinkability - a hidden gem, this one. For an American wheat, it can compete with some of the best German hefes out there."
"Light yellow, slightly cloudy, rapidly evaporating head with bubbly carbonation that grabs the side of the pint glass. Sweet citrus and some spices on the nose, none of which improve as this beer warms up. Twangy lemon and orange offerings in the initial quaffs; the body quickly reveals touches of hops and a sweet malt based background. There are certain flashes of banana peel, cloves and hefe-like spices with just a touch of black pepper left on the palate. Borderline-medium modied, somewhat of a sugary and creamy malt finish. Nothing that will have you crying for more, but who's complaining about a simple and easy to drink wheat ale?"
"D - It is pretty good. I had high expectations for a Boulder Beer product and it didn't quite meet them. But it is still a drinakble beer."
"B'ham UK (but written while in Florida)"
"D - I could finish 100 of these without breaking a sweat. A very good beer."
"Drinkability: if you are looking for a thirst quencher, this may fit the bill. But the strong lemon and tartness gets a bit boring after a while."
"This wheat ale poured a slightly hazy, yellow color with creamy, very white foam that slowly settled and clung to the glass, leaving some lace. The smell was fruity and citrusy with a hint of sweetness, and wheat malt beneath. The taste was wheat malty with citrus fruitiness and very light hoppiness. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium-light body and moderate carbonation. The light fruitiness lingered in the finish. This was a very easy-drinking beer. A good example of the American Wheat style."
"Meh, another plain jane pale wheat with a slight sourness. Unsure if this was intended or if my sample is beyond it's life expectancy. Either way, I probably would have scored it just the same..."
"Good summer cooler."
"Very clean and straightforward, a true lawnmower beer, but I'd like more from this beer from such a great brewery."
"12oz. bottle: This one poured a straw yellow color. It was slightle hazy with a thick white head that dropped off rather quickly. Faint whiffs of banana and clove to the nose. The body is rather thin. The flavor isnt bad, but it is weak. Slight notes of wheat and citrus. OK as a lawnmower beer, but not for any other reason."
"The name is really unappealing, though."
"Very drinkable overall if you are an afficianado of this style- no doubt you will find that there are better exemplars out there, but this a passable brew for the dog days of August on the Jersey Shore."
"Light pale with fizzy carbonation and almost no head. Alcohol and cheesy scent. Light bodied but drinkable. A bit acidic sour, and a metallic aftertaste. I even thought it a tad skunky, but apparently this is normal for this beer.Terrible name. I think worst of the brewery's line."
"D: Terrific, refreshing summer beer. Good flavor - would drink this again...not a big fan of the name of the beer, however..."
"Not a bad beer but not a great one either. Decent but there's nothing to write home about here."
"Excellent hot weather brew. I'll definately grab more o' these next time around!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" white head over the clear light golden brew. Head lasts nicely, with heavy lacing. Aroma is cloves and wheat character. Taste is sweet malts upfront, with the clove kicking in after a minute, and lingering in the mouth. Mouthfeel is to-style smooth, and drinkability is good, but limited slightly by the possibly over-sweet start."
"What to give a try on a hot and humid day? Why not Sweaty Betty, a fine offering from Boulder Beer. Sweaty Betty pours a nice gold color. The rather pleasant smell is grassy, citrusy, wheaty. The taste is nice mixture of lemon-citrus, wheat and yeast. The mouthfeel is refreshingly crisp. A very highly drinkable and enjoyable beverage."
"Is this made by AB? This can't be a Boulder Beer?!?! NO!!!"
"I probably won't buy it again, but it wasn't by any means painful to drink."
"that said, it rates higher on drinkability, but most American Pale wheats do...it would make a pretty damn good summer sessioner...medium hops, citrusy character, light body...a great beer to bring to the beach or have at a bbq though there are much better options (try left hands haystack if you want to stay in style)"
"A Pale Wheat Ale is probably not the best style to characterize for this beer. The wheat never really shows up. The look is quite clear and not hazzy. The carbonation is fizzy instead of creamy. The aroma is pisnerish and grainy, not estery and fruity. The beer feels too thin and the finish is grainy. Would fare better as a Blonde Ale. Despite the lack of wheat, the beer keeps a persistant lemon flavor and tartness that makes a good summertime refrehing beer. Though fizzy, a mint-like character works in the beer's favor, cutting through the thirst. It's a decent beer, but don't look for a wheat beer when purchasing this."
"This is a nicely amped up Pale Wheat Ale. It's got much more flavour than you'd expect from the style. It's not the be all end all, but a nice summer thirst quencher indeed."
"Thanks go out to Heath for trucking me a box of fresh CO beers on a recent east coast visit."
"D: Definately a drinkable beer on a hot summers day. Seems very refreshing and thirst quenching. Almost reminds me of a hefe."
"Drinkability - love to have more, but i only have one bottle."
"Taste- Starts with really clear malts with a wheat chaser. Finish a refreshing yet sub par blonde ale flavor."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale yellow straw with an average sized white head. The smell is very malty and especially ""bisquity"". Other smells include lemon and wheat. This is a pretty good smelling beer. The taste is very refreshing with lemon, wheat, yeast, and a creamy citrus flavor. The m/f is light and well balanced. A very good summer beer, I can see myself having a few of these."
"A flavorful Pale Wheat compared to the onslaught of boring summer releases. Too heavy on the lemon-sourness, but one I would go back to."
"This is a decent summer brew - a good change from most of the boring summer brews out there. Refreshing enough and the taste is good."
"It's just what I'd expect from a summertime wheat beer: sassy, crisp, snappy, and refreshing. It may not stand out in the memory, but it represents itself nicely while you're drinking it. It's very quaffable, staying light and quenching a thirst capably. I got a kick out of the name, and hey, the beer's not bad either."
" I thought that a beer from Boulder would have a bolder (no pun or alliteration intended), side to it and would show off the Amarillo hops that characterize them, and make them stand out from other brews in that part of the country. This could have used just a bit of that, to liven things up and make it more memorable. Instead, they made a light, enjoyable brew, but the memory of it is just like the taste - it doesn't linger well and hardly stands out among the competition. Certainly, a missed opportunity..."
"I felt this was a great hefe. I had this beer after a weekend of backpacking, my mind was quite numb and my notes on this beer were sparse. Im sure it deserves more description than I can decipher from my notes"
"This ones a dead ringer for a Bavarian Weitzen. Well done!"
"Sweaty Betty Blonde pours a yellow color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Aroma is banana and clove. Very light wheat beer taste, clove is noticeable but mild at first, but becomes more noticeable as the beer warms. A bit of citrus perhaps. Sort of a sparkling type of carbonation. Decent beer for a hot day. Worth a try."
"Pours an opaque lemon yellow with a 1/4 inch creamy head that fades quickly. Smell is citrusy and spicy. Taste is banana - cloves as one would expect from this style. Hints of pepper as well. Carbonation is slightly stinging, but not inappropriate. Mouthfeel is light and creamy, quite refreshing on a hot day after working your butt off outside."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a light body. The beer has a stinging carbonation. The beer is an ok beer drink; however, for the money it is easy to get a better wheat beer."
"Pours a hazy light golden color with a wispy white head that disappears after about a minute. Nice, crisp aroma of light wheat, citrus, banana, and weizen yeast. Palate is fairly standard for a wheat beer - light wheat and citrus flavors, with banana and bubble gum esters present in the background. Body is a bit thin and not particularly well-carbonated. Not bad, but I'm glad I only bought one bottle of this."
"The beer pours forth from the 12-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass a slightly chill hazed straw color, the head smallish and white, the texture semi-creamy, as it erodes faster than the speed of light, the left over lace a thin sheet that conceals the glass. Nose has a fair wheat aroma, fresh and crisp, also a bit of malt sweetness, start is lightly sweet, grain profile adequate; the top feels light to the palate. Finish is spiny in its acidity, the hops light but present, quite dry aftertaste, not a bad beer, hits the spot on this hot Arizona day."
"Didn't really go down that easy. Too much going on with out any rhyme or reason"
"D - moderate, a little to lemony-sour for me, but a quality brew"
"Poured a lemon orange with a cloudy body that leaves a thick white head. The aroma is wheat, lemon, pepper, orange zest very nice and complex. The taste starts malty wheat, with a candied fruit body, that is slighty carbonated and slighty thin. The beer finishes light with gentle bubble and a spicy sweetness on your tongue."
"Draft at the Angry Mexican aka Mad Mex in Robinson...any way I was expecting a blonde from Boulder when I heard Sweatty Betty. Nope I was wrong appears a cloudy golden yellow with a frothy white head wow impressive appearance the billowing head dwindles slowly leaving even bands of lacing. Aromatics com packed with citrus tones sharp wheat acidity soft vanilla and other herbal spices but the hops also stand out here with a spicy finish. Tastes very well balanced yet packing abundant flavor light and fluffy citrus and wheat sweetness with a softer vanilla fruity tone and finishes with a nice hop bite, well done. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied evenly carbonated no harshness here at very smooth on the palate. Drinkability is great a very refreshing summertime offering that put's the typical American Pale Wheat to shame good job to the folks out at Boulder Brewing."
"Dvery easy to drink beer. Excellent warmer weather beer."
"Sweaty Betty, you go down easy! For all of that, I wish you gave better head. You're leaving the bottom of my glass bald. I don't mind bald, but not on my beer. Feels substantial enough to be satisfying, but not so flavorful that you'd wince at every sip while tipping back at a BBQ. Good, especially for the style. One of the more complex american wheats I've had. The wheat sourness and vague spiciness leans towards a witbier, some aspects are more bavarian hefeweiss, and others are american wheat. A nice little hybrid you are, Betty."
"Da very good wheat beer. Goes down smooth and more would be welcomed. I think this would be a good summer beer for by the pool, but as I review this on 1/29in MN and look outside, there is a thick layer of ice on my pool. I can dream though, cant I?"
"Pours a hazy yellow color, some carbonation, small head, some lacing. Scents of citrus, and wheat. Nice taste for a wheat ale, dry, but kinda flat. Light body. Very drinkable for sure, not too sure about the ABV, nice taste. Would recommend, but will probably not buy again."
"You could drink cases of this stuff in the summer..and get pretty damn drunk doing so. A summer offering that's worth a try if you find it."
"Pours a hazy straw color. Head disapears quickly, to a nice lace. This beer is a lighter version of Flying Dog's In Heat Wheat. I like the Flying Dog a bit better,but this is not bad at all. In fact on a hot day I may go for this because it is lighter."
"From notes. Poured a hazy straw color wit ha small head that fell to nothing at all over the brew. The nose was orangey nd lemony with light wheaty notes. I found the flavor to be rather bland. Just nota lot going on in that one at all. The feel was light moderate with a moderate carbonation. Overall impressions were nothing of note. A fairly average brew. Pedestrian."
"This one pours a hazy yellow color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma reminds me a lot of an American Wheat - some US hops and a backing of wheat and graininess. The flavor is just as expected - reminds me of an American wheat - just like the aroma. Not my favorite style, but the flavor on this one is better than most. More smooth than expected. The body is light and the drinkability is good."
"Im not so sure this one is retired since I just got it on tap from Old Chicago yesterday, but oh well. This beer poured a pale yellow haze with a quickly dissolving head and a little lace. Smells of mostly lemon citrus and seems to taste that way to. I was not to thrilled with this beer but not let down it was just average"
"An unusual wheat beer."
"This is a beer that isn't afraid to have some fun. Gotta' love the name, and the label design and blurb are amusing. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a hefe head. Mild banana aroma, that was equally evident in the flavor. Some tangy citric qualities lend a more American spin to this wheat. Very refreshing - a bit lighter-weight than a German hefe, and meant to be so. Few hefes are good session beers, but this is one where one is not enough."
"A medium bodied ale, OK to drink but I wouldn't recommend or repeat."
"I could enjoy a few of these on a hot day such as this...another fine offering from Boulder...a nice addition to the lineup."
"An OK to seldomly enjoyable beer. Not much to it. Just not cutting it for me as any kind of wheat beer."
"This brew would probably go great with gourmet pizza or at a barbeque, I wanted to like this beer on its own, but I really didn't. I wish they spent more time thinking about what they were brewing, instead of coming up with fancy names and labels."
"The beer pours a hazy pale yellow color witha thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a fruity wheat scent that boasts of banana and clove along with a yeasty aroma; very refreshing. The taste is decent. It has a light wheat flavor that goes down easy. It's smooth with the traditional banana and clove appeal. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking summer seasonal. It has a nice fruity flavor. I wish it had more of a wheat malt presence, but it drinks well anyway."
"Cloudy sun yellow. Thin white head leaves a good amount of lace. This one's good on the nostrils. Lemon, citron, tangy wheat, hay... Very pleasant. Not as much to talk about on the buds though. Still decent enough, but the lively tones on the nose don't translate to the palate. Dulled wheat tones and a little lemongrass. Just a little spritz of hops that give the beer a slightly dry finish. Mouthfeel is not quite as active as I'd like in a Wheat brew, but not a lot else to complain about. Body is a little better than medium. This one's not too bad. I'd hit it up again."
"Overall: I love a lot of beers in this style, but this one just doesn't have enough flavor to hold up to the better examples. Pleasant enough to drink, but there are much better choices."
"Appearance is a cloudy yellow with a quarter inch of foam and no lacing. Aroma has spicy hops, barley but not much malt. Initial taste is of banana esters, citrus, grain and some pretty interesting hops. Body is medium and finish is dry. Not a great ale, more of a wheat beer."
"This one pours a very cloudy yellowish tone, White head with morerate retention and next to no lacing. The nose here is of heavy clove. On the tongue its more strong cloves, some buting cirtic notes and some soft tropical fruits in the background. This one is quite tart and leaves an allmost stinging bite on the tongue. Not my favorite wheat type brew. Needs to be softened up, less clove notes would be a start. It should be easy to find better drinking summer brews."

"This was mild, easy drinking, and not too exciting. It was a decent lawnmower beer."
"I'm a huge fan of the Looking Glass series of beers. Sweaty Betty is the first one that hasn't bowled me over, but that doesn't mean that I haven't had a good time with it. It's flavorful and oh so drinkable, as evidenced by the fact that the bomber is empty and the glass is rapidly heading in that direction. Sweaty might be pushing it, but then Mildy Moist Betty doesn't have much shelf appeal."
"Drinkability: Unfortunately there are many other seasonals I want to try yet that this will have to compete with. Later, as summer winds down, if I see this on sale I would probably pick some more up, I just am not going to go rush out and get more right away."
"This isn't a bad brew. The style is a bit watery for my tastes, and this beer does seem a tad watery. Give it a try anyway, it would be very refreshing."
"Hazy light golden color with a very thin and fizzy but lasting white head. No lacing to be found. The aroma is a little fruity along with mild hops. Light-bodied and bubbly with fruit and wheat flavors. Kind of a watery texture too. The finish is short and lemony. I am against any beer that makes reference to something secreted from the human body. Even without that this is a below average beer."
"A very light yellow/straw colored beer . Has a small white head. The aroma starts with a strong yeasty note. With the wheat and banana notes in the background. The flavor is like a mild version of a Hefe- but there is an unpleasant corn on the cob sweetness that lays in the back of your throat on the finish."
"My final bottle from the six pack, and it opened with a flow of foamy beer, unlike it's brothers that were lost before it. Nicy cloudy dark gold color, head is small after the initial pour. Nice strong banana and clove smell, pretty solid for the style. The taste is a little bland, but still good, with alot of tart banana flavor, pretty good. Nice beer for a hot day, I have yet to find a beer in the Looking Glass Series that wasn't interesting."
"Another ""Looking Glass"" series beer, now it comes in six packs. Moslty clear greenish gold color with a very white head that reduces to a collar pretty quickly. Lace is minimal at best. Aroma of dusty hay with some cotton candy sweetness. Solid mouthfeel with minimal carbonation -- which helps the estery qualities shine, candy ""circus peanut"" impressions. Distinct vanilla tone seems to dominate mid mouth, like Cream of Wheat with sugar and bananas on top. Sucrose finish, not a lot of complexities and without a lot of citrus notes to cut in. There's little doubt in my mind that this is an American Wheat with a hefty dose of that grain tossed in."
"I'm starting to get warm on the name, now, too...sweaty or not, Betty's my kind of girl."
"Overall impression: I had this beer last spring, and wasn't too impressed. I feel like they may have changed the recipe slightly, or maybe my tastes changed, but I enjoyed it this time."
"Poured a light, somewhat cloudy yellow with minimal head and no lacing. Smells like bananas and fruit and tastes very much like the banana smell. Very light and refreshing beer, and very enjoyable. Nice change of pace at the end of your 9-5 day."
"OK, so it doesnt have the label Hefeweizen in the name anywhere. When I tried this beer, that is definitely what I thought it was. It poured a pale golden (yellow), and was certainly unfiltered. There was no head to speak of, and very little lace that didnt stay around anyway. Very slight aroma of vanilla and banana. The taste has the banana, and a little more citrus. No clove flavor that you might expect from a high-quality Hefe. I give this beer credit though, it had none of the chemical after-taste that many American Hefeweizens are full of (Why is that?). A very light mouth feel. Nice drinkability, this is an excellent hot weather beer (on a 90 degree Boston day)."
"Hazy, pale gold in hue, kind of pasty. Yet it was still surprisingly transparent. Not much animation either, it looks a bit lifeless. The head was white in color and about a finger in height on a hard pour. Head retention was poor as it quickly faded to a loose cap. For a Hefeweizen these features are not up to par as the head was too small and the retention was to short. The subsequent lacing was spotty and it didnt cling well, yet another dull aspect of the appearance. The nose is soft with musty notes being the most noticeable. Yeasty. Weak banana aromas as well, hint of vanilla. Wheaty. There is a faded indication of citrus at the back. The nose does play along with the idea that this is a Hefeweizen. Im not totally convinced. Maybe Id call it a kicked up American Wheat. Then again I havent tasted it yet. This is solely based on the look and smell. The bouquet is inviting, regardless. The palate is very similar to the nose. Upfront is a meshing of yeasty musk with some wheaty notes. In the middle the banana finds a way to the foreground, moderate citrus notes that are stronger in flavor than in the scent. Modest vanilla flavors, malty, and thickly wheaty, pleasantly sweet. The aftertaste is mostly banana with just a trace of clove. This is a zesty and quite tasty Hefeweizen with an American twist. Still, the palate has now conviced me this was German roots. The carbonation is lively, as desired. Tasty. Bring on the pancakes and scrambled eggs. Medium in body, the mouthfeel is quite pleasant. I enjoyed this beer it is yet another dandy from the Looking Glass Series. This is enjoyable enough that I might have to buy a few more bombers. Purchased in Omaha."
"Fresh, subtle, solid and refreshing wheat beer. An americanized hefeweizen with the usual banana, clove and nutmeg flavors but also some hints of lemon, ripe pear and apple."
"Slightly hazy light gold witha small, but vigorous head. Aromas of banana esters dominate. Slight yeasty tones present. Bananas and tropical flavors present with a strong metallic bite in the finish. Mouthfeel is light, with a strange, slightly harsh acidic or overcarbonbation grip up front. I am not impressed with this beer. Too many conflicting flavors and tastes with little direction or focus. No need to look for this one."
"Pours a cloudy orange yellow, small white head that doesn't last, no lacing either. Aroma of wheat, bananas and spices. Flavors of wheat, banana-clove bubblegum flavors. Medium body with mild carbonation, almost flat, finishes with some sweetness, I was disappointed with this, maybe worth a try but I wouldn't buy this again."
"Slightly hazy, nearly opaque golden yellow, with just a tiny hint of copper. The white head was tiny, even after a hard pour. Little lacing. Smell is wheaty and pleasant, with slight hints of banana and lemon. Taste is sweet, lots of the wheat flavor, just a small hint of bitterness and lemon. This is right up there, next to paulaner Hefe-Weizen. This one isn't quite as fruity as paulaner's is, but absolutely great."
"The taste was acidic at first then went with an alcohol flavor which didn't impress me. My favorite part of this beer is the mouthfeel which is heavier than I expected. It has a wonderful wheaty aftertaste which lingers nicely."
"All in all, a good brew. Didn't like it so much at first gulp, but from there, I've grown to like the taste a bit more. I'll plan to stock the fridge with a few more before it disappears."
"I was extremely impressed by this beer. Definitely need to snag a few more while they are still available."
