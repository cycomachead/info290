"Overall: Breweries just love to crank out these wheat beers in the summer. It's a nice entry, though it doesn't separate itself from the pack much, other than the organic tag. I had it with pizza and salad. I would have it with pizza and salad again, probably."

"o: One of the better hoppy wheats I've tried."

"Overall: Pretty solid summer brew. I'll revisit this one again in the near future."
""

"O: Took a chance on this one and I couldn't be happier. This is a very solid fridge beer and I look forward to getting it again, this may even top Trout Slayer Ale as my favorite wheat beer. Would pair very nicely with white fish. A nice first impression from Peak Organic, I will have to seek out more of their offerings. Cheers!"

"this won't blow anyone's mind, but it's good for a summer afternoon for sure."
"Summer Session, very much like an APA very hoppy. Got 3 or them in a beer of the month pack. Will enjoy them. I never have heard of Peak Organic Brewing Company, but I definitely would recommend someone with access to this to try if you enjoy this style."

"O: I do not like the yeast profile on this at all. Way too buttery."
""
"O - Decent Pale Wheat, good mild hop presence, and not too much on the wheat, balanced. IF PO could get that soapy aftertaste out, this would be something I'd return to."
""
"O: Easy to drink and refreshing, perfect for a hot day and it tasted great after a walk in the heat."

"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was piss colored and poured a nice fluffy head. The beer was a little bit hoppy with a citrus hint to it. The beer had a tiny bitter finish but not too bad and had great lacing. I would drink again."
"Overall, I am pleasantly surprised with this because I usually don't go for the IMO bland ""summer"" beers. I was hoping for something that is easy to drink without sacrificing complex flavor and hoppiness. This one is right on the money. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone in the mood for a session with character"

"O: Very impressed by this offering. Whenever I see ""summer"" beers, the word ""lame"" automatically pops into my head. This beer is a true pale ale and is light enough for the summer. This is the epitome of what I want to drink for the season."
"O: A slightly above-average summer pale wheat. Has quite a bit going on despite a nice simplicity. Easy to drink, organic, and not too expensive. Worthy of a try"

"Overall: While I found the twelve ounces agreeable, but I wonder where it finds a home at. It's not overly wheaty and the hops are somewhat muted by the diacetyl character (at least in this batch), so, I do wonder ""who is this for?"" I could see this being replaced sometime down the road."

"An all right pale wheat ale, I suppose, with lip service being paid to that west coast hop essence, which altogether makes for a whole is better than the sum of the parts sort of deal. Refreshing enough, and worthy of a few more go rounds, I must admit."

"Overall meh, not much of a wheat beer at all, more like a macro so called wheat, more like candy cereal grains with a bit of fruit, more Leinenkugel like wheat beer than a real wheat. The hops are decent though which might be the saving grace of this beer. It's light and drinkable for a summer beer though, so definitely sessionable, but probably wouldn't get it again. And after all that, there really aren't any ""off"" flavors, just not the best overall flavors for the style."
"Overall: this beer is definitely as-advertised: a great summer session ale. It also happens to suit my palate quite nicely; I'd definitely have this again."
"Peak Organic Summer Session Ale is a very clear, golden ale with a thick, fluffy, white head that has great retention and lacing. It has a very earthy smell with a fresh hop aroma that's bright and citrusy. It smells great. It's medium light bodied, smooth and soft. The finish is quick and dry, leaving the mouth a little slick. It has a nice, tight, dry, bitter flavor with lots of lemon peel and a hint of grass and herbs. The bitterness lingers for a while after the taste. This beer is a very pleasant surprise. It has a lot more flavor than I was expecting and it's very refreshing. I'm a fan."

"Poured from a bottle into a weisse vase, the beer is a slightly hazed, vibrant, bright, goldenrod coloring with a slim, filmy white coating on the surface. Aromas of toasted grains and a surprising hops presence. Bitter and slightly resiny on the nose, which is a nice change of pace. Flavors are definitely hop-centric, with a green, peppery, bitter influence overshadowing a subtle toasted grain backbone. A little unbalanced on the palate. The aftertaste is light, crisp, and clean, with some citrus influence on the green hops characteristics. Crisp, light, and slightly drying finish. Very tasty."

"O - one the better examples of the style done organically, cool!"
""
""

"Overall I may just get this again. Organic ales kick ass."
""
""

"O: This drinks like a lightened version of Little Sumpin' Sumpin' -- big hops flavor with the wheaty tanginess. Tone down the carbonation by 20%, and Peak would have a real winner. As spring/summer beers go, this is a can't miss. I was really impressed with this brew."
"Probably my favorite summer beer. The aroma is loaded with bright citrus. Hop character up front, then a rush of nice wheat flavor, contrasting the hops really well. Finishes dry and clean. Nice carbonation. I could have many of these on a warm summer day, and appreciate the taste of each one. A gem."
"Decent beer I would drink during the summer in small amounts."
""
"D: Glad I only got one of these, not a terrible beer but definently below my expectations"

"5 as the overall? Yes. When it's hot out, when I'm working up a sweat, I want a flavorful beer that refreshes me, rejuvenates me, keeps me going, but still tingles my taste buds. This is exactly what Peak Organic's Summer Session Ale, and I encourage you to reach for one this summer."
"It pours a slightly hazy golden color with two fingers of head. Very high visible carbonation. The aroma has clean malts, wheat, hops and citrus. The taste is good, it's got a nice citrus and wheat presence at first, dying down to some clean malts, toasted grain, a touch of hops, and still continuing citrus presence. The mouthfeel is light and heavily carbonated, and the drinkability is very good. This is just a really good American Wheat. It's very flavorful for it's small profile. Delicious."

"O: decent sessionable summer ale, for what its worth, I might have this again"
""
""
"O - A decent session ale. Bready, some citrus and peppercorn. For what it is, it's not bad."
"O: It's certainly not Gumballhead, but it's a tasty little number in it's own right. Not as complex or hoppy as I'd have liked, yet it's something you could bring to a party and not offend anyone. I'd prefer more complexity, but in the end it's still quaffable and easily approachable."

"Sampled from a bottle at the April 7, 2012 Keene, NH Beerfest. The pour is pale yellow with a fizzy, short-lived head. The aroma has a moderate malt character but there is also a citrus, or more likely a pineapple character. The wheat is playing second fiddle. The body is light, which is typical for the style. The taste also brings out the same sort of light malt, citrus flavor with an extra tart finish winding things down. I could see having a few of these on a hot, summer day."

"O - A nice dry and lemony pale ale that fits the label of Summer Session Ale"""
"O: Very refreshing. A good summer beer. Peak Organic brews some very good beers and this is one. I will look for this one again."
"Poured a 2"" white head. Clear bright straw yellow color body. Smells mildy of citrus. Taste has some citrus peel plus malt and a mild bitter hops finish. Certainly a step up from other summer ales, and quite refreshing, but not overly complex. Definitely above average though, and so far I've liked every single thing I tried from Peak Organic."
"Picked up a single at EuroMarket. For such a light beer, the Ringwood (creamy, earthy fruit) character is too heavy. There is, however, a pleasant fruity citrus burst that remind me of Citra hops and Narragansett Summer Ale. The hops are complemented by a mild, sweet wheat bread. The body is appropriately light and drinkable for session/summer beer. Worth a try if you enjoy Ringwood beers."
"O: A decent summer ale that actually tastes like ""beer"". Hoppy and refreshing!"
"Notes: The mild buttery taste I picked up was a tad distracting, but this is nit-picking. It isn't enough to detract from the overall drinking experience. This beer is very easy to drink and very refreshing. Tasty too. You can't really ask for much more from a summer seasonal."
"all in all, pretty enjoyable for a summer brew. solid flavors, interesting malt profile, and all around good beer. I'd pick up a sixer if it was local for sure."
"D. It is a pure summer beer. Refreshing and lagers, not happy or pure malty. Very good balance."
"Taste is crisp, nice bitter touch to finish, fairly crisp like a pilsner. A perfect summer session beer, aptly named. Reminds me a bit of New Belgium Mighty Arrow."
"Bottle poured into a pint glass: Pours a nice clear golden yellow with plenty of head and generous lacing. Strong malt and sweet wheat aroma leads to a concentrated grain taste, some burnt malts, balanced by light bitterness. Very easy drinking, perfect carbonation, gets you in the mood for a baseball game. Session is the perfect description for this summer brew."
"Crisp and light bodied with a decent balance of bready yeast, earthy hops, peppery spice and citrus rind. This beer is pretty light and none of the flavors stand out or are particularly strong. A well balanced, quaffable session beer that is good for BBQ and outdoor drinking."
"The feel of this beer is pretty light and pretty drinable. It makes for a very good summer beer and went well with the pasta I paired with it."
"D - I'm quite impressed with this one and even a little bit surprised at how nice it is. This beer is much better than average, both as a summer beer and an American wheat ale. The aroma is surprisingly complex as spices and a very nice lemon zest character hit your in the nose along with a hint of pine hops. The flavor profile operates along the same lines with the addition of vanilla and some more potent malt. Really well done and very drinkable, I continue to be impressed with Peak as they are making beers that stand up for themselves regardless of their organic status."
"Pouring a clear light orange-yellow with a dense, white head that falls off leaving no lacing, this beer looks decent. The nose is decent as well. Moderate hop character, fruity and citrusy with a rather clean, cracker-like malt backbone. Grainy with a moderate dry wheat aroma, there's not too much going on here. The palate opens with some hop flavor, moderately citrus-like. Rather mild in flavor, there's no real bitterness here, and even the hops taste a little muted. Moderate grain flavor is present with a definite wheat presence. Drying on the finish with no real lingering flavors, this feels just a touch watery. Crisply carbonated, this is a refreshing beverage, though not particularly tasty."
"Summer Session Ale is a solid beer that doesn't quite stand out from the crowd. More hops would have been nice, making this a hopped-up wheat beer. Less hops and a focus on the malted wheat might have been better too."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light and refreshing pale and wheat malt scent along with a touch of citrus and a subtle yeast fruitiness. The taste is decent. It has a dry pale and wheat malt flavor. It has a mild bitterness and well as a faint citrus character in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a tasty brew with incredible drinkability; a fine summer seasonal."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and quite refreshing. It’s a good selection for a hot summer day or as a pairing with a light dish like pasta."
"Really a nice light body here with good lively carbonation. Really a refreshing beer here. It really sums up what I would want out of a lighter summer beer."
"Poured into a standard pint glass a dull lemony color with a thin wispy bone white head atop,muted citric hops in the nose along with some toasted grain,pleasant but again muted.Muted hops again in the flavor,present but a little light,somewhat grainy and toasted as well.I like the hoppy wheat ales like Gumballhead,and Hop Sun,and I thought this would be more in their category but it doesnt bring as much hop punch.I wish that style would reamerge."
"Pours a medium golden with a thin white head. Just a little bit of retention,with a decent lace. Aroma is of piny hops and citrus. Body is light and carbonated. Taste is piny,grassy hops throughout. Little bit of malt kick in the finish. Not what expected at all,but really good."
"Overall a very sessionable beer, perhaps not the best of the summer but a decent beer to sip on, tasty for all it's worth."
"Skip it."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a slightly dark ambe with a decent stream of bubbles rising from the bottom. Very thin white head that didn't last long, but clung to the sides and slowly slid down. Aroma was slightly sweet, reminded me of vanilla and bubblegum with a small amount of grain in the end. Taste started out slightly hoppy, a small touch of sweet, then ended with a tarty tang. Felt ok in the mouth, fairly mouthy with a small kick, seemed almost over carbonated. Easy to drink, could definitely do several on a hot day."
"Reminiscent of Brooklyn summer."
"Pours a two finger white head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Crystal clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Hoppy nose. Flavor is very similar to a pale with hints of citrus but the usual hop bitterness. $1.80 for a 12oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"D - I definitely plan on drinking this beer again this summer in place of my slightly heavier go-to beer, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. I've already recommended this beer to a few friends, and it's definitely a bonus in my book that it's organic."
"D: Very drinkable beer, nice moderate abv with refreshing flavors, a really good summer sessionable ale like the name says."
"M/D: Light body, sparkling carbonation, finishes with a dry resiny smack."
"Will have this again."
"D) A delicious summer beer. I would definitely have another."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it might not be the best beer out there but it's still a solid beer to drink for a while."
"The taste is light, refreshing, a true summer ale. The lemony tartness is most noticeable, with some sweetish malts and wheatiness coming through. Things dry up a bit in the finish. There is not much aftertaste for better or worse. The texture is a touch course, but only a touch, due to the wheat, but not mouth prickly. It isn't a smooth beer, but neither is it particularly rough. The herbal lemony flavors are pretty much what defines this beer. There is a slightly drying, leafy hop, pepperiness in the finish and that keeps things a bit interesting too. I'd come back for another. If it means anything, I had this after a very boozy DIPA and this really cleansed the palate. Points added right there."
"D: One of the best summer beers I've had... refreshing, fruity, wheaty... just awesome."
"drinkability is this beer's strong point. plenty of flavor, but the crisp, dry finish leaves you salivating for the next sip. I am usually not a fan of summer beers, but this one is nice."
"Overall, a great surprise."
"I think it's well-done for the style. I'm not too high on releases from this brewery as they have been somewhat lackluster in the past. However, this would not be out of place on a hot day."
" This one is easy drinking with some nice complexity and bonus points for being organic. Easily one of the best overall summer session brews I've had."
"Whether or not this is a session ale at 5%, it is delicious and light for summertime drinking, and still packed with flavor."
