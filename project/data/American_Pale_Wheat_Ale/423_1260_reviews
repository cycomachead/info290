"Best wheat ever. Lightly tart banana citrus smooth. Love it really cold. Refreshing. Beautiful color and head. Winner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is likely the best example of the style that I have had, and considering by definition these beers are somewhat weak (this one sporting only 4.4%abv) it is very good overall. I would prefer this one on tap."
""
"This is a lemony beer that drinks great on the disc golf course."
""
""
""
""
"3/11/15 (Draft The Laughing Man Washington DC) - Golden misty pour, thin white head, minimal carbonation. Light taste and texture, wheat grassy scent and taste."
""
""
"Light and refreshing wheat beer.  Very drinkable.  I could see having a few of these on a hot summer day."
""
""
"Pleasantly surprised.  The hint of lemon adds a nice touch to this well-balanced sweet beer.  Colors vary from a yellow wheat to a brownish yellow throughout the beer. Perfect for a nice evening outdoors in KC, MO.  Hoping it comes to the East Coast."
""
""
""
"O: Solid example of the style. The nose is the best part; the rest is good just not quite as complex. Sill recommended to try"
""
""
""
""
"O - Might try it again on a warm summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
"I think it's funny how this site has changed it's rating system like 4 or 5 times in the last year. Anyways, this beer is solid. Wouldn't expect anything less from this great brewery"

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Small amount of head, deep gold colored with flecks expected from an unfiltered wheat. Aroma is a citrusy bread. They added yeast before bottling to create a secondary fermentation and you can tell by smell. Taste leaves something to be desired. A little thin, drinks like water. Probably wouldn't buy again if in the mood for a wheat beer. Not that its awful, just a lot better available in price range."
""
""
"Drinkable, but nothing terribly special. Would have expected more from Boulevard."
""
"Drank on tap. Thin water like body and mouthfeel. Little to no flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours cloudy straw under a 2” pillowy white foam cap that slowly dissipates and leaves thick, clingy lace. Lemon, green apple, yeast and honey aromas with some white bread fill the nose.  Dry, tart, lemony palate over white bread with moderately low hops, medium-light body and medium carbonation."
""
"A wheat beer with a hint of citrus. Something about this brew makes me happy every time I taste it. Would recommend everyone try it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Low B-"
""

"When people ask me how I got so cool I tell them that I've been developing this yogurt for many years and it has become a tasty item in my fridge."

"Pours hazy golden color with a 2 finger width carbonated head.  There is mild head retention and very little to no lacing.  Very carbonated.  Orange peel and coriander dominate the aroma.  Wheat taste up front with slight bitterness and a mildly spicy orange peel taste at the end.  Aftertaste is mild.  Decent beer.  Very drinkable but certainly not the best of the bunch."

"O: This is a shockingly bland offering from Boulevard. Not without its good points, but it fails in the flavor department."
""
""
""
"Cloudy yellow body with an inch of white head. Wheat, grain, malty aroma. Slightly sweet. Bready with a touch of spice and a hint of banana. Too grainy but still drinkable. Average."
""
"Very standard.  If I thought about the typical flavors and aroma of an American wheat it would be just like this.  Maybe even more ""standard"" than Sam Summer which was my until now Platonic Amwheat ideal."
""
""
"Very good, nice KC flavor."

"12 oz bottle from variety pack. Pours hazy golden with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head, nice lacing and lovely carbonation. Aroma is of yeast, wheat malt, spices and ripe apples. Body is medium and smooth. Wheat malt, yeast, ripe fruit and spices fill the mouth. Finish is long and spicy. Quite good for a wheat beer."

"The usual disclaimer applies here - I'm not a wheat beer guy.  But this one is a huge seller so I figured I'd see what all the fuss was about.  Yeah, it's pretty good for the style, and I could see why most of Kansas City cools off with this in the summertime."

"O - I was expecting more after hearing good thing about Boulevard Wheat. While it is a crisp refreshing beer it is definetly average at best."

"Easy to drink, crisply satisfying wheat beer that ranks as one of my favs - perfect for summer but drinkable all year long with the extra body lent by the wheat content."

"OVERALL: this is an excellent wheat beer, I frequently order this beer with food, this style has broad appeal so you could serve to large number of guests and would be a ""safe"" choice. This is an excellent brewer and I can't wait to try more beers from them."

"At at royals game, one tap wheat.  First off I am not a wheat beer guy so this review will be lacking.  Pours a golden haze as an Unfiltered beer should.  Aroma of sweet fruit perhaps fig or apricot.  Taste and mouthfeel are undesirable for me but in the realm of wheat beer in the higher levels of wheat beer.  Good for the genre."
"Pours a hazy straw-yellow in color with a small white head that settles down to just to a thin layer on top and sides of the glass. Some streaky lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma is of wheat grains and yeast. The taste is the same with a hint of light spice as well. Clean and crisp and goes down easy. No harsh or bitterness at all. Great anytime of the year and one of my favorite wheats."

"Overall this is a good beer, but an unpleasant finish and too much sweetness detract heavily. This is a step up from a beer like blue moon, but a step below or two from other craft wheat ales. (77/100)"
"O: Super balanced beer in all ways. Not super complex, and at 4.4% ABV this is session material. This is easily a go-to if you are in a rush and don't have time to mull options. If you are saving a pal from the watery American lager style, this is a good starter as well. Overall, Boulevard has produced another hit!"
""

"Poured from the aluminum pint bottle into a goblet. Watery, airy head quickly goes away leaving a fizzy bulb of cloudy, slightly grainy beer that resembles Thera Flu. Tangy, lemony aroma. Flavor is just not really there for me. I get some sweetness and some yeast and lemon, but overall this really hangs back. Mouthfeel is actually pretty satisfying; I feel like there's just some flavor there that I am not getting. I am a fan of hefeweizen in general but I'd handily take a Paulaner or White Rascal over this. This tastes like a fuller-bodied Blue Moon to me, but I wouldn't refuse one. This'd be great on a hot day or to take camping or boating. This would also probably greatly benefit from a lemon or orange wedge but I've already drank most of it so screw it. Decent, but there are a number of widely available wheats in the same price point that I would rather buy."

"Decent, well balanced wheat. Not an overly complex beer but what it does...it does well. At 4.4 ABV this is an easy drinking session that would be perfect as an entry level wheat as well as a staple in most connoisseurs rotation...cheers!"

"Pours out a lemony-yellow/light orange in color with a one finger white head with little retention. Definitely looks unfiltered as there is no translucency. Smell is pretty malt forward. Definitely sweet caramel and almost a little lemon in the smell. Taste is definitely some nice caramel malt with a little hint of Belgian yeast which I think is quite tasty. There is definitely a little banana/clove taste from the yeast that really works well. Not really much flavor from any hops which seems really appropriate for the style. The mouthfeel is thin as here isn't too much carbonation in the beer. Overall a fairly nice tasting beer. Not anything I would go out of my way for like some of the better Boulevard beers but it's not a bad beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"M- Body is mild to medium. Crisp, clean and refreshing. Easy drinking. Finishes mildy sour. Not dry really."
"Light gold in color with plenty of fine sediment throughout. Minimal head dissipates entirely,but I see good carbonation bubbles. I get a whiff of pale wheat and telltale American Wheat yeast that gives it a bit of an orange like aroma. Light in body with a light bitterness from the yeast from a slight orange like bite. The pale wheat is a soft contrast to that bitterness."

"Overall: Wheat is up front, and is close enough to big american lager to serve as a good gateway for craft newbies."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very crisp and refreshing. A great brew for anytime, but mostly a summer beer. Classic standard wheat beer done right. It has a cloudy golden complexion, though you can still see through it. It's definitely on the malty side and has a pleasant aftertaste that is almost fruity or lemony, though excellently subtle."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is one of my favorites. It pours a hazy color with a two finger head. Thw smell is a pretty standard beer smell. It's got a great flavor while still being very drinkable. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone who is trying to transition from a BMc background into craft beer."

""
""
"O - My review would probably be different if I had this on an outdoor patio in June or July. Unfortunately I had it in a cool restaurant while watching playoff baseball on TV after dinner. Seems like it would be a nice summer beer for me."
""
""
"Fantastic wheat beer. Has a great cloudy look for a wheat and tastes incredibly fresh. Pours with a huge four finger head and has a great odor very easy drinking beer. Goes down very smooth leaves the palate feeling clean and leaves you wanting more. Not a great beer for the time of year but something I could enjoy a lot over the summer."
""
"O- This is an OK beer....not really good, certainly not bad. Nothing really pops on this one. Probably the biggest drawback is I was drinking Ayinger BrauWeiss last night and compared to that this is swill. But compared to say....Bud light this would be great, if that makes any sense. Not my favorite from Boulevard."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A mellow, unambitious wheat, there's no mistaking this for a hefeweizen. It's your basic no-frills American wheat. There are better options."
"A pretty standard, clean, American Wheat beer. Suits in a pinch, or ice cold on a hot summer’s day, but mostly something that I don’t found overly interesting."
""
""
""
"O: Overall I like this beer and it would be a great beer for enjoying during the summer on a boat."
""
"The Boulevard Wheat Ale can best be described as a faux-hefeweizen. While it does have a nice wheat flavor and mouth feel, it somehow feels lacking compared to other wheat beers that i've tried. It's somewhat bland, but by no stretch of the imagination bad. Wheat beers like this are good companions to spicy food, while it's not for me i imagine that under the right circumstances this or the Schlafly Hefeweizen could be a religious experience to a Missouri beer drinker with a tongue for unfiltered wheat beers who only previously drank piss water like Bud or Natty Light. Give it a try if you've been drinking nothing but lagers."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Not bad , but not my favorite from Boulevard (Boss Tom's Golden Bock is their best in my opinion.)"

"O- this is a straight up, simple and unoffensive wheat ale that would appeal nicely to non craft drinkers, but is pretty light overall. Not bad for a hot summer day but not something I would go back to elsewhere"
""
""
""
""
"Overall exactly what it promised to be. Slightly more tart than expected but not unpleasant. If you're a fan of the style check it out. If you don't particularly like wheat beers this won't change your mind"

"Starts like liquid bread and smells as such then later lemony citrusy flavors kick in. Just a small hop presence but still well balanced. I think a small squeeze of lemon really enhances the flavor. A refreshing brew for summer and all other seasons."
""
"Unfiltered Wheat pours a hazy golden straw color, with a large long lasting white lacing head. Their really isn't much of an aroma, very weak citrus notes. The taste is more mellow flavor, with nice hints of citrus, and a creamy wheat undertone, very crisp. Very easy to drink, and flavorful. Overall a nice wheat beer."
"An excellent example of this great summer-perfect beer style. Clean and wheaty. Not the most exciting beer in the world, but a good summer beer or a nice light beer alternative. Highly recommend."

"O: Good ABV, nice flavor, easy to drink wheat beer. Not a bad little beer."
"Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat Beer ---4/5"
"Overall - Cowtown v. Cowtown: even 550 miles from Kansas City, this is, interestingly, the cheapest non-AAL in a Fort Worth liquor store. (One would think Rahr could slip something competitive in there.) Unfortunately, this is no bargain; disappointing—would not buy again."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a pleasant drinking light beer. not super big or flavorful but certainly pleasant and within the style. certainly easy to drink large amounts on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours yellow into the glass with a bit of head that disappates quickly. No lacing present and the head has completely disappeared during consumption. Nice unfiltered look. As expected wheat on the nose with not much else going on. Flavor is good - again wheat dominating with a hint of citrus. Clean drinking."

"O - Still new to this style, but I give this beer credit for offering hope of the existence of a hefeweizen which I may, someday, truly admire. All in all not bad, just not great."
""
""
""
"Half finger head with good retention on a cloudy pale gold body. Aroma is simple, mostly wheat, some pale malts and generic herbs. Flavor is a little dull and simple with some light lemon custard citrus, wheat, light grains. Best part of this one is the mouthfeel which is creamy and smooth with moderate carbonation. Highly drinkable but not very flavorful or memorable."
""
""
""
""
"O - A good solid wheat beer. Very drinkable. Would be good with a spicy meal because it goes down fast and easy. Great flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a disappointing beer. It would be nice on a hot day when you just want to pound a beer. The flavor is fleeting and the mouthfeel is dry and crisp. There just isn't much here. I'll definitely be avoiding this in the future."
""
""
"Overall: I really like “wheat” type beers and this is one of my all-time favorites. I have had this beer before but I am reviewing this while drinking it. I live maybe 30 min. from the brewery so I can usually get this beer fairly fresh. It is not very bitter and the strong citrus gives it a really refreshing taste. This is a great summer beer and goes very well with grilled fish in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The wheat gets played down a bit in the taste but the citrus is still solid and flavorful along with a mild dry finish. I would like to try one again that is fresh."

"O: Not my favorite style – and probably the most cloudy unfiltered beer I ever drank."

"O- Very drinkable beer. Has been my spring and summer goto beer for years. Unfiltered Wheat was actually the first bottle of beer I had. I think this has been, consistently, one of the best beers Boulevard has made."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"-Overall 3.5: Good wheat beer that would be a really refreshing lawnmower beer. Light and bubbly and would be perfect for the summer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A pretty good American pale wheat ale, nothing special, but nothing wrong with it either."
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm dissapointed that I dirtied up a weizen glass for this. It looks like a wheat beer, but that is where it stops. I bought this in date (BBD 12/3/12) but drank it a little late. I may seek out a younger bottle to see if my opinion changes. Surely seven days wouldn't make it this bad though..."
""
""
"O: Moderate tasting, somewhat thin wheat beer with some decent if underwhelming flavors. Overall, fairly mild, easy to drink, but not something to have if seeking bold flavors."
""
"O: Not bad, just bland. Its refreshing finish and top notch drinkability gives it a few brownie points. It doesn't measure up to a good hefeweizen, though."

"Poured into a snifter seems highly carbonated. Faint smells of straw and grassy notes with hints of lemon. I am not detecting any banana or clove notes in this beer. I assuming because this is an American Wheat Beer and most likely the yeast they use is not the same as Bavarian yeast. Lacing is acute and dwindles away. A very simplistic wheat beer with very little or any unique qualities. The head is solid white and dissipates quickly. A good amount of yeast floats about in this beer and settles with time. Not the best wheat beer by far but I have to admit its easy to drink and sure offers a lot more then the domestics to be found. Liquid white bread anyone? Reminds me of wonder bread oddly :D"
""
"It is a golden straw yellow with some haziness to it and no signs of carbonation too. No head of foam too. it smells like bready and sweet malts. Taste is along the same idea too. Pretty straightforward wheat with mild hop characteristics. The mouthfeel of the is smooth, medium bodied, medium carbonation, and a bit chewy. This beer overall is a standard wheat beer. Not much going on and pretty basic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had on tap at the Corner Slice in Greensboro over the weekend.Poured into a standard pint glass a hazy lemony yellow color with a thinner nicely formed white head.Aromas of faint toasted wheat and spice mainly,not much there really.Flavors are light but pretty refreshing with lemon and toasted creal-like flavors,again light but goes down easy.A pretty standard wheat ale but it's better than alot out there of the same ilk."

""
""
""

"O: I'd have this again, but I wouldn't kill for it."

"Really pretty standard, as other reviewers seem to agree, wheat and lemon."

""
""
"0 - a moderately good wheat ale"
"Overall: Nothing overly complex, but a good sessionable light beer. I will pick this up again. Perfect for a hot summer's afternoon."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and could be rather sessionable on a hot summer day."
""
"O: Super simple as you would probably expect. Very light aroma and flavors. Tasty enough and very sessionable for sure. Don't let the poor numbers phase you, it's just because it's such a light beer. There is nothing bad about it at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Refreshing, easy to drink, and very sessionable. I enjoyed this beer and it is a nice easy beer for the hot summer."
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This wheat is a refreshing brew perfect for the dog days of summer. Reminiscent of a German Hefeweizen, this pale wheat ale would pair well with farmers cheese and grilled meats."
"Review from 7/2010 notes. Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours an opaque yellow amber. Slight head and no lacing. Aroma of wheat and a hint of sulphur. Pleasant light wheat, slight citric flavor with a slightly hoppy finish. Understated, but nice. Will buy again for a light summer beer."
""
""
"A high benchmark for the original version of this style, subtle hops so they are relying mostly on the malt backbone and the fermentation here. Boulevard nails the style."
"O- I think this is an above average take on a wheat. More flavor and body than some summer beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not bad. Not great either, but very sufficient as a more flavorable-than-average session beer."
""
""
""
"O: This beer gets some crap from craft drinkers but it is what it is: a refreshing American wheat beer and it doesn't hurt that this ist he beer that got me into craft beer"
"This is my favorite beer. I love the weight of the beer and the murky color. It has lighter notes but not so much that you think of it as it fruity beer. Though some with serve this with a citrus slice, the sunniness of this beer allows it to stand alone. Best when served in a glass (as most beers are), but very manageable in a bottle."
""
"Overall a real enjoyable and solid wheat ale, going to enjoy finishing this six pack!"
""
"At 4.4%ABV, Boulevard's Unfiltered Wheat is drinkable with an ability to be quite sessionable. This is an excellent beer to introduce friends and family into craft beer culture. However, the uneventful taste and weak aroma didn't endear itself to me. Although I am glad I tried this offering, there are many other wheat beers on the market that I would reach for first."
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: The bottle I had was expired by over a month. However, I don't think that a fresh bottle could have improved the taste too much. As far as wheat beers go, there are definitely some better options out there."

"Really nice straw yellow appearance with a bountiful head and tons of lacing. The smell is yeast, bread, an initial hit of clove, and a touch of lemon with some hop finish. This has a nice mouthfeel, but its taste is lacking some body. Overall its taste is very much like a simple bread, but it lacks some character. While this won't fill you up on a hot day, its going to leave you feeling a bit empty in a different way - that initial hint of clove dissipates and there is no bannana flavor found in beers of a similar style."
"It's got a nice hazy appearance that is crisp and clean with a smooth and dry mouthfeel. Incredibly drinkable with mild citrus notes and a good wheat presence. Seriously, at 4.6% its got enough flavor to be interesting but is so easy drinking, this is a summer session beer for sure....what else do you want?!?!"

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of lemon and wheat. Taste is the same, a wheat tang, some lemon, very easy drinking and refreshing. Feels full bodied in the mouth and is a good warm weather beer."

"On tap at Hops and Pie. Bright, cloudy, glow in the dark yellow. Seriously hazy appearance. Smells so subtle, wheat and not much else. Flavor is not bad just so subtle and almost watery. I could probably pound this all day long but I'm not sure I'd want to. It seriously had so little flavor. I guess you could call it beer."

"O: A decent wheat ale. Nothing spectacular and lacking in several areas."
""
""
""
""
"O- A great start for people looking to get into craft beer. It's easily available on draft and bottle, a great session beer."
""
"Note: I did enjoy this beer but in expecting a wheat I was a little bit disappointed."
""

""
""
""
""

"O- Good, not great. Would certainly brab one at or brin some to a party, but might not buy for self."
"O-Easy to drink wheat beer, light in flavor. More tart than most. Not my favorite of the wheats."
""
"Overall- There is not much to this beer, and I cannot say I am either impressed or disappointed by how it tastes. You will not miss much if you skip this one."

"Pours a slightly hazy straw yellow with a fluffy white head and a bunch of yeast floating up and down. Aromas are muted, definite wheat with not too much else. Wheat and a bit of sweetness along with some light yeast character. For a moment, I thought I had some banana flavour, but it never came back sadly. Crisp and strongly carbonated. A good low hopped (classic) American wheat, without any major flaws. A definite summer drinker."
""
""
"The mouthfeel is light with carbonation being moderate for the style. Overall it was a pretty nice flavored, easy drinking beer. Pretty clean and refreshing and decent for the style."

"The aroma is pleasant and muted, non-offensive. It has a nice wheaty taste with a slight hint of citrus. Many people add a lemon to this beer to add more citrus. Nice creamy mouthfeel for a wheat beer and easy-drinking. Overall a good beer that sometimes gets overlooked because it truly is everywhere in the midwest. Hey, it beats a macro."
""
""
""
"Cloudy yellow in color. Forms a large fizzy white head. Little retention. No lacing. Smell is Mostly of brad and wheat with some light notes of banana ans spice. Flavor is similar, but very light. Lots of wheat and a light tartness, but little else. Light bodied. Simplistic, but an Easy drinker"
""
""
"Cloudy body similar to a well built IPA. Nice 2 finger head which dissapeared rather quickly. Smells of wheat, what, and wheat. Maybe a bit of lemon zest and a touch of orange. Taste? Same as smell. Not much of a hop presence at all. If you're a hop head this isn't for you. Refreshing and crisp but not much more."

"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied with ample carbonation. Fairly smooth. Overall, this is definitely not the best wheat beer out there, but it's refreshing and easy to drink. Just about defines average for me for the wheat beer style. One of the beers that got me into craft and not something I mind revisiting from time to time."

"Taste is sharp, melding the wheat and yeast with some citrus tones. Not an overly complex wheat beer, but quite enjoyable and session-worthy nonetheless."
""

""
""
"Thanks to TMoney2951!"
""
"Light toasted bread flavor up front. Softens, with notes of doughy bread and banana. Zesty citrus hop juiciness and bitterness comes in and lightens up the malt. Turns yeasty in the finish, but cleans up and dries out in the end. Lingering banana and citrus. Moderate body with a slightly creamy feel. Not bad."

""

"This beer pours a light yellow color with almost no carbonation, and a sliver of a white head. Very light and easy to see through. The nose is very simple, wheat, lemon, and a tiny bit of malt. The taste follows suit, with a little bit of sourness on the fringe of the flavor. Not a big fan. The taste is almost non-existent really. Feel is light w/ low carbonation. Overall, this is barely a step up from the macro BMC's of the world. Not worth drinking, unless there's nothing else available."
""
""
"Overall - A decent beer at best. There is 100 different beers of the style that are better. I haven't bought this beer in years, this one was part of a round not purchased by me. Probably won't buy it, but that doesn't necessarily mean its bad. Its a great transition beer for swill drinkers."
""
""
""
""
"Rarely do I ever seek out this sort of beer but this came in a sampler pack I helped to kill, and I was quite impressed with it. Very delicate but wonderfully quenching. A bit more flavor would have been nice, but I'd rather have this than an over-the-top banana bomb of a wheat brew."

"Appearance is cloudy gold, and it should be it is an unfiltered wheat ale. Smell is very nicely hopped and has the right citus aromas. Mouthfeel is somewhat disappointing, lingers somewhat to long. Taste, this is a nice wheat that will compete with the more popular brands. Overall this is an ok beer one we will enjoy but not deploy often. Good with all types of bar food."

"Overall an average because someone could enjoy drinking this beer. It was just too mild for me but it was not bad tasting or smelling."

"looks like a standard wheat beer, with a few floating yeast bits and an excited head. something was off with the aroma though, a tartness of overripe fruit maybe, almost vinegary in the nose, maybe not quite, but something a bit unpleasant was there for sure. tasted better than it smelled, as the intense carbonation highlighted some of the more subtle grassy flavors. overall a pretty average beer, but i likely wont buy this again. i reckon it missed the mark a bit here, boulevard usually makes very good beer"
"This must be a great summer beer, drinking it on a cool fall night, it's still pretty good."
"Overall: Disappointing, but I'm used to that with this style. With the notable exceptions of Gumballhead, A Lil' Sumpin', and a few more brews, American pale wheats are an uninspired bunch. This beer is no different."
"I wouldn't seek it out, but it was pretty nice. So crisp I could see it being a decent session beer."
"The mouthfeel has medium carbination, and a medium viscosity body."
"Last beer of the night is Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat....again my neighbor is AWESOME!!! The Unfiltered poured a hazy yellow in my tulip glass. Decent carbonation forms a nice white head, both that fade with time. The smell is dominated by wheat/barley. The taste is a good beer taste...heavy wheat/barley with good balance hops. The mouthfeel is good, the low ABV helps to make this a decent session beer. Overall I think this is a great beer."
"Overall: This is a pretty good wheat beer. The nose and taste are well done. The appearance is nice for the style. The area that could be improved the most is mouthfeel. Overall, a pretty good beer. Will buy again."
"Drinkability - a good session wheat. Kudos to Mike for giving me this one out of his cooler at the family picnic this past summer. Best by 10/3, let's get 'er done!"
"Very plae yellow, quite cloudy and chunks of sediment float throughout. Zero foam. Wheat smell. Tart, open taste that fades into a softer close. No bitter to speak of. Clean finish. Maybe - a hint of lemon in there at the front. Real damn good though."
"O- Undesirable, even compared to other mass-market wheat beers."
"Overall Drinkability - Refreshing. Flavorless. The Bud Light of wheat beers. Almost all of the points I'm awarding this beer for the overall score have to do with it's refreshment factor and for nothing else."
"O- Don't drink it unless you're ticking"
"Overall: Once again, its offensive because it takes no risks and intends not to offend anyone. In Kansas and Missouri, this is a big seller I am told. I can see why. However, Boulevard is much better than this beer. Don't let this one fool you, Boulevard is a killer brewery. Its just that it seems that most breweries have to make their unoffensive mainstream brew in order to pay for them being able to make masterpieces like Brett and Tank 7."
"Ordered this beer tonight at a local Cajan restaurant. It was listed only as ""Boulevard"". The server said he thought it was a lager. What showed up was a pint glass with a cloudy golden colored brew typical of a weizenbier. After checking with the bar, I discovered it was in fact the Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat beer. As a Wheat Beer this was at best unremarkable but drinkable. It tasted like a light beer with hardly any alcohol and had a slight wheat flavor with an early hint of citrus. Overall it was pretty bland but a good thirst quencher."
"I picked up a Boulevard mixed twelve pack last week at Argonaut. This was one of the included beers, and it proved quite refreshing on a late summer evening. Poured a hazy light golden color with a solid white head. Aromas of wheat and toasted malts. On the palate, light bodied and refreshing, with flavors of wheat and toasted malt."
"Overall: Not impressed, this is a pretty weak offering from Boulevard."
"Really easy drinking wheat beer though not a whole lot of flavor. I expected a little more from Boulevard but they did make a light bodied wheat beer you can drink a few of and not get a heavy wheat settling. At about $2 a piece (which I think is mostly for the cost of the aluminum bottle) it’s kind of pricey for what you get."
"D: Could drink a few of these at dinner, went well with grilled chicken."
"Best By date: 11.15.11"
"Pours a hazy, nearly opaque honey yellow; the way I poured it, I did not get much head, but that could be my fault. Aroma is wheaty and yeasty with just a hint of fruit, about average but still appealing. Flavor is typical of a good wheat beer, wheaty, yeasty, subtly fruity. Texture is smooth and fairly fizzy with some good body. A good summer beer."
"O: well this brew was definitely more exciting when I didn't know what else the world of craft beer had to offer. It is highly drinkable, however it comes off as pretty bland."
"Overall its ok, just ok"
"Overall a good well balanced summertime wheat. Best part I got to enjoy these pool side in relax mode."
"Starting my way through the current sampler box right here. It pours a pretty clear straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises lemon zest, black pepper, rock salt, and a touch of honey. Lemme see if I can properly put my impression of this smell into words: It's refreshing and pleasant, but also unexpected, which is slightly off-putting. God, I hope that makes some sense. The taste holds notes of wheat, light lemon zest, light black pepper, a pinch of salt, and a decidedly light undercurrent of caramel beneath it all. The body is pretty light, with a very light moderate carbonation and a very slightly grainy feel. Overall, an okay wheat beer, but the bit of salty character (which I normally welcome) seems very out-of-place, and everything else is just kinda bland and boring. Not a bad thirst-quencher, though."
"The beer was a nice hazy pale yellow color with a foamy white head that left plenty of lacing. The smell is mostly hay, grass, lemon and yeast. It tastes similar but a bit tart with wheat, lemon and bread. It's light with prickly carbonation and a has a slightly dry finish. This is just a well made wheat beer, I would drink it again."
"D: This is a great wheat beer that is subdued but well crafted.  I absolutely love this brew on a hot summer day ... light, crisp, tasty, and refreshing."
"O: Not impressed should have picked one of the major label amderican brews."
"overall - decently in the session range for a brew, like the lemongrass and carbonation tinge quite a bit, tends to sell out at the local Fred Meyer regularly"
"O: Not a bad beer, but nothing special. Would drink again."
"Overall-Underwhelmed. I may just give up trying wheat beers overall"
"O- Pretty decent beer, nice for a session or the summer."
"While there wasn't anything necessarily unpleasant, it was just a very lack-luster beer."
"Extremely drinkable--could have these on the porch for hours on a hot and sticky day. Extremely impressed with Boulevard for making a great but light craft brew."
"I’ll admit I’m not the biggest wheat beer guy, but this is pretty good for the style. Extremely drinkable and hit the spot on this hot summer day."
"Libation: A light, drinkable summer brew that is held back by a mild sour taste. It's decent."
"O- This is a solid summer beer. Refreshing and crisp with nice flavor. The aroma was relatively weak, but otherwise a solid summer wheat beer."
"This makes for a good warm weather beer. It's kind of smooth and easy to drink. The alcohol is a bit low, but that just means you can drink more of it."
"O- not the best wheat beer by a longshot, but pleasant enough. i can see myself drinking this after mowing the lawn. i appreciate the low ABV."
"Honestly, with summer coming I would buy another few of these when it starts getting warmer."
"Overall- Drinkable and somewhat refreshing, just not a lot of flavor going on, with very little lingering aftertaste. I can see the crossover appeal of this, but it is simply lacking in pronounced flavor. I will drink my other bottle from the sampler pack, but I won’t be revisiting thereafter."
"Overall though its range of flavors varied, I would consider it a very good beer for lightly flavored food--without the headache you might get from a comparable wine or malt liquor drink. And without the overpowering hopping you find in other hefweissens like Blue Moon. Very drinkable, just not really sippable."
"TO STYLE, BUT NOT BAD NOR GOOD!"
"This is a very good, light and quenching summer ale. It is not very complex but highly drinkable without becoming too one-dimensional. I could easily drink this again during the hot summer to come."
"Overall: This is a great wheat beer that is light and refreshing but still manages to provide a good amount of flavor and complexity. A wonderful session beer."
" A very nice example of the style."
"O: A decent pale wheat ale. Nice and refreshing on a hot afternoon."
"The taste is much more pronounced, a mellow blend of wheats and grains and funk. Very easy to drink, goes down smooth."
"Pretty good beer overall. Refreshing but not overly flavorful."
"O: Kind of a letdown in terms of the beer itself but the bottle is the highlight here."
"D- Drinks fairly well, but it most definitely on the boring end."
"Poured this beer into a weizen glass. Slightly hazy golden body with a thin white head. Some solids were apparent at the bottom of the bottle. Smell is of light wheat and citrus. Taste is mostly wheat, as it should be, but also some notes of citrus and slight hops are also present. Mouthfeel is a little light, but not bad. On a warm day it would likely feel just right. Overall, this is a mediocre representation. I have found other wheat beers that I enjoy more and I'll stick with those as staple items."
"Drunkability: this beer is damn refreshing. It may be knocked for its simple flavor but I think it is good. I'm not really looking for conmplexity in a wheat beer."
"D: Despite the low marks in some categories, I find this beer extremely drinkable/sessionable. A great flagship brew for Boulevard."
"overall this is a good idiot beer - a total no thinker to to hit the spot on a hot summer day - however if consumed on a hot day i would chill the hell out of this beer since the body is a little heavy"
"O: I can see why this is their most popular beer, and it is good for the style, however, the word ""sessionable"" doesn't come to mind when thinking of this beer. Overall, I liked this beer, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"Appearance has a cloudy straw orange color with a thick crisp head that lingers leaving nill lace. Smell of weak spice, citrus and yeast. Taste is again a little weak with the malt, wheat and above aromas. Mouthfeel is medium with not a big spike of carbonation as noticed in other American wheat beers. A mellow non complex easy drinking wheat beer."
"Drink- Good palate cleanser after dinner before the dessert. Had because the company paid for it. Probably wont have it again."
"Drinkability: One of my favorite wheats - good, easy drinking. Great for a summer day. A staple of the Midwest."
"Not too complex but very smooth-drinking, tasty, and balanced. Refreshing and great for the start of spring...!"
"Poured into a wheat beer glass. Appearance was cloudy golden amber. Gave 2 fingers of head. It smelled of grains, wheat, and hops. Tasted grainy and malty with nice hop balance with prevalence of of wheat coming through as well. Nice medium mouthfeel. Hoppy bitter finish. Overall, very good... Very ""yeasty"" and refreshing. Great for a hot summer day. Very impressed."
"This beer was served on tap at the the local Applebys. (I had a gift card to use people)... I asked for this to be served without the damn lemon.... The beer poured nicely, created a 1 finger white foamy head. The color was a light yellow and it was cloudy, hence the unfiltered style. The smell was only average, it was very yeasty- I did not pick up much citrus or hop aroma. The mouthfeel was average, slightly watered down. The taste was average. This is a great ""starter beer"" for trying to get someone out of the American Light Lager Box. 7 Years ago, I would have loved this. The taste is not bad, just not much going on- Very yeasty, slight wheat taste, no hop or fruit notes to speak of. This is a good beer- I think it would be great for a hot summer day."
"Overall: A good session beer. I would like to see it a little bit dryer and be more crisp. I am drinking this past suggested date, so a fresher example could be better."
"Sorry for the anecdotes, but this beer is special to me and I wanted to give it it's due."
"O: Not my first choice, but far from my last. A good representation of the style. Thank you, Boulevard."
"All in all this is definitely a summer beer but  even if it is winter time I will never turn one of these down as it is one of my favorites!"
"Drinkability: I feel bad hitting this so hard, since it is a flagship beer of my local brewery. Indeed, this is an extremely popular craft beer among BMC drinkers in the region, and was probably the first non-BMC beer I drank with any regularity. It fails to satisfy now that I've broadened my horizons, but this would still be my second choice behind a Sam Adams at many local restaurants. It would also have it's place as a thirst quencher on a hot day at the ballpark or after mowing the lawn."
"Decent level of carbonation, not over the top. All in all, an average offering for this genre."
"Overall - I can't say that it's the worst beer I've had but it isn't a very good wheat. It's not the only reason I reviewed it online, but I'd already written this out in my personal reviews I saw how high of marks it had received here and sought to offer a differing viewpoint. I like wheat beer a lot, I just don't like this one."
"A good session beer, nothing to blow you away, but I could drink plenty of them."
"12 oz single. Looks like there is quite some sediment in this baby..so i took the old school precaution of rolling the bottle before pouring. Attractive bright sunny yellow beer with a lovelly large, white,fluffy head. Aroma is pretty subdued..none of the esters etc that one comes to expect from the style..some slight hay and a wiff of cheese. Taste is sweet ,ripened banana, some bubble gum, wheat bread and candy sugar..overall pretty tasty. Nice spritzy palate on this. Overall very drinkable and a good one for the summer."
"12 oz. twist-off stubby, with clearly marked freshness date. Brewed to 11.5 Plato, hopped to 14 IBUs, fermented to 3.1% ABW, and bottle-conditioned to 2.8 volumes of carbonation. Before the yeast it is a crystal-clear bright gold, with lots of fizz that builds up a crackly white head and leaves light lacing. The yeast makes it opaque and pushes it into yellow territory. Light but pleasant aroma contributes yeast, wheat and a few esters. The flavor is very light as well, almost thin, but there are notes of lemon, toasty crackers, wheat, nutty yeast, grass/hay and a lightly spicy fruitiness. There is almost no bitterness, and the pH is a touch lower than expected, but it makes for a nice flavor-booster. It has a very light and tingly body, and as the carbonation subsides, the flavor grows. Very refreshing and an easy session brew - a solid example of the style."
"D - 3.5 - This is a clean, well-made, approachable beer that would be good ""training wheels"" for a non-craft beer drinker. However, I don't find enough flavor or complexity to consider it a great beer."
"Summary - Easy Drinking beer, that I have had many a time. Not the most interesting but better than alot. You can put down a lot of these in a night."
"D - The grassiness is a little too much for me with this beer. It is light and refreshing, but it does not stand out."
"Drinkability: This is a beer that would go well with food or even without."
"(from notes - tasted April 2010)"
"I think that this beer is outstanding. It may not be the beer that jumps out and grabs you but it is the beer that stocks my fridge. Simple great taste for a great price. Great beer to pair with that famous KC BBQ or just to take to the lake and kick back. I love this beer!! GREAT BEER BOULEVARD BREWING!!!"
"I liked this beer and would definitely drink more than one."
"A fair brew."
"Picked up a sixer from Princeton's on special for $6. The bottle says it's best by February 2011. It remind me a bit of Widmer's Hefe. It's cleaner that a German wheat beer, but there's still a bit of lemon and a hint of spice. There's a sweet wheat malt taste with a bit of cracker and toast crust. I'm left with a bready taste and light lemon drop note. All in all, a good take on the style."
"Price is usually pretty decent for Boulevard stuff, that makes this a recommend in my book so long as you actually like some wheat beers out there."
"Overall/Drinkability: I have had some versions of kölsch and American hefeweizens, but this one seemed to stand out above a good many of them. Overall refreshing, and incredibly drinkable in my opinion. Why while away a hot summer day with BMC when you could sip this stuff instead?"
"D - This is one of Boulevards better beers in my opinion. Not overwhelmingly exciting, but fits the style well and is refreshing."
"Cloudy yellow color with two fingers of white head that had good retention before settling to a thick cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. Looks like a hefewiezen but that is where the similarities end. Slight lemon zest aroma with wheat malt providing the foundation. Wheat flavor with some lemon. Wheat beers are pretty boring without hefe yeast or abundant American hops, and this has neither. Light body with good carbonation. Easy drinking beer that is approachable and inoffensive for the masses. Just ho-hum for beer drinkers expecting a little more from their beer."
"Overall I would like to give this another try when the beer is a lot fresher and for my pretty much first beer of this style it was not so bad."
"D - I have had this beer more times than I can remember. I was pretty shocked when I saw that I hadn't reviewed this yet. As far as APWAs go, this is a decent one that is worth trying. I'll continue to drink this as it is all over St Louis on tap."
"This is a beer that I'm actually not sure I've ever had before and I've discounted it because of its proliferation in this area of the country. A lesson in the weakness of assumptions, this should be classified as a Hefeweizen. It is a good American version of such."
"T- Taste isnt bad either, but its not special. It drinks easy and is nice and crisp and refreshing."
"(21)"
"This beer is beautiful in it's simplicity. It's single-minded, and that single-mind is friggin' tasty, and crisp."
"The beer is crisp and easygoing, yet substantial and thick enough that you realize you're drinking a real beer. Easily Session-able, and preferable in the summer."
"A very solid Session Beer. Low alcohol content with nice lemony wheat flavor, excellent for pounding a few back in the summer or with your buddies during a sports game. Lemon Bitterness pairs well with the spicy BBQ sauces and sweet Pizza sauces associated with the Kansas City/St. Louis region."
"Drinkability: A very easily drinkable wheat beer."
"A light yellow hazy brew with good carbonation and pleasant aromas. The flavor is light and refreshing with light citrus and bready notes. Not ""sour"" like many other lighter wheats. Finish is crisp and clean, making this one rather enjoyable and quite drinkable. Thanks to birchstick for this one!"
"Totally serviceable Wheat beer here, with an easy drinking body and refreshing nature about it. I wasn't blown away by the flavor profiles but this was zesty and crisp enough on the palate to keep me interested for the most part during the duration of the glass. Decent summer brew."
"Drinkability: Non-challenging entry-level craft beer, decently refreshing, for summertime consumption."
"Very drinkable beer especially on a summer day."
"Drinkability: Better than average American Wheat, which has a slight Hefeweizen character. Refreshing and crisp."
"Poured a very hazy yellow golden color with a two finger white head that dissipated quickly leaving a bubbly film and a slight crown at the edges. Smell is initially wheaty and has some slight citrusy notes. Taste is similar with the graininess and citrus present as well. Feels very light and crisp with a good carbonation. Overall a nice light drinkable beer great for a summer consumption."
"It's a solid beer for the price."
"Drinkability? A very drinkable wheat beer that has enough taste to keep things interesting. I like."
"D-This is definitely a highly quaffable brew.Not a top-shelf example of the style but a decent effort nonetheless."
"Light, airy, and bubbly"
"7/20/10. ...apologies for reviewing this beer relative to a 'Hefe' standard, but that was how the beer was introduced to me. Regardless of the categorization, the lack of flavor/nose/body was overwhelming. Thanks to 'AleWatcher' for pointing that out to me personally."
"D- This beer is alright in the fact that it doesn't make you think. Very refreshing beer for the summertime. Nothing much else going for this beer. A good gateway beer for the craft world. Well put together but...nothing stands out with it."
"a good blend of sweet sugar, wheat and citrus. not as broad as a well balanced hef but better than most american hef. this american wheat has some sugar cane and citrus quality. a bit soapy floral but very subdued by the hops and sugar. a bit of a zest of peppermint too. good beer. best in a night of mediocre brews."
"16 ounce aluminum bottle, best by 7/23/2010. Served in a weizen glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy straw gold color with an inch white head. Head retention and lacing are average. Aroma is pretty light, the brew smells like wheat, cloves and lemon. Taste is mostly wheat, with a bit of lemon too. Finish is a teeny bit tart from the lemon. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's crisp and well carbonated. Drinkability is good, on a hot day it wouldn't be hard to drink a few of these. I think this is an OK brew overall, it's worth a try."
"RJT"
"Drinkability is high, this is kind of the definition of a sessionable beer. Beer is thin and has some fruit esters on the palate but its all relatively minimal. Beer is good though, overall I'm really enjoying it. Its cold and wet and finishes without a grainy aftertaste. Really enjoyable."
"I have drank this beer many times and never remembered being this disappointed."
"D-This beer is a gateway beer into wheat beer for many in the Midwest, as it is available at many restaurants and bars. It's tasty and dependable."
"M/D: Drinkable, but completely average."
"Medium bodied with a crisp peppery spice frontthat lingers throughtout over the bready yeast and citrus fruit notes into a sweet yet dry finish. The brest yeast is prominent, adding comlexity and fullness tothis beer. There is some Clive and subtle corriander balanced out ny the sweetness fromthe banana citrus peel character. There is a strong lemon peel flavor that becomes more forward as the beer warms. Slightly tart finish. Complex yet very refreshing and easy to drink."
"My overall impression of the brew is that it's an excellent staple beer. Although not fantastic, I have certainly been a repeat customer for this particular product of Boulevard Brewery. In fact, I'm a repeat customer of many of Boulevard's beers, as it's a great brewery."
"Drinkability: light, flavorful, refreshing. This is quite a drinkable beer indeed."
"D: Not very potent in smell or taste but refreshing nonetheless."
"D- Enjoyable beer, nice clean beer for a hot summer day"
"D: Very drinkable beer, and that is one of it's best qualities. Great if you want to have a few with most types of dinner. This was actually my 'intro' beer that exposed me to beer outside of the big 3 lagers. I constantly get friends to try this and it rarely disappoints and helps convert quite a few to try more!"
"overall it is a wheat beer, nothing too special, nothing too terrible, just a wheat beer."
"Tip: this beer is an excellent choice to pair with fish and seafood dishes, especially those with lemon-butter sauces it really complements the food and the food brings out the flavor in the beer in a big way. Also good with pesto and Alfredo pasta dishes as well."
"I found the body on the thin side, but the beer was very effervescent. Drinkability was also just OK. Overall, if this is a Hefe, it's not a very good one. If it's not, then it's a decent beer, but nothing special. This is my first beer from a brewery I've heard nothing but good things about. I hope the rest of the line-up is better."
"I could drink this stuff all day. When all you want is a decent beer to end the day this is it. Is it a masterpiece of brewing genius? No, but it is a good beer."
"Overall it's a pretty good, and extremely sessionable beer. Much happier drinking this than some BMC when there is a limited offering."
"Hazy blone with a pure white head of fizz that leaves very little lace on the glass. The nose is barely a whiff of sour citrus and wheat malt. This beer is light in the flavor department as well. Light wheat malt,soft lemon and clove. Nice medium light mouthfeel with soft carbonation. This beer is way too light for my tastes."
"Overall - A pretty plain, basic beer. Not bad, but not special either. There are better APWA's out there."
"D - Quite refreshing but too much like a glass of cool water on a summer day than something really interesting."
"Golden straw color and hazy, the wheat beer had soft aroma's of wheat and honey. Easy to drink with mellow banana, wheat, light citrius hiding in the background. I felt it was a little lean in body, but quite enjoyable. Certainly a great clean wheat beer for a hot summer day."
"Poured a transparent yellow with a bigh white head and good carbonation. Nose is wheat, citrus, banana. Taste is pretty boring. Nothing but a light fizzy booze until the very end when I found some banana, wheat and citrus. Body wa thin, mouthfeel was to carbonated and not appealing at all."
"This fits the American Wheat profile very well, and is a go to beer for me at bars with less than spectacular craft selections."
"pours a cloudy straw yellow color with with a 2 finger fluffy head that recedes to a off white ring..it looks good the smell is bready with some lemon zest some fruit and yeast..the taste is slight it has a yeast and lemon taste with a tint malt/hop background..the mouth fell was watery and light and just non descript as this wheat beer is its just average at best..so many others wheat brews from new glarus to gumballhead to oberon to a liitle sumpin in my area to buy this one its ok drinkable but its just not memorable wont try this one again..to many other great wheats out there"
"Poured into the glass a medium yellow to dark straw color, very transparent in the glass. A small white head forms on top and quickly dissolves away. The twang of a yeasty scent hits the nose, along with mellow aroma of wheat. It finishes with a light lemon citrus fragrance. A bread and yeast flavor hits the front of the palate, as it reaches the back a mild grassy, with touch of pine bitterness comes through. That bitterness lingers and the taste stays there long after the beer has washed away. A thin watery texture, with the strong feel of carbonation hitting at the halfway point, it continues all the way through till the finish. The beer as a whole is okay, the color is weak and a little lackluster. The scent and taste are true to the style and stay consistent. The feel had a lot more carbonation than I would like. Still, this is solid beer, a good session beer and a very good choice for summertime camping."
"Notes: I didn't necessarily think the flavors were offensive, but there was nothing great about it. One of the weakest beers from Boulevard"
"This beer holds up well, even almost ten years after I had my first it's still a solid example of the style."
"Overall: When I buy the Boulevard mixed case, I drink this beer. I would not pour it out, but would not buy it primarily either."
"This is a beer that I really won't drink from the bottle. I first had it on-tap and haven't been able to make the switch to bottle. It's a very flavorful, yet light beer. My girlfriend will order it when we're out, and she's not much of a beer drinker so that shows that the drinkability is relatively high. This is a great option if you're looking for a good wheat brew."
"D - Like that carbonated lemon water they sell to joggers. Needs more beer characteristics. Lots of lemon and not much else. Easy to drink yes, but in a girly way."
"D) Feels like a beer in mouthfeel. Looks bad. Smells like nothing and tastes weak ... did I get a bad beer?"
"Certainly ""drinkable"". Very smooth, creamy texture and nice sweet and sour balance, with refreshing dryness make this a very ""sessionable"" brew. I could see myself putting this into a summer line-up if it were readily available (though ""thirst-quenching"" and ""refreshing"" year-round. Stands out in a line-up of typically bland pale wheats. For a non-hoppy wheat, this is very nice!"
"Overall/notes: I've had a ton of experiences with this beer. It's in the bottle and on-tap everywhere in CoMo. Nothing great, but an okay beer. I'd like to reiterate: it works a lot better with a lemon."
"Drinkability: Could be a good session beer. Satisfying without being filling."
"Drinkability: As a Kansas Citian this was the first beer outside of Budweiser I'd tried. It was also the beer that showed there was more to beer than the watery taste of Budweiser and other such beers. Coming back to it years later, the Unfiltered Wheat is not quite what I remember. It lacks taste and smell, but overall it is an average American wheat and a decent beer to sip on."
"A great intro beer for the macro-lover, but pretty mild and uninspired for more well-versed drinkers."
"This beer serves an important purpose. It is the largest selling craft beer in the American Midwest. As such, it is the introduction to craft beer for a great many people. It was my first craft beer and look at me now, ma! Kansas City loves this beer; it competes very well with established BMC brands -- its hard to find a Shock Top or Blue Moon tap in KC because BLVD Wheat is so popular. This beer pays the bills and allows Boulevard to make their consistently amazing Smokestack Series. But all of that doesn't mean that Unfiltered Wheat isn't itself an enjoyable product. This is decent beer."
"D: A very crisp and refreshing drink that makes this a very pleasurable experience. Aside from the disappointing appearance, it really holds up."
"A nicely made American wheat beer without being out of balance and tasting artificial."
"The beer feels thin, and the carbonation seems to rapidly dissipate after the bottle is opened, but it's very refreshing and drinkable. I could probably have a pitcher of this during a hot summer night. I bet it's better on tap."
"Overall, an OK wheat. Not much there, but it's not bad."
"D - it's ok, but not interesting enough for me to have another."
"Recommended. I'll bet it's great on tap, outside on a real hot day. Unfortunately, I am having it (mostly warm, as I would prefer) on a really cool day. Indoors. I just have to imagine the poolside, my pool is closed for the season."
"feel is thin and watery too, but with moments of smoothness, punctuated by light acidity. light to moderate, sometimes fluffy carbonation."
"Really nice atmosphere. Decent appearance, and solid, complex, but somewhat subtle nose. Flavor is nice, and feel is ok. Overall, this is a pretty nice quaff."
"Overall: This is an average wheat beer, nothing special but a solid session beer."
"While it's not really full or complex, it makes for a good session or a transition beer for people who haven't had a lot of luck with ales."
"Poured from a 16 ounce metal that were available all over Kansas City during my recent visit. Light tangarine in color, minimal head and lace, A light wiff of fruit, lemon, yeast. Light fruit, light lemon, some yeasty/wheatyness. Just nothing special...decent warm weather sessioner or to wash down a burger, not much beyond the basics."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, although there are better wheat beers out there, this is still a decent beer to pound down for a while."
"Drinkability - excellent session beer until the carbonation and subtle sour flavor catch up with you."
"- Not bad at all, great carbonation, looks pretty, smells pretty... and is overall a decent wheat. Some of the low marks I think are from fans that are just not a fan of the style."
"D: Not terrible, but I can think of a ton of other APWA's I'd reach for over this one."
"The taste was a little offputting at first but it's not bad and certainly drinkable on those hot summer days."
"D. Not my favorite in this style. I wopuld probably try it again in a bottle to be fair."
"I wouldn't go out of my way for this one, seeing as though there are a ton of better examples of this style available. overall not bad though"
"Cheers."
"D: I really enjoyed this. I was incredibly thirsty after work and this hit the spot. Worked my way through 4 of these easily and they refreshed nicely and sit lightly. Didn't feel it was a chore to drink and it makes a very nice summer brew. Told the bartender it is absolutely a contender in a good starter craft to keep at the bar since he is trying to slowly work in a craft beer selection that would appeal to the masses in our town. I think this is a good easy drinker that can be enjoyed by all. Enjoyed it for sure."
"Overall this is a wheat beer that's not that bad but it's also not that good. Not a bad option overall."
"Do not reccomend, easy to drink, but no flavor."
"Got a 6 pack at the Beverage warehouse in Arab AL, really looked forward to this beer, nice packaging, looked interesting, I have never had any other Boulevard beers but read good things about it so I gave this a shot, and I am far from impressed. It starts out good, the beer looks nice, a nice yellow with a little bit of head, the smell wasn't too special, yeast and maybe some citrus, really not that strong, and that's about as good as it gets, this beer barely has any flavor at all, o it is fizzy, but not tasty. If I had to say anything I'd say maybe some citrus but it's really not strong, no real aftertaste either. Not too happy with this beer, this is my first and last 6 pack of this."
"D: This is OK to me, but not great. American Pale Wheat isn't my favorite style, so I'm sure I'm feeling a touch of bias. As a session beer, Unfiltered would do nicely."
"Pours to a slightly cloudy, pale lemony-yellow with thin white head thatg disspiates soon and a little carbonation throughout. Nose is citrusy wheat, with a touch of hops and graininess. Mouthfeel is slightly tingly with a body a little on the thin side. Taste tries to pick up the lemony citrus and wheat of the nose, but seems to be just as much of grain. Finish is slightly watery, short and uninteresting. A ho-hum beer."
"part of the boulevard summer sampler. Pours thin and watered down, not a great appearence here. kinda reminds me of my last drug test for a job I took.... smell and taste are pretty weak too. Feel like I'm barely drinking beer here. By far the worst beer in the sampler, which otherwise, was very good. The only saving grace here is the drinkability. Ovbviously they were going for an easy drinking summer beer, but this lacks any resemblence of anything worth mentioning. Wouldn't recommend, even as a summer lawnmowing type beer."
"Poured into a pint glass from the bottle There was a best by date on the bottle, this particular bottle was still fresh for another couple months. Poured a cloudy very very pale yellow, pale straw color with a nice white head. Leaves nice lacing down the glass. The smell didn't do much for me, wasn't too impressed with it. Wheat, citrus, yeast. Nothing really jumped out to much. Compared to the smell, I was actually surprised by the taste. I didn't think I was going to be able to get into this one but once I tasted it I found I enjoyed it. Wheat and a faint citrus taste. Really refreshing beer, goes down pretty good. Not a style of beer I particularly love, but I enjoy this wheat beer."
"Nothing special, but it's got availability and drinkability. Refreshing and probably non-offensive to someone who your trying to get into the better beer scene."
"Had a 12oz bottle, about a year past its freshness date. The beer was a sort of hazy yellow with no real head to speak of, its little bit retreating rather quickly. Tastewise, it was an overly simple wheat beer with citrus hints that were too mild to give the beer any real worth. It is drinkable if nothing better is on hand (as was the case last night when I tried this), but is otherwise undeserving of your time and money."
"Hot a bad beer. Poured with a white head and no lace. Head almost completely disappeard quickly. Hazy yellow color. Mild wheat beer aroma. Flavor is citrusy as described. Sweet/tart, clean. Pleasant finish. Edgy carbonation. Good summertime beer. Could be a session beer."
"From notes, on Friday, April 10, 2009, I am very impressed with this Boulevard beer. Started off my drinking night with Dale's Pale Ale, then Green Flash West Coast IPA, and then Boulevard's unfiltered wheat, and this one not only put out the hop fire in my mouth, but it was incredibly delicious. I don't understand all the negative reviews on here, because this one hits the mark with me. I guess that's the beauty of BA -- everyone's tastes are different. I wrote Boulevard and told them of my fondness for its unfiltered wheat and they thanked me for my nice comments. This will be a regular in my beer rotation. Thanks Boulevard for not only nice packaging, and freshness dates, but at Friar Tuck in Savoy, IL, a reasonably priced six pack ($6.99)."
"I used to slam these down in college but for now it was a drain pour for me. Sorry Boulevard but this one was brewed for the masses and they can keep it."
"12oz stub. Pours a cloudy and hazy pale yellow with a minimal white head that dissipates very quickly and leaves no lacing on the glass. Aromas are wheat, yeast, and lemon, with slight hints of orange. Mouth-feel is over carbonated and seems rather fizzy in the mouth. Tastes are similar to aromas - yeast, lemon, wheat, trace hop and grassy finish for balance. Quenching for a hot summer day. Very drinkable and one of my favorites for the style."
"Pours a golden straw color with a thin head that dies down to a thin line of bubbles. Even though it is unfiltered this beer was not as cloudy as most wheat beers. Wasn't too impressed with the aromas, or lack of aromas. I could barely detect a fruity yeasty aroma. Flavors are also very simple and muted, a slight bready citrus and that is about it. The finish is nice, a crisp dry finish similar to a white wine. This is very drinkable, however it could have used more aroma and flavor."
"Mouthfeel is somewhat bland, could use a little more carbonation, body light, if not slightly watery, but not entirely unpleasant. This beer's low abv makes it sessionable in the strictest sense of the word. Ok, not unpleasant, but I can find better wheat beers than this."
"D- Boulevard Wheat is widely available in Missouri and is a good fall back when at the bar. There is good reason for this. It's extremely drinkable and not high in alcohol, which makes it a great session beer. It's also very refreshing during a hot day and is a good alternative during football season and tailgates."
"I do rate this beer high on the drinkability, it does go down smooth and easy, and would be easy to have several of these. Very nice choice for just a simple beer you want to enjoy,without getting too deep into its profile. Also would be a good choice for a hot day."
"Drinkability: Just another light, easy-drinking wheat beer. Though it is a bit too high carbonation for me."
" Poured a medium yellow straw color with a finger of head that quickly dissipates. Smells lightly citrus. An easy drinking beer, almost too light for my taste. Smooth up front with a bitter end note. Makes a solid session beer."
"Pours a cloudy, almost electric yellow colored body, with a white color head, small. Has a fruity smell, almost like a peach. Fizzy aroma, but not too strong. Has a watery wheat fruit kind of taste. Fizzy, bad malty taste. Dusty."
"M = Light body, fizzy carbonation, decent mouthcoating."
"I was very disappointed with this one. I've enjoyed it in the past when I was still getting my beer chops, but my experience has amplified the flaws of this beer. My biggest gripe is with the mouthfeel. Way too light-bodied. Way too much carbonation, which really got in the way of what little flavor there was to begin with. It goes down smooth and easy, so it may be a decent transition beer for some, but I can only tentatively recommend that. This is by far the weakest of Boulevard's year-round beers. I seem to remember it being slightly better on tap, so I'll have to test that theory."
"Mouthfeel is fine for the style. It's light in body and has a medium carbonation level. Drinkability is good and I'm sure it would satisfy more on a hot summer day. Unfortunately, it came up way short today."
"D: Crisp and refreshing with a quality wheat flavor and a solid citrus balance. This is a well made example of the style and is extremely easy to drink. Good flavor, good drinkability, good beer."
"It aint the best wheat beer i've ever had, but you can do a lot worse."
"A hazey straw color with a fair white head that dies off after a few minutes and a pretty whimpy lace effect. The aroma is clean but pretty mild wheat and sweet citrus. The flavor is a nice crisp cereal, sweet wheat with a very fine but refreshing carbonation. Very drinkable, a bit thin but nothing unusual for the style. I liked this much more than the pale ale. Not bad, worth a try, especially if you're thirsty and want something that's light."
"Extra: Beer over all taste very good. I was very impress with the appearance. Beer looked beautiful. Neat finish."
"Miles away from a great Imperial Stout, but this is a great beer for what it is. My go-to wheat."
"Drinkability is high. It's a bit boring, but tastey enough and easily sessionable."
"Drinkability: Try some yourself..."
"This beer is good on its own or with a beef or pork centered meal, especially a good hamburger."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle. Pours a very light hazy yellow. Smell is light and wheaty with a hint of lemon. Taste is fairly light with hints of lemon citrus flavors and a wheaty backbone. Very light refreshing mouthfeel. Extremely drinkable, perfect beer for a hot summer day. This may become my go-to beer for BBQ's this year. Very refreshing."
"An unmistakable taste of the Midwest. Easy drinkin and laid back Its always too long for me between sessions of this lovable ole guy. Don't get me wrong nothing to knock your socks off here, but if your in for a night of drinking and you need a reliable buddy he's here for you with just the right amount of kick to bring you along."
"Overall this is a very sessionable beer. It is easy to drink, but there is really nothing to special about it."
"I watched as a friend of mine sipped his boulevard wheat out of a 24 oz glass. He was smiling, definitely enjoying his choice of brew. I asked for one. I couldn't help it. The misty golden color captivated me, but the moment I tasted it I realized that my expectations would go unmet. It was drinkable, but totally unremarkable. Its flavors were too light at the beginning, the middle and at the end. On my palate, its thinness left me wanting more, so I had a Chimay."
"While this beer is extremely drinkable given the light body and mild flavors, it doesn't set my world on fire. It comes through as slightly bland and watered down."
"Superior drinkablility. If I ever have to decide a beer that will be a gateway beer into the craft world for a friend or acquaintance, I'll hand them one of these."
"Overall: Man, in terms of drinkability this was VERY easy to drink. Flavor wasn't much but the aroma was very impressive. Great example of the style. This is definitely a great summer beer."
"D: Stellar. So refreshing. You could just suck these down like a bud light or something if you chose to."
"D: Light, smooth and refreshing with fair flavor. Knocked back a few of these."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is two inches in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of tangy wheat with a hint of banana. The taste is like the aroma, but without the banana. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a decent wheat beer. However, instead of showing me how good wheat beer can be it reminds me of how great other wheat beers are. I could drink this again, but there are so many better wheat beers out there that I can't see myself making it back to this one anytime soon."
"Overall: Thank you Vancer for this beer. You are a good man. I liked this beer, but I found it to be rather boring. I may be a caught up in the extreme beer trend, but this was just not aggressive enough. For what it was, it was pretty good though."
"Drinkabliblity is ok."
"Pours a cloudy yellow color. Pours a 1/3 inch head with decent retention. There's decent to good lacing. Smells of sweet malt and slight fruit. Fits the style. Tastes of sweet malt and a light fruit. Very crisp, low carbonation, wheat. Overall, not too bad a little too weak for my tastes, but easy to drink."
"Not much there to slow you down and just enough flavor to keep you going. Thin lawnmower beer. Serviceable as token craft brew in macro bar. Not running out to the beer store to find it."
"Overall it is a good wheat and very drinkable."
"The scent is of slight lemon...and wheat presence. There is a touch more flavor in the taste than there was in the smell - though not a whole lot more. This is definitely a mild and muted beer. The beer is extremely light bodied."
"That said, it's an easy-drinking bottle or pint. Crisp, clean, creamy grain taste with little else. Very inoffensive beer that would probably be good for introducing someone to a non light-lager style."
"D: Fairly benign beer, all things considered. Not pretty to look at, but pretty decent in the other categories. One of those 'meh' kind of experiences, I'm thinking, ""ok, what's next?"" and I'm only halfway through the glass. Easy enough to finish, but not one I'd need to have again. Of the 6 Boulevards I tried, this was the least impressive (still, thanks for the gift, Nick)."
"A bit more in the taste, but not much. Seems to be a bit muted and flavorless. Hint of wheat and lemon in the taste. Not very flavorable, but very crushable."
"D: It was smooth and refreshing and would make a good session beer.."
"D - Quite drinkable, no strong flavors to get in the way."
"D- An average american wheat, quite refreshing during missouri summers."
"A nice crisp feel to the taste. Poured at a chilled temperature I think this released the taste a bit better than last time. Citrus and sweet corn taste w/o the starch. Definitely better than last time. Refreshing beer, went down quite smooth. The crisp didn't turn into bitterness."
"Pours a very pale urine color,slightly hazed with a thin white head that lasts only for a few seconds and leaves no lacing. The nose is sweet,grainy and lemony,very fresh earthiness and inviting aromas. This American Wheat is quite the easy drinker. Crisp grassy notes and lemon rind zest seems on the right track for the style,but a bit to tame, Boulevard needs to turn up the flavor about three more notches. A thin body and average carbonation make this a great brew for drinkability. Smooth,crisp,clean and never offensive,this one aint about thinkin... it's about drinkin!"
"I have had better Unfiltered Wheats and probably would drink them instead."
"Nice hazy appearance and plenty of carbonation. Very clean but very slight fruity smell. This beer is much better on tap when the wheatiness is more present. This is quickly becoming the new ""light"" beer. Not the most interesting but works well at a tailgaiting party."
"D - This doesn't seem to be a very good representation of the style. It isn't horrible but when I think unfiltered wheat beer this isn't what I am going for."
"An inferior style yields an inferior product. These Pale American Wheat Ales don't showcase anything that is wonderful about Wheat beers, Pale Ales, Witbiers, or any other beer. Mediocre, timid, banal throughout. Now that that's off my chest... This beer has the look of normal Hefeweizens with a cloudy canary-yellow color, however the head formation and retention results in a little fizziness and weakening. Aromas are lemony and acidic with light notes of bread, wheat malt, and herbal hops. Flavors emphasize the lemon esters, grassy hops, and overall acidity while downplaying the comples yeast character and rich maltiness. Textures are thin, acidic, lightly astringent, and overall tart-- leaving maltiness and richness behind. Perhaps a bit grainy. Finishes lemony and fresh because of the acidity and citrus notes."
"Drinkability: this is a wheat beer for beginners, light and benign ""wheaty"" taste. Hints of citrus, banana, pleasant tasting. Bottom line, wish these flavors were more predominant in the beer."
"Not really my favorite style, but very easy to drink. This would be great to give to someone that likes BMC but wants to try to expand their horizons a bit."
"D: Drinkable enough, but other beers (and styles) have more to offer."
"D- Drinks real good and quenches the thirst"
"Drinkability- Great with a summer meal."
"Fresh bottle brought by the brewery to Cole's on the way to Cooperstown. Some wheat taste, yes. Yellow with a crowning white head, and some lace. Farmhouse aroma. High carbonation. Yet its all drinkable.Some citrus flavour yes. Not a bad one, but merely a warmup for their extremes."
"Not my favorite Boulevard offering, but it is worth a try if you have not had it before."
"I have heard from a few customers in my store that Boulevard is kinda like Shiner when i comes to how people think and drink it ... it is a very people friendly brew... low on the head but some is present.. some small honey and hop whiffs ... thin mouthfeel but i can see it being refreshing ... not worth what i have heard about it.. maybe on tap perhaps..."
"a very good wheat beer, imo, and very close to a borderline hefe and i love a good hefe beer. if your only exposure to wheat beers so far has been of the citrusy american variety, give Boulevard Brewing Co. Unfiltered Wheat a try and taste some of the roots to the whole wheat beer/hefe craze."
"Tastes like a decent wheat beer with a bit of lemony-citrus taste to it. The mouth feel was light and soft with a good amount of carbonation. This beer is fairly drinkable. It's not fantastic but definitely a notch above some other beers that I have had."
"Pours a hazy, fizzy golden yellow with a pillowy tight white head that falls to a thin layer of foam. Smell is a bit of wheat, lemon juice, corriander. Nothing overpowering. Taste isn't quite as full of flavor as I am accustomed to, however there is a nice mellow, wheat flavor that has a touch of sour to it, some sweet upfront honey, a bit of peppery spice. The finish is ho hum, not quite as carbonated as I wish it was. All in all, this is a fine session beer that I can appreciate. I wish it was a bit more complex but this is a no brainer on a hot texas day."
"a fair amount of yeast is in the bottem of the bottle that needs to be sweriled into the beer, i am happy that this one is unfiltered, it added complexity to this berw, this one is a bit sour the finishes sweet, the beer poured an almost cloudy lemon juice color. as far as wheats go this is just avrage but fairley drinkable. well worth a shot but don't go out of your way to get one."
""
"I poured this into a Lukas Liquor pint glass. The head was gone within minutes. It was a little hazy, but maybe a little less than the average wheat. What is most prominent about this brew is the yeasty flavor, no doubt from the bottle fermentation. Solid brew that had a strong hefe presence that makes it quite distinct from your average wheat."
"Active carbonation is correct but the mild slickness on the finish is not. Not the first time I've noticed this with a Boulevard beer. Still, it's an easy-drinking summer brew and if you like the style (I don't know why you would) then it's a no-brainer."
"Had on-tap at the brewery. Pours a cloudy, golden color with little head and minimal lacing. Has a slight citrus smell along with the prominent grain. Taste is primarily citrusy with a slight malt backbone. This stuff is dangerous in that it's like drinking water, and before you know it, you've had five or six. A great wheat beer."
"D : Easy one to drink. This would make a good session beer anytime of the year but especially well during the summer"
"Drinkability is eh good for a hot day to knock the dust out of your throat, again not bad for style just not my favorite style."
"Pale golden yellow color, with the haziness typical of wheat beers. Healthy head and lacing. Strong lemon aroma, and a light wheat flavor with some citrus. Taste is good, but not very strong. Very drinkable and pleasant, with good light mouthfeel, but not watery. Not at all bad, but not that special."
"Served in a glass from a 12oz. bottle. The beer poured a clear straw, ending in the glass with a hazy yellow appearance. 1/4 inch this white head that faded quickly, and no lacing. The aroma is very light, making it quite hard to detect anything. Very light notes of wheat and grain. Not too appealing. Taste is also extremely light, consisting of a very weak wheat flavor, and having more of a BMC lager type taste than a wheat ale. Mouthfeel is very light, and smooth. I could see this being a very drinkable summer beer, when cold is more important than flavor. I was dissapointed with this beer, as it didnt have some of the taste characteristics that I've come to expect from a wheat beer. I'm hoping this was just a bad batch. Will try again."
"I used to drink this with a lemon wedge since that how it was served in all the bars, but I like it better without the lemon. There's nothing really spectacular about this, but this is a solid, tasty beer and the perfect refreshment on a hot day."
"This beer pours a light, hazy yellow with a very mild head that leaves no lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is mildly clovey with a bit of citrus. The taste is pretty normal to a pale wheat beer. Their are definite notes of clove, lemon zest, and grain wheat. The mouthfeel is thin and slightly carbonated. Even though it might not be the best beer in the world, it still is good summer drinking beer."
"The Boulevard unfiltered wheat really puts there lunar ale to shame. this wheat brew is so much better than the Lunar. Very cloudy in appearance with an orange hue. it smells of citrus. Taste is just pleasant, a little citrus up front with a tasty mix in bannana and clove traits. a good drinkable beer that i will be sure to keep a look out for at the resturants."
"M/D - On the thin side but very easy drinking. Nothing to write home about, but not a bad American wheat beer."
"Very light, somewhat refreshing. Easy to drink, but nothing above average."
"D- Very easy to drink, usually consumed with a lemon. Its not bad without, but it adds more flavor. Its flavor is almost like a hefeweizen but a tad lighter."
"An easy drinker here, but not a whole lot of taste. Nothing to go out of your way to find, but certainly would hit the spot on a warm day."
"Pours a hazy yellow color, with a bright white head that settles VERY quickly. Aroma initially comes off very bready with lots of wheat and yeast aroma, with a faint citrus note coming up from the back. I'd liken it to a witbier, without the spices. Taste is fairly grassy with some faint fruity notes as well. Mouthfeel has a slight oily character to it, very smooth, not alot of carbonation. This is an okay beer. I'm not sure if i'd pick it up again, but i might like to try it fresher, or on tap some day."
"This is another one of those consumable products available year round but probably more suited to my taste for the warm summer days. You can sit back and enjoy several of these."
"Sampled on 3/25/08."
"A so so beer. Like all ""American Pale Wheat Ale's"" this does not have the the depth of a good Pale Ale or the explosion of flavor that a good hefe has. Something that I probably won't try again."
"Hazy yellowish orange pour in a nice tall Weizen glass. Short lived head and a smell of mainly hearty wheat, and a citrusy lemon lightness about it. Flavor was similar, and not spiced like a hefeweisen usually is, very smooth, and easy drinking. Possibly my new favorite american wheat beer. Light, refreshing, simply but with flavor, and very nice I thought."

"D - Decent brew that would definately suggest over blue moon anyday, but can't beat a good hefe"
"From a sampler pack, this bottle pours a hazy lemonade yellow body with a small vanilla head. Aroma has some lemony pepper notes, not much else. Light to light medium body with a bit too much carbonation. Taste has some lemony citrus and yeast. That's about it. Not much to this one. I suppose it would be a good thirst quencher but disappointing as a beer."
"Drinkability: It's one of those six packs that takes a long time for me finish off. Because it's quite bland, the drinkability isn't high for me."
"Verdict? - Needs more. of what? - everything. A decent beverage in a pinch, and sadly I'm in that pinch all too often around this town."
"Its smooth texture and sweeter taste make this easy on the palate, and I'd be interested in trying this again as the warm weather comes rolling around. It would seem to be a very refreshing beer on a hot day, and it was a nice accompaniment to my plate of Chinese food. That said, for now I can only characterize this beer as decent, and a little short on the complexity that the beer's label touts."
"Poured a nice deep hazy golden color with decent white head that stayed for a while. Aroma was citrusy and refreshing. Taste was again a refreshing citrusy flavor. Mouthfeel was good and drinkability was way up there. Not the most complex beer in the world, but a nice quencher."
"Didn't have a glass, so I drank straight from the bottle. Had a rather nice easy flavour to it. A nice mixture of hops and malt up front which faded abruptly to an extremely clean finish. Very light, but much better than other mass-produced light beers. If I lived in KC it'd probably be one I'd normally grab."
"Poured this beer into a pint glass. This beer poured a hazy yellow color. The overall smell and taste of this beer was wheat, with a touch of citrusy hops. The mouthfeel was light. But this beer really didn't stand out as opposed to other wheat beers. All in all I would probably drink this agian, but wouldn't reach for it automaticly."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date into a pint glass. It was a hazy pale straw color. It barely had a head and it went away quickly leaving a tiny collar. Good carb though. The aroma was extremely weak and what was there had a weird smell that I couldn't identify. The taste followed the smell - very weak with a weird taste. Just not a good beer once you've tried good craft beers. I could see someone who is trying to move beyond macros liking it but I'm way past that point. One is enough. (2.5, NA, Tie, N)"
"Poured into a mug, this beer is extremely pale and rather cloudy. The head retention is terrible, with it fading away to a thin film after a moment. Nose is a little grainy, though all aspects of the aroma are faint... there's a little citrus note as well. Taste is bland. The only difference between this and a macro lager is a slight wheatiness. Grainy, maybe a very little fruity, and completely uninteresting."
"Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat pours a hazy, translucent yellow. It gives off a yeasty aroma that is moderatly strong. The mouthfeel is smooth, but overall the taste is lacking a big bold flavor. This beer is certainly drinkable, but I would seek out others before coming back to this one."
"D: Way too easy to drink for a wheat beer of the taste. Boulevard has managed to make a wheat beer that is crisp, and that is awesome."
"d: Boulevard's best selling beer is the definition of a session brew. This light wheat is an excellent crossover for people who know only macro brews which explains why its the best selling (non-macro) beer in the midwest (or so I've read). Growing up in Kansas City, Bully Wheat was my first venture away from the Anheuser-Busch/MolsonCoors/SABMiller dynasties, so it will always hold a special place in my heart. It's the flagship beer from my hometown brewery and I am willing to bet I've consumed more of this beer than any other. It goes down very easy and is perfect for summer refreshment."
"To me this isn't anything special but I know a lot of people that love this beer. In my opinion if just doesn't have any qualities that make it stand out above the rest. It tastes better when served w/ a lemon wedge in it."
" Pours a hazy light yellow with little to no head retention. Smells faintly of grapefruit and yeast. Not terribly complex. I enjoy the citrus flavor when in first hits but the flavor is washed out. This beer really shines in drinkability. Great beer for BBQ's and other summer outings."
"Pours a rich cloudy yellow. A big, white head when I pour, dissipates quickly. Smells of faint grain. Taste is quite light, wheat and perhaps a slight flavour of the yeast? Very little bittering, you can barely taste the hops. Mouthfeel is excellent, smooth with nice carbonation. Not my normal style of beer as its pretty plain, but most places around here that serve mostly BMC products also serve this, making it my 'savior' beer. A better tasting alternative to the macro lagers IMO. An extremely easy to drink, sessionable ale. Also bottle conditioned, which is a big plus in my book."
"This is far and away one of my favorite beers. It's amazingly refreshing (especially after 18 holes of golf on a hot day). It's crisp but not overpowering, slightly fizzy - just enough to give it a kick. But most of all, it's just an easy beer to drink."
"Either way, if you're really looking for a wheat beer or you're at a sports bar with macros otherwise, it's not hard to drink a few and pairs nicely with pub food."
"So in sum, not a lot of flavor, but it's still not the awful ""budweizer-esque"" beer some have described it as. It's quality beer, with a nice yeast sediment in the bottle that adds force to the flavor. My complain is that that flavor is one-dimensional."
"overall, this is a very watery beer, not much aroma, taste or body, but it was rather refreshing"
"D- I can drink about a dozen of these before I know what even hit me. They are not filling - a nice summer attribute."
"had this on-tap, it seems boulevard products are almost as available in kc as bmc...and not much else to choose from at the various places i went to over the weekend. ordered without the lemon garnish. typical wheat beer in appearance but nothing special, this was a cloudy straw/light orange with a white head. not too much going on in the bouqet other than some sweet doughy notes. taste was fine but again, unremarkable. appropriate level of sweetness for the style with a crisp and slightly chewy mouthfeel. drinkable, especially at this abv."
"The mouthfeel is ok, I don't mind the texture. I actually like this category of beer, so I expect more. Here in the Midwest it's an old stand-by for some people when a dive bar has nothing better. But in that situation I'll just go with a Budweiser, because I won't pay extra for something with the same amount of flavor."
"Overall impression: Eh, this one is fine - highly drinkable, but nothing too exciting."
"Probably a good beer for the heat of summer but inside I found it lacking any real personality."
"Paired this with a dinner salad, citrus chicken and balasmic dressing. Complimentary. Maybe on a hot day on draft or at a restaurant on tap."
"D- This beer is light and boring with not much interesting going on. It does have qualities that would appeal to a BMC drinker and nothing about this beer would be considered offense."
"Poured slightly less than a pint out of the bottle. Carbonation bubbles run up the glass, and the highly carbonated head quickly fizzed away to leave very little lace. Pale yellow/orange, hazy color. Smelled yeasty, with orange hints. The taste was wheaty, also with orange flavors, as if there was a slice of orange right there in the bottle. The wheat taste was mild, mostly sweet, but with a very slight bitter tinge. Good taste overall: zesty, refreshing, leaves a sugared, wet palate. A little more carbonated than your average beer, but it definately works with the sweet taste. Very drinkable, I could easily put a few of these back on a warm day."
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice small white head, which leaves some sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is of slight malts/hops, yeast, grassy, spices. The taste is yeasty, malty, hoppy, nice blend of spices. Light-Medium body. Drinkable, a nice summer brew for sure, true to style."
"Drinkability: Excellent. If you like a less flavorful beer. I used to idolize this beer. Now that I have trained my palate I am less impressed. But I have to admit. I cant get it in Colorado so when ever Im in Nebraska Im going to pick up at least a six-pack. Just because its not a real flavor bomb doesnt mean its not good beer. Nice work Boulevard Brewing!"
"Drinkability is above average. I thought it was refreshing and could drink a lot without noticing. Flavor seems a bit lacking to make this a real drinker. I didn't find it very exciting at all. Maybe a good gateway beer for some."
"D - Taste is definitely lacking and there's way too much carbonation in this beer....on the bright side I did only pay 5 dollars for the 12 pack (Last Chance Liquors) and it is better than macro swill."
"Drinkability/notes: A reasonably pleasant example, fairly well-made, not exceptional, but not bad, either."
"Thanks to Pegasus for sharing."
"Taste is of wheat, yeast and a little citrus, again nothing to strong. Mouthfeel is fine. Overall a decently drinkable wheat beer that I will drink on occassion. This was a crossover beer for me so it definitely has a place in my fridge."
"D - I could drinka few of these in the summer months, but it's nothing to get excited about."
"Not a bad wheat beer, but definitely not a great one either. Poured a very light hazy peachish orange color, with considerable less cloudiness than other unfiltered wheat beers. Somewhat bland taste with a very weak, very quickly diminishing head, and very dismal lacing down the side of the std. pint glass. The taste and smell left a lot to be desired, all I got from the bear was the remninse of the lemon on the side of the glass(which I removed), some yeast, and dull wheat. This beer was served at a BBQ restaurant and was served far too cold for good consumption, so I will leave that as a caveat to my initial dislike of the brew (although it would not improve the taste enough to make it rate much higher). Although I am slightly harsh on this beer it is a light refreshing drinkable option, and if I am in Kansas City again enjoying some BBQ, I will probably have another one..."
"Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat doesn't look great. The smell is fairly average -- just wheat and yeast. But there is something about the taste. I just love it. It is my ""always on hand"" beer. It just fits any occasion or even if there's no occasion. Most people think it is pretty weak, but I'll always appreciate an Unfiltered Wheat from Boulevard."
"This is a pretty good beer for the most part. However, I think it would actually be a better seasonal summer beer than a year round beer, as it's a little too thing for a year round session brew. Its drinkability is quite high, as it goes down very easy. Overall, not a bad beer, and I can honestly say this would be a great session beer for a hot and humid Missouri summer day."
"The mouth is pleasantly medium. Just not interesting enough to be a session beer."
"Thanks, beerhandy, for the opportunity and Vancer and BuckeyeNation, for the chance to re-visit"
"Due to the bitterness, I would choose another wheat beer over this, but not a bad choice for the price."
"Slightly above average. It's a refreshing beer, probably the most enjoyable in the summer."
"This arrived with a light, bone-white head above a cloudy, lemon-yellow beer. The nose had the sharp scent associated with wheat beer. The mouthfeel was effervescent with a lightly spicy dryness on the palate. The finish had a light, but not unpleasant, sourness, followed by a refreshing dryness. This was a really good summer beer."
"Overall a decent American Wheat, easy to drink, but not the best choice if you are looking for more flavor... Thanks to Vancer for the bottle..."
"peace...bc"
"D - If there was nothing else available or I just really wanted to down a bunch of beer and get drunk then this would be a winner, but honestly, there is nothing special here. It's sad that this was the first microbrew I could find in KS, and is the only one I've found widely available."
"Poured into a glass with a half finger head that quickly dissipates to a little lacing with alot of carbonation. Has a cloudy golden color and a lemony scent with wheaty undertones. The taste is very crisp with a definite underlying lemon flavor. Could drink quite a few of these while grilling outdoors."
"Into a pint glass, pours a cloudy golden yellow, nice head at first and good carbonation, not much lacing. Aroma is ... there? Maybe? Not much, a little citrus, maybe some wheat/straw-like malt. Not bad, but not really there. Taste is ... refreshing I guess. Easily wheaty, a nice citrus, a bit too dry for me, really in the finish and ends too quickly. Nice, but forgettable."
"A light haze hits the iris in standard wheat form. Good bubbling and a thick foam that slowly recedes over time. Plenty of cloves with some gristy nortes. But also a very lagery aroma that I didn't care for too much. Plenty of crystal malts that integrated well with the wheat gristy flavors. Very clean palate that helps to explain the lager like qualities of this beer."
"I suppose I'm not the best reviewer of the American Wheat style. My personal preference for wheat beers trend more towards their German and Belgian cousins. I have found very few American Wheats that stand out. This beer isn't any different. I find it pretty average."
"Boulevard Wheat is an important beer for me. This is the beer that realy got me interested in craft beer. It's a gateway beer. Since then I have found many beers much better, but you still can't go wrong with this. Plus, you can't go anywhere in KC with out it being available."
"Note: Not bad but certainly nothing above average. Don't go out of your way looking for this, if you want a good wheat for hot weather get a 12 of Sam Adams Summer ale."
"If you do like this beer, you would probably love the much-stronger flavored Belgian beer Alexander Rodenbach. Although you may wish to read my review on that one, and its resulting consequences. I'm feeling a little that way, at present, after this beer."
"Boulevard wheat was pale yellow and very hazy. It had a white head with decent retention and lacing. It has a light yeasty aroma with a little lemon. The taste was lemon and wheat. It had a dry finish. The body was light with medium-high carbonation. Drinkability was good. This is a decent, easy drinking wheat ale."
"Had this one while on business in Iowa recently. Pours a cloudy straw yellow color with a decent white, rocky head Nose is ... barely there. Faint malt and wheat. Not much else. Palate is the same, sadly. Thin, watered-down, and boring. Like the ""light beer"" of wheat beers. Mild wheat and a dry finish. Mouthfeel is very light, thin, and drab. Yikes ... what happened here? I really expected something better, or even good. A real disappointment."
"Boulevard makes several well made beers most wont really nock your socks off, but they make beer that is worth its price and taste good. I think this might just be my favorite from them besides the Bully Porter. This beer has a very white strong head that fades somewhat quickly. I really love the smell of a good Wheat Ale and this beer is no exception. The scent is more lemony than wheaty but you can smell both fairly easy. The taste has hints of lemon and wheat with a bit of a yeast kick too it. The mouthfeel was a bit unimpressive too light in my opinion. Besides that it is pretty good. Like all good Pale Wheat Ales this beer is very drinkable and is great in hot weather. Not the best Wheat Ale but a good one."
"A cloudy yellow gold with a nice white head that fades quickly. The nose is mild yeast and a bit of orange. Taste is very subdued wheat and yeast, with the tiniest bit of malt, but a slighty ethanol aftertaste. I would describe it as just a step-up from miller light, taste wise. It's not at all unpleasant though, and a very good ""introductory"" beer. Mouthfeel is light but with some nice carbonation. Quite the drinkable brew if you don't get bored of it."
"from a single bottle at beer club...might as well review it since ive had it so many times. i always drink this when i travel a little farther south where it's carried. light orange and cloudy. nice full wheat taste with a little ethanol on the side. nothing special, but tasty, refreshing and very drinkable. i'd buy sixers of this if it was distributed here."
"The beer pours a cloudy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light, pale malt and wheat scent with a slight lemony edge and earthy aromas. The taste is decent also. It's very light, yet refreshing with a mellow lemon feel and a slight earthy finish. It's watery and lacking character, but it goes down smooth. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good wheat beer, but nothing too special. It's light and easy drinking."
"Color is a hazy golden grain. Head is thick, but below average in height. Retention is pretty good. Aroma is of sweet grains with a touch of citrus. The taste has a nice combination of sweat grains backed by wheat flavors. Citrus flavors are light, as is the yeastiness. Drinkability is pretty good. This is a solid American wheat, but nothing here makes this beer stand out from many similar brews."
"Straw-golden color, barely not see through. Head dies quickly to a small ring. Aroma is hard to detect, but is wheaty and zesty. The taste is not too complex, lemon and other citrus zest with a bit of a grain/wheat flavor in aftertaste. Kind of like fresh lemon grass. The malt is quite sweet as well, and there is a little bit of spicy hops in the finish. I was suprised at the mouthfeel, I don't know if I just really wanted a beer or what, but I thought the mouthfeel was very sparkling and tangy on the tongue. Very drinkable summer beer."
"Overall this brew goes down very smooth, highly drinkable on a hot patio during the summer months."
"Drinks pretty easy, good summer time sessioner. Better on tap IMO"
" Overall, it was quite drinkable. I enjoyed every single one the barmaid brought to my table. It was a little different from the ""norm"" but still enjoyable."
"Pretty disappointing beer for me. As someone else said it, ""uninteresting"" is the perfect word to describe this beer. Is it a decent alternative to BMC, yes. Would I buy this again when there is any other decent micro on the shelf, no."
"Pours a slightly hazy yellow with low level head. Scents of bread and thats about it on the nose. Flavor is yeasty, maybe with some slight citrus flavors. This was a pretty dull, uninteresting beer without much going on. Thanks to jhammerly for the bottle."
"Mouthfeel is light and lively but theres a fizziness issue here that hurts both mouthfeel and drinkability."
"The carbonation is a little high and the body a little low but expectable. Overall an easy drinking session beer for both bullies and whimps alike."
"If you're looking for a ""Lite Hefeweizen," this just might be your brew."
"Drinkability - decent try at a wheat."
"Deasy drinking, a decent summer time brew, which is what I was hoping for. Light without any overpowering dominate flavors. This may find its way into the rotation this summer..."
"Poured pale yellow and cloudy and without much of a head. Slight yeast aroma . Zesty flavor. Sweet malt and understated hops. Lacking in body and flavor. This stuff tastes like it has been watered down. Interesting musty yeast flavor, but this beer doesn't make the grade."
"Boulevard wheat served draft is one of the finest beers around. In a bottle it's still satisfying, but it needs to be tried draft to appreciate the flavor. It is the perfect drink to accompany a plate of Kansas City barbeque. Unfortunately, they don't ship it beyond the midwest."
"In summary, it's OK. about what you'd expect for an American Wheat. There are other wheat beers to get more excited about."
"Drinkability  As far as the style goes, this was one of the better offerings that Ive tried."
"This is one of my favorites for a night out when macros are the only other option, readily available, cheep, and easy to drink, this one works nicely when out with friends or at a barbecue. Pours watery head is small at 1 1/2 fingers, very yellow to gold in color hazy as one would expect from the unfiltered wheat. Smell is sweet and appealing very heavy on lemon and wheat. This one is smooth and refreshing, very carbonated which adds a faux bite that isn't there from the beer itself. If I could change one thing it would be the watery nature of this beer. It is unimpressive on the tongue. Overall very drinkable."
"Poured into a tall weizen glass, theres a big wheaty head that dissipates rapidly, with little lacing. Light, cloudy body. Smell is a refreshing, light n zesty wheat, with just a tiny hint of lemony zest. Taste goes down easy, soft and a little spicy. No ""extreme"" taste but very nice. Couple weeks ago I ran into Boulevards brewmasters wife at Rock Bottom Chicago. She was looking for more good beer places, so I helped her locate more, while admitting that I hadnt tried any Boulevard beers yet. Then on a trip through Iowa, I found them placed in Hy-Vee stores and haapily picked up a six of this to try."
"Should be a good hot weather drink."
"Hazy yellow color. I swirled around the yeast at the bottom and got the majority of it into the glass since it is bottle conditioned. Faint lemon straw aroma. The taste wasn't bad, it just was kind of bland. No complexity, nothing that stands out, very boring. Body was light and it was easy on the palate. Would I have another one of these? Probably not. One bright point of this beer was when I took a bite out of my friend's peach and then took a sip of the beer. It really enhanced then flavor of the beer and made it much more enjoyable."
"Best on tap. It losses something when it is in the bottle. I would also stay away from the lemon they try to put on the side. It is only in a few mid west states, mostly Kansas and Missouri. If you find your self there most restaurants have it on tap."
"12 oz bottle. Best by 09/10/05. Hazy straw. Tons of tiny bubbles rise to a nice layer of foam. Mostly grain in the nose. It tastes fine, I guess. Really nothing to get excited about. Has a wheaty/lemony thing going on. I do prefer this beer with a lemon wedge. Soft across the tonge. Subtle bitterness. Best beer to get at Royals games."
"This is a really decent entry level beer. It is crisp and refreshing and mild enough that macro drinkers would readily accept it. I lived in KC for nine years and learned to really enjoy the local brews from Boulevard. The tour was fun and I have a few glasses left. Lots of good memories of KC. Aroma is muted lemon and some floral hops. Short-lived white head, cloudy yellow color. I swirled the last couple of inches to dislodge the sediment as part of pour. Can be poured clear. I liked it better with the yeast. Taste is somewhat lemony, finish with a mild hop finish. Some wheat malt discernable but very muted in profile as I mentioned above. I miss this beer but have found so many new ones here in NJ that its more out of nostalgia than anything else."
"I had this on tap while down in Southern Illinois. Review from notes. I liked the hazy orange color and there was a nice looking head to boot. This was served way, way too cold. Must have patience. As it warms the flavors come out a bit but not too much. Seems like there's a good amount of spices in here. I notice coriander and orange peel, even some lemon zest. Really citric. Wheaty flavors are there too. Fairly light all around. Yeasty finish is noticeable. This one is decent and a better choice than Blue Moon, but after drinking pint after pint of Oberon this one pales in comparison."
"Drinkability: I may be somewhat biased since this is my local craft brew available in bottles. Very drinkable on a hot summer day."
"."
"Calories: 135 per 12 ounces."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a small head that falls quickly and doesn't leave much on the glass. The aroma is lacking for a wheat - slight citrus, that's all. The flavor is slightly bitter and has some citrus in it as well as a slight banana. This one seems to be stuck in beer limbo between a hefeweizen and an American Wheat. It's pretty decent, but nothing exceptional."
"Updated 1/4/06 After a few fresh batches, these are coming around. Can taste the citrus and malts in the new brews - much better!"
"The taste was a little stringent, thinking the bar I got it at might need to clean its lines, but after ignoring that it does have a nice wheat, malt, and hop taste, with hints of citrus. The mouthfeel was good with real depth. The drinkability was ok, but really suffered because of the stringent taste."
"Best by 4-21-05 Thought I lost my sense of smell. Rust on my hands from getting the Old 1953 John Deere ready for next season of mowing - overwhelms all but a faint yeast aroma. Its 60°F and the sun is nearly down. I take the brats off the fire and quaf the pale unmalted soft red winter wheat and light citrus flavors. Boulevard's light-mediumlight body and wait for Magnum and Simcoe hops. Hops that only appear on the lable. The CO2 sends up a fine curtain of beads in the refreashing pale haze lemon colored beer."
"Alright. This beer pours a pale yellow color with a small ring of head over top of the beer. The nose is very wheaty with a slight lemony tinge. The flavor is very slightly honey-sweet and wheaty. I just don't like the wheat beers without that nice hefe yeast. The feel is light and rather bubbly. Oh, what to say about this in summation...for an American wheat, this is not all that bad. If you're into this kind of thing, try it."
"The taste reminds me of why I decided this was such an obvious step up from macros (afterall, when I first made that step, appearance nor smell meant very little to me). The taste is quite a refreshing wheat beer. The sweetness of the malted wheat and the citrusy backing go well together. This is definately something that I could (and have done so in the past) drink in massive amounts in the summer time. I look forward to doing so again this summer, as well as trying the seasonal Zon, which I missed last summer. Until the weather reaches 80 degrees though, I think I will stick with something a little more stronger and bitter."
"Drinkability is pretty low on this unimpressive beer. So much better out their, just a notch better than typical Macro garbage."
"Tried this out at a Dog-themed restaurant in St. Charles, MO. Thought Boulevard was brewed locally but came to find out it's from Kansas City. The unfiltered appearance doesn't bother me as much as the lack of carbonation. With no place to throw the lemon I dropped it in the pint glass. Tasted very weak, almost like a flavored water. No sensations on the tongue or noticable scent. Would be quite easy to down a few on a hot summer day, but more to quench my thirst. Would pick another choice next time."
"On tap. Cloudy light golden. Very weak color. No head, or lacing. Slight lemony smell, a hint of earth spicyness, not much else. Watery. Slight banana flavor, a little hint of clove or spice. No bitterness, actually, not a whole lot of flavor. Very light body, thin and watery. Needs more carbonation. Needs ore flavor. Very plain. Maybe a good transition for someone to better beer, but only a baby step."
"Thin body, goes down okay."
"Clearish, cloudy orange color brew with a normal looking haze of a head. Smell is sweet honey and flour, wheaty. Subtle. Taste, too, is smooth and sweetish honey, with faint lemon notes and a mild dryness in the aftertaste. Medium body. Pretty standard beer for the style."
"Drinkability: average as the flavors are weak and the beer just doesn't excite you to have another."
"Drinkability: Well, at an average of $3 a pint ($2 during happy hour) one can't complain too much. It was certainly the best thing available at the places I went to. A good beer to have when it's sweltering outside. Quite the session beer."
"A good summer ale but not fantastic. Refreshing but slightly heavy in the finish. I could have another but if others (not the macros which is what was available) are available I'll grab one of those."
"Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat is drinkable in a pinch. However, I can't really find it in me to recommend it, even for those fans of American Pale Wheat Ales. You do exist, don't you?"
"The beer was a nice cloudy golden brew with a nice white head. It had a malty smell with hints of fruit behind it. The taste was a very fresh malty wheat with some hints of citrus and banana in the back, it has very little or no hoppieness to it. The feel was creamy and oily. This is a good wheat beer, and it was enhanced by being a good fresh keg. A beer I will have to try again when I am where it is available."
"Thanks Huge."
"Overall, a solid wheat beer."
"This beer should be tried on tap rather than from the bottle to truly appreciate it. I had the opportunity to actually go to the brewery (it's in my hometown), and sampled this beer there. I had tried it from the bottle and came away underwhelmed. The tap beer is light and drinkable, with little head, but a nice aroma. Taste is very light, but satisfying. The appearance is a hazy light yellow with a definite wheaty aroma. I like this beer on a hot summer day, it compliments light foods well too. Too bad it's only available on tap in a limited area."
"An acceptable wheat ale, but not particularly noteworthy. No German hefe attributes to speak of - I didn't detect any spicy yeast flavors. Seemed to hit the scale somewhere between an un-spiced Belgian white ale, like Hoeegarden, and your basic bland American wheat. I note this because the beer was a bit beefier in body - the yeast did lend some nice bready notes, but it was rather bland."
"I used to really love this stuff, but I think the more flavorful pale ales and richer tasting German hefe's I've been drinking lately have spoiled it for me somewhat! Still, a couple of these after working outside in the summer or at a baseball game would be nice. (Support your local brewery and all, you know!)"
"I just like all of their other beers better."
"A slight disappointment as I like some of the other Boulevard treats like the Bully porter; hard to believe this was from the same place. Some are hit and miss I guess, this was a miss."
"Overall: I first had the pleasure of meeting this beer at the Boulevard Brewery Bar at Kansas City Airport whilst waiting for a flight to LAX. Its just as refreshing from the bottle as it is from draft. Not the boldest of Wheat Beers, its a delicate offering that still offers some flavor whilst quenching your thirst. Drinks Well. Thanks to BigHuge for the reaquaintance."
"Pours a slightly cloudy yellow with a tinge of orange. Yeasty and fruity aroma with a hint of spice. Taste is a little bland for my hefe tastes but is passable. Not enough fruit and spice for me. Fairly carbonated. A good session beer with friends."
"Final Thoughts: Since this beer is brewed in KC (about a 2 1/2 hour drive from Lincoln) it is adopted here as local. I have to admit I have not been let down by one of their products yet. Always fresh and readily available at a low price. Could have picked to review on tap or bottle but chose the bottle because it is often served on tap a little too cold (for my taste) and with a slice of lemon, which I always try to remember to request be left out. Just don't like lemon (or lime) in my beer."
"Poured a hazy straw color with absolutely NO head. I don't know if this was a bad bottle, but it was well within it's freshness period. I wil re-review if the other ones are different. Smells very full of grain and malt. A hearty flavored beer, not very sweet. A big amount of carbonation, makes this beer very refreshing."
"Served in a cold pint glass, after letting it sit to warm a bit, cloudy hazy yellow-orange color, small white head that doesn't last. Light wheat aroma, bland wheat flavor, watery and thin mouthfeel, finishes with a mild sourness, not much of anything going on here, very bland."
"The beer is a bit of a cloudy, straw in color. There was also a bit of a white head to it. The aroma is a bit light, but contains both wheat and some citrus. The taste is also a bit on the light side, but has fairly good wheat and lemon notes. There are better wheats, but this is a good summer brew. The draught version seems a bit better than the bottled version."
"If you're lookin' for a light summer brew on a hot day, grab a nice boxed up six pack of Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat. Cheap, easy to find in this neck of the woods, and very refreshing. Yummy."
"8-5-02-Cloudy bright yellow in color....soft malt nose...taste is pretty bland...there are some citrus notes but it is pretty tasteless overall....a very soft what malt flavor along with the citrus but you have to strain...not a bad beer....just not packed with flavor..."
"Slightly hazy greenish yellow color, 3/4 inch very white head with excellent staying power. Spotty laces. Bland aroma, slight sense of yeast. Flavor is pretty refugee in character, little ester, low spiciness. Mostly a sense of lemon astrigency combined with a watery texture. Relatively clean finish. There's very little going on with this brew, not a good Hefe at all in my book. So bland that its easy to throw 'em back, though."
"Served a bit too cold, but it had a hazy, cloudy yellow color with an off white head. The aroma was lemony-citrus, wheat, and yeast. The flavor was clean and citrusy, with a grainy wheat flavor. It was a very drinkable, smooth beer. Great for a hot day."
"Pale yellow hue, ghostly and, frankly, unappealing to the eye, hazy from the yeast I agitated and poured into my glass. The white head reached a finger on a hard pour. The retention is reasonable, a soapy collar forms and no lace gets produced during consumption. The nose does little for me; its wheaty with a little mustiness and splashes of citrus throughout. The potency is very mild and the invitation is subtle. Even though my eyes and nose tells me this is not appealing my mouth tells me otherwise. The palate is a quintessential American Wheat, as insipid as that is. The wheat taste leads with light citrus hints mixed with musty-yeastiness. This is far from a palate stimulator but it is refreshing and easy to drink. It is a cheap alternative that I take advantage of. It is not as crisp as some versions (Anchor Summer Wheat) but more well rounded than others (In-Heat Wheat). Medium-light in body, which is appropriate, low carbonation, natural on the tongue. This is easily Boulevards most popular beer, so many not craft brew drinkers like this and that is great. There is no need for you to seek it out."
"Okay, wrong review. While not expectional I certainly found this to be a pleasant enough beer. Served with no head. Hard to know if it ever had one. Cloudy and hazy and yellow. Looks alright. Not much aroma. Flavor is a bit on the watery side, but nice balance of malt and wheat. Lighter and a refreshing quality in an ale manner. Slight pleasant sourness left an good lingering. Fairly fluffly with a little creaminess. Would make a worthwhile summer session beer."
"This beer poured a very cloudy yellow with very skimpy head. What head existed did not last past the second swallow. The beer had not character in either the aroma or the taste. After a good apperance, I was very disappointed in the other aspects of this beer. I would not recommend this beer for anything other than a session beer."
"slightly hazy golden colour.....slight head and traces of lace. virtually no aromas usually associated with good wheat beers. some spritzy lemony smells and a bit of malt. tastes of the slightest bit of wheat malt....with some hints of fruitiness. this wheat is very non-descript in any of it's characteristics. light mouthfeel....bits of creaminess....easy drinking. a good summer slammer...and quick thirst quencher. highly drinkable, but if you're looking for a killer wheat...look elsewhere. thanks to my bro for bringing this one up from missouri over easter."
"A solid summertime brew. With its light, crisp flavor and smooth drinkability, this one is a hit with me. Don't confuse this beer with other complex brews, though. It is sort of the ""Budweiser"" of wheat beers. Much better when you can find it on tap, but then again aren't most beers like that."
"Overall Ok wheat beer...Even the Choc beer was a better wheat beer"
"Pours out pretty cloudy, its a pale gold color. Not much of a head on this one. It tastes pretty good, theres a little more yeast in this beer than the sierra nevada wheat i had last night. i wish it was about 20 degrees hotter today and we could sit outside while drinking these. Probably a good summer drink."
"While I love most Boulevard beers, I have never been a big fan of this one. It is better than the filtered wheat that they used to bottle, but not enough to make me buy it on a regular basis. It would be interesting to try this beer again, but to decant it carefully and leave the sediment in the bottle."

"This bottle was a sample from a salesrep at a local distributor. I've got Schneider Weisse on tap at my bar now, and Bell's Oberon will be out soon. I'll have to pass on Boulevard, thanks."
"It has low alcohol, and not very many calories. It's available at most restaurants locally, and there's sure 'nuff a reason. Tell that shrimp to toss another pig on the 'barbie' and bring me another wheat beer on the way back."
"The beer was golden in color and rather cloudy. (The bartender served it with a lemon wedge in the glass.) The aroma was mild and ""fizzy"". The taste was a bit thin, but OK. The dominant flavor was wheat. This wheat beer was light on the fruity esters. The mouthfeel was good and refreshing. The drinkability was good. This would be a good summer wheat beer."
"Pours a really nice cloudy amber/orangish color. Head is fluffy white and hangs out for a while in a thin mask over the top. I taste some citrus initially with a nice malty taste. Overall I think this is a very good beer, my favorite part of it is probably the apperance it is a great looking brew! Nice to sit back and relax with one of these."
"This impressive brew comes out with a light cloudy bright yellow color with thick foamy white head giving off a HUGE tangy ester yeast aroma.  The body is quite light, but I am happy to say the flavor is quite heavy with a prominent tangy yeast and malt character.  Very clean finish rounds off a very tasty beer."
"For the individual who finds barley malt and bitter hops somewhat harsh, Boulevard unfiltered Wheat Beer might be the answer to the question of what to drink."
"This hazy golden brew throws out a medium white head that wilts down a thickish film that stays around for awhile.  Not a lot going on with the aroma.  Maybe some wheat malt.  And slight hop tang.  There's a slight tanginess and a little tartness perceived.  Slight spicy hop notes.  Nothing real great going on here.  Easy drinking brew though."
"I had this beer on tap while traveling in Missouri.  The beer has a pale appearance, and is barely cloudy.  I expected esters and yeast, but was disappointedIts somewhat bland.  Worth a try when nothing else is available, but dont go out of your way for this one."
"Hazy yellow from the wheat protein w/ a moderately thick creamy head.  Not as impressive as a German (real) wheat beer in appearance.  Very little overall in aroma-- a very slight wheaty tartness and graininess is perceptible.  Hop nose is negligable.  Slighly tart in taste from the wheat, w/ a decent body.  Hop bitterness is only slightly higher than that of megaswill. Since this an American wheat, there are no contributions in flavor from the yeast.  For the insipid American wheat style this is right on. As a beer in itself it is quite bland, and actually needs a lemon. Hand me a Paulaner now so I know my taste buds are still functioning."
