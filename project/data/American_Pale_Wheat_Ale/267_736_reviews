"Odell might be the most consistent brewery in CO."

"The smell is wonderful but otherwise average. Take my review with a grain of salt due to my inexperience. Please excuse my brevity."
"This beer is just average for me. I've had better in the style and I've had worse. Still a decent brew."
""
"My favorite wheat beer BY FAR. It is the perfect drink for the summer time with a nice orange."
""
"As a fan of wheat beers, this one doesn't disappoint."
"Wheat beer does some weird shit to my palate, but this one doesn't gross me out. Therefore, it is the best wheat beer ever."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy, dark, orange-brown coloring, with a filmy, bubbly, white head. Nose of toasted grains, subtle citrus notes of tangerine, and hints of caramel. Flavors are citrus and candy sweet forward, with a toasted grain backbone. Highlights of tangerine throughout. Light, effervesced body, with a citrusy and grainy aftertaste. Smooth, light, crisp finish."

"I'm just not a wheat beer guy, but this one was pretty good.  Odell can pretty much do no wrong as far as I'm concerned, and they make this a good representation of the style.  This is one of their most popular beers and I can see why."

"Overall (3.83) : If someone shows up to your house with a six pack of Easy Street, you know you have a buddy for life. This person/persons knows beer, and you should be grateful for that. This is a good wheat beer - impressive even, and when a beer makes you say ""mmmm", you know it's grand. Of course I'll never deny myself a wheat beer unless it's truly horrible - it's hard for me to knock any beer of that style. I'd say Easy Street comes up above average in wheat beers overall."

"Pours a cloudy gold in color with a good 1-finger white head that settles down to just a small amount around the sides of the glass. Spotty lacing is seen with even a ring or two actually at first. The aroma is of wheat and grains. The taste is about the same with a good amount of wheat coming through. This is a good wheat that gets better with each sip even. Clean and crisp. No bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. Perfect carbonation. A tasty wheat beer overall"

"Overall: My favorite wheat brew to date. Easy going, Easy Street (to be specific.)"
""
""
""
"I took a chance and had a bottle of Easy Street with dinner tonight at Circle 7 in Ballwin, Missouri. Poured a pale golden with standard head and lacing. A very drinkable beer; however I was struck by the complete lack of body. The start and finish is clean and light, but nothing in between. I can see this as a session beer in hot weather, easy drinking and refreshing, but I don't think I'll seek it out."

"O: An oddly small beer that grew on me over time. That first sip, though – now that was a little too light for my tastes. Allow this one to warm up a little, allowing the grainy wheat notes to overtake what little bitters stick out when it’s chilled. In all, I think I can say that I like it for what it is compared to what it’s supposed to be, but nothing more."

"Got in a trade with swingracex. 12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 4/25/2013. Pours hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of lemon, pear, light banana, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, floral, grass, and earthy yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester notes with light hops; and good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, light banana, pepper, clove, wheat, bread, floral, grass, and earthy yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruits, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, floral, and earthiness on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters; with a great malt backbone and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; wit ha moderately creamy and very smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice wheat ale! Very nice balance and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to drink. Really enjoyed this one."

"Poured into pint glass. Apperance is bright yellow with brilliant clarity and a heavy covering of white head. Nice retention and tons of lacing. The smell is very aromatic with lemon and orange peel coming first. Heavy wheat presence come next and provides a dry bready quality. The taste is very mild and refreshing. Light fruity notes balanced with a bit of grain, that's about it. Mouthfeel is also light and moderately carbonated. Overall, a very refreshing wheat beer that is also very easy drinking."

"O: While it not a very complex beer, it is still a great brew. One I would recommend for someone that just got into craft beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with a fairly high level of carbonation that is expected for the style. The result is, though, a mouthfeel that's a bit painfully fizzy at first, gradually smoothing out to a slow flow across the palate. Features a semi-dry close that's appropriate for the flavors and the style as a whole. The sharp fizziness unfortunately makes this a bit less in my opinion."

"Though I am a fan of suspended chunks of yeast, and wheat beers in general, the taste was a slightly too heavy towards the wheat. I think the brewer hit what they were aiming for, though, and I can respect that."
""
"O - The clean finish and subtle sweetness makes this beer very drinkable and the complex, spicy flavor begs another sip. One of the better wheat beers out there. <5>"

"Overall this is one of the better Wheat Ales i have tried. Odell does a great job with making true session beers flavorful. Great brew for around the pool when it is 105 out!"

"Mouthfeel is negligible, aftertaste is nasty- grassy, vaguely sour."

"Bottle enjoyed in Fort Collins, but not at the brewery. Nice looking wheat, clear and glowing gold. Not overly complex, but the flavors are crisp, clean, and vibrant. Black pepper, grass, and lemon peel mingle beautifully with the crackery wheat. A hint of herbal bitterness keeps it dry and interesting. Quality, easy going, low impact beer with just enough oomph to stand up to the fish taco that I paired it with."
"Overall, a very solid wheat beer. Very sessionable and clean tasting."
""
""
""
"D – One of the sweeter wheat beers lacking the spicy coriander that some beers seem to focus on. Very refreshing and on the light side as far as filling me up. The mouthfeel is of a medium-bodied beer. Interesting."

"light wheat aromas coming off of this one. thee is a definite hint of hops in there as well with a light lemon sort of smell sitting around in the back. Light grass and some yeast aromas as well. Lots of grain in this one with a good deal of wheat coming through. Almost has that weird macro corn flavor as well, very strange. Finish is very dry with a nice bitter hoppy finish and a long drawn out flavor of bitter tangerine like."
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden with a medium white head. Smell is a whiff of coriander, followed by some raw grain. Taste is citrus up front, followed by bread finishing with some mild yeast. Mouthfeel is average. Overall a good beer, though a bit ho hum."
"a tasty wheat brew pours a cloudy grainy yellow with a lively white head. nose is a bit fruity, definitely smell the yeast that remains here. flavor is that of a standard wheat beer, high quality, smooth. the standout feature of this one is its mouthfeel. it is on the lighter bodied side, but has a stronger element of satisfaction than most. the high carbonaiton is perfect for this one. good outdoor summer beer, but not limited to that setting. perfectly enjoyable well into the fall as well"
"I find this to be a find wheat beer that is easy to drink but not particularly engaging."
"Nothing stands out on this beer but I think that's why I like it. Not the best but by far not the worst."
"I think that I was a bit shocked by how much I liked this one. It’s a full flavored Wheat Ale with a decidedly hoppy American edge to it and just overall packs a tasty crisp tanginess to it that is quite refreshing and drinkable. I’d go for a glass of this, not just on a hot summer day, but any day period!"
"Pours a hazy gold with creamy thin white head. Good retention and nice lacing. The aroma is of sweet wheat, a touch of citrus, and fresh cut grass. The taste follows with a strong, sweet bready wheat backbone, a hint of banana, orange peel zest, black pepper and faint hint of clove. Very well balanced, medium bodied, and refreshing. Great summertime beer."
"We sampled this one at the Odell Taproom with some friends, a few Saturdays ago. Poured a hazy dark golden color with a decent white head. Aromas of citrus and bready yeast. On the palate, this one is light bodied and very refreshing, with citrus, yeast and wheat. One of the better wheat offerings out here."
"Medium bodied with a nice balance of zesty spice, bready yeast and sweet citrus fruit.  Very similar to the aroma with hints of wheat, bread yeast along with peppery clove, lemon zest and orange peel.  The spice character is prominent but the other notes still shine through.  Mineraly dry finish.  Clean and refreshing with a nice dry spicy character to give balance and complexity.  Good wheat beer for the summer.  Lacking in alcohol an banana flavor but still pretty solid.  "
"A very drinkable beer. Fine, but not a lot of character. This is not a dis at the style as I believe some more yeast and wheat character would have made this much more interesting."
"O - overall, a very nice beer. I had some time ago but have forgotten how solid it is. The aroma in particular was very nice."
"Overall, this is pretty easy to drink. The light sweetness of the malt with the lemony citrus finish is nice and refreshing."
"Overall/notes - This is the American Wheat I've been waiting for! Finally, a clean, easy beer with massive amount of flavor. Definitely a summer beer in my book, and hell, I could drink this anytime regardless. Fantastic first go-around with Odell... I look forward to the rest of the brews that await me in the fridge."
"A fine example of a clean American wheat beer and not a bad session ale. The aroma is not quite citrusy, but there's a floral note behind the sweet-smelling wheat and barley malt. The flavor has a slight sugar cookie taste to it upfront with more nuanced bread dough and clove notes in the finish. I'm not usually a big fan of the style, but this is very well done, right down the light (but not too light) body and smooth mouthfeel. I'd take another."
"Not a bad brew, but nothing I would travel or trade for."
"O: A nice refreshing beer. I do like it for a style I usually shy away from."
"This wheat gives the feel really of being down to earth, its raw and organic while still being refreshing and crisp. A more sophisticated wheat than the filtered varieties that pop out around summer and does well as a hefewiessen without the fruity character."
"Drinkability - Very interesting beer. The perfect mouthfeel, combined with the smooth easiness of the flavor, and great aftertaste make the drinkability of this beer very high."
"D: One of my absolute favorites of this style. Will patronize this one much during the summer."
"D - Very drinkable. While this beer is not breaking new ground in beer, they make this style well."
"Drinkability - very easy to drink, not VERY complex, but good-tasting."
"Wheat beers. I never used to like them, until I took a trip to Belgium and had a Hoegaarden on the Grand-Place. Now I nearly exclusively drink Vitamin H (Vitamin Hefewisen) during the summer. It's gotten to the point that I can't wait for summer to come to clear the IPA's out of the fridge and stock up on a variety of my favorite wheats. I have taste tested many side by side, and the Odell Easy Street Wheat is my standard. With a fine head and medium blond color, it's got the perfect blend of sweetness and citrusy tang that make wheat beers so good. I can easily drink a few Easy Streets when it's a nice day out on the deck."
"Good mellow body; ample carbonation. Light feel. Well-crafted combination of sweet bread, mild yeast, faintly tart citrus tones, and smooth oats. Great refreshing beer! This is a beer I would crave all through the summer months. Wish I had access to it locally."
"This is a finely crafted American wheat. I would imagine that Odell sells a lot of this, and rightly so."
"D - Drinkabilty for Easy Street is off the charts. The balance of this beer is accomplished by slight hints of fruit, dryness, earthiness/yeastiness, and carbonation. Perfectly balanced wheat."
"D: If it weren't for Boulevard's Unfiltered Wheat beer, this would be a go-to wheat. Still an understated and elegant attempt, pretty standard fare for Odell."
"Incredibly well done."
"Pours a hazy yellow gold color with a white head and a bit of lacing. The nose brings some light wheat and lemon and not too much else. The same can be said of the taste, though it incorporates some light grain and bread. Light feel with nice carbonation; this is a good way to start and is quite sessionable."
"Beer is light in body and its a little wheaty in the mouth. Some sweet fruits flavors are in the mid palate and finishes with a slight aftertaste. Its highly drinkable. Mouthfeel is OK, could use considerably more carbonation, could just a little more wheat flavor, but I guess I'm asking an American wheat to be a hefeweizen. This beer is handicapped."
"Overall a fantastic, easy-drinking, lighter summer ale. Certainly worth a try if you're into this style. I can't imagine why it doesn't score higher here. Maybe because it isn't 10%+ ABV and it doesn't have over 80 IBU."
"Overall a very enjoyable wheat beer, especially coming from someone who is not hugely fond of this type of beer."
"D - Overall an enjoyable wheat beer but not one that I would pick out of a crowd of wheat beers."
"D - Overall this is a pretty decent wheat beer not really much different than any other American Wheat"
"Cheers!"
"Taste, surprisingly abundant. Big wheat flavor, more of the grassy and crackery vibe. Odell really has been coming on strong lately, ten years ago, wasn't all that impresssed with these guys(gals?). Just like this style more than hefe's, you get some of the citrus feel and just the slightest hop smack."
"A very enjoyable wheat beer. Plenty of flavor that is subtle and nuanced. A good standby, and something that I would Recommend."
"M & D - light body with good high co2. very drinkable"
"Drinkability: Though simple, it's nicely refreshing and easily drinkable; it's a fine, fitting little wheat ale."
"D: This is a nice light session beer. Yet the overall experience didn't do that much for me. Still, it's a good example of the style."
"Bottom line; Excellent brew from the excellent brewers at Odell's. See you all there this summer!"
"D- Very enjoyable beer. Would love to get more of this. Nice sessionable wheat beer that would be a nice step for a macro drinker to have."
"Pours a hazy straw color with a large white head. The predominant aroma is wheat, which is to be expected. The flavor is wheat with some citrus, a damn good beer. This is very easy drinking and would be very quenching if it was drank on a hot day. The beer has a thinner mouthfeel."
"Pours a lightly hazey golden sunshine and very light amber colro. The head is one finger after the pour, but recedes to film, and then to nothing after some drinking. The aroma is light bananas, pilsnery dry malt, and toasted wheat thins. The taste dry and faintly fruity from the yeasty bananas. The malt lends some thin crackery flavors. The finish is dry, satisfying, and begging you to take another sip."
"There is not a whole lot going on here; this is a straight forward example of an American Wheat beer. Even when judged against the style though, it doesn't seem to achieve quite the rusticity that something like Widmer manages to even achieve. This seems a bit too clean, even for an American Wheat. Not bad though, and certainly far from objectionable."
"Odell Easy Street Wheat pours a golden yellow with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is wheaty, there's not much else to it. The flavor is also wheaty, this is a simple, enjoyable session brew. Nothing really stands out, nothing offends and it's easy drinking. Good summer hot weather beer."
"For a wheat drinker i dont think it gets any better than this they seem to have nailed the style down perfectly just not for me"
"Minimal head. what appears disappears faster than i'd think. cloudy, but no yeast in suspension. lemon, and grass notes, with a nice malt presence. smell isn't pronounced, but appealing. taste is lemony with a bit of hops to give a nice punch in the finish. really refreshing. well carbonated, a bit chewey and sticky. drinkability is exceptional."
"D - Smooth easy drinking beer."
"Light to medium bodied, clean and smooth on the palate. Again, good but not special. Easy Street Wheat is certainly drinkable, if only by virtue of being a wheat, but this doesn't leave me really wanting to finish the glass, let alone have another. Overall a good enough beer, but not at the top of my list when I want a wheat."
"All in all, I'm digging this one. As far as light pale wheats go, this one is spot on. a touch on the light side, but sometimes I'm in the mood... and this one definitely fits the bill."
"Btw, excellent head retention and very good lacing for the style."
"Pours a nice cloudy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little white head, with some sticky lacing. The nose is malty, with some grassy notes, and spice. The taste is malty, slightly sweet, grassy notes, slight spice. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad brew."
"Very drinkable pale wheat. This is highly sessionable & goes great with pizza."
"This beer pours a nice golden yellow with a small white head that quickly disappears. Smells of bread, wheat, banana's and lemon peel. The taste is fresh and clean with lemon and yeasty flavors. The mouthfeel has light body and finishes clean. Drinkability is very good, i could easily drink a few of these. It's snowing here in Marquette, MI on the evening of March 31st. If I were on the beach on a nice sunny day I would drink these the whole day through. Not as good as Bell's Oberon in my opinion but still a damn good beer."
"Thanks to JMBSH for this one and the other Odells he sent in a recent trade. You rock."
"helluva wheat beer as far as i'm concerned. i could take it easy and drink alot of this..."
"Conclusion: Highly drinkable, fresh, citrusy, wonderful summer beer...definitely one of the best examples of the style...I still prefer the typical estery/phenolic Bavarian Hefeweizen stylistically, but for an American Pale Wheat, this is absolutely as good as it gets"
"Drinkability: A must try."
"D- Very good. Real easy to drink. Such a clean and refreshing Wheat with enough flavor and aroma to keep my interest for a few."
"D - Not bad. Forgettable maybe, but not bad."
"Full of flavor, and fairly lively, Easy Street is a refreshing and enjoyable American take on a classic style. It's perfectly balanced, and it offers more than enough character to keep it interesting beyond one serving. Kudos!"
"Tasted on 8/1/08."
"It had a bit of a head but disappeared super quickly and there was not much for lace. The body was an orange hazy color and gets little lighter towards the bottom of the glass. It smells a little bit malty and beany. It has mild flavor for a wheat beer. It has a grainy and biscuit like aftertaste. It is easy to drink but very mild on flavor. Very refreshing."
"Overall - An excellent lighter-style beer, perfect for people just getting into beers but fine for the beer geek as well. I am prejudiced against wheat beers, in fact I can't remember any other wheats that I like nearly as much as this one. But love it I do. Well worth trying."
"Easy Street is a good hot summer day beer. Its mild flavor allow for easy drinkability and quenches a heavy thirst. It has a hazy dark yellow to orange color and pours to a decent but not impresive head. The swirling and addition of the yeast as indicated on the bottle quickly reduces the head but does add to the citrusy flavor. The malt has bread like tones but is not all that sweet. This is a good step up beer for those ussually drinking large commercial lagers who want to experiment into the craft brew market."
"D_A well rounded beer that manages to be rather refreshing. While there are obvious flaws this is a beer I would reach for again if I could."
"D - very easy drinking and refreshing. The nose of a hefeweizen and a taste of an APWA. Overall, this is a pretty decent wheat beer and another solid beer from Odell."
"D: Very refreshing and very drinkable. Solid wheat beer."
"D: Refreshingly thirst-quenching. Easy drinking? Why, you're on Easy Street."
"Refreshing and intriguing, very easy to drink. A lot going on for a beer on the lighter side."
"Pours a gorgeous glowing, cloudy, thick bright orange color with a smallish white head and light lacing. Smell is very wheaty, slightly fruity and appealing. Taste is refreshing and very wheaty with a strong lingering wheat finish. Lightly tart in the middle with a hint of lemony brightness and a touch of yeastiness without much in the way of clove or spicing, which I really liked about it. Mouthfeel is fairly light, but suitable for the style and keeps it refreshing without being too thin. Drinkability is very good, and this is a very nice thirst quenching summer beer. I enjoyed it."
"M/D: This beer just works magic in the mouth, creamy, smooth and packs just the right amount bite from the carbonation and hops. The drinkability if you couldn't tell already is great I could drink many of these and I have on many occasions."
"The body is moderate with a nice silky note like you would get from oats. Really enhances the flavor but still easy drinking and not heavy at all. Overall a good wheat, not sure why this doesn't do better. I prefer over Oberon or Gumball Head."
"A hazy yellow color with a fizzed off white head. The nose has lots of wheat malts but also some good caramel and fruit presence. The taste also has a big wheat presence. Some light lemon citrus going on here as well. It goes down smooth and is a drinkable wheta beer. Average mouthfeel and body."
"D: Very drinkable and with such a low alcohol content this a great session beer. One of my favorites on a hot day, or when wanting to put back a great wheat beer. Very good."
"D: High drinkability - only problem might be getting tired of the mouthfeel or yeastyness."
"Poured a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice and refreshing wheat malt and yeast scent. It is light and a bit citrusy. The taste is good also. It has a smooth wheat malt flavor that is a bit grainy. It goes down easy and finishes dry and fruity. The mouthfeel is fine."
"D - This was pretty good. I've had the bottle version before, but on tap it seemed better than my memory recalled."
"12 oz bottle pours a cloudy golden body with a tall vanilla head. Excellent retention and ample clingy lacing. Aroma is mostly clove, with notes of wheat, yeast, and banana. Mouthfeel is a bit overcarbonated with a light medium body. Taste is spicy clove and coriander with citrusy lemon and green banana mingling with light notes of yeast and wheat. Good example of one of my least favorite styles."
"The taste is a mixture of hops and wheat, a good balance of both. Mouthfeel is great but I feel it could use a tad bit more body. I really like the taste and at just 5% ABV and with its delightful aftertaste, you can easily have this beer on the tap when you invite people over for a barbecue. If I went to the horriblest bar in the world that had only the worst beers, if they have Odell's Easy Street Wheat, I know I will have a good time :)"
"Drinkability: Above average, great for a hot day. Overall, a good solid wheat beer."
"Drinkability: These are quite easy to drink, and would be ideal for a session. If I saw this available on tap, I would definitely give it a shot at a bar."
"Poured a cloudy golden, with a bright white head typical of a wheat ale. Grassy, mild herby aroma. Taste was nice, not much to describe. Very easy drinking, a great beer for hot weather. Not a bad beer, by any means, just wouldn't grab a six pack amongst other choices from CO."
"Seems like most wheats get their taste from a citrusy spice which usually requires a slice of lemon or orange to bring it out, but the flavor here stood out on its own."
"Flavors are mostly light; lemon, citrus and corriander. slight doughy taste comes through, a bit sticky at first. Still a bit light in the finish, but on a hot night it went down fairly crisp. Not rich or over the top."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle a cloudy (after swirling the last half inch or so), bright golden yellow with about a finger of white foam that quickly fades. Sporadic lacing is left on the glass as I make my way to the bottom. Smells of spicy yeast, lemony citrus, and some bready notes. Tastes of peppery citrus, faint notes of tangerine, as well as a hint of sweetness from the malt. Medium in both body and carbonation, this beer is quite refreshing. It's a humid day and I find that this beer went down rather quickly. I'd recommend giving it a try if you can."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, good summer quaffer. I will likely purchase again."
"Not going to challenge the taste buds, very clean and light all around. Easy drinker but no real reason to choose this over another American wheat."
"D: Easy Street is crazy refreshing, and I think I could drink gallons in the summer. It has a great flavor profile and is very balanced. I'm not usually a huge fan of wheat beers, but this one has definitely grown on me."
"Had during my trip to Denver since not available in Texas. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Label had a best by date. It had a yellowish, light honey color. It had a thin head with good carb. It had a good APWA smell with sweet malt and a worty smell. The mouthfeel was good. The taste was really good for the style. Was smooth and easy drinking and would be a good session beer. I always have at least a couple when I visit Colorado. Really wish I could get here. Recommend trying. These beers aren't going knock you over with their taste but for what they are this one is really good. (4, HR, T, Y, session)"
"Drinkability - An easy drinking wheat, that is as refreshing as it is quaffable. And at 4.6% ABV. lends its self nicely to long summer drinking sessions, possibly on a boat with a grill...."
"Easy Street Wheat pours a murky off-yellow color, traces of gold-like sediments that will be quickly absorbed by the bubbling carbonation. Wheats, fresh lemon juice and on-off notes of grainy hops. Toasty wheat malts with a fair amount of carbonation. Sweet citrus tones, orange and lemon zest. Medium in body, powdery light yeast tones and as it warms, some yeast, bread and floral hops. The finish is dry and sweety-sour; great flavorings and a pretty decent wheat ale."
"Overall, I don't really care for American wheat beers, but this is a well done version. I'm happy to grab it at places where more adventurous micros aren't available."
"Slightly hazy, pale straw colored beer with a minimal head. No lacing whatsoever. Aroma hints of crisp malt and not much else. Flavor is clean, with a touch of wheat. No yeast flavors apparent and just a touch of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is also fairly light, but not thin. Drinkability is OK. One was enough, but I would pick this over any macro lager. Might be a toss-up with Blue Moon. Seriously, just not enough here to bring me back. However, I won't avoid other offerings by Odell either if the opportunity presents itself. It's a well-brewed beer, just not interesting or remotely captivating."
"The drinkability factor is way up on this beer. Despite the fact that there really isn't much complexity this beer is quite tasty and very refreshing. If this were available in Texas it would be a regular summertime resident in my refrigerator."
"Hazy straw yellow in color. Decent sized white head that stuck around pretty well as it died down. Wheaty, bready, earthy aroma, that was realtivly sweet and fruity. The taste was a lot like wheaty lemon grass, yeasty and bready but with at citrus and lemon-like zing. A fair amount of fruity bubbble gum flavor as well. It was a lot like standard American hefes, but with more fruity rich flavor. Tangy, but not too much mouthfeel. Very drinkable. One of the best American wheat beers I have had."
"Still feel that The Germans are the undisputed kings in the world of wheat beers, but this is a pretty solid beer regardless and much better than most beers, in a style I find boring overall."
"Hot day & this went down too quick. An okay take on the style, nothing to get fired up about"
"Pours a smidge hazy yellow/gold with no much of a head. Aroma is grains, a little skunky. Flavor is thin, slight citrus flavors and wheat mustiness. I am coming to the conclusion that American Wheats are not my thing. Thanks to jhammerly for the bottle."
"This is what you brew if your not trying to offend anyones palate. Best by 11.24.06"
"Drinkability: Great, but not wheat beer drinkability. Reminds me more of micro-macro styles (New Glarus Spotter Cow and Naked, Capital Island Wheat, Straub etc) than of more solid American wheat beers. Seems to havethe characteristic Odell underdevelopment of flavors too. If I could find it at the right price, it could still be a great yardwork/summer porch beer that you could work on for hours without ending up strung out."
"12 oz bottle poured into an Imperial pint glass. Very nice head to start off with. Quite chunky and white, about 2 1/2 fingers. It took it's time to settle down, about 5-8 minutes. Good lacing retention, lasted almost to the very end. Color was a typical hazy yellow/orange for a wheat. Smell was wheat and yeasty biscuits. A tad hint of citrus hops. Taste was very bready, but as it warmed a more lemon zest comes out. Mouthfeel is light and a bit watery, pretty mild in the carbonation. This is a pretty standard wheat. Not the greatest, but not the worst."
"My friend really enjoys wheat beers. He usually drinks Bristol's Beehive or Blue Moon. I encouraged him to try something new. He picked up this six-pack and I'm glad he did. Very nice wheat beer. Poured a nice unfiltered cloudy gold. A slight head takes away from the appearance. Good aroma and an enjoyable malt profile. Nice crisp finish. I don't typically prefer wheat beers, but this was a good change of pace. Very refreshing, but I think I'll have an IPA next."
"Bottle left at my house by some BA after a BA gathering. Thanks for the opportunity. Pouors a one finger white frothy head. Very cloudy straw yellow, as I swirled the sediment and dumped it into the glass. Smells peachy and earthy clove. Tastes richly of peaches. Wheat and honey. Clove edge is mild. This beer is heavy on the fruity wet and mild on the phenols. Simple and easy drinking. Md-lightbody and moderate carbonation."
"Not hard to drink, but really not much to it at all. Boring and forgettable."
"If you want to prove to someone that beer doesn't have to be bitter, this is one beer to give him/her. Very pretty and nice, with a nice white head. It's a decent, light smell and taste, with lots of smooth wheatiness and some citrus and a hint of clove. Nice mouthfeel and very drinkable. A good introductory Hefe-weizen, but it certainly doesn't measure up to many of the German imports."
"D: Average drinkability. I could see putting a lemon wedge in here to enhance the flavor a bit, and it could be enjoyable on a hot day. Otherwise its not a great Hefeweizen overall..."
"Appearance: Cloudy golden orange tint fluffy white head leaves even specks of lacing. Aroma: Wheat sharpness no esters here, we have an American Wheat, with biscuit yeast character to it and light herbal hop dose with citrus zest tones. Taste: Mix of sharp wheat sweetness touch of the citrus tartness herbal hop character very well balanced and tasty at the same time. Mouthfeel: Light bodied evenly carbonated smooth on the palate. Drinkability: No lemon needed refreshing great tasting unfiltered wheat ale beats the pants off of Widmer and many other similar productions of the style."
"Mouthfeel was very light and well carbonated. Drinkable only to be nice and not to seem like a snob when someone offered it to me in kind."
"Sometimes I look back on my old reviews and see what a dope I sounded like at the time. Note my spelling of witbier....nice one."
"Appearance is hazy, as a Wheat Beer should be, with yeast that needs to be swirled into the glass. Color is a yellow amber with lots of foam and some lace. Aroma is like fresh dug earth, sweet malt, citrus  producing a nice crisp sensation. Body is medium. Initial taste is dominated by sourdough bread, creamy malt, floral hops are just-right bitter. Aftertaste has a touch of yeast with dark notes, but overall sweet malt."
"Overall impression: Nice wheat beer - nothing out of the ordinary, but this beer is well made. Highly drinkable for the summer months, and compliments food nicely."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice and refreshing wheat malt and yeast scent. It is light and a bit citrusy. The taste is good also. It has a smooth wheat malt flavor that is a bit grainy. It goes down easy and finishes dry and fruity. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good wheat beer. It's light, tastey and highly drinkable."
"I tried this beer last night. To sum it up in one word: citrus. It smells slightly of lemon, and the taste hints at a lot of lemon as well. The mouthfeel was somewhat thin, but not overly watery. It did have a nice head in my glass with a nice cloudy yellow color, overall not a bad brew, just not as good as some other american wheats and not even close to some of the better German hefe-weizens i've had. Drinkability seems that it would be best in the summer by the pool like ice tea or lemonade or something. Worth a try but not a regular buy in my book."
"Drinkability is fine, but other then the milky head you might as well be drinking Budweiser."
"As the smells promised, the taste was also sweet and malty; the hops are noticed a bit later. The mouthfeel was excellent: light, crisp, and mildly bitter at the end. This is a solid wheat beer, but strikes me as being more of an American Wheat than a Hefe. Still, it goes down as another tasty wheat beer made right here in the central US."
"Hazy gold in color, topped by 1/4"" head that lastst the duration. Scents of citrus and wheat, slightly unusual. Taste is bolld, then ends mellow. Sharp citrus flavors offset by a smooth wheat/banana finish. Great summertime beer. To bad it's 60 degress here in july..."
"This is a barely better than average wheat beer from a quality Colorado microbrewery. Unfortunately, there's nothing here to bring me back a second time. I'm sure that I'll forget about Easy Street Wheat by the time my pint glass has drip-dried."
"Cloudy yellow pour with a medium-sized white head. Mild smell with a hint of citrus. Taste was pretty good, but not as much wheat or yeast flavor as expected in a wheat beer. Slight citrus taste and good hop flavor. Very smooth mouthfeel with good carbonation. Good drinkability. No off flavors... well made. Pretty good example of an American wheat."
"Cloudy, hazy yellow color, with a huge white frothy and sticky head that stays around for awhile. This has citrus and wheat aromas, light wheaty, and yeasty flavors of lemon, medium in body, great soft and creamy mouthfeel, has a nice clean and refreshing finish, well done."
"Yeasty flavors are are highly present in this beer as well as wheat and very subtle hops. I also picked up some citrus tones and a pinch of banana. Overall, a sold wheat. One of the better wheats brewed in Colorado."
"Pours a hazy orange with a medium-sized white head--not as big as expected. Lots of bubbles though. Smell is yeasty with a citrus tinge. Very good mouthfeel, bubbly, and crisp. Light malts up front, followed by a rush of crisp, yeasty lemon. Finish is dry and tangy, almost bitter. Not quite Oberon, but I could drink this all summer long."
"This brew wasn't bad, but there are many better wheat beers on the market. It would do in a pinch, but would never be my first choice."
"Thanks to prAna for this one. This is possibly the least wheaty Wheat beer I have tried. Pours a very foggy orangish-yellow color with a thin white head. Aroma of light hops, straw, and citrus. The flavor is very light and carbonated and was more reminiscent of a Lager than a Wheat. Strange. Tasted of mellow hops and not much else. Dry finish. Not very impressed with this one."
"This brew is unfiltered, but you wouldn’t know it looking at it.  The brew pours a clear golden color with a thin lacy head exuding a very biscuity aroma that is a bit harsh. The flavor consists of a light malt presence with a very mellow lingering bitterness and a hint of the biscuit from the aroma.  No yeast flavor to speak of, quite disappointing."
"This was re-reviewed in October 2003 and I like in much better than before. So much so I think I need to drink it again. Was I actually impressed with an American Wheat ale? Yeah, I was."
"Pours a hazy pale straw with a nice creamy white head.  Smell is of wheat and a nice yeast aroma.  Yeasty flavors are throughout this beer as the wheat and very subtle hops make themselves known.  Well balanced and very creamy in the mouth.   Highly drinkable.  A very nice american wheat ale, very full yeast flavors throughout make this very creamy and drinkable.  Great summertime brew."
"Hazy yellow w/ an ample and persistent white head.  Looks like a slightly dark Wit, but any resemblance ends there.  A bit of lemon - like tartness and graininess in aroma w/ not much else. Just a hint of citrusy hop nose is there as well. Very smooth on the palette, with no outstanding flavors.  The mild sweetness is offset by the equally mild hop bitterness.  The typical lack of character is true to style.  Finishes clean and inoffensive.  Easy Street has just a bit more flavor than your run of the mill American wheat. Good drinkability if you're thirsty."
"Notes: Clean cut American wheat brew, well focused on the malts with a well balancing hops and yeast. Optimum lunch time beer material here! Right up there with Widmer’s and Harpoon’s UFO."
