Many view the style as being rather boring and uninspired, but when you come across a well-crafted brew like this you can appreciate the simple pleasures it has to offer. It makes for a great summer quaff or beach beer. Pick up a sixer of this as a nice change of pace from the ubiquitous Sam Summer.

3.8,6.1,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Sampled a 12 oz. tulip glass at Beer Revolution in Calgary. Odd serving choice for an American wheat but they do that with the more pricy US imports. This one is a semi-cloudy bright yellow brew, maybe just a hint of orange, with a light spray of white bubbles riding on top. Aroma is bright and citric, with lemon and orange hops front and center, wheat spice and doughy sweet rolls in the background. Tastes like dilute orange juice or vitamin C chews, lemon rind, gummy worms, perhaps a little noble hop peppered flower water ... Sweet and hoppy for an American wheat and fucking tasty on a certain level (e.g., if you are sitting outside and its blazing hot). Like some a-hole squeezed a citrus wedge into the beer except no one actually did thank God, this is all hops doing the talking. Rather fizzy and has an interesting slick (almost oily) mouthfeel but finishes crisp, dry, and clean as expected. Gotta say, this stands out from the pedestrian mass of dull safe American wheat beers and does so quite handily. If I were to compare it to an aggressively hopped wheat like Lagunitas Little Sumpin, this is like a little brother session alternative, with hop flavor trumping the bitterness.","CalgaryFMC","Apr 15, 2014"

Well, actually, it was hard to hear what it was saying over the howling of Hurricane/Tropical Storm Sandy, but I extrapolated based on previous knowledge. As such, I got a finger of thin, bone-white head with low retention off of my pour. Chalk the dying head up to barometric conditions, which are less than optimal right now. Color was a deeply cloudy orangish-yellow. Nose was very wheat-like with that sweetish scent that wheat imparts in beer. I always think of my Pops and his Wheaties when I was a kid when I smell it in beer. No question in my mind that wheat malts were in play here. Mouthfeel was medium it had a slight lemony tartness on the tongue which another feature of wheat beers. Finish was semi-dry and very refreshing. This would be an excellent summertime beer.","woodychandler","Oct 29, 2012"

There is a very mild hint of bitterness on the palate with each sip. There is also a weird, slightly funky aftertaste that comes out more as the beer warms.

A decent amount of rising carbonation can be seen within. Aromas of wheat and some pale malt sweetness can be smelled coming off of the beer. The beer has a very pleasing pale wheat flavor. There is a healthy amount of grain here, but it isn't too sweet. The noble hops and some balance, but they do not posess a very strong flavor. They may add to the kiss of spiciness in the finish, but that could be only the yeast. Like many beers of this style, this ones tastes refreshing and would probably be best consumed on a warm day. It's medium body isn't sticky, and the carbonation levels are just right. It is a good example of the style, though not impressive enough for me to have it shipped across country again, as there are many fine examples produced closer to home. For anyone on the west coast, this is a good one to try.","ToasterChef","Mar 29, 2012"

The wheat malt isn't as clean as I'd expect for an American wheat, it's a pleasant sweet bread flavor. Balanced by the malt are very fruity hops, lots of citrus and no harsh bitterness. There's also a little kick of yeasty earthyness. All in all, this is relatively complex session beer. At times I got a slight cilantro aroma, which makes me think they used Summit hops. I also could have used a little bitterness, but maybe that's just me.","tempest","Mar 22, 2008"

The taste and mouthfeel are very smooth, with the citrus and yeast a little overpowering the hops for a sweeter drink, but I am not complaining.

The smell is what you might expect from an American wheat beer; wheat (duh), a hint of citrus fruitiness and maybe just a touch of yeast. The taste is much the same, starts slightly sweet with the wheat and citrus notes shining through but it finishes with a mild bitterness that is transparent in the smell, making for a well balanced beer. The mouthfeel is a light-medium body with a fairly agressive carbonation that suits the beer well. Overall a very enjoyable and sessionable beer. Quaffable even.

I will admit that I like strong flavors in a beer, so anything that is very full will most likely get more points from me.

Aromas hint at sweetness beneath -- a bit of caramel in there, along with a few more fruity esters of the citrus variety. Pretty typical for an American wheat beer -- mildly citric, very little spice. On the tongue, the citrus flavors are the biggest story here. At first the beer is sharply carbonated and a little sweet, but at the mid-palate it starts to dry out, with the citrusy acid components taking over. The finish is quite dry and slightly bitter, with lingering tingles on the tongue.

Taste - oh, this is definitely not a witbier, which is what I was anticipating when I excitedly and hurriedly saw a North Coast wheat beer and picked it up as part of a mix-a-six. That definitely comes into play here as I don't enjoy most other wheat beer styles... Taste is tangy, bitey, and citrusy, not sweet. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light though, with too much carbonation especially for a wheat beer. On the tounge it is not as heavy as I would expect it to be. This is light years better than Magic Hat's circus boy, for certain. And it is drinkable. If you like this style, I think it would be an fine beer to stock for casual drinking.

Man, I'm looking forward to the coming months to see what the world has to offer in these styles, but this was pretty lackluster. I found the color pale and a little cloudy, the smell was of lemon zest and a little bananna. No real spicey kick to speak of and overall the taste was watery.... I mean, at times it was like drinking lemonade. There was just enough scent and taste of the style of a wheat beer to make me want to hunt down the great versions, but this was lacking.

Aroma: Doesn't have the characteristic yeast notes of the banana clove combo but it is filled with a bouquet of spices and different tones and an underlying citrus tone that blends well with the sharp sweetness of the wheat malt just ties it all together. Taste is a wonderful mix of yeasty mustiness, sharp sweet malted wheat, a mild huskiness to it and definite hops seems a bit medicinal but in a good way if that makes sense. Mouthfeel: Although no chewy there's still a great deal of texture spurred by the healthy amount of carbonation this one goes down as one of the better American wheat beers I have come across. Drinkability: Refreshing perfect for the style for the summertime, I must say. Good overall shot at making a wheat beer every North Coast brew I've tried has been remarkable in their own way, while this one may not compare to Red Seal, Old No. 38, Scrimshaw, or Old Rasputin it really hits the spot.
