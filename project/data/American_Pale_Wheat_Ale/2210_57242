For an unfiltered beer, there is curiously no hint of sediment. Medium to high amount of bubbly carbonation seen around the edges and in towards the middle. Smell is of wheat malts, astringent. taste is of wheat, orange, honey. Feels heavier than expected not he palette and salty. Overall a decent but forgettable brew.","keenberg87","Jan 21, 2014"

It poured well, had a nice hazy unfiltered look with a descent head (what you should expect from an unfiltered wheat beer), but immediately I could tell that I wasn't going to like it. The aroma was overwhelmingly of banana esters and sweet off 'bubble-gum' like flavors. I took a sip and it was just more of the same. After two sips I decided that I couldn't drink it. It's probably just my personal preference, since I HATE bananas. If it was a flavor that I enjoyed this probably could have been a good beer. Odd that it has such a distinct and odd flavor profile.

3.3,-9.8,3.5,3.5,3.25,2.5,3.5,"12oz single was bottled on 4/18/13. Chilled. Pours into pint glass a sickly yellow, nicely cloudy, with a moderate white head which rapidly falls. Aroma of lemon, wheat, and a hint of clove. Sharply fizzy and of moderate body. The carbonation helps to accentuate the tart flavors here, which I'm going to attribute (having cheated and looked at the brewer's notes) to the acidulated malt. Spicy clove flavors come through in the taste as well, but not much else does. Mild and enjoyable, and it would be a great summer session wheat ale *except* for the overly carbonated mouthfeel.","hreb","Jul 14, 2013"

The nose comprises sweet biscuit, powdered sugar, a pinch of nutmeg, a tiny touch of lemon peel, and some banana throughout the background. The taste holds notes of orange zest, coriander, and light banana. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel.

Flavor is mild with doughy bread overtones, a bit of spice, slight citrus peel and a bit of hop bitterness on the finish. Light and refreshing. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation. Another good summer wheat beer, refreshing and sessionable without being overwhelming.","Auraan","May 09, 2013"

Body is slightly hazy, honey colored. Smell is lemongrass, chalky, hint of bananas. Taste is nice. Faintly lemony, hint of bananas, light sweetness, refreshing and wet. Body is medium light and crisply carbonated, works well with the taste.

The fruit profile (from the yeast, of course),is a bit on the weak side, and coupled with the thin palate with bready flavors but without the fullness from the wheat, this beer does come across as flawed. In addition, the acidity, while higher than you'd expect, doesn't really work with the flavor profile. The carbonation is medium-high, adding to the acidity and keeping the finish from picking up too much flavor. While this is a rather excellent combination of an American Pale Wheat Ale and a Hefeweizen, it does, by definition, come up short on the hedonic scale. Worthy.","DefenCorps","Sep 11, 2012"

I know that's what they are going for, but for me it can be off-putting. The yeast and spices dominate the palate with hop bitterness coming through and a dry finish. It's definitely a hybrid of sorts - not a true American Pale Wheat - with certain characteristics of a Saison and even a traditional Hef. I appreciate what they are going for, but for me this is not the summer beer I wanted it to be. It's a little too busy to lay back with, but from a technical standpoint FW can be commended.","TheRealBigC","Jul 28, 2012"

I applaud Firestone for doing something that probably isnt their specialty and doing a good job. Just not a great job.","bunnyhustle","Apr 22, 2010"
4.1,12,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Witbiers are my go to for warmer weather, but considering I can't ever get Allagash White this is going to be my new choice! If it stays stocked that is. This was very smooth and drinkable, and at 6% its not really a slouch in the ABV department.","Destral","Apr 16, 2010"
3.82,4.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"D- It's very drinkable, but finishing one doesn't make me instinctively reach for another the way some other summer session beers might on a nice, warm spring day like this.","anchordrinker","Apr 15, 2010"
4.57,24.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Overall, I really dig this beer. Very well balanced and drinkable. I swear, one day I will find something on here to write a scathing review about.","KhourysBeerGuy","Apr 12, 2010"
3.32,-9.3,3.5,4,3,3.5,3,"As mentioned, I enjoy nearly everything Firestone puts out, but this beer misses the mark IMO and I'd say it just might be my least favorite of anything they've released. Maybe it will grow on me with time, but for now I'll be reaching for their other beers first.","JBogan","Apr 12, 2010"
3.08,-15.8,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"D: This could make a nice summer refresher, but it's not very complex and is really more like an American Wheat Beer than a Saison.","Halcyondays","Apr 11, 2010"
4.15,13.4,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Quite drinkable, the smoothness, sweet and sour dichotemy, and great fruity flavors in here make this an extremely enjoyable beer. It's got the base of a wheat beer but it's so much more at the same time. Whereas many wheat brews seem to require a slice of lemon or orange to make them drinkable this one stands all on its own and I think that's the way a beer should be broken into.","dwilson01","Apr 09, 2010"
3.98,8.7,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"D: Great replacement for Blue Moon-like beers in my fridge: Light, refreshing, and just way too easy to drink. Seems like it would pair very well a salad on a warm day.","JustinA1","Apr 07, 2010"
3.7,1.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability is OK. This is a sort of weird beer that doesn't really have a style. I would have preferred a saison and a wheat beer as separate beers.","Zorro","Apr 03, 2010"
3.97,8.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Nothing really speacial going on here, but I otherwise thoght this a nice enough beer.","John_M","Apr 03, 2010"
3.95,7.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Drinkability: I preferred the preliminary batch I tried about six weeks ago, which had a lot more funk and sourness than this version. However, Firestone is trying to woo Blue Moon and Shock Top drinkers, and I believe this will do just that. Solace is a very easy-drinking, balanced, wheat ale. I'll happily purchase a six pack or two. (4.5)","ThreeWiseMen","Apr 02, 2010"
