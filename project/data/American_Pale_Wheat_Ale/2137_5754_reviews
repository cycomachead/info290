"Another basic summer ale good for sumer time"
""
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 8/3/2014. Pours lightly hazy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, citrus peel, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon/orange zest, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good robustness and balance of pale malt, citrus peel, and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a very solid pale wheat ale style. All around good balance and robustness of pale malt, citrus peel, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."

"Back to the Breckenridge effort...I drank a beer."

"This is a good mellow summer beer, as you would expect.  Very easy to sip and before you know it you've probably had a few out on the patio.  A little bit fruity but not a typical summer wheat beer.  Solid."

"Mildly sour, some citrus notes.  Not overly hopped, no unpleasant aftertaste."

"Pours a light pale straw color with nice white head and great lacing. Nose of lemon, sweet caramel malts, and light bready goodness. Taste is sweet bready malts to the back and sides, light lemon zest and a hint of orange on the aftertaste. very nice. Where's my lawn mower???"

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Nice light hop flavor and malts to balance it. Perfect for the summer."

"Many others are better. Breckenridge has been lack luster."
""
""
""
""
" Overall a very solid 3.75 for SummerBright Ale from Breckenridge Brewery. If the aroma would've been slightly more potent, I think it would've earned a 4. It sure does the job of cooling you down& wetting your whistle. I may pick this brew up again."
""
""
""
"This is a nice summer beer (pretty sure it is not year-round). Not too high on the ABV, low on the hops, light body. The lemon and orange citrus is not overt. Has a nice wheatyness. Overall an enjoyable ale. Would be an ideal hot summer afternoon quencher. Highly sessionable."

"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of wheat, pale malt, hint of sweet malt, hint of yeast, and a hint of hop. Fits the style of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of wheat, pale malt, slight sweet malt, hint of hop, and a hint of yeast. Overall, decent appearance, aroma, and blend. The body strength is lacking."

"O: This won't take the place of any of my usual summer session beers but it's tasty and refreshing though simple"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: refreshing; I'm not usually a fan of summer or wheat beers; this is one of the ones I like; I think it's the touch of bitterness in the finish;"
""
""
""
""
"I was looking for something relatively light today and this fit the bill more or less – nothing to write home about or repeat."
""
""
""
""
"This is a pale yellow-gold color with a thin white head. The aroma has a subtle wheat scent, and the taste has a faint twang. No real hop presence, but there is a little fruit and a slight spice and flower note. Medium to light in mouthfeel. It's a reasonable summer brew. Nothing outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
"A beer with Summer written all over it, granted its in the name, this is a lager like experience. It's attributes are straight wheat bread, cracker and dough with a dry refreshing feel. This style is never overly diverse but this ale is strong in flavor and aroma. Very good hot weather quencher."
""
""
""
""
"O - easy summer sipper. Somewhere between shandy and wheat ale but leaning more to ale side."
""
""
""
"Just short of ""outstanding", this is still an excellent brew. Its clean and smooth, the color is true to the name, and the lemon peel gives it enough character to come back for more. I'd prefer the Summer Bright over a Leinenkugel any day."

"The taste has a grainy malt character up front but next to no wheat character. Biscuity and yeasty though. Crisp clean hop finale. Nothing special but generally easy to drink."

"D - fine. Will come back to this one I feel like its missing something."

"Pretty light tasting beer, might be a nice beer to have in the evening on a super hot summer night."

"Overall, a beer I'm not likely to have again. Too much lemonade and not enough hops or wheat. Sure it's refreshing as a drink, but ultimately fails to live up to the title of ""beer""."
"O: This is not my favorite beer but it is not a drain pour either. I guess that I'm more disappointed than anything in that I didn't notice any orange or lemon or anything citrusy. I am glad that I tried it, though. I don't think I will go to it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent beer – nothing would I grab again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- a fine summertime slammer, the lemon/orange citrus notes are pleasantly restrained."
""
"Overall: Great summer brew. Light and refreshing, but still has a bit of a kick to it coming from the hops. Nice citrus flavor that is not overbearing and is fulfilling. Pleasant aftertaste (of a wheat beer with hints of hops) and does not linger too long. Just enough to remind you to take another swig."

"Overall this is pretty disappointing for what it claims. No sense of orange. lemon, or barely and malt with a rank bouquet. I'll pass."
"OVERALL: A refreshing summer option. Has a good body, full on citrus and complimentary hoppy bitterness. I could see myself having a few of these at a BBQ."
""
""
"Poured into a Sam Adams glass with a nice full head developing which laced and lasted a short time. Appearance was golden, straw with a slight cloudy look. Aroma was very mild with hints of fruit and citrus. Tast was of mild citrus, fruit and some grain. Light mouthfeel and aftertaste."

"overall - not one to find it's way back to my frig."

"i think I probably like this one a little more than the masses here. fresh on tap its a really nice sessionable brew, and even though it snowed 6 inches last night, it brought me to summertime right away. it pours just slightly hazy, pale yellow in color, with an inch of short lived white head. the nose is fresh lemons and white wheat malt, a good combo for summer. there is also a brighter ale yeast that gives an interesting touch of spice, and a ton of carbonation, which contributes to a refreshing beer for summer. the lemon peel is strong in the flavor, not acidic, but tart for sure. it cuts some of the heavier wheat flavors, and leaves the brew with a zesty and clean finish. this isn't a particularly adventurous brew, but compared to some other breck seasonals, this one is a little more inspired, and one I may find myself enjoying quite a bit of as the warmer weather comes in. the body is light but the beers isn't watery. it also tastes a lot more fresh than breck beers usually do to me, not adjunct or preservative heavy, this is a more than adequate addition to the summer beer shelf."
""
"The Crack and inverted Glug produced a finger of rocky, bone-white head with moderate retention. Color was a hazy sunshine yellow. Nose had a citrusy smell like furniture polish, but not in a bad way. That is just what came to mind when I leaned into it. As the head fell, some nice lacing began to form. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium and the tangy citrus flavor was evident on the tongue, but it seemed kind of muted. Finish was semi-dry and citrusy, but I somehow felt like it lacked any real Ooomph. Oh well."

"Shit, with this pathetically mild Winter, Summer doesn't seem so far away... Anyway, this stuff pours a hazy straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises lemon peel, orange zest, light cracked wheat, and a touch of grass. The taste generally brings in more of the same, but now the lemon takes command (and in quite the funky style), and some mild cardboard buts its way in as well. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, though I can see people actually enjoying such a lemonade-y beer in the Summer months, this stuff just ain't my schtick. The lemon is too forward and slightly artificial-tasting and the cardboard element doesn't do anybody any favors."
"Overall uneventful."
""
""
"This beer pours nicely with a thick, bubbly white head. It's pale yellow in color and is slightly cloudy. It has the look of a solid wheat beer. Smells of sweet husky corn, wheat bread, strawberries, and bubblegum. First taste reveals mild wheat flavors with some lemony rinds and a little bit of grassy hops. Flavoring is light but that's what you'd expect from a summer ale like this. The beer goes down smoothly and is light and bubbly on the tongue, crisp. All in all a nice refreshing wheat beer that is light both in taste and body. For what it's trying to be it does the trick."

"Breckenridge SummerBright Ale is a sparkling, slightly hazy, bright yellow ale. There isn't really any head. It has an aroma of grain, lemon and alcohol. It's light bodied and watery. It leaves the mouth a little chalky. It tastes a little sour with a little citrus peel bitterness. The flavor of alcohol is quite dominant. I really don't have any purpose for this beer."
""
""

""
""
"O: Nothing special but a very easy to drink and very sessionable brew. Probably would be best to drink outside on a really hot day - could use a little more intensity in the flavor for my palate."

"O - Perhaps I am too harsh of this style, but I honestly cannot recommend this offering. I knew I shouldnt get one but I relented to a suggestion. Never again! Light bodied - check. Light flavored - check. Drink again - NOPE."
""
"Hazy straw gold with small head and no lace. Smells of lemon, fresh cut hay and light malt. Taste is perfecty metered doses of lemon zest and orange in a light biscuity malt. Moderately crisp, refreshing, wet. Not sweet. Finish is clean and light on the palate. Very good summer thirst quencher, the lemon and orange notes imparted are not overdone."
""
""
"Somewhat of a no frills summer brew, typical but it works. The lemon / orange twist does well here and is not overwhelming."
""
"O: Definitely one to skip this season -- there are many, many better summer ales out there. 4 average ratings says it all."
"O-this is a good summer beer. Very crisp and clean. It has a good lightness to it but lacks any hint to adjunct ingredients that I often find with summer beers. It's simple. I like it."

"O- This beer isn't good. It's plain and seems completely lacking in inspiration. That said, I didn't mind slowly finishing off the six pack, using these beers at the end of a long day to ease me into relaxation ... So they're good for that."
""
"Low C"

"O: This beer goes down very easily but could use stronger flavors to make it more exciting."

""
""
"Overall – A nice light god session beer for the summer months. It is perfect for sitting outside and enjoying in the presence of friends over a long evening. If looking for something intensely flavorful however this is a beer to avoid."
""
""
"Overall, this is a very fresh summer beer. Great for grilling, or sitting on the deck all night. Low ABV. I love it as my Summer go-to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OI: A good blonde ale with some interesting aromatic notes. Great representation of a style you'll typically find on tap at your local brewpub."
"This was pretty straightforward with its flavors and while fairly breezy and inoffensive on the palate, this wasn’t overly memorable either. I’d probably be hard pressed to remember anything about other than its easy drinkability if I hadn’t taken notes."
""
"While suitable for consumption, more likely to be intended to be consumed en masse by the masses. This one lacks the qualities I seek in a beer."

"Pours a cloudy golden amber color with a slight head that disappears quickly. Scent is mostly of wheat/straw and lemon zest. There is a decent taste of wheat, citrus that is crisp and refreshing, but has a very weak volume and texture. The texture feels like one of those beers that is lighter than water. This is basically a slightly stronger version on Bud Light Golden Wheat. Good on a hot day buy could really use some work."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Flavor is a bit flaccid, oxidized pilsner malt, crackers. A little bit of candy wafer sweetness... orange flavored, sure. Weak body, flabby and watery palate. Completely insipid. One and done, likely won't revisit. Seems this summer seasonal was on the tail end of it's life, much like the season itself is fleeting today."
"Refreshing on a hot summer day - nothing offensive. Not much more than a typical American Pale Wheat summer-type of ale but it has a nice touch of an orange and lemon peel character."
"Overall: An average summer beer in every sense of the word. Not a bad beer, but not one I will go out of my way for either."
"Don't drink and review."
"Last day of Labor Day weekend and I am trying a Breckenridge Summer Bright Ale. The appearance is a pale cloudy yellow with thin white head that appears to be lacing. The aroma is mostly lemon with a backdrop of malt and hop. The taste has the bitterness of lemon and the subtle spice of orange peel that make quite a refreshing beer. The mouthfeel is good, the low alcohol content make the beer very easy to drink on summer days. I would definitely recommend this one."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some citrus notes. Taste is refreshing, mild, some citrus and wheat is present. Feels light in the mouth and overall this is an easy drinking summer beer."
"D - light tasty refreshing would have another"
"Breckenridge has long been one of my least favorite Denver breweries. Now it's part of the Wynkoop group, so we'll see whether they can come up with some more interesting beers."
"D: A nice summer beer. Good balance of citrus peel impact & base wheat beer. Not too many dimensions, but what is there has great roundness & okay depth. Nicely pleasant & drinkable with a very adroit touch of character."
"Solid summer brew in a can."
"Overall, I'm glad I bought this beer while in the area. Not terribly unique, but a great summer libation that is plenty drinkable while still retaining my interest. Would buy again in the right season."
"D: Every summer I feel as though there are a million more of these damn beers, and I'm not going to say this is the worst. Hell, I'll drink it again if I'm offered. I'll just be sure there are some sausages or something nearby to blot out that aftertaste. Also: this is one beer that does not reward a pour into a glass, so keep it in the bottle."
"comes out an opaque yellow hue (the kind thats got a tiny amount of green in it). small head with minimal retention and no real lacing at all. hmm... giant aroma of wheat on this which is not surprising but it seems to be overshadowing everything else. grass is present. honey and clove are faint in the background and thats about all i can make out. now on to the taste mmm watered down tasting wheat ale. guess i can't say im too surprised. lemon zest wheat and a bit of a hop bite are there but its just all so distant and watery. lots of carbonation felt on this one. overall this thing is just not good enough. time to go back to the drawing board."
"This one arrived from the bartender with no head and a dark gold body. Grassy, wheat aroma with creamy, lemony odors and a hint of vanilla. Tastes of grass and grain accompanied by fresh lemon. Aftertaste is cream and grain. Great, unique flavor. Good one for a hot day."
"Pours a hazy straw color with a thin white head. Not much retention and just a bit of lacing. Aroma has very faint hints of Lemon, Orange and Wheat. Body is light and somewhat carbonated. Taste is of sweet tarts, and lemon. Bit of a tangy finish. Nothing exceptional, but ok for the Summer."
"I drank this quick - does that make this a good beer? I tend to drink water or Gatorade when I'm thirsty but that doesn't make them a gin and tonic in my eyes. Want a six-pack to chug that will make you look smarter than the average BMC drinker? Look no further. This goes for all of you who want to move on from Blue Moon and want to impress your friends. If I had more here, I'd probably crack 'em open and think about what could have been. Instead, I'm going to head outside and at least be grateful that I have beers like this to sample in the summer. I couldn't imagine when else I'd have one of these."
"O: Average best sums up this offering from start to finish. Won't turn you off but sure wont give you reason to repurchase, rather mundane, not for the discriminatory drinker."
"O: Really light; probably too light in my opinion. I get that it's a summer beer, but with a name like summerbright I would expect more of a ""wake up and enjoy the sun"" kick or flavor. I most likely won't have one of these again."
"Pours a pale yellow with a thin head that goes away quickly. Actually looks a bit like a macro lager. Not much on the aroma or palate. Bit of lemon and grain, a bit sour on the back end. I actually like the mouthfeel more than I thought I would given the quickly dissipating head, relatively creamy. Not my favorite summer seasonal, not even close, but given that it's 7:30pm and still 105 degrees here, this will do just fine."
"Thin bodied with a reasonable level of carbonation. Light pale ale malt flavors. Nearly no hop. A light wheat beer without the wheat. Sour finish, but it's short lived."
"Good choice for a day in the sun. I don't think I would want a whole case of the stuff but a couple would be just fine with me."
"Overall – A very easy drinking beer that I could definitely drink a whole bunch of. That being said it really inst anything exciting and I wouldn't seek it out again."
"The beer is rather bland... It is a step above a BMC lager, but not one I'll be buying for myself."
"O- Not a bad beer but the taste isnt what i expected. This would be a nice beer to give a whirl but wouldnt purchase a sixer of it."
"Overall: Slightly above average. Definitely nothing impressive here. Overpriced, not worth a try. Drink a Hoegaarden, you'll get a better Wheat Ale for about the same price."
"Overall: this beer leans a bit more fruit juice with a bit of carbonation. Tough to finish one bottle of this."
"D - Not bad at all, but nothing really special either. Good Spring brew to enjoy outside. I would certainly do another anytime."
"FAIR, NOTHING GREAT NOR AWFUL!"
"Pours out a golden yellow body with a large white head that maintains decent lacing and retention. Carbonation is also very good. I can smell some bread, orange peel and lemon. The taste has a wheat taste throughout that follows with some orange and finishes off with some lemon. This beer is a rather light bodied beer that feels very watery when drinking it and overall it is a decent tasting beer when in the mood for a summer ale, but should not be your first choice as there are some better American Pale Wheat Ale's out there."
"Overall, this beer is not that impressive. It's too light in both the body and the flavor. It drinks more like a light beer. It would be a descent beer to have on a hot day if it was available, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"Overall, just a simple, middle of the road beer. I wasn't expecting to be blown away, but still come away a little disappointed."
"Bottle. I gave the appearance a 3.5 without getting a clear look at it. Bouquet was average. The taste wasn't much better, with limited amounts of the lemon peel present. Mouthfeel was average too. Really a poor man's Oberon (although I don't know if it's actually less expensive)."
"D/O: Very crisp and drinkable with some good flavors that go well with summer. It could have some more flavor to go with the tartness."
"Not sure what I was expecting but this has got to be the heaviest wheat beer I've ever had, drinks more like an amber including the biscuit malty taste and has a surprising amount of body unlike some other Breckenridge offerings. Not exactly a light summer fare but I enjoyed it"
"Overall: Overall a decent beer. Probably good for a summer day. You could definitely kick back a few of these because of the good balance."
"D: Just kinda ""meh."" Not bad at all, but there's just way too much available to think about purchasing on it's own. Thankfully everything else in their sampler 12pk has been very good like I've come to expect from Breckenridge."
"I wasn't a big fan of this beer but it was ok. I purchased a single at a liquor store here... so it may have been old, but the date was not notched on the label. The color and clarity is what I expected with a slight haze. Not much head and very little lacing. A little bit of citrus flavor, but not the wheat flavor that I expected."
"This nice-looking cloudy golden ale pours with moderate lacing and a clean floral citrus scent. Crisp and malty-sweet flavor with a snappy hops backdrop, SummerBright is heavier than some, but fits the bill well for a tasty warm-weather treat. Not especially unique or memorable brew, but a worthy and tasty beer nonetheless."
"O- Good, nice and complex- just needs a little less syrupy sweetness."
"D - Will have to have this next year. It was still pretty good for a summer ale in the fall. OK beer!"
"It was ok, pretty typical summer beer."
"Just missed the Target for me."
"The 4.5% alcohol makes it easy to have a few, but I don't know who would want to. There's just not enough flavor to make it an enjoyable thirst quencher."
"The third of four of the sampler 12 pack didn't disappoint. None of these beers have been world class but all have been pretty good so far."
"Drinkability - This would be an easy beer to keep coming back to in terms of a cheaper party beer, but not really worth bragging about."
"Poured into a Portsmouth snifter, pours a huge head to the top of the glass. This dies very quickly, but leaves a pretty solid lacing around the rim of the glass. Color is very light orange, and a little cloudy looking. Smell is not all that great, a little citrus and some fresh hops, but not a whole lot else. Tastes a little bit better than the smell lends on, a little fresh crisp citrus hops and even a bit of a yeasty, malt backbone. still not a TON there, but i guess a solid, VERY simple beer. Mouthfeel is pretty light, but the aftertaste if decent which lends itself to good drinkability. Kind of a not-vey-exciting brew..."
"D: Very drinkable, especially on a hot summer day."
"D: To sour. not easy to drink. im not going to buy this one again."
"[Drinkability]: It's drinkable, but not much character."
"Overall - $10.99 for a six pack is just stupid. If this beer sold for $6.99 a six I would buy it again and drink it cold, VERY COLD. But at $11 its just too much for a below average brew."
"D - A refreshing summer beer that's crisp and easy drinking but doesn't offer much to the drinker as far as taste goes. Still, it'll get the job done on a hot summer day."
"Beer pours slightly cloudy yellow. A head soon dwindles down to almost nothing. For smell, I'm picking up mostly a bit of malts, citrus zest, and alcohol solution. Taste is acidic and a bit garbage-y on the back end. I guess there's malt present, but not enough to cut through the spice. Feel is odd and bubbly, and finishes sticky and sour. Not a fan."
"D- Low, who the hell tested this and okayed it for production? Back to the drawing board with this. Better yet, take the whole brewery back to square one. These guys can't seem to make a hit. Not disappointing, because I never expect much from Breckenridge; just another poor stab at ""good"" beer."
"Pours a rather typical clear straw yellow with a thick but not persistent white head. Aroma is fairly strong, crisp and malty with a yeasty undertone. Flavor is about average, malty and slightly fruity but nothing special. Texture is smooth, a little tingly and a tiny bit on the watery side. Still, it was a nice bit of sunshine on a nasty rainy day."
"Drinkability - 2.5/5.0 - Would have again, if it was hot, but not enough flavor make this a go-to beer"
"Really found nothing to like about this one. Nothing in the nose, mouthfeel was watery and the taste and finish were both slightly skunked and watery. Haven't been overwhelmed by any beers from this brewery (though the Pale Ale was decent, especially when enjoyed sitting outside the brewpub). However, this is even a low point for their standards."
"D: I keep trying to get into this style, but have yet to meet a APWA that has any wow factor. This one doesn't have it either. On the plus side, the light body and low ABV make it easy to session."
"I was a little surprised by this one and somewhat disappointed."
"D: Very light and easy-drinking. Not to be critical, but could have been a bit bigger and bitterer - more carbonation might be added to the balance."
"D: The light characteristics of this beer coupled with the smooth mouthfeel make it very drinkable. A good session beer at a bar I would say. Not my favorite wheat beer by far, but not something I would shy away from either."
"D - Not what I would crave on a hot summer day, but not something I would pour down the sink. My other choice was a Sam Adam's Blackberry Wit and I think I would rather have another of these, but just barely."
"D. OK. I thought this was a pretty easy drinker, have it with some hot wings it will wash away the burn."
"Taste is a rather dull, earthy wheat flavor with some hay-like hop bitterness. Does not finish as crisp and snappy as many American wheats I have had. It does have a different twist on the style as I am tasting more orange and tropical fruit flavors rather than the usual lemon peel and freshly mowed grass. It's ok, and a pretty good thirst quencher, but not one that I crave more than one or two of."
"Pours pale golden with white head that doesn't last long. Nose has light citrus, especially lemon, and some cereal grain malt. Palate is lemon-herbal in the hop side of things, with light malt, light bodied, and rather refreshing - good drinkability."
"More that a macro but not much."
" Re-review 5-14-11: Scored a fresh bottle and flavor was much better. Taste-Wheat,lemon zest, orange peel. Light and refreshing. Nice warm weather brew. Could drink all day in hot weather. Certainly better than my previous review if fresh. (B-) Cheers!"
"Smooth beer, easy drinking okay, but not great."
"so so."
"It was drinkable in a boring macro sort of way. Would not search out or buy again."
"D - OK I guess. Not very exciting, but drinkable."
"Pours a clean yellow-ish color with a white head. In the aroma, saaz hops, very pils like. In the taste, small saaz hops, again very pils like. A small bite and a light mouthfeel, with a semi dry pils like aftertaste. Very pils like for a pale wheat."
"Unimpressive. Don't think I'll try this one again for a couple seasons."
"Pulled from the variety pack. As expected with most Summer beers, this one is built for hot weather, easy consuption, and mass-markets. On a hot summer night at a neighbor's birthday party, it fits the bill pretty well. Starts with a pilsner-like, straw color with a mild haze. Spritzy carbonation forms a dainty head that shows modest staying power with some lacing. Aromas are bready, spicy, yeasty, grassy, and with an evident wheat aroma. Pretty well balanced, but does show some raw grain characteristics. Flavors intensify with the raw grain taste, especially the wheat, while giving a spicy, bready, lemony taste. White pepper, clove, and citrus notes round out the spiciness. Texture is a little thin for wheat-based beers, but lighten considerable for ease of consumption, albeit dumbing down in the process. Finishes with a bready / yeasty, lemon note. It's an ok beer for an ok style, but the Agave Wheat is a much better base beer with better character."
"nice crisp refreshing beer perfect for the summertime"
"M/D: Has a long lasting slimy feel and an instant watery feel. The drinkability is ok if you are interested in drinking a beer without character but please realize that this is only my opinion and you should definitely try it for yourself."
"Medium golden body topped with a finger of bone white froth, with no duration or lacing evident. Sour aroma, heavy on the malt. Sour taste mixes with decent malt flavor--some caramel, some citrus, a grassy taste--yet nothing is especially impressive, about the taste or this beer as a whole. Smooth if somewhat flat mouthfeel mitigates things somewhat, as does the fact that the pint glass was empty in about ten minutes. Yet this isn't a great beer, fairly pedestrian like most of the wares I've had from Breckenridge, and among summer beers generally. In fact, after this bottled mediocrity, I have to say that the summer style, be it kolsch or the American Pale Wheat Ale that Breckenridge terms this, is easily one of my least favorite beer styles. Too light, not enough body, lacking complexity--what's to like?"
"Worth a shot"
"Taste is very subtle with some crispness to it. Light in body with higher carbonation. Not a whole lot going on. A slightly disappointing beer as Breckenridge makes some good stuff in their 471 line of beers."
"Summer Bright is not very good. Will not try again."
"D-Just not a very good beer. I barely finished this one."
"This beer is not a bad beer but does not exactly pull off the category it is going for. While the appearance is a filtered pale golden color, the light 1 finger head does not last long and there is only light to moderate lacing. The smell is not really on par with a wheat, containing no smells of citrus or banana/clove. Instead there is a smell of rubbery sourdough and hop undertones. The taste is unique but does not fit this category either, starting with a high bitter start with hints of sweet malt, wheat, and a crisp hop finish. The sourdough taste overpowers most of the characteristics of a wheat beer but they do fade as it warms and surprisingly show a little more wheat flavor. I did however enjoy the hop finish after the wheat taste. Light mouthfeek with relatively moderate-high carbonation. Overall this is a drinkable beer that quenches thirst and has low % but does not fit the right style."
"A bit with not much personality to it. Though, it might make a good beer for the long hot summer months."
"It's not going to amaze anyone, but it's good for what it's supposed to be."
"Light refreshing beer. It's best quality is its mouthfeel, which is very good."
"pours a pale, slightly cloudy yellowish color with a big white foamy head. smell is decent, has a nice mild hop note, with a nice spicy aroma as well. the taste is good, easy drinking, flavorful with hints of orange, coriander, and slight hops. mouthfeel is decent, drinkability is high, good tasting, smooth beer."
"Drinkability: Ideal for light drinking, it aspires to little more. Leaves me yearning for an Oberon, though!"
"A macroish yellow color with a white head that is gone in a few minutes. Lots of bubbles. Smell is a mixture of wheat and grainy mat. Possibly some musky hops. The flavor is no better. Where is the wheat? Not the ingredient structure I like to see in these beers. A decent medium body with heavy carbonation. Fairly drinkable. Not very good, but nothing bitter or off."
"D - Good for a summer day, but not a favorite."
"Blandish summer beer, though I guess it'd probably be refreshing in some circumstances."
"Upon the pour the color is a translucent gold, the head bright white and creamy, about three fingers in size, it depletes quickly leaving a velum like seal on the glass. Nose is sweet and fresh, bread dough, with a hint of orange peel, pleasant an appetizing. Start has a decent grain presence, with a touch of bitterness at the back, top is light to medium in feel. Finish has a diminutive acidity, the hops noticeable, very dry aftertaste, and a nice beer for the Arizona summers."
"D - An average summer beer, easty to drink, but not much to it. I could take it or leave it, just a basic lawnmower ale."
"Pours a hazy pale white gold color. It has a wheat fragrance and faint citrus aromas and faint fruit and wheat flavors. It also has a crisp citrus bite that has a small offness, and a slightly watery mouthfeel. However, it does finish surprisingly clean. Its a good beer, but there are certainly better wheat beers out there."
"I can drink this all day, just like... ...beer... ...not sure I want to, it is a bit bland for my tastes, kind of like ....beer... It would be good for anybody who is afraid to step into a beer with flavor, but want to experiment with something that is not mass produced."
"Pours a golden color from the bottle and starts off with small amount of white head, and leaves hardly any remaining lacing. Smell is of some wheat and a tiny bit of hops. Not a great amount of aroma, but its ok. Taste is not much to it either a little hops and malt with a good balance but it still could have used more. High carbonation on this beer making it a good crisp summer beer, but not amazing."
"Drinkability - Excelent quaff for the summer. A little light on taste, but nicely refreshing on a hot day. A little more hopping would have helped this ale immeasurably."
"meh..even for a pale wheat, this is weak & forgettable."
"Tastes wet sweet with strong carbonation. Wheat gluten comes across pastey due to the low intensity of other malt flavors. carbonation cleans the palette without any acrid sting. The beer could be sticky if not for the carb. Mild oranges could be from the hops, but they have an estery quality about them. More hop flavored (md) than bitter (low). Thicker mouthfeel seems to come from protein and dextrins. Hops are light floral and honey-like. The thickness sticks and just doesn't fit in a summer quencher, IMO."
"Pours a pleasant enough clear, light golden color. Topped by a thin layer of fine, white head that quickly falls away into a collar with only slight cling. Nose consists of ho-hum dry grains, light hops, and a hint of ripe fruit. The taste has the same components and is no more interesting than the smell, with grains being the dominant component. Mouthfeel is light with a lasting dry crispness. In sum, OK."
"First Breckenridge beer and not off to a good start. When I first opened the bottle I was thoroghly impressed, it had a great smell I thought, smelled hoppy. After pouring to pint glass smell was a little different, not as hoppy and a bit sour. Straw yellow color and very little head. Taste was a let down, I dont know how to say it other than what everyone else said, there just wasnt much to it. Some citrus accents and some bitterness but not much else, not a great aftertaste either. Carbonation was good, and it is drinkable but thats due to the light mouthfeel and lack of taste. Thirst quencher but not a beer to be sought after."
"Pale yellow color. Head drops to nothing before you can blink. Thin fizzy white cap and no lace. Dosn't look too exciting. Smell is grainy with maybe a faint lemon. Taste is also lightly grainy but that is even a bit of a stretch, there just isn't much to this one. Watery mouthfeel. I guess it's drinkable in the sense that it's light and not filling at all but boy is it boring. I won't be back for this one and don't really have any urge to try breckenridge's other offering."
"This is a very drinkable summer beer. Although I like the Christmas beer better, I could easily drain a six pack on a hot summer day."
"Overall, this one packs little punch in the flavor area. But then, that may be just what is desired in this type of beer. Not top notch, ""gotta have it"" stuff, but nice nonetheless. I'll have more before the leaves change."
"Nice clear bubbly brew. It reminded me of some Belgian clear wheat beers. It was flavorful and easy to drink. Even though there was a fair amount of carbonation, it wasn't overpowering. This is most definitely a filtered wheat, not my normal summer wheat but still refreshing."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a crystal clear medium straw color. Barely any head is poured (glass may be slightly dirty), with just a small covering of white bubbles. Aroma is full of the light hay like malts, very wheaty with no typical banana or clove. It has a slight hop note, very saaz like, almost pilsener in aroma. On the palate, it is very biscuity, with the wheat dominating. There's a bit of a vegetal DMS like flavor, not very pleasant, but it is otherwise unoffending. That is, of course, not a glaring statement about the beer; it is drinkable, but til the end of the bottle."
"12oz brown bottle with no freshness date. Pours a crystal clear pale straw yellow with a quickly fading 1 finger head, but decent lace. Mellow aromas of wheat malt with a slight hop floralness. Nice wheat malt flavors, more than expected as the color is so pale. Lite yet full of flavor. A great summertime beer."
"Very easy drinking, but then, who would want to. This is just not interesting enough to want much of it."
"D - This was an okay beer. There was nothing particularly significant about the flavor."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, no date. Color is straw yellow and clear. Decent head that lingers around the edges to provide some lacing but otherwise fades. Smell is slightly of white grape, very similar to a white wine. Did not expect that. Taste is of the same, very suprising. Wasn't sure about it at first, but after drinking most of the bottle I'm pretty sure that this tastes very much of a white wine. Not a bad thing, just different, but I like it. Mouthfeel isn't the greatest because of the slight tinge that comes with the white wine taste. Pretty decent drinkability though. Would consider buying again, for sure."
"I did my fair share to finish off the six-pack and it is an easy beer to drink with some taste, but overall I was a bit disappointed as I was expecting a bit more from this brewery. I would recommend this beer to someone interested in vearing from the mainstream as a starter, but I think that I will personally try another one of their offerings first before coming back to this one."
"That said, this is very easy to drink, provided you enjoy the lemony character."
"It's extremly light bodied. It demonstrates very little complexity, but it is bright and vibrant and shows some action on the tongue, with a subtle berry finish. Very drinkable, just not all that intersting. But, it is a summer beer, and works well as that, on a hot day or with spicy food."
"Easy to drink, definitely a summer drinker."
"Pours a clear golden color with little to no head and no lacing. Aroma is bready/yeasty. Taste is very bready malts with little to no wheat and no distinguishable citrus. Taste is similar to Budweiser. Mouthfeel is fine for the style and it's relatively drinkable as a lawnmower beer. Unremarkable."
"A 12oz bottle I picked up at Three Cellars in S. Milwaukee."
"Couldn't finish. Drainpour. I hope I just got a bad bottle."
"Drinkable yes, but with so many other choices why would you."
"Over all and okay beer. I had this last week definitely not an October beer.I have had a few decent beers from the Breckenridge brewery, my favorite being the Avalanche ale but this one let me down a bit. Still I will probably buy it again in the summer."
"Summer Bright Ale was a hazy pale golden color with a white head. The head was small and quickly dissipated to a thin layer, leaving very little lace behind. The aroma was light malt and some citrus (lemons). The taste was crisp with lemon again. It was light bodied with plenty of carbonation. It's a refreshing summer beer."
"Bright and light yellow in color with a tiny yet noticeable white head. A large and citrus like aroma that keeps to form. Sweet and grainy malts through and through; tender wheat malts characteristics combined with some lemony citrus offerings. Mildly, yet perfectly carbonated. Come-and-go flavorings, very refreshing and mild. Simple to drink, nothing wrong here."
"I'd have to say it wasn't very remarkable at all."
"We started lightest to darkest. Maybe not the best way, especially with a DIPA in the middle - but it worked out. This was a citrus wheat, quite light in color and taste. It was easy-drinking and quite refreshing. I'm sure this sells well with the recent boom in popularity of the hefes and such. I enjoyed it enough, but I kept looking forward to the bigger ales."
"Overall, a beer that reaches its quaffing goal, nothing more."
"Dnot a bad summer brew. Ill enjoy the six pack that I have, but probably wont buy it again"
"Pale, hazy piss yellow color. Thin off white head. Bubbly lace. Nice aroma. Tangy wheat. Zesty lemon. And grainy, sweet malts. Refreshing citrus bite. Slightly dry finish. A bit of a hoppiness. Lemony and crisp. Brightly carbonated. Decent enough summer quaffer."
"Poured from the bottle, this summer ale had a clear golden appearance with a small, light head, that did not retain that well. There was decent carbonation. The smell was somewhat malty, with some mild floral scents. The beer went down smooth, but taste was not too distinct, again seemed dominated by malt."
"Drinks really easy, if off style. One of the better Breckenridge seasonals"
"Moderately cloudy golden bronze color with a smallish fizzy white head that dwindles. Lacing is weaker but there. Aroma is of dry grains with a bit of toastiness and an earthy component. Taste is dominant on the malty side but not really too sweet. It's more robust in mouthfeel but still decently smooth. Not a whole lot really going on however. Light citrus flavors seem to want to come out but never truly show themselves. There's just lots of nondescript toasty malty flavors with a dry edge to them. It's a decent choice for the summertime but with Oberon, Zoomer, Whitsun, Celis, etc., I don't think I would choose this again."
"Very light and moderately drinkable if only because it isn't offensive. I've enjoyed several of Breckenridge's offerings since they were introduced to Michigan awhile back, but this is nothing that hasn't been done better by someone else."
"Into a pint glass, pours a pale golden yellow, not too much head, less lacing. Aroma is has a little honey sweetness, but also a sour funk, like sweaty socks. And its not because its an out of date beer. A medium body with springy carbonation, with lemon and melon tones in there, but finishes a little dry but kind of pasty too. Overall, decent, but not faving another any time soon."
"Take a pass on this one."
"Standard gold-yellow, clear, sparkly. Vigorous pour yields a smallish, short-lived, off-white head. Honeyish, soft, grainy malt. Lemon zest. Light coriander/pepper. Muted, pita bread malt with some wheat twang. Slightly tart to lemony bite lead to modest bitterness. Finish is grainy, citrusy and slightly astringent. Light-medium bodied with a minor proteiny feel. Meh, not my idea of a good summer beer."
"Drinkability- Very good, I could have copius amounts of this, doesn't have the lack luster flavor and wateryness of the big name American Macro lagers, but uneventful enough to receive praise."
"Same aromas come through in the flavor. Not overly complex, this one is a simple wheat base with a little bit of citrus in there to sort of mix things up. The light mouthfeel and crispness make combine to make this more of a ""lawnmower"" brew. Not offensive, just uncomplex. You could still have several of these while the Broncos beat up on the Colts preseason."
"Drinkability is right on par with the other qualities. Nothing stellar here. It is close to good, but not quite there."
"The aroma was simply non-existant, I couldn't smell a thing! Nothing remarkable with mouthfeel or appearance. Wheat, a bit of maltiness, a bit of citrus (orange?), but all in all not a whole lot going on. A good hot day, drink-a-lot beer, I don't know that I'd buy it again...well, maybe only one more time...."
"I picked this one up at a Famous Daves due to there lack of a decent selection at that specific store. It poured a slightly cloudy golden color with a small white head. It tasted acidic and hints of wheat, hops and lemon were present. While I found this beer enjoyable it was average all around."
"Tangy raw grain aromas. Blond color. Balanced flavors are subtle. Lemon cookie flavors finish dry and watery. Pleasant buttered, toasted white bread flavors join in. Overall this is a juicy, easy beer suitable for thirst quenching. The thin texture seems out of proportion to the fruit and crust flavors. Nothing complicated. Nothing epic."
"Light, even for a summer brew, mouthfeel. Drinkable, but sooo boring."
"Kind of an indescript and average beer. Slightly hazed gold color, nice head. Light grass in the nose, not very assertive or strong. Taste is sharp and clean, but not very strong in the classic wheat ale sense. Pretty good drinkability, but not very spot on for the style. Good mouthfeel, also."
"This is a great hot weather quencher. It's 90+ here today, and this was just what the doctor ordered! More please."
"Clear bright gold color, little foam or lacing, difficult to detect aroma, some wheat and malt in initial taste  sweet lemon peel flavor that refreshes but is not a good wheat beer, or a good beer period, for that matter. This is a BORING beer  try Widmer Bros. Hefe  it is twice as good."
"This if nothing I'd strongly recommend, but it'd do well enough (a better than a macro) for a summer mid-afternoon drink."
"just noticed it says ""an ale for the summer season"" on the bottle...hence the ""Summerbright"" name I guess....for once their marketing line matches the way it tastes...would be a good crossover beer for someone"
"The beer pours a translucent gold color with a 1/4"" white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a very dry pale wheat and pale malt scent. It has a musty odor with hints of lemon zest. The taste is average as well. It has a bland and musty flavor that goes down slow and resonates. It has a dry finish and a slight wheat aftertaste. This may be the worst summer seasonal I've had. The mouthfeel is awful. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a forgettable beer. It needs less body, more carbonation, and some lemon zest. This is a terrible wheat beer."
"On tap at Old Chicago as part of Spring mini tour. Pours a clear golden color. Aroma is mostly wheat, with some light spice as well. Taste is wheaty, with a bit of lemon flavor, and a fairly bitter aftertaste. Not a bad beer for the summer season, but certainly not the best one available either."
"Clear-as-a-bell light gold appearance with a frothy head that's down to a skim in half a minute. Laces in mostly small dots. Honeyish aroma, hints of hay and wild yeast. Light mouthfeel, carbonation is relatively subdued. Standard malt offering, a bit of brown sugar sweetness and a vague citrus tang that's mostly a memory at a pretty thin close. Some tea-like qualities late in the profile, low hop impression and esters are small and masked by sweetness. Somewhat metallic all the way around, but I guess it should be a little better drinker in the hot weather."
"Light and crisp, a nice hot weather beer, went down well after a long walk on an unseasonably warm early September day."
"Hazy golden color with a small white head that quickly fades, there is absolutely no lacing, looks almost flat. Has a light grainy stale bread aroma, mild citrus flavor. Light bodied with a slick mouthfeel, some lemon flavor in its strange aftertaste, not much going on here."
"Breckenridge Summer Bright Ale is just okay... but then that's how most American pale wheats strike me. There's bound to be something better on the shelves, no matter how small the selection."
"Thanks to Bruiser81 for the chance to try it out."
"This beer is a pale gold color, slightly hazy, with a tiny white head that took off in a hurry. The scent is a grainy, slightly fruity smell. The taste has some grainy, lemony notes going on. Hops are barely detectable. Feel is slightly acidic on the tounge. This isnt a bad beer, and i think it is what it is: a light beer to be enjoyed in the heat of the summer. Ive had worse."
"This is BEER? Let alone, ALE??? I desparately tried to find something in terms of flavor, even just taste, but to no avail. I really could have been fooled into thinking I was drinking water. The color is very light and has a thiness to it. It didn't smell bad, just not like anything special. It's very drinkable because it is so non-assertive, but it is inoffensive so I could probably down a few of these after yardwork. Again, there is nothing ""bad"" about this beer other than its overwhelming nothingness. And what is more overwhelming is the taste of water from start to very, very bland finish. If it is offered to you, take it. If you have to spend money on it, just keep on moving down the beer aisle!"
"a summer afternoon heat of the day slammer. very light and refreshing, yet with some sweet summer flavor to satisfy. a definite summer only brew for me, otherwise it's forgettable. worth a try in july."
"This wheat ale pours a bit hazy with a light golden color and a gentle lace.  The aroma is malty with a prominent bisuity characteristic.  Sweet malt is immediately apparent in the flavor as is a very tiny hint of yeast.  The lighter bitterness is lingering, but overall it is too little too late.  Disappointing brew from the bottle."
