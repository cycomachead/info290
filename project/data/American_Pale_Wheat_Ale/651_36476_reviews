"Lots of prickly Brett character in the nose; hay and cracked pepper with a touch of funk. Kind of a one dimensional Brett showcase on the palate as well. Heavy horse blanket, clove, and pepper all but overwhelmed the light pear flavor. I couldn't find any hop or wheat characteristics. The mouthfeel was light and airy while at the same time stinging the tongue in a a good way. I liked this well enough overall, but I'm glad I split this one."

"I've had this a number of times and each batch is a little different. Pour is a hazy gold though it gets much more hazy as you get towards the bottom of the bottle. This beer has the characteristics of a brett fermented beer and it has developed nicely at approximately 9 mo to 1 yr of age. It has a bright yeasty fruitiness (apple and white grape with a touch of citrus) with some white pepper and a touch of tartness. There is a barnyard funkiness that keeps things interesting. There is a bit of sweetness and alcohol presence that moderates some of the refreshing aspects. Pleasantly effervescent. Overall, an enjoyable and nicely executed beer with brett yeast that develops with a little bit of age."

"Had this beer as part of a night of beer tasting. 750ml bottle E!047 batch. Claims to be a Belgian American Ale. Using French and American Malts, US Hops but with the kicker being Belgian, English and wild Yeast. This is ever so appearant when poured into a glass. Inches of foam appear unlike any American beer I have had. It paralells Duvel or a Belgian Quad with the amount of foam that lingers after the pour. Way more foam than actual liquid; which is something I happen to admire in a beer. The liquid hangs there as hazy unfiltered golden color. Herbal and fruit but definite unfiltered wheat characteristics."

"750 ml bottle, Batch E!043. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a hazy gold color with at least a couple inch frothy off-white head that stayed around for a very long time. There's also a lot of lacing. The brew smells like bready/wheat malt, lemon peel, floral hops, apples, and some grassiness. It tastes like bready/wheat malt, lemon peel, apricots, grass/hay and some light clove and peppery spice. I like the tartness in this brew, I didn't really expect that so it was a nice surprise. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and is well carbonated. I think this is good , I'd certainly like to try White Gold again in the future. $9.99 a bottle."

"a medium body beer with a decent amount of carbonation. this is a fantastic beer, and i am honestly shocked at the rating on it.. it's not even a 4? really... this is almost a 5 in my book, and this is coming from a dude who's had a LOT of beers."
"One of Ithaca's better new offerings. Loved it."
""
"Third glass - all the wheat sediment is here obviously. Very, very cloudy and much more spicy. All black pepper and lemon now. Very much Belgian wheat now. Probably the least interesting glass of the bottle, which is for the best since I would have cried when I finished it otherwise."
""
""
"O- A very tasty beer, easy to drink but with delicious, complex flavors. I was pleasantly surprised by this."

"This beer pours perfectly. Straw color, lemon yellow, sun kissed gold with a white head of foam that fell fast to a thick cap. Great lace. It had a bouquet that filled the nose. Traditional Belgian nose. Yeasty, barnyard, horse blanket, musty, pepper, and ripe fruit. Apples and white grapes with a touch of lemon, & caramel malt. What was missing, if you want to think that it was missing, was bubblegum and banana. No alcohol on the palate either. This drank well. it was dry, crisp and the ripe fruit washed over the palate juicy and a little tart. It drank like dry white wine. Earthy and bright. The malt stood up in the glass and was not weak. The beer had a fine balance. Prickly carbonation so it wasn’t soft but the mouthfeel was pretty good. It’s traditional Belgian. Refreshing and lively."

"Overall, this does taste like a Belgian beer and a refreshing wheat beer mixed together! This is a little too sour to be what I want on a hot day, but real good regardless!"
"White Gold is a nice addition to the Excelsior Series. It’s a tasty beer that definitely has more depth and character than you might expect. I wouldn’t fewer bubbles, but that’s my only small complaint. Good stuff. Definitely recommended."

"This is one of the more complex and flavorful wheat ales I've ever had. The use of three different yeasts really imparts some tremendous spice. There is a noticeable hop character that is very complementary. I really very glad I got to try this one. If I could get Ithaca in NC, I would definitely get another bottle of this."
"A bright beer with a certain funk that is intriguing. Zippy and smooth at the same time, which is a nice surprise."

"O- an enjoyable cross between a Belgian style and wheat ale. Glad I have another one down stairs"

"Overall, a pretty nice refreshing and easy drinking beer. However, I was hoping for better when I read the description on the bottle."

"Postscript 12/8/2012: Back at Sapsuckers once again, I'm happy to note that the IWG is still on tap and as tasty as 10 days ago."

"On tap. Pours a translucent amber color with a half inch of head. Good amount of lacing. Aromas of bread, orange peel, lemon, and bitterness. Hard to pick up on too much since the smell is pretty faint. Taste is of orange peel, lemon, apple, bread and some hop bitterness. Bitter orange and lemon peel finish. Medium bodied with a nice mouthfeel. Good alcohol presence. This is a style I'm luke warm on, but this is a solid Wheat. Overall, worth having again for certain."

"If it wasn't for the noticeable alcohol this would be alot like a belgian triple with wheat. An enjoyable beer only slightly overpriced."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, batch E!015(says copyright 2008 on the bottle). Pours hazy golden amber color with a fairly dense 2-3 finger white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some slight spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big grape, lemon, apricot, earth, tart apple, herbal, wheat, bread, hay, and funk. Some pretty nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of grape, lemon, apricot, apple, herbal, coriander, earth, funk, grass, and hay. Lingering notes of grape, lemon, apricot, grass, hay, and herbal on the finish for a while. A lot of malty flavors with good complexity; and no cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed at all on the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial wheat ale. Nice complexity and flavor balance; and extremely smooth to sip on. This has held up well for the age. Really enjoyable stuff."
"O - A nice blend of numerous beer styles, and it's always nice when Ithaca does a Brett beer."
""
"Bottle: Poured a dirty pale yellow color ale with a super huge foamy head with perfect retention and loads of lacing. Aroma consists of Brett and light sour notes with light dry floral ester. Taste is a complex mix between some nice wheat malt with loads of floral notes and some sour and light funky yeast from the Brett yeast strain. Body is quite full with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. This really hits a bunch of stuff I like in beers, i.e. wheat malt, dry hoppy notes and Brett. I would love to have access tot his on a regular basis."
""
""
"D: Eclectic blend of style components is what this one is, but it all blends super well and is very appealing. Franco-Belgian-American-wit-wild-triple-saison-BPA-APA-APWA. . . . WTF, this is just nice stuff."

"Drink- Many things going on in this glass and I really enjoyed it. Yeasty, funky, fruity and floral. I would love another bottle."

"[88/100]"

"Overall - A quality beer that is well worth its price. Ithaca makes some fantastic beers and I'm happy I gave this one a try. The alcohol was well hidden and 750ml was the perfect amount for me."

"Unsuspecting fans of the old White Gold are in for a surprise and maybe a bit of disappointment. Still a tasty beer, but very very different."
""
""
""
""
"When I bought this I wasn't paying attention that it was going to be a sour ale. The beer poured out as a hazy yellowish gold color with a large fizzy white head on top. The smell of the beer had lots of wild yeast sour notes on the nose. I wasn't able to even get much besides that from the beer. The taste of it was also quite sour and really killed off any of the soft wheat flavors that might have been in there before the wild yeast was tossed in. The mouthfeel was a little like champagne, very bubbly and fizzed up inside the mouth. Overall this beer wasn't all that impressive to me. Had I read the label more or something I may not have even bought it."
""
"Thin bodied with lower carbonation and a semi dry finish. I would offer this beer to many wine enthusiasts I know and expect that there would be a significant appreciation for the beer. A wonderful, insghtful and innovative beer for the US."
""
"This beer is surprisingly great."

""
"I'm going to go out on a limb here and say this is amazing. Hazy golden with a white head that fades to a collar. Yes, I smell wheat, and I spy esters and phenols, but what blows me away is how much this reminds me of pineapple upside-down cake. To me, nose is straight pineapple upside-down cake sprinkled with powdered sugar and topped with preserved lemons. If pineapple upside-down cake could drink dry with a hint of wet rock minerality, a touch of lemony goodness, and a hint of earthy funk, then this is what it would taste like. Medium body that translates light and fluffy with near perfect carbonation that leaves a pleasant prickly sensation and dry dry finish. Awesome."
""
""
""
""
""

""
"M: Plenty of Belgian IPA, a mixture of yeast sweetness, and big hops. The funk that exists does so only near the end of each sip, a pleasant departure. The hoppiness feels heavy, making sharing a must."

"O - Wow, I know Ithaca makes good beer but my goodness this was a treat. Would love to get my hand on a bottle of this!"
"O- I can't wait to try a bottle of this after a couple years in my cellar! This is not a style that I would usually rate this high, but this is fabulous! So damn much going on here. I will most certainly be grabbing a few more of these and spacing out the tasting times!"
"Overall, a nice beer. I think of fantome when I drink this, but its not near the quality/complexity that it has. A nice mellow night beer, good with Opeth's Heritage album."
"Overall, this is a really well crafted beer, and as I mentioned, like absolutely nothing else in this category that I've tried... I'd almost consider this an American Wild Ale, and try to match it up against some of those great ones."
"O: really enjoy this brew, smooth, complex, nicely drinkable and yet feels very classy, loved it"
"As much as I like the banana-cloviness of a good wheat beer, I enjoyed this stab at the style because it was *not* a banana-clovey wheat beer. The amount of horse-stall funk in the bottle may turn away some wheat fans, but it's not overpowering. After all, who doesn't like a little manure in his beer? Nice color, light aroma and light body; easy to drink and has a sharp bite with a bubbly edge. Despite the high (for a wheat beer) ABV, this doesn't generate much heat or wobble. It went well with a giant bowl of popcorn and a re-viewing of ""Dog Day Afternoon."""
"Light medium body, high carbonation, dry and bubbly on the tongue. Drinks nice and easy despite the higher ABV, which is masked incredibly well. Too bad the bottle gushed all over the place."
"Great beer from IBC, worth the money."
"O-Yet another great beer from IBC. Wasn't expecting the mild tartness but it was a pleasent suprise and twist on the American Pale Wheat Ale"
"In short, each sip makes me want another even more. Well done, Ithaca, well done."
"Overall, this is a beer designed to appease lovers of white sparkling wines. The fruits, acids, tanins, and pepper character play in a more wine-like proportion than of beer. But this is a beer, and a wonderfully crafted one at that. Only the medicial phenolic character offer a distracting flavor and aroma that I can't ignore."
"Pretty decent all up. Smooth and drinkable, but with plenty of character. Not on par with the awesomeness of Flower Power, but another very solid brew from Ithaca."
"The beer appears hazy and yellow with a substantial white head. The aroma brings citrus, hay, yeast. Nice flavor and well balanced. A hint of brett funk, but only a subtle glimpse of wild yeast. Plenty of citrus flavor. Wheat malt makes for a smooth feel. Hops are present throughout, with lasting presence in the finish. An enjoyable beer, I would have this again."
"O - If you can get past the odd souring white wine flavor, it is not too bad. I would suggest using a different blend of 'wild' yeast, as the current ones aren't cutting it."
"The CPJ"
"Pours a cloudy, golden body with 3 fingers of egg white head falls to a cap that lingers throughout consumption. Nose is mostly grass and other earth tones, as well as tart citrus (lemon). Lots of tart lemon, grass, wheat malt, Belgian yeast, even a little funk to this offering. Big and bold for a Pale Wheat Ale, and also fairly dry. Lighter bodied and a nice dose of carbonation gives a solid mouthfeel. An overall refreshing offering from Ithaca."
"This beer pours a full bodied dull golden in color with a two finger bright white head. This has got to be the thickest wheat beer I've ever seen. Imagine a gold imperial stout in appearance. The aromas are earthy, grassy, lemon, and feature a tart yeasty aspect which is quite interesting. The flavors took me by surprise. It's moderately tart and you can pick up the different yeasts. It's very grassy and again features a lemon like tartness. It drinks kind of dry and is full in body. The viscosity makes this wheat a little harder to get through than most. Drinking a glass makes you feel like you just consumed a loaf of bread. It's definitely an interesting beer and I'm glad it had so much complexity for the style. I'd recommend trying this one, but probably sharing it with a friend."
"O: Interesting beer, good play on American and Belgian aspects. Unfortunately, the finish is disappointing."
"O- A good and interesting take on an a wheat ale. Pretty easy to drink. The citrus does become a tad overbearing and takes on a strong rind character. Would have liked the wild aspect of this beer to come out more."
"D - Super drinkable. At 8% abv, there is very little evidence of it. The flavors are nicely balanced and fairly rich and complex without feeling heavy."
"Overall, a really easy drinking beer. I would like to have this around for the summer months."
"Beer is a very attractive hazy gold with an ivory head. Smell is of tangy sourdough bread. Taste opens with an orangey-citrus punch and finishes with sour cherry/lemon and alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is good; it's pleasantly carbonated. Overall, a very nice beer. It's big and assertive and not very subtle, but it's not trying to be. A good summer time beer."
"beer is lively with a fast rising head that just about overflows the glass. pale straw appearance with a good waft of citrus/lemon. Mild sourness comes through with the first sip. Not overpoweringly tart, but extremely pleasant with the contrast of a wheat beer with the belgian influence. moutfeel is highly carbonated and the melding of the flavors work well together. Extremely refreshing and effervescent. People often ask about good intros to sours, and even though this is not identified as such, would certainly be a good one to cut your teeth on. I find it similar to some of the jolly pumpkins I have tried. An all around great summer beer and one I will revisit very soon."
"I really liked what White Gold had going on. It's a light and refreshing beer that is still full of flavor and well constructed. Nice warm weather beer."
"750 ml to frosty pint glass. The beer looks good for its type. Pale orange and lively. Smells good too, with notes of citrus and sour. Tastes good; it'll make your face pucker up, but in a good way. Tastes like there's some apricot somewhere in the mix too. Mouthfeel is active and carbonated. Overall, a good beer that I'd probably drink more regularly if it wasn't $15/bottle."
"Notes: Ithaca is bringing there A game with this wonderfully complex and very satisfying Belgian influenced Ale. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone that likes American, Belgian, or German wheat ales."
"Bottle. Poured into a tulip glass a slightly cloudy golden color with a white fluffy head. Fresh, light, refreshing aroma with notes of grass, lemon, and a bit of spice. Medium mouthfeel with good carbonation. Lemony, slightly sweet, mild bitterness. Summertime beer. Semi-dry feeling. The belgium notes come in but its pretty mild. Nice."
" The feel which is astringent at times leads to the tangy acidic citrus combination of bretty funk and American hop accents. The fruity yeast is countered by an almost lime-like character from the bitter hops with mild pineapple/grapefruit flavors and mellow lemon tinge w/ yeast complexity present but the hops have mild grassy flavors that are somewhat fighting for the spotlight and there is a rind like flavor w/ funky dry yeastiness in the finish. The malt which is obivously doing its part for the beer is not over the top bitter, but it doesn't really contribute much to the flavor either. Overall I find this beer to be interesting and has nice brett and hop flavors, but the combination of yeasts and hops are leaving an unbalanced experience and the only real detracting thing is the alcohol becomes noticeable as you continue to drink."
"Overall this is a one hell of a good American Pale Wheat. The use of the belgium yeasts with the carbonation and the citrus and sour flavors make this the perfect summer drink. Good job Ithaca."
"O - I was able to try this at Al's but I'm confused on the style...the only American part I found in this beer was the bright citrus tones and piney hops...there's a lot of Belgian yeast and spices along with the funk...but I found this to be rather enjoyable when first served...the Belgian notes came out as the beer warmed"
"O: Wow, I wish this weren't so high in alcohol! It is dangerously drinkable, and the only reason I wouldn't buy it in bulk because of the high price tag and quick, yet unnoticeable, buzz from the high ABV."
"O - Interesting beer for sure. I enjoyed it as it seemed to be a cross of several different styles. I think if the flavors were a little more integrated, it would be that much better of a beer."
"Taste has a nice blend of refreshing wheat and hop flavors mixed with a tart, mild sourness that works perfectly on the palate. Would make for an awesome summertime quencher. Farmhouse-ish, but still maintains a certain bright cleanliness, if that makes any sense. Really nice brew that I would love to have again sometime. I was not sure what to think of this beer upon reading the label, but damn...this was one delicious bottle. A really nice beer Ithaca has here. I am loving the Excelsior series."
"D - Starts of strong in terms of appearance and smell, but quickly works its way back to average... The taste is a bit of a muttled mess with some nice things going on but no clarity... The mouthfeel is also a bit odd as well... Overall the sum doesn't equal the parts... An interesting offering, but not one I would either recommend or seek out again..."
"Drinkability – If I could describe this beer in one sentence, I would say, White Gold is a blend of a Belgian saison, a witbier, and a German Berliner weiss. A truly unique beer that has a lot going on. Ithaca describes it as a Rustic Pale Wheat Ale and I have to agree."
"O: A great beer with sour characteristics which are very well balanced. A great deal at $10 a 750ml. This was my second bottle and I will definitely get some more."
"Overall: I like this beer, but the aftertaste kind of bugs me. I'm really glad I got to try it, and I thought it was quite interesting."
"I don't know how well this beer would develop over time as the hop character fades, I think it would drift into a deeply sour realm with little else, I like the initial balance effort and think this beer would probably be its best extremely fresh, my guess is this bottle is probably a few months old, not exactly a terribly old beer, but the hops and malt would play better I suspect."
"This is my second brew by Ithaca, the first being Flower Power IPA. This is a great brew. It was recommended by a friend that heard about the brew. It didn't dissapoint. Its a nice solid brew that has a flavor that have to say I have never had. I would have to say that this brew should be a standard for the style. The brew isn't too overpowering either, so it could be easily consumed by anyone that enjoys the style. Ithaca rocked the house with this brew. Im glad I had a chance to have it on tap, but very excited to have the bottle as well."
"White Gold! Texas Tea...sweetener! It pours a hazy golden straw topped by over a finger of cream-white foam. The nose comprises wheat, orange zest, tart lemon zest, coriander, and black pepper. The taste holds notes of blood orange peel, black pepper, coriander, lightly tart mandarin oranges, wheat, and grass. Things don't quite meld together as well as one would hope. The body straddles the border between heavy light and light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish. Overall, a pretty solid brew, very similar to Bell's Oarsman on some mild steroids."
"This beer pours a hazy golden orange color fluff bleach white foam. The aromatics are a slight funky notes that are combined with citrus notes. The flavors are significantly more mild than the aromas had let on. The flavors are more sweet wheat flavors than the funk. I can almost not taste the tart. The mouthfeel is light but chewy and goes down epically smooth. Though there's not much to the content of this beer. I enjoy it, it's tasty, but there's nothing overly special about it."
"D: Too sweet for my tastes and I had to drainpour the last 1/3 of the bottle due to the extreme sediment. To separate the first 2/3 of the bottle and second 1/3 of the bottle would be best but unfortunately, they were all in the same bottle. So close to being excellent but missed on so many points."
"D: This beer is damn impressive. I could drink it all day long. How is this beer only rated a B+? I suppose a year on the bottle was the right decision. Incredible refreshing and would be excellent to pair with many types of food."
"Drinkability: I was sad to see this one go, will need more. Best for this style I have ever had."
"Overall, I'm going to guess that I got a bad bottle [at least I hope so]. I'd try another just to see if this one was an anomoly."
"We both loved the taste- much more on the palate than on the noise. It is hard to put this beer in a category-American Wheat/Saison/Wild Ale combo. No way you would guess 8% abv. Will absolutely buy more."
"Slightly slick going down, this beer finishes very dry. I found it to be sessionable, certainly worth a try."
"The looks are pretty. Its a light gold colored beer with a lively white head. Unfortunately there is no lacing. The aroma might be the best part. Its sporting very nice lemon that dies down to a smooth woodiness. The taste is mostly a rustic, musty woodiness with fresh lemon splashed in. Mild citric tartness and acidity is all of the ""sour"" qualities this beer has. This is a crazy dry beer. A glass of water might be a good idea."
"D - this is very food friendly and inviting of another glass. We were drinking it while snow fell outside and both of us thought it was more of a summer beer than winter."
"OVERALL: I've come to expect good things from Ithaca, and once again, they did not disappoint. This was not a style I was expecting to be terribly impressed with, but when we were at the brewery it was the only bottle from the Excelsior! Series they had, so I thought I'd try it out. To quote the label again though, the Excelsior! Series defies ""existing style guidelines."" If you find this beer anywhere, buy it - and that should be doable, given that the brewery claims that it can be cellared indefinitely."
"D: Easy drinking and complex for what it is, without stepping too far outside the constraints of a simple wheat beer. I'm a fan."
"Pours a slightly cloudy orange yellow color with a good sized white head that leaves lots of lace. Some lemon skin, toasted wheat and a sharp cheesiness in the nose. Crisp right off the bat, plums, white grape sweetness some lemon/lime, a balancing bitterness and a biscuity note late on the finish. Creamy and soft in texture, medium bodied, medium carbonation and no alcohol heat whatsoever. Very drinkable."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being about average. Drinkability is pretty decent, it was a very interesting and unique beer. I liked the little bit of sour flavor to it, it gave the wheat a little something extra and different. It was pretty smooth overall and also pretty flavorful. A pretty good beer overall."
"D: At 8% abv, this is extremely drinkable. It's not noticeable at all. I really enjoy this offering from Ithaca."
"Overall the flavors are kind of muddled in my opinion and leave a lot to be desired. I appreciate the creativity in the approach but it fell short."
"Beer is thin in body and highly carbonated. Its mildly sweet up front but nice on the finish. Not dry at all. This is how you make an American wheat ale, everyone pay attention. Drinkability high, mild fruit flavors in the midpalate, mild sweetness, wet finish, no aftertaste, easy drinking every day beer, if it were available to me on a regular basis."
"D - An easy (5), need I say more? Of the Ithaca brews I've had, this one ranks among the best they've ever brewed."
"Notes: At first I found this to be a little simple, but then flavor after flavor came up to the front. Every changing. Don't find a lot of wild yeast influence here, though. No acidity at all, not any real funk to speak of."
"The flavor takes the tartness up a notch, with a juicy, funky blast of orange peel and dry Brett. Wheat gets kicked aside, but manages to add a tasty balance of bread crust to the mix. White Gold finishes with a bone dry crispness--body is thin and well-carbonated. Overall, a unique beer to say the least, but probably not something I'd want to have again. Worth a try..."
"Overall - White Gold confuses me. It's like a non-spicy triple, and I really don't get much or any of the wild yeasts the bottle claims. With that being said, it's still a good brew. Appearance is great, solid flavors"
"I find that this beer becomes more enjoyable to drink as it warms & opens up. Still, it's nice to see how it progresses from being chilled. Seemingly drawing influence from a variety of styles (namely American Pale Wheat, Saison & Wild Ale) makes for a unique & interesting, if somewhat unconventional, brew."
"Another win for Ithica in the Excelsior line. It stood up will to its brother the Old Habit, but wasn't close to driving in the winning run. The spicier, still more complex Belgian Tripels would do it for me a bit better than this, but this was an excellent beer - I would even dare to say a fantastic session beer."
"D: No way this is 8.0%abv is my first though, feeling more at home like a 5% session. Exceptionally smooth tart summer time quencher with session like attributes that I could easily drink all day if not for the alcohol. A fairly high abv with an incredibly smoothness of a 5% session and one I could drink more of and more often."
"This was a tasty, mildly interesting beer that doesn't really fit nicely into a particular style. The trappist yeast lends a distinctly Belgian sweetness to the flavor and the wild yeasts provide a layer of mustiness, though not outright funk. On top of that there is a strong citric sweetness like an APA. Appearance is a cloudy, straw golden yellow with a retentive bubbly white head with minimal lacing. Body is thick and creamy smooth, with mild carbonation that leaves a sloppy wet and musty finish. Aroma is dominated by the earthy and musty notes much more so than the flavor is with little presence of the yeast or fruitiness. Extremely drinkable and refreshing, but kind of sloppy and not very well balanced. Now to find a fresh bottle..."
"This is really a great pale what ale. I would be happy to grab a 12 pack of this and stock my fridge-- sadly, it isn't available in small bottles, and even more sadly, it isn't available within 900 miles of where I live."
"Thick juicy mouthfeel goes really well with natural citrus fruity flavors and aroma. Very sessionable and interesting beer, supremely drinkable. Comparable to a Fantome saison, tart, but delicately balanced."
"F: Somewhat bitter, not a lot, with touch of lingering spicy earthy grassy mild hops. Mostly dry on the finish, pretty dry in fact. A dry saison farmhouse finish that has a slight wheat finish as well, and some lingering stickiness like it was a memory left in the wake of the dryness. A little bit of the lingering fruit as well, but not a lot. There's also a touch of a booze lingering."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and the alcohol is very well hidden."
"White Gold definitely defies today's style guidelines, which isn't a bad thing. It's basically a Belgian Tripel meets an American Wheat--it's good, but it could be great if it finished a bit cleaner and offered a bit more depth of malt."
"(low 80s in Milwaukee today)"
"D - This is an interesting beer, fairly tasty, and quite refreshing. It is not phenomenal, however, as some of the Excelsior! Series are..."
"A very drinkable and refreshing beer for a warm June day!"
"This is a pretty unique beer that is worth picking up."
"American Pale Wheat Ale would work a little better if it was American Pale Wheat Strong Ale. Almost like a wheaty Duvel. I like this beer a lot. Very pale colored beer and head. Very frothy head...all like Duvel. Flavor is also very belgiany (maybe from the wheat more than the yeast) but this beer is very good. I'll get it again."
"On the fuller side of medium bodied with tight tickling carbonation up front that lingers over the creamy, yet sweet body into a long dry finish. There is a nice hoppy and spicy presence up front with hints of citrus fruit and earthy pine which is excellently balanced by a sweet crisp fruit character, slight alcohol heat and bready yeast. Hints of apple, pear, grape and banana along with some zesty peppery spice and coriander. Very complex and flavorful with a long dry finish that leave e craving another sip. The alcohol is very faintly evident but at 8% the ABV is excellently masked, making this beer dangerously drinkable. Excellent!"
"Off tap at the brewing company this beer was a hazy golden color with a billowing, three-fingers-worth of lemon-tinted head. The retention was good, and the head became rocky over time, leaving sticky lacing. The aroma was of lemons, spicy hops, a little pepper with a slightly musty note of yeast. The flavors were fairly light for 8.5% but refreshing. Tart in a way similar to lemon zest further accentuated by the spiciness of Saaz hops with a background of earthy malt and a good presence of Belgian yeast. Nice wheat notes but more advanced than that. The mouthfeel was good, the carbonation appropriate and the body medium/light."
"Adventurous and magnificently crafted."
"This stuff is the tits. I had this before on tap about a year ago to the date of this writing and I like it even more now. I'm not sure if that's due to the keg being a bit older and the yeast kicking in a bit,(supposodly their is some wild yeast in this) but I would kill to have this on tap at my house in the springtime."
"Very smooth body in mouthfeel and easy to drink overall."
"I'm not sure ""American Pale Wheat Ale"" does this beer justice. ""Saison/Farmhouse"" is probably closer to what White Gold evokes. A delicate yet fairly complex beer, one I'm totally glad I picked up on a whim at Wegmans in Syracuse, NY."
"Nice amount of body and GREAT carb on this one. Overall, it was nice, but I felt like it was just missing something (or maybe I was). A nice offering, but I'll take others from Ithaca over this any day."
"M/D - very light & crisp, very drinkable but the flavor is lacking a little, i was definitely expecting more"
"Poured a brilliant hazy gold color with great carboantion and a big pillowy head. Nose is dry, wheat, hops, with yeast, honey, light floral and citrus notes. Taste is wheat, honey, light citrus, small dose of hops and some good ol belgian yest. Mouthfell is crisp, clean and refreshing. Drinkability is very good."
"Slightly hazy amber in color. Pours with half inch head good lacing. Nondescript smell. Strong taste of citrus which lasts throughout. Aftertaste is not bitter. Average drinkability. Slightly on the heavy side for the beer type. Suprisingly high abc of eight percent"
"The Kings Of Hop"
"I was excited i grab this one up the other day, expecting some much more than it ended up being. This pale wheat with Franco-Belgian leanings & some nice brett-funk s=certainly looked the part. It poured a lovely cloudy pale yellow with good bubbles & a 1"" white fluffy head, but little lacing. The aroma was nice, complex in its lemon, orange peel, white pepper & grassy herbal notes. The taste was crisp, medium bodied but meh in flavor. There were light notes of grainy yeast, sour hop edges & farm malts, but only if really paying attention. Overall, kinda bland for something so promising. I wouldn't turn it down, but I probably wouldn't seek it out again."
"A capped 750ml bottle share with psycohops. Poured into a pair of nonic pint glasses. The ale appears a hazed golden yellow color with a good inch or so of pillowy white head. Aromas and flavors are of lemon and orange peel, spicy yeast, a bit tart, toasted wheat, grassy. Crisp and bubbly with just about moderate carbonation. Decent stuff."
"Good beer nothing overly exciting. Pretty drinkable. Not overly complex with more lemongrass and a decent hop character. Moderate carbonation very grassy and earthy with some pitted fruits."
"Drinkability: A bit pricey at around $10, but I liked the experimentation and all they tried to do with this. It's a different beer, which melds many types of flavors well, into a flavorful and crisp and good for the end of summer brew as the cold moves in. Looking forward to more in the series as I can find them."
"M/D - A nice level of carbonation with a taste that keeps you going back for more. My first 7oz pour is already gone..."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/2"" off-white head over the effervescent clear golden brew. Head sno-cones above the rim over time, finally calming down to leave chunky bits of lacing. Aroma is sedate, of wheat, spices and citrus. Taste is an intensification of what the nose hinted at. Mouthfeel is a bit too prickly for my taste, and drinkability is pretty good. A good representative of the style, a bit too much carbonation for me."
"Of the three Ithaca Excelsior! beers I have had, this one is my least favorite. It seemed a little lacking in complexity, but still is a very enjoyable beer. Definetly worth checking out, but if you have a choice, go with either Ten or Brute as they are superior brews overall."
"Drinkability is good but slightly hampered by the overabundance of licorice flavor."
"Drinkability: A unique brew. At 8.0% abv, it's certainly no traditional pale wheat ale. This one defies classification really, with a motley crew of yeast strains, intercontinental malts and hops, and a soupcon of imagination to boot. Very glad I got to try this one - not sure what I was expecting really, but I could see myself trying this one again, should it make itself available. At 8.0%, I'm still able to type after finishing off the bottle (always a plus), though it is somewhat hefty. I liken this somewhat to a softer, more bitter version of the Southhampton Grand Cru - both had those intensely spicy Belgian notes going on, though this one seems to be a little more sticky, syrupy, sugary sweet. Either way, recommended."
"Drinks pretty nice, but the ABV & complexity of this do hinder me a bit. Loved the Franco-Belgian flair of this! Makes me think tripel"
"Slightly better in the bottle, but what's left are old bottles..."
"quite interesting."
"Wheat beers are not always my favorite, but this was quite tasty and enjoyable."
"D - In some ways, it just feels like this beer is trying to be too many things at once, with the wheat malt, the hops, and the different types of yeast. They blend together to make an enjoyable warm weather brew, but one that might be improved with a little more focus. I would probably pair this beer with a creamy, buttery blue cheese and some fresh fruit, like a pear, a peach, or some strawberries."
"The drink is crisp and quaffable with a firm medium body and spot-on Belgianesque carbonation. White Gold is my latest encounter with a representative brew from Ithaca's outstanding Excelsior! series, and this particular member of the family is every bit as impressive, damned tasty, and satisfying as the rest."
"I would rank this up there with some of my other favorites, Franciscaner and Weihenstephaner."
" A light wheat malt brew with hot cinnemon and ginger crispness is the first impression. The wonderfully complex yeast(S) gives many authentic Belgian Brews a run for the money in complexity. The yeast has a robust, wild flavor with lots of earthiness and succulant fruits. The depth of the yeast and hops is really bold, the light wheat malt adds just the right balance. This is one of my favorite yeast flavor's without being from an Abbey. The American, English and wild yeast adds up to IMPRESSIVE. A crisp, zippy feel and slightly dry. you can taste the wild variety in the finish most. Heat is well hidden but effective. The buzz is rather intense so don't let this one fool you!"
"Thanks to Dr Dogbeer!"
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, it's a fairly good beer overall, but whether I'm looking for a Belgian-style, American-style or a wheat beer that's a combination thereof, there are definitely others that I would pick first."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a HUGE foamy white head that fades fairly quickly. Spotty pattern of Belgian lacing left behind. The smell is bright; lemon, pepper and classic wheat malt fragrances. Visible effervescent, the first pour is almost champagne-like with lighter-medium body. Full flavored, the taste matches the nose and is complemented nicely by the textures. Tangy and slightly tart; on the dry side while the brightness lingers appropriately. Very refreshing and a really nice drinker. The 8% ABV is well integrated in the swallow, yet warms slightly on the way down. Highly recommended."
"A very flavorful Pale Wheat Ale, which is certainly saying something positive for this offering. Flavorful, balanced, and very drinkable as I would have guessed the alcohol by volume to be well under 6%."
"Drinkability: Very good. The beer isn't as complex as it puts on, but it is quenching and easy to drink. Very nice."
"D-This is a pretty good brew that is easy to drink. It drinks like a typical, sessionable wheat beer-so the ABV is very sneaky. This has a much milder, less exciting character than many of this style but is still a pretty good beer-actually-I split this with my mom and she loved it. Its a great, classic wheat beer that doesn't get wild or crazy in anyway except for ABV."
"D: High drinkability due to easy drinking and light body. Alcohol sneaks up definitely. This one is better than half the wines I've had. (Why did I think that last sentence was important when I was taking notes?)"
"Drinkability- This brew is a serious change of pace. I really liked it from the first sip and the last sip was pretty damned good too. I'm not sure what else to say about it really! Just plain good stuff, thanks Adam!"
"Out of a 750ml capped and foiled bottle. Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a nice rocky pure white head that quickly dissipated into a sparse cap but left beautiful lacing. The aroma is fruity, a blend of pineapple and green apple, some peppery spice, and a light juicy hop. The taste is subtle but nice. Some tropical fruitness followed by what seems to be yeasty phenols, some wheat malt characteristics. The feel is moderate, almost light, with fizzy carbonation, which makes this damn drinkable. The 8%abv nowhere to be found. This is a beer that is not meant to fit a style. It clearly has some european influence, which I guess makes it a cross between a BPA and an American wheat. Very unique."
"Taste has some citrus (orange, pinnaple, and maybe some white grape) and a hint of spice, with wheat and a fair amount of carbonation. Very drinkable, and refreshing."
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"The mouth experiences a frothy thickness on the tongue. Bubbly yet creamy. It's sweet and quite drinkable. A hint of sourness, but lots of tree fruits to balance it out."
"Pours a clear yellow with a thin head and slight lacing. The aroma is persimmony, with the familiar sting of Pilsener malt with maybe a little floral hops in there somewhere. The flavor is sweet, pineapply, with a hint of white grape. It has a wheaty finish with a thin but refreshing mouthfeel."
"Ppours a hazy, pale yellow color, with a nice white head. In the aroma, corriander, orange peel, and nice wheat notes. In the taste, corriander, orange peel dryness, earthy, and a cinnamon like end. A small, spicey bite with a medium bodied mouthfeel, and a dry corriander and cinnamon like aftertaste. Quite dry, and nice spices, not to shabby."
"D: Very good."
"drinkable for a wheat beer since wheats are not my favorite style. having it meshed with an american ale (which I would swear had some belgian yeast in it as well) made it drinkable. would pair well with a garlic and olive oil pasta pretty nicely."
"A winner from Ithaca Brewing Company"
"The spices and esters are kept in check enough to make this one excellent wheat beer. The complexity is huge and the flavors are stacked on top of each other perfectly. Thanks for the bottles Paul and Adam!"
"This one is damn tasty and way under the radar peeps!"
"Feel is well carbonated giving a light and airy quality. Dangerously quaffable. More of a Belgian than American beer. A good beer that I won't be purchasing again due to the price tag."
"A slighty boozy, creamy mouthfeel. Just average drinkability. Decent beer."
"Overall- A huge (25ozer?) bottle that got sucked down quickly. Easily drinkable, light but tasty! Enjoyed this 1!(Thanks Charles!)"
"Overall very nice with a light dry finish and an easy drinking for an 8% beer. This was not my favorite of the series, but I truly cannot say a bad thing about it. The light citrus hop taste was a nice added touch to it and really brought the whole thing together. I would definitely recommend giving this one a try."
"Drinkability is average this is just another strong wheat beer. All the aspects of a nicer thirst quencher, but the overt strength really presents a challenge. I totally forgot there was any brett, it's a total non-factor at this point (no idea of the age, I just bought it in Boston). I had higher hopes, in spite of not caring for TEN, but this was another overpriced, under-producing brew from Excelsior. I'm always a big supporter of any brewer's reserve style beers, but a little QA goes a long way as far as not putting out the first recipe you think of! Not cheap and not to good, 1 and done thank you very much..."
"D: More bottles! Seriously wish I had more. Good thing they are still making this. Glad I laid this one down. Don't know how much longer it will improve but time definitely changed this beer."
"Drinks very well. Smooth and fulfilling all the way. This guy is a winner."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow with a ton of carbonation and a huge white foamy head. The head lasts forever and leaves great lacing. The smell is somewhat pungent with a hint of clove,banana,wheat,and lemon. The taste is full of hop crispness with cloves,banana,wheat,and lemon. The m/f is light with all the flavors mixing well.especially for a high alcohol brew. A damn good beer,not the best, but something that should be tried if you can find it."
"The beer is quite carbonated and very complex. This is the type of beer that is a pleasure to review because it changes in subtle ways with each drink. The beer does have a high ABV which does leave a bit of a throaty aftertaste. L'Chaim."
"There is not much in the way of distinctly Brettanomyces derived flavors here, though they could be influencing the musty, earthy aspects of this beer (though this could just as likely be from a characterful Saccharomyces strain). This is a tasty beer though that is a pleasure to drink. The aroma comes off a bit more intriguingly than the taste, but only just."
"This beer finishes like nothing I've had before. It almost seems as if someone has taken a decent Belgian, and combined it with a glass of champagne. If it tasted more like Orange Juice, it would remind me of Christmas morning. Very dry finish also does well to disguise the 8% abv. This is a very well made beer."
"This gets better and better with warmth. Maybe it doesn't blow the doors off with overabundance of ingredients but this is very comforting, well-rounded and enjoyable while being quite easy to drink."
"Drinkability is very nice on this beer. Very smooth and balanced wheat beer that is incredibly refreshing on a warm day. Also, has enough taste that it never gets boring. I would recommend to anyone during a nice day."
"Poured into an Imperial pint glass, nice one inch head. Nice gold color with a little cloudiness. The wild yeast hasn't had time yet to do their thing, this beer would definitely evolve with a little aging. That being said this is very drinkable now with a very dry finish. Overall very nice."
"Had again 2.5 years later on tap and found it astringent wheat."
"Pours a very hazy gold color, plenty of sediment here, a good size bright white head slowly recedes. Aroma is some nice lemon and orange citrus, perfumy floral aroma, spicey and yeasty, wheat is evident as well in the aroma but is fairly subdued. Taste shows a nice mixture of soft and sweet nutty wheat along with some good citrus notes. Honey sweetness as well. Spicy and crisp towards the finish with a dry grassy bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium, soft feel up front followed by a good tingle of spiciness on the tongue, a little alcohol warmth in the drying hoppy finish. A good beer for sure would love a little more body but overall a refreshing yet potent wheat. Thanks to Adam for the opportunity."
"Bottom line: This is about as close to perfection in the style that I'm probably ever going find so...let the scores fall where they may. Wonderful drop!"
"Overall: A wonderful example of the style and one that Ithaca should be proud of. It is part of their Exclesior series, and let me say it is for good reason!"
"A great brew from Ithaca. Definitely a surprise at how good this one is. Really hides the 8% ABV. Fantastic. cheers!"
"Finally something a little higher class from Ithaca. Keep these beers coming."
"Thanks, BeerTruth, for the opportunity"
"This was an interesting brew for sure. It had some dry white wine-like characteristics it seemed to me, given the very low level of sweetness and the higher level of bitterness. Different for sure, and worth a try."
"Drinkability: It's fine for a beer of intertwined styles."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, yesty, citrusy, with a dry finish."
"M: Stellar carbonation and lots of wheat make this extremely smooth and drinkable. Cool brew, thanks to BeerTruth for sending it to me."
"Poured into a large tulip glass a hazed lighter gold with a hint or orange a tight fluffy,sticky white head atop leaving a sheet of lace as it settled slowly.The Belgo-American influences in this brew really show thru in the nose,a Belgian yeasty slightly smokey and tropical fruity notes really show thru upfront and then a real noticable floral and sharp American hop profile comes thru and really stands out very nice with equal billing to both.Wow complex to the hilt its sharp and spicey at one point and soft and fruity next,one thing is for sure the hops ring thru in a nice lingering finish.The Belgian yeast component upfront with its slight smokiness and spice just overpower or even come close to that everything just melds nicely,very well done.With more of the Excelsior brews coming in soo according to the rep at my local Consumers I will jump to get them for sure I am really looking forward to the Old Habit."
"D- The taste and smell of this beer are fantastic and something I would love to try again. If I can only muster up the beer budget to make it down to IBC for another bottle."
"Medium-light body and mouthfeel. Smooth and very drinkable."
"A tad undrinable thanks to the alcohol. This beer should be due for some aging in my opinion to mellow out the bite to it. A touch out of balance thanks to the alcohol."
"Has some aspects of a farmhouse saison, an abbey ale, and an american wheat rolled into one fantastic combination. My review does little justice to the depth of this brew, I highly recommend it."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a light pale and wheat malt scent along with a fruity zest and slight coriander aroma. The taste is good. It has a dry earthy flavor that goes down easy and finishes fruity with a wheat malt edge. It's crisp and refreshing; a nice spring brew. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an interesting brew and a welcome change from the regular lineup. Keep up the good work."
"So here goes! Pours a murky straw color with a white fluffy head that dies down to almost nothing soon after pour. Lacing is somewhat spotty, here and there on the glass. Smell is that of mild banana with a hint of lemon/lime peels. I also detected a bit of honey that tickles the nose once and a while. Taste is very much the same as the odor, but the banana flavor is hardly present. More of a hoppy citrus flavor than a wheaty malt taste. I think the ""Strong Pale"" shines more in the flavor of the brew while the ""Wheat Ale"" is more powerful in the smell. Mouthfeel is quite dry, but not overly dry. Carbonation is just about nothing to the eye, but is very present on the tougne. Very clean going down. The balance in this brew is just about perfect. I love the drinkability of this brew. Perfect for a warm summer day with the grill cookin'. Pick this one up for sure, as well as the IPAbbey when and if you can make it to the Ithaca area. Good work once again Chief and the Ithaca Beer Co. Crew!"
