review_text
"It offers yeasty bread aromas and flavors and a hint of banana. There is nice depth from the wheat but not a lot of spice. Although it does not have an immense amount of flavor, it is very refreshing and drinkable."
"Basically an average at best wheat beer. Nothing about it really stands out as being outstanding, and that funky taste in it doesn't help. I got this as part of a make your own six pack, glad I got to try it, and more glad I don't have 5 more of the same to drink."

"To me this has to be the first beer I have or it just gets overwhelmed by whatever I drank prior to it. It also wears thin on my buds after two or three. But for two or three when thristy this is a good option and a solid version of an american wheat."

"Really??? How did this one ever get brewed for production? If someone told me the goal of the brewer was to make a replica of Corona I would have believed them. Capital is one of the top brewers in the nation, which is why I was shocked by this lame beer."

"It is what it was meant to be - a refreshing pale wheat ale. While it's still basic, it has more character to it. Wheat malt is well-used, and just a subtle hint of hops, yet has a dry-ish finish. Very ""sessionable""."

"O: Overall a little above average. I appreciate the gift all the way from WI. Thanks T!"

"I am sure I have had this beer before since it is local but I have never sat down to actually review it. Unfortunately for the low abv, this beer was way too much work to drink. What I mean by that is I don't even mind that it is pretty low in alcohol content but it wasn't really that easy drinking of a beer. The mouthfeel was slightly harsh and it felt like there was a bunch of stuff forced into the taste of this beer. Speaking of the taste there was definitely wheat present along with some fruit and light hops. Not a great drinking experience."

"O - A tasty wheat ale that offers up a traditional flavour profile for the style. Nothing over the top, but easily sessioned and a perfect summer patio ale."

"Island Wheat pours a clear bright straw color, with a good size head. There is a slightly skunk aroma with some hints grainy wheat. The taste is crisp, clean, good full wheat flavors, with hints of a carmalized malts. Not watery, full flavor, a little too carbonated. Overall this is a solid wheat ale, clean and crisp, but on the lighter side."
""

""

""
""
"Overall: A pretty decent take on the wheat ale style. Some nice citrus character. Nice summer option."
""
""
""
""
"Body is light, with fairly high carbonation, creating a crisp, sparkling mouthfeel with some slight prickliness across the palate. Closes out with a semi-dry finish, leaving some lingering sweetness and stickiness on the palate."

"O: I really like this beer. I think this was a great addition to Capital's repertoire. It goes down smooth and is refreshing. It's not necessarily going to blow the doors off of anyone, but it is very consistent and always been good to me. Grab one on a hot summer day and enjoy!"
""
""
"Overall, this beer is a poor example of the style, and is more so fermented lemon juice. I enjoy good wheat ales, and this is one I would have as a last resort."
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, very mild kick, good representation of style, this is a very poundable lighter beer that is worth drinking for a while."
""
"O: Refreshing and very drinkable. Especially enjoyable on a warm day"

"This beer when poured into a pint glass, has a yellowish body with a thin white head. The smell is grainy with not fruit smell. The taste is a little better, some wheat taste with a little bit of citrus. The mouth feel is ok and overall, is a average beer, good for the summer."
""
""
""

"Mild beer that won't knock anybody's socks off. Good summer beer, but overall I wasn't terribly impressed by it. Gets a C: drinkable, passable, that's about it."

"Don't know how many islands there are in the lakes surrounding Madison, but I'm pretty sure that not much wheat would grow there regardless. Still, this stuff pours a slightly hazy pale sallow topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises wheat, light puffed rice, and the vague notion of lemon peel. The taste holds notes of damp wheat, grass, musty lemon rind, and light powdered sugar. Something very unappealing about this flavor combination... The body is fairly light, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda watery feel. Overall, a weak beer all-around, one I'll probably never seek out again."
""
"Drinkability: This is nothing to write home about. With so many real, Bavarian wheat beers available, I have no clue why I should even bother with the pale American versions. It is definitely drinkable, and true to style, but it lacks the flavor and aroma experience I want from wheat beer."
"So I suppose sometimes ""less is more"" is not the best idea."
"AVERAGE, NOT MUST HAVE!"
"O: not the best of this style I have tried, but nothings wrong here. Certainly a candidate for a session brew and a good effort."
"D: I dont think I would choose this beer for this purpose, but its definitely a summer beer that you could put back a bunch of as a session with light character."
"O-A good microbrew style wheat that is nice to get a 12 pack of cans to enjoy at home or for packing a cooler. A nice alternative to a lot of the domestics. Another winner from Capital-I hope they keep this one around."
"Wisconsin....Wisconsin....where for art tho Wisconsin!!! Oh...a lil' Capital Brewing after a hard fought hockey game...and that's what I'm talking about!!!! This beer is cloudy yellow with decent head. The hints of lemon/citrus hit the nose nicely. The taste is very good...nice wheat balanced with lemon/citrus. The mouthfeel is easy and I could mown the lawn all day with this beer! ENJOY!"
"I'll have to check after I'm done writing, but i thought Capital was all about lagers, but this is certainly a nice light filtered wheat brew."
"This wasn't bad at all. Pretty well done little hoppy wheat beer here that had some kick to it but the wheat and citrus gave this a sweet smoothness that coupled with the crisp feel to keep this quite quaffable."
"Thanks to resi for the trade.Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains and citrus. Taste is a bit of sour lemon up front, some wheat and grains, not bad but nothing special. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a pretty good beer."
"Drinkability: Drinks great! Could knock back a few of these on a hot afternoon. No alcohol flavor to speak of. Overall a good example of the style, simple, and well made. Recommended."
"Although Island Wheat no doubt will not appeal to folks who like bigger, bolder (and hoppier~!) entries in the APWA style segment, I'd say it's a hell of a beer to have around when a thirst-slaking wheat is what the doctor ordered. The fact that this one is available in 12 pack cans will have me seeking it out (over E.g. Blue Moon, Wittekerke) the next time I head out to throw some discs with friends ; )"
"Directly after the Crack & Glug, I felt as though I were looking at lemon meringue pie in a glass! The liquid was a hazy lemon-yellow and the finger-and-a-half of foam was thick and bone-white! Beautiful. Nose had a peppery tang to it and suddenly my mouth was watering. Mouthfeel was medium and there were flavors of lemon and pepper on the tongue, but both in mild forms. Refreshing, indeed! I spent the day in a humid classroom at the end of the hall because one (or more) of my jagov colleagues opened their window(s), defeating the central A/C. What I wouldn't have given for one of these beers out of a cooler at lunchtime. Sadly, as a high school English teacher, beer is frowned upon in the building. I had to wait until I got home, but it was worth the wait. I would not want a steady diet of Island Wheat, but a couple/few on a humid day would really cure what ales me."
"(D)- A solid refreshing beer. Light-bodied with some good flavors. A great session brew to have around."
"This is a light bodied brew with a typical moderate to high level of carbonation. It is quite drinkable but each sip seems to make this brew come across a bit watery in the feel but overall it isn't bad. This isn't a beer that I would seek out on a regular basis but it is certainly something you sit down and have a few of on a hot day."
"I enjoyed the Island Wheat beer from Capital Brewery. It is a light wheat beer, comparable to something like Boulevard Wheat. It is a light shade of gold, almost yellow. You can detect a bit of citrus in the smell and taste. My girlfriend really liked this beer, so I would say the drinkability is very high as well. This beer won't blow your mind, but it is definitely worth the try."
"D- A run of the mill beer that could be a good lawnmower beer now that it comes in a can. Nothing really spectacular about this beer, average all around."
"Pours a nice cloudy pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger fizzy white head, with some nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, with some yeast/grass notes, slightly spiced. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, yeasty/grassy, a slight spice note. Light-Medium body. Drinkable, a nice thirst quencher."
"Easy to drink, finishes easily, but not too much happening here."
"What's there doesn't taste bad at all, it's just that there's barely anything there. Would definitely make for an easy summer drinker if it was cold."
"D - Fits well with the style, which is to say most (though not all) APWAs are simple, mediocre, and designed to convert the macro drinker's palate. Not a bad choice for a ""premium"" lawnmower beer though."
"D= Great. This beer didn't let me down at all. I'm not a real big fan of the brewery at all but this beer is really good. Smooth and crisp. Nice wheat forward beer with great flavors and still lets the wheat take the front seat. Awesome job. I'll but this again any day I got a cravin for a wheat."
"I bring it home, crack one open, and I think I like it better from a can than a bottle. Very mild, very drinkable. I could probably put a few of these away in a sitting if it was better available down here."
"Taste: Rather enjoyable, for such a typically bland style anyways. Mild hop bitterness in the finish."
"D - The only time I ever see myself wanting this beer ever again is on a hot summer day when i need a refreshing brew. It really lacks in flavor. There is next to nothing there. But it is what it is and for a wheat beer it's incredibly refreshing."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of yeast, pale malt, wheat, and slight citrus. Fits the style of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of wheat, yeast, pale malt, and slight citrus. Overall, refreshing but, lacking body and complexity."
"D: This is a very refreshing beer, though not a very complex one. Easy drinker for a summer day."
"D- A nice sessionable beer that would be great on a summer day out on the lake. I can't imagine the alcohol being all that high, but it would still be nice to know what I am dealing with here."
"4/3/3.5/3/4"
"Overall a nice session beer for my taste. I will be picking up more of these."
"This certainly isn't the Spotted Cow-killer they were hoping it would be, but it's a welcome alternative to the more unadventurous (and commercially viable) pale wheats out there."
"Conclusion: This is an average American Wheat...the only thing that puts it slightly over others like it is the floral notes on the finish"
"A great example of the sytle. Be sure to check it out when the weather gets warm."
"Twist-off cap, pours a vivid, straw yellow with a fluffy white head. Pungent grains present in the nose, both sweet and bitter. Yeasty, grassy... Nothing special, nothing bad. Grassy and bitter to taste, fading into a macro-style sweetness, though not in a terribly overpowering way. Bitter again, with a hint of skunk at the end. Meh. Good carbonation. Not a highly drinkable beer, in my opinion. The bitterness is a bit much."
"Pours an interesting very pale, golden-straw color, slightly cloudy, and a thin white head with good retention. Smells like a lighter strain of wheat and northern yeast, backed by a mild orange citrus and a tiny bit of the characteristic banana you find in wheat ales. Overall the nose is very fresh and appealing. First taste is mellow yeast and wheat, with the citrus gently blended, and a tiny bit of hopping the round it out. The citrus and yeast linger into the aftertaste. Light and refreshing to a high degree, but still medium in body and full-flavored, it's easy to see why this is one of Capital's key brews."
"D - This is a pretty standard wheat ale. It tastes good and is very easy drinking."
"Notes from: 7/31/06"
"This was an unremarkable but refreshing beer."
"D= This was a relatively weak flavored wheat ale but that is by definition dead-on for the style. Thus its pretty darn drinkable."
"Mouthgeel is average. Carbonation is adequate, finish is thin."
"D - Easy to session. Just not very interesting."
"Drinkability is very high on this. Goes down easily and flavorfully. Great with food (like my salad). Nicely done. Seems best when cold."
"Pours a very light yellow, almost clear color with a thin white head that dissipates quickly leaving very light lacing. Lots of wheat aroma with some sour yeast. Wheat also dominates the taste with some sweet malt and lemon mixed in. Light body, high carbonation, cleanses the mouth. Goes down real easy but not much to it."
"D: Wouldn't mind having a few of them, but would probably get bored drinking it, unless drinking for quantity."
"It was pretty good to drink. I found it refreshing and easy going. The sum of all of its qualities makes this very drinkable."
"This beer pours a hazy straw color. The head is birhgt white, billowy, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma has some mild tangy wheat, and really nothing else. The taste is as unadventurous as the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with carbonation which is annoyingly high even for a wheat beer. Overall, this is a boring beer. I cannot think of any reason why I would drink this beer again."
"Pours a slightly hazed golden pale with a modest white head. The aroma is lightly sweet, yeasty, wheat, lemon, and some spice. The flavor is light honey, wheat, light and light spice. Creamy texture, very soft mouthfeel. A decent summer beer but Capital definitely makes better."
"This wheat ale pours a clear light golden body with a quickly dissipating white head. There is a strong dry wheat aroma from the local wheat. Your first taste is a big toasty wheat nose and a good amount of carbonation to support the dry after taste. There is no loss in the zip department, with a some pepper and lemon zest. There is a lot going on here and the flavor profile does a good job of highlighting the locally grown wheat. The other flavors support and balance out the wheat. Light, refreshing bit of terior, but with wheat instead of hops. Try with a lawn chair at the end of a hot day or a basic freshly grilled fish taco."
"Goes great with anything. Drinkability is off the freaking chart. Has a clearly identifiable wheat taste that lingers somewhat. It's a nice change of pace beer."
"M/D: Highly carbonated. Easy to drink a few of these, but, have had MUCH better wheats."
"Crisp and not quite as thin as the aforementioned descriptors would perhaps lead you to believe. Still this is one of the least interesting beers I've had out of Middleton. Best they stick to making first-rate bocks and lagers and leave wheat beers to their brethren in New Glarus."
"It might be better with a slice of orange in it or something. But by itself, it isn't worth the price compared to other wheat beers."
"Drinkable, yes, yet too uninspiring to prove sessionable."
"Drinkability: If you are looking for a light wheat beer, this will be for you. However, I like more flavors in my wheat beers."
"Lets out a thin head, but a strong ring o' foam around the perimeter of the beer. Very pale banana, golden hay and mild bubbling. Very small bubbles. The aroma is a little tart bananas, very faint. Smell more dry malts than anything. The taste is a little bland and tart. Almost sour, ester malts with no noticeable hops. Pretty clean palate, a little adjuncty tasting bitterness that brings the mouthfeel down a peg. But very easy to drink."
" ~ I've had this beer a couple times in the past and I never truly enjoyed it. Not to say it's a bad beer in any way because all beers have their place. This is just one I don't much enjoy."
"Smell has a slight citrus tinge to it. Taste has a pale lemon flavor to it, hops and malt blend weak in the background. If you're in the mood for a light tasting beer, this is pretty good. It's straightforward, but it tastes good. Despite the fairly light and smooth taste, it does not give me the impression of being watery. There's nothing too remarkable about it, but pretty drinkable."
"12 oz bottle. The brew is very light yellow in color with a sparse coat over top of the brew. There is a steady carbonation and the clarity is excellent on this one. Looking at the bottom of the bottle, I should have swirled this one during the pour, as there is a lot of yeast in there. The aroma is husky and wheaty with strong fruity overtones. Taking a sip, I get a light wheat, light herbal hop with a tailing bitterness, hat clings to the side of my tongue. It is extremely clean without a lot to it. Mouthfeel is light with a moderate to strong carbonation that stings a little on my tongue. I'm torn with this brew because it has been such a nice one to take camping for sitting around the fire and for enjoying in the heat of the day. It is one that I can really sit down and just enjoy without having to do a lot of thinking, so I think it carries through on what it is meant to be. I enjoy it."
"A real session beer, I prefer the Kloster Weizen, but nothing wrong here."
"drinkability is great. clean flavors and a light character make this one very refreshing."
"Drinkability - this is not bad, but it is not good either, and certainly not inspiring, and so its sessionability for me is quite low."
"D: Good."
"D- A smooth drink which tastes pretty good, and 1 can easily follow the other"
"D - I think this is a great session beer. I have had it in cans while on a river trip. Its good stuff."
"A very unremarkable beer, will not have this one again."
"Into a pint glass, pours a nice yellow gold, a constant bubbling springs forth from below, a white cap settling down to film that looks remarkably like downtown Madison and its two lakes. The aroma is pale, wheaty malt, thats about it. Pleasant though. The taste is marginally better, some berries thrown in with the wheat. The body is pretty decent, the carbonation too low for the style. Overall, kind of a wierd American wheat, but not too shabby."
"This beer ranks about 5 on my top 10. Almost everyone I know that has tried it has liked it even though most are caught up in the ""Budlite"" crapshoot."
"Drinkability - This is one of my go-to beers, particularly in the summer. Light and refreshing and local. Well made beer from a high quality producer."
"Straight out of the fridge. Poured form the bottle into my favorite glass. Poured surprisingly clear for a wheat, so I looked in the bottle and all the sediment was stuck to the bottom of the bottle. Medium yellow in color with thin white head. Very little head retention. Slight malty aroma, but I didn't really detect anything else. Medium/light body. Well balanced slight taste of hops and malt with a slight Citrus taste on the finish. I wonder if there may have been a more yeasty taste if I'd agitated at the finish of the pour to get the sediment into the beer? VERY drinkable beer. Alcohol not very detectable."
"Very well done! An excellent American wheat that has at least some roots in the Bavarian style."
"Although I love touring the brewery, and everyone there is really nice, I've just never been a big fan of their beers. They've always seemed just a bit similar to me. Obviously there's no way you can confuse this flavor due to its style. I also think they're being very bold with how sweet this is. This beer is also the only beer that sports a different styled logo. They KNOW that this beer is different, and are treating it so. Although it's too sweet for my liking, any wheat beer lover has GOT to try this."
"Very hazy amber color with a medium white head. Decent lacing. Smell is weak with only notes of pale malt and wheat. Maybe a touch of bread. Taste is also a touch weak but most beers in this style can't really be too flavorful. A touch of wheat and some citrus lemon qualities to clean the palate in the finish. There's no off flavors or flaws in here which is most important when drinking a summer quencher like an American Wheat. Capital always shines in mouthfeel and drinkability and this is no different. Smooth, long flavors. Quite refreshing. Good for the summertime as a quencher but the style just doesn't do it for me as a whole."
"I am disappointed that I laid out $7.79 for this 6-pack"
"Drinkability: Great summer drinking - the light flavor is what I tend to call macro/micro flavor, but after 30+ hours of driving in the last four days, this was totally what I was looking for - a beer that cleanses the palate and invigorates. Obviously not a beer for hopheads or big beer fans, and not a beer that will stun with its flavor, but definitely a nice offering within the style. But drinking a few while grilling or having a summer meal should prove satisfying."
"Bottom line - well made but a bit boring."
"I had put off purchasing this because I feared it would be nearly identical to Goose Island's Urban 312 from last year. For me that wasn't too far from the truth, but for some reason, I happen to like Island Wheat a tad better. Like others have said though, and the same thing I wrote about in my review of the 312 last year, this is probably created to appeal to the Spotted Cow and Cattail Ale group. A beer designed to cater to the masses."
"Bought a six pack of this for my wife (to accompany my sixer of bitter woman - no puns are intended... Tyranea's Bitter Woman IPA is a delicious beer and my wife is a sexy bitch) while we were on our camping trip in Gov. Dodge State Park. I smell wheat, nothing else. Taste is wheaty with a little bit of yeast. thin and kind of blah overall. Ok to drink on a hot day but overall not particularly satisfying. My main concern is that since this beer is so run-of-the-mill, I wonder if it's worth Capital's while to go out of their way to get wheat from Washington Island. Theres lots of wheat growing right around Madison, fellas."
"I prefer Capital's Kloster Weizen (Hefe Weizen) to their new Island Wheat (American Pale Wheat) simply because I prefer the former style to the latter. However, they're both good versions of their respective styles and I'm sure that both have, or soon will have, their loyal fans. Drink up, for summer is upon us!"
"Clouded dull yellow. Lots of carbonation is present. Frothy white head sits on top for a while. Lace is good. The aroma seems a little smoky, a little phenolic and a little tart. Dumbed down flavors for a dumbed down beer for the dumbed down masses. But will the masses actually drink a clouded beer like this?? Don't think so. So this beer serves little purpose. Doesn't appeal to the dumbed down masses. Doesn't appeal to the knowledgeable beer fan. Stick to the Kloster Weizen. That one has some flavor. This is slightly tart and a little dry on the finish. Blandness across the board. A little acidity. Carbonation is frisky. Not much substance here. I'm disappointed."
"This is my new favorite beer from Capital Brewery. Beer resembles a hefe weiss in appearance and aroma, but does not have the spiciness of that particular style of beer. Nonetheless this beer is a great session beer and one that I will enjoy in the upcoming summer months. Taste was a refereshing lighter beer that reminds me of a light white bread/angel food type cake. Give this beer a try."
"12 ounce bottle. Island Wheat pours out a cloudy yellow color with a big, white head. Strong wheat aroma with some citrus. The tangy wheat flavor is light and totally inoffensive. The wheat flavor dominates. Just a bit lemony. I taste no hops. Finish is watery. No sign at all of alcohol. A poundable beer, indeed. This is a decent enough brew, if not this beer drinker's cup of tea. It's certainly worth trying once."
"So my buddy has a kegerator and its always good to keep everyone happy. I'm just glad he didnt opt for miller lite or blue moon. American Pale Wheats are a tad boring in my opinion, but this serves as a nice session. It was far better out of the keg than when i had it on draft at state street brats"
"Pours a pale, hazy golden yellow with a small tan head. Smell is funky sour at first, a little off-putting. Taste has that same sour bite but quickly transitions into an unispiring grassy wheat which mysteriously fades to water. Kind of like Budweiser Select. I guess this makes it pretty drinkable, I was able to put a few back, but doesn't really show any character either. Seems like Capital is trying to put out a macro here. They make it seem crafty and unique in its gimmick - it's made from wheat exclusively grown on Washington Island, right off Door County - but this is probably the most boring beer I've had from Capital. It'll be a big hit among the bar crowd and macro drinkers who think they're drinking fancy beer now for sure."
"Klosterweizen accomplishes all this already, and so much more."
"Not my favorite in the style but definitely another solid brew from Capital that I will drink again and again at my favorite watering holes downtown."
