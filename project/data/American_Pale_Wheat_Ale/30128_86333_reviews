"Strong citrus smell and aftertaste. My least favorite of revolver."
"taster at Uncle Buck's in Grapevine."

"Wondeful beer.  Very drinkable, especially if you can find it on tap."
"very very very very  good"

"Awesome beer!  Need more in Kentucky."

"Very nice wheat color and the blood orange gives it a hint of a tart aftertaste."
""
""
""
""

"Poured a hazy pale orange color with lots of sediment floating. Nice spicy and citrus flavor. Clean finish and it hides the 7% very well."
""
""
"Paired well with BBQ but was a little too sweet for me"

"The beer poured an opaque orange to straw yellow with a lot of sediment.  I poured about 3/4 of it in my glass, activated the yeast, and poured the rest. The aroma was sweet and spicy with hints of cloves and orange.  I may have detected a bit of honey in the sweet but it could have been my mind making me taste it due to the name. The taste was full of the same spice and orange all riding the honey sweet body.  It was not like honey nut cheerios sweet but rather a good full beer sweetness.  The orange and spice fully emerge as the beer warmed and even gave the Blood and Honey a bit of tartness.  I could also detect the base wheat beer flavors of clove and bananas underneath the orange.  The full bodied brew offered a wonderful take on a standard wheat beer.  I love blood oranges and the blood and honey highlights those flavors.  A winner in my book."

"Normally I do not like fruit in my beer, but this one is surprisingly good and refreshing.  Nice balance between the sweet and citrus."

"Not a fan of how this tastes which is like some kind of artichoke dip, not the flavor I want in a beer"
"Such brew. Many ABV%. :) yes"
"Another bottle that travelled to me from Texas thru my son's generous efforts!  Poured into a pint glass, nice foamy white head with excellent lacing. The smell of oranges and honey is enticing. A cloudy yellow - orange color with a bit of sediment apparent, which is natural for an unfiltered beer. Tasting it there is a definite honey and orange sweetness that was well-balanced and simply deeelicious!  I wish I had more than one of these!"
"The blood orange and spice flavor countered with medium honey sweetness. Interesting combo."
""
"Overall: I don't like solid bits in my beer, I'm going to pour this out. The flavor isn't too bad, and I really like the concept, but there's not enough here to make me want to drink this. I really hope I just got a bad bottle."

"Light but a good bitter for a wheat. Maybe it's just the pour I got, but it tastes a bit salty."
"Had a bottle of this in Weatherford, Texas as we were doing a NC to AZ road trip.  Nice smell and lace.  The blood oranges worked."

"Revolver Brewery is located about five minutes from my house and I tried this beer when they first opened their doors. The sweetness of the beer stands out to a lot of people, and some people just don't like it. However, it think it adds a nice refreshing quality to the beer and it's something I could enjoy outside on a hot summer day with no problems, and I've done it at their location. This is their most popular beer by far, and it's the one that they are bottling currently too. They're still a small operation as far as breweries are concerned but they have been growing very quickly."

"Serving from bottle. You can see the yeast through the bottle, actually looks very tastey just looking at it. Pours a bright golden color with a foamy head. Smells of citrus notes not overpowering. Taste is sweet, lemon, orange, a slight boozyness. Finishes sharp. Very refreshing, drinkable, and unique."
"This is a very pale straw-colored beer with a small head, that fades pretty quickly. The nose is excellent, with a sweet light maltiness, lots of wheat, and tart citrus peel notes, the latter very wit-like. The taste is interesting and unique. The malt is much more prominent than I expected--it's even a little heady. Citrus isn't as prominent as in the nose, but it's still detectable. There is some subtle, not really identifiable spiciness, perhaps from the yeast used. Very good beer!"

"Scored this as an extra in a deal (thanks greg_h).  Poured into a pokal glass, produced a thin 1/2"" head which dissipated fairly quickly. A:  I love the appearance of an unfiltered wheat. Hazy and golden in the glass. S:  You can really smell the spice and the honey from the glass. T:  nice and light. Get the spice and hint of orange off the nose with a clean finish. Reminds me of a more flavorful Oberon. No hint of booze, really well blended. Also with a light and refreshing mouth feel. Overall, I am really impressed with this beer. Being from Chicago, I'd never even heard of it before. I would say it's one of my new favorites of the style. Great summer beer."

"This was a little bit oddball, but still very tasty and one of the more unique wheat beers I've had."
"Pours a nice bright golden yellow with a big white head. Lot's of dark bits and pieces. Smells terrific! Smells very sweet, fresh and citrusy. However, there's no sweetness in the taste. A very lively clean and refreshing beer. Really enjoyed this one."

"It is bottled and distributed here locally and worth the extra dollar for this great tasting beer. Between the bottled and on tap, prefer on tap of course. But the beer bottled up tastes just as good. Any given Saturday, when you can, take the trip out to the brewery to enjoy some music, local food, horse shoes and great tasting beer."

"Summary - Good brew, pretty unique. Maybe a little heavy on the OJ, but still tasty. Would drink it again."

"Atmosphere is really good. Opaque golden hue, thick persistent frothy head, and plenty of lacing. Nose is bready with fall spice and some citrus. Thick and syrupy wheat, accentuated with citrus rind, and cinnamon spice. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great beer, a year round drinker and favorite."
""

"O: A lot of hype locally over the release of this beer in bottles. Certainly lived up to the hype. Strikes me as a great summertime beer."

"The rest is a showcase in how an experienced hand crafts a beer -- subtle flavor additions; well-balanced and well-blended flavors. In the nose, touches of citrus peel blend with honey to give the brew a smooth, creamsicly aroma. The flavor has the same aspect, though more pronounced wheat here adds notes of banana and apple before a lingering finish of earthy honey. This, along with a pillowy medium body and mild carbonation, make Blood and Honey eminently drinkable."

"O: This is quickly becoming one of my favorite wheat beers. The complexity of the taste really had me surprised. I was used to writing off all wheat beers as generally tasting the same. Really glad that I have access to this as it is one that my wife and I can both share. Looking forward to drinking lots more this summer."
"Lots of honey and blood orange in the nose and the palate. Well balanced and drinkable, with a solid mouth feel for style. All in all, a great offering from Revolver."

"The beer pours a cloudy orange body. The smell is sweet, with blood orange and honey. The taste is very similar to the taste, but I also get a nice wheat flavor. The beer tingles on the back of the throat and goes down easy. This is the best wheat beer I have ever had."
""
""
""
"On tap at the Common Table. The beer pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma has a lot of orange citrus notes, as well as some wheat. The flavor is more complex. I get some great wheat and honey notes, as well as some herbs and juicy citrus. As I drink the beer, the herbal notes get stronger and stronger and add more and more to the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice."
