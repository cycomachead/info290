"Too sweet. Unfiltered, so it is cloudy; however, the large floaters were off putting. Maybe the bottle was too old."
"Mouthfeel is fairly light for a beer of this strength.  Alcohol presence and ""bite"" are very light. The bitterness, offset by fruity sweetness and somewhat sour finish are more pronounced.  Not bad at all!!!"

"wheat and mango, i expected sweet, but really sour."
""
""
"This is pretty solid, but honestly, kind of unexciting and I don't really want to ever have it again."
""
"O - The overwhelming sourness ruins this one.  The only reason I would try it again is to make sure this wasn't just a bad bottle."
""
"Tastes like fresh mango, perfect pairing with Thai food"
""

"The smell is wheat, mango, a little honey, citrus and malt.  The mango is the most dominant smell with just a tad bit of alcohol.  The flavor is mango, citrus tartness, earthy wheat and citrus.  The mouthfeel is fizzy and a bit puckering like a wild ale.  It does drink much better than 10%, but you have to really like mango to be into this one."
"D: This was a decent fruity wheat beer. The scent wasn't great, but the taste was better, and the body was great. It had a fairly smooth finish too, so it was pretty easy to drink. Probably not for aging, although the bottle suggests otherwise."
"Consumed @ 7 months. Have one more bottle and i think i might let it sit 2-3 years and see what happens"

"12 oz. bottle. Fine wheat ale!"

"Unfortunately, my pint suffered an accident and I'd like to try this again."

"Overall well worth the price of admission I love some good fruit beers. Only drawback was getting this too late (bottled on 6/10/14) after 5 months it really collected sediment. Would get it again very tart and fruity like a high ABV lambic!"
"O- A lot going on here, as expected, and the end result is quite good.  The alcohol/sweetness/tartness dynamic is pretty on-point with no one element overpowering the other."

"O: A very nice blend of sour beer and wheat beer. Definitely shows both characters well and certainly blends them well. Extremely easy to drink for being on the tart side and 10%. Definitely worth giving it a try"

"Very fruity. Hard to believe it's 10% Surprisingly good."
""
""
""
""
"O: I was not sure what to expect with a American Pale Wheat Ale that clocks in at 10% ABV, but this is not as light and easy to drink as others in the style - a little heavy handed with the alcohol but not as intense as Weyerbacher tends to be..."

"(3.65) O:  an interesting flavor, but one im unsure of drinking in multiples. Tart fruitiness, some sourness factors in, with a manageable alcohol content that is probably much higher then perceived. Consumed young, maybe some aging is in order."
""
"Overall, a decent blend of a soured ale and wheat ale, the mango kind of gets lost.  Still quite enjoyable."

"3.73/5: A slightly sour wheat ale with superbly hidden booze; definitely worth a shot"
""
""
"O:  I really wonder what this would be like in 2019.  So much funk here, that really overcomes and outlasts the initial tartness.  Really interesting beer here that I would like to see how it ages."

"O - I've been patiently waiting for this beer since I heard they were making it. I'm a sucker for mango, big wheat beers, and Weyerbacher. I wasn't let down. I very much appreciated the sour flavors present here. I would have liked a little bit more mango flavor. Another great beer from this imperial anniversary series."
"Pours a hazy amber with a thick but fizzy white head, a few sprays of lace on the glass. Smell: pale sweetness and wheat cracker, dried mango and other soft fruit... a swirl and there's a vaguely banana pudding thing, then it's gone and just a pale wheat w/ sweetened dried mango. Taste: out of nowhere this is tart... lactic... which is good because otherwise it would be just cloying undercarbonated pale malt overload. Sugary mango again, then tart jolly rancher finish. Sticky. Sneakily boozy post swallow. This is rough but there's one point in the sip where it's an interesting idea...then a sugar wave hits and it's rough again. Get rid of the ""anniversary beers are >10%"" motto and try this again?"

"I'm usually a big fan of Weyerbacher's anniversary beers, but I'm not really a big fan of this one. It sounded like something that would be up my alley, but the sweetness is really over the top for me. It's still a unique take on the style. It's not bad, it's just not for me."

"D - I've been a huge fan of the Weyerbacher Anniversary series since close to the beginning, but this one misses the mark for me a bit... It's not bad, but it doesn't live up to the lofty expectation that I typically carry for the annual offering... It's an interesting and aggressive attempt at something new, and while i commend that, it falls a bit short of achieving what I think it set out to do... It does hide the high-ABV rather well..."

"Overall: A pretty good take on a wheat beer. Good mango and spice presence with a nice controlled sweetness."
""
"Mouthfeel is very nice- medium body (not boozy at all) and moderately well carbonated. I actually liked this beer- if you're into anything tart or if you like fruity beers but want a little more intrigue."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Almost lambic in its fruity carbonatedness. Basically highly carbonated alcoholic fruit juice with little balance. Good if you like that kind of thing, or possibly refreshing on a hot day."

"Overall (4.0): I’m not saying I have a better style classification in mind for this beer, but did someone list this as an American Pale Wheat Ale as a joke? Maybe “Fruit/Vegetable Beer” would be better, or American Wild. Consequently, I’m rating this not to “style” but to whatever the hell impression it makes on me. That being the case, I think this is a fascinating and very enjoyable, even if not transcendent, exploration of style. It’s creative, it’s well-done, it pushes some boundaries but not outrageously so, and it’s memorable for how unique it is if nothing else."
"Best Weyerbacher anniversary beer in a few years. Really liking this one, never had anything like it. This was a single, going back for a case for sure."
"Pours into a large tulip glass a deep honey color with a frothy white head that is gone pretty quickly.Wow alot going on in the nose with the mango at the for front along with some light phenol spice and sweet alcohol,smell like alcoholic candy.Flavors have a bit of a sourness to them wich took me by surprise a little to go along with the tropical fruitiness,phenol yeasty spice,and sweet alcohol in the finish.Sometimes the ""big"" Weyerbacher beers can be a little heavy handed in the alcohol department...this one not to much,although it plays a role all the flavors come together pretty well here.Nice job."

"Overall I would get this beer again and really enjoyed it. A very good representation for an anniversary brew."

"O: This is a solid, likeable, and easy to drink beer. Different than what I expected, but good nonetheless."
"Grabbed this one on draft at roast house in Frederick. Good looking beer with a decent smell with noticeable alcohol. Taste is excellent, more sweet than tart but really smooth and the way the taste covers the alcohol makes it crazy easy to drink for the ABV."

"Overall: oh, man. That's some good sipping stuff there. Definitely happy I got this."
""
""

"I don't understand the high ratings. Mango...where? All I get is sour beer. Sour beer is ...sour beer! Did not enjoy this beer at all. If you like sour beer, huh? ...then this is for you. I am sure this will be a ""one time"" brew. Weyerbacher...this experiment failed."
""
"O- This is pretty good, worth trying. Quickly summery of the beer would be a some tart hefe with mango."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This another winner from Weyerbacher and hope I can score a bit more before it's gone than my initial 4-Pack. Although this an ageable brew, I would abstain, as I think the balance is remarkable now and think the tartness will gain momentum and become more prominent (i.e. more sour) as time passes. Their anniversary releases are always inventive and well-crafted of which Nineteen continues that trend. Happy Anniversary Weyerbacher and to many more! (4.5)"

"D: Extremely drinkable for a beer at 10%. All over the place with elements of different styles. It looks and feels like a pale ale, with a nice wheat flavor on the finish. You don't get too much hops as you may expect with a pale ale, and there really is no malt backing. It has elements of the Gose and Gueuze styles as well. Interesting beer, but would probably not purchase again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really good beer. I'm wishing I had picked up a 4 pack rather than a single. Sourness is only mild, but works well with the base beer and compliments the mango nicely. I would definitely get this again."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle. Bottled on 6/6/14...Enjoy by 6/6/19"
""
""
"The mango character tastes more like apricots to me. Drinks really easy for 10%. Pretty unique offering from Weyerbacher definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Super happy I picked up a case of this limited release. I will be going through the bottles slowly, and be sure to hide some to age over the next few years."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm glad I have a four pack of this. I'm still working my way toward complete appreciation of sour/tart beers, but I am enjoying this one."
"O - No heat whatsoever for a 10%+ beer, dangerously drinkable with the hidden ABV. Refreshing"
